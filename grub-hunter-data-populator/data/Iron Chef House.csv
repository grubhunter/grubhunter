"I was originally going to meet a friend at Jun Shokudo about 15 minutes away from this place, but that ended up being closed on Sundays. She was really craving sushi, so we looked for what else was within walking distance, and found the Iron Chef House! Definitely worth the extra half mile walk. Iron Chef House is a small restaurant, but it's cozy and comfortable. We were seated immediately and the waitstaff was very attentive. The sushi was incredibly fresh and flavorful, and they had a nice variety of interesting maki. It was exciting to find a Japanese place not too far from me conveniently located by the Clark Street station. I will likely be returning in the future!",5.0
"Iron Chef House is the place to get sushi in Brooklyn Heights. With a dim intimate interior, expert sushi chefs, a broad menu, reasonable pricing, and fast service, its hard to think of anything I didn't like. In our trip here, Perry and I ordered the Love Boat, which came with soup or salad and a literal boatload of fresh fish and a few rolls. The fish was varied, from standard salmon, tuna, and white tuna, to amberjack, snapper, and fluke, tofu skins, and eel. Some pieces were sushi, some sashimi, and the rolls were quite tasty. All the fish was fresh, cool, and refreshing. There was definitely enough food for two people without feeling like we gorged ourselves. The Love Boat is definitely easy on the wallet, at about $20 a person. I definitely would love to come back and try something new on the menu. For now - YAY! I'm a fan.",4.0
"This place is a true hidden gem. It's so small, but super packed that I had to wait roughly 15 minutes for an available seat; totally worth it, though. Do yourself a huge favor and always order the MONKEY roll. I'm not a huge sushi or restaurant person in general, but nothing is stopping me from coming back. Great food, great staff, great vibe, great atmosphere, great company. Best sushi place.",4.0
"Smoked salmon fried rice was incredible, $7 for a large portion, super moist with chunks of salmon.Also tried Alaska roll ($4.50), good but nothing unexpected. 2019 roll is delicious, wrapped in slightly cooked Bok choy ($11.50).Two of us went, and each got a roll, and then split the fried rice - perfect portion.Space is decently sized, and they have a big table you can reserve for a group, looked like it could fit 6-8 people, easily, maybe more.Four stars because the staff was SO overinvolved. For example, I took off the paper chopstick cover, folded it into an origami swan, and then dropped it on the table. I swear, fifteen seconds later, one of them darted over, swiped it off, and threw it in the trash. They give you a pitcher of water for the table, but it doesn't matter, because they'll come and refill your water as soon as you take a sip.Worth it, and I'll come back, but their hovering was really annoying.",4.0
"Love Iron Chef House! The service, ambiance, and of course the food are all amazing.  I've been a patron of this restaurant since I moved to NY and was lucky enough to live around the corner from this sushi hot spot - 9 years!  The sushi is consistently fresh, creative and delicious.  There's only space for about 20 people in the restaurant, but the decor is super fun and the wait staff are amazingly friendly and attentive.  I think they filled my water glass religiously (I drink a ton of water) throughout the night, never letting it get to more than half way gone.  Highly recommend for a great date spot, place to catch up with friends, good place to take visiting parents - basically an awesome spot for anyone who loves sushi!",5.0
"Following a Saturday afternoon of poetry and prose in Brooklyn Heights, as the Power of One I came here to be immersed in Sashimi $17.00 and steamed pork Gyoza $4.75 with the culmination of one Plum Wine $6.00 of a moving, inspiring poetic performance. Staff is attentive but appears very disgruntled, overworked and underpaid with a extremely weary look.  A café size restaurant intimate small but produces good quality sushi and Sashimi that is fresh to eat my fill.  Assorted Sashimi regular platter comprises of a choice of soup or salad. Choice of hot Green Tea or water is offered. My hot Green tea was invigorating to the senses with fresh loose tea leaves rather from a standard mass produced tea bag.  Atmosphere is very dim and the ceiling lightening fixture captures one's attention as art which surrounds the company banner logo.  The business name originates from the popular Japanese competitive cooking TV show 料 理 の 鉄人 Ryōri no Tetsujin (""Ironmen of Cooking"") to bring the Japanese cooking spirit to Brooklyn Heights.  The sushi bar is openly visible with four men behind the counter rolling, cutting and attentively crafting sushi or Sashimi edible art.Note:  Staff are Mandarin Chinese but do not allow it to deter you from merriment of good quality Japanese cuisine and libation.  No business cards are available but takeout menus exist.",4.0

"I had takeout from here the other day. Let me be clear with you, I've had better shrimp tempura's before and the one I had here was subpar. I was very disappointed in this place considering the fact that it has 4 stars on Yelp  and a magazine I believe it was, considered this to be the ""best sushi place in Brooklyn"". Wow what an understatement. I've had better sushi in numerous locations. Maybe I should just stick to Sakura in Astoria, considering that's my favorite place. I don't recommend this place nor do I imagine myself coming back here again. Bye bye!",2.0
"Worth a visit.  I had dinner on a Sunday during Summer and there was only one other table of customers.  The service was attentive, maybe a little too attentive because several servers stood around and stared at me as I ate.  The Vegetable Miso Soup was served much too hot and burned my tongue a little but tasted great.  The Monkey Roll was good but not very memorable.  Overall, I had a good experience.",3.0
"I wish I still had jury duty so I can go to Iron Chef House for lunch again! I had the 3 roll lunch special, $11, at Iron Chef House. This 3 roll lunch special is served with the lightest and yummiest miso soup I ever had and with a nice sized side salad too. I picked the salmon skin roll, spicy tuna roll and the eel avocado roll. The salmon skin roll was the best salmon skin roll I ever had. Most of the time I don't like to order the salmon skin roll because it's too soggy and not crisp enough. The salmon skin was freshly crisped up at Iron Chef House. It was the most memorable lunch I had near the Brooklyn Federal Courthouse. It's actually diagonally across the 2,3 subway train station on Clark Street.Now I have to figure out if I can take a train to Clark Street, get back in time during my one hour lunch. I think I am going to try one day!! Yeah, it was that good!...my jury duty lunch adventures continue...",4.0

"Iron Chef House is a little small Japanese place that gets filled up pretty quickly during lunch time. Thankfully, we got here early and beat the lunch crowd. I was craving a kani salad but they don't have that on the menu. I asked about it and they said that they could substitute the crab salad with imitation crab meat. It's not the typical kani salad (cucumber, mayo, roe, imitation crab meat), but it actually has arugula in it. It wasn't bad, but not just what I expected. We also ordered the BBQ grilled octopus. It wasn't bad at all, but there was either some kind of gritty that I didn't know what it was. We each ordered the sashimi lunch special. It came beautifully plated with two pieces of salmon, white tuna (I think), and tuna sashimi. There's also two pieces of sushi and a California roll. I love how fresh the fish was. I've been to many low-end sushi restaurants and this was definitely much fresher -- and didn't have to break the bank! The lunch sashimi order came out to about $1/piece of sashimi. It didn't look like a lot of food but with the two appetizers, house salad, and soup, this was the right amount of food. Since we came for a co-worker's birthday lunch, we also ordered the fried green tea ice cream. I'm not a big fan of fried ice cream but this was surprisingly delicious. It wasn't too oily and the batter had just enough crunch even though it was sitting in a puddle of melted green tea ice cream. All in all, a great lunch spot that I'm hoping to return very soon.",5.0
"This was great! I came here with two of my coworkers for the lunch specials. It was late and I was REALLY hungry, so I got the sashimi +sushi plate with an extra eel roll, with brown rice. It was amazing! I loved the freshness. You know that one ""meh"" sashimi piece one always gets from lower priced sushi joints? That didn't happen. I also wanted to eat the leftovers from both of my coworkers AFTER I finished my food...which either means I am a total pig or this place is really good. I am going to just give this place 5 stars and hope that it was the latter...",5.0
"3 stars? 3.5 maybe. I'm not sure.There are plenty of sushi restaurants around and this one was the first one I tried around here. It was a pleasant experience.The regular rolls are regular rolls. California, Alaska, are always good. I think this place shines when it comes to specialty rolls. One of the rolls I got was their well known Monkey roll. No regrets. A colorful combination of avocado and three sauces. My friends envied me as I ate the entire roll piece by piece. Another roll I got that stood out was a special lobster roll. it was big. It was pink. Each piece was a big mouthful. Loved it.The atmosphere was Ok. It felt a little tight and cold air was constantly blowing in (we had window seats).Overall, nice restaurant. Prices were great for sushi, but I am willing to try the numerous other sushi places close by.",3.0
"Great sushi spot in Brooklyn Heights. I ordered the steak teriyaki and shrimp/vegetable tempura dinner Bento Box which came with a fresh green salad, soup, noodles and shumai. The serving size was impressive and the steak was cooked perfectly. The presentation of the food was also very appetizing. Rolls and specialty rolls here are also very good. Right now I am in love with the Atlantic roll.The environment inside is both trendy and cozy, and every time I go it seems to be packed with customers. However, I've never had to wait more than 20 minutes for a table.Iron Chef House is a win in my book!",5.0
"I was in the FIDI area and could not find a good sashimi spot in the area so I crossed the Brooklyn Bridge and came to this place!  I got their lunch special of sashimi and sushi, which comes with soup and salad and a lot of it!  Their carrot ginger dressing had a slight aftertaste from what I have had before...so I did not like that.  The sashimi I got was buttery and fresh!  especially the albacore and salmon.  The sushi roll - again had a little of an aftertaste and I think it was from the crabsticks.  Overall I would come back to get sashimi alone!  Their customer service is also really great ...even with a lunch rush you won't see empty water glasses!",4.0
"After I went to Japan, I cannot see sushi the same. Came in here after walking across the Brooklyn Bridge and were seated right away around 6pm, which was nice since it was a small restaurant. Everyone here was Caucasian and eating rolls, so I already assumed this place was an Americanized Japanese restaurant. They workers are Chinese, but they cater to American taste buds. We ordered the Sashimi Deluxe which came with a salad, nigiris (macakerel, red snapper, scallop, creamy scallop, and salmon), and a Valentines Roll. The salad was had a gingery dressing, which I didn't like so I barely touched it. The sashimi wasn't bad, but very thick. I probably liked the tuna and salmon best. The nigiris were all decent, but the creamy scallop tasted like some sort of potato salad. I think the scallop was the best nigiri out of all of them. The Valentine Roll had a small kick to it, but not bad. I was surprised the waiters asked us twice if we wanted rice with our sashimi, as if we were doing it wrong.. but I guess they are use to offering it to people not familiar with the Japanese cuisine. Probably won't be back because I didn't think it was anything outstanding, but nothing tasted too fishy/oceany which is a plus. They are also fast.The bathroom is also dark and the urinal was clogged, which is gross.. so that docked a star too.",3.0
"Found Iron Chef through the 4-star yelp rating which set my expectations high.

"Came here on a Tuesday afternoon around 30 minutes before they were supposed to close (there were people coming in 5 minutes before closing so I wasn't the worst case scenario). We were seated as soon as we entered the restaurant so there wasn't much of a wait. However, about 60 seconds had passed since we were seated and one of the waiters was already scrambling towards us with pen and notepad in hand. When we told him we needed more time to order, he immediately pointed to the clock and stated that the restaurant was closing soon. That came off as a bit rude to me. This continued throughout our meal, with both the waiters jumping at every chance to grab the plates off our tables. The amount of times I heard, ""You done with that?"" throughout my entire meal was ridiculous. The minute my friend picked up the last piece of sushi, one of the waiters was already scooping up the plate and literally (I kid you not) 10 seconds later, the other waiter slapped the check onto the table. I understand they were closing soon, but there were other customers that were eating as well so I didn't see the need to push us out so abruptly. On the plus side, the food was great. My friend and I ordered the Monster appetizer, 2011 roll and the raw fish bowl. The presentation was beautiful and everything tasted fresh and savory, so no complaints on the food. Just the service. This is a great cozy spot for sushi if you're in the area - it's worth the time even if you're not.

Perhaps, but not really the point of this review.That being said, I think this is a SOLID neighborhood sushi joint. As long as you go in not expecting great omakase, I think you're fine. If you want cool specialty rolls, this is the place to go. The regular rolls (ie. salmon roll) are actually a great deal. VERY large portions at a good price point.

"Think twice before coming here as the staff are extremely inattentive and unwelcoming. I stood by the hostess table for 5 minutes and none of the workers acknowledged me or wanted to come over. The restaurant wasn't even busy as the whole middle section appeared to be reserved. After waiting patiently for 5 minutes, one the male waiters finally comes over asks me how many. After I tell him, he leaves me hanging for another couple minutes before telling me it's a 10-15 minute wait. I stood outside for 20 minutes with absolutely no updates from the staff. This place is an absolute joke and disgrace with such high ratings/reviews.",1.0
"After a long walk across the Brooklyn Bridge, I stopped by for some sushi here. I liked the decorations of this place.

"The fish is so fresh and tasty.  Rice is fresh and well done.  The rolls are all nice, but don't waste your time... Go for sashimi and sushi.  Also tried the curry udon.  It is coconut curry; spicy with tons of seafood.  Really nice.",5.0

My coworker brought me to this plave and I strongly recommend whoever loves Asian food should try. I love their Monster and Salmon skin salad. My favourite!,4.0
Its an ok place for sushi. When I first started coming here 3 years ago the place was nice. At some point they did a remodel and for some reason plastered straw or hay on the walls. It now smells like a barn when you walk in. Not the smell you want when you are already eating something with distinct smells such as sushi. When I need to get out of the barn I will come here again.,3.0
"The portion sizes are obscene... in the best sense of the word. Friends took me here, and I was blown away by the taste and value of the sushi! Now, if you're a sushi purest, you might not agree with me. In that case, stick to the sashimi or traditional sushi section of the menu. But if you're into genius flavor combinations, and want to fill up on sushi, this is your place. Oishi!",5.0
"I was yelping a sushi restaurant and stumbled upon this iron chef house and I must say this is the best sushi restaurant I have been to thus far.

Amazing local gem. I've been many times and haven't tried anything on the menu that wasn't delicious. The portions are more than fair. Bento boxes are big enough for two.

"I can only speak for their delivery service, but it was top notch! Sushi and entrees for 4 people ordered around 2pm on a Saturday was prepared and delivered to our place on Tillary Street (normally a 10 minute walk away) in under half an hour!Their menu is friendly to vegans, vegetarians, and people who don't even really like fish or sushi, which is great when eating in a group with varied tastes and diet restrictions.I ordered their Spicy Mixed Vegetables roll, Sweet Potato Roll, and Avocado Roll all made with brown rice, which they were happy to oblige. Three rolls filled a large box because each roll was cut into 10 pieces (instead of the normal 8) and was more than enough food for 2 meals, or one extremely hungry one!I was the only one in our group who did not order an entree, but they still gave us 4 miso soups which were warm, had big chunks of tofu and seaweed, and was not salty like many Japanese restaurants make it.",4.0

Did I mention even the sake was pretty inexpensive, because it was. I'd come again and definitely recommend you go if looking for a quality sushi meal at a great price point.

"I was always get takeout, but this place is always packed when I go pick up my food. It's clear why: the food is awesome. My favorite thing about this place is the fact that you can easily customize your sushi.

"Finally came here after wanting to try this place for the past 2 years! I came here on a Friday, made reservations for 9 and my date and I got seated right away. We got one appetizer to share (monster) I believe it's called and some hot sake to start off the night. We decided to get 3 special rolls ( monkey, 2011 & 2015) and they were all so delicious!! I don't think I've had such great sushi in a long time. The service was great, the waitresses kept coming by to check up on us. I'll definitely come back here!",5.0
"They have a ""B"" out front and that almost made me turn around and find another place for dinner, but something told me to try it out. I am happy I did, because this is what I experienced:Service = 4Food= 3Ambiance= 3.5My rolls and soup were great and my husband's were also awesome. The service here is what brings up my review. I appreciate staff who go the extra distance to ensure your experience is pleasant. I will definitely be back!",4.0

Sushi smushi.... Yes this place does standard sushi - but if you really want an experience that will take you're breathe away you have to try the following. ...Start- monster! Wow!Next - 2011 roll (lobster roll) delicious. Ask for more sauce on the side. Volcano - bring the fire!!! Crab and avo on fire. Banana roll - mind bending. This is without a doubt the best value for money and flavor filled sushi experience in NYC.

"Okay, so I know people in generally like to knock the Asian fusion and, let's face it, Chinese-run Japanese joints, but I've got to hand it to you, Iron Chef House knows how to do Asian fusion right. Here's the rundown of our menu selections for three people: Iceland appetizer: Mostly a green-colored dish that doesn't look like it would be super flavorful, but don't be fooled. Sweet, savory, and perfectly balanced (white tuna and mango combination FTW).Monster appetizer: A mix of everything awesome. I detected mango, salmon, crabmeat and avocado. Yellowtail cheek: The meat was fatty, succulent, and savory, with the perfect refreshing balsamic accompaniment. Sapporo roll: Soft-shell crab with jalapeño and roe. Delicious.Uni: I'm not even a big fan of uni, but this stuff was ridiculously fresh-tasting and buttery, like a sea foie.The ocean roll was the only dish that I found a little bland, especially next to the other dishes. Also, the salmon sashimi features the biggest slices of salmon you've ever seen (I guess whether that's a pro or con is up to your discretion -- I love raw salmon, so no complaints here). Being that I'm sort of a purist when it comes to sushi, I hesitate to award this place five stars, given that its cuisine seems more of a riff on sushi-based traditions.

"One of the best sushi places around, hands down. And, luckily, it's located just a few feet away from our place here in Brooklyn Heights. So, what makes this place so great? Well, first off, the food is tasty! They offer both mainstream rolls (spicy tuna, Philadelphia, etc.) and speciality rolls... and also feature daily chef's specials, bento boxes, etc. etc. Some of my favorite rolls from the menu include the Monkey Roll (shrimp tempura w/ avocado and spicy sauce) and the Crazy Dragon Rol (spicy crabmeat w/ eel, tuna, & salmon). Also tasty at Iron Chef are the appetizers, soups, and salads. I recommend the Yaki Udon chicken noodle soup! Awesome!! As for atmosphere, it's great, too. The place is small and intimate and adorned w/ dark wood fixtures and aged brick... very classy and perfect for an intimate date for two or dinner out with a small group.",4.0
"Though it's a lengthy walk from school, the quality of ICH's sushi is worth it.  Their prices are higher than the other Japanese restaurants that litter Brooklyn Heights, but their chefs know what they're doing.  I opted for three roll lunch special (spicy tuna and spicy salmon), and the size of the ceramic dish caused me to choke on my water, but lo and behold, the dish was spotless within a few minutes.  Start with their crisp and lightly-salted edamame and then work your way to their sushi and sashimi.  You won't be disappointed.",4.0

I'm always skeptical of sushi places that don't offer up whole cuts. Who's to say that they aren;t cutting their salmon with a cheaper fish? A MYSTERY fish!The flavor of the salmon was not quite right and I left feeling nauseous and disappointed with the affordable but slightly 'off' sushi. Will not go back.File under: MEH.",2.0

"I've been meaning to update my review of Iron Chef for about 2 years now. Mea culpa, mea culpa.Iron Chef is a cozy little Japanese restaurant/sushi bar located near the heart of Brooklyn Heights. After experiencing all of the sushi restaurants within a 10 block radius of my home, I must say that Iron Chef House has now become my favorite sushi joint in B Heights. After switching to brown rice sushi, I have found that nobody else makes brown rice as well as they do. It's fresh, fluffy, and obviously not made in a microwave.Often I go to ICH for their Saturday lunch special to enjoy a peaceful, cheap meal of yummy sushi. Their lunch special is 2 rolls for $7.95 which comes with soup and salad. Brown rice costs $1 extra per roll. My favorites are their spicy tuna roll, the Rising Sun roll (eel roll topped with salmon and cavier), spicy salmon roll and any other special roll combos. I think they excel with rolls more than they do with nigiri or sashimi but that is just my opinion. I also love their miso soup but it's hard to screw that one up. Plating is always nicely presented and service is attentive. ICH also has a nice sake list which is decently priced for the money conscious drinker.If you do go for dinner, please note that the environment becomes completely different as it can be extremely crowded and LOUD on a Friday/Saturday night. This past weekend was no exception as my friend and I snagged the last table available and saw a line of people waiting outside to get into this little place. Prepare to have people practically on top of you on either side as they are trying to fit in as many tables as possible.One of these days I need to throw all caution to the wind and order the Sakura Roll (spicy tuna and salmon roll, topped with king crab meat) and the Special Lobster Roll (spicy lobster, crunchy flakes and avocado on top).

"Saturday night around 8:20 - made reservations for 2 because everyone said we needed them, but there were a couple of empty tables. We sat in a corner by the window. I knew this place was small, but I didn't realize how small! It's pretty tiny.Servers are nice, but leave you alone most of the time. Service isn't really too quick, which is both good and bad. Even though there weren't a lot of people there, we waited quite a while, but on the other hand, it felt very casual. No rush.Our server made some recommendations according to our preferences, which was helpful.We ended up getting:Iron Chef Spicy - tuna, fresh scallop, avocado, caviar - caviar on top was greatHana - salmon, tuna, eel, avocado topped with seared white tuna - this was delicious! The seared tuna was particularly fantasticAlso a spicy tuna roll, cucumber carrot roll, and a side of white rice.They don't have a crazy variety of stuff and much of it is pretty run of the mill, but everything tasted great, seemed fresh, and was a pleasant experience.

"One of my best friends recommended this restaurant to my boyfriend & I about a month ago but sadly, I was sick for a while and didn't start feeling better til two weeks ago, so we finally gave it a try today.The restaurant is somewhat small but I did feel warm and welcomed upon entrance to the restaurant. It's spacious, warm, and has a very modern Asian vibe and look to it. Even the bathroom is very nice! The service was top-notch, my boyfriend & my dish was quite big so since the table next to us was empty, our waitress helped push the table closer to us so we have a little room for our dishes and food,how nice of them! For appetizer, we got a BBQ Squid - a rather simple dish but overall, pretty good and tasty. Lunch, My boyfriend got a Chicken Noodle Bowl and it was a pretty big  bowl of noodle soup with eggplant, udon noodles, chicken and other vegetables, very tasty and light! I loved it.I got a Salmon Teriyaki Combo box, it came with an assortment of food and it was very good, that I finished almost the whole darn thing.  Gosh I'm a pig.I am totally coming back here!

"Honestly the sushi was deliciously and although we went on a super busy night, we never deserved to be basically asked to leave. We were there shorter than most of the people at the restaurant and when asked if we wanted dessert and we replied no the lady stated ""good, choice"" We were quite bothered by this, but decided to let it go. Now, we payed our bill to be kind and leave and our waitress came back to ask for more tip!!! First off, our bill was over a 130$ and ordered a lot, and left the amount of tip that we believed they deserved which was over double digits, even with kicking us out. How embarrassing! We asked to speak to a manager and she lies that there isn't one, well we got lucky and spoke to the actual manager that was in the back. She lied and stated she never did that. The manager was beyond kind, but sadly no matter how good a place is (food wise) customer service is key and because of that lady with short hair up to her cheeks, she killed it for everyone in there.",1.0

"This review is based on delivery.  I ordered their lobster roll, asking that the lobster meat not be fried.  This was repeated at least 4 times so I was pretty confident I was going to receive what I asked for.  Nope.  The lobster meat was tempura fried.  And for $17+ tip, I should hold off and buy myself a lobster roll from the RHLP since there wasn't much meat in the roll.  The atmosphere looks so inviting every time I walk by around dinner, but I think I'll try Ani Sushi next time I have a hankering for sushi delivery.",2.0
"Saturday night around 8:20 - made reservations for 2 because everyone said we needed them, but there were a couple of empty tables. We sat in a corner by the window. I knew this place was small, but I didn't realize how small! It's pretty tiny.Servers are nice, but leave you alone most of the time. Service isn't really too quick, which is both good and bad. Even though there weren't a lot of people there, we waited quite a while, but on the other hand, it felt very casual. No rush.Our server made some recommendations according to our preferences, which was helpful.We ended up getting:Iron Chef Spicy - tuna, fresh scallop, avocado, caviar - caviar on top was greatHana - salmon, tuna, eel, avocado topped with seared white tuna - this was delicious! The seared tuna was particularly fantasticAlso a spicy tuna roll, cucumber carrot roll, and a side of white rice.They don't have a crazy variety of stuff and much of it is pretty run of the mill, but everything tasted great, seemed fresh, and was a pleasant experience. Would go back if I were around the neighborhood.",4.0
i absofuckinglutly love this place. I have been to many sushi spots in NYC and this one is by far one of my favorite. The prices are very reasonable and the cocktails are not to expensive considering the area it is located. If your ever in Dumbo and craving some awesome sushi make sure to stumble upon this place. OHH and make sure to order the Monkey Roll :p,5.0
"One of my best friends recommended this restaurant to my boyfriend & I about a month ago but sadly, I was sick for a while and didn't start feeling better til two weeks ago, so we finally gave it a try today.The restaurant is somewhat small but I did feel warm and welcomed upon entrance to the restaurant. It's spacious, warm, and has a very modern Asian vibe and look to it. Even the bathroom is very nice! The service was top-notch, my boyfriend & my dish was quite big so since the table next to us was empty, our waitress helped push the table closer to us so we have a little room for our dishes and food,how nice of them! For appetizer, we got a BBQ Squid - a rather simple dish but overall, pretty good and tasty. Lunch, My boyfriend got a Chicken Noodle Bowl and it was a pretty big  bowl of noodle soup with eggplant, udon noodles, chicken and other vegetables, very tasty and light! I loved it.I got a Salmon Teriyaki Combo box, it came with an assortment of food and it was very good, that I finished almost the whole darn thing.  Gosh I'm a pig.I am totally coming back here! Top-Notch Babyyy!",5.0
"Honestly the sushi was deliciously and although we went on a super busy night, we never deserved to be basically asked to leave. We were there shorter than most of the people at the restaurant and when asked if we wanted dessert and we replied no the lady stated ""good, choice"" We were quite bothered by this, but decided to let it go. Now, we payed our bill to be kind and leave and our waitress came back to ask for more tip!!! First off, our bill was over a 130$ and ordered a lot, and left the amount of tip that we believed they deserved which was over double digits, even with kicking us out. How embarrassing! We asked to speak to a manager and she lies that there isn't one, well we got lucky and spoke to the actual manager that was in the back. She lied and stated she never did that. The manager was beyond kind, but sadly no matter how good a place is (food wise) customer service is key and because of that lady with short hair up to her cheeks, she killed it for everyone in there.",1.0
"Walked in for lunch. They seated me right away. They were able to accommodate my dietary restrictions, the food came out quickly and was fresh and nicely cooked. THE WAIT STAff was a bit overwhelmed and forgot to bring me something I asked for. But the speedy service, quality and the price ($9 for a nice healthy lunch) made it all a good experience.",4.0

The wait staff is also very friendly and attentive.",5.0
"i come here once a week to get my sashimi fixfish is fresh and you get 12 pieces of sashimi in the regular order for 16 dollars! last night i went back and actually had 14 pieces for the same price. :Dmy bf and i were starving yesterday so we had the seaweed salad, fried duck roll, he had the bento box (17 dollars for salad, dumplings, soup, and 2 mains! he chose the sashimi and tempura combo)..wait we also had the sashimi regular (because i must have my own order) AND a nigori sake. happy fatties. staff is friendly nand always recommending specials.the tables around us all order really pretty rolls but i'm on a low carb diet and prefer straight up fish but i hear good things about their lobster roll.",5.0

So thankful for yelp- in town tried to find something close and noticed the great reviews and they were justified!  Had the ""dinner special"" - miso soup was good- huge piece of teriyaki salmon with grilled vegetables, PLUS 8 pieces of sashimi!

"Me and my girlfriend stumbled upon this place for dinner after searching for what to eat while in the Brooklyn Heights area and saw that this place had good reviews and decent prices. I'm giving this restaurant 5 stars mainly because it is very good value. We ordered assorted tempura for our appetizer, and shared a monkey roll and sushi & sashimi combination. The vegetable tempuras were fried very well and they were crispy. I love the broccoli tempura, as well as the sweet potato tempura. They are also excellent at making shrimp tempura. The monkey roll was also delicious and slightly spicy. I was very surprised at the size of the sushi & sashimi combination. For $20, we received a large dish of fresh sashimi   and sushi. The Sushi & Sashimi combo comes with yellowtail, salmon, white tuna, and red tuna sashimi and sushi, and a California roll. It can definitely be shared between two people, but you might want to get another roll(s) to be full. For the final price, $36.25, this was a great deal for the quality of sashimi/sushi that we got. The fish was very fresh and tasted delicious and the service was great as well. We were also very full by the end.The ambience of the restaurant is also great and is  a good spot for couples and small groups. The place is small, so if you don't like waiting, make sure you come early or make reservations.Will definitely come back here to try their other sushi. I would like the try the love boat next time.",5.0
"Amazing sushi and very affordable. Everything was top notch here. We got 4 or 5 special rolls to split between 4 people and were very full. We were late for our reservations due to having a hard time finding parking (which might happen depending on when you come there). However, they were very nice and we got a table within 10 minutes of waiting there. The presentation of our sushi was very nicely done and everything was excellent. Do not remember the names of the rolls but from my experience all of the rolls are good and can't say a bad thing about any of them.",5.0

"This is simply a good restaurant. It's probably my favorite place to go to in Brooklyn Heights area. I've been here for lunch and dinner multiple times with both my friends and my girlfriend. The ambiance is pretty nice, the service great, and the overall atmosphere comfortable. While obviously japanese, the restaurant doesn't have too many frills. The old woman who runs this place is really nice(they are Chinese though) and the sushi actually tends to be fresh.The restaurant tends to be packed at peak hours for good reason, locals have realized this is the go to place to eat even in an area with multiple japanese restaurants. As someone whose tried Ozu, Ani sushi, and a couple of the other sushi places near Iron Chef, I can say this is the best place for Japanese.Their lunch combos are a ton of food and in terms of recommendations, you can't go wrong with the monkey roll.Iron Chef is a neighborhood gem.",4.0
"I was skeptical about trying this place at first, because I never liked the taste of sushi. I ended up giving it a chance about a year ago, and I'm so glad I did! it was absolutely delicious and now I love sushi!

"I chose this place based on all the rave reviews, some are even by people I actually know, but was severely disappointed when we came here in September for a quick lunch.Two words.

Having looked up the regulations later it's not the same as getting a B in school. You have to fail inspection on multiple occasions!!! Anyway, now I know. If it wasn't for the food poisoning ALL THREE of us experienced only a few hours after dining there, I'd say the food is still just ok. Not sure why it's 4 stars over much better restaurants in the area. Let me qualify this review by stating that (1) I used to live in that neighborhood for several years so I have reasonable dining quality expectations for the area and this place was sub par (2) I've been eating Sushi and other raw foods for over 15 years now and this is my first food poisoning from any restaurant ever (3) it wasn't severe food poisoning but I suspect it's because I have a generally strong constitution for these things considering its my first one ever. I don't normally leave negative reviews but I feel like its imperative in this case and hopefully it'll force them to keep more sanitary conditions and to warn others who may have weaker stomachs!!! Mind you, we think ours wasn't even from the sushi but the miso soup.  Probably some sort of bacterial contamination in the kitchen or maybe inadequate refrigeration, who knows.",1.0

"It's a Friday night after work and this is my last weekends grabbing sushi with one of my close guy friend in NYC!! We always wanted to try sushi around Brooklyn but we failed.. Since we are spoiled with the food in Manhattan.. So we kinda ignored Brooklyn...So after work.. We just went into Iron Chef since they have an A rating and also higher rating than Sushi Samba (which I heard they have good ratings but overprice).. hmm.. Looking at the menu.. The dinner set caught my eyes on it... My guy friend said he is gonna order that... As for me.. I don't like to order the same thing as my friend does.. I love to order something different and just grab a bite of my friends portion.. (so you can have more variety right??) So.. I look at their special sushi which cost about $10.. I am hesitating whether or not I should order it as for the dinner combo is only $17 with soup, noodles, xiumai.. and you are able to choose sushi, sashimi.. and a few more which I don't remember... As I said I don't like to order what my friend does.. I look at the other specialty.. The sushi and sashimi combo caught my eyes but I am afraid I can't finish it!!! ""You are not gonna be full with just a special roll..!!!"" that's what my guy friend told me... As I remember I can eat a lot of sushi when I was in Malaysia.. hmm... so I finally make up my mind in ordering the sushi and sashimi combo.. It also comes with a bowl of salad..Salad.. the greens that they used are fresh and the dressing is really special as I can feel that the salad dressing and the greens are blending together and the ""freshness"" just went into my mouth.. The miso soup that my guy friend had looks pretty good.. I can't comment on it since I did not try it.. As for the sashimi and sushi that I ordered.. The sashimi is really fresh and clean.. Since it's raw.. So I am really picky on it.. They are really generous in their sashimi as you can taste the fish.. where some of the restaurant will just give you a tiny little bit of sashimi since it's expensive.. The sushi is pretty normal but it's really huge and I can't finish it.. As for my friends dinner combo.. The xiumai tasted really bad.. I think they just bought it from some cheap asian store and just steam it.. :S Other than that.. It's pretty normal but the price is reasonable and if you come to think of the food and the dollar value.. This place is definitely the best sushi priced place!!! (Sorry for my bad English)As you may wonder why do I give 4 stars instead of 5 stars. well.. Since the price is reasonable and the portion is huge.. The place is clean and the raw fish that they used are clean but it might not be in a good quality.. As I can feel it in my mouth.. (I guess it's because I had been to Hatsuhana where the raw fish they used are really fresh but it's way more expensive).. Well.. you can tell it right? I don't think they will price it that cheap if they are using the best quality fish!! Other than that.. I have to say this.. My guy friend claims that after this.. He lost his appetite the next day!! which I don't really believe it since I am totally fine.. (I guess I have a better ""system"" in my body.. :P)",4.0

"For the past 5 years this spot has been on my radar and a once in a while place. I don't know why I don't come here more often. The food is consistently good and the service is great, always peppy and up to make a joke or two. Hard Rock roll is one of the best rolls here, gotta try it.",5.0
Came here with the gf and we ordered the house love boat for 2. It came with a specialty roll and a bunch of nigiri and some hand rolls.

"You're crazy if you don't give this place 5 stars.  Iron Chef House serves up the best sushi I've had since moving to New York.  I was hesitant to write this review because I didn't want it to get too crowded.  But, sushi lovers need to know about this place.  I recommend the 2011 roll if you like lobster.  I also recommend Hard Rock, Hana, Spicy Yellow Dragon rolls. The Nabeyaki Udon is also one of my go-to orders.  Wash it all down with some ice cold Sapporo.  And that's how it's done!

"We found this place randomly after taking skyline pics from the promenade. We were able to get last minute reservation on a Sunday night. The place was filled with happy customers.

If you like salmon and lemon, this will be your new favorite roll too.The rest of the menu is solid (to be fair I haven't tried any of the noodle dishes.. the sushi is just too good). I haven't had a bad roll and I have tried quite a few of them. I love the (seemingly senseless) names. 2005 roll anyone? The spicy crabmeat salad is excellent, their miso soup standard but delicious.

We usually order the chef's squid salad, the shrimp gyoza, the shrimp udon noodle soup and spicy tuna rolls which are amongst their most consistently delicious items.

"My boyfriend and I literally walked in to this restaurant about ten minutes after starting a conversation about what to grab for dinner. We were in Brooklyn for the weekend and were staying at the nearby Marriott so we really didn't have a clue where to go. We passed Iron Chef House and noticed it was PACKED. On a whim, we walked in, saw the pricing was good, and were seated within two minutes. Aside from some seriously rushed service, everything was outstanding. And honestly, once our orders were in, the hurried ""do you know what you want yet?"" attitude dissolved more into the ""let me clear that chopstick wrapper for you"" kind of vibe, which was nice. We collectively ordered:Miso soupVegetable Gyoza (dumplings)EdamameMonkey RollShogun RollSalmon SashimiThe vegetable gyoza and edamame were fine, and exactly what you'd expect. The miso soup was actually some of the best I've ever had - it was a bit stronger in flavor than what I've gotten at most places, and just really good. Both sushi rolls were great; I prefer the Monkey Roll but I would definitely re-order both. What really stood out was the sashimi, oh my god...I decided to order it rather than sushi on rice and am so glad I did. It was two pieces of the thickest, freshest salmon - to the point where I got three bites out of each, which essentially makes it a roll in my opinion. The fish was cut exceptionally well, was chilled and NOT room temp, and had a wonderful flavor that was not ""fishy"" at all.  It gave me one of those idiotic permasmiles and honestly, thinking about it now is giving me cravings for Japanese for dinner.Overall, definitely recommend, and very glad to have randomly walked past it.",4.0

"3.5 Stars. I was working in the Metrotech area and got really bored of Panera, Cafe Metro, and all the other lunch places in the area, so I decided to take a walk and give Iron Chef House a try. I'm happy that I did. It's a solid affordable lunch place minus the crowd from the courts and other businesses near the Marriott.The salmon teriyaki lunch special was only $7.35, and it came with rice or noodles, soup, and salad. The meal could have been better. The teriyaki sauce was watery, which I think came from the steamed bed of veggies under the salmon. The salmon itself was a little overcooked, but then again, at less than $8, I don't expect too much. I chose the noodle option, expecting udon noodles, and was surprised when I found spaghetti noodles instead. Regardless, they were dressed in a tasty sesame sauce and perfectly cooked.All in all, I would return. The service is fast, and the staff is friendly and polite. I called in my order for pick up, and after a 7 minute walk, my food was waiting for me. If it's a nice day, take the walk -  it is approximately 15 minutes from the courts and back, at a leisurely pace, and it's away from the hustle and bustle during lunch hour.",3.0
"Absolute favorite Japanese restaurant.Cozy little place with excellent service and excellent food.

They are nice, patient and know how to do their job. I haven't been there during an extremely busy time yet so I can't say anything about how they are then, but the countless number of times that I've gone, I have been met with excellent service.Their food is just amazing. You have to HAVE TO HAVE TO try the Monkey Roll (shrimp tempura with three blend spicy sauce) and the lobster roll, both amazing. You also need to try the grilled rice balls (filled with pork and bonito flakes).

Pros:Generous portions for the sushi and sashimi combination. I finished one and was stuffed! The best thing was the super white tuna. The Monkey Roll Special roll was very delicious as well. Not too spicy but very delectable. The vegetable gyoza had a nice crisp and the filling was delicious. Cons:The Tuna Tataki appetizer was mediocre and was swimming in the sauce.

I guarantee they will find exactly what you like. I only deal with Allison who is a waitress at Iron Chef. She is remarkable, and the friendliest person. If I tell her I'm in the mood for Tuna, she will not bring me out a regular plain tuna roll. What I would see on my plate would be something that looks amazing and tastes amazing.

The service is top notch and its an absolute pleasure to dine in and a breeze to order delivery. I loved their sister restaurant Jpan in park slope and was so excited to hear they were affiliated. ORDER THE MONKEY ROLL, you will not be disappointed. The Lotus root appetizer is also delicious!An even better perk: they do lunch specials on Saturday 12-4. Be a good Brooklyner and support Iron Chef! It will love you back!",5.0
"i dined here with a huge party on a Saturday night and I have to say the service was impeccable.  I was a tiny bit worried how they would handle us but everything was great.  The food was fantastic - a few things to note that really stood out:Raw beef appetizer - to die for!  almost ordered a 2nd portion but decided not to fill upYellowtail Jalapeno appetizer - outstanding!Fresh Scallop Sashimi was served with a cucumber disc, a very nice touch.i would definitely go back if i were in the neighborhood.",4.0
"Iron Chef is always a great experience. Everything on the menu is delicious. Their fish is always fresh, and they have new specials every week. My recommendation is have your waitress pick everything for you. Their staff will ask you the kinds of fish you like and really try to understand your pallet. I guarantee they will find exactly what you like. I only deal with Allison who is a waitress at Iron Chef. She is remarkable, and the friendliest person. If I tell her I'm in the mood for Tuna, she will not bring me out a regular plain tuna roll. What I would see on my plate would be something that looks amazing and tastes amazing. What I love here: Seafood soup or Spicy lobster soup. The Roti roll, and the hardrock roll. Always a five star experience.",5.0
"Delicious, good price. Service can be strange, they're either never at your table or there every 5 seconds. Overall, a favorite spot for sushi, udon and teriyaki. Teriyaki sauce is awesome.",4.0
"The seafood special soup was fantastic.  Other than that, I was not overly impressed by anything else we ate.  The place is tiny and service is pretty good.  I'm guessing there's a shortage of sushi joints in the area....lack of comparison is the only reason I could muster giving this place a 4 star rating.",3.0
"I've come here consistently in the past 5 years.  Great place for sushi!  Near the 2,3,4,5,R,A trains.  Restaurant could use an upgrade.  I typically order the sashimi platter, and just love how they put it together.  Their soups are always delicious too.  If you're in the area, and craving sushi - stop by.  You will enjoy the food for sure!",4.0

"Okay, simple enough:  If you are a newbie to Sushi (cmon! dont be shy) and dont eat much sashimi, this place is not too shabby.Three of us came here on a Saturday night.  We ordered the Duck Rolls and the Shrimp Dumplings for appetizer, and we all ordered Bento boxes (sashimi, shrimp, salmon).  I have to say, the duck rolls were interesting and tasty (altho I am not a big fan of ducks).  The Shrimp Dumplings were made from frozen packs, thus disappointing.  The bento boxes are just okayyyy.  I do agree with other people's comments on the non-freshness on the sashimi.......Oh, this place is run by Chinese (both waiting staff and kitchen staff)  How do I know?  I keep on hearing them!!!!!",3.0
"The four stars I'm giving Iron Chef House belongs almost solely to their monkey roll. I've both eaten here and gotten takeout a number of times. The food is fine -- really, the usual assortment of sushi and rolls. But the fried shrimp, avocado and saucy rice roll they call the Monkey is fantastic. I can't  get enough of them. Oooo! Ooooo! Aaaaah! Aaaaah! Pass the Monkey, please.",4.0
"Incredible. I love sushi, and have had a lot of different sushi from a lot of different places, from NYC to Boston, and the sushi here is probably the best I've had anywhere. The fish is fresh, and the special rolls mix different sauces and flavors together to create a truly unique taste and experience. The service is great and the choices are amazing. From salmon skin salad to fried calamari and duck appetizers all the way to the desserts, everything was stellar.",5.0

Overall, that, being my only complaint, it was still worth 5 stars. A good sushi spot!",5.0
"I love this place. When it comes to sushi, it's all about freshness and Iron Chef delivers. I have known the owners for quite sometime and they are all about quality and service. I have never had a bad meal here. I know that they get the first pick of the fresh fish deliveries going to Brooklyn. That means fresh sushi for you. They are creative in both presentation and decor.

I get cravings for it all the time now. Also, when talking to a few friends in the neighborhood, oddly enough, it turns out they all get cravings for this dish. It really is special. A bit busy, but amazing.I've since come back several times and tried various sushis. They have all been for the most part, very good, with the exception of the scallop - it was pretty terrible and rubbery.A word of warning.

They didn't just give me a small piece of salmon, no, they gave me a whole salmon steak. How often is it that you get served a dinner + sized meal at lunch prices in Cobble Hill? Really? I'm still amazed by the portion to price ratio. But size doesn't matter... taste, presentation, service... they matter. (Ha, who am I kidding - size is pretty important too!) The food not only was a ridiculous amount, but it tasted great too. The salmon teriyaki wasn't drowning in sauce and furthermore the salmon wasn't overcooked. The rice to sauce ratio was superb. The vegetables consisted of a nice assortment of asparagus, squash, carrots, broccoli, and celery. The salad's ginger dressing wasn't watery and the greens were fresh and crisp. The miso soup had chunks of tofu... ... this is exactly the lunch spot I was searching for when my company shipped me off to Downtown Brooklyn this past summer.

We sat at the corner table for privacy and got hot sake since it was freezing outside. Started with 3 diff appetizers. I""m more of a sashimi person, but this place is def good for their rolls, we then went out to order 4 more rolls. By the end we were both extremely full and still couldn't finish the plate, and we both eat ALOT.  We had another bottle of hot sake towards the end.

"this place is REALLLLLLLLLLLY small. i came here for sushi a while ago based off a recommendation from a friend who claimed they make lobster REALLLY GOOD. not quite the case. i'm also not a fan of places that go wild on creating these fancy pants rolls. if you are enjoying sushi, you should have it at it's natural state, with soy sauce and some wasabi.. not with all these funky sauce additions, flakes, and whatever else concoctions. i'm not against having it every so often but  truth be told these types of rolls were made to attract non japanese sushi eaters who aren't familiar or arent keen on eating sashimi at it's raw state, and to mask the discomfort. my experience here wasn't bad but it wasn't good. i have my special sushi joint that is wayyyy cheaper, and wayyy simpler. my kind of style.",3.0

Everything was packed up neatly and there was more than enough fresh wasabi and ginger. I had some of the most delicious miso soup ive ever eaten, and that's saying something for someone who eats sushi at very least once a week. We shared an incredible rainbow roll, along with a Spring Roll (tuna, salmon, white tuna, asparagus, green mix wrapped with pancake without rice) and one of the most AMAZING rolls I've ever had, a Spicy Phoenix Roll which had eel, tuna, and mango on the inside and topped with crab meat and mixed nuts. the mango added a fresh kick to the roll. delicious and unforgettable! we are still talking about that roll a week later. i cant wait to go and actually dine inside!",5.0

This Iron Chef wins in creativity, taste, and artful presentation!This is a fairly boutique-sized place, so it's a really cozy neighborhood spot.",5.0
Simply amazing!!! Everytime I've gone here they were dead on. The food was cooked perfect and awesome taste. Service was quick enough to run over for lunch from downtown Manhattan and back in an hour's time. Can't say enough about this great establishment.,4.0
"Just begin your experience by ordering the spicy tuna roll, it is fantastic! The wait staff are very attentive! I must try the dragoon roll on my next visit. The dining area is a little small but the size of the space adds to the overall charm.",4.0
"A coworker took me here for lunch. We ended up having a sushi bento box. Its not your typical box, it comes with noodles, 2 sumai, soup, salad and we asked for spicy tuna rolls. We were enjoying our good and all of a sudden a swarm of fruit flies start buzzing by us. It was gross. We quickly finished our food and ran out. This place would have gotten 5 stars, great spicy tuna and price, but I had to deduct some stars for the fruit flies. I'm glad it was at the end of our food.",3.0
"First time eating sushi in brooklyn. It's my bf's fav place so of course he had to take me here. Cute small japanese place. We sat at the corner table for privacy and got hot sake since it was freezing outside. Started with 3 diff appetizers. I""m more of a sashimi person, but this place is def good for their rolls, we then went out to order 4 more rolls. By the end we were both extremely full and still couldn't finish the plate, and we both eat ALOT.  We had another bottle of hot sake towards the end. Total bill he said was only 80 for the amt of food and alcohol we got. Pretty damn cheap. Love the waiters, very friendly and nice",4.0
"This is one of my favorite sushi places in the city! It's always fresh and delicious. (Note: I get rolls, not sashimi.) It's definitely good quality fish at reasonable prices, and though the space is a little tight, the atmosphere is pleasant and the service is always quick and friendly. I've never had food here that I didn't like.If you're going to go in the evening, it's worth calling for a reservation, as it's a small place that gets crowded.",5.0
"this place is REALLLLLLLLLLLY small. i came here for sushi a while ago based off a recommendation from a friend who claimed they make lobster REALLLY GOOD. not quite the case. i'm also not a fan of places that go wild on creating these fancy pants rolls. if you are enjoying sushi, you should have it at it's natural state, with soy sauce and some wasabi.. not with all these funky sauce additions, flakes, and whatever else concoctions. i'm not against having it every so often but  truth be told these types of rolls were made to attract non japanese sushi eaters who aren't familiar or arent keen on eating sashimi at it's raw state, and to mask the discomfort. my experience here wasn't bad but it wasn't good. i have my special sushi joint that is wayyyy cheaper, and wayyy simpler. my kind of style.",3.0

"The sushi was INCREDIBLE!! After a long day exploring the prospect park zoo, we were absolutely starving. It was a gorgeous day, so we decided to take our sushi to go and sit down by the promenade. Everything was packed up neatly and there was more than enough fresh wasabi and ginger. I had some of the most delicious miso soup ive ever eaten, and that's saying something for someone who eats sushi at very least once a week. We shared an incredible rainbow roll, along with a Spring Roll (tuna, salmon, white tuna, asparagus, green mix wrapped with pancake without rice) and one of the most AMAZING rolls I've ever had, a Spicy Phoenix Roll which had eel, tuna, and mango on the inside and topped with crab meat and mixed nuts. the mango added a fresh kick to the roll. delicious and unforgettable! we are still talking about that roll a week later. i cant wait to go and actually dine inside!",5.0

"Great lunch specials and nice ambiance! The rolls are super fresh and a good sized portion. I thought they would be tiny like any other lunch special roll, but they are eight yummy pieces each. The spicy rolls are actually not mayo based, so if you are ordering those, then just be aware of that. If you have a regular sized appetite, two rolls is more than enough. The salad is also nice, but the lettuce could be cut up a little better. The miso soup is extremely tasty too. I am not even a miso soup fan, I find it usually bland, but this had a little citrus kick to it. Definitely worth coming here for your lunch sushi fix if you are in the area!",4.0
"Great spot for good sushi. The rolls are creative and there are so many options on the menu that even if you don't like sushi, you can still dine there.

"Quite mediocre to say the least. Food is decently alright, nothing extravagant. There are several better suited restaurants serving better food.

"Went to Ozu twice in the past couple weeks, and I'm going to have to say that they now take the #1 spot for Japanese in the area. They make their rolls exactly the way I want it - a lot of fresh goodness inside without overloading on cheap rice. If you want to get your money's worth on rolls, definitely check out Ozu. $8 for 2 and $11 for 3 rolls for their lunch special. I also loved that they offered brown rice for free when I ordered their sashimi lunch special. I'm a convert!",4.0
"Food: Their appetizer specials of the day are surprisingly original and good here. Raw scallop with lemons were my favorite. No traditional sushi served here (you can get it, but I advise against it), as seen by the lengthy list of fusion rolls. Fish quality is good, not the best, no one is putting 5 star sashimi into a deep fried roll. However the rolls are well done. Firm, does not fall apart when picked up. They don't really sauce up the rolls, personally I like that, cuts out the fats (sauces are usually mayo based) that messes with the flavor of the fish. If ordering sashimi, the cuts are nice and healthy, they don't really scrimp on size. Can't speak about hot food here, never tried.Drink: Japanese beer and sake. Limited, low end selections.Service: Friendly. Crowd/Ambiance: Can get crowded but a table always seems to pop up pretty quick. Small restaurant, I like how the sushi bar is situated up top, overlooking the floor. The sushi chefs look like DJs overseeing a dance floor. I guess there is no real reason for me to like it besides my stupid imagination telling me so. Large curtain at front door does not block out the cold winter winds, so bear in mind when eating during winter time. Get a seat in the back.",4.0

"Just got off a flight from San Diego and I'm visiting NYC. It's about 8pm, and of course I'm starving. Out the door to the unexpected city that never sleeps! I'm already feeling a love that I once had with this city and it's all coming back! The air is crisp and as nuts as this sounds, I love the smell of a little dirt in the air, makes me feel like I'm at home (which I am)...... (San Diego is of course known for the fabulous weather, and of course, clean air.) I have a smile from ear to ear.After jumping from the N, to the 2-3 train, we have arrived in Brooklyn Heights. A Beautiful neighborhood. Destination ""Iron Chef House"". Small quaint sushi restaurant. The lighting is dim and specks of red lighting surrounding the restaurant. Hostess sat my girlfriend and I in probably the worst table. In the corner of course next to the bathroom. Which I'm totally for being near a bathroom since I am not shy to say but suffer from IBS. Once seated, and I'll add seated so close to the next couple over, you can hear every detail in there conversation. Ironically the girl sitting next to me was on the same flight as I was. Weird? No, that's nyc for ya. Anyway I ordered my usual miso soup with out the crunches and a Valentine roll and green tea. The food was ok, not the best. The price was average about $12. For the roll and 3 or 4 bucks for soup. No big deal. When we were finished our meal, another friend had joined us. Making it difficult because of the seating was so tight the couple next to us seemed a bit annoyed. Not my fault this place is so small. With three ladies catching up on some dirt, we were saying inappropriate things that offended them by the looks on there face. We were talking about normal things sex, sex, and what else sex. What else does a group of ladies honestly talk about when they go out to dinner? So I do apologize for that, but come on if you were looking for a date atmosphere this is not it.The price matched up to the service. I had to constantly look around for my little Asian waitress to even remember that we were stuck in the corner. Food came out quick. But then....oh no....ooh Christ! Thank god the bathroom was there... When I eat sushi and that happens, to me that mean's it was bad sushi, right?I've only gotten that a couple other times at Sushi Deli 1 in downtown SD. And there sushi is pretty cheep.In the end with my being happy that I was in NYC, I honestly didn't care really that the service kind of sucked, and my tummy ended up doing flips.

"While a blizzard hits brooklyn, I think everyone agrees it feels good to stay in warm and cozy and have someone else cook for you :-). I decided to order in sushi at a reasonable price. This was the quickest delivery service I've had in Brooklyn thus far. My sushi was here within 20-25 mins DURING the blizzard.

"No complaints here.  Good california rolls, good miso soup, fast delivery, decent prices.  Can't comment on other food (I always get the same thing) or waitstaff (I always get delivery).  But they've never given me underripe avocado or tough crabmeat or lousy miso.  Recommended.",4.0
"Had I known about this place when I lived in Manhattan I would've either moved to Brooklyn or made the trek a lot sooner, instead of eating at Nobu when and if we were ever lucky enough to get a table or be able to afford it.  Now I can satisfy my cravings for sushi on the regular since I live across the street and eat here several times a week.  Indeed, I just got a take-out Bento Box lunch special today which comes with soup and sald for $10.05!  You can't beat that!  I must say, though, their seared yellow tail appetizer is melt in your mouth fantastic and my go-to dinner is either the dinner combination box for under $20 (which I can never finish no matter how hard I try) or the Monkey roll.  The wait-staff is always pleasant as are the chefs.  I can't believe a previous commenter said something about not getting thrown something for free after years of service.  At these prices, do you really need to?  You're getting a steal of a deal.  My husband and I regularly have lunch here together and our bill is always under $25 with the lunch specials.  Can't beat the price, the quality, or the coziness.  When we were thinking about moving we looked at each other and said:  can't live without Iron Chef House (or Mister Video next door).",5.0

The seared yellowtail platter is a delicious appetizer with ginger, garlic and a lemon/ponzu sauce.  Yummy. Also surprisingly good is the eel fried rice.  The fish, overall was extremely fresh.  If you are particular about the sushi rice, however, this was average in my opinion -- somewhat too overcooked (mushy rather than the optimum sticky but each grain still maintains its integrity) and it also was lacking the traditional rice wine vinegar, which is part of what I love about the plain sushi experience.   Tuna sashimi was excellent.  The environment is adorable, comfortable, social and modern. A great neighborhood place if you live nearby or find yourself in the area and craving sushi.  If you're going out in DUMBO, say, and you want sushi...go here.  Do NOT go to the Miso place in DUMBO...it's gross.So, my review amounts to: go here if you're in the area and want a great vibe, creative and unique rolls and fresh fish.  If you're looking for impeccable quality of ingredients and preparation other than the fish alone, you can do better in this sushi mecca that is NYC.",3.0
"Let me start by saying that I used to love this place.  Love might even be an understatement.  For about an eighteen month period, my fiance and I ate or ordered in from Iron chef at least once a week, sometimes more.  Snowstorm causes the office to be closed the following day?  Put on your boots, we're trekking to Iron Chef in 10 inches of snow and enjoying $5 glasses of wine with ridiculously (sometimes dangerously) generous pours.  Something happened though.  After a while, it seemed like a lot of the staff left and was replaced by people who just didn't seem to care.  We'd wait 10 minutes for soy sauce only to give up and just ask the table next to us if we can bum theirs.  Then another table would ask us for ours.  We also noticed the quality went down.  The rolls started getting mushy.  Unappetizingly so.  The funny thing is, I also work in the neighborhood and my co-workers and I have come here a few times for lunch.  Lunch is still pretty good.  Good service, good sushi.  I told my fiance about this  and he agreed to give it another shot.  We ordered takeout for dinner.  Picked it up on time and ate it almost immediately after getting home.  I had to spit a piece of sushi into a napkin.  I don't know why there is such a discrepency between the quality of their lunch vs. the quality of their dinner.  I'll still go for lunch a few times a year if my co-workers or friends who work nearby want to go.  I went vegetarian eight months ago so I can no longer comment on the quality of their fish, but  their veggie rolls are very good.  Especially their spicy mixed veggie.  My fiance, however, is done.  In my opinion, Ozu and Tenda are much more consistent in their quality and service.",3.0

The menus are dirty and worn down. The waiters are rude and it takes forever for you to get what you ordered. When I asked the waitress that we've been waiting for our main course for 15 minutes, she said ""everyone is waiting for their food, sorry its' a little crazy tonight!"". And the restaurant was only 2/3 full! Additionally, there were too many mosquitos flying around us and our food and we were bitten several times by the mosquitos. Again we told one of the waitresses about it and she said ""I know, it's because the doors are open!"" These guys do not even know how to talk to their customers. I'll never go there again and would recommend you to only order to go if you want to try their food.",1.0
"Everything I've had here has been wonderful. I LOVE their chirashi and sushi/sashimi meals. This place is actually priced more cheaply than I would expect for the quality. The salmon here is melt in your mouth delicious, which is my test for great sashimi. By far the best sushi place in the heights.",5.0
"the exterior of this place is sort of deceiving. given its unremarkable signage and the fact that it's in an area that isn't exactly, how shall I put it, ""spectacular"" as far as chow goes, I was expecting this place to be pretty divey. when I decided on takeout the other night and ended up giving this place a try, I was surprised to walk in and find a nice and even somewhat hip sushi place. not to mention that it was pretty packed for a weeknight.the sushi I ordered was fresh, and the steamed pork dumplings were sufficiently tasty. I'd definitely go there again.",3.0
"Not only are the prices reasonable, but the food here is great. I especially love the dressing they put on the salad. It's some sort of carroty-ginger concoction that is out of this world. If I could have done so without making a scene, I would have licked the salad bowl clean!",4.0
"For Brooklyn heights this place is great. The sushi is always fresh and delicious, at times the rice is not perfect. I love the Osaka roll. Also the green tea ice cream and fried banana is bangin. The place has a great vibe, very comfortable, great waitresses and a local crowd.",4.0
"Small and cozy and oh so good!  The fish is fresh, portions are generous and food presentation is done well too.  Huge selection of specialty rolls, for instance, a ""special"" spicy tuna roll which was topped off with tempura flakes.   The prices at Iron Chef House are insanely low and comparable to many other sushi joints in the Brooklyn Heights/Carroll Gardens area which lag far behind Iron Chef House in terms of quality and restaurant ambiance.   I forgot how good this place is until I came here this past weekend.  Now I  won't go anywhere else  in the Heights for sushi.",5.0
"This place is pretty disgusting actually, so I am a bit surprised by the ratings. Sushi Gallery on the same street, but closer to the subway is cheaper and way better. At the Iron Chef, the quality of the fish used for sushi and sashimi is quite low, as is the quality of the rice. moreover, the noodles taste like cheap chinese food from the cart. I've given them a few tries, and each time the food was on the low side of mediocre.",1.0
"Amazing amazing amazing amazing sushi and such a cute little place (keyword little)  I'm not a huge guy, but I definitely bump shoulders when going in here, but for the sushi that's not a problem at all.  For 7 dollars you can get 2 rolls, and tea which is a great deal, and it's oh so fresh.  If you love sushi come here, you won't regret it.*note  Like other restaurants they close mid day (like 2) and open again at 4, so make sure you call and verify they will be open before you make the hike.",5.0
"The best sushi restaurant in Brooklyn. They always have fresh and new rolls that make you return time and again. If you like eel please don't deprive yourself of their eel fried rice! It is an absolute must, the service is always impeccable and decor soothing to the eyes and palate.Don't  forget to order the Red bean fried ice cream for dessert.",5.0

"I fear that I will spend the rest of my life searching for sushi as good as that at Iron Chef House.  I used to live right around the corner from this cozy sushi shop and visiting here regularly was like getting my weekly sushi vitamins.  Although they do carry delicious nigiri that is always extremely fresh, the reason to come here is the taste explosion that results from their creative sushi rolls.  I have never found anything that danced such a tantalizing tango upon my palate.  Anything on their daily specials list can be expected to be fantastic.  There are unique sauces and creative additions like toppings of dried cranberry and crushed pecans, which sounds bizarre but actually is spectacular.  The seared hamachi is likely my favorite dish, but really so many make my mouth water as I sit here on the other side of the country basking in memories.  Not only do I love the meal, but the service is always warm and friendly.  Even now when my visits are reduced to twice a year, due to my relocation to California, instead of once a week the waitresses still greet me and ask about my new life out west and chat warmly. This is the kind of place where I almost desire to give it a horrible review so that I could keep it a somewhat hidden treasure, but I suppose since I cannot visit it so much myself spreading the wealth is not such a bad idea.",5.0
"Iron Chef House is good neighborhood sushi place that knows exactly how to make the best product at a certain price point.  It's not out of this world, but it's also not terrible, like the 2 other sushi possibilities in the immediate area.  This is consistently good fish at a reasonable price.",4.0
"A great sushi joint....nice menu, new specials daily, cute and friendly service. Its always crowded and thats a good sign, meaning the fish is fresh",4.0
"By far, this was one of my best sushi experiences ever.It's sometimes hard to compare sushi places because most average sushi is more or less the same, but at Iron Chef you get amazingly fresh and delicious sushi for an amazing deal.  My friend and I both got the sashimi lunch special recently.  $8.50!  I mean... seriously?!  The other time I was there I went with a few rolls and I loved every minute of it.The place itself is also beautifully decorated, and I would rate their bathroom one of the nicest ever... which is sort of a weird compliment.  Be warned though, apparently girls don't have the same admiration for a urinal in a unisex bathroom.The staff was friendly, although you might feel a little rushed if you go during lunch because the place definitely fills up quickly and they obviously don't want to keep people waiting for a seat.I would go back in a heartbeat and brings friends.",5.0
"my sushi place - constantly crave it.  for some reason it seems to taste better when I eat at the restaurant versus delivery, but maybe that's b/c of the cool decor and plates and serving dishes.  Love their veggie rolls all the time (sweet potato and avocado) and spicy tuna.  Seaweed salad is good, but small.  But do NOT let them convince you to get the dinosaur egg appetizer.  Such a waste that was.  Gotta stick to what you know!!  The service is whatever and some speak English better than others...",4.0
"I LOVE THIS PLACE!!!!!!!  The food is awesome.. it's a small restaurant, but the food and service truly make up for it.  I think small groups can fit there, I've been with a group of like 6 of us.  I can tell you that you WON't Regret going to this place to eat.. hands down the best Sushi/Rolls I've ever had.  The staff is attentive and the place is always neat/clean.",5.0
I live just a block away and this is my favorite Japanese restaurant. Highly recommended is the white Tuna which is not available else where. If you have 3 or 4 people order their buffet style Sushi/Sashimi boat. Can't go wrong. Nice assortments and reasonably priced. The restaurant is somewhat small but intimate. Reservation recommended especially for dinner. Can be very busy!,5.0
"Their fish was well selected, fresh and melts-in your-mouth quality. Highlights were the Tuna Name (Seared tuna morsels with a maybe too sweet sauce, but still sublime; and an inventive ""sushi"" spring roll. Sashimi maybe a better bet than sushi here; next time I would try the chirashi. The best was wild-caught salmon sashimi--a special of the day, and not unreasonably expensive . The Curry Udon soup was tasty and satisfying but not superb. A white seaweed sushi was very good. They will make any rolls you request--we wanted a scallop roll: they made a simple one with avocado that was very good. A special ""Suge roll"" had perhaps a little too much going on as noted by another reviewer. We had to wait a bit outside on a Sunday evening. Its not a place to sit at the sushi bar and interact with the chefs--this is in my experience the best way to get the best cuts. They are visible but on a high platform,--there is no bar to sit at. All-in all, its more than the usual neighborhood place because of the quality of the fish.  The service was fine. Try the Tuna Name and look out for what Sashimi they have on special.",4.0
