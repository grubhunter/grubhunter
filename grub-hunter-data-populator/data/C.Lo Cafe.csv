"As someone who got priced out of Crown Heights ($3k/month, can you believe it?) I know how ""gentrification"" can be a double edged sword.  However, there is one effect that goes hand-in-hand (hand-in-mouth?) with a neighborhood in an upswing that makes it all worth while: The plethora of excellent fun, trendy brunch places that inevitably follow!You know the type of spot.  The food is fresh and eclectic, mirroring the fresh and eclectic NYC clientele, comprised of hipsters, musicians, bankers, artists, political activists, all melded in one big New York City melting pot.   The neighborhood waitresses know the neighborhood locals yet welcome first time comers because they know that most of the people that come are here because of the restaurant's reputation via ""word of mouth"".  They tend to be smaller than demand dictates, which means they tend to have a very relaxed mellow vibe, but sometimes with wait lines (which makes scoring a table all worth while!)New York City has become a cottage industry of hip knock-your-socks-off cafes / brunch spots, and I for one am a sucker for these places.  Well, this 5-star rating is here to tell you that C.Lo Cafe is one of these places!I ordered the C.Lo burger.  I gotta say, I asked for medium rare, and that's exactly what I got.  Medium rare.  I've seen world-class steakhouses like Peter Luger's screw that up.  Kudos to you, C.Lo!  The patty was bigger than I was expecting, and unlike some of the crappy places popping up in NYC, you don't even have to pay extra for lettuce and tomato here.  This is not the throwaway burger you see in diners.  You order it because it's damned good burger, not because you're ordering a burger by default.My baby ordered guacamole with chips (which I shared) and has been raving about it ever since.  Obviously made to order, it was incredibly fresh and vibrant with fresh ingredients.  The tortilla chips were amazing My wife ordered the brunch tostada, and when the plate came out, I was instantly jealous (I'm ordering it the next time we come here).All in all, good food, wonderful staff, relaxed NYC vibe.  This place is definitely ""as good as it gets.""   Five stars.",5.0
"When you are hungover a f8ck and David, saying not a word, plops a jar of pickle juice on the bar for you to chug. This place is saturated in family vibes and good food. Best cafe on the block.",5.0
I have been here a few times because I live in the area and it is a really solid quick brunch place. I have had the Brunch Tostados and the House Brunch. They really accomodating with adding extras. I really like their pico de gallo and I always get it on the side.My boyfriend always has the burger and he really enjoys it. The service is pretty consistent but it is really small so it fills up fast. Sitting by the window sucks in the mid-morning because it tends to be a bit hot and too much light. The cocktails are also really great. They are always adding and subtracting from the menu so we go back every so often to see what's new.,4.0
I was happy with this place. I live not to far and met a friend for brunch. I got the yogurt and berries and I was surprise that is was not too expensive. staff is friendly and service quick!I might come back to try more on their menu because everything looked delicious!,3.0
"i am in love this place! i know it might be a little premature since I've only been here once but it will definitely not be the last. Like a past reviewer stated a little part of me doesnt want to give this place a review since i want it to be a hidden gem forever.the place seats around 20 people and is very charming and cute. Their menu is ON POINT! They have brunch items and lunch/dinner items all at a reasonable price! I got the dulce grilled cheese: ricotta, fresh berries with strawberry jam spread. It was amazing and all for 7$. My friend got the breakfast bowl which has greek yogurt, fruit and granola also 7$. Im eager to try everything else on the menu without long lines and wait time. lolAside from an amazing menu they also have a great drink selection. Their cocktails are unique and flavorful, teas and lemonades are flavorful and coffee is from toby's estate and at a much more reasonable price.",5.0
"Came here for a Sunday brunch and instantly fell in love with the place. The cafe's interior is warm and welcoming. Cute flowers on every table. There are also a few tree stumps outside for seating. Very affordable menu items and an excellent selection for any occasion. The staff is also friendly and helpful. Our waitress gave us recommendations and let us know the selection of the day. We decided to try the new Apple Cider Sangria ($8), the herb lemonade ($3), the yogurt bowl ($7) and dulce grilled cheese ($7). The apple cider sangria is an interesting fall twist of the typical sangria. The herb lemonade has a bit of thyme and their house made lemonade. I enjoyed the yogurt bowl a lot, which had two scoops of deceiving greek yogurt haha. Perfect amount of sweetness from the honey as well. I was very pleased with the dulce grilled cheese. I wasn't sure what to expect at first but the grilled cheese was probably the best part of our brunch. The toasty, warm bread, sweet strawberry jam oozing from the sides, fresh ricotta and berries. I will definitely revisit for another brunch to try more food items. Or maybe even stop by for some Toby's Estate coffee.",5.0
"A very charming new cafe. All the staff here are so welcoming and friendly! Starting my morning off here set a great tone for the rest of the day. Definitely a perfect slow, sunny, lounge-y Saturday/Sunday morning vibe, but I'd wish to sit here any day of the week ;] They have a very wide selection of bagels, bagel sandwiches, scones, muffins, pastries, and other baked goods at the counter. Of course, when the sign outside boasts ""Toby's Estate coffee"", you know they will serve you up a spectacular cup of coffee from one of Brooklyn's best coffee houses. They also have an entire sit-down brunch and lunch menu which includes three, yes you read that right, THREE different kinds of Avocado Toast. I got the one that was topped with olive oil, hard-boiled egg, and black sesame seeds, and it was phenomenal. I can't believe I've never thought to sprinkle black sesame seeds on avocado mash before, because the texture and flavor contrasts are insane. The avocado toast itself was a slice of loaf bread and was toasted to a level just shy of crunchy. My friends ordered the tostadas and organic eggs and everything was delicious and perfectly portioned. Color me impressed! Will definitely come back.",5.0
"Cocktails were V AMAZING. But my brunch wasn't too great... My avocado had a lot of brown spots, my potatoes weren't freshly made and I could tell they had been microwaved. Which wasn't cool. I'll be going back for cocktails and their turmeric margarita. Which was incredible.",3.0
This is my favorite easy brunch spot. Its so delicious and fresh. The atmosphere is quiet and chill which makes for a relaxing breakfast.I LOVE IT,5.0
"Really liked this place. A bit of a hipster vibe, but the food was really good, the service was friendly and excellent, and the eclectic music kind of softened the edge of hipsterness - they don't take themselves too seriously.We had shrimp dobladas and the baked eggs. For the eggs you can choose between two toppings: cheddar and bacon, or feta, tomato salsa, and oregano. I asked them if they could do both in one and they were very totally accommodating. It was a delicious combination and I'd totally recommend it! My sister said the shrimp dobladas were 10/10.Also, the cold brew was in my opinion perfect. There is nothing at all I would have changed about the flavour.Would definitely recommend this place. My compliments to the waitress and the chef!",5.0
"Hidden gem. Didn't even want to write a review because I don't want anything to change. Sometimes w success, business owners get an ego.

"We love C Lo Cafe!! So glad it's right down the street, we go here multiple times a week. It's adorable inside and the food is very consistently delicious. The lox toast is phenomenal and light; the avocado toast is delicious and healthy; the veggie chili warmed my heart up! And there are tons of other things on the menu I'm dying to try. I highly recommend this spot for a quiet easy breakfast spot. It's small inside... Only seats about 30 people, so be prepared to get cozy. Thanks C Lo for healthy and love-filled food!",5.0
"This place is awesome, you feel instantly super comfy, there is a bright light and staff is friendly and happy to serve you.the best over here is their iced coffee, strong and intense. You can ask for coconut crops in it or on the side.the banana bread is delicious, tasty and fresh.Then for the food I always try something new and I've never been disappointed. to conclude its a lovely local cafe brunch place where you can easly stop by for a nice brunch or to grab a good cafe.",5.0
"The food here is consistently good. Sometimes it's actively excellent. It's charming and a nice local lunch spot, BUT...Why three stars? The service is frequently lacking. The lunchtime server is incredibly sweet, but often gets the order wrong & never checks back on the table after food is dropped off. And getting the bill at the end is always a challenge.Do I think this is enough to skip this spot? No, but it makes me hesitate sometimes, and keeps the place from being much, much better. Still, it's a bummer when you have to decide between eating an incorrect order & not getting service vs. simply going somewhere else. My hope is the owners see this review to make some basic, much-needed service improvements (and getting a better ranking).Totally side note: they should offer fries, and a few more sides on the menu, even as an add-on. It would be nice to go with their great pork sandwich, in particular.",3.0
"I came here for Sunday brunch. There were no lines or anything. I had the baked eggs with sweet potato the smoked salmon bagel, and a bloody mary. The bagel was really good quality.

I am soooo looking forward to me next visit here.",5.0
"This spot is so cute and in the heart of Williamsburg ! I'm sure if I tried more things I could give it a 5 star. I wasn't too hungry so I got the yogurt,fruit, and granola bowl. The yogurt was seriously so delicious, extremely thick. Think cream cheese texture. I shared a scone with my friend and it was really bad, no flavor/dry. They don't make the scones there so it's not their fault. But the drinks and food looked amazing ! Would definitely come back to try more things!",4.0

"Great service and the food is well presented and extremely tasty. Have been twice, once for dinner and once for brunch and both were exceptional and affordable. Carnitas are highly recommended for dinner and breakfast tostadas are to die for.",5.0
I've been here multiple times for dinner and it does not disappoint! I love the atmosphere and the folks that work here are so friendly. Of course the food is delicious and they have the perfect portions. I have even stopped in for a latte to go and it's the best in the neighborhood. This place is the perfect addition to the neighborhood.,5.0
