"Sooooo I need to give this place more stars but I cant. Yelp, step it up. Thanks.So I went to Soco on Easter sunday (Oddly enough, came in March and my birthday wknd.) so the place was packed like crazy and the hostess told my girlfriend and I that the wait would be 45 minutes. Seeing as how our activity for the day wasnt slated to start for a few hours, we just relaxed.I checked the reviews for a place a few doors down, just to give an alternative option in case my woman became a monster which she tends to do if she doesn't in a timely fashion. Lol. The reviews were horrible and we decided to stay right where we were and besides the weather was nice and the sitting area wasn't crowded at the moment. We were seated, water was brought to our table after about 10 minutes. I didn't notice until my girl said something but there was only one waiter for the brunch hours. I'm sure they didn't plan on it happening this way but it is what it is. Just gotta roll with the punches, so for that purpose, we didn't trip.Appetizer: We ordered the smoked vegetable flatbread and that thing was delicious. The portion was big enough for us two to share versus other establishments where the apps are usually two little things of whatever was ordered. That app kept us busy until our meals came. It was great, delicious and fresh! Entrees: I had the blackened salmon with mashed yams and garlic tossed string beans. My girlfriend had the strawberry shortcake french toast (shes a sucker for strawberry short cake anything. When i read some of the items to her when we were in the car and I mentioned that, she made a sound that was borderline X-rated. Lol). For our sides, we had cornbread and mac & cheese. Holy shit! From the first bite of my salmon and her first of the french toast, we were on another planet! The food was fresh, hot, flavourful, delicious. Awww man! I knew once i looked across the table, she was silently telling me that we had to come back to this place! The cornbread, was light, subtly sweet and mouthwatering. The mac &cheese, was, as my girl would say ""delicious as fuck"". The portions were more than enough, which is different when it comes to ""nice restaurants"".  Especially in a place like Brooklyn these days where its becoming a food hub like no other. You're paying fancy shmancy prices for two little spot on the plate. You're paying for presentation more than the food itself. At SocoBk, your getting your belly full and your eyes are also being satisfied. Outside of the one waiter being utilized for the entire restaurant (At least that's what it looked like to us. We could've been wrong.), the only other issue we had is when the bill came to the table. Our bill was higher than we imagined it to be and after dissecting it long enough, we figured what happened. The sides were not included in the meal. In other words, we paid for each side $5 and $10 for the cornbread and mac and cheese, respectively. So when we got our bill and saw a total of $90+ for two ppl and no alcoholic beverages were purchased, we were startled. Honestly, we couldn't be mad. We didn't pay attention to the menu and i'm sure that has happened to many ppl before. We just know what to expect next time we visit Soco and oh, we have to budget for that place. Lol. All in all, it was a great experience. Will be back again once i get my money up. Lol",5.0
"My second time at Soco, which was for lunch (first time for dinner which wasn't bad)... I had the kale salad w/cornbread croutons and the que wings, while hone had the shrimp po' boy, and mac n' cheese which we doused with (2) bottles of Pellegrino. Enjoyed the nice and quiet lunch-time atmosphere just before the happy hour rush. But (Note to self...) must return for the happy hour drink specials next go round (Soco's mixed drinks are slammin', i.e. wild strawberry moonshine), as well as experiencing the brunch menu on the weekend.All in all... Soco is a cool spot and appears to have improved. But timing is everything, since it can get quite hectic depending on the hour and vibe your seeking for the moment.",4.0
"I recently visited New Orleans, and I must admit that the food here was better than any of the southern cooking or the cajun/creole that I tried in New Orleans. We started with the Mac n cheese. It was the best Mac n cheese that I've ever had. The top was super crispy. I know how difficult it is to bake a perfect crisp on Mac n cheese, so I must commend SoCo for that. Under the crisp, the interior had a perfect balance of cheesy and gooeyness. The cheese was delicious. I think the cheese was a blend, but I can say for sure; nevertheless, it was delicious and turned out creamy. The macaroni itself was the real deal - not some dingy elbows. The Mac n cheese is very filling; I would have been content simply sharing it without ordering anything else.For my main course, I had the sausage and grits. I guarantee these grits will convert anyone into a grits lover. They are so rich and creamy. They're made with a lobster broth which adds a lot of flavor. These were by far the best grits I've had. The grits were topped with andouille sausage, eggs, and some micro leaves (I believe cilantro). I had my eggs sunny side up so that the yolk could spill onto the grits. Altogether, it was a wonderfully savory dish.The service was outstanding. The bartenders here are some of the best I've seen. Soco is truly one of Brooklyn's best restaurants.",5.0
"I had the most wonderful lunch here the other day. I was warmly greeted and let the sweet sounds of 90's r&b encamp all around me. Our server didn't miss a beat he warm without being too overbearing or intrusive. In essence he was the perfect waiter. Now here's where the gates of heaven opened up on this Friday afternoon! The FOOD!!! I can honestly say I wasn't expecting it to be as spectacular as it was! It definitely blew my expectations out of the water. First I had the quinoa salad with fried green tomato slices on top! This was thee most delicious salad I have ever had! It was perfectly balanced and the tomatoes were not greasy at all! This was the perfect appetizer and got me super excited for the next part of the meal and Soco did not disappoint.   The chicken and red velvet waffle was literally the most amazing thing I've had in a while! The waffle wasn't overly sweet, it was the perfect companion for the chicken. Now this chicken is fried chicken done right! Seasoned through out, crispy on the outside and so juicy on the inside! Did I mention it's organic?!! I know right! As if it couldn't get any better!!! I haven't stopped raving about this place since my visit! Can't wait to round up a crew and head over there again to indulge and you should do the same!!! Thank you Soco for providing a great meal and atmosphere to match!",5.0
"Ahhhh this place....My date found it, and we went in. it wasn't busy at all, so we were seated right away. The ambiance is great in here.MUSIC!!! I LOVE IT! whatever playlist they have playing, kudos to who ever compiled it. They had some great R&B song playing. the staff was attentive.The menu isn't huge. But the food is good, and very filling.I had the blackened salmon with sweet potato mash, and cornbread. the cornbread was VERY good. Also the butter that comes with them is sweet, and delicious. I like the fact that they give you an option for tap or bottled water. The macaroni and cheese was very... I think on the dry side. It didn't taste bad, but I felt it was missing SOMETHING. It was very clear to me that they used parmesan cheese. After adding hot sauce, it tasted better to me.My date ordered the red velvet chicken and waffles. Let me tell you, This waffle was Delicious! seriously, I could have just eaten that. The chicken, I have tasted better friend chicken, but it was still good. Me personally, I would have appreciated the dish more if the chicken was boneless. Our server was very attentive, and helpful. They were happy to see I used yelp to check into their establishment, and I even used a deal and got my cornbread for free (yelping perks, YES!)My date and I sat for a long time, and didn't feel rushed to leave. we were left alone after the bill was taken care of.Emphasis on how much I loved the music! I couldn't even look at the dessert menu because I was sooo full.",5.0
"They tried to sit us right next to the revolving kitchen door (no way)... So then me and my party sat by the bar. It took forever to grab someone's attention while it was at least five guys behind the bar. There was only one guy making all the drinks while everyone was doing absolutely nothing back there. We finally got our drinks. I asked for a caramel martini and was served something totally different. Oh he let me know there was no caramel after my drink was served. He also stated while serving our drinks that the kitchen was closed. So we couldn't order appetizers, something the hostess should have stated before we were seated. Will not be revisiting here ever again. Most restaurants in Brooklyn start of grand and get lazy with the food and service after a few years of business.",1.0
"Good food, good vibes an all around good place.  We arrived on Sunday 6ish and had to wait about 40 mins for a table--the place was packed to the rafters.  Once seated our server was very prompt with taking our orders. We tried the blackened salmon and F-QUE wings and the Mac & cheese.  With a Yelp check in we got a free order of cornbread.  The salmon was fresh and broiled perfectly.  The blend of Cajun spices was nicely balanced and complimented the fish well.  Portion sizes were healthy especially the Mac & cheese portion.  It came baked into its own mini skillet. One portion could easily serve 2-3 people as a side.  The roux used for the Mac and cheese was flavored with a hint of bay leaf and garlic--nice touch.  The consistency of the sauce was slightly loose which let you enjoy the gooey cheese sauce. Cavatappi pasta is used for the Mac & cheese which is an excellent choice as it holds the sauce much better than regular elbow macaroni. The wings were meaty and coated in a peppery sauce.  We were given dipping sauces for the wings but they were so well seasoned we didn't need them.  For our drinks we tried the hibiscus margarita which was very a refreshing an summery drink.  As mentioned every table was occupied during our visit yet our server was pretty prompt and our wait time for food was not too bad given the wait times.  We did notice the crowd started to thin out around 7:30 so next time we will probably plan to dine later.",5.0
"We came here on a Saturday afternoon and the wait was about 45 mins to an hour. They will send a text to let you know your table is ready, which is great. The staff were nice, friendly and the food was mmm delicious! We had the F-Que wings, Mac and cheese, buttermilk chicken and waffles and gumbo (which was ok). All of the above minus the gumbo is a must try!! The red velvet waffles was not sweet which was a plus. The chicken was crispy, a hint of spicy and didn't even taste oily like how fried food usually would be.The F-Que wings came with tzatiki dip but it tastes fine without it.Mac and cheese!!! I am not even a fan of Mac & cheese but I had to try it. I love the top part and ate most of it.  Since we had leftover, I took it home and my brother ate it the next day. He said ""it was good!"" Btw, don't forget to check in for free cornbread!",5.0
I visited this establishment on Thursday with my sister and cousin. This is my 3rd time visiting SoCo and they never cease to amaze me. I ordered the skirt steak and it was very tasty. The steak was cooked well and it was tender. My cousin ordered their signature dish the red velvet waffle and fried chicken. The waffle tastes very good you don't even need syrup. I will continue to visit SoCo and tell all of my friends about this lovely place.,5.0
"Southern Comfort is exactly what you will get at SoCo!Came here for Brunch and enjoyed it. I arrived around noon and the place was already full. By the time I left this place was packed. I did not have to wait for a table but had I arrived 30 minutes later I'm sure that I would have had to wait. I did not have a reservation but having one during those prime hours would be helpful.I ordered the Red Velvet Waffle with the Buttermilk Chicken. The dish was delicious!!! I like waffles but that is not something that I ever really order at a restaurant. This was the best waffle that I have ever had in my life, definitely memorable. The chicken was delicious as well. I was very impressed with this dish. Since I'm greedy I decided to also order the Mac'n cheese which was very good as well. The mac n' cheese is a big portion and its very very rich so you can share this. Although it was delicious I couldn't eat too much of it because it was so cheesy and extremely  filling. I also ordered the home fries. The home fries were seasoned well but I would definitely pass on that next time. Last but not least I received the free corn bread for checking in. The corn bread was good as well. We definitely ordered a lot for just 2 people but it was nice to try a few different things. I would highly recommend coming here! I can't wait to come back!",5.0
"I've been avoiding coming here because restaurants with a lot of hype always leave me with high expectation and inevitable disappointment. This wasn't the case for Soco. I was pleasantly surprised. The food was great, the decor was nice, the staff was friendly. The food did take a little long to come out. It was about a 30 minute wait for 2 entrees and a side. It was early in the afternoon and the restaurant almost empty so I had to knock off a star for that.I had their famous chicken and waffles. The chicken was tender and juicy, the waffle was the right amount of sweet on its own. I tried with syrup just to see how it would taste and it was way too sweet for me. I suggest trying it without the syrup first. The portion size was a little on the smaller side so if you're looking for a hefty entree, this isn't it. My girlfriend got the Soul Fried Chicken Sandwich with Garlic Dusted Fries. She loved everything about it. The portion size was great. The real star was the Mac And Cheese. WOW! I don't know who's grandmother they have locked up in the basement making this Mac and Cheese but bless her soul. One of the best Mac and Cheese's I've ever had. Portion size was great on this one too. I'll definitely be back here.",4.0
"Trekked all the way out to Brooklyn just to try the red velvet chicken & waffles. Soco's portions are huge! Although the chicken & waffles were good, I would recommend sharing this dish as the waffle is heavy, making it difficult to finish by yourself. The chicken wasn't the best fried chicken I've had (it was kind of soggy), but the uniqueness of the waffle made up for the chicken. My friends and I also split the mac & cheese, which was by far the best mac & cheese I've had! I'm not even a mac & cheese fan, but I couldn't stop eating this dish. Crunchy on top, but soft gooey pasta inside. This also looks like a small portion, but even with 3 people, we were struggling to finish this dish as well. Make sure you check in for free cornbread - it says 1 piece per entree, but the waiter actually gave us an entire plate of corn bread for our whole table!",3.0
This spot was everything I was looking for and more. I don't like those 2 seater tables in the middle of the floor. We sat there first and quickly asked to move to a more cozy spot. After all it was date night with hunny! But I noticed every couple that came in asked to move from those tables. But as far as food and staff it was amazing and I will definitely return. Xoxo,5.0
"The ambiance is really nice. It is good for a Girls dinner or A dinner date with your boo. They have an unique bathroom set and a full body mirror  The food was amazing!

"TERRIBLE SERVICE!!! Dinner started out great. 1/2 way through dinner lights went out and restaurant became smokey.  No one ever came over to tell us what was going on. When we asked we were told a circuit was down. Asked for the check because at this point everyone's eyes were burning. When check finally came we were told we HAD to pay cash because they couldn't swipe any credit cards due to the system being down. When my husband spoke to the manager to tell him we didn't have enough money to give our waitress a proper tip he was told, with quite a bit of attitude, that he had to go to the ATM. No I'm sorry for the inconvenience, just a lot of bad attitude.  So not only was our dinner cut short due to the smoke and lack of lights, now everyone in our party stinks of smoke!This was on of our favorite spots for fried chicken and waffles but we WILL NEVER SET FOOT IN THIS PLACE AGAIN!!!",1.0
"Ok first I will discuss the bad moment that we had at this place. My sister made reservations for last Saturday's birthday dinner for 8 pm and was told that if all 9 people do not show up by 8..we would lose our spot, be on a waiting list and might be sitting by 10:30 pm. So make sure you get there on time. Everyone had arrived by 7:30 pm and we still had to wait 30 minutes in the front area where few seats were available. The waiting area should have been bigger and we felt bad standing next to two couples sitting and eating up a storm. Not bad for having one bad moment, right?As for the highlights..some of us had the Mardi Gras cocktail with was really good. Why not drink while waiting for a seat, right? In terms of appetizers..we had short rib pizza and the Carolina Shrimp rolls (I'm not a sushi person, but I did enjoy the rolls than the short rib pizza). I had ordered the molasses braised short ribs with broccoli (meat was very tender), wifey had the fried chicken with red velvet waffle (the waffle was sweet enough that she didn't need to add the syrup and the chicken was well fried  and full of flavor), pops had blackened salmon and a relative had the Herb Marinated Skirt Steak with Sautéed Collards, Roasted Potatoes, Chimichurri.The food is a bit pricey. Good thing that we had ordered appetizers since we would have been hungry after the entrees. Oh yeah..the mac n cheese amount is massive and the cornbread was ""ok"". I had better cornbread at another Southern/Creole restaurant. All in all..is the food worth the visit....yes. Would I go back and try more cocktails...hellz yeah!",4.0
Just came back... In terms of food: the lobster shrimp and cheese grits lawwwwwwwwwwd yes! The cornbread was too sweet and not hot enough to melt the pad of butter. The red velvet waffle was yummy. I hope the managers consider a fried fish version of this chicken and waffles dish. Mac and cheese was still legit. And my mom approved of the quality of the maple syrup.Downside is we had a 30 min estimated wait that was really more like an hour but i think that's good for a Friday night before valentine's day. More time to drink :D,4.0
"I found out about this place via Instagram. I was intrigued by their red velvet waffles served with fried chicken. After many attempts, I was finally able to visit this place with friends.

"Saturday was wrapped up beautifully thanks to Soco. My party threw a surprise dinner party for one of our dearest friends and it was a success! We made reservations for a party of 6 @ 8pm. When we first arrived we checked in with the host and  we let him know that our party was here and asked to be seated. His response was- ""You can't be seated until a majority of your party is here"" My response... ""It's a surprise & we are 4 out of 6....."" (Let the awkward stares commence)So after of few moments of him doing 4th grade math in his head... He then seated us at our table. Our dining experience was nothing over the top and not the worst... But the staff is touch & go and do not expect them to be able to attend your need, when it arises. Where did the 5 stars come from you ask?!? Well, the food was phenomenal! Everyone in our party had a different entree: jambalaya, BBQ chicken dinner, skirt steak, ny steak, red velvet waffle & fried chicken, and grilled salmon. We also had three sides at the table: mac&ache else, garlic green beans, and dirty rice. YUMMMMMMERS!!! Everyone also enjoyed very potent long islands (sans moi, soda & cran). The food took longer than usual to come out, but worth the wait... The Food was hot fresh, delicious and plated beautifully. Definitely check it out... But avoid the dickish host with dreadlocks",5.0
"Ordered the chicken and waffles. The chicken was underwhelming. It tasted as though it was fried earlier in the day and then was warmed up in the microwave when I ordered it. The waffle was decent. The best thing I ordered was the macaroni and cheese. I loved the hint of garlic in it.Overall, I'll pass on a second trip. There are way better chicken and waffle options located in Williamsburg.(Oh yeah, there's a ""no hat"" policy for males and females)",2.0
"If you're looking for some Southern food with a twist then add Soco to your list of places to eat in Brooklyn. The menu is filled with a mix of several cuisines: cajun & creole, barbecue, & soul food. The Buttermilk Fried Chicken with Red Velvet Waffles is a popular item. The chicken was crispy on the outside & juicy on the inside & the waffles were ok. It was nice to try a different flavored waffle. So far, the best thing I've eaten here is the Aunt Cruz's Mac & Cheese (refer to pic & see why). Besides Southern food, Soco also offers their take on modern cocktails like the Peach Cobbler, which consists of Ciroc Peach, peach puree, vanilla bean simple syrup, & a dash of cinnamon. There is also the yummy Coco Caramel Martini, which has vanilla infused vodka & Bailey's Caramel topped with a toasted marshmallow. Soco is a cool place to grab brunch, lunch, or dinner.",4.0
"The service here was pretty nice, but they had some miscommunication and screw ups here and there. My friends and I came here to celebrate 2 birthdays in 1 dinner, which meant double the cake... Not only did they deliver the wrong cake, but they also charge a pretty expensive cake fee of $20! We ordered probably the most popular dishes here - the red velvet waffle & fried chicken, mac n' cheese, complimentary biscuits when you check in. + The biscuits and mac n' cheese were DELICIOUS and flavorful. Don't worry about not having enough biscuits because the complimentary is enough for one.- The red velvet waffle was nothing exceptionalI think I would pass on going to restaurant for when I'm craving soul food.P.S Make sure your whole party is here when you make a reservation, or else you will not be seated!",3.0
"I've been here a few times and walked out because there's always a line! But this time (4pm) we were able to be seated as soon as we entered. Could it be the time I arrived? I believe so! My server (Aaron) polite and attentive. We ordered our food and waited maybe 30 minutes for it. Everything tasted very good and it was cooked with all the right seasonings. The Salmon tasted amazing, It melted in my mouth! The string beans tasted very good actually, it wasn't overlooked at all. I'm not a fan of sweet potato so i pushed it to the side but I kinda tasted it a little because it touched my string beans and it wasn't too bad. I enjoyed the Mac and Cheese but no one can beat Cafeteria when it comes to that. I had no complaints about the food or my experience. I sat indoors and it was very cold so I moved to the outdoor seating and it was a little better. I liked the amount of space back there, it wasn't cramped at all. My server came back there often to check on me and that is a plus for me. I do not like to look for anyone that is suppose to provide a service to me.Overall I will return and try something different. Who knows what because I love to order the same thing. The space is beautiful and clean! The restroom was clean as well.",5.0
"Overall I really like this spot. It's a treaty Brooklyn spot with a beautiful ambience. The drinks are great but to me the food is just mediocre. The waitress was great. She is who won me over, very friendly with a warm personality. The wait to be seated was about 15 mins and everyone who worked here (even the doorman) were super nice. I would eat here again just based on how nice everyone was.",4.0
"Did someone say red velvet waffles?!?! HOW CAN I PASS THIS UPI've always wanted to try chicken and waffles together as everyone seems to love it so what better place than to go to than Soco, which not only has chicken and waffles but has chicken and REDVELVET waffles??!!?! However, my excitement for the red velvet waffles ends now. The presentation was beautiful but honestly the waffles was very meh. It isnt that flavorful and was toooo soft. The chicken was goood but if I'm trying to get chicken and waffle, I would like the waffle to be up to par.My excitement now returns for the mac and cheese because it was DELICIOUS. I am honestly not the biggest mac and cheese fan (don't kill me) but I read in the reviews that the mac & cheese is a must have so I decided to try that. Soooo glad I got it or else I would have left Soco pretty unsatisfied. Idk what they put in it but each bite is delicious. If I ever return, I'll skip the waffle and just go for the mac & cheese!I can on a weekday for lunch so luckily I didnt have to wait long but I heard it gets really busy for weekend brunch so make sure to make a reservation before hand!",3.0

"We looked at the reservations online and saw that they were all booked for Sunday brunch. We called and they confirmed the reservations were filled up but to walk in anyway in case someone cancels, never shows up or is late, etc. We are really glad we did, expecting there was a long line, but we were seated within less than 5 minutes!Our waiter was very attentive and memorized our entire order when we placed it. The food came out in good timing (not long at all, maybe 15-20 minutes). We ordered the pecan crusted pork chops, red velvet waffles with fried chicken and their famous mac & cheese. We also tried the hibiscus agave margarita, ginger root beer and blueberry lemonade.We did the Yelp check-in and was given a plate of three pieces of complimentary corn bread with butter! :)Everything was delicious, well-made and very filling. We are glad that we were able to bring back leftovers because we craved it again later that night. I wish they had the bottomless mimosas special on Sundays also, instead of just Saturdays. But, we definitely will be back soon and will make a reservation in advance (we were so lucky the first time to be able to get seats quickly)!",5.0

"Saturday was wrapped up beautifully thanks to Soco. My party threw a surprise dinner party for one of our dearest friends and it was a success! We made reservations for a party of 6 @ 8pm. When we first arrived we checked in with the host and  we let him know that our party was here and asked to be seated. His response was- ""You can't be seated until a majority of your party is here"" My response... ""It's a surprise & we are 4 out of 6....."" (Let the awkward stares commence)So after of few moments of him doing 4th grade math in his head... He then seated us at our table. Our dining experience was nothing over the top and not the worst... But the staff is touch & go and do not expect them to be able to attend your need, when it arises. Where did the 5 stars come from you ask?!? Well, the food was phenomenal! Everyone in our party had a different entree: jambalaya, BBQ chicken dinner, skirt steak, ny steak, red velvet waffle & fried chicken, and grilled salmon. We also had three sides at the table: mac&ache else, garlic green beans, and dirty rice. YUMMMMMMERS!!! Everyone also enjoyed very potent long islands (sans moi, soda & cran). The food took longer than usual to come out, but worth the wait... The Food was hot fresh, delicious and plated beautifully. Definitely check it out... But avoid the dickish host with dreadlocks",5.0
"Ordered the chicken and waffles. The chicken was underwhelming. It tasted as though it was fried earlier in the day and then was warmed up in the microwave when I ordered it. The waffle was decent. The best thing I ordered was the macaroni and cheese. I loved the hint of garlic in it.Overall, I'll pass on a second trip. There are way better chicken and waffle options located in Williamsburg.(Oh yeah, there's a ""no hat"" policy for males and females)",2.0
"If you're looking for some Southern food with a twist then add Soco to your list of places to eat in Brooklyn. The menu is filled with a mix of several cuisines: cajun & creole, barbecue, & soul food. The Buttermilk Fried Chicken with Red Velvet Waffles is a popular item. The chicken was crispy on the outside & juicy on the inside & the waffles were ok. It was nice to try a different flavored waffle. So far, the best thing I've eaten here is the Aunt Cruz's Mac & Cheese (refer to pic & see why). Besides Southern food, Soco also offers their take on modern cocktails like the Peach Cobbler, which consists of Ciroc Peach, peach puree, vanilla bean simple syrup, & a dash of cinnamon. There is also the yummy Coco Caramel Martini, which has vanilla infused vodka & Bailey's Caramel topped with a toasted marshmallow. Soco is a cool place to grab brunch, lunch, or dinner.",4.0
"The service here was pretty nice, but they had some miscommunication and screw ups here and there. My friends and I came here to celebrate 2 birthdays in 1 dinner, which meant double the cake... Not only did they deliver the wrong cake, but they also charge a pretty expensive cake fee of $20! We ordered probably the most popular dishes here - the red velvet waffle & fried chicken, mac n' cheese, complimentary biscuits when you check in. + The biscuits and mac n' cheese were DELICIOUS and flavorful. Don't worry about not having enough biscuits because the complimentary is enough for one.- The red velvet waffle was nothing exceptionalI think I would pass on going to restaurant for when I'm craving soul food.P.S Make sure your whole party is here when you make a reservation, or else you will not be seated!",3.0
"I've been here a few times and walked out because there's always a line! But this time (4pm) we were able to be seated as soon as we entered. Could it be the time I arrived? I believe so! My server (Aaron) polite and attentive. We ordered our food and waited maybe 30 minutes for it. Everything tasted very good and it was cooked with all the right seasonings. The Salmon tasted amazing, It melted in my mouth! The string beans tasted very good actually, it wasn't overlooked at all. I'm not a fan of sweet potato so i pushed it to the side but I kinda tasted it a little because it touched my string beans and it wasn't too bad. I enjoyed the Mac and Cheese but no one can beat Cafeteria when it comes to that. I had no complaints about the food or my experience. I sat indoors and it was very cold so I moved to the outdoor seating and it was a little better. I liked the amount of space back there, it wasn't cramped at all. My server came back there often to check on me and that is a plus for me. I do not like to look for anyone that is suppose to provide a service to me.Overall I will return and try something different. Who knows what because I love to order the same thing. The space is beautiful and clean! The restroom was clean as well.",5.0
"Overall I really like this spot. It's a treaty Brooklyn spot with a beautiful ambience. The drinks are great but to me the food is just mediocre. The waitress was great. She is who won me over, very friendly with a warm personality. The wait to be seated was about 15 mins and everyone who worked here (even the doorman) were super nice. I would eat here again just based on how nice everyone was.",4.0

"We went to SoCo for date night last Saturday. As the parents of two toddlers, we don't get out much, and were looking forward to a sophisticated experience.After trying to make a reservation online with no success, we called and were told to come in and see if we could be accommodated. We arrived at 10:15 and gave my husband's cell number so they could text us when a table was ready, and sat near the bar while an unedited trap music playlist  provided background music . While we waited, no one greeted us or asked if we'd like a drink or appetizers. We were close enough to the bar that a server accidentally bumped me on his way to the dining area.40 minutes passed before the table was ready. We were led to the patio area, where other groups were enjoying their meal. We ordered drinks and entrées, but were told that they were out of the salmon burger (which my husband really wanted). He ordered the grilled salmon instead, and I ordered chicken and waffles.We sipped our drinks and waited another 30 minutes before our waiter brought out ketchup and syrup. By this time, we were starving. He said our food would be ready shortly. After another 5 minutes, he came back to inform us that the kitchen was closed because the staff had walked out and they would no longer be serving food. He offered to comp our drinks and moved on to inform the other tables that hadn't been served.At no point did the manager come out to explain what had happened.

"It was almost at 5 stars!!!! Until their signature dish left much to be desired....but let's start at the beginning...I've been seeing instagram/facebook posts from friends about this place for awhile. The chicken and red velvet waffles looked amazing so I've just been counting down the days to go. My boyfriend and I decided to make reservations for Valentine's Day-good decision! We made reservations for 12pm right when it opened (they don't open up until 12 on the dot and there is a line-you will stand outside if you get there early). Good thing for us we only got there about 5-10 min early so the freezing cold didn't damper our mood. When they opened the doors one of the hostesses had a bright smile and welcomed everyone in an extremely enthusiastic way (props!). Reservations go to one side and walkins to another. We were seated immediately. Our waiter came over to help us right away. Talk about efficiency. He advised us to order quickly so we didn't have to wait on our food too long. We got a carafe of sangria for $30 (prob wouldn't get it again but it was good). With a yelp checkin you get cornbread. It was kind of like getting a taste of heaven. It was really really good! I debated between the 'chicken and waffles' and the 'shrimp, lobster and grits'. Our waiter suggested chicken and waffles for a first timer and encouraged my boyfriend to get the s/l/g (thanks sir! Sharing is caring indeed). While we waited they made sure to fill our water glasses, sangria glasses and made sure to check if we needed anything. And better yet they had every r&b slow jam you can think of playing for a nice Valentine's Day atmosphere (send that playlist my way please!). Additionally everyone who worked there was so polite and may I say attractive also (where they do that at? Lol). When our food came I was kind of disappointed. The red velvet waffles just didn't excite me at all. The chicken was pretty good but not out of this world by any means. I was expecting more (high expectations maybe?). Wouldn't get them again.

Listen here. I know you're coming for the chicken and waffles. I know that! But let your friend get that! Have some of theirs! Is it absolutely amazing?! YES!

"What a great place! I went here on an exceptionally busy night. There was a violinist there playing songs popular music, which brought everyone's mood straight up. There's a doorman at the door who greets you and opens the door for you. Once your inside, you are greeted again and asked where you would like to sit: inside or outside. I sat inside but the outside looks gorgeous as well. Our waitress was very attentive and the food came out super fast.We ordered the chicken and waffles. The waffles were great, very sweet. I've had better but these were very good. The chicken was BOMB. A tad bit spicy, crunchy as ever, and very juicy. I also order the dirty rice, which was tasteless so don't get it. The price was a little more than Sweet Chick, but it was okay. I'm not coming here every week, it's a once in a while treat. Really great modern decor. I loved everything about this place.

"I discovered Soco a few years ago and I immediately fell in love with the southern style cuisine.  About a year and a half ago I stopped going not because the menu changed, not because the food all of a sudden became unbearable but because they began including the gratuity as mandatory on the bill.  I believe I'm a generous tipper but I also believe the tip is based on the level of service  received, I've left anywhere between a 1% tip (in order to make a point) to a 25% tip just because I was impressed by the level of service.  The waiting staff at Soco from my prospective are great and a fully capable of earning a decent tip on their own merit, including it as part of the bill just takes away from the experience.  To make matters worse I was in there for brunch with 3 kids and another friend total of 5 people, because of the number of people the waiter directed me to the menu which showed a mandatory 20% gratuity when serving 5 people or more.So to anyone how reads this I want it to be clear Soco is an excellent neighborhood gem but be wary of the gratuity policy.",4.0

Blackened salmon was very fresh, molasses braised short ribs were very tender, and buttermilk fried chicken was awesome too.

There's a doorman at the door who greets you and opens the door for you. Once your inside, you are greeted again and asked where you would like to sit: inside or outside. I sat inside but the outside looks gorgeous as well. Our waitress was very attentive and the food came out super fast.We ordered the chicken and waffles. The waffles were great, very sweet. I've had better but these were very good. The chicken was BOMB. A tad bit spicy, crunchy as ever, and very juicy. I also order the dirty rice, which was tasteless so don't get it. The price was a little more than Sweet Chick, but it was okay. I'm not coming here every week, it's a once in a while treat. Really great modern decor. I loved everything about this place. It was packed and the service was still great. A lot of space to move even tho the restaurant isn't too widely spaced.Would go again.",4.0
"I discovered Soco a few years ago and I immediately fell in love with the southern style cuisine.  About a year and a half ago I stopped going not because the menu changed, not because the food all of a sudden became unbearable but because they began including the gratuity as mandatory on the bill.  I believe I'm a generous tipper but I also believe the tip is based on the level of service  received, I've left anywhere between a 1% tip (in order to make a point) to a 25% tip just because I was impressed by the level of service.  The waiting staff at Soco from my prospective are great and a fully capable of earning a decent tip on their own merit, including it as part of the bill just takes away from the experience.  To make matters worse I was in there for brunch with 3 kids and another friend total of 5 people, because of the number of people the waiter directed me to the menu which showed a mandatory 20% gratuity when serving 5 people or more.So to anyone how reads this I want it to be clear Soco is an excellent neighborhood gem but be wary of the gratuity policy.",4.0
"Great food, great atmosphere, great service. The only thing that bothered me, and I know I'm nitpicking, is the small tables. My mom and I each ordered an entree and a side and they barely fit on the table. It could have just been where we were seated. But other than that it's perfectly fine. I recommend this place to everyone.",5.0
Made a reservation & still had to wait 45 minutes for a table. Then we got seated and no one came to us for over 20 minutes!!!! We asked for a manager and he came and apologized and left. Horrible guest service. From the hostess to the management. I'm very annoyed and disappointed with this experience. We asked for a manager again (Yogi) and he did absolutely nothing to resolve the issue. I'm beyond annoyed.,1.0
"The staff here is soooo friendly!! We really enjoyed our dinner here. Check-in on yelp and get free delicious cornbread! F-Que Wings and Soco Baby Back Ribs were excellent... saucy and messy, flavorful and spicy. They were both a generous portion for a great price! Blackened salmon was very fresh, molasses braised short ribs were very tender, and buttermilk fried chicken was awesome too. The buttermilk fried chicken and really yummy red velvet waffle are def worth the $20. Wish we had time to try some desserts and wish we lived closer so we could come for brunch!!",5.0
"Cost: $35/personFood: 3.5/5Vibes: 4/5Decor: 4/5Location: Myrtle Ave. New Years Day brunch at SoCo was worth the hangover. We arrive and everyone's crazy busy, it's packed to the door, but the staff was super hospitable. Expected to wait but I didn't mind. The vibes were right plus the complimentary bubbly, and every dish coming out looked good.Seating: 1 hour wait. Party of 3 seated in the enclosed outdoor space. Recommend. Deals: Checked in on YELP, complimentary corn bread and Mac and cheese. $15 Bottomless Mimosa. Food: Fried chicken w/ red velvet waffle ($21.00)Bill: $147.00, 3 entrées and 3 mimosa deals, tip included. If the food was more reasonably priced I would have given it 5 stars. But when the place is packed you can charge whatever you like.  It was worth going to.",4.0
"No beating around the bush: One of the best brunch spots I've ever been to and maybe the best I've ever been to in NYC! The atmosphere, service and food were perfect and I don't think I can find a single complaint about my brunch experience here. What's even better is that they allow for OpenTable reservations, which worked out perfectly for us as we just walked in at our Saturday, 12pm reservation slot and were immediately seated. Warning: If you don't make reservations for weekend brunch here, you're going to have a long wait come 1-2pm, so make sure to do it! When we left the restaurant around 2pm, there were approximately 30-40 customers, standing in front of the bar, waiting to be seated.The restaurant was much bigger than I anticipated as there was a long bar right as we entered followed by a spacious dark dining area and towards the back was a heated enclosed garden seating area, which is where we were seated. If you get a chance, definitely aim for being seated in the garden seating area as there is sunlight that will peer thru the glass enclosing, which makes for better lighting when eating.As for the service, it was spot on all day. We were given menus immediately when we sat and explanations were given to questions we had about the food. The drinks we ordered (Coffee and Sangria) came exactly when they needed to and the dishes we ordered were perfectly timed after we ordered. While we were eating, the waiter (in training) and waitress came by every once in a while to check on us to make sure we were OK too.Now for the food:Aunt Cruz's Mac and Cheese - It was served in a 'small' round hot skillet and it was some of the best Mac and Cheese I've ever had in my life. Once you get past the crunchy exterior, the mac and cheese stuffed inside is extremely gooey and warm. There were definitely a few different cheeses blended in and I could taste every single one with each bite! Even though it's not categorized as an appetizer, it's a must-get as a side/appetizer!Buttermilk Fried Chicken - Organic Buttermilk Chicken served on a Red Velvet Waffle - OK we all know everyone who visits this restaurant will definitely order this. It's a given and you can't even deny it. I probably don't need to hype it up more than it already is. The waffle was excellent and the pieces of chicken served on the waffle were well sized and tasty. The chicken wasn't overly large, which would dominate the waffle, but not too small where a customer would be wondering where the rest of it is. I saw many customers actually having a hard time finishing it because of the waffle's size. Short Rib Hash - Made with Roasted Peppers, Jalapeno, Onions, Potatoes, White Cheddar, Sunny Side Up Egg. There was such a generous amount of rib meat inside and when we poached the egg, it made for a beautiful yellow lava of goodness. The meat was braised like brisket and was very tender and flavorful. If I had one small gripe, it would've been I wish they included a little bit more potatoes, but it wasn't a big deal. The entree was still excellent.Strawberry Shortcake French Toast with Maple Butter & Whipped Cream - We decided to order 3 entrees to share and this was the last one we selected randomly. MY GOODNESS how we were so thankful we ordered this! I know the star of the restaurant is the Red Velvet Waffle and Buttermilk Chicken, but I would like to make a case that this could be the best main entrée in the entire restaurant! It was a complete surprise at how addictive the French Toast was. I didn't expect this, but the French Toast was actually stuffed with the Strawberry Shortcake filling and the French Toast was so soft. Maybe the best French Toast I've ever had anywhere on this great planet! I highly recommend this be ordered by any customers here and to challenge my claim!In closing, I don't think I can throw any more praise in SoCo's direction. Just a word of advice though. If you're going to visit SoCo with another person, a date, a friend or even a bigger group, please have someone order something OTHER than the Buttermilk Fried Chicken. I know everyone is curious about the Red Velvet Waffle, but at the end of the day, it's still Chicken and Waffles, which can be found at quite a few restaurants in NYC. Don't get me wrong, the Buttermilk Fried Chicken is excellent, but if you give the Strawberry Shortcake French Toast a chance you WILL NOT be disappointed! It will be the best French Toast you've ever had! I think whomever orders the Buttermilk Fried Chicken can find it in their heart to split the Buttermilk Fried Chicken with whomever ordered the Strawberry Shortcake French Toast :)",5.0
"I came here for a friends birthday with a large group, about 12 of us. The reservation was made that day so they were definitely very accommodating, the restaurant became very packed around 6pm on a Saturday. I can't comment on the drinks since I had a Heineken but their drinks did look good. The wings and cornbread were delicious. I ordered the chicken and waffles, but here is where they lost major points. My chicken was pink on the inside. I didn't notice until my last piece of chicken, the other 2 were white inside. Based on the other comments I see here the waiters said it was due to the seasoning they use but that wouldn't explain why it was just one piece. Shame on me for not mentioning it to the waiter but at that point I felt like nothing could be done. My friend also had the chicken and said it didn't look like it was cooked properly either. Everyone who didn't get the fried chicken did enjoy their meals so maybe I just ordered the wrong thing. The chicken itself (pinkness aside) wasn't the best I've had so I probably would go elsewhere for that. I did really like the decor, and our waitress was really nice but I don't think I would come back for the food. Maybe drinks?",3.0
"This place is yummy. Had the skirt steak and the Mac and cheese. Food was good! My friend had the red velvet waffles and chicken which was also yummy. For dessert we had the molten cake.

"I'll start by saying, you need reservations to dine at this restaurant. And not like make reservations the night before give yourself more time to get the time and day you want. I've been here twice. First time I brought my bf here for his birthday, I made reservations so we didn't have to wait long. We only had one issue that night, which was that they were out of several items which was super annoying. But, after we ordered what they did have in stock everything else went well. The food was delicious and we enjoyed our time there. The second I went there was for Saturday brunch. We choose the drinks option. The mimosas were good and so was the food. I had gotten the chicken and waffles and he got the french toast. Both tasted great. Don't forget to make your reservations ahead of time!",4.0

"I came for Saturday night dinner and was expecting the usual line that comes along with this place. i made reservations and arrived early at the managers request and was seated shortly after arriving . The manager was very accommodating and pleasant. So lets get to it . i had the chicken and waffles - the chicken was crispy and the waffles were moist and juicy , loved it !Mac and Cheese - was OK . it was cheesy but it didn't have much flavor. definitely looks better that it tastesand for my drink i cant remember the name but it was the most popular summer drink ( it was blue) and that was amazing.overall great staff , super friendly and moderately priced expect to pay a little over $130 (with tip) for two people with appetizers, entrees, a side and drinks.

The fish and chips were a disappointment. The fish had the strongest earthy, muddy, dirt taste to it and it did not pair well with the kimchee aioli sauce that it came with.

We put a bit more fire under our behinds and got there at 2:50, to be told by the host that they are no longer seating guests. I showed her on my call log that I literally called them a few minutes earlier and what I was told. She couldn't help. I asked to speak with the manager, who arrived with attitude and eyes popping. Despite my showing him that we literally just called, were arriving from Manhattan and arrived at least 10-25 minutes earlier than the recommended time.

Others suggested making a reservation in advance and I'm glad we did. All seats were taken when we arrived, however there wasn't a line outside so you may have a chance if you decide to walk in. Once seated my friends and I ordered unlimited mimosas and our entrees. We checked-in via Yelp and received the free cornbread (a basket of 3) which was really good. I decided to not get the usual (chicken and waffles) and ordered the strawberry shortcake french toast. My friends ordered the Short Rib Hash and Clinton Hill Omelette. Everything was delicious! I also ordered a side of mac n cheese...life changing! The food is filling so I wasn't able to finish it. It may be a side you want to share. Service was really good. Nothing on the brunch menu seemed over priced for a NYC dining experience. SoCo wasn't overly crowded and for those who like to be outside, there is outside seating in the back.

I also can't wait to try out their other dishes for lunch and dinner.",5.0
"1 star - lack of customer service skills.I've eaten at SoCo a number of times and decided to take my boyfriend for his first time. We called SoCo at 2:37 while driving in from Manhattan and was informed that we would be seated if we arrived by 3:00/3:15. We put a bit more fire under our behinds and got there at 2:50, to be told by the host that they are no longer seating guests. I showed her on my call log that I literally called them a few minutes earlier and what I was told. She couldn't help. I asked to speak with the manager, who arrived with attitude and eyes popping. Despite my showing him that we literally just called, were arriving from Manhattan and arrived at least 10-25 minutes earlier than the recommended time. His response.....""I will put you on the wait list but I can't guarantee you will be seated"". Really?!?!? SoCo might I suggest you hire a manager with customer service skills.",1.0
"everything I've ever gotten here has been delicious. Probably my favorite restaurant in BK food wise. Highly suggest the lobster shrimp & grits, SoJazzy Salad and the mac & cheese !! All delicious. the staff is friendly and every part of the place is nice to sit in, except at night, try to avoid the backyard area due to awful lighting (great during the day though)",5.0
"This is the 3rd time dining at Soco and as always they deliver. They are closed for a few hours after lunch which is a bit inconvenient so Dinner starts at 6pm. The Gumbo and wings were great appetizers. For the entree round: the chicken and waffles(fan favorite according to yelpers), the steak (buttery, tender and well done) and The Mac and cheese (great go to for a side dish - every table had some) ! For dessert: the fried banana wontons were ok, nothing to boast about.",4.0
"Soco is usually packed and lively and it is for good reason. The food here is fresh, well seasoned, and delicious. To top it off, the ambiance is great and overall energy of the place is great. I went to Soco one evening and they had a violinist playing the latest R&B hits and i really enjoyed it. My favorite items on the menu are the B54 burger, the chicken and red velvet waffles, the F-Que wings, and the steak and eggs. The drinks and the drink specials are great too. This is definitely a place that I recommend and I will be back again for the ??th time (I lost count).",5.0
"I found SoCo via Instagram. The food looked so good, so I immediately made a reservation for the Saturday I would be in town for a girls trip. Others suggested making a reservation in advance and I'm glad we did. All seats were taken when we arrived, however there wasn't a line outside so you may have a chance if you decide to walk in. Once seated my friends and I ordered unlimited mimosas and our entrees. We checked-in via Yelp and received the free cornbread (a basket of 3) which was really good. I decided to not get the usual (chicken and waffles) and ordered the strawberry shortcake french toast. My friends ordered the Short Rib Hash and Clinton Hill Omelette. Everything was delicious! I also ordered a side of mac n cheese...life changing! The food is filling so I wasn't able to finish it. It may be a side you want to share. Service was really good. Nothing on the brunch menu seemed over priced for a NYC dining experience. SoCo wasn't overly crowded and for those who like to be outside, there is outside seating in the back. It's really the perfect location for a Saturday afternoon brunch. I look forward to visiting again when I'm back in NYC.",4.0
Damn. Just... damn. I'm lying on the couch struggling to stay awake after this. Some of the best chicken and waffles I've ever had. The itis is settling in now. I'm gonna be back here soon though for round two. Maybe after this nap.,4.0
"When in Brooklyn , VISIT SOCO! This place is great, trendy and neat with service that matches their food. The Mac and cheese is a must, served in a very hot skillet . Jambalaya was seasoned well and the BBQ chicken juicy and moist. the butternut squash ravioli , it's the only vegetarian Entree and it lacks flavor .  I was impressed with the selections of wines. And the well crafted cocktail list . Enjoy your 5 stars Soco",5.0
"Came back again with a few more friends and we had a great time, though its started off bumpy because we waited about 30-40 minutes to be seated even though I had a table reserved and we got there 10 minutes early.

"On my way to PT post handling auto-body business, I decided to grab a bite for lunch. As I was strolling through the area I came across southern fused Soco; a neighborhood favorite. I of course decided to enter as I haven't been here in a few years and this would make it my second visit.   Upon entry I am greeted by a gentleman who assures I find a seat in which case I opted for one at the bar. I was seated and greeted by a lovely young woman by the name of Carla. She was very polite and patient as I indecisively skimmed through the menu for something healthy, protein heavy, but also filling. I found just that in the Soul Fried Chicken Sandwich with a side of salad. It didn't take too long for the dish to arrive as I was busy fiddling on my smartphone while charging. Yes, I know -- us millennials.   Upon arrival, I looked at the dish and I was pretty much happy with what was before me. Two fried chicken breasts on a bun with lettuce and pickles and some salad on the side. Carla offered some pepper in which I obliged and I'm happy I did. It gave some life to the salad and a slight kick to my sandwich.   Upon my first bite, I noticed the sandwich was dry, but then again who are we kidding? I'm chowing on chicken breast which is tough to not be dry at all. Nevertheless I feel like the chicken could've used more zest or more of a better seasoning to compliment the sandwich. I was hungry, I ate it. The end. Would I get it again? No. Was it that bad? No, but it was certainly nothing to rave about.    The backyard seemed very pleasant from where I was sitting. I mean it was about 3p and the sun was shining. The last and first time I came to Soco was during the harsh winter of '13 and during dinner time. Be aware to call before coming because the kitchen's closed for certain times of the day to prepare for lunch/dinner, etc. Luckily for me I made it right before that post lunch 2hr. gap where they prep for dinner. One upside though is that you can still order sides like mac & cheese, wings and so forth.   All in all I enjoyed my meal. It's tough for me to complain. It did the trick and Carla was very nice in keeping my glass full of my favorite (water with lemon), every time I consumed it all. I gave Soco 3 stars instead of 4 because there was nothing to particularly face about. I mean I was in there during lunch where I couldn't really gauge how good or not the customer service was and the food just didn't particular fancy my taste buds. Still a solid restaurant and I will definitely come back again soon. Perhaps then I will update my review and add an additional étoile.",3.0

"Soco's biggest problem is their inconsistency with food. I hate to go to a restaurant love something, crave it and go back to the restaurant and it's not the same. Mac and cheese in my opinion is overrated. It's not bad by any means. I just feel like I've personally made better. If I go with people and they order it I'll have a spoonful. But I'll never personally order it again. F-que wings are decent. Flavor is good. They were just a little soggy for my liking. I like my wings crispy and can never grasp the concept of baked/smoked wings. I guess it's a preference thing. Chicken and waffles most inconsistent dish there. I've had this on 4 separate occasions and it's been different each time in terms of texture and flavor of the waffle. I've only been completely satisfied with this on one occasion. All the cooks need to be thoroughly trained on making that waffle batter because it's sad. When it's executed correctly its really good. My favorite dish there would have to be the lobster shrimp and grits. Absolutely delicious every time. Lobster and shrimp always cooked perfectly. White cheddar grits are  creamy and lump free. That spicy tomato broth served with it. Just yum. No matter what I order I always get this dish as well. Drinks are way overpriced, weak and not always good. I'm talking posh Manhattan prices like they have mixologist behind the bar. I don't mind paying premium prices for great premium cocktails. (Which you're not receiving)Never had a problem with service. Always get a attentive, smily waiter or a cool carefree bartender. Ambience is great and modern. Music is always on point. I always go for dinner want to check out brunch soon.",3.0

(It's my first time trying and I don't like the texture)Pecan seared lamb chops: crunchy and well flavored but hard to cut inCheddar grits: I could make it at home : cream of wheat, salt, cheddar and scallionsThe mac and cheese: As everyone says, it is amazing.The ribs: They're greatttttt!The waffles and chicken: Yummy! The best chicken and waffles I've had yet!The blueberry bourbon sour: This was soooo good!The waiter was attentive and the place was pretty busy for a Thursday night but not too loud.The -.5 rating came from their ridiculous no hat policy.",4.0
"I had made reservations for my boyfriend's birthday last night. When we arrived, I was shocked they had read my note in the reservation in which they told him happy birthday and said his name so that was a plus in my book.With the drinks, I had the caramel martini with the marshmallow and it tasted amazing. The marshmallow tasted good and it was an updated smore in an alcoholic drink. My boyfriend had the Brooklyn Brown which I thought would taste bad but it was decent and had a kick to it.Food, we started off with mac and cheese and cornbread. The mac and cheese was great not too cheesy and had the crust which is my favorite part. The portion of the mac n cheese was alot for an appetizer but it was worth it. The cornbread was great you did not need butter and it was soft. It felt like  an edible pillow. For entrées I had the steak frites which was good a little bit chewy but it was well seasoned and the fries were nice and crunchy. My boyfriend had the infamous chicken and waffle since he never had this in his life...ever!!!! So when he saw his plate, let's just say all convo ceased. I even had a hard time asking for a piece but he gave in. I never tasted a waffle so light it was delicious and made me crave more. Overall, we had a blast and our server was great and even though he had a lot of tables he paid attention and made sure we were fine. I enjoyed the ambiance and the vibe. Would definitely recommend going but make reservation as more people are getting hip to this.",4.0
"Food was excellent but service was horrendous.First there was the wait.  The host first told us they were prepping the table and wait would be five minutes.  We ended up waiting closer to 20 so either prepping table was a lie or they just forgot about us.Our server Jeffrey took the orders and delivered the food but did nothing else.  Never checked on us for water despite the empty cups and pitcher. I ordered smores for desert.  It didn't come for over 10 minutes.  I had to flag someone else down to ask what's going on.  I was told five minutes as I watched Jeffrey duck into the kitchen and emerge with my desert instantly.  I was pretty sure he forgot while he chatted away with other waiters in front of the computer terminal next to kitchen.  As he delivered desert, I asked for check.  It never came and I had to flag someone else down again. I had the card in my hand but he just dropped the tin with the check and left.  At this point I was obviously pissed off so I told my companions: his tip right now is 20 dollars, just under 20% of the bill.  For every minute he makes us wait, he loses a dollar.  I started timer on my phone.10 minutes in, one of my companions got tired of waiting so she got up and got a different waiter to do the bill. At this point I was about to triumphantly leave 10 dollars for the tip. It was not meant to be.  The bill included an automatic 18% ""gratuity"" for our party of 3 and had the gumption to have another line for ""tip"" as if 18% for making us wait almost 30 minutes to pay them with no water in our cups wasn't enough.The experience was just horrible.  It's a shame because the food was quite good. I would have rated 5 stars if service was as good as the food, at least four if service was at least Applebee's level.Blackened salmon had no special flavoring but was cooked spot on and served on delicious mashed sweet potatoes.  The jambalaya was better than most I had in New Orleans with very generously large shrimps.  The skirt steak used Cajun seasonings and some peppers to add a kick to the steak for great effect.  The potatoes for the steak was delicious with the steak juices soaked up.Carolina rolls for the appetizer were great with a bit of a crunchy skin instead of seaweed.  I recommend it.  The fried oysters were delicious but couldn't really taste the oysters. The smores gelato was amazing.  The lava cake and marshmallow combo was pretty common.  I still recommend the desert but I will try something else next time I come",2.0
"I was visiting BK for the weekend to attend an event at Barclay's. My sister raved about this place and I had it in my bookmarks for a while so I uber'ed over.

"Came here on a Sunday night and luckily making the cut at 10pm, since they close at 11pm. Appetizers: Baby back ribs and wings. Both were finger licking good. Highly suggest.

For a minute I thought I was back in NOLA. And the Chicken and waffles was delicious, I really only had the chicken and it was crunchy and just enough salty.

There was a bit of a wait when I got there but the service was good. I ordered the red velvet waffles which overall were tasty but the bourbon syrup they gave me didn't compliment them and had a bit of an after taste.,3.0
"Soco's biggest problem is their inconsistency with food. I hate to go to a restaurant love something, crave it and go back to the restaurant and it's not the same. Mac and cheese in my opinion is overrated. It's not bad by any means. I just feel like I've personally made better. If I go with people and they order it I'll have a spoonful. But I'll never personally order it again. F-que wings are decent. Flavor is good. They were just a little soggy for my liking. I like my wings crispy and can never grasp the concept of baked/smoked wings. I guess it's a preference thing. Chicken and waffles most inconsistent dish there. I've had this on 4 separate occasions and it's been different each time in terms of texture and flavor of the waffle. I've only been completely satisfied with this on one occasion. All the cooks need to be thoroughly trained on making that waffle batter because it's sad. When it's executed correctly its really good. My favorite dish there would have to be the lobster shrimp and grits. Absolutely delicious every time. Lobster and shrimp always cooked perfectly. White cheddar grits are  creamy and lump free. That spicy tomato broth served with it. Just yum. No matter what I order I always get this dish as well. Drinks are way overpriced, weak and not always good. I'm talking posh Manhattan prices like they have mixologist behind the bar. I don't mind paying premium prices for great premium cocktails. (Which you're not receiving)Never had a problem with service. Always get a attentive, smily waiter or a cool carefree bartender. Ambience is great and modern. Music is always on point. I always go for dinner want to check out brunch soon.",3.0
"I give it a 4.5!Ambience was great.Food was great.I got the pecan seared lamb chops and the mussels.My twin got cheddar grits and the Mac and cheeseMy other sister got the ribs and the waffles and chicken.Mussels: If you are a mussels fan then get these. (It's my first time trying and I don't like the texture)Pecan seared lamb chops: crunchy and well flavored but hard to cut inCheddar grits: I could make it at home : cream of wheat, salt, cheddar and scallionsThe mac and cheese: As everyone says, it is amazing.The ribs: They're greatttttt!The waffles and chicken: Yummy! The best chicken and waffles I've had yet!The blueberry bourbon sour: This was soooo good!The waiter was attentive and the place was pretty busy for a Thursday night but not too loud.The -.5 rating came from their ridiculous no hat policy.",4.0
"I had made reservations for my boyfriend's birthday last night. When we arrived, I was shocked they had read my note in the reservation in which they told him happy birthday and said his name so that was a plus in my book.With the drinks, I had the caramel martini with the marshmallow and it tasted amazing. The marshmallow tasted good and it was an updated smore in an alcoholic drink. My boyfriend had the Brooklyn Brown which I thought would taste bad but it was decent and had a kick to it.Food, we started off with mac and cheese and cornbread. The mac and cheese was great not too cheesy and had the crust which is my favorite part. The portion of the mac n cheese was alot for an appetizer but it was worth it. The cornbread was great you did not need butter and it was soft. It felt like  an edible pillow. For entrées I had the steak frites which was good a little bit chewy but it was well seasoned and the fries were nice and crunchy. My boyfriend had the infamous chicken and waffle since he never had this in his life...ever!!!! So when he saw his plate, let's just say all convo ceased. I even had a hard time asking for a piece but he gave in. I never tasted a waffle so light it was delicious and made me crave more. Overall, we had a blast and our server was great and even though he had a lot of tables he paid attention and made sure we were fine. I enjoyed the ambiance and the vibe. Would definitely recommend going but make reservation as more people are getting hip to this.",4.0
"Food was excellent but service was horrendous.First there was the wait.  The host first told us they were prepping the table and wait would be five minutes.  We ended up waiting closer to 20 so either prepping table was a lie or they just forgot about us.Our server Jeffrey took the orders and delivered the food but did nothing else.  Never checked on us for water despite the empty cups and pitcher. I ordered smores for desert.  It didn't come for over 10 minutes.  I had to flag someone else down to ask what's going on.  I was told five minutes as I watched Jeffrey duck into the kitchen and emerge with my desert instantly.  I was pretty sure he forgot while he chatted away with other waiters in front of the computer terminal next to kitchen.  As he delivered desert, I asked for check.  It never came and I had to flag someone else down again. I had the card in my hand but he just dropped the tin with the check and left.  At this point I was obviously pissed off so I told my companions: his tip right now is 20 dollars, just under 20% of the bill.  For every minute he makes us wait, he loses a dollar.  I started timer on my phone.10 minutes in, one of my companions got tired of waiting so she got up and got a different waiter to do the bill. At this point I was about to triumphantly leave 10 dollars for the tip. It was not meant to be.  The bill included an automatic 18% ""gratuity"" for our party of 3 and had the gumption to have another line for ""tip"" as if 18% for making us wait almost 30 minutes to pay them with no water in our cups wasn't enough.The experience was just horrible.  It's a shame because the food was quite good. I would have rated 5 stars if service was as good as the food, at least four if service was at least Applebee's level.Blackened salmon had no special flavoring but was cooked spot on and served on delicious mashed sweet potatoes.  The jambalaya was better than most I had in New Orleans with very generously large shrimps.  The skirt steak used Cajun seasonings and some peppers to add a kick to the steak for great effect.  The potatoes for the steak was delicious with the steak juices soaked up.Carolina rolls for the appetizer were great with a bit of a crunchy skin instead of seaweed.  I recommend it.  The fried oysters were delicious but couldn't really taste the oysters. The smores gelato was amazing.  The lava cake and marshmallow combo was pretty common.  I still recommend the desert but I will try something else next time I come",2.0

"Sooo i have had this resturant sitting in my go to places for some time now. And last night i said what the hell and went. First and foremost its a normal sized resturant so overcrowding is not an issue. But the tables are placed pretty close to each other but I personally do not have a problem with that some might. The good about SOCO:The menu is simple. Southern cuisine and very tasty named drinks ( caramel martini ). I had the steak strips. It comes with collard greens and potatoes. A friend order muscles and mac and cheese.( these 2 things are not sold together they are actually from the appetizer side). I enjoyed my steak. I dont normally order steak but im glad i did. It was well seasoned and the onions and greens peppers the steak was cooked with was neatly placed on top of the steak. Funny thing i could not find my collard greens (thanks caramel martini) as it was under the steak. The mac and cheese was good. I enjoyed it better than what i expected. I think i ate more than my friend did. They enjoyed their muscles. It was sitting in a clam sauce which they especially loved. Now the bad:A friend of mine told me to make a reservation but i was already in the place. So it is best to make a reservation as it is a frequent visited place. And the wait time can take upwards to an hour and a half. What i also did notice thats not good to me, is after you place your order most places bring bread to the table or breadsticks. Anything to tide you over until the food comes. Soco does not do that. So we had to wait for our food either sipping soda, water or from any alcoholic beverage we may have had.

"I came here 2 times. . . once for Saturday night dinner and 2nd for Sunday Brunch.  In my opinion this place is over rated. Saturday - 4 of us dined.  We had a 6:00 pm reservation and we were seated immediately.  1) Mom had chicken and waffles which was good.  2)My niece had the cheeseburger with all the stuff kids don't like to eat off it and that was good. . . 3)My sister had the  BBQ chicken which was dry and 4) I had the Blackened Salmon - No flavor on the blackened salmon which was crazy and it came with a sweet potato puree and string beans.  Sweep potato puree was ok Most of the food was bland and lacked the most important ingredient FLAVOROur waitress was not attentive and thats probably because the tip was already included in the bill.  Sunday Brunch - This was a girls brunch so I stuck with a Cesar Salad, I asked for the dressing on the side.  When i got my plate it was only salad and 3 corn bread crouton pieces. . . . it was supposed to have shaved parmesan on top.  needless to say I told the waiter and they returned it with the proper portions and i enjoyed my salad.Our waiter was attentive on this day. The decor is good (tip do not sit under the vent in the back, its freezing)  They have an outside area that is small but looks fine if you like sitting outside.  Overall it was just ok. . . . i've had better food at local mom and pop restaurants with better prices. . . . .

"I can't say enough good things about SoCo. The food has always been perfect and the cocktails very well balanced and expertly crafted. I can only recommend what I've had but I'm certain anything you order will result in your eyes rolling to the back of your head accompanied by cursing and groans of satisfaction. The mac and cheese is seemingly simple but the best I've in a long time from a restaurant. The ribs and wings are outstanding. The salmon was great a choice and I'd order it again and again but also not much more than Salmon. The chicken and waffles tho - *so many thumbs up emojis*  the chicken is tender, seasoned to perfection and sits on top of a red velvet waffle that isn't too sweet to overpower or detract from the savory dish. All the cocktails I've had here have been excellent. My favorite is the hibiscus margarita. Not too sweet, not too tart, and filled with complex flavors that don't overwhelm the senses. To sum up this entire restaurant, it's extremely well balanced. And that's something I find to be rare. It is a bit pricey but not enough so to make it unaffordable. Do yourself a favor and eat here.",5.0
"Wow,  why did so many 1 or 2 stars reviews went to the filtered section? Soco must have paid yelp to remove the bad reviews to hidden section. I found this place on yelp. .based on the great reviews and numbers of reviews. I was so excited when I first sat down bc I really likes the choices on the menu. Food review:Collard greens- way too sweet.Fried chicken and red velvet waffle- I was so disappointed. Fried chicken was more like chicken tenders. Breading was not good,  chicken was dry.  Waffle was weird..Sweet chick and pies and thighs have much better fried chicken.Short ribs and pork chops were ok.Best thing was the mac and cheese. Tried this once,  won't need to go back. .They also added a 18% gratuity to my bill, we only had 3 people. Is this even LEGAL??They also have a no hat policy .",2.0

Feel free to steal that idea SoCo!

Saturday - 4 of us dined.  We had a 6:00 pm reservation and we were seated immediately.  1) Mom had chicken and waffles which was good.  2)My niece had the cheeseburger with all the stuff kids don't like to eat off it and that was good. . . 3)My sister had the  BBQ chicken which was dry and 4) I had the Blackened Salmon - No flavor on the blackened salmon which was crazy and it came with a sweet potato puree and string beans.  Sweep potato puree was ok Most of the food was bland and lacked the most important ingredient FLAVOROur waitress was not attentive and thats probably because the tip was already included in the bill.  Sunday Brunch - This was a girls brunch so I stuck with a Cesar Salad, I asked for the dressing on the side.  When i got my plate it was only salad and 3 corn bread crouton pieces. . . . it was supposed to have shaved parmesan on top.  needless to say I told the waiter and they returned it with the proper portions and i enjoyed my salad.Our waiter was attentive on this day. The decor is good (tip do not sit under the vent in the back, its freezing)  They have an outside area that is small but looks fine if you like sitting outside.  Overall it was just ok. . . . i've had better food at local mom and pop restaurants with better prices. . . . . I personally prob won't return . . . . .",2.0

"I can't say enough good things about SoCo. The food has always been perfect and the cocktails very well balanced and expertly crafted. I can only recommend what I've had but I'm certain anything you order will result in your eyes rolling to the back of your head accompanied by cursing and groans of satisfaction. The mac and cheese is seemingly simple but the best I've in a long time from a restaurant. The ribs and wings are outstanding. The salmon was great a choice and I'd order it again and again but also not much more than Salmon. The chicken and waffles tho - *so many thumbs up emojis*  the chicken is tender, seasoned to perfection and sits on top of a red velvet waffle that isn't too sweet to overpower or detract from the savory dish. All the cocktails I've had here have been excellent. My favorite is the hibiscus margarita. Not too sweet, not too tart, and filled with complex flavors that don't overwhelm the senses. To sum up this entire restaurant, it's extremely well balanced. And that's something I find to be rare. It is a bit pricey but not enough so to make it unaffordable. Do yourself a favor and eat here.",5.0
"Wow,  why did so many 1 or 2 stars reviews went to the filtered section? Soco must have paid yelp to remove the bad reviews to hidden section. I found this place on yelp. .based on the great reviews and numbers of reviews. I was so excited when I first sat down bc I really likes the choices on the menu. Food review:Collard greens- way too sweet.Fried chicken and red velvet waffle- I was so disappointed. Fried chicken was more like chicken tenders. Breading was not good,  chicken was dry.  Waffle was weird..Sweet chick and pies and thighs have much better fried chicken.Short ribs and pork chops were ok.Best thing was the mac and cheese. Tried this once,  won't need to go back. .They also added a 18% gratuity to my bill, we only had 3 people. Is this even LEGAL??They also have a no hat policy .",2.0
"Came here for brunch with a few comrades, cuz sometimes rebels need brunch too... Anyway, it was friggin great. Wish I could give a more diverse review, but all of us came with the same mission: fried chicken & red velvet waffles. We also got an order of mac & cheese to share, was more than enough for the 3 of us. Was all slammin. The chicken was juicy & batter was mad flave. The waffle was pretty good too, didn't blow my mind. It totally Would have blown brains if it had a lil whipped cream cheese on it somehow. My gawdd, how filthy rich that would be... Feel free to steal that idea SoCo! Mac & cheese was stupid cheesy and baked in individual trays, the cheeses inside practically punched me in the face & stole my jesus piece.Every other plate we saw on every table looked great. More than down to hit it up again & try the rest of the menu.sometime...",4.0
"There are restaurants where I sit down and look around me at the dining patrons nearby, and having made an estimate of their BMI ranges, say a silent prayer to the Lord to forgive me my sins and excesses.... SoCo is one of those restaurants.The sin is not one of wilfully ignoring reviews from yelp friends that provide a cautionary tale, but of wilfully ignoring past experience and better judgment that what will follow will not be a tale of complexity or layers of texture - but about addictions that confuse breaking bad with breaking bread.Texture... That would be my foremost complaint about SoCo. From the red velvet waffles that lacked any crispness to the fried chicken that similarly lacked any crunch or crackle, I didn't discern any dimension beyond soft, perhaps to mirror a large proportion of the dining patrons. That same element was even missing from the watery gumbo that spoke more to me of black pepper than whispering sour and hinting at viscosity. Sticking with flavor, I expect more from a dish named red velvet waffles than simply a color reminding me of beet. If there was any cocoa, the restaurant should consider switching their supply source, as opposed to anyone in the kitchen.The high point for me was the service - attentive, proactive, and smiling. Though, I was startled when the lady at the reception stopped by to ask me to hash tag my pictures so they could be linked. It might be helpful to highlight that behind that request there is an assumption - that the restaurant would want to link my pictures or review - that could be erroneous. In return, I hope the staff appreciates my fairness in not highlighting in my review other restaurant(s) making red velvet waffles the way they should be, for they'd similarly show up in a google or yelp search of SoCo.It's instructive to note that the website itself asserts that ""the menu at SoCo is Southern Fusion, a new cuisine yet to make its mark on the New York dining scene""... Unintended, but truth-in-advertising as I've rarely witnessed elsewhere. The owners should examine the reasons for this phenomenon and ponder whether if this can be explained by the adage: if it ain't broke, don't fix it.On a note of personal clarification: SoCo is one of those rare places that I've only visited once before reviewing. To be fair to them, it's possible that the rest of their menu features dishes (like the famed Mac and Cheese) that are brilliantly executed or a repeat visit would have changed my mind. But, I've seen enough here to give my sense of adventure a break. I confess to my weakness, perhaps best articulated by Garfield while paraphrasing from the Bible: ""The spirit is willing, but the flesh is fat"".",2.0
"Never again!!! Highly overrated.First the waitress put in no effort because gratuity is already included .2 . The service was horrible, we ordered the $30 white sangria pitcher. The pitcher is way too small for $30. Also the white sangria is DISGUSTING... All 3 of us didn't like it, its made with lemon grass and mint. Which is why it's so NASTY. We ask the waitress if we could change it for the red sangria and she sent the bartender over. The bartender told us that they don't do that with specials. So we wasted $30 right there and none of us drink it. 3. So then our food comes and my friend ordered eggs and sweet potatoes pancakes. Her eggs were extremely runny. My other friend order the chicken waffle, the chicken was uncooked and the waffle was not good. I ordered the sliders which is actually a burger and my burger was not fully cooked even though I asked for it to be well done. We asked to see the manager which turned out to also be the bartender. He came over and gave us the run around. He told my friend that her chicken was not undercooked, that its pink inside because they use paprika and he told me my burger was actually well done its the sauce that they use that made it pink.  They took our food back and gave my friend new fried chicken, me a new burger and my other friend new eggs. My friend chicken was once again undercooked. This time they put the sauce of my burger on the side and it was still pink on the inside. So the sauce was obviously not the cause. We each paid $40 for the food and the sangria. We ended up not even really eating the food. As for the drink  none of us could even force ourselves to drink it.Since gratuity is included they obviously don't care about you as a customer, since they already have your money in their pockets.",1.0

The gumbo is salty. My uncle got the stuffed fish, the fish was decent, but rice was oily and salty. The jambalaya was not memorable.

"This is an updated review.  So I've really been pleased with Soco in the past, however, our most recent visit on 7/22/15 was a disaster, possibly only saved by the taste of our meals.My first unpleasant surprise was at the door where a door attendant requested we remove our caps [me and my nephew] luckily the other 6 member in our group weren't wearing any.   After the 8 of us were seated I asked the waiter to explain the caps removal request as I've visited this place multiple time and was allowed to wear my cap.  The waiter replied... ""I'm not sure since I'm fairly new here, but I believe it's something to do with the HOOD element....""  I think he lost me right at that statement and it was all downhill from there.   Since we were 8 and starving, we ordered drinks and out dinner entrees, skipping appetizers... Our drinks came timely, but we noticed that folks [generally two party tables] that came after us were getting their dinner served to them while we still waited.  After tracking down the waiter to explain, he stated ""those tables either ordered appetizers and also they try to take care of the smaller tables since the orders are quicker.....""  WHAT? (That's what my inner voice said as I contend to keep calm as I was already lost at the cap request.   So we continued to wait for this unfair process to repeat itself until we were eventually served....it's too bad, because the food was respectable as expected....so the updated rating here is really attributed to the deplorable service.  I certainly wouldn't be going out of my way to head back here and will be recommending the same friends and family",1.0

"The interior has a jazzy vibe with a modern twist. The restaurant is very spacious and has large door to the outside space that is a chic brick space. The bathroom is also clean and well kept.

Pretty decent proportion.The mac&cheese seemed to be a favorite amongst people who come here and it certainly had an crumbled texture on top of the mac and cheese. The side dishes (mac&cheese and F-Que wings) could be shared between two people. The F-Que chicken wings, although it tastes good, it does get spicy after one wing or two (i eat spicy food frequently). The chicken is accompanied with a orange sauce, but I thought it tasted good without it. The main reason for coming here is the Buttermilk Fried Chicken and it didn't disappoint. This is my first time trying chicken and waffles and it was not unbearingly sweet. The fried chicken was seasoned well, but it wasn't amazing. There was about three to four medium sized pieces of chicken on top of a red velvet waffle. The Jambalayan was very well spiced and the seafood was cooked well.*If you're going for a bday dinner, they have a cake fee of $20!!  Would come back if I craved chicken and waffles and really good mac&cheese.

After 15mins the hostess seated us. We sat down then we were greeted by our waiter who was really nice as well. For the appetizer we had F-Que wings which were very delicious and For the entrée I had the Pecan Crusted Pork Chop it came with Citrus Mashed Sweet Potatoes, Braised Collards and I had the Marconi.

Good news is that it comes in a small pan enough for 2! For appetizer I had spicy shrimp which looked better than it tasted but I'll still give this places 5 star.

When we arrived I instantly was digging the ambiance! It was larger than I thought and they were playing 90's-early 2000's R &B. Let the choir say Yaaaaas! We were a little early for our reservation (subway actually did its job) and waited roughly 10 minutes. We were then seated and spent quite a bit of time analyzing the menu. Everything  looked great, minus the 20% gratuity that was going to be added on all checks, regardless of party size. Also, any alcoholic specialty drink could not be returned. What?? I've never seen that before, but since this place has high ratings they must be doing something right, right? Well the drinks came and we weren't that impressed. My husband had a drink that could best be described as Hennessy and fruit punch. The fruit punch taste completely overwhelmed the drink. Disappointing. I ordered the Fried Chicken & Red Velvet Waffle, hubs got the Jambalaya and a side of greens. The greens weren't right. I took one bite, and they tasted strangely sweet. No seasoning, and definitely no ham hock! My fried chicken pieces were tiny and bland. I needed large quantities of hot sauce to even make this meal appealing to me. My husband's meal was spot on, I think all the seasoning went into that meal smh. The waiter started off ok, but he disappeared for long periods of time. He failed to mention the specials which I heard a different waiter tell his section so that was disappointing.

Red chicken and waffles . Enough said! The food here is like crack . I love the Mac and cheese and biscuits are so good . Great ambience,5.0
"F-Que wings were delicious and a must try. Chicken and red velvet waffles were amazing and I don't really like waffles. The Mac and cheese was amazing, had great flavor.The steak frites was delicious and the truffle butter on top went so well with it. I wasn't a fan of the Parmesan fries that came with it, I would have opted for something else. It's a nice small place that gets packed quick so definitely make a reservation. Only thing I wasn't too fond of was that they automatically added a gratuity charge to your bill. I'm not sure if this is something that is charged regardless, after a number of people are at a table or the amount of the bill. But there was four people in my party and the bill came up to a little over $200. They charged a 25 dollar tip into the total and also added a tip line on the credit card receipt. If you never read the receipt I advise that you do here because you will be double tipping and won't even realize it. Overall, I would come back again.",4.0
"Cornbread fantastic, staff friendly. Cheeese grits cooked in lobster broth however not a fan favorite. The combo of grits. lobster broth, sausage, and a fried egg wasnt a good pairing.

"I went here for my friend's birthday brunch the other day. This was like my second time coming here. The first time was years ago and in the evening. I don't remember the food at that time. However, when I went for the brunch, I loved it! I had the sausage and grits. It wasn't the southern style grits that I'm use to but it was on point! The sausage was excellent! It had a nice spice to it and the grits were very good as well. And the drinks were good. The service was good too. I will definitely be returning here again with my husband.",5.0
"Where do I even start... I'd give this place 6 stars if I could. Service, food, and ambiance were all on point. Side note: The all denim uniforms for the employees were so trendy and cute. And the music at this place was perfect. Slow jams and old school songs yesssss.My friend and I sat in the outdoor seating area and it was sooo cute out there. Perfect temperature which is critical for outdoor seating. Our server (can't remember his name, but he had a nose piercing I believe) was extremely attentive, and so were the bussers and food runners.We ordered a lot and shared everything. It was so worth the awful feeling of food acoma we felt afterwards. We started with the French toast (which is stuffed with creamy goodness!!) and the sausage and grits. Both of those dishes were amazing beyond measure. You will not be upset if you order either of those. The flavor of those grits will forever be engraved in my mind. After that we had the red velvet chicken and waffles + mac and cheese, and again both of those were AMAAAAZING. The crust of the Mac and cheese and the fluff of the red velvet waffle was mind blowing. I truly can't think of one thing I would change about this place. It was everything I wanted in a Sunday brunch spot and more. Will definitely be coming back and telling everyone and their mama's about this place! Ps. We made reservations, not sure how critical they are but the wait did seem a bit long?",5.0

I told them we had to come to SoCo!We each got something different based on all my favorites. We tried each other's food and everyone was pleased. We also did the endless mimosas.

Red chicken and waffles . Enough said! The food here is like crack . I love the Mac and cheese and biscuits are so good . Great ambience,5.0
"F-Que wings were delicious and a must try. Chicken and red velvet waffles were amazing and I don't really like waffles. The Mac and cheese was amazing, had great flavor.The steak frites was delicious and the truffle butter on top went so well with it. I wasn't a fan of the Parmesan fries that came with it, I would have opted for something else. It's a nice small place that gets packed quick so definitely make a reservation. Only thing I wasn't too fond of was that they automatically added a gratuity charge to your bill. I'm not sure if this is something that is charged regardless, after a number of people are at a table or the amount of the bill. But there was four people in my party and the bill came up to a little over $200. They charged a 25 dollar tip into the total and also added a tip line on the credit card receipt. If you never read the receipt I advise that you do here because you will be double tipping and won't even realize it. Overall, I would come back again.",4.0
"Cornbread fantastic, staff friendly. Cheeese grits cooked in lobster broth however not a fan favorite. The combo of grits. lobster broth, sausage, and a fried egg wasnt a good pairing. I was not pleased with my food but will still go back. Beacause we had to wait so long for our food the manager comped us the mac and cheese. That mac and cheese was AMAZING!!!",3.0
"I went here for my friend's birthday brunch the other day. This was like my second time coming here. The first time was years ago and in the evening. I don't remember the food at that time. However, when I went for the brunch, I loved it! I had the sausage and grits. It wasn't the southern style grits that I'm use to but it was on point! The sausage was excellent! It had a nice spice to it and the grits were very good as well. And the drinks were good. The service was good too. I will definitely be returning here again with my husband.",5.0
"Where do I even start... I'd give this place 6 stars if I could. Service, food, and ambiance were all on point. Side note: The all denim uniforms for the employees were so trendy and cute. And the music at this place was perfect. Slow jams and old school songs yesssss.My friend and I sat in the outdoor seating area and it was sooo cute out there. Perfect temperature which is critical for outdoor seating. Our server (can't remember his name, but he had a nose piercing I believe) was extremely attentive, and so were the bussers and food runners.We ordered a lot and shared everything. It was so worth the awful feeling of food acoma we felt afterwards. We started with the French toast (which is stuffed with creamy goodness!!) and the sausage and grits. Both of those dishes were amazing beyond measure. You will not be upset if you order either of those. The flavor of those grits will forever be engraved in my mind. After that we had the red velvet chicken and waffles + mac and cheese, and again both of those were AMAAAAZING. The crust of the Mac and cheese and the fluff of the red velvet waffle was mind blowing. I truly can't think of one thing I would change about this place. It was everything I wanted in a Sunday brunch spot and more. Will definitely be coming back and telling everyone and their mama's about this place! Ps. We made reservations, not sure how critical they are but the wait did seem a bit long?",5.0
"One of the best brunch spots in Brooklyn!My friends were in town visiting for my birthday and wanted to take me to brunch. I told them we had to come to SoCo!We each got something different based on all my favorites. We tried each other's food and everyone was pleased. We also did the endless mimosas. The shrimp and grits is my favorite, the red velvet waffle w/ fried chicken is a close second!Good food. Good drink. My kind of Saturday afternoon!",5.0
"FAVORITE spot for a tried and true Sunday dinner. You cannot go wrong with anything (and I mean anything) on this menu.

"SoCo seems to be confused on what they want to be, to me at least. Design is modern - almost fast-food like in a sense, but food is hearty with southern roots.Don't get me wrong, it's modern, clean and spacious -  it just does not come together for some reason. We had chicken on top of red velvet waffle and some sides. Chicken was decent, but nothing outstanding, waffle was a bit too soft and too big - I only managed to eat quarter of it. Okra and tomatoes side was really good (and I normally do not like okra), but 509 Salad fell short, there was practically two little bits of kale in it, otherwise it was just regular Caesar salad... Mac n Cheese was just OK - presentation was good, tho, in small cast iron skillet.You get free corn bread with yelp-check in, and it was pretty good (anything with melting butter on top is good!)I did enjoy dessert very much. Called Mini brownie S'more, it's molten chocolate cake (it should be a little more runnier, imo), toasted marshmallow on top and vanilla ice cream - very good ice cream.All and all it a fun place to hang out with friends.",4.0

I've had the Salmon Burger, Lobster, Shrimp, & Grits, Chicken and Red Velvet Waffles, F-Que Wings, and the Mac and Cheese. My husband has had the Short Ribs, Blackend Salmon, Baby Back Ribs, Short Ribs Pizza, and Steak Frites. We have no complaints. The service has always been good even when we've brought our baby who one time wasn't that well behaved, the staff treated us no differently and were very accommodating of our needs.

"Visited on a Saturday nightThis is literally a place to go to if you just want to go out. It is a great atmosphere the music is more for people going on dates but still enjoyable.

"The food at this restaurant is really good. I ordered chicken and waffles and had a little to bite off of everyone else's food at the table. I love the twist on fries too with parmesan cheese added. It's really good. My reason for deducting a star was for the wait with a reservation. Although we made one for 8, we were not seated until 9:15.

We were seated at the back of the restaurant and although it was a windy day, it was super warm because of the glass ceiling. It made me wish I had sunglasses on me and one side of my face was probably getting a tan. It would have been better if we sat inside or in a shady area of the patio.But that mac and cheese doe... So cheesy that the liquid cheese coated every bit of cavatappi, while the top was slightly browned from the oven, and overflowing from the iron skillet. Seriously, I repeat, it is the cheesiest mac and cheese ever.The famed buttermilk fried chicken with a red velvet waffle was decent. The chicken itself was good with Frankie's RedHot (yeah, I WILL put that ___ on everything). If only the waffle was crispier.My organic BBQ chicken had a yummy tangy sauce and was pretty moist, although the mashed potatoes were pretty bland.

I ordered the molasses braised short ribs with collard greens & garlic mashed potatoes. It was soooo good!!! My friend had the lobster, shrimp & grits (another amazing entree). For dessert, we had the s'mores, yummy! Overall, I will give SoCo a 5 star rating. I will soon be returning to try their signature dish: Chicken & waffles.

The decor is simple but elegant enough to make you feel comfortable in a jacket or post-work wear. It's soul food based menu is well priced and not too large, which is always a good sign of a well run kitchen. Every person who works here is not only professional and seemingly well trained, but friendly and personable. Incredible! I felt relaxed and comfortable from the minute I walked in the door to the last bite of my meal. I ordered the chicken and waffles (I'm a vegetarian but apparently since it's their signature item, they wouldn't just give me waffles) and the mango sweet tea (AMAZING BTW) along with their famous mac n cheese, which is so delicious and filling.

"Came here for brunch on a beeeaauuutiful Saturday afternoon, which I'm inclined to mention due to what seems like a never ending winter. My group of 6 were seated indoors, all the way in the back, and right by the glass screen windows with a view of the outdoor dining area. A great table. 4 of my friends immediately decided to get the famed Red Velvet Waffles and Fried Chicken. Fortunately for me, I like but don't love chicken and waffles (if I've blasphemed, have mercy) and with a majority of my friends ordering them, I didn't feel guilty about wanting to try something else. Also, with 4 plates of possible leftovers to choose from, I felt like I was safe. (P.S. I did have a bite, and yes, they were waffle-tastic).I ultimately went with the Sausage and Grits and regret, I did not. Chicken andouille, fresh tomatoes, and scrambled eggs atop cheddar grits bathed in a lobster broth. Just wonderful! Not having grown up eating grits, I guess I don't have a taste for what good grits should really taste like nor do I have a great love of them but these grits here were savory enough for me to really enjoy. That plus the andouille? mMmm. And oh yeah, $14 unlimited mimosas. Chug away but pinky out.",4.0

"Came here with friends for a friend's birthday.  Came right when it opened and there was a line already outside waiting for them to open.  We had a reservation thankfully.Upon sitting down, we made our order.  The waitress was fantastic!  I ordered the Bourbon St Mango Juice which was delicious.  Pretty sweet but not overly so.  It was that alcoholic though, would have liked it to be a bit more.I also ordered the Steak N' Eggs and it was just delicious.  Would definitely order this again.  The steak was not overly thick but it was still done medium rare which I was astonished by.  Usually a thinner steak ive always found it hard for restaurants to cook them medium rare correctly.  The spinach, and potatoes were great and they did the egg exactly as requested (over medium).Also ordered the F-Que Wings for appetizers and that was also done very well, it was moist and flavorful.  My friends ordered the Lobster Shrimp & Grits and the Chicken & Waffle.  The Lobster with Grits I didnt really enjoy.  They had butter in the grits and I am not a fan of a heavy butter taste.  My friends who ordered stated the shrimp and lobster was overcooked and it resulted in a tough and chewy taste to the meat.  Also the grit was very heavy.  They were just ok with it.The Chicken and Waffles was enjoyed by everyone.  The chicken was fantastic and the waffles was sweet on its own so didnt need too much syrup.Also we were able to check in to get some free corn bread for the group!Overall this was a great place to go for some good southern food.  Highly recommended!",4.0

"I must be the only person not in love with this place. But I have been two times and both times I swear I could have spent less money elsewhere and gotten better food. Their drinks are decent; the red velvet waffles are just red waffles and the chicken is blah. The mashed sweet potatoes legit taste like baby food, like pure gerber; I had to give them away and order a $10 side of Mac and Cheese. The Mac and Cheese is bomb, but that's pretty much the only bomb item on the menu. The atmosphere is good though.",2.0
"SoCo is sooo good! Besides the fact that its name reminds me of Southern Comfort, their food is excellent and their staff is pretty great as well. Not to mention it is within walking distance of my apartment, you cannot beat that. Now my friend and I had been dying to check this place out for a solid month before we actually were able to; she was sick, I had to work a lot, etc etc. So we were very excited that on a damp Wednesday afternoon our dreams about SoCo finally became true. It did take a bit of time for us to be seated; no one was really aroun. When we finally got someone's attention we were seated. They had a wine special that evening; everybody gets to sample a free glass of wine, now that's awesome. I don't think I have ever been to a place where they did that. I ordered the salmon burger, it was unbelievable, cooked perfectly and had just the right amount of flavor. My friend ordered the chicken and waffles that was on a red velvet waffle. I tried a bit it was so sweet and delicious in every way. Dare I say it; they were the best chicken and waffles I have ever tasted. When we were ready to leave again it took us awhile to get someone's attention so we could get our check. Overall it was a pretty excellent experience and the food was great.

"This is the place to go!!! For brunch , I haven't been for dinner or lunch . So for $15 you get unlimited mimosas and not just 2 or 3 but they COME AROUND , if u drink half ur glass the waiters come around and fill you up again , so basically best $15 ever spent lol. Now the food is great too can't compain about anything , they are known for their red velvet waffles and fried chicken which I never got but my friends have and they love it ,I've gotten steak and eggs which the steak was phenomenal cooked exactly how U want but they put it over spinach which I'm not a fan of , I've also gotten ceasar salad with shrimp but I really did not like it but only because they put the shrimp in BBQ sauce which is not my think but to their defense this is a southern food restaurant, over all fun and just Make sure u make reservations for brunch otherwise u will be waiting for an hour or more !",5.0
"The food was pretty good. Of course, I got the famous chicken and waffle. Was able to redeem the free cornbread offer with ease. I went with a group of 10 and despite having reservations I feel like it took a really long time to be seated . The drinks weren't amazing either, especially for the price. Probably will not be going here again unless someone else is treating.",3.0

I've come here twice for brunch and once for lunch. If you're coming here for Sunday Brunch you MUST make a reservation. The walk-in wait is 30mins to an hour sometimes more. Food & drink: I always go with the bottomless mimosa. Start off with the wings. Then go for the fried chicken and red velvet waffles. Now it's not the best chicken and waffles I've had...but it's pretty good. Would I go back? I damn sure would. Lol Would I recommend it? I have and I will continue doing it. Lol,4.0

"Came here with friends for a friend's birthday.  Came right when it opened and there was a line already outside waiting for them to open.  We had a reservation thankfully.Upon sitting down, we made our order.  The waitress was fantastic!  I ordered the Bourbon St Mango Juice which was delicious.  Pretty sweet but not overly so.  It was that alcoholic though, would have liked it to be a bit more.I also ordered the Steak N' Eggs and it was just delicious.  Would definitely order this again.  The steak was not overly thick but it was still done medium rare which I was astonished by.  Usually a thinner steak ive always found it hard for restaurants to cook them medium rare correctly.  The spinach, and potatoes were great and they did the egg exactly as requested (over medium).Also ordered the F-Que Wings for appetizers and that was also done very well, it was moist and flavorful.  My friends ordered the Lobster Shrimp & Grits and the Chicken & Waffle.  The Lobster with Grits I didnt really enjoy.  They had butter in the grits and I am not a fan of a heavy butter taste.  My friends who ordered stated the shrimp and lobster was overcooked and it resulted in a tough and chewy taste to the meat.  Also the grit was very heavy.  They were just ok with it.The Chicken and Waffles was enjoyed by everyone.  The chicken was fantastic and the waffles was sweet on its own so didnt need too much syrup.Also we were able to check in to get some free corn bread for the group!Overall this was a great place to go for some good southern food.  Highly recommended!",4.0
"Heard so many great thing about this place and a few of them actually were! Met a few friends here and took advantage of Yelp Check-In for our free cornbread. Yum!

"I must be the only person not in love with this place. But I have been two times and both times I swear I could have spent less money elsewhere and gotten better food. Their drinks are decent; the red velvet waffles are just red waffles and the chicken is blah. The mashed sweet potatoes legit taste like baby food, like pure gerber; I had to give them away and order a $10 side of Mac and Cheese. The Mac and Cheese is bomb, but that's pretty much the only bomb item on the menu. The atmosphere is good though.",2.0
"SoCo is sooo good! Besides the fact that its name reminds me of Southern Comfort, their food is excellent and their staff is pretty great as well. Not to mention it is within walking distance of my apartment, you cannot beat that. Now my friend and I had been dying to check this place out for a solid month before we actually were able to; she was sick, I had to work a lot, etc etc. So we were very excited that on a damp Wednesday afternoon our dreams about SoCo finally became true. It did take a bit of time for us to be seated; no one was really aroun. When we finally got someone's attention we were seated. They had a wine special that evening; everybody gets to sample a free glass of wine, now that's awesome. I don't think I have ever been to a place where they did that. I ordered the salmon burger, it was unbelievable, cooked perfectly and had just the right amount of flavor. My friend ordered the chicken and waffles that was on a red velvet waffle. I tried a bit it was so sweet and delicious in every way. Dare I say it; they were the best chicken and waffles I have ever tasted.

"SoCo calls itself ""Southern Fusion,"" and I'm sort of confused as to what that means, or rather, why it makes a point to call itself fusion. I think it means Southern, soul food, cajun and creole all at once, but don't all the restaurants that serve this food up north sort of count as fusion, then? They're all a mishmash of the regional cuisine. Came here for a late dinner, and boy, does this place look like a scene! Looks like a trendy spot. I felt a little underdressed.The service was slow. We arrived a little after 10pm, and our drinks probably took 15 minutes to arrive, and all we ordered were beers. It took a little longer to get our orders put in, too. We started with some appetizers, which included greens, corn bread, and mac & cheese. The greens and corn bread were unmemorable, but the mac & cheese was stellar: perfectly crusted on the top and gooey in the middle. It came piping hot from a mini-cast iron skillet. They do have a free cornbread Yelp deal here if you order an entree, which is nice.After polishing off our appetizers, we waited another long time to get our entrees. The service was just slowww. Our entrees, when they did arrive, were great. I had the fried chicken and waffles, which were incredibly good. My wife had the mussels, which she enjoyed. Others had the salmon burger, which they polished off neatly. Everyone was happy, except for the slow service. I don't quite know how this might be solved. More bartenders? More servers? I suppose it's fine if you're not in any rush, but it was noticeable. Dinner shouldn't take 2 hours unless the guests want it to take that long.",4.0

"Came here with a group of 12, and we only had to wait an hour on a Sunday night; that's really not bad at all!  We cannot chronicle everything the group had, although they were mostly positive reviews. We had the chicken and red velvet waffles and the blackened salmon along with small helpings of a shared Mac n Cheese.  The blackened salmon was very good, very moist and well seasoned without it being too spicy.  The red velvet waffles and fried chicken looked amazing, and tasted pretty good.  Don't expect too much of a red velvet flavor as typical in most cupcakes.  Red velvet really only indicates the color and nothing about the batter itself.  Typical waffle batter with red color is all it really is.  The chicken, as best as I can remember, was good.Most interesting tidbit about this restaurant is the polarity of the customers to the ambience.  Restaurant sells southern comfort food, but looks like a high end trendy restaurant on Park Ave.  The place is cleanly decorated and the staff is dressed very chic.  There was even a violin player the night we were there.  It almost felt like the place should be serving small pretentious meals on little platters.  However, customers are very casual and laid back, there is no dress code but there is no discomfort shown by either side.  Very interesting spot and very good food.",4.0

"Decent food but I've had much better. I kept hearing about the chicken and waffles but the dish was mediocre. First off it was way over priced ($20), and the portion of chicken was very small for a supposedly ""southern style"" restaurant. It also wasn't unique in any way... Just your ordinary fried chicken that you could get anywhere in NYC for probably $14 cheaper. The waffle was good but again nothing special. We also the Mac and cheese which was the highlight of the entire meal. It's big enough to share amongst 3 people. Lastly the service was horrendous. We asked the waiter for suggestions off the menu and he literally listed every single item saying it was good. We didn't find it to be helpul. Once we ordered, about 30 mins went by before we asked about the food. Our waiter said the food would be right out; however, it took another 25 mins before it was at the table. The whole operation seemed a bit disorganized, and the staff were not professional. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. Oh and they will add 18% gratuity to your bill even if you only have a party of 3.",2.0
"Let me first start by saying the food is exceptional; however, I can do without the manager ! The vibe was totally off.My friend made a reservation for 2pm on Sunday for 6 people. When we arrived we were told to stand near the side by one host. We waited and waited. Another family walked in 10 mins later with a reservation and were seated right away. This immediately made me upset so I spoke with another guy in the booth who I believe was the manager. He asked if my party was there and where the others were. They were in the bathroom but my other friend was on the way. He told me they were clearing a table for us. We were seated at 2:25. When we were being seated I informed the host we would not be having the 6th person join us (she canceled because something came up). A minute later the manager walked back there to ""check"" the back, but he came straight to our table to inquire about our 6th person then stated ""that's why you all were waiting because you didn't have your whole party, next time tell us that"". There will be no next time for me. That was so unnecessary and unprofessional.I could do without his condescending tone. He tried to  justify why we had to wait 25 mins to be seated when we had a reservation. That defeated the purpose of a reservation and they assumed we were all there so we waited because THEY FORGOT ! Besides the unprofessional manager not talking responsibility , the waitress informed us they ran out of cornbread (so the offer from yelp was null and void), French toast, and mussels. It was only 2:30 and they had opened at noon so that is unacceptable. Recommendations:The Chicken and waffles , sangria, chicken andouille and grits! They're all excellent dishes.",2.0

"MY LIFE NEVER FELT SO COMPLETE! This is by far my FAVORITE place to go for some real delicious soul food. I suppose it's a good thing I live so far from it... Otherwise, I would frequent this place so much I would become obese... No, I'm kidding. But SoCo really is something. For starters, we had the cornbread. Initially, I wasn't too thrilled about it because we had to pay $5 for a basket of 3... I thought cornbread was complimentary (or at least cheaper)! But it all made sense when I bit into it. Not to mention, the complimentary butter gave it a sweet surprise. We also got the mac and cheese (a side dish) and we split it amongst the three of us. The dish alone didn't look that big, but it was enough to feed... I would say at least 4. I have no idea which cheeses they used but they made it so damn good. It was so creamy and cheesy. More to say, they baked the mac so it had a pleasant crunch on the top... Mmmm....YUM!Last but not least, I got the chicken and waffle. I mean... come on, I had to! It was a red velvet waffle! Since they placed the chicken right on top of the waffle, it lost its crunch but it was still good... Not your typical chicken and waffle. Just be mindful of their business hours when you plan to visit. I came in on a Saturday afternoon and they take a break from 3:30 to 5:00. Customers can still stay to eat but they won't seat anytime in between that time gap. If I remember correctly, Aaron was our server and he did a great job! It was quite obvious that he was extremely busy but he checked in with us from time to time to see if everything was okay. I forgot to mention but I ordered the Saturday Brunch Mimosa Special ($14 for unlimited mimosa for an hour) and Aaron never failed to refill my cup. Yay for great service!",5.0

"Went to SoCo for a quick bite with my husband. Restaurant  was pretty empty when we arrived around 6:30pm on a Friday. Asked the host for a table, he asked if we had a reservation. I immediately   thought why, this place is empty. But smiled and said no. He then checked  his reservations and said he could accommodate  us. I thought to myself ""uh yeah.""We both had the BBQ chicken with mashed potatoes  and   collared  greens. We also ordered corn bread (free with a check-in) and mac and cheese.  I had the Hibiscus Margarita and he had Grand Marnier neat .Atmosphere was cool. The food was good the chicken didn't taste like true   bbq it was more like her chicken  remix and on the dry side, everything  was pretty good . My libations  were great on strength. Hibiscus  and tequila tasted like bourbon  which I wasn't   expecting ,but busted it down none the less.",3.0
"Pre Valentines Day dinner with my wife. This place had a nice crowd so if you do want to eat here, a reservation is highly recommended. Since we got there 30 minutes before our reservation time, they were really cordial and got us a table 15 minutes early. For drinks, I stuck with Apple Cider draft beer and my wife started with Honey Jack and cola then Rum and Cola. Kudos to the bar for the cold beer and well balanced drinks. We decided to do one appetizer and had the California Shrimp roll, delicious. Only wish they would put six rolls instead of five lol. Our entrees, I had the Buttermilk Batter Fried Chicken with red velvet waffle and garlic sautéd string beans and my wife had the chef special which was a surf and turf with nice rib eye, lobster tail, mashed potatoes and Brussel sprouts. Of course, we shared each others dishes like any modest couple lol. I'm not a fan of brussel sprouts but these were delicious with a nice bok choy style flavor. String beans, waffle, rib eye, mash, all the food was good. Lobster tail was slightly over cooked but was still good. Fried chicken was OK but I have reservations about it. Dessert, cheesecake and smore, both delicious and best part, not overly sweet but perfect taste. Our server was most excellent and entertaining and made the night even more delightful and we thank him for keeping it with us. Look forward to another visit in the future.",4.0
"I dined at Soco BK for Sunday brunch to celebrate my birthday with a party of 11. We had to wait a bit due to some mix up with our reservation however the host quickly resolved the issue and we were seated reasonably quickly.Our server Alex was great and provided excellent service. We had a birthday cake and the waiters brought it out with candles provided by SoCo. It was touching that they were so attentive as I forgot to bring candles with me.As far as the food, I tried the steamed mussels and had the sweet potato pancakes both of which were delicious.The decor is nice and hip, however the space is tight, and it is not easy for dinning with infants or toddlers.Overall, though, it was great experience!",4.0
"Excellent! I enjoyed my meal and the hospitality of the service. My reservation for three online was granted and I had no wait time. My girlfriends and I had a great girl's nite out at Soco. I really enjoyed the appetizers cornbread & fried macaroni pie. The red velvet chicken and waffle dish was recommended by the server and was delish. My drink, the peach cobbler libation was great. Good taste with the right amount of alcohol. I would definitely come back. I see reservations work there, so I'll make sure to reserve again for my next visit.",5.0
"Decent food but I've had much better. I kept hearing about the chicken and waffles but the dish was mediocre. First off it was way over priced ($20), and the portion of chicken was very small for a supposedly ""southern style"" restaurant. It also wasn't unique in any way... Just your ordinary fried chicken that you could get anywhere in NYC for probably $14 cheaper. The waffle was good but again nothing special. We also the Mac and cheese which was the highlight of the entire meal. It's big enough to share amongst 3 people. Lastly the service was horrendous. We asked the waiter for suggestions off the menu and he literally listed every single item saying it was good. We didn't find it to be helpul. Once we ordered, about 30 mins went by before we asked about the food. Our waiter said the food would be right out; however, it took another 25 mins before it was at the table. The whole operation seemed a bit disorganized, and the staff were not professional. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. Oh and they will add 18% gratuity to your bill even if you only have a party of 3.",2.0
"Let me first start by saying the food is exceptional; however, I can do without the manager ! The vibe was totally off.My friend made a reservation for 2pm on Sunday for 6 people. When we arrived we were told to stand near the side by one host. We waited and waited. Another family walked in 10 mins later with a reservation and were seated right away. This immediately made me upset so I spoke with another guy in the booth who I believe was the manager. He asked if my party was there and where the others were. They were in the bathroom but my other friend was on the way. He told me they were clearing a table for us. We were seated at 2:25. When we were being seated I informed the host we would not be having the 6th person join us (she canceled because something came up). A minute later the manager walked back there to ""check"" the back, but he came straight to our table to inquire about our 6th person then stated ""that's why you all were waiting because you didn't have your whole party, next time tell us that"". There will be no next time for me. That was so unnecessary and unprofessional.I could do without his condescending tone. He tried to  justify why we had to wait 25 mins to be seated when we had a reservation. That defeated the purpose of a reservation and they assumed we were all there so we waited because THEY FORGOT ! Besides the unprofessional manager not talking responsibility , the waitress informed us they ran out of cornbread (so the offer from yelp was null and void), French toast, and mussels. It was only 2:30 and they had opened at noon so that is unacceptable. Recommendations:The Chicken and waffles , sangria, chicken andouille and grits! They're all excellent dishes.",2.0
"Love! Love! Love! Came here for family brunch and everything was perfect. Since we entered the restaurant the guy at the front was very nice, greeted us were seated right away. Took no time for our waiter Alex to come over and introduce himself and get us drinks. He was amazing, took our order and always came back to check on us but not excessive he gave us space to enjoy the meal..which I loved. Brunch came  it was delicious everyone order something different so we can try a little of everything and were very satisfied.   I would recommend this place and look forward to eating here again!",5.0
"MY LIFE NEVER FELT SO COMPLETE! This is by far my FAVORITE place to go for some real delicious soul food. I suppose it's a good thing I live so far from it... Otherwise, I would frequent this place so much I would become obese... No, I'm kidding. But SoCo really is something. For starters, we had the cornbread. Initially, I wasn't too thrilled about it because we had to pay $5 for a basket of 3... I thought cornbread was complimentary (or at least cheaper)! But it all made sense when I bit into it. Not to mention, the complimentary butter gave it a sweet surprise. We also got the mac and cheese (a side dish) and we split it amongst the three of us. The dish alone didn't look that big, but it was enough to feed... I would say at least 4. I have no idea which cheeses they used but they made it so damn good. It was so creamy and cheesy. More to say, they baked the mac so it had a pleasant crunch on the top... Mmmm....YUM!Last but not least, I got the chicken and waffle. I mean... come on, I had to! It was a red velvet waffle! Since they placed the chicken right on top of the waffle, it lost its crunch but it was still good... Not your typical chicken and waffle. Just be mindful of their business hours when you plan to visit. I came in on a Saturday afternoon and they take a break from 3:30 to 5:00. Customers can still stay to eat but they won't seat anytime in between that time gap. If I remember correctly, Aaron was our server and he did a great job! It was quite obvious that he was extremely busy but he checked in with us from time to time to see if everything was okay. I forgot to mention but I ordered the Saturday Brunch Mimosa Special ($14 for unlimited mimosa for an hour) and Aaron never failed to refill my cup. Yay for great service!",5.0
"Whatever you do, make sure you have the ribs! Just absolutely delicious! I plan to take all my friends here, especially for the ribs. Parmesan fries are also delicious. I had a burger which was ok but the cheesecake at the end was the BOMB! Drinks are great too!We had to wait an hour but it was fine, we had some drinks at the bar until we got a table.Our waiter had a minor screw up with our bill but my overall experience was so great that I took it in stride. You won't go wrong with Soco. I highly recommend this place.",5.0
Great for a night date or lunch date nice strong drinks great food what more can you ask for?! Love the food here! My favorite spot to introduce to my friends. Only thing is the sautéed collards need seasoning.,4.0
"Went to SoCo for a quick bite with my husband. Restaurant  was pretty empty when we arrived around 6:30pm on a Friday. Asked the host for a table, he asked if we had a reservation. I immediately   thought why, this place is empty. But smiled and said no. He then checked  his reservations and said he could accommodate  us. I thought to myself ""uh yeah.""We both had the BBQ chicken with mashed potatoes  and   collared  greens. We also ordered corn bread (free with a check-in) and mac and cheese.  I had the Hibiscus Margarita and he had Grand Marnier neat .Atmosphere was cool. The food was good the chicken didn't taste like true   bbq it was more like her chicken  remix and on the dry side, everything  was pretty good . My libations  were great on strength. Hibiscus  and tequila tasted like bourbon  which I wasn't   expecting ,but busted it down none the less.",3.0

The first time I went here I was in heaven. The Mac n cheese was probably the best I've had when it comes to flavor. Definitely worth a try. The chicken and waffles were good. The red velvet waffle is sweet enough no syrup needed. It actually tastes like cake batter. The chick was crispy yet moist. They didn't ask what kind of meat we wanted but we asked for white meat and they accommodated us. The atmosphere is nice I liked to sit outside but not really being outside since the weather is not right just yet. The second time we went ordering the same thing we were disappointed. The chicken was sweet almost like a coconut skin taste. The waffle tasted more plain not sweet as before. We were thinking maybe a different cook. Their sandwiches look good maybe I'll try that next. The great thing is both times we've went was during the week and parking was easy and not wait to be seated.,4.0

"I came here only once for Saturday Brunch.Food: I had the red velvet waffle with the fried chicken and the Mac and cheese. The waffle was very sweet, a little too sweet for my liking. The fried chicken was very moist including the skin, but I like my fried chicken very crispy (3 small pieces of chicken). The Mac and cheese on the other hand was a ginormous portion, almost a meal on itself. It was crispy and cheesy, just the way I like it. My friend ordered the home fries and I didn't like it because by the time it cooled down, it wasn't appetizing (we sat there for a while). We also had the mimosa special which is $14 for unlimited mimosas for an hour (Saturdays only I believe) Atmosphere: We sat outside for brunch, it's very cute (decor wise) outside and in. The place is filled with lots of fashionable and interesting people. Service: From the bartender to the waitress they were both very attentive and helpful. The waitress always kept my glass full of mimosas!!! Overall: This place is cute for brunch but a little $$. We paid over $40 each for 2 dishes and mimosas.

They do like to take their time in terms of serving their customers but brunch time is lazy time, right?The crispy pork sandwich is quite small but the tenderness of the pork infused with the sweet flavors of the sauce on top of the baguette is amazing. The pork breaks apart easily. And you can see the layer of fat oozing out as well as the crispy layer of pork skin.Then there was the mac and cheese. Oh my... Where do I start? So delicious without being too runny. Perfect portions of cheese to pasta. And it's baked so that you get a crunchy layer of charred cheese to top it all off. Damn, you were bangin' it!...AND THEN there was the fried chicken and red velvet waffle. Where do I even begin with you?!? The fried chicken was so crispy yet juicy at the same time. It was mind boggling! And 3 delicious crunchy pieces on top of my red velvet waffle? Oh yeahhh!! The oil from the chicken added some more flavor to the waffle even though it was already flavorful. The waffle was done just right - slightly sweetened and soft without being too moist or dry. And a little bit of powdered sugar to top it all off.I don't care if you're in the middle of nowhere, I am sooo coming back for you!",4.0

The fried chicken was very moist including the skin, but I like my fried chicken very crispy (3 small pieces of chicken). The Mac and cheese on the other hand was a ginormous portion, almost a meal on itself. It was crispy and cheesy, just the way I like it. My friend ordered the home fries and I didn't like it because by the time it cooled down, it wasn't appetizing (we sat there for a while). We also had the mimosa special which is $14 for unlimited mimosas for an hour (Saturdays only I believe) Atmosphere: We sat outside for brunch, it's very cute (decor wise) outside and in. The place is filled with lots of fashionable and interesting people. Service: From the bartender to the waitress they were both very attentive and helpful. The waitress always kept my glass full of mimosas!!! Overall: This place is cute for brunch but a little $$. We paid over $40 each for 2 dishes and mimosas. There are a ton of places all over NYC with amazing specials for Brunch. I wish this place offered a better brunch special. But I'm willing to come back when I have a fat wallet.",3.0
"I made a reservation and arrive a bit earlier. However, we didn't get seated until a bit past our reservation time even though there were open spots at the restaurant.Service is good but a tad slow. They do like to take their time in terms of serving their customers but brunch time is lazy time, right?The crispy pork sandwich is quite small but the tenderness of the pork infused with the sweet flavors of the sauce on top of the baguette is amazing. The pork breaks apart easily. And you can see the layer of fat oozing out as well as the crispy layer of pork skin.Then there was the mac and cheese. Oh my... Where do I start? So delicious without being too runny. Perfect portions of cheese to pasta. And it's baked so that you get a crunchy layer of charred cheese to top it all off. Damn, you were bangin' it!...AND THEN there was the fried chicken and red velvet waffle. Where do I even begin with you?!? The fried chicken was so crispy yet juicy at the same time. It was mind boggling! And 3 delicious crunchy pieces on top of my red velvet waffle? Oh yeahhh!! The oil from the chicken added some more flavor to the waffle even though it was already flavorful. The waffle was done just right - slightly sweetened and soft without being too moist or dry. And a little bit of powdered sugar to top it all off.I don't care if you're in the middle of nowhere, I am sooo coming back for you!",4.0
"We decided to pop in for Sunday brunch after hearing great reviews .... Well I have to say I was soooo pleased with everything from the decor to the service and most importantly the Food we ordered cocktails can't recall the names of them but they where excellent! We ordered the Cesar salad with corn bread croutons I know what your thinking corn bread croutons ?!? But they where excellent . For our main course we ordered there signature red velvet Waffle's and fried chicken it was tasty and well executed from start to finish we also ordered the wings and Mac n cheese both well prepared and decedent , before I end this review I would like to elaborate on the Mac n cheese it was served in a cast iron skillet the presentation was beautiful and tasted great I appreciated there spin on it, with a nice hint of garlic that added a surprising kick ... I will most definitely re -visit Soco again excited to see what else they have to offer!! By far one of the best gems in Brooklyn!!!!!!",5.0
"After reading many great reviews I decided to check this place out with a friend who was visiting from Boston. Overall, we had a nice Sunday brunch. We beat the crowd by arriving at 12:30. By the time we left nearly an hour later there was a wait out the door.We both ordered the red velvet chicken and waffles, which were in my opinion solid. I wasn't in love with the waffle, but the chicken was cooked perfectly - crunchy skin, moist inside, and easy to pull apart. As sides we ordered grits and collard greens. Being a southern girl, I've learned not to expect too much from these things so I'll say they were good, but nothing like grandma's.

"My neighborhood go to spot ! I love  this place ! If you have a sweet tooth,  the Buttermilk Fried chicken and red velvet waffles are excellent ! I find them too sweet . I prefer the lobster shrimp and grits ... and of course the Mac and cheese . The small cast iron pan is enough for several people and well worth the wait . Unlimited mimosas on Saturdays for brunch ( made the mistake of coming Sunday and was disappointed ) !I've had the mussels as an appetizer , slightly spicy  and a nice serving size . I had some type of chicken wings as an appetizer (can't remember the name ) but wasn't crazy about them . I wish I could  say more about the menu , but I eat the same dish almost all the time I'm here :) Consistency at its best!  It's always crowded in here and reservations are a must unless you are here during the week at 5:30pm when they begin serving dinner .I think your whole party needs to be here at the same time to be seated .. It's small as a back enclosed patio ..They also do lunch too !  The vibe is urban chic and drinks are good too !",5.0

"I came to SOCO last week Wednesday with a girlfriend of mine right after the after the opening for dinner time. The ambiance was as usual nice and soft we were seated in the back room which was fine. Greeted by our server shortly there after if not right away and that was great. As it should there weren't many people in the restaurant. We ordered the mango lemonade & blueberry lemonade.. Great choices We ordered the Mac n Cheese which was superb as usual... My friend ordered the Shrimp, lobster & grits. She loved it although she couldn't finish it due to the macaroni coma. I've had the grits before and this time around it was sweeter almost like a Farina sweet. It wasnt bad at all but different. I prefer it the way it was before (less sweet more gritty if that makes sense) because the sweetness was slightly overpowering.. But everything on the dish was amazing otherwise.I had the Jumbalaya which was epic.. That also changed too or maybe just that night but it was more ricey and not as much of that soup/gravy rice feel that I've had before.. But it's cool the dish was great!!! The regular andouille is now chicken andouille which is totally fine now I can bring the dish to my friends who don't eat pork.. I also didn't finish my dish due to the Mac n Cheese comatose ..

"Soco- I will start with the good then go onto the not so good.I went for lunch, the menu was rather limited but everyone enjoyed their entrees. I ordered the chicken sandwich on brioche. The chicken was juicy, tasted fresh, and the bun made it even tastier. I also ordered the Mac n cheese to share. $10 is pricey for a side of Mac n cheese in my opinion, but it was enough for 3 people to share. I also tasted the shrimp in grits and the sliders which both were very good!The service was poor. There was only one waiter working, with atleast 10 tables there at that time. The hostess took over and became our server. I requested a salad instead of fries with my meal. She had to check and make sure that was possible (when the menu offered this option). The salad was simply mixed greens drowned in dressing. I couldn't even get 1 slice of tomato smh. They forgot our Mac n cheese, by time this came out we were finishing up our meals, then had to wait even longer for the waitress to bring us bowls. We had to ask for our water to be refilled.

"I ate my weight in mac n cheese at SoCo last night, which was, in a word, euphoric. We walked in at 9:45 p.m. on a Saturday night and had no problem being quickly seated for dinner. We were promptly informed of the no hat policy, before even making it to our table or having time to remove our winter jackets. Tip to SoCo: let your patrons remove their winter gear if it is freezing outside before harassing them to remove their harmless knit hats. It's a silly policy to begin with. But I digress, because the hat hang-up is my only complaint of SoCo.We were seated in the rear atrium area of the restaurant, which had a nice ambiance: a long wood bench and tables, great lighting, low noise level, perfect for date conversation. Our server (I believe her name was Crystal), was sweet and attentive, and quickly delivered water and beverages. For dinner, we skipped apps since I knew mac n cheese was close in our future. I ordered the skirt steak cooked medium, which was served atop roasted potatoes and collard greens. I don't usually like collard greens as I feel most restaurants prepare them too sweetly (not sure what they're cooked in!), but SoCo prepared them so well, I loved them. My boyfriend got the smoked bbq chicken, served with mashed potatoes and green beans - also very good. But the star of the show was the Aunt Cruz's mac n cheese: order this and you will never want anyone else's mac n cheese again. Served in a small skillet for sharing, the cheese is browned on top for a little crunch, and once you break that top later it is all creamy cheesy goodness underneath -- worth the trip to Brooklyn, no matter where you are!",4.0

Interesting place for a first visit. The lighting in the back a couple of spot lights that will have you squinting. The seating is tight depending on what your expecting. You will be listening to others conversation and them yours. The decor is of like sitting out back on a patio under a glass roof..The sweet tea is a must. If you like sweey that is. I had pork chop with collar greens and mash. And wife had chicken and waffles. Both orders cooked very good. Chicken was juicy on inside. And crunchy outside. And the pork chop..hmm..

"When I first heard about SoCo, I pictured a cozy space with comfort food served by a little old lady. Instead, the space is sleek and modern - in complete opposition to my expectations. I was warmly greeted at the entrance and waited at the bar for the rest of my party to join us. (Side note: I noticed this at the end of the night, but it's a great little touch - outlets underneath the bar, so you can charge up! Yay - it's the little things...)I ordered a SoCo Saint - grapefruit infused gin with St. Germain and grapefruit & lemon juices. It was fine, but seemed light on the alcohol and totally overpriced at $13 for the size of the drink. I switched to sweet tea and water for the rest of the night.For dinner, I had the 509 Caesar Salad. It's billed as a kale and romaine salad with parmesan cheese and cornbread croutons, but I only got the tiniest piece of kale that was not even the size of my pinky nail. It was also fine, but I was disappointed since I was expecting kale. Oh well.Next, Buttermilk Fried Chicken - organic buttermilk fried chicken served with a red velvet waffle. I only ate half of this since I filled up on salad and a piece of tasty, tasty cornbread. While the chicken was good, I thought the waffle could've been crispier. Also, it didn't have that hint of cocoa that I expect from red velvet cake. I was debating on it, but ended up taking the other half home. The chicken reheated well and the waffle tasted better after I crisped it up in my toaster oven.We got the okra & tomato side and shared the mac & cheese. The okra and tomato was surprisingly good. Not slimy and not overdone and mushy. The standout of the meal for me was the mac & cheese. It was the perfect consistency - not runny or dry. Perfectly cheesy and piping hot with a layer of cheese on top. I would travel here just for the mac & cheese!I was way too full for dessert and just took a nibble of the mini Brownie S'more. It was a mini brownie molten chocolate cake with a dollop of toasted marshmallow and a scoop of vanilla ice cream. I found the ice cream bland and the cake overdone. I felt bad, but ended up just giving it back to the waiter. How sad - the smallest dessert ever and I didn't even want to finish it.While the food is mostly lackluster, the service is great. The wait staff kept our glasses full and were just the right amount of attentive.Not sure I'd come back again for dinner. Maybe I'll try brunch, but I'd definitely cruise on by for more of that mac & cheese...",2.0

"Cool soul food restaurant on Mrytle Ave.  Serves up some kick ass Southern Comfort dishes, hence the name SoCo.  Nice, fresh staff and bartenders, cool decor, crowded when I was there.  Not in Brooklyn too often and soul food is not really my thing thing but whenever I'm in BK and in the mood for some good southern cookin...  SoCo gets my patronage.",3.0
"So this place is on a strip of Myrtle ave that doesn't really have much, kinda in the  middle of no mans land really. I guess I would describe the food as a modern spin on Southern food. And don't expect much diversity among the patrons. The food:Aunt Cruz's Mac and Cheese- I am starting with the Mac because it is clearly the best mac ever, it is the mac daddy of all macs. They should make a mac trophy and leave it in the front. They should name the street it's on as the Great Mac Way. They should stop selling everything else and just make mac only, OK maybe I am exaggerating but it's amazing!!! yelp.com/user_local_phot…Buttermilk Fried Chicken- Organic chicken, Red Velvet Waffles. OK you come here for the chicken and waffles but the mac steals the show. The chicken is nice and crisp, the waffle is fluffy and soft and the maple syrup they use is excellent. Don't get me wrong the chicken and waffles is one of the better chicken and waffles out there but I feel like it missed something that blew me away. I like the dish and it's way better than Amy Ruth's, Pies N' thighs, Buttermilk Chanel, etc but still inferior to Stanton Social but theirs is not a traditional one since they use balsamic and corn. yelp.com/user_local_phot…Also, oddly for a restaurant, they kinda have a ""dress code."" No hats allowed and I think no tanks.",4.0
"Delicious!! I've been to a few places for chicken and waffle and this one, so far, is the best! My hubs got the steak and eggs and he finished it in 2seconds. The Mac n Cheese not only looks good, but it is so crunchy, yet tender. Will be coming back",5.0

"This place is well-appointed, with cool decor. The food looked promising as described on the menu but didn't live up to standard expectations (EX the greens are greasy and sweet). Though there was ample staff that were knowledgeable and polite, the service was very poor due to not having enough people working in the kitchen or behind the bar. After being seated at 2:30, we didn't receive our food until 4:00 or our drinks until 3:15! I really wanted to love this place but that kind of time frame is unacceptable. I'm not sure how long a business operating like this can stay in the game. I'd recommend they upgrade their operations/business management and not try to be so ""different"" in the recipes of staple items. I will not be returning or recommending this restaurant to others.",2.0

Each were $14 and definitely didn't warrant an extra $30 on the bill. Wine would have been better.The server was very kind and helpful.",5.0
"When I first heard about SoCo, I pictured a cozy space with comfort food served by a little old lady. Instead, the space is sleek and modern - in complete opposition to my expectations. I was warmly greeted at the entrance and waited at the bar for the rest of my party to join us. (Side note: I noticed this at the end of the night, but it's a great little touch - outlets underneath the bar, so you can charge up! Yay - it's the little things...)I ordered a SoCo Saint - grapefruit infused gin with St. Germain and grapefruit & lemon juices. It was fine, but seemed light on the alcohol and totally overpriced at $13 for the size of the drink. I switched to sweet tea and water for the rest of the night.For dinner, I had the 509 Caesar Salad. It's billed as a kale and romaine salad with parmesan cheese and cornbread croutons, but I only got the tiniest piece of kale that was not even the size of my pinky nail. It was also fine, but I was disappointed since I was expecting kale. Oh well.Next, Buttermilk Fried Chicken - organic buttermilk fried chicken served with a red velvet waffle. I only ate half of this since I filled up on salad and a piece of tasty, tasty cornbread. While the chicken was good, I thought the waffle could've been crispier. Also, it didn't have that hint of cocoa that I expect from red velvet cake. I was debating on it, but ended up taking the other half home. The chicken reheated well and the waffle tasted better after I crisped it up in my toaster oven.We got the okra & tomato side and shared the mac & cheese. The okra and tomato was surprisingly good. Not slimy and not overdone and mushy. The standout of the meal for me was the mac & cheese. It was the perfect consistency - not runny or dry. Perfectly cheesy and piping hot with a layer of cheese on top. I would travel here just for the mac & cheese!I was way too full for dessert and just took a nibble of the mini Brownie S'more. It was a mini brownie molten chocolate cake with a dollop of toasted marshmallow and a scoop of vanilla ice cream. I found the ice cream bland and the cake overdone. I felt bad, but ended up just giving it back to the waiter. How sad - the smallest dessert ever and I didn't even want to finish it.While the food is mostly lackluster, the service is great. The wait staff kept our glasses full and were just the right amount of attentive.Not sure I'd come back again for dinner. Maybe I'll try brunch, but I'd definitely cruise on by for more of that mac & cheese...",2.0
"Food is absolute delicious and the venue makes for the perfect date night or even a night out with the girls. However if you ever try this place for Sunday brunch, make sure you book a reservation or else you will have to wait on a line. Overall, it has a great vibe!",4.0
"Cool soul food restaurant on Mrytle Ave.  Serves up some kick ass Southern Comfort dishes, hence the name SoCo.  Nice, fresh staff and bartenders, cool decor, crowded when I was there.  Not in Brooklyn too often and soul food is not really my thing thing but whenever I'm in BK and in the mood for some good southern cookin...  SoCo gets my patronage.",3.0
"So this place is on a strip of Myrtle ave that doesn't really have much, kinda in the  middle of no mans land really. I guess I would describe the food as a modern spin on Southern food. And don't expect much diversity among the patrons. The food:Aunt Cruz's Mac and Cheese- I am starting with the Mac because it is clearly the best mac ever, it is the mac daddy of all macs. They should make a mac trophy and leave it in the front. They should name the street it's on as the Great Mac Way. They should stop selling everything else and just make mac only, OK maybe I am exaggerating but it's amazing!!! yelp.com/user_local_phot…Buttermilk Fried Chicken- Organic chicken, Red Velvet Waffles. OK you come here for the chicken and waffles but the mac steals the show. The chicken is nice and crisp, the waffle is fluffy and soft and the maple syrup they use is excellent. Don't get me wrong the chicken and waffles is one of the better chicken and waffles out there but I feel like it missed something that blew me away. I like the dish and it's way better than Amy Ruth's, Pies N' thighs, Buttermilk Chanel, etc but still inferior to Stanton Social but theirs is not a traditional one since they use balsamic and corn. yelp.com/user_local_phot…Also, oddly for a restaurant, they kinda have a ""dress code."" No hats allowed and I think no tanks.",4.0
"Delicious!! I've been to a few places for chicken and waffle and this one, so far, is the best! My hubs got the steak and eggs and he finished it in 2seconds. The Mac n Cheese not only looks good, but it is so crunchy, yet tender. Will be coming back",5.0
The food here is good. But I must say when you have it 10times. You can't eat it any more lol.  Nice vibe good drinks and good service.,4.0
"This place is well-appointed, with cool decor. The food looked promising as described on the menu but didn't live up to standard expectations (EX the greens are greasy and sweet). Though there was ample staff that were knowledgeable and polite, the service was very poor due to not having enough people working in the kitchen or behind the bar. After being seated at 2:30, we didn't receive our food until 4:00 or our drinks until 3:15! I really wanted to love this place but that kind of time frame is unacceptable. I'm not sure how long a business operating like this can stay in the game. I'd recommend they upgrade their operations/business management and not try to be so ""different"" in the recipes of staple items. I will not be returning or recommending this restaurant to others.",2.0
"UNACCEPTABLE!! What a rip off!! I am really angry!! Everything is way over priced for its quality. I have been to places where I spend a lot for a brush entree, but I never felt it was expensive because you know when the chef really put their heart in to prepare for every dish. This place is like an empty egg shell man! The place looks young and pretty, but their food is just plain horrible, I can even get better quality food from a deli!!! COME ON!!!First, let start withy the fried chicken. It is extremely small for $20 and beside the price, the chicken is so dried and tasteless!! I can even get better fried chicken at Popeyes and KFC. This is completely messed up! I just don't want to say anything more because if I go on, I could write a thesis paper with all my displease of this place.

"Made a reservation via open table for Tuesday brunch, and was one of the first customers of the day. I guess reservations are necessary on the weekends, but on the weekdays, there are plenty of seats. We had the option of sitting inside or outside, and opted to enjoy the beautiful day. It wasn't exactly outside since there was a clear covering on top incase of rain. Our waiter was superb and awesome. We ordered the red velvet waffle with fried chicken and mac & cheese. WIth the yelp check in, you get a complimentary cornbread. It was really good and because we were so hungry, we scarfed it down really fast. I ordered a sangria, but it wasn't your typical sweet sangria. The waiter let me sample some since it's usually a hit or miss. But I really liked the taste of the lemongrass and thyme infused wine. Also they have happy hour throughout the day, so the sangria was only $6 instead of $8! I originally wanted to come here to try their red velvet waffles, but once I had a bite of their mac & cheese, it was hard to stop. The red velvet waffles were a bit too soft for my liking. I prefer waffles to be a bit more cooked/hard? The syrup was infused with some alcohol and you can definitely taste it. The fried chicken was okay. The mac & cheese was the best dish. If you come here, you MUST get the mac & cheese. Although it's a bit heavy, its worth every bite. We ended up taking some to go along with the fried chicken. Our waiter came by to check up on us ever so often and was so courteous. Parking in the area can be a little hectic since it's on a relatively busy street, but along the side streets you can find some free parking!",4.0
"So I heard so many great things about this place so I decided to stop by. I was greeted by door security and proceeded to wait for a host to approach and seat us. Although it didn't appear to be overwhelmingly busy since my guest and I were the only 2 standing at the door. After 5 minutes of standing around, We were greeted by a kind gentleman that quoted us a 5-10 minute wait. (not bad at all and our waiter found seats for us at the bar) We started off with a soco island drink which was delicious my guest had a Mardi Gras which she enjoyed even though the bartender took her time to greet us. Now on to the food we started with the California spring rolls...they where pretty good something different. We both ordered the Mac and cheese which looked amazing but was extremely dry I had the chicken and red velvet waffles which was not that great at all my guest had the burger which she felt she could have gone to the diner and gotten better. The atmosphere and the customer service is could've been a whole lot better",3.0
"Came here for my boyfriends birthday. I made reservations and as soon as I walked to the host and told him my name I was immediately seated.

We both got drinks i can't remember the names I'm so sorry but his was blue and mine had Hennessy in it I feel like the name was Brooklyn boss or something both drinks were very strong but very good!They also bought out a dessert for my  boyfriend (per my request) it was the strawberry short cake. So good and all the waiters came and sang and it wasn't so scary like most restaurants with like horrible clapping and chanting it was a nice hearty baritone ""Happy birthday to youuuu"" (I feel like some of them were real singers lol)Overall, the experience was awesome and I would not hesitate to go back.

"In November 2014, my boyfriend and I drove 45 minutes from the Bronx to Myrtle Ave, Brooklyn to dine at SoCo--and trust me, it was worth the travel! The food was beautifully plated, and scrumptious. I had their deliciously infamous Organic Buttermilk Fried Chicken and Red Velvet Waffle. It was so good, I can still taste it. The chicken was moist and flavorful; it was a crisp bite on the outside and tender bite on the meat. The waffle held its own, but was perfectly paired with a bourbon maple syrup--ohmigosh--so rich and tasty! The waffle didn't fall apart or get mushy when I covered it in syrup.I don't remember the name of our waiter, but he was very knowledgeable of the menu, and he was very pleasant as well. If only SoCo had a bigger dining room (preferably in an uptown location), then they'd get a fifth star from meNevertheless, I definitely plan on returning!!",4.0
"Came here tonight with friends. My gf and I recently moved into the area and have been ordering in a lot only to find many disappointments. So I'm glad we ended up here tonight bc the food here is so good. I had the Mac and cheese which we all split. It was rich and insanely delicious.

"I was really excited to try SoCo, and they delivered. The food was 5 stars all the way...the macaroni and cheese was transcendent...yes, i realize I'm being hyperbolic, but it was so delicious. The fried chicken and red velvet waffle - the chicken was A+ all the way...the waffle was good, but not amazing. We agreed that it needed something, something to moisten up the meal, other than syrup... I had the salmon, which was cooked exactly how I ordered it, and how I like it, and the presentation was beautiful. We redeemed a yelp check-in deal for free cornbread, and woo hoo, I'm glad we did. That was one of the stand-outs. Delicious! We had cocktails which were tasty, and there was just so much food. It was so good, but I did feel like I might need to be rolled out of the restaurant after dinner, ha! I did boogie my way out, the music was so fun, I was dancing in my seat the entire dinner.Why not 5 stars? The service was decent, not great. I made a reservation on opentable, and we were on time. We walked in, there were no other guests at the host stand, just us, and two employees talking to each other (seemingly about work stuff), they ignored us for about a minute, and then when I looked around (genuinely) confused for a second, I got a terse ""we'll be right with you."" Then when I did give the name/reservation, etc...they asked us to have a seat at the bar, so we do, and my guy's getting the drink menu at the bar, then they tell us the table is ready, it was just kinda choppy for absolutely no reason. One of my pet peeves is when you say you need just another minute or two before ordering and the waiter disappears for 10+ minutes...that happened, to the point where I had to flag him down before he went back into the kitchen again. Our water glasses went empty a few times (and it's not like we weren't drinking cocktails too). It's not a cheap restaurant, and the food is superb, the service needs to be tightened up. That said, everybody who works there is gorgeous, so perhaps I just need to let myself be glamoured...I'll definitely be back.",4.0

"First of all, I would like to apologize for entering this place looking like a hot mess. I was not expecting it to be as fancy as it was. Second, because it was so fancy, I was not expecting the food to be as amazing as it was. Getting that out of the way, I feel like my conscious is clear to continue. Brunch in Brooklyn has always been such a nightmare because there is always a ridiculous wait. But once we entered we were seated right away. However, once we were seated, our waitress disappeared for 10 minutes and I thought she was fetching water from a well. There were a lot of people and we realized how large this place was so I'm not docking any stars for that. Time may have also been going slower because I was starving. When she came back with our water we let her know we were ready to order drinks and food. The boyfriend and cousin were all with me and were craving the sweet taste of the south so we all ordered lemonades and sweet teas. Also, don't forget to redeem your free cornbread! It was basically perfect. Not too moist, not too dry, warm with a crunch outside and served with, what I think was, a compound honey butter. I saw on the menu that they make croutons with cornbread so I can imagine how delicious that would be. For the food, had the following:Clinton Hill Omelette- Meh. It was alright. I actually felt bad for the Boyfriend because my cousins and my food were amazing. I let him eat mine. Fried Chicken with Red Velvet Waffles- My food. We've been having really awful, thick waffles with Chicken and Waffles lately so this was a refreshing change. The waffle was warm, chewy, and had the red velvet goodness. The chicken was also delicious. It was a little greasy, but what the hell... I was eating chicken and waffles. Franks Red Sauce made it all the better so I was happy to have that on my table. Sausage and Grits with Lobster Sauce- My cousins was probably my favorite. I was hesitant to order grits because some places don't do it right. SoCo does it right! They were creamy and buttery and the lobster gravy that was on top of it made it all the better. We were there for a pretty long time but the wait was well worth it. I will definitely be returning looking like a million bucks!",5.0
I made a reservation for my birthday.  They made me wait for 20 minutes when it was barely anyone there.  I make my order.  Immediately the waiter told my husband and I there was no Mac and Cheese.  Then he proceeded to tell us there was no mash potatoes.  So I asked what do u have.  He stated that I could have  double spinach.  What the hell do I look like......

I saw on the menu that they make croutons with cornbread so I can imagine how delicious that would be. For the food, had the following:Clinton Hill Omelette- Meh. It was alright. I actually felt bad for the Boyfriend because my cousins and my food were amazing. I let him eat mine. Fried Chicken with Red Velvet Waffles- My food. We've been having really awful, thick waffles with Chicken and Waffles lately so this was a refreshing change. The waffle was warm, chewy, and had the red velvet goodness. The chicken was also delicious. It was a little greasy, but what the hell... I was eating chicken and waffles. Franks Red Sauce made it all the better so I was happy to have that on my table. Sausage and Grits with Lobster Sauce- My cousins was probably my favorite. I was hesitant to order grits because some places don't do it right. SoCo does it right! They were creamy and buttery and the lobster gravy that was on top of it made it all the better. We were there for a pretty long time but the wait was well worth it. I will definitely be returning looking like a million bucks!",5.0
I made a reservation for my birthday.  They made me wait for 20 minutes when it was barely anyone there.  I make my order.  Immediately the waiter told my husband and I there was no Mac and Cheese.  Then he proceeded to tell us there was no mash potatoes.  So I asked what do u have.  He stated that I could have  double spinach.  What the hell do I look like...... Popeye!  Then he offered grits.  Do all black people eat grits!  I will never return and this place.  It was an absolute mistake.  I'm so sorry I wasted my time here.,1.0
"SoCo is fantastic. I've been multiple times for brunch and enjoyed the UNLIMITED mimosas. I've also been for dinner. The food is incredible, I daydream about the fried chicken and the Mac n cheese. The staff is friendly and checks in frequently. The decor is great, I enjoy the booths, the high ceilings, and the bathrooms. They have a small outdoor seating space in the back that I haven't been in. Be prepared they get busy for brunch, since so many others agree with my 5 star rating!",5.0
"We called in a reservation late, we were fortunate to get a great table.  Very comfortable seating.  Our server was a delight, the host who greeted us at the door a gentleman.   Our food was unique and very delicious.   We shared some nice appetizers, I particularly enjoyed the beef short ribs.  Most of the rest of our party was quite taken by the mussels.  They were prepared in a creamy broth and served with garlic bread.One of our fellow diners ordered skirt steak.  This delicious dish was the result of what must have been an overnight marinade couple with perfect broiling.  The most tasty cut of beef that I have sampled in a very long time.  There were some ravioli dishes on the table that looked appetizing, I tried the lobster and it was good, naturally.  I loved my unusual combination of a red velvet waffle and buttermilk fried chicken.  This was offered with powdered sugar and maple syrup.  It was so good, I am concerned that I will need to discontinue ordering fried chicken.  Nothing could stack up favorably, when compared with this treat!",5.0
"I came in here for a dinner for a birthday and the jackass host was like no hats like I had a fitted on..... Really?  I had a Brixton stylish hat. I wanted to tell him to go beat it but I wasn't trying to spoil the birthday. This place sucks. So annoying. You're in Brooklyn. Stop acting like you're in short hills or the hamptons. No fitteds fine, but a woman with a hat.... Boy bye. Any other day I would've walked out but I was trying to be supportive. This place sucks. Never coming here again...",1.0
"One of my new favorite spots in BK when I don't feel like traveling to Negril. Love the F-Que wings and the salmon. (Thought about taking a pic AFTER I downed the wings...that's how good they were)The Salmon (pic included) and fried chicken are my regular entree orders. I usually order the chicken WITHOUT the red velvet pancakes because 1) I'm cutting my carbs and 2) I wasn't blown away...it just tasted like a dry, thick pancake that happened to be colored red.The Caesar Salad is delicious too.And I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE the chocolate cake!  It usually comes with vanilla Ice cream, but I made a request for chocolate.",4.0

Food/Drinks - Bomb.com, there are a lot of mixed reviews when it comes to their buttermilk chicken and red velvet waffles, nonetheless, they are good! The chicken is VERY tasty and well seasoned, the waffles were thick but fluffy, the only thing that turned me off from this meal was the syrup -- too thin, as if they watered it down. The mac-n-cheese is soooooo good, good balance of seasonings and cheeses.The only thing that irritated me was the heat, when it was on, it was on BLAST.

This place is TRENDY and HIP so you might want to be seen here and take a selfie ;) The food -- everyone on Yelp was right. My husband, since he is a great chef himself (not by trade), he is really hard on restaurants. I mean REALLY hard. And he was eating happily not saying anything negative. We started with the muscles, an appetizer that a restaurant can ruin pretty easily. Well not here. Not only was the marinade bullion beyond delicious, the garlic bread could have stood on its own as an appetizer that I would have happily filled up on. We ordered extra garlic bread. For our main entree, we chose the Skirt Steak with Collard Greens and the Braised Rib. The portion was just enough! I knew I was gaining weight tonight but it was worth it. I could go on and on about how delicious our meal was but I don't have to. There are 1100 reviews saying the sam thing.

The perfect crunch with such gooey cheese. The chicken and waffle was good too but the red velvet waffle itself had no flavor. Tasted like a regular waffle. The wings are juicy and flavorful so definitely start with those. They have an extensive list of cocktails....the watermelon cocktail for 2 is amazing!!! Definitely get that! The ribs are super flavorful too!!!! Honestly one of the best soul food I've ever had and it was worth trekking to Brooklyn!

"I've tried some of the best Soulfood Diners in NYC. Sylva's & her niece Melba's in Harlem and I've also tried Jezebels on Restaurant Row in Hell's Kitchen. So when I heard about Soco's in BK, I just had to give them a Bronx cheer. I had the Buttermilk Fried Chicken/Red Velvet Waffles, Aunt Cruz's Mac & Cheese. First the spicy chicken was prepared a little well too done for me to appreciate its flavor. The Red Velvet waffles looked appealing but was lacking in taste. Last, Aunt Cruz's Mac & Melba's was tremendous in a miniature skillet but ate like a casserole. The beef short ribs were seared just a tad bit over blackened. Since I was celebrating my 25th Wedding Anniversary, I had what was supposably their best sparkly white wine turnt out to be bittersweet. But I would like to add that my server (Amy) was courteous, attentive and seemed caring, so I made no complaints. The decor and ambience was somewhat Applebee's- ish. Well, this dining experience at Soco's cannot compare to the delectable ones I've  had at Melba's .",2.0

"Woohoo! Check ins get you cornbread!!!Came here super early on a recent Sunday afternoon to see what all the fuss was about. We, along with about 10 other folks were patiently waiting outside for the restaurant to open. When it did we were graciously escorted to our table. I checked in to find that we get complimentary cornbread if we do! (1 star for that!)Being greedy people, my homegirl and I already knew what we wanted, so we ordered the catfish and chips, chicken and waffles and macaroni and cheese and grits. My friend also ordered a drink (can't remember which) and she said it was amazing. Had a sip. Credibility confirmed.As we waited the restaurant quickly filled up with people who looked to be extras from ""Girlfriends"". It was that type of crowd. I was really interesting, as I feel like I never go out, but everyone was in good spirits and there was lively chatter abound. While we waited for the rest of our food to come, we devoured the cornbread, which was so great and sweet and warm and buttery...ummmmm.....then the app came ....then our meal..I must say that I don't really like most restaurant's macaroni and cheese because it's just not that good. Not here. I must say theirs is the best I've tasted besides my own. It was rich and full of flavor, not just cheese and milk. The portions were enough for three people, not just two greedy guses like us. The grits were good as well, but I think I still like Mango Seed's better. My fish and chips were really good too, with a huge serving of everything. Most of the time quantity does not equal quality, but here it did. My girl said her chicken and waffles were really flavorful. We finished it off with dessert. Yes, dessert, as recommended by our server. It was some kind of chocolate conocotion and was soooo good. It took about 15 minutes to prepare, but was worth the wait. Next time we come here (of course there is a next time!) we might skip all the appetizers and do something lighter. We were super greedy and even though we had things to take home, we still at a LOT of food.",4.0

While everyone raves about the red velvet waffle with fried chicken, I think the best dish here is definitely the Mac and cheese. It was DELICIOUSSSSSSSSS!!! The perfect crunch with such gooey cheese. The chicken and waffle was good too but the red velvet waffle itself had no flavor. Tasted like a regular waffle. The wings are juicy and flavorful so definitely start with those. They have an extensive list of cocktails....the watermelon cocktail for 2 is amazing!!! Definitely get that! The ribs are super flavorful too!!!! Honestly one of the best soul food I've ever had and it was worth trekking to Brooklyn! I never got dessert here because each time I go Im stuffed midway through my entree!!!",5.0
"I guess my expectations were too high. So here is my opinion. The Ambiance was perfect, the food was average.   You have to stick to the menu.  We tried to order what we wanted but they were not accomodating.  The waiter even argued with my wife about what she can and can not  get with her fried chicken. I have tasted much better chicken and the waffles was just ok.  However the f que wings and the cornbread especially the cornbread was amazing but I don't think I'm going back.",3.0
"I've tried some of the best Soulfood Diners in NYC. Sylva's & her niece Melba's in Harlem and I've also tried Jezebels on Restaurant Row in Hell's Kitchen. So when I heard about Soco's in BK, I just had to give them a Bronx cheer. I had the Buttermilk Fried Chicken/Red Velvet Waffles, Aunt Cruz's Mac & Cheese. First the spicy chicken was prepared a little well too done for me to appreciate its flavor. The Red Velvet waffles looked appealing but was lacking in taste. Last, Aunt Cruz's Mac & Melba's was tremendous in a miniature skillet but ate like a casserole. The beef short ribs were seared just a tad bit over blackened. Since I was celebrating my 25th Wedding Anniversary, I had what was supposably their best sparkly white wine turnt out to be bittersweet. But I would like to add that my server (Amy) was courteous, attentive and seemed caring, so I made no complaints. The decor and ambience was somewhat Applebee's- ish. Well, this dining experience at Soco's cannot compare to the delectable ones I've  had at Melba's .",2.0
"The staff here rock! Christine was my waitress. She was super attentive and very helpful. I follow SoCo on Instagram and my meal, Blackened Salmon, was so delicious! I highly recommend this Brooklyn gem!  I just wish I had taken pictures before I wolfed down my meal!",5.0
"I cannot say enough about the red velvet waffles except that I ""tore it up."" I came here on a nice summer Sunday evening where the host seated us outside. I enjoyed the service and the food. I wish they had more room to expand the back, but otherwise I would come back for more of those waffles. I like this place.",4.0
By far one of my favorite spotsmy first choice for date niceWould like if they honor ur open table reservation even tho ur running lateThe lobster shrimp & grits OMG..............The red velvet waffles with buttermilk fried chicken -HEAVEN-& the mac and cheese -Yessssssss GOD Jambalaya hmmmmm mmmmIf the had a loyalty program I'll be they #1 I'm in there at least twice a week,5.0
"Woohoo! Check ins get you cornbread!!!Came here super early on a recent Sunday afternoon to see what all the fuss was about. We, along with about 10 other folks were patiently waiting outside for the restaurant to open. When it did we were graciously escorted to our table. I checked in to find that we get complimentary cornbread if we do! (1 star for that!)Being greedy people, my homegirl and I already knew what we wanted, so we ordered the catfish and chips, chicken and waffles and macaroni and cheese and grits. My friend also ordered a drink (can't remember which) and she said it was amazing. Had a sip. Credibility confirmed.As we waited the restaurant quickly filled up with people who looked to be extras from ""Girlfriends"". It was that type of crowd. I was really interesting, as I feel like I never go out, but everyone was in good spirits and there was lively chatter abound. While we waited for the rest of our food to come, we devoured the cornbread, which was so great and sweet and warm and buttery...ummmmm.....then the app came ....then our meal..I must say that I don't really like most restaurant's macaroni and cheese because it's just not that good. Not here. I must say theirs is the best I've tasted besides my own. It was rich and full of flavor, not just cheese and milk. The portions were enough for three people, not just two greedy guses like us. The grits were good as well, but I think I still like Mango Seed's better. My fish and chips were really good too, with a huge serving of everything. Most of the time quantity does not equal quality, but here it did. My girl said her chicken and waffles were really flavorful. We finished it off with dessert. Yes, dessert, as recommended by our server. It was some kind of chocolate conocotion and was soooo good. It took about 15 minutes to prepare, but was worth the wait. Next time we come here (of course there is a next time!) we might skip all the appetizers and do something lighter. We were super greedy and even though we had things to take home, we still at a LOT of food.",4.0
"Went here for brunch and had the Skirt Steak and Eggs with sautéed spinach and it was absolutely delicious.Had their Pilsner on tap too, nothing special just a standard pils. The food was really outstanding, I think next time I head here for brunch I'll get one of their bourge-y cocktails instead of a boring beer.",5.0
"This was my second time here. My first experience was not that great but the food was good and I wanted to give them another shot. So I did. And I'm done.I came back for my friend's birthday. I made reservations through OpenTable and received confirmation right away. The day of, I get a call at 3p to remind me. Great. At 4:30, I get another call to say that the restaurant actually does not open until 5:30 but they will honor my reservation. So why are you calling? Just to say you don't open until 5:30 but you are doing me a favor by honoring a reservation I made and received confirmation for?I get to SoCo. The times listed on the door said ""Open at 5p"" on Saturday. So the someone was clearly lying. I go in and was told brunch got pushed back and I had to wait. So that was the problem. The guy who called should have said this instead of lying about the hours of operation. We sat at the bar and ordered drinks. Such a waste of money. $14 for drinks in an 8 ounce glass. Shameful. 45 minutes and one shameful drink later, we sat. Our waitress was not that great. She wasn't rude but wasn't friendly. She was just blah and did not seem genuine. Our food took a minimum of 30 minutes to arrive.I had the braised short ribs, others had shrimp and grits, jambalaya, chicken and waffles, and mussels. Our meal was delicious.

"I can't get enough of this place! I have been going here for years, and I never get bored with their signature dish, fried chicken and red velvet waffles.

From the fried chicken and waffles, to their salmon, to their organic chicken, to the macaroni and cheese, to the drinks, I have not had any bad food so far. Staff can be a little bit busy but and the food can sometimes take a little while to prepare, on busy days, but it's well worth the wait. That is my ""go to"" spot for chicken and waffles or a good decent brunch.",5.0
"SoCo is SoSo in regards to customer service. I've patronized this establishment twice & my first experience over the summer was much better than my more recent experience while in town for Christmas 2013. On my first visit I was more than excited to experience SoCo due to the numerous e-mails I'd received from their Mother restaurant /my Original favorite restaurant in NYC ""Negril Village"". This enthusiasm deterred my aggravation while waiting for a table for more than a hour at 9:00pm (which is WAY past my dinnertime). Once we were seated we sipped on Pear Cider which is awesome and easy to overdue by drinking too many. Though it took over 90 minutes to be seated I was happy with dinner from the apps to the main course. We had mussels as an app to share and another person had the ShortRib flatbread pizza to share which everyone who are meat eaters and they all loved it. I had the Salmon over mashed sweet potatoes and it was amazing, definitely worth the wait.Let's get to my more recent visit which was the visit from HELL. I made reservations this go round because it was the weekend after Christmas and we were a party of 8. The best part about this visit was that we were seated immediately at the table that is elevated over the restaurant straight to the back. We had a waitress come over to the table by the name of TASHA remember that name and be sure to NEVER have her as your waitress EVER especially if you have people in your party that she may have liked or may have crushed on and didn't get any play. This young lady was very short with us and we were in the Christmas spirit and sharing our Holiday cheer. We were ordering our apps and drinks and when some was trying to tell her ""That's 7 Pear ciders"" she quickly replied ""WAIT HOLD UP, one person at a time"". That's not so bad you say, however you had to see her FACE of disgust like she didn't want to be there or be our server. I shared my phone with her to show her that I checked in on Yelp and I unlocked the Yelp offer for cornbread which she looked at and shunned my phone back over to me "" My Gold Iphone 5s"" REALLY. I continued to maintain my composure and began fellowshipping with my group as we waited on our drinks and apps. About 15 minutes later some of the drinks came and one of the 5 apps. Another 20 minutes later we flagged her down and she decided to bring the rest of the apps (COLD) and we inquired about the cornbread and she rolled her eyes and walked away. NOTE:We didn't get the cornbread until after our entrees were served. We ordered our entrees again after flagging her down and practically begging her to come over to our table and help us as we were hungry. This young lady TASHA was THEE worst waitress I've ever had in NYC and I know that NYC is known to be cut throat or rude however I'm from Chicago so I know a thing or two about ignorance and how to handle it as well as how to offset it in a NICE/NASTY way.Icing on the cake: Tasha came by to clear the table without asking us if we were done with our plates or even asking if she could clear the table, she just started grabbing stuff and we had to pull plates out of her hand that we were still working on and one item in particular that she removed was the cheesecake and in the process the cheesecake feel onto the Chanel leather glove of one of the ladies at the table and you would think TASHA would acknowledge this mess with not just a look but an apology and a swift sprint to grab something to clean the glove off. Ooh NO, Tasha kept clearing the table while everyone looked with wide-eyes except me as I just can't tolerate IGNORANCE and DISRESPECT for any reason for so long. I stated ""Excuse me, you just dropped cheesecake on her glove"" and she gave me this LOOK as if she was trying to CUT my throat with her eyes and walked away and came back and dropped a napkin on the table on top of the glove and walked away. She returned to drop the check and once I grabbed the check and noticed that her tip was about $85 automatically I immediately asked for a manager. My ISSUE: The manager listened to the table express a group consensus of how rude TASHA was from start to finish. No one asked to not pay the tip; we just ask that it be redirected to the kitchen for the amazing food and to the dishwashers as the dishes were clean and sparkling. We REFUSE to give her a dime; however the manager sugar coated her actions and made it seem like she may have been having a bad day as if it was acceptable for her to express her bad day toward individuals patronizing this establishment and spending a large chunk of change. The SAD part is that I'm sure nothing was done and she received that tip because he seemed pretty sweet on her and compassionate for her regardless of her actions which is why I have no plans on no visits to NYC to see family to patronize this establishment again or no plans to add SoCo to my list of places to try for those who look to me for travel advice due to my extensive travels.",2.0

It was a nice day (yes, I swear there was a nice day once in March of 2014) so the back patio was open; we were seated inside, but near it. We had a reservation and it was definitely needed. Also note that the seating staff won't wait more than 20 minutes to give up your table, and everyone has to be seated -- we made it with about 5 minutes to spare.

We also ordered some mussels and a side of the ""aunt Cruz Mac and cheese."" The Mac and cheese tasted OK to me tonight but the past two times they've been great.

I also expected it to be more crispy but it's actually very creamy. We prefer crunchy, crispy mac and cheese.I made the reservation for 8 pm and the waiter messed up and had put us in for 10 pm. So we went on the waiting list and had to wait for an hour (even though we were initially told it would be a 40-45 min wait). This place is super, super crowded and loud.",3.0

I will have this again, and again, definitely give it a try.  Their cornbread is a southern must. It is not sweet, is freshly made and hot. Don't forget to order the sweet tea. I will be returning soon, hopefully the quality of the food and service will remain the same.",5.0
"Food was great. We got fried chicken with red velvet waffle, lobster and shrimp grits, collard greens. The chicken could have been more crispy and the plates better presented but everything was tasty and in decent portions. The waffle was interesting and and very well prepared. I thought overall the grits were better, the lobster was a bit dry, but there was a touch of spices and green onion that added a touch of freshness that goes well with the delicate flavor of the shrimp.What was unsatisfactory was the unattentive service. Called to reserved and told us that there was no wait. We walked over, literally 5 minutes and the wait was 25 mins. The hostess didnt even take out names and ended up offering after 10 mins the table in front of the door. The bouncer loved to keep the door open freezing us.

"Ok. Been wanting to sample this place for a minute. Tonight.., I'm in the neighborhood and I was like.., it's going down!!Wow. Place was larger then I expected. And fella's; it was jammed packed with honeys. Lots of them. I was like.., Whoa!!Ok. I got a stool at the bar as I was flying solo. It was kool as the place was packed and I was able to see the game on one of the flat screens. Ordered. The food came and I was like wow. The Mac and cheese was/is plentiful. Makes a meal in itself. Note to couples- order one and share it. My meal of Blackened Salmon was popping. As was the cornbread. For you peeps that like a drink or two they got that too. Can't wait to come back here. Brother next to me said it was a slow night honey wise. Say word!!",5.0
"This was my 3rd time visiting SoCo and I had a great time. I arrived around 7pm on Saturday and I didn't have a problem getting seated. Our waitress was super nice and she checked in on us through out the night but not in an annoying way. I ordered short ribs and my hubby ordered the skirt steak. We also ordered some mussels and a side of the ""aunt Cruz Mac and cheese."" The Mac and cheese tasted OK to me tonight but the past two times they've been great. I had a Irish creme drink with caramel and marshmallows it was strong and creamy. I Hope to finally try their red velvet waffles the next time. I'll definitely be back!",4.0
"My husband had the chicken and waffles, mac and cheese and I had the salmon. They looked good but we've tasted better. The salmon is a bit dry and tasteless but the sweet potatoes that come with it are good. The mac and cheese was made with this white cheese we weren't used to so it wasn't enjoyable. I also expected it to be more crispy but it's actually very creamy. We prefer crunchy, crispy mac and cheese.I made the reservation for 8 pm and the waiter messed up and had put us in for 10 pm. So we went on the waiting list and had to wait for an hour (even though we were initially told it would be a 40-45 min wait). This place is super, super crowded and loud.",3.0
"My husband and I went there during lunchtime and seating was not a problem. We were welcomed and seated immediately.He had a bowl of Gumbo, brown roux, (of course I had to taste it) which tasted authentic. It had shrimp, andouille sausage and white rice, delicious! Don't pass this up. He ordered the  red velvet waffle and fried chicken and enjoyed it. I had the shrimp, grits and lobster, which was heavenly! Perfectly smooth and rich, with white cheddar cheese. I will have this again, and again, definitely give it a try.  Their cornbread is a southern must. It is not sweet, is freshly made and hot. Don't forget to order the sweet tea. I will be returning soon, hopefully the quality of the food and service will remain the same.",5.0
"Food was great. We got fried chicken with red velvet waffle, lobster and shrimp grits, collard greens. The chicken could have been more crispy and the plates better presented but everything was tasty and in decent portions. The waffle was interesting and and very well prepared. I thought overall the grits were better, the lobster was a bit dry, but there was a touch of spices and green onion that added a touch of freshness that goes well with the delicate flavor of the shrimp.What was unsatisfactory was the unattentive service. Called to reserved and told us that there was no wait. We walked over, literally 5 minutes and the wait was 25 mins. The hostess didnt even take out names and ended up offering after 10 mins the table in front of the door. The bouncer loved to keep the door open freezing us. Also given the nice athmospere and prices i dont think the tvs reminding a sport bar are the best decision.",4.0

"This place is great! The service here was just outstanding. From the moment you walk in, till the moment you leave, the whole staff pay attention to you and look to serve you. Shout out to my server Alex. Dude was a gentleman and provided great service. The red velvet waffles with the buttermilk chicken was delicious. The ambiance, decor of the place was cool and relaxed. The Mac and cheese was delicious! A little bacon would've kicked it up a notch. The food was a little pricy but great nonetheless. The service, again, was great and definitely leave an impression on you",5.0
Wow is what comes to my mind when i think Soco! This restaurant is one of the best in my list if you want southern cooking with out having to go down south this is the spot and it's right here in brooklyn. I ordered the skirt steak with collard greens and potatoes yum it was delicious! My partner ordered the chicken and waffles which were also so good. Service was great! Food was awesome I will visit again real soon.,5.0

"I went to Soco on a Friday night (10/24/2014) through making reservations on Yelp. I recommend doing so because it can get pretty packed if you want to avoid waiting to be seated. The hostess was very nice and guided us to our seats.The décor in the restaurant was very welcoming and the seating in the back is recommended as it is staged like a greenhouse. Looking around it was clear what the entrée of choice was, Chicken and Red Velvet Waffles. I've had chicken and waffles before but I must say that this was by far the best. The chicken was very fresh, not over cooked, and didn't have a frozen taste to it like I've had before. We ordered a side of Mac and Cheese for the table and that combo was delicious. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. In terms of the drinks, we each had two cocktails and changed our order for each one. All four were innovative and refreshing and not overwhelming. After tax and tip, 2 cocktails each and2  entrées  and 1 appetizer, it was about 60-70 per person but all worth it. Will DEFINITELY be back.",5.0

Both were splendid though this place is a bit pricey. I remember feeling like it was over rated compared to what folks said before. But it was still pretty good.",4.0
The food here is awwwwsome my favorite most refreshing thing on the menu is the watermelon daiquiri yum yum yummers!! The Mac n cheese is the runner up it is so tasty that I forced myself to stop so that I can have leftovers lol and finally the chicken and waffles is the finisher even thou the chicken is the winner out of the two combo meal I made myself eat all my waffles so I can gave chicken to eat with my Mac n cheese .....

We came on a Saturday for brunch and the wait was almost an hour. It was expected given the reviews it's getting. We had chicken and red velvet waffles. The chicken was amazing. I really like the frying flour they use. Also had the Bourbon Street eggs Benedict. It is pretty good but I wish there are more Benedict than the huge salad side they gave me. I will definitely come back and try other things from SoCo.,4.0
This place is so good. I went on Saturday around 8 and the wait time was around 10mins which is convenient because you can figure out what your going to order in that time. There drinks are really really good and strong but so tasty. I ordered the steak and collard greens which were so delicious like the fact I ate collard greens means it was amazing. The customer service was excellent and very quick. The lighting is pretty dim. They had sinks outside the bathroom which were really cute and they used natural soap which I appreciated. Overall this place is fantastic! Perfect date restaurant.,5.0

"Soco is a staple in Brooklyn for good southern food. It's always packed here so making reservations is recommended. Me and my BFF went for dinner for her BDay. We made reservations but had to wait. We finally got seated and ordered a side of Mac. My friend loved it I felt it was decent. I ordered steak which came with potatoes and collard greens. The steak was decent along with the sides. My fried ordered short ribs which was perfection!! The next time I come here I will be ordering that. I rarely eat ribs so ordering that isn't something I would normally do but the piece she gave me was soft and seasoned extremely well. The atmosphere is chic, funky, cool grown up laid back.

We also ordered a side of their famous mac and cheese and rice and beans. Man ole Man...The food was awesome! The drinks were awesome as well. Our waitress was very polite and attentive to our needs.

I'm giving the food 5 stars because the macaroni and cheese was AMAZING. It comes out in cute individual pots and the cheese on top is so crispy and delicious. It has really good flavor. Some Mac and cheeses are bland and dry but not at Soco! We also tried the chicken and red velvet waffle and the jambalaya. I'm not sure what's the hype about with the chicken and waffles. I've had better. It's just okay for me. Maybe because it came out cold after we waited about 45 minutes for the food. But that's okay because the macaroni and cheese made up for it. The server was okay as well. We were in a hurry to leave and were trying to get the check but the waiter was nowhere to be found. So the service was just okay but luckily our meal was pretty good.,4.0
Another helper described Soco as lackluster and I have to agree. I've been waiting for a while to try Soco so after hanging out around the Barclays decided it was finally time. Our waitress was great and attentive. My 13 dollar margarita tasted like it was a virgin so I switched to their 6 dollar lemonade. I will say the cornbread wowed me. It was delicious and the first thing we had. Unfortunately everything to come did not live up it. I had the chicken and waffles and they were just ok.  As someone who's had them at sweet chicks or Clinton st bakery these just didn't measure up. The $10 famous Mac and cheese was just again ok. My fiancé had the lamb shank special which came on a nice bed of greens but again he shrugged his shoulders and described them as ok -$25 My brother had the steak frites which came out in a huge plate where the steak was about 1/4 the size of the plate and the fries swallowed the rest of the plate. I have never seem so many fries on a plate before. There had to be 4 servings. He liked the fries but though the steak was just ok. The restaurant is cute the wait staff is great but if your looking for a mind blowing culinary experience (which I always am) I would suggest going here. Your pay a hefty price for mediocre drinks and food. Soco turned out to all hype no substance.,2.0
My friend and I went for a late lunch. We got there at 240 and it was beyond packed of people waiting to be seated. We didn't have reservations so we had to wait for seats at the bar. We ended up getting seats by 3. Just in time too cause they're brunch stops at 3:30. So I know we were lucky because it's always packed however the food makes up for any waiting time.  Absolutely great brunch. We ordered a Mac n cheese for the two of us. Each of us ordered the buttermilk fried chicken on red velvet waffle....Amazing!! So delicious. After having all this amazing food I had to come home and sleep. Food coma for sure!,5.0
"Came here at lunch time, service was great. Very nice atmosphere. I sat at the bar and the bar man was very friendly gave me some ideas where to go in the surrounding area. The selection for lunch has a smaller selection as they are not that busy in the day. I arrived at happy hour and had a lovely Rum Punch! I had the Gumbo to start that was great!! Very flavourful. Had the fried chicken sandwich with pickles... Pretty average needed a bit more sauce... The dressing for the side salad served with it was nice also.",4.0
"What you've heard about Soco is %100 true! Their chicken and waffles are really thebomb.com. Their Mac & Cheese is one of the best I've had in awhile.

So for a couple months I've been excited to try this place. Well yesterday I went and I didn't enjoy it as much as I thought I would. The chicken with red velvet waffles wasn't cooked well enough for me. . I did enjoy he mac n'cheese thou. I would not be going back.,2.0

If there is an issue eventually it will be resolved. I believe management is committed to good customer service.",3.0

Our waitress was great and attentive. My 13 dollar margarita tasted like it was a virgin so I switched to their 6 dollar lemonade. I will say the cornbread wowed me. It was delicious and the first thing we had. Unfortunately everything to come did not live up it. I had the chicken and waffles and they were just ok.  As someone who's had them at sweet chicks or Clinton st bakery these just didn't measure up. The $10 famous Mac and cheese was just again ok. My fiancé had the lamb shank special which came on a nice bed of greens but again he shrugged his shoulders and described them as ok -$25 My brother had the steak frites which came out in a huge plate where the steak was about 1/4 the size of the plate and the fries swallowed the rest of the plate. I have never seem so many fries on a plate before. There had to be 4 servings. He liked the fries but though the steak was just ok. The restaurant is cute the wait staff is great but if your looking for a mind blowing culinary experience (which I always am) I would suggest going here. Your pay a hefty price for mediocre drinks and food. Soco turned out to all hype no substance.,2.0
My friend and I went for a late lunch. We got there at 240 and it was beyond packed of people waiting to be seated. We didn't have reservations so we had to wait for seats at the bar. We ended up getting seats by 3. Just in time too cause they're brunch stops at 3:30. So I know we were lucky because it's always packed however the food makes up for any waiting time.  Absolutely great brunch. We ordered a Mac n cheese for the two of us. Each of us ordered the buttermilk fried chicken on red velvet waffle....Amazing!! So delicious. After having all this amazing food I had to come home and sleep. Food coma for sure!,5.0
"Came here at lunch time, service was great. Very nice atmosphere. I sat at the bar and the bar man was very friendly gave me some ideas where to go in the surrounding area. The selection for lunch has a smaller selection as they are not that busy in the day. I arrived at happy hour and had a lovely Rum Punch! I had the Gumbo to start that was great!! Very flavourful. Had the fried chicken sandwich with pickles... Pretty average needed a bit more sauce... The dressing for the side salad served with it was nice also.",4.0
"What you've heard about Soco is %100 true! Their chicken and waffles are really thebomb.com. Their Mac & Cheese is one of the best I've had in awhile. It's a super large portion that made me shimmy in happiness! The food isn't cheap, the drinks are ok..., and the crowd is beyond the hipsters. Which is even greater in my opinion.",4.0
So for a couple months I've been excited to try this place. Well yesterday I went and I didn't enjoy it as much as I thought I would. The chicken with red velvet waffles wasn't cooked well enough for me. . I did enjoy he mac n'cheese thou. I would not be going back.,2.0

"I had the blackened salmon and it was good. Two group members had the lobster, shrimp & grits and they loved the dish. Another member of the group said the grits were delicious. However she said the waffles were like glue. The hibiscus tea aka sorrel was great. Tip: if you are splitting the bill be sure to bring cash, review your bill closely, and be very patient. If there is an issue eventually it will be resolved. I believe management is committed to good customer service.",3.0

I went to Soco for my bday. It's really nice inside. The hostess was pleasant. Our waiter was quick & very attentive. The food was Fabulous. I had the red velvet waffles & fried chicken. Mmmhmm. My friend had the salmon with sweet potato & string beans. Yummo. I will be going back for sure!!,4.0
Im only giving this place a 3 star bc I ordered & picked up. Never sat down & actually ate at Soco's. I tried the Red Velvet waffles & chicken. It was a bit pricey but overall it was good. From the pick up the ambiance looked amazing tho. I'll try coming back to get the full experience & update my review,3.0
"Been here a few times, so I need to show love.  It's hard to go wrong, but the fried chicken and red velvet waffle is the TRUTH.  Like they've somehow channeled an old Black grandmother to cook with organic ingredients.  The Mac and cheese is good as well.",5.0

"A great brunch spot for Brooklyn's young, trendy professionals! I came here on a Sunday with my cousin, sister, and her friend. We sat at the bar, due to the long understandable wait, and it was a geat decision. The bartenders were extremely friendly. We spoke about topics from the global Black plight to natural hair care. It was abit annoying that they did not offer bottomless mimosas on Sunday, but I think that we all preferred the feeling we got from drinking numerours  cocktails... if you know what I mean. Overall, a great place for a girls' brunch or a cute date. Be sure to stop by and try their Brooklyn Bellini",5.0
"I finally made it out to SoCo. I was mostly impressed.The wait time on a Sunday night at 9pm was over an hour, impatiently waited by the bar, bar staff were fun and entertaining, had the cranberry vodka lemonade drink..way too much lemonade not enough vodka, stuck with soda. Order app, lobster roll, 5 small pieces about $12 or $14, murdered my taste bud and wallet at the same time..ALL CONS.After asking about our table, which was only supposed to take about 3O minutes, we finally get seated in the back-outside area--which was covered so no we weren't cold. Waitress was nice, attentive, menu selections weren't that extensive, got the chicken and waffles..really good but not out of this world.The rest of my stars is dedicated to the mac & cheese!! Seriously it was a mouthgasm. We were tempted to order just a 2nd one to take home. My cousins had a fish dishes, and even though I'm not a fan of fish I was enjoying their food..flavors just right, crispy/grilled. Bill was $1OO for all three of us which also included wine and an iced tea. Not bad. This spot is great for dates, groups, and birthday. Just Pre-game WITH food because the wait time is longer than 4O days and 4O nights.",4.0
"I had my birthday dinner here 12/22/2013 and everything was perfect. I was a little skeptical reading a review about another birthday dinner that wasn't the best and the fact that my party was 25+ persons I definitely was nervous. However SoCo pulled through! We all were seating in the back room area, thier pre-fix menu was delicious, and the vibe was just right. The only downfall was the wait time for the food but with my parents and friends making ""nuff"" jokes and good conversation, we made due with the time. Our server Robert was AMAZING! Sadly I did not get the other ladies name that was helping out but she was the bomb dot com as well. Thank you SoCo for helping me ring in my 25th the right way!",5.0
"I came here last minute with a friend for brunch. As it usually is there were people waiting inside and outside for a table - the wait we were told was about 45mins. Luckily, we snatched two open bar seats and sat down. The bartender was great, I should have gotten her name to give her a shoutout. She was making some really interesting drinks and entertained all of my questions as she was doing her job. I originally wasn't drinking but i convinced myself to try their bloody mary and boy I was not disappointed. Their mix is really good. I wanted to order one of everything on the menu to taste them as they all sounded amazingly good. We ended up ordering the chicken and waffles, and the omlet to get some healthy in.The food didnt come out that fast, but we expected that because of how busyu it was. I have had my share of chicken and waffles and this one takes the red velet cake! The waffle is cooked to perfection and the syrup is perfect. My chicken did come out a little undercooked for my eyes, and our bartender apologized multiples and sent it right back. It came out fresh and perfect! I will be back again to try all of the other menu items that were making my mouth water! The trick is to snag some bar seats and avoid the wait!",5.0

"SoCo is your typical hipstery Brooklyn brunch spot. The food is expensive (as you would expect), but it is also really good.I found out about this place through my cousin. She was here probably once a month, and kept posting drool worthy photos of the food on Instagram so, when mother's day came around I decided that this was the place to go.Making reservations was pretty seamless, and simple. I thought that it would probably be all  booked up for mothers day, but the guy on the phone made it seem like there was plenty of available of tables. When arrived there were a few people waiting outside (we got there before they opened), but they definitely honored our reservations by making sure we were seated on time.Our server was okay. It was pretty busy day so, he was running around a lot, and it was difficult to get a hold of him when we needed him, but I'm just attributing that to it being mother's day.The drinks, not strong, but the food was on point! The mac-and-cheese was literally everything you'd want, cheesy and flavorful and ughhhh I get flashbacks about it. The chicken sausage was also really really good. Although on the menu they make it seem like chicken sausage is the only option, but if you ask for beef or pork they do have that as well. The red velvet chicken and waffles definitely did not disappoint either. (side bar: I did not order all this food. I sampled from everyone else plate lol)Overall, SoCo did not disappoint.

Our server suggested we get a bottle of champagne for $40 as they will provide complimentary orange juice, and so we did. Appetizers: I ordered the gumbo, which was just okay for my first time ever eating gumbo. My friend ordered the mussels which were amazing! I ate most of the mussels. It's served in a white sauce that's absolutely mind blowing. It's very addicting. I didn't know something could taste so good.Entrée: We both had the lobster, shrimp and grits but I must say, by the time our food came, we were half full so maybe we'll share appetizers next time. The grits were so warm and buttery, by far the best grits I've ever had. However, I was so full and I didn't want to waste the $29 so I took it to go.We also received complimentary cornbread (for checking in via Yelp) and that too was amazing. Before I even bit in, I could taste it on my lips. I usually hate cornbread but this one was worth it.The restaurant itself is kind of small. I wish there was more open space out back.

They must season the cheese sauce with something heavenly, maybe garlic? Either way, great music, great decor, attentive service, what more could you ask for??  I will definitely be back to SoCO.

"I came here on Halloween and ordered the Smoked BBQ Chicken with mashed potatoes and string beans. It was soooo good. The chicken was moist, well cooked with the right amount of flavor.  The string beans were sautéed in garlic and the mash potatoes almost had the perfect texture. I was completely satisfied. My friend had the buttermilk fried chicken with the red velvet waffles. I didn't taste his chicken, but I did try the waffle. The waffles were bleh.  It honestly tasted like flour and it did not have a waffle texture. It was sort of like sweet, gummy bread . Also it did not taste like red velvet either. He enjoyed it though (I can't understand how) . But I will definitely come again and try their other dishes (except for the waffles).  The wait staff was good, I had no issues with their wait service .",4.0
Believe the hype. This place is legit. Been here a couple of times and the food and service is consistent each time. Go for brunch and get unlimited mimosas for $15. The waiters are attentive and your glass will never be empty.,5.0
"I am very disappointed with SoCo. I initially visited SoCo for a romantic dinner a few years ago and it was delicious! Pricy, but delicious. More recently I attended a happy hour on a Friday after hearing about it on a teacher happy hour listing, and was very pleased. The drinks were good and the food was delicious! I sampled the Mac and cheese, mussels and wings. Last Friday, I organized a happy hour at SoCo, convincing my co-workers to make the trek past our usual bar to SoCo. I get there a little early to reserve some tables and happen to mention to the host (I think) happy hour, and his response: we don't have happy hour on Fridays. I mentioned to him that I was there literally the week before for happy hour and he said he didn't know why, but they no longer have happy hour on Fridays.In my processing this, right after I called my friends and we quickly headed back to our usual spot where there is always happy hour and tasty eats, I contemplated whether there was a special event that Friday there was happy hour. But then, I remembered that there were other people there, non-teachers, partaking in the happy hour.  Also, while the drinks and food were good, the service was very poor at the bar despite the large amount of staff present. The staff was busy, enjoying blue shots and photographing drinks. Perhaps this was for promotion purposes, though I can't imagine this requiring so many people. I digress. This decision to take away Happy Hour on Fridays tells me that SoCo does not value it's customers.

"This place is super cute inside so I'll give them a star for that. My food was also pretty good so they get another star for that. Neither of those stars are enough for me to come back here if I'm in BK ever again any time soon. The service was extremely slow. Our waiter forgot about us - TWICE- first to greet us and take our drink orders - 10 minutes - and then to bring out our drink orders (20 minutes!!!). That alone turned me completely off. Then even worse - they tacked on an 18% tax on our bill...we were a party of 3 people - and everything on the menu was overpriced. This establishment is a JOKE for that. They clearly feel entitled, which is fine. Just not on my dime.",2.0

My favorite Southern Cuisine to dine at when I'm in Brooklyn. I recommend this place to everyone and they instantly fall in love. The entire menu is on point!!! The guy waiters are also good looking. Lol,5.0
"Nice cool out spot. Had the braised short ribs, very tender. Played Anthony Hamilton to D'Angelo to 112. Vibe was soooo relaxed.",4.0
"Everything we ordered was good. The pecan crusted pork chop was a bit dry but still had a nice flavor. Every table around us kept ordering the mac & cheese and we collectively decided that we must be missing out on something so we threw a last minute order in and it was worth it. They must season the cheese sauce with something heavenly, maybe garlic? Either way, great music, great decor, attentive service, what more could you ask for??  I will definitely be back to SoCO. Be sure to do your Yelp check-in here for your free order of cornbread. Anything free usually tastes better. :-)",5.0

"The place is nice and clean tables are a bit too low to the bench and can be a little uncomfortable if with a large group and seated by the booth. The waitress wasn't very constant once the food was out.However, the food was awesome and the drink caramel something was delicious. The only compliant I have about it was the food took a little long to come and I wish my grits had a little more. But overall I had a good experience and enjoyed my time.",4.0
"I came here on Halloween and ordered the Smoked BBQ Chicken with mashed potatoes and string beans. It was soooo good. The chicken was moist, well cooked with the right amount of flavor.  The string beans were sautéed in garlic and the mash potatoes almost had the perfect texture. I was completely satisfied. My friend had the buttermilk fried chicken with the red velvet waffles. I didn't taste his chicken, but I did try the waffle. The waffles were bleh.  It honestly tasted like flour and it did not have a waffle texture. It was sort of like sweet, gummy bread . Also it did not taste like red velvet either. He enjoyed it though (I can't understand how) . But I will definitely come again and try their other dishes (except for the waffles).  The wait staff was good, I had no issues with their wait service .",4.0
Believe the hype. This place is legit. Been here a couple of times and the food and service is consistent each time. Go for brunch and get unlimited mimosas for $15. The waiters are attentive and your glass will never be empty.,5.0
"I am very disappointed with SoCo. I initially visited SoCo for a romantic dinner a few years ago and it was delicious! Pricy, but delicious. More recently I attended a happy hour on a Friday after hearing about it on a teacher happy hour listing, and was very pleased. The drinks were good and the food was delicious! I sampled the Mac and cheese, mussels and wings. Last Friday, I organized a happy hour at SoCo, convincing my co-workers to make the trek past our usual bar to SoCo. I get there a little early to reserve some tables and happen to mention to the host (I think) happy hour, and his response: we don't have happy hour on Fridays. I mentioned to him that I was there literally the week before for happy hour and he said he didn't know why, but they no longer have happy hour on Fridays.In my processing this, right after I called my friends and we quickly headed back to our usual spot where there is always happy hour and tasty eats, I contemplated whether there was a special event that Friday there was happy hour. But then, I remembered that there were other people there, non-teachers, partaking in the happy hour.  Also, while the drinks and food were good, the service was very poor at the bar despite the large amount of staff present. The staff was busy, enjoying blue shots and photographing drinks. Perhaps this was for promotion purposes, though I can't imagine this requiring so many people. I digress. This decision to take away Happy Hour on Fridays tells me that SoCo does not value it's customers. I guess SoCo is doing so well it can afford to not make the gesture of a few hours of reduced prices at the end of a work week.

"This is one of those places you hear about from a  friend or family member and get intrigued about. Me and my Girl decided that we should try it and after seeing so many great reviews I figured it should be worth it. I was completely right and then some. When we arrived we were promptly seated and got to choose where we sat - We chose to sit all the way in the back that is kinda like outside but covered and heated. it was actually rather romantic. Our Waiter came by - Alex who is a very chill guy very mello , not pushy and never rushed us. He made us feel very welcomed and made a suggestion or two here and there. We ordered the  The Sushi-ish rolls , and the F Que wings to start. Flavorful is the best way to describe each dish as we sampled each others food. The Wings were cooked well and the sauce had me licking my fingers after every bite , The sushi Rolls we really good and they had a sauce that complimented them . I bit into one Wing and a piece of the meat fell on my shirt Alex was right there helping me out and promptly brought me a club soda to get rid of the stain (that's service right there) we all had a good laugh about how ""You know the food is good when you get some on yourself"" I laughed an agreed while wiping out that stain. We sat and waited only a small bit of time with our drinks as Alex asked if we were okay and if we needed anything else (very attentative) the drinks were pretty good maybe a bit over priced but they weren't watered down I'll tell you that. I had a Spiked Iced Tea while my girl had the Soco special I think - Both were made very good and had the right kick of alcohol. We requested that our Mac and Cheese be brought in with our Entrees - I had the Pecan Pork Chops while she tried the Red Velvet Waffle with chicken that the place is Famous for and that everyone loves.NOW I assumed Mac and Cheese would be some small bowl or a small helping made for 1 person . This is not the case what we got was A Medium Skillet with a Mushroom Cloud of Mac and Cheese , I was Floored by the size and then again by the taste. It was like Homemade Baked Mac and Cheese that was just so tasty. My Pork Chops came with Sweet potatoes and Collard Greens. The porckchops were cooked perfectly and the topping of mushrooms on it mixed with the collard greens and sweet potatos created an explosion of amazing when I tried it all at once. nothing felt out of place. I finished it all and my Girl even had some as well and loved it. Her Red velvet waffle was made pretty well the syrup wasn't too thick and the batter for the chicken complimented the waffle , the combo was well worth the praise others give it. In the end she couldn't finish her food or share of Mac and Cheese and they packed up our food in re-usable containers (nice touch there) and it was still a lot of food. I had to sit back and actually say ""This is the first time I spent this much but felt Like I got every dollars worth"" I was full and I can Eat a lot so that's saying something as most places like around the City will have meals at the same price but you will leave feeling unfulfilled. Not in this case , Full was full for me and my girl. SADLY we didn't know they had dessert and I would have loved to have had some Smores to top off the food but we had a movie to catch . I calculated the bill in my head with tax and everything and Lo and behold it was more or less what the bill came out to be - Most placed you would assume a number and it would be way off. I gave a good Tip to Alex who if you can get him as your waiter do so . And everyone thanked us for coming by even the Security ( I think it was Security). Everyone was very well mannered and polite the atmosphere was great and chill , LOL even the bathroom felt comfortable and had Books ....yeah books to read. I gotta say that the only weird bit was when they asked my girl to remove her hat as there was a no hat policy ...It was part of her outfit but it wasn't a issue just kinda weird. All in all I loved this place and yes you may look at the menu and question the prices but don't the portions are good and filling. The staff are all helpful and side not e I liked that they had the Water in Those old school bottles that they sat at our table. It all was very nice and Alex deserves a lot of praise for being cool and overall a great waiter. Thanks",5.0
"Great contemporary decor, though I would not have guessed it for a southern fried chicken place. It's pretty much one of those loud brunch places. I didn't mind at all, as long as the food was good. Staff was friendly and service was quick enough for a Saturday brunch spot.The gumbo was delicious and I really enjoyed it. The F-Que (pronounced exactly ""f"" and ""q"" - supposedly a reference to the French Quarter) was good though the Mediterranean dipping sauce, tzatziki, didn't go with it at all. What they needed was something richer and not as watery. The cornbread was good.Based on the Yelp review, I had the red velvet waffles and fried chicken, which was very mediocre. I thought it was going to be an actual red velvet flavored waffle and not a red velvet cake in a waffle shape. It was dry, and the bland syrup they provided was not helpful in saving it. Which brings me to the chicken - that was disappointingly dry and lacking flavor, as well. The skin was crispy, thankfully, but the meat was meh. Also had the pork chops, which were well seasoned outside but over cooked on the inside. It was dry and sad.This place wasn't horrible. It was just good, not great. I enjoyed the cocktails and the apps so I'd come back, but will definitely try something else.",3.0
"Went here back in October after I'd heard about this place on Instagram, thanks to Chef Roble. Chicken and waffles is my favorite brunch menu item, so I consider it my personal mission in life to frequent all establishments offering them in style. Soco BK does not disappoint. My food was absolute HEAVEN! I think I actually died and came back, although that could've been from star-sighting CHEF ROBLE there moreso than the food. Go figure! Lol. The fried chicken and red velvet waffles are DELICIOUS!!! My only issue with the dish would be the parts of chicken that they serve with it. (Thighs & drums, I believe) I wish they served it with white meat instead of dark, as I don't enjoy dark meat much and therefore wound up leaving at least half of the chicken on the plate. (They may actually be able to accommodate the substitution, but I didn't ask. I will next time though! :) ) The macaroni & cheese was almost orgasmic. I have no clue what they made it with, but it is easily in the top 3 macaroni & cheese dishes I've ever had. They offer an unlimited mimosa option during brunch hours, which I THOROUGHLY appreciate & happen to think obligatory lol. The food was good, service was good, crowd was nice. A win in my book!",5.0
"Hands down one of the greatest brunch menus ever. Everything looks amazing and tastes even better - rich in flavor. I had the chicken and waffles as my main meal and it was worth the journey to Brooklyn! And that mac and cheese, and those wings, topped with a couple mimosas...speechless. When you have Lawrence at your table expect nothing but great service. But be careful not to order too much - it's so good it gets you really full.",5.0

Also, I was wearing sneakers and a hoodie, but they were $300 sneakers and a $200 hoodie. I could barely hear our server talk because of how loud it was and it seemed like he was getting annoyed with having to repeat things.  The busser was attentive.

"I went to soco last night on a date. It was so lively and loud lol. The seating is close but not too close. First we were seated in the main dinning area which was on noise level 100. But they moved us to the patio because they had a large party coming, which I didn't mind because it was quieter. Now the food. The food at this place was sooooooo amazing. My date & I shared the a appetizer, we had Carolina rolls. Once I took a bite I wish I ordered two because I wanted one plate for myself. For entree I had lobster shrimp and grits which was amazing! The staff was so friendly. The drinks were great. They music had me dancing in my seat & singing along the whole night. I can't wait to go back. I would recommend this place to anyone",5.0
Nice atmosphere. They had great seating. Although the I stayed by the bar the food was way better then I expected. I would definitely be coming back here for the Mac n cheese. Sangria was very good also.,4.0
"This is one of those places you hear about from a  friend or family member and get intrigued about. Me and my Girl decided that we should try it and after seeing so many great reviews I figured it should be worth it. I was completely right and then some. When we arrived we were promptly seated and got to choose where we sat - We chose to sit all the way in the back that is kinda like outside but covered and heated. it was actually rather romantic. Our Waiter came by - Alex who is a very chill guy very mello , not pushy and never rushed us. He made us feel very welcomed and made a suggestion or two here and there. We ordered the  The Sushi-ish rolls , and the F Que wings to start. Flavorful is the best way to describe each dish as we sampled each others food. The Wings were cooked well and the sauce had me licking my fingers after every bite , The sushi Rolls we really good and they had a sauce that complimented them . I bit into one Wing and a piece of the meat fell on my shirt Alex was right there helping me out and promptly brought me a club soda to get rid of the stain (that's service right there) we all had a good laugh about how ""You know the food is good when you get some on yourself"" I laughed an agreed while wiping out that stain. We sat and waited only a small bit of time with our drinks as Alex asked if we were okay and if we needed anything else (very attentative) the drinks were pretty good maybe a bit over priced but they weren't watered down I'll tell you that. I had a Spiked Iced Tea while my girl had the Soco special I think - Both were made very good and had the right kick of alcohol. We requested that our Mac and Cheese be brought in with our Entrees - I had the Pecan Pork Chops while she tried the Red Velvet Waffle with chicken that the place is Famous for and that everyone loves.NOW I assumed Mac and Cheese would be some small bowl or a small helping made for 1 person . This is not the case what we got was A Medium Skillet with a Mushroom Cloud of Mac and Cheese , I was Floored by the size and then again by the taste. It was like Homemade Baked Mac and Cheese that was just so tasty. My Pork Chops came with Sweet potatoes and Collard Greens. The porckchops were cooked perfectly and the topping of mushrooms on it mixed with the collard greens and sweet potatos created an explosion of amazing when I tried it all at once. nothing felt out of place. I finished it all and my Girl even had some as well and loved it. Her Red velvet waffle was made pretty well the syrup wasn't too thick and the batter for the chicken complimented the waffle , the combo was well worth the praise others give it. In the end she couldn't finish her food or share of Mac and Cheese and they packed up our food in re-usable containers (nice touch there) and it was still a lot of food. I had to sit back and actually say ""This is the first time I spent this much but felt Like I got every dollars worth"" I was full and I can Eat a lot so that's saying something as most places like around the City will have meals at the same price but you will leave feeling unfulfilled. Not in this case , Full was full for me and my girl. SADLY we didn't know they had dessert and I would have loved to have had some Smores to top off the food but we had a movie to catch . I calculated the bill in my head with tax and everything and Lo and behold it was more or less what the bill came out to be - Most placed you would assume a number and it would be way off. I gave a good Tip to Alex who if you can get him as your waiter do so . And everyone thanked us for coming by even the Security ( I think it was Security). Everyone was very well mannered and polite the atmosphere was great and chill , LOL even the bathroom felt comfortable and had Books ....yeah books to read. I gotta say that the only weird bit was when they asked my girl to remove her hat as there was a no hat policy ...It was part of her outfit but it wasn't a issue just kinda weird. All in all I loved this place and yes you may look at the menu and question the prices but don't the portions are good and filling. The staff are all helpful and side not e I liked that they had the Water in Those old school bottles that they sat at our table. It all was very nice and Alex deserves a lot of praise for being cool and overall a great waiter. Thanks",5.0
"Great contemporary decor, though I would not have guessed it for a southern fried chicken place. It's pretty much one of those loud brunch places. I didn't mind at all, as long as the food was good. Staff was friendly and service was quick enough for a Saturday brunch spot.The gumbo was delicious and I really enjoyed it. The F-Que (pronounced exactly ""f"" and ""q"" - supposedly a reference to the French Quarter) was good though the Mediterranean dipping sauce, tzatziki, didn't go with it at all. What they needed was something richer and not as watery. The cornbread was good.Based on the Yelp review, I had the red velvet waffles and fried chicken, which was very mediocre. I thought it was going to be an actual red velvet flavored waffle and not a red velvet cake in a waffle shape. It was dry, and the bland syrup they provided was not helpful in saving it. Which brings me to the chicken - that was disappointingly dry and lacking flavor, as well. The skin was crispy, thankfully, but the meat was meh. Also had the pork chops, which were well seasoned outside but over cooked on the inside. It was dry and sad.This place wasn't horrible. It was just good, not great. I enjoyed the cocktails and the apps so I'd come back, but will definitely try something else.",3.0
"Went here back in October after I'd heard about this place on Instagram, thanks to Chef Roble. Chicken and waffles is my favorite brunch menu item, so I consider it my personal mission in life to frequent all establishments offering them in style. Soco BK does not disappoint. My food was absolute HEAVEN! I think I actually died and came back, although that could've been from star-sighting CHEF ROBLE there moreso than the food. Go figure! Lol. The fried chicken and red velvet waffles are DELICIOUS!!! My only issue with the dish would be the parts of chicken that they serve with it. (Thighs & drums, I believe) I wish they served it with white meat instead of dark, as I don't enjoy dark meat much and therefore wound up leaving at least half of the chicken on the plate. (They may actually be able to accommodate the substitution, but I didn't ask. I will next time though! :) ) The macaroni & cheese was almost orgasmic. I have no clue what they made it with, but it is easily in the top 3 macaroni & cheese dishes I've ever had. They offer an unlimited mimosa option during brunch hours, which I THOROUGHLY appreciate & happen to think obligatory lol. The food was good, service was good, crowd was nice. A win in my book!",5.0
"Hands down one of the greatest brunch menus ever. Everything looks amazing and tastes even better - rich in flavor. I had the chicken and waffles as my main meal and it was worth the journey to Brooklyn! And that mac and cheese, and those wings, topped with a couple mimosas...speechless. When you have Lawrence at your table expect nothing but great service. But be careful not to order too much - it's so good it gets you really full.",5.0
"JUNE 13 saw restaurant on my tablet, told my Aunt, she had a taste for some soup preferably black eye peas, but after we found So Co we decided to give it a try for lunch on June 16th-the waiter that met us as we entered was very courteous, should have gotten his name, we asjed him if we were parked ok where we were, stoped us from getting a ticket and paid the the parking meterfor us. Auntie got the red beans and rice and I got the shrimp gumbo, delicious,",4.0
"Amazing food. Horrible service. Maybe it was because of how we were dressed and maybe they thought we weren't going to spend any money because we didn't order drinks. My fiancé doesn't drink alcohol because of health issues. I tried to order sparkling water and they gave me club soda. I looked around and saw other people were drinking Pellegrino. Also, I was wearing sneakers and a hoodie, but they were $300 sneakers and a $200 hoodie. I could barely hear our server talk because of how loud it was and it seemed like he was getting annoyed with having to repeat things.  The busser was attentive. We didn't get offered a dessert menu, didn't want any at that point, paid our check and left a large tip so hopefully they don't treat others like this again.",1.0

The salad was good and the mac and cheese taste very similar to the garlic/cheese bread that came with the mussels. My friends ordered the short ribs and lobster, shrimp and grits. the short ribs was just ok, nothing worth talking about. The lobster, shrimp and grits was good. But their fried chicken and waffles were really good. I enjoyed that a lot but the chicken is on the small size and they cut the breast meat in half which made it seem smaller. I can only assume it's because it's organic. Half a breast, a wing, and a thigh with a red velvet waffle. It was enough for me though. Just letting those with bigger appetites know.Beware that they included tips into their checks at around 18%. I don't necessarily like that cause our service didn't do much, another bus boy did more than him. Our server took like 1/2 hr to get our check when we were just next to the register.

"Let's cut to the chase.  Us internet savvy, instagram obsessed people have all seen it.  The red velvet chicken and waffles.  Seems like a natural combination, right?  Well I can finally say, it definitely lives up to the hype.  Generous portion of fried chicken on a red cloud of waffle goodness--what more can you ask for? Well, it turns out at SoCo, you can ask for so much more! Yelpers, if you only go to SoCo for the fried chicken and waffle, you are doing it wrong.  The rest of the menu cannot be ignored--the food is simply so damn good.  My dining companion and I decided to order more food than our table could handle (seriously, we were eating off of two tables).  For the sake of clarity, let me give you a list of what we ordered with my notes: SHORT RIB PIZZA: Just do it.  Seriously.  Meat. Bread. Cheese.  That's all it is and frankly that's all you need in life.  Don't skip this appetizer, because this truly got me excited for the rest of the meal. PECAN CRUSTED PORK CHOP: All the flavors going on in this dish are so incredibly thoughtful.  Every time I went in, I needed a bit of everything.  The braised collard greens and citrus mashed sweet potato--the slight zing of the potatoes and the saltiness of the greens were just MAGIC.  That might be the meal highlight for me and I didn't even get to the part where the pork chop was amazing.  Guys, the pork chop WAS amazing. FRESH FRIED BRANZINO: Served as a whole fish with some dirty rice.  So glad my dining partner ordered this and so happy he shared with me.  Perfectly crispy, perfectly buttery.  The meat of the fish was light and did not lose the perfect flakiness in the frying process.  It was served as a whole fish but definitely deboned.  So good!FRIED CHICKEN: We had to get this to split for the table.  But honestly, it was almost completely ignored because the rest of the food was so delicious.  Oh yeah, and let's not forget their immensely creative cocktail list that I completely disregarded because the minute I saw the Blueberry Bourbon Sour, I didn't need to look any further.  Such a simple cocktail.  It was so good, I needed to get TWO.  I'll have to go back to gather an opinion on the rest of the cocktail list.  Last but definitely not least, the dining experience at SoCo was so great.  Service was impeccable.  It is a very relaxed vibe and ambiance packed with some serious eaters.   Yes, you feel sleek and sexy the minute you walk in but ain't nobody eating a side salad up in here!  You came here for comfort and with every single fork-full, YOU REALLY GOT IT. Can't wait to come back!  Truly!",5.0
"I once again celebrated a birthday at SoCo I 7/13/13. I chose brunch this time because the menu seemed to have more options. During this time they were offering unlimited mimosas for $12 per person for one hour. These were in fact really good. The food was  hot, fresh and delicious. My daughter chose the red velvet waffles and chicken, I did not understand the $4 extra for white meat but, what ever? She chose the Mac and cheese and of course the collard greens. She is very picky however she enjoyed everything except the desert. The strawberry shortcake appeared to be just thrown together and it did not taste home made. I really don't care for desert so it was not a problem for me. My choice was the craw fish cakes with eggs Benedict, I enjoyed it including the bed a lettuce it came with. My friend had the sliders and said it was tasty. The service was good. We were seated in the outside area which was very sunny. I recommend anyone to check out the Saturday brunch, it is the reason for the five stars. Do yourself a favor make reservations and go early.  I probably would have had brunch there for this past birthday 7/13/14 however, I'm a foodie and I needed to try other places.",5.0

"I will never go here again.  On November 15, 2014 I went for a birthday dinner for a friend.  It was a Saturday night and crowded but our group of 6 had to wait over an hour for our table.  We had a 10:00pm reservation and still had to wait.  The birthday girl requested a seat away from the front door.  When she reminded the hostess of this, we had to wait ANOTHER 30 minutes and then we got seat in the back courtyard place.  After the birthday girl was given an incorrect drink order, she was told she had to wait for another one because there were NO MORE CLEAN GLASSES. While waiting for the food and drinks, another patron noticed something CRAWLING on the walls.  It was a CENTIPEDE!.  It crawled into one the plants and we alert the waiter.  A few minutes later, a SECOND CENTIPEDE appeared.  We asked to have our table moved inside, which caused another 10 minute wait.  We still had not eaten.  By the time we got a new table, around midnight, the food we were given was cold and hard.  The worst part, however, was the nonchalant attitude of the manager, who told our group that there was ""nothing she could do"" about the centipedes.  She offered to take 20% off of the total bill, which was approximately $4.  When questioned about the 20% she said that was ""all she could do,"" and she sent the waiter to handle the rest of our meal wrap-up.  He said that the manager ""just wanted to get this situation over with"" and asked him to deal with the bill.I was HIGHLY disappointed with the customer service at this place.  I WOULD NOT recommend eating here.",1.0
Every time that I've been here the good is scrumptious. Today knocked my socks off. I had the Strawberry Shortcake French Toast that was drizzled in Mango Butter. LORD. This was everything and more.

Note: if you have to choose between SoCo and Wray's... Run - don't walk - to SoCo!!! Friends and I initially were seated at Wray's to try them out and all five of us were displeased.

The fried chicken with red velvet waffles is a safe dish to get, since it's so popular, but we also felt we've had better friend chicken elsewhere. I don't think I'd venture so far to come here again but the six of us really did like the decor and really enjoyed our brunch together there. I noticed there was a line outside before it opened at 12 and the place continued to stay packed throughout our whole time there so I'd recommend making a reservation during popular brunch times.",3.0

"SoCo has been on my list of places to check out for a while; however, it had always been just a bit too far out of the way. I recently found myself in the neighborhood around dinner time and made a b-line for the restaurant.Upon getting there I was greeted by a bouncer (really?) who informed me that I would have to remove my hat if I wanted to go in. So much for casual attire. I cruise up to the host with some mean hat hair and, despite the place being packed, am able to get seated right away. Our waitress was friendly and attentive. I ordered a cucumber something or other to drink as it sounded like a nice refreshing drink to have on an early summer evening. Despite the fact that it was supposed to be mixed with gin and a few other ingredients the only thing I could taste was cucumber. Drinking it through a straw was out if the question as it was constantly getting blocked up with cucumber guts. We ordered the mussels for our appetizer which quickly came out and were devoured even faster - good job there. Then we waited... And waited... And waited some more for our entrees. Finally they arrive. My plate looked like I ordered fries with a side of cheeseburger - there had to be enough to feed a family. But really, I'm a fatty at heart and love french fries, so I was celebrating on the inside. The fries had a great crispy texture; however, they tasted overcooked/burnt. My burger was just ok. My girlfriend had the lobster, shrimp and grits and said the lobster was a bit rubbery and had a bit of an off-putting flavor. Overall I left feeling a bit underwhelmed. The prices felt a bit high for the quality of the food and drinks. The atmosphere a bit too sleek and industrial for southern comfort food. This city has it's fair share of amazing southern spots and the next time I'm in the mood my hat and I will probably travel elsewhere.",2.0
"From the atmosphere, to the staff, to the food....5 hands down! I came here mid afternoon after work & got right to it. I ordered the (typical lol) chicken & red velvet waffles & a side of white cheddar grits when the food came.

The waffle was great & also my first red velvet dish ever & the chicken was hot, crispy & seasoned by Jesus Christ himself! It's kinda out of the way for me to just jump up & go to, but I'll definitely be back. Damn that chicken!!! Realistically you're looking at $20+ a plate, but definitely worth every cent!

Every time that I've been here the good is scrumptious. Today knocked my socks off. I had the Strawberry Shortcake French Toast that was drizzled in Mango Butter. LORD. This was everything and more. My friends had similar items for brunch and thoroughly enjoyed their meals. The drinks are great. The service is great. The appetizers are all amazing. Note: if you have to choose between SoCo and Wray's... Run - don't walk - to SoCo!!! Friends and I initially were seated at Wray's to try them out and all five of us were displeased. But this isn't about Wray's.... Go to SoCo ^_^,4.0
"We shared all the apps, were short rib pizza, ribs and the wings. Every thing was perfect and delicious. I had the jambalaya and it was great!",4.0
"Great service and food. They get the food out quickly. Our server was nice, but had too many tables to focus on us and often times forgot a few of our requests. They don't do drink and food substitutions which is a bummer, but tolerable. We were able to get a table during brunch on a Saturday with little to no wait. The food is well seasoned and their butter (my weakness) is also bomb",4.0
"The mac and cheese is delicious!!! But that's really the only thing the whole group I went with loved. Their wings and cornbread were good too but the blueberry lemonade I had was way too sweet so I had to water it down with ice and another cup. I didn't like my Clinton Hill Omelette at all - the eggs were bland and it just wasn't my cup of tea. The fried chicken with red velvet waffles is a safe dish to get, since it's so popular, but we also felt we've had better friend chicken elsewhere. I don't think I'd venture so far to come here again but the six of us really did like the decor and really enjoyed our brunch together there. I noticed there was a line outside before it opened at 12 and the place continued to stay packed throughout our whole time there so I'd recommend making a reservation during popular brunch times.",3.0
"The bartender lady was very attitudish, reach for my credit card and when i told i was not ready to pay told me to keep my card to myself i reminded her she reached for it i did not give her anything I've had better chicken from popeyes it had no taste. SocoIts So-corney.",1.0
"SoCo has been on my list of places to check out for a while; however, it had always been just a bit too far out of the way. I recently found myself in the neighborhood around dinner time and made a b-line for the restaurant.Upon getting there I was greeted by a bouncer (really?) who informed me that I would have to remove my hat if I wanted to go in. So much for casual attire. I cruise up to the host with some mean hat hair and, despite the place being packed, am able to get seated right away. Our waitress was friendly and attentive. I ordered a cucumber something or other to drink as it sounded like a nice refreshing drink to have on an early summer evening. Despite the fact that it was supposed to be mixed with gin and a few other ingredients the only thing I could taste was cucumber. Drinking it through a straw was out if the question as it was constantly getting blocked up with cucumber guts. We ordered the mussels for our appetizer which quickly came out and were devoured even faster - good job there. Then we waited... And waited... And waited some more for our entrees. Finally they arrive. My plate looked like I ordered fries with a side of cheeseburger - there had to be enough to feed a family. But really, I'm a fatty at heart and love french fries, so I was celebrating on the inside. The fries had a great crispy texture; however, they tasted overcooked/burnt. My burger was just ok. My girlfriend had the lobster, shrimp and grits and said the lobster was a bit rubbery and had a bit of an off-putting flavor. Overall I left feeling a bit underwhelmed. The prices felt a bit high for the quality of the food and drinks. The atmosphere a bit too sleek and industrial for southern comfort food. This city has it's fair share of amazing southern spots and the next time I'm in the mood my hat and I will probably travel elsewhere.",2.0
"From the atmosphere, to the staff, to the food....5 hands down! I came here mid afternoon after work & got right to it. I ordered the (typical lol) chicken & red velvet waffles & a side of white cheddar grits when the food came. I had the sweet tea which was incredible & the bartender hooked me up with a little more of it for free! The food comes out....the presentation was amazing as I expected. The waffle was great & also my first red velvet dish ever & the chicken was hot, crispy & seasoned by Jesus Christ himself! It's kinda out of the way for me to just jump up & go to, but I'll definitely be back. Damn that chicken!!! Realistically you're looking at $20+ a plate, but definitely worth every cent! Or dollar in this case...Enjoy!",5.0
Still dreaming about their Mac & Cheese. One of the best in the city. Top 3 in Brooklyn. Service is always awesome. Food is perfection. I wish I lived in Brooklyn. I'd be there way more often.,5.0
The mac and cheese is EVERYTHING! Plus I love the atmosphere it's great for a date or ladies night. I can't wait to spend some summer nights there,5.0
"Their food is absolutely delicious. I came in for brunch a while back and ordered the chicken and red velvet waffles. I went to school in the south and I am accustomed to great chicken and waffles. This one definitely met my expectations. The waffle was so soft and fluffy. The chicken was not packed with too much flavor it was just simply seasoned. It was really good. The portion size is great.If you like to drink, the all you can drink mimosa option is great. However, I didn't like that it was timed and the waitress seemed very strict on reminding us we didn't have much time left. That would have been fine if she was constantly refilling drinks but she was very absent and we didn't feel like we got enough in the allotted timeframe. Would come back in the future, definitely.",4.0
"Ms. ASo I've always loved this restaurant. I suggest it to everyone. I visit quite often for their brunch.. however this past weekend 10/24/15, i took my friend who was visiting from N. Carolina. The manager GREGORY changed my attitude about ever coming back...The server suggested a specialty drink and his description made it sound so good i decided to try it... well at first sip i was not a lover of it and i requested a prior drink that I figured i couldnt go wrong with. A few moments later Gregory the sarcastic manager comes over and says he's sorry i didnt like the drink but he has to charge me bcause it was a special drink ... excuse me??? I didnt know it was mandatory that i like the drink which tasted nothing like its description ... his response.... with a sarcastic pause was ""im sorry but yes u have to pay even if u didnt like it"" instead of making a scene... i knew i had an out of time visitor with me... so i bit the bullet and paid for a drink that i took one sip of.... To add fuel to the fire.. i asked the server to.ask the manager to give the name of his supervisor... he doesnt even have the guts to come over to my table... bcause he was ""busy""... And his sarcastic self  suggested that i write a review.. so here you go...Future customers... please NOTE it is mandatory that you like your drink bcause u will get charged!",2.0
"Perhaps it's because I know what true Southern and Cajun food tastes like why I found some parts of my meal to be amazeballs and other parts to be...well, terrible. First and foremost, I like that this place hasn't been super freaking gentrified like much of the rest of Brooklyn but is still classy, well decorated, crisp, modern, and fun. It's like the best of both worlds lol! Sometimes it gets hard being the only brown person in sight lol so this was a relief.  The outdoor seating area also remained true to form, and was tastefully decorated in classic, modern stylings as well. FOOD: My appetizer - Gumbo - was aightttttttt and the Dirty Rice was blandddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddd. For all its ingredients, I'm surprised it tasted so much like.... air (O_o) Literally, like nothing. I think eating my own hair would have been more flavorful. My drink, the moonshine something or other, was meh. Wouldn't order again. HOWEVER (!!!!!!!!!!!!!!), my entrée - the pork chops - were DELICIOUS!!! Two enormous battered/fried pork chops came out, with delicious citrus infused sweet potato mash and other vegetables...and Lord have mercy ::wipes sweat:: !! The Devil's meat done got me lol! I have been craving it ever since I had it. I haven't eaten anything fried in years, but this was worth it.Also, the cornbread ::sigh:: LORD HAVE MERCY, THE CORNBREAD. That ish so good I was about to start African dancin' lol. I don't know if that cornbread is some special brand of Jiffy or if it is made from scratch but seriously, it was some of the best cornbread I have ever had. Red Rooster could learn a few (meaning thousands) of lessons from this place. I wish I could gobble up 100s of these decadent, divine, wonderful little pieces of heaven!!!!!! (I want to put tons more exclamation marks really, to express my love of their cornbread). Overall, I will DEFINITELY be back...because Lord Jesus, that cornbread lol.",4.0

"After reading all these GREAT reviews about the mac & cheese, I finally went to Soco. I ordered 2 orders of chicken and waffles (one for me, one for the Boo) and an order of mac & cheese. We brought the food home, I placed the food into the oven for a few minutes and my kitchen all of a sudden had a strong garlic smell. The mac & cheese was OVERLOADED with garlic, beyond belief! We rarely ever throw food in the garbage and guess where that mac & cheese went? The photos I've seen of the mac & cheese are deceiving. There was not one ounce of cheddar, it was all white cheese. The chicken and waffles were nothing to write home about. Chicken lacked seasoning, had NO flavor at all and the syrup was heavily diluted, we just grabbed some good old Aunt Jemima from the kitchen. I should have saved my $54 and made my own damn mac & cheese for 1/6 the price. Will not be going back. So disappointed.",1.0

While the chicken was tasty, it was basically chopped up pieces of a breast and a wing, which equates to half a breast and a wing.  With that said, I ate everything on my plate and was full afterwards (my eyes are a;ways bigger than my stomach).My red velvet pancake was hella sweet.

I ordered the red velvet waffles w/ fried chicken and my boyfriend had ordered the salmon.As for the waffles, they were delicious although I found the chicken to be a bit dry on the inside.

Went to the restaurant at 8p on Friday. If want a table right away you have to make reservations.  The wait time is at least an hour.  The food was fine but will still return again.  I had the short ribs for my main course.  The portion sizes are big. If you get appetizer I recommend sharing.  My only negative is the wait time for drinks and food to arrive.  The waiter was nice and apologized for the long wait time.  He gave us corn bread while we waited.,4.0
"Ok, so let me just say that the Chicken and Waffles and Shrimp Po'boys are my absolute favorite dishes on their menu! My family and I had brunch at SoCo New Years day and the staff was very accommodating with having to tend to our large party of 20, including children. The brunch cocktails were tasty, but I preferred the sangria which had a bit of a kick to it. The only down side to SoCo is the menu pricing. In my humble opinion, Fried Chicken and Waffles shouldn't be $20, however, to treat myself every now and again I don't mind spending a little extra. Keywords here...every now and again.",4.0
"Um chicken and red velvet waffles - what else do you need to hear? Okay fine, delicious drinks, delicious foods, yummy mac & cheese, and again - fried chicken and RED VELVET WAFFLES.

"Beautiful space! I loved the ambiance and the servers' uniforms (jeans and a shirt). In observance of Father's Day, there was a special brunch menu. I ordered the $14 strawberry shortcake French toast. It was definitely different, but I was disappointed because the cream cheese overpowered the French toast. Though I loved the place, I would not recommend this dish. Whenever I revisit, I just might order the red velvet waffle and fried chicken, which my friend ordered and loved.",3.0
Food is tasty... A group of us went for Sunday brunch. We had reservations at 12pm. Note... The place opened at 12 and there was a wait of an hr. Ppl were standing in front of the Resturant to get in before it opened. Word of advice make a reservation for Sunday brunch! I had the red velvet waffles and chicken. Pretty good. I would eat here again. Mac and cheese not so great! But breakfast was def Dellishis !!!!!!!,4.0
Been meaning to write this review for some time now. Been there twice. Once for fathers day brunch and another time for birthday dinner. I preferred the brunch. I guess because it was daytime and less crowded and noisy.Great mimosa's. Think i had the asian chicken both times as well. Was good. Large serving. Want to go back and try chicken and waffles. Wish the venue was larger cause it does get crowded. And you better have a reservation unless you want to wait for an hour by the door.,4.0
"Myrtle Ave is really changing. Soco is a great spot,  perfect for any occasion and time of year.  Even in the dead of winter and being seated outside we still had a good time. Brian is the BEST server, I mean hands down if he's not there I'm not going. Will definitely be back!",4.0
Everything was amazing.  I had the pulled pork and Mac and cheese.  I wish I had the recipe for these and cheese. Heavenly. Our waiter Tim was great. Very attentive. I will definitely return.,5.0
"I tried the chicken & waffle because it was one of their popular items, but I didn't think the waffle was that great (it didn't even have the taste of red velvet). The chicken was good though (seasoned). My favorite item of the night was the mac&cheese.",3.0
"Nice place, good food! The intent was to go to Wrays, a neighboring restaurant but they were closed so we wandered into this spot and boy am I glad we did. I had the Buttermilk fried chicken and red velvet waffle and it was unexpectedly delicious! My date also agreed, he had the F-Que wings with Mac and cheese that was to die for. The wait was a tad bit long but I'd definitely recommend this spot.",4.0
Went to the restaurant at 8p on Friday. If want a table right away you have to make reservations.  The wait time is at least an hour.  The food was fine but will still return again.  I had the short ribs for my main course.  The portion sizes are big. If you get appetizer I recommend sharing.  My only negative is the wait time for drinks and food to arrive.  The waiter was nice and apologized for the long wait time.  He gave us corn bread while we waited.,4.0
"Ok, so let me just say that the Chicken and Waffles and Shrimp Po'boys are my absolute favorite dishes on their menu! My family and I had brunch at SoCo New Years day and the staff was very accommodating with having to tend to our large party of 20, including children. The brunch cocktails were tasty, but I preferred the sangria which had a bit of a kick to it. The only down side to SoCo is the menu pricing. In my humble opinion, Fried Chicken and Waffles shouldn't be $20, however, to treat myself every now and again I don't mind spending a little extra. Keywords here...every now and again.",4.0
"Um chicken and red velvet waffles - what else do you need to hear? Okay fine, delicious drinks, delicious foods, yummy mac & cheese, and again - fried chicken and RED VELVET WAFFLES. So good.One less star for the bored waitress who didn't really check in much. Otherwise great scene and great food.",4.0
"Beautiful space! I loved the ambiance and the servers' uniforms (jeans and a shirt). In observance of Father's Day, there was a special brunch menu. I ordered the $14 strawberry shortcake French toast. It was definitely different, but I was disappointed because the cream cheese overpowered the French toast. Though I loved the place, I would not recommend this dish. Whenever I revisit, I just might order the red velvet waffle and fried chicken, which my friend ordered and loved.",3.0
Food is tasty... A group of us went for Sunday brunch. We had reservations at 12pm. Note... The place opened at 12 and there was a wait of an hr. Ppl were standing in front of the Resturant to get in before it opened. Word of advice make a reservation for Sunday brunch! I had the red velvet waffles and chicken. Pretty good. I would eat here again. Mac and cheese not so great! But breakfast was def Dellishis !!!!!!!,4.0
Been meaning to write this review for some time now. Been there twice. Once for fathers day brunch and another time for birthday dinner. I preferred the brunch.

I came for a friends birthday party and we were a party of seven. The place quickly became packed within a 15 minute window. My friends ate there before so I knew that I was in store for some really good soul food. I ordered the short ribs which came with mashed potatoes and broccoli. Our table ordered a pitcher of sangria which was also pretty tasty and had a nice ginger spin to it. The food was delicious and so was the ambience. My only reservation was that they only brought us out six pieces of cornbread and when we inquired about the seven piece of cornbread being that we had seven people with us they told us it would be an extra charge. Rule of advice...if seven people are eating at your establishment and spending hundreds of dollars don't be skimpy on the cornbread it's very tacky. Other than that it was a great experience and I would definitely go again.,4.0
"I'm sitting in a faraway place out there in NY state, a place they call Long Island. I will not be having this.

"Mmmmm Soco. I just can't get enough of you, can I? I had the chicken sand which for the first time. It was ah-mazing. It looked pretty simple: just the chicken , pickles and spicy mayo on a brioche bun, but whoa, watch out chick fil a bc I just found your replacement. The meat bun ratio was perfect. There were two patties, not too greasy but just the right amount of crisp with a touch of crunch. I got it with the salad which was a huge serving( half of the plate). I ate a big chunk of the salad and was still able to take home leftovers. I also got the Mardi gras drink.  During lunch or was only $7 for happy hour. I also tried the banana wonton.  While it was good , I likely won't get again. It was served with walnuts instead of pecans as the menu stated. And the banana mix inside of each wonton (3 total ) though tasty was brown and I couldn't really identify any bananas. Shrugs. I ate it anyhow and it all tasted pretty good going down.

There was about seven of us, so they sat us at an elevated corner table near the heated outdoor seated area. I liked the location, but it was very drafty because there was a cold air vent blowing in our direction. We complained to the waitress, but all they did was turn the heat on at five-minute intervals.

My chicken sandwich was huge. The bread was soft and slightly sweet, which was a great contrast to the chicken. I'm not a fan of overly hot-sauce spicy food, but I found myself adding hot sauce to my sandwich, which is much better than when the hot sauce is so unbearable that you don't taste any other flavor.

real cool place on a friday or sat night. they should get 5 stars for simply having a violinist playing biggie the night i went.

I ordered a dessert there once it was so terrible i sent it back guess it was so terrible i blocked it out of my memory because i cant remember what it was. On a warm summer night order the cucumber cooler soo good and soo refreshing.

"HmMnM.. Just freaking delicious. So impressed!I've been meaning to check out SoCo because of their signature red velvet & chicken waffle. I've been stalking all the pictures yelpers have been posting on their yelp page because it was such a fun and interesting concept. Let me just tell you... all the done-up lighting, artistic angled, filtered up pictures of the food I've come across doesn't nearly justify how amazing it tastes. Hm. Just hmmmmmm...SO. We arrived around 3:00PM on a Saturday and this place was PACKED.  SoCo is very spacious which I appreciate. Pretty decent bar space for past time and no unnecessary squeezing and hovering of strangers over you as you're waiting to be seated. Very casual setting. Basketball game on TV.  Instense crowd getting really into the game cheering and screaming but it was so fitting with the theme of the restaurant. My big brother and I were so eager to try everything that we ordered 5 things off their menu LOL.Appetizers1.  Cornbread. - GET ON THAT. Free with yelp check-in. The warm corn bread topped with mildly sweet butter was Hmpppp. On point.2. BBQ chicken Gumbo - really good3. F-Qued wings - really goodEntrés4. Aunt Cruz's Mac and Cheese - Mac and Cheese served on a skillet - explosive cheese flavor, by far the best mac and cheese I've ever had. That topped with Sriracha sauce that they gave us was just HMMMP5. Buttermilk Fried Chicken - redvelvet waffle topped with friend chicken.  I would have settled for my expectations of a semi-dry and mediocre tasting waffle like it looked in pictures but it was NOICCEE. It was sweet enough to do without the syrup. The fried chicken had such a uniqueee flavor. It's not your typical fried chicken flavor! So meaty, tender and moist, and served at perfect temperature.

"Came here for my birthday over the weekend and i would def come back again. There was an enclosed outdoor space where i was seated, so you are able to enjoy the sun and yet be in an air conditioned space. The waitress we have was attentive and friendly. Decor wise was very modern and sleek, I wouldn't be expecting something like this for  southern comfort food. And this is what I ordered:1. buttermilk pancake with chicken.. which was a red velvet waffle with a well seasoned fried chicken. Walking in I saw most table have at least one plate of this. So i thought this is a must try dish, and it was delicious. The chicken was well seasoned and moist. The red velvet waffle was moist and soft. def recommend trying this at least. 2. Mac and Cheese- this can probably serve 3 people or even 4. My fiance and I could only eat half. It was very creamy and not as cheesy. I wouldn't say is the best mac and cheese I have tried. I have tasted worst and this one is I am not crazy for but it was decent.3. Along with the meal I ordered my self a red wine sangria, which was sweet and very refreshing. I would recommend getting this rather then their SoCo sangria where you can taste thyme in there.",4.0
"This was my first time here on May 22 and I was dying to come out here and taste their red velvet waffles and fried chicken. Once I arrived and saw the menu and what it had to offer (not overly impressed) I quickly changed my mind. Greeted by Sim (a nice man) he asked was it my first time here and what did I want to order First order of business is to always start off a meal with a good drink. So that means a SoCo Caramel Martini with a toasted marshallow for garnish. Not bad for the taste bud (was a little strong for me) but hey it filled my curiousity. As I began to Yelp in I saw where I could have a free drink with my entree and was informed by my lovely bartender (Brian) that I should off before I do anything else before my meal.I decided to do something different what caught my eyes right away were the F-Que wings which are smoked roasted wings tossed in Soco's housemade pepper jelly sauce and served with tzatzki dip. No complaints here and loved every minute of licking my fingers, making sounds, as I chomped on freshly made wings with just the right amount of heat and sweet to them. Finally, I made my decision to order the lobster, shrimp and grits entree. And my taste buds died and went to heaven. The grits mixed with white cheddar were just amazing and I ate those all up before I even touched the few shrimp and one lobster tail. While enjoying my food I was introduced to a 2012 South African rose glass of wine that hit the spot. It was so smooth that a second glass had to be done. As both the entree and glasses of wine were finished, I went for my free drink. Known as a the Mardi Gras/Tropical Punch (sorry cannot remember) it is a sweet drink with a mix of nutmeg and cinnamon. Not for everyone but it was a new taste I enjoyed.So what are my final thoughts of this place? Is it worth it? Well for me no I already had my fill but if you haven't tried their menu or went to enjoy the decor from time to time then just do so.What do I think is worth it? Just supporting two brothas doing their thing and in a positive aspect. The neighborhood is absolutely wonderful and if you want take a walk through Brooklyn old school and new take a quick hike up Myrtle Avenue and enjoy the sights and sounds",3.0
"I'm updating my review because I believe management got it right! The nasty floor manager has not been seen since my last review and since I'm a regular I think it's pretty safe to say they pulled her from the floor.. At least I hope they did :) Anyway, I couldn't go another day without updating because from the door man, the hostesses, the bar staff ladies and our favorite wait staff  (Torrie and Rob) they make our experience awesome every time we go.

Literally the best gumbo I've ever had in my life. After living in the south for 10 years I believe I have had some of the best southern food to compare this to.  I was highly impressed with their gumbo.  The fried chicken and red velvet waffles were delicious however I would have liked some more herbs or seasoning in the chicken in order to add some more depth to the plate.  The servers were great and the ambience was very nice as well.,5.0
"Its simple: great food, great attentive staff, and the mac and cheese to die for! I have tried several mac and cheese shops and this is by far the best! Make sure you don't leave without getting the MAC AND CHEESE!!",5.0
"Trendy decor with a violinist playing along to the music set the stage for a perfect Sunday brunch. I ordered sausage and grits- sausage was a bit too salty, grits runny but tasty, & eggs were just eggs.I sampled from almost everyone at the table. The chicken and waffles was my favorite. The mac and cheese left me wanting for more once I got home.I will definitely be back!The food was 8/10...drinks10/10.",4.0
"HmMnM.. Just freaking delicious. So impressed!I've been meaning to check out SoCo because of their signature red velvet & chicken waffle. I've been stalking all the pictures yelpers have been posting on their yelp page because it was such a fun and interesting concept. Let me just tell you... all the done-up lighting, artistic angled, filtered up pictures of the food I've come across doesn't nearly justify how amazing it tastes. Hm. Just hmmmmmm...SO. We arrived around 3:00PM on a Saturday and this place was PACKED.  SoCo is very spacious which I appreciate. Pretty decent bar space for past time and no unnecessary squeezing and hovering of strangers over you as you're waiting to be seated. Very casual setting. Basketball game on TV.  Instense crowd getting really into the game cheering and screaming but it was so fitting with the theme of the restaurant. My big brother and I were so eager to try everything that we ordered 5 things off their menu LOL.Appetizers1.  Cornbread. - GET ON THAT. Free with yelp check-in. The warm corn bread topped with mildly sweet butter was Hmpppp. On point.2. BBQ chicken Gumbo - really good3. F-Qued wings - really goodEntrés4. Aunt Cruz's Mac and Cheese - Mac and Cheese served on a skillet - explosive cheese flavor, by far the best mac and cheese I've ever had. That topped with Sriracha sauce that they gave us was just HMMMP5. Buttermilk Fried Chicken - redvelvet waffle topped with friend chicken.  I would have settled for my expectations of a semi-dry and mediocre tasting waffle like it looked in pictures but it was NOICCEE. It was sweet enough to do without the syrup. The fried chicken had such a uniqueee flavor. It's not your typical fried chicken flavor! So meaty, tender and moist, and served at perfect temperature. Perfection.",5.0
Great food. The fried chicken was cooked to perfection and the biscuits are on point! Only thing they have to add to the menu is sausage gravy!,5.0
This restaurant by far is the best. There food is awesome but there service among some of there workers could be better. They should also inform people of there intermission and not turn you away from 3-5,4.0
Red Velvet waffles and fried chicken. The service is iffy but nothing to get bent out of shape about. Has a great vibe.,4.0
"Came here for my birthday over the weekend and i would def come back again. There was an enclosed outdoor space where i was seated, so you are able to enjoy the sun and yet be in an air conditioned space. The waitress we have was attentive and friendly. Decor wise was very modern and sleek, I wouldn't be expecting something like this for  southern comfort food. And this is what I ordered:1. buttermilk pancake with chicken.. which was a red velvet waffle with a well seasoned fried chicken. Walking in I saw most table have at least one plate of this. So i thought this is a must try dish, and it was delicious. The chicken was well seasoned and moist. The red velvet waffle was moist and soft. def recommend trying this at least. 2. Mac and Cheese- this can probably serve 3 people or even 4. My fiance and I could only eat half. It was very creamy and not as cheesy. I wouldn't say is the best mac and cheese I have tried. I have tasted worst and this one is I am not crazy for but it was decent.3. Along with the meal I ordered my self a red wine sangria, which was sweet and very refreshing. I would recommend getting this rather then their SoCo sangria where you can taste thyme in there.",4.0
"This was my first time here on May 22 and I was dying to come out here and taste their red velvet waffles and fried chicken. Once I arrived and saw the menu and what it had to offer (not overly impressed) I quickly changed my mind. Greeted by Sim (a nice man) he asked was it my first time here and what did I want to order First order of business is to always start off a meal with a good drink. So that means a SoCo Caramel Martini with a toasted marshallow for garnish. Not bad for the taste bud (was a little strong for me) but hey it filled my curiousity. As I began to Yelp in I saw where I could have a free drink with my entree and was informed by my lovely bartender (Brian) that I should off before I do anything else before my meal.I decided to do something different what caught my eyes right away were the F-Que wings which are smoked roasted wings tossed in Soco's housemade pepper jelly sauce and served with tzatzki dip. No complaints here and loved every minute of licking my fingers, making sounds, as I chomped on freshly made wings with just the right amount of heat and sweet to them. Finally, I made my decision to order the lobster, shrimp and grits entree. And my taste buds died and went to heaven. The grits mixed with white cheddar were just amazing and I ate those all up before I even touched the few shrimp and one lobster tail. While enjoying my food I was introduced to a 2012 South African rose glass of wine that hit the spot. It was so smooth that a second glass had to be done. As both the entree and glasses of wine were finished, I went for my free drink. Known as a the Mardi Gras/Tropical Punch (sorry cannot remember) it is a sweet drink with a mix of nutmeg and cinnamon. Not for everyone but it was a new taste I enjoyed.So what are my final thoughts of this place? Is it worth it? Well for me no I already had my fill but if you haven't tried their menu or went to enjoy the decor from time to time then just do so.What do I think is worth it? Just supporting two brothas doing their thing and in a positive aspect. The neighborhood is absolutely wonderful and if you want take a walk through Brooklyn old school and new take a quick hike up Myrtle Avenue and enjoy the sights and sounds",3.0
"I'm updating my review because I believe management got it right! The nasty floor manager has not been seen since my last review and since I'm a regular I think it's pretty safe to say they pulled her from the floor.. At least I hope they did :) Anyway, I couldn't go another day without updating because from the door man, the hostesses, the bar staff ladies and our favorite wait staff  (Torrie and Rob) they make our experience awesome every time we go.

"SoCo is the TRUTH.COMSeriously! I went on a Tuesday around 6:30PM, and it was fairly empty (at first).

I will never be returning to this restaurant because it's very over hyped and not worth it AT ALL! The service here is not good.

The only good thing about my experience here was they had a man playing a violin to popular songs and he was talented.

My favorites were the Mac & Cheese, Fried Chicken with Red Velvet Waffles, Lobster Shrimp Grits and Bread Pudding. The Mac & Cheese was well baked, not oily, and very cheesy. The Fried Chicken w/ Red Velvet Waffles stood out the most as it is unique and orgasmic! The chicken was crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. The Lobster Shrimp Grits was delicious as well. The shrimps and lobster meat were so tender & it went very well w/ the grits. The Bread Pudding (w/ a small scoop of vanilla ice cream) was yummy! It reminded me of a Cinnabon roll (but healthier & not overwhelming). hahaI had a great foodie experience here. I highly recommend SoCo!

"I've been here a few times.  I personally think its over rated. The atmosphere is cool. Nice vibes. Their drinks are good. I always get their ""red lemonade"" which is lemonade w/vodka and muddled cranberries.  The food I found to be bland. The first time I went I got the red velvet waffles with chicken (which is what everyone was raving about). They look pretty, but the waffles tasted like regular waffles with red food coloring. & they were super soft and chewy.  The fried chicken was super bland. No seasoning. The 2nd time I went I got their salmon.  That wasn't bad, but I've had better. I went a 3rd time but I had learned my lesson.  This time I just went for drinks. Overall Rating: B",3.0
"Loved the ambience!  Their tag line,  ""so jazzy,  so Brooklyn"" fits.  The atmosphere was swanky and the music was kicking.  I got their signature chicken and red velvet waffles.  It was underwhelming.  I didn't even finish the waffle.  But in their defense,  I currently live in the south and Chicken and Waffles is a staple here.  You're sure to find it on every menu.  So you'd really have to up your game to wow me.  Or I could just be over the phenomena... I also ordered the wings with a side of collards.  Which I'm glad I did.  They came I  handy when I was stuck overnight at the airport due to my flight being canceled.  The sauced wings were delightful and the greens were hearty,  flavorful,  not greasy and still had a bite to them.  I have respect for any food that tastes great eight hours after being served and cold.  So overall,  I'd go again. Would just have to try something other than what they're known for.",4.0

Then, we finally ended up at SoCo! Hallelujah!!The decor was very trendy, and soothing. The staff (especially our guy waiter) was extremely friendly and helpful. We ordered: 1) Mac & Cheese, 2) Cornbread, 3) Fried Chicken with Red Velvet Waffles, 4) Lobster Shrimp Grits, 5) Bread Pudding.The foods were exceptional and very delicious! My favorites were the Mac & Cheese, Fried Chicken with Red Velvet Waffles, Lobster Shrimp Grits and Bread Pudding. The Mac & Cheese was well baked, not oily, and very cheesy. The Fried Chicken w/ Red Velvet Waffles stood out the most as it is unique and orgasmic! The chicken was crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. The Lobster Shrimp Grits was delicious as well. The shrimps and lobster meat were so tender & it went very well w/ the grits. The Bread Pudding (w/ a small scoop of vanilla ice cream) was yummy! It reminded me of a Cinnabon roll (but healthier & not overwhelming). hahaI had a great foodie experience here. I highly recommend SoCo! Checked-in and received 10% off our bill which was awesome! :)",5.0
"I've been here a few times.  I personally think its over rated. The atmosphere is cool. Nice vibes. Their drinks are good. I always get their ""red lemonade"" which is lemonade w/vodka and muddled cranberries.  The food I found to be bland. The first time I went I got the red velvet waffles with chicken (which is what everyone was raving about). They look pretty, but the waffles tasted like regular waffles with red food coloring. & they were super soft and chewy.  The fried chicken was super bland. No seasoning. The 2nd time I went I got their salmon.  That wasn't bad, but I've had better. I went a 3rd time but I had learned my lesson.  This time I just went for drinks. Overall Rating: B",3.0
"Loved the ambience!  Their tag line,  ""so jazzy,  so Brooklyn"" fits.  The atmosphere was swanky and the music was kicking.  I got their signature chicken and red velvet waffles.  It was underwhelming.  I didn't even finish the waffle.  But in their defense,  I currently live in the south and Chicken and Waffles is a staple here.  You're sure to find it on every menu.  So you'd really have to up your game to wow me.  Or I could just be over the phenomena... I also ordered the wings with a side of collards.  Which I'm glad I did.  They came I  handy when I was stuck overnight at the airport due to my flight being canceled.  The sauced wings were delightful and the greens were hearty,  flavorful,  not greasy and still had a bite to them.  I have respect for any food that tastes great eight hours after being served and cold.  So overall,  I'd go again. Would just have to try something other than what they're known for.",4.0
"Came here with a friend and he said it was classy. Was puzzled until I saw a violin player at the bar! Super cool, music was great. We checked in and had the free corn bread. Soft and fluffy. The pickled oysters were soft and tender and went well with the bed of pickled veggies. The chicken and waffles were one of the best I had. Service was attentive and my water glass was always filled. Highly recommend this joint.",4.0

"I was a little skeptical when I walked into the restaurant considering I was expecting more of a southern vibe but instead it was more of a modern and lounge like atmosphere. I came with a party of 6 and they accommodated us nicely and even moved us when we didn't want to sit by the door.Damn. The Chicken and Red Velvet Waffles were on point. One of the best chicken and waffle dishes I've had. and it wasn't even my dish, although I kept eating off my bf's plate. The mac and cheese was also really good too. I got the blackened salmon which was okay not terrible but I wouldn't recommend it over the chicken and waffles.

"I love this place! I have taken different people to it over the past year and not one of them has had a complaint yet! I can really only vouch for the fried chicken and red velvet waffles for myself because its my favorite and I order it every time! The waffles are so moist that the syrup is not even necessary. And I can't leave without my Mac and  cheese. It's a very large portion, so much so that if you don't share with the table you will have more than enough to take home. We also had the F-Que wings for an appetizer and they are excellent as well. Other dishes popular with my friends were the Lobster, Shrimp & Grits and Blackened Salmon. So far the only thing that I tried that I was not impressed with was the cornbread. It was a little too dry and bland for my taste. Other than that I can guarantee you will love the food. The atmosphere is great and they have a fantastic enclosed atrium in the rear that's very nice in the evenings. Can't go wrong if you choose Soco!",5.0

"Hello Soco.  I love you as do my friends.  Came here for my birthday with 6 friends.  I made reservations by phone a few days in advance and Soco called the afternoon of to make sure my party was still arriving at the designated time.  Got there at 8PM on a Friday night.  The dining and bar area weren't too crowded and plenty of street parking was available at that time.  My party was seated immediately, which was greatly appreciated since we all starved ourselves during the day.  We wanted to enjoy Soco in all its glory!For apps - Nola's steamed mussels - This was beyond delicious.  Buttery and garlicky broth with chicken andouile.  It was served with a small piece of garlic bread, which was not enough to soak up the broth.  We wanted to drink it like soup (we didn't).  Extra bread was ordered for $1.Fried pickled oysters - Oysters were breaded and fried perfectly.  I've had fried oysters at other establishments, but Soco's were definitely the best.  A little on the pricey side though - $12 for 6.   It wasn't fried to death so you could still tell you were eating an oyster.  The pickled pineapple salsa was a nice addition.  Almost like a palate cleanser.  Also probably the only veg/fruit combo that didn't contain butter.F-Que Wings - These didn't stand out too much.  They reminded me of normal sauced up BBQ wings.  A bit expensive too.For entrees - Red velvet waffles with fried chicken - Oh my...get in my belly.  I had to steal these off of my friend's plate. Everyone raves about this dish and now I know why.  Sweet and salty with just the right amount of crunch on the chicken.  The dish itself is actually pretty big.  Even after pawning off half my friend wasn't able to finish entire entree.Pecan crusted pork chop - Stole this off of another friend's plate.  This actually comes with 2 large pork chops.  It was like Christmas morning when we revealed the bottom chop.  This was my first time having pecan crusted pork and I would gladly eat it again.  It was so flavorful, juicy and tender.  It comes with citrus smashed sweet potatoes.  I didn't taste any citrus in it.  I do know that it was delicious as well.Lobster, shrimp and grits - My own dish.  This included half a lobster tail and 4 decently sized shrimp.  I had to pawn off a portion of this as it was just way too much food for me to finish in one sitting. Super rich and creamy grits in a tomato broth.  So good!I didn't try any of the other entrees on the table but I didn't hear complaints - B54 burger, steak frites, and herb marinated skirt steak.  Just moans of satisfaction and way too tight pants.For sides - MAC AND CHEESE - I'm a huge, huge, HUGE mac and cheese fan.  Soco got it right.  The table ordered 2 dishes, which are huge, but only finished just over 1 dish.  If ya love mac n' cheese you'll love Soco's.Okra and tomatoes - Okra is a tricky vegetable.  If you've ever cooked them up yourself. then you know they get this weird, slimy texture if not cooked properly.  Soco makes them perfect.Sauteed collard greensGarlic string beans - Not enough garlic!No room for dessert =[All in all a very tasty night at Soco. Will definitely be back in the future with looser fitting pants.",5.0

"So my mom has been ""experimenting"" and eating out of her ""comfort"" zone. She usually eats at BBQ's or Applebees, but I told her this is NYC, eat at real restaurants or I'm not eating with her at all. This, SoCo, was the 2nd restaurant she wanted to try.  I've believe I've eaten here before, but couldn't remember the experience, so I told her lets meet after work. Southern food? I'm all in, but I was sourly disappointed. My mom ended up spending (her treat) $140 on a meal, that was barely finished by the three of us (her friend joined us as well). While the atmosphere was cool, very hip, adult, ""I'm on my grown isn"" vibe, the food was lackluster.  We started out with shrimp rolls, that were like egg rolls split in half. Those were okay, but oily. One thing I HATE when ordering at restaurants is the inability to substitute sides.  I wanted chicken and waffles, but they only had red velvet chicken and waffles (thumbs down #1) they then offered me the chicken with mashed potatoes and collard greens, ""I don't like collard greens, could I get something else instead?"" No (thumbs down#2). So I got that collard greens and told my mom I would give it to her. I ate my chicken, but barely finished it, was super, SUPER dry. No bueno. I had to ask for sauce on the side in order to eat the little bit I picked on while my mom's friend talked. The only thing I genuinely liked was the macaroni. That was fresh, and worthy of it's $10 price tag. Kudos on the mac and cheese. My mom got the jambalaya. Here's my thing, we asked the waitress if it was spicy (my mom can't eat spicy food), she said it wasn't that spicy. My mom ordered it, took three bites, and couldn't eat anymore. It sat on her table until the waitress asked if we wanted to wrap it up. My mom said fine. I informed the waitress the jambalya was too spicy. She didn't hesitate to direct my mother to order another meal. Why not take back the jambalaya? Now there will be four meals on this table! But I digress. My mom didn't finish the jambalaya, and ordered the pork chops. She said those were ""ok"". So, nothing to write home about huh.... Whatevs!After all was said and done, I probably won't hit up this spot again. The atmosphere was everything, but I couldn't get with the food, and like I stated before, it really URKES me when I can't substitute side dishes on an entree...***Little tip, when you check in via Yelp to this restaurant, you get a free order of cornbread.

"We went here over the past weekend. We got there and there was a 30 minute wait so we tried some of the cocktails at the bar.

I would definitely recommend the entree! We also shared the shrimp lobster and grits - definitely top notch! Of course the HUGE side order of mac & cheese, also great though would be better if they put bacon bits in it, just saying.. Service was great! Drinks Great! Food amazing! Overall a great experience.

"I live across the street from SoCo, so I've been there quite a few times and tried different things.  I will say that almost everything I've tried is delicious:1) The red velvet waffles are really good- crispy outside and fluffy inside. I don't even bother to eat mine with the syrup, that's how good they are.2) That said, I don't really think they pair all that well with the chicken, which itself is decent- not the best fried chicken I've ever had, but it's pretty good.3) Cornbread is good, and they give you a generous portion (3 pieces).4) Their cocktails are creative and delicious.5) The SoJazzy salad is excellent, particularly with shrimp.6) The F-Que wings... lord.  I salivate just thinking about them.  So good.7) The short ribs are spectacular.8) The mac and cheese is absolutely the best I've ever had, hands down.  Garlicky, cheesy heaven in a pan... just really effing good.9) Great ambience.That said, they could improve:1) The lobster and shrimp grits- I found the grits utterly tasteless.  It was disappointing.2) The salmon is very boring, just okay. I guess salmon is a boring dish in general, but I've had it done really well at other places.3) The greens really could be better.4) Quite expensive- cocktails are $14, and the food even higher, for the most part.  The shrimp addition to the SoJazzy is $8 for 4 prawns. If you order those same 4 prawns by themselves- like I did for my 3-year-old son one evening- expect to pay $12.  For the exact same portion.5) On the weekends, you're stuck with the brunch menu until 6pm when they open the kitchen back up for dinner.  Meaning no SoJazzy salads until dinner :-(All in all, I feel like they do a good job, for the most part. Do I think it's worth the 30-60 minute wait I often see hordes of people doing outside in the cold on a Sunday? No.  But it's good enough for me to continue going back.",4.0

"I was at SOCO for brunch on September 28th. Our waiter was very good - very attentive and provided great service. Our food was good, with the exception of the citrus mashed sweet potatoes - they have a very funky taste.  This was my third visit to SOCO and I really want to like it, but the pretentiousness of it prevents me from doing so. Why do restaurants refuse to seat you unless everyone from your party is there? The majority of our party was there, but I had to plead my case as if I was in front of Judge Judy for us to be seated. Two people were running late (20 mins), but called us with their order, so we were placing orders for everyone. I find this issue in Brooklyn more than I do in Manhattan. I'm going to SOCO this weekend for a birthday dinner for someone very dear to me, so hopefully it will be a better experience, but we're already off to a bad start. Because of the number of people in our party, our selection is limited to a few items(those funky citrus mashed sweet potatoes are included).",3.0
"3.25 Stars.  I have mixed feelings about SoCo. Entrees ranged from Good to Excellent.  Nearly a half hour wait even with a reservation.My friend and I went on a Saturday night.  We made reservations for 10pm, just on a whim and thank goodness we did.  It was packed. It wasn't the atmosphere I was expecting by any measure, not necessarily a bad thing.  It reminded me of a Brooklyn version of Tilman's in Manhattan or Ricardo's Steakhouse in East Harlem. A DJ was spinning 90s and early 00s R&B.  The entire restaurant was very loud and lively.  The bar area takes up about 1/3 of the restaurant, with the seating in the rear.So, as I mentioned we made a reservation.  When we arrived, the waitress said the wait was approximately 15 minutes as they waited for parties to leave.  This is a major pet peeve of mine -- you should be able to properly manage parties and reservations to allow you avoid this issue.  There were several other parties waiting.  We were seated in approximately 25 minutes.In true form, my friend and I attacked the menu.  We ordered the Mussells, Shrimp Gumbo, Mac & Cheese, Corn Bread, Blackened Salmon and the Fried Chicken with Red Velvet Waffle.  The Mussells were good, not great.  They were swimming in a cream habanero sauce, which in my opinion didn't have enough of the habanero kick.  There were also bits of chirozo mixed throughout.  A solid dish.  Next, the Shrimp Gumbo was very flavorful and mildly spicy.  I really enjoyed the blend of flavors -- a thick broth with vegetables, shrimp, sausage and white rice.  I will definitely have this on my next trip.  My friend had the Blackened Salmon.  It was okay -- I have a deep and profound hatred for salmon (mainly because it's such a default and typically uninteresting), so my opinion does not likely reflect the opinion of most. I had the Fried Chicken with the Red Velvet Waffle.  Okay, so this was freaking amazing.  The chicken was mmmmmmmm good.  The batter was nice and light, but very flavorful.  The chicken was well cooked and moist.  The red velvet waffle was very rich and also very moist.  It was hearty without feeling heavy.  The Mac & Cheese -- I'm guessing it's made with guoda because it had a slightly smoky flavor.  But it's very creamy -- not the type of texture that I usually enjoye.  I tried to eat more of the crunchy outer portion, but overall the flavor partly made up for the texture.  The cornbread was flavorless and on the dry side.  Less than a mile from my apartment, a good vibe and great food.  I'll return to try out more of their cocktails and food entrees.",3.0
"This is my millionth time here.  I was lucky to crave salmon when I was preggo so SoCo was one of my lifelines when I couldn't cook.  Took my granny for lunch today.   She's a Bajan living in Georgia.  She KNOWS food.  Granny nodded and smiled and said ""It was good"", when the waiter inquired about the food.  OOOh but if you knew my Granny you'd know that small gesture really is a medal of honour for this establishment.  When the waiter thought she was finished with her shrimp salad and she smacked his hand....ever so gently, I think I knew I chose the right establishment.  We both had the blackened salmon which is always a winner.  SoCo wins in service, atmosphere, and most importantly food!",5.0
"Oh God. So good. Had the chicken and red velvet waffles. Chicken is great. Nicely seasoned and cripsy. Red velvet waffles were nice and fluffy. Mac and cheese is great to share for the table.

Food is pretty good they are well known for their chicken and red velvet waffles. Anything on the menu is pretty good but this restaurant can get packed.

"Decided to stop in for dinner with my girlfriend. Food was okay, décor was nice and service was great. Our server made sure to give us suggestion and all available options. One star for service :). The décor was nice and clean which lead to a very relaxed feel while enjoying ones meal. One star for the décor :). The food however was JUST OKAY. Literally just okay. Some dishes were not quite what one would expect but everyone is so focused on having this experience that left something to be desired. Me and my girlfriend had multiple dishes- the shrimp rolls, the corn bread, the mac and cheese, the chicken and waffles and the lobster shrimp and grits. The shrimp rolls, served with chopsticks :), were delicious; the flavors were there. However they should be named rolls with shrimp because although you can see the little piece of shrimp tucked into the roll it is merely half a bite which is disappointing. The cornbread was just okay, if that. Not something I would ever hope to eat again, overly sweetened and very dry. VERY DRY. Disappointing because I really do love cornbread. The Mac and cheese was presented nicely and came out piping hot. It was okay and the presentation is what had drawn us to it, the flavor, which is lacking, is what pushed me away. The fried chicken and waffles. SADLY THIS WAS MY DISH :(. The fried chicken was good and had, not loads of flavor, but depth of flavor and was cooked perfectly; commendable especially when one receives a mix of white and dark meat. It paired nicely with the syrup. THE RED VELVET WAFFLE HOWEVER..SHEESH! THERE WASN'T ENOUGH OF ANYTHING THAT COULD REVERSE THE FACT THAT I HAD BITTEN INTO IT. FLAVOR WISE, THEY COULD HAVE SOAKED IT IN POWERED SURGAR AND IT STILL COULD MASK THE DOUGHY, BLAND WAFFLE THAT WENT WELL WITH NOTHING, INCLUDING THE SYRUP. I suggest the restaurant allows its guest to have friend chicken with other sides or seriously fix the big chunk of dough they land on the plate to soak up the oil of the chicken. The waffle worked and tasted like a paper towel. May I have my money back for just the waffle please!. Lastly the lobster shrimp and grits, DELICIOUS. I would come here just for this dish alone. Seriously it is a must have!",3.0

"Every time I dine here, I tell myself I'm NOT coming back--me and my friends. The food isn't the issue.

I haven't dined here in months because I'm always disappointed in the service. I've been to SOCO when the restaurant was empty and the service still sucked.

All HYPE the red velvet waffle and chicken are HORRIBLE. I don't know who is frying it but they neeed to get someones grandma to show them how to season chicken. The flavors was lacking.  The presentation gets a ten though it did look pretty.,2.0

"I was at SOCO for brunch on September 28th. Our waiter was very good - very attentive and provided great service. Our food was good, with the exception of the citrus mashed sweet potatoes - they have a very funky taste.  This was my third visit to SOCO and I really want to like it, but the pretentiousness of it prevents me from doing so. Why do restaurants refuse to seat you unless everyone from your party is there? The majority of our party was there, but I had to plead my case as if I was in front of Judge Judy for us to be seated. Two people were running late (20 mins), but called us with their order, so we were placing orders for everyone. I find this issue in Brooklyn more than I do in Manhattan. I'm going to SOCO this weekend for a birthday dinner for someone very dear to me, so hopefully it will be a better experience, but we're already off to a bad start. Because of the number of people in our party, our selection is limited to a few items(those funky citrus mashed sweet potatoes are included).",3.0
"3.25 Stars.  I have mixed feelings about SoCo. Entrees ranged from Good to Excellent.  Nearly a half hour wait even with a reservation.My friend and I went on a Saturday night.  We made reservations for 10pm, just on a whim and thank goodness we did.  It was packed. It wasn't the atmosphere I was expecting by any measure, not necessarily a bad thing.  It reminded me of a Brooklyn version of Tilman's in Manhattan or Ricardo's Steakhouse in East Harlem. A DJ was spinning 90s and early 00s R&B.  The entire restaurant was very loud and lively.  The bar area takes up about 1/3 of the restaurant, with the seating in the rear.So, as I mentioned we made a reservation.  When we arrived, the waitress said the wait was approximately 15 minutes as they waited for parties to leave.  This is a major pet peeve of mine -- you should be able to properly manage parties and reservations to allow you avoid this issue.  There were several other parties waiting.  We were seated in approximately 25 minutes.In true form, my friend and I attacked the menu.  We ordered the Mussells, Shrimp Gumbo, Mac & Cheese, Corn Bread, Blackened Salmon and the Fried Chicken with Red Velvet Waffle.  The Mussells were good, not great.  They were swimming in a cream habanero sauce, which in my opinion didn't have enough of the habanero kick.  There were also bits of chirozo mixed throughout.  A solid dish.  Next, the Shrimp Gumbo was very flavorful and mildly spicy.  I really enjoyed the blend of flavors -- a thick broth with vegetables, shrimp, sausage and white rice.  I will definitely have this on my next trip.  My friend had the Blackened Salmon.  It was okay -- I have a deep and profound hatred for salmon (mainly because it's such a default and typically uninteresting), so my opinion does not likely reflect the opinion of most. I had the Fried Chicken with the Red Velvet Waffle.  Okay, so this was freaking amazing.  The chicken was mmmmmmmm good.  The batter was nice and light, but very flavorful.  The chicken was well cooked and moist.  The red velvet waffle was very rich and also very moist.  It was hearty without feeling heavy.  The Mac & Cheese -- I'm guessing it's made with guoda because it had a slightly smoky flavor.  But it's very creamy -- not the type of texture that I usually enjoye.  I tried to eat more of the crunchy outer portion, but overall the flavor partly made up for the texture.  The cornbread was flavorless and on the dry side.  Less than a mile from my apartment, a good vibe and great food.  I'll return to try out more of their cocktails and food entrees.",3.0
"This is my millionth time here.  I was lucky to crave salmon when I was preggo so SoCo was one of my lifelines when I couldn't cook.  Took my granny for lunch today.   She's a Bajan living in Georgia.  She KNOWS food.  Granny nodded and smiled and said ""It was good"", when the waiter inquired about the food.  OOOh but if you knew my Granny you'd know that small gesture really is a medal of honour for this establishment.  When the waiter thought she was finished with her shrimp salad and she smacked his hand....ever so gently, I think I knew I chose the right establishment.  We both had the blackened salmon which is always a winner.  SoCo wins in service, atmosphere, and most importantly food!",5.0
"Oh God. So good. Had the chicken and red velvet waffles. Chicken is great. Nicely seasoned and cripsy. Red velvet waffles were nice and fluffy. Mac and cheese is great to share for the table. Lobster grits were good but small in portion. Full bar, nice ambiance and good service.(Side note: Don't be alarmed the next day if your poop is red. It's from the red velvet waffles.)",4.0
Food is pretty good they are well known for their chicken and red velvet waffles. Anything on the menu is pretty good but this restaurant can get packed. Definitely a nice brunch spot but this best time to go is during the middle of the week during the middle of the day less crowds and wait times. Definitely check them out,4.0
"Decided to stop in for dinner with my girlfriend. Food was okay, décor was nice and service was great. Our server made sure to give us suggestion and all available options. One star for service :). The décor was nice and clean which lead to a very relaxed feel while enjoying ones meal. One star for the décor :). The food however was JUST OKAY. Literally just okay. Some dishes were not quite what one would expect but everyone is so focused on having this experience that left something to be desired. Me and my girlfriend had multiple dishes- the shrimp rolls, the corn bread, the mac and cheese, the chicken and waffles and the lobster shrimp and grits. The shrimp rolls, served with chopsticks :), were delicious; the flavors were there. However they should be named rolls with shrimp because although you can see the little piece of shrimp tucked into the roll it is merely half a bite which is disappointing. The cornbread was just okay, if that. Not something I would ever hope to eat again, overly sweetened and very dry. VERY DRY. Disappointing because I really do love cornbread. The Mac and cheese was presented nicely and came out piping hot. It was okay and the presentation is what had drawn us to it, the flavor, which is lacking, is what pushed me away. The fried chicken and waffles. SADLY THIS WAS MY DISH :(. The fried chicken was good and had, not loads of flavor, but depth of flavor and was cooked perfectly; commendable especially when one receives a mix of white and dark meat. It paired nicely with the syrup. THE RED VELVET WAFFLE HOWEVER..SHEESH! THERE WASN'T ENOUGH OF ANYTHING THAT COULD REVERSE THE FACT THAT I HAD BITTEN INTO IT. FLAVOR WISE, THEY COULD HAVE SOAKED IT IN POWERED SURGAR AND IT STILL COULD MASK THE DOUGHY, BLAND WAFFLE THAT WENT WELL WITH NOTHING, INCLUDING THE SYRUP. I suggest the restaurant allows its guest to have friend chicken with other sides or seriously fix the big chunk of dough they land on the plate to soak up the oil of the chicken. The waffle worked and tasted like a paper towel. May I have my money back for just the waffle please!. Lastly the lobster shrimp and grits, DELICIOUS. I would come here just for this dish alone. Seriously it is a must have!",3.0

"Peter Best, Malissa Browne and Slim Walker are a force to be reckoned with when it comes to serving up some of the most mouth-watering Southern Fusion cuisine in Brooklyn. Half restaurant, half cocktail bar, SoCo has been described as ""the Brooklyn Bridge turned into a restaurant.""

The atmosphere is relaxing yet chic and the menu is so creative and unique that it's hard not to order one of everything. SoCo describes their menu style as ""a mixture of cajun/creole, barbecue and soul food dreamt up with everything else you can imagine.""While keeping true to roots of Southern food, one of their most popular menu items is the Buttermilk Fried Chicken.

When it came in front of me, I honestly was not impressed with the presentation. It almost looked like a dish anyone could of served at home. It smelled good though. As for taste, it was really good. Short ribs sliced like butter. Garlic mashed potatoes were a delicious pillowy mound. And the broccoli was cooked perfectly. (At least to my liking)All in all, I felt the restaurant was good.

Which is a good tip, because last time we came on a Saturday, it was a long wait for a party of three. Especially if you're really hungry. I ordered the molasses braised short ribs. When it came in front of me, I honestly was not impressed with the presentation. It almost looked like a dish anyone could of served at home. It smelled good though. As for taste, it was really good. Short ribs sliced like butter. Garlic mashed potatoes were a delicious pillowy mound. And the broccoli was cooked perfectly. (At least to my liking)All in all, I felt the restaurant was good. Only complaint would be food and drink presentation. Then I'd feel like it was really worth the money.",3.0
"This was my second time here. First time last summer was over brunch to try the famed Red Velvet Chicken and Waffles, and I loved it. Had it at the bar for brunch with  a few drinks, it was really good.Second time was last night, and we went for a full on dinner to see how the rest of the menu was. Of course we ordered the fried chicken and waffles again, but everything else on the menu looked really good so we went for it.There was the Short Rib Pizza and that was f'n AMAAAAAZING! ate that thing like a taco...the meat was well cooked and flavorful. Would def get that again.First thing that caught my eye was the Whole Fried Branzino fish stuffed with wild rice...fuuuuck that was some good stuff!My friend got the Pork Chop entree and that was one of the best Pork Chops I've had of recent memory....very tender, not so oily, and that pecan crust topped it off in the taste dept.I've never really had grits growing up, but had the white cheddar grits and it was a great side while munching on everything else....also with corn bread.And my cocktail drink of Mango Puree with WHISKEY (favorite) and mulled strawberries in the weird shaped hipster jar was great! I shoulda got two of those.After the first time going here, I didn't hesitate to go again. I'll be back for more.",5.0
"Went on a Sunday.  Gave my number and waited about 25 minutes for text that our table was available.  Ordered the chicken n waffle, Mac n cheese, chicken sandwich and of course got some free cornbread.  The cornbread was yummy, chicken amazing, waffle was okay.  Mac n cheese, oh mama .  Our waiter ""John"" was very attentive and took good care of us.  I will be coming back!!!",4.0
"Came here for a friends birthday. I got the Mac and cheese everyone raves about, it was good but it didn't make me want to dance. One of the girls wanted the waffle without the chicken, the waiter told her that wasn't possible because they come together. I thought this was ridiculous being that the chicken sits on top of the waffle as it's own separate entity. We missed ordering brunch by just a few minutes and the waiter received a sixty buck tip for doing relatively nothing. The place has a nice decor and I would come back, to dry the chicken and waffles...together of course.",2.0
This spot had been bookmarked for months and I was excited about trying the food after reading all the rave reviews. I ordered the chicken and waffles that were really good. I also ordered a side of the $9 mac and cheese based on the rave reviews from yelp and was greatly disappointed. The mac and cheese was truly a let down and waste of money.  The ambience of the restaurant is cool and the staff were friendly. Prices were affordable and I would return and wont touch that mac n cheese.,3.0
"Awesome soul food in the heart of Brooklyn. Fried chicken and red velvet waffle and the mac n cheese are definitely things you MUST have when there. The chicken was nice and juicy, and the waffle - wow, delicious, chewy yet fluffy. Bloody mary was pretty spiked as well which is always a nice surprise. Generous portions for a not-so-cheap price makes it a great occasional brunch place. Get there early or make a reservation! But make sure all your party is there bc you can't sit until that happens. Long lines otherwise!",4.0

Well, let me say, my brunch experience was totally different from my dinner experience. I really enjoyed it. I had some type of eggs benedict with a crab and fish cake. It was delicious.

I ordered the famous red velvet chicken and waffle dish.  The real appeal for me was the red velvet waffle and while it was good, it was nothing to run to yelp about, so that I could write a review and give it 5 stars.  I know there are other chicken and waffle dishes in the city that do make you do just that.  My caramel martini drink was watered down and the service was meh.

We also had mac & cheese, creole gumbo and their dirty rice. The mac & cheese was bomb.com! I would totally come here again just for that! The creole gumbo was okay, edible but not something I would get again. As for their dirty rice, don't even waste your money on this. It was so bland.

A lot of ppl talk about the red velvet waffles or the Mac and cheese but that's because they haven't had the shrimp and grits!! They stand out most for me! They are creole/ southern/ soul food at its best! The grits are moist and the shrimp are juicy and really seasoned well!,5.0
OMG! the food was satisfiying in every way. We split the short ribs/mash/broc and mac in cheese and cornbread. Everything was amazing and they gave lots of gravy. The mac is huge to share.

Ohh very nice decor/ambiance too.,5.0
"Finally went to this place after seeing all these wonderful Instagram photos of their mac and cheese along with red velvet waffles with buttermilk fried chicken. Service is very good, there was a person to open the door for you and we were seated right away. Atmosphere was very relaxed, but I would have liked maybe a little more lighting in the dining area. Water service was quite efficient, never an empty glass of water.Food came out in a pretty quick. I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken and red velvet waffle. Presentation and the way it looked blew me away, but the taste did not do the same. The chicken was nothing special, I had popeye chicken that was more flavorful and juicy. There was also nothing very special of the waffle too. Tasted like a regular waffle with a hint of red velvet, nothing special. Price came out to 26 including tip and tax which is pretty expensive for a waffle and three pieces of fried chicken. If it was up to me I would have much rather went to dinner for waffles and then went to popeyes for a 4 piece chicken and still spend less than 26 dollars.Would i go again? Sure, but only on special occasions, absolutely not a place to go to every day or very often.",3.0
"I don't care what anyone says this place is wack!!!!! Let me start off by saying I had a reservation!!!! I have been trying to get to this place for the past year and I think there was a reason why I wasn't ""destined"" to eat at such a crappy establishment. Got there at 10 pm on a Saturday night and I expected  it to be crowded. I went over to tell the hostess that I had a reservation, he told me to hold tight for a few minutes and he would seat us. I waited in the bar area so he would see me. He made eye contact with me a couple of times so I know he saw me. My friend and I waited until 10:30 and he went up to the same guy and was like hey man what about us? Mind you a group of five people came in way after us without reservations and they were seated immediately. I wonder was it because he knew the people in said party?He then tells us that he in fact did forget about us! Wow! Really?!! Anyway I was so annoyed by all of this by the time we sat down. Then our waiter took a long time to even acknowledge us because he was running his mouth to another co-worker. He finally came with the bottle of tap water that is placed at each table. I was ready to order the braised short beef ribs and then he tells me that they just ran out of the ribs!! Are you kidding me?!!! Maybe if they sat us down at our table right away, they might not have run out of ribs. I told my friend it wasn't meant for me to eat here and the waiter suggested the steak. Ummm no I came here for ribs, I don't want any dang steak!  We ran out of there so fast! I will never ever patronize this business ever in life. It's like every time I go to a black owned restaurant (not all but many) the service is crappy. We had a nice rental car and took our business up to harlem and enjoyed some real soul food at Amy Ruth's where the prices were better and service was decent as they greeted us at the front door.

I stopped in for lunch by chance and had an amazing taste experience! Caesar Salad with steak that was cooked to perfection! Grits with cheese (oh. My. God.) and fresh watermelon lemonade.

It was relaxing and simply a great splurge on a June day in Brooklyn! How Myrtle Avenue has changed! I would definitely go back! Be prepared for excellent service and most excellent food! A bit on the pricey side....I don't usually spend 38$ with a tip for lunch. But it was just that kind of day and just that good! I would do it again in a heartbeat! No question! Perhaps I should scale back my order if I'm on a budget! Looking forward to the Mac n cheese!,5.0

Of course, that's my cue to say, ""What's the third dessert you mentioned, again?"" ;-)My friend had the blackened salmon, and I had the jambalaya. For drinks, I sipped on a Mexican Mule--gotta love that tequila! We did, however, have to wait a ridiculously long time for our dessert.  But a manager did pop by our table to apologize for the wait (about 30 minutes).  On a good note, our molten brownie with ice cream was sinfully scrumptious, and when we got our bill we noticed dessert was on *them*--cool!All in all it, I would go back to SoCo to hang out when I'm looking for a high-energy and fun environment to enjoy some tasty grub...and more tequila.",3.0

Of course, that's my cue to say, ""What's the third dessert you mentioned, again?"" ;-)My friend had the blackened salmon, and I had the jambalaya. For drinks, I sipped on a Mexican Mule--gotta love that tequila! We did, however, have to wait a ridiculously long time for our dessert.  But a manager did pop by our table to apologize for the wait (about 30 minutes).  On a good note, our molten brownie with ice cream was sinfully scrumptious, and when we got our bill we noticed dessert was on *them*--cool!All in all it, I would go back to SoCo to hang out when I'm looking for a high-energy and fun environment to enjoy some tasty grub...and more tequila.",3.0
"It took me a few tries to actually enjoy the food here.  So now when I come here I just stick to what I like which is the chicken and red velvet waffles. I didn't like the barbecue chicken at all. Didn't care for the corn bread either.  The shrimp/ lobster and grits looked soupy which threw me off O_oAs for the staff, everyone including the bartender were so nice and accommodating. Will I return, yes soon for the chicken and waffles only :o)",3.0

"It's so sad to see what bad Service can do to a business.After taking in Kevin Hart and the gang of Think Like A Man Too on 6/21/14, myself and group of 5 ventured to Soco for dinner and drinks. Through opentable I had made a 10pm reservation,  however the movie ran later and we arrived about 11pm.Upon arrival I ventured to the hostess stand to ask about the wait time for a group our size, I was told 30-45 mins, which is very reasonable on a Saturday night. While waiting on the others to come inside I noticed a large group leaving from a table in the front area of the bar. It still took them 35 minutes to seat us at that very table that stood empty while we ordered drinks at the bar.While we were being seated our table was now being prepared with glasses and utensils... No Menus, abt 5 minutes of waiting and we then asked if we could get menus for our table. A young lady brought them over, informing us that water will soon arrive. That took another 10 mins, our server later arrived to ask if we wanted to place drink orders. We told him we were ready to order our entire meal: drinks, appetizers,  and entrées. He then hastily went around the table to take our order, as though our table was an inconvenience at the time.Appetizers came out at 12:15am, followed by entrées about 12:35am. After being seated, it should not take 1 hour to be served a meal. The security at the door became our go to person,  given his proximity to our table, and us having to frequently ask him to get someone. During the long waits for meals neither the server or hostess came over to explain/apologize for our wait.The icing on top of this mess came when we inquired with the security about the manager, and he pointed to the gentleman at the hostess booth as being him. Given the fact that their booth is a raised platform, there was no way that he could have missed the lack of service being offered to our table.The only reason we did not leave during our many wait periods, was the fact that at that late hour of the evening it would have been difficult to drive and park 3 cars, and be seated for dinner. We reserted to making jokes about a chinese takeout restaurant we had passed a few blocks up myrtle ave.Side note (my dinner was great), it was my 3rd time eating here, for 2 of my friends travelling from NJ to spend the night out in Brooklyn... they would not be returning! !",1.0

I dropped a star after going back a second time. This time I ordered the gumbo and the buttermilk chicken and red velvet waffles. I was terribly disappointed with what they passed off as gumbo and had the nerve to sell it for $9 a bowl. The key to gumbo is the roux. That was not a roux.  They should rename their dish as seafood stew or something to that effect. It was not a gumbo. The waffles were truly a disappointment. The waffles they made at Society Cafe in Harlem have me spoiled for life. They are crispy on the outside and soft and flavorful on the inside. These waffles were not crispy on the outside and lacked flavor. They had a ton of red food coloring instead of cocoa which give true red velvet its color. The chicken was OK. The portion size was huge and I took the chicken home with me. I will wait a while before trying SoCo again.,3.0

"".  What? Is this an old time movie theater?  They could've mentioned that over the phone.  Anyway, I smile and say okay and we take a seat a few feet away from the maitre d's podium.Around 6pm, about 20+ people have arrived and congregating around the door.  They then start seating people.  Nobody calls me, so I approach Mr funky haircut ""Are you seating people?""""Yes""""Okay, we've been here since 5""He asks for my name, looks at his book and says in a condescending tone""You never checked in""Now, I don't know what constitutes ""check in"" but I know we made ourselves known when we walked in.  When his partner returned to the podium, he had a slight case of amnesia and also asked for my name.  They mumbled something to each other and then proceeded to have someone seat us.  No apology for the wait and no apology for the mistake one of them made regarding check in.I spoke to them in a reasonable tone.  I expect the same back. They are a business after all.  But that wasn't to be.  I won't be planning anymore group events at Soco.  There's other places in BK with good food and of similar size with better attitude at the door.",3.0

"So(Co) yummy! I enjoyed an awesome girls' brunch at SoCo on Saturday, August 31. Service - We had to change up our reservation size a few times (yes! they take reservations for brunch), but the restaurant staff was totally patient. We went from a group of 7 to a group of 4 and received an outside table (glass covered/climate-controlled!). The table service was prompt, helpful, and attentive.Food - Three of us (including myself) went for the cheese grits and  chicken Andouille sausage and I all I can say is yum. The grits were creamy and very cheesy. The sausage had just the right amount of spice.  There was a perfectly cooked fried egg thrown in for good measure and it was all done in a tasty lobster broth. The fourth in the party went for the Bourbon St. Eggs Benedict and I had a taste. Another winner. The table also shared the sweet potato pancakes entree as an appetizer. I highly recommend doing this so that everyone is a group gets a taste. The sweet potato flavor was present and delightful, not overwhelming.Ambiance - The vibe was laid back yet upscale.

"Am I a fan? Absolutely!I've been to SoCo twice, and this is my new go-to brunch spot when I'm craving Southern food. I've tried to go to hipster Creole spots (I'm talking to you, Catfish), but they're very light versions of the cuisine. Either they don't have enough spice, seasoning, or try to get away with half ass-ing the staple dishes by not using all the flavorful ingredients. SoCo doesn't do any of this.On my first visit, I came alone and ready to binge! I had the caramel martini (delish, & I don't even like marshmallows), the pickled oysters (failed attempt to fuse escovitch technique w/ Southern ingredients), and molasses/ ginger glazed short ribs. (hot damn, if you don't order this you've already made a big mistake!) Those ribs were falling apart tender, yet firm and I licked my fingers HAM to get every drop of that sauce in my belly. 2nd visit consisted of inviting a friend to my weekly pig-fest. Maddy and I ordered the same thing (great, no one digging in my damn plate!!), lobster shrimp and grits, and it was so delicious! I've never had grits before, and was scared to try them and waste my money. Yes, I am risking getting my black card revoked for admitting it, but when I told the waitress (Lily) that I hadn't tried it, she was very patient and explained how it would taste. They were rich, soft and had a velvety texture due to the cream and 1/2 pound of cheese and butter mixed in! The tomato broth amply complimented the grits, and my friend who doesn't like her broth to touch her food (she asked for it on the side), wound up putting it together after all because the dish worked PERFECTLY together. A culinary masterpiece. It was a smidge saltier than our palate allows, but we agreed it was probably because the chef salted the grits too, which was unnecessary given the sodium laden seafood. When I checked in, Lily gave me a free Mardi Gras cocktail, and it hit the spot. In the future, I will request it w/o the spices of cinnamon and nutmeg. However, the stand out aperitif was the hibiscus sweet tea! That drink was fireeee!!! I could use one right now, as I'm writing this. One thing patrons have to remember when eating here, is that this is Creole FUSION, not authentic NOLA fare. Think Jamaican & Southern mash-up. So, if you're looking for Emeril's in the heart of Clinton Hill, you're setting yourself up for disappointment.I cannot wait to return, as this place is the reason I work out 6x a week!!

"SoCo is wonderful!!! If you are in the area, please do yourself the favor. This is our go to spot for Sunday brunches with the fam. I usually come in a large group, about 10 of us. The service is absolutely amazing! Usually it's impossible to make reservations for a large group, last minute. However, SoCo has always managed to accommodate us. Now, I would like to think myself as a chicken and waffle connoisseur. LA, Miami, NY.. I always try to get my fix anywhere. Anyway, as I am NOT a fan of red velvet... These waffles are delightful and let's not even get started on the chicken.. Cooked to perfection. I've never had complaints about that.  I have also tried sides like the Mac and cheese and and grits, also very tasty. The mimosas are great and my all time favorite French 75 which is mixed to perfection. SOCO IS A MUST!",5.0
Well this was my first time here after I've been hearing about this place over several months. Upon entry the staff I very warm & greeting. The ambiance is fantastic. My waitress was very delightful & informative when it came to ordering a cocktail. The California shrimp rolls are to die for & the chicken red velvet waffle just melts in your mouth. I certainly will revisit & I recommend everyone to visit.,5.0
"Great food and drinks.  The dude at the door with the funky haircut, his attitude sucks.  Everyone else that we dealt with, such as the waiters and waitresses were all fine.Party of five, 6pm reservation.  They call me @ 4:30pm to confirm.  I ask if it's okay to arrive early and they say yes.  We arrive just after 5 and they tell us, ""... kitchen is on intermission for an half hour ... "".  What? Is this an old time movie theater?  They could've mentioned that over the phone.  Anyway, I smile and say okay and we take a seat a few feet away from the maitre d's podium.Around 6pm, about 20+ people have arrived and congregating around the door.  They then start seating people.  Nobody calls me, so I approach Mr funky haircut ""Are you seating people?""""Yes""""Okay, we've been here since 5""He asks for my name, looks at his book and says in a condescending tone""You never checked in""Now, I don't know what constitutes ""check in"" but I know we made ourselves known when we walked in.  When his partner returned to the podium, he had a slight case of amnesia and also asked for my name.  They mumbled something to each other and then proceeded to have someone seat us.  No apology for the wait and no apology for the mistake one of them made regarding check in.I spoke to them in a reasonable tone.  I expect the same back. They are a business after all.  But that wasn't to be.  I won't be planning anymore group events at Soco.  There's other places in BK with good food and of similar size with better attitude at the door.",3.0

"Had brunch here and was consistently disappointed.  Service was spotty, not rude or bad, but we had to request things like butter several times.  I also ordered something that never materialized.  Another disappointment was they were out of several things, even though we arrived for the first seating at noon:- Sangria- Jam- Asparagus- Scones- Banana BreadI when asked if some of the above items would be available in an hour (perhaps the chef slept in that day) I was told no.  While I can understand perhaps asparagus wasn't delivered or something, but the waiter said they ran out of the Sangria the night before, but I still don't understand why they couldn't make more?  I was disappointed to not be able to try the sangria because my friend told me it was amazing.I can't review their signature dish because I don't eat chicken, but it looked good, and my friend liked it.  In fact I'm giving this place 2 stars, even though my personal experience is 1 star,  because I don't think it is fair to give it a totally bad review if I'm not able to try their signature dish.  I will say though, if you go, you had better order the chicken and waffles, because everything I had was mediocre at best.Had a watermelon mojito which was ok.  We ordered the bread basket to start, which is supposed to include 3 types of bread but only had 3 pieces of cornbread and they were out of the other kinds, and there was no jam.  The cornbread was actually very good.  It was a little oily, but very yummy as they added a nice herb to it which I think may have been either thyme or rosemary.  But I'm not really satisfied with getting 3 mini muffins for $4.00.I did the build your own omelette, which I do not recommend anyone ever order.  Onions (half cooked), goat cheese (too much was used), and Mushrooms in the omelette, served with cold breakfast potatoes and one piece of toast cut in half, burned on one side and not toasted at all on the other side.  The restaurant itself is cute, chairs are comfy, bathroom attended is a nice lady, but really?  Myrtle Ave in Brooklyn?  Prices are also crazy, with tip I paid $38.00 for a good piece of corn bread, an ok drink, and a horrible omelette.  Ugh.** Vegetarian's Tip: The grits are made with chicken stock**",2.0

"Came here with two of my friends for lunch one day. Pretty far from where I live and was hoping it would be good. IMO it was ok not amazing but not bad either.

"I tried the red velvet waffles & chicken here... and now no other place I've gone to after can compare. The waffle was fluffy and moist.  The bone-in chicken breast was extremely flavorful, the breading on the chicken was crunchy with every bite... would put any Popeye's to shame.. not overly salty at all. The buttermilk coating makes a hell of a difference. I also tried the mac & cheese... Tasty, but I've tasted better. The drinks, good but not memorable. The spacing... TIGHT! We were damn near rubbing elbows (literally) with the people on either side of us and there were people flooding this place in packs, standing by in close quarters, anxious for a seat. Kinda took away from the date night romance.. but would definitely come again and come earlier for better parking on the street.Overall I definitely recommend giving it a try.",4.0

"Made 2 pm reservations to come here with friends on Sunday for a hungover brunch. Unfortunately, I missed my reservation and had to wait, but the host was really nice and accommodated my request to sit outside. After about a half hour wait, we were seated outside. I already knew I wanted to try out the red velvet waffle and fried chicken. We got two orders of that mac and cheese and free cornbread from checking on Yelp. Everything was very good. Their alcohol brunch is on Saturdays. $12 for unlimited mimosas. The drinks are an average of $13 individually. I opted out of drinking while a friend got a Bloody Mary. I took a sip and it was so spicy. I wasn't a fan, but my friend loved it. Usually I'm a little tipsy at brunch or straight up drunk so everything is delicious, but since I decided not to drink (bc I'm cheap) and I was hungover I was a little more critical than usual. The cornbread was exceptional though. Served with melted butter it was the best I've ever had. Three perfect cornbread muffins was great for the three of us. Not too dry, not too corny (yeah I said that), it was definitely a hit. The outer layer of the Mac and cheese that was baked to perfection was delicious. I wasn't crazy about the inner layer. The Mac was made with a lot of garlic and I can easily describe the inside as creamy garlic noodles. The main event, the red velvet waffle and buttermilk fried chicken was very good, but definitely overhyped. The waffle is good. The red velvet is more subtle than it appears which is good, because it's not dessert. The fried chicken is crispy on the outside, but also a little bit dry on the inside. Next time I would come back on a Saturday for alcohol and try out the wings and other things I saw the people around me eating. Oh and I would make sure I didn't miss my reservation!",3.0
"I came here a few weeks ago to meet up with someone. It was on a Thursday I believe and the place was pretty busy. All walks of life in this restaurant, which was a bit off-setting for me; Usually, most restaurants have a certain crowd. Anyway, I didn't come to eat, mostly to just have a drink and talk.

great atmosphere! a live violinist was jamming to some r&b hits...i tried the blackened salmon with mashed sweet potatoes and green beans...it was a mix of sweet and sour taste...the salmon was very light...loved the dish...i also ordered the mardi gras and the strawberry moonshine martinis...the mardi gras martini was a little too sweet for me...the strawberry moonshine is the drink you'll want to order!,4.0

"Came here at 1pm on a Saturday. Prime time for brunch. Even though the place was packed and there were people waiting, we were seated right away. I guess that's the advantage of the 2-person brunch.The service was fast and courteous and the food was on point. We got the Sausage with Grits and the Chicken & Waffles. The buttermilk fried chicken was especially tender and juicy. I prefer my waffle to be a little more crispy on the outside, but it was definitely still good. Nice and fluffy. The sausage and grits were delicious.",4.0
"Came here with two of my friends for lunch one day. Pretty far from where I live and was hoping it would be good. IMO it was ok not amazing but not bad either. For appetizers we ordered the fried green tomatoes and corn bread. People weren't kidding that corn bread is like crack wish we had more. The green tomatoes were solid too. Entrees included the fried chicken, omelet and eggs benedict. Nothing spectacular the fried chicken was ok with a hint of velvet cake. Wouldn't come back again",3.0
"Second time visiting this spot.  I can't remember what I had the first time, which means it was nothing for me to write about.  This go around I had the corn bread (free with a check in from yelp people, so make sure you do this), which was a nice bonus.  It was solid, but have had better.  Salmon was ok, but was cooked a little too much.  We were seated fast, but it took forever for our food to come out.  Been there, done that and no need to go back.",3.0
"I tried the red velvet waffles & chicken here... and now no other place I've gone to after can compare. The waffle was fluffy and moist.  The bone-in chicken breast was extremely flavorful, the breading on the chicken was crunchy with every bite... would put any Popeye's to shame.. not overly salty at all. The buttermilk coating makes a hell of a difference. I also tried the mac & cheese... Tasty, but I've tasted better. The drinks, good but not memorable. The spacing... TIGHT! We were damn near rubbing elbows (literally) with the people on either side of us and there were people flooding this place in packs, standing by in close quarters, anxious for a seat. Kinda took away from the date night romance.. but would definitely come again and come earlier for better parking on the street.Overall I definitely recommend giving it a try.",4.0
"Drinks weak, food so so, service ok will I come back NO! I can do better at home. If you're coming here be opened minded Mac n cheese is not that good taste like it came out of a box could use some smoke gouda if I had a talk with the chef but I won't.",3.0
"Made 2 pm reservations to come here with friends on Sunday for a hungover brunch. Unfortunately, I missed my reservation and had to wait, but the host was really nice and accommodated my request to sit outside. After about a half hour wait, we were seated outside. I already knew I wanted to try out the red velvet waffle and fried chicken. We got two orders of that mac and cheese and free cornbread from checking on Yelp. Everything was very good. Their alcohol brunch is on Saturdays. $12 for unlimited mimosas. The drinks are an average of $13 individually. I opted out of drinking while a friend got a Bloody Mary. I took a sip and it was so spicy. I wasn't a fan, but my friend loved it. Usually I'm a little tipsy at brunch or straight up drunk so everything is delicious, but since I decided not to drink (bc I'm cheap) and I was hungover I was a little more critical than usual. The cornbread was exceptional though. Served with melted butter it was the best I've ever had. Three perfect cornbread muffins was great for the three of us. Not too dry, not too corny (yeah I said that), it was definitely a hit. The outer layer of the Mac and cheese that was baked to perfection was delicious. I wasn't crazy about the inner layer. The Mac was made with a lot of garlic and I can easily describe the inside as creamy garlic noodles. The main event, the red velvet waffle and buttermilk fried chicken was very good, but definitely overhyped. The waffle is good. The red velvet is more subtle than it appears which is good, because it's not dessert. The fried chicken is crispy on the outside, but also a little bit dry on the inside. Next time I would come back on a Saturday for alcohol and try out the wings and other things I saw the people around me eating. Oh and I would make sure I didn't miss my reservation!",3.0
"I came here a few weeks ago to meet up with someone. It was on a Thursday I believe and the place was pretty busy. All walks of life in this restaurant, which was a bit off-setting for me; Usually, most restaurants have a certain crowd. Anyway, I didn't come to eat, mostly to just have a drink and talk.

"Was there yesterday for a birthday brunch for me and my niece.  After they told her that due to the number of diners reservations couldn't be made - this was over the phone - we proceeded to wait over the time-frame they quoted - 1.5 hours.  When my niece inquired about how long we'd been waiting they decided to tell her that she should have made reservations.  She reiterated what was told to her and stated she made plans based on the information provided to her which was ""no reservations for the number of people you're bringing"".  You would think that a party of 11 would require reservations as they sure had no problem adding a 20% tip due to the number of guests.  As for the food - all I can say is after a 2+ hour wait we were all hungry but the food didn't live up to comments I read on Yelp.  I will not give up though and will try again with a smaller party and by ordering something else.  I had the Skirt Steak, eggs (which seemed to have been cooked hours ago) and ""home fries"" - which turned out to be too spicy smashed potatoes.    I hope to provide a better review the next time I visit.",3.0

"We walked in and there was a bouncer at the door. I'm always bothered when restaurants have a bouncer. I personally feel like that means your restaurant frequently has drama... But again that's just me. Finally we make our way pass the bouncer. Though we were late for our reservations we were seated immediately. As we are seated I am looking around and I'm loving the atmosphere and the quality of people. Being a black, artistic female from the Bronx its not often I get to be in a space full of people like me seeing as to how the Bronx is mostly Hispanic. so I was loving the vibe.The people were beautiful, classy, well dressed (accept for a few who clearly don't get out much and put on everything they had in their closet) and lively.Upon being seated we were poured a glass of water from our own bottle of water ... The bottle was cute... It resembled a mason jar. Very different. I am an avid water drinker so I was happy about my glass of water until I realized it was room temperature. Very disappointing seeing as to how it was very hot in the restaurant. My date almost immediately started to sweat.Our waitress (I forget her name) was very soft spoken and adorable. She greeted us almost instantly.After giving us a few moments our waitress returns and takes our dinner and drink order. I order the shrimp and lobster over grits and a side of string beans. My date ordered the red velvet waffles and fried chicken and a side of their ""famous"" mac and cheese. For a drink we order the watermelon daiquiri. The daiquiri's came first of course. The presentation was adorable... It came in a bottle and had their own label on it... Very cute and very good. It also packed a bit of a punch if you're drinking it on an empty stomach.The food arrived and I was very visually stimulated. I mean I figured out what I was ordering before we even arrived so I was very excited (I'm a big time foodie). Excited for my first bite I was immediately let down. The was no powerful flavor. It was rather bland. The grits were cooked well but had no flavor. On my quest for flavor I ate a shrimp... It was good but I was not overly impressed. It was just good not great. I love string beans so I prayed that was amazing but again, just good not great. I had to add salt because it was so VERY  bland. My date, who knows that I love food,realized I was displeased so he asked me if I wanted to taste his food... THE WAFFLES WERE FREAKING AMAZING... ABSOLUTELY TO DIE FOR... The chicken on the other hand was cooked to perfection but lacked flavor. Pitifully bland. The mac and cheeses was OK. That's it.. Just okay. Definitely not worth the $10 that they charge for it though. Especially considering that it seems like they use powder cheese to make it. The flavor was okay but it wasn't amazing. It didn't knock you out your seat.I finally return to my own plate. I ate very unenthusiastically. It was just eating to sustain life at this point. I left my lobster for last... (I compartmentally eat)... The lobster was amazing. Packed with flavor and cooked to perfection. It was great. I wish all of our food was as amazing as the waffles and the lobster.This place is mostly for visually stimulation and atmosphere. The food really just isn't great. It has potential but it really just isn't there. I think all the buzz is created by people who don't go out much or at least not to any places of quality so they get here and are amazed. And again it is very visually stimulating place but that's where it all stops. I'd come here to hangout and have a few drinks but never for a dinner date.

Side of Macaroni and cheese was also included in our order and It was amazing!! baked perfectly!!This restaurant is a little pricey.

"Made reservations via Open Table and when we arrived (on time) , they did not have us on the list.  So basically, we had to wait an around 45 mn to be seated... all while hungry  and cold (the door kept opening every 15mn bringing in a whiff of the cold air...this is way back in Nov). The inside is nicely  decorated. Loud festive ambiance.We were seated near the entrance by the dreaded door which kept bringing in cold air. The food kinda redeemed everything. Decent sangria. The ribs were great as an appetizer. Had the famous buttermilk fried chicken and red velvet waffle. It was indeed awesome. Portion a little too small for the price (they could have  thrown in an extra waffle!). I was salivating for more before my last bite. Shrimp & lobster grits was also an excellent choice.   We also had the mac n cheese which made for a great side . Service started out great. Our server was attentive, gave good recommendations. As the night lingered (and more people started rolling in),  we saw less and less of him. Our mac and cheese side came way after we were done with our entrees. No water refills. And we also had to wait extra just to get dessert and for the check. Essentially, we could have left an hour before we actually exited the establishment.Despite the service mishap, I certainly look forward to coming back for the food + good bar scene.  As long as they keep the same chef serving up that Southern cuisine, I'll be back.",3.0

"So apparently, Myrtle Avenue in BK is the place to see and be seen while eating good. With that, the next stop was SoCoBK. This place is small and very noisy, but cute. It sort of has a modern industrial feel and there is outdoor seating in the rear. The staff was polite and on point. The food was pretty good as well. The mac n cheese that everyone raves about was just okay to me. It is seasoned with some garlic powder like flavor and it's just a bad move in my opinion. The shrimp appetizer was burnt on the outside and raw on the inside like they had been fried in grease that was too hot and did not cook long enough. The sweet potato pancakes and the lobster/shrimp & grits were delish! Overall, I give this spot 3 out of 5 stars. I'll probably go again in the near future.",3.0

Portion a little too small for the price (they could have  thrown in an extra waffle!). I was salivating for more before my last bite. Shrimp & lobster grits was also an excellent choice.   We also had the mac n cheese which made for a great side . Service started out great. Our server was attentive, gave good recommendations. As the night lingered (and more people started rolling in),  we saw less and less of him. Our mac and cheese side came way after we were done with our entrees. No water refills. And we also had to wait extra just to get dessert and for the check. Essentially, we could have left an hour before we actually exited the establishment.Despite the service mishap, I certainly look forward to coming back for the food + good bar scene.  As long as they keep the same chef serving up that Southern cuisine, I'll be back.",3.0
"I was super impressed with this place. The bloody mary's were amazing and I felt like it was made just for me. I got the chicken and waffles. The red velvet waffles were delicious, as was the fried chicken. My fiancé and I were fighting over the fried chicken. Literally! He had the short rib hash, which was also amazing. I ended with a hibiscus margarita which was strong but balanced and sweet. I was so happy! I will definitely go again.",5.0
He wait staff is politic but the management is awful!  After spending hundred of dollars one of my party was asked to move to a different seat before we got our food so that they could seat more people. She had to sit on her husbands lap before they had a new seat for her.,1.0

"So apparently, Myrtle Avenue in BK is the place to see and be seen while eating good. With that, the next stop was SoCoBK. This place is small and very noisy, but cute. It sort of has a modern industrial feel and there is outdoor seating in the rear. The staff was polite and on point. The food was pretty good as well. The mac n cheese that everyone raves about was just okay to me. It is seasoned with some garlic powder like flavor and it's just a bad move in my opinion. The shrimp appetizer was burnt on the outside and raw on the inside like they had been fried in grease that was too hot and did not cook long enough. The sweet potato pancakes and the lobster/shrimp & grits were delish! Overall, I give this spot 3 out of 5 stars. I'll probably go again in the near future.",3.0

Went here on a Saturday night with my boyfriend and OMG this place is heaven on earth! The food was amazingly delicious and the atmosphere is great! We didn't realize that this place was more on the grown and sexy side so we felt a bit underdressed but it wasn't too bad. We were told the wait was about an hour but we only ended up waiting for about 20-25 minutes.Appetizers-- We ordered the Soco Baby Back Ribs and the Carolina Shrimp Rolls. Both were sinfully good.Entrees-- I had the Chicken and Red Velvet Waffle. He had the Smoked BBQ Chicken with String Beans and Mashed Sweet Potatoes. I'm usually not one to finish apeptizers AND my enitre entree but that night I was scraping the plate! The only thing that didn't wow me were his mashed sweet potatoes but they were alright. My drink was the Wild Strawberry Moonshine. Very well made and tasted great. My only complaints are that it was FREEZING cold in there and the food took a bit long to come out. But it's so worth the wait! Can't wait to go back!,4.0

"Fried Chicken & Red Velvet Waffle. A-MAZING!! Need I say more??

We went on a Sunday at 12noon, just when the place opened (don't understand why they open so late), so didn't really need our reservations.Prices could be a deterrent, but worth trying at least once!

"So I actually made the reservations on yelp for Sunday brunch (for 2) and surprisingly, they had a little issue with that.  I guess there's a little bit of a disconnect between them and opentable.com because they said they couldn't find my name on the reservation list.

She even gives us suggestions for the drinks which I really appreciated! For drinks I had the Red Lemonade which had the right amount of alcohol while still being fruity just how I like it!

"I try not to give out 5 stars often - I feel like to get five stars, you REALLY need to knock my socks off. SoCo did that for me though, and here's why.The service you receive here is really attentive. I'm going to preface that with saying that I came here on a weekday, but I really feel that even if I was here on a Sunday afternoon during brunch hours, I'd get the same level of service. Our waiter (whose name escapes me now) answered all of our questions pertaining to the food and drinks; I'm one of 'those' who feels the need to know what the best dish is, what the flavors are, etc etc.So after hearing our waiter's suggestions, we went with the jelly chicken wings with Tzatziki sauce for the appetizer and 'california' rolls. Our entrees were chicken and waffles, lobster shrimp & grits, and the skirt steak. We also ordered a side of mac and cheese.The appetizers were reeeeeeeeeeally good. Like, lick your fingers, I-wish-I-wasnt-sharing-with-you good. The wings were really juicy and full of flavor and the tzatziki sauce was a really great combo. The rolls, oh emmm geee!! They were stuffed with shrimp, basmati rice, kale tempura with wasabi mayo and ginger. They were absolutely amazing and such a great twist on sushi. After those apps, we couldn't wait for the entrees.Now, I am also one of 'those' who also feels like I am *the* fried chicken and red velvet connoisseur. I believe that fried chicken is moist, flavorful, crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. My red velvet *must* be the perfect balance between cake and icing - I for one, prefer my icing to be cream cheese based, because then it balances out the sweet cocoa flavors of the cake. It should be moist, not dry, but not overdone to the point where its heavy. Anyway, you get my drift... I'm anal about my chix and waffles.So you can only imagine my happiness when their dish satisfied all of my cravings and guidelines! It was absolutely delicious, the chicken was all sorts of good, the waffle was amazing, and the orange liquer syrup that they paired it with (which I THOUGHT would've been a hit or miss) was such a hit. My friends also loved their dishes - the grits were really delish, and the skirt steak was nicely seasoned. The mac and cheese was REALLY good, a nice balance of being just the right amount of cheesy, and the crispy layer on top was so good.For dessert we managed to squeeze in a couple of bites of bread pudding which too, was just as good as the entrees. BUT! Quite possibly the best part of our experience was getting to meet chef Kingsley John himself. He's such a shy and quiet and reserved person, but he was willing to take a picture with my cousin and I, and he graciously accepted our compliments of his dishes. Get your butt over to this restaurant as soon as you can!",5.0
After reading so many great reviews on this place we ventured out of our cozy bay ridge and decided to give brunch a try. SOOO very glad we did!! There was a wait when we got there around 12:30 which we expected so we saddled up to the bar and were offered to have brunch there. Sure!! No wait! Our bartender/server was Sumaiya and she was PHENOMENAL. Her suggestions on drinks and food were on point. I had the hibiscus margarita and my bf had the strawberry moonshine. Both delicious! I ordered the crawfish eggs Benedict and he had the crowd favorite of fried chicken and waffle but it's a RED VELVET waffle! On her suggestion we got a side of the Mac n cheese. To call it a side doesn't do it justice because it's a meal on its own! My bf doesn't really like waffles but these waffles made him a believer! Now he says he just likes THESE waffles. They were fluffy and perfect! My Benedict was amazing with perfectly poached eggs and an old bay hollandaise that was beyond good! We will definitely be back and most likely for dinner next time!! Well done!!!,5.0
"Service is friendly, food took forever to come out but I can honestly say I was pretty impressed with what they served. Everyone talks about the fried chicken with red velvet waffle.. while the idea sounds quite unique and probably tastes like heaven in your mind- it's alright. The waffle itself didn't have too much flavor, chicken was okay. I've had a better fried chicken and waffle from Clinton St. Bakery (you're welcome). The mac n cheese was crack if I knew what crack tasted like and definitely would come back just to get that lol. My girlfriend had the skirt steak- texture was as if it was still cold when cooked. Very chewy and rare on the inside while overcooked on the outside. Overall, a good experience for some soul food. Ambiance is in between casual/hood.",3.0
"I'd heard great things about the food and finally decided to sample some with my own palettes.  The creative soul food combinations on the menu were very interesting. For starters,  I ordered the smoked BBQ chicken wings.  Oh my! They were absolutely amazing!  Juicy, tender, full of flavor and cooked to perfection! The BBQ sauce had a slight pepper spice kick that complimented the sweetness well.  For my entree, I decided on the herb marinated skirt steak with collard greens and mashed sweet potatoes.  What a delight! The steak was very tender and chimichurri was fresh and flavorful.  The collards and potatoes were also just as tasty!Our waiter Brian had a great personality and was very attentive! His southern hospitality was  charming!Overall a real cool ""soul food meets creole"" spot... looking forward to my next visit!",4.0
Dayum............. so I went to Soco to celebrate my Birthday yesterday and the place is still poppin and rockin........... So ever since I visited LA last month and ate at Rosco Chicken and Waffles - I have developed a taste for fried chicken with waffles........... so ever since I came back I was thinking to myself where would I go to eat that if that taste even came back to my taste buds............. Well Well Well............... I almost forgot that Soco was known for their red velvet chicken and waffles......... DUUUUUUUUUUUH!So I said to my friends - this is where we are going for my Bday - and let me tell you the fried chicken and waffles did not disappointing - IT WAS DELICIOUS........ DELICIOUS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! DELICIOUS!!!!!!!!  DAYUM!!!!!!!!!!!And what made it perfect is - on Thursday - the restaurant has the pre-fix Ladies Night Menu............. for only $25. Guess What  - they have all the good stuff is on there.......Happy Eating!!!!!!!!!!!!,4.0
"Do you like Mac & Cheese? Do you like chicken and waffles? What about beef ribs? Then get your ass down here for some awesome southern food. The Mac is cheesy and creamy. The Chicken comes with a bangin Red velvet waffle, and the beef ribs melt in your mouth. Everything tastes great, the service is great, and the servers are very friendly. There's a stacked bar, and they also have a nice selection of drinks they've thrown together that are inspired by that southern goodness. The place doesn't have a southern comfort feel, but more of a modern lounge type vibe. Either way, the food speaks for itself. Try it or else you'll feel bad the next time your friends talk about it in front of you and you were the only idiot who didn't go because you had ""plans"". Right.....",5.0

"I love this placeI had the Lobster, Shrimp and Grits $24 it was so good.  The food looked amazing the serving was perfect.  The shrimp wasn't hard and over cooked like I find at so many restaurants.  My girl had the special Red Snapper, Collard Greens w/ dirty rice $25 and her meal was even more amazing than mine.  If anybody knows me know that I hate okra.  No...I HATE okra.  But she forced me to try the dirty rice an it was actually good.  The fish was seasoned well and delicious.  We took the Fried Chicken w/ Red Velvet Waffle home an ate it that night, very good.I wanna go again",5.0
"I try not to give out 5 stars often - I feel like to get five stars, you REALLY need to knock my socks off. SoCo did that for me though, and here's why.The service you receive here is really attentive. I'm going to preface that with saying that I came here on a weekday, but I really feel that even if I was here on a Sunday afternoon during brunch hours, I'd get the same level of service. Our waiter (whose name escapes me now) answered all of our questions pertaining to the food and drinks; I'm one of 'those' who feels the need to know what the best dish is, what the flavors are, etc etc.So after hearing our waiter's suggestions, we went with the jelly chicken wings with Tzatziki sauce for the appetizer and 'california' rolls. Our entrees were chicken and waffles, lobster shrimp & grits, and the skirt steak. We also ordered a side of mac and cheese.The appetizers were reeeeeeeeeeally good. Like, lick your fingers, I-wish-I-wasnt-sharing-with-you good. The wings were really juicy and full of flavor and the tzatziki sauce was a really great combo. The rolls, oh emmm geee!! They were stuffed with shrimp, basmati rice, kale tempura with wasabi mayo and ginger. They were absolutely amazing and such a great twist on sushi. After those apps, we couldn't wait for the entrees.Now, I am also one of 'those' who also feels like I am *the* fried chicken and red velvet connoisseur. I believe that fried chicken is moist, flavorful, crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. My red velvet *must* be the perfect balance between cake and icing - I for one, prefer my icing to be cream cheese based, because then it balances out the sweet cocoa flavors of the cake. It should be moist, not dry, but not overdone to the point where its heavy. Anyway, you get my drift... I'm anal about my chix and waffles.So you can only imagine my happiness when their dish satisfied all of my cravings and guidelines! It was absolutely delicious, the chicken was all sorts of good, the waffle was amazing, and the orange liquer syrup that they paired it with (which I THOUGHT would've been a hit or miss) was such a hit. My friends also loved their dishes - the grits were really delish, and the skirt steak was nicely seasoned. The mac and cheese was REALLY good, a nice balance of being just the right amount of cheesy, and the crispy layer on top was so good.For dessert we managed to squeeze in a couple of bites of bread pudding which too, was just as good as the entrees. BUT! Quite possibly the best part of our experience was getting to meet chef Kingsley John himself. He's such a shy and quiet and reserved person, but he was willing to take a picture with my cousin and I, and he graciously accepted our compliments of his dishes. Get your butt over to this restaurant as soon as you can!",5.0
After reading so many great reviews on this place we ventured out of our cozy bay ridge and decided to give brunch a try. SOOO very glad we did!! There was a wait when we got there around 12:30 which we expected so we saddled up to the bar and were offered to have brunch there. Sure!! No wait! Our bartender/server was Sumaiya and she was PHENOMENAL. Her suggestions on drinks and food were on point. I had the hibiscus margarita and my bf had the strawberry moonshine. Both delicious! I ordered the crawfish eggs Benedict and he had the crowd favorite of fried chicken and waffle but it's a RED VELVET waffle! On her suggestion we got a side of the Mac n cheese. To call it a side doesn't do it justice because it's a meal on its own! My bf doesn't really like waffles but these waffles made him a believer! Now he says he just likes THESE waffles. They were fluffy and perfect! My Benedict was amazing with perfectly poached eggs and an old bay hollandaise that was beyond good! We will definitely be back and most likely for dinner next time!! Well done!!!,5.0
"Service is friendly, food took forever to come out but I can honestly say I was pretty impressed with what they served. Everyone talks about the fried chicken with red velvet waffle.. while the idea sounds quite unique and probably tastes like heaven in your mind- it's alright. The waffle itself didn't have too much flavor, chicken was okay. I've had a better fried chicken and waffle from Clinton St. Bakery (you're welcome). The mac n cheese was crack if I knew what crack tasted like and definitely would come back just to get that lol. My girlfriend had the skirt steak- texture was as if it was still cold when cooked. Very chewy and rare on the inside while overcooked on the outside. Overall, a good experience for some soul food. Ambiance is in between casual/hood.",3.0
"I'd heard great things about the food and finally decided to sample some with my own palettes.  The creative soul food combinations on the menu were very interesting. For starters,  I ordered the smoked BBQ chicken wings.  Oh my! They were absolutely amazing!  Juicy, tender, full of flavor and cooked to perfection! The BBQ sauce had a slight pepper spice kick that complimented the sweetness well.  For my entree, I decided on the herb marinated skirt steak with collard greens and mashed sweet potatoes.  What a delight! The steak was very tender and chimichurri was fresh and flavorful.  The collards and potatoes were also just as tasty!Our waiter Brian had a great personality and was very attentive! His southern hospitality was  charming!Overall a real cool ""soul food meets creole"" spot... looking forward to my next visit!",4.0

"Do you like Mac & Cheese? Do you like chicken and waffles? What about beef ribs? Then get your ass down here for some awesome southern food. The Mac is cheesy and creamy. The Chicken comes with a bangin Red velvet waffle, and the beef ribs melt in your mouth. Everything tastes great, the service is great, and the servers are very friendly. There's a stacked bar, and they also have a nice selection of drinks they've thrown together that are inspired by that southern goodness. The place doesn't have a southern comfort feel, but more of a modern lounge type vibe. Either way, the food speaks for itself. Try it or else you'll feel bad the next time your friends talk about it in front of you and you were the only idiot who didn't go because you had ""plans"". Right.....",5.0
"I went here on a Sunday afternoon with my girl and must say I was impressed by the food, especially the Mac and cheese and the ambiance if the place. The staff was courteous and service was prompt.

I'm not sure what others may have experienced but I love soco and my favorite bartender is my girl Tasha!  We have been coming over 3 years and have received great service with good food.

"Here I feel like we definitely got a ton of bang for our buck. Down home cuisine, big flavors, big portions, and a cool crowd.

And boy was he right! We ordered a little of everything -- collard greens, red beans and rice, salmon, chicken and ribs. There was no room left in our stomachs for dessert but we will be back! The cuisine touched our southern hearts.  While dining, an elevated, live DJ will immerse you with soulful music and beats to keep the happiness flowing. My friends and I have the soul food discussion on occasion: like who makes the best? What borough dominates in comfort food cuisine?  We never all agree on the best, but we do agree that soulful food /creole etc. is an area where few succeed.

"I held out hope for a restaurant near my apartment that would serve great fried chicken and waffles. Unfortunately that was not the case. I was raised in Los Angeles where roscoes chicken and waffles reins supreme. The fried chicken was good but not spectacular. For 21 dollars I received three pieces and a waffle. A leg, thigh and wing. The wing was tiny and the thigh adequate. The waffle was garbage, plastic  and inedible. I also ordered red beans and rice which were way uncooked. That is unacceptable. My girlfriend ordered the lobster, shrimp and grits which was overpriced at 28 dollars and also inedible. The lobster was rubbery and way over cooked. The grits were under seasoned and not at all palatable. I had high hopes but this restaurant was definitely a fail and I will never dine here again. Epic fail.",1.0

For a place that serve soul food they try to put a twist on it. Many enjoy their grits and shrimps others enjoy their red velvet pancakes and fried chicken. The bathroom area is interesting and different than you're use to. Their out door seating is refreshing and their drinks are good. I would not recommend their burger though it was very dry even though they tried to jazz it up. For me personally that was not the way to go. Their Mac and cheese is pretty good the corn bread is good as well. The atmosphere is noisy and they tend to play loud music at night. The crowd is mixed due to the neighborhood. It is a good place to enjoy,3.0
Pleasantly surprised! They got it right. The gumbo was good. Cornbread was good. And the fried chicken was good. Those three basic southern dishes is a must for a Southern New Orleans themed restaurant. Service was great. The mardi gras cocktail was my favorite. Will defiantly be back soon!,4.0
"Making a reservation was a roller-coaster. For a Party of 22 I expected to get special treatment for my birthday, so I tried to work with the restaurant management which was a hassle. I know a large party is difficult to accommodate, but I am bringing YOU business....1st they did not have my reservation confirmed then I had to call to followup to make sure they finally got it right two more times.Then the Prefix Menu's they had one for $25 the other for $35 were not offered for the same time period. The $25 one was for the weekdays and the $35 was for the weekendLike other places there was a cake fee, so I decided to leave my cake at home.But after all these bumps I still continued with the reservation because there were so many people. Thank goodness the service turned out to be much better than I expected. The place was nice and modern, the crowd was young and there was a steady flow of business all night.Popular options off of the Prefix Menu were the:Blackened SalmonSmoked Pumpkin RavioliSmoked BBQI enjoyed the fried Chicken and waffle, their mac and cheese was definitely scrumches so that was food for the soul.Soco is best suited for a small party in my opinion, large parties with the limited menu takes away from the experience.",3.0
This place is overated. The inside is nice but thats not enough. They give u tap water in a fancy glass *rolls eyes* the food is soo nasty. Its super spicy for no reason.  The waiter took so long to bring out that nasty food. This place is expensive for no reason,1.0
"I went to SoCo last night with a few friends. My overall review of this restaurant is OK. Here's why.The hostess was very pleasant and helped us find the best seats the restaurant could muster. However, the seating is very tight. In some areas, you'll come face to face with someone else's butt when they get up to leave their seat. Not fun, not at a restaurant like this. Our waitress was cordial and attentive, followed our cues. Nice job.The drinks, DON'T BOTHER. They are very weak. Come there pre-gamed or go somewhere else to get drinks afterward. I've warned you.The short ribs were excellent, In my opinion, there's enough meat there for two people. The collard greens were ok. The fish and grits were ok as well. I liked the shrimp in it, but the grits left something to be desired. (The fish and grits from my fav brunch spot has me spoiled) My friend loved the chicken that came with the red velvet chicken and waffles. But she said the waffle was more cakey than like a waffle. The Jambalaya is delicious! If I ever go back, I'll get that. But, I probably won't go back. Although the place has a sleek decor and is updated and modern, it as a stiff feel. It doesn't exude a warm ambience that will make you feel like you want to be a regular. I wouldn't suggest it as a date spot because you are literally sitting on top of one another. This place also has ample bar seating and stools, but the drinks are sub-par, so that ruins that portion of things.

This is my go-to spot for date night. It's Soul Food with a touch of class. But make sure you have a reservation because it gets packed really quickly. The ambiance is great and the food is to die for! My favorite dish is the jambalaya with a side of the mac & cheese. Your mouth will personally thank you. The drink menu is really creative; saw some mixtures I've never seen before like the hibiscus tequila margarita. The staff is friendly and really attractive. So if you're on a date try not to stare at the hot waiters too long.,5.0
"I had a chance to check out this restaurant last night and wasn't blown away. The decor and service was great. Me and my friend went without a reservation and was told that there was an 45 minute wait but we actually only had to wait 20 minutes.The food was mediocre. We shared the crawfish dumplings wrapped in collard greens and each opted for the lobster & shrimp over grits as our entrees. Even though the food was just ""ok"" my drink was AMAZING! I had the mardi gras - I actually had 2.My advice to the owners is to add more items to the menu. And thicken up the sauce in the lobster and shrimp entree. I've had this dish in the south and it was so much better and the sauce wasn't so loose.Oh and another plus was the music. The DJ gets 2 thumbs up and a big toe!!!!",3.0
For a place that serve soul food they try to put a twist on it. Many enjoy their grits and shrimps others enjoy their red velvet pancakes and fried chicken. The bathroom area is interesting and different than you're use to. Their out door seating is refreshing and their drinks are good. I would not recommend their burger though it was very dry even though they tried to jazz it up. For me personally that was not the way to go. Their Mac and cheese is pretty good the corn bread is good as well. The atmosphere is noisy and they tend to play loud music at night. The crowd is mixed due to the neighborhood. It is a good place to enjoy,3.0
Pleasantly surprised! They got it right. The gumbo was good. Cornbread was good. And the fried chicken was good. Those three basic southern dishes is a must for a Southern New Orleans themed restaurant. Service was great. The mardi gras cocktail was my favorite. Will defiantly be back soon!,4.0
"Making a reservation was a roller-coaster. For a Party of 22 I expected to get special treatment for my birthday, so I tried to work with the restaurant management which was a hassle. I know a large party is difficult to accommodate, but I am bringing YOU business....1st they did not have my reservation confirmed then I had to call to followup to make sure they finally got it right two more times.Then the Prefix Menu's they had one for $25 the other for $35 were not offered for the same time period. The $25 one was for the weekdays and the $35 was for the weekendLike other places there was a cake fee, so I decided to leave my cake at home.But after all these bumps I still continued with the reservation because there were so many people. Thank goodness the service turned out to be much better than I expected. The place was nice and modern, the crowd was young and there was a steady flow of business all night.Popular options off of the Prefix Menu were the:Blackened SalmonSmoked Pumpkin RavioliSmoked BBQI enjoyed the fried Chicken and waffle, their mac and cheese was definitely scrumches so that was food for the soul.Soco is best suited for a small party in my opinion, large parties with the limited menu takes away from the experience.",3.0
This place is overated. The inside is nice but thats not enough. They give u tap water in a fancy glass *rolls eyes* the food is soo nasty. Its super spicy for no reason.  The waiter took so long to bring out that nasty food. This place is expensive for no reason,1.0

"I went to Soco around 2pm on a Sunday for a post birthday brunch with some friends. I had a craving for Chicken & Waffles. The fried chicken and red velvet waffle certainly satisfied my craving while the mimosas hit the spot after a long night in the city. The service was good, I think we just beat the rush. The down side was we were seated in front of the hostess station which is basically in the waiting/bar area and has a lot of traffic and hungry patrons staring at your plate.

"My first impression of SoCo (from about 2 years ago) was INCREDIBLE. Amazing food, the best in the neighborhood. Long wait times, but always worth it because, hello, the food!!!I'm not sure if this last trip was a fluke because I did not have the same impression as I did on past visits. We were told it would be a 45 minute to an hour wait. This usually means, in my experience, an hour or more, which didn't bother us. We sat at the bar and waited the full hour before I went to check in with the host. He didn't even seem surprised to tell me that my name never made it on the list, even though I had given my phone number to the hostess when we first arrived, and she seemed to be writing it down at the time. He told me she is new and his reaction made me think this happens a lot. Thankfully we got seated right away after that.The food was still good, but not as amazing as I remembered. My favorite appetizer, the kale caesar salad, was filled with a bunch of filler romaine lettuce (!?) which had never been the case in the past. I hope this isn't the new recipe because it was pretty wildly disappointing. Overall our meal was still great. Service was mediocre as usual.If you don't mind so-so service and a potentially long wait for a table, the food is definitely worth coming here for, at least once.

"So where do I begin with the horrible service here. Came here for a birthday dinner for a friend on Dec 29 right before the new year. Even though she had called ahead to attempt to schedule a reservation, they said they would not be able to accommodate us until 12AM & that it would be better for us to just come in and wait to be seated. Which we did for about 1-2 hours.They won't seat you until everyone is there, fine. Except even when our full party did get there, we still had a 30-45 minute wait. Then the host came over and told us because of our party size of about 13 people, we would have to order from a Prix Fixe Menu. I didn't want that because my boyfriend & myself had a meal before coming and we just looking to drink and nibble. Then this became an argument because the host wasn't informed of this when she called and attempted to make the reservation.Finally they sat us and allowed us to order from the regular menu. Our server was great but she never introduced herself to me and so I can't give her any credit. Anyways, my boyfriend & I shared the mac & cheese, Carolina rolls (veggie because they were out of shrimp rolls), and a 509 Caesar salad with shredded steak. The rolls were over fried and not tasty really, the avocado wasabi on the side made them somewhat salvageable though. The salad was fine, a regular salad with meat thrown in. They used cornbread for the croutons which I didn't like because they weren't sweet like I normally like my cornbread, but my boyfriend enjoyed them so it's more of a preference thing. The mac & cheese was HORRIBLE. The top was clearly burnt and the inside was too chewy. My friend who has previously been there said it tasted better at brunch so maybe we just had a bad batch, but I don't know if I would try it again.Had the red lemonade and enjoyed that for the most part. Might try this place again for brunch since everyone raves about it, but I think dinner is just average.",3.0

Food was ok but nothing that is going to bring me back. Over price for sure and service was a bit strange.

"A group of 10 of us celebrated my birthday here at the first brunch of the year last weekend. Setting up my brunch was a breeze with the event coordinator, Melissa. She kept in contact with me from day 1 and ensured that everything went smoothly for my brunch. Some members of my party were late coming from out of town, yet the manager on site still allowed us to be seated--which is typically against their policy, so I was very grateful! Immediately the bottomless mimosas started flowing and to be the honest the rest was a joyful blur. The majority of my table ordered the chicken and red-velvet waffles with macaroni and cheese. Other food ordered were the sweet potato pancakes, f-que wings, skirt steak and eggs, and smothered pork chops. All around everyone remarked at how tasty the food was and our only complaint was that it wasn't as bottomless as the mimosas ;-) I had an awesome time, the ambiance was on point...drinks flowing, food just right, good friends and good convo...what more can a girl ask for?!",5.0

"So where do I begin with the horrible service here. Came here for a birthday dinner for a friend on Dec 29 right before the new year. Even though she had called ahead to attempt to schedule a reservation, they said they would not be able to accommodate us until 12AM & that it would be better for us to just come in and wait to be seated. Which we did for about 1-2 hours.They won't seat you until everyone is there, fine. Except even when our full party did get there, we still had a 30-45 minute wait. Then the host came over and told us because of our party size of about 13 people, we would have to order from a Prix Fixe Menu. I didn't want that because my boyfriend & myself had a meal before coming and we just looking to drink and nibble. Then this became an argument because the host wasn't informed of this when she called and attempted to make the reservation.Finally they sat us and allowed us to order from the regular menu. Our server was great but she never introduced herself to me and so I can't give her any credit. Anyways, my boyfriend & I shared the mac & cheese, Carolina rolls (veggie because they were out of shrimp rolls), and a 509 Caesar salad with shredded steak. The rolls were over fried and not tasty really, the avocado wasabi on the side made them somewhat salvageable though. The salad was fine, a regular salad with meat thrown in. They used cornbread for the croutons which I didn't like because they weren't sweet like I normally like my cornbread, but my boyfriend enjoyed them so it's more of a preference thing. The mac & cheese was HORRIBLE. The top was clearly burnt and the inside was too chewy. My friend who has previously been there said it tasted better at brunch so maybe we just had a bad batch, but I don't know if I would try it again.Had the red lemonade and enjoyed that for the most part. Might try this place again for brunch since everyone raves about it, but I think dinner is just average.",3.0
"Food is amazing, and the staff is attentive, only downside, really long wait lines, even on a Sunday.  They even told us about the Yelp check in offer for a free drink. Red velvet waffles taste good, but look better. Open floor plan but feels chic & cozy with lots of sunlight.",4.0
Food was ok but nothing that is going to bring me back. Over price for sure and service was a bit strange. It is freezing these days in NYC and as my boyfriend and I walked the first sentence the host said was welcome and to my boyfriend please remove your hat. I was dumb founded because we literally just walked in and honestly should have turned right back around. I however wanted to give them a fair chance since I love southern food. Yeah.... should've turned around.,2.0
"It was recommended to me by a co-worker so I was willing to try it out and i'm definitely glad that I did...We got in for brunch around noon and it was quiet but by the time we left it was a madhouse.....The food was dish (chicken and red velvet waffles and strawberry shortcake French toast), the ambiance was great too!I would definitely recommend making reservations before heading in...I had heard that service can be slow but I didn't experience it that day I was there....",4.0
"This review is based on my brunch experience:Food:-It's okay. Concept is there, execution is fine, but the taste... nothing to write about it.Atmosphere:-Great interior design!!-BGM was a bit loud for my tasteService:-Okay... The maitred was very friendly. Our waiter could have done a better job at being more friendly and attentive though.",3.0
"Let me preface by saying I don't like giving a bad review to hard working people.  Went there for lunch. Place was practically empty. Waited for everything thing drinks appetizer and lastly meals came 45 minutes after they were late with appetizer.  What made matters worse was the manager tried to defend the poor service and he didn't even know how bad it was.  Basically asking - ms. Lincoln "" how was the play""  we walked out.  Just wanted a good meal with my family. Got nothing but a sour taste.  Hope they learn that good food and service cannot be separated.",1.0
"A group of 10 of us celebrated my birthday here at the first brunch of the year last weekend. Setting up my brunch was a breeze with the event coordinator, Melissa. She kept in contact with me from day 1 and ensured that everything went smoothly for my brunch. Some members of my party were late coming from out of town, yet the manager on site still allowed us to be seated--which is typically against their policy, so I was very grateful! Immediately the bottomless mimosas started flowing and to be the honest the rest was a joyful blur. The majority of my table ordered the chicken and red-velvet waffles with macaroni and cheese. Other food ordered were the sweet potato pancakes, f-que wings, skirt steak and eggs, and smothered pork chops. All around everyone remarked at how tasty the food was and our only complaint was that it wasn't as bottomless as the mimosas ;-) I had an awesome time, the ambiance was on point...drinks flowing, food just right, good friends and good convo...what more can a girl ask for?!",5.0
"My trip to SoCo started out as a failed ventured to Cafeteria with a friend who came from out of town for a visit. When I realized the practicality of going to Cafeteria on a work night and getting up for an early morning appointment was near zilch I quickly took to Yelp in search of a worthy substitute and happened across SoCo. I am so glad I did!The food, the ambience, the service, the crowd...everything about this place was spot on. We ordered the Red Velvet waffle and fried chicken, hanger steak, carolina rolls, and mac and cheese. I was STUFFED but couldn't stand the thought of wasting a morsel.My stomach is paying for it now (and most likely the scale) but I'll do it all over again!",5.0
Pretty good food. Unlimited mimosa brunch only on Saturdays. I prefer to sit at the bar. My dude Brody from Portland is the killer bartender.

"So I have been to SoCo 2x so far; once for dinner and another time just for the bar scene on a weekend night. I rate it 3 because on both occasions, service was a bit slow.Dinner here was great. We had a reservation and were seated rather quickly and able to enjoy the beautiful Brooklyn spring weather. It was very crowded and service was a bit slow ( we were trying to make a plaY), but all in all, an enjoyable experience and I will definitely be back. I ordered the lobster and shrimp grits and it was just about heaven on earth.The drinks / bar scene is OK, as well. Again, very crowded but if you aren't looking to eat, you can just head straight to the bar and avoid the normal 45 min table wait. Definitely a bit of an older crowd, but a nice chill atmosphere if you want to have a good drink prior to going out.",3.0
"Came here for dinner.  I was the ""food critic"" for the night and I absolutely loved this place.  Service was spot on.  They ALWAYS kept our water level above half.  The entire staff works as a team.  It wasn't just  our waiter (Anthony) who waited on us but other staff members helped out with clearing the table and refilling out water.  Anthony is an excellent waiter, highly recommended.Onto the appetizers, we had clams, chicken leg with braised short rib, some kind of red oysters, and crawfish dumplings.  The clams was very french style driven.  Cooked well and had some butter in the sauce.  They didn't skimp out on the sauce nor the amount of clams we got.  They gave enough clams for more than 4 people.  The crawfish dumplings was very good as well.  They had lots of crawfish meat in the dumplings, it wasn't like crawfish paste or fake crawfish meat like you have for crab.  The center shrimp was big as well, I don't remember the sizing of shrimps off the top of my head but it wasn't the shrimp scampi sized shrimps.  The chicken leg with braised short rib and red oysters were complimentary of the chef.  The chicken leg and braised short rib was the BEST appetizer in my opinion.  The sauce they used and the hours of marination they used all definitely paid off.  I could taste the flavor in the meat, not just on the skin.  The blue cheese type sauce for the chicken leg was perfect.  The cheese wasn't overpowering.  You could taste the diced fresh bell peppers.  The sauce and the chicken was in perfect harmony.  The red oysters was very interesting.  I preferred it with the dry cajun rub sprinkled on top of the oyster.  I was shocked when I ate it because it was a hot dish.  I thought it would have been a cold dish.  In any case, I think the oyster could have been undercooked a little bit if they want to keep it as a hot dish.Onto the main course.  We had the pork chops crusted salmon, and red velvet waffles with fried chicken, and lobster grits (complimentary from the chef).  i liked the pork chops in the sense of the herbs he used and how he crusted it but the pork was dry for me.  If he can moisten it up, it would be a perfect dish.  The salmon was cooked perfectly.  Flaked off nicely, didn't crumble.  The asparagus that came with it was fresh and cooked properly.  The red velvet waffles was interesting.  I've never had anything like it before but after having it, I definitely prefer it over regular waffles!!  The fried chicken wasn't overly battered and they used eggs in their batter.  I think this helped make the fried chicken feel light.  The wing was excellent, thigh was a little dry.  If you can, request for the dark meat and this dish would be superb. Lastly, the lobster grits.  I thought this was the BEST main course.  Had TONS of lobster flavor in the grits and soup base and got a decently sized portion of lobster tail.  I would recommend this dish.Onto dessert.  We had the sweet potato pie and peach cobbler.  I loved the sweet potato pie.  Had fresh pecans on top of it and I couldn't taste any burntness to the crust.  Same goes with the cobbler.  Didn't taste anything burnt.  The peaches were cold, the flour wasn't overcooked probably very very slightly undercooked but it was good either way and the vanilla ice cream matched it perfectly.I got a chance to check out the outdoor seating and the bathrooms.  It's definitely too hot to sit outdoors now but there's enough space for like 20 people outdoors and I liked the wood they used.  It's solid wood not sawdust glued together.  The bathrooms were clean and I like how the wash basin is not in the same room as the toilet.  This way it facilitates the flow of the bathroom.  You'll definitely be using your fingers to eat if you try the chicken leg and braised short rib.The decor has an industrial type feel to it but it's clean and elegant.  I love the two candles in the communal table.  One important thing to know about this place is they GROW their OWN HERBS. All the herbs they use are fresh.  Absolutely love it and the flavors come out in the dishes.  Hats off to the chef.  He came to out table and chatted with us and actually spent a lot of time with us.  He was very receptive of my critiques.  He is a very meticulous chef.  I saw how he plated his food and it was with surgical precision.  I don't remember all the places he trained at but he did train in France.  Therefore, I would call this place Southern French fusion.  The chef is still working on expanding the menu and this place will have a brunch menu soon.  We also got to speak with the owner of the restaurant.  He was very friendly, pleasant, and down to earth.  He is also the owner of Negril, the caribbean cuisine in Manhattan.  I highly recommend this place.  I would definitely come back again.  The amount of food you get for the price is absolutely a steal!!  I will definitely be organizing my next foodie event here and they are well aware of it!",4.0
"Went here last night with a few friends. The whole experience was great!  The food was really good.

"I just came from SoCo tonight and I just have one word... SUCKS!!!!!!! On top of waiting 45 minutes to be even be seated... though there were plenty of empty tables, the food was horrible. The macaroni that looks so good coming out.. NO BUENO. It looks way better than it tastes. The baby back ribs... I don't think so, and don't let me get started on the wings. Maybe it was what I got that tasted nasty but all I know is I won't be making the trip down to 509 Myrtle Ave any time soon. Other than that.. the atmosphere was cool.",1.0
"SoCo has some great things going on. The overall vibe is very welcoming and the decor creates an inviting atmosphere. Love the back covered patio. The food and drinks were delicious and clearly prepared with care. While the service was friendly, it was very slow from the moment we sat down to the moment we received the bill. I think this is largely due to the fact that the gratuity is built in for parties larger than two. We were very put off by this, as we do tip well if the level of service warrants it. Here, there is no incentive for a server to provide excellent service because they know the 18% or 20% will automatically be added on. In addition to that, there is an additional tip option added, which seems like one could easily not realize the gratuity has already been added and accidentally tip twice. Generally, just not a cool feeling to have as a customer.",3.0
"One of the best meals I've had in a while.  Everything from the service to the drinks, and especially the food was fantastic.BBQ Shrimp Gumbo - I was in New Orleans a month ago, and SoCo's version of the shrimp gumbo was what I had wished the gumbo in NOLA would have tasted like.  Most of the gumbo I had tried in NOLA was too salty, thick, and heavy, but SoCo's BBQ Shrimp Gumbo was super flavorful without being too heavy, and the corn provided a pleasant pop of just enough sweet for eat bite of gumbo.Fried Chicken w/ Red Velvet Waffles - This was the dish that first attracted me to SoCo.  Being from LA, I have a place in my heart for Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles, and was excited to try this dish.  It was good, but I actually preferred regular waffles to the sweetness of the red velvet waffles.  It also comes with a bourbon infused syrup, which you'd probably enjoy if you like the flavor of whiskey, but I ended up asking for regular syrup.Pecan Crusted Pork Chop w/ mashed sweet potatoes and collard greens - The unexpected star dish of the night!  The portions are generous, and it was just SO good and flavorful.  It kinda reminded me of what a gourmet shake and bake pork chop should taste like, but better.  I didn't care for the mashed sweet potatoes though, and wished it had been served with regular mashed potatoes.  I like sweet potato fries, but I guess mashed sweet potatoes just weren't my thing.  And you can't really go wrong with sauteed collard greens...finished mine right up.Mac and cheese - Served in a skilled, with a slight crunchy crust on top...yum!Beignet w/ a Dulce de Leche and Citrus glaze sauce - I remember trying a similar dessert at Emeril's restaurant in NOLA, and although I'm not a donut person, this dessert was really good.  I didn't like the citrus glaze sauce at all, but I must have licked up every bit of the dulce de leche sauce.  If only they could also serve it with a chocolate dipping sauce...that would be awesome.Red Lemonade - Tastes like a cosmo, but served with muddled cranberries instead of just with cranberry juice.  It was nice.Guava Vodka? - Can't remember the actual name of this cocktail, but it was the one with vodka and guava juice...SO good if you like sweet cocktails, and it's not everyday that you find guava juice on a cocktail menu, so you might as well take advantage of that :)What makes this place a solid 5-star restaurant for me was the amazing service.  Everyone from the hostess to the server, and even the busboys were incredibly helpful and friendly.  I just hope the level of service doesn't deteriorate as this place becomes an establishment in the neighborhood.  They say that they're constantly experimenting with the menu items, so I can't wait to come back to try some new dishes!",5.0

"This place is awesome. Right in the heart of Brooklyn. I'm not going to lie. The wait is super LONG without a reservation. I waited about an hour & a half to almost two hours to be seated and I almost felt like people who came after my group were seated before but they could have had a reservation.Either way this place is hip & a neighborhood hot spot. Attractive people. Great bartenders who serve really good drinks. Food was fantastic. Try the Shrimp and Lobster with the cheesy grits. To die for! I also had the skirt steak there. It was pretty good. Great for dates, hanging out for drinks, or with a large group of friends. I will definitely go back soon. Check Soco out but seriously make a reservation way in advance. Its always packed!",4.0
"I really think this place is 3 1/2 stars but I couldn't give it a half star rating.---Just had dinner at Soco and everything was really good.  The restaurant's interior is really nice.  Clean and bright with high ceilings.  The staff was very attentive and our server was extremely friendly.  Started with the Caesar Salad with Kale and cornbread croutons which was eh.  ($7)  I thought the salad was a little under dressed and I wasn't sure what the Kale was bringing to the party.  I guess they added it to make it ""fusion""?  Otherwise it would be just an ordinary salad?  I dunno.  The cornbread croutons I thought were a little on the sweet side for this salad as well but it was an interesting contrast.Had the Fried Chicken with the Red Velvet Waffle.  ($16) The fried chicken was good.

We ordered a separate serving of wings, split the mac and cheese (should've gotten my own), and I had the sliders with fries. I can honestly say that when those wings arrived we were half way through the wings and then noticed we were not talking to each other. The chicken fell off the bone and into my mouth, but the tzatziki sauce it came with was eh.

"Came here on a Saturday night, which wasn't the greatest idea. It was jam packed and super loud, which is to be expected from a popular restaurant like this. I ordered the famous chicken and red velvet waffles, which turned out to be only mediocre due to the fact that my waffle was first undercooked and then overcooked when it was made again. The chicken was phenomenal though. And my mom's burger was good too. Overall the food didn't blow me out of the park, except for that blueberry cheese cake (mouth-watering). However, the main reason why I give this place five stars is because the hospitality was fantastic! Even though it was super busy and rather hectic the staff managed to maintain their smiles and friendly gestures, especially our waiter, who was probably waiting 10 tables at once. I also love the fact that they offer to get people, who are waiting to be seated drinks. In the end I'd definitely go back, but probably not on the weekend.",5.0

"Soco should really be called Soso:Soco reminds me of Peaches...good concept, but failed execution. However, I would say that Soco might be the better of the two. Hmm, let's see the best thing my bf and I had was the mussel appetizer (such a flavorful sauce). Nonetheless, we figured out the recipe and will commence making a better version at home. What else? Oh! His dreadful short ribs...let's say the meat had noo flavor and the plating looked terrible. My chicken and waffles were better than his food, but the chicken was not very flavorful either, but it was moist. Cornbread? Dry and we spit it out idk why it was do nasty ugh. The cocktails (he had some blueberry bourbon thing- um...i liked it more than he did), the sangria was watery in minutes because of the ice overload. The mardi gras drink was warm thick cinnamony syrup; however, i think ice would have done it justice. The seating? I HATE it. It truly has a sports bar vibe, but then u go in the ""garden"" and it's weird bistro/cafe vibe. Bad designers, soso chef and soso bartender. Oh and our waitress crystal or alise or someone (pretty white girl with a huge behind and thick body) well she sucked all night...the other busyboys and waitresses were nice, but she was really rushed and rude. *sigh, I will NOT return*My review doesn't match up to the 3 stars?

We also had the macaroni and cheese, which I am considering a must-have when you go there! The service was a bit slow, but that didn't even bother me! I will be coming here and again",4.0
"How do I say this without sounding corny? Aww hell I'll just say it. Those F-Que wings gave me life. I went for brunch on Sunday with a friend and I can honestly say I need to return so I can try more items on the menu. We ordered a separate serving of wings, split the mac and cheese (should've gotten my own), and I had the sliders with fries. I can honestly say that when those wings arrived we were half way through the wings and then noticed we were not talking to each other. The chicken fell off the bone and into my mouth, but the tzatziki sauce it came with was eh. I wish I took a picture of my meal, but somehow it seemed to have disappeared within moments of it landing on my table. Very strange....I'll have to see if this happens again when I go back to try the red velvet waffles and chicken.",4.0
"My boyfriend and I waited here for over an hour and he kept grumbling the whole time, but I was determined to stay! I barely get a chance to go out to Brooklyn so I was happy to be there. The music and vibe felt right and so I didn't mind waiting at the bar, nursing my incredible drink - Mardi Gras.I had the chicken and red velvet waffles and I liked it, but didn't love it. The waffles were amazing but I've had better fried chicken. We also had the infamous mac&cheese and while it was good, again I've had better.I enjoyed my experience but it is definitely overrated. I only give it 4 stars cause my cocktail was so darn good.",4.0
"Came here on a Saturday night, which wasn't the greatest idea. It was jam packed and super loud, which is to be expected from a popular restaurant like this. I ordered the famous chicken and red velvet waffles, which turned out to be only mediocre due to the fact that my waffle was first undercooked and then overcooked when it was made again. The chicken was phenomenal though. And my mom's burger was good too. Overall the food didn't blow me out of the park, except for that blueberry cheese cake (mouth-watering). However, the main reason why I give this place five stars is because the hospitality was fantastic! Even though it was super busy and rather hectic the staff managed to maintain their smiles and friendly gestures, especially our waiter, who was probably waiting 10 tables at once. I also love the fact that they offer to get people, who are waiting to be seated drinks. In the end I'd definitely go back, but probably not on the weekend.",5.0
"We went on a Thursday night at around 6pm. The place was quiet but soon became packed. The food was AmAZIng!! Had the short ribs, mashed potatoes, chicken and red velvet waffles, mac and cheese, champagne, coffee, and chocolate brownie. I love this place and recommend it to anyone who loves comfort, southern, creole, and good food period!!! I can't wait to go back.",5.0
"Wasn't that great. Very underwhelming. Ordered the red velvet waffles and chicken. Small amount of chicken,  dark meat which I don't eat. My girlfriend ordered the sausage and grits which was tasty and delicious. Been here quite a few times and this was the most disappointing. And the server wasn't that great either.",2.0
"I like the idea of this place but it just wasn't hitting enough for my taste. First off, my wall came out kind of cold and with no butter! Blasphemy! Had to send it back for a slightly warmer waffle and they brought cold, hard butter. I feel like a red velvet waffle should be more decadent. It' was just meh for me. Chicken was okay. I think the space is cute, though. I think chicken n waffles I've had elsewhere have just  spoiled me.",3.0
"Soco should really be called Soso:Soco reminds me of Peaches...good concept, but failed execution. However, I would say that Soco might be the better of the two. Hmm, let's see the best thing my bf and I had was the mussel appetizer (such a flavorful sauce). Nonetheless, we figured out the recipe and will commence making a better version at home. What else? Oh! His dreadful short ribs...let's say the meat had noo flavor and the plating looked terrible. My chicken and waffles were better than his food, but the chicken was not very flavorful either, but it was moist. Cornbread? Dry and we spit it out idk why it was do nasty ugh. The cocktails (he had some blueberry bourbon thing- um...i liked it more than he did), the sangria was watery in minutes because of the ice overload. The mardi gras drink was warm thick cinnamony syrup; however, i think ice would have done it justice. The seating? I HATE it. It truly has a sports bar vibe, but then u go in the ""garden"" and it's weird bistro/cafe vibe. Bad designers, soso chef and soso bartender. Oh and our waitress crystal or alise or someone (pretty white girl with a huge behind and thick body) well she sucked all night...the other busyboys and waitresses were nice, but she was really rushed and rude. *sigh, I will NOT return*My review doesn't match up to the 3 stars? The host, the mussels' cream sauce and the mardi gras really saved it from a 2.",3.0

Soco is a great restaurant and a hot spot in Brooklyn. I was very disappointed with the extremely long wait time. My party and I missed the brunch time before 3:30PM by 10 mins and had to until 5:46 PM to be seated -__-. Expectations were set high so I waited patently because of the reviews and the place was packed so i figured it would be great. My waitress was very nice and informative about the menu. I ordered the red velvet waffles with fried chicken. The presentation was okay but i guess they've gotten lazy overtime because i didn't get my strawberries. Also the waffle was very good but the chicken was very bland and regular. Thats why I give soco 3 stars but the live violin was pretty cool 2. I would def recommened Soco but i just think its highly overrated. Its not good but yet its not bad.,3.0

Read on if I peaked your interest:We were here for my birthday dinner on 11/9. We were a party of 11. My reservations were for 8 pm where we had to wait to be seated about 10-15 minutes or so.. No biggie, it's a Saturday and its packed. While I stood up to waive over someone who was late to our table and walked by the front, a manager approached me and asked that a member of my party remove his winter hat (not a baseball hat or a du-rag, or even a cowboy hat, but a winter hat) and that a customer complained about his boxer shorts peeking out of his pants. You could imagine my surprise, as we were celebrating my birthday, all of us dressed up.. Of course you could see his boxer short if he was sitting down! SOMETIMES YOU CAN SEE A WOMAN'S THONG WHEN SHE SITS DOWN AS WELL, DO WE TELL HER SOMETHING? I immediately told the manager that it was inappropriate for him to even point that out and say that a ""customer"" complained. Before I could make my way to my table SECURITY came to the table and asked him to remove his hat and god knows what else. We probably were seated for about 10 minutes. STRIKE ONE! One of my girlfriends ordered a drink and it was just horrrrrrible. So we spoke to our server who said that she would need to speak to management. A manager (not the one from earlier) approached and advised her that she could not get a new drink because that drink is a specialty and they do not take drinks back that are specialties. She said she could give her something to fix the drink. You could imagine my surprise that management would not return a drink for another one to make their customers happy. As well as a policy not to return drinks.. I guess drinks werent that great to begin with! She returned with a Sprite and simple syrup. STRIKE TWO! 40 minutes into the dinner. We asked the server about our food. She came back and said they were still working on it. We must have been seated there for more than an hour without our meals. Meanwhile, a party who arrived after us, who was a party of 8-9, had already received their meals. WTF?! Ok now its getting serious! STRIKE THREE!We asked to speak to management again, due to all the issues we have had and we haven't even received our food yet after ordering an hour ago!!!  The manager who initially approached me about the hat came over and my best friend spoke to him. He advised the manager of how we were being treated, starting with the hat incident (their were others seated in the restaurant with hats on), the drinks, the hour wait for food (where he claims they were a smaller party)... Well does that mean the whole restaurant eats before our table even though they got in after us? My best friend was so disgusted he sent his food back. STRIKE FOUR!While we weren't even finished with our food, they started to clear our table.. STRIKE FIVE! And we finally had it and screamed and had a fit. SOCO gets one star for the food! The food was excellent.. But the management is inappropriate, rude, targeted our group for no reason for what I could see (except that winter hat), and because they RUINED my birthday. My best friends all have come here and have RAVED about the food and the environment and have all suggested this place.. But once we were treated this way, ,we wont go back and will make sure to let all of our friends and industry friends and anyone else know how we were treated. Shame on you SOCO.",1.0
"if you are making reservations stress to your guest that they won't seat you until your whole party arrives. I made 8 reservations and told my guest we were meeting at 730. Being that everyone was running on CP time we didn't get seated until 11:45... on my birthday. Food is great though, and the drinks are super strong, well worth the price. pricing is similar to red lobster, but the food is way better. The waitress Clarissa was great and the music is amazing, they played my favorite song. Over all a wonderful experience except that it is way too small to be so popular.",4.0
Roommate and I started with the F-wye wings. They were ok. I wouldn't get them again. I got the fried chicken and red velvet waffles which were delish! My roomie got the lobster shrimp and grits and it was great. Collards were good. Sweet but good. Fried chicken had a kick to it that I liked.,4.0
"My fam and I came to this place on the 25th for my birthday dinner. We arrived early and was seated right away. The decor was lovely, wished it was a little brighter to read the menu but that was the only issue. Our waiter, Robert was attentive and very accommodating. We didn't have a long wait for the food considering we all ordered something different. My pecan crusted pork chops, mashed sweet potatoes and collard greens were so yummy, my mom enjoyed her red velvet waffles and buttermilk fried chicken and my fussy old school stepfather was raving about his jambalaya. Cannot wait to come back for brunch in the near future. Feel really taken care of in here, don't hesitate to try SoCo. :)",5.0
"i came here for brunch on saturday around 2:45pm without a reservation and was seated at 3pm. Very excited to try the menu so I did not mind the wait. i had the chicken and red velvet waffles. looking over other diners plates, it definitely seemed to be the popular favorite. i loved it! i also had two alcohol concotions- 1 was strawberry moonshine and the other was a cucumber gin. delicious, refreshing, and strong! i enjoy a good libation. it is my goal to keep coming back and trying everything on the menus",5.0
"I almost never leave a 5 star review because almost no place is definitely good enough for five stars.  The service, menu and ambiance all get five stars from me.  The drinks are creative and food is so good it leaves you wanting to keep coming back so you can conquer everything on the menu.  I loved the Mac n cheese ,fried chicken with a red waffle and the jambalaya rice.    I will definitely keep coming back for more.",5.0
"Checked out SoCo with my sister today during lunch. We got the chicken and waffles and the BBQ pulled pork sandwich with fries. The fries were crispy and had the right amount of seasoning. The chicken was flavorful and the waffle was amazing. The sandwich was meh, nothing to comment about. Some of the staff were friendly. Everything was going ok until the check arrived. They charged us $6 for tap water. It caught us a bit off guard because if we had known this prior to coming here, we would have picked up couple bottles of water from a nearby deli and that would've only cost us couple of bucks.  Anyways, we will not be returning.",3.0
"I've visited this place twice and every time they've provided great service and great food. They have the best lobster and grits. I would recommend that you try the lobster and grits or the sausage ,grits, and eggs plate. Add a glass of their Mardi Gras drink and you're one step closer to heaven!",4.0
"Great atmosphere and good food, one of my hot spots I visit when I'm in brooklyn.  Can't wait to try the Chicken and Waffles now on the menu.",4.0
Soco is a great restaurant and a hot spot in Brooklyn. I was very disappointed with the extremely long wait time. My party and I missed the brunch time before 3:30PM by 10 mins and had to until 5:46 PM to be seated -__-. Expectations were set high so I waited patently because of the reviews and the place was packed so i figured it would be great. My waitress was very nice and informative about the menu. I ordered the red velvet waffles with fried chicken. The presentation was okay but i guess they've gotten lazy overtime because i didn't get my strawberries. Also the waffle was very good but the chicken was very bland and regular. Thats why I give soco 3 stars but the live violin was pretty cool 2. I would def recommened Soco but i just think its highly overrated. Its not good but yet its not bad.,3.0

"I went to SoCo last week with my girlfriend and friend for brunch. I must say...the food was amazing. My friend and I had the pecan crusted pork chops with the yams & dollars greens. My girlfriend had the lobster tail, shrimp with grits. We called the grits international grits because we didn't want to compare it to our grandmother's. It was so freaking good. Now we have it 4 stars because our side order of MacnCheese was alright.But overall our experience was great...Ari was a great bartender. Soooooooo Needless to say, we will be back soon",4.0
I bought someone here for brunch!!! Our first time together. Unlimited mimosas (loved it). I had the salmon with whole green beans & yams along w. a side of Mac & cheese. The salmon was just right & the Mac & cheese was delicious as well cheesy but the yams were horrible (tasted straight out of the can. I couldn't think of a way to save them in order to eat them) & green beans coulda of been sautéed better. He had the red velvet waffles & fried chicken. He loved his meal & wasted no time digging in. We were both alittle disturbed with the water which we felt tasted like toilet water but the bottles in which they serve it is cute. He disliked the lemonade. The service was great & the establishment is very nice along with welcoming. I would recommend this place & I plan on going back for dinner!!!,3.0
"I've been here twice and have had two completely different experiences. The first time I came it was great. I left here a believer after having had the the lobster shrimp and grits, mussels, and wings.  The second time my service and food were an absolute complete mess. I ordered the grits but a piece of plastic made it into my dish somehow [gross]. However, they handled the situation well, and I ordered sweet potato pancakes as my replacement. But then that dish was accidentally given to another customer. So I ordered the shrimp salad instead because now I'm starving and losing my patience. They gave me some sweet cornbread on the house to pass the time while I waited for my food. I get the salad and it just looked sad and unappetizing. The shrimp was covered in BBQ sauce which wasn't stated on the menu. Needless to say, I left completely underwhelmed. Management was very accommodating and I didn't get charged for anything because of all the screw up. My waiter was also very attentive throughout the whole ordeal and you could just tell that it just THAT kind of day. Despite the horrid second experience, I'll be back.

The food is delicious however the service is poor. We waited a long time before a waiter came to the table. When it was time to pay for the food the wait was even longer after we provided the waiter with our cards. Apparently the waiter was waiting for the manager to reverse the charges because he charged the amounts on the wrong cards. The reason for the long wait was because the same thing happened to a different table and the people at the table was very upset so he was trying to resolve the issue. After he resolved that issue the waiter asked him to correct the charges and so we waited again until we decided to go and see what's going on. The manager and waiter passed us standing waiting on them and didn't even acknowledge us to let us know what's going on. When I started to get upset instead of him apologizing he was being defensive. The owner needed to change the management of this restaurant because there's no way I'll be going back here based on this horrible service.  We finished eating around 9pm and did not leave there until after 10pm. That's how long we had to wait to get the bill resolved. Crazy!!!!!!!!,1.0
"People don't come to this place for the food, they come for the beautiful people.My God-the people who frequent this place are absolutely gorgeous. The food is pretty awesome as well.

"My expectations were held up. Heard of this place from a few friends who raved about the chicken and waffle's. I had the short rib and mash, my date had the waffles and chicken. FOOD WAS GREAT. I felt like a family member was in the kitchen (which is SEVERELY important when you come from a southern family and your dining at a soul food spot).No reservations yet we were seated immediately (on a week night about 6/7 pm)The only reason for 4 stars oppose to 5 stars, our personal waiter wasn't as attentive as I would have liked.

"I went to SoCo last week with my girlfriend and friend for brunch. I must say...the food was amazing. My friend and I had the pecan crusted pork chops with the yams & dollars greens. My girlfriend had the lobster tail, shrimp with grits. We called the grits international grits because we didn't want to compare it to our grandmother's. It was so freaking good. Now we have it 4 stars because our side order of MacnCheese was alright.But overall our experience was great...Ari was a great bartender. Soooooooo Needless to say, we will be back soon",4.0
I bought someone here for brunch!!! Our first time together. Unlimited mimosas (loved it). I had the salmon with whole green beans & yams along w. a side of Mac & cheese. The salmon was just right & the Mac & cheese was delicious as well cheesy but the yams were horrible (tasted straight out of the can. I couldn't think of a way to save them in order to eat them) & green beans coulda of been sautéed better. He had the red velvet waffles & fried chicken. He loved his meal & wasted no time digging in. We were both alittle disturbed with the water which we felt tasted like toilet water but the bottles in which they serve it is cute. He disliked the lemonade. The service was great & the establishment is very nice along with welcoming. I would recommend this place & I plan on going back for dinner!!!,3.0
"I've been here twice and have had two completely different experiences. The first time I came it was great. I left here a believer after having had the the lobster shrimp and grits, mussels, and wings.  The second time my service and food were an absolute complete mess. I ordered the grits but a piece of plastic made it into my dish somehow [gross]. However, they handled the situation well, and I ordered sweet potato pancakes as my replacement. But then that dish was accidentally given to another customer. So I ordered the shrimp salad instead because now I'm starving and losing my patience. They gave me some sweet cornbread on the house to pass the time while I waited for my food. I get the salad and it just looked sad and unappetizing. The shrimp was covered in BBQ sauce which wasn't stated on the menu. Needless to say, I left completely underwhelmed. Management was very accommodating and I didn't get charged for anything because of all the screw up. My waiter was also very attentive throughout the whole ordeal and you could just tell that it just THAT kind of day. Despite the horrid second experience, I'll be back. They say the third time is a charm and it will hopefully be similar to my first time there.",3.0

I love SoCo. Today was my first time having it and I finally found a new soul food restaurant that really is tasty. I was told every thing was good here and that was no lie. I started with the gumbo which was really tasty with a great broth and tasty sausage. My mother had the mussels which were AMAZING cream broth and was cooked to perfection. For entrees we both had the chicken with the red velvet waffle. The waffle was perfectly sweet and the chicken was okay hence one lower star. The service was great and the decor was on point. SoCo is really a great choice and I'm coming back.,4.0

"Nice atmosphere, went last Saturday and it was packed with beautiful people! The bar tenders were attentive and friendly (had to wait at the bar because the reservation I booked through Open Table,  the hostess said she knew nothing about and was a little snippy when I brought it up), the hostess  leaves something to be desired, however the  wait staff  were excellent, very attentive and helpful. I had their Sangria, which is a different take on white wine Sangria, but it was delicious! For my entree I tried the Buttermilk Fried Chicken with the red velvet waffle.

We were pleasantly greeted by our waiter which offered us bottled water (6 dollars).  We pondered over the menus and wanted to order all the popular items.  Red velvet waffles and organic chicken, skirt steak, mac and cheese, Carolina rolls, apple cobbler, sweet potato pie and we had sangria's for drinks...Everything was presented so well..And came out extremely fast.  The Carolina rolls were Delicious!! Made with short rib and sushi inspired!! The Skirt steak had a sauce on it that was so good!! Have no idea what it was..but it was great!!I look forward to visiting again.

"Came for Sunday brunch with the chicken and waffles in mind,  thanks to previous Yelp reviews. The bf and I waited about 20 min. at the bar before we were alerted via a nifty text messaging service used by the host on his iPad mini that our table was ready. I thought I'd try a cocktail other than my typical mimosa to go with my brunch,  so I tried the red lemonade on the basis of our server's recommendations (along with a few other drinks she mentioned as ""stand outs""). The drink didn't wow me...there was a good amount of vodka but not enough lemonade to balance the flavor. Needless to say, I wish I had stuck with my mimosa. We both ordered the buttermilk chicken with red velvet waffles.  The waffles were just the right consistency (soft and fluffy) with enough hint of red velvet flavoring...the syrup complemented these flavors well.  The chicken tasted fresh and well seasoned.  I wish the skin was a bit crispier.  I also wish establishments that offer chicken & waffles on their menus would use white meat only.  While we're on the subject, it baffles me why a restaurant would serve bone-in chicken with waffles.  As a patron, I want to be able to cut my waffle and meat in similar portions and have them both on the same bite I take from my fork...a chicken bone makes this difficult to do. Aside from those gripes, the hosts and our server were pleasant.  We enjoyed the overall vibe of this spot.",3.0
"First things first, not receiving good service puts a damper on the entire meal and the mood at the table. I was not overly impressed with any of the meals that came out. The fried chicken with red velvet waffles, were not hot and maybe it's me, but it's hard for me to wrap my mind around expensive fried chicken. There is nothing you can do to make fried chicken an expensive meal, not even drop it next to a red velvet waffle. Sorry. I may be a bit biased, being from the south. I think all the sides were pretty good though. The Red beans and rice and the mac and cheese were the redeeming factors on our plates.On a positive note, the place was really cute.

"My friends recently took me to this restaurant on Saturday to celebrate my birthday. I had the Blackened Salmon with Sauteed Garlic String Beans and topped with a mango salsa. The salmon was good.

My other friends went for the Chicken & Red Velvet Waffles. One friend said the waffles tasted like red velvet and the other said they tasted like regular waffles with some red dye. I can't speak for either one because I didn't try it. Everyone seemed to like the Mac & Cheese, but since I don't do dairy, I didn't taste that either. Overall, the food was good. My only complaint was the noise. It was literally like eating inside of a club. You had to literally scream at the person sitting next to you so, since I enjoy the company of my friends and a good conversation, I was disappointed that I couldn't enjoy that.

"HORRIBLE SERVICE! Made reservations for my mom's 44th Birthday for 6pm on Sunday. My family and I actually got there early at 5:45pm hoping to be seated asap, initiating that the table would be ready on time. To our surprise, there were no tables available at 6pm and the hostess stated that the wait will be 20-30 min. So we decided to wait hoping that a table will become available by the end of the wait time. At 30 min we noticed the hostess did not approach us saying anything and she did not intend to. I asked how long the wait will be and she looked at me dumbfounded and stated that ""there was a party of 30 (o_O) and they are not getting up!"" At this point I was upset, disappointed and wished I chose a another restaurant.

"These folks do so much really well. The atmosphere and service is highly impressive. The menu is smart, yet down to earth. The food is good. Gumbo was delicious and presented very nicely. The f-que wings are perfectly smothered with a sweet chili sauce and served with tzatziki, which works incredibly well. Ok, so the pork chops were a bit overcooked for me, but they came with a heap of sweet potato mash, which made up for it. The chicken and red velvet waffle dish was good. It looks really amazing actually; the color contrast makes it pop visually. I think the waffle can be improved. It wasnt bad at all, it was just a bit generic; almost as if they used a boxed red velvet cake mix and poured it into a waffle iron. I doubt thats what theyre doing, but they can definitely make it pop more flavor-wise. Finally, the watermelon margarita was so good that I, the manly man that I am, did not mind being seen sipping on a lovely pink drink. It's a little on the sweet side, but has a good kick.",4.0
"I went to SoCo thye eve of Fourth of July. I had heard a lot about it so wanted to try it out. Honestly, I would give the food a 3 and the ambiance/decor a 5. The food was just okay to me, I had the salmon and cornbread and mac and cheese, my bf got the okra as an appetizer and the lobster and shrimp grits. Everything was just okay, not spectacular, in addition, it took almost an hour for us to get our food and we did have reservations. It was very cold in there as well(the people next to us were also complaning). I would probably go in there and go to the bar and order the drinks. It really is a beautiful restaurant.",4.0

"HORRIBLE SERVICE! Made reservations for my mom's 44th Birthday for 6pm on Sunday. My family and I actually got there early at 5:45pm hoping to be seated asap, initiating that the table would be ready on time. To our surprise, there were no tables available at 6pm and the hostess stated that the wait will be 20-30 min. So we decided to wait hoping that a table will become available by the end of the wait time. At 30 min we noticed the hostess did not approach us saying anything and she did not intend to. I asked how long the wait will be and she looked at me dumbfounded and stated that ""there was a party of 30 (o_O) and they are not getting up!"" At this point I was upset, disappointed and wished I chose a another restaurant. We continued my mom's celebration at another restaurant in the area and had fun in the limo for the rest of the evening.

"There are those people out there who like things like a veggie frittata for brunch. I call those people fools. All the smart people like to get some yummy, decadent, ""I don't need to eat anything till dinner"" food - and I count myself as one of them. We were visiting some friends in Brooklyn and were actually told to check out SoCo by our Uber driver - so... 1 point for Ubers! We arrived at 12:00pm on a Saturday and the place was basically empty, so we were really lucky to get a seat in their little patio area in the back. We were quickly brought water and Bloody Mary's (duh) and it turns out that they have bottomless Mimosas till 1:00pm. I think you can probably guess where the rest of my morning went... Bob and I shared the sausage and grits and the red velvet waffle with fried chicken. Now, I am not usually someone who goes for these over the top waffle concoctions, but I do LOVE fried chicken and waffles - so what the heck! Bob's sausage and grits were phenomenal! The grits were nice and smooth and creamy, and the sausage was nice and spicy - the whole thing was done really well and it was very tasty. The chicken and waffle was spectacular! The chicken was seasoned well and was nice and crispy, and the red velvet waffle was almost a little cakey and had a nice yeasty flavor that wasn't too sweet so it went really well with the salty spicy chicken. Let's just say that I cleaned my entire plate, happily! The service was fabulous, the ambiance lovely and the food fantastic! What else can you really ask for in a brunch destination?

"Today is my sisters birthday, and she told me she's been dying to try SoCo. I heard a lot of raving reviews and the thought of Buttermilk Chicken and Red Velvet Waffles was very intriguing. As usual, I checked the Health Department website and Yelp and saw all these raving reviews. It was a Go! My sister and I were seated and ordered our drinks. She ordered something with passion fruit and I ordered Jack Daniels Honey Tennesee. 10 minutes later, the waitress told me they didn't have it so I ordered a French Q 75 and we ordered our appetizers. We got our appetizers, my sister got her drink and the same waitress asked if I wanted a drink. I told her that she already took my drink order, but I had to put it in again. The appetizers were really great! We got the Mac and Cheese, ribs and wings. We were licking our fingers. Then I got my drink and it was great! We figured if the drinks and appetizers were this good, the entrees would be great! Sadly we were wrong.I got my chicken and waffles and my sister got the blackened salmon. The chicken tasted good but wasn't crispy at all. The waffle had good flavor but was a little soft and gummy. My sister said the salmon was okay but needed a little salt or some flavor. After all the rave reviews, it was a bit disappointing. Also, after I ordered my second drink, the exact same one, the waitress passed by three different times to tell me it was coming and once to ask what it was again. The desserts saved the day! The chocolate tart was delicious. The only thing that sucked during dessert was the sight of the Jack Honey Tennessee that I asked for and the waitress said they didn't have.

"Thank you Alex for giving me the best restaurant experience I've had in a while.  Your voice and your service was over the top and made me enjoy my food even more.It was still lunchtime when we went, so the restaurant was nice and empty.  SoCo itself is beautiful, so I can only imagine what the dinner ambiance is like.  Let me start with appetizers, if I may.  I adore mussels on its own in a nice sauce, but I heart mussels with andouille sausage and a nice sauce.  The mac and cheese (sorry, we couldn't wait for entrees to try it) was delicioso.  This is no Kraft mac and cheese, my friends.  I'm talking cavatappi pasta baked with cheese and panko bread crumbs.  Ponder on that while I discuss entrees.I am a food swap kinda girl by nature, so I ordered salmon topped with a pineapple salsa, asparagus, roasted plaintain and my all time fave, stone ground mustard.  My Best Foodie Friend had the chicken and red velvet waffles.

"SoCo is the truth! I had the opportunity to go for the first time back in Sept '11. I heard such rave reviews, so me and my girl went on a weekday for a birthday dinner.

For me, the chicken could have been more flavorful, but the waffle was delish! A+ for introducing me to a new fusion food. I took the mac +cheese home since I was stuffed...and it tasted amazing the next day. Fast forward to December '11 - I went back on a Saturday night around 11ish with my boyfriend. The place was packed... and the place is enormous. I guess word got out & SoCo is the new hot spot in Brooklyn. I decided to go with the butternut, pumpkin ravioli (which was pretty good).

I couldn't eat it all because the portion was pretty big but I tried the best I could! lolThe atmosphere was really nice...very cool, trendy, laid back vibe. Everyone was really nice and accommodating EXCEPT for the hostess she was a SNOOOOBBBBB!!! I complimented her dress and i didn't even get a smile in return...ummmmm ok! Normally women hate on other women and GOD FORBID you look cute...BUT I am secure with myself and have no issue saying if someone looks cute! She obviously wasnt use to be complimented by a woman! Anyhow, when it was our turn to be seated after waiting 45mins she sat us at a table right in front of the kitchen door (worst table to have in this place)...it was constant traffic, people hitting my shoulder every 2 mins, ppl rushing past with food...I was super annoyed because other tables were open and didnt understand why we got the shit table so I asked to be moved and she said sorry, those are for reservations so i said fine. THEN i see her stupid ass sit people who came in 5 mins after us (meaning they waited 40mins) at one of those tables SO OBVIOUSLY they were NOT reservations. We asked someone else and the bartender came over and told her to move us...HA!! so we got seated near the back..MUCH BETTER!

"I loved the ambience at SoCo..dimly lit lights, candles on the table...so far so good. On to the food. We started with the wings, well actually my bf did...he said they were ok. I had the mussels...DELICIOUS! We shared a ceasar salad..it was...um....different. I like Kale (in my green juice) not my ceasar salad, other than  that is was good.

"Today is my sisters birthday, and she told me she's been dying to try SoCo. I heard a lot of raving reviews and the thought of Buttermilk Chicken and Red Velvet Waffles was very intriguing. As usual, I checked the Health Department website and Yelp and saw all these raving reviews. It was a Go! My sister and I were seated and ordered our drinks. She ordered something with passion fruit and I ordered Jack Daniels Honey Tennesee. 10 minutes later, the waitress told me they didn't have it so I ordered a French Q 75 and we ordered our appetizers. We got our appetizers, my sister got her drink and the same waitress asked if I wanted a drink. I told her that she already took my drink order, but I had to put it in again. The appetizers were really great! We got the Mac and Cheese, ribs and wings. We were licking our fingers. Then I got my drink and it was great! We figured if the drinks and appetizers were this good, the entrees would be great! Sadly we were wrong.I got my chicken and waffles and my sister got the blackened salmon. The chicken tasted good but wasn't crispy at all. The waffle had good flavor but was a little soft and gummy. My sister said the salmon was okay but needed a little salt or some flavor. After all the rave reviews, it was a bit disappointing. Also, after I ordered my second drink, the exact same one, the waitress passed by three different times to tell me it was coming and once to ask what it was again. The desserts saved the day! The chocolate tart was delicious. The only thing that sucked during dessert was the sight of the Jack Honey Tennessee that I asked for and the waitress said they didn't have. To sum it up, drinks, appetizers and desserts were great. The entrees and the service were a let down. The chicken and waffles were greatly exaggerated.

If anyone decides to go here I'd advice you to not get an appetizer if you are trying to save money especially if you're there with a group of friends. You will be full when you finish your appetizer and will have to take home barely touched meals plus the gratuity is very high so the more you order the more the gratuity is. Plus if you want to go here for your birthday make sure you have money for the tiny scoop of ice cream and little lava cake and I'm guessing for them to sing you happy birthday for 10 seconds because it's not free.

"This place is solid for sure. I came here last night between about 7pm-11pm, with a friend, and had a nice time despite the fact that SoCo is not really a place I would normally chose to hang out. It's very gentrified/middle class feeling - as my friend said when he asked me where we shoudl go and were deciding between a few places, ""it's kinda fancy."" We had originally met up at Maggie Brown, which I love, if that gives you any idea of my personal taste/aesthetic/atmosphere for comparison  - and then made our way down to SoCo.I had a French Q. 75 (a play on a traditional French 75), and thought that the muddled grapes gave this classic drink a nice, fresh edge. After that, I had a couple of Brooklyn lagers, which speak for themselves, really. My friend had the short ribs and was so impressed with his dish that he gave compliments to the chef personally. I actually thought the prices were a bit high - $28 for short ribs. Just saying. I would have chosen the vegetarian sushi if I had felt like paying $10 for what inevitably would be one sushi roll (not a horrible price, but more than I wanted to spend on a gamble). Our bartender, Tasha, was probably my favourite part of the experience - she was funny, smart, and held her own in a throng of drunken gentlemen patrons. I really dug her. The atmosphere here is nice - it's very middle class as I said. Everyone is like casually dressed up and not acting a fool (well except for the dude sitting next to my friend who must have spilled at least three gin and tonics... but I more mean that no one was yelling or being annoying). It's sort of an older, settled in crowd, I guess. If it seems like I am doing a bad job of explaining this place, I probably am - it wasn't my deal, like I said, but I had a fine time regardless. I'd come back if my friend wanted to hit SoCo up again, but I won't be going alone or taking my other friends or anything. If it says anything, I headed back down Myrtle to Rope after my friend went home.",3.0

Definitely a staple for me! Our server Amy was great and recommended the best options between two dishes I hadn't tried as yet (pecan-crusted pork chops or molasses braised short ribs). She suggested the short ribs and it was so tender you didn't need a knife to cut it. Where they do that at??? Amazeballs!!! Only suggestion, don't make a reservation right after brunch.

"I am at the restaurant now and felt compelled to write a review! The place is very busy which is to be expected on a Friday night! However, when my food as well as my cousin's came over cooked and dry the manager was rude and reluctant to switch out our entrees! We didn't want anything for free and were very polite and apologetic about not liking our food. Our waiter was wonderful but the manager (Craig) ensured we would not be giving this place a second chance anytime soon. Maybe they are better on an off-peak night...",3.0

imitation soul food. unremarkable service. BOMB violin player!!!!!!!!! the manager was nice though.,1.0
Went here a few months ago and the ambiance was very classy and the look of the place is great... The food didn't blow me away but I wasn't disappointed either... Ordered the salmon burger which was very tender and flavorful... The fries could have been better... We couldn't get a table because the wait was just too long so we had to eat -not at the bar- but in the waiting section where there's a counter top. Other than that all my friends pretty much enjoyed their food... I would visit this establishment again to try another dish...,3.0
"The food is always amazing at Soco. I've been to a number Southern style restaurants but they don't hold a torch to Soco. I bought my godmother with me this time and she enjoyed all the food, although the mac and cheese is not like her homemade mac and cheese :-). Either way we both enjoyed our time. Definitely a staple for me! Our server Amy was great and recommended the best options between two dishes I hadn't tried as yet (pecan-crusted pork chops or molasses braised short ribs). She suggested the short ribs and it was so tender you didn't need a knife to cut it. Where they do that at??? Amazeballs!!! Only suggestion, don't make a reservation right after brunch. This might have been the first time, but our reservation got pushed back 30 minutes. Other than the food is fantastic! Always a winner in my book and a staple!",4.0

"I honestly don't know how this restaurant gets such rave reviews.  Me and my girls took a taxi from the Bronx to Brooklyn to try this restaurant after reading all of the glowing reviews on Yelp.  This atmosphere is fantastic and the waiters are courteous and helpful. The bathrooms are clean. But IMO the food is just all right.  Reading the reviews my mouth watered and I couldn't wait to try the pecan encrusted pork chops with sweet potatoes and collards.  Pork chops were just o.k. - thin and kind of dry.  Sweet potatoes were good but then again it's hard to mess up a sweet potato. Collards were good.  My sister had a salmon burger with fries. Fries were excellent; salmon burger was just o.k. My other sister had baked or steamed salmon.  She said it was dry.  Someone else said the macaroni was definitely on point. I had some kind of shrimp spring roll as an appetizer that DID NOT have any shrimp in it!!! The drinks were weak - too much ice, not enough liquor. The first few sips were o.k. and then it was like drinking koolaid.  Not only that, it took about 45 minutes for our food to come.  Maybe I should have had the chicken and waffles that everyone raves about instead",2.0
"We didn'tmake any reservations for Sunday brunch. There were 15 of us. We waitedfor a reasonable time.  It was great! The mac n' cheese was perfect! The hibiscus sweet tea was really refreshing! I ordered the lobster and shrimp grits. It was just okay, but I wouldn't order it again. My niece had the buttermilk fried chicken and the red velvet waffle was absolutely cooked to perfection. The fried chicken was nice, but Amy Ruth's in Harlem has more flavor. The pork chop was also tasty.Place is a bit noisy, but servers are really nice and not sluggish. Very hip place. Will go back just for the red velvet waffles.",4.0
Let me just say- I can't wait to go back!I went on a Sunday night to ensure that it would be slow. I didn't want to deal with a crowd but to be safe i still used open table to make a reservation. The Bf and I came in and were seated immediately. Server came right over and introduced herself. So far so good. We had these smoked bbq wings ( i think thats what they were)..they were delish. I had the Red Velvet Waffle because my sweet tooth is STRONG! It controls me lol. The organic fried chicken was amazing..I loved it and I plan on having the same thing when i go back. Mac and cheese was OKAY. I make better at home. and the grits I will FOREVER pass on lol.But don't get me wrong over all its a real posh place. Lots of hipsters in the area. Real nice location.

"So I few days ago, we woke up to heavy winds and a lot of snow.  My husband and I had a very important appointment in Brooklyn (we live about an hour away from Brooklyn) so we ventured out in the snow to make it there.  Thinking to myself that I have been wanting to try Soco since last year, might as well try it while I'm out there because we weren't sure when we would be able to go back.  We decided to have lunch there.  Thankfully they open up at Noon and we got there about 12:30.  We were greeted very warmly by the host (who I think was really the manager and/or owner).  She showed me around to the back as I noticed they had outside seating.  We chatted a bit and I told her that we were Westchester County and her response was one of shock, ""On a day like today?"" Yes I told her but we didnt have a choice.The waitress came over, greeted us and took our order.  I ordered the red velvet waffle and chicken of course because that was the main reason for my visit and my husband reluctantly ordered the same thing as he isn't a very big fan of anything red velvet and he also tried the white cheddar grits.   Our order came in a timely manner and we ate.  The chicken was excellent.  Very fresh, very tasty and not overly greasy as fried chicken can get.  The waffle was good and I mean that, it really was but I think i expected more because of all the great things I have heard.  Im not sure if I would order the same thing again but I know I would return the restaurant.  Now I'm sure your wondering why the five stars for just ""good food""?  Well to our surprise our server came out and notified us that she ""Chef"" was preparing a dessert ""on the house"" for us as he was told how far we had traveled and how grateful they were for our visit.  TALK ABOUT EXCELLENT SERVICE ON SO MANY LEVELS.  Listen, I am the picky-est consumer, I critique everything when I try a new restaurant and I have to say that Soco has won me over.  Im not sure if I mentioned this but it is a very clean and open restaurant, a modern feel and very spacious, not something you get from looking from the outside.  The fact that the food was good, maybe more promoted than what it is but all in al good food and to get that type of service was beyond amazing.  The dessert was excellent to say the least.  Very tasty (brownie with toasted marshmallow on top with a scoop of vanilla ice cream drenched in crushed graham crackers and a raspberry cheesecake with big pieces of raspberry in it and on the side.  I recommend this restaurant to everyone!",5.0

Along with this our waitress was very lazy and didn't even bring out our food but the porters that did were very nice. Once our bill came we saw a $30 tip added to the bill. Seeing as how on their site it says parties of 6 or more will be charged mandatory 20%  gratuity we were very surprised. After speaking to our waitress she said that she will talk to the manager who couldn't manage to walk over herself and explain to us that they go by the gratuity rules outlined on their menu, even though it was a slow night.

"Had a reservation for 6 at 3pm and we were running a little late but I called and they said as long as we could make it before 3:30 they could accommodate us (since they have an intermission from 3:30-5) so we were seated and I checked in with yelp so I could get a free order of cornbread. Waiter comes over unsure as to whether we could use this for brunch but then says that we can. Now that im home I just remembered that we never got it. As for food we all got the chicken and waffle. I've had better. The chicken was ok but something was weird with the consistency of the waffle. Also the soco carmel martini was super strong and sweet I wasnt a fan. Also we were sitting in the front and it was very annoying to see people come in and get turned away because the kitchen was closed during intermission and wouldnt open for another hr or so, even a poor pregnant lady got turned away. I just felt like they should have just locked the door but they really did just lose out on a bunch of business. Glad I went because ive heard great things about this place but I wont be back for chicken and waffles. Ill go all the way to amy ruth's in Harlem before I come here.

"This place has a very trendy atmosphere.  I set up a surprise birthday dinner here for my boyfriend this summer.  The guests were seated at a large table in the back and the hostess, who had been told earlier of the plan, played along nicely and said ""oh yes, party of two"" when we arrived.  He didn't realize what was going on until we were literally at the table.  It was classic!!Now for the food: We got a handful of appetizers for the table, collard greens, mac and cheese, grits, etc.. everything was very good.  The BF got the Lobster Shrimp and Grits, which was delicious (I kept grabbing food from his plate, haha).  I had the Pecan Crusted Pork Chop, which was also very tasty (but his food always tastes better than mine.. what's that about?)  Several people at the table got the Red Velvet Chicken and Waffles and said that they enjoyed it but the chicken was a bit too salty.  The Brownie Sundae was a great finish.  The service was professional and quite patient with our medium-sized group.  Overall had a really nice time here!",5.0
"I went here with some friends for dinner earlier this month and it was a great experience!  The food was DELICIOUS - I ordered the ""soul food"" sushi rolls (can't remember the menu name but that's essentially what they are, lol), chicken wings (which are my absolute fav!), and pumpkin donuts for dessert (yum yum!).  The overall atmosphere of the place is nice and gets pretty festive in the evenings.The best part of the experience for me was the customer service.  If you've read my reviews before, you know CS is HUGE for me.  Regrettably I cannot remember our waiter's name, however, he was warm, friendly, and because he forgot to bring a couple of (alcoholic) drinks to the table in a timely fashion, he gave us those drinks on the house once they finally arrived. Simple gesture yet very effective in gaining loyalty from patrons.  Great food, great service... check them out!",5.0

"We went for a Saturday early-afternoon lunch -- I'm sure the SoCo vibe is different at night when the bar/lounge area is more bustling.  But Saturday afternoons are fairly sedate (there were five or six other tables). If I had to summarize my impression of this place it is this: confused. It seems to aspire to be trendy and hip (please see the totally hipster bathroom sink), and yet the decor is sort of blah and uninspired, and the menu is supposed to be down-home and comfort. None of these vibes really go together, and you can really feel that when you're in the restaurant. Speaking of things you can feel in the restaurant: cold.  And then really, really hot. It seems SoCo doesn't have its heating system down, so there would be 15-20 minutes of cold (so cold that most of the diners were wearing jackets, even though we were all sitting far from the door) followed by five minutes of take-your-breath-away dry Arizona desert heat.  There were a few other things that were off -- the food took a remarkably long time (considering that we all ordered sandwiches and there were only a few other tables in the restaurant). We waited about 25 minutes for sandwiches.  The service was virtually invisible despite the empty restaurant (our waiter could best be described as awkward - he seemed better suited for a TGI Fridays or a Cheesecake Factory than for SoCo, and there were just weird service gaps - tea and coffee came without sugar and milk, things like that).  And the invisible service was surprising given that the waiter and some folks from the kitchen and the hosts were just standing around chatting.  It all just felt very make-shift and amateur.After all these gripes, the food was just fine -- the burgers are massive and tasty enough (the fries, though, are soggy and undersalted).  The veggie sandwich was delicious but could have used something to hold it together (perhaps cheese) because everyone knows that if you put a bunch of grilled veggies between two pieces of bread, they're all going to slide out. And that's what happened. The description of the veggie sandwich promised that it was chickpea flavored, but I found not even a hint of the garbanzo.   All of this to say the food was just average.I'd be ok with returning to a just-ok restaurant with barely-ok food in a place with few choices, but in this neighborhood, there are just so many other amazing places that I doubt I'll be back.",3.0
"The ambiance of this place is a cover-up for how average and mediocre the food is here, read on and I will explain......So I like to think of myself as an avid restaurant goer. I eat out at least 6 days a week and because Bed-Stuy/Clinton Hill area is just getting to have a few decent places, I jog over to Myrtle Avenue, where there is a variety of choices for eateries. I have seen this place a few times around the Grand Opening and made a mental note to myself to check it out,especially because the sign outlined that it served Southern Cuisine. Now growing up with my grandmother from North Carolina (although this may sound biased) but she was an excellent cook. We had a home cook meal every night and I daresay that I was never disappointed. However I was in this place. My excitement about this place and the expectations was extremely high. Since my grandma passed I have not had a decent down-south home cooked meal in a while unless I trek  to Harlem and dine at Sylvia's or Amy Ruth's. However I am a Brooklynite and I would like to enjoy some food in my own damn borough for a change., and please Peaches in Bed-Stuy,should not title itself as a soul food place,  its just a social scene and a sorry excuse for a.....However, I thought this would change with SOCO, but unfortunately I would still  have to make the inconvenient trip to Harlem if I want to sink my teeth in some real mac and cheese, and not Velveeta that has been placed on a skillet, sprinkled with some breadcrumbs and placed in an Easy Bake Oven. This place is all aesthetic and no delivery on the eats...... and I hate being deceived.  Within seconds we were greeted and sat down to eat. Expeditious service. I ordered the red velvet waffle and the fried chicken. Now I was expecting a Belgian waffle with perhaps a hint of red velvet flavor, but all I received  was box red velvet cake mix placed in a Belgian waffle maker and served with some less than mediocre fried chicken that I could barely finish. Me, not finish fried chicken??? Pure blasphemy. My date ordered the BBQ chicken and the mac and cheese I mentioned above. I believe they use a white cheddar cheese to make this dish unique, but it disappoints. It doesn't hit you with a bang which is what good mac and cheese is supposed to do. The prices are astronomical as it cost 16 bucks alone for the chicken and 7 dollars for the pasta and cheese, the most expensive side dish on the menu, I hate to see what the other side dishes taste like. The waiter claimed they served homemade lemonade but it simply taste like sour lemonade from the fountain. BlahhhhI must say however that the service was excellent. Wait staff was very attentive and polite which is rare in this city. However, I am tired of imitation soul food places, claiming to make traditional soul food, which is made from effort and love. This place although has ambiance, has to be more convincing before it calls it self an Authentic Soul Food Restaurant, however I may have to try something different on the menu next time, and if it delivers, my review will change, but for now 2 stars. One for my half eaten chicken, and my half eaten waffle......",2.0

"Saw great reviews on yelp for SoCo so me and my girlfriend went to see what all of the hype was about. When we got there around 6pm on a Wednesday it was quite empty, maybe four tables were taken inside, but it was crowded by the time we left. We were seated outside which to my surprise was covered with a glass top and it was very cool and air conditioned, which was great. I already knew what I wanted, lobster shrimp and grits and the mac and cheese. The shrimp and grits were not what I expected they lacked on taste and seasoning, the shrimp were good but the lobster tasted like it had freezer burn not fresh at all, I couldn't stop adding salt to it, I would never order it again but the mac and cheese is everything it is raved about, gooey and cheesy and full of flavor we loved it. I took the blackened salmon home to my husband and I tasted it, it was pretty good.

It would be one thing if he at least smiled and provided a warm greeting. But he's more of a club-type doorman in a suit. No personality. Trying to look mean.Decor is nice, the crowd is 20's-30's and attractive.But we went to SoCo for the food and were not at all impressed.Starting with the good, cornbread with creamy cool butter was delicious. The butter is gently sweetened with maple and went well with the extremely garlicky (in a good way, for me) mac and cheese. For two people, one order of cornbread and mac & cheese will suffice.Entrees fell flat. The chicken and waffles was a double fail. The chicken consists of three winglets - a skimpy portion for the price. They are not fried crispy, really. Crispiness is provided by some bread crumbs, but the skin isn't fried crisp, resulting in a flabby, under-seasoned bite. The waffle isn't crispy either, and crispiness is a necessary component of any waffle. Short ribs in molasses with coconut and ginger sounded like the stuff of dreams, but is completely lacking in any coconut or ginger flavor. I had expectations of a flavorful, sticky molasses glaze, too, which wasn't met. The short ribs sit on an uninspired and flavorless bed of tiny pale pieces of broccoli. The mashed potatoes were good, however.Dessert, which took a long time to arrive (waiter said they were individually prepared), was supposed to be a spin on a s'more. It had very little to do with a s'more. It was a molten chocolate cake, seemingly of the boxed variety. The ""molten"" center was more of a stiff gel. It was topped with three or four thin slices of marshmallow, not melted enough to yield to the fork. It was paired with ""graham cracker ice cream"", which was really just a ball of vanilla rolled in graham cracker crumbs, and a dollop of whipped cream.We won't be back.",2.0
"Went here yesterday evening for dinner with a friend. We sat at the bar the staff was friendly. I ordered the Fried Chicken with Red Velvet Waffle and we shared a side of the Mac n Cheese. Our food came out in less than five minutes(something is not right with that). The chicken and waffles were just okay. I've had better frozen waffles, the chicken tasted average. Definitely NOT worth the money. Better off going to Harlem to eat at Amy Ruth's. The Mac n Cheese was good not the best but tasty. I will go back but will steer clear of the Chicken and Waffles.",2.0
"Had a reservation for 6 at 3pm and we were running a little late but I called and they said as long as we could make it before 3:30 they could accommodate us (since they have an intermission from 3:30-5) so we were seated and I checked in with yelp so I could get a free order of cornbread. Waiter comes over unsure as to whether we could use this for brunch but then says that we can. Now that im home I just remembered that we never got it. As for food we all got the chicken and waffle. I've had better. The chicken was ok but something was weird with the consistency of the waffle. Also the soco carmel martini was super strong and sweet I wasnt a fan. Also we were sitting in the front and it was very annoying to see people come in and get turned away because the kitchen was closed during intermission and wouldnt open for another hr or so, even a poor pregnant lady got turned away. I just felt like they should have just locked the door but they really did just lose out on a bunch of business. Glad I went because ive heard great things about this place but I wont be back for chicken and waffles. Ill go all the way to amy ruth's in Harlem before I come here. If I happen to be in the area I may go back to try something else on the menu but highly unlikely",2.0
"This place has a very trendy atmosphere.  I set up a surprise birthday dinner here for my boyfriend this summer.  The guests were seated at a large table in the back and the hostess, who had been told earlier of the plan, played along nicely and said ""oh yes, party of two"" when we arrived.  He didn't realize what was going on until we were literally at the table.  It was classic!!Now for the food: We got a handful of appetizers for the table, collard greens, mac and cheese, grits, etc.. everything was very good.  The BF got the Lobster Shrimp and Grits, which was delicious (I kept grabbing food from his plate, haha).  I had the Pecan Crusted Pork Chop, which was also very tasty (but his food always tastes better than mine.. what's that about?)  Several people at the table got the Red Velvet Chicken and Waffles and said that they enjoyed it but the chicken was a bit too salty.  The Brownie Sundae was a great finish.  The service was professional and quite patient with our medium-sized group.  Overall had a really nice time here!",5.0
"I went here with some friends for dinner earlier this month and it was a great experience!  The food was DELICIOUS - I ordered the ""soul food"" sushi rolls (can't remember the menu name but that's essentially what they are, lol), chicken wings (which are my absolute fav!), and pumpkin donuts for dessert (yum yum!).  The overall atmosphere of the place is nice and gets pretty festive in the evenings.The best part of the experience for me was the customer service.  If you've read my reviews before, you know CS is HUGE for me.  Regrettably I cannot remember our waiter's name, however, he was warm, friendly, and because he forgot to bring a couple of (alcoholic) drinks to the table in a timely fashion, he gave us those drinks on the house once they finally arrived. Simple gesture yet very effective in gaining loyalty from patrons.  Great food, great service... check them out!",5.0
Chill spot... I had the chicken and red velvet waffle which was on point.  But then again I had just left the Brooklyn taphouse down the street so I might have just been a little drunk.,3.0
"We went for a Saturday early-afternoon lunch -- I'm sure the SoCo vibe is different at night when the bar/lounge area is more bustling.  But Saturday afternoons are fairly sedate (there were five or six other tables). If I had to summarize my impression of this place it is this: confused. It seems to aspire to be trendy and hip (please see the totally hipster bathroom sink), and yet the decor is sort of blah and uninspired, and the menu is supposed to be down-home and comfort. None of these vibes really go together, and you can really feel that when you're in the restaurant. Speaking of things you can feel in the restaurant: cold.  And then really, really hot. It seems SoCo doesn't have its heating system down, so there would be 15-20 minutes of cold (so cold that most of the diners were wearing jackets, even though we were all sitting far from the door) followed by five minutes of take-your-breath-away dry Arizona desert heat.  There were a few other things that were off -- the food took a remarkably long time (considering that we all ordered sandwiches and there were only a few other tables in the restaurant). We waited about 25 minutes for sandwiches.  The service was virtually invisible despite the empty restaurant (our waiter could best be described as awkward - he seemed better suited for a TGI Fridays or a Cheesecake Factory than for SoCo, and there were just weird service gaps - tea and coffee came without sugar and milk, things like that).  And the invisible service was surprising given that the waiter and some folks from the kitchen and the hosts were just standing around chatting.  It all just felt very make-shift and amateur.After all these gripes, the food was just fine -- the burgers are massive and tasty enough (the fries, though, are soggy and undersalted).  The veggie sandwich was delicious but could have used something to hold it together (perhaps cheese) because everyone knows that if you put a bunch of grilled veggies between two pieces of bread, they're all going to slide out. And that's what happened. The description of the veggie sandwich promised that it was chickpea flavored, but I found not even a hint of the garbanzo.   All of this to say the food was just average.I'd be ok with returning to a just-ok restaurant with barely-ok food in a place with few choices, but in this neighborhood, there are just so many other amazing places that I doubt I'll be back.",3.0
"The ambiance of this place is a cover-up for how average and mediocre the food is here, read on and I will explain......So I like to think of myself as an avid restaurant goer. I eat out at least 6 days a week and because Bed-Stuy/Clinton Hill area is just getting to have a few decent places, I jog over to Myrtle Avenue, where there is a variety of choices for eateries. I have seen this place a few times around the Grand Opening and made a mental note to myself to check it out,especially because the sign outlined that it served Southern Cuisine. Now growing up with my grandmother from North Carolina (although this may sound biased) but she was an excellent cook. We had a home cook meal every night and I daresay that I was never disappointed. However I was in this place. My excitement about this place and the expectations was extremely high. Since my grandma passed I have not had a decent down-south home cooked meal in a while unless I trek  to Harlem and dine at Sylvia's or Amy Ruth's. However I am a Brooklynite and I would like to enjoy some food in my own damn borough for a change., and please Peaches in Bed-Stuy,should not title itself as a soul food place,  its just a social scene and a sorry excuse for a.....However, I thought this would change with SOCO, but unfortunately I would still  have to make the inconvenient trip to Harlem if I want to sink my teeth in some real mac and cheese, and not Velveeta that has been placed on a skillet, sprinkled with some breadcrumbs and placed in an Easy Bake Oven. This place is all aesthetic and no delivery on the eats...... and I hate being deceived.  Within seconds we were greeted and sat down to eat. Expeditious service. I ordered the red velvet waffle and the fried chicken. Now I was expecting a Belgian waffle with perhaps a hint of red velvet flavor, but all I received  was box red velvet cake mix placed in a Belgian waffle maker and served with some less than mediocre fried chicken that I could barely finish. Me, not finish fried chicken??? Pure blasphemy. My date ordered the BBQ chicken and the mac and cheese I mentioned above. I believe they use a white cheddar cheese to make this dish unique, but it disappoints. It doesn't hit you with a bang which is what good mac and cheese is supposed to do. The prices are astronomical as it cost 16 bucks alone for the chicken and 7 dollars for the pasta and cheese, the most expensive side dish on the menu, I hate to see what the other side dishes taste like. The waiter claimed they served homemade lemonade but it simply taste like sour lemonade from the fountain. BlahhhhI must say however that the service was excellent. Wait staff was very attentive and polite which is rare in this city. However, I am tired of imitation soul food places, claiming to make traditional soul food, which is made from effort and love. This place although has ambiance, has to be more convincing before it calls it self an Authentic Soul Food Restaurant, however I may have to try something different on the menu next time, and if it delivers, my review will change, but for now 2 stars. One for my half eaten chicken, and my half eaten waffle......",2.0

"Saw great reviews on yelp for SoCo so me and my girlfriend went to see what all of the hype was about. When we got there around 6pm on a Wednesday it was quite empty, maybe four tables were taken inside, but it was crowded by the time we left. We were seated outside which to my surprise was covered with a glass top and it was very cool and air conditioned, which was great. I already knew what I wanted, lobster shrimp and grits and the mac and cheese. The shrimp and grits were not what I expected they lacked on taste and seasoning, the shrimp were good but the lobster tasted like it had freezer burn not fresh at all, I couldn't stop adding salt to it, I would never order it again but the mac and cheese is everything it is raved about, gooey and cheesy and full of flavor we loved it. I took the blackened salmon home to my husband and I tasted it, it was pretty good. All in all I would go again if I was in the neighborhood but after tasting that disappointing Shrimp and grits I'm not so anxious to try anything else.",3.0

"I came here with the fam for a late-ish Sunday brunch and it definitely the a new fav spot with only a few notable downsides. When we got there (about 25 mins before the 12pm opening) we were met with a fairly long line that grew a down nearly half the block after we got there. Once they opened they allowed everyone who could comfortably fit to wait inside. At first they only seated reservations which makes sense, but then there were only two or three groups who were actually there with reservations. Everyone without reservations had to wait nearly a half hour to be be seated even though there was PLENTY space to start seating us. It didn't make sense to only seat two or three groups with reservations while you had several groups without reservations hungrily waiting and staring at plenty of empty and unreserved seats. It annoyed me a bit that they kept asking everyone waiting if any of us had reservations. Um, obviously not if were all just chilling here. And shouldn't you know how many reservations you have set up for the day beforehand? The whole thing seemed painfully bougie. Eventually though they began to seat everyone and once everything became more settled it turned into a really chill and enjoyable environment and atmosphere. Service was great and the crowd was mostly families, some after-church folk, and some parties/get-togethers. I was a little worried about the food though b/c I was getting Red Rooster vibes from the place (Great ambience but sub-par food) But the food was better than expected. I got the red velvets waffles with buttermilk fried chicken (b/c honestly what else would I would get.) The waffles were pretty good, but really just tasted like regular waffles. But the fried chicken tho? Ohhhmygoddd. It's food like that chicken that make me start to reconsider my life choices (like I was seriously questioning why I ever decided to try vegetarianism when poultry cooked liked this existed.

Lastly, the length of the bar is covered in Tupperware containers of fresh ingredients. Kind of cool, actually...except for the medical squirt bottles they also put ingredients in (timemachine-tattoosuppli…); they were totally dripping on the bar and grossing me out because I kept thinking of them squirting saline etc. Overall, a really beautiful place and the photos of their food that I've seen online look great...I just hope they figure out their bar/clientele better....if they do, I'll update down the road...",2.0

The texture of the salmon, the seasoning, and the portion were all just right, and the meal went so well with a glass of rosé. One of my friends really enjoyed the ravioli, and two friends loved the chicken and red velvet waffles.When one of us asked the waiter about the mini vegan slider, he replied (with a little snap of the neck), ""It's a mini vegan slider."" Well, she didn't say that she couldn't read the menu; clearly she wanted details about what was in the thing. She ended up ordering the sliders anyway, and she liked them.

Lastly, the length of the bar is covered in Tupperware containers of fresh ingredients. Kind of cool, actually...except for the medical squirt bottles they also put ingredients in (timemachine-tattoosuppli…); they were totally dripping on the bar and grossing me out because I kept thinking of them squirting saline etc. Overall, a really beautiful place and the photos of their food that I've seen online look great...I just hope they figure out their bar/clientele better....if they do, I'll update down the road...",2.0
"I had dinner here with four friends the other night. We waited about ten minutes to be seated. The blackened salmon came with two tender pieces of plantain and several stalks of crisp asparagus. The texture of the salmon, the seasoning, and the portion were all just right, and the meal went so well with a glass of rosé. One of my friends really enjoyed the ravioli, and two friends loved the chicken and red velvet waffles.When one of us asked the waiter about the mini vegan slider, he replied (with a little snap of the neck), ""It's a mini vegan slider."" Well, she didn't say that she couldn't read the menu; clearly she wanted details about what was in the thing. She ended up ordering the sliders anyway, and she liked them. Besides that, the service was ok.The brownie sundae was delicious, from the thin, crispy wafer on top of the vanilla ice cream to the sweet, chewy brownie. The bread pudding got good reviews from our group, too.",4.0
"My husband and I stopped by SoCo last week after a few friends visited this new spot near Pratt's campus. The decor was nice and I love the cleanliness of the bathrooms. However, the food was so-so.The special of the day was Blackened Scallops and the presentation was great but the scallops were not blackened at all and actually not seasoned. I give the dish a 6 out of 10. My hussband ordered the fried chicken and red velvet waffles and did not like the waffles at all. They were chewy and just tasteless. The batter has to be changed or that dish is not going to last. However, the chicken was seasoned and fried to perfection.",3.0

"Party of 8 @ 8:30pm on a Friday night.  SoCo was on its way to catering to a packed house (and got there before we left).  Service was on point from the moment we arrived (~8:15pm) -- group ordered cocktails in the bar area while we waited for the rest of our party to arrive.  I had the Pacific riesling, friends had the sangria (white, no sugar added, beautiful w/ fresh cranberries & other fruit), and wings to satiate appetites that couldn't wait for dinner.  All were delicious, and the wings had a tangy kick, but nothing that would put off people who don't like spice.  At dinner, I ordered the salmon and tried my husband's fried chicken/waffle. We split the ceasar salad (w/ kale/romaine mix and well-seasoned dressing - yum!) & mac/cheese. Everything was good (he wishes they would've honored his request for all dark meat...), but my eye is on the steak w/ chimichurri or shrimp/lobster grits next time (friends ordered and liked both).  Mac & cheese needed add'l salt for my palate, but that's a simple fix, and better to under salt, i guess?  Didn't order dessert this time.  Per another review, the seating was a tad awkward -- we were seated at a square table, which would be perfect for a party of 8, however the place settings had 3 seated on two sides of the banquette, and 1 on each of the other sides (w/ 1 chair and 1 stool).  Would've been more comfortable if 2 settings were arranged for each side of the square.  It was also quite loud, but that's to be expected in this type of place, I think.All considered, we will definitely go back.Welcome to the neighborhood!",4.0

The hostess was nice and she was the same lady that was in the paper.  She took us to our seats and once I looked at the menu I started dissecting it!! I'm a picky eater and by the time I broke down the menu, I only ate around 3 things on it lol.  But during my 6 minutes of tearing the menu a part, my bf was trying to talk to me and I couldn't hear him.  People probably thought we were trying to kiss each other all night because we kept leaning in towards each other. We were in a non stop shouting match!! The noise level of this place is ridiculous.  And the music was not on and the tv's were on mute!!After sitting for almost 10 minutes my bf got that look on his face which means, I'm ready to go! We were waiting forever just to get water!! And that in my book is not acceptable.  But he came over, apologized for the wait and then we screamed our orders to him.  I had the free range bbq chicken which by the way is $14 and doesn't come with a side!!  I also ordered a side of mac and cheese for $6 bucks I think.  And my bf had the salmon which sucked for me cause I hate that fish. uuggghhh. Another 25-30 minutes went by and we were in a full blown argument. Or that's probably what the other guest thought cause we were just yelling (but really talking!). It's horrible to sit down for a nice meal and not be able to hear shit! smh. I digress....The food came and everything was good but they need to tweak the menu. For $14 for a half of chicken, can a sister get a piece of corn bread on the side? And the mac and cheese was good, and presented in a cast iron skillet. I tired the salmon but I don't care how you prepare it I don't care for it.  I noticed that several people ahd the red velvet waffle and fried chicken but the waffle looked really sweet.

And that in my book is not acceptable.  But he came over, apologized for the wait and then we screamed our orders to him.  I had the free range bbq chicken which by the way is $14 and doesn't come with a side!!  I also ordered a side of mac and cheese for $6 bucks I think.  And my bf had the salmon which sucked for me cause I hate that fish. uuggghhh. Another 25-30 minutes went by and we were in a full blown argument. Or that's probably what the other guest thought cause we were just yelling (but really talking!). It's horrible to sit down for a nice meal and not be able to hear shit! smh. I digress....The food came and everything was good but they need to tweak the menu. For $14 for a half of chicken, can a sister get a piece of corn bread on the side? And the mac and cheese was good, and presented in a cast iron skillet. I tired the salmon but I don't care how you prepare it I don't care for it.  I noticed that several people ahd the red velvet waffle and fried chicken but the waffle looked really sweet. I didnt want to take a risk on ordering it, but I think its their ""signature dish"" as of now.",3.0
"ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE AND DELECTABLE ! The early bird prix-fixe was a great deal and a good size. The caesar salad was interesting, but in a good way because it was kale leaves instead of romaine or iceberg.  I got the shrimp and grits for my entree and let me tell you, it was very satisfying! I ended the night with bread pudding! WHAT A NIGHT! recommend for trendy folk who want to have a home-cooked southern meal in NY.",5.0
"This was a great choice to start off celebrating my birthday....Service was amazing. Drinks were Great. The food was AWESOME, I ate every last crumb, which consisted of Blacken Salmon, baked sweet plantain, the best asparagus I have tasted ...in my life,okra and tomatoes and collard greens (to die for) and Yes I ate it all..... I forgot to mention the cornbread which I ate with guilt :( But that didn't stop from eating that Peach Cobbler. I can't wait until I go back again.......",4.0
"What to expect when you are expecting. Soco was what I expected and I'm so proud to say I enjoyed myself. Took my hubby here for his Bday, it was local and not too expensive for a delisous meal.

"SoCo has gained a new fan!! Came here for dinner and it was pure awesomeness. Despite not having a reservation the hostress was extremely gracious and sat us right away. Our server Robert was quick to offer suggestions and advice, and he was SUPER patient with my bf who was so indecisive which was quite annoying lol. He didn't even flinch when my bf sent back his soda (Wtf?) and kept my glass of water filled even as dinner service got busy.For my entree I had the Butternut Squash w/ White Mushroom Sauce Ravioli which came with collard greens and it was delish omg! My bf had the pecan crusted porkchop with sweet potato mash and collards which was also yummy. We shared a side of Mac & cheese...another homerun! Our awesome server Robert recommended the pecan pie with peach ice cream for desert and I died and went to heaven!SoCo is great and if you haven't been there get your self there asap!",5.0

I totally forgot to use my check in offer so when you go make sure you use yours and get a free mardi GRAS with an entree',5.0
"Haven't been ""wowed"" by a restaurant in a while. Great food, trendy chill atmosphere. Drinks are good, had shrimp lobster and grits and it was heaven.

I could have a million Georgia Peach ones. Soooo tasty. And it's so calm and quiet inside, I love it. It's just my kind of dinnerplace and I can't speak more highly of it than I am right now.

"After trying to organize a group of about 22-23 people and trying to avoid the prefix menu they kinda make large groups such as mine get (didn't wanna limit my friends to just the short version of a great menu), we got to Soco around 9 for an 830 reservation and they were still able to accommodate us! And this is with them agreeing to let us forgo the prefix menu. We did get lucky with the timing, since a huge group was leaving and we were able to grab their tables. While we waited for the tables to be cleaned and the rest of my group to arrive, we hung out by the bar, where the bartenders were cool as hell. As far as food and drink presentation and ambiance goes, this place was pretty damn nice...and this is on a Sunday night too (Columbus day weekend). Drinks were really nice looking and food looked even better! Most of my group ordered the Chicken and Red Velvet Waffles, which seemed to go down pretty good. I tried it myself, can't say I was the biggest fan, but it was still good. I ordered the lobster-shrimp and grits, because I've never really had grits southern style before...and it was ridiculously good...the spicy tomato sauce was so good, the seafood was tender and the grits were cheesy and rich, but not overwhelming.  I tried the mac and cheese, and being a mac and cheese ""aficionado,"" I can say this was above average..garlicky and cheesy and awesome (beware, it's very rich and most of us took them home in doggy bags). A friend, who is vegetarian, ordered the smoked pumpkin ravioli and I was told that was also on point...The appetizers were excellent also, we ordered the F-que wings and mussels...I'm sure someone was ready to take a straw to the broth that the musels were in..wait, that might have actually been me.Overall, a GREAT experience, can't really take anything away from this place.

I think it has Parmesan in it and it comes in a mini cast-iron skillet; two people who are not greedy can eat off of this.The cornbread was delicious.

"So I heard about SoCo from one of my buddies during a conversation about chicken and waffles.  When he told me they had red velvet waffles, I had to check this place out.  I went a week ago and went back the next week.  First visit - I ordered the pecan crusted pork chops with mashed sweet potatos and collard greens.  Now you can't mess up a pork chop - and SoCo didn't! Tender, juicy, flavorful!! EXCELLENT!!!  My friend initially ordered the chicken and red velvet waffle.  Yes, RED VELVET!!!  However, we found out the chicken pieces are legs and thigh (a note if you don't like dark meat - no substitutions either).  He ended up changing his order to the pork chops.  Also, we ordered a side of mac and cheese.  IT'S A MUST HAVE! They serve it in a mini cast iron skillet and it comes out piping hot.. and it's the best mac and cheese I've ever tasted! (Sorry grandma)Second visit - I ordered the pork chops again (they were that good) and my friend ordered the Lobster, Shrimp and Grits!! We started off w/ the crawfish dumpling as an appetizer.. OMG.. it tastes as good as it sounds!!!!  But back to the lobster, shrimp and grits!!! EXCELLENT!!!  It's definitely a healthy portion and the flavor is out of this world!!Cocktails - I ordered the guava something -er-other and it was EXCELLENT! It sneaks up on you.  My friend ended up getting the cucumber something-er-other and it was great also!!If I could give this place 100 stars, I would... it was just that good! The wait staff was great, the ambiance is great (sit outside on a nice day).  The only thing is that it opens at 5pm...  I'm hoping they will eventually have a brunch option!I'm glad I found this spot before it blows up because trust me, you will want to eat her now before it becomes too crowded!!!",5.0
"I must say the food here is pretty good. I had the salmon w/ Mac & cheese which was tasty. The salmon was seasoned well & not over cooked. The Mac & cheese was yummy, has a nice crispy top.

"After hearing such great raves on SoCo, I finally had a change to grab brunch here last Saturday. The decor kinda has a modern industrial feel to it but the people definitely bring in the trendy BK vibe to the place. You can't help but people watch while you are here.On the food front, I will say this place did not disappoint! There were too many yummy options on the menu. For starters, we ordered the Dragonfly Shrimp with Sweet Chili Mayo. The crispy shrimp had a great consistency and the bed of salad that came with the appetizer complemented the shrimp well. The mayo was a great topper to the appetizer but wasn't spicy at all....it was more on the sweet side. We also ordered the Buttermilk Fried Chicken with red velvet waffles along with the strawberry shortcake french toast. The chicken was seasoned perfectly and much more favorable than expected and the waffles were soft and tasty. Individually, I thought each was amazing but together I felt like the flavors were too powerful for 1 dish. The food was plentiful with 3 full pieces of chicken and the waffle engulfed the entire plate. Typically, a bit much for me for brunch but that didn't stop me from devouring it!  The french toast was bit too sweet for my liking. I wish there was a little less cream cheese to it and more strawberries, but I easily took care of it by pushing the excess cream cheese to the side.There's still so many options on the menu that I'm looking forward to try. I'll definitely be back to this spot!",4.0

Maybe that is splitting hairs but consistency is important if you are a repeat customer. The drinks are always tasty and fruity/girly just the way I like them.The things on the menu that were finger lickin' good: chicken wings appetizer, ribs(the appetizer portion only the larger size loses something in translation), kale crawfish dumplings, shrimp and grits,  macn chees and pecan crusted pork chop.I wasnt wowed by the fried chicken and waffles though. I thought the batter was good but the chicken was underseasoned and the waffle was too sweet IMO. Take the last bit with a grain of salt as Im not a fan of red velvet anyway. I imagine that the waffles alone would make a great brunch dish.

"Ok, so I've been waiting to go to SoCo for a long time. I had heard about it for years, but never made it out. I must say, it definitely met my expectations. Its a really nice restaurant that adds a different flavor to the neighborhood I grew up in. Its like right next door to my favorite Mexican Restaurant, Castros, and across the street from the building I grew up in. The entire Myrtle Avenue strip has become more grand than I remember in terms of restaurants/lounges/bars, but this restaurant definitely adds a fine dining experience. Decor: It has an industrial feel to it. The decor and design of the seating areas is sleek and modern. There is ample seating and various bar set ups and an air conditioned patio in the back. It was a REALLY nice patio, but SUPER tiny for a dining space. Great use of limited space though. Service: The service is great. The waiter was fairly attentive without being too in our faces. The food came out quick and was hot and fresh. Food: The wings I got for the appetizer were just alright. I'm not a fan and will probably not waste the calories next time. My entree was the Lobster and Shrimp with  Grits. I LOVE grits and these were just about the best grits I've ever had in my life. Everything worked together in this dish to make an amazing tasting meal. I even though it was worth a whopping $25 based on the taste and presentation alone, but it wont be getting that often. My friend had wings also and the Mac and Cheese. The Mac and Cheese thouggghhhh!! I totallllyyy understand the hype around the mac and cheese. It was delicious. No lie, next time I go back I have to get my own mac and cheese. Deeelish! Oh yeah, the drinks were good as well. I had the Mardi Gras. It was yummy, but kind of sweet.All in all, it was a great experience.",4.0

"I ordered the Creole Shrimp Gumbo and it was blah. Bland and i was expecting to get more than just one shrimp cut in half seeing how it is name ""shrimp gumbo"" and the first ingredient listed is shrimp. But hey, I guess that what i get for my 10 bucks. My friend ordered the Buttermilk Fried Chicken and Red Velvet Waffles  which he said was ""ok"" and his boyfriend ordered the Lobster, Shrimp, and Grits which he really enjoyed. Waiter was ok, service was decent, the atmosphere was relaxing and comfortable. My first experience of SoCo is that it's just a tad overrated.",2.0

"Me and my girls went to Soco's for brunch on a Saturday. (FYI - It was everyone's first time there) All except 2 pp (six of us in total) got something different from the menu. I had the shrimps and grits and it was so good!! We all tried each others dishes and it was all delicious. Everything was flavorful, not greasy and not to salty. We tried the F'Que wings which were pretty tasty. We got the unlimited mimosa and it definitely served the purpose. Will we be going back? Most definitely!!! Kudos to Soco's!Gave it a 4 star because we made a reservation and still had to wait a half hour.",4.0
"Had the chicken n waffles. Chicken was deelish waffle was ok. Waffle was more soft n cakey than crunchy like a traditional waffle. The chicken on the other hand was well seasoned n crunchy, I would order it alone if I could. FYI Portions are on the small side. Decor is very nice, pretty swanky place. Staff was also very nice. Would like to come back when its warmer and sit outside.",4.0

Good service and nice decor..BUT..waaaay too noisy...it looked and felt more like a singles bar and I did not care much for the crowd..if your looking to have a nice quiet dinner this is def not the spot (at least on a friday night its not). They sat us by the door and we were a bit close to the bar..we went on a  friday night..so that may be the reason for the noisy crowd...BUT my food was so good that I tuned out the crowed and the noise..we all had the famous chicken and waffles with mac n cheese..I would probably go back for the food but def not on a fri or sat night!",2.0

Also tried their corn bread and the mac n cheese, which the manager said is her families recipe, was the best mac n cheese I ever had.  My friends tried the salmon, the shrimp n Grits and the pork chop, and everyone loved their food. Not one complaint. We all had  peach ciroc cosmos which was also good. I would highly recommend Soco to anyone. Great spot for a date or a night out with friends. I would suggest making a reservation. We didn't have one so we waited a while for a table, but well worth it. I will definitely be returning to Soco.",5.0
This place is excellent the food is on point the red velvet waffle and fried chicken was amazing ... The wait was about 30-40 mins which was well worth it ...

"I never tire of the food here. I'm attempting to try everything on the menu at least once. This place is the perfect combination of ""mad decent"" food and cool (not to mention, good looking) peeps. The infamous fried chicken and red velvet waffle is a must try. The lobster and shrimp and grits is on point. The strawberry shortcake french toast is good (although next time I would request less cream cheese). I was a bit disappointed by the cheese & grits--I thought the consistency of this dish was off and the flavor could have been more potent. And I can't forget about the drinks. Depending on which bartender makes them, you will either be very satisfied or just plain satisfied by their taste and/or strength. I do recommend the hibiscus margarita...those (as in, I had more than one, :P) were great! Make sure you check out Soco for Saturday or Sunday brunch. But remember, no hats are allowed...unless you're like the one female diner, whose hat was attached to her wig/weave, and thus, an exception to the ""no hats allowed"" rule was made just for her.

"If you don't live near this place make the effort anyway. I have been there 3 times and can't say enough good things. The staff is friendly and competent. Drinks are good. The food is amazing.

The servers are incredibly helpful and the food is quite delicious. The mac and cheese is definitely a winner and so are the shrimp and grits.

"This is my first YELP review, and I did a login just for this.AMAZING. Our waiter was Fred or frank i forgot but he was awesome! very attentive, polite, even let us stay pass his shift.The food was fabulous to say the least - i personally had the pecan crusted pork chops and mac and cheese WOW.The parking isn't easy but well worth the looking around for this place.Price wise- it came out to 127 for my party of 4, we each had a drink, one meal, and shared two mac and cheese sides (yes you can share them, the pictures are misleading a bit). It was a great place causual but nice. Comfortable yet fine dining.I AM GOING AGAIN TO SAY THE LEAST",5.0

"Food was pretty good. Lovely location and the staff is VERY kind (and the waitresses are gorgeous but shhhh). Got me seated quickly and me and my date both enjoyed our selections. She had the red velvet waffle with fried chicken (which was great. Wafle has more of a cake texture than waffle but it was fine). I had the salmon , which was extremely juicy and well prepared.

"Me and my girlfriends game here on a Friday night for girls night out. We had an absolute blast.

This was anmoying needless to say, but  we were finally seated and were not disappointed. I ordered the Carolina rolls for an appetizer, and the pecan crusted pork chops that were great.

"I hadn't been in clinton hills in over a year and was surprised at all the new places that had sprouted up. I met a friend for dinner at soco. I had to see what the hype was about so I had the chicken and red velvet waffles. It was light. I wish the chicken had more seasoning, but I'm glad I had it.

"My cousins and I stopped here one night after seeing a show and all I can say is that this is my new favorite spot in Brooklyn. It has an intimate urban atmosphere, the night we went there was a violinist serenading us with his rendition of R&B classics.

We started with the Carolina Rolls,a southern take on traditional sushi; rice, yams and collard greens wrapped like sushi in a breaded crust. The wings were delicious, the macaroni and cheese was okay, but I don't think I would order it again: too cheesy for me. I really enjoyed the gumbo. The chicken and red velvet waffles were also delicious, but my all time favorite was the shrimp, lobster and grits. The grits were really creamy with just enough cheese and sauce. I will definitely be visiting them again.",5.0

Alex (with the cool jazz voice) was our server and he was very friendly and attentive.We decided to share apps and chose the mac and cheese and the mussels. Which seriously, alone could have been full blown meals. The mac and cheese was absolutely divine. The mussels had andouille sausage for an added kick and the broth was very good.For my entree I narrowed it down to the buttermilk fried chicken with red velvet waffles. I'm not a red velvet fan but I truly enjoyed this waffle, and the chicken was seasoned and crunchy crispy perfection!I sampled the salmon with asparagus and it definitely is worth a revisit. I am in loooooove with the sweet tea..it has replaced my favorite sweet tea which used to be The Pink Teacup...not the new revamped one but the old really good one. This tea knocks that out the box and I used to drink that by the bucket load!SoCo is worth a visit, it'd b great for a date night or girls night out or whatever. Can't wait to try brunch!",5.0

"I'm being generous with the 2 stars only because this place deserves a little more than just 1. Having been to Amy Ruth's in Harlem, I was more than ecstatic at trying a chicken and red velvet waffle dish (main motivation for visit).  Needless to say Soco was disappointing. When you think of Southern cooking and soul food you think of flavorful and savory, so good but so bad because they clog your arteries type of dishes. Not this time. The gumbo appetizer had a nice touch of spice, but still needed salt. When my chicken and waffles came, the waffle tasted like a regular buttermilk waffle that was on the dry side. As for the chicken, some would argue the Colonel at KFC prepares his better. Again there was a lack of flavor and an abundance of cooking oil in the batter. The  lack of seasoning continued to be a trend on the menu as my mother's ""pecan crusted"" pork chops were merely chops whose breading must've turned into tasteless mush by the time they got from the kitchen to our table. Soco is described as southern fusion cuisine, but somewhere in the fusion the south must've made an illegal U-turn and headed back home. Positives: The overall ambiance was nice, music a little loud where you had to have a screaming match with your party, but at least the bathrooms were clean and the hand soap smelled yummy.",2.0
"LOVED the Red Velvet waffle with the fried chicken, fried to perfection!  Not greasy at all!  My children both LOVED the hamburger!  Said it was THE BEST!!!!  We will definitely be back.",4.0
"hats off to this venue! when i first walked into this place, the decor immediately caught my eye. everything from the chairs to the plates and glasses are very unique and modern. they also have some flat screens up front my the DJ booth and full size windows in the front. the rear of the restaurant has an enclosed porch with a nice bench along the back. nice touches along the way.now on to the food.. if i can even call this food and not some weird divine intervention type life changing excellence. i ordered the short rib pizza. now THIS is absolutely one of the best things ive enjoyed in a restaurant. it was served on a grilled flatbread and topped with mozzarella cheese, green and red peppers, onions and of course short rib pieces. the ribs were extremely tender and flavorful. they took what wouldve already been a fantastic pizza and elevated it 10 more levels. the flatbread was my second favorite part. they grilled it to give it the open fire flavor and soft melty texture. the grilled peppers and onions were the perfectly compliment to the beef as they usually are we also had the mac and cheese and chicken and red velvet waffles. the mac and cheese was good. but because of my high standards (thanks nanny!), i cant really rate it too high. I like that they used minced garlic and a lighter cheese, but i was looking for it to be a little more cheesier. a little dry for my taste. the chicken and waffles was great and very creative. the waffle tasted more like a light  cake, but very tasty and not too sweet. the chicken was good but wouldve been so much better with dark meat, which was requested but not delivered. with that being said, thats my only knock on my experience here. out waitress was understandably busy on a sunday afternoon. but she did promise at least one piece of dark meat that we didnt get. she also disappeared for a while, so i never got a refill on my brew. but definitely go here, the atmosphere is very hip and the music is great and played at a decent volume. (get the short rib pizza or i will find you..)",4.0
"I went to Soco last night and was happy with the overall experience.  I started off with a drink, the cucumber cooler and it was definitely a refreshing drink.  For an appetizer we had the mussels with the habanero broth.  It had just the right amount of spicyness to it, I enjoyed every bite. I had to go for the chicken n' waffles since it was highly recommended and I was overjoyed.  The chicken had just the right amount of crispiness to it and it wasn't drenched in oil. The waffles man o man were they good.  The service was amazing, everyone was very attentive and friendly. Would definitely go back her again to try other dishes.",4.0

"So i went to this spot after the GIANTS won and i was floored.....it was like i walked into scene from brown sugar b/c the vibe was very cool, laid back , & sexy without even trying! we were seated immediately and our seats were directly in front of this AMAZING violinist! talented is an understatement for this guy. he played everything currently on the radio! UH MAZ ING!  then our drinks came and they were delish! food was outstanding! i had the red velvet waffle & chicken while my date had the shrimp lobster & grit's of the staff that worked there was very accommodating and friendly which is sometimes a rarity here in NY.

"HOW can this be deemed as Soul food??? Even the BBQ sauce on the ribs is Asian!!!!!!!!  ... and THAT was the best tasting thing fo the 6 things we had at the table. Seriously, these ""rave reviews"" must be from our ppl who are more into shnazzy atmosphere than quality, quantity, and authenticity of the food on menu. this was NOT soul food....  They did  not honor the discount we had for half off, but decided to take off $20 instead and hoped we wouldn't notice. Only ONE of the 5 staffers we intereacted w/ seemed nice.... a short teeny female w/ those oversized non-perscription glasses that are supposedly in style now.  LOL at how as I typed this, I realize none of the 4 female workers there wear above a size 4 or 6.... LOL.... Must be a Trini run spot. SMH. The waiter barely came over when it was only half full, but once he saw the tip I was leaving regardless, THEN he popped up 2x in 5 mins when we only saw him 2x for 45 mins prior. We had to keep asking him for basic things and he'd forget. OK- The food was just ok..... I ordered the mac'n'cheese like reviewers below said and I was like ""Is this it?"". I also had the pecan crusted pork.... Some dark brown, unappetiszing sauce was on the yams like Mexican mole (chocolate sauce).... TOTALLY confused at their method of ""soul fusion""... SMH.... I won't be returning, especially when The Five Spot is only 2 blocks down and serves ridiculously DELISH Soul food.... REAL Soul food!!",1.0

"I'm being generous with the 2 stars only because this place deserves a little more than just 1. Having been to Amy Ruth's in Harlem, I was more than ecstatic at trying a chicken and red velvet waffle dish (main motivation for visit).  Needless to say Soco was disappointing. When you think of Southern cooking and soul food you think of flavorful and savory, so good but so bad because they clog your arteries type of dishes. Not this time. The gumbo appetizer had a nice touch of spice, but still needed salt. When my chicken and waffles came, the waffle tasted like a regular buttermilk waffle that was on the dry side. As for the chicken, some would argue the Colonel at KFC prepares his better. Again there was a lack of flavor and an abundance of cooking oil in the batter. The  lack of seasoning continued to be a trend on the menu as my mother's ""pecan crusted"" pork chops were merely chops whose breading must've turned into tasteless mush by the time they got from the kitchen to our table. Soco is described as southern fusion cuisine, but somewhere in the fusion the south must've made an illegal U-turn and headed back home. Positives: The overall ambiance was nice, music a little loud where you had to have a screaming match with your party, but at least the bathrooms were clean and the hand soap smelled yummy.",2.0
"LOVED the Red Velvet waffle with the fried chicken, fried to perfection!  Not greasy at all!  My children both LOVED the hamburger!  Said it was THE BEST!!!!  We will definitely be back.",4.0
"hats off to this venue! when i first walked into this place, the decor immediately caught my eye. everything from the chairs to the plates and glasses are very unique and modern. they also have some flat screens up front my the DJ booth and full size windows in the front. the rear of the restaurant has an enclosed porch with a nice bench along the back. nice touches along the way.now on to the food.. if i can even call this food and not some weird divine intervention type life changing excellence. i ordered the short rib pizza. now THIS is absolutely one of the best things ive enjoyed in a restaurant. it was served on a grilled flatbread and topped with mozzarella cheese, green and red peppers, onions and of course short rib pieces. the ribs were extremely tender and flavorful. they took what wouldve already been a fantastic pizza and elevated it 10 more levels. the flatbread was my second favorite part. they grilled it to give it the open fire flavor and soft melty texture. the grilled peppers and onions were the perfectly compliment to the beef as they usually are we also had the mac and cheese and chicken and red velvet waffles. the mac and cheese was good. but because of my high standards (thanks nanny!), i cant really rate it too high. I like that they used minced garlic and a lighter cheese, but i was looking for it to be a little more cheesier. a little dry for my taste. the chicken and waffles was great and very creative. the waffle tasted more like a light  cake, but very tasty and not too sweet. the chicken was good but wouldve been so much better with dark meat, which was requested but not delivered. with that being said, thats my only knock on my experience here. out waitress was understandably busy on a sunday afternoon. but she did promise at least one piece of dark meat that we didnt get. she also disappeared for a while, so i never got a refill on my brew. but definitely go here, the atmosphere is very hip and the music is great and played at a decent volume. (get the short rib pizza or i will find you..)",4.0
"I went to Soco last night and was happy with the overall experience.  I started off with a drink, the cucumber cooler and it was definitely a refreshing drink.  For an appetizer we had the mussels with the habanero broth.  It had just the right amount of spicyness to it, I enjoyed every bite. I had to go for the chicken n' waffles since it was highly recommended and I was overjoyed.  The chicken had just the right amount of crispiness to it and it wasn't drenched in oil. The waffles man o man were they good.  The service was amazing, everyone was very attentive and friendly. Would definitely go back her again to try other dishes.",4.0

"So i went to this spot after the GIANTS won and i was floored.....it was like i walked into scene from brown sugar b/c the vibe was very cool, laid back , & sexy without even trying! we were seated immediately and our seats were directly in front of this AMAZING violinist! talented is an understatement for this guy. he played everything currently on the radio! UH MAZ ING!  then our drinks came and they were delish! food was outstanding! i had the red velvet waffle & chicken while my date had the shrimp lobster & grit's of the staff that worked there was very accommodating and friendly which is sometimes a rarity here in NY. Overall great experience and will definitely be going back & recommending. oh yeah that mac & cheese in a skillet rocked my WORLD along side my peach cobbler cocktail:)",5.0
"Even though its on the G line & a little far out, it's was worth the travel. Loved the atmosphere. The Blacken Salmon was totally delicious, Very juicy.

"HOW can this be deemed as Soul food??? Even the BBQ sauce on the ribs is Asian!!!!!!!!  ... and THAT was the best tasting thing fo the 6 things we had at the table. Seriously, these ""rave reviews"" must be from our ppl who are more into shnazzy atmosphere than quality, quantity, and authenticity of the food on menu. this was NOT soul food....  They did  not honor the discount we had for half off, but decided to take off $20 instead and hoped we wouldn't notice. Only ONE of the 5 staffers we intereacted w/ seemed nice.... a short teeny female w/ those oversized non-perscription glasses that are supposedly in style now.  LOL at how as I typed this, I realize none of the 4 female workers there wear above a size 4 or 6.... LOL.... Must be a Trini run spot. SMH. The waiter barely came over when it was only half full, but once he saw the tip I was leaving regardless, THEN he popped up 2x in 5 mins when we only saw him 2x for 45 mins prior. We had to keep asking him for basic things and he'd forget. OK- The food was just ok..... I ordered the mac'n'cheese like reviewers below said and I was like ""Is this it?"". I also had the pecan crusted pork.... Some dark brown, unappetiszing sauce was on the yams like Mexican mole (chocolate sauce).... TOTALLY confused at their method of ""soul fusion""... SMH.... I won't be returning, especially when The Five Spot is only 2 blocks down and serves ridiculously DELISH Soul food.... REAL Soul food!!",1.0

I am an absolute fan of soul food, so it's nice to have this restaurant added to the mix. SoCo attempts to put a spin on the meals that they serve. For example instead of shrimp and grits, it's lobster, shrimp and grits or instead of just chicken and waffles, it's chicken and red velvet waffles. I appreciate the effort as do my taste buds. The bartender was on point, even serving up ciders (w/alcohol) as is done in its original homes of Ireland and the UK-on ice. Unfortunately, I never like it on ice, so I would have appreciated being asked in advance, but I appreciate all efforts in the area of authenticity. Cool points for that!

"this place was just ok. we got lots of mixed messages about whether our large group was going to be able to sit together before they finally seated us. it was a large booth and probably the nicest in the place. but the positives end there. my friends enjoyed their food but my lobster and grits was extremely overseasoned and not worth the money. and at one point there was some miscommunication with the server and we were sent an extra order of macaroni and cheese. we explained the mix up and told them we would keep it, only to later find out they had charged us for it. still not such a big deal. but when we explained that we were just going to keep it to avoid it being thrown out and hadn't expected to pay for their mistake, the manager came over to  hear our side of the story and responded by taking the macaroni out of our bag (it had been packed up since we couldn't eat it all) and walking away. we confronted her about it on the way out and she was slightly apologetic, but it is really unthinkable that she would do that in the first place. our party spent hundreds of dollars but she was more focused on us only getting what we paid for than on good customer service. i will never go back.",2.0
"a group of 7 of us went to SOCO tonight, as per my last review the food is still spectacular,  i had the 1/2 BBQ chicken it was perfect. the food here is really really exceptional. i will keep coming back however,  i' think i went a bit over board on my last review about the service. it was really not good tonight, first they tried to seat us at a L shaped table where two of us would have had our backs to one another, that's just ODD! meanwhile there was a perfectly good table available,  which i  had to ask the hostess if we could sit at, the hostess was trying to make the shitty table work, bad form.  keep in mind it was 7 PM and we made a reservation. we're going to be done before your Saturday night party scene...we all live in the neighborhood make a little effort for us! SOME ONE HAS TO TRAIN THE BUS BOYS, they throw the food down, they move all the glasses and sliver wear, but it's done it a way that feels really intrusive. they also clear your plate the second you're finished eating, which is rude to the other people eating it's like your being rushed out... this is something management needs to address with the wait staff.

"This place needs fine tuning. The drinks at the bar are o.k. but are sold at Manhattan prices! $15 for a Long Island. on top of that, the bartender (lady with short hair) told me I had to pay cash because they didn't accept Discover card.. Well she lied!!! That alone would make me leave a place like that, but I stayed b/c my friend really wanted to eat. I think the chef needs to make the sauce on his shrimp, lobster, and grits thicker. I felt as if my grits were swimming in a tomato broth.  As a lady that has grown up around fine southern cuisine and ""down home cooking,""  the grits could have been smoother. Texture is important in grits (hence the word grits) but lumpy and luke warm is unacceptable. Although the grits and sauce were at its best ""o.k"" the seafood was well seasoned and properly cooked. I requested another order of grits and they simply re- heated it in the microwave. Now everybody knows that you are supposed to reheat grits in a pot with a touch of water t keep its consistency smooth.   The Chicken and Red Velvet Waffles were also ok.. the Waffles tasted like cake batter.

I got the caramel martini and it was really good, a bit pricey for the neighborhood, but yummy nonetheless. I wish I could remember what drinks the others ordered (two of us were teetotalers - especially the 15 year old) but I can say that there were no complaints.When our entrees arrived, and we took our first bites, the table got really, really quiet, which is the mark of some excellent food. Two of us had the fried chicken with red velvet waffle, one had the pecan crusted pork chop & one had the ribs. Each dish was cooked perfectly. The cornbread was good (not great) and the grits were just the way good southern grits should be but I wish they were a bit cheesier. Overall though this place was a hit and I've been craving that fried chicken ever since.",4.0
The atmosphere is very eccentric and our waiter Alex was very nice and patient. That's y I gave three stars. My mardi gras drink was not strong and my friends drink ( I forget what it's called) had a weird after taste. I did not want to be cliche and order the infamous buttermilk waffles and chicken so I ordered the lobster shrimp and grits. Didn't like my dish too much--it lacked flavor. My friend ordered the chicken and waffles and we ended up switching plates. The waffles were good but the chicken lacked flavor as well. Maybe because my west Indian taste buds are used to seasoning. I would give this place another try though,4.0

Then the mardigra I ordered was interesting but won't be ordering that again either. Other specialties may be better. I wouldn't really recommend those two. I ordered the skirt steak which came with collard greens and potatoes. All needed more flavor. And the amount of sides that yiu get, yiu will need to order a side dish to make up for the lack of side dish that comes with the meal. I heard the located grits were good. So try that. My boy had the red velvet waffles and chicken. Chicken needed seasoning. And the waffle was like a bland cake. I forgot the appetizers. The fque wings were good. I'd recommend those. Overall, I'm going to give soco another go round. Cool place. Just don't go expecting to be wowed.  All different everything next time.",3.0

"A promising start!  I'm getting up there in age, so soon from now I may be too old to fit in with the young crowd (smile), but its an energetic place with a good vibe.  The food is creative and tastes good, combining some interesting flavors from the west indies with other flavors from around the world (at least thats what it seems to me).  Brings life to that stretch of Myrtle too.  I went there earlier in the summer, so cant recall what we ate, but it was all good.",4.0
"THERE IS A HEAVEN, and it is at SOCO with its fried chicken and sizzling mac-n-cheese. Best of all, your arteries won't feel clogged afterward! This place is happening .. DJ lightly spinning on Friday nights, food is ridiculously good, drink menu is creative and fresh .. I'm drooling as I'm writing this review. Service and ambience was on-point. Staff was kind and considerate, and always checked up on us at the right time and made sure the food was good, even on a busy Friday night. TRUST THEIR RECOMMENDATIONS!

Had a great time at SoCo with my family. Members ages 10 to 50. Food menu was limited because it's a new restaurant but everything we ordered was great!

"5 stars for the customer service, ambiance, and the trip back to New Orleans with the flavorful Lobster/Shrimp Grits dish. I pointed out to my Dad, that there were no desserts on the menu and rightly so, a confident Chef can have them but if your ""meal"" was uber successful, you don't need any dessert.. point made and taken, thank You Soco for doing what you do.",5.0
"SoCo's food is orgasmic! I had the blackened salmon, the mac and cheese and the wild strawberry moonshine. My boyfriend had the buttermilk fried chicken with the Mojito drink and we were so impressed with the food. I loved it so much that I was so tempted to lick my fingers! The ambiance was wonderful and the dj played all the r&b/neo-soul hits. I would reccomend Soco to everyone!",5.0
"I was very impressed with the service; decided to try it out after reading reviews here. The waiter was great (Alex), food was excellent and quick efficient service; even the manager came out to ask if everything was going alright! Love the hands on approach. Will definitely recommend and go again :) One of the best dining experiences since moving to Brooklyn",5.0
"An atheist, a Jew, a Catholic & an agnostic go to SoCo on Christmas eve....this is no joke. Wow, we were completely blown away by the food here. The service was excellent, the space is fun, the multi-ethic vibe makes you proud to be human, and I appreciate the fact that the tables are not completely squished together, at least not at the back of the restaurant. I got the caramel martini and it was really good, a bit pricey for the neighborhood, but yummy nonetheless. I wish I could remember what drinks the others ordered (two of us were teetotalers - especially the 15 year old) but I can say that there were no complaints.When our entrees arrived, and we took our first bites, the table got really, really quiet, which is the mark of some excellent food. Two of us had the fried chicken with red velvet waffle, one had the pecan crusted pork chop & one had the ribs. Each dish was cooked perfectly. The cornbread was good (not great) and the grits were just the way good southern grits should be but I wish they were a bit cheesier. Overall though this place was a hit and I've been craving that fried chicken ever since.",4.0
The atmosphere is very eccentric and our waiter Alex was very nice and patient. That's y I gave three stars. My mardi gras drink was not strong and my friends drink ( I forget what it's called) had a weird after taste. I did not want to be cliche and order the infamous buttermilk waffles and chicken so I ordered the lobster shrimp and grits. Didn't like my dish too much--it lacked flavor. My friend ordered the chicken and waffles and we ended up switching plates. The waffles were good but the chicken lacked flavor as well. Maybe because my west Indian taste buds are used to seasoning. I would give this place another try though,4.0

Today was my first time at SoCo and i must say I had a 5 star experience.The place had a nice decor. Our waiter was the sweetest young lady. The chicken and waffles were DELICIOUS ! The chicken was extra juicy and waffle was soft a fluffy. My boyfriend and I went in for just a quick brunch but felt so comfortable that we ended out trying almost every alcoholic beverage on the menu LOL. Oh and the macaroni was to die for !!!!! We will be back soon. When you check-in on yelp you get 10% off your meal and re waiter didn't hesitate to give us our discount. Overall it was great.,5.0
My first experience at SoCo was definitely a good one. I would've given it a five star if  it weren't for the hour and a half wait when being told the wait would be 30 minutes but that's to be expected on a Busy Friday night. Now on to the good parts. Nice decor and ambience to the restaurant  that was very elegant. Now on to the food...My appetizer was the Nola's Mussels in the creamy sauce. The mussels were big but the sauce was ok. The garlic bread that came with it was very good. My entree the chicken and red velvet waffle was excellent. The waffle was perfect not too sweet and not to bland. The chicken was cooked to perfection moist and juicy and it might just be the best piece of fried chicken I've ever had!!!!!! My girlfriend had the skirt steak entree and the f-que wings which were great also. The free Mardi gras drinks with check in we're good also. So if u live in Brooklyn or any of the five boroughs it's definitely worth the trip.,4.0
"Decided to try this place after reading reviews. Of coarse I tried the F-Que wings, these are definitely the best wings.

"I ordered the red velvet waffle and buttermilk fried chicken.  The waffle was a bit on the soggy side, but the chicken was excellent.  My wife had the pecan crusted pork chop which was great.  Her green and mashed yams were sooo good.  Ordered the fried oyster appetizer, it was really good but very small portion for the price.",4.0

The grits was good, but I'm not really a fan. The place is small for the amount of people that were in there that night. I think people came with the idea that this place was another Negril with the downstairs club and wide bar ,although the same owners the atmosphere is quite different.

"This is a cool place just down the street from where my friend lives.  I'm not sure how he found out about it but we decided to try it since it wasn't very far.

I can't recall around what time, I believe it was early to late afternoon. I had the red velvet chicken and waffles.  I enjoyed it.  The waffle was a bit soft, like a piece of cake kinda, but mixed with the chicken, syrup, and a dash of hot sauce it was yummy. I couldn't eat it all so I took some chicken home.  They packed up part of the waffle too but I know leftover waffle wouldn't be a good thing.  We also had bellinis.  They were good.  A bit overpriced for how small the glass was though. We were being adventurous...or fat...and ordered the mac and cheese and the creole shrimp gumbo too.  The mac and cheese was so so.  I probably wouldn't order it again.

"Came here last night and enjoyed every minute of it. They were having a mardi gras themed night and I was greeted with beads, masks, and party favors which was very interactive. I was seated promptly. My server was friendly and attentive, he offered suggestions, and told us about drink specials. They didn't have any ribs so that sucked! The food took about 30 minutes to come which was irritating but I could see that it was getting pretty busy so I was understanding. The food was amazing. Not your typical cornbread, it is lightly seasoned and relish! Red velvet waffles and fried chicken was good but the chicken could use a lil more seasoning.

"First off, this restaurants ambiance is EVERYTHING. Very laid back lounge feeling, with all the upscale amenities.

"Hubby and I went here for our anniversary dinner. Wish we had gone somewhere else.The place is very modern looking, service was OK, butt he food was such a disappointment. I had the prix fix. The cesar salad was OK. Nothing to write home about. For starters, hubby had the wings, which were the best part of the meal.For dinner, I had the skirt steak. It was tough and lacked flavor. It was also a bit too cooked for my taste ( I ordered med-rare).  The collard greens which accompanied the steak were inedible and the roasted potatoes were not cooked enough.Hubby ordered the Red Velvet waffle and chicken.  He had been DREAMING about it for days! He was let down. The two little pieces of chicken had a soggy coating and barely any meat. The waffle was also soggy.  Dessert was a let-down. They were out of the peach cobbler we were dying to try, so we had the bread pudding that came with my prix-fix. It was meh. Nothing I'd get again.Perhaps we were expecting too much?",2.0
"SoCo gets a six on ambiance!  What an exciting place to be!  I've been twice, once for brunch and another time for dinner.  Personally I enjoyed the brunch better than I did the dinner.  I had the chicken and waffles for brunch...and because I'm gluttonous I also ordered the mac and cheese.  The chicken had a crispy crust and the red velvet waffles were just what I needed.  The waitress was also very helpful.  The mac and cheese wasn't oily at all and was tasty but not my favorite.  This is entirely just a preference thing, it wasn't cheesy enough for me.  The cocktails that we ordered were also very good. Dinner was so-so.  I get the flank steak and really didn't love it.  It was cooked longer than what I requested--medium which really took away the flavor that I would have liked to have had.  The collards and potatoes underneath were delightful, but the steak really was underwhelming.  My date got the shrimp, lobster and grits.  The waitress was nice, but I thought it was ridiculous that they still charged the full price even if my guest didn't get the lobster.  Shrimp and grits shouldn't be a $22 dish, Lobster and Shrimp, ok.  I ate my guest's lobster tail and it wasn't buttery at all.  It tastes like it was microwaved, at the very least it was overcooked.

"First time at Soco's and what a delight it was. I have not had food that delicious in a very long time.

"Hubby and I went here for our anniversary dinner. Wish we had gone somewhere else.The place is very modern looking, service was OK, butt he food was such a disappointment. I had the prix fix. The cesar salad was OK. Nothing to write home about. For starters, hubby had the wings, which were the best part of the meal.For dinner, I had the skirt steak. It was tough and lacked flavor. It was also a bit too cooked for my taste ( I ordered med-rare).  The collard greens which accompanied the steak were inedible and the roasted potatoes were not cooked enough.Hubby ordered the Red Velvet waffle and chicken.  He had been DREAMING about it for days! He was let down. The two little pieces of chicken had a soggy coating and barely any meat. The waffle was also soggy.  Dessert was a let-down. They were out of the peach cobbler we were dying to try, so we had the bread pudding that came with my prix-fix. It was meh. Nothing I'd get again.Perhaps we were expecting too much?",2.0
"SoCo gets a six on ambiance!  What an exciting place to be!  I've been twice, once for brunch and another time for dinner.  Personally I enjoyed the brunch better than I did the dinner.  I had the chicken and waffles for brunch...and because I'm gluttonous I also ordered the mac and cheese.  The chicken had a crispy crust and the red velvet waffles were just what I needed.  The waitress was also very helpful.  The mac and cheese wasn't oily at all and was tasty but not my favorite.  This is entirely just a preference thing, it wasn't cheesy enough for me.  The cocktails that we ordered were also very good. Dinner was so-so.  I get the flank steak and really didn't love it.  It was cooked longer than what I requested--medium which really took away the flavor that I would have liked to have had.  The collards and potatoes underneath were delightful, but the steak really was underwhelming.  My date got the shrimp, lobster and grits.  The waitress was nice, but I thought it was ridiculous that they still charged the full price even if my guest didn't get the lobster.  Shrimp and grits shouldn't be a $22 dish, Lobster and Shrimp, ok.  I ate my guest's lobster tail and it wasn't buttery at all.  It tastes like it was microwaved, at the very least it was overcooked. The wings, however, were AMAZING!  They were the highlight of the evening actually.  Though the cocktails were good.  Again, the atmosphere was just what I was looking for.  It was a Friday night and it was just a great place to people watch.  Also a great place for a single brotha to see beautiful women.  But that's another story.

"Well I must say I was expecting much better food than what I got reading some of the previous reviews.

I know it's all the same to most people but I like fries better, so anyway I was told I couldn't substitute although they don't have that disclaimer printed on they're menu(strike #3).

"The F-Que wings were very good and they make a drink called the peach cobbler that's very good as well. I tasted the grits with shrimp and lobster and that was good but the lobster was tough. I actually ordered the chicken and waffles and to be honest, it's not the best I've ever had. My wife thought the collard greens were sweet. I thought they were kind of sweet but not excessively sweet and they didn't have red pepper flakes or even regular hot sauce to balance it out. The mac and cheese that most of the reviewers seem to rave about, is mediocre at best. They use these spiral noodles as opposed to regular elbows and it's just not really good. I say instead of trying to get fancy, just master making it normally. It was a 1-2 hour wait so we ended up ordering at the bar. As we were waiting for our food, a table became available we decided to take it. As we were going to our table, the hostess said that we had to close out the bill at the bar since we ordered everything at the bar. I thought it was kind of stupid to have to do that. I have never had to do that before. If you start out at the bar and then move to a table, of course you'll tip the bartender but you can always close out after you finish eating the way you normally would.

We also tried the Carolina shrimp rolls, which were small, but very very good! My friend ordered the Chicken and waffles, (minus the waffles) with collard greens & mashed sweet potatoes. Chicken looks great, but could use more seasoning.  I opted for the Short Ribs of Beef, which turned out to be A short RIB!!  One piece of beef, (altho it was very tender and good) I am mad at how small the portion was. Also I didnt know that seasonal veggies would be OVER  cooked broccoli! Dont get me wrong the dish was good, and I ate it all. But for $24 I was expecting much better (and bigger), and for us to have 2 apps, and two entrees, I wasnt expecting to finish my meal!  Oh and they charge $4 for cornbread,which isnt that good!

Lesson Learned: This place is very popular and for good reason be sure to make a reservation especially on any weekend night and brunch.

"Went to Soco today which is Sunday. Called @12Noon unti 1 bc no one answered the phone and I had rsvp for 3pm. We just had a mini blizzard here in NY the day b4 so I wanted to make sure they were open so I cont'd  to call@ least til one(I am a stalker for good food:) It's def a journey getting to this place if you don't drive, but I didn't see any parking either so maybe a cab/car service is best. On arrival there was def a crowd,music was rockin . I went straight to the host area and gave them my name and they seated us in a timely fashion but they seated us near the kitchen but my gf was like its more room than the booths so I was cool with it. Our waitress arrived and poured 1 glass of water and disappeared. I'm like I knw she sees 2 ppl sitting here. So she comes bk to get our orders. I ordered the Soco Caramel Martini which was delicious, everythg mixed right(Im a Bartender:) My gf ordered a Sprite and it took 10 mins for her beverage to come. I then ordered the Creole Shrimp Gumbo, Mac n Cheez. My gf ordered FQue wings and Mac n Cheez.Our food came out promptly. The gumbo was delicious but there were no shrimp in my gumbo. I alerted the waitress and she went and told the chief, the chief sends her out with a plate of 2 shrimp. I'm thinkin really! So the mgr comes to me and says is that good, I'm like there should be 4/5 shrimp in gumbo. It is $9 whereas gumbo is usually $6/7 but I don't care abt price, Don't be stingy w/the shrimp!ijs So I will be bk for gumbo and I will be checking to make sure my shrimp is in there Soco: The Mac n Cheez was big enough for 2/3 ppl to enjoy. The mac was nuthin special, just basic mac n cheez. It wasn't nasty but it wasn't like ""I need one of those to go"" delicious.

I was skeptical and ordered it medium rare anyway.

On my second visit, I ordered the Blackened Salmon. Again I was told that it was sushi quality salmon and I ordered it medium rare. It came out well done and tasted like cardboard- there was very little evidence seasonings associated with ""blackened"" anything.

On my second visit, I ordered the Blackened Salmon. Again I was told that it was sushi quality salmon and I ordered it medium rare. It came out well done and tasted like cardboard- there was very little evidence seasonings associated with ""blackened"" anything. The best food item that I have tried thus far is the muscles in chicken andouille cream sauce, and I love the Mardis Gras drink. But the restaurant blew it by charging 4 dollars for more toasted bread to accompany the mussels.",2.0

"I went here with my sister who was visiting from PA. I saw someone tweet about the chicken and red velvet waffles, and we spontaneously headed over there. My sister who is one of the most particular people I know, ordered the chicken and innovative red velvet waffles and the mac and cheese. Miss Particular had no complaints. The syrup has a kick to it that one wouldn't expect and the chicken was seasoned well. I had the bbq ribs appetizer and they were well flavored and succulent. The staff was very sweet and attentive and not in an annoying way. I'm happy it's in my neighborhood..because the drinks were on point too.

The first time I went to Soco I was underwhelmed. I was totally disappointed with the food. I'm not even sure why I returned. But I'm glad I did!!! Soco redeemed themselves in every way! The food and drinks were fantastic. I ordered the chicken and waffles with a side of Mac and cheese. The food came out piping hot and fresh. The first time around the chicken was bland. Not this time. The chicken was very tasty without being too salty. The waffles were fluffy and tasted better than ordinary Eggo waffles but not as sweet as a piece of red velvet cake. They were perfect this time around! The mac n cheese is a little pricey for a side ($9) but it was soooo worth it! And the portion is big enough to share. My cocktail of the night was the peach cobbler. I wanted another but I was afraid I wouldn't finish my food! It was really good. I'm so happy Soco stepped their game up. Can't wait to return!,5.0
Shrimp and lobster grists were great- perfectly cooked and very flavorful. The grits alone are definitely worth ordering. The salad (can't remember which) with steak  was gross - overdressed and soggy. Definitely not worth the price. Nice staff but a bit slow. Probably wouldn't go back.,3.0
"Mac and cheese was excellent.  I liked the fried chicken, it was light and tasty.  I didn't like the red velvet waffle, it was way too sweet for me.  I had the mardi gras during happy hr.  Overall, a nice place to hang out with friends and eat.",4.0
"A very welcome addition to Clinton Hill!  Great!: I've been here twice and am a huge fan of their shrimp, lobster and grits!  Great flavors and very adequate portion of lobster & shrimp.  Caramel Martini was fantastic and served topped with a pierced roasted marshmallow balancing just above the luscious caramel liquor - great presentation!  We began with appetizers: crawfish dumplings and BBQ short ribs.  The dumplings were very good, but the short ribs - fantastic!  Spicy, sweet, tender and juicy.  They can expand THAT appetizer to a main course!  The watermelon lemonade cocktail was very good and  the blueberry bourbon sour (verklempt! - TO DIE FOR - if you like bourbon drinks) NO, I didn't drink all that in one night!  lol, I was with my partner and mom.  We all tasted each other's food to get more of a cross-section of what SoCo could do well.  The Salmon was well seasoned and cooked just right - tender, juicy yet slightly firm.  The service was impeccable!  Very friendly/outgoing staff that was a pleasure!OK:The smoked pumpkin ravioli was OK.  Cooked al-dente, but I didn't really taste any ""smoke"" flavor.  The cornbread was too cake-like (moist) and a bit sweeter than I like.  I'm into the more grainy, slightly drier and less sweet cornbread to go with food.  And for $4 extra (I think?) that was too expensive for the portion we were given.  The mussels tasted fantastic but a few were under-steamed (very mushy texture)...not sure how that happened but for the few that we got, the portion was large and the broth was fantastic, so I'll give them another shot next time.Not so good:Noise level inside.  I don't like nor frequent loud crowded restaurants, but, if the weather is nice (like it was both time I went) then opt for the backyard seating where you can actually have a conversation without shouting ""what?!"" throughout your meal.  :-)Overall, my experience was very favorable and will definitely be back!""Chow"" (Ciao!) for now!  :-)",4.0

"I went there (by chance) at the opening party. It's hard to judge a restaurant that just opened, but.. if they keep up the solid work and attention to detail this is a very welcome addition to the neighborhood.Sure, there are already a few southern cuisine places in the area, and this doesn't feel exactly Brooklyn-ish. but this is the one you go for a change, a nicer dinner, more lively dinner. It's slightly more expensive than the local average, but worth it.They call themselves fusion southern cuisine. I'm happy for the southern part. I didn't really get the fusion part, but I'm glad about that, because I really haven't had any good fusion food either at home or abroad.The food is really tasty. I had the skirt steak, which had a delicious sauce. My wife had the salmon with was very good too. And for dessert we had the creme brulée, which despite being too soft, tasted amazing.The vibe was a little loud, perhaps because it was the opening night, or because half the place is a bar with DJ, but nevertheless I will definitely go back.The decor is nice. Like a said doesn't feel very brooklyn, and it's supposed to be inspired by the Brooklyn bridge, which you don't get at all - which is probably for the best.All in all this feels a bit like Brooklyn's answer to Cafeteria in Chelsea.Note. Like Luz, they should add an awesome $12-15  whole roast chicken to democratize the menu.

I first saw this place when I was walking down the street with a friend and decided to try it.

We didn't order cocktail drinks from the bar but instead we had some bottle pear beverage which was very good. Overall the restaurant wad pretty good and we would like to try other things on the menu when we come back again.

The food pairing choices were unique but enjoyable. His steak was cooked perfectly and the collards were pretty damn good. The waiter came back and put a damper on our evening. Will ordered the sweet potato pie. He enjoyed it. However he asked the waiter for vanilla ice cream instead of the peach. Te waiter said, ""don't worry. I got you"". The desert came out with the peach ice cream. The drinks on the other hand were a slam dunk.

"I went to SoCo on  Friday night to try out the Fried Chicken n Red Velvet Waffles. It was finger lickin good! The only problem was my friend Lobster Shrimp and Grits was even more delicious than what I ate. My party of 5 were are all satisfied with their meals and appetizers as well. The drinks were Okaaaaaay . They were presented well but didnt taste so great except for that Mardi Gras. The atmosphere was cool and they had a DJ towards the later part of the night.We enjoyed the  music and the fact  we could still carry on with a conversation without screaming. Our service was great too, I think our waiter was Remsey. I would definitely recommend you make reservations if you have a large group on busy nights because our wait was about 40 minutes. If we didnt travel from so far we probably woul've given up and gone to another restaurant nearby. I am glad we were patient because we had a great time. Next time we know to save some room for dessert. I will be visiting again.",4.0
"First off I made reservations for a date with my wife for 8:00pm. When we arrived we were promptly seated.... The atmosphere is very trendy and kool. The wait staff is incredible they seated us right away they were very attentive to our needs we ordered drinks first and they were delicious. Southern fused not really I had the blackened salmon with asparagus when I received it there was no asparagus I recieved string beans...it's was good but not Wat I ordered. My wife ordered the lobster and shrimp with cheddar grits....it was very soup and bland no kind of flavor! And then the mac and cheese that every one raves about very very bland and oily no real southern flavor. I'm stil waiting for the southern fuse to find its way to my table. I feel if you want a hangout spot to relax and have a few drinks with just food this place is for you, but if you're looking for good southern food with a twist this is not the place. I was very disappointed...sorry Soco you have a nice spot with great employees. But you gotta work on flavor flavor flavor!!!",3.0
"Yummy spot worth a trip to BK.  One suggestion, if you plan to go for Brunch, arrive after 1:00PM.  We had a 12:30AM reservation (yes, you can get a brunch reservation!) and it seemed like the kitchen wasn't up and running.  I ordered the famous chicken and waffles (red velvet!).  It seemed like the oil wasn't hot enough and my chicken came out oily.  Still pretty good, but I sat through brunch looking in envy at other peoples plates with golden crispy chicken.  Def going back but next time will aim for 1:30PM when the oil is ready for cookin'.",3.0
"I arrived at Soco a little early and had to wait outside until they opened for brunch at noon. They opened promptly and attended and seated everyone fairly quickly. The wait staff is very attentive and helpful. I even had the pleasure of meeting a manager who was also helpful, we had an issue with the mimosa's. I ordered the chicken and waffles based on the reviews I read about it. I thought the waffles were just ok, they didnt really have a taste of red velvet. The chicken was fried perfectly I thought and it had a nice crisp. The meat was tender but it could have used a little bit more seasoning but it was pretty decent overall.The mac and cheese was creamy but it is a huge portion, I think about three people could share it. We also ordered a basket of corn bread, which was slightly sweetened but I liked that about it. Overall I enjoyed the experience and I plan to return to try other things on the menu",3.0

I've been to Soco twice.  The place is charming and the food is great.,4.0
Went there a few weeks ago with a friend on a Friday night. It was fairly crowded but we were able to be seated promptly. I love the vibe in there! There was a DJ who had the classic late 70's early 80's R&B/Soul music going which provided a nice feel to the place. I didn't have any food  but my sangria was on point and the food/menu looked quite appetizing. I was pleasantly surprised by the place and the essence of SoCo itself will have me back there.,4.0
"A pleasant surprise on Myrtle avenue!! Upon entering Soco you are transported to a swanky bar to the left and a host stand to the right. My spouse and I were quickly ushered to the Outdoor seating in the back of the restaurant. Walking through the restaurant you are greeted by the upscale modern seating and the aroma o southern fused cuisine (whatever that means). The waitress was very energetic and offered great recommendations. I ordered the sangria, Mac n cheese, corn, and the red velvet waffles and fried chicken. My spouse ordered the peach Rum-Tini and the pork chops. The drinks arrived quickly. The sangria...pretty good; the rum-Tini...too sweet. Now....the food. I'm not sure what southen fused cuisine is but my chicken and waffles were standard fare. The chicken could hv used some seasoning salt and the red velvet waffles could hv used a little almond flavoring. The corn was delicious...grilled to perfection and the Mac n cheese....BABY! It was worth the trip. My spouse liked the pork chop but needed to add a bit of hot sauce. We finished off the meal with a brownie sundae (yummy). I could go on and on bottom line...the food was great and didnt try too hard. Still not sure what southern fused means...but it's worth the trip to find out for yourself!",3.0

"I went to SoCo on  Friday night to try out the Fried Chicken n Red Velvet Waffles. It was finger lickin good! The only problem was my friend Lobster Shrimp and Grits was even more delicious than what I ate. My party of 5 were are all satisfied with their meals and appetizers as well. The drinks were Okaaaaaay . They were presented well but didnt taste so great except for that Mardi Gras. The atmosphere was cool and they had a DJ towards the later part of the night.We enjoyed the  music and the fact  we could still carry on with a conversation without screaming. Our service was great too, I think our waiter was Remsey. I would definitely recommend you make reservations if you have a large group on busy nights because our wait was about 40 minutes. If we didnt travel from so far we probably woul've given up and gone to another restaurant nearby. I am glad we were patient because we had a great time. Next time we know to save some room for dessert. I will be visiting again.",4.0
"First off I made reservations for a date with my wife for 8:00pm. When we arrived we were promptly seated.... The atmosphere is very trendy and kool. The wait staff is incredible they seated us right away they were very attentive to our needs we ordered drinks first and they were delicious. Southern fused not really I had the blackened salmon with asparagus when I received it there was no asparagus I recieved string beans...it's was good but not Wat I ordered. My wife ordered the lobster and shrimp with cheddar grits....it was very soup and bland no kind of flavor! And then the mac and cheese that every one raves about very very bland and oily no real southern flavor. I'm stil waiting for the southern fuse to find its way to my table. I feel if you want a hangout spot to relax and have a few drinks with just food this place is for you, but if you're looking for good southern food with a twist this is not the place. I was very disappointed...sorry Soco you have a nice spot with great employees. But you gotta work on flavor flavor flavor!!!",3.0
"Yummy spot worth a trip to BK.  One suggestion, if you plan to go for Brunch, arrive after 1:00PM.  We had a 12:30AM reservation (yes, you can get a brunch reservation!) and it seemed like the kitchen wasn't up and running.  I ordered the famous chicken and waffles (red velvet!).  It seemed like the oil wasn't hot enough and my chicken came out oily.  Still pretty good, but I sat through brunch looking in envy at other peoples plates with golden crispy chicken.  Def going back but next time will aim for 1:30PM when the oil is ready for cookin'.",3.0
"I arrived at Soco a little early and had to wait outside until they opened for brunch at noon. They opened promptly and attended and seated everyone fairly quickly. The wait staff is very attentive and helpful. I even had the pleasure of meeting a manager who was also helpful, we had an issue with the mimosa's. I ordered the chicken and waffles based on the reviews I read about it. I thought the waffles were just ok, they didnt really have a taste of red velvet. The chicken was fried perfectly I thought and it had a nice crisp. The meat was tender but it could have used a little bit more seasoning but it was pretty decent overall.The mac and cheese was creamy but it is a huge portion, I think about three people could share it. We also ordered a basket of corn bread, which was slightly sweetened but I liked that about it. Overall I enjoyed the experience and I plan to return to try other things on the menu",3.0

"Overpriced, and definetely overated. First time going to SoCo with my cousin and the only reason we ended up going here was, we went to Footprints first and had gotten fed up with the super long wait for ordering take out as well. The wait at SoCo was one hour and 15 minutes before we were seated, it was very crowded, very very noisy, no real waiting area until your seated at a table, people are just all over the place. Had to wait before you saw a server that was all over the place as well, also the hostess not very informative. Now onto the food,the food was okay literally, not great i've had much better. We ordered an appetizer named ""F-que wings"" what kind of name is that for wings??? and the butternut squash ravioli which was decent, my cousin orddered the red velvet waffles and chicken. She said the waffle was basic, regular and she didn't taste anything like red velvet and the chicken was okay. The bill for two people was high and they add tax to the meal, and expect a hefty gratuity tip. I didn't find this place to be great or spectacular like I read from previous reviews. The service was mediocre, and so was the atmosphere. This was my first time and definitely my last time visiting, I will not be back.",2.0
this place is amazing! really nice stuff! great food! great drinks and beautiful decor! will def come back!!!!!!,5.0
after hearing about this restaurant I decided to go and tryout for myself the food was fantastic I love their chicken and waffles every dish was prepared correctly from appetizers I love the atmosphere and your service is first rate their attention to detail was fantastic good food good atmosphere and wonderful people looking forward to going back and trying some of their southern Creole dishes,4.0
"Been here 3 times and love it more each time.  Havent had a bad dish yet.  Next time i will try the bbq chicken.  The pork chops and salmon are to die for except you should for the plantain that comes with the salmon to be cooked better.  Each time i find it a little raw in the middle.  Other than that food is great.  Now the drinks....On this note Soco fails.  I've tried a few drinks on the cocktail menu and nothing to brag about.  Even tried plain rum and coke, and not even a buzz after the 3rd drink. Im not big on wine or beer but may have to try that next time instead of the watered down drinks that also take very long to serve.  Each time i hear its a new bartender.  Each drink tastes different the 2nd time around. I cant figure that one out.  Soco please get it straight and hire a real bartender.  Forget about finding one with a trendy look and go for one that really knows how to mix and keep it consistent.",4.0
