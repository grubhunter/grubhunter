"Delicious, perfectly flavored and balanced food that leaves me craving more of it when I don't go for a while. Every dish will have you eating voraciously and feeling refreshed at the end. Very good vietnamese!",5.0
"Finally a Vietnamese place in Fort Greene! And what a place. Ngon serves a delicious and fresh take on the Vietnamese classics and has repeatedly expanded their menu since they recently opened. The pho and cracked rice dish are superb. My personal favorite, the pork bun, is served with some of the most delicious marinated pork I've had.When the person I spoke to on the phone misheard my bun order for a banh mi, they didn't miss a beat and had the bun ready in 8 mins while I waited. You would think that the restaurants location under the BQE would be accordingly dingy, however, you step through the door into a serene zen space. Though small, it would be a more than pleasant space to eat your banh mi at the counter.I fully recommend Ngon and couldn't be happier with the new addition to the neighborhood.",5.0
"The quality of this place is consistently good. It is a small place but it is one of the healtier options in the area. There is really nothing in that radius that is even remotely appealing. It is a very limited menu but the food is clean and delicious. I have tried lots of pho and this pho is very different. I'm so use to seeing a layer of fat floating on top of the soup but there is barely any fat in this delicous beef pho. I drank this soup without adding any hoisin/shiracha sauce (which is what I normally do when I eat pho). Their grilled pork bahn mi was very good. It was a good size and it taste fresh. The meat wasn't tough, it had really good flavor. I don't even like bahn mi that much but I would go back for this. We need more places like this. Definitely a huge fan.",5.0
"Had a quick lunch today, i called ahead and i ordered a lemon grass chicken banh mi sandwhich. I was hungry and very much looking forward to it. The bread had a nice crunch not exactly a baguette more like an Italian bread but flaky and light. The usual suspects, pickled carrots, daikon, cilanto and jalapenos. However, the chicken was not grilled, it was more like sauteed and there was a sauce on the chicken it self as well. Good sandwhich but not good enough to be called a banh mi. I dont think i would have it again. I had the pork an the pork banh mi was better. Going to try the rice dishes next time. Good change of pace for a quick lunch.",3.0
"Welcome to the neighborhood!This simple, clean, and most importantly delicious addition to the area is awesome. So awesome that after I ordered one thing, I went back later the same day to try something else. That's the beef pho to start followed the lemongrass chicken. I recommend them both!UPDATE: tried the Bahnmi, total win. Very large with bread that was crispy on the outside, yet incredibly delicate. Fillings were top notch. Flavor was great.",5.0
"Delicious! What a lovely, clean, quaint place and they serve you in real bowls, not plastic. I had the tofu Bun dish, so flavorful and fresh",5.0
Welcome to the neighborhood!Ah! I was so excited to try this place as soon as I saw it because they serve two of my favorite things: lemongrass chicken bahnmi and pho! They were both so rich in taste and PHOnomenal ! Seriously. This is definitely one of the better restaurants in the area and the food tastes so so authentic and the flavors will just leave you drooling (as I am wishing I had more). Thank you guys for blessing the neighborhood!,5.0
"small shop, with a few seats at the window, but vey cute interior. Very clean and bright!Pho was excellent! They had tofu, which is unusual, but good! I enjoyed my pho a lot on a snowy day. The portion looked small, but it wasn't and was just right. My boyfriend had the beef pho and loved it as well. Staff is very friendly!!",5.0
"The ingredients: incredibly fresh and the highest of quality. The service: thoughtful, kind, meets the highest of standards. The food: you'll pinch yourself to see if you are dreaming. We live down the street and thank our lucky stars that Ngon moved into our neighborhood. It is our go to place now. We had several of the Banhmis and they were all perfect. The pho is delicious. The broth fragrant and elegant. I went in there today and sat in their comfortable seating area waiting for our to-go order. As I heard friendly voices in the back intermingled with laughter, I felt so good knowing that my food wasn't just prepared with care but it was prepared by people who love what they do. You can taste that. Our meal was generous, affordable (such good ingredients at such wonderful prices), and the whole experience was impeccable. Ngon, please say you'll never leave us!Stranger, please do your belly a favor and enjoy the goodness of this sweet family establishment.",5.0
"So glad Ngon is in the neighborhood, eat at this restaurant often and support great food and family businesses!!!UPDATE - We live in walking distance but they won't deliver to us. However, they deliver to the building next to us? Sadly I won't be able to eat here very often :(",5.0
"Finally! A great addition to the neighborhood! Friendly, family-run Vietnamese take-out with some counter seats for in-house casual dining. Can't wait to go back and order delivery all the time!",5.0
"Ngon lives up to it's name. It's pretty damn good.I'm Vietnamese, I'm from Cali and I can cook. I was really pleased to see Ngon is run by a Vietnamese family. I ordered the pho ga (chicken), com tam and steak banh mi. The banh mi is bigger than average, about the size of a hero. All were delicious. If you're craving good Vietnamese food without any frills, this place will definitely satisfy you. I just discovered this place today and will be a repeat customer for sure.",5.0
"I had just gotten back from an incredible two week vacation in Vietnam in mid January to happily discover that a Vietnamese place had finally come to the neighborhood. I've since eaten here (both eat in and delivery) a few times and have enjoyed it vey much every time. Just had their pho for the second time -- it's very fresh and flavorful with a strong, clean broth. I think it has actually improved since the first time I ate it. The broken rice is also good. Looking forward to trying their Banh Mi and Bun dishes.",5.0
"Such a cute place!  We ordered the chicken pho and steak bahnmi sandwich and a rice dish whose name escapes me.  Everything was delicious, fresh and healthy; service friendly.",5.0
"Big fan of Ngon after trying it this past week. We even took the pho to go and they packed it very nicely. The soup was still warm when we got home and the broth was extremely flavorful! I would definitely order again. Also want to note that the restaurant itself is very small and only has a counter to eat at, so take out or delivery is probably a better option.",4.0

"Excellent in every way.  The only dish I've had is the Chicken Pho, and I can't get away from it.. I've ordered it at least 4 times.  It's very pure on the palate and has the authentic taste of a homemade meal.  The broth is outstanding in a subtle way, non-oily, not over seasoned, and smooth; the chicken too.  The ingredients are fresh and the service is quick, patient, and friendly.  Can't wait try the rest of what they offer!",5.0
"Their pho is totally delicious!  Not greasy, clean and nice-looking chicken.  I have been craving something like this in the neighborhood for 5 years and lo and behold, Ngon appeared one day on Park Avenue - a sight for sore eyes.My expectations were surpassed with their totally authentic and traditional ginger and star anise broth.  One of the best I have had - this place is the real deal.Best addition to the neighborhood and look forward to working my way through their menu.",5.0

"Oh hell yes. In a neighborhood stuffed with mediocre Thai and Japanese, this restaurant is a blessing. The lemongrass chicken banh mi was on point (light and crunchy baguette, incredibly flavorful meat, fresh veg) and I'm stoked to try everything else on the menu. Delivery was quick, prices are more than reasonable. The interior is clean and modern but seating is limited--i'm guessing they're more of a delivery/takeout spot.

"I'm so happy we have a great pho and banhmi place in the neighborhood!!

"Just had pho and bahn mi at Ngon on the corner of Adelphi and Park in Ft. Greene. Delicious! Delicately flavored but hearty pho with fresh veggies and plenty of meat and noodles. Bahn mi on baguette with just the right amount of crunch and more fresh and crispy veggies. Really appreciated that nothing was salty. Tried the traditional bahn mi, definitely will go back to try the other versions (there were 3 or 4 choices) and their other offerings. Service was sweetly courteous, an added bonus. What a find!",5.0
