Got three tacos for $5 - cheap as chips! We were ridiculously starving and devoured our tacos in 5 seconds.Must come back for more!,5.0
"A yummy taco truck located in the busy Sunset Park area. It is usually parked right in front of the Nike Factory store. They offer a wide variety of meats from the typical chicken, beef, and lengua; some special ones like pastor and pig's ear just to name a few. Tortas and burritos are also available. It's a bargain!I went with my favorite lengua and pastor. Lengua, also known as cow's tongue, it sounds really weird but the meat is so tender and so flavorful. It is really the most perfect meat for a taco. I get pastor tacos at almost every taco spot. Pastor is gyro style pork. The meat is quite tasty with their style of seasoning. Perfectly charred taste to finish off with. YUM! Chicken and beef are safe choices and they are good too but go explore! Every taco is topped with diced onions and cilantro. Red beets and a grilled green leak right on top with limes on the side. Add-on the spicy green sauce and avocado sauce. There you go, a delicious taco waiting for you to devour!",4.0
"Pretty decent! Came right when they opened for a small snack - tried both the Pastor (pork) and chorizo tacos. They come with cucumbers, a wedge of lime and radishes on each plate. For $1.75, they're in the middle in terms of value. I liked the chorizo better because I feel like there was more flavor.",4.0
"You'll find them on 5th ave and 54th st. Can't miss it as you'll see the large crowd by the truck. Quality ingredients and sold with accompanying cucumbers and radishes. Super authentic. Great price as well.Go for the al pastor, lengua, and chorizo. The al pastor has nice flavor and pieces of pineapple and is made in their own style gyro method and then crisped up on the flat stove. For sure ask for extra green sauce. The green sauce is a great accompaniment with the tacos. Nice amount of kick.",4.0
"I'm always afraid to buy street food, but the tacos were actually very juicy and fresh. Large variety of fillings. As my taste it's not a lot meat inside, but overall I liked",4.0
"I guess they got the point and started having birria all the time. They also do enough business that the al pastor spit is in constant rotation, as it should be.This is about as close to the tacos in Mexico City as you'll find in Sunset Park. But would it kill them to have somebody making tortillas a mano?",5.0
"I have passed this truck many a day, so decided to give them a try. Ordered a pastor burrito and 2 asada tacos.The burrito was quite nice in size and very tasty. The flavors were muy bien with the rice and meat, with a dash of some home made hot sauce.But when I opened the asada tacos there was no cebolla (onion) and the lime was non-exsistent. Really there was like 2 tiny pieces of lime about half of a half piece of lime. When I squeezed the little piece of lime I think I got 2 drops of lime juice like WTF!!!The tacos were limp to say the least ugggh really sad not even hot!!! I have had much better elsewhere at the same price, and there was very little meat. You get what you pay for its only $1.75 per taco.",3.0
"Tacos are $1.75..My brother suggested this place after the usual taco spot I frequent took the night off and I really really wanted some tacos.   When we arrived, there were already a few people out either waiting for their food or eating their food.   We were wondering how big their tacos were when someone, who was waiting for his food, told us how big it was, about 3"" in diameter.   I ordered the beef and carnitas and my sis-in-law ordered beef and chicken, to go.   When we got home, we saw that it also came with a small whole grilled onion, a small container of green salsa/hot sauce, another small container of pico or pickled tomato/onions/jalapenos?, sliced cucumbers and radishes.  The radishes reminded me of a taco place that I went to in LA (yelp.com/biz/carnitas-mi…) I am used to the way Taco Bell sells their tacos, so radishes on the side was kind of weird but in a good way.  They have two types of hot sauce, the mild one that's not spicy at all, in my opinion....and another that is darker green, which is a bit spicier...I definitely like this place but it is a bit pricier for me.  Two of these tacos(size wise) equals to one of the tacos from my usual spot.  I will still go to this place if I am craving tacos and my other taco truck isn't there....",4.0
"I go to the truck on 39th and 9th on the corner where the D line subway stop is. These are the freshest, fastest most reasonably priced food items anywhere in the area. Drop by and grab 2 or 6 :).",5.0
"Tacos Los Poblanos is between 53 and 54th street in 5AVE In Brooklyn. The tacos are small, so you would need about 4+ to actually full you up. Hands down, They have the best tacos in the neighborhood!!  They open usually around 7PM-1:30AM  7 days a week. Sometimes it can get busy but trust me, the wait is so worth it! Everything on their menu is fresh and highly tasty. I promise you, you'll be coming back for some more. ALSO , THEY DELIVER !  I BELIEVE ITS MIN OF $10. 1347 641 2092 is their delivery number.",5.0
"It's still pretty damn good tacos! same menu and choices.still located by the bus stop on 52nd street! love the fact wait is never too crazy here!one star reduction for cutting the meat and condiments, they also increased a quarter in price, which is fine w me, just don't reduce the amount of carnitas in my taco!",4.0
"This is now my go to place for tacos at Sunset Park.  Hell, it is even my current go to place for tacos for all of NYC, beating out some very stiff competition from Queens and even my previous favorite, Tacos El Bronco.  If anyone want to try quality authentic tacos, which some people didn't believe NYC carries, they need to come to trucks like these in the outer Boroughs. Real tacos doesn't really use cheese and sour creams.  No, really, they don't.  They bell have been lying to you all these years.Open daily from 6 pm to 2 am, this taco truck caters mostly to the Spanish speaking locals but English is doable if you find the right worker to take your order.  All their tacos costs only $1.50 each, beating out even the already cheap Tacos El Branco truck which charges $1.50 to $1.75 depending on the taco.  The tacos are a bit on the small size but at that price point, you could easily buy more than one.  I usually buy 6 to 8 at a time, each one a different filling.  Yea, I'm a glutton.Each taco comes with a double layer of tortilla, cilantro, chosen filling, raw onions, and depending on the tacos, wedges of limes, slices of radishes, and slices of cucumbers are provided as accompanying items.  If your order is big enough, say about 3 to 4 tacos, this place also provides small whole grilled onions including the stem  which I really like.So far, I have tried almost all their fillings and find them all to be delicious.  If I had to recommend some, then definitely try out their lengua (tongue) taco and their tripe taco if those ingredients doesn't make you squeamish.For toppings and condiments, the truck provides a mix of chopped onions, cactus, peppers, and herbs in a container by the ordering window.  They also have a red spicy salsa and a green salsa.  I am so in love with their green salsa here. I practically smother my tacos with it. Yum!!!The place also sells soups and burritos according to the menu on the side of the truck but I haven't tried those myself and I have yet to see anyone eat anything outside of the tacos here so far. One warning.  The tacos should be eaten immediately or soon after ordering.  The tortilla doesn't seem to stay together well from the moisture of the fillings, becoming a bit crumbly after a few hours and breaking apart when you hold it up to eat.",5.0
"A worthy competitor to Tacos El Bronco, Tacos Los Poblanos is a treat in our Sunset Park West neighborhood. It's tostadas are fantastic (recommend spicy chicken), tacos are great, and burritos are tasty/solid. This food truck's line is typically 4 or 5 people deep, thanks to the quality of the food and reasonable prices.",4.0
"I ordered the beef tongue and pastor tacos for delivery. It only took about 15 minutes for the tacos to be cooked and delivered! The beef tongue tacos were not the best I've had, but for the price that I paid it was excellent! The pastor was just so-so to me. As previous review had stated, the tacos were indeed kind of small. All in all, pretty good tacos for an extremely reasonable price!",4.0

"*blushing*I cheated.On Tacos el Bronco.With Tacos Los Poblanos.And I loved every bite of it. *breath of relief* There. I said it. Gosh...that felt so good to get off my chest.I don't care if the taco gods judge me!* I had been peddling/driving past Tacos Los Poblanos for the last 5 months and always kinda brushed it aside.

I kinda feel like my whole life was a lie up until the moment I found myself biting into a perfectly cooked asada taco from Los Poblanos. Just the right amount of flavor in those tender chopped pieces of beef. The perfect ratio of beef to onions to cilantro - all combined to make me finally realize something...I don't need Tacos el Charro in Seguin, TX anymore.*** I spent the last 6 years of my life hopelessly dreaming of those delicious Texas tacos all because I hadn't found an adequate comparison anywhere up and down 5th Avenue... until now.Tacos Los Poblanos you won me over. But you'll have to share me with Tacos el Bronco, because while your asada was off the chains and your al pastor was pretty good - I still love my Tacos el Bronco. Ya just can't toss aside a familiar face (or truck) all because of some really amazing asada tacos... Right?See ya soon... ;)-----*   I actually do care if the taco gods judge me.

"Having tried many of the taco places in Sunset Park this taco truck is one of the best ones. They give you 2 soft taco shells, a good amount of meat, top with onions and cilantro. On the side include lime, radish, cucumber, and grilled green onion. Their green and red sauce is just amazing. The only down side is that their menu is in Spanish, so I only get the ones I know such as pastor, suadero, and pollo (pork, beef, and chicken). They should have the English next to it. The best part is that is it only $1.50 per taco, which is juicy and flavorful. They also sell soda and other Mexican drinks that you can pick up in coolers.",5.0
"Delicious tacos for $1.50. I'm sold! Better than ones I've had at restaurants in the city. They're a little small but for the price, you'll still be full under $10. And the green sauce.
