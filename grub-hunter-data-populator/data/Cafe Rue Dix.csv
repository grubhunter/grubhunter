"It was around 6:30pm on a warm Tuesday in February (yesterday) when I walked into this dimly lit restaurant. There was only one other guest upon arrival so the tables were all fair game. My date and I were quickly greeted by a smiling and warm gentleman. He told us to sit wherever we wanted and handed us a few menus. So many things on the menu looked good but we finally decided on the bronzino with plantains and a pyramid of white rice for me and a burger with fries for her. I got a green juice and she got something that tasted like a green juice with rum, but better (you all know I don't appreciate alcohol).By the time we ordered, the restaurant had filled up a bit. Everyone seemed to be in good spirits and I'm going to assume it was partly because of the host/waiter who continued to be friendly and enthusiastic about all of his guests.The fish was spicy, which normally I wouldn't like, but it tasted so fresh and was cooked so well that I hardly minded. I literally left a pile of bones on my plate. My juice also tasted fresh despite the waiter telling me that it was pre-made when I asked if I could concoct my own special juice blend. I would have never known if he didn't say anything. The burger was cooked as ordered and the fries were crispy and plentiful. I was so satisfied with the meal that I actually forgot about dessert. That does not happen often. Not surprisingly enough, my date reminded me that we hadn't had ice cream in a while, so we stopped at a supermarket and met up with our friends Ben & Jerry on the way home.The prices here are a bit higher than other places in the area, but they're worth it.",5.0
"Always passed this on my way home, but never got a chance to stop in. Finally had dinner here over the weekend.The restaurant had a small, intimate feel to it. Very cozy and you sit very close to your neighboring diners. The host was not immediately obvious and brusque once acknowledged. This would be one of the things I would change about the restaurant. My friend and I started off dinner with Fataya, spicy beef empanadas. My friend had the special, beef stew with spices and peanut butter, which reminded me of peanut butter stew my mom used to make from our country. Plenty of food and well-enjoyed! I got the Dibi Sengal, grilled lamb and onions with rice and plantains. Nicely grilled and well-seasoned. The food took a while to come out but the was definitely worth the wait. Lastly, our drinks were amazing! We both ordered Jardin de Senegal, with hibiscus, white rum, etc. sweet and well-mixed.Definitely going back for seconds!!!",4.0
"$35ish for 2 people for brunch, but not worth a return or recommendation given the service. Nice but pretty unmemorable duck confit (the only Senegalese touch seemed the sharp hot sauce on ths side) and the green eggs & salmon, which had that in spades. VERY slow service, and clearly understaffed (with both existing staffers seeming inexperienced).Instead of the Wednesday night $29 three-course, all-Senegalese prix fixe (at least that was the price & deal as of their 2014 NYT Hungry City column), we stopped in for brunch and were seated at the only available table, a 2-top near the curtained door where people entering and being turned away kept bumping into us.

"To echo a fellow Yelper's review, you really do have to be adventurous because Senegalese coffee is DEFINITELY an acquired taste. Trust that you've never had anything like it before. Imagine a strong, dark roast mixed with the aftershave balm of an older European gentleman. I finished with great effort, but it was worth the experience of having tried this exotic blend. It also had the added benefit of keeping me awake for hours into the night. My friend and I shared the bread pudding, which was everything I needed that afternoon - warmth, comforting rich flavors and companionship. Coupled with the coziness of our conversation, I longed for a couch to take in the ambiance as the lights dimmed and dinner began to be served. I can't wait to go back for Senegalese supper.",4.0
"Great, great vibe for a small neighborhood bar/restaurant. Their cuisine is unique and made with a lot of interesting,bold flavors. Darker, romantic feel which creates for intimacy in the slightly crowded seating arrangement.",4.0
"Best bread pudding EVER! It was so moist and soft, I couldn't believe it. I would come back just to order 10 bread puddings for myself.",4.0
"My friends and I stumbled upon this gem after the brunch spot at which we were trying to eat had an absurd wait time. Though the service was on the slow side, I was impressed with the diverse menu and fun drinks (cilantro lemonade, cucumber lemonade, rose lemonade). We started with a baguette with house made orange marmalade that was perfection. Afterwards (but kind of simultaneously since the bread took so long to come out), I got the huevos rancheros which was delicious but had a spin. It was served over nachos, the cheese was French tasting, and the combination of the sauces hit me with more spice than other huevos rancheros. I would order this meal again. My friends both enjoyed their food as well and the (very loud) table next to us practically licked their plates clean. The ambience felt like a small European cafe, but it was very crowded. My group's table was adjoined to another group's table. So close that the man next to me and I could bump elbows. Our table partially blocked one of the entries.I wish I could give half stars here because I feel a 3.5 would be perfect for the experience. The space is small and can get loud/crowded, but I believe that if you can find the right time to eat here that it could be a 4/5 star experience.",4.0
"The menu spans the former Empire Francais, but the decor is a classic neighborhood French bistro. This means dining on these Senegalese classic thiéboudienne one small, candle-lit tables in the near darkness.It's a combination that works. As ever with bistro dining, it's the small details that separate the also-rans from the worthy. The chimichurri in the steak sandwich, the spices on the plantains.Service was friendly and prompt. The waitress asked if we wanted a glass with our ciders, but didn't provide ice in the glass. Was the mistake an Anglo-Saxon bias on our sort or a slip of the establishment? Something to debate, but not let overtake, the rest of our meal.",4.0
Cafe Rue Dix is one of my favorite places in Crown Heights - the food is wonderful and the drinks are strong. I'd recommend the prime rib? sandwich! The meat is so tender - you'll be sad when this sandwich ends!The drinks are always really good and strong! The service can be a tad slow but it's worth it!,5.0
"My boyfriend & I came here on a beautiful Saturday night & got a table outside. Drinks - I started with the Bohemian which was good & my boyfriend had the Nameless which was so good & refreshing. I liked it better then my drink & I ended up getting it as my second drink. We started with the spring rolls which were tastey & different but probably not something I would order again.Ok entrees...everything sounded good but i got the branzino. It was absolutely delicious!! The fish itself is such a nice portion it could be shared with two people. Lots of bone in this fish as you may or may not know (I didn't know, first time having this type of fish) so be carefull. Came with white rice & like 5 platanos maduros. My boyfriend had the lamb dish - I think its called Dibi or something like that - & this was delicious as well. Generous amount of lamb which is so juicy & tender. Also came with white rice & platanos maduros. Solid food and drinks along with great, tentative service - 5 stars without a doubt",5.0
"It is small and cozy, and it is very dark during dinner time, which I wish it wasn't so that we could see our food.  Food *is* yum.  We thought we ordered too much, but the flavors were great that we almost finished our dishes.  The staff is very friendly and we didn't feel rushed at all.Too bad it's kind of far, but I think it's still worth the trekking.",4.0
"I'm so happy I came across this. It's just a couple blocks from mine and it's so amazing for brunch. My friend got the crepe which was a little weird looking because it looked like a donut but it tasted divine. I was happy with the healthier options they had available, I got the veggie sandwich with a side salad which was tasty and filling. The mimosas were made with freshly squeezed juice and were refreshing. I look forward to coming back here.",5.0
"I love this place!I love the atmosphere, in the summer it's cute and airy with the doors open, in cooler weather it's more cozy. And the food is delicious. The coffee is good, as is the Bohemian Omelette, french toast, and the shrimp linguine. The kale zinger is good too (ask for parmesan) The portion sizes are perfect. My friend lives nearby (and now I live not too far), it's a great place for brunch or an early dinner. They don't get 5 stars because the service is always very slow, no matter the time of day or how many people are there.",4.0
Great authentic Senegalese food!A bit spicy  for my test but loved every bite.Service was extremely friendly and good!,4.0
"I am so glad this place exists! One of my favorite worldly cuisines is Senegalese. I used to get my fix in Harlem, but sadly the establishments I used to frequent have mostly disappeared. Cafe Rue Dix is my saving grace.I came here on Saturday with my wife and a friend, just in time to get an hour's worth of happy hour. The bartender was fantastic! She was friendly, attentive, and fast (service I'm not used to from the hipster elite). She even asked if we wanted a final round during happy hour as it was ending in 10 minutes. That also doesn't usually happen. We ordered the fries and ""Roquefort sauce"" to soak up all the wine we were pounding. The fries were perfectly crispy and seasoned just right. BUT. That was no Roquefort sauce. That was cold blue cheese from a bottle. It wasn't warm and mixed with cream, and certainly not worth the extra $2.50. When it was time to be seated for our reservation, she recommended a fantastic bottle of South African red, that passed the taste test with flying colors. That girl is a freakin' winner. Our server had the biggest smile and was a huge jokester. We ordered the Dibi Senegal and steak frites. THEY WERE DELICIOUS. This is what I've been waiting for! The rich Senegalese flavors and French technique are just everything. The rice was cooked perfectly (I'm Latina, that's kind of a big deal), the lamb was juicy and flavorful, the steak tender and chimichurri perfectly refreshing. It took us quite a while to get our wine from the bar, a little over ten minutes, but I was already tipsy and distracted by the food, so I didn't even care. For dessert we shared the profiteroles and bread pudding, and they were a great way to end the night! The bread pudding was the clear winner. Romantic and exotic, this place is essential in a sea of American contemporary restaurants. I can't wait to come back. But hopefully when I do, they'll have improved their ""Roquefort sauce"".",4.0
Warm inviting low key dining with friendly staff. An oasis French bistro with nice happy hour 4-7 and enough room if you go before 6;) will continue to patronize this gem of an establishment,4.0
"Went here on my 21st birthday and had an amazing time! The staff is so incredibly friendly and they went out of their way to make my evening special. I ordered the salmon dish and it was delicious and well-seasoned. The drinks are a little pricy but they definitely don't make them weak! Out waitress was very nice but a little slow. It was very busy, though, so I understand. Maybe adding an additional server per shift would help. Would absolutely return!",5.0
"This cafe, bar, and restaurant hits nearly every mark. Service is always kind and attentive, they have a great happy hour menu, and the food is amazing.I haven't tried everything yet but I highly recommend the Moules Frites (that broth! ) the Cheeseburger (ask for the Senegalese hot sauce- it's so flavorful and fresh), the cheese board, the hummus vert, the Michelada, the Kale Hemingway, and for brunch the Salmon Omelette. They also have a full espresso bar and some delicious natural pistachio ice cream. I've taken friends, parents, and friends' parents here and it's loved unanimously. The space is also gorgeous, down to every detail. Great place for a date or for going solo as the floor-to-ceiling windows are perfect for people watching!",5.0
"I love Cafe Rue Dix. If it wasn't a ten minute bike ride uphill, this would be a problem!  I would be here all the time!  So far I've been here several times for brunch. Cafe Rue Dix is quaint and well-decorated. The food is amazing and decently priced. I especially love the Bohemian omelet. My word! So good!  I always bring my appetite and clear my plate when eating here. Their drinks are well made as well. I usually get the Bloody Maria, but have also tried their other brunch drinks.  Service is great. The staff is very friendly and welcoming. I will be back for brunch and would like to try their happy hour/dinner as well.",5.0
"Love, love, loved it!-Beautiful decor and relaxing ambiance for brunch-Crepe Monsieur (crepe with ham, cheese and a fried egg with greens on the side) was absolutely delicious  -Tea was served loose-leaf in an individual teapot, gourmet tea -Splurge for the fresh squeezed oj! -Service was friendly",5.0
