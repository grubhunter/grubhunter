"The food at this place is always delicious. I've frequented Werkstatt a handful of times in the last few months, and I have never been disappointed in the least. I've come for brunch and dinner and I can't even tell you which was better. Neither was better because the food at this place is always delicious. Oh, I'm sorry did I say that already?What should you order from here? Probably one of each or 2 of each if you're with a friend. Don't get me wrong, portions are filling, but since you'll be sitting so long trying to decide on your dish, you may as well just try it all. Every choice is a good choice. The flavors, the textures, the atmosphere and the ambiance is all spot on. I also had my last birthday here which was about 3 months ago. I reserved the long table in the back by the fireplace. The waitress we had was very attentive without hovering. She had a smile on the whole time, even when I bugged her to take some pictures of our group. I couldn't have asked for a better experience. Is it possible this place gets better? Well it does. As some of you know, I know nothing about alcohol except that it makes me feel all funny inside. I typically don't like the taste of anything with alcohol unless I can't taste the alcohol. But if it's time for brunch and you're in the mood for a Bloody Mary, you need to try this one. Not only do I like the taste of it, you may even find me drinking 1/3 of it. (Seriously though, a drink of alcohol to me means tilting the glass so that it drips on my lip and then licking my lip. Me and alcohol.....we just don't understand each other.In conclusion, eat here. You will not be sorry.",5.0
"When I saw an Austrian restaurant pop up in our neighborhood map a few months ago, I was convinced it was a tech glitch and moved on. Fast forward 6 months and what comes up on a short walk from our apartment? This place! Walked in on a Sunday evening, my wife and I sat at the bar in lieu of waiting for a table. Dan, the bartender, came right over and a wonderful evening ensued. 1 Manhattan (with Bullet, their regular is Makers beware), 1 Werkstatt cocktail which is so dangerous. Tastes like boozy grapefruit. Ordered the chicken schnitzel and the Spetzle. Both came with great sides, really great. Potatoes, cucumbers that had been marinated, cabbage, and a bit of salad. We cleaned our plates.Kudos to these pioneers, keeping it simple and low key to match the the neighborhood they are serving so well. Will be back soon!",5.0
"I commend these guys for being pioneers and opening on Coney Island ave, for  building such an elaborately cute space and for doing something goddamn different. Yes I love pizza but it's not the only thing that's getting me through the door. The schnitzels are delicious. Have tried a bunch of the bar snacks too. Also good Nice draft beer choices- had a black beer which was new for me. Was surprisingly light despite the color and characteristics",4.0
"Came here for valentine's dinner with my wife.  Parking was easy to find.  Small little restaurant with nice decor that kind makes you forget you are in new york city. Had their chicken liver terrine and pan fried brussels sprouts for appetizers and beef gulasch and pork filet wellington.  The chicken liver terrine was delicious.  Not too salty and was flavorful.  The brussels sprouts were a little too oily and tasteless.  The beef gulasch was good.  The beef was tender and flavorful.  The spatzle was interesting.  Really like the texture and kind of like pasta.  The pork filet wellington was pretty unique.  The pork was moist and tender.  The pastry puff kind of fell apart but if you put it back together with the pork, it tastes something out of the ordinary.  In the end we with with the chocolate cake for dessert.  Not too sweet and had a texture similar to a brownie.Overall, this is a unique little restaurant.  Food is above average.  Service is fast and friendly.  But note that they only take cash or american express credit cards",4.0
"LOVE the decor and atmosphere with this place. They do a really great job of transporting you to Austria. Definitely feels authentic and the food is, well; delicious.Came on a sunday. they have a brunch deal for $15 which comes with a cocktail (i had a generous glass of bloody mary, they also have grapefruit beer!), coffee and a breakfast entree. I had the green eggs and ham. the boyfriend had a sausage and egg dish. But, of course, we over ordered and ALSO got a GIANT PRETZEL AND BRUSSEL SPROUTS. do yourself a favor and get the brussel sprouts. it's delicious. i can eat 3 bowls of it. the brunch dishes were all solid, but the brussel sprouts stood out for sure. i'll be back to try other items! (Schnitzel, bratwurst and goulash spaetzle)",5.0
"The quality of the food is that of a much more expensive restaurant. In fact, in all my years of ordering flan and creme brûlée, which is my favorite type of dessert, the creme caramel at Werkstatt was the best I've ever had. We got a few appetizers to start, all of which were delicious, so I just had a chicken liver pate for my main course. This was great because everyone else at the table wanted some, and then more after they'd had a bite, so I got to taste many main courses in exchange. They were all delicious. One that surprised me the most was the paprika chicken, which was done perfectly. I shouldn't be surprised though because Thomas is such an acclaimed chef. Everything he does is top quality. The grapefruit beer that was recommended was delicious as well. Now I have to go in search of that, a challenge for sure. Finally, the neighborhood was a big surprise. Who knew that there was a square mile of mansions with front lawns and picket fences right in the middle of Brooklyn. It's worth going there just to see that.",5.0
This was a really nice find for a group of us on a cold day between soccer games in prospect park. When you walk in it looks like a small bar with about 15 tables and a bar but they have a back room with wood burning stove heating the room. The atmosphere was perfect. I had bratwurst with sauerkraut and potato which was excellent. The goulash looked delicious and I was sorry I didn't take up my friends offer to taste it but it's just an excuse to go back. The liver pate was a great appetizer. All washed down with a really spicy Bloody Mary! I wasn't even through my first bite when I was already planning a revisit. What a hidden gem.,5.0

"Ditmas Park is changing fast, and there's no better way for a neighborhood to announce that it's a cultural hotspot, relevant and modern other than with its own Austrian restaurant with draft beer and wine. Yes, WINE ON TAP and it's exactly what Brooklyn and I needed. On opening night we had the chicken schnitzel and home made bratwurst. Both were well prepared, but I've got schnitzel on my mind. It surprised me with how good it was from first bite. Thin, breaded cutlets of chicken lightly fried then piled on top of each other. Two could easily share a plate and be satisfied as you get about 3-5 substantial slices of schnitzel in one serving.The owners, Robin and Thomas, were nice enough to let us see the space and sample the beer before opening day. It was the first time I had a stout. Theirs is almost creamy with distinct notes of chocolate with no bitterness. The grapefruit beer is made with about 3% alcohol, also super light, fruity, and delicious. These beers make for great brunch drinks because of their lightness, so you can start drinking as early as you can get there.The only way to end anything good is with sweetness. For dessert, if I can have a strudel, I most likely always will. This strudel does not meet standards. It does not satisfy. It by far surpasses all expectations... baked fresh and served warm with a side of cream. You do yourself a disservice if you eat here and don't get it. You do yourself a disservice if you don't drop by at all.",5.0

"Werkstatt is a neighborhood staple. Cant beat the happy hour special -$5 draft beer and wine 5-7pm during the week (big beers at that!) Brunch is also a killer deal $15 bucks with a drink and coffee. Fills up quickly on the weekends, so make a reservation. They can cater to large parties in the back room that feels like an extension of your living room, so cozy and welcoming.

"The following statement is possibly the greatest compliment I have ever paid to a restaurant/eatery. The matzoh ball soup almost tastes like my grandmother made it. I've eaten matzoh ball soup my whole life, it is easily a top 5 food for me. Everyone in my family makes it, including myself and I have never ever paid for matzoh ball soup anywhere and thought it was comparable to home made. That includes Jewish delis and diners. I'd come back for the soup alone  Otherwise, the place is real nice and slightly out of place on Coney Island ave. The service was just fine and environment was nice as well. The pretzel was good but I was not a fan of the cheese dip. The schnitzel was crispy and tender, but I didn't like the sides. Bland potatoes and cucumbers. I also tried the goulash, and was not impressed. Maybe I'm not the best person to review this place. It serves  the food I grew up with and that's set some really high standards.",3.0

"I went to Werkstatt on opening night just for a quick drink. In short, it seems ambitious for the area, but I'm glad it's here.Full OCD rant mode on, here's the thing that has bothered me since they published their menu: if you bill yourself as an Austrian restaurant, you can't call a pork-based schnitzel ""Wiener Schnitzel"". Wiener Schnitzel is by its very definition made from veal. This is the national food of Austria! If it is pork, then it is at best a ""Schnitzel Wiener Art"" (Viennese style schnitzel), or ""Schnitzel vom Schwein"". There is more leniency around this rule in Germany, but no one would argue that Germans would uphold the sanctity of naming standards for the capital of a neighboring country. Okay, I'm done now.So, Werkstatt is on the pricier side for Ditmas Park verging on Kensington, as indicated by the prices up to $18 for entrees and the $12 cocktails. These are prices I'd expect in Manhattan, but here?Since I had already eaten, this was just a cursory 1-drink visit, and maybe a chance to catch a glimpse of this faux Wiener Schnitzel in the wild. I had the $13 gin and tonic(!). That's a Reisetbauer Blue Gin with Fever Tree on the rocks. It was too juniper forward for me, but I had to order it - such a curious choice for the most expensive cocktail on the menu.The venue is actually much nicer than I anticipated from peeking in the windows previously. A decent number of four-tops in the main room where the bar is (which also functions as a very tight waiting area when crowded), and the back room is more of a beer hall atmosphere with a long picnic-table style beer hall table in the middle for groups or shared seating. There are some outdoor two-tops by the beer hall area, but apparently that wasn't open this opening night.The mussels ($12) seemed popular with the opening night crowd. As a previous resident of Central Europe and frequent visitor to Vienna, I can say the food looked very authentic and high quality. I didn't see the faux Schnitzel, sadly. I'll go back for sure.

"OK, I might be a little prejudice, because I went to law school with one of the owners (or managers, whatever she is), who helps run this place.  There is a wine bar her in the true sense of the word.  There aren't too many that have the same feel, and it is up there with one of my favorites from Brooklyn, as well as one in Sidney, one in Mnahattan, and one, which happens to be in Jersey City.  It is pretty unique.I love some of the appetizers - though some are a little more creamy then some people might like.  Ask your server about it, if you have any questions.I will let others speak to the entrees, including schnitzel, which has already been reviewed.  The food here is great, but I cannot say I am one to be reviewing German entrees.  Just saying.Finally, the dessert is phenomenal.  I would personally recommend their Linzer torte, with hazelnut, although there are several other crepes and desserts - often mostly with some kind of fruit or compote - that you will greatly enjoy.  Talk to your server about how to pair it with a dessert wine.  There is a particular dessert wine - a white - that really explodes the taste of all these desserts.If you have any issues, talk to Robin, and say Ezra sent you.  Again, just saying!  The table by their wood-burning stove is the very best, though they have some beautiful tables by the bar.  Highly recommended!",5.0

"OK, I might be a little prejudice, because I went to law school with one of the owners (or managers, whatever she is), who helps run this place.  There is a wine bar her in the true sense of the word.  There aren't too many that have the same feel, and it is up there with one of my favorites from Brooklyn, as well as one in Sidney, one in Mnahattan, and one, which happens to be in Jersey City.  It is pretty unique.I love some of the appetizers - though some are a little more creamy then some people might like.  Ask your server about it, if you have any questions.I will let others speak to the entrees, including schnitzel, which has already been reviewed.  The food here is great, but I cannot say I am one to be reviewing German entrees.  Just saying.Finally, the dessert is phenomenal.  I would personally recommend their Linzer torte, with hazelnut, although there are several other crepes and desserts - often mostly with some kind of fruit or compote - that you will greatly enjoy.  Talk to your server about how to pair it with a dessert wine.  There is a particular dessert wine - a white - that really explodes the taste of all these desserts.If you have any issues, talk to Robin, and say Ezra sent you.  Again, just saying!  The table by their wood-burning stove is the very best, though they have some beautiful tables by the bar.  Highly recommended!",5.0
"Its an easy 5 stars! Came in for a Monday night dinner. Its Monday night special dinner menu and its great. Food was amazing. Drinks good. Waitstaff was friendly and Robin, the owner was also Very friendly. They are still trying to figure things out, make total sense.Give them a chance and visit ditmas park new addition. You will love the atmosphere here!!!",5.0
"Its a shame that I could not choose to sit at a 4 person table to eat and read this evening as opposed to the 20x20 2 seater against a shirt wall they offered. I would not have asked if it were a busy dinner rush but there was only 1 table seated eating dinner in the entire place. Quite disappointing. As a person who dines out regularly, I had looked forward to dining in my own neighborhood as I live 3 blocks away. Would you not want to please the customer you have before the ones you do not?",1.0
"The music was loud and bad.  I asked them to turn it down -  I was dining with my dad (who is 90 years old) he doesn't hear well.   The owner instead of turning it down - told me if I wanted the music to be turned down - I should rent the room. whaa?I should add - they were blasting ""Play that Funky Music White Boy"".The food was good but the evening was miserable - the music was so loud.The co-owner (his wife) tried to reason with me - ""We have to play the music loud otherwise the conversations get too loud.""  I told her the reason people talk so loud - is because they are talking over the music.Trust me - the restaurant was empty - we were there - my 90 year old dad, myself, my kids and one other 80+ couple.  No one in the room wanted to hear Play that funky white boy at any volume.  Every restaurant I go to with my dad - I ask them (nicely) to turn down the music - every time - folks are apologetic and turn it down immediately.  Here?  I got major push back and serious attitude.",1.0
"Interestingly enough this place opened just a few months after my partner and I had been in Vienna and Budapest for her Spring Break. We fell in love with Viennese cafe culture and the food. So Werkstatt was a very welcome addition to the neighborhood. Werkstatt is a great space with a comfortable layout and interesting decor. The staff is friendly and the service is great. Oh yeah, and the food is really really good. Would it be too much to ask that they also open a Viennese-style cafe nearby?",4.0

"Okay, we were there again Saturday night. It was crowded, which I was happy to see, but everyone was very happy, and the owners greeted everyone like valued guests. It was like a Brooklyn version of Cheers!The Austrian food continues to be amazingly good. The chef came up with an Austrian Fried Chicken which is quite wonderful. But don't sleep on the non-Austrian food. Thomas (the chef, with very impressive credentials) came up with an amazing Ramen noodle concoction. Not soupy, which is what I feared. Ramen with Beef and Veggies, and the noodles were meaty and delicious. The grapefruit beer continues to be delicious and addictive. The chicken liver dumpling soup (Leberknoedel?) was wonderful. I just wish I could have eaten more. There are so many things we missed out on! I want to try the house-made Bratwurst. I want the Giant Pretzel again. I want to try the Kielbasa and Calamari combination. I want to try the Chicken Liver Terrine. Guess we'll have to come back again.",5.0

"I did not know that in my area there is such a great place with very delicious German food and of course a super beer.I ordered a schnitzel, even my wife is not a big fan of meat said it was excellent. Very friendly staff. I think we had a favorite place, there will appear more often.",5.0

"Werkstatt is fantastic Austrian fare and you can really do no better in this regard than here. A chef with an impressive legacy, a series of rooms and space with attention to cool detail, and a staff that knows what they're doing and really cares about your overall experience.

Had a great brunch here with family that was in town visiting. I got the eggs & sausage w/ coffee & Schöfferhofer Grapefruit Beer.

"Came on a sunny pleasant Sunday before it got busy so my friend and I got to enjoy the sunshine with our grapefruit beer!I got the Werkstatt burger with bacon-onion marmalade (with fries as I had the option that day to get that). Burger was cooked medium as I ordered and the bun was of a croissant texture which made eating difficult as the juices slowly disintegrated the bun, still delicious! I'm a sucker for places that give pickles on the side :)Friend had the goulash which was a lacking in protein but still tasty. We should have switched our dishes as he would have been more full on my dish.I learned that I don't like pies or strudel adjacent desserts as I only the crusts and none of the fruit filling. The Linzer torte was great! The tartness combined with the sweetness of the whipped cream balanced each other out!Friend also got the coffee with the Francisco liquid? (Forgot the name...)

"I've been to Werkstatt a few times because  I live in the neighborhood, and I must say, being a German I know my German and Austrian dishes, and unfortunately Werkstatt couldn't deliver what I expected. Especially for the price points. I had better German food in other parts of Brooklyn and Manhattan. The pretzel is good, but average. The Rösti potatoes where blend, the goulash was ok and the Spätzle weren't anything special. The chicken liver terrine was good, just wish they would have toasted the bread a little. The best was the Apfel Strudel. They have beers and wine on draft. Staff is nice. Ambience feels very German. It gets pretty busy and a lot of kids. Especially on the weekend. I would only go back for drinks.",3.0

"We have gone to Werkstaat several times since it opened and we absolutely love everything about it. The service is very attentive (Robin and Thomas are fabulous hosts), and it's one of the coziest restaurants in the neighborhood (no mean feat being located on Coney Island Avenue). We really love the food. The last time we went I had a cheeseburger which was perfectly cooked (melted in my mouth) with a great side of potatoes. The red wine I ordered was a perfect complement to my dinner as were the Brussel sprouts. Amazing desserts. Oh and we didn't have to wait for a table on a Friday night which is surely not the case at Ox Cart (which we also like but can't stand the crowds). We loved Thomas' last restaurant (Beisl) across from BAM so are so happy to have them in our neck of the woods.",5.0
"came here shortly after they opened with a quite large group - everyone loved it, food and service were great and the interior is very appealing.I wish I could give it 5 stars, but with no Austrian beer on draft (or in a bottle, for that matter), I just can't.we'll be back soon, although it's not a bit of a trek for us.",4.0
Food was very good. Large portions. Pretzel is huge and yummy. Mussels were very good. Husband had the schnitzel he liked it I thought it had no taste.

"We had a wonderful experience here about a month ago. The food is absolutely outstanding. The pretzel is outrageous... never have I ever had such a large, soft, perfectly baked pretzel. It was enough for four people, but my partner and I ended up scarfing it down anyway! I had the cheese spaetzle and it was out of this world! Some of the best I've had and I've had my fair share of spaetzle in and outside of Germany. Bratwurst is outstanding as well... it tastes housemade and the accompaniments are delicious and a nice balance to all the heavy food. The only criticism I have is we were seated far, far in the corner of the back room right next to the window on what turned out to be the night of the 2016 blizzard. I stared longingly at the reserved table nearest to the fireplace that stayed vacated for nearly the entirety of our dinner. I wish we were seated at (or at least near) the fireplace because to be honest, I had to wear my coat the entire dinner and it made my experience less than stellar. However, now I know I will request / reserve the fireplace table for my next dining trip.",4.0
"Another find made by foodie friends. Came for brunch. We were seated immediately at 11am on a Saturday in a sunny back room. $15 for a ham, egg, creamed spinach and potato spread with coffee and a breakfast cocktail included (I had a tasty grapefruit beer). We spit a warm doughy, butter brushed pretzel that came with mustard and a cheese dip. The service was stellar, with water and coffee constantly refilled and plates cleared in short order. Loved the music too! Three hours later and I'm still pleasantly sated. Will have to make this a regular stop on my trips to New York. Be warned that they only take cash and Amex!

"5 stars!  My husband and I have been anticipating Werkstatt's grand opening and we were not disappointed!   Side note: to the person who gave a review without even tasting their food...if you want a cheaper menu option, you should contact the owner or send them a note!  Writing a Yelp review which has nothing to do with an actual dining experience is a bit out of place.  Back to our experience: we stopped in on a summer evening for dinner.  We got the pan fried Brussels sprouts as our appetizer which were absolutely delicious and generously portioned.  I got the trio plate for $12 which was again generously portioned and thus a steal (chicken liver, pork belly, and cheese with truffle oil).  My husband got the wiener schnitzel and a cider.  Everything was excellent and in my opinion fairly priced given the quality and portion sizes.  The owner, Robin stopped by and chatted with us a bit - she made us feel very welcomed and it was a nice touch to the whole experience.  The space is rustic and charming - we sat out on the patio but am already anticipating winters in the main dining room being super cozy.  We were too stuffed to eat dessert and I left with a doggie bag of my leftover super yummy liver which I used as a spread the next day.  I am very happy Werkstatt is in our neighborhood and can't wait to come back!",5.0
"Update:-Sunday's night grub was spectacular...wiener schnitzel and its accompaniments were authentic and unbelievably flavorful, and the beef goulash was a 5 star blowaway...every mouthwatering bite of the most tender brisket in a slow-simmered sauce left you wanting more...even with the spaetzle, it was satisfying but didn't not overwhelmingly filling...it was just right! -And now...the matzoh ball soup...it was off the charts, and made just like home but with that sophisticated flair only a chef will get right every time. They even served it in a bowl on a gold-lined plate (perhaps a Jewish new year touch)? You can't even get this at Essen down the road in Midwood, which cooks for volume, and not perfection. This is the real deal, and my only quip was the amount of perfect broth served with it, again, which was done completely correctly...the bowl was presented with half soup, half maztoh balls...again, it left me wanting more.-It'll be a place I'll head to for a beer and small plates or burger. The quality here is unmatched anywhere in the area, but the prices reflect it. If they do a 'gourmet' happy hour or eventually open for lunch when the public school and/or building finish construction, you bet I'll be there often because the price point will be a tad better, I suspect.  Its market is already there, but it will expand with time and slight price adjustments.Love you guys, if I can just say it, and we don't even know each other. Can't wait to come back with the whole family and lots of friends.______________We've got a wienerschnitzel!!! Can't stop thinking about this place! Off the beaten path, a place that answers the question so many ask (will Coney Island Ave ever turn?). -Outlier and sweet owners with impressive chef creds (for those who remember Cafe de Artistes on UWS) -A space so lovingly envisioned and welcoming that doesn't follow Cortelyou's design rules...look closely and you'll see a sophistication of grander proportions-A menu that really surprised...Monday night's $15/plate Austrian fried chicken and vegetable risotto with amazing Austrian sides made my summer--and it's the only thing they serve (chicken + veg option) that night of the week. -The beer on tap made my spouse's year...after returning to the present from a daydream in Austria, I think her most quotable quote was ""it's really great if you're looking for anything but craft. It's a larger pour, a 0.5l stein, with less alcohol content for $7,"" which to me meant it's there for taste and refreshment, especially in this humidity. (And they served that crazy delicious grapefruit beer that's ""all the rage in Berlin"" according to a friend who just returned from there.) But don't be fooled...this is going to be the coolest AND coziest hangout in Ditmas Park (and Kensington) once the sleet and snow return. Where else can you get a proper beef goulash and matzoh ball soup so close to home (or without going to Midwood) that'll blow your mind and leave you wanting more, more, more?!?",5.0
"Excellent Austrian neighborhood tavern.  Drop in after work, grab a Zweigelt and some chicken liver and then head home a little happier.  And they take Amex, awesome!",4.0
"I just went there and it was truly wonderful. From the Bibb Salad to the Beef Goulash (sp?) to the warm atmosphere to the great bartender and music. I will be coming back here at least once a month, it was so well-executed. Plus, the owners really make you feel welcomed. What a gem.",5.0

"Werkstatt is a wonderful addition to the neighborhood.  It sits on a lonely corner on CIA, but inside it's warm and inviting.  The bartenders are very attentive as are the owners. My friends and I have quickly become regulars. I've gone there up to three times a week.My favorite dish is the chicken terrine.  It's amazing.  I often get a trio of small plate items as well, trying out some speck and gorgonzola butter.  It's a good place to go for brunch has well.  Their Viennese creamed spinach with fried egg and rosti may not sound too great, but it's absolutely delicious.  All of the desserts I've tried are incredible also.I really like the decor, vibe and food here.  Big thumb's up!",5.0

"I came first on a Monday and had the ""Monday Chicken Special"" which is an entire half breaded and fried chicken with an assortment of salads! Could not even finish it, but it was delicious! And just 12 bucks! The owner went out of his way to engage his new customers the moment they walked in the door. The second time I ordered the Leberknodel Suppe, a broth with liver dumplings, which blew me away. Don't be scared by the name, try it! The Wiener Schnitzel, which i had yesterday, is clearly identified on the menu as made from pork loin, which I personally find tastier, more flavorful than veal. I found the space and the backroom, featuring a skylight, thoughtfully designed. We got a winner here.",5.0
"Werkstatt, an amazing Austrian restaurant and bar where many personalities gather to eat, drink and enjoy the new addition to Ditmas Park! This place is the new local ""go-to"" where the grapefruit beer flows like water :) The menu is fantastic but be sure to try the specials as Thomas will surprise your tastebuds with some of his culinary creativity.  The staff is extremely professional yet entertaining.

"This is a GREAT restaurant....from start to finish, everything was excellent.   The matzah ball soup would have made my mother weep it was so good, the brussell sprouts were divine...and the goulash was both authentic and delicious.  For dessert, the pancakes and crepes looked great, but we got the apple struddel  and it was perfect, warm and not too sweet.  The service was fast and friendly, the portions were generous.  They have managed to have authentic yet up-to-date viennese food with all kinds of current flavors and they also have other dishes you want like a burger and spaghetti.  This is a HUGE win for Ditmas Park.  And oh...they had the Mets game on at the cool bar in front...what could be better.",5.0
"For the people that have reviewed the restaurant without eating there -  you are missing out.  The food is simply excellent and the atmosphere is very comfortable and homey.  The chef obviously knows what he is doing.  From what I read about the Chef online, this guy has quite the resume.  Four of us had dinner at Werkstatt on Friday night, the day after the opening.  When going to a new restaurant on the 2nd day of business one must be cautious and keep an open mind.  Lucky for us they seemed to be well prepared and we had a really nice dining experience.  We were greeted by the owner and she has a great sense of humor and wonderful smile.  She was honest about the seating time and kept us laughing while we waited to be seated.  They naturally have lots of beer.  They have beer and wine on Tap and a delicious Sparkling French Rose for $29 a bottle that 2 of us shared.  For appetizers we all shared the mussels, brussel sprouts and mushrooms.  All were perfect cooked and the brussel sprouts were my personal favorite.  My husband (who is German) ordered the Wiener Schnitzel and thought it was great.  The menu clearly states it is Pork, so I don't know what the other reviewer was complaining about.  I do know he will eat his words after one bite.   I ordered the Beef Goulash (on recommendation from the table next to us and is the best I ever had) and our friends shared and loved the Cod Fish Tacos and a Burger.  We all shared 2 deserts - the Apple Strudel and the Kaiserschmarrn - which is a shredded pancake with raspberry compote and powdered sugar.  They were both delicious and nice size portions.   Before we left, the Chef came over to introduce himself and thanked us for coming - nice touch.I give Werkstatt really high marks - it's a winner.   We live in the neighborhood for 10 years and we will be regulars.  Our friends came in from Manhattan and said they can't wait to come back to try the items we didn't get order.",5.0
"Note: first yelp review in 4 years, so its really good. I wanted to love this place and i did. Jogged past this place the other night thought it looked sweet so i stopped in for dinner tonight. I rarely drink beer and eat heavy food but i was really hungry so i went for it and it was great. Got whitefish, pickled veg, goulash and a beer. Grew up with and Austrian-German best friend and this food brings it all back. Imagine it now. Its the middle of winter, you've been camping in the snowy Catskills for a few nights eating nothing but dehydrated food and drinking only water and instant black coffee. You drive back to your Brooklyn neighborhood with limited dinner options and get to sit down to a hot plate of thick german food and a tall beer. Paradise. Very nice. It was also nice to see lighter options such as salads and a nice wine list for occasions when you don't really deserve to treat yourself. The chefs wife introduced herself and was very sweet. Very good neighborhood spot I hope this place does well.",5.0
"I live in Manhattan and drove out to Brooklyn to try Werkstatt with 2 friends and my sister who happens to be a chef. The first part of our wonderful experience was just walking in to this warm, friendly place and taking in the decor. It is such a homey and fabulous atmosphere and clearly a lot of passion went in to the design. All of us tried different dishes on the menu and were actually debating whose was better. It was ALL fabulous! I myself had the Paprika Chicken which just melts in your mouth and the flavors were wonderful. My sister the chef tried several different dishes and loved everything!We had a wonderful time and I want to add that I don't drink alcohol and although they have a great wine and beer selection, they also have many unique and refreshing alternatives. The staff was friendly and the service was excellent.Can't wait to go back with friends and family.I also want to add that if you drive there, it is very easy to park in the evening.",5.0
"Amazing food, best sausage and sauer kraut, delicious soups, beers and wine, great service, best friendly atmosphere and a beautiful bar.

"Visited again last Friday night for dinner.  Endive salad could've done with a touch less dressing so as not to overpower all ingredients but excellent combination overall, Paprika Chicken (two small pieces of juicy thighs cooked in paprika sauce, very good), Beef Goulash (star of the night dish - tender pieces of beef cooked in full flavored sauce, excellent).  For dessert we had the Apple Strudel (again) however, it was not as good this time.  Strudel was not warm/hot in the center or crisp like it was during our last visit, I would not call this ""perfect"" but disappointing.  Maybe last time we had the strudel it was fresh and cooked that morning, this time it seemed like it had been sitting in the fridge/freezer all day and had been reheated resulting in a cold center and soggy pastry.  No need to leave extra room for this next time.  Finished up with a Viennese coffee.  Excellent service (we sat at the back area), experienced, alert and attentive.  Still 4 stars but inconsistency of strudel was disconcerting.",4.0
