"Without a doubt the best cheeseburger and Chicago dog I have ever had. The meat was cooked medium without request. Very moist, flavorful, and juicy. The shack sauce topped it off perfectly. The burger seriously is much better than 5 Guys, Whataburger, Grub, and In-n-out. I've had Chicago dogs in Chicago and this one beats any of those I had previously tasted. Will definitely be back here again if I'm in the Brooklyn heights area again.Oh, and they serve a very good coffee shake!",5.0
"Competing against the long lines of Juliana's and Grimaldi's, this DUMBO location of Shake Shack more than holds its own. I really liked that they have multiple lines, and while the lines can get kinda crazy outside, it's actually managed as well as they can be. The seating area is also decent, and when the weather is nice, you can sit outside at the tables or on the steps and really soak in the views by the water. Go-to as always, is the ChickenShack. This isn't to say that the burgers aren't good, but I honestly find myself ordering the ChickenShack every time, simply because of how crispy and tasty the chicken is. Paired with the pickles, mayo and inkling of lettuce, it's just a solid, consistent sandwich every time. The opinions on Shake Shack's crinkle-cut fries are very polarized, but I tend to like them from time-to-time. I think I still like shoestring fries the best, but I'm not opposed to eating Shake Shack fries every once in a while.Service has always been relatively quick at this location, although as previously mentioned, the lines have always been long. I'm a bit perplexed as to why the water fountain only gives out two drops of water per minute, when there are so many families with kids who don't want to buy their bottled water. I'm exaggerating though. It's actually more like 1 drop of water per minute. So frustrating. Prices in general aren't cheap compared to places like McD's, Five Guys, etc., but I honestly do believe the value is there, since the quality is better than most fast food burgers.The views of the Manhattan and Brooklyn Bridge, as well as the direct access to the park really make this location one of the best. You can enjoy your fast, fatty foods with some of the best views in New York. And don't forget to get some icre cream or a concrete to go with it.",4.0
"FIRST OFF IF YOU HAVE NEVER BEEN TO SHAKE SHACK GO!! Legitimately the burgers and custard shakes are a must!!!Ive had a lot of different flavor shakes and no mater which flavor shake you choose you cant go wrong. One of my favorites is the traditional vanilla. There flavor custard change weekly. Like I said they spin all there custard, so there's no pumping flavors into it. The burgers are heavenly especially with the potato bun by personal favorite is the shack burger, and the fries are alright nothing special. They do compliment each other well. The real special thing about this shake shack is its location right under the Brooklyn bridge your directly across from the Brooklyn ice cream factory and too very renowned pizza places. Once you walk out of shake shack its such a romantic area to even just walk and bookmark a few romantic places you will see along the way, and then question why you didn't eat there instead of shake shack but hey, Shake Shack is special in its own way. All in all this location beats all the shake shack locations in Brooklyn by far. The food delivers flavor the service is fast but it does get crowded, It was fairly crowded on Sunday afternoon/evening so maybe try and go on a day where its not insane because they will make you wait outside on a line.GO FOR LOCATION AND YUMMY SHAKE SHACK!!!",4.0
"I came here around 11:20am on a Friday.  It was not really busy here and the menu was on the right wall near the register.  I had looked at the menu online before to get an idea of what to order.  I ordered the Shack Stack ($9.59), Fries ($2.99), and a large soda ($2.80).  I received a pager and sat down.  A few minutes later, my food was ready and I went to pick it up at the counter.  The Shack Stack was delicious and it looked like a lot of food at first.  The big mushroom in it was good and definitely worth trying if you loved mushrooms.  The Fries were crinkle cut fries and were good in my opinion.  Crinkle cut fries were one of my favorite fries in general.One thing to know about this place was the bathroom was only for paying customers.  There was a keypad on the two doors so you would need the code found at the bottom of receipt. This place was great and had a view of the Brooklyn Bridge which was right next to this place.  It got busy around 11:45am with almost no tables available.  Come early if you can!",4.0
"Came here on a nice Sunday, the place was quite small and packed with people. Luckily the line moved fairly quickly. We were lucky to find a table. We ordered the shack burger, chick'n burger, and crinkle cut cheese fries!! This was my first time having the chick'n burger and I really liked it. The chicken was moist and crispy and it wasn't overwhelming at all. It was nicely portioned and not messy when I consumed it. The fries were good as usual.",4.0
"It's right across (well not any more since it's been sold) the Watchtower Building (Brooklyn Bethel) and they have amazing food. The first time we came to NYC my sister said this was a go to place (we first heard about it because of the movie ""Something Borrowed"") this place is amazing, and I definitely had withdrawals when I came back to LA, I'm glad that they opened up the new Shake Shack here in WeHo for me to try.It's like In N Out, and 5 Guys combines x's 10.",5.0
The most delicious burger I've ever had!!! Hands down. I love the shack burger and the shackmeister burger. Shackmeister has frizzled onions on it!! I've tried most things on the menu and never been disappointed!,5.0
"Of course I had to try Shake Shack to see what the hype over this place was all about.Mehhhhhhhhhhh. I still prefer In N Out over Shake Shack.I ordered one of their specials that was pretty much a cheeseburger with sautéed onions. My boyfriend got a double cheeseburger. My sister ordered a chicken burger.  The three of us were disappointed with our orders. It was seriously nothing special. My sister gabbed so much about how she loves their burgers, but that day, she wasn't really a fan of their chicken burger. We all shared an order of their crinkle-cut fries. It reminded me of my elementary school days haha. I liked how crispy the fries were. I was kinda scared the fries would be soft and mushy.This location looked pretty new, very clean, and very well air conditioned inside. Buuuuut yeah, Shake Shack didn't live up to its hype.",3.0
"Shake Shack . Thank you for your delicious crinkle cut cheese fries.  Little did I know your fries look appealing to the eyes than the straight cut ones and tasted yummy.  For a west coast girl , you got me at your fries . Don't get me wrong ! I loved your burgers selection with its delicious amount of variety I ordered just the bacon burger and it was delicious as well but In N Out still owns my heart.  If there was a place in nyc to get some good burgers and fries it would be at Shake Shack. Environment :: upon arrival the place was clean and they even have table sanitization wipes for your convenience.  If you need to use the restroom , use the code at the bottom of the receipt !P.s. Try sitting near their fire place it is a cute corner LOL",5.0
It's Shake Shack but this review is for the DUMBO location. It's not too crowded late in the evenings but during the day it's a different story. It's crowded but the space is large and well maintained. Good beers too. Pro Tip:They have a water tap so it's a great place for free water refills.,4.0
"Whenever I come to Dumbo, there's always a long line here and at other neighboring pizza stores.I mean, this place is good, but it doesn't deserve the recognition it gets. The buns are especially oily. Cheese fries are good, but it's just a simple piece of cheese layered over. Custard isn't very creamy either. This isn't a place that I would crave for when I need some food relievers for bad days.",3.0
"Dear Shake Shack,I've tried you and am now forever changed.Is it strange to say my goal is to visit every Shack in the world? Or is it ambitious? Maybe a little bit of both? I'm glad I discovered your Brooklyn location after walking across the Brooklyn Bridge with some friends. I was desperate to try the Shack Stack burger, as it came highly recommended from a fellow Shack enthusiast. To wash it down, I ordered the Shackmeister Ale, which is brewed exclusively by Brooklyn Brewery for Shake Shack. How authentic and cool of me to drink that beer in Brooklyn, haha. Shake Shack, I spend my days thinking about you. As a visitor from Detroit, I highly encourage you to get here soon. It'd be a hit and I'd be your #1 visitor. Love, Alex",5.0
"Veg shroom burger was really good. A little greasy but not bad. !Beware of molten hot lava cheese fried inside! Black and white shake was the best. Quick, tasty, and awesome views in the area.",4.0
"The location itself is great, it's right across the street from the pier. The store is spacious and there is an adequate amount of seating. Truth be told, I only visited this location to try their ChickenShack, otherwise, UWS and Madison Square Park all the way!The food:ChickenShack- Crispy chicken breast with lettuce, pickles and buttermilk herb mayo. I thought the ChickenShack was decent, I thought the breast could use more flavor, the pickles were the predominant flavor and it was too aggressive for me and the buttermilk herb mayo was basically nonexistent. The breast was nicely fried and it had a really nice crunchy exterior but didn't offer much in terms of flavor. The sandwich was served on a nice squishy Martin's potato roll, which was nice. In the summer NYC battle of the chicken sandwiches, the Fuku sandwich is the clear winner. yelp.com/user_local_phot…Roadside Shack Burger- Cheeseburger topped with bacon caramelized onions. This is a new burger that just debuted on July 27th and it was good. It was basically a Shake Shack version of a patty melt. I ordered a double burger and it was nice and juicy and the flavor of the onions were nice but the overall burger was on the salty side. yelp.com/user_local_phot…Cheese Fries- Topped with our special blend of cheddar and American cheese sauce. OK, so I have ordered this at other Shake Shacks and I have to say that not all of them have the same taste. The one here had a weird consistency to the cheese and it was kinda weird. It seemed oddly thinner and thicker at the same time. Meh",4.0
"YES! Finally came back to NY to try the CHICKENSHACK which they only have in Brooklyn. Thick crispy coating, perfectly fried. My friend sitting next to me heard the crunch upon biting. It was that fresh. The bread was as soft as it gets and the pickles inside gave it that kick it needed. It was GOOD, I would have it again. Also tried the new Roadside Burger (bacon caramelized onions) which was FINE. It wasn't mind blowing but definitely juicy and so soft. I didn't care for the cheese they use. Crinkle cut fries are a must. They were a perfect ratio of starch and crisp. I was happy to learn that Brooklyn Brewery design a beer for Shake Shack. The Shakemeister Summer Ale was such a good beer I think it is one of my top ten now. Light enough to make it one of my session ales (I say that now until i have 2 haha)Lines were long but moved speedily. Cashiers were less than friendly, they looked like they hated their jobs. I didn't care for that. Food is overpriced. I don't think their burgers are worth it but once a year I would have it again. Los Angeles has better burgers. Sorry beloved Brooklyn. I would come back, but not running...",4.0
"I love this spot in DUMBO, the food and atmosphere are great! It is right by the river with beautiful park alongside, and you can see the NYC skyline.

"There was something odd about this Shake Shack...it was virtually EMPTY when I got there! Granted, it was a 40 degrees on a rainy Tuesday night in February; I don't think the crowds were clamoring for a trip to Shake Shack, haha, but it was perfect for me and the beau because we had an 8 p.m. show to attend at St. Ann's Warehouse. With arguably the best view of any Shake Shack in the city, this location had all of my favorites and then some. I finally got to try the new(ish) Chick'n Shack as well as the Roadside Shack Burger. I was a huge fan of both; I loved the crispy exterior of the chicken on the former as well as the generous schmear of herbed buttermilk sauce spread upon the pillowy potato bun, and the beer-cooked caramelized onions on the latter were a great sweet contrast to the salty cheese on the burger. I have to laugh because I ordered the Chick'n Shack, he ordered the Roadside Shack, we exchanged bites, and he liked the chicken sandwich better while I liked the burger better. Haaa. Go figure! But, overall, I really enjoyed them both. I'd buy either again; admittedly, it's nice to now have another option besides a burger at Shake Shack. (Yes, I know there are hot dogs, but I am not a hot dog kind of gal.) One of my favorite reasons to go to any new (to me) Shake Shack location is to try their concretes. I have had the Brooklyn Pie O My at their location near MetroTech, which they also have at this DUMBO location. However, they had the Caramel Carousel: vanilla custard with sea salt caramel sauce, sliced banana, and pieces of sugar cone. OH. LOVE! It's one of the best concretes I've ever had at any S.S. location, hands down! I'm sure this location gets swamped in the warmer weather; quite frankly, who can refuse the charm and beauty of the view of lower Manhattan and the two bridges on a beautiful day? With many food places popping up and holding a grip on that area, it's nice to have something as familiar and delicious as Shake Shack under the bridge.",4.0
"A recent conversation with several coworkers of mine wandered into the topic of Shake Shack, and the launch of their fried chicken sandwich, aptly named the ""ChickenShack"".Me: They're trying to take some of Fuku's market share, since David Chang's newest venture has had perpetual lines since opening. But since they're selling them only in Brooklyn locations and not limiting it to just lunch, it's not a direct call to war.Coworker 1: Why can't they just stick to their bread and butter? They make a solid burger and shake.Coworker 2: It's all because of the IPO, eff it. They have shareholders to answer to.** Insert Cohesive Sigh **While I can't speak to the rationale behind corporate decisions, I will say that Shake Shack's recent one-day launch of their ChickenShack certainly roped me in. The DUMBO location appears to be much less-traversed than any of the Manhattan ones, and even with the hype behind the launch, lines were quickly taken care of and seating wasn't an issue.I'll cut right to the chase: the ChickenShack comes in at a solid 3.5 stars. The star of the show, the fried chicken patty, is encased in a crisp, well-seasoned batter. The actual white meat leaned on the drier end of the spectrum, though, which indicated just a few too many seconds in the deep frier. The lettuce and sliced pickles added some necessary crunch and contrast in texture, but the buttermilk herb mayo was barely present. I did appreciate the use of the potato buns, but the ones we got weren't properly grilled - and any true carb-lover will understand the world of difference between plain versus grilled or toasted bread. At just shy of $7, it's also a bit pricey for what you actually get.The Peach Lemonade is a nice compliment to the sandwich - nothing particularly noteworthy, but an additional southern skew to your meal. It has just the right amount of sweetness and tang to prevent it from being overpowering, which is a balance that not all sweetened drinks achieve.For those eagerly awaiting the relaunch of the ChickenShack on July 16th... Well, it may or may not be worth your while. From my faint memories of Chick-Fil-A, I'll have to agree with the majority of my friends that their sandwiches are noticeably better (and those waffle fries!). But for the ardent followers of Danny Meyer... Well, I certainly won't blame you for making the trek to Brooklyn in a few days; certainly, I'm not one to judge.",3.0

I had to find out what all the hype was about..after seeing the lines for years at the original location I figured it must be great but I was not about to wait that long for a burger.   Was by the Dumbo location and thought I must finally test them out.   The place itself was pretty nice for a chain and very clean. The line moved quick but after ordering I waited about 15-20 minutes for a cheeseburger and cheese fries!   First of all it was 10 and change for the two items. The burger I have to say was so-so. Small with a oily bun. The cheese fries were blah..Nothing special at all.   My friend bought a burger and a chicken sandwich that he split with me...neither one of us ate anymore than the first bite. I believe it is a new item and I would suggest to stay away. Whatever type of sauce (something similar to tarter sauce) they put on it made it inedible.   I doubt I would return and just do not believe this place has blown up the way it has.,3.0

After shooting photo for 6 hours i went to shake shack and i had the double smoked shake shack burger, the burger was great. can't go wrong with the cheese fries, that was good too. i would stay away from ordering their soda floats. i got a root beer float was not good at all, the root beer tasted water down. overall i was hungry and this place was the closes to a burger shack so i tried. in the near future i would properly return for a burger but not for their floats.",4.0
"Fries so good you'll regret you dipped.I will admit it...I was a shake shack skeptic. Anytime the cost for a burger and fries climes into the double digits my cynical bells sound.  Walking into shack shack you will notice that its not like your everyday burger joint.  This place is well decorated inside but its tastefully done.  The menu was alot more vast then I had anticipated with offerings not limited to burgers.  There are vege options, hot dogs, ice cream, beers etc available all displayed on a large board to your right.I have my standard foods that I order to judge each category of restaurant by.  Pizza place? Plain cheese slice. Italian sit down? Chicken parm. Seafood? Lobster. Burger Joint? Double cheeseburger and fries please.I ordered a double cheeseburger and fries.  They give you an electronic buzzer thing to notify you when your meal is ready to be picked up.  As you wait make your way over to the condiment station that offers ketchup, mustard, and mayo.  There is also a cool beer tap style dispenser from which you can pour yourself a cup of water.  For me this is a huge plus since I rarely order a drink. When most places make you awkwardly ask for a cup of water, this place feels me, they know I just spent the rest of my rent of cheese and deep fried potatoes. Then it happened, as a stared hungrily into my girlfriend worried eyes time seemed to slow if not just for a few fleeting moments as my buzzer went off and let me know my meal was ready.  They do a really good job with the presentation.  If you order it to stay,the burger is wrapped in paper on a stainless steel tray.  The thing just looks good, but it tastes even better. I know you are suppose to use the paper to hold the burger, but rip that puppy off and release that cheesy bad boy from its papery shackles.  I honestly have never had a burger that the cheese has actually become one with the burger in the same way as this.  It in some magical way melted perfectly with the grease from the burger to create this creamy cheesy sauce for which the beef to bathe in.Generally, I am not a crinkle cut fry guy. These made me change my mind.  They are literally everything you would wish a fry would be.  Medium to thick density with a moist interior and a golden crunchy periphery.  Probably more salt then I would have added but it wasn't over done.Cant find anything negative to say about this place. If you asked me which was better Shack shake or In-N-Out I would have a hard time judging the difference between the two because they are both so similar and good.  In-N-Out is ppriced slightly cheaper but offers less in the ambiance category. 5 out of 5",5.0
"The location. Go get a table by the window and just see the Brooklyn Bridge staring back at you. Amazing. My fiancee, sister, and I stopped by here as we were going around exploring Brooklyn (DUMBO) on a rainy day in February. There was almost nobody in the restaurant, so we got to get a table with a very nice view out the window. This was my fiancee's first time in New York, and basically her first time seeing the Brooklyn Bridge, so it was quite an enjoyable experience to be able to sit there with some nice Chick'n Shacks and the very tasty Salted Caramel Hot Chocolate, looking out the window.",4.0
"I love shake shack burgers and their crinkle fries. They are so well seasoned. My only problem is that I wish the patties were bigger. They are so good that I cant help but want more!The registers and lines are right when you walk in. There is seating on either sides of the room. This restaurant is located in a prime area in Dumbo. Because it is right next to the Water taxi overlooking the Manhattan Skyline with picturesque views, it can get crowded.

Payment: Paid with a Visa gift card, so I can't speak to if they take American Express or not.Overall: Recommend going at least once.

Really enjoyed this location right under the Brooklyn Bridge as our first experience with Shake Shack.  It really hit the spot right after our hike across the Bridge.  Atmosphere was hip with furniture utilizing the wood beams from local factories.Ordered the Shack Stack...cheeseburger with their fried mushroom patty.  It was worth the hype.,5.0
"As far as all of the shake shack's, this shake shack is by far the nicest. The atmosphere looks nice and lets thank the workers here for keeping the place so clean and beautiful. This shake shack is in the heart of Dumbo near the Brooklyn bridge and the carousel. After shooting photo for 6 hours i went to shake shack and i had the double smoked shake shack burger, the burger was great. can't go wrong with the cheese fries, that was good too. i would stay away from ordering their soda floats. i got a root beer float was not good at all, the root beer tasted water down. overall i was hungry and this place was the closes to a burger shack so i tried. in the near future i would properly return for a burger but not for their floats.",4.0
"Fries so good you'll regret you dipped.I will admit it...I was a shake shack skeptic. Anytime the cost for a burger and fries climes into the double digits my cynical bells sound.  Walking into shack shack you will notice that its not like your everyday burger joint.  This place is well decorated inside but its tastefully done.  The menu was alot more vast then I had anticipated with offerings not limited to burgers.  There are vege options, hot dogs, ice cream, beers etc available all displayed on a large board to your right.I have my standard foods that I order to judge each category of restaurant by.  Pizza place? Plain cheese slice. Italian sit down? Chicken parm. Seafood? Lobster. Burger Joint? Double cheeseburger and fries please.I ordered a double cheeseburger and fries.  They give you an electronic buzzer thing to notify you when your meal is ready to be picked up.  As you wait make your way over to the condiment station that offers ketchup, mustard, and mayo.  There is also a cool beer tap style dispenser from which you can pour yourself a cup of water.  For me this is a huge plus since I rarely order a drink. When most places make you awkwardly ask for a cup of water, this place feels me, they know I just spent the rest of my rent of cheese and deep fried potatoes. Then it happened, as a stared hungrily into my girlfriend worried eyes time seemed to slow if not just for a few fleeting moments as my buzzer went off and let me know my meal was ready.  They do a really good job with the presentation.  If you order it to stay,the burger is wrapped in paper on a stainless steel tray.  The thing just looks good, but it tastes even better. I know you are suppose to use the paper to hold the burger, but rip that puppy off and release that cheesy bad boy from its papery shackles.  I honestly have never had a burger that the cheese has actually become one with the burger in the same way as this.  It in some magical way melted perfectly with the grease from the burger to create this creamy cheesy sauce for which the beef to bathe in.Generally, I am not a crinkle cut fry guy. These made me change my mind.  They are literally everything you would wish a fry would be.  Medium to thick density with a moist interior and a golden crunchy periphery.  Probably more salt then I would have added but it wasn't over done.Cant find anything negative to say about this place. If you asked me which was better Shack shake or In-N-Out I would have a hard time judging the difference between the two because they are both so similar and good.  In-N-Out is ppriced slightly cheaper but offers less in the ambiance category. 5 out of 5",5.0
"The location. Go get a table by the window and just see the Brooklyn Bridge staring back at you. Amazing. My fiancee, sister, and I stopped by here as we were going around exploring Brooklyn (DUMBO) on a rainy day in February. There was almost nobody in the restaurant, so we got to get a table with a very nice view out the window. This was my fiancee's first time in New York, and basically her first time seeing the Brooklyn Bridge, so it was quite an enjoyable experience to be able to sit there with some nice Chick'n Shacks and the very tasty Salted Caramel Hot Chocolate, looking out the window.",4.0
"I love shake shack burgers and their crinkle fries. They are so well seasoned. My only problem is that I wish the patties were bigger. They are so good that I cant help but want more!The registers and lines are right when you walk in. There is seating on either sides of the room. This restaurant is located in a prime area in Dumbo. Because it is right next to the Water taxi overlooking the Manhattan Skyline with picturesque views, it can get crowded. Keeping that it mind, parking will be challenging and the area may be filled with tourists and wedding parties.",4.0

"I'm a huge shake shack fan. love their burgers. I always get the shack stack because... it's simply amazing. BUT... let's talk about the chicken shack!So my friends and i hit up 3 fried chicken sandwhich joints in one evening to compare. I'd say the chicken shack was really good.bread - standard shake shack bread. soft, deliciouschicken - white meat. pretty good for breast/white meat! not too dry like some other places. good thicknessbatter - the coating around the meat was the best. super crispy and seasoned to near perfectionveggies inside - simple, good, nothing fancy.Overall, i think it's one of the best white meat chicken sandwiches. It rivals chick fil a, but i would choose FUKU's chicken sandwich over it. BUT you should def give it a try!This DUMBO location is also gorgeous. spacious inside. seating was easy to find on a friday evening. but why stay inside?? take your meal to go and go across the street to the gorgeous waterfront. beautiful view of the city skyline. there is also a citibike stop right in front in case you use that.(tip: if you want some good pizza after, juliana's and grimaldi's is right nearby)",5.0

"The neighborhood of Dumbo continues to shake things up.  The ongoing construction in Brooklyn Bridge Park and renovations to old warehouses down by the waterfront are making the area a more desirable place to spend an afternoon.  And now they have a Shake Shack!I'm sure many of you have been to other SS's in the city... this one is similar... but here are a few things you'll want to know about this particular Shack: The location is great - offering up fantastic views of Brooklyn Bridge and the Manhattan skyline. There was a long-ish line when I popped in around 12:30pm recently but moved quickly.  When I left 30 mins later the line was 2x as long. Things can get a little cramped by the condiment/plasticware counter.  After you order - get your napkin, straw and little plastic cup of ketchup and move out the way.  Your buzzer will still work anywhere in the restaurant. The dining rooms are spacious and have a variety of tables, booths and benches for whatever your shape and size. Bathrooms are large and relatively clean... Service was quick and friendly... And the food came out quickly and was delicious.  The Shake Shack cheeseburger continues to be one of my favorite burgers in the city.  Juicy burgers, melty cheese, soft potato rolls.  Yum yum yum. Oh and the crinkle fries are backkkk!!!  I've been waiting for this return for so long!  And they're seriously better than they were before.  Golden, tossed in a little salt and pepper.  I've missed them so...So glad this location (and all the others) have them back on the menu.",4.0

The meat patty is cooked well but not burnt and the meat patty is thick, unlike In N Out which is paper thin, sadly. The veggies are fresh (well so is In N Out) and the sauce was pretty good. The vanilla custard at Shake shack is....THE BEST, better than the mediocre shakes at In N Out. OMG. Bring Shake Shack to California please!The location here has great customer service and they do try their best to meet your standards and expectations. They forgot to make my brother's plain cheeseburger and I had to remind them twice. They either felt bad or they made two accidentally but this ""mistake"" resulted in two plain cheeseburgers for my brother. Which made him a happy camper. All in all I believe I had the best burger experience at Shake Shack and it is an unforgettable experience.",5.0
"Went here for the special Chicken shack.Like always there was a line, we got trough the line real fast and ordered two cheeseburgers and a chicken shack. The food is solid, the chicken shack could have had more sauce if you ask me. I think the cheeseburgers are better.The location is great btw!",4.0
"Good food, bad service. After waiting 10 mins to place my order, my cashier DENISE was clearly annoyed to take my order. As I tell her my order, she turns to converse with the cashier next to her. When she is finally done with her conversation, she looks back at me, still annoyed and tells me she didn't hear what I said and acts like she is doing me a favor by taking my order.I have worked in customer service all my life. No matter how difficult your job is, the goal is not to piss off your customer. If you can't stand the heat, get out or get an attitude adjustment. I also ordered a double ice cream-- when the server gave it to me the ice cream was already dripping all over the cone and down to the floor. Part of the cone was also broken, no apology or anything.

"So I am really not sure if  Shake Shack is all that good. Is it the allure of the lines of people flocking to the location pulling you in? Is it the ..dare I say it...Sinfully delicious Chicago Style hot dog available in NYC, a place infamous for our beloved street dogs located at every congestion of hurried tourist? Not sure. But this Shake Shack caught me on a hot day. I would like to say that I like the consistency of good quality that all Shake Shacks produce, and this one is no different. My biggest complaint would be the lay out. Due to the high number of clients that frequent the establishment, they order line, which was conveniently split in the Pick Up line, the C express which is for ice cream, wine beer and Custard Shakes, and the regular order line. There is no space to actually not have all three lines collapse into one semi confusing blob.Every 20 minutes or so, one of the friendly staff members would gently but assertively clear the chaos, it was not enough to organize or contain the mess of tourist.The location served its usual delicious foods.",3.0
"A little disappointing for me when I came here the other night for a quick dinner. I live in Chicago, visiting NY for vacation. I was in the vicinity and decided to try it.I got the smoke shack burger. Fortunately it was well cooked so that part I can't complain about. However, I was terribly disappointed with the taste. Just the combination of everything on it didn't flow together for me. Maybe my Chicago taste buds are just used to Chicago-style burgers.  It's apparently good to the locals. I also got a concrete since I never heard of that before. That didn't impress me too much either. I don't have to return here next time I'm in NY.",2.0
"I'm a huge shake shack fan. love their burgers. I always get the shack stack because... it's simply amazing. BUT... let's talk about the chicken shack!So my friends and i hit up 3 fried chicken sandwhich joints in one evening to compare. I'd say the chicken shack was really good.bread - standard shake shack bread. soft, deliciouschicken - white meat. pretty good for breast/white meat! not too dry like some other places. good thicknessbatter - the coating around the meat was the best. super crispy and seasoned to near perfectionveggies inside - simple, good, nothing fancy.Overall, i think it's one of the best white meat chicken sandwiches. It rivals chick fil a, but i would choose FUKU's chicken sandwich over it. BUT you should def give it a try!This DUMBO location is also gorgeous. spacious inside. seating was easy to find on a friday evening. but why stay inside?? take your meal to go and go across the street to the gorgeous waterfront. beautiful view of the city skyline. there is also a citibike stop right in front in case you use that.(tip: if you want some good pizza after, juliana's and grimaldi's is right nearby)",5.0

"The neighborhood of Dumbo continues to shake things up.  The ongoing construction in Brooklyn Bridge Park and renovations to old warehouses down by the waterfront are making the area a more desirable place to spend an afternoon.  And now they have a Shake Shack!I'm sure many of you have been to other SS's in the city... this one is similar... but here are a few things you'll want to know about this particular Shack: The location is great - offering up fantastic views of Brooklyn Bridge and the Manhattan skyline. There was a long-ish line when I popped in around 12:30pm recently but moved quickly.  When I left 30 mins later the line was 2x as long. Things can get a little cramped by the condiment/plasticware counter.  After you order - get your napkin, straw and little plastic cup of ketchup and move out the way.  Your buzzer will still work anywhere in the restaurant. The dining rooms are spacious and have a variety of tables, booths and benches for whatever your shape and size. Bathrooms are large and relatively clean... Service was quick and friendly... And the food came out quickly and was delicious.  The Shake Shack cheeseburger continues to be one of my favorite burgers in the city.  Juicy burgers, melty cheese, soft potato rolls.  Yum yum yum. Oh and the crinkle fries are backkkk!!!  I've been waiting for this return for so long!  And they're seriously better than they were before.  Golden, tossed in a little salt and pepper.  I've missed them so...So glad this location (and all the others) have them back on the menu.",4.0
"Burgers on soggy bread, milk shake arrives in a thimble sized cup, and service is, s-l-o-w. For this I spent $30 on three burger and two drinks! To top it off, the manager had done a deal with a german coach tour on a Saturday afternoon shutting down half the restaurant seating. Its hard enough with tourists bombarding Dumbo, but you really piss your neighbors off if you shut them out and place tourists ahead of them!",2.0

"Nothing better than starting in Manhattan and walking the length of the Brooklyn Bridge to get to Shake Shack, ordering cheese fries and washing it down with a black and white (chocolate/vanilla) shake. (And then you have to walk back the way back where you came from so you feel a little better about yourself to burn off the insurmountable number of calories, but the view back to Manhattan is more picturesque because you get the skyline).It's a little hectic here. Not only because it's busy but because of the way the ordering line is set up. I know there's a more efficient way. If you're getting shakes, the lines are different. Like I don't even really understand it, except that I was in the crazy line and then was able to go to the not-so-crazy line, but the lines aren't even clearly separated or noted. And then the condiment area. Good luck trying to get that mass of people to move out of your way.The fries are your run of the mill crinkle fries from the freezer section at your local grocery store, with melted cheese. The shake was pretty good, glad I got the combo of flavors. They carry local Brooklyn beers and wine, but would love to see boozy shakes in the future!",3.0

Not even a mushroom fan but this one rocks the house!! The Black and White shake was milky and creamy. The price of a burger is a little high around $10. The order for the cheese fries was a little small in my opinion, but I'm glad they use REAL cheese in their sauce. It ain't cheese wiz (phew.). They were thinly sliced w/their skins on. They offer wine and beer as well. We even lucked out and scored a free burger because they accidentally made one to many. YAH for us! Overall for 3 people, expect to pay around $30-$35.",4.0

"I've been waiting forever to finally try a Shake Shack burger. Living on the west coast, you only hear about the utter madness SS has inspired in New Yorkers. Now that I've finally had one, well ... it was a good burger. That much I can agree with. Fresh ingredients, not overly greasy -- definitely a good burger. Love the house draft root beer too. That's a nice touch -- don't always want just Coke or Pepsi. Not thrilled with the fries too. Crinkle cut? I'm like, ""Am I at Del Taco?""But is the hype justified? Gotta go with a firm no on this one. I've had plenty of gourmet-ish burgers at both full-service and upgraded fast-food places. SS definitely stacks up, that's for sure. But does it compare to the west coast king, In-N-Out Burger? Well, sort of. But really, these are two different style of burgers. I like both, but there's no comparison between the two.What I wasn't feeling was how much SS costs. $45 to feed four? At a burger place? Not really crazy about that.

"This is a review of the Chicken Shack sandwich after my experience trying it yesterday.Overall, I was not impressed. Though the textures were great (chicken with a crisp outside and tender and moist inside, soft bun) there really wasn't much flavor going on. They say that there is ""buttermilk herb mayo"" on it, but it definitely didn't give enough to make the sandwich work. The same goes for the pickles. I didn't even notice their contribution to the sandwich. No kick. Just flat. And a chicken sandwich should come dressed for success. I shouldn't end up trying to rub the side in my hot dog toppings to try to give it flavor.Did it fill me up to some degree? Yes. But would I order it again or recommend it to others? No. I think they need to make it a lot more flavorful (flavors should pop!) and interesting before rolling it out in Shake Shacks all over.

New York popular chain Burgers solid after being unable to get into Julianna's Milkshake heaven absolutely and not even shake fan (Calories!!)But the black and white ( Amy's cookie fame) milkshake most recommended !!!We fought over it Then bought two more,4.0
"So after skipping the one just off Times Square about a dozen times due to the size of the lines, we were out exploring Brooklyn yesterday and decided to stop in for lunch.I have to be honest and say I don't understand what all the fuss is about. The burgers were OK, but no better than what you get at Five Guys Burgers and Fries - and Five Guys is going to be about half the price.  In fact the only thing that I think was quite good, where the fries - but we ordered the cheese fries and all they do basically is put this liquid nacho kind of cheese on top of the fries.  It didn't really add anything to the fries, it wasn't what we were expecting from cheese fries, and the fries by themselves probably would've tasted just as good or better.Basically it is a decent fast food burger joint, that is way overpriced for the product that it serves.",3.0

We couldn't resist a couple of orders of cheese fries and for desert we each ordered one of their famous shakes which did not disappoint.

"Yes! Dammit I love these burgers. If we don't go to Fulton St, then we are here. It's great to walk the Promenade or through Brooklyn Bridge park and then come here for a meal. It can get very crowded now with all the summer crowds and tourists but the cashiers move fairly quickly and if you stalk the tables enough you'll get a seat.

Maybe I'm just spoiled by the service and gratitude at other locations when I load up on Shake Sale vouchers, but they just seemed harried and actually even stamped incorrectly here.PS 'Fulton Ferry District' is not a city yet somehow the magic Yelporithm knows it's in Dumbo?

"This is one of my favorite Shake Shack spots in NYC! The one in Dumbo sells draft beers (not bottle beers) which not every location offers. I always get Shroom Burger because if I get the one with the patty, it becomes too heavy for me to digest.

"Great Brooklyn location with the longest bathroom line EVER! They only have 2 rooms and the line for it is ridiculous. Food comes out quick. We came on a busy day.

Restaurant was very clean, and quite nice.  Recommended.",4.0
"It's Shake Shack. I love their burgers, cheese fries, concretes ... Pretty much everything. Some locations lack the ever so appreciated customer service, but this location seems spot on.

Try the shroom burger & cheese fries & pretty much any concrete =)",5.0
"long line but moved pretty quickly , didn't take that long to put in our order and get the food . burger was good , my cousin got the chickenshack and said it was good . would definitely come back again .  didn't give it 5 stars because i am not a fan of the fries (don't know if mine were just over cooked or what but wasn't good) .",4.0
I went here for lunch as I was craving burgers. The premises were very clean and there was plenty of seating.

Popular burger chain here in NYC. I always like having their burgers but I feel the quality has downgraded a bit. Also the wait here is long but that is to be expected in a touristy area.

"After seeing Shake Shake in times square by our hotel super packed with a long line going outside of the door I was ecstatic to see this shake Shack in Brooklyn not as busy and conveniently located by the Brooklyn Bridge.

"I've been to several Shake Shack locations and they've all been good but this location is just spot on! I might be a little bias since it's two blocks from my apartment, but the service here is amazing, the staff is very friendly and always helping their customers pick the best burger or shake for their liking and I know that can't always be easy since most of the tourists that come to the area don't speak a lot of English. There was a little error on my order when I was rung up and when I brought it to their attention they immediately fixed it and then the manager gave me a free shake card! I was very surprised and they seemed genuinely happy to try and make me happy! I will totally be back to this location (probably a lot more than I should).The three times I have been to this location the line has moved very quickly and I never waited more than 15 minutes for my food. However, I have seen the line wrapped around the building during a weekend afternoon. So, be smart, if you want Shake Shack don't go at 'rush' hours/days.  Just know that if you do wait a long time that it will be worth it! I've yet to have any thing from this location that wasn't exactly what I wanted and perfectly cooked. This is also a very nice sized location. There is a lot of seating and even a fireplace that I'm sure will come in handy during the winter. One of my largest gripes with going to other Manhattan locations is that there is never any seating and I end up waiting around for someone to get up and hurry to snag their spot. No problem here. That and the riverfront is right there so even if you can't find a good seat there are TONS of benches and seating with the full view of the Manhattan skyline and the bridges.",5.0

"My review is based on the service... not the food.  First I go to the C line to order and there is nobody there so I eventually move to the regular line and of course, somebody comes to take orders from the C line.  I will let that go somewhat, because the cashier mentioned it when I placed my order.  I let her know why I got into the regular line and she apologized.  I ordered 2 shakes... 1 caramel and 1 caramel and peanut butter.  Fairly simple order which I didn't expect to take a long.  Keep in mind that there wasn't a very long line while I was there.  After waiting for at least 10 - 15 minutes and watching multiple people getting their orders, I go to ask about mine.  The guy asked, says that he's going to check on my order.  I see him walk away and ask one of the people in the back a question but he never comes back to me.  I decide to ask another person behind the counter.  She goes to check and my shakes were just sitting there.. and looked like they had been for a while but nobody bothered to pick them up.  I take them and put straws in them and then noticed that the labels indicated that I got peanut butter shake and a peanut butter caramel.  I go back and explain what I ordered and the girls got an attitude with me and said that they had given me the right drinks.  And I keep repeating, I got CARAMEL and a CARAMEL/PEANUT BUTTER.  Then they tell me that I am right and go back and of course the caramel drink is also sitting on the shelf, which it probably had been for a while.  Then when I try to take what I ordered, they start telling me to just take the extra drink as if I had done something wrong. I kept saying... I don't want three shakes.  And they just repeated to take it.  I decided to just give it to somebody waiting in line.  Overall, I thought that the service was beyond bad and ridiculous.  Shake shack is shake shack, so the food and drinks will always be good, but they definitely need to improve their customer service!",1.0
"The double cheeseburger is so fresh and juicy, very delicious. The Brooklyn pie oh my wasn't as good as I expected.

"Does not live up to the hype. Great location with picturesque views of the Manhattan skyline and Brooklyn Bridge. However, my burger and fries were fairly mediocre. Not really sure why all the rave reviews. Basically it's Five Guys with better views and ambiance. BTW what's with the Cheez Whiz-like cheese and the soggy bun?",2.0
"Awesome!!!  Loved this place - burgers were good, but the shakes were great!  Never have I ever had a more delicious milk shake - I got the caramel / coffee and could not have been happier.  I also tried the burger, cheese fries, and shakemeister ale - no judging!  This is the DUMBO locale, and the view is beautiful - there's indoor / outdoor seating in the summer.  Just be prepared to get a little up close and personal with your neighbor- also they only have one bathroom stall in the place - just an FYI in case you can take care of those down under issues, somewhere else before your visit.  But food and service make it an awesome treat!",4.0
4 stars for food and the extra star is for the view...Im not a huge fan of shake shack but 2 things got me to this one...the view of the brooklyn bridge and they have wine...The food to me is okay...My kids enjoyed their milk shakes.  the place is kept extremely clean and well maintained...Its def a place to go too off season because during the warmer months there is no way you are eating there without waiting in line for 2 hours (which to me isnt worth it)...We will def go back...my husband loves shake shack..,5.0
"I think this is the best Shake Shack location.  There aren't that many people compared to the other locations and there's an outdoor area to sit as well as indoors.  Even better is that you can go to Brooklyn Bridge Park and eat there.  The 'Shroom burger and fries are still as good especially now that the fries are fresh cut, not frozen.  Another plus is that they have good wifi.  I'll be back to this location, the other ones are too touristy and you have to wait an hour for your order.",4.0
"Same formula, different locations.  The food here is great, the burgers are juicy and the fries are excellent.  Even the hot dogs are good.  The food is consistent in all of their locations.  A nice bonus to have public outdoor seating in the plaza area on a 1st come basis.  The lines can be a bit hectic given the location.",5.0
"I've been to several Shake Shack locations and they've all been good but this location is just spot on! I might be a little bias since it's two blocks from my apartment, but the service here is amazing, the staff is very friendly and always helping their customers pick the best burger or shake for their liking and I know that can't always be easy since most of the tourists that come to the area don't speak a lot of English. There was a little error on my order when I was rung up and when I brought it to their attention they immediately fixed it and then the manager gave me a free shake card! I was very surprised and they seemed genuinely happy to try and make me happy! I will totally be back to this location (probably a lot more than I should).The three times I have been to this location the line has moved very quickly and I never waited more than 15 minutes for my food. However, I have seen the line wrapped around the building during a weekend afternoon. So, be smart, if you want Shake Shack don't go at 'rush' hours/days.  Just know that if you do wait a long time that it will be worth it! I've yet to have any thing from this location that wasn't exactly what I wanted and perfectly cooked. This is also a very nice sized location. There is a lot of seating and even a fireplace that I'm sure will come in handy during the winter. One of my largest gripes with going to other Manhattan locations is that there is never any seating and I end up waiting around for someone to get up and hurry to snag their spot. No problem here. That and the riverfront is right there so even if you can't find a good seat there are TONS of benches and seating with the full view of the Manhattan skyline and the bridges.",5.0
"Beautiful, clean, well-staffed and on TOP of that - DELICIOUS SHAKE SHACK BURGERS!!!!  YAY!!!!!  And it's so nice that you can sit outside on a warm day and enjoy the lovely view of the Brooklyn Bridge.  I LOVE THIS PLACE!!!!  :)",5.0
"My review is based on the service... not the food.  First I go to the C line to order and there is nobody there so I eventually move to the regular line and of course, somebody comes to take orders from the C line.  I will let that go somewhat, because the cashier mentioned it when I placed my order.  I let her know why I got into the regular line and she apologized.  I ordered 2 shakes... 1 caramel and 1 caramel and peanut butter.  Fairly simple order which I didn't expect to take a long.  Keep in mind that there wasn't a very long line while I was there.  After waiting for at least 10 - 15 minutes and watching multiple people getting their orders, I go to ask about mine.  The guy asked, says that he's going to check on my order.  I see him walk away and ask one of the people in the back a question but he never comes back to me.  I decide to ask another person behind the counter.  She goes to check and my shakes were just sitting there.. and looked like they had been for a while but nobody bothered to pick them up.  I take them and put straws in them and then noticed that the labels indicated that I got peanut butter shake and a peanut butter caramel.  I go back and explain what I ordered and the girls got an attitude with me and said that they had given me the right drinks.  And I keep repeating, I got CARAMEL and a CARAMEL/PEANUT BUTTER.  Then they tell me that I am right and go back and of course the caramel drink is also sitting on the shelf, which it probably had been for a while.  Then when I try to take what I ordered, they start telling me to just take the extra drink as if I had done something wrong. I kept saying... I don't want three shakes.  And they just repeated to take it.  I decided to just give it to somebody waiting in line.  Overall, I thought that the service was beyond bad and ridiculous.  Shake shack is shake shack, so the food and drinks will always be good, but they definitely need to improve their customer service!",1.0
"The double cheeseburger is so fresh and juicy, very delicious. The Brooklyn pie oh my wasn't as good as I expected. ( I would prefer the pie to be hot and toasty or have a different texture than the ice cream.) I highly suggest that you get it to-go and eat outside at a nearby park next to the river if the weather permits.",4.0

Another shake shack and it comes to DUMBO.  This shake shack is as good as the others offering mean burgers except the ambiance of this one is more rustic and downtown/factory like.  Makes a great addition to the coolest most incredible park on the planet which is Brooklyn Bridge Park.  The shop is a brick and mortar right outside of the park on the block of Grimaldes Pizza.  Let's hope the lines for the shake shack don't turn into the lines for Grimaldes and we'll all be happy.  Welcome home Shake Shack and keep up the great expansions!!,5.0
"Burger is pretty good. Price is too high. Which is to be expected in DUMBO. The cheese fries are terrible. The fries are good. The cheese sauce on the side sucks. If I pay extra for cheese fries I expect real melted cheese. Not queso dip in a cup. Much better food options in the area. I do like that they take cards though. Hire someone to wipe down the damn tables too! Disgusting upkeep. There are 6 people standing behind the counter one of them should walk the floor and wipe down tables. Overall I have it three stars because the food is pretty good albeit overpriced, but the dining room is fucking gross.",3.0
"Grabbing a 'shroom burger, fries, and cup of the perfect lemonade to enjoy in Brooklyn Bridge Park was no easy feat, but it was worth it. Lines are long on a warm Friday night, and the noise level inside was kind of mind boggling; however, staff was super friendly, helpful, and patient. I wish they had a tip jar, since I really wanted to give Moustapha at the counter a tip for going above and beyond! Also, the blueberry doughnut-flavored custard was insanely delicious.",4.0
"Nice little burger - yes, compared with others they are small... but good. Had a Veggie-Burger which was delicious with a mushroom-cheese-patty. Burger buns are standard, so the burger could be improved. Fries are yummy. Definitely a place to eat a good veggie-burger :)",3.0
"Shake Shack serves up, hands-down, my absolute favorite burger. This location is their newest in the area and is one of my favorites! Right in the heart of beautiful DUMBO, my boyfriend and I had the privilege of chowing down on a juicy Shack burger and cheese fries while waiting for the fireworks at Brooklyn Bridge Park on the 4th. I normally go for their chocolate shakes, which are off-the-charts amazing, but to my surprise I noticed on the menu that Fridays they serve up DOUGHNUT CUSTARD (if you know anything about me, you know that I'm addicted to donuts), so I had to go with that. I chose very, very well.",5.0
"Ideal location in Dumbo. Good food very crowded all the time, comes with the name I suppose! Food was pretty old, had a regular hamburger which was solid. A great place to go for a classic burger fries and shake, staff was also fairly nice.",3.0

"This is based on one visit. Saturday around 3:30 pm. Pretty crowded but not hard to find a table. Menu is large and a bit overwhelming with so many people i felt rushed and didnt have time to look at the different items. Workers were all very nice and professional. Waiting for my food i noticed there were several orders coming back as incorrect or people complaining that their order was not what they expected. The worker helping them was very accommodating. I ordered a regular burger fries and a strawberry shake. The burger came plain with no lettuce pickles tomato or onion. I had to ask them for those on the side. I noticed in the description of a burger that it had ""shake sauce"" or ""shack sauce"" which i assumed was some variation of thousand island as they all are. When i went to ask for some a girl stood there and looked at me like i was speaking a foreign language. Granted i asked for thousand island, she said we dont have that, i asked for a sauce they put on the burger, she said no we dont do that, then i said the magic words ""shake sauce"" and she said oh yeah we have THAT! Pretty great in my opinion. The burger was delicious. It was warm soft and sort of melted in my mouth. The sauce is some sort of thick thousand island flavored mayo. The fries were ok. The shake was very thick and silky. I would recommend it for a good burger and good people watching.",4.0
