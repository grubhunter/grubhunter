"Party of 4 on a Saturday night and the place was full! Yet, it never felt that way. The staff made sure to treat us all really warmly. From the host to Jeremy, the waiter, to the music, the atmosphere was just really fun and friendly. Not to mention the food! Seriously delicious. The hummus app could totally just have been a regular hummus app, but instead had some kind of spice flavor that just made it shine. The bread was fresh as can be. The rainbow radish side was mouthwatering. Should I go on?Everyone loved their meals and the desserts were stellar. AND at the end, because it was closing time, Jeremy gave us extra tastings of some of the pastries.Please go here, bring your friends and order just about everything on the menu. Boom.",5.0
"Came here for brunch with friends and our toddlers ( 2 almost 17 month olds) ....because if you have kids you know that dinning with toddlers is it's own form of torture...but Runner & Stone was MORE than accommodating. We may have just gotten extremely lucky (even the bar staff was surprised at how empty it was the day after Thanksgiving)...We were seated quickly downstairs in what seemed to be a more ""private"" area (only 2 or 3 tables) which allowed for a great amount of freedom for the babes - a reason (right or wrong) I added a star.The baguette and butter was fresh and tasty, as expected at a Bakery. The croissant was also everything it's made out to be (got the almond AND the chocolate-almond, both great but I'd go with just almond as a recommendation because the chocolate version was a bit too sweet. Some more of what we ordered: French fries and Hollandaise (VERY yummy, I don't love Hollandaise but enjoyed it as a topper on the crispy fries), French Toast (good size portion for 3 people, would've preferred more fruit, but it was tasty as is), and majority of the other meals were some form of eggs (hello brunch...). Overall, everyone was very happy with their meals and coffee/mimosas were a hit as well. I think if we had to wait to be seated more than 20-30 minutes - it may not be worth it, but if you are able to do a run in and eat version (as we did), it's a solid yummy meal/experience.",4.0
"Wow.  #amazeStaff and service was top notch, especially for my party of 8 (and were able to make res-y!).  Food was tastier than the common bland brunch foods in New York.  Pastries are stellar.  They even brought out a gluten free dessert for my wife's birthday.still in shock by the staff and food.  will return for sure.",5.0
"Came here for brunch, ordered a French toast with caramelized bananas. The bananas did not seem appetizing. It looked like mash baby food. I was assuming it would look either cut up into cubes or sliced. Oh wells. Even though esthetically it wasn't appealing it was good. The portions r pretty small which is a disappointment. I also got a side of baguette, I was very happy and regret I didn't buy an extra one to go. Next time!! Service was great! Staff is very friendly and on top of their game. Didn't feel rushed.",3.0
"""Sometimes you want to go where everybody knows your name."" And other times you want to go so that you know that you can get a damn good cup of coffee and a damn good croissant, and that's exactly why I love this place.The best part about this spot, is that they make all the pastries in house, and not many coffee joints can say that. I'm a huge fan of home baked goodies, and literally everything  here is super tasty. From the pretzels, to the varying breads, the almond croissants, chocolate croissants, plain croissants-- when restaurants take the time and effort to put love into their food, you can actually taste it.When I absolutely love certain coffee places-- it's simple, I come to places like this because they've consistently got great coffee, the service is simple & friendly, and they've got the best things to pair with that warm cup of Joe. I also appreciate that this spot, though it looks pretentious, it actually feels like just the regular café. I'm a regular here because they never failed me and I am consistently overjoyed when I come to this place.Not only does Runner and Stone offer great food and amazing customer service, the space is just an incredible think, chat, or do work space with lots of friendly workers who take care of ya.Local love from a local girl,Renee Rises in Brooklyn",5.0
"For a place that's a bakery first and a restaurant second...this is a damn fine restaurant. I'm not sure if they are simply the nicest folks around or if the waitress was desperately in love with me,* but they started us off with fantastic mini-croissants, and when we were leaving they sent the two couples at our table our way with a loaf of excellent bread each (again, bakery first).In between, we indulged in fried chicken, strip steaks, amazing pastas, chicken liver pate, and much more. I'm not going to complain about any of it. The wine list, while short and sweet, is surprisingly on point as well. We aren't winos...wait, we are winos. We aren't wine SNOBS, but we definitely found their curated selections to be delicious.Personally, I've cooked and I've baked, and baking is more difficult. It's not surprising that the talented bakers here can also cook delicious things. See you again soon.____________*I lied. It's definitely the former.",5.0
"I'll start at the end of the meal:  we were pretty full, but the waitress said ""we have some insanely delicious malted cider sorbet.  I can get you guys a scoop of that.""  She was not wrong, it was really freaking delicious.  Ample Hills may want to walk down the block to take notes.  (And then the waitress gave us a loaf of bread to go for free.  Yeah, the service here is awesome, which is an excellent complement to having an onsite bakery.  My fiancee stated her girlcrush on the waitress in no uncertain terms afterward.)Going back to the beginning:  drinks here are pricy but strong and well-made.  The pastas are outstanding--the braided ricotta ravioli especially.  Both of us would call our entrees very good but not great, but the portions are enormous, so that makes everything better.  There is a constant stream of a variety of homemade bread as well.Definite top 10 Brooklyn restaurant for me.",5.0
"I don't really understand why this place is rated so well. I went for dinner and was very unimpressed. Dined as a group of 3 and the hostess(es) were confused seating us vs. another group of 4. Couldn't keep the groups straight. We opted to just sit and dine at the bar. The bartender also seemed completely confused--confused why we wanted to see the drink menu, why we wanted to order drinks, why we wanted to order food, how to clear the plates. And on top of that, the drinks were terrrrrrrrible! I've seriously never had drinks so terrible before. I had the el jefe, which was ... Okay, didn't taste anything like the description of tequila and grapefruit, etc. I drank it to not waste $14, and ordered the gowanus dodgers. It legit tasted like water from the gowanus canal. It'd actually be a good gag drink. Food-wise, I got the steak. Medium rare, was more like medium-well done. It was dry and tasteless. Came with stale fries. My friends ordered ravioli and the fish of the day. They weren't raving but didn't complain either -- we were at dinner catching up so I guess it wasn't really worth the energy. The ambiance too was off. It was somewhat dim, to attempt romance? It didn't feel that way. It was just dark, and stale feeling. Like a dive bar trying to pass as upscale, and failing. Yet my part of the bill was still $70.",2.0
"Slammed my elbow on the wall getting my  phone from my pocket, due to some oddly placed (permanent) decor at my wobbly table in the back corner. Really good warm green olive croissant to start made me forget about that quickly, even in the hard chairs. The service was friendly and relatively attentive throughout (only misstep was leaving me with a steak knife for a second round of bread&butter), but the house music really clashed with the sleek, otherwise quiet space (the only other table had a lot of useless ?s).Dropped by Runner & Stone, a Michelin Bib Gourmand, on an early Saturday evening BBEats deal meant a Complimentary appetizer (""first"" or ""small second"", in this case a tasty but unremarkable duck pastrami) plus a Citi Extra Perk of Complimentary Specialty Bread (rye baguette was available) (and 1-Month Extended Redemption). Really weak selection of 'Thirds' aka entrees left me with the 12oz NY Strip steak medium rare ($35), which was alright until the last 2 bites, which were entirely gristle. The bread (particularly their crust) throughout the meal was phenomenal, so if I'd just dropped by for some loaves (which they seem to offer even between 3&5 when table service isn't available), this would've been an easy 5.",4.0
"Had a great meal here on Saturday: - fried brussel sprouts were excellent, perfectly flaky without being greasy, and not oversalted or too chewey- mushroom salad was great too, maybe a touch on the sweet side but the texture was appealing and it was very refreshing- our two cocktails were both excellent, really bold and flavorful without too much sugar and just the right strength- squid ink paccheri was delicious! I'm a sucker for squid ink pastas generally, but this was really delicious, perfect texture and the right portion size. I found myself getting full right as I took the last bite. The spice and chili oil would probably be too far the strong side for some, but I was really happy with it. To top it off, the service was great, the complimentary bread from their bakery was delicious, and they filled our water frequently. I really can't wait to go back!",5.0
Wow. That almond croissant is really *on point*. Believe the hype! I also had a delicious mackerel sandwich on baguette.

"We had brunch on our latest visit but have been here for dinner several times, too and have always enjoyed it. We were a party of 6 and we were starving so we were thrilled when they told us they could seat us right away in the downstairs area.  Service was great. Coffee appeared quickly, and we ordered some baguettes for the table while waiting for our entrees.  You could just stop right there and be happy.  Their bread is fantastic. Crisp and chewy and excellent texture.  It really didn't need the butter and jam but we indulged anyway.Side note but I'm always charmed by the concrete flour bags that form the walls.  They are so visually interesting.Our main courses arrived. I had an excellent Eggs Benedict. And if that sounds ubiquitous, I've been on a mission lately to find a good one since few restaurants seem to get it right.  I would have preferred ham or Canadian bacon to the smoked salmon but it was excellent nonetheless and the eggs were cooked exactly right. The white were just firm enough and the yolks still runny. The hollandaise had a nice tang.  Others ordered the French Toast and sides of slab bacon.  That French Toast is ridiculously good and I could easily have ordered my own after the Eggs Benedict but I didn't want to be a glutton, so I'll go back and get it next time.Nice space, great service, excellent food.",5.0
"Excelente!  Love the food, it was light and hearty.   The Flavor was rich and delicate.   The almond the croissant was to die for.  My only disappointment was the homemade ginger beer  which taste a ginger candy dissolved in seltzer water with a dash of squeezed Lemon.   However it wasn't enough to take away from the 5 star experience.  Everything else I ordered was top notch.  Bacon lovers the grilled bacon is a mouth watering experience.",5.0
"Came here with a large party and split a bunch of appetizers, entrees, and desserts. Everything was phenomenal. We started with a nice bottle of red - I honestly wish I remembered the exact name (it was a cab) of the wine that was recommended by our server, but it was delicious and everyone raved about it. We split the mushroom salad, shrimp toast, local cheese, and the spicy curried hummus. My favorite was the mushroom salad. The shrimp toast tasted kind of fishy and wasn't exactly what I expected, but still decent.For entrees, I split the NY strip with my sister - it was a perfect medium rare and the chimichurri was a delightful complement to the steak. Others got the fish of the day (halibut), pork chop, gnocchi, and the kale risotto. I kept hearing great things about the gnocchi so I'll definitely have to try that next time. The risotto came in a small bowl (great as a side), but came out a bit too cheesy for my taste.The service was excellent and we got our own table downstairs which I highly recommend for a large group/private party.

The food here was great. We had a multi-course meal and a lot of it was family style which meant everyone was able to sample a bit of everything. The two pasta dishes we had were highlights of the meal, with the orecchiette being the best. My main course, a NY strip, was only ok as I think the piece wasn't well-butchered and had a lot of extra fat/grizzle on it. That being said, it was cooked well, and looking around the table, it seemed like my steak was the exception to the rule. Service was accomodating and the space was nice, I'd definitely recommend Runner and Stone for a meal.",4.0

"We were staying at the Fairfield Inn closeby and decided to try out this restaurant for brunch on our last day in Brooklyn. It was a surprisingly delightful experience; this place is a gem in an otherwise industrial-looking neighborhood. The food was very good (judging from the customers walking in to buy baked goods, that must be their specialty). We placed the order at the counter and just sat back and read the paper. My wife had the breakfast sandwich (fried eggs, cheese and tomato jam)  and I had the grilled chicken on durum ciabatta which was quite tasty. All the items on the menu (sandwiches and salads) sound yummy and reasonably priced - mostly $9. We will definitely go back when we visit our son in Brooklyn again.",4.0
"The almond croissant. Best almond croissant I have ever had in my life. I get it as frequently as possible, and I have shared its greatness with many others, who all totally agree. It is crisp and flaky on the outside, with a perfectly not-too-sweet almond paste inside. It's like a double-baked, filled croissant, and all almond croissants worldwide should follow suit. Outside of my almond croissant habit, I have tried several of their other baked goods (never disappointed) and also eaten twice in the restaurant, once for dinner, and once for brunch. At dinner (April 2015), every course was well put together, and the bread basket was diverse and utterly delectable. The environment was romantic, effortlessly casual but not too casual, and Honestly, though, I would take the place overall down a half-star for how poorly balanced all our cocktails were that night. I'm sorry that I am writing this months later, so I can't specify which cocktails we had, but we tried 3 of them, all of which sounded delightful on paper, but all of which came out somehow off. Maybe it was just a bad night/not the regular bartender, so I am still leaving it at 5 stars. Our brunch meal (September 2015) was overall tasty and positive, and not too pricey. We had the chicken liver pate, the rice ball of the day, and eggs Benedict with salmon. We weren't blown away. but we were happy with our meal overall. So overall, the almond croissant is a huge winner and merits the 5 stars 100%. I would recommend you go there even just for that. Or check out their stand at the Park Slope greenmarket on Sundays! And dinner there definitely merits the plunge--I'm hopeful that the cocktails would pleasantly surprise us all and be as bomb as they sound from the descriptions.",5.0

"Dear Runner and Stone,What a wonderful addition you have been to the neighborhood.  I really enjoy having a perfect cup of coffee and probably the best croissant I've had outside of Paris.I've gotten thanksgiving rolls for family, croissants for co-workers, and loaves as Christmas gifts for friends and they are always well received.

"My boyfriend and I came here for dinner on Valentine's Day. Things started off really well with some sort of complementary olive pastry, which was delicious.

The white chocolate ice cream that came with it was great, but the grapefruit seemed like little more than what you would have for breakfast. It was sort of a puzzling dessert. My boyfriend had the rye brownie sundae, which seemed much tastier.All in all, I thought the food was uneven.

"I came to Runner and Stone for a romantic dinner with the hubs and we were not disappointed.  Upon ordering, we were brought some house-made olive pastries as an amuse bouche, which was a very nice touch in my opinion.  It also was nice to have in light of the punch my cocktail was packing.  I ordered a South Brooklyn and while the name and the ingredients were a little overplayed, the cocktail itself was delicious.  I may have to dust off my bottle of St. Germain and try it out at home.  The hubs had a new fashioned, which I found not nearly as interesting, despite the fact that I am so fond of bourbon.  There are several local varieties on the drinks list, including several Brooklyn-produced gins.  I was tempted to order a second cocktail as the first was so good, but it was one of those times when my sense of propriety surfaced.We shared a roasted squash salad to start, which was so good that we left not the tiniest leaf of lettuce uneaten.  It sounds like a sweet dish, but actually, the vinaigrette was quite pleasantly savory.  I'd come back just for the salad!The nice thing about Runner & Stone being a bakery during the day is all the bread they bring you with your dinner.  The bread was all pretty good, but the butter could've used some salt or seasoning.  You'll want to get something with some extra sauce so you can put that bread to good use.I opted for the braided ricotta ravioli while the hubs got the pizzoccheri.  I liked the ravioli, which were not really braided so much as tied off at the ends like Christmas crackers.  They were beautiful, but the tomato jam seemed a bit overly sweet.  The hubs enjoyed the pizzoccheri, which was made with buckwheat noodles.  He said the noodles tasted almost like meat, meaning it as a compliment.In order to round out the romantic dinner experience, we decided to share a banana split.  It included barley malt ice cream, marshmallow sauce, and, most intriguingly, crunchy bits of caramelized bread!  It may sound strange, but it was delicious and a perfect way to end the night.  It's a bit shmancy for an everyday dinner, but Runner & Stone is an impressive date spot.",4.0
"Runner & Stone serves a damn good brunch on Sundays. I'll be the first to admit that the wait sucks (even with two levels of seating, it was a 20 minute wait after we were given a 10-15 estimate).The spicy Blood Mary is deliciously spicy; I believe the rim was salted with a combination of celery salt, cayenne and black pepper.The almond croissant was probably one of the best croissant I've ever had. The inside was spongey and moist while the outside was flaky and warm; a unique combination along with the almond flavor.A half baguette is plenty to start out with (we actually ordered a whole at first, but we were brought half by accident, which was actually a good thing). It came with unsalted butter, but for some reason we didn't have salt or pepper available at our table.I also had the smoked sausage with two eggs. The sausage was good, but a little dry. The special of the day was a prime rib sandwich with hollandaise sauce. My friend ordered it and let me try some; they should definitely promote it to the main menu!We sat in the basement (where inexeplicably, there seemed to be a Sean Paul playlist on an iPod dock playing) and service was a little spotty.

"Due to time constraints at work I took my mom here for her birthday on a Monday night and to say that we were pleasantly surprised is beyond an understatement!  For starters we had the pretzel with homemade mustard and pickles and also ordered the rice balls. For entrees my mom ordered the fried chicken and since I couldn't decide between the mushroom ravioli and the tomato jelly ravioli, the waiter suggested to give me a tasting of each. Everything was uniquely prepared and served and created a feasts of tastes in your mouth. I also ordered the Autumn Sangria which was a unique blend of spiced cider and chilled red wine. If I didn't have to go to work the next morning, I would have ordered another. For dessert we had the Ricotta Rice Pudding, served with apricots and HOMEADE SHORTENING BREAD. Everything tasted so fresh and every ingredient blended well together, yet you were able to identify each taste individually.  Even the breadbasket was amazing as they served several different types of grains that you could instantly tell from the texture that they were baked fresh on the premise. I have two regrets about coming to Runner and Stone, and that's  not coming here sooner and not hearing more about it. If you're  ever in Gowanus, please make it your business to stop in and treat yourself to great service and an impeccable dining experience! I cannot wait to return!",5.0

We stopped in here for an afternoon snack after rock climbing a while back. It was a little too late in the day so their bakery goods were mostly gone. So my bf decided to have the duck pastrami.

"This review is for the baked items.The BREAD! Holy good god is the bread awesome. This is the bread you want folks; crusty but never burnt, giving way to a chewy, airy, and absolutely delicious interior. I've done low-carb with much success but refuse to refuse their bread ever!In addition I've had several of their other baked items while getting daytime coffee at Crop-to-Cup and they're equally fantastic. The almond croissant looks so dark and frumpy as if someone sat on it but IT'S FREAKING FANTASTIC! I once had a kind of boring and not too flavorful burger here that was a lunch special when they'd just opened but haven't eaten their hot food since. Trusted sources tell me it's good.

"Items selected include:Almond CroissantApple TurnoverPistachio FinancierNamed for the stones of a traditional mill and featuring breads, pastries, and viennoisseries along with coffee at breakfast Runner and Stone would be the last Brooklyn stop on our morning pastry run and, unfortunately, the least inspiring despite all the great reviews even though the almond croissant was impressive, the layers shattering to the tooth and the frangipane lightly applied but heavy in flavor.  Moving past the croissant, however, the flaw of Runner and Stone is a limited selection of otherwise underwhelming options - the apple turnover tasting burnt and the pistachio financier tiny, dense, and dry.  Factor in a server who was almost too busy chatting with her friend to take my order...perhaps I'd be better off going back sometime for brunch, or to try one of the housemade breads",2.0

"The store front of Runner and Stone is unremarkable but once inside, it is a geode in the ruff.Unbelievable food and LA-style decore (clean and minimal like in the 80's). Brunch gets super $$$, although good, not really worth $80 for two people. Granted the mimosas are toooooo-die-for (fresh squeezed oj).",3.0
"Came back for dinner per Shar K's advice. It was significantly better than brunch.For 2 ppl, we shared the baby beet salad, duck pastrami, the chicken w dumplings, and orrechiate. The chicken was delicious, possibly the best I've had at a restaurant. I can't even describe it. Duck pastrami was interesting to try.We had a few desserts. They were pretty but we couldn't finish them.",3.0
"I came to Runner & Stone last week for a friend's birthday dinner.  Because we were a large party (about 10 people) they told us that we would have to order from a prix fixe, which had the same choices as the regular menu, but $50 for a starter and a main, about $15-20 more per person than their regular prices.  Our bill was nearly $1000, my ribeye (which had a $7 upcharge from the $50 prix fixe) was really thin and gristley.  I will say that the service and cocktails were great, but didn't make up for price hike.  This ""group"" uncharge, without even a private room or free dessert for the birthday girl, was excessive.  I left hungry.  I won't be returning and I doubt any of the other 9 guests will either.",2.0
"Due to time constraints at work I took my mom here for her birthday on a Monday night and to say that we were pleasantly surprised is beyond an understatement!  For starters we had the pretzel with homemade mustard and pickles and also ordered the rice balls. For entrees my mom ordered the fried chicken and since I couldn't decide between the mushroom ravioli and the tomato jelly ravioli, the waiter suggested to give me a tasting of each. Everything was uniquely prepared and served and created a feasts of tastes in your mouth. I also ordered the Autumn Sangria which was a unique blend of spiced cider and chilled red wine. If I didn't have to go to work the next morning, I would have ordered another. For dessert we had the Ricotta Rice Pudding, served with apricots and HOMEADE SHORTENING BREAD. Everything tasted so fresh and every ingredient blended well together, yet you were able to identify each taste individually.  Even the breadbasket was amazing as they served several different types of grains that you could instantly tell from the texture that they were baked fresh on the premise. I have two regrets about coming to Runner and Stone, and that's  not coming here sooner and not hearing more about it. If you're  ever in Gowanus, please make it your business to stop in and treat yourself to great service and an impeccable dining experience! I cannot wait to return!",5.0
Small cafe. Friendly staff. Not too many tables. Definitely not good for big groups.Good italian food. The gnocchi and ravioli were excellent.The croissant was not available for dinner. Skip the duck pastrami.Creme brulee was above average.,4.0
We stopped in here for an afternoon snack after rock climbing a while back. It was a little too late in the day so their bakery goods were mostly gone. So my bf decided to have the duck pastrami. It was so good! We both wanted more! I also liked their cannele and cheesecake a lot. And their espresso drinks were quite good. I definitely need to go back for a proper meal so I can give them a proper review.,4.0
favorite bakery in the neighborhood. they can sell out fast. also great coffees and teas.  super sweet little spot and by far best quality baked goods in Slope/ Gowanus.,5.0
"This review is for the baked items.The BREAD! Holy good god is the bread awesome. This is the bread you want folks; crusty but never burnt, giving way to a chewy, airy, and absolutely delicious interior. I've done low-carb with much success but refuse to refuse their bread ever!In addition I've had several of their other baked items while getting daytime coffee at Crop-to-Cup and they're equally fantastic. The almond croissant looks so dark and frumpy as if someone sat on it but IT'S FREAKING FANTASTIC! I once had a kind of boring and not too flavorful burger here that was a lunch special when they'd just opened but haven't eaten their hot food since. Trusted sources tell me it's good. The bread however is among the very best in the city.",5.0
"Items selected include:Almond CroissantApple TurnoverPistachio FinancierNamed for the stones of a traditional mill and featuring breads, pastries, and viennoisseries along with coffee at breakfast Runner and Stone would be the last Brooklyn stop on our morning pastry run and, unfortunately, the least inspiring despite all the great reviews even though the almond croissant was impressive, the layers shattering to the tooth and the frangipane lightly applied but heavy in flavor.  Moving past the croissant, however, the flaw of Runner and Stone is a limited selection of otherwise underwhelming options - the apple turnover tasting burnt and the pistachio financier tiny, dense, and dry.  Factor in a server who was almost too busy chatting with her friend to take my order...perhaps I'd be better off going back sometime for brunch, or to try one of the housemade breads",2.0

"Runner and (not bothering with the ampersand) Stone gave me just what I needed and not a whit more. I was lone and low and waiting for a haircut.

But not at the point of self parody. My needs that night were admittedly Semitic.

"After learning that the former head baker of Per Se and Bouchon Bakery was one of the masterminds behind Runner & Stone, I'd been counting down the days until it opened.  My fiance and I thought it was a good idea to trudge through the snow the afternoon after a snowstorm with our dog with our minds set on pastries. Despite only 75% of the sidewalks being plowed and freezing/whipping wind, we really wanted some croissants. I must admit, it seemed like the longest walk I've ever taken-- literally, my fingers were frozen and my dog was covered in dirt/soaking wet- so much so, I knew I would have to carry him into my apartment and give him a bath right away as he would destroy my furniture. Needless to say, at this point, I needed some delicious baked goods and a warm latte ASAP! The space itself is warm and inviting and thanks to the snow, the place was empty and they were fully stocked with pastries. First things first, I ordered a mocha for my guy and a latte for myself. For baked goods, I was a bit overzealous and ordered a chocolate croissant, an almond croissant, a slice of the lemon poppy bread, apple turnover, and a brownie. My latte and the mocha were delicious!! Seriously, the first time in a while (sadly), that I've had a good latte! Unfortunately, all of the baked goods were a bit on the stale side-- I'm not sure if it's just due to the storm and perhaps they were made the day before?? Generally, croissants do have a relatively short shelf life and I did get there around noon. However, my brownie and the lemon poppy loaf had to have been made a good 2+ days ago which was very disappointing. The brownie had major potential-- it was fudgy- but had that cakey/dry consistency that occurs after sitting out for a while. The lemon poppy loaf was so dry, it wasn't enjoyable. 4 stars for my killer latte.

We were seated towards the back, with a lovely view of their outdoor terrace (no seats out there I'm afraid) and a great breeze as well. Service was knowledgeable, and we soon found ourselves enjoying amuse and baked breads that were delicious. We're talking crispy, crunchy, olive-oily bread here folks, it was delicious! I started with the baby beet salad, accompanied by a delicious walnut yogurt dressing that really popped in terms of fresh, tangy flavor. Can't remember husband's appetizer, but for dinner I had the Fish of the day, which was Fluke, cooked in a flavorful grebiche sauce that is sort of a mix of capers, onions and eggs - I'd never had anything like it before but found it to be absolutely unique and delicious! My husband had the merguez, a hearty dish finished with garbanzos and a tangy harissa. We also tried some vegetables - save room for these!! Our haricots vert were buttery and delicious.

Good mustard and pickled onions- The Lamb Burger - so tasty, nice tart slaw. The bun was a little tougher than I would have liked- The Roasted Chicken - cooked very well and tender but it tasted a bit gamey. - Rye Brownie Sundae - great brownie, great ice cream but wish they heated the brownie upThe bread is as advertised awesome.

"It's 11am on a Saturday morning and I just ate a delicious toasted slice of Brioche  from a homemade loaf that Bill the bartender gave me on my way out of Runner and Stone last night.  My boyfriend and I peeked into The Pines and I said ""Lord..this is loud, let's try that place across the street"".  We were greeted warmly and opted to sit at the bar.  Bill's special cocktail that night was right up my man's ally...whisky, Campari, bitters, some other stuff.  I got a generous pour of a delicious Gruner Vetliner and then another glass for free because Bill thought our food was taking too long.  (I didn't..timing was totally fine).  Lamb special for me with roasted heirloom tomatoes...cleaned my plate!   Delicious,  just crisp on the edges, meaty but not dry Paddock for my boyfriend.  Happy, friendly, courteous staff.  Just loved it.  Ended the meal with whisky ice cream over a brownie and drizzled with caramel sauce.  Lord.  I'd just gotten back from two week of vacation in California and was having trouble adjusting to the humidity, work stress and endless schlepping.  This meal and this restaurant reminded me of why I love living here.  Then we walked home, full and happy and relaxed.Also....the bread.  You like your carbs?  You're my kind of person.  They bake their own bread..and send you home with bread if they have leftover at the end of the night. Come on!  I'll be back and will bring many friends.",5.0
"This is not a review of the restaurant, but of the bread, which I have bought at the Down to Earth farmer's market on 5th Ave. in Park Slope. Their baguette is the best I've ever had outside of Paris. I would rank it even higher than Almondine's, which is outstanding.",5.0
"Oh Runner & Stone, I wanted to like you so much more...I love the way the restaurant looks, the story behind the furniture in the restaurant, the olive pastry that was served at the beginning, and even the beer choices.For food, we went with a large assortment, some duck pastrami, both risottos (cauliflower and mushroom), orechiette, and the lamb merguez for myself.  First, the duck pastrami was good, but not memorable in the way that duck can be.  I would definitely recommend both risottos and skipping the other apps actually.  Now the lamb merguez was okay, but the combination with the three bean salad just seemed off and actually ruined the dish I think, there could definitely be a better pairing.  The orechiette was a little on the flavorless side I thought, good pork sausage should've made a stronger impression in the dish I thought.  To summarize...is this a bad place?  No...but I do hope they continue to experiment with the menu.  Just don't take off the risottos!",3.0

"Who thought one of New York's most exciting restaurant scenes could bloom from a desolate stretch of 3rd Avenue near a government Superfund site?Littleneck and The Pines have been my go-to Brooklyn restaurants for the past six months, only a stone's throw, and a cold winter walk, from the R train at Union St. Runner & Stone has recently opened across the street, and I can foresee the long two-hour waits and an attendant caravan of baby strollers after word gets out that this place is one of the best brunch spots in all of Brooklyn.After several double espressos and brief repartee with a former co-worker about our New Year's shenanigans, we proceeded to the serious business of ordering brunch.The highlights:* Grappa-cured striped bass that resonated with an intensely briny, flavor* Short rib soup with faro with a meaty, unctuousness that sticks to the ribs (pun intended);* A smoked grilled cheese sandwich that made me believe in ""Cheese""-us Christ; After the repast, we proceeded to systematically tear into one of their flaky croissants. We both re-enacted the famous Bunk/McNulty dialogue from Season One of The Wire, where they both repeatedly utter a four-letter expletive while examining a crime scene. There are croissants, and there are croissants; Runner and Stone's have an impeccable, rich butteriness that rolls around your mouth like ""R's"" from a native Spaniard.Don't stone(wall), just run to Runner & Stone.",5.0

"I have two memories of this place. First, I called a girl whom I was meeting for the first time ""the opposite of a fashionista."" I meant that as a compliment but she took it as an insult, namely, ""You are frumpy."" Sorry.Other memory: Walking here. I crossed a bridge over the Gowanus Canal, which has a murky emerald surface reminiscent of my grandma's Ford Pinto (before she torched it for the insurance) or a week-old Shamrock Shake coagulating on the windowsill of a junkie's rented room. The canal also looks like the toxic waste that Robocop sprayed all over the bad guy with the red hair in the first Robocop movie, which is to say, that canal be nasty. Maybe you should find an alternative route if you are walking to this part of Brooklyn, because combined with the grey weather this season, I found myself contemplating my death that afternoon, and that's even before I learned that Runner and Stone had run out of their famous homemade breads.Usually, when I contemplate my demise, it's a laughably macho daydream in which LA gang members gun me down like they did my lyrical soul mate Tupac Shakur. That's not to say that I secretly identify with Tupac Shakur; I openly identify with Tupac Shakur. This has caused me a lot of grief over the years, especially when I worked on Chicago's gritty West Side in my youth. Back then, I had a Tupac sticker on my old Subaru and one time, when the police pulled me over for doing like 85 on a residential street (speed limit 20, school zone, etc), the officer said, ""I am going to let you leave with a warning, because this neighborhood is worse than Afghanistan. Before I give you this break, I want to know something."" ""What's that, sir?"" I asked. Cop: ""Why do you have a Tupac Shakur bumper sticker? Is it irony? Are you just clueless? Or weird? You with your blue Subaru and your windbreaker, and Tupac, and...I just don't get it.""I told the policeman that Tupac was an amazing lyricist (if only an OK rapper) and ""a true ghetto martyr"" and the cop was like, ""Would you just get the fuck out of here already,"" and I did, because he had a gun and red skin, like someone who'd been drinking in his car all day.Anyway, back to the purpose of Yelp (restaurant reviews, triviality, wounding the ambitions of gutsy small-business owners...)This is supposed to be a pastry place, but we got there at like 3 p.m., so all the pastries had been consumed by earlier brunch mobs. I therefore can't write about the texture and color of the dough, or the way the surface of the bread broke on my teeth and released pleasing aromas up my nose, which must be a drag for all you virgins, er, foodies.R&S only has bottled beer, which is okay for most people, but tragic for me because I feel more dignified when I have draft beer, like it's a magical beverage birthed in a tube of golden butter as opposed to crudely bottled by cackling Milwaukee nitwits like Laverne and Shirley. Distressingly, the people I ate with were just drinking coffee so that designated me the table lush, and if one is designated Table Lush, he should  at least drink on his own terms. For me, that's draft beer. That's not the fault of the restaurant. That's what experts call a ""neurosis"" or ""being difficult,"" and I would strike these comments from this review were I writing about a restaurant in a healthier city. But New York (and Brooklyn in particular) is all about placating mouthy self-reflective turds, so here we are.I had Eggs Benedict. The eggs were firm and the egg juice spilled out and hugged the rim of the plate just the way that kindergartners and I prefer. It circled that dish and gamely rested there for absorption by my muffin and by stray pieces of bread that I made my lady give me off her plate. Actually, I didn't ""make"" her give me her leftover bread; I never stoop that low. What I do is this: I stare at her plate intensely, the way guys in prison documentaries stare at the ass of a ""fish."" My girl eventually gets tired of the eye abuse and shoves her plate my way. It's awesome.Overall, Runner and Stone makes a good solid brunch. It's not mind-blowing, which is what seems to be the requirement for 5 stars on this website. Maybe I'd bump it up a star if they had a trapeze in the middle of the place or a singing minotaur on the wait staff, or a wig maker who goes from table to table offering to measure your head and craft you a toupee, or whatever those losers in the Times think Brooklyn is all about.

"I have been here twice this week, first for dinner and then for a takeout lunch.The food and service are both exquisite. The staff is friendly and attentive, and I found the dishes to be creative and reasonably priced (which is not always a given in oh-so-trendy Brooklyn restaurants).For dinner, we shared the fettucine with duck sausage and mushrooms, and the pancetta-wrapped hake. We also had a side of the rainbow chard and an appetizer of fish (I think it was sable) and fennel. For dessert, we had the brownie soaked in rye. Our server, Bill, also recommended a nice bottle of dolcetto, which paired nicely with all the food.The meal started with an amuse-bouche of olive puff pastry, which was a great way to whet the appetite (and would be great as a full-size croissant for breakfast for us savory fans -- note to the baker!).This place is a bakery first and foremost and the assortment of breads was very fresh, as was the olive oil and the house-made butter. We especially liked the miche, but they were all good.The hake was our favorite of all the dishes. The pancetta was slightly smoky but not too salty and perfectly complemented the fish, which also came with a bit of cauliflower risotto. The fettucine with sausage was a solid, rib-sticking winter dish.The only off note of the evening was the rye in the brownie, which didn't really complement the chocolate.Dinner was relaxed, although that might have been because they were few diners on a winter weeknight. A jazz mix played over the loudspeakers. The manager, Elias, stopped by to see how everything was and answer our questions about the restaurant.I enjoyed the meal so much that I came back the next day to check out their lunch options, which are meager -- just a few sandwiches, salads and a soup of the day. I got the $9 mackerel banh mi (tomato, onion, cucumber, daikon, etc.) to go.. It was delicious -- great smoky flavor. The coffee was nothing special but the array of breads was quite impressive. I tried a sample of the poppyseed cake, which was appropriately moist, unlike most such cakes I have eaten in the past. Alex and Natalie, who were working the lunch shift, were both friendly and even let me peek into the bakery.Overall, this is a fabulous addition to the neighborhood and I can easily envision becoming a regular visitor, Looking forward to how the menu changes with the seasons (and they will win me over for life if they start baking sourdough baguettes).",5.0

I tried two of their sandwiches, both of which were tasty, but nothing extraordinary. The grilled cheddar on rye with pickled apples and crispy pancetta is an interesting take on a grilled cheese sandwich. The pickled apples certainly adds an unexpected brininess; however, it overshadowed the pancetta, which was not crispy at all. I think this sandwich wasn't particularly fitting for such a cold day; in fact the pickled applies might have made it taste a little lighter and less hearty than what I might want on a winter's day.

"Showed up at 9:58pm on a Monday, party of 3, starving, after suddenly figuring out that places were putting up their ""closed"" signs for the night. When we walked in, we were informed that the kitchen was closed, but told to wait as they went down to check just in case. They said they'll keep the kitchen open for us. This is already gearing up to be a 5-star review, as you can see, and we haven't even gotten to the food.Our waiter, Vincent, was very friendly and patient, told us about their sustainable furniture, and didn't rush us at all, even though we were the last customers of the night. He even brought over some extra wine on the house and some buttery croissant thingies. And the food? Excellent! I couldn't get over how good my house-made orecchiette with house-made sausage and broccoli rabe was. It was perfection: perfectly chewy/al dente, balanced, not too greasy, and the rabe tender, but not woody. And portion size was great, too (on the smaller size if you're really into huge portions). My boyfriend had the ribeye, which I tasted and thought was juicy and delicious. The other person in our party had a salad that had these amazing little fried beans in it: mushy on the inside, slightly crunchy on the outside. Sometimes it's the little things. And oh yeah, the bread and butter they put down is really good. AND, AND, as if that wasn't enough, I guess because we were the last people there, they sent us home with a baguette and two loaves of their delicious bread that were made fresh that day.  I'd give 6 stars if I could. A big thank you to Vincent and the rest of the staff there for making our night awesome.",5.0
"Was so excited for yet another beautiful and delicious looking restaurant to open up in the area, I've really enjoyed both Littleneck and The Pines and am so happy for what they do for the area.  I went for lunch with my friend and we ordered the chicken cacciatore sandwich, turkey confit salad, the soup of the day which was white bean with escarole and a red pepper puree, and two coffees + tip = $39.  The sandwich I was particularly excited for to see how chicken cacciatore would be interpreted into a sandwich, however, it was a basic chicken sandwich, bland, and was a bit on the small side.  The salad while lacking in presentation, sort of looked like salads you make at home was actually really flavorful and tasty.  The soup was a bit cold which wasn't helped by the cold temperature of the red pepper puree.  It was a bit thick and lacked flavor.  In other reviews people seem to be raving about the baked goods which really look pretty amazing.  While I will be back to sample the baked goods I'm a bit disappointed by the food service and will definitely not be back for lunch, but may give dinner a fair shot in a few weeks when there has been ample time for kinks to be worked out.  In short, the restaurant is beautiful, the people were nice, but food was such a  disappointment",2.0
"I had an amazing time at this restaurant. The bread and appetizers are incredible, the Hummus is to die for! I had the roasted chicken with buckwheat dumplings that was absolutely delicious. My wife had a lamb dish that she Loved! The duck pastrami app was very creative. And leave room for the deserts. They make a cheesecake so smooth it tastes like cheesecake flavored whipped-cream. The best part is that the prices for these 'culinary works of art' are very low! I was pleasantly surprised when I saw my bill. Can't wait to go back to this restaurant again....and again.",5.0

By far their stellar fortes are the traditional rolls and bread, but they do make a mean poppyseed loaf and a rich, airy brownie. Service is great, with a knowledgeable team behind the bar. If you go for brunch, be smart and order the thing that sells out (at least in the case when I was there): the Butternut Squash Fritter on Roll with house-made ricotta. Fortunately, I ordered it in the nick of time without knowing the mystical addictive properties embedded within. The roll is slightly hollowed out inside to encompass the big squash fritter, which mind you, is fried to absolute perfection. But if you really needed a reason to eat your vegetables, the fritter will burst upon the first bite with delectably soft ricotta, which plays oh so nicely with the crispness of the squash. The sandwich gets an earthy taste and pop of color with layers of dark leafy spinach, and by three mouthfuls in, you're convinced this is the best damn sandwich you've ever had. You pity the poor customer left wanting one. Perhaps this is a sign that this needs to be a well-stocked option in the kitchen. I'm sure anything else on the menu would have been just as pleasurable. But I'll curse the day that I go all the way out to that dolphin-harboring canal and fail to order my butternut squash fritter roll. It is really that amazing.",5.0
"I came here during ""The Total Gowanus Immersion"" expecting a free beer (check) and a pretentious expensive brunch. But I was delightfully mistaken. My Pork Ciabatta with greens ran $13 (and there were cheaper options) and they eschewed the traditional southern BBQ for a lighter, herb infused touch. It was very good.

"Love this place! Their croissants are some of the best I've had in the city- both almond and chocolate. My husband is even more addicted- he's there every morning!My only sorrow (and reason for 4 stars, not 5) is that the ADDICTIVE pecan financiers they had when they first opened (that I was eventually buying three at a time!) have been replaced by a pistachio-lemon version.. I'm NOT a lemon fan :(Come on Runner & Stone! Give us non-citrus people some other financier choices!!!!",4.0
"Great baked goods, great dinners, killer butter, nice people.  Very excited to have this place nearby now.The butter is incredible.  I don't know what could make it so good, but it is by far the best I've ever had.  And that goes into the croissants, which are also the best I've ever had.  The bread?  Outstanding too.I've also been in for dinner, and it's a mighty fine dinner at a decent price.  We had the chicken (very juicy and delicious), lamb (also awesome), and duck pasta (rich and delicious).The staff has always been really friendly and great to be around.  I hope they're successful in this new place - though not so successful I can't get in.",5.0
"Had a pleasant dinner recently, during which I tried the special soup (a broccoli, ham and white bean soup with a vegetable broth) and the Haddock (special fish of the day).  The soup was lovely, but the fish was way too salty.  My companions had the lamb burger (over priced at $26 for what they served) and the special meatballs with polenta.  Everyone seemed relatively pleased, but decided we would most likely not return.  The quality was not on par with the prices.",3.0
"Showed up at 9:58pm on a Monday, party of 3, starving, after suddenly figuring out that places were putting up their ""closed"" signs for the night. When we walked in, we were informed that the kitchen was closed, but told to wait as they went down to check just in case. They said they'll keep the kitchen open for us. This is already gearing up to be a 5-star review, as you can see, and we haven't even gotten to the food.Our waiter, Vincent, was very friendly and patient, told us about their sustainable furniture, and didn't rush us at all, even though we were the last customers of the night. He even brought over some extra wine on the house and some buttery croissant thingies. And the food? Excellent! I couldn't get over how good my house-made orecchiette with house-made sausage and broccoli rabe was. It was perfection: perfectly chewy/al dente, balanced, not too greasy, and the rabe tender, but not woody. And portion size was great, too (on the smaller size if you're really into huge portions). My boyfriend had the ribeye, which I tasted and thought was juicy and delicious. The other person in our party had a salad that had these amazing little fried beans in it: mushy on the inside, slightly crunchy on the outside. Sometimes it's the little things. And oh yeah, the bread and butter they put down is really good. AND, AND, as if that wasn't enough, I guess because we were the last people there, they sent us home with a baguette and two loaves of their delicious bread that were made fresh that day.  I'd give 6 stars if I could. A big thank you to Vincent and the rest of the staff there for making our night awesome.",5.0
"Was so excited for yet another beautiful and delicious looking restaurant to open up in the area, I've really enjoyed both Littleneck and The Pines and am so happy for what they do for the area.  I went for lunch with my friend and we ordered the chicken cacciatore sandwich, turkey confit salad, the soup of the day which was white bean with escarole and a red pepper puree, and two coffees + tip = $39.  The sandwich I was particularly excited for to see how chicken cacciatore would be interpreted into a sandwich, however, it was a basic chicken sandwich, bland, and was a bit on the small side.  The salad while lacking in presentation, sort of looked like salads you make at home was actually really flavorful and tasty.  The soup was a bit cold which wasn't helped by the cold temperature of the red pepper puree.  It was a bit thick and lacked flavor.  In other reviews people seem to be raving about the baked goods which really look pretty amazing.  While I will be back to sample the baked goods I'm a bit disappointed by the food service and will definitely not be back for lunch, but may give dinner a fair shot in a few weeks when there has been ample time for kinks to be worked out.  In short, the restaurant is beautiful, the people were nice, but food was such a  disappointment",2.0
"I had an amazing time at this restaurant. The bread and appetizers are incredible, the Hummus is to die for! I had the roasted chicken with buckwheat dumplings that was absolutely delicious. My wife had a lamb dish that she Loved! The duck pastrami app was very creative. And leave room for the deserts. They make a cheesecake so smooth it tastes like cheesecake flavored whipped-cream. The best part is that the prices for these 'culinary works of art' are very low! I was pleasantly surprised when I saw my bill. Can't wait to go back to this restaurant again....and again.",5.0
"This place has it all for a quick bite or a formal sit down dinner.  The breakfast offerings (pastries, breads) are the best you will taste anywhere.  They prepare and bake everything on premises and it's all outstanding.  The brunch/lunch menu portions are perfect and the prices are very reasonable.  The Chicken Cacciatore sandwich and roasted pumpkin salad were out of site.  They have a nice dinner menu and they change their menus seasonally.  Runner and Stone is a tremendous addition to the neighborhood and I would absolutely recommend it to everyone.",5.0

"First - I'm just going to say right off that the only reason this is 4-star review is because I have yet to try out the pastry... I'm sure once I do, I'll be able to upgrade to 5-star!  I heard about this new spot from a friend of mine and had to check it out.  I made an online reservation (super easy) and was set for a dinner for 2 at 7:00.  Upon entering, the atmosphere was welcoming and warm.  Lots of smiles - as one might expect with the opening of a new restaurant, but the atmosphere didn't lend itself to being new, but rather it seemed like it had always been there.  My friend and I were seated in a cozy downstairs area of the restaurant... and set our sights on some evening drinks.  The drink list offered a great selection of red, white and sparkling wines, along with cocktails and beers.  If you're looking for draft, you'll  have to look elsewhere... bottles only (for now anyway).  I started off with a nice prosecco and then selected the grappa-cured striped bass appetizer.  It was served like a carpaccio, but a little thicker - and delicious.  I'm not a fan of fennel, but it paired well the bass.  My friend tried out the apple panzanella, and while I didn't try it, she certainly enjoyed it, as she cleaned the plate!  She had one of the cocktails, but I can't recall which one... very delicious!  For  my main course, I had the hanger steak with pototoes and mixed vegetables paired with a glass of red wine. Everything was cooked to perfection.  My friend enjoyed the pancetta wrapped fish of the day (today's fish was hake) served over a cauliflower risotto.  Like me... she ate everything on her plate!  We were too full to order dessert, but I'm sure it would've been amazing.  I could smell the aromatic coffee and I now regret not getting a cup while I had the chance.  Next time!  I really enjoyed dining here, and look forward to returning.  The food, the setting, the service, the price... just a really pleasant way to spend an evening.  Finally, it doesn't say yet, but this restaurant accepts both cash & credit.",4.0

"Another tasty restaurant to round out the Littleneck and Pines trifecta on Third Avenue. The pasta here is a little less tasty than The Pines's, but all of Runner & Stone's pastries are out of this world. Come during the day and get yourself a tiny financier--it tastes like the best pistachio olive oil cake you'll ever have. Come at night and get the complimentary 16-layer phyllo dough square. Order the chicken--I don't say that often--which comes with satisfyingly dense buckwheat dumplings that have been marinating in a savory, mushroom-y broth. Even the free bread basket was delicious, and I was very pleased to see the butter pre-softened (my gauge of a good restaurant). My only regret is that even with a meager two entrees and appetizer split between two people, the deceptively filling dishes left me with no room to order what was sure to be a phenomenal dessert. I'll probably be back, because I want to reward any new restaurant in Brooklyn that cares about people enough to accept reservations.",4.0
"If i could give this place 0 stars, i would. The service was terrible. The waitress we had was slow and didn't know anything. She took 25 minutes to bring us our coffees which one was supposed to be large but gave us a small and when I asked her a question about the cookies, she had no clue. I ordered all things that were already pre- made (almond croissant, a palmier, and bread) and those came AFTER the hot brunch food my bf ordered. She only brought it to me after i asked her for it. Seriously you just have to go to the front and get it because its pre-made already. The only thing decent was the almond croissant. Her poor service made us miss our plans. My bf ordered eggs and sausage which took forever. It doesnt take rocket science to make it. It wasnt because the restaurant was busy either.

"If only for the bread (and there's a lot more that's good) this place is worth a visit. The have arguably the best  bread basket in Brooklyn. Three different varieties ,all house made: baguette,spelt and whole wheat. Each equally delicious  with the house-made butter. In contrast to many others I'm not a fan of their grappa-cured bass but think their duck pastrami starter is sensational ( a couple of more slices would be nice)  and they also have some unusual and very tasty salads. For mains the  lamb shank is a stand out ,and a very generous portion to boot, but we've also  savored their pancetta-wrapped fish--changes daily. Vegetarians don't despair because there is plentty for you in their excellent pasta dept. Save room for desserts because, like the bread, they really shine.  A lot of small places, including some of my favorites, have lackluster desserts but not R&S.

"First - I'm just going to say right off that the only reason this is 4-star review is because I have yet to try out the pastry... I'm sure once I do, I'll be able to upgrade to 5-star!  I heard about this new spot from a friend of mine and had to check it out.  I made an online reservation (super easy) and was set for a dinner for 2 at 7:00.  Upon entering, the atmosphere was welcoming and warm.  Lots of smiles - as one might expect with the opening of a new restaurant, but the atmosphere didn't lend itself to being new, but rather it seemed like it had always been there.  My friend and I were seated in a cozy downstairs area of the restaurant... and set our sights on some evening drinks.  The drink list offered a great selection of red, white and sparkling wines, along with cocktails and beers.  If you're looking for draft, you'll  have to look elsewhere... bottles only (for now anyway).  I started off with a nice prosecco and then selected the grappa-cured striped bass appetizer.  It was served like a carpaccio, but a little thicker - and delicious.  I'm not a fan of fennel, but it paired well the bass.  My friend tried out the apple panzanella, and while I didn't try it, she certainly enjoyed it, as she cleaned the plate!  She had one of the cocktails, but I can't recall which one... very delicious!  For  my main course, I had the hanger steak with pototoes and mixed vegetables paired with a glass of red wine. Everything was cooked to perfection.  My friend enjoyed the pancetta wrapped fish of the day (today's fish was hake) served over a cauliflower risotto.  Like me... she ate everything on her plate!  We were too full to order dessert, but I'm sure it would've been amazing.  I could smell the aromatic coffee and I now regret not getting a cup while I had the chance.  Next time!  I really enjoyed dining here, and look forward to returning.  The food, the setting, the service, the price... just a really pleasant way to spend an evening.  Finally, it doesn't say yet, but this restaurant accepts both cash & credit.",4.0
"Enjoyed a fantastic brunch at Runner and Stone! The French toast and omelet special were out of this world. The food was perfectly prepared, and added touches like homemade butter and ketchup really make a difference. The breads and pastries are the best I ever had!! The staff was friendly and attentive!",5.0
"Another tasty restaurant to round out the Littleneck and Pines trifecta on Third Avenue. The pasta here is a little less tasty than The Pines's, but all of Runner & Stone's pastries are out of this world. Come during the day and get yourself a tiny financier--it tastes like the best pistachio olive oil cake you'll ever have. Come at night and get the complimentary 16-layer phyllo dough square. Order the chicken--I don't say that often--which comes with satisfyingly dense buckwheat dumplings that have been marinating in a savory, mushroom-y broth. Even the free bread basket was delicious, and I was very pleased to see the butter pre-softened (my gauge of a good restaurant). My only regret is that even with a meager two entrees and appetizer split between two people, the deceptively filling dishes left me with no room to order what was sure to be a phenomenal dessert. I'll probably be back, because I want to reward any new restaurant in Brooklyn that cares about people enough to accept reservations.",4.0
"If i could give this place 0 stars, i would. The service was terrible. The waitress we had was slow and didn't know anything. She took 25 minutes to bring us our coffees which one was supposed to be large but gave us a small and when I asked her a question about the cookies, she had no clue. I ordered all things that were already pre- made (almond croissant, a palmier, and bread) and those came AFTER the hot brunch food my bf ordered. She only brought it to me after i asked her for it. Seriously you just have to go to the front and get it because its pre-made already. The only thing decent was the almond croissant. Her poor service made us miss our plans. My bf ordered eggs and sausage which took forever. It doesnt take rocket science to make it. It wasnt because the restaurant was busy either. There were less than 15 ppl there and we were the waitress' only table. Wow, this place needs to change thier waitstaff.  Would not recommend or goto again. Sheesh this place made me mad that we ate there.",1.0
Had a delicious dinner there with friends.  Environment was perfect for catching up - a drink at the bar and then fantastic dinner.  Even the pre-dinner baked goods were mind blowing.,5.0
"Had dinner there on Valentine's night...it was spectacular!  Cocktails, good wine list and awesome dinner menu.  Can't wait to try out brunch.",5.0
"Bread is great, but everything from pricing, portion and coffee sucks. The soup portion is ridiculous (half of a small container), sandwiches are way to expensive and the coffee is horrible.",1.0
"If only for the bread (and there's a lot more that's good) this place is worth a visit. The have arguably the best  bread basket in Brooklyn. Three different varieties ,all house made: baguette,spelt and whole wheat. Each equally delicious  with the house-made butter. In contrast to many others I'm not a fan of their grappa-cured bass but think their duck pastrami starter is sensational ( a couple of more slices would be nice)  and they also have some unusual and very tasty salads. For mains the  lamb shank is a stand out ,and a very generous portion to boot, but we've also  savored their pancetta-wrapped fish--changes daily. Vegetarians don't despair because there is plentty for you in their excellent pasta dept. Save room for desserts because, like the bread, they really shine.  A lot of small places, including some of my favorites, have lackluster desserts but not R&S. The rye brownie (chocolate but with a hint of  rye as in bread ) with whiskey-flavored ice cream is favorite of ours .
