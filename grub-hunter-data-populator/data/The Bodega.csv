"Great selection of wine and beer. Even better prices. Try the cheese/meat plates and you get a TON of cheese and meat... a much better offer than any other restaurant in NYC that gives you pennies of a cheese/meat plate. The sandwiches I've heard are really great too.Bushwick is getting so club-y, and every time I go out with friends, we really want some place that's cool, cheap and low-key. If we don't start the night at the Bodega, we always seem to end up at the Bodega.",5.0
"I recently attended Bodega's drink n draw before the holiday! I had never been to the restaurant but had it bookmarked on my yelp for awhile. It was a nice crisp winter evening. I arrived just in time to make myself comfortable. There was a great turn out of fun people. The organizer was extremely friendly. I had never even been to a drink and draw but love to draw. My brother consistently tells me to draw actual people for practice. I ordered a little beer shot special and found a corner seat. I brought my own pencils and eraser. Sketch pads and pencils were also provided. The nude model was bopping around in a robe until her debut. I loved the Xmas tree on the stage and the ornaments and lights outlining the windows. The first round were quick poses. I ended up drawing the background behind my quick sketch. The second round was longer poses. The model was a true professional. She posed in beautiful elongated poses and contorted herself in interesting profiles. I even liked that she had a top bun. All my sketches flowed and were fun to do. I ended up ordering a veggie grilled cheese. I loved it's melty goodness! It also came with some chips and a side pickle! You have to have a side pickle.  I had a blast at the event. I would definitely return for a drink and draw or a sandwich anytime! I also loved that the Graduate was playing in the background. Side note: this is not the kind of bodega where you find snacks, cats and cigarettes...in case that's what you are looking for. My friend thought I was drawing at an actual bodega! Ha!",4.0
"I want to start off by saying the food we got was incredible. We went here for brunch and we got Huevos Rancheros and another dish that was a Lox on Bread sort of thing (forgot what they called it). Both were absolutely amazing. BUT I think they did not think about both aesthetics and space planning at this restaurant, which are key to a great experience.The place its self isn't set up correctly. There are only two tables that felt warm and inviting so we sat at the bar. I started with mimosa but wanted to change to another drink I saw on the menu as my second drink (I think it was a Michalada which is just beer and hot sauce basically) and the bartender, who was quite nice and friendly, was annoyed I wanted this drink bc she had ""just thrown away all the ice"". When she did that she lost a drink sale which I assume is a big source of revenue for the restaurant. There weren't too many seats at the bar and the host sat at the end of the bar making it un usable for someone else when they walked in. Its cool to be casual, and I understand this is Bushwick but when your running a restaurant there is certain etiquette and also just plain common (business) sense you must use, and they clearly missed the memo.It is a VERY small place. The kitchen is exposed, so you see the chef cooking which I don't mind. But there is a way to do it and make it look very clean and pretty. There was a bunch of junk shoved in the back, they could have easily put behind a curtain or something... or had a storage closet for but instead while I was eating I had to look at it. I found it distracting. Behind the ""kitchenette"" area was a large video screen and a projector. This could have been cool if they had a video screen on the back wall of the resturant, and had old movies playing or something like that. Could had added to the interest and the ambiance. But someone installed a projector and a screen ($$$$$) but gave NO THOUGHT to functionality! So DUMB.Qhen you walk in to the resturant on the left there was a small stage, which was not being used for a live band or anything, and therefore a poor use of space. I asked the host about why they had it and he let me know they occasionally do drink and draw and use it for that. I think they are loosing out on $ for that space, bc if they put a booth where that stage is they could seat 4-5 more people. When they do drink and draw they can drag in some sort of stand for the model to stand on! What matters most is how many tables they are serving daily not something that goes on maybe once a week (DUMB).Overall: FOOD WAS AMAZING ... physical space is pretty wack. Their lack of food industry professionally leads me to believe that if changes are not made, this place won't be around for long. Especially when you take a walk around the block in this area and there are a lot of sleek well run places.",2.0
I went for Brunch because of a suggestion from a friend. My party and I all got a different version of food on a bagel (BLT/salmon/eggs). It took over 45 minutes to get our food. Yes the staff came up and apologized because there was a big order ahead of us - but other tables who were sat after us got their food before us. Overall it was really disappointing and had discouraged us from coming back. There are so many delicious brunch places in Brooklyn and unfortunately this isn't one of them.,2.0

"Maybe we all just ordered wrong, but no one at our table was happy with the beer or wine. The music left a lot to be desired and the bar was almost empty on a wintery Saturday night.

"I literally just had the worst experience at this bar food spot that used to be my favorite in the world. I had happy birthdays here for the past two years, and I just left this place crying.I went for brunch on Fourth of July. The waitress greeted me and then told me how they didn't have half the menu, it's 2 pm but that's fine. So I ordered the Texas Toast with green eggs and jelly. The food came but it was nothing like what I imagined. I have always trusted their food, so I dug in even though it was a piece of white toast with eggs and some stuff smushed on the side, with a heavily dressed salad.I got into the toast, ate my fill, and then got into the green salad which tasted a little rotten. No one came to check on how I liked the food. But at the end I told the waitress that it wasn't what I expected. She told me ok. There was an overflowing garbage in my face at eye level and that didn't help the experience. Then the bartender came over and proceeded to lecture to me about how this is how the food comes. I told him I would pay for it, and I didn't need to be lectured to. They said they wouldn't have taken it off the bill anyway because I ate half of it. I work in restaurants and I would never speak to or treat a customer, especially a regular (I've loved this place for three years) with this disrespect and meanness. As he was talking to me I started to cry because I really felt he was intimidating me. He continued to tell me not to tell him how to do his job. As I walked out he yelled ""Psycho Bitch"" at me, when I was in earshot.I have never had such bad service or treatment in New York in my life. I will never go back to ""the bodega"". Not only was I insulted but cursed at, and my feedback which I was honestly just giving because $12 is a lot for bad food, was thrown in my face.No one deserves to be treated with disregard or disrespect. And that seems to be the new way to treat guests here. I'm not having it.",1.0

"Is always busy but I got lucky and went there the best time on a Saturday afternoon.  The French toast was amazing.   The bodega bagel is a unique twist on a New York brunch staple, the bagel with lox.  The side salad that comes with it can be used as a sandwich topping yum.  The bloody mary is balanced to perfection but they run out so get there early.  All in all this is one of the best places to get brunch in Busbwick.",5.0
"Like many NYC based bodegas, The Bodega occupies a street corner,a strategic position where opposite lines of pedestrian traffic meet. Unlike those other mini marts of liquor, lotto tickets and convenience items, The Bodega has a brunch that I will gladly drive 20 minutes along Metropolitan Avenue to experience. It's not that I don't inherently adore the pierogi and pizza shops along the way on Metropolitan but my mission and purpose is to partake in the reasonably priced brunch eats.The ambiance is relaxed, with a few tables but plenty of counter and bar space to nestle into. During my experiences here I've spotted every one from chess players to out of town parents visiting their city living offspring and everyone in between. I especially appreciate the acoustics and choice of music (at least on Sundays, I haven't been otherwise). I do want to fly into the danger zone of the Top Gun and Footloose soundtracks! It's always been a lively best of the 80's that has rekindled my interest in that decades musical hits and misses.As for the edibles, I haven't had a single awful brunch here, the kind that leaves one filled with regret and the desire to go back to the future. (Yes, I have heard Huey Lewis here as well). So the dilemma I always face is between egg and bread based brunches. Do I choose the 3 egg scramble, always cooked to perfection? Or the French toast served with candied bacon? Let's not forget our aquatic smoked friend, gravlax on a bagel.Last time we ordered our respective entrees and then , for sheer gluttony alone, shared the bagel. Factor in cost for coffee (Grumpy!) and tea and the grand total was still less than other brunch peddlers who present a far inferior product. (Approximately $30 for two) Another appreciated touch is the no questions asked presentation of a carafe of water so I can refill my own glass instead of waiting for the whims of a waiter as experienced at other eateries. We're all adults here and I can actually extend my arm to pour water into my glass from a bottle. When the weather improves I'll have to visit in the evening for the non-brunch experience.

I was in Bushwick for an art opening and Bodega was the perfect spot to swing by afterwards. We had a group of 7 and there was a table waiting for us. The food was great!!!! We ordered a bottle of wine and a variety of meats & cheeses. It was the perfect 10pm snack and I was very impressed with the prices. Bottle of wine was $32 total meal price was $88 for 7 people and I was very full! The crowd there was chill as well.  Not too cool for school but actually rather lovely.

"Why is this place so far away from me? And I live in Brooklyn! Whining aside, I spent a lovely wine soaked evening at The Bodega with friends who live in the area and come often.

"It's basically a perfect Brooklyn bar, with a local flavor of Bushwick. Being that you walk outside and can see the warehouses. It's pretty cool. I always enjoyed coming to the Bodega. It's a good place to meet your friends and regale them with a nice-tasting beer. In a way there's too much variety, but I can appreciate the menu for what it is - European, and opulent.Which isn't to say that the Bodega panders to the posh and the bourgeoisie. On the contrary, it is located in the Jefferson area of Bushwick, a rapidly gentrifying though still low-key and minimalist neighborhood. It's a very cool area, and this is a very cool bar. Basically I like the Bodega and have been many times because it's stylish but friendly, and it's located in an area with a unique aesthetic. It's within a few minutes of the train, but close enough to what would look to some like Detroit, to make for conversation pieces. I recommend this place highly.

I had a difficult time ordering from the menu, and I am a pretty good eater.We eventually settled on the Oyster Mushroom Hash (which should come with some meat to make it into an amazing hash)... and I'm not sure what else even looking at the menu 2x. The good news is that bc it is a wine bar.... they have some tasty wine of which was drunk at brunch. YUM. Sparkling red wine for summer? Yes please.",3.0
"It's basically a perfect Brooklyn bar, with a local flavor of Bushwick. Being that you walk outside and can see the warehouses. It's pretty cool. I always enjoyed coming to the Bodega. It's a good place to meet your friends and regale them with a nice-tasting beer. In a way there's too much variety, but I can appreciate the menu for what it is - European, and opulent.Which isn't to say that the Bodega panders to the posh and the bourgeoisie. On the contrary, it is located in the Jefferson area of Bushwick, a rapidly gentrifying though still low-key and minimalist neighborhood. It's a very cool area, and this is a very cool bar. Basically I like the Bodega and have been many times because it's stylish but friendly, and it's located in an area with a unique aesthetic. It's within a few minutes of the train, but close enough to what would look to some like Detroit, to make for conversation pieces. I recommend this place highly. I don't quite remember but I think that the music was indie/electronic/beats.",4.0
"I've been here twice, once to watch the last presidential election, and the other time for a leisurely drink. I've sampled the beer, the wine, and the food, and everything has been delicious. And I've had good service every time. How could I not be a fan?",4.0
"Apparently all these swanky type places are rather new to Bushwick.  I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing considering I'm also new to Bushwick.  That and I'm a yelper... But this place is nice, sexy dark interior, and plenty of wine choices.  I recall ordering a pinot noir and thinking I was getting a red.  When a white wine came out, my date explained to me that wines are not white or red based on the grape but rather if they include the skin of the grape.  Who knew.  While we enjoyed our wine, a cute girl from a neighboring table came over to me.  While I thought she was going to ask me for my phone number or grab me and makeout, she handed me her camera and asked if I could take a picture of their group.  Sure of course I said.After a few false starts we got some good shots, and I went back to my date and my glass of wine.  Great spot, stop in for a mid-week break.",4.0
"I have NOTHING negative to say about Bodega! I LOVE THE STAFF, LOVE THE SANDWICHES, LOVE THE BEER!Troy is my favorite! Nothing like having a midday drink and a sandwich while chatting with Troy!They have awesome sandwiches, salads, & meat and cheese plates, but my all time favorite is the BODEGA TUNA MELT IN YOUR MOUTH!

"Is it possible for a wine bar to be cuter than The Bodega? I think not. Friendly bartenders and staff, always. Great local and international wines that you can taste if you're not sure what to choose. Delish cheeses always served with homemade jam, and warm, thin slices of a baguette. There are also some really good trappist ales and other beers available, too.The last time I went it happened to be the night of the Golden Globes and The Bodega was showing it on a huge screen. They muted commercials and played awesome music in the mean time.I've also been there for brunch, attempting to eat and drink my way through a hangover. It worked.

"Walked down to Bodega twice this past week while staying with my friend who lives in the area. Wine on tap and they make it easy - red or white? It's pretty awesome because you don't have to think about it. They also have great beers - stouts, IPAs, pumpkin ales (it's October) and good food, too.

"Nice little place.  Great beers on tap.  Good snacks.  A number of reviews said it was quiet - well, I wouldn't exactly say so, though perhaps the standard nowadays is the howling noisepit that many NYC restaurants have become.  The service was slightly distracted, but friendly and by and large fine.  Bushwick is still a pit though (sorry, Shwick denizens).An afterthought: I would've thought that one place you wouldn't have to deal w/ kids is in a fucking bar in Bushwick.  But no.  Don't get me wrong: I like kids.  I just don't like 'em in bars.",4.0

And I stare at work spread sheets while the AC cools me off from the hot hot mouth sex we just had (and because it's summer and sista aint got an AC unit and it's hot).

One of the best places to get artisan beer.  The staff is supremely intelligent when it comes to specialty brews and are a pleasant bunch to talk to.The freshly cut charcuterie is an added bonus which happens to compliment their beer selection.  Definitely one of those places that you find yourself in when you just need to get a damn good beer.,4.0

The Beer and Wine Menu is broken down and describes every item so that you'll have the exact taste you're looking for. Everything is fairly priced and the food is also delicious. The Jive Turkey Sandwich is amazingggg and definitely a new favorite and Vegetarian options are available too. Staff is friendly and when i was there they were quite attractive. Its great that such a cute place exists so near to me, Bushwick needs more places like this!",4.0
One of the best places to get artisan beer.  The staff is supremely intelligent when it comes to specialty brews and are a pleasant bunch to talk to.The freshly cut charcuterie is an added bonus which happens to compliment their beer selection.  Definitely one of those places that you find yourself in when you just need to get a damn good beer.,4.0
"Good beer AND WINE on tap, friendly bar staff, and they play movies on weeknights?! I'm glad I moved to this neighborhood",4.0
"4 words: DEAD GUY ON TAP. No bars here in New York that I've been to seem to carry Rogue... which is the best. And the Bodega has the best Rogue beer, not in bottles, but on tap. That alone is enough to blind me to any problems a place may have.However, the bartender was attentive and the atmosphere is really nice. I have no complaints.",5.0
"What a gem! I almost never wander down to Bushwick... but if the neighborhood is filled with establishments like The Bodega, then I really need to get my ass out there more often.The Bodega's layout is pretty much centered around their long bar, and for good reason. They have numerous microbrews and craft beers on tap that rotate regularly, and even more domestic/imported selections in bottles. For those who fancy wine instead, they also have a good selection of reds and whites. Prices on all their drinks are phenomenal, better than any other wine bar I've been to - glasses are generously poured as well. They also have great brunch on the weekends, which I was fortunate enough to try with Daphne W. and Perry W. I personally loved their drunken french toast, made with fluffy eggy pain de mie with candied bacon, sauteed bananas, fresh strawberries and a brandy butter. While the brandy flavor didn't really come through for me, I still thought it was one of the better french toast platters I've tasted. My dear friends ordered the green eggs & jam and chorizo scramble, which they seemed to enjoy as well. In addition to the cozy atmosphere and solid food, the bartender and staff here really make it. Even though service was a bit slow on the Saturday we visited as one man operating the tiny kitchen was turning out every table's food, the friendly bartender more than made up for it by visiting our table personally with beer recommendations and even sample tastings of the beers on tap. I'd really like to check out The Bodega sometime for a chill dinner and try some of the small plates with wine.",4.0
"I hope this place ends up generating a little buzz because it is truly a quality spot.  I came during their soft opening last month and since then it still feels like they are figuring things out, but the atmosphere is just about as nice as one could hope for, in Bushwick or anywhere else.  They really managed to create a look and feel of a place that feels elegant without being pretentious.Their wines tend to be nicely priced ($5-9) and they have some interesting choices that have changed even in the last few weeks.  Their small plates are also a nice deal, with some well chosen cheese and cured meats.There are already a few great bars in the area (Northeast Kingdom, Wreck Room, Tandem) but this place fills a different niche nicely, and I am already finding this to be my go-to for a neighborhood drink.Worth the walk down the street, or a train ride if you're looking for something new!",5.0
I am glad to bring this place back to my hood likes.The nice owners of the place reached out to me and set this right - I managed to explain my disappointment and they definitely came towards me - I went back to Bodega last Saturday with some friends and enjoyed it a lot!I will definitely come back ( maybe checking who's bartending before stepping in :)...),4.0
"The newest destination in this burgeoning neighborhood is off to a solid start by offering unusual wines and high end beers. Pretentious factor is curbed by the genuine enthusiasm of the couple that own and run the business. Their mission to share ""wines off the beaten path"" is successful in its modest wine list ($8-9/glass); tasting these uniquely different wines was wholeheartedly encouraged prior to committing to a full glass. The beer list was drool-inducing, with a strong offering of Belgium brews ranging in price from mostly $8-9 to a couple priced around $25. Based on the existing beer options, the anticipated installment of a tap next week will really round out the pours.  A selection of antipasto including cheeses, olives, artichokes, and speck are offered at $3/ea or 9 for $15.",4.0

"This place is truly a nice addition to the neighborhood. The interior is simple, dark wood, inviting. It's relaxed, unpretentious, and serves up no attitude.

There's even a couple of wines on tap and [individually wrapped] chocolates for purchase. It's good to hang out with a few friends (there's a good number of tables, both inside and a few outside), perfect for a date, and even nice just to sit at the bar by yourself and enjoy a glass of wine. The only downside, depending on why you came here, is the front of the bar might randomly turn into a band playing or karaoke night, which can be awkward when you just wanted to chill.

"Went in last week and I am already a fan.Nice touch with a straightforward wine menu (and explanations of what to expect are note to the right, a nice touch for both wine enthusiasts and neophytes alike.) The couple who owns the place are attentive, generous, and incredibly welcoming. Upon inquiring about the cheeses available, they offered me a generous sampling of all three. Extremely affordable, too - wines range from $5-9 by the glass. For my boyfriend whose not a wine drinker, there was a small (yet tastefully chosen) selection of beers and ciders, both local and imported. Also reasonably priced, starting around $4-5 with of course, Lindemann's Framboise at $12 a bottle. Lets be honest, Lindemann's is expensive no matter where you go.  Good looks on the music, too (hand picked from the owners laptop, Jay Z circa '96? I'll take it.)No pretentiousness yet and really beautiful warm decor. Awesome for a new local spot. Man oh man do we really need this in the neighborhood!Do try, but don't forget they're closed on Mondays!",4.0

Most inviting and fun place to be.  They have an excellent beer selection and good wine.  For friends who do not drink they have some good options of fancy sodas.  The staff is super nice and the crowd that goes to this bar are nice neighborhood people.  I usually do a tour - The Bodega and then off to Pearls next door.  The best thing about this bar is that the owner's are happy about their bar and want to share it with you.,5.0
"Went in last week and I am already a fan.Nice touch with a straightforward wine menu (and explanations of what to expect are note to the right, a nice touch for both wine enthusiasts and neophytes alike.) The couple who owns the place are attentive, generous, and incredibly welcoming. Upon inquiring about the cheeses available, they offered me a generous sampling of all three. Extremely affordable, too - wines range from $5-9 by the glass. For my boyfriend whose not a wine drinker, there was a small (yet tastefully chosen) selection of beers and ciders, both local and imported. Also reasonably priced, starting around $4-5 with of course, Lindemann's Framboise at $12 a bottle. Lets be honest, Lindemann's is expensive no matter where you go.  Good looks on the music, too (hand picked from the owners laptop, Jay Z circa '96? I'll take it.)No pretentiousness yet and really beautiful warm decor. Awesome for a new local spot. Man oh man do we really need this in the neighborhood!Do try, but don't forget they're closed on Mondays!",4.0
"I went with a group of friends on a Thursday and the place was very quiet. That said, we had a wonderful time and I will be going back.  The bartender was very helpful and made some wonderful recommendations when we were very vague about what wine we wanted (we wanted a ""loose and easy going white). It's definitely a great new addition to the neighborhood.",4.0
"A great place to relax over a glass of wine and a small meal.  Try the grilled cheese- the menu isn't really my favorite ever (a wee bit too fancy for my pedestrian tastes), but the grilled cheese is deliciously unique.",4.0
"A simple, clean design augments a friendly, casual neighborhood vibe from the couple that owns and runs this little gem of a wine bar in a neighborhood that sorely needed options. It's just a block from Northeast Kingdom and two from the Jefferson L stop. The Bodega has a nice, small selection of interesting and quality wines and a well curated beer list. I can't wait to go back.",4.0
Very nice spot.  A wine bar with a great beer selection and yummy sandwiches.  Do it!,4.0
"For what it is - a friendly neighborhood place to have a drink beyond the Budwiser/Mondavi zone - it's great, and as some rewivers said it is reasonably priced for the quality one gets.I understand they have art movie projections on some nights although i cant quite imagine watching anything there while also taking in the ambient noise of the exuberant patrons.",5.0
"Cute place for sure. But a bit overpriced particularly for the area. The plates choices were alright, but don't expect this to become your neighborhood bar - it is too upscale for that.",3.0
A Bushwick reverie. A visit to Bodega is  a too brief treat.,5.0
"This is a great little place - heard about it the first day moving into the neighborhood, and wasn't disappointed.FIrst of all..  Dead Guy on tap?  I'm all over it.  The wine selection is solid and very reasonably priced.  Food menu is limited to olives, cheese, etc. during the week but on Fri/Sat/Sunday they have some pretty kickass sandwiches.  On top of that, the service was excellent - friendly and very attentive.",5.0
"the food is still 4 stars, still love the brunch here, but the ventilation problem still persists - if management can do something about blocking off the ""kitchen"" smoke/grease from permeating the whole restaurant, i would really LOVE this restaurant!",4.0
"I've been going to The Bodega since it opened and have always been a big fan.  However, their brunch has me inspired to spread the word...... actually three words, really.  Are you ready?  Here they are.......OYSTER MUSHROOM HASH.  Best brunch in the area.  I only hope I don't get muscled out of my seat at the bar when it picks up.  Also, love the little extras you get there like the toast with hot apple butter. Awesome.",5.0
I've been back since my last review several times and I think the staff is just amazing. They always go out of their way to help you and are very knowledgeable about their product. The scene varies a little but its never really crazy packed so its a nice little stop for a quick nightcap or a long intimate tipsy conversation. I hope this place sticks around for a long time!,5.0
"A nice addition to Bushwick. My friends and I recently checked this place out  I was very surprised at how cheap our tab was. The owners were extremely nice and helpful to us. Even though we didn't know our wines and high end beers, we never felt out of place.",4.0
I would like to tell all the hipsters go to hell but this is my favorite place in Hipsterland.  The beer and wine list is amazing!!  Try the tuna melt...It's grilled cheese with a nice kick of fishiness!  The Thursday bartender is friendly as hell.,4.0

"This place is absolutely top notch. Great beer and wine selection at extremely reasonable prices. Had one of the best cheeses I've ever had here tonight: ""barely buzzed Cheddar,"" rubbed with espresso and lavendar. Paired it very nicely with the Guerrilla Sixpoint coffee Porter, and my mouth threw a party.Atmosphere is chill and relaxed, old school hip-hop served from a laptop.When they first opened they were closed on Mondays - but no longer!!",5.0
"Great Staff, delicious food and fantastic prices. Celebrated my one year anniversary of living in NY, they allowed me to block off a section of the bar and also gave me free drinks. Check out their website for events.",5.0
"bodega is a very solid spot run by some incredibly nice people with a unique selection of wines and several fancy beers. already a neighborhood hangout, if you live nearby you'll probably recognize some of the usual characters from this corner of bushwick. feels a bit more grown up in that they dont have PBR and one of the beers comes in a snifter, yet they still have a $5 glass of red that is actually very good and a $4 IPA. one of the few places i've seen with Lion Stout, and it comes in a can!",4.0
"i came back here and the bartender was too cool!  because of our indecisive natures, he let us have tastings of several of their beer and wine, i was so happy!  i wish i had a bodega like this in my 'hood.",4.0
"They have a great selection of wines and beers and a glass of wine starts at 5$. My roommie and I went there to relax and chat one Friday evening and were pleasantly surprised by the cheese plate, the great live music and the fact that we could still hear each other talk. It is one of my favorite spots in the neighborhood.",5.0
