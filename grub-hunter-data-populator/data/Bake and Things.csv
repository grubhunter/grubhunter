"I love the Caribbean and I love the food equally. This is a take out type of place where most of the food is premade and you choose what you like and they pack it up for you. Judging from the menu, you find a lot of things from Trinidad. They have a bit of space against the windows to eat in, but I always prefer to take it to go and eat at the comfort of my own home. I usually get the dinners and you get to choose 2 sides. I really like the curry chicken with mix vegetables and potatoes as sides along with rice and beans. The chicken is always tender and soaked with flavor. The sides are really great and very lightly seasoned. The rice is cooked with beans and it just creates a really nice taste. I haven't had anything I don't like. Look out for daily specials. This is a great option for a quick, filling, and inexpensive meal.",5.0
"I had the curry goat roti.For me, curry goat is the metric by which to judge restaurants purveying island cuisine. It was excellent.",4.0
"Curry goat with rice and peas, two other sides. $9. They pack the thing so tight that the food would bust out any second. Best curry goat I had ever had. Cash only at the take out counter.I should say, there are other stuff like the fried shark and the salted fish, and fried conch, which I did not try because it's the wrong time of the day. For someone who loves Jamaican food, I think there are perhaps better places in Queens for the most authentic experience, but for someone who had only been to Jamaica in the 90s and loved everything she ate there, this is pretty legit.I like how moist the rice and peas are. The curry goat is very meaty and delicious and filled with nice flavor. The seasoning on that dish was fantastic. For a quick take out place, this place has a lot of varieties, the best being roti which I think is a Jamaican Indian version of burrito.There are so many things that New York amazes me about, this being one of them. I could spend a week eating nothing but that, but then, I was due to head out back to the island of Manhattan, where a foofi fancy pants dinner reservation awaits in the West Village. Well, only in this magic land of New York, can you get such diverse treats all in one day, with one 2 train that separates and unites us all.",4.0

Poooulourie! 8 wonderful little globes of dough soaked in tamarind sauce. Every' ting good mon. Every 'ting goooood.Goat Roti was perfect. Slayed me deliciously.Nap time.,4.0
Absolutely love bake and tings. It's the only place people don't fuss when waiting on lines and their prices are great. Menu is always abundant of diverse choices even later in the day. Neighborhood West Indian restaurants don't compare. Food 5 stars and service 5 as well with courteous staff at all times.,5.0
"The food is amazing here. I had the goat curry and some bread stuff with chickpeas in it. It was great. I would definitely come back to try more of the menu. They seem to have this home cooking feel and flavor to it. Caribbean at its best. The only drawback is that they only accept cash. I had to go to an ATM to get this meal. Overall, worth the trip",5.0
"Ox tail was delicious. Highly recommended. I couldn't try jerky chicken nothing left, will go back soon",5.0
"Hearty & Tasty Caribbean fare at an excellent price.I woke up from a drunken night in the city craving a curry chicken roti. So I made my way to the Flatbush junction to hit Bake and Things. This is a no frills order your food and go kinda spot. I walked in and in 5 mins I was leaving with my coveted curry roti.The roti: just plain delicious. This is Caribbean comfort food at its finest. Perfectly spiced curry chicken and potatoes wrapped in a warm roti shell. The chicken was nice and tender and spicy but not too spicy. The savory chicken with the roti bread is a perfect balance. You can sop up all the gravy up with the roti shell. The best thing about the roti is the fact that it's flavored perfectly with out needing additional salt, or any type of sauce. It's perfectly delicious on its own.At some point I'm going to venture further into the menu at bake and things, I'd like to try their doubles. And other popular items on the menu. For now they get 4 stars. A strong 4 star rating, my meal was delicious and for only $6 I got my money's worth.",4.0
"I came to Bake and Things specifically for their Vegetable Roti, which my friend recommended. It is $5.50 and you choose two veggies. I chose spinach and pumpkin. This was a deliciously warm and filling meal! I'd definitely come back for more; both the spinach and pumpkin complimented each other and the roti was so thin and I didn't feel bad for probably consuming a thousand calories! But hey, it's a veggie roti, it's still considered healthy!",4.0
Love the roti here.  I usually get goat or chiken roti and its always perfect.  Add some tamarind sauce for some extra kick and sweetness.,4.0
I love this place I always eat here I usually get the curry goat with rice and peas or the curry shrimp I love the way they cook everything to perfection. I always get the Mac pies with potato and Chana very. Sometimes the staff seem a little irritated like when I am ordering sometimes some of the staff say I can't hear you but then again I am very short and barely make it over the counter overall good food.,5.0
"Today my Bestfriend and I went into this establishment after reading some pretty good reviews online! I got the buss-up-shut skin, medium oxtail (came with literally 3 pieces of oxtails) rice and peas, and two sides (macaroni & callaloo). To drink I got a small sorrel. My Bestfriend ordered the Curry Chicken, rice & peas, and two sides (macaroni & callaloo). To drink she also got a small sorrel.My Bestfriend is Armenian, and knows absolutely nothing about Caribbean food. I am only partially familiar with Trini Dishes from other friends of mine. It's not my culture Im Afro-Latina. Nevertheless I ordered for my friend, and myself. I guess the younger looking woman in there didn't hear the order, so when it was time to pay I realized my friends' order wasn't made yet. All of a sudden the attitude, rolling eyes, and head shaking started happening. Even my friend couldn't believe it, and was so upset at the lack of etiquette from this young woman. The food was good, the oxtail was delicious though it literally came with 3 pieces of meat. I never ordered this food before, and it was my first time at this establishment. I made it very clear that we don't know too much about the food they serve there. The place was not crowded, but we still felt rush. The older lady was very kind, and understanding. The young woman was a B****. When people are supporting your business have some etiquette especially when they are being kind and respectful. If you lack home training then don't do a job where you have to interact with people. Overall both of our favorite was the macaroni, everything else was good, but neither of us was a fan of the sorrel. Due to how uncomfortable, and unappreciated our business felt with all the attitude given to us my friend, and I agreed that we will NOT be returning!",3.0

"My favorite take out restaurant. The stew chicken and Callaoo is delicious. I can go on and on about the buss up shot and curry chicken. Every thing I've had here is just awesome, and I've had several items from the menu. When not in the mood to cook this is the place to go to for take out.",5.0
"My mom came home with a chicken buss up roti and we shared it. As I was devouring a piece of my chicken, I noticed it was a little pink on the inside. Something told me to open the entire piece of chicken and the whole thing was pink on the inside. I'm PISSED!! At the fact that Bake and Things did not check to see if their food was cooked entirely. Now if I get sick from this, I will be calling the department of health on them. The only reason why it got 1 star is because the buss up was good and I love their passion fruit juice. I will not be eating from there again.",1.0

I'm pretty new to Caribbean food and have stuck with some of the basics (chicken curry, beef roti, peas and rice, etc.) but I'll definitely be back.

"Bake and Things is THE best joint for authentic Trinidadian flavors in Brooklyn. There is typically a line, a testament to the delicious food served here, but it always moves relatively quickly. As a vegetarian it is often difficult to find meatless West Indian food. At Bake and Things there are many options for me. Some of my favorites include the potato & channa roti, veggie roti and the mixed veggie dinner platter. Also, the macaroni pie and stewed spinach sides are very yummy. Admittedly, the service on some days could be friendlier, however, its clear that the staff's priority is efficency. Also bear in mind that there is not much seating room, this is more of a take out joint. Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a ""Trini to di bone"" experience.",5.0

"This place makes me think I can go vegetarian, They make  many wonderful veggie based dishes,  it separates them from other west indian places in the area.First off are the doubles here are fantastic...... when you can get them. Doubles, for the uninitiated , are small curried chickpea flatbread type sandwiches, For $1.50 you get wonderfully seasoned curried chickpeas, if you want more spice you can add pepper sauce. Tamarind sauce is available but I'm not a tamarind type guy. They are so popular they run out quickly. I've been turned away empty handed because I was too late. 10am -1 pm are your best chances, but i cant guarantee anything since I eat a lot of them !!The aloo pie ($2.00) is a good compliment to the the doubles. For new yorkers think elongated knish for the rest of you think dough pastry stuffed with seasoned potatoes.I also love the roti here. The channa (chickpea) and potatoes are very good but i almost always go for pumpkin and spinach. Beautifully seasoned and quite filling, you're satiated without being bloated.They don't do it everyday but the veggie rice and veggie lo mein are excellent. I will eat that with the either tasty red beans , spinach or excellent lentils.I'm not a vegetarian and have had fantastic curried shrimp and good stewed fish here. For the fish earlier in the day is better, Later it seems a bit dry.I've had the oxtail and thought it was good but not much better or worse than other close by establishments. A friend enjoyed the curried chicken roti but I haven't had it personally.Should be noted this primarily a take out place. There are a few seats but it's main design is to- go orders.Is it flawless ?No.The drinks are too sugar-y for me. I can deal with the sorrel but grapefruit juice is painfully sweet.

He was fast, efficient, sweet, but most important, VERY professional! But now the new circle of people she has hired, are incompetent and rude.Let's start with the new tall dark skin guy. He is a major perv. If you don't practically flash him your tits, vag, and smile you will get the worse service. On top of that, if the woman in charge sees that you are not returning his annoying perverted advances, she's rude to you too, and rips you off, and gives you a small amount of food. Its kind of sick seeing that behavior come from a woman, especially an older woman. Makes you believe that both that guy, and her (the owner lady) uses that restaurant to prey on young women. So gross. Next, sometimes she has a group of very young girls serving the food, and handling the cash register.

That's, like, my only complaint. The food is good, don't get me wrong, I just love curry potatoes and usually Trinidadian curry potatoes are just slightly overdone so they have a bite but are still soft and delish in some roti, and these were underdone and had too much bite. :(  Also, the chicken is too watery, it soaks through the roti. Too many bones also. It's good, but could be better. Also, y'all need to have doubles all day, not just in the mornings. I love the place, though. Good stuff!",3.0

"After a tasty dinner and a look at intriguing menu prospects for the future (souse...buss-up-shut) I'm glad I overcome slight skepticism related to a sign warning people not to hand over their money at the wrong place on the line.The curry chicken dinner with rice and peas and two sides was a surprisingly low $7, and the small was not small. The chicken had a good kick, although not the tear-inducing level of spice I sometimes enjoy. Items that are often just supporting players in such dishes were excellent. The rice and peas were far better than the usual and I was strangely hooked on the steamed vegetables.",5.0

"With the Bake and Things chain in the West-Indian Community in Brooklyn, it serves the large demographic, as well as Caribbean foodies.With that being said, the Bake N Shark and shrimp are probably the best on the menu. Im seeing all these great reviews for Customer Service, but it wasn't that good. Maybe I went on an off day, and Bake N Things has exceptional customer service, who knows.. I would recommend the store, and the food.. service eh...",4.0
"Tried this place for breakfast and dinner. It is a small place, so usually I would buy it for takeout. In the morning you will have to get the delicious bake and shark sandwich! It sells out quickly. For dinner, you definitely go with the curry goat or curry chicken roti. If you're extremely hungry then you should go with two roti.",5.0
"I've been going to this place for almost a year. The food is pretty good. My biggest pet peeve is the staff! They used to have this cute guy with braids working there. He was fast, efficient, sweet, but most important, VERY professional! But now the new circle of people she has hired, are incompetent and rude.Let's start with the new tall dark skin guy. He is a major perv. If you don't practically flash him your tits, vag, and smile you will get the worse service. On top of that, if the woman in charge sees that you are not returning his annoying perverted advances, she's rude to you too, and rips you off, and gives you a small amount of food. Its kind of sick seeing that behavior come from a woman, especially an older woman. Makes you believe that both that guy, and her (the owner lady) uses that restaurant to prey on young women. So gross. Next, sometimes she has a group of very young girls serving the food, and handling the cash register. When she is not looking they give customers the nastiest attitudes, and when she returns they are all pleasant like a ray of sunshine. Its a joke.Anyway, to wrap it up.

"We were in the area at Target and other stores, and craved for food, and decided to Yelp a restaurant.  We came upon several Caribbean places and chose this place.  This place is nothing fancy, the place looks pretty old but the food is quite good.  I read the reviews and called ahead of time to see if they have shrimp because many Yelpers came and there was no shrimp.  Being a pescatarian, they did have fish and shrimp.  I order the fish, which came with rice and two sides.  The fish has bones, so beware, it did not have a fishy smell, so good job in that respect.  The fish was fried and sauteed with peppers and onions.  I wanted to try the curry fish, but it was only offered Mondays.  My friend had the shrimp dinner and they give you about 6 shrimp, not large shrimps, it was sauteed in a Caribbean type spicy sauce.  You have a large selection of sides.  I had the lentils and spinach and it was good.  Also good were the potatoes and sweet potato.  There is limited seating and this is more of a takeout place.  Prices are decent.  They had a funny sign which indicated not to move your hand past this line because if you did, it may contaminate the food and would make the workers very mad.  I will go back and try the other things since I'm a big fan of Caribbean food.",4.0
"customer service: 5. everyone behind the counter was very friendly, and accommodating. When the cashier forgot to request my roti she was very sincerely apologetic and the gentlemen that compiled it was charming and funny. I've been to many West Indian takeout restaurants, and I've always found the staff to be short or rough when it comes to service.  Absolutely not the case here. For that reason alone, I would continue to patronize this establishment. quality: 5. Usually, I've found that the places with poor customer service have the best food. For some reason they believe they don't have to be pleasant because their food speaks for itself. This is the exception. Great tasting food. It's not easy finding boneless chicken roti's (I live in Long Island). So when I saw it as an option, that drove my decision to go. Needless to say, very tasty. Not watery, like others have mentioned. More kick than other curried chicken roti's I've had (not unbearable, it teeters on the edge). My bf doesn't like spicy food, but I couldn't get him to stop eating my roti! A testimony to the taste. Next time I'm in bk I will get the tamarind sauce in the wrap to dull down some of the spice for my bf and my mother. I noticed people ordering pumpkin in theirs, which is now also on my to do list. The aloo pie with tamarind was perfection. It was my alternative since they didn't have any more doubles. The coconut bake didn't taste ""coconutty"" but the salt fish was good. My Jamaican bf was moaning as he ate it as a late night snack and the other in the morning for breakfast. Price:5. $6.50 for a boneless chicken roti can't be beat. It's 8-9.50 at other places.",5.0

"So, I've been waiting for this place to open up forever and when it did, this past Wednesday I was eager to give it a go and when I did on Saturday I was automatically hooked.Trinidadian places on this part of flatbush is rare, it's mostly Jamaican and Haitian places so the quality of the curry is not the same and its hard to get standard traditional fare like Doubles, Aloo Pie etc.This place blew my mind. We got; a beef roti, doubles, coconut bake with saltfish and Solo Pear J, nothing disappointed me. The Doubles was fresh, the channa was just right and you could choose from pepper sauce, chado beni and tambrind sauce. The Coconut bake was huge and you could actually taste the coconut *gasp*; the saltfish was well seasoned with tomatoes, onions and pepper and was actually not too salty like most places *cough*.

"I've never actually had the bakes, but I've totally become addicted to the rotis here. This no frills Trini takeout place is like an oasis amongst the wasteland of fried chicken, chinese takeout and junky fast food joints along Flatbush & Nostrand. It's hard to get a decent semi-healthy meal in this area.I usually get a veggie roti, which is a buttery flaky dal puri STUFFED with aloo (potatoes), channa (chickpeas), and your choice of two other veg; spinach & okra is my fave combo. Strangely enough, ""spinach"" isn't actually spinach, but just what they call their cooked greens. The roti skins are also sold separately, and are great on their own as a snack. Just beware of ordering near closing time--if the items have been sitting on the steam table for a while they get super salty. Their doubles are also great for snacking.  If you're looking for something to eat in the flatbush/brooklyn college area, this place will hit the spot for sure.
