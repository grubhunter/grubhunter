"Brooklyn's answer to Good Kitchen Seafood Restaurant in downtown Flushing has surpassed its original owners. Yes, many of the staff people formerly running Good Kitchen in Flushing have opened this, much larger, dim sum palace. Quality has surpassed Good Kitchen in many ways, too. I have gone out of my way to try this and I'm glad I did!Food: dim sum begins at 9 a.m. and ends at around 2 p.m. on weekends. I arrived at 10 a.m. and found a line greeting me that flowed nearly out the door. From my observations, the line is largely caused by elder people taking up large tables early while drinking tea, waiting for the rest of their party to arrive. At 10:30 a.m., we were seated at a corner table. I attacked so many items and had a great time! Recommended items include the bean curd wrap and pineapple bun!Service: extremely responsive staff and great dim sum cart handlers. Decor: looks quite clean from my perspective, and the City of New York appears to agree.",5.0
"This place is a little out of the way for people who don't live in the neighborhood but looking to expand my dim sum horizons beyond the usual Flushing and Chinatown hotspots, I made my way here. You know you're at the right place when you spot a sea of cars surrounding the block East Harbor has claimed, all either vying for a spot in the most likely full indoor parking lot or circling the block for street parking nearby.Arriving around 12:30pm on a dreary Saturday, the wait for 4 was maybe 30+ mins. I wasn't keeping an eye on the clock because I was too focused on making sure my mom was paying attention to the guy calling out each party's number in Chinese* (my understanding stops at 10) and counting down parties on their way out.Once seated, we got to enjoy delicious dim sum immediately. The food was fantastic, we were never left waiting an inordinate amount of time for the next cart, and for all the food we ate, it was probably one of the better dim sum deals I can remember. $15/per person for 14 (small and medium plates)? Yes, you want it. Only downside? They don't accept credit card for dim sum.*If you don't happen to speak and/or understand a lick of Chinese, no worries. They'll notify the number-calling guy (I'm sure he has a more official name) who stands in the middle of the dining room with a mic, and he'll yell yours in English.",4.0
"Dim Sum was spot on!   Just the way a like it and a pretty complete selection. The prices were good too, you won't go broke! The lineup can get a little hectic, so go early...or late...",4.0
"Yelp u fail. I decided to check out East Harbor after reading some awesome reviews about the dim sum. I opt out of a chance to try dim sum in Flushing because a few of the reviews said that this is the dim sum hot spot of Brooklyn while Flushing is old news. However, I'm sitting here right now typing my yelp review while I wait for food to come around. I haven't wrote a review in a while, it's that bad that I just had to. I've never been to a dim sum place where I had to go fetch my own food the whole time. At one point all the carts just stayed in one area in the back and people were lining up to get dim sum dishes to take back to their tables. The quality of food was okay. I mean I think my opinion is skewed since I was pissed off the whole time. We ordered the main dim sum staples like rice noodles, shiu mai, hargow, chicken feet, spareribs, etc. Some were fresh and hot, others were cold. Nothing really impressed me. This place is real popular and busy but they can't supply the demand. Considering their mediocre food and horrible service, their Yelp rating does not reflect their actual quality. Last time I had dim sum was at Park Asia around the corner and I thought that place was decent but now after coming here, definitely way better experience there for the same quality of food and less of a wait.",2.0
"I haven't went yum cha for a while but coming back to East Habor it did not disappoint me. My family and friends love this place and their dim sums is always warm and fresh.The only problem is because their dim sum is so good, on weekends and occasions it's really busy and wait time is really long. Once you are seated everything will go smoothly and just wait for the dim sum carts to come by. They also have a large variety menu of fried noodles.My favorite is har gow (Shrimp dumpling), lo bak gou (fried radish cake), lai wong bao (sweet custard buns), cheong (shrimp noodle rolls) and zha liang (rice noodle roll around fried dough). They have all the traditional dim sums. This is by far my favorite Yum Cha spot!",4.0
"Queens is in a sad state when it comes to dim sum now. Everything fell apart in Queens. No more creative dim sum chefs in Queens. Where did they all go? Brooklyn, as I discovered the other day. We got here at 10:30 am on New Years Day. It was packed, so we thought. As we left, it was worse! What we thought was packed when we came in was nothing compared to when we left. I couldn't even get to the door. I could not put my coat on because there was no room to move. Wow, this place gets packed and for good reason! I have not really been impressed by any dim sum places for a long time. Upon visiting East Harbor Seafood Palace, my mind has been changed. The food here is fresh, hot and I even dare say creative. There were dishes here I have never seen before. I was impressed.One warning, if you don't want to wait over half an hour to get a table, come at 8;30 am! I am not joking. I joke not about dim sum!",5.0
"Bomb. Just Bomb DOT COM. My mind was definitely blown away by the quality of the dim sum for such an affordable price!! Tip #1: they call your number based on what language you speak to them initially. We spoke mandarin to them so they called our number in mandarin. For other parties, they would call out in cantonese or english. So no worries there if you speak english only! Some dim sum favorites: chicken feet (TRY IT), pork spareribs, har gow (really great. so much shrimp!), lo sa bao (salted duck egg bun; THE BEST!! HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS. HUNT THIS ONE DOWN BECAUSE IT'S WORTH. TRUST.), and zha lern (the chinese donut wrapped in rice noodle with sauce). Yumm, Get those!! & egg tart. All simply the best. Tip #2: You don't need to pay for tax if you pay with cash. Service is typical for an asian place. Don't expect them to wait on your feet every minute. But, they are quick on their feet. They will take away empty plates in the snap of a finger! And, refill your teapot right away. Just put the lid flipped on the table.  Tip #3: For smaller parties, this is more like a heads up. They can and will smush you together with other small parties in one big table. It can and will get awkward. We were assigned with 2 other parties and had to sit kind of away from the main path so my poor mom had to keep standing and walking up to the carts to get food. Usually, dim sum food is like $$. It adds up, especially for big parties. But, surprise surprise! It really wasn't as much as the dim sum back in Northern California. Please, if you live in Brooklyn, this place is A MUST TRY. If I was a brooklyn native, I'd probably be a regular at this place.",5.0
"Best. Dim. Sum. Restaurant. Ever. I've been coming here with my family for as long as we've been living in Dyker Heights, which is about 12 years. I finally decided it was time for a review.  It helps that my mom has connections here and we get great service. ;) It's a big restaurant but come here either really early or later since it gets super packed on the weekends. We always get the tripe, siu mai, stuffed eggplant/peppers, chicken feet, spare ribs, rice noodles, etc. (the typical dim sum dishes.) The noodle dishes/specials on the menu are pretty good as well. I would recommend the pan fried noodle with seafood. Can't go wrong with that. Everything is super fresh and piping hot.There's a parking lot right next to the restaurant if you can't find street parking. If you're a dim sum noob, just come in and try everything. No joke.",5.0
"My boyfriend and I came here for a friend's wedding banquet dinner. It looks a little smaller than Spring Garden and not as fancy. The tables were nicely decorated and everything was neat and organized. There wasn't a real bar, only a table with different alcohol, wine, and sodas and a bartender. I asked for a cranberry vodka and there was definitely more vodka than alcohol, not mixed well enough. My boyfriend asked for a pina colada,  but the bartender didn't have a cocktail shaker so they used two regular cups to mix the pina colada. Kind of weird if you ask me.The food was your standard wedding banquet dinner, nothing over the top. The food was mediocre. Service was alright, the staff would serve you food when they are available.I don't really come to East Harbor Seafood Palace that much, but the fact that the bartender didn't seem too professional and the food quality was ehh, I rather go to Spring Garden - it's 10x better.",3.0
First meal of the 2016 was here!Most Asians love dim on New Year day and I think they were all with me as I waited for half and hour for just seats for two. I had four dim sum places to go to within a three block circle.We decided on East Harbor because it was a mentioned on many Food Network and YouTube TV foodies. The dim sum at East Harbor is definite great and better than Manhattan or Queens. Their dim sum are fresh and many unique dishes. Service was fine. The waiting time and crazy crowds on New Year Day was expected.Tip: Table shared is a must at any dim sum restaurant. Parking is a challenge; try around the park on 66 and 67 St.,5.0
"Indication of a good dim sum restaurant: it's packed, even on a Wednesday afternoon!  It's not just the older crowd munching away on the delicious food, there was a lot of younger people and kids.  You would think that everyone should be in school or working!Had dim sum with a large group of people.  We were given a table with a lazy Susan!  (It was my first experience with a lazy Susan during dim sum).  The ladies pushing the carts were very nice, not pushy.  I loved that they quickly converged on us because we were all starving.  As you can see from my picture, we ordered multiples of everything!You can never go wrong with the main dim sum staples: sui mei, har gau, beef ball, fish ball, chicken feet, cheung fun with shrimp/beef/roast pork/fried cruller.  Their tofu dessert was delicious with ginger syrup!!!  Fried noodles was good.  The chef was very attentive in not adding shrimp or bean sprouts as some of us are allergic.  Salty fish with chicken fried rice was good, flavorful.  The waiters cleared the empty dim sum steamers quickly.  They were quick to refill our teapots.  And they switched out our plates midway through.

"They really deserve 5 for the dim sum, and 3 for their dinner. Dinner here just isn't good and I really can't see why since dim sum is so great. Came here once for a wedding banquet, and multiple times for dinner and never once was I impressed. Now, 3 stars instead of 4 because the wait time for dim sum seriously pisses me off.The wait for a table on the weekends for dim sum is absurd. The wait for a big table is even worse. My parents arrived at East Harbor today at 11:30PM and took a ticket # for a table of 10 (life here is much easier if you have a small party, so feel free to still wait with a party of 2-3). An hour and 10 minutes later and we were still not seated. Let me be a bit of a brat and say even with my dad's ""connections"" with people in the restaurant industry, that we were still unable to get a table. How is it that even with HELP from people at this restaurant that we still couldn't get a table? Why? Because there aren't enough big tables to spare! God bless those families with 10+ people just like us that relied solely on a ticket #. It's honestly ridiculous to even wait that long for dim sum even if East Harbor does have great dim sum fare. Papa bear walked to Park Asia a few blocks away which was equally as crowded and got us a table in less than 10 minutes after talking to his buddies there. Food at Park Asia isn't as good, but OK/GOOD food is better than NO FOOD at East Harbor. Papa was also pissed off that the people here ""不知做"" (Mm sik jo) so I guess were not gonna frequent this place as much as we use to anymore.IN CONCLUSIONNNNN: If you have a big group and everyone in the group has no life, then you would have no problem waiting for forever. If you have a life, please get the f out of here and just go elsewhere unless y'all wanna split up into different tables.",3.0

If u come before 2pm, be prepared to wait at least 1.5 to 2 hrs. The dim sum selections are numerous. The kitchen constantly make more due to demand from customers. The quality is superb. Customer service is excellent. Waiters constantly remove empty dim sum dishes from the table and they even change your plates as well. Each pair of chopsticks are wrapped to ensure cleanliness.

Tips are recommended to the valet after you pick up the car. If you are seated near the outer tables, you best be prepared to get up and track down a cart yourself and grab what you want.

"Surprisingly, on SuperBowl Sunday, my family of 8 people, were able to get a table for dim sum with out any waiting.  We arrived around 10:15ish.  I thought we would have had to wait at least 30 mins to an hr for a table.  They open at 8:30am.  While eating, the amount of people waiting grew rapidly.  They were hovering very close to our table since our table was close to the entrance.The food was good.  We ordered the typical dim sum items, har gow, shumai, beef cherng, shrimp cherng, egg rolls, etc.....I just realized we forgot to get the chicken feet.   The only issue I had with this place was the cold air coming into the restaurant.   I wished they would have installed the outer door partition thingy(what do you call those things??)  I found it annoying when the people were hovering behind us, but my mom made a good point how they were blocking the wind from blowing in towards our table.   At the end of our meal, we brought our own dessert, we asked for clean plates and fork, the waiters were very attentive and brought them immediately, and cleared the used plates off the table.",4.0
"There's a reason why this is the most popular Cantonese restaurant in the 8th Ave Chinatown. The decor is very spacious and magnificently decorated. The waiters are all very cordial and adept at what they do. And most importantly, the food is delicious. I've been coming here to yumcha ever since the place opened up for business and I always end up leaving feeling very satiated. All of the dimsum dishes are mouthwatering and not excessively salty. Tonight, I had the pleasure of coming here for dinner with relatives from Hong Kong and they were very impressed by the dishes that we ordered. The main attraction was the crab over sticky rice and while I'm not a big fan of crab, I found the one here to be pretty alright. The sticky rice tasted amazing after absorbing all of the flavors of the crab via the steaming process. We also got the steak cubes with vegetables which was great and the fried milk with walnuts which was one of the best I've had. The tofu with seafood dish was alright, albeit a little on the bland side, as were the vegetables.Overall, East Harbor should definitely be your top priority destination in terms of Cantonese restaurants in the immediate area. Unfortunately, it is very popular so sometimes it's necessary to make reservations weeks ahead, especially in terms of big parties. Great atmosphere, superb service, and tasty food!",4.0
"This is actually the best dim sum place i've been to in all of nyc. Low standards for nyc, but still the best in nyc. The wait on a weekend morning is long, and you'll have to sit with a bunch of strangers unless you have 6+ people, but its still good.",3.0
"My all time favorite dim sum restaurant. I have tried other dim sum parlors, but I don't think any restaurant can top this one. My grandparents come to this restaurant for dim sum every single day and whenever we have big dinners, we will come back here. Their dim sum and regular dishes are super duper fresh and delicious. I will not get tired of this place. I have friends that would travel from queens early in the morning just to come here for dim sum. It gets very crowded on the weekend, especially around 11am-12pm. I would get there at 10am on the Sunday and there will be a crowd of people waiting inside and outside the restaurant to be seated. Make sure to get a number ticket from the hostess when you first enter. The wait can vary from 20 minutes to an hour depending on how big your party is. But believe me, it's worth it. I crave for it if I have not had it for one week.Oh, if you cannot find parking around the area, they have a parking lot right next to the restaurant. The line to go into the parking lot is usually a long wait on the weekend also since the parking lot isn't that big.

Also, this could be a fluke, but the service is considerably better and people don't seem to rush the carts as much. Gets very crowded on weekends, so expect a wait. Pretty much, top notch for satisfying my dim sum cravings!",5.0
"It's always been a tradition in my family to have dim sum on Saturdays. We've been to numerous  restaurants but we just keep coming back to East Harbor. Usually Saturdays are less packed and the wait is not as long. However, with East Harbor they are constantly packed unless u come after 2pm. If u come before 2pm, be prepared to wait at least 1.5 to 2 hrs. The dim sum selections are numerous. The kitchen constantly make more due to demand from customers. The quality is superb. Customer service is excellent. Waiters constantly remove empty dim sum dishes from the table and they even change your plates as well. Each pair of chopsticks are wrapped to ensure cleanliness. Even the bathroom was clean. I definitely do not have any complaint with this restaurant.  The wait is totally worth it.",5.0
Standard dim sum - their shu mai is pretty good and I like their cha siu baos better than other dim sum places. They sometimes have a special lobster chow mein during the week and it's pretty cheap and delicious. Come here on a weekday! Guaranteed to have a better time and not to go deaf.,4.0
"This is by far the best dim sum place in brooklyn by 8th ave chinatown. It is always packed. They do seating by the number called. Which is given out by the hostess. The wait time is usually about 20-30 mins. At time the tables are shared with other people. They have their own parking lot which the valet takes care of and he then gives you a car ticket. Tips are recommended to the valet after you pick up the car. If you are seated near the outer tables, you best be prepared to get up and track down a cart yourself and grab what you want. The dim sum carts tend to not circle around the outer tables. It can be a disappointment.",4.0
"Surprisingly, on SuperBowl Sunday, my family of 8 people, were able to get a table for dim sum with out any waiting.  We arrived around 10:15ish.  I thought we would have had to wait at least 30 mins to an hr for a table.  They open at 8:30am.  While eating, the amount of people waiting grew rapidly.  They were hovering very close to our table since our table was close to the entrance.The food was good.  We ordered the typical dim sum items, har gow, shumai, beef cherng, shrimp cherng, egg rolls, etc.....I just realized we forgot to get the chicken feet.   The only issue I had with this place was the cold air coming into the restaurant.   I wished they would have installed the outer door partition thingy(what do you call those things??)  I found it annoying when the people were hovering behind us, but my mom made a good point how they were blocking the wind from blowing in towards our table.   At the end of our meal, we brought our own dessert, we asked for clean plates and fork, the waiters were very attentive and brought them immediately, and cleared the used plates off the table.",4.0
"There's a reason why this is the most popular Cantonese restaurant in the 8th Ave Chinatown. The decor is very spacious and magnificently decorated. The waiters are all very cordial and adept at what they do. And most importantly, the food is delicious. I've been coming here to yumcha ever since the place opened up for business and I always end up leaving feeling very satiated. All of the dimsum dishes are mouthwatering and not excessively salty. Tonight, I had the pleasure of coming here for dinner with relatives from Hong Kong and they were very impressed by the dishes that we ordered. The main attraction was the crab over sticky rice and while I'm not a big fan of crab, I found the one here to be pretty alright. The sticky rice tasted amazing after absorbing all of the flavors of the crab via the steaming process. We also got the steak cubes with vegetables which was great and the fried milk with walnuts which was one of the best I've had. The tofu with seafood dish was alright, albeit a little on the bland side, as were the vegetables.Overall, East Harbor should definitely be your top priority destination in terms of Cantonese restaurants in the immediate area. Unfortunately, it is very popular so sometimes it's necessary to make reservations weeks ahead, especially in terms of big parties. Great atmosphere, superb service, and tasty food!",4.0
"This is actually the best dim sum place i've been to in all of nyc. Low standards for nyc, but still the best in nyc. The wait on a weekend morning is long, and you'll have to sit with a bunch of strangers unless you have 6+ people, but its still good.",3.0
"My all time favorite dim sum restaurant. I have tried other dim sum parlors, but I don't think any restaurant can top this one. My grandparents come to this restaurant for dim sum every single day and whenever we have big dinners, we will come back here. Their dim sum and regular dishes are super duper fresh and delicious. I will not get tired of this place. I have friends that would travel from queens early in the morning just to come here for dim sum. It gets very crowded on the weekend, especially around 11am-12pm. I would get there at 10am on the Sunday and there will be a crowd of people waiting inside and outside the restaurant to be seated. Make sure to get a number ticket from the hostess when you first enter. The wait can vary from 20 minutes to an hour depending on how big your party is. But believe me, it's worth it. I crave for it if I have not had it for one week.Oh, if you cannot find parking around the area, they have a parking lot right next to the restaurant. The line to go into the parking lot is usually a long wait on the weekend also since the parking lot isn't that big. You'll get a ticket from the valet guy when he takes your car and tips are always recommended when you go pick up your car.",5.0

The front doors do get packed with people waiting for a table if you show up late.  First come, first serve is no joke here. They carry all the classic dim sum dishes, all of which are very good. Delicious and steaming hot when it's served from their heated carts and onto your table.  Just be sure to come here with a hearty appetite and time to sit and chat with friends and family.",4.0
"Since my last review, I've had 4 more dim sum meals here & it remains the best dim sum I've had which includes many trips to 2 on Ave U & the 3 nearby competitors: Park Asia, Phoenix & J King.All my last review remains plus I spotlight the consistent quality which time has not diminished. The tastes are authentic & flavorful in a way that I miss from so many other places. So many places have such dull dishes that I wonder where they got their ingredients. I thus find that values & scale matters. The freshness is obvious, aided by the very high turnover. Even a huge line out the door is only 20minutes' wait usually. The variety is not only already very large on the carts but the usual full menu along with dishes to compliment dim sum such as large form desserts & nicely designed rice plates are also available for order. Still, a great place.",5.0
"Coming here was a mistake. My boyfriend and I came to New York for the weekend and wanted to get some dim sum before catching a movie. We found this place on yelp a decided to give it a try. When we arrived, we were seated at the very back of the huge dining hall. Right next to a dozen plus fish tanks holding eel, fish, crab, shrimp, etc... There were dozens of fish crammed in tanks. It was definitely an unappetizing sight.The waiter attempted to be helpful but we were pretty confused about what to order and he told us they didn't have dim sum? But then suggested we get the dim sum sample platter...it was confusing. With his help, we finally decided on three dishes. None of them were good. Maybe it would have been a better experience if we were not sat next to a bunch of miserable looking sea creatures and if we had a Chinese friend with us who knew what to order - but I won't be coming back to test that theory.",2.0
"I've been around the Chinese banquet hall/ dim sum scene. Usually you can expect a rushed service, waiters who are never around when you need them, and generally less than amiable service. Sure, the halls are typically grandiose with their chandeliers, golden dragons flushed against the wall, and rows of seafood for your picking, but if it's good service you're looking, Chinese banquet halls shouldn't be your first try. But I gotta say, East Harbor was really something else. I've never encountered such friendly Chinese waiters who really want to make sure you have a great experience. My first time here was for a wedding banquet. This time around was for the couple's baby shower, and I can see why they've made this a staple for their family milestones. Even their manager was up all in the business of clearing my table, grabbing to-go boxes, and checking in to fill up my water. Overall the food was pretty good too. There's a great atmosphere here and would definitely come back.",4.0

"Go on a weekend morning since that's dim sum prime time. Have the desk person jot down your name and wait with the rest of the crowd. Wait, wait, wait and finally, the MC calls your number. You wave your arms wildly and rush forward like you've just won the Price is Right's Contestant's Row. Because essentially you have. A seat where you'll be able to choose from an array of dim sum.This place is good. Solid good. Everyone that comes this way tends to love East Harbor. Like most dim sum places, part of it is lost on me, as I don't eat pork or seafood. Unfortunately, that kind of limits my options. But from the limited options I do have, there are things I absolutely love. The beef balls are a must. I was hesitant the first time but glad I went for it. It's my go-to dish every time I come. My other go-to dish? The noodles with either beef or veggies. My husband orders the shrimp version and usually goes through 2 or 3 plates of those on his own.Definitely drop by and don't be intimidated. Just point to random things and you'll have a happy and full belly.",4.0
"East Harbor is my #1 spot in Brooklyn for dim sum. I come here quite often and it could be that I'm so used to it. I've had dim sum in chinatown in Manhattan, different parts of China, Toronto in Canada, San Fran in California and none of them could compare. I would say I only enjoy having dim sum in Brooklyn. The variety of food and people here builds a nice atmosphere of a busy restaurant and that's to my benefit because the food comes out often. There's so many people dining here until 3 in the afternoon sometimes. There's a indoor parking lot but it's small so it doesn't hold a lot of cars. Looking for parking is tough on the weekends! Everyone's out to dim sum in the area. Besides ordering the usual dimsum dishes, I must mention the special dishes I like to order every time Pork intestines with preserved vegetables Salt and pepper squid Fresh Mini egg custardsSnow skin durian (bing pi liu lian) I come here for a family dinner if we want Chinese food, but I feel like the dinner dishes has more similarities with other Chinese restaurants in the neighborhood.",5.0
"East Harbor is my favorite and go to place whenever I'm in Brooklyn. The only thing bad about this place is 1) the wait if you come at prime dim sum time and 2) parking. To avoid the wait for a table, I would suggest arriving by 9:30-10 am. I am not a morning person by any means, but it's definitely worth getting up early for as oppose to the never-ending wait. Secondly, the restaurant does offer limited valet parking. Street parking can be tricky as it's on a busy intersection, but if you don't mind a walk, there's side streets. Again, just be careful with the signs as there are plenty of traffic cops nearby.I like East Harbor because they have always been consistent the past couple of years. Their service is average- mostly Cantonese speaking with limited English and Mandarin available. The staff is pretty attentive but not intrusive. The decor is average, looking like any other typical Chinese restaurant.What keeps me going back all the time is the food! It is always pipping hot and fresh! I've been going to dim sum all my life and worked in restaurants so I know when things are overcooked/reheated. It has never been an issue here. The ladies wheeling the cart will try their best to steer you right, if they tell you to wait a little bit, it usually means they know that 1) the dish is not fresh but 2) fresher ones are on the way! Don't fight with them, but don't let them push you over with dishes you don't want either!There isn't a dish I don't like here but then again, I consider myself an equal opportunity eater. Favorite dishes include: shrimp dumplings, pork rib-lets over steamed rice noodles, chicken feet, sesame rolls and fried mantou (buns).Definitely a place to try out if you want good dim sum!",5.0
"I've been coming here for 3 years and I have to say the mark of good dim sum place is how well they make the har gow and siu mai.Do you want piping hot, consistent dim sum?East Harbor Seafood is an excellent restaurant to get your dim sum fix.The har gow and siu mai have been consistently stuffed with shrimp, fresh and springy. Chicken feet- well marinated, soft and gelatinous. The beef balls taste as if they were tenderized for hours.The Worcestershire sauce wets your appetite as you bite into the Beef balls; balls garnished with a sliver of watercress.The spring rolls sit as logs on small plates. Crispy, crunchy, Unami, pork and mushroom fusion hits your tongue and you just want more. I understand how my cousins will devour endless amounts of spring rolls. Sometimes it feels as if we are at an all you can eat buffet and there is only one food option. Parking is horrendous- many people don't move their cars in the morning and driving around the block, you'll find multiple people double parking.Come early (as in 9-10am) to avoid an hour wait!",4.0
"Best dim sum in NYC hands down! They're always packed with crowds surrounding the place. If you come on the weekends be prepared to share a table with others since it gets extremely busy and chaotic. The restaurant also provides customers with valet parking but street parking is your best bet due to the small-sized lot. As for the service, all the workers are quite friendly and attentive compared to many other dim sum places that I've been to. Now on to the food.

These dishes are an acquired taste so beware!  Definitely try the egg tarts(don tot), phoenix buns (lau sah bao), and black sesame roll (gee mar guen). They taste incredible especially when it's freshly made and it's the perfect way to end the meal! Also, dinner is great here too but more towards the pricier side.",5.0

"Alright, where are these gosh darn dim sum carts everyone's been talking about. My boyfriend and I came here the other night around 9 PM and we did not see a single one. I'm not sure if we were seated in the wrong area or came on the wrong day or what, but we missed out. I even asked our waiter about it but he kind of just mumbled something in broken English that I didn't quite understand. Thankfully the things we did get to order were plenty delicious.We loved that they had complimentary green tea, but unfortunately for us we drank way too much and were unable to fall asleep once we got home. Damn you caffeine. We started with the dim sum combo. It came with shrimp dumplings, shu mai, and spring rolls. Each item was so good that it got me even more upset about the fact that we couldn't experience the actual dim sum. Then we got half a duck and crispy chicken with white rice to share. Both were delicious. My boyfriend used to live in China and he thought the chicken tasted super authentic. They give pretty hefty portions though and we wound up taking a lot home.My only critique would be service and pricing. Everything on the menu was upwards of 15$, go to Chinatown and you could find the same thing for about half the price. And I really wish the servers were a bit more attentive. We wound up having five different people helping us over the course of our meal, and it was incredibly difficult to get their attention. It took us about 20 minutes after eating to get someone to give us our check. Yelp says this place is casual, but I wouldn't exactly describe it that way. The servers are in vests and button downs, chandeliers hang from the ceilings, warm towels are handed out. I was wearing jeans and a t-shirt and felt very out of place.I know I probably won't be coming here again since it was a bit out of my way, but damn, the food was good, so check it out. But I'd suggest going in a group.*EDIT* Ah hah! After some more investigating I've discovered my boyfriend and I came about six hours too late for the dim sum carts since they stop service at 3:30. Dang it.",4.0
"Had a wedding banquet here last night -- such a good time/service. I love the owner, Sammy...he really makes sure things run efficiently. Worth every penny.Guests were set to arrive at 7pm, but my husband and I had to get there early to set up our desserts and gifts. So we got there before 5pm, and I love that there is a small parking lot attached to the restaurant. It's very small, and not every space is available because they do have some parts dedicated to extra chairs, supplies, etc. So if it's a full lot it can be super tight and challenging to maneuver. But if you go at in-between hours, it's smooth sailing. As soon as we got in, the owner/manager got things rolling , the waiters put on the chair covers, helped us with the mini table for our cupcake towers. At times it seemed like they were hovering, but I think it was because it was a quiet period for them or they were assigned to assist us. We had a private room with four tables, and it was spaced apart perfectly. Enough room in the center, for guests to arrive, talk to one another, take pictures -- which we all did for about an hour. The 13 course meal was good -- took about 1.5-2 hours total for them to serve everything, spaced apart. They served our main table, and maybe others, which was kind of annoying. It meant they were around a lot more and it would interrupt conversational flow. But I think it was because we started dinner later than most other parties and they were worried we may linger for hours past closing time. can't blame them -- they get busy here and I'm sure they want to go home after a long night. The last four dishes were the heavy carb ones and they brought it all out at once. Then it was onto desserts. think they were hinting or nudging us along, haha. Overall it was good timing. At that point, it was cupcakes for everyone, mingling with more of our guests, and people started saying their goodbyes. By the time we were done, packed up, and about to head out, it was a little past 11pm. Such a great experience that went smoothly, all the guests loved the food, ate a lot, and had a good time. If I were to ever have another party here, I would definitely try to come here.",4.0
"Came with a group of 8 for dinner. The table we sat at was unfortunately right by the door, so it was FREEZING because the wind kept blowing in. There were other tables they could have chosen of us, but we had to get the short end of the stick. Sitting in the corner also meant being ignored by waiters really often since they don't seem to notice us or hear us trying to get their attention. We did get their attention, but it took quite a while.We ordered the mayo shrimp with candy walnuts and broccoli, fried salt and pepper squid, fried fish and tofu casserole, marinated beef short ribs, and some Chinese vegetables. The ribs were tough to chew. The first platter did not have enough for all of us, so we ordered a 2nd, which came with more pieces than the first. That was a major disappointment because clearly that meant we were getting ripped off the first time. Both servings should have had the same amount. The first piece I ate was also underdone, slightly on the rare end. The 2nd platter was cooked better, but definitely tougher to chew. The vegetables and casserole dish was just alright, nothing really special, typical Chinese flavors. I am a huge fan of mayo shrimp, and I would say it was decent here. The shrimp could have been just a tad bit more crispy, but considering the amount of mayo sauce coated on it, it's kind of a given that it wouldn't remain super crunchy. I would still give that dish alone 5 stars though. As for the fried squid, the squid was slightly rubbery, and overly salted. I prefer the fried calamari dishes from other restaurants.",3.0
"Most definitely come here for the dimsum! A large variety of dim sum dishes and carts.

"Your standard dim sum fare in NY.   3.5 rating, but not quite in the 4-star territory.  If you want 4 stars & up, say it with me: HONG KONG.The best item here would be the herbal chicken feet.  It is not for the faint of heart as it does have a strong Chinese herbal taste.  After soaking for hours in herbal soup, it retains great flavor.  Also, it does look like chicken feet; it's pale and not marinated nor as visually pleasing as its 'fung jao' counterpart.  The soup is supposedly really good for you, but it is super oily.Another item that they do well: the cilantro rice noodle rolls- these you might have to order separately.  It resembles the form of the shrimp/beef/cha siu noodle rolls, but I have always had to ask a waiter to steam a fresh plate for me.The last item is the durian dessert dumpling.  They pack a lot of this cheesy-textured fruit and wrap it in a thin skin.  It's chilled and especially tasty.  Once again, not for the unadventurous.  It has such a foul smell that Andrew Zimmern listed it as one of his 5 most hated foods. If you can get past all your reservations about 'exotic' Asian flavors, then this would be your best choice for dim sum in Brooklyn.  Fear not, they do offer the more familiar items that most would be used to seeing.",3.0
"I'm torn between wanting to spread the word so one of my favorite places in NY flourishes and not wanting too long a wait/large a crowd especially for weekend dimsum. We love the fresh seafood, the crispy and tasty peking duck, the lobster, pork chops, fresh scallops on half shell with garlic and rice noodles, the shrimp dishes, clams in blackbean sauce, greens, pretty much everything we've tried has been tasty and done very well. Service is great, especially if you come during the week when it's free from the dimsum crowds. But they're always helpful and polite.  Hard to find parking but well worth a visit.",5.0
Best dim sum place in NYC I ever had. Cart ladies are much nicer than ladies in Manhattan dim sum places and they don't rush us. And there are many kind of dim sum! But you have to wait for about 30min to have a table.,4.0
Many different options and shapes but theDimsum all taste more or less the same. None of the finesse and various flavor profiles of really good dimsum. Guess I got very spoiled by Hakkasan which has mind blowing delicious and seriously overpriced dimsum.,3.0

"Alright, where are these gosh darn dim sum carts everyone's been talking about. My boyfriend and I came here the other night around 9 PM and we did not see a single one. I'm not sure if we were seated in the wrong area or came on the wrong day or what, but we missed out. I even asked our waiter about it but he kind of just mumbled something in broken English that I didn't quite understand. Thankfully the things we did get to order were plenty delicious.We loved that they had complimentary green tea, but unfortunately for us we drank way too much and were unable to fall asleep once we got home. Damn you caffeine. We started with the dim sum combo. It came with shrimp dumplings, shu mai, and spring rolls. Each item was so good that it got me even more upset about the fact that we couldn't experience the actual dim sum. Then we got half a duck and crispy chicken with white rice to share. Both were delicious. My boyfriend used to live in China and he thought the chicken tasted super authentic. They give pretty hefty portions though and we wound up taking a lot home.My only critique would be service and pricing. Everything on the menu was upwards of 15$, go to Chinatown and you could find the same thing for about half the price. And I really wish the servers were a bit more attentive. We wound up having five different people helping us over the course of our meal, and it was incredibly difficult to get their attention. It took us about 20 minutes after eating to get someone to give us our check. Yelp says this place is casual, but I wouldn't exactly describe it that way. The servers are in vests and button downs, chandeliers hang from the ceilings, warm towels are handed out. I was wearing jeans and a t-shirt and felt very out of place.I know I probably won't be coming here again since it was a bit out of my way, but damn, the food was good, so check it out. But I'd suggest going in a group.*EDIT* Ah hah! After some more investigating I've discovered my boyfriend and I came about six hours too late for the dim sum carts since they stop service at 3:30. Dang it.",4.0
"Had a wedding banquet here last night -- such a good time/service. I love the owner, Sammy...he really makes sure things run efficiently. Worth every penny.Guests were set to arrive at 7pm, but my husband and I had to get there early to set up our desserts and gifts. So we got there before 5pm, and I love that there is a small parking lot attached to the restaurant. It's very small, and not every space is available because they do have some parts dedicated to extra chairs, supplies, etc. So if it's a full lot it can be super tight and challenging to maneuver. But if you go at in-between hours, it's smooth sailing. As soon as we got in, the owner/manager got things rolling , the waiters put on the chair covers, helped us with the mini table for our cupcake towers. At times it seemed like they were hovering, but I think it was because it was a quiet period for them or they were assigned to assist us. We had a private room with four tables, and it was spaced apart perfectly. Enough room in the center, for guests to arrive, talk to one another, take pictures -- which we all did for about an hour. The 13 course meal was good -- took about 1.5-2 hours total for them to serve everything, spaced apart. They served our main table, and maybe others, which was kind of annoying. It meant they were around a lot more and it would interrupt conversational flow. But I think it was because we started dinner later than most other parties and they were worried we may linger for hours past closing time. can't blame them -- they get busy here and I'm sure they want to go home after a long night. The last four dishes were the heavy carb ones and they brought it all out at once. Then it was onto desserts. think they were hinting or nudging us along, haha. Overall it was good timing. At that point, it was cupcakes for everyone, mingling with more of our guests, and people started saying their goodbyes. By the time we were done, packed up, and about to head out, it was a little past 11pm. Such a great experience that went smoothly, all the guests loved the food, ate a lot, and had a good time. If I were to ever have another party here, I would definitely try to come here.",4.0
"Came with a group of 8 for dinner. The table we sat at was unfortunately right by the door, so it was FREEZING because the wind kept blowing in. There were other tables they could have chosen of us, but we had to get the short end of the stick. Sitting in the corner also meant being ignored by waiters really often since they don't seem to notice us or hear us trying to get their attention. We did get their attention, but it took quite a while.We ordered the mayo shrimp with candy walnuts and broccoli, fried salt and pepper squid, fried fish and tofu casserole, marinated beef short ribs, and some Chinese vegetables. The ribs were tough to chew. The first platter did not have enough for all of us, so we ordered a 2nd, which came with more pieces than the first. That was a major disappointment because clearly that meant we were getting ripped off the first time. Both servings should have had the same amount. The first piece I ate was also underdone, slightly on the rare end. The 2nd platter was cooked better, but definitely tougher to chew. The vegetables and casserole dish was just alright, nothing really special, typical Chinese flavors. I am a huge fan of mayo shrimp, and I would say it was decent here. The shrimp could have been just a tad bit more crispy, but considering the amount of mayo sauce coated on it, it's kind of a given that it wouldn't remain super crunchy. I would still give that dish alone 5 stars though. As for the fried squid, the squid was slightly rubbery, and overly salted. I prefer the fried calamari dishes from other restaurants.",3.0
"Most definitely come here for the dimsum! A large variety of dim sum dishes and carts. More so than other places in this part of Brooklyn.The shrimp haw gow  and the steamed rice and chicken in lotus leaf are phenomenal. Come early as tables can fill up and if you are in a small group be prepared to share a table. As a weekend dimsum craving stop, its a must.

"I've been coming here every weekend with my parents for years. This place makes every other dim sum place look and taste like crap. The food here is fresh and hot, and not to mention it tastes really really good. Get the durian puff pastry the moment they come out from the kitchen! I'm always waiting and watching with my card in hand for the chef to bring it out. I hate durian but this is an exception. Its buttery crisp pastry shell makes the smell and taste of the durian bearable. One more thing.. Don't leave without getting a bowl of the sweet tofu dessert! It's warm and soft and the sweet ginseng syrup is just so bomb.My only complaint is that the carts don't get around to every row, so don't be afraid to get up and get it yourself.",4.0

The only dishes that I didn't really like was the shrimp dumplings (ha gao), kind of bland and could use more work. This place gets very packed though. I came in at 1pm on a weekend and it was a full house, I ended up sharing a table with this other group of people. Even though it was a full house, the wait wasnt too bad. I waited prob like 15mins.

"I really enjoy the dim sum food here as well as the dinner options. One of the reasons why I love eating dim sum in Brooklyn is because the restaurants tend to serve much larger portions compared to the ones in Queens. I'm not saying that all Chinese restaurants serve smaller portions in Queens, but it's just something I happened to noticed after dining at quite a few Chinese dimsum restaurants in both Brooklyn and Queens.In addition to the big portions, this restaurant totally doesn't skimp out on the meat! For instance, their Shu Mai and Shrimp dumplings are absolutely overflowed with meat and filling! As the restaurant is fairly large, some of the more popular dishes tend to go fast, so sometimes it's a disadvantage to be seated further from the kitchen. The bacon wrapped shrimp is one of the dishes that tend to go first! Another dish that's really popular with locals is the Cilantro wrapped rice noodles. Although the price + quality of food here is great, it does tend to get very busy during the weekends. If you show up around noon, the wait for a table is around 45 minutes to an hour. You are given a ticket with a number and wait for the manager to call your number.A BIG no-no is that some of the locals who know the waiters or waitresses will cut the line. Since the number calling usually doesn't go in any particular order (it depends on your party size), it's hard to get an idea of when you will be called next. I've noticed quite a few times the locals will slip the waiters a few dollars and get seated before those who have been waiting longer. I really want to give this place 4 stars for the great selection of delicious dim sum foods, but the extremely long wait and whole line cutting thing really puts me off.",3.0

"As someone who grew up in Brooklyn & 8th Ave and frequents Chinatown (can't speak for Flushing), I can say that no where really matches up to East Harbor for dim sum.  The lines are long and for good reason - the dim sum never disappoints! Fresh, colorful, and flavorful, it's very true to what one would expect from good dim sum.  And not to mention, they basically have it all.  From your dumplings, siu mai, pastries, buns (steamed or baked), rice rolls, everything - and I haven't really had anything bad yet. They have a few notable dim sum dishes that you wouldn't find anywhere else too and some seasonal dishes like their shrimp and spinach dumpling, pumpkin sweet soup or black glutinous rice dumpling.  Aside from just their dim sum, their to-order fried rice and stir-fry noodles are top notch with lots of meat and veggies with a lot of ""wok hei"".  I always look forward to coming back - not too much about waiting, but well worth the wait!",5.0
"This place could be very crowded in the weekend so come early. There is a small garage parking nearby. It is a little difficult to follow the table number being called, because most numbers were called in Chinese. When you put down the number of people in your party, speak English so that they know to call your number in English. However, it is extremely difficult to follow due to the chaos and noise inside the restaurant. Fire code is 225 people but there over 300 people. Service is quick, I guess they want you in and out.

Since the number calling usually doesn't go in any particular order (it depends on your party size), it's hard to get an idea of when you will be called next. I've noticed quite a few times the locals will slip the waiters a few dollars and get seated before those who have been waiting longer. I really want to give this place 4 stars for the great selection of delicious dim sum foods, but the extremely long wait and whole line cutting thing really puts me off.",3.0
Great place. My go to place for Dim Sum in the NYC area. Beef tripe - best I have had anywhere. All dishes fantastic. Wait staff & cart delivery people extremely helpful for a non Chinese speaking customer - best customer service I have experienced in any Dim Sum restaurant I have visited. Arrived at 9:23 am on Sunday 12/29/15 - we were the first group waiting - 4 minute wait. By 9:40 there was a long line - get there early.,5.0
"As someone who grew up in Brooklyn & 8th Ave and frequents Chinatown (can't speak for Flushing), I can say that no where really matches up to East Harbor for dim sum.  The lines are long and for good reason - the dim sum never disappoints! Fresh, colorful, and flavorful, it's very true to what one would expect from good dim sum.  And not to mention, they basically have it all.  From your dumplings, siu mai, pastries, buns (steamed or baked), rice rolls, everything - and I haven't really had anything bad yet. They have a few notable dim sum dishes that you wouldn't find anywhere else too and some seasonal dishes like their shrimp and spinach dumpling, pumpkin sweet soup or black glutinous rice dumpling.  Aside from just their dim sum, their to-order fried rice and stir-fry noodles are top notch with lots of meat and veggies with a lot of ""wok hei"".  I always look forward to coming back - not too much about waiting, but well worth the wait!",5.0
"This place could be very crowded in the weekend so come early. There is a small garage parking nearby. It is a little difficult to follow the table number being called, because most numbers were called in Chinese. When you put down the number of people in your party, speak English so that they know to call your number in English. However, it is extremely difficult to follow due to the chaos and noise inside the restaurant. Fire code is 225 people but there over 300 people. Service is quick, I guess they want you in and out. Price is very reasonable.",4.0
"Make your reservation early if you want a taste of what is some of the best dim sum in Brooklyn. Excellent preparation, fresh ingredients and perfect timing make even the most basic shrimp dumplings exciting. Located in the Chinatown Brooklyn , the atmosphere is fairly vibrant thanks to a large restaurent.",5.0
"I could eat dim sums everyday and not get tired of it! Might be one of the best dim sum places in eight avenue...and there's free valet parking...woop woop!

"A half Asian  friend and I showed up at this spot on a Tuesday for lunch. Counting us, there were only 1.5 white dudes in this spot. It didn't go unnoticed, because the waiter brought us forks in addition to the chop sticks. Luckily too, since I can get by but some of those dishes I had no idea how it was possible with chop sticks alone. We were sat at a table with some other patrons and just started randomly picking things off of the carts which never seemed to stop passing by. The place is huge and it was almost fully packed for lunch. This place was delicious. I can't name one thing I had, but it was all extremely good. It seemed like we ate a ton of food and the bill was only 33 dollars! Maybe that's expensive for the area, but I found it very affordable.",5.0
"I'm sure for many of the non-Chinese customers that eat here, many of them read their reviews here.  I have eaten here for many times, mostly for dim sim and only once for dinner.  Dinner wasn't very good as the prices were a little high and the food was very salty.  I still remember how one of my family members complained about the dinner......  He even went as far as saying he won't eat dinner there ever again!  I would give them a second try though.  And, ain't dinner expensive for all Chinese dimsum restaurants?Onto the dim sum.  Quite fresh.  They do steam a lot of dishes every hour and so I haven't eaten anything left overnight.  But, for the fried dimsum, it's sometimes hard to eat it warm and hot as it was cooked some time before.  That is one of my dislikes.The beef tenderloin (I hope I get that name right) used to be very tender and soft.  Now, it's quite hard..  And the price has increased a bit so that's disappointing.  Other than that, the other foods have been very good.  Quality and service is outstanding.  Haven't eaten anything raw in the past.  Good place for dim sum.",4.0

We called the man the master pecking duck carver, since he did it so well, duck was carved in thick pieces and layed out for us neatly on the plate. We saved the duck carcuss and asked them to make it into a soup with tofu and watercrest, which turned out rich and flavorful.They have a duck eggs and frog legs stir fry, I have never tried it before, nor have I ever heard of it. The frog legs are fried then stir fried in a crispy scallion, duck egg yolk crumbles, and dried garlic concotion, which genius came up which this?! It was unbelievable! All you frog leg lovers out there, you gotta come try it!I'm not a lamb lover so didn't try the chef's special lamb chops, though it did look yummy. The other regular dishes we normally order, like the scallion ginger lobster, garlic fried whole chicken, fried tofu with conch were all excellent. The fillet flounder stir fry was outstanding and never lets me down. Fish is fresh and cooked perfectly every single time!At the end of your meal, at any Chinese restaurant, you get your fruit platters/plate of oranges, sweet dessert soup, you get one or both depending on the place.

This is my go-to Brooklyn spot for dim sum. I wouldn't mind driving 25min just to get a taste of this place. The selections are typical of most dim sum places but they still try to be creative with some newer options.

We also tried a lot of items that we don't normally find in the dim sum restaurant near us, like the sweet corn soup, durian pastry (so good!), durian mousse in crepe wrap (idk what's the name), and much more!

This place is always packed on weekend mornings. People swarm the place for dimsum. The food is pretty decent.

Worth the wait!!! They have A lot of more options then other dim sum places I have tried in Manhattan & Queens. Also the tofu pudding (tofu fa) was fantastic!

It was not a crowded morning when I came here.Saturday at 9am and we were seated right away. Ofcourse as morning progressed it became more crowded. We were a group of 4 with a child. Food was tasty and service carts were steady.I didn't really know what to get so luckily someone else took the lead on that.I really liked the chicken feet...lol. I haven't had that in YEARRSSSSS. We ordered two plates and I think I ate 80% of what was served. Lots of tasty items but I can't recall them all.Will return and I do recommend.,4.0
"My husband and I came here at 10 for dim sum, and indeed there was a crowd waiting.We waited 25 min before we were called. They call your number in Chinese and English so no worries. Just make sure you go get a number from the hostess and pay attention. We shared a table with a small family who were very nice. Make sure you order what you want (drinks) from the beginning since it is difficult to order more later. For dim sum, you get a ticket placed on your table so the cart ladies can stamp what you order. My husband and I would wait for the cart ladies to come around but it was difficult and a long wait, until the father of the family told us that we can just grab our ticket and go to the cart ladies and get what we want and just bring it back to our seats, which we did!!We ordered 1 plate of turnip cake (3pc), 2 plates of pork siu mai (4pc per plate), 1 plate of shrimp crepe roll (3 pc), 2 plate of steam shrimp & cilantro dumpling (3pc), 1 deep fried shrimp roll (3pc), and 2 plates of imperial shrimp dumping (4 pcs).When you are finish, you would call the server to calculate your ticket, then you will go to the cashier to pay.With hot tea it was $29.The food was great but not I was used to. Everything tasted different. Not bad but different. However, I am sensitive to taste. My husband loved it but I also grew up eating dim sum and he only ate it on occasion. For example, the pork siu mai, I was used to ground or chops of shrimp with the ground pork as well as minced mushroom. However, in theirs they had half of mushroom slices and 3 full baby shrimps in each. Again, it was still good but different. Also for their crepe, one of it only had one shrimp so majority was just the crepe. I was fine with it, but it probably shouldn't be like that.I would recommend this place and would return but I am also looking for that perfect dim sum place!",4.0
"It is the best dimsum place in the area.  There was 8 of us in the party. We pretty much tried everything on the menu. I totally recommend you to try the ""Egg Custard Bao"".  And the price tag was completely affordable.  Each of us only paid $15 to share. All of us were so full and we had to carry our tummies just to walk out from the front door.  The service was great there as well.  The waiter kept coming back and replaced clean plates for us.  I would recommend everyone to go there.",5.0
"This place is the best. Their food is amazing. I went there with a group of 12 people and 12 people left happy I left the happiest, I picked up the tab and it was $130 TOTAL. The only thing is the language barrier. Living in NY you go to places over the course of your life that english is barely spoken. This is one of those places. Our waiter was fluent in English but the girls bringing the food only knew how to say ""very nice"" or ""very good"". I would still recommend this place because the food was beyond very good or very nice.",5.0
"Came here on Lunar New Year's Day.  Overall, a good option for dim sum.  They have the dim sum staples, and some I haven't seen before.  Most of the dim sum I had were good; there were only a few misses.  Mainly, I'm a fan because this restaurant seems cleaner than most Chinese restaurants I've been to.  That, and their staff is nicer too.  Will definitely be back again, especially to try their dinner items.",4.0
"My boyfriend and I went there around 1pm on a Sunday for dimsum. We didn't know it was street parking until we got there, luckily we found a spot right around the corner. I wish they have a parking lot, would be much more convenient for everyone - especially on busy days.We were craving dimsum so we looked for anywhere close by. Lucky for us, East Harbor was only 15 mins away and had great reviews. It was crowded, of course, but we got seated within 10 mins. I was starving, so everything looked and smelled so good. As soon as we were seated, we ordered like everything from the closest cart. It was great! I was in dimsum heaven. Although it was late, all the foods were still very fresh, which was great. Also, I was afraid that options would be limited since we went so late, but it was enough to be satisfied. I got everything I wanted. The cart ladies were really courteous and nice, served us with a smile. I had a great experience there, would definitely go back.",4.0
"This is some seriously good Dim Sum.It was a freeeeeezing Sunday morning when we decided it would be an awesome idea to trek from LI to BK to get dim sum. I'm always down for a car ride with good music to get good food, so off we went. We entered the doorway and it was swamped. Carts trying to pass by you, people not moving to allow said cars to get by; it was a mad house. We were given a number and told the wait would be approximately 20 minutes. Not bad for how busy it was. We were seated pretty quickly. I had never been to a place where you would be seated at a table already occupied, but honestly, I didn't even notice it. Service was very efficient and the women pushing the carts had no problem explaining each dish to us.We had crystal shrimp dumplings (my favorite) and they were some of the best I ever had. The wrapper was a little thicker than I'm used to and I think it helped! Usually the shrimp fall right out but these held their own. We also had the shrimp wrapped in rice noodles, chive and shrimp dumplings, fried shrimp balls, sticky rice in banana leaves, and so much more. Everything was delicious and we ate to our stomachs content.It came to less than $40 which was a good deal considering how much we got for our money. The restaurant was clean, the food was hot and came out fast, and the wait wasn't excessive on a Sunday. Couldn't hope for more than that!",4.0
"I absolutely LOVE this place!  And apparently many people share the same sentiment.  They have a combinations of authentic Chinese dishes and at the same time, there is a small number of dishes that are a creative style of the chef.  My favorite was the Dungeon Crabs steamed in lotus leaf with sticky rice.  The sticky rice absorbed a lot of the crab flavor while cooking and it tastes great with each bite.  Their jelly fish is also done really well. This is a great family restaurant and I will definitely be going again!",5.0
"It gets very busy here and for good reason. Try and get here during an off time for dinner. Came at 6 pm last week and there was no one in there yet. By 7 pm it was getting pretty crowded.Get the crab over sticky rice , garlic chicken, scallops on the shell...very tasty. Even good when brought home and heated up the next day.Keep in mind , Chinese restaurants are not known for the best hospitality service ever. It's eat and go. It's though to wave them down sometimes . They were very attentive this time though and kept changing out our dirty plates even before they were really dirty .",4.0
"This is probably the only decent dim sum place in the whole Brooklyn area. I only go here for dim sum and probably been here only once for dinner. Not much to say about their dinner. Their dim sum is very fresh and good. If u come on the wkends, expect long waits.. We usually order for pick up and just drive by to get it. Sometimes they forget a dish or two and we call to let them know so they'll keep our name on their list for next time. Or u should jus triple check before driving off w ur order. If u pay credit they will charge tax so if u dont wanna pay extra just pay cash.",4.0
It was not a crowded morning when I came here.Saturday at 9am and we were seated right away. Ofcourse as morning progressed it became more crowded. We were a group of 4 with a child. Food was tasty and service carts were steady.I didn't really know what to get so luckily someone else took the lead on that.I really liked the chicken feet...lol. I haven't had that in YEARRSSSSS. We ordered two plates and I think I ate 80% of what was served. Lots of tasty items but I can't recall them all.Will return and I do recommend.,4.0
"My husband and I came here at 10 for dim sum, and indeed there was a crowd waiting.We waited 25 min before we were called. They call your number in Chinese and English so no worries. Just make sure you go get a number from the hostess and pay attention. We shared a table with a small family who were very nice. Make sure you order what you want (drinks) from the beginning since it is difficult to order more later. For dim sum, you get a ticket placed on your table so the cart ladies can stamp what you order. My husband and I would wait for the cart ladies to come around but it was difficult and a long wait, until the father of the family told us that we can just grab our ticket and go to the cart ladies and get what we want and just bring it back to our seats, which we did!!We ordered 1 plate of turnip cake (3pc), 2 plates of pork siu mai (4pc per plate), 1 plate of shrimp crepe roll (3 pc), 2 plate of steam shrimp & cilantro dumpling (3pc), 1 deep fried shrimp roll (3pc), and 2 plates of imperial shrimp dumping (4 pcs).When you are finish, you would call the server to calculate your ticket, then you will go to the cashier to pay.With hot tea it was $29.The food was great but not I was used to. Everything tasted different. Not bad but different. However, I am sensitive to taste. My husband loved it but I also grew up eating dim sum and he only ate it on occasion. For example, the pork siu mai, I was used to ground or chops of shrimp with the ground pork as well as minced mushroom. However, in theirs they had half of mushroom slices and 3 full baby shrimps in each. Again, it was still good but different. Also for their crepe, one of it only had one shrimp so majority was just the crepe. I was fine with it, but it probably shouldn't be like that.I would recommend this place and would return but I am also looking for that perfect dim sum place!",4.0
"It is the best dimsum place in the area.  There was 8 of us in the party. We pretty much tried everything on the menu. I totally recommend you to try the ""Egg Custard Bao"".  And the price tag was completely affordable.  Each of us only paid $15 to share. All of us were so full and we had to carry our tummies just to walk out from the front door.  The service was great there as well.  The waiter kept coming back and replaced clean plates for us.  I would recommend everyone to go there.",5.0
"This place is the best. Their food is amazing. I went there with a group of 12 people and 12 people left happy I left the happiest, I picked up the tab and it was $130 TOTAL. The only thing is the language barrier. Living in NY you go to places over the course of your life that english is barely spoken. This is one of those places. Our waiter was fluent in English but the girls bringing the food only knew how to say ""very nice"" or ""very good"". I would still recommend this place because the food was beyond very good or very nice.",5.0
"Came here on Lunar New Year's Day.  Overall, a good option for dim sum.  They have the dim sum staples, and some I haven't seen before.  Most of the dim sum I had were good; there were only a few misses.  Mainly, I'm a fan because this restaurant seems cleaner than most Chinese restaurants I've been to.  That, and their staff is nicer too.  Will definitely be back again, especially to try their dinner items.",4.0
"My boyfriend and I went there around 1pm on a Sunday for dimsum. We didn't know it was street parking until we got there, luckily we found a spot right around the corner. I wish they have a parking lot, would be much more convenient for everyone - especially on busy days.We were craving dimsum so we looked for anywhere close by. Lucky for us, East Harbor was only 15 mins away and had great reviews. It was crowded, of course, but we got seated within 10 mins. I was starving, so everything looked and smelled so good. As soon as we were seated, we ordered like everything from the closest cart. It was great! I was in dimsum heaven. Although it was late, all the foods were still very fresh, which was great. Also, I was afraid that options would be limited since we went so late, but it was enough to be satisfied. I got everything I wanted. The cart ladies were really courteous and nice, served us with a smile. I had a great experience there, would definitely go back.",4.0
"This is some seriously good Dim Sum.It was a freeeeeezing Sunday morning when we decided it would be an awesome idea to trek from LI to BK to get dim sum. I'm always down for a car ride with good music to get good food, so off we went. We entered the doorway and it was swamped. Carts trying to pass by you, people not moving to allow said cars to get by; it was a mad house. We were given a number and told the wait would be approximately 20 minutes. Not bad for how busy it was. We were seated pretty quickly. I had never been to a place where you would be seated at a table already occupied, but honestly, I didn't even notice it. Service was very efficient and the women pushing the carts had no problem explaining each dish to us.We had crystal shrimp dumplings (my favorite) and they were some of the best I ever had. The wrapper was a little thicker than I'm used to and I think it helped! Usually the shrimp fall right out but these held their own. We also had the shrimp wrapped in rice noodles, chive and shrimp dumplings, fried shrimp balls, sticky rice in banana leaves, and so much more. Everything was delicious and we ate to our stomachs content.It came to less than $40 which was a good deal considering how much we got for our money. The restaurant was clean, the food was hot and came out fast, and the wait wasn't excessive on a Sunday. Couldn't hope for more than that!",4.0
"I absolutely LOVE this place!  And apparently many people share the same sentiment.  They have a combinations of authentic Chinese dishes and at the same time, there is a small number of dishes that are a creative style of the chef.  My favorite was the Dungeon Crabs steamed in lotus leaf with sticky rice.  The sticky rice absorbed a lot of the crab flavor while cooking and it tastes great with each bite.  Their jelly fish is also done really well. This is a great family restaurant and I will definitely be going again!",5.0

It's crazy in there. But it's a good sign. The louder the place the better the food. If it's crowded you most luckily will have to share a stable if you are a small party.,5.0

"I've definitely had my fair share of dimsum at every single location in Brooklyn... Literally. Even few spots in flushing & Chinatown and I gotta' hand it to East Harbor, BEST DIMSUM EVER IN NY. This place is always packed even on weekdays! Service is usually really good here as well. The managers, hosts, and waitresses etc are really nice, which is rare for asian restaurants apparently... But hey, service is actually important to them!Their dimsum food always comes out piping hot and fresh. ABSOLUTE BEST IN THE GAME OVER HERE WITH THEIR :*Ha Cherng (steamed shrimp rice noodle roll) *Dahn tots (egg custard) - sometimes you have to race to it and fight people for it.. Jk bout the fighting part, but really... people gets first grabs so quick the minute it comes out the kitchen. The crust is so flaky and the middle is just oozing with sweet hot perfectly made egg custard.*Faw Jing Jong - ""fire steamed"" in translation. I've always hated the whole asian sticky rice with fillings wrapped in bamboo leaves... But this was an exception, I fell in love with this but only from here! Pour a generous amount of sugar that they provide and drizzle a little of the sweet soysauce that comes with it over your yummy flavorful sticky rice with tender fatty pork pieces and mushrooms, and you're set. I pick out the salted yolk because.. I still don't like salted yolk. I really look forward to coming here making sure I never leave until I get this dish*Salt&pepper squid - if you like calamari, then get this... YOU HAVE TO. This is the asian style calamari, and one of East Harbor's very popular specialty dish from dimsum. Sooo garlicky, a little tingly kick from the green peppers, so crispy and good.*Dai Pong Chow Mei (dry scallop, baby shrimp and dry squid w/ rice noodle) - this is on the menu that you'd have to order. If you still have some room to fill in your tummy then go for this! The noodles are so soft and fluffy and the pickled veggies adds a sweet and sour touch through your bites into this noodle dish.

Best table to get are the ones near the kitchen in the back because the carts come out and the dim sum is fresh out of the kitchen. My personal favorites are the roast pork buns, shrimp rice noodles, and the fish balls. You can certainly order off the menu and have something personally made.

"I've been dying to try East Harbor Seafood Palace for years! The first time I tried to eat here was almost 4 years ago. It was on a Sunday and there were 45 people ahead of me for dim sum. I really didn't believe the hype of this place and decided to go somewhere else.I attempted to return here again 4 years later for dinner. It was a much more relaxed experience. We were a party of two here to grab an early dinner before heading to Barclay's Center for a basketball game. The restaurant was near empty on a Sunday afternoon. All of the dim sum crowds went home and all that's left were the workers.The food - we were monsters. I ordered the Peking duck, fried chicken and dried shrimp and scallop fried rice. The Peking duck was served tableside and the waiter chopped up the crispy duck into pieces. It was served two ways - the crispy skin was eaten with the steamed buns and the remaining meat was chopped up in another plate. The fried chicken was very crispy and served with fried prawn crackers. The fried rice was a little lacking in scallops. We tried to find the tiny bits of them but alas, we couldn't find them. We did however find tiny tiny bits of dried shrimp. I mean SUPER tiny.The service was excellent. I'm talking real good and prompt attention at our table. There were only a few customers in the restaurant at the time. Our plates were replaced multiple times during our meal and throughout each course. If this kind of thing appeals to you, come here. I'm only here for the food and if the service is just as good, that's extra points. Highly recommended!",4.0

"Amazing. Fantastic! We came here for dinner, and we were blown away. It was absolutely packed, but we only had to wait for 5 minutes for a table for 2. We ordered the dungenous crab- light sauce on it and a huge portion- but very expensive. Was worth it, because we are every bite. We also got the salt and pepper fried squid with chilis. The taste reminded me of Hong Kong. The dry garlic and pepper was the perfect touch to the light fry on the squid. The Fried Rice was gigantic! And it was perfectly seasoned with out any grease at all. Portions are huge and we had a lot of fried rice left over. The staff was so wonderful and catered to us. We will return asap!!",5.0

We had:- salt & pepper squid (first rate)- fish cakes with corn (not our favorite)- sweet, fatty fried pork buns with rice-starch wrapper (never had these before, but really liked them)- noodle roll ups with vegetables and shrimp (so fresh! the vegetables were great)- crystal shrimp and spinach dumplings (delicious)- egg tarts - steamed roast pork buns (some of the best I've ever had; sticky, porky, tasty)We came at around 11 on a warm, sunny October Sunday and were seated in around 1/2 hour.

I can eat a dozen of them and not feel stuffed. Exceptional skills for such delicate traditional Chinese treats. Unusually big space for a dim sum restaurant.

I promise, it'll be worth the wait.-----------------------------------------------------* youtu.be/fvKhDiNME4E?t=4…",4.0
"Amazing. Fantastic! We came here for dinner, and we were blown away. It was absolutely packed, but we only had to wait for 5 minutes for a table for 2. We ordered the dungenous crab- light sauce on it and a huge portion- but very expensive. Was worth it, because we are every bite. We also got the salt and pepper fried squid with chilis. The taste reminded me of Hong Kong. The dry garlic and pepper was the perfect touch to the light fry on the squid. The Fried Rice was gigantic! And it was perfectly seasoned with out any grease at all. Portions are huge and we had a lot of fried rice left over. The staff was so wonderful and catered to us. We will return asap!!",5.0
"We just came here for the first time today, so we're obviously not the most expert commenters here, but we had a wonderful time and found the food first rate. There was a very wide variety of dishes available and everything was strikingly fresh and high quality. It was also a very pleasant place to eat - not just an attractive room, but a convivial atmosphere and professional, friendly staff. We had:- salt & pepper squid (first rate)- fish cakes with corn (not our favorite)- sweet, fatty fried pork buns with rice-starch wrapper (never had these before, but really liked them)- noodle roll ups with vegetables and shrimp (so fresh! the vegetables were great)- crystal shrimp and spinach dumplings (delicious)- egg tarts - steamed roast pork buns (some of the best I've ever had; sticky, porky, tasty)We came at around 11 on a warm, sunny October Sunday and were seated in around 1/2 hour. Extremely affordable, and dead easy to get to from central Brooklyn - easier than Manhattan Chinatown from Park Slope.",5.0
"Amazing dim sum place. Hands down one of the best dim sum seafood place, I have been to. I am Chinese, believe me, I have been to many. Had some very authentic, classic dim sums there in the morning recently, Those was recommended by their head waiter.  Their egg tarts are mini but deadly. I can eat a dozen of them and not feel stuffed. Exceptional skills for such delicate traditional Chinese treats. Unusually big space for a dim sum restaurant. Suited for wedding, that's why almost every weekend there are wedding happening, I recommend this place highly for your all your Chinese events, anniversary, wedding, engagement, or any sort of celebrations.",5.0

"We came for the Dim Sum and were disappointed that they only serve dim sum till 3pm. But our disappointment went away very quick when our first order arrived out on the table. The fried oysters, They were like nothing we have ever seen before. They were the largest oysters we've ever eaten. Despite being fried they still tasted fresh.We also ordered the fried calamari, that too was really large in size compared to what we have normally seen. The calamari hands down was our favorite. The seasoning was perfection.The fried rice was also really good and not greasy how some restaurants cook it.My husband LOVED the General Tao chicken. I did have a few bits and it was really yummy.Over all everything we ordered was delish but the calamari is what I'll remember. We look forward to bringing other foodies here with us.

"A far trek for me from the ues, but totally worth it! Took my parents here to experience the ""Brooklyn Chinatown"" since they've already done the city & Flushing. They really enjoyed East Harbor! Both my parents are Cantonese, from Hong Kong and China so their approval sealed the deal for me. They offer your usual dim sum fare, but also stuff I haven't gotten anywhere else. Some favorites were the seafood corn patties, the sauteed veggies (somehow it was prepared sooo good. not too salty, but great flavor. juicy.), the black sesame filled dumpling/pastry, and they had this spare rib rice pot that sizzled & smelled delicious but we had already ordered too much food. The shrimp cheung fun (shrimp in white wide noodle-like wrap) had humongous fresh shrimp, which was a rare sight. Also, you know how with certain cuisines you have that one signature dish you love and is your go-to measure of quality? Well for me at dim sum it's chicken feet. Yep. I LOVE chicken feet, so when a place has good chicken feet, i'm convinced it's a ""good dim sum place"". This place was stellar- it was fresh and had a tasty marinade, cooked to tender perfection, but not too soggy. It's loud inside, more than average which means lots of chinese ppl. The tv screens everywhere show hong kong news. And I can't imagine being a non-Chinese speaking person here. I didn't see a single non-asian person, much less hear any english being spoken.

"Delicious dim sum with great service and free valet parking. This place is very crowded so expect to wait for at least 30 mins. When putting your name down on the list ask them to call your number in English. Try to go early they serve dim sum from 9am-3pm. This is about the only dim sum place where service is good, you can ask for chrysanthemum tea, water, hot oil, extra sauce without any attitude. They even brought out clean plates after a couple of rounds. Don't count on free valet parking as it's always crowded.",5.0
"Came here with a bunch of Cantonese speakers and let me just say - you Canto-speaking people are my favorite (at least when we're doing dim sum!). Here's a rule: Get here bright and early. Half of us arrived at the ungodly hour of 9am on a Saturday (the rest of the group practiced traditional Chinese fashionable lateness). There was no wait at 9am, and still some empty tables in the gigantic dining room. By 11am, the front waiting area was swarmed with people. As we rustled to leave, a patron had already shamelessly wound his way to our table, and hovered by it with hands clasped, solemnly laying claim.The cart ladies are good about visiting your table. We ordered a TON. My usual steamed items were all hot, fresh, and as good as their Flushing counterparts (but not better; let's not push it...). There were only two exceptions: the ha cheung (rice noodle-wrapped shrimp) was not as soft as I always get in Flushing. From the opposite end, the niu zha (braised tripe) is extremely tender here, much better than the chewy stuff at East Manor (yelp.com/biz/east-manor-…), for example. Also tried some new things I usually don't get at yum cha:1. Black sesame gelee roll - not too sweet, cool and lovely with a bit of richness from the sesame. They looked like fingers though. Terrifying witch fingers. 2. Egg custard tart - I eat these all the time. It's hard for them to suck. With that in mind, they were excellent here - very flaky crust, warm and light. The custard just melts in your mouth. I dislike when people use that phrase to describe food as if it's an unequivocally great thing, but in this case, it was. 3. Durian pastry - my description of the smell/taste of this thing baffled some members of our table. Yes, a ""farty mango."" It was also excellent. Again, the pastry was beautifully fresh and flaky, almost falling apart. The inside was umami'ed but tropical, again not too sweet. Apparently this item is what everyone comes to East Harbor and waits HOURS for during dim sum. Lucky us for snagging some!For 7 people, our total came out to $77 before tip. WHAT? WE GOT SO MUCH FOOD. That more than makes up for the gas I didn't pay for. I also appreciated that unlike Flushing eateries, they kept refilling our chrysanthemum tea with new flowers, rather than just adding water. We went through 8-10 pots.My general feeling about dim sum is that when it doesn't suck, it's mostly the same; and your go-to just depends on whether you live closer to Flushing, Sunset Park, or Chinatown. But especially for items that are slightly outside the most basic dim sum rotation, East Harbor is actually worth the trip.",4.0
"Loved the food (though Flushing is still King when it comes to Dim Sum) but the whole no parking, long wait experience seriously put a damper on this otherwise 4 star review.Parking situation was the perfect storm for a nightmare scenario: Sunday + a kid's soccer game at the nearby park + their laughable adjacent lot. Managed to find a spot near 7th ave and 72nd St which was probably a good idea in retrospect because you do consume a lot of food at this place. A note for the owners: Buy that closed up diner next door and turn it into a pay parking area.

"The quality of dim sum is superior compared to others in the area and they have some innovative dishes. Their siu Mai here is huge and stuffed with real meat and shrimps, definitely a must order. The price here is a bit more expensive but totally worth it due to what you get. Finding parking around this area is such a pain though.",4.0
"Great service, great food. Most of the waiters speak chinese, but they speak enough english to make some good recommendations on the menu. Seafood is great here,  came back multiple times for crab and sea clams. The meals are better with big parties so that evrybdy can share. They also make food to order, so if u want something different from the menu, just ask. Limited beer n wine.",5.0
"After checking out from a hotel in battery park area in nyc, we stopped by this restaurant for a dim sum brunch. It is only 15 minutes away from nyc. This is how the real dim sum place should be. The energy and vibe are fast and furious.  They have a small parking next to the restaurant but it is on a up-to-your-own-luck basis. The parking is quite a challenge. You have to let them know to call out the party number in english. The table is communal, I guess it is trendy again. The craziness and the crowd makes it excited to have dim sum. It is a part of the fun. The dim sum is served hot with variety. You can also order lobster and dungeness crab with garlic sauce or noodles to share as well. The service is fast and courteous, chinese style. Sammy is the best. His service is 5 stars. Ask for him in black suits. He is my guardian angel. He helps ordering the dim sum I want to the cart servers in chinese. That speeds up the dining a great deal. He is so exprienced and efficient.  Thank you Sammy. Other waiters are quick and helpful too. Our plates are changed several times over the course of the meal. I hope to be back again for the sit down seafood dinner.",4.0
"Authentic Dim Sum Restaurant. I never knew this part of Brooklyn existed, it's like a mini Chinatown. Place is huge, staff isn't bilingual which made it kind of hard when picking food. Place is also really full which gave me the confidence that if the locals eat here then it must be good. Bathrooms however are not clean. I am very picky when it comes to bathrooms and this just wasn't good. Other than that everything was fresh and great!",4.0
"IMO, East Harbor serves the best dim sum in Brooklyn and Manhattan. The quality of their dim sum is consistently top-notch - although I would stay away from the congee - it tastes like water. However, it is East Harbor's new creations that make it stand out from other dim sum restaurants. I've been going about twice or three times a month for the past few months, and I've seen them roll out new items, such as black sesame balls with peanut butter, and dumplings made from sticky rice flour, stuffed with pork, nuts, and veggies. If you decide to come on a weekend, I suggest coming before 10am; otherwise, it gets insanely packed and depending on the size of your party, you can easily wait 45 min to an hour. Sacrifice a few minutes of sleep so you can sit a little more comfortably without having to share a table with another party or be squeezed into a spot where you're basically sitting on top of two other people.Unfortunately, I don't recommend coming for dinner or hosting a banquet here, despite the space. The dishes are lackluster and pale in comparison to the dim sum. The quality is inconsistent and more often than not, poor or mediocre.",4.0

"Though Flushing is the place to be when it comes to Dim Sum in NYC (#1), it's places like East Harbor that slowly narrow the gap.  It's not hard to realize that with it's banquet hall setting, good service, decent prices, and most importantly fresh food, East Harbor easily takes the cake for the best Dim Sum in Brooklyn Chinatown.Though better than Manhattan's Chinatown (Astoria is probably better), Dim Sum in Brooklyn is a bit of stalemate.  From Pacificana (yelp.com/biz/pacificana-…) to King Star (yelp.com/biz/king-star-r…), with only subtle differences in ambiance, they all still manage to produce roughly the same quality of food.  Even if the buildings are unique, the dishes are not.  The fact East Harbor manages to separate itself from the rest of the pack is impressive.During the weekends this place is a bit of a zoo, but the wait has never been that long.  There is a small parking lot in the back as well, but it gets filled up rather quickly.  Ironically, I've had experienced longer waits when it was just me and two others than when I was with a group of 8.  Like any classic Dim Sum joint, it can get noisy here.  The banquet hall makes for a lot of group tables and it seems to be a spot where wedding receptions would fare well.  Fans of the cart pushing will find it here and take it as a good sign when it's mainly Chinese locals dining here.Most of everything I've had here has been fantastic, including:  fried taro dumplings, bbq pork buns, pineapple tarts, shrimp dumplings, and the bbq pork puff pastries.  One time I had an issue with the steamed custard bun (lai wong bao, lau sa bao), where it was dry and unappetizing, but it was quickly resolved when management brought out a fresh set for yours truly.And while most places like this specialize in one thing, I'm pleased to report East Harbor has an outstanding dinner service as well.  Their Cantonese specialties were surprisingly delicious, namely the blackbean lobster and yee fu noodles (cheung sau mein).  The steamed flounder in soy sauce was delicious and I can vouch for an excellent yinyang fried rice.For the most part, service has been A+ friendly.  The prices are good and the facilities are clean for large scale Chinese places.  I have been fortunate here, though I know many others who have come here with mixed results.  If it's all about the Dim Sum, then East Harbor is the place to be.  But only in Brooklyn.___________(#1) I totally freestyle'd that first line.",4.0

The crunchy taro item and the triangle sweet pork are my go-to items.I'm not a fan of the cooked items.

"Dim Sum - burst of flavor in small bites done in a crowded restaurant early in the morning usually accompanied by the enjoyment of tea.If I could recall from my history lessons watching the travel network these were along the lines of some of the earliest restaurants where people congregated to enjoy food together at a business location.Chinese people casually say ""Lets go drink tea"" as their phrase for a Journey into their favorite Dim Sum Parlors and Sea Food restaurants.  The critics for good dim sum is harsh as many U.S. consumers are first generation immigrants and they've been accustomed to eating at the dim sum parlors of China and Hong Kong and everything is compared to how things were in their home country.East Harbor does a good job serving up tasty bites of Dim Sum and satisfying thousands of the toughest critics in new york.  People wait for hours and make journeys from Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens to this location to ""drink tea"" on the weekends.The food here is fantastic, comparable to many restaurants in HK.  Dim sum isn't an expensive meal a little money goes a long way.  Still though it would be great to come here with someone in the know because not anyone can just come into a Chinese seafood restaurant watch the ladies move the food carts around screaming in cantonese and know what or how to order, but that's probably exactly how the local population wants to keep it - private, exclusive and delicious.",4.0

"Came here for a friend's wedding banquet. Really amazing food; some of the best Chinese food I've ever had. Excellent, fresh seafood.

"Great place for dim sum and in my opinion the best in the 8th avenue area!The best here is the steamed turnip cakes and the Malaysian rolls. The turnip cakes are super smooth and the Malaysian rolls here are done right. The standard dim sum items like churng fun, siew mai, har gow, etc. aren't bad either. Their dinner fare is also pretty good. We went for a huge Chinese New Years dinner and everything was really good. My personal favorite is the fried condensed milk.

"I have been here about 4-5 times this year.

The crunchy taro item and the triangle sweet pork are my go-to items.I'm not a fan of the cooked items.

"Alright, let's be honest here. I've been to this restaurant so many times now, as in more than one hundred (100), it just seemed proper that I write a review for it. My family is Chinese, and we have a tradition of going out for dim-sum every Sunday. I suppose it's a very Hong Kong-ish thing to do. This is your standard, big banquet style Chinese restaurant. There are a bunch of tables and some private dining rooms right near the entrance. No real ambiance here - if you come here on a Sunday, it's just going to be packed and noisy, so don't expect anything less. I wouldn't say it's a rowdy type, it's just noisy because it's mostly Chinese people, and you know how we like to get loud when we eat, haha. Decor is starting to get old, but this place has been around a while already.Now, onto the food - the dim sum is good, not great, but it's good. For example, the Shrimp Dumplings dish (Har Kow, 蝦餃), you can see a piece of jumbo shrimp wrapped in clear dumpling skin, is standard fare - nothing special. I actually quite like the Siu Mai (燒賣), you can identify them by the yellow wrapping with pork filling on the inside. Next, I think the Churng Fun 腸粉 dishes are quite good (anything with rice wrapping, you'll find shrimp wraps, beef wraps, and even BBQ pork wraps) and they're doused in a sweet soy sauce. Other dishes... eh, I usually stay away, they're not that great. Now, as is customary with NY Chinese restaurants, the menu is huge, as in 100+ dishes huge. There's no way I can give a proper review on all of it, but I can give a small insight into several dishes that my family always orders. We usually get from the non dim-sum menu an order or two of noodle dishes. For example, the Stir Fried Beef Rice Noodles 乾炒牛河 is alright - depends on which cook cooks it on that day, because some days it's super salty, and other days it's okay. I have to stop here, there are just way too many dishes to write about and not many of them truly stand out. Overall, this place doesn't need to try hard because it's always jam-packed on Sundays, with an eclectic mix of people (not just Chinese) coming in to try the ""best dim-sum in Brooklyn."" Don't get your hopes up, it's not that great, it's just good.Underwhelming, to say the least, but worth one try.",3.0
"The only dimsum spot my friends, family, and I frequent! You really have to come at the right times where they restock the food so everything is fresh and piping hot! From all the times I've been here... I think they usually restock around 1045-11am and 1245-1pm. By restock I mean pushing a cart fresh from the kitchen to refill the carts with. Make sure you grab those instead of what's been sitting around for the past hour! The things they do best compared to other restaurants IMO is their fung jao (marinated chicken feet), lau sa bao (steamed buns filled with salted egg yolk), marinated beef tripe (the one being scooped from the cart with turnips, not Albert yip lol), fried bacon wrapped shrimp served with mayo, salt and pepper squid, egg tarts, and their durian pastry!

Favorites of mine are the durian pastry (it was my first exposure to durian's odd smell and taste and won me over) and the black sesame seed mochi (to die for). Their egg custard buns are also quite good. Like dim sum restaurants in general, the staff seem distracted and stressed, but there have been a couple of servers capable of genuine smiles or friendly chitchat.

"I was here for a wedding on Sunday. This review is solely based on that.Likes: 1) Delicious food! Every dish is scrumptious and leaving me wanting more. 2) It's a pretty big place so there's plenty of room for dancing and wedding games. Dislikes: 1) Bad service. At first the staff served us. After awhile, they got lazy. Even though they weren't busy, they were just standing and looking around. After they bring a dish over, they come back 5 minutes later asking if we are done. If anyone else want it anymore. If everyone said no, I see them packing these left overs for themselves to bring home. Kind of aggressive and unprofessional. Give us a little more time to work on our food that's just been brought out?  2) Only half of the restaurant was booked for the wedding. There were partitions on one side but the other side was out in the open. I see nosy people walking over and standing there watching the wedding. No privacy whatsoever.

Who knew chicken feet could be so tasty? ;)Super cheap and soooo good. It was definitely worth the trip. You will not be disappointed. We were stuffed and the bill was $32 for 3 people.

"This place is seriously fantastic. I mean you can tell by the lines out the door on a weekend. Two hour wait times and people still huddle in the hallway to brave the cold and the high winds to enjoy authentic clean dim sum. The most important part of dining for dim sum is the cleanliness of the restaurant, and the seafood is always fresh. They also clean the shrimp very well as you can tell from my other dim sum reviews not every place is on point with that.Service is also one of their strongest here. Everyone is friendly, especially the servers and the managers. They are really attentive and give you five star service. My mom was impressed too. Shes a very hard person to impress. She was complaining about the traffic from the city and the bridge and also the limited parking spaces, but all those problems went away when we were treated very well here.Weekends you can expect to wait forever, and there is barely any parking. Might have to park five to ten blocks on those days, the lot is full.Oh yeah, my mom wants me to have my wedding reception here. :)",5.0

"Finally got the in-laws to trek into Brooklyn for dim sum instead of staying in Chinatown.  I never understood why people would wait an hour+ for dim sum but after waiting a solid 45 minutes (arriving at 10:30) with two young children on a holiday weekday, I understood why.  There is a lot more variety compared to your average dim sum place and it's pretty darn good. The fried little baos that you dip into sweet condense milk...oh man.  My mother in law typically complains a lot (not just because she is my m.i.l.).  She said the restaurant is too small, too many ppl, long wait and if we had ate in Chinatown we would be eating already instead of standing around packed like sardines and watching other people eat.  But...when we sat down and got around to ordering the durian pastry (which is how we convinced her in the first place) and she took a bite, and we asked her if it was good and she just nodded.  Bam, shut her up!I think we ordered about 25 dishes between 5 adults and 2 kids which is A LOT of freaking food for us but it was all good dim sum and overall, glad that we came.  The service is typical Chinese restaurant.  Not going to expect attentiveness like if you were eating at Per Se.  Funny thing is as we got the check and asked for the to go boxes to put some leftovers in, the waiter that came over just kept on walking as I was still talking to him and asking him about some malay rolls to see if the kitchen had some ready.  He just kept on walking and didn't acknowledge me in anyway that he heard me.  When he came back to give us the boxes, he said malay rolls not ready.  We all looked at each other and laughed because we didn't think he heard us or cared.  Next time we will try to get here earlier and see if we still have to wait that long because darn it, I am thinking about those fried little ""mon taus"".  Oh and the kids were also quietly eating so you know the food was good.  That or they were freaking starving from waiting that long (could be both).",4.0

definitely my favorite spot for dim sum. Food is so so. but who cares if you are hungry. The line is very short here compare to most place. No wait if you come here by say 11am and at most 10 minute wait if after. The food is really cheap. i will say average around $2 per dim sum. The quantity is never compromised in my opinion. they taste same everywhere. I am not sure if they still offer the hotpot special which you can have AYCA for like $17 during wintertime.,5.0

The fried little baos that you dip into sweet condense milk...oh man.  My mother in law typically complains a lot (not just because she is my m.i.l.).  She said the restaurant is too small, too many ppl, long wait and if we had ate in Chinatown we would be eating already instead of standing around packed like sardines and watching other people eat.  But...when we sat down and got around to ordering the durian pastry (which is how we convinced her in the first place) and she took a bite, and we asked her if it was good and she just nodded.  Bam, shut her up!I think we ordered about 25 dishes between 5 adults and 2 kids which is A LOT of freaking food for us but it was all good dim sum and overall, glad that we came.  The service is typical Chinese restaurant.  Not going to expect attentiveness like if you were eating at Per Se.  Funny thing is as we got the check and asked for the to go boxes to put some leftovers in, the waiter that came over just kept on walking as I was still talking to him and asking him about some malay rolls to see if the kitchen had some ready.  He just kept on walking and didn't acknowledge me in anyway that he heard me.  When he came back to give us the boxes, he said malay rolls not ready.  We all looked at each other and laughed because we didn't think he heard us or cared.  Next time we will try to get here earlier and see if we still have to wait that long because darn it, I am thinking about those fried little ""mon taus"".  Oh and the kids were also quietly eating so you know the food was good.  That or they were freaking starving from waiting that long (could be both).",4.0
"I classify myself as a dim sum addict. I have been to many in Flushing and all the good ones in manhattan (Jing Fong, Royal Seafood, Golden Unicorn etc) and East Harbor Seafood is by far the best dim sum in all of the boroughs!!!!Take the N train. It goes express in Brooklyn and isn't far from the city!!! Come here.The har gow is amazing. Everything is amazing. The service is great too. If one of the ladies doesn't have what you're looking for, she will go get it for you.",5.0
"Excellence Great service too bad it's out of the way"" I had a healthy delicious time. Thanks staff is really friendly.",5.0
definitely my favorite spot for dim sum. Food is so so. but who cares if you are hungry. The line is very short here compare to most place. No wait if you come here by say 11am and at most 10 minute wait if after. The food is really cheap. i will say average around $2 per dim sum. The quantity is never compromised in my opinion. they taste same everywhere. I am not sure if they still offer the hotpot special which you can have AYCA for like $17 during wintertime.,5.0
Great place. Food is delicious and the servers are very friendly to all. Dim sum places typically have servers who don't speak English which can get frustrating but this placed surprised me. Everyone understood me and made sure I got exactly what I was looking for.,5.0
"The best dim sum in all the five boroughs. My wife craves this place regularly and I'm very happy to journey off with her to satisfy said craving. The main thing here is fresh and clean. Most dim sum places in New York fall into one of two categories: fancy or filthy. I can't say that East Harbor is either of those since it's prices are well affordable, but the ingredients are of the highest quality. The service is excellent too. One tip is to try and get there before 11 am on weekends. You are virtually guaranteed an immediate table, since that's when the carts usually start to turn over from lighter options to more substantial lunch dishes. It gets increasingly packed from around 10:30-11, so that's a perfect time to enjoy all the late morning and early afternoon options. Of course, if you prefer a later time for dim sum, then it's still well worth the 30+ minute wait that you are bound to encounter.If you are anywhere within an hour drive of this place, then it's a must visit. There might be many other dim sum spots that you would consider a personal favorite, but you honestly can't say that with full confidence until you give East Harbor a try.",5.0
"Man, I have no idea how I let Ju L convince me to wake up at 7am and journey to Brooklyn for morning dim sum. ......Okay fk you guys I begged her to let me go. So what. So we jump into Cindy the civic and cruised to the second star to the right and straight on till morning. Um, exit 20 off the BQE. The decor is similar to every other dim sum place in existence. I'm talking about the huge golden ""happiness"" Chinese character plastered on a red wall, the white tea cups, white plates, and the light jade colored chopsticks. It's all the damn same.What differentiates East Harbor from your average dim sum is their wide selection. The egg yolk buns, the lotus seed buns, fried durian pastry, pork filled eggplant, black sesame rolls, zhaliang (fried dough wrapped in rice noodles) that may be missing from your local dim sum restaurant can all be found here. Likes: sticky rice in lotus leaf - a sizeable portion with tons of fillings. Dislikes: beef/shrimp rice noodle rolls - the skin is a bit dry. The good ones are the ones you can just slurp up. But I haven't had a great one since Guangzhou :(For a total tab of 77 dollars, we were able to fill 7 people with authentic dim sum. That's always a 4 star in my book.",4.0
"Mm, definitely one of the best dim sum places I've been to! Cheap, delicious, and a huge variety. Plus they speak Mandarin which is a big plus for me because my Cantonese is limited to counting to ten and saying stuff like ""sik fan."" Didn't have a single dish that I didn't greatly enjoy, and I have high standards coming from California and having lived in Hong Kong for a few months. However, dim sum places in California usually have xiao long bao, which I guess isn't the case here. =( LOVED their nai huang bao (steamed custard bun) though, probably my favorite ever, and the dan ta/egg tarts were good too. They also have fried durian here which is worth a try even if you don't like durian. For a party of 4, we stuffed ourselves silly and the total was only $40.Yeah, you gotta wait on the weekend mornings and fiercely stake out your spot in line against the hoards of Cantonese grandmas waiting to swoop in in case you don't show, but come on, it's dim sum. That's how you know it's good.Free valet in their moderately sized garage if you get lucky!",4.0
"Love this place! I've been coming here pretty regularly for years now, and it never disappoints.Their dim sum selection is wonderful (try the tripe, wrapped fried dough, and the Phoenix chicken feet). The steamed buns are also fresh and delicious (try the yellow custard ones!).In terms of main dishes, you can't really go wrong. I'm a big fan of the yin yang fried rice (half tomato sauce, half white cream sauce), as well as their beef chow fun.The waitstaff is very attentive and really easy to talk to and develop a rapport with.A fair warning- when the weather's nice, this place gets seriously packed! Try to get here after 2 so you don't have to wait as long to be seated. Also, this restaurant should definitely be on a list of stuff white people like. I've brought several non Asian friends here and they all loved it. I would definitely recommend bringing an experienced dim sum connoisseur just so you have a handle of what you might like. Personally, I think everything's great, but some things are definitely acquired tastes!",5.0
"The dim sum lines get long and its expected. The caller of the lines doesn't do the job as he should though. Instead of calling the numbers in numerical order, he looks at the paper slip that is placed in front of him. (For example: he can have seats 21-30 in front of him and the paper with 1-20 behind it, and he'll still call seats 21-30 first). Other than that, the food is decent and the service isn't bad.",4.0
Haven't been here in quite awhile.  Lines are just too long too wait on weekends for Dim Sum.  Food and service was great.  All the classic Dim Sum dishes were fresh and had tasty!!!  If it wasn't for the long waits on weekends we'd come more often.,4.0
"Came here around 9:30am on a Sunday morning and was thrilled to only wait around 15 minutes for a shared table for two. (I've been here closer to 11am on a Sunday with a larger party and had to wait 2 hours to be seated). Most dishes were hot and fresh; all were tasty and full of quality ingredients. Service was very prompt and attendants were seen but not heard, which I appreciated. Some dim sum parlors can be quite noisy and cart attendants can be too aggressive, but this wasn't the case with my experience at East Harbor Seafood Palace. The total for two very full bellies was under $25 before tax and tip - great deal! I'm already looking forward to my next visit, whenever I feel like making the trek out to Bay Ridge.",4.0
"Was craving dim sum after moving to the East coast from California, so was happy to give this place a try - seemed legit.  Had a big 'ol B (for bueno I'm sure) posted outside so we knew it was the real deal.  Pretty reasonable, and pretty good tasting for everything we had, but the carts weren't running super quickly and I feel like we were lacking some variety for a little while.  The service was good though, and though we did have to wait a little while it wasn't a super long wait.",4.0
"Came here for a quick lunch and the place was packed! Unlike most of the other patrons, we decided on the lunch specials (vs dim sum). I had the garlic eggplant, and it was delicious! One of the few places in the area with vegetarian options! The rice is $1 extra, but you can't complain because the special is $6. Service is prompt. I could make 2 meals with the amount I got. Definitely worth checking out!",4.0

I love this place for dim sum only. Its definitely worth the long wait. they have a great selection and its very tasty. as for dinner i think its a different chef and my experience was not good at all. and i had went to dinner on two separate occasions. thats usually the number of times i go to a place before i can critique them because some times people have off nights. thats just understandable.,4.0
"Awesome dim sum almost worth the 1.5 hour trek to get there (was in the area for something else that day so decided to check out this place first).  We were there at 11:30ish and didn't have problems getting seats for 2 (sharing a table of course ...).The ingredients were so fresh and quality - some of the best shrimp dumplings I've ever had.  The leek/shrimp bun was also a standout for me, as was the chili blackbean clams (which had a ridiculous amount of clams, not that I'm complaining). There was also a dim sum dish that you can special order that I really enjoyed - rice sticks cooked on a scallop shell (with a fresh scallop) - very original and flavorful.Even better? Super cheap (even more so than Flushing). We had at least 10 dishes, which came out to be under $40. It's not often that my stomach- and my wallet- satisfaction are proportional, but that definitely happened at East Harbor Seafood Palace.",4.0

"This is my favorite place for Dim Sum in Brooklyn. The dishes are prepped right. The food is good. Servers know what the hell they are doing. The prices are right. This place is on point!There is free parking (2 dollars tip) next to it but it is always filled up. Other than that, parking in the area is non existent. The wait on the weekend is ridiculous but testament to how popular this place is, and lack of better dim sum places in BK.Tip: The Bp station down the block on 8th ave, and the Exxon gas station near the BQE have the cheapest gas (cash or credit card) in the whole city... So fill up before going home.",4.0
"We visited this place twice during the last few days, first for dimsum and then for a extended family dinner party.  It was crowded when we went for dimsum.  While the dimsum service could be improved (carts rarely came down our aisle), the food was good.  The dinner party was great though.  We had one of the private VIP rooms and the service was great.  Prompt and efficient, they brought out the food and cleared our dirty dishes as necessary.  The food was good too and I am eating their leftover fried rice and roast chicken even as I type this.",4.0
Really enjoyed Dim Sum on a Sunday afternoon.  I was a little nervous when we got there and there was a long line but we were seated quickly.  The service was VERY good and the food fantastic.  I'm really looking forward to going again.,4.0
"When I go have dim sum this is usually the place I go. From the typical orders of spare ribs, beef balls and shiu mai it never disappoints. Prices are a little expensive compared to other dim sum places but its worth it for the quality you get. On the weekends be prepared to wait because the lines get ridiculous and parking is a pain in the ass.",4.0
"I've been coming here for many years and this is still one of my favorite places to get dim sum in the neighborhood. The food is consistently good and the prices are reasonable ($2-3 per dish). They have a wide variety of dim sum dishes and they do it push-cart style. This place is also clean and they have plenty of staff. The dishes and cups are white and you can tell they've been thoroughly washed. Table clothes are changed after customers leave and the staff are quick and efficient at getting tea and taking orders (if you decide to order from the kitchen). Also, due to the volume of people, be prepared to share a table with another party. Try to get there early (before 10am) or be prepared to wait. Saturday and Sunday wait times are normally 30-45 minutes. You go up to the counter, tell them your party size, get a number, and wait to be called. They announce your number over the loud speaker (normally in Cantonese but they can call out your number in Mandarin or English if you tell them). They have a small garage right next to the restaurant but it's normally full after 12:30pm.This is definitely my top spot for dim sum in the 8th Ave area.",4.0
"This is my 300th review......yay.....We met up with a group of friends here, the food is much different and more expensive than the Bay Area......It was sort of family style, we each chose a dish and the best of all dishes were the lamb chops, we had 2 different styles, and both were great.....The other dishes were mainly regular dishes that most typical restaurants serve, such as tofu, green veggies, chicken......It is definitely a nicer and higher end restaurant for the local Brooklyn Chinese, I noticed many family gatherings that evening......Must one day try their dim sum.....",4.0
"Excellent dim sum! Arrived on a Saturday around 10:30AM and was seated within 10 minutes. The food is fresh and the servers are friendly even if you only speak English.

This place had probably the best dim sum in the neighborhood.  Dinner is pretty good as well but is a little bit on the pricier side compared to other chinese banquet style restaurants,4.0
"This is my favorite place for Dim Sum in Brooklyn. The dishes are prepped right. The food is good. Servers know what the hell they are doing. The prices are right. This place is on point!There is free parking (2 dollars tip) next to it but it is always filled up. Other than that, parking in the area is non existent. The wait on the weekend is ridiculous but testament to how popular this place is, and lack of better dim sum places in BK.Tip: The Bp station down the block on 8th ave, and the Exxon gas station near the BQE have the cheapest gas (cash or credit card) in the whole city... So fill up before going home.",4.0
"We visited this place twice during the last few days, first for dimsum and then for a extended family dinner party.  It was crowded when we went for dimsum.  While the dimsum service could be improved (carts rarely came down our aisle), the food was good.  The dinner party was great though.  We had one of the private VIP rooms and the service was great.  Prompt and efficient, they brought out the food and cleared our dirty dishes as necessary.  The food was good too and I am eating their leftover fried rice and roast chicken even as I type this.",4.0
Really enjoyed Dim Sum on a Sunday afternoon.  I was a little nervous when we got there and there was a long line but we were seated quickly.  The service was VERY good and the food fantastic.  I'm really looking forward to going again.,4.0
"When I go have dim sum this is usually the place I go. From the typical orders of spare ribs, beef balls and shiu mai it never disappoints. Prices are a little expensive compared to other dim sum places but its worth it for the quality you get. On the weekends be prepared to wait because the lines get ridiculous and parking is a pain in the ass.",4.0
"I've been coming here for many years and this is still one of my favorite places to get dim sum in the neighborhood. The food is consistently good and the prices are reasonable ($2-3 per dish). They have a wide variety of dim sum dishes and they do it push-cart style. This place is also clean and they have plenty of staff. The dishes and cups are white and you can tell they've been thoroughly washed. Table clothes are changed after customers leave and the staff are quick and efficient at getting tea and taking orders (if you decide to order from the kitchen). Also, due to the volume of people, be prepared to share a table with another party. Try to get there early (before 10am) or be prepared to wait. Saturday and Sunday wait times are normally 30-45 minutes. You go up to the counter, tell them your party size, get a number, and wait to be called. They announce your number over the loud speaker (normally in Cantonese but they can call out your number in Mandarin or English if you tell them). They have a small garage right next to the restaurant but it's normally full after 12:30pm.This is definitely my top spot for dim sum in the 8th Ave area.",4.0
"This is my 300th review......yay.....We met up with a group of friends here, the food is much different and more expensive than the Bay Area......It was sort of family style, we each chose a dish and the best of all dishes were the lamb chops, we had 2 different styles, and both were great.....The other dishes were mainly regular dishes that most typical restaurants serve, such as tofu, green veggies, chicken......It is definitely a nicer and higher end restaurant for the local Brooklyn Chinese, I noticed many family gatherings that evening......Must one day try their dim sum.....",4.0
"Excellent dim sum! Arrived on a Saturday around 10:30AM and was seated within 10 minutes. The food is fresh and the servers are friendly even if you only speak English. With the reasonable pricing, delicious authentic food, and friendly service, this place is an awesome option for dim sum in Brooklyn. However, make sure you arrive on the earlier side because the line builds up...",4.0
"White people LOVE this place. In a sea of Chinese folk, I can always spot atleast 5 tables of Caucasians. Why? I'm honestly confused because this is not the best dim sum ever. It's a pretty un-trendy/un-cool area. Maybe it's the proximity to Bay Ridge? I'm not sure. Whatever the case is, the dim sum here is ONLY slightly better than decent. The egg tart is a little too runny and the salt and pepper squid soggy, but I do enjoy the huge selection.It is ALWAYS crowded here. ALWAYS. Dim sum is always a huge mess. There are shove-y Chinese people pushing and squeezing their way from the door to the host. It's a chaotic jungle. If you want to have dim sum here, come early or else prepare yourself to wait about 30 minutes. Ridiculous!Anyway, the point of my review was not to say that this place sucks because it doesn't. I just want to say that dim sum here is good, but it's not all the hype that Yelp claims it is. If you come here expecting the ""best dim sum"" you will definitely be disappointed. It's good but it ain't THAT good!",3.0

One lovely young lady, (I wont mention Isana G's name), actually spat her food into a napkin a couple of times. but she's an OG Thug kinda gal anyways. Im just happy she didnt have to pop any caps (buck buck!).So, I'll likely not ever go back here but I will say the experience was fun.

"One of the better restaurants around the area for authentic Chinese food. I've been here many times for dim sum as well as dinner. I enjoy coming here for dinner because the wait for dim sum on weekends is just too unbearable considering I'm usually starving and I have a big family which means I have to wait even longer to be seated.This review would be for dinner that I had here a few days ago. We came around 6pm on a Monday and I was craving steamed jumbo oysters served on the half shell, so we sent my brother inside to ask if they were serving any for the evening - they said yes, so we parked and came in. We were seated immediately, the restaurant was completely empty with the exception of one other table. As soon as we sat down, the waiter apologized for not having any more oysters -___- first bummer of the evening considering we came here for oysters! Oh well, next time.For our meal, we ordered 1 appetizer, 1 soup (for 6), and 5 entree dishes. The food came out within 15 minutes, a plus for fast service! We started off with an order of snails with garlic. Then came the fish maw soup, which is a MUST order whenever I have dinner at any Chinese restaurant - its very yummy with a little bit of the red vinegar. We also ordered seafood tofu casserole, steak, sweet and sour pork ribs, fried fish, and another seafood dish I have no idea how to say in English. Everything was tasty, cooked well and had a great presentation.And as always, the dinner ends with complementary fruits and dessert - Chinese sweet soup.Will I come back? Yes, even though this place is a little more pricey than the others around the area.",4.0
"I stopped by here just after it opens up on a weekend - 8:30a on Saturday morning - and it was already busy. There's a small parking lot (labeled with P and the restaurant name in Chinese, only) for a few cars if you get there early enough. Otherwise they'll put your car on the sidewalk or you'll find street parking.Craziness. There's a lot of people here, and it fills up fast.Hot and swift, the carts come around and you get some of the best dimsum in the city. It's hot, it's tasty, and the quality is fairly decent. The ginger beef tripe was good, the chicken feet were so-so (needed more of a black bean taste), the rice noodle w shrimp or fried dough were good, and the dumplings all came out hot and pleasant.  Some things you had to ask for - the daikon radish cake, for instance. Clam in black bean sauce, as Chi N. noted, were good, too!Egg tarts were nice and fluffy here, though.

I know they serve dim sum until about 3, but you should come earlier so your choices are fresh and ample. I get the usual dim sum fare and I really can't complain about any of it. As big as this place is, it still gets pretty packed during peak dim sum time on the weekends. If you don't come with a table full of people, be prepared to be seated with strangers.There's a small valet parking lot across the street from the restaurant, but gets packed fairly quickly, the lot only really fits about 20 cars tops. As with most authentic chinese restaurants, they prefer that you pay with cash. They won't charge you tax if you pay cash, they will if you pay with a charge card. The only thing that makes me pause is the ""B"" rating, but the food looks fresh and tastes fresh.

"This place is the most popular dim sum restaurant in the area and that's why it is always crowded on weekends! The food is better quality than a lot of other places and they have more variety on the weekends too. We are never rushed out of there even if they are calling numbers for seats. There is usually a line into the parking lot, if you don't mind walking, just park further. Shrimp rice noodles never seem like a bad choice!",4.0
This is my favorite dimsum place. I recommend the beef rice noodle (noodle not too thick and is very smooth) and the chicken feet (very savory).I usually come before 11am to have a shorter wait.,5.0
"Two of us came here for Dim Sum on a Sunday morning, and we had to wait almost a hour to be seated.  I didn't mind the wait, because seating in a crowded section with screaming kids and push people along the way is part of the Dim Sum experience.Everything is good here, therefore the two of us spent $45 here.  For those who know the price for Dim Sum...that is A LOT of chickien feet, shirmp dumplings, and flat noodles......",4.0

"Coming from LA and always craving dim sum, I searched for a place that would bring me back to my city where dim sum meant sitting in a loud Chinese restaurant as it was pushed around in carts by little Chinese women serving all sorts of goodies.  Now, living in NY, I realized with the small spaces it would be hard to find, but imagine how happy I was when I realized there were a few spots in Brooklyn that did just that.  Based on Yelp reviews I decided to try East Harbor Seafood Palace first and due to a recent experience with another restaurant I'm glad it was my first choice.  True the line was long, but the service and the food are worth the wait.  For a party of two we feasted for less than $21 not including tip.  I will definitely be going back for seconds and thirds.",4.0
"I went here with my friend early one Sunday morning. He was adamant that I had to try dim sum and this was one of the best places in Brooklyn, noted for its authenticity and flavor.

They gave us a number and we waited, after about five minutes or so they said our number in english and we were seated in the middle of the palace. I hate long reviews so let me say the service was quick and the food was pretty good.

"One of the better restaurants around the area for authentic Chinese food. I've been here many times for dim sum as well as dinner. I enjoy coming here for dinner because the wait for dim sum on weekends is just too unbearable considering I'm usually starving and I have a big family which means I have to wait even longer to be seated.This review would be for dinner that I had here a few days ago. We came around 6pm on a Monday and I was craving steamed jumbo oysters served on the half shell, so we sent my brother inside to ask if they were serving any for the evening - they said yes, so we parked and came in. We were seated immediately, the restaurant was completely empty with the exception of one other table. As soon as we sat down, the waiter apologized for not having any more oysters -___- first bummer of the evening considering we came here for oysters! Oh well, next time.For our meal, we ordered 1 appetizer, 1 soup (for 6), and 5 entree dishes. The food came out within 15 minutes, a plus for fast service! We started off with an order of snails with garlic. Then came the fish maw soup, which is a MUST order whenever I have dinner at any Chinese restaurant - its very yummy with a little bit of the red vinegar. We also ordered seafood tofu casserole, steak, sweet and sour pork ribs, fried fish, and another seafood dish I have no idea how to say in English. Everything was tasty, cooked well and had a great presentation.And as always, the dinner ends with complementary fruits and dessert - Chinese sweet soup.Will I come back? Yes, even though this place is a little more pricey than the others around the area.",4.0
"I stopped by here just after it opens up on a weekend - 8:30a on Saturday morning - and it was already busy. There's a small parking lot (labeled with P and the restaurant name in Chinese, only) for a few cars if you get there early enough. Otherwise they'll put your car on the sidewalk or you'll find street parking.Craziness. There's a lot of people here, and it fills up fast.Hot and swift, the carts come around and you get some of the best dimsum in the city. It's hot, it's tasty, and the quality is fairly decent. The ginger beef tripe was good, the chicken feet were so-so (needed more of a black bean taste), the rice noodle w shrimp or fried dough were good, and the dumplings all came out hot and pleasant.  Some things you had to ask for - the daikon radish cake, for instance. Clam in black bean sauce, as Chi N. noted, were good, too!Egg tarts were nice and fluffy here, though. We stuffed ourselves as a group of four that had come in early... haha :)Nothing too crazy exotic here, but almost all the staples I ate or saw on people's tables.",3.0

"Really great for dim sum durning the day , affordable , lots of variety. They have old school favorites like chicken feet and beef noodle to new additions such as clams and fried tofu.

I've been here for dimsum since they first open. Their dim sum is pretty decent. The wait isn't that long and its easy to find parking.

"Came here for dim sum, its just like any dim sum place, it was good, had the shrimp churn and that was good, also had the ""jai lurn"" (churn fun wrapped around crueller), that was not the greatest, the crueller was overfried and tasted like it was from last night, i think they don't have as much variety and nothing that stands out from the other places, otherwise, i'm not disappointed, the price is average and not bad, don't expect parking to be easy to find, u must go a block or two away and there should be spots",3.0

Stewed Beef Brisket in a sizzling pot, Super Crispy Fried Anchovies and Crispy Bacon Wrapped Minced Shrimp.

"Mmmmmm yummy yummy dim sum. East Harbor is one of the best i've had in terms of quality, selection, amount, flavor, and temperature.Wait staff is friendly and attentive, but give them a little time as there's usually a ton of people just clamoring for their attention too. Sometimes they'll give you complimentary milk tea or coffee. Coffee's a little sour but the milk tea hits the spot!While we like to get a huge selection of the dim sum (shu mai, sesame gel rolls, chicken feet, beef balls, tripe, rice crepes, etc etc), we also like to order a dish with a little more substance. We usually get some type of Chow Hor Fun. One of the best and most unique was one topped with a fish pate. It was realllyyyyyyyy good. And there was definitely a good flavor, temperature, and ""wok hai"" to all their food...And now i'm craving some dim sum....",4.0
This is my fave 8th Ave dim sum  (although technically it aint on 8th Ave). They have those great tofu hua (tofu in sweet sauce) which I rarely find around these parts.

"Best dim sum we've had so far hands down. Better than the other place down the street on fort hamilton, Spring Garden Restaurant, which is not nearly as fresh and has very little variety in terms of dishes.There will always be a wait here (usually no more than 20 minutes) and they will always call your number in English if they see that you are white or are a Chinese person who can't speak Chinese. Coming here early won't matter. We tried that once but all the dishes we like seem to roll out around 11 so you might as well come here in the afternoon crush of all the other miserable people. Favorites: bok choi with garlic, pan-fried shrimp and chive dumplings, roast-pork-wrapped rice noodles, tiny steamed beef ribs. Most of the things you try here will be good.The only funny thing about this place is that there always seems to be a chronic shortage of egg tarts. A waiter once explained to us that this was because egg tarts take a very long time to cook and they only make a few batches at a time. I have sat waiting for these egg tarts on many occasions without complaint. They are delicious.",5.0
"Also known as, ""the place Anthony Bourdain went to"", this dim sum palace is in fact palatial in size, although the quality is perhaps not always fit for a king. I've only eaten here for dim sum, and only for a change of scenery from my usual dim sum place down the street (Spring Garden), but the few times I've visited I end up wishing I just stuck to the standard. The menu includes the usual extensive items you find at any decent Chinese restaurant, but the offerings lean on the heavy, greasy side, and sometimes served lukewarm or cold. These qualities certainly lend themselves to question the freshness of the food served, and I certainly ate carefully in fear of GI catastrophe during my visits. Waits for a table on the weekends can be tremendous, but the portions are satisfying. There is free valet just next to the restaurant, but it tends to be a real clusterf*ck.",3.0

"In a building nondescript and ugly enough to blend in with the surround automotive repair shops lives East Harbor Seafood Palace, a tribute to dim sum in the northern reaches of Dyker Heights, just south of Sunset Park.

Take a number upon entering and wait for the microphone to call it out (and maybe suggest that it be yelled in English if you are not with any Chinese speakers).This place seems to stick to the classics, and lovers of typical dim sum dishes won't be discouraged with the carts that roll around. While everything might be slightly oilier than usual, it is still tasty, and every once in a while surprisingly good, like the special turnip cake pieces below that come with sautéed onions that almost resemble bacon in both appearance and taste.A hierarchy of suited men, vested men and women, and yellow-shirted women work at a fast pace during your meal. It is all slightly aggressive like any dim sum can be, but efficient in getting most options to you quickly. I felt like we had a lot of choices in a very short amount of time, which can be good and bad in many ways.While the prices are not rock-bottom even for Manhattan standards ($1.95/2.50/2.85 for small/medium/large), the quality justifies it and makes the price low.

"4.5So NY, you rave about your dim sum and this seems to be the best you've got. Oh, don't get me wrong, the taste is authentic, the prices are fair, and it's dim sum all week long. The waiters are quick to bring you what you ask, always attentive with your tea and water (I literally just finished pouring the last cup of tea and I didn't even set it down before he came over and took it from me to refill). I would be proud. But my dear, the selection and taste is hardly SoCal-quality. Sorry!I enjoy the mad crowds of people, the Cantonese yelled over the noise, and hoarding my food right when I sit down. But the canto aunties are pushier (in true NY-fashion I guess) and the variety, while a lot--especially compared to what I get in DC, isn't as close to what I get in SoCal. It seems to be an east-coast thing, but I really don't like sharing a table with random people just because i have a smaller party. Yes, we have three people, but we order enough for six. I especially hate it when we share it with a couple who is ""being adventurous"" (ie: the bf is willing to try anything that looks/sounds interesting, but the gf always has this huge stink face on. Woman, we don't like you either).For you SoCalers who like mango pudding: they don't do the condensed/evaporated milk on top.  They've apparently never heard the combo and thought it was weird that my brother asked them if they have it (asked two of the aunties servers who told him no, clearly thinking he was crazy, so he asked the waiters and he gave him a strange look and said he would check.  Came back coffee cream).  The process was amusing, especially since the waiter really did seek this out for us.  Surprisingly, the creamer he brought back is actually pretty good with mango pudding.East Harbor is definitely worth the trek out of Manhattan and the wait, since it *almost* reminds me of home, but little things here and there still irk me.",5.0

Overall, it's ""A-OK"".",3.0
"4.5So NY, you rave about your dim sum and this seems to be the best you've got. Oh, don't get me wrong, the taste is authentic, the prices are fair, and it's dim sum all week long. The waiters are quick to bring you what you ask, always attentive with your tea and water (I literally just finished pouring the last cup of tea and I didn't even set it down before he came over and took it from me to refill). I would be proud. But my dear, the selection and taste is hardly SoCal-quality. Sorry!I enjoy the mad crowds of people, the Cantonese yelled over the noise, and hoarding my food right when I sit down. But the canto aunties are pushier (in true NY-fashion I guess) and the variety, while a lot--especially compared to what I get in DC, isn't as close to what I get in SoCal. It seems to be an east-coast thing, but I really don't like sharing a table with random people just because i have a smaller party. Yes, we have three people, but we order enough for six. I especially hate it when we share it with a couple who is ""being adventurous"" (ie: the bf is willing to try anything that looks/sounds interesting, but the gf always has this huge stink face on. Woman, we don't like you either).For you SoCalers who like mango pudding: they don't do the condensed/evaporated milk on top.  They've apparently never heard the combo and thought it was weird that my brother asked them if they have it (asked two of the aunties servers who told him no, clearly thinking he was crazy, so he asked the waiters and he gave him a strange look and said he would check.  Came back coffee cream).  The process was amusing, especially since the waiter really did seek this out for us.  Surprisingly, the creamer he brought back is actually pretty good with mango pudding.East Harbor is definitely worth the trek out of Manhattan and the wait, since it *almost* reminds me of home, but little things here and there still irk me.",5.0
"This place opens at 9am, but when I arrived at around 945am there was a huge wait. Like most dimsum restaurants, its poorly organized and you pretty much have to find the guy who's taking down party numbers in order to get a table. The guy at this restaurant was wandering around aimlessly through the tables and of course there are crowds of Chinese people pouring in and making a reservation before you. Its quite frustrating how pushy you have to be at these establishments. Anyway he was calling out your reservation number via a microphone, but how the hell do you want me to find you when you are walking around the restaurant?My wait for two was about 15minutes, and it took a few minutes for the cart to come around after that. The food here was your typical dimsum plates, not too greasy and if you were lucky, it was fresh. The turnip cake I had was freezing cold. They didn't have as much variety as other dimsum restaurants and I left feeling like I missed out on something. Probably wouldnt come back here again, Park Asia is right across the street, although I'm sure if you come anytime past 901am you'll have to wait.",3.0
"BEST DIM SUM IN NYC. Very authentic, very Cantonese. You won't find xiao long boa there because that's more common in Shanghai. You will find sticky chicken rice (in the bamboo leaves), roast pork dumplings, and some different special dish every time you go. SO GOOD.When it gets super busy they'll hand out numbers and you have to wait for the number to be called- only they announce the numbers in Cantonese, not Mandarin, and not English. But they use Arabic numerals when they hand you your number, and if you ask the number announcer, he'll hook you up. BEST DIM SUM IN NYC.A video from our most recent visit.

"This is my favorite place for dim sum and dinner. Their food is fresh and authentic. Service is good. There's also free valet parking but it get's filled up quickly. If you don't get into their garage parking can be a bit challenging.I realized that the best day to go for dim sum is on Sunday. For some reason it tastes more fresh that Saturdays. Probably because its more packed on Sunday so food doesn't sit around. The shrimp noodle rolls are great. I love their siu mai (drooling thinking about them now)! Their fresh tofu dessert with ginger syrup is good too. For dinner I love ordering the Dungeness Crab steamed with sticky rice. The price is dependent on the size of the crab and usually averages about $50. It's enough to feed 6-8 people. I also love their tri-color snow pea leaves (made with egg, salty egg and thousand year egg)! I recommend this place to everyone. I don't live close by but I never mind the commute.",5.0
"Recently came here for my niece's 1 year birthday. My dad reserved 3 tables (10 people per table) 4-5 months in advance and ordered a 10 course banquet dinner. My dad is... a bit extreme with things he likes. The 10 course meal was comparable to most Chinese weddings I've attended. In fact, I've attended a couple wedding banquets at this very restaurant! A good reliable Chinese restaurant that my family goes to for allll sorts of occasions! For those who don't know what 10 course meals are like... I will explain:There are 10 dishes that are set in the middle of the turntable and everyone picks at it (family style). Usually you start off with jellyfish and will soon encounter puffed creamy covered shrimp, soup (shark fin/ spongey fish belly), sauteed lobster, abalone/mushroom w/bok choy, sea bass, fried rice, lo mein noodles...

"This place is absolutely the gold standard when it comes to hosting a dinner banquet.  Came here one sultry summer evening to celebrate my fellow countrymen who was turning 100 years old and from the soup to the lobster to the Shark fin Soup, everything was absolutely delicious. The lobster with ginger and scallion was off the hood. Meaty, not over cooked, the lobster was very tender and flavorful. The lobster was also not drenched in corn starched before cooking which is a big plus. The fried flounder with sauteed veggies was light and very settled. The Shrimps with walnuts on grand mariner sauce was absolutely mouth watering. Not maynaisy and not heavily greasy, the Shrimps were absolutely crunchy and flavorful. The Cantonese fried chicken was also very good. Not too garlicky but for some reason they gave us the gizzards which I found very weird and usual.  The only thing that I wish they can improve on is the noodles, the E- fu noodles towards the end was not very well made. The length of the noodles was the problem and the saltiness of the dish primarily. The longest noodle that I ate was the length of my fingers. The establishment is very big, even though from outside it doesn't seem very big. It has private rooms and most importantly, they have clean bathrooms. If I ever have to have organize a dinner banquet for my wedding, this place is probably going to be my top 5 spots.",5.0
"Been coming here often for a few years now. Often a long wait, so if you're coming here for dim sum/brunch on the weekends, gotta make it there before 12PM AT LEAST. Often, after 12pm, the wait will range from 20-40 minutes. Service is quick. Decor is..ehh, but it's not bad. The restaurant does well in dim sum! Very well. Maybe not the ""super best"", but it's definitely a very strong standing in that area, given the amount of business. I won't name any foods in particular, as the variety's too big to name, even a few. The dishes are not disappointing however. I think a good quick tip would be to avoid ordering ""super dishes"" or any of the fresh specialties you THINK should be eaten right off the pot, but served instead in a cart where it would get cold without a lid. More or less, avoid foods that look like it's trolled around too long, and looks cold. Obvious point, but gonna throw it out there. Recently, came here for a cousin's wedding. Food was pretty good. Again, not amazing, but good. Service was well. It seems that they fair both in dim sum AND non dim-sum events.

"the food was really good at first, maybe because we were hungry but when i got home i got a stomachache, along with everyone else that went with me. the place was really crowded but the wait wasn't as long, maybe 20-30 min on a sat night. the AC was on full blast and it was freezing the whole dinner. the food did not come together, we almost finish the frst two dishes before the rest came out. the food got cold very fast because of the AC. we ordered dim sum platter for appetizers, the spring rolls or egg rolls were ok but the pork sumai was really bad. entree were fried rice, chicken with cashew, pork with cashew, grilled steak and lobster. everything but the lobster was good. i was looking forward to the lobster but it was really hard and chewy. for a seafood restaurant, i expected a better. prices were fair, about $10 dish, $25 for lobster, $20 steak. but that's not worth getting a stomachache over.",1.0
"I died and went to dim sum heaven! You absolutely have to go with a friend who can communicate well because its heavy on the Chinese (or just be willing to be patient and practice pointing). My Chinese friend and her parents got the food for our group and ohh was it ever delicious. Fresh and steaming right out of the carts - each thing more savory and delicious than the last. We ate until I cursed myself for not bringing my stretchy pants! And then we had dessert - so good. Favorites are the shrimp wrapped in the wide noodle, shrimp and port dumplings, the shrimp dumplings, the meat wrapped in eggplant, and for dessert, the black sesame filled dumplings covered in crunchy coconut flakes, and the egg custard dumpling. I trekked there from westchester and will most definitely do it again.

"Classic dim sum.Come for the experience, expect only slightly above-average food. The Dyker Heights location of East Harbor Seafood Palace adds to the mystique. After treking through Sunset Park, you come to what looks like the end of the world. Suddenly your eye catches glimpse of a massive Chinese Dim Sum restaurant, with patient Chinese families queueing around the corner. Expect a wait, as we did (we waited 1 hour). And learn how to count in Cantonese, as it will help you understand when they call your table. Once you sit down, your classic Cantonese Dim Sum experience begins. Noisy families, gawdy Chinese banquette hall locale, pushcarts (a dying tradition!), the smells of steaming dumplings and fried goodies.The food itself was good. I'd say it's slightly above average. Everything tasted fresh; there was a liberal use of oil, but nothing was greasy; everything super tasty. I didn't NOT like any of the dishes, but none of them really stood out, save the few namesake seafood dishes. Expect the usual suspects of chicken feet in vinegar, shrimp dumplings, beef balls, meat dumpings, lotus rice, spicy pork baozi, tripe, meat wrapped in beancurd skin, watercress dumplings, fried eggplant, etc. The clams in a thick soy sauce were very good -- savory and fresh, not at all rubbery. I wish I could have sampled other seafood items; I assume you'd have to order from the menu. Also, order your made-to-order fresh greens early on, as they can take a while to arrive.",4.0
One of the good dim sum places in Brooklyn but expect to wait every time. People tend to stick it out. Sundays wait was for 1 hour!!! Due to a group of 6... Otherwise wonderful food.,4.0
"I'm chinese, off on sunday, hung over from a party sat night, where will I be the next morning....DIM SUM obviously!!!! Actually, i take it back. whether you're chinese or not, your butt will want to be here craving for those shrimp dumplings, chicken feet and chai lurn (fried dough with crepe). This resturant is huge and always have  a large selection of sweet and savory dim sum. But i minus one star becuase of the long wait- expect a 30 min wait..but it's worth it!! Parkings a bit difficult around the area but they do have a valet and if you come early, you might be able to grab a spot. Cant wait to go back soon!",4.0
Great dim sum! You know it's good because of the dozens of Chinese families waiting 30-60 mins on a Sunday for a table. Ate like kings for $20 each!,4.0
"This is my favorite place for dim sum and dinner. Their food is fresh and authentic. Service is good. There's also free valet parking but it get's filled up quickly. If you don't get into their garage parking can be a bit challenging.I realized that the best day to go for dim sum is on Sunday. For some reason it tastes more fresh that Saturdays. Probably because its more packed on Sunday so food doesn't sit around. The shrimp noodle rolls are great. I love their siu mai (drooling thinking about them now)! Their fresh tofu dessert with ginger syrup is good too. For dinner I love ordering the Dungeness Crab steamed with sticky rice. The price is dependent on the size of the crab and usually averages about $50. It's enough to feed 6-8 people. I also love their tri-color snow pea leaves (made with egg, salty egg and thousand year egg)! I recommend this place to everyone. I don't live close by but I never mind the commute.",5.0
"Recently came here for my niece's 1 year birthday. My dad reserved 3 tables (10 people per table) 4-5 months in advance and ordered a 10 course banquet dinner. My dad is... a bit extreme with things he likes. The 10 course meal was comparable to most Chinese weddings I've attended. In fact, I've attended a couple wedding banquets at this very restaurant! A good reliable Chinese restaurant that my family goes to for allll sorts of occasions! For those who don't know what 10 course meals are like... I will explain:There are 10 dishes that are set in the middle of the turntable and everyone picks at it (family style). Usually you start off with jellyfish and will soon encounter puffed creamy covered shrimp, soup (shark fin/ spongey fish belly), sauteed lobster, abalone/mushroom w/bok choy, sea bass, fried rice, lo mein noodles... If you are ever invited to a 10 course banquet, come hungry and pace yourself.

"As dim sum goes, I still haven't found a place that seems as delicious & fun as the places back home in San Jose. East Harbor Seafood Palace was pretty close though. After an arduous trip to get there, the sheer number of carts circling was a very welcome sight. They had a ton of variety and every possible shrimp dish. It was all pretty good. There were a few things I'd never had before, like the shrimp & eggplant, which I really liked, and a few standards like the pork buns did not disappoint, although there were a few funky things like some kind of soup I'd never seen before. We also got an order of pan-fried noodles, which were pretty tasty too. I left appropriately stuffed, at an appropriate price. Definitely worth the trek down there, although I think I'm still searching for my go-to place.",3.0

"This is a solid Chinese restaurant, possibly one of the best for dim sum in Brooklyn. They also excel in the dinner category. I would know. I come here at least once a week with my family, sometimes two or three times during holidays and special occasions.The waiters are for the most part attentive and nice. They pay attention to the diners' needs and change plates often (especially during dinner time). If you are ever dissatisfied, you can always speak to a waiter. If they are unable to help you, you can speak to one of the co-owners of the place who roam the restaurant. Instead of just walking around, the co-owners also get down and dirty, doing jobs such as clearing off the table, refilling the teapot, or tabulating your check. They don't seem to believe in ""I'm too good to do this job"" which makes them approachable and well liked by the rest of the staff. The dim sum choices are plenty with options for even the pickiest of eaters (vegetarians!!!) One thing to try would be the durian pastry. Unlike other dim sum places, this one actually tastes like durian. The strong aroma hits you on the first bite, intermingled with the hot puff pastry wrapped around it. Then, a sweet taste, like warm ice cream, floods your mouth, making every bite pure bliss. I recommend bringing some gum or mints to freshen your breath after this treat though. Also, their egg tarts when they come fresh out of the oven are unbeatable (usually, they will have an entire cart filled with egg tarts when they are fresh). Biting into a hot flaky tart filled with piping hot sweet egg custard is one of my favorite ways to end a dim sum session.East Harbor has just come out with a mushroom rice noodle which is delicious and vegetarian friendly. Their rice noodles as a whole are made very well here. Even the plain rice noodles (my favorite) can be made to order if you ask nicely! Another favorite of mine is the half soup dumpling which is really two large (and I mean large) dumplings in a light broth, served with red vinegar. The red vinegar, interspersed in broth and coating each bite of dumpling is a great way to warm up on a cold wintery day. As for dinner, I would definitely recommend their casseroles. Can't go wrong with any one of them. Satay eggplant with squid is a lightly spiced treat that accompanies a hot bowl of rice perfectly. Their tofu seafood casserole is warm and bubbly, with veggies on the bottom, eliminating the need to order an extra dish of choy. East Harbor also does a great lamb casserole which I recommend on cold winter days (or nights) to warm the belly. Being a seafood restaurant, their seafood selection is large. I usually ask the waiters what's fresh for that day. I always get the scallops when they are available because they are so fresh and sweet. East Harbor also has fresh lobster all the time, which can be stir fried or steamed over a bed of noodles (to capture all the lobster juices!!!) Their head fish chef is also a pro at steaming fish, cooking it till it is perfectly tender and drizzling an addictive secret soy sauce mixture on top. Delicious :)This is THE go to Chinese place for Chinese people.",5.0

"Awesome Dim Sum in Brooklyn - a must try! (we came here after watching Anthony Bourdain's ""outer Boroughs"" episode). first: they announce the numbers in cantonese. (but if you wait long enough, they'll say it in english if no one responds). signs of a great dim sum place is if they don't speak english! here's a few pointers on numbers: 1 - yat 2 - yee3 - sahm 4 - say 5 - ngh 6 - luk7 - chaat8 - baat9 - gau10 - sahp(and any number higher will add the ""sahp"" to it: 20: yeesahp. 30 sahmsahp, then add the digit afterwards) it'll help a bit if you pull this up on your mobile. :) the dim sum is tasty! everything we tried was great, and you can't go wrong. The waiters were quiet attentive too, with water and tea. we sat next to the kitchen, thinking it was a crappy spot, but ACTUALLY, the hot food comes out and you're the first table they hit up! and last, if you're a small party, they'll conserve tables, and have you share with another small party. they are busy folks!

"I admit the only reason I went to this place was because Anthony Bourdain featured it in one of shows.  But, hey the guy knows good food.My review is only based only having dim sum here.If it is dim sum you crave then this place will deliver.  However if you dont want to wait then get there at 11am sharp or average wait time thereafter is about half an hour.  Like many other Chinese dim sum places they give you a number and you wait for it to be called.  If you don't speak Chinese you'll be at a disadvantage because the guy who shouts out the numbers does so only in Cantonese.  Park your self by the lady who gives out the number and she will help you out.The kitchen is located behind the fish tanks. The  carts come out on the left side by the fish tanks.  If you are lucky enough to get seated in that general vicinity then you will have first crack at everything when it is piping hot.  The dim sum has got as much variety as any other place in the five boroughs.The cart ladies are very nice and it's easier to just have them show you what they have.  Dishes off the menu are also very good.The best thing about this place is the Chinatown prices.  I will wager anyone that if you stick to dim sum and you gorge yourself, you will be hard pressed to spend more than 20 bucks.Great value, this place gets 4 stars.",4.0
"As some have said earlier, this place has some of the best dim sum you will find in Brooklyn's Chinatown. Even though it is a bit off the beaten track, way up on 65th St. on the neighborhood's border, the extra time spent walking (or driving for those lucky few) will be well worth it once you are sitting comfortable and shouting out for another order of ha gao (steamed shrimp dumplings). This particular dim sum house was featured on Anthony Bordain's show ""No Reservations"" and the popularity of this spot amongst NYC foodies has been on the increase as of late (yeah, I've noticed some of you hipster infiltrators. Thanks a lot Bordain!).  So, no sleeping in on the weekend if you want a quick seat and getting right to flagging down those delicious carts zooming to and fro amongst a vibrant and animated crowd. Just don't be surprised if you have to race a little old lady to that cart for the last order of char siu boa, because she will win!After 10:30 the wait gets a bit crazy for groups larger than 2 and the scene borders on chaotic as the waiting crowd slowly works their way from the waiting area near the door, into the dining room beyond the host's stations (normally a line of demarkation of some sorts) and then right up behind/almost on top of tables of folks already seated.  Avoid the front few tables if possible, because I can guarantee that if you are there around 11am there will be a group of patrons-to-be hovering over you, staring into the dim sum horizon, hopelessly attempting to hawk down on opening seats.  Although this behavior obviously lacks class (and I still can't get over it regardless of how many times I've seen it happen), the neurotic crowd is a bit amusing to watch because they seem so freakin' stressed out by an experience that should be nothing but relaxing.   (I mean, come on, it's breakfast folks!)  Anyhow, management needs to do something about this and they could easily just ask the eager frontline to step away from the patrons' tables regardless of how much of a norm it has become amongst the crowd.  They LOSE A STAR over it.So, like most of the dim sum houses in the various NYC Chinatowns, get there early (don't complain if you can't find a seat when you show up at 11 on a Sunday), bring a group of people so you can order a bunch of different dishes (variety is the spice of life and the ticket to dim sum bliss), don't leave the appetite at home (in fact bring a little more if you got it in ya), and get yo yum cha on! You will not find MUCH better anywhere in the 5 boroughs.",3.0

"I admit the only reason I went to this place was because Anthony Bourdain featured it in one of shows.  But, hey the guy knows good food.My review is only based only having dim sum here.If it is dim sum you crave then this place will deliver.  However if you dont want to wait then get there at 11am sharp or average wait time thereafter is about half an hour.  Like many other Chinese dim sum places they give you a number and you wait for it to be called.  If you don't speak Chinese you'll be at a disadvantage because the guy who shouts out the numbers does so only in Cantonese.  Park your self by the lady who gives out the number and she will help you out.The kitchen is located behind the fish tanks. The  carts come out on the left side by the fish tanks.  If you are lucky enough to get seated in that general vicinity then you will have first crack at everything when it is piping hot.  The dim sum has got as much variety as any other place in the five boroughs.The cart ladies are very nice and it's easier to just have them show you what they have.  Dishes off the menu are also very good.The best thing about this place is the Chinatown prices.  I will wager anyone that if you stick to dim sum and you gorge yourself, you will be hard pressed to spend more than 20 bucks.Great value, this place gets 4 stars.",4.0
"As some have said earlier, this place has some of the best dim sum you will find in Brooklyn's Chinatown. Even though it is a bit off the beaten track, way up on 65th St. on the neighborhood's border, the extra time spent walking (or driving for those lucky few) will be well worth it once you are sitting comfortable and shouting out for another order of ha gao (steamed shrimp dumplings). This particular dim sum house was featured on Anthony Bordain's show ""No Reservations"" and the popularity of this spot amongst NYC foodies has been on the increase as of late (yeah, I've noticed some of you hipster infiltrators. Thanks a lot Bordain!).  So, no sleeping in on the weekend if you want a quick seat and getting right to flagging down those delicious carts zooming to and fro amongst a vibrant and animated crowd. Just don't be surprised if you have to race a little old lady to that cart for the last order of char siu boa, because she will win!After 10:30 the wait gets a bit crazy for groups larger than 2 and the scene borders on chaotic as the waiting crowd slowly works their way from the waiting area near the door, into the dining room beyond the host's stations (normally a line of demarkation of some sorts) and then right up behind/almost on top of tables of folks already seated.  Avoid the front few tables if possible, because I can guarantee that if you are there around 11am there will be a group of patrons-to-be hovering over you, staring into the dim sum horizon, hopelessly attempting to hawk down on opening seats.  Although this behavior obviously lacks class (and I still can't get over it regardless of how many times I've seen it happen), the neurotic crowd is a bit amusing to watch because they seem so freakin' stressed out by an experience that should be nothing but relaxing.   (I mean, come on, it's breakfast folks!)  Anyhow, management needs to do something about this and they could easily just ask the eager frontline to step away from the patrons' tables regardless of how much of a norm it has become amongst the crowd.  They LOSE A STAR over it.So, like most of the dim sum houses in the various NYC Chinatowns, get there early (don't complain if you can't find a seat when you show up at 11 on a Sunday), bring a group of people so you can order a bunch of different dishes (variety is the spice of life and the ticket to dim sum bliss), don't leave the appetite at home (in fact bring a little more if you got it in ya), and get yo yum cha on! You will not find MUCH better anywhere in the 5 boroughs.",3.0
"When I go to a dim sum restaurant, I am only concerned with eating three items.  They are:1.  Fried Turnip Cakes2.  Spring Rolls 3.  Noodled Fried CrullersYes, I enjoy eating fried foods... too much in fact.  This place has very good dim sum.  The shrimp hargows are plumpy and fresh.  Anyway, the rest of the dim sum fares well but not to the three main dishes that I've looking for. The Fried Turnip cakes are not made to order and the spring rolls are normally just lukewarm.  The noodled fried crullers are delicious and crispy though.  The rest of the dim sum is quite good, but I'm only there for my three things.         They have prompt service and flavorful jasmine tea.  I also ate here for dinner several times and I was not disappointed.  The fish, the lobster, the chicken were all very well-prepared.  The crispy chicken may have been a bit dry, but I forgive them.  Besides, they give you free melons and oranges after your dinner meal.  The seafood here is just fresh and excellent.  They have valet parking too!",4.0

I was right.  Although there were a few communication problems, the quality of the food we received was so good that I feel like I didn't deserve it.  I feel like I haven't accomplished enough in life to warrant the treat of being able to eat at a place like this.  They give you a yin-yang plate of yellow spicy sauce and red spicy sauce to mix in with your soy sauce.  It's the perfect combination.  The best things I tried here were the pork sticky buns, the shrimp dumplings, shrimp noodle, the siopao, the pork dumplings, and shrimp parsely noodle.  I tried a whole plethora of other dishes that I loved but can't explain since I had no idea what it was.  That's the only downside of this place.  You often will have to eat what you don't know because virtually nobody speaks English here.  But the quality of the food here would make Asian foodies around the world slobber with desire.",5.0

There was a vast variety of different types of food, soups and desert.

After the ceremonies, we mingled before the first courses of food were brought out to the tables.  Since this was a Chinese wedding, the food was brought out, served to us by a waiter and then the main plate, empty of food, was taken away. This went on for a long time as there was several courses of all different types of food.  Chicken, lobster, fruit, shark fin soup, fish, wedding cake and something else that I had no idea what it was.  Only downside was the bar, although it was open bar, they ran out of Jack Daniels and Johnny Walker before the night ended.

"Came here for brunch & dinner.With such varieties and filling portions, I don't think ""breakfast"" is used, hence brunch.There are many selections from meats, seafood, bread/pastries, fried goods, hot/cold desserts, and specialty dishes from the kitchen (10:30a and on; chefs need to arrive for these dishes).The carts pushing these selections are plentiful, but so is the crowd (especially during weekend brunch). My goodness, it's probably a fire hazard with that waiting spot/mob at the main entrance.

When you get there, just hope the group before you is ready to leave so you can satisfy your stomach at your time slot. Wait time for dishes is less than 15mins and platter sizes are usually large, unless requested.Overall, I am a fan. With varieties of foods and quick service, definitely coming back for more.

"Coming from California, finding a dim sum place in Brooklyn was one of my top priorities.  Now, most people I spoke with suggested I go into Manhattan, so you can imagine my delight when through Yelp, I learned about two places:  Pacificana and East Harbor.  For a long time, I would take my little troop of Dim Sum chompers (our 2.5 and 4 year old both love to goto yum cha) to Pacificana because of their fantastic Xiao Long Bao, until we tried out East Harbor.  Not only is it easier to park (they have a friendly garage), but there's just something about their variety and the tanks of fresh swimming fish in the back that the kids love to watch.  Don't miss out on the ""Cha Leung"" which is the rice noodled wrapped donut, and their stuffed eggplant with fish cake.  Make sure that it's one of those really fresh hot dishes that you'll see them carting out of the kitchen.  The kids really enjoy the shrimp rice noodles, and I think their house special noodles are some of the tastiest.I've brought my parents, when they're in town, to this place, and they claim that it's on par with some of the eateries in Hong Kong.  Since they both grew up there, who am I to argue their point?",5.0
"We didn't order from their menu so this review is just for the Dim Sum.  TIP: When it's busy, you're assigned a number when you walk in. They announce the numbers in Chinese as tables open up. Basically if you don't understand Chinese and miss your number... Well, you snooze you lose. Just make sure the person who gives you your number and the person announcing the numbers KNOWS you do not understand Chinese, make frequent eye contact and ask them to physically get you when your number is called. East Harbor Seafood Palace's Dim Sum is fantastic! Their dim sum variety is praiseworthy and the food caliber was some of the best I've had.  EHSP has dim sum from 9-4 pm everyday. I went on a Monday at 1PM and the place was PACKED, but luckily we were seated in 15 minutes. The dining room was a sea of Chinese people, not a single non-Asian in sight, so I knew I was in for a real treat. EHSP did not disappoint. The carts came around every 3~5 minutes, freshly cooked/baked/steamed/fried/deepfried, just heavenly goodness.  TIP: The place was half empty by 2pm and the carts came less frequently, so try to arrive before 1PM when there is a heavy cart rotation. The locals who eat here do not eat late, like most NY-ers.  I'm still in a food coma and can't remember all the dishes but here are the ones that blew me away. Both the pork and shrimp slippery pancakes were divine. (Ha Cheung in the pictures but when I ordered it, she tried to give me chicken feet...) Pork spareribs in black bean sauce was a mindbogglingly good, grabbed two. Deep fried sesame buns with pork(?) was so crispy, flaky, dense, flavorful, ugh, I need another one. The egg custard dessert was right out of the oven, warm, creamy, flaky... I want to go back already... My friend and I ended up getting 13 dishes. Our table buddies, a party of two & another party of two each had 4~5 dishes... We just couldn't stop... It was just... too good... (You will be sharing your table with a bunch of strangers, which is fun because you get to see what other ppl order. I saw a bunch of delicious looking mystery dishes.)For 13 dishes, the total bill was $37.90 w/o tip. Have one of the waiters tally your bill, leave the tip on the table, pay the bill at the register, and waddle back to the subway like an overstuffed penguin. TIP: There's a gigantic Chinese supermarket on the way back to the subway so if you need to walk and digest a bit, it's a fun place to explore.",5.0
"For ""yum cha"" (dim sum) and dinners, I've came here for about a dozen times already.

It's funny when I come here with a large group, yes we have this plan, where a few people get there early enough to get a ticket for a table and all. But the moment we sit down, it's like a race with all the dim sum cart ladies to see who can put their dishes down on our table the fastest. Our tea hasn't even arrived yet and bing, bang, boom our table is piled with dim sum. For dinner, we always do family style here. The food is great and the service is fast.

"I thank my picky grandmother for making me the the dim sum snob that I am. There are only a handful of places that does chinese breakfast & brunch right, and this is one of them. Their scallion churn fun is one of the best around; they are usually only made if you place an order with one of the waiters and not with the dimsum cart ladies. If you plan to order a special dish, a fan favorite is their seafood chow mein. There is one thing you must prepare for though. It gets PACKED during the weekends and certain holidays.

"Trusting Robert Sietsma of the Village Voice is usually a pretfy safe bet but after going to East Harbor I think I'd better just ignore him when he writes about dim sum.  I was really disappointed by East Harbor, it ranked up there with any typical dium sum place that you just walk into randomly.  You might like it if you'd never had dim sum before but in NYC it's really a travesty to waste your time eating substandard dim sum when there are sooo many really stellar options.Enough complaining, let me explain why I didn't care for their food. There was a tangible lack of freshness in all the fillings which left me feeling like every new dish was the same as the last.  The dumpling wrappers were heavy and doughy.  My friend and I got filled up really quickly from all that starch, not from what was inside.  Service was decent enough but the food was really so disappointing that I really doubt that I would bother going back to give East Harbor a second chance.  It wasn't bad just not worth the trip to Sunset Park; I'll head out to Flushing or Elmhurst instead.The night after I went here I watched Tony Bourdain on No Reservations, raving about this place. WTF, Tony?!  You've had dim sum in Hong Kong and you actually liked THIS place?  I have to assume that you were just being polite or they drugged you. Jeeeeez!",3.0
"I trekked it here from Bed-Stuy on a saturday to have their dim-sum. I have great dim-sum here in Southern California, but I rarely see dim-sum anymore in bamboo steamers like this place does. So for nostalgia sake, I went. We get there during the last hour of dim-sum, so it was slim pickings at that point but what we did have was delicious. The shrimp noodles, the chinese brocolli, spare ribs, har gow, shomai, siopao, soup dumplings, lotus leaf rice, and sesame balls were all tasty.

"Took a day off to spend time with my family so we thought about having dim sum but where.  My mom told me that a lot of her friends came here to have dim sum and they like it but just a little expensive.  Hey, I go anywhere to try delicious food so I came here.  The dim sums were very fresh and taste very good.  My all time favorite is the steamed mini pork with bones over rice in a ceramic bowl.  I gotta have that.  Very yummy and it just brings back memories when me and my family used to go to Silver Palace in Chinatown to have this it.  The waiter/waitress came to check if our teapot still have tea which normally no one does unless you have the cover open and he/she tried to change our plates but we asked not to because we were about to leave.    Service was good probably because it is Friday.Hope to come back again with my family and friends.",3.0
"Coming from California, finding a dim sum place in Brooklyn was one of my top priorities.  Now, most people I spoke with suggested I go into Manhattan, so you can imagine my delight when through Yelp, I learned about two places:  Pacificana and East Harbor.  For a long time, I would take my little troop of Dim Sum chompers (our 2.5 and 4 year old both love to goto yum cha) to Pacificana because of their fantastic Xiao Long Bao, until we tried out East Harbor.  Not only is it easier to park (they have a friendly garage), but there's just something about their variety and the tanks of fresh swimming fish in the back that the kids love to watch.  Don't miss out on the ""Cha Leung"" which is the rice noodled wrapped donut, and their stuffed eggplant with fish cake.  Make sure that it's one of those really fresh hot dishes that you'll see them carting out of the kitchen.  The kids really enjoy the shrimp rice noodles, and I think their house special noodles are some of the tastiest.I've brought my parents, when they're in town, to this place, and they claim that it's on par with some of the eateries in Hong Kong.  Since they both grew up there, who am I to argue their point?",5.0
"We didn't order from their menu so this review is just for the Dim Sum.  TIP: When it's busy, you're assigned a number when you walk in. They announce the numbers in Chinese as tables open up. Basically if you don't understand Chinese and miss your number... Well, you snooze you lose. Just make sure the person who gives you your number and the person announcing the numbers KNOWS you do not understand Chinese, make frequent eye contact and ask them to physically get you when your number is called. East Harbor Seafood Palace's Dim Sum is fantastic! Their dim sum variety is praiseworthy and the food caliber was some of the best I've had.  EHSP has dim sum from 9-4 pm everyday. I went on a Monday at 1PM and the place was PACKED, but luckily we were seated in 15 minutes. The dining room was a sea of Chinese people, not a single non-Asian in sight, so I knew I was in for a real treat. EHSP did not disappoint. The carts came around every 3~5 minutes, freshly cooked/baked/steamed/fried/deepfried, just heavenly goodness.  TIP: The place was half empty by 2pm and the carts came less frequently, so try to arrive before 1PM when there is a heavy cart rotation. The locals who eat here do not eat late, like most NY-ers.  I'm still in a food coma and can't remember all the dishes but here are the ones that blew me away. Both the pork and shrimp slippery pancakes were divine. (Ha Cheung in the pictures but when I ordered it, she tried to give me chicken feet...) Pork spareribs in black bean sauce was a mindbogglingly good, grabbed two. Deep fried sesame buns with pork(?) was so crispy, flaky, dense, flavorful, ugh, I need another one. The egg custard dessert was right out of the oven, warm, creamy, flaky... I want to go back already... My friend and I ended up getting 13 dishes. Our table buddies, a party of two & another party of two each had 4~5 dishes... We just couldn't stop... It was just... too good... (You will be sharing your table with a bunch of strangers, which is fun because you get to see what other ppl order. I saw a bunch of delicious looking mystery dishes.)For 13 dishes, the total bill was $37.90 w/o tip. Have one of the waiters tally your bill, leave the tip on the table, pay the bill at the register, and waddle back to the subway like an overstuffed penguin. TIP: There's a gigantic Chinese supermarket on the way back to the subway so if you need to walk and digest a bit, it's a fun place to explore.",5.0
"For ""yum cha"" (dim sum) and dinners, I've came here for about a dozen times already. My family loves coming here, my friends too, my neighbors as well, hell probably the whole Brooklyn population comes here for dim sum. Always so crowded and bustling with people. It's funny when I come here with a large group, yes we have this plan, where a few people get there early enough to get a ticket for a table and all. But the moment we sit down, it's like a race with all the dim sum cart ladies to see who can put their dishes down on our table the fastest. Our tea hasn't even arrived yet and bing, bang, boom our table is piled with dim sum. For dinner, we always do family style here. The food is great and the service is fast. Also, they have parking valet, but their parking area isn't that big. But with the location of this restaurant, it's pretty easy finding parking in the area.",5.0
"My friend had his wedding reception here-- the food was excellent and i thought the staff did a tremendous job getting everything out on time, despite some issues with time (though unrelated to the restaurant).  There is a parking lot, but it's really small.

"East Harbor Seafood Palace, Featured on Anthony Bourdain's ""No Reservations""!We heard about this BK dim sum restaurant because it was featured on ""No Reservations"" special on NYC's outer boroughs:travelchannel.com/TV_Sho…The dim sum was excellent (it rivals that of Dong Yi Feng [formerly Tung Yi Fung] and Ocean Jewel in Flushing, Queens).  They have their own parking lot (it's small), and is located very close to the BK Chinatown (great for post-meal grocery shopping), but is really popular (long wait).",4.0
"I thank my picky grandmother for making me the the dim sum snob that I am. There are only a handful of places that does chinese breakfast & brunch right, and this is one of them. Their scallion churn fun is one of the best around; they are usually only made if you place an order with one of the waiters and not with the dimsum cart ladies. If you plan to order a special dish, a fan favorite is their seafood chow mein. There is one thing you must prepare for though. It gets PACKED during the weekends and certain holidays. You will most likely end up waiting unless you have some uncanny charm on the host or hostess. So don't become distraught by the wait, you're about to have some awesome (and cheap) food.",4.0
"Trusting Robert Sietsma of the Village Voice is usually a pretfy safe bet but after going to East Harbor I think I'd better just ignore him when he writes about dim sum.  I was really disappointed by East Harbor, it ranked up there with any typical dium sum place that you just walk into randomly.  You might like it if you'd never had dim sum before but in NYC it's really a travesty to waste your time eating substandard dim sum when there are sooo many really stellar options.Enough complaining, let me explain why I didn't care for their food. There was a tangible lack of freshness in all the fillings which left me feeling like every new dish was the same as the last.  The dumpling wrappers were heavy and doughy.  My friend and I got filled up really quickly from all that starch, not from what was inside.  Service was decent enough but the food was really so disappointing that I really doubt that I would bother going back to give East Harbor a second chance.  It wasn't bad just not worth the trip to Sunset Park; I'll head out to Flushing or Elmhurst instead.The night after I went here I watched Tony Bourdain on No Reservations, raving about this place. WTF, Tony?!  You've had dim sum in Hong Kong and you actually liked THIS place?  I have to assume that you were just being polite or they drugged you. Jeeeeez!",3.0
"I trekked it here from Bed-Stuy on a saturday to have their dim-sum. I have great dim-sum here in Southern California, but I rarely see dim-sum anymore in bamboo steamers like this place does.

The shrimp noodles, the chinese brocolli, spare ribs, har gow, shomai, siopao, soup dumplings, lotus leaf rice, and sesame balls were all tasty.

"I have only eaten there only dinner time, but whenever I am in a Chinese Seafood mood, I pick this place. Their seafood selection is awesome and very fresh. I always get geoduck clam dish. They can do Sashimi or cook with ginger and scallions which I love. So far this is the freshest geoduck clam in New York now. Also their whole fish dish is not so greasy compare to other Chinese places. But if you like to have the fresh whole fish, I recommend that to be steamed instead of deep fried. (its just that I usually order fried appetizers so I avoid too much fried stuff) They steam it perfectly, not over cooked, you can taste the tenderness of the fish, with light soy sauce based sauce with scallions. For rice dishes, I have to be honest... I am not so crazy about their fried rice. They don't have enough seasoning. I'd rather get the noodle dish. Service is surprisingly good!!

"Unless you come here on the weekdays, don't expect to get seated immediately. It gets insanely packed on Sunday mornings and the wait can be anywhere from an hour to even two hours. With that said, I normally come here on the weekdays for dinner. There's no wait and you can sit comfortably for a while without anyone bothering you. On Saturday and Sunday nights, there's usually some sort of wedding reception or some other celebration so there's either no tables or you have to deal with a bunch of screaming kids/super loud wedding DJ. The dim sum is worth trying out though. I've been to tons of Chinese restaurants for dim sum and this place is pretty damn good. They've got lots of variety and the food is always fresh. I love their spring rolls, the turnip cake, the glutinous rice cakes, and the rice noodle rolls. Also, the waiters/waitresses speak very little English.

"I came here Easter Sunday for dim sum lunch with my girls.  The line was out the door, which is always a great sign.  I squeezed my way to the host stand to get a number, while my friends were finding a parking spot.  Then as I was waiting, I began to hear numbers being called in Cantonese.  I grew up in San Francisco, so I know very basic Cantonese.  I knew how to count from one to ten, but nothing past ten.  As I was standing there going over the numbers in my head, I was beginning to understand what numbers were being called.  They were in the 70s.  Then I panicked, my number was 102!  I didn't know how to say 100 in Cantonese!  Basically, the way they say 70, 82, etc. is seven ten and eight ten two.  So I wasn't sure if they would say ten ten or if there was another word for that.  I asked a Chinese boy that was standing nearby how to say 102, but he said he didn't know.  So, I went up to the host and asked her how to say 102 in Cantonese.   She looked at me like I was crazy and said, ""102.""  So, I repeated myself and her facial expression did not change.  She said ""102 in English.""  I said, ""I know, but how do you say it in Cantonese.""  Then with an even more annoyed looked she repeated herself and pointed to the ""e"" next to 102 on her list.  Ohhhhhh....my bad.  So, I walked away and continued waiting.When our number was called we were so excited.  It felt like we were all playing BINGO.  We waited for over 30 minutes and were starving by then.  We were on a mission as soon as we were seated, stopping each cart to check out the goods.  We were ordering one plate after another.  The cart people were actually really nice and patient.  None of us are Chinese and I only knew the names of the dishes I liked.  The family that we shared a table with could not stop staring and laughing at us.  All three of us have not had dim sum in a long time; one of my friends gave up Chinese food for lent.  So, you could imagine the commotion going on at our table.  We just kept eating and eating.  We sat through three rotations, we saw three different groups of people share the table with us!  The amount of stamps on our check was impressive for three people, it was more than the family of 5.  The food was good, although I waited forever for the chive dumplings (that's my favorite) to finally make its round.  Try their tofu-fa, its in this barrel/basket looking thing.  Really fresh and light way to end the meal.(By the way, I still don't know how to say 102 in Cantonese and haven't gotten around to asking my friends back in SF.)",5.0

"When you party hardy Friday night and Saturday night...there is NOTHING in the world like a healthy portion of dim sum to help you detox on Sunday.  And that is EXACTLY how it worked out this past weekend.I was actually all the way out in Long Beach to experience DJ Eloy's debut in Long beach the night before, and as a result of the debauchery, we all needed decent food to help us recoup from the damage.So we did some research Sunday noon time (Google / Yelp...WE HEART THEE!).  And given it was already noon time, the trick was to find dim sum service past 3 pm, considering travel time as well.  And this is when we found East Harbor Seafood Palace.  They serve dim sum until 4 pm, and the reviews were above average.  And given that we did not want to drive all the way back to Manhattan, Brooklyn was a good second option.  Score.So...after fighting a little traffic...we got to the place.  As we arrived, we noticed a bit of departing crowd...mostly Chinese.  That's ALWAYS a good sign.  Trust me...us Chinese don't mess with our dim sum!Once seated, we started ordering everything that came our way.  Shrimp Dumplings, Shui Mai, turnip cakes, you name it.  It was all very good.  The only thing that was a bit sub par?  The congee.    You can tell it's been sitting in that cart for a bit.  The other thing that was a bit disappointing?  Because it was already 3 pm, they ran out of some of my favorite fried dim sum dishes (fried taro dumplings, for example).Lesson learned?  Go much earlier next time.  I am sure the food is excellent earlier that day.  And from the view of it, the dinner menu looked authentically amazing as well.My friends Paul and Kimmie will definitely be planning a dinner soiree there some time soon!",4.0

Don't order the peking duck, you can get it better from elsewhere (Peking Duck House in Chinatown) but they do the cool cutting the duck in front of your table thing. The lamb chops are also delicious and cooked until juicy and tender. Though there's free parking, the garage is usually full so you'll have to drive around looking for street parking. During busy times, be prepared to wait at least 10 minutes.",5.0
"My family has come here a couple of times for dinner.  Call ahead to make reservations.  There is free valet parking - which is great because it typically takes us forever to find parking in Brooklyn.  This restaurant is pretty big and great for group dinners and big parties.  The service is very quick and the food is decent.  I wouldn't say it's FANTASTIC, so it only gets three stars.  There are tvs mounted on the walls everywhere, so it can be kind of distracting.  If you have a find a place for a family dinner in a pinch, East Harbor is pretty trusty.  I have yet to find a chinese restaurant in NYC that I really love.  I am convinced that SF has better chinese restaurants.",3.0
"This is the best dim sum restaurant ever and the only place I prefer to go!  No joke.  If you think Chinatown dim sum is good, my god.  YOU ARE MISSING OUT and YOU ARE BEING OVER CHARGED!  The food at East Harbor Seafood Palace is way better and the prices are decent.  There are more dim sums and varieties.  The restaurant gives off a comfortable feel and is neatly decorated.  This restaurant is hugeee and the lighting is just right.  In addition, they have valet parking!!!  However, there is a need to wait most of the time.  It is still beats looking for a parking spot.  A MUST GO!!",5.0
"WOW! Haven't had Cantonese food this good for a while.The ""chow mai fun"" was a real standout amongst the many dishes we ordered for dinner.  Served very fresh, and the noodles were kind of ""fluffy"".  Normally, they are a little soggy, and a little oily.  You have to try them to see what I'm talking about.Service is quite good, and that's quite a compliment as service in most NYC Chinese restaurants range from bad to merely acceptable.It's a fairly new restaurant in town (~Fall 2008).  Looks like it can seat 500 ppl over 50 large tables. Tastefully decorated throughout its spacious interior (except for the multiple LCD screens scattered about).  Friendly and attentive staff.  Valet parking available for small number of cars.  Street parking is plentiful, but can still be hard to find.Every Asian in NYC seems to converge at this new place, so be prepared for  long waits.  Believe it or not, they've been bursting at the seams every night.  DON'T EVEN THINK of coming here on the weekends without a plan (ie- take a number and go shopping for about an hour or more).",4.0
"If you want to eat good Cantonese food, this is the place to go.  They have both big and small tables and their decor is modern and not tacky.  It's very spacious and you will not feel cramped in there as you would in other restaurants.  The waiters are nice and service is good.  Should you choose to have dim sum here, make sure you go there early.  There is a long wait just to get a table.  Dinner gets very packed as well - so make sure you make reservations if you're going with a big party or if you are going on a holiday.If this helps at all, this is where I will have my wedding reception.  :)",5.0
"Unless you come here on the weekdays, don't expect to get seated immediately. It gets insanely packed on Sunday mornings and the wait can be anywhere from an hour to even two hours. With that said, I normally come here on the weekdays for dinner. There's no wait and you can sit comfortably for a while without anyone bothering you. On Saturday and Sunday nights, there's usually some sort of wedding reception or some other celebration so there's either no tables or you have to deal with a bunch of screaming kids/super loud wedding DJ. The dim sum is worth trying out though. I've been to tons of Chinese restaurants for dim sum and this place is pretty damn good. They've got lots of variety and the food is always fresh. I love their spring rolls, the turnip cake, the glutinous rice cakes, and the rice noodle rolls. Also, the waiters/waitresses speak very little English. Not a big deal for me since I speak Cantonese, but if you don't speak Chinese, ordering can be difficult.",4.0
"Seriously the best tea parlor around. Totally beats the one down the block. They have a place for parking but it gets extremely crowded during the weekend. The wait can take a long time. The staff can be friendly, depends. I really would eat everything they have to offer because I can't find any place else that makes the food as good. If you're a regular, they recognize you and often take off the price of the tea and give you free coffee. Oh they even have VIP rooms but it makes me feel more secluded. Get there early.",5.0
"I came here Easter Sunday for dim sum lunch with my girls.  The line was out the door, which is always a great sign.  I squeezed my way to the host stand to get a number, while my friends were finding a parking spot.  Then as I was waiting, I began to hear numbers being called in Cantonese.  I grew up in San Francisco, so I know very basic Cantonese.  I knew how to count from one to ten, but nothing past ten.  As I was standing there going over the numbers in my head, I was beginning to understand what numbers were being called.  They were in the 70s.  Then I panicked, my number was 102!  I didn't know how to say 100 in Cantonese!  Basically, the way they say 70, 82, etc. is seven ten and eight ten two.  So I wasn't sure if they would say ten ten or if there was another word for that.  I asked a Chinese boy that was standing nearby how to say 102, but he said he didn't know.  So, I went up to the host and asked her how to say 102 in Cantonese.   She looked at me like I was crazy and said, ""102.""  So, I repeated myself and her facial expression did not change.  She said ""102 in English.""  I said, ""I know, but how do you say it in Cantonese.""  Then with an even more annoyed looked she repeated herself and pointed to the ""e"" next to 102 on her list.  Ohhhhhh....my bad.  So, I walked away and continued waiting.When our number was called we were so excited.  It felt like we were all playing BINGO.  We waited for over 30 minutes and were starving by then.  We were on a mission as soon as we were seated, stopping each cart to check out the goods.  We were ordering one plate after another.  The cart people were actually really nice and patient.  None of us are Chinese and I only knew the names of the dishes I liked.  The family that we shared a table with could not stop staring and laughing at us.  All three of us have not had dim sum in a long time; one of my friends gave up Chinese food for lent.  So, you could imagine the commotion going on at our table.  We just kept eating and eating.  We sat through three rotations, we saw three different groups of people share the table with us!  The amount of stamps on our check was impressive for three people, it was more than the family of 5.  The food was good, although I waited forever for the chive dumplings (that's my favorite) to finally make its round.  Try their tofu-fa, its in this barrel/basket looking thing.  Really fresh and light way to end the meal.(By the way, I still don't know how to say 102 in Cantonese and haven't gotten around to asking my friends back in SF.)",5.0
"close to the N/R stops, this place is worth the hike from manhattan.the wait was long on a sunday, but the table turnover is high so the line moves fast. that also means the food carts keep coming and the food is hot! some of the best of my favorites: chives + shrimp pan-fried dumplings, fried cruller cheong fun, egg custard.... our egg custards were steaming!will definitely be returning.",5.0
"When you party hardy Friday night and Saturday night...there is NOTHING in the world like a healthy portion of dim sum to help you detox on Sunday.  And that is EXACTLY how it worked out this past weekend.I was actually all the way out in Long Beach to experience DJ Eloy's debut in Long beach the night before, and as a result of the debauchery, we all needed decent food to help us recoup from the damage.So we did some research Sunday noon time (Google / Yelp...WE HEART THEE!).  And given it was already noon time, the trick was to find dim sum service past 3 pm, considering travel time as well.  And this is when we found East Harbor Seafood Palace.  They serve dim sum until 4 pm, and the reviews were above average.  And given that we did not want to drive all the way back to Manhattan, Brooklyn was a good second option.  Score.So...after fighting a little traffic...we got to the place.  As we arrived, we noticed a bit of departing crowd...mostly Chinese.  That's ALWAYS a good sign.  Trust me...us Chinese don't mess with our dim sum!Once seated, we started ordering everything that came our way.  Shrimp Dumplings, Shui Mai, turnip cakes, you name it.  It was all very good.  The only thing that was a bit sub par?  The congee.    You can tell it's been sitting in that cart for a bit.  The other thing that was a bit disappointing?  Because it was already 3 pm, they ran out of some of my favorite fried dim sum dishes (fried taro dumplings, for example).Lesson learned?  Go much earlier next time.  I am sure the food is excellent earlier that day.  And from the view of it, the dinner menu looked authentically amazing as well.My friends Paul and Kimmie will definitely be planning a dinner soiree there some time soon!",4.0

Also, don't make eye-contact with the push-cart ladies if you're not interested in eating any more; they will make a beeline for you and try to sell whatever they have.The usual favourites are there: har gow (steamed shrimp dumplings), siu mai (steamed pork & mushroom bites), har cheong (shrimp wrapped in steamed rice noodle wrappers), etc; but last time, our dining companions we'd shared our table with had ordered what looked like an expanded nor mai kai (glutinous rice with meat and eggs, steamed in a lotus leaf wrapper).

"We are Asia and my husband is from Hong Kong, who love real Hong Kong food.  But this place is OK for whoever looking for real good Dim Sum.First, this place is not clean which is not unexpected as a typical Hong Kong style restaurant.  The local people recommends this place since we are not familiar with China Town in NYC.  We were there for lunch on Saturday, 9/16/2011 and waited for less 10 minutes to be seated.  My husband and I were sitting with other 2 groups in one table, one group is one people, another group is two people.  We don't mind since we already get used such style.  The waiters are also very in Hong Kong style, rush, rush and rush as all you notice.  Again, we already get used that.  Who cares as long as the food is good.  But the food is OK, my disappointment is they don't have many variety dishes in such big restaurant.  We live in Northern Virginia and I would say Mark's Duck House (maybe only 1/3 size of Grand Harmony) in Falls Church has a lot more variety dishes than Grand Harmony.  Another important element of Dim Sum is the TEA!  I don't think their tea is good and that impacts the taste of the food too.  So Dim Sum restaurant owners, please be aware of the quality of tea too.  The price is not expensive, but I would rather than paying a bit more to get better food.  I think this place is crowded only because there are just so many local people to want to have weekend Dim Sum.",2.0
"I almost exploded here on Sunday. When I gulped down some water, the liquid filled all available space in my stomach and the glutinous rice expanded.

We only had to wait 10 minutes for our table just before noon, even though we had a party of 10 that wasn't all there yet. The last two came no more than 5 minutes after we were seated. I think the announcer only called out the numbers in Cantonese so better take Canto lesson 105: At the Restaurant, or you might get screwed. Either that or wave down the announcer so at least he knows what number you are and to call out the English when he gets to you. We stayed for almost two hours and weren't hassled at all by the wait staff to hurry on, although there were a good amount of people waiting. The staff asked if we wanted our check after we finished the savory portion of our meal, we said no and proceeded to order every dessert they had. Favorite dishes here include the giant plate of ho fun with beef, scallion and bean sprouts, which fed all 10 of us and then some for less than $10, water chestnut glutinous cake, crispy tofu skin rolls, egg tarts, pea shoots with garlic, superior soup with dumplings and bbq beef rice noodle rolls. We mostly ordered the standards; we will have to return and ask them if they have special items I've mostly only seen on the West Coast (holla!) or Asia (herro!), like ""leaking sand"" buns and baked pudding with lotus paste (we asked and they did not have this). After packing up our leftovers, including a portion of pig's blood that my friends were taking back to their sickly, anemic cat, we rolled out into the rain, eager to return.",4.0

I went along with it and really enjoyed my meal, although I kind of expected some white rice or something with it...I guess I had to ask. But basically the dish was ALL CLAMS with just sauce all over them. which means more bang for your buck. Weird thing was I finished the whole plate, even after having an appetizer, which...never happens.Dim sum deluxe was...kind of boring.Other person with me ordered some kind of fried rice that they ended up dumping sesame seeds all over even though we stated that due to my allergy we'd like no sesame on the dish. oh well. minus a star for that.Seriously solid place for some good Chinese food in the area though. Not the cheapest, but your meal will be minimal amounts filler and high quality, so it kind of pays off.",4.0
"Really, fellow Yelpers? Four stars? No effin' way. The dim sum is limp, lukewarm, and not that tasty. If you're craving something resembling siu mai, it does the trick, I guess. But so does a trip to the frozen food aisle at any Chinese supermarket.",2.0
My favorite dim sum place! Their spare ribs has PUMPKIN in it! I LOVEEEE pumpkin. I come here just to get that plate of dim sum. mMmm goodness. And their phoenix claw/feet is amazing too. I want some right now.... 4 stars because their dinner isn't amazing just their dimsum for me.,4.0
"Going to this place was an adventure.  Barely anyone spoke English, Chinese soap operas played on the flat screen tvs, and the servers wore what looked like flight attendant uniforms.  I was one of a very few non-Asians, I can't say for sure what I ate, since we got no menus and the servers couldn't understand us, but it all tasted good, and I'd go back in a second.",4.0
"Long lineup, but well worth the wait. I've been twice, and had to wait around an hour for a table both times. Perhaps it'll be less crowded if you go at 10:00am or 2:00pm. So far, it's the best Dim Sum I've had in the United States. Obviously not comparable to HK or Toronto, as some have said here, but pretty good and authentic and traditional. The service is that of a regular Chinese restaurant, although the time I went with non-Asians, they did give us a bigger table, bonus points!",4.0
"We are Asia and my husband is from Hong Kong, who love real Hong Kong food.  But this place is OK for whoever looking for real good Dim Sum.First, this place is not clean which is not unexpected as a typical Hong Kong style restaurant.  The local people recommends this place since we are not familiar with China Town in NYC.  We were there for lunch on Saturday, 9/16/2011 and waited for less 10 minutes to be seated.  My husband and I were sitting with other 2 groups in one table, one group is one people, another group is two people.  We don't mind since we already get used such style.  The waiters are also very in Hong Kong style, rush, rush and rush as all you notice.  Again, we already get used that.  Who cares as long as the food is good.  But the food is OK, my disappointment is they don't have many variety dishes in such big restaurant.  We live in Northern Virginia and I would say Mark's Duck House (maybe only 1/3 size of Grand Harmony) in Falls Church has a lot more variety dishes than Grand Harmony.  Another important element of Dim Sum is the TEA!  I don't think their tea is good and that impacts the taste of the food too.  So Dim Sum restaurant owners, please be aware of the quality of tea too.  The price is not expensive, but I would rather than paying a bit more to get better food.  I think this place is crowded only because there are just so many local people to want to have weekend Dim Sum.",2.0

"Let me start with WTF! I've probably ate here more than five times and have to say every time it gets worst. It seems like the amount of food gets less and less every time. My guess is either they try to make up for the increase in food cost or because they thought my table was full of young adults that we wouldn't be able to tell the difference or too stupid to realize that we're get ramp up the rear-end.  I really have to add and its not just here but every dine-in restaurant, the man or woman with the tie always tried to push you to order something ridiculously expensive. And I know they use the bait and switch on my dungeness crab which cost $55, WTF!",1.0
