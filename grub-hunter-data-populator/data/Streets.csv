"Only came for brunch one Sunday but it was SO AMAZINGI ordered the Costa Rican breakfast ($16) and I was full for the rest of the day. The dish came with plantain, scrambled eggs, I added shrimp to the meal but you can also add either steak or chicken I believe, rice and beans and I don't even remember what else but it was WELL worth the money.I also recommend the sorrel mimosa!",5.0
"This was the first time that I dined out as a pescatarian. I have been to Streets BK plenty of times before my diet change and  I enjoyed their food. I remembered they had a vegetarian section on the menu and wanted my Bf (who is a vegetarian) to experience this restaurant.I ordered the shark sandwich. The sandwich looked and smelled SO good, my bf had to turn away. The shark had coleslaw that came with it and I poured tamarind sauce over it...I was talking about this sandwich for days. I'm not sure what my Bf ordered from the vegetarian option, but it came with plantain chips ( that i took off his plate) that I thought was perfect! I ordered additional plantain chips. He was not pleased with the vegetarian options though, he said the descriptions didn't sound appealing. We asked the waitress for assistance and she explained that the option he was looking at would come out looking like an appetizer. He ordered It anyway and was hungry an hour later.I am always pleased when I dine at Streets BK. I come with my parents and brother who also enjoy it, as they rave about the Mexican corn, the coconut brown rice and wings, to name a few and we always come back. My bf would just wish they had better choices for vegetarians.",5.0
"Got invited here by a friend... surprise surprise!  The food here is amazing!  I had zero expectations when I arrived as I had never heard of the spot... but now that I've been I will definitely be back.The location is off the beaten path (basically under the Williamsburg Bridge on the BK side), but I drive so GPS got me there pretty quickly.  Parking is limited so beware.  Once inside, the spot is nice... not great, but nice.  We went for Sunday brunch so it was not very crowded.  Service was fast and good.  Everything me and my brunch date ate was good.  We sampled each other's food and agreed that the chef obviously had magical powers as literally everything tasted good.  I can't remember everything we ordered, but we each ordered three things... again... all good.  I DEFINITELY recommend this place.  It's great for a first date... or any date... or if you're just hungry!  Kudos STREETS!  You have a new fan!",5.0
"I have been so excited to try this place since I have seen Chef Roble on The Chew many times. Well I finally dragged two friends with me and we came here.We had a drink at the bar and the drinks were really good and strong the way I like them. As we were ready to go to our table and wanted to pay for our drinks they told us the tab would just transfer to our table. I really loved that and I wish more restaurants would do that.We decided to start with three appetizer (mini shark, Mexican corn and wings). All three were good but not amazing, I was expecting amazing after all the great reviews.Now for my entrée I got the snapper in a plantain leaf with mashed sweet plantains. I have to say the best part of my meal were the mash plantains since the fish was very bland.Maybe my expectations were too high coming here.",3.0
"Since all the other reviews pretty much sum things up here I'll make this one brief. I had this bookmarked a long time ago and came here I believe in December but didn't have any food so I didn't leave a review.My date and I had the ""two way street"" tapas. We were quite upset that the trini corn soup wasn't available but no one's here to cry over spilled milk. With that said. my tapas meal included the peri peri wings, thai duck salad, and the bake and shark. Meanwhile, my date had the Sicilian arancini, bake and shark, and the doubles. I keep saying this to myself but I REALLY need to stop coming into places with these expectations which only stemmed from reading other reviews (however, this is quite natural).People raved about them peri peri wings and I was so mad I could throw them. Nothing special at all about those damn wings. BUTTTTTT...believe me when I say the highlight of our meals was the bake and shark...VERY GOOD! I can still remember the thai duck salad as well which I could go back for.4 stars because this place has an awesome interior design and is very clean, the service is good, and the drinks are delicious. The food is nothing to complain about if you come in with an open mind and ready to eat some street food. I can honestly come back here over and over again.Sorry not as short as I thought it would be.",4.0
"Love everything about this place!  It's spacious and beautifully designed.  The service was A1.  I started off with the tequila cocktail they had on the menu, which was made with apple and spiced rim.  It's my new favorite cocktail.  We started off with the Tapas Two Street, which is a sample size of the more popular items.  The Peri Peri Wings were my favorite!  Full of flavor and spice.  The Chicharrones was good, but a little too salty for my taste.  The Thai Duck Salad was also a nice fresh change from the rest.  We then got the Mariscadas, which is a big pot of seafood (mussels, crab, shrimp, squid).  It was flavorful, but definitely recommend getting some kind of rice with it- as it is a soupy dish.  However, we got the fries.  They were just OK.We finished up with the cheesecake empanadas.  SO delicious!  I will definitely be back for more!!!",4.0
"Yesterday I visited this gem in Williamsburg and I enjoyed the food a great deal! I ordered the Colombian breakfast with steak and it was delish. The food presentation was different and quite impressive. I also ordered a drink called Pain Killer. They should call it ""Sneak up on ya!"" because that's what it actually did. I can't wait to come here again to try yet another dish.",5.0
"I am so surprised this place doesn't have more reviews! The first time my boyfriend mentioned this place and told me ""it's a restaurant with different types of street food"" I was not excited. Little did I know this would be one of the best culinary experiences I've ever had. Everything was so good. Everything is shareable in my opinion. We got the doubles, Peri peri wings, Mexican corn (which they cut in half to be shared) and the chicken. My favorite were the wings. Perfectly seasoned and crispy. For dessert we got this cupcake in a jar with Jameson custard and baileys whipped cream. And dear god, it was heaven in my mouth! If you're looking for a cute date night idea, this is definitely a go to spot!",5.0

Not impressed.  Went here because my friend told me they were okay and The only thing I liked was the doubles. My daughter had the jerk pork and only liked the plantains.  The corn soup given to me was cold and had to be sent back. It was in a small stupid wooden thingy. The pina colada wasn't good either.  Left still feeling hungry. Soooo disappointed and unsatisfied. Wasted my Sunday night.,2.0
"A good friend of mine brought me here for lunch this afternoon and I was completely blown away. Everything from the friendly service, industrial/hip interior decór, impressive and interesting list of cocktails, beers and wines right down to the exquisiteness and yumminess of the food. The entire dining experience was sublime. The design in particular is a unique blend of upscale, industrial Brooklyn chíc with a touch of rustic elements displayed by wood paneling and wicker chairs scattered throughout. It served as a warm balance juxtaposed with the exposed beams, ceiling pipes and concrete columns. We felt that the beverages served in mason jars added charm and elegance to the experience. I really adored the eclectic design and vibe of the space in general. I checked in on on Yelp and no sooner did our conscientious server bring us cheese stuffed Brazilian bread. It was warm, soft, chewy, heavenly goodness. We ordered the Peri Peri Wings which were scrumptious; the Thai Duck salad which was a harmony between refreshing, light and flavorful balanced with crispy Duck; finally the Cachapa: essentially a sweet/salty corn cake filled with mozzarella cheese served with a side of maple syrup and butter. They were like velvet.  To drink I had the seasonal IPA (on tap) and my friend ordered the Mezcal Libation (a delicious, spicy tequila.)  We agreed that the adult beverages only added to the experience and complimented the flavors of the food. We balanced out the meal with a four layered dessert that consisted of chocolate cake, vanilla creme, more chocolate and a marscapone-like creme layer on top. I'd highly recommend Streets as a date-night spot for dinner or a small outing with a group of friends. I look forward to coming back and trying more items from the menu.",5.0
"Reservations for 8 made through opentable. Maitre d was very accommodating, and let us sit a partial party. Only 7 of us showed up, maybe because it was a late reservation and there weren't many customers. The place was very nice and so were the employees. Once again, I may attribute this to the establishment not being crowded, but whatever. The food was awesome. No one in my party spoke after the food came out. No need to talk during business time. This was a very rewarding culinary experience and there is no doubt I will be visiting here again. 5 Stars!!!!!",5.0
"Came here for my birthday and had a very nice evening.  The restaurant itself is very cool. We started with a trio of appetizers on one place. The appetizers included the peri wings, Mexican corn and the shark and bake. All were very good although I was not as excited about the corn. The shark and bake was delicious especially the dipping sauce that was served with it. For entrees we went in opposite directions. I had the steamed fish in the banana leaf which was to die for! I could not get enough!  We also had the jerk pork. I can tell why it's one of their best dishes! It was yummy. We also had a free margarita for check in. But had to try their signature drinks. Painkiller and blackberry lemonade. Both good. Ended my meal with a birthday cake. It was pretty but a little dense for my liking. Overall this would have been a four star experience. Service was pretty decent until the end. They could not figure out how to use our gift certificate to pay for the meal. I was exhausted at this time and it took them an additional half an hour to figure out that they did not have the capacity to use their own gift certificate. Our server came to us to tell us that they were working on it and finally the manager came over to help resolve it.  Not the best ending to our otherwise lovely evening.",3.0

"I took my best friend here to celebrate her birthday because she wanted to dine here based on prior reviews. I am not sure about most but when I walk into an establishment, the décor plays a major role in setting the tone. I must say that the lighting and table layout was exactly what I expected' beautiful! The color scheme and rustic tables and chairs, were brilliant. My friend started with a ginger tea, whilst I started with the Street Seat, a drink that has enough smooth to cater to a sweeter palette customer but packing enough punch for a palette that can handle some powerful GIN. Whoa!! Thankfully, we were in no rush after our dinner; you need a good 1/2 hr. to allow the drink to work its way out your system.I had the fish wrapped in banana leaf, while my friend had the bento box. All in all, the food was decent, not great! The food would have been great, had it not been lukewarm. The woman tending to our table, waited a good 10 minutes, when we were mid-way through with our course to check in. This was not beneficial because we would have benefit from her checking in sooner, as we would have gladly sent back the food. However, after having a jammed packed day, with minimal time to grab, as much as a protein bar; we were famished and devoured as much as possible, more for substance, less to do with the enjoyment of our taste buds. Overall, I am giving the establishment 3 stars, not because of the food or the service. However, the manager who was on shift 2/18, during the time slot of 7:30-9:30pm; was phenomenal! If he weren't there, I would have given the establishment only 1.5 star. He greeted everyone as they walked in and stopped by each diners table to check to see if they were enjoying the ""Streets Experience'. At that time, I made him aware of our unpleasant experience thus far. He immediately jumped into gear, bringing out a new drink, cleared our table, apologized repeatedly, and did everything in his power to guarantee that the remainder of our visit, would be enjoyable- and it was. Bear in mind, this is a new establishment and every new place, needs time to get into the groove. I believe they are still ironing out the kinks. If you are really famished, do not get the bento box, the portion is VERY small.",3.0

"Came here as a first stop in New York for a late night dinner with friends. The restaurant itself is a great place, pleasant atmosphere, easy to find, and cheerful wait staff. However, the food itself was average or slightly above average in regards to the fusion category.For dinner, my friends and I ordered the following: bulgogi tacos, lamb shank, pork belly, Brazilian green rice, Reuben sandwich and the free cheese bread/appetizer (that's offered if you check in via Yelp). Cons: For the appetizer, the bread was quite bland with no flavor. The dough itself was a bit too dry and overall, not a memorable dish. For the pork belly, this dish was a bit over fried and a bit too salty than expected. For the Reuben sandwich, this was pretty average, the sauce used for the dish had a unique texture to it. The sandwich itself is not too big or small and is pretty filling. Finally, I didn't really know what to expect of the green rice but it tasted like regular rice to me with no particular spices/herbal flavoring to it.Pros: The lamb shank and tacos were amazingly yummy! The tacos were an excellent example of Asian / Mexican food fusion and was very tasty. Sweet and spicy, the tacos were filling with its beef and various veggies. As for the lamb shank, the sides were alright but the lamb itself was super tasty, with the meat being super tender and moist. Overall, service here was pretty average. The waitstaff were friendly but given that it was a slow Thursday night, it did take us awhile to get the bill and such.

I ordered Mariscadas with a side if Brazilian Green Rice and he went with the Bulgogi Beef Tacos and Lobster Roll. If you are a seafoodie then get the Mariscadas with a Clementine Cilantro Mojito and don't forget to thank me later. Also scored a complimentary order of warm, cheesy, yummy Pão de Quejio for checking-in on yelp.

Peri Peri wings are slamming, the hotdogs are better than your local ball park. The game changer for me was the Mexican street corn. Dessert for us was the churros. Need I say more Lol. P.S. Check in with help and I got a free house margarita. SCORE.",5.0
"I went here last summer and the food was really food. I would say this restaurant is for people with an acquired  taste. What was really impressive Is that my date order his food and didn't like it, he ordered something else and we were NOT charge Extra for it!.The only thing I would suggest is to  serve cold water. I don't drink soda and try to stay away from juice, so water is next option. It was the summer time and I need a cold drink. Its also right next to the water and bridge, so you can have a romantic stroll by yourself or with a love one.",4.0
"Vibe is cool. Trendy open industrial space. Food a bit overpriced. Got the $26 sampler, including the bake n shark sandwich which was good, the peri peri wings which were fine, and the Mexican corn which was not great...Jerk pork entree was too salty for my taste.Korean bulgogi tacos were the best things we got. Know that 20% gratuity is included in the bill.. Our waiter was pleasant.",3.0
"I never really hangout in Brooklyn, but Roble is my favorite chef, so this ""out of the way"" trip to Streets was necessary.We came here on Valentine's Day and surprisingly it wasn't as crowded as I thought it'd be. We made reservations, but arrived fifteen minutes late (blame the MTA), so we had to wait an additional twenty minutes for our seats.  The restaurant hostesses were pleasant and patient when we continued to follow up on our wait time, so kudos to them.We peaked at the menu online before our visit, so we were ready to order as soon as the waiter came to our table. I ordered Mariscadas with a side if Brazilian Green Rice and he went with the Bulgogi Beef Tacos and Lobster Roll. If you are a seafoodie then get the Mariscadas with a Clementine Cilantro Mojito and don't forget to thank me later. Also scored a complimentary order of warm, cheesy, yummy Pão de Quejio for checking-in on yelp. To sum up this review, everything was delicious and everybody should check it out.Brooklyn's restaurant scene just became more interesting. You'll catch this Manhattan girl in BK more often.",5.0
"3.5 starsSo I had been dying to come to this place since it opened several weeks ago. I'd been seeing it all over Yelp and seeing many of my Yelp buddies check in to this place.I was so desperate to come here that I endured an hour and 10 minute bus ride across Brooklyn to arrive to the remote area where Streets is located. My experience here was a good one. Good, not great. I unfortunately did not experience anything spectacular overall but one thing that did stand out and was particularly memorable for me was the $12 Pain Killer drink they have. It is insanely delicious and a must have when coming here. Days after coming here and I'm still thinking about it. The drink is a concoction of pure magical goodness that tenderly tingles my tastebuds.When the other members of our party arrived, we were seated and I decided to try a different drink seeing as to how good the pain killer was. I ordered the blackberry lemonade and it was not nearly as good as the pain killer. So I told the waitress and she gladly switched the drink. I was anxious to see if they charged me on the bill for the drink I returned and they didn't. So they get cool points for that. When my sister and friend each ordered the vinegar fries, they seemed a little dry and sparse. My other friend decided to order fries a few minutes after them and her fries came to the table looking like the opposite of what my friend and sister got. Her fries were fresh and plentiful. My friend immediately asked for them to take the fries back because it looked like they got the bottom of the barrel. They gladly took it back and they received a fresh order of fries.  We never would have known how good the fries were supposed to be and look had my friend not ordered her own fries after them. They lose points for lack of consistency.The staff is pretty nice and accommodating. My sister and I first sat at the bar while we awaited our friends to arrive for our reservation. The bartender was cute and chill and made the bomb ass pain killer I mentioned before per his recommendation. The atmosphere is really chill and what you'd expect for the area of Williamsburg.I had the Bulgogi Tacos which were pretty good and the vinegar fries which I think complimented the tacos well. My friend also ordered the tacos and enjoyed them and my other amiga ordered the lobster roll sandwich which she enjoyed.The food here was good and fairly priced. Even with the long commute, I will be making my way back here sooner rather than later, probably when it gets a little warmer to try the peri peri wings and other enticing foods they have on their menu. And oh yeah, I'll be back for some more of that pain killer ;) This place is worth checking out.",3.0

(however, we did go on a Saturday night during a holiday weekend) - the restaurant is mess hall style so the noise level was elevated and dinner conversation for two people was basically shouting at each other.

"It has been two days and my husband can't stop raving about the jerk pork. My party of 8 visited Williamsburg for a show and wanted to go for dinner somewhere nearby. I made reservations only the night before and was easily accommodated. Two kids, two teens and four adults. The hostess was pleasant and sat us immediately. Our waiter was attentive and knowledgeable. Our cocktails were excellent. My teen son had the Mariscadas (seafood) and enjoyed it immensely. My other son had the doubles, bake and shark and peri peri wings combination, as did my cousin and I. That was a hit. The four year old was licking her fingers after eating the doubles. I had my doubles with the tamarind sauce, so good. The only other place I have had bake and shark like the one at Streets was at Maracas Beach in Trinidad. The mango chutney to go with it was a nice touch and addition to the shadon bennie sauce. A member of our party had the Streets Bao Box. When it arrived, beautifully presented I may add, I didn't think she could finish it all. I was wrong. She ate every morsel. She said it was perfectly prepared and flavorful. My husband ordered the Jerk Pork. He LOVED it. He said he hardly ever finds a restaurant where the food is nothing short of excellent. Yes he said excellent. He even talked highly of the slaw that came with it. He commended the detail and attention paid to the seasoning of the meat. He felt transported to Jamaica with just that one meal. And as I said days later he's still talking about that  jerk pork. From presentation, to taste, to service, Streets met and exceeded our every expectation.

"I have heard rave reviews about Streets so I made it back to Williamsburg to see it for myself! I like the decor,  semi open kitchen look, and decent layout overall.

"After reading all the great reviews and looking at the menu my friend and I decided to try this place for brunch. They serve ""street food"" dishes that represent different countries or areas of cuisine. It's also not far away from public transportation, for those that don't want to deal with the horrendous parking situation in Brooklyn. PROS:1. Wait time was excellent. Was seated immediately with virtually no wait.2. The food was beyond superb! The appetizers came out relatively quickly. We had the Peri Peri wings, Mexican Corn and Fries. They were all warm and delicious. The wings had a nice ""kick"" to it, and was fall off the bone scrumptious. I was surprised how great the Mexican Corn on the cob was and the fries were skinny, crispy and fantastic!3. The main dishes - Costa Rican breakfast and Bake and Shark were all off the chain! Being from the Caribbean, I was especially circumspect of these dishes. However, they did not disappoint and were great from start to finish! 4. The ""Painkiller"" drink was one of the best I ever had. Very well mixed, went well with the food and they did not skimp on the alcohol. I highly recommend it!5. Atmosphere was urban and would be suitable for a group. CONS:1. Our waiter was not as attentive as expected and I had to ask the bus boy twice for a drink and the waiter initially forgot we ordered fries. He was polite but did not go overboard to make you feel welcome or glad that you selected that restaurant to dine in.2. The bus boy seemed to be the only one on duty so I can excuse his look of disdain when asked to mention to the waiter that I needed another drink.So overall, the experience was great and I will certainly dine there again and highly recommend this restaurant.

"My overall experience was As Good As it Gets!Greeted by exceptionally warm hosts with complimentary coat check was a great way to start.  We were seated at the bar while we waited for our table, which was ready at the exact time of our reservation.  We decided to sit at the bar and eat because we had gotten comfortable and the bartenders were friendly and funny.We order a few things off the small plates menu and shared everything.  All ingredients were fresh and well put together.Highlights -- Bake and Shark (done to perfection) and the Spicy Seoul Octopus (so yummy and spicy).  The bulgogi tacos also very very good.  The flavors combined are unexpected but work oh so well together.This is a place where I encourage you to take risks.  Try new things, flavors, proteins, combinations.  The concept works well, as well as the menu.  You can play with small plate, go for an entree or combine things to create an amazing food experience.Enjoy!",5.0
"2.5It's been quite some time since I've had so much excitement to check out a new restaurant. Ever since  Marissa M discovered Streets last week and told me about it we have been eagerly anticipating our opportunity to visit and try some of that delicious looking food we saw on Instagram. The food: The bulgogi on the bulgogi taco is not even Bulgogi. Even a staff member referred to it as ""the steak taco"" and had no idea what bulgogi was. There wasn't a trace of that sweet bulgogi marinade you would expect on something being advertised as ""bulgogi"". While it wasn't bad, it definitely is not what's it's being advertised to be. And to make matters worse their using generic store bought flour tortillas instead of freshly made ones. This item was mediocre at best. Remember that Fourth of July your dad decided to BBQ some chicken? And he came back with a tray of chicken wings that on some parts were black and other parts looked undercooked? That's exactly what just happened at Streets, only they brushed on their bootleg version of peri peri sauce. What was apparent is that the chicken wasn't marinated for any significant amount time(or at all). Not a bit of seasoning had penetrated the skin. let me not forget the worse part of the chicken. They use those abnormally plump hormone injected wings. This is probably why the chicken was borderline under cooked. It's difficult to cook that steroid chicken all the way through.If you've ever had Nandos chicken in Europe you would reject this garbage. The Bake and Shark was this places only saving grace. Now this is what we came here for, ethnic food done right. The bake was crispy and went well with that nicely seasoned, breaded and fried shark meat. The shark had the flavor of a very clean tasting fish and a wonderful tender texture. That bake and shark is a the only thing I can recommend ordering at streets.Streets is a classic example of a place with an Executive Chef that had brilliant ideas that the kitchen staff is incapable of executing. I see the stock pictures their using on their Instagram and in their yelp page but much of what we ordered looks nothing like those pictures. I really wanted to love this place because in concept it's everything I've been waiting for in a new restaurant. But much of what we were served tonight was mediocre or just plain awful. They get a 2.5 instead of a 1 because that bake and shark is something special and because the service was fast and courteous.Tip to Management: Patrons don't need multiple staff members refilling our water ever 3 minutes. It interrupts conversations between patrons and just gets in the way. Since the carafes full of water are left at the table just let us pour our own water.",2.0
"18 different countries fused into 1 restaurant? After catching wind of the hype about the soft opening of Chef Roblè's Streets from a chef on Instagram, I had to go and visit for myself. Hittin the Streets: I shared my new discovery with a fellow Yelper and we scurried down to WillyB.  We saw the Streets logo as soon as we arrived on Broadway. We arrived 10 minutes too early until opening and were asked to come back. We returned and we're immediately seated.  I am very confused as to all the hype about the ""ambiance"". Bamboo plants...blue leather tufted seating,  mixed with wood? How does this capture the theme of Street foods from around the world ? The music was latin. Why aren't we playing west indian or African ? Or Asian? Where is the Street music?  The staff was overly courteous and hospitable.  Our bus guy refilled our water bottle and glasses as if we ordered a bottle of Moët. I get it. You are a new kid on the block. Street Food: Prior to coming we studied the menu so that we would avoid being overwhelmed. We ordered Doubles, Korean Bulgogi ""steak"" tacos, Bake and Shark and ""Peri Peri"" wings.  Everything we had with the exception of the Bake & Shark was mediocre. Bulgogi tacos were not Bulgogi.  The Doubles were standard. Shark Attack!!!!!  Bake and Shark $11- A Trinidadian delicacy! A flaky piece of fried shark on a bed of cabbage slaw paired with a flaky Bake bun was heavenly. If you visit,  this is your go to!!!!  Perils of Peri Peri- The worst was the Peri Peri Wings. Unseasoned and undercooked Bbq wings drenched in a terrible marinade. My fellow Yelper had to use a iPhone flashlight to question if there was blood?Terrible experience.  We brought it to the staffs attention and the manager kindly deducted it from our bill. Cost & Benefits Analysis: All and all, I would not come back to order Trinidadian food if the other menu items are lacking. The bake and shark was amazing. If Streets can expand the menu and make the other items comparable to the Trinidadian chef's, they may see me again. The service was great and personal but they must scale back on refilling water so often that guests may actually enjoy their food unbothered. The prices here are low for small plates $6-$14. You do get what you pay for. I would skip the trip and go to Jackson Heights for REAL Street food at large.",3.0
"Delicious fusion street food from all over the world.  Really well presented, small eats and larger dishes (on the more expensive side) if you so desire.  Had bulgogi tacos, hot dogs, and chicharones (get those!) - decent sized portions for small eats plates.  Go here for dinner, go here for drinks and apps, it's a little bit of everything.  The space of the restaurant was much larger than expected and it was really nicely decorated (fancy bathrooms).  Great service!  I'll be back!",4.0

Being from the Caribbean, I was especially circumspect of these dishes. However, they did not disappoint and were great from start to finish! 4. The ""Painkiller"" drink was one of the best I ever had. Very well mixed, went well with the food and they did not skimp on the alcohol. I highly recommend it!5. Atmosphere was urban and would be suitable for a group. CONS:1. Our waiter was not as attentive as expected and I had to ask the bus boy twice for a drink and the waiter initially forgot we ordered fries. He was polite but did not go overboard to make you feel welcome or glad that you selected that restaurant to dine in.2. The bus boy seemed to be the only one on duty so I can excuse his look of disdain when asked to mention to the waiter that I needed another drink.So overall, the experience was great and I will certainly dine there again and highly recommend this restaurant. However they loss one star due to the wait staff not being attentive.",4.0
"My overall experience was As Good As it Gets!Greeted by exceptionally warm hosts with complimentary coat check was a great way to start.  We were seated at the bar while we waited for our table, which was ready at the exact time of our reservation.  We decided to sit at the bar and eat because we had gotten comfortable and the bartenders were friendly and funny.We order a few things off the small plates menu and shared everything.  All ingredients were fresh and well put together.Highlights -- Bake and Shark (done to perfection) and the Spicy Seoul Octopus (so yummy and spicy).  The bulgogi tacos also very very good.  The flavors combined are unexpected but work oh so well together.This is a place where I encourage you to take risks.  Try new things, flavors, proteins, combinations.  The concept works well, as well as the menu.  You can play with small plate, go for an entree or combine things to create an amazing food experience.Enjoy!",5.0
"2.5It's been quite some time since I've had so much excitement to check out a new restaurant. Ever since  Marissa M discovered Streets last week and told me about it we have been eagerly anticipating our opportunity to visit and try some of that delicious looking food we saw on Instagram. The food: The bulgogi on the bulgogi taco is not even Bulgogi. Even a staff member referred to it as ""the steak taco"" and had no idea what bulgogi was. There wasn't a trace of that sweet bulgogi marinade you would expect on something being advertised as ""bulgogi"". While it wasn't bad, it definitely is not what's it's being advertised to be. And to make matters worse their using generic store bought flour tortillas instead of freshly made ones. This item was mediocre at best. Remember that Fourth of July your dad decided to BBQ some chicken? And he came back with a tray of chicken wings that on some parts were black and other parts looked undercooked? That's exactly what just happened at Streets, only they brushed on their bootleg version of peri peri sauce. What was apparent is that the chicken wasn't marinated for any significant amount time(or at all). Not a bit of seasoning had penetrated the skin. let me not forget the worse part of the chicken. They use those abnormally plump hormone injected wings. This is probably why the chicken was borderline under cooked. It's difficult to cook that steroid chicken all the way through.If you've ever had Nandos chicken in Europe you would reject this garbage. The Bake and Shark was this places only saving grace. Now this is what we came here for, ethnic food done right. The bake was crispy and went well with that nicely seasoned, breaded and fried shark meat. The shark had the flavor of a very clean tasting fish and a wonderful tender texture. That bake and shark is a the only thing I can recommend ordering at streets.Streets is a classic example of a place with an Executive Chef that had brilliant ideas that the kitchen staff is incapable of executing. I see the stock pictures their using on their Instagram and in their yelp page but much of what we ordered looks nothing like those pictures. I really wanted to love this place because in concept it's everything I've been waiting for in a new restaurant. But much of what we were served tonight was mediocre or just plain awful. They get a 2.5 instead of a 1 because that bake and shark is something special and because the service was fast and courteous.Tip to Management: Patrons don't need multiple staff members refilling our water ever 3 minutes. It interrupts conversations between patrons and just gets in the way. Since the carafes full of water are left at the table just let us pour our own water.",2.0
"18 different countries fused into 1 restaurant? After catching wind of the hype about the soft opening of Chef Roblè's Streets from a chef on Instagram, I had to go and visit for myself. Hittin the Streets: I shared my new discovery with a fellow Yelper and we scurried down to WillyB.  We saw the Streets logo as soon as we arrived on Broadway. We arrived 10 minutes too early until opening and were asked to come back. We returned and we're immediately seated.  I am very confused as to all the hype about the ""ambiance"". Bamboo plants...blue leather tufted seating,  mixed with wood? How does this capture the theme of Street foods from around the world ? The music was latin. Why aren't we playing west indian or African ? Or Asian? Where is the Street music?  The staff was overly courteous and hospitable.  Our bus guy refilled our water bottle and glasses as if we ordered a bottle of Moët. I get it. You are a new kid on the block. Street Food: Prior to coming we studied the menu so that we would avoid being overwhelmed. We ordered Doubles, Korean Bulgogi ""steak"" tacos, Bake and Shark and ""Peri Peri"" wings.  Everything we had with the exception of the Bake & Shark was mediocre. Bulgogi tacos were not Bulgogi.  The Doubles were standard. Shark Attack!!!!!  Bake and Shark $11- A Trinidadian delicacy! A flaky piece of fried shark on a bed of cabbage slaw paired with a flaky Bake bun was heavenly. If you visit,  this is your go to!!!!  Perils of Peri Peri- The worst was the Peri Peri Wings. Unseasoned and undercooked Bbq wings drenched in a terrible marinade. My fellow Yelper had to use a iPhone flashlight to question if there was blood?Terrible experience.  We brought it to the staffs attention and the manager kindly deducted it from our bill. Cost & Benefits Analysis: All and all, I would not come back to order Trinidadian food if the other menu items are lacking. The bake and shark was amazing. If Streets can expand the menu and make the other items comparable to the Trinidadian chef's, they may see me again. The service was great and personal but they must scale back on refilling water so often that guests may actually enjoy their food unbothered. The prices here are low for small plates $6-$14. You do get what you pay for. I would skip the trip and go to Jackson Heights for REAL Street food at large.",3.0
"Delicious fusion street food from all over the world.  Really well presented, small eats and larger dishes (on the more expensive side) if you so desire.  Had bulgogi tacos, hot dogs, and chicharones (get those!) - decent sized portions for small eats plates.  Go here for dinner, go here for drinks and apps, it's a little bit of everything.  The space of the restaurant was much larger than expected and it was really nicely decorated (fancy bathrooms).  Great service!  I'll be back!",4.0
Omg!!! This place is amazing....Came here again for dinner today with family and we loved every thing we ate. I had the bake and shark and it was fantastic! Not to mention we got to meet Chef Roble today!! A must try on the drink menu is the Painkiller. Words cannot describe how good that drink is. Streets BK is my favorite restaurant right now. I want to try the entire menu.,5.0
"Amazing food! The service was amazing, our waiter Aidan was very prompt and knowledgeable. The peri peri wings had really nice sweet and spicy flavor. The sweet was not over powering.

"Came here for dinner with my mom and it was a great experience. As per the reviews I opted for the pain killer. This is probably one of the best cocktails I've ever had. I have to try to recreate it because I def don't have the time to run to this side of Brooklyn on a regular.The service was awesome. Our Waiter Daniel, was very attentive and friendly. The chef and the manager (I think) even came over to us to see how we were enjoying the food. The food was delicious! Just an FYI, not all of the ""small plates"" are actual small plates. They can easily be an entree. The peri peri wings are great, cooked soft and I love the charred taste on them. We also had the bulgogi tacos, and Pao De Queijo (check in on yelp when you get there for a free serving) both tasty. We were so full after those 2 but I was determined to make room for the Bake and Shark. I can't speak for my mom's lobster roll but that bake and shark is so Damn good! My family is from Trinidad and Tobago and I must say that bake and shark had me feeling like I'm back home at Maracas Bay! Make sure if you order that put some chadon beni, tamarin sauce (a lil too watery btw), and some slight pepper sauce (called something else at Streets).  Very authentic flavoring and sauce pairings. I'll be going back for a painkiller and bake & shark. You should too.",5.0

"After catching Chef Roble talking about Streets' genius concept on a recent episode of The Chew, I decided it was high time to take yet another trip into Williamsburg to see about the latest, hottest, & hippest spot. It was date night and so it was just the hubby & I out for the night.  But although it was just the two of us, after reading through their mouthwatering menu, we agreed it was best to order as though there were six of us at the table.  You know, so we could sample a bit of everything & have the rest as leftovers.  Yeah right.  As it turns out, those dishes didn't have a chance.  So without further delay, here's a list of what we ordered, in the order from our personal favorite to ""also pretty outstandingly delish"".South African Peri Peri Wings (holy addiction, Batman!)Bulgogi Beef Korean TacosEcuadorean Ceviche Trini DoublesBrazilian Pao de Queijo (cheesy bread)Mexican Street CornPS - Their hot sauces are so on the $$!",5.0
"A perfect setting matched with outstanding food and impeccable service. The space is very open and airy. The decor is rustic yet original and every detail from the lighting to the quality/comfort of the furniture was a perfect accent to the theme of Streets.The menu is a variety of street food from around the world and although the prices are a bit inflated compared to market cost on the street, they are moderately priced for New York City.I enjoyed the Concord Grape French 75 which was light and refreshing from the champagne and grape foam but not too sweet, saved by the gin. I recommend this beverage to anyone looking for something different but wanting to avoid a sugar overload often found in cocktails. For an appetizer I opted for the Mexican Street Corn because of my affinity to corn. It was delicious but not the best. It's exactly what you would expect and the corn is prepared right before serving so points for hot food.My entree, Vegetable Turkish Mashup, was absolutely phenomenal. The seasonings added to the grilled cauliflower and roasted eggplant were slightly spicy and very flavorful. Yes, even the eggplant was delightful. The texture was not lifeless and slimy. It was expertly prepared and the pieces were cut from baby eggplant which allowed it to keep its shape. This was atop an amazingly seasoned lentil puree which was the perfect combination with a crisp vegetable. I will be traveling to Turkey to sample this inspiring dish. The final touch was this fantastic rendition of cheesecake baked within pieces of phyllo dough and covered in honey, resembling baklava. Absolutely delicious.With all of this to say, it is hands down the service that was out of this world.  Glorimar was truly the best server I have ever had and we were a large table of 10. She was very attentive to the moods and level of awareness each individual patron was giving her and managed to float through the table  changing out our silverware, refilling waters, collecting our napkins and plates, serving new plates, asking our feedback about the meal without feeling overwhelming. She was so polite and at the very end sincerely welcomed each one of us to please come back and ask for her as she would absolutely love to serve us again.

"I love, love, love the concept. I also have a general affinity for street food, so this place just makes sense. The variety of the menu is impressive though I am always a bit leary of a menu that tries to do too much. I believe they feature food from 12 different countries. Everything looked so good. We ordered the Cuban sandwich, Korean tacos. Pao de quejo, greens and the jerk pork for the table. That amount of food was definitely filling for the 3 of us although only 1 was technically the larger sized entree. While it all looked amazing, many of the dishes were strangely lacking flavor with the exception of the jerk pork. The drinks were amazing. I ordered one of their specialty drinks.  We ordered 3 different types and everyone enjoyed theirs. The overall experience was nice. Cool lively vibe here too. I will probably end up returning but definitely wish the actual food would taste as good as it looked. Better solution may be to order dishes with strong sauces.",4.0
"This food was so bomb!I usually hate small plates, but this was a really successful small plate experience for me. Our waiter was super helpful in assisting us in picking out different options and all were very good. I went here with my sister for my birthday and we gorged ourselves. The highlight were their chicharones which have become legendary among my friend circle. They also had really good prawns that were flavored superbly. We got the korean beef tacos and the roti all of which get high marks in my book. Drink-wise, I got this beverage that I can no longer remember the name of, but suffice it to say, it was excellent. I usually hate coconut flavored things, but this was full of tasty, sweet coconut milk with a sorrel twist. It was really great. The only thing that gets a less than stellar rating was the birthday cake I got. The waiter described it as this decadently chocolate cake with Guiness in the batter and Jameson in the icing. My sister and I got it and it pretty much just tasted bland, lukewarm and the icing was the flavor and consistency of ointment. However even though the cake fell flat, the presentation was everything! I felt so celebrated having gone here for my birthday! Do yourself a favor (or shall I say, a flavor - ha!) and check out Chef Roble's awesome place.",4.0
"Generally, when a restaurant has too many different types of cuisines in one kitchen, things can go horribly wrong. However, Streets manages to do this very well. In particular the Caribbean (Trinidad) food is very authentic (I'm Trini). You have to try the doubles, corn soup, and roti. The bake and shark is good but not great. However I haven't tried it in over a year. Also very good is the jerk pork and the peri peri wings. In terms of drinks, my favorites are the painkiller and the sidecar. I've been here about 5 times now over the span of a year, with groups ranging in size from 2 to 8, and have always had a great experience. Only drawback is that if you don't live in BK, it's a little far of a walk from the nearest subway stop (Bedford L). Still, I live in Harlem and it's always worth the trip.",5.0

"I went back with my partner for an early Valentine's Day dinner. We started with the doubles, peri peri wings, mini bake and shark and bulgogi tacos. Again the bake and shark was the obvious star. The tacos were good but taste like ones I make at home. I did not care for the wings there was too many different flavors. The doubles were terrible. They were cold and the channa wasn't good. Next, he ordered the steak and I got the roti. Both were good but the steak would have been a better meal with different accompaniments. We took cornish hen and chicharonnes to go. The hen reminded me of the peri peri wings. Chicharonnes were yummy. The desserts weren't too exciting to me. We were given a verbal listing at the beginning of our meal but the apple pie that was planned to order was no longer being served when it was time to order. I stand behind my initial review, they're overpriced and there are too many misses and not enough hits. However, I'll be back to try done more dishes.",3.0
"I liked the ambiance of this place. I watched Chef Roble's show when it was on television and followed him every since. I thought he was the owner of this restaurant. I believe he is the food consultant. I had the chimichurri skirt steak with fries and a delightfully delicious salad(quinoa, kale, pineapple, cherry tomatoes and a light tasty dressing). The churros was a delicious dessert choice. It came with three dipping sauces. The salted caramel was my absolute favorite. We had a trio app in which we choose the doubles, perri perri wings and the Mexican corn. The doubles were delicious. The wings and corn was decent. Overall, I would recommend trying this restaurant.",4.0

"Went here after going to the Brooklyn Brewery! Amazing spot. Met the chef himself, and he commented he gets inspired by traveling a lot. That's why You have a mix of Caribbean food added to the menu. I suggest you try everything from the menu. I tried the wings, cheese bread, shark sandwich and Cuban sandwich! Really tasty.  The restaurant also provides different sauces freshly made. My favorite is the cilantro sauce. I will go again. Good spot!  PS! The price is reasonable! NYC.. Good for groups!",4.0
"Dined here on a recent Tuesday evening. Sat at the bar, chatting with the bartender Yuri. Yuri makes a killer classic caipirinha. I ordered from the Tuesday specials menu for my appetizer. Crab claw guacamole was beyond delicious. Served with warm tortilla chips that were just salty enough. Yum!!! My entree was the churassco y papas, steak & fries. It was really good, however I wish they'd stuck with the ribeye instead of the skirt steak they now serve. Steak was perfectly seasoned and prepared medium, just as I'd requested. Steak cut fries were really good as well. It was served with a nice little salad. All in all, I'd definitely return.",4.0
"I love, love, love the concept. I also have a general affinity for street food, so this place just makes sense. The variety of the menu is impressive though I am always a bit leary of a menu that tries to do too much. I believe they feature food from 12 different countries. Everything looked so good. We ordered the Cuban sandwich, Korean tacos. Pao de quejo, greens and the jerk pork for the table. That amount of food was definitely filling for the 3 of us although only 1 was technically the larger sized entree. While it all looked amazing, many of the dishes were strangely lacking flavor with the exception of the jerk pork. The drinks were amazing. I ordered one of their specialty drinks.  We ordered 3 different types and everyone enjoyed theirs. The overall experience was nice. Cool lively vibe here too. I will probably end up returning but definitely wish the actual food would taste as good as it looked. Better solution may be to order dishes with strong sauces.",4.0
"This food was so bomb!I usually hate small plates, but this was a really successful small plate experience for me. Our waiter was super helpful in assisting us in picking out different options and all were very good. I went here with my sister for my birthday and we gorged ourselves. The highlight were their chicharones which have become legendary among my friend circle. They also had really good prawns that were flavored superbly. We got the korean beef tacos and the roti all of which get high marks in my book. Drink-wise, I got this beverage that I can no longer remember the name of, but suffice it to say, it was excellent. I usually hate coconut flavored things, but this was full of tasty, sweet coconut milk with a sorrel twist. It was really great. The only thing that gets a less than stellar rating was the birthday cake I got. The waiter described it as this decadently chocolate cake with Guiness in the batter and Jameson in the icing. My sister and I got it and it pretty much just tasted bland, lukewarm and the icing was the flavor and consistency of ointment. However even though the cake fell flat, the presentation was everything! I felt so celebrated having gone here for my birthday! Do yourself a favor (or shall I say, a flavor - ha!) and check out Chef Roble's awesome place.",4.0
"Generally, when a restaurant has too many different types of cuisines in one kitchen, things can go horribly wrong. However, Streets manages to do this very well. In particular the Caribbean (Trinidad) food is very authentic (I'm Trini). You have to try the doubles, corn soup, and roti. The bake and shark is good but not great. However I haven't tried it in over a year. Also very good is the jerk pork and the peri peri wings. In terms of drinks, my favorites are the painkiller and the sidecar. I've been here about 5 times now over the span of a year, with groups ranging in size from 2 to 8, and have always had a great experience. Only drawback is that if you don't live in BK, it's a little far of a walk from the nearest subway stop (Bedford L). Still, I live in Harlem and it's always worth the trip.",5.0
"+++- Portions are gigantic. I think for people coukld eat off two entrees- That rice is awesome, esp with the sauce++- hangover cure is everything they say it is- Don't forget your cheese biscuits with yelp check in- churassco and papas; Delish--They give you like four potatoes worth of fries- That steak is perfectly prepared, and perfectly seasoned+- peri peri wings are good- Pai gyang was good- Whole fish was dope too- Greens are goodTIPS:- Make sure to make your reseys or else, you WILL wait",5.0
"I went back with my partner for an early Valentine's Day dinner. We started with the doubles, peri peri wings, mini bake and shark and bulgogi tacos. Again the bake and shark was the obvious star. The tacos were good but taste like ones I make at home. I did not care for the wings there was too many different flavors. The doubles were terrible. They were cold and the channa wasn't good. Next, he ordered the steak and I got the roti. Both were good but the steak would have been a better meal with different accompaniments. We took cornish hen and chicharonnes to go. The hen reminded me of the peri peri wings. Chicharonnes were yummy. The desserts weren't too exciting to me. We were given a verbal listing at the beginning of our meal but the apple pie that was planned to order was no longer being served when it was time to order. I stand behind my initial review, they're overpriced and there are too many misses and not enough hits. However, I'll be back to try done more dishes.",3.0
"I liked the ambiance of this place. I watched Chef Roble's show when it was on television and followed him every since. I thought he was the owner of this restaurant. I believe he is the food consultant. I had the chimichurri skirt steak with fries and a delightfully delicious salad(quinoa, kale, pineapple, cherry tomatoes and a light tasty dressing). The churros was a delicious dessert choice. It came with three dipping sauces. The salted caramel was my absolute favorite. We had a trio app in which we choose the doubles, perri perri wings and the Mexican corn. The doubles were delicious. The wings and corn was decent. Overall, I would recommend trying this restaurant.",4.0

"Nice spot. Location is great, like two blocks away from the water in Willamsburg. Decor is unique, colorful painting featuring a few of the world's landmarks along the back wall, by the open face kitchen the walls are wood paneled, the dining tables and chairs were finished wood as well. Streets is modern but the dim lighting makes this place warm and comfy.The menu was very random which I appreciated. From Asian inspired to Carribean to Cuban, I enjoyed not being mandated to indulge in one type of cuisine.We ordered drinks first, the Streets Pain Killer and the Cranberry Ginger Mule, both were delicious and strong. Our waiter first brought out the Doubles and the Trini corn soup. Doubles were really good, the chickpeas inside were seasoned well. The Doubles came with accompanying sauces and boy when I tell you that green sauce!!! Whatever it is, that joint is the best thing created! I legit wanted to put it on everything. Trini corn soup was good, flavors were there but the dumplings were a bit too soft for my liking. Next came the Roti canai, Peri Peri wings and malt vinegar fries. Roti was an enjoyable buttery twist on the classic west indian roti and the accompanying side of chicken curry was delicious. Peri peri wings were only ok, the spice was there but the wings honestly tasted frozen. The texture of the meat was weird so we didn't finish them. The malt vinegar fries were a nice twist as well to the classic shoestring fries. Reminded me of salt and vinegar chips which I loved as a youth. The manager came over and socialized with us for a bit which I appreciated. She also comped my vodka and pineapple after being told it got to our table 20 minutes after I ordered it. Overall I had a good experience here, the waiter was very knowledgeable of the menu, the decor is chic, the location is prime for summer outings so I think I'll stop back again in the next few months.",4.0
"This is a zero star reviews. I truly don't want to review here but complain somewhere else but I have no clue where to go. Came in for dinner in a practically empty restaurant.

So our second ""waiter"" who cause the beginning disaster made the gratuity turn to zilch.1st this person who clearly should be a busboy spills my entire drink on my lap/shoes, does not apologies and tells his manager that I had an accident. Initially I thought he was being funny like ""oh I heard you had a little accident"" then I realized that horrible busboy(grey shirt) didn't bother taking the fault for his actions.2nd the only good thing from the entire meal was the prawns and vinegar fries.3rd I almost died.. Yes no exaggeration I chocked on a piece of rotten lobster. Did anyone help! NO! I did the damn international hands to throat chocking sign and only my partner went to help me. Thanks to my body my throat opened up and I began to breath. I was beyond upset by the fact that my life almost ended in a restaurant but mainly because everyone around me were all in there own world. Even now writing this I'm in tears. If I could find a way to complain other than this site I would. All I can do is say beware to all my fellow people. You will not get service or good food here.Overall as part of a Yelp review I highly recommend you eat next door or anywhere that has basic human decency.",1.0
"Now the jerk pork I didn't like and also thought the food options was pricey . Maybe I might go back but for what it's worth I can just go to a authentic West Indian restaurant for half the price .

"A fantastic concept done somewhat OK...Streets has a lot going for it at a glance. Street food from around the world with cocktails and beers to compliment the international focus. Unfortunately, the execution of said international flavor left something to be desired. Lets start with the most important point. The menu is inspired by the simple foods found on the street from around the world... With the plethora of food trucks and street meats in the city, a place that serves all under one roof is enticing. What was found is that I'd rather visit several trucks and stands. Started in the east with the Roti Canai and Seul Spicy Octopus... Should have stopped there. Roti itself was brittle and crumbled, the curry portion of it seemed more like mashed potatoes than a curry. The flavor however was on point, but I couldn't get over the consistency. The Octopus was rubbery, enough said... To boot this was a Saturday evening when restaurants are supposed to be on their A game. Should have stopped there, but ventured on toward the islands with the fish in Banana leaf and mainland South America with the Churrasco. Again, flavors were on point, but expecting juicy flaky fish was a bit too much to ask for. Steak was more medium well than medium rare.Drinks: Cocktail menu seemed to have some interesting things going for it, but I opted for beer since most street food doesn't consist of a rock or martini glass. If there was a way to pick the most commonplace beers around, they found it... Typical red stripe, peroni, tecate, sapporo... Beers seemed haphazardly selected and outrageously priced given the cost of the bottles. Seasonal draft... You guessed it, Brooklyn Brewery.Atmosphere: Large open room, tables lined in rows. Music surprisingly what you would hear on Z 100 instead of the local sounds from around the world one would expect given the menu. Let's just say it didn't compliment the concept. Price: Given the portions and the what was produced. Let's just say save your money... Two drinks, 2 apps, 2 mains,over a hundred... Would have gladly paid if food and atmosphere was better.Lesson learned: Stop at the street carts and pass on by streets... Your wallet and pallet will appreciate the decision.",2.0
"Ok... I will say, I had a few reservations about coming here because of how popular the owner is. I figured it would be a ""trendy"" place full of privileged hipsters or wannabe cool kids. On the contrary, Streets has a real chill vibe to it. Not pretentious at all. Upon entering, we were greeted by the hostesses. We gave our name and were told the wait would be 35 min. We asked if we could sit at the bar for drinks and we were told that we could. One Hostess even went as far as suggesting that we eat at the bar. My side eye must have been vicious because Sid, another Hostess assured we would be seated at a table. Sid clearly has really great people skills, picks up on non verbal cues, is funny and has a chill personality. Sid was able to seat us ahead of time. We only waited 15 min. Thank you Sid!While sitting at the bar, Yoli served us. Yoli was pleasant, attractive, and edgy... Both my boyfriend and I and every other man in the place kept staring at her derrière. Although it was busy, Yoli remained fairly attentive. Yoli is a GREAT mixologist, the Dark & Stormy was like a molecular alcoholic dream. Tip: Try drinking the bottom first then sip the top. WOWSERS! Mix it up and enjoy. The Painkiller is sweet but strong. But I preferred the Dark & Stormy.Cheers to Roble or Diana the manager for hiring great staff!Decor- Ok... It's a bit all over the place in terms of theme... I get that it's like NY meets Thailand and the islands but the art on the wall is Hard to follow... However, LOVE THE FLOORPLAN! Love the open kitchen And the exposed concrete... The bar is fully stocked and beautiful... The bathroom is everything, loved the floor to ceiling mirror outside of it as well! Aiden- our server was very good! Aiden was Attentive, explained the menu, made recommendations for us, and got me a new chair because mine was off kilter. Our food came out very quickly and it was hot. Food: We had the Pia de Quejo to start (which is a cheesy biscuit) it was good. Then I had the prawns two ways... Both ways were delicious! One was spicy and the other was sweet with a kick of spice. My boyfriend had the Jerk pork which lacked the flavor of Jerk to me. It tasted more like BBQ pork. I had the Bake & Shark which was so good!!! However, I've never had Bake & Shark before so I can't compare it to anything. Lastly, for dessert, we had the Guinness Chocolate cake which is very rich and decadent. It's chocolate cake layered with mousse and topped with a blackberry. We couldn't finish it but it was worth the try!I gave Streets 4 stars due to the pork. Overall, we very much enjoyed our experience and we will come back!",4.0
"Awesome food & drinks!Wholesome, yet funky ambience!Excellent, friendly customer service!A few of us visited there last week for my mom's bday and had a blast.

For entree, 3 of use had the fish of the day, which was a whole fried snapped and two dipping sauces (tamarind and a soy, Asian influenced sauce), while my son had the jerk pork. Besides the flavor being authentic and powerful, everthing was super fresh! I told them it was my mother's BDay, so we ordered two desserts and they wrote her name in chocolate and did a cute presentation.

The octopus starter was great so was the Korean tacos. The Thai chicken was great the flavored were there are described.

Omg streets, please stay on top of the list of great Brooklyn eats. It's so hard to find a place where you would fall in love with every dish tried. My only question however is, what about dessert? Lol I'm an avid dinner and dessert type of lady so I look for that extra something after a great meal. For what they offer, I was well satisfied from the first bite so I didn't miss dessert much. I highly recommend this place to anyone and after dinner take a nice stroll and enjoy Williamsburg while walking off that hearty meal. My fav so fair!!!!",5.0
"Took a chance and tried this place last night and I'm pretty glad I did. First of all, the restaurant is really comfortable and the service is great. Their cocktails are outstanding and wanted to try them all. I did have ""The Pain Killer"" which was recommended by so many people and now I know why. It's a must have drink. Along with the green bloody mary which was spicy but delicious as well. I had the Chicharrons, Brazilian Cheese Bread and the Bake and Shark sandwich to start. Everything was delicious. The rib eye steak was huge and I said to cook it medium but it was close to well done. It was great anyways but that was my only problem. For dessert the Tres Leches was insanely good. I'll be back to try other great things on the menu because I really wanted to try them all.",4.0
A very unique styled menu with a various selection of dishes that consists of robust of flavors. I would definitely recommend this restaurant especially if you are a foodie and appreciate the art of culinary and flavors. The cocktails are very tasty and natural. The food selection touches on different cultures. The ambiance is casual and wide open.,4.0
"It's great to have such diversity of good food in one restaurant. My three friends and I were debating on which one to try and they all sounded good. We did the three tapas as an appetizer for the table. I highly recommend it. It was enough for us four before our big entrees. We started with the tapas; which was the peri peri wings, Thai duck salad, and the chicharrones. I could eat each one individually as a meal. So good. The peri peri wings was decent sized wings and although dry on the outside, they got it juicy in the inside. The Thai duck salad was so interesting. The duck is infused with the sweet mango flavor. The chicharrones... Yea who doesn't love fried pork belly. It was cut into small pieces and friend to a nice thin crisp coating. Take one bite and taste the soft belly :). Oh, the wings and chicharrones were slightly spicy. For entree, I got the fish with banana leaf. The fish was fresh with some subtle taste to it. There is the sweet dipping sauce, which I think was apple or pear. It's not something I would typically dip fish in. But it works. The sweet plantains were very good and I actually appreciate the chunks in it, not sure if it's intentional or not.My friend had the Gai Yang (it's huge, definitely not a small chicken for one). The dipping sauce seems like a fusion for me but was refreshing and delicious. The chicken was tender and skin with enough flavor to compliment the white meat. Another friend had the Jerk Pork. It's spicy. The meat very tender. And another the Mariscadas.I'll come back.",5.0
"This restaurant is the Bomb.com lol I went here last week with a couple of friends,  and was not disappointed the food was exceptional the customer service was extremely pleasant and helpful. We had a pleasure of meeting one of the bartenders name Luke who kindly helped us with our very well put together mixed drinks we also had an amazing waiter. The ambiance was pretty cool loved the set up. Streets will definitely see me again!!",4.0
"Where do I start? The service was great...the staff was very attentive and very accommodating. My boo wanted a caipirinha and the bartender made one of the best ones I've ever tasted. The appetizers, which were a pick of three types of sample versions of the appetizers were bomb. Then promptly after our entrees followed. I got the lamb shank, ohhhhhh, and he got the Thai chicken (can't remember the name), but omfg...amazing. We were so full, tipsy and satisfied, that we didn't have room for dessert. Definitely will be getting some next time we go back though. This place is delicious!",5.0
"Great food, subpar service. It's a new place, so maybe they don't have their systems down yet. Wait staff simply didn't have it together. Kitchen was on point, though. We had a large group and tried  most of the menu. Here goes:Drinks - all of the cocktails were great and I agree with other yelpers that the Pain Killer, with its shaved coconut, was the most delicious. Apps - the bulgogi tacos were everyone's favorite. I would get these just for takeout and skip the restaurant riff raff. Fried pork belly was delicious as were the wings. Skip the doubles, which we found to be overrated by other yelp reviewers. Chickpeas are sooooo basic. Entrees -  the hearty favorite was the lamb shank with saffron rice.  The bento box was a close second because you get a lot of variety, although no one really touched the cod on this plate. The whole chicken was pretty good, too. Cannot comment on dessert because nobody came around to offer us any. Our bill came out to around $300+ for 3 couples. Not bad. Would definitely go back, but not on a Sunday night.",4.0

"1pm on a Saturday / during Labor Day weekend. Only 5 other tables seated. The hot dog trio was the talk of the table. The buns are grilled (?) with butter and are so soft and sweet. Tasted like they were baked fresh in their own oven. Black-eyed peas, duck confit and crispy onions are the 3 toppings. The onion dog had a smear of onion inside the bun that was off the chain.The yelp deal check/in cheese bread was outstanding! And yes, Bake n Shark and Doubles were just as everyone else has described.If you go for brunch:- Split your meals. The food is decadent and beyond filling. And the majority of the menu is associated with bread, so...If you go anytime:- The painkiller cocktail is delicious. It's sweet, it's creamy and it's a funky lavender color. Not a head banger though.The ambiance is gorgeous, but horrible for picture taking during daytime hours. We were surprised to see it so empty when every other nearby restaurant was filled to capacity. Don't hate on Streets, Williamsburg. :)love,NicoleGetUnstuckNYC.com",5.0
"Soooo about Streets, it's a must try! Very eccentric variety, I am Trinidadian and the hot sauce / pepper sauce made me think my uncle made it it was hot and tasty like back home even the shadow beni sauce had great kick. Didn't try the Trini dishes but them they were a hot seller, kept seeing them coming out. The drinks were not watered which is always my pet peeve. The octopus starter was great so was the Korean tacos. The Thai chicken was great the flavored were there are described. I am not a fan of Brussels sprouts but the Thai chicken came with them and I would have them again and again! Good job chef! Oh let's not forget the waitress she was awesome, she did her job. I'll be back! Thanks for the birthday surprise guys...",4.0
"Can I just say that this place is the BEST! How can you not fall in love with a restaurant who offers you friendly service, comfort and EXCELLENT food! Everything that I tried last night was so delicious and nothing lacked flavor at all. I'm seriously coming back here and cannot wait to try their brunch. Omg streets, please stay on top of the list of great Brooklyn eats. It's so hard to find a place where you would fall in love with every dish tried. My only question however is, what about dessert? Lol I'm an avid dinner and dessert type of lady so I look for that extra something after a great meal. For what they offer, I was well satisfied from the first bite so I didn't miss dessert much.

"Went there on a Saturday night for dinner. There were no tables so we decided to sit at the bar which was better I think. Bartender was very nice and drinks were great. I was only able to have 1 drink the entire sitting. Not even water. The poor bartender was so backed up Making drinks for the bar and the tables. On a Saturday night they should have more than one person making drinks. Restaurant was busy but not over booked. There were a lot of group tables. A woman maybe a hostess or manager was helping him... She was nice but wasn't very efficient I'm sure she's not a bartender. We may have had 3 or 4 drinks that night but no one to make them. Glasses empty but no one offering to make another so when I calculate that's ~$70 off the tab I'm sure we weren't the only ones. Overall the food was delicious and staff was friendly. I had the jerk pork, fries were amazing! The ginger mule was so good but only able to have 1. Hope they can hire another bartender to help. Maybe I'll go earlier on a weekday rather than a Saturday night. Service is everything and can ruin an experience hopefully they take care of that.",3.0
"The service here was very good. I love going places with great customer service and manager!! My cousin heard a lot of great reviews about this place and we wanted to check it out. We were disappointed they don't have lunch hours and they only open at 5 pm but we was told they still in their soft opening seeing what works best so we understand. However we finally made it out yo Streets today and I enjoyed my food choices! I order the whole chicken and Streets Killer drink both were really good!!! The whole chicken had very good seasoning and flavor!! The doubles and the chesse rolls (forgot name on menu) were okay but I had better!! My cousin ordered the jerk pork and it was too spicy for her. I didn't taste it cause I don't eat pork but the sweet plantains that came with the jerk pork was nicely fried and sweet just how I love them. They just need to give a little more plantains with the meal!! Or by the way the chicken comes with this soaky greens that wasn't hardy enough so order a side with it. Overall the drinks are really good, select foods are good too, beautiful deco and great customer service! However they need to add more choices to the menu!! If you open to unique tastes try this place out but if you're like my cousin I say this isn't the place for you!",3.0
"Simply delicious!!!I went with a group a friends and we had a fantastic time. It has a fun vibe to hang out and grab drinks. I had the lobster roll and fries and they rocked! Lobster rolls can sometimes be hard to get right but it was delicious and the fries...try them!! I also had the Mexican street corn which again was delicious. It's very authentic tasting to eating corn in Mexico. I'm Mexican so I have big expectations when I see Mexican corn on the menu. We shared as apps: kong prawns, pao de queijo which was enough for 4 people so we had enough room for dinner. The pao de queijo was AMAZING! Cheesy deliciousness.For drinks I had the pain killer...well I had two :) delicious and refreshing!Service was also fantastic! I had ordered a dessert for my friends who had just gotten engaged and asked that they personalize the plate and they were so busy they couldn't so they gave us a dessert on the house...very nice on them.

Both amazing and refreshing. I could probably drink a whole bucket of each and be very happy.The third star is for the adobo chicharrones... O M G. It's like little pieces of crunchy chewy pork candy in a Filipino marinade. Simply genius!!!The fourth star is for the prawns two ways...ok guys, don't be scared now to suck a little prawn head!

That's an automatic 3 Stars in my book!Now onto what I ordered! So I had the Korean Bulgogi taco and I was surprised by how great it taste! Bulgogi can either go good or bad this went beyond that it was actually excellent I had so many other Bulgogi tacos elsewhere at this hands-down is the best.The meat was so juicy and full of savory flavors which tasted like it was marinades for centuries and the crispy shell was what topped it off for me. I think if they pair it with a kimchi slaw that would be a perfect match!!I also ordered the Jerk Pork and was surprised it came out tasting authentically really well.  And I only say this because when most restaurants do a jerk dish that usually cater to a certain type of pallet where it's not as spicy or is a savory or flavorful as if should be and this one actually was. The meat was perfectly tender, nicely charred and paired with slaw and plantains fried to perfection. So judging from the two dishes that I ordered what I love so far about Streets is that it you can taste the origin and culture of the food and where it's from! Authenticity done at its best!

"Love Chef Roble so I was pretty excited to check out his restaurant! We made a reservation and then had to switch the time and they were very accommodating. The hostesses were sweet and our bartender was awesome. The actual restaurant is very nice and very well put together. Kudos to the designer. It has a great ambiance for dinner.I was excited at the concept of Streets because its dishes are inspired from 18 different countries. To start, I used the yelp app and got the free pai de queijo. I've never had it before, but it was okay. Very dense. For the rest of dinner my group ordered small plates and shared. The trini corn soup was amazing! Mmmmm. I also had the Roti Canai which had really good flavor. The spicy sauce for the Prawns had just enough kick and was flavorful. The fattoush was pretty much a salad. Decent, but nothing to write home about. Lastly, the bulgogi tacos (mushroom) were amazing!!! The kimchi aoli was absolutely delicious. I would definitely be back to explore the menu.

"Came here on a Wednesday summer night. The place more brightly lit than I prefer and it was half empty... but I came came all the way from the city so decided to stay optimistic and give it a chance. The idea of street food from around the world is excellent but the execution could use some work.Service: Took 15 minutes to place drink order and another 15 minutes to get the round of 4 drinks; we tried to get the attention of the waitress (oddly difficult considering the place was half empty) at one point and she gave us the ""pointy finger"" hold on / rude expression. Rude!Drinks: Grape Concord Cocktail didn't take like grape and the grape foam it was topped with made the cocktail smelled funny/quetionable. I drank it just to be a good sport. Someone else with our party ordered a cocktail with dairy in it I believe...and it tasted rotten!Food: Beware of the ceviche!  We did not eat much as we were already put off by the bad service and long wait for the drinks. Plus, it didn't look too good. Honestly, we should have sent it back but I hate being one of those picky, difficult diners. Anyway, one us had a piece of shrimp and it was so bad he spit it out. However, one of us was bold enough to have a shrimp and actually swallow it. Unfortunately, this was a bad idea as it ended up haunting at 3am with extreme cramps and diarrhea. I tried a bite of the meat in the Korean taco.... it wasn't God awful but it tasted OLD.This was by far thee worst NYC dining experience I have ever had... and I have lived here over 10 years! I am honestly not sure what all the hype is about but BK loves to over hype things! This is a testament to places being over hyped simply because of the ""celebrity chef"" name attached to it.  (As a former BK resident, I am entitled to say this.)

"Please don't rocks at me but I thought Streets was OK. My friend were so hyped for this place that they planned their meals a week before coming. After tracking Chef Roble and his cooking prowess on Facebook I too had become equally excited. Reservations were for Thursday at 9 pm (couldn't get anything for 8pm). The decor on the inside was lovely. Bright lighting, lunchtable seating, a chandelier made with rope and lightbulbs...awesome. The hostess was very sweet and quickly seated us. We started with drinks which were pretty good but at 12 bucks each we all stopped at 1. The menu is broken down by seafood, meat and vegetarian. I had the trini soup with dumplings for starters, seafood ceviche, and the banana leaf fish. I was sad to hear the trini soup would be without the dumplings but ordered it anyways and was happy I did. It was very good, flavorful and hearty. My ceviche was a bit bland and didn't do anything for me. My banana leaf fish was pretty small, and sat atop a thin layer of purple potatoes. The flavors were good but nothing mind blowing. For 26 dollars I just expected more for in quantity and taste. The saving grace was the tres leches dessert...it was so delicious...and I don't even like tres leches! My friends had the steak bento box, whole chicken, and the chimichurri steak. They all enjoyed their food but I don't think everyone was thoroughly impressed. I like the street food vibe he has going on and I will probably come back to try the rest of the menu but so far I thought the food was average at best.",3.0
"Ive been wanting to go to this restaurant since the beginning of last year.  I knew of this place because of Chef Roble. I was a loyal fan of his show.  So I finally came here last night for my birthday with two friends.  The food was amazing. We ordered the Gai Yang Chicken, Trini Doubles, Korean Beef Tacos ( which my friend is still talking about...this a MUST order item if you come here) and the Churrasco Y Papas which was plated perfectly and the steak was amazing.  On the other hand, I did not like the pain killer drink that everyone raved about on here I was disappointed and the drink menu overall was limited. For dessert I ordered the apple pie suggested by the waiter, it was okay...but very very small. I would go again but not for a birthday.",4.0
"I go to Trinidad every year for doubles... no, really. Okay, and to see family and friends but doubles is the first stop. I heard this place had some legit doubles so I decided to try here for my birthday dinner. We arrived 30 minutes before last call and service was quick. I, of course, ordered the doubles and the tacos and my husband ordered the peri peri wings. We received the order and we were surprised that for $14 the peri peri wings were just that...wings. No side, nothing. But this is minor given that the service was excellent...our server was extremely attentive and did not rush us at all even though it was late. I was surprised that the doubles did in fact taste legit...minus the bara but it came close enough. I will definitely go again.",5.0
"Really really enjoyed the atmosphere. But if you eat here be prepared for eccentric flavor and styles. I Got the Bento Box Trio ($27) which included Beef, Duck and Cod prepared in a sauté form with plantain chips and avocado. I wouldn't get it again. Pretty expensive meal for a ""food truck from around the world theme"". In Williamsburg there are plenty of food trucks just standing around. Try them. Next time, if I return, I will try the Kobe Tacos. Other than what i ate: service was amazing. Atmosphere was spot on. Location is good. Prices are more high than moderate. I think I'll come back... But not for the Bento Trio Box.",3.0
"Great dining experience. Menu is super creative & has many heavy hitters from around the globe. We ordered doubles & corn (authentic & excellent).

Chef roble knows good food! Chicharon adobo was so good! The shark and bake was super delicious! They make a really great cilantro sauce. The pao de queijo was ok. Loved the wings! Will have to go back for more!,5.0
"Love Chef Roble so I was pretty excited to check out his restaurant! We made a reservation and then had to switch the time and they were very accommodating. The hostesses were sweet and our bartender was awesome. The actual restaurant is very nice and very well put together. Kudos to the designer. It has a great ambiance for dinner.I was excited at the concept of Streets because its dishes are inspired from 18 different countries. To start, I used the yelp app and got the free pai de queijo. I've never had it before, but it was okay. Very dense. For the rest of dinner my group ordered small plates and shared. The trini corn soup was amazing! Mmmmm. I also had the Roti Canai which had really good flavor. The spicy sauce for the Prawns had just enough kick and was flavorful. The fattoush was pretty much a salad. Decent, but nothing to write home about. Lastly, the bulgogi tacos (mushroom) were amazing!!! The kimchi aoli was absolutely delicious. I would definitely be back to explore the menu. I wonder how often they switch it up.",4.0

"Saw this on chef Roblè's ig page, and decided to give it a try... I love the decor! It's a take on different street food. The service is really good.We ordered the pão de queijo (Brazilian cheese bread) it tasted like cassava bread to me. I enjoyed it. Also ordered the adobo chicharrónes. Well seasoned but the skin wasn't crispy and that sort of threw me off. My date ordered the Seoul spicy octopus- really good def had a kick to it.. Didn't even taste like octopus if u ask me. It was delicious.I wanted to try the shark and bake sandwich. Hmm.. It was pretty bland for me.. It came with a mango chutney, tamarind sauce and shadon bennie sauce. If it weren't for the sauces this sandwich wouldn't cut it for me, especially since the original salt fish and bake is full of flavor. Date had the jerk pork with sweet plantain, slaw and greens on the side. I personally didn't like it. The pork was drenched in the sauce and wasn't really tasteful. Last but not least we had two desserts. The churros with a dark chocolate sauce, caramel, and an orange white chocolate sauce.. The sauces were delicious but I hated that the churros kinda broke apart lol. The chocomole- a chocolate mousse topped with I think whipped cream and a raspberry sauce came with fried tortillas that were dipped in a sweet batter and sprinkled with sugar.

The seafood that accompanied it....tender and juicy.

"This is my first review and for a well desired restaurant. We had the peri peri wings, corn soup (this was rich. U can taste the coconut milk & flavors. The dumplings were soft & moist), doubles (the sauces were great), catch of the day ( I had red snapper. It was seasoned well through the fish), steak & fries (I heard this was great too. I tasted the kale salad served with it and I'm trying to mimic the flavor at home. The quinoa on the kale is a nice touch. Fries were home made. Solid!), dal bahji (loved the flavor) and we took home curry chicken roti ( the curry was flavored with garlic & ginger & the roti was light & buttery) & Peri peri wings( I still have some sauce in the fridge). Everything was on point. Hats off to the chefs!!!!I took my boyfriend and friends here last Saturday. My boyfriend who is a vegetarian most of his life and a food sceptic, enjoyed all his dishes and he's looking forward to coming back. You have no idea how happy that makes me as a foodie. I'm a fan of chef Roble & hope one day to have him cook for us, until then, we'll be eating at streets.",5.0

"Streets BK definitely met our expectations. Although new, the restaurant seemed really organized and well run. Most importantly,  the food was delish! The idea of professional, diverse street food is interesting. As a starter, we shared the Bake and Shark, which was fresh and tasty. Being of Caribbean descent, bakes is something we're familiar with. Actually, Mom has perfected the recipe, which is her secret that everyone begs her to share. So, it means something when I say it was good. Not as puffy as the usual bake, but that makes sense as this flatter, more flaky style holds up better for a sandwich.  The shark was well seasoned. The dipping sauces were notably fresh and tasty. Warning: That homemade pepper sauce in the cork topped bottle is HOT!We also ordered the Bento style dish and the jerk pork. Both really good, although the jerk pork sauce was a wee bit salty. Although I look forward to trying another entree next time, I'm tempted to get the Bento again. It was that good. Our side of coconut jasmine rice was perfect!  Wrapped nicely in some sort of banana leaf, it was really warm and flavorful.Our waiter was friendly, comfortable and helpful to us first-timers. Loved how diverse both the diners and staff were.Overall, attractive space, friendly service and great food. We'll be returning.",5.0
"I first went with my Three friends and couldn't wait to take my Boyfriend! We are major foodies and he always finds the best restaurants in the City, we traveled from Manhattan for this and he was so amazed by how Good the food was ""I won the best restaurant"" My friends loved it and so did he we have a bunch of friends on social media ready to run there for the chance at that food. Peri Peri wings and the Steak with the Kale salad are to Die for!! Judging his expression the pain killer drink was a bit too. Can't wait to go back!!!!",5.0
I really like this place. Its very chic and has quite a bit of space. The service was great and everyone was very attentive. The food came out quick and was very fresh. The Peri Peri wings were great and so were the Korean Beef Tacos. But the Pao de Queijo were out of this world amazing! Like seriously amazing!,5.0
"We took my baby (now 18 year old) brother here for his farewell dinner, as he heads off to college. We were warmly greeted by the maitre d' and seated promptly. I ordered the painkiller, which was amazing, and did somewhat dull the pain of my brother leaving for college (yes, i know, i'm dramatic)! My wife ordered some whiskey drink, not sure how much she liked hers, because I was drowning my pain.We got two shark sandwiches (SO GOOD) but my mom texted to tell me sharks are endangered! why does my mother try to ruin such a perfect sandwich? We also had the peri peri chicken wings, which were the melt in your mouth wings, and not the crispy fried skin wings. I loved them and all the sauces that they came with. When the waitstaff warns you that one of the sauce is SUPER hot, take them seriously!We also had the chicharones, which just melted in your moth, but are super heavy. like eating chunks of fried butter. Not a huge fan of the malt vinegar it came with, but i dipped mine with the cilantro sauce that came with the shark sandwich.We were super awkwardly full after, and could not even attempt to eat dessert!",5.0
"My boyfriend and I went here for our anniversary dinner and absolutely loved it ! We started off with drinks and tried the Signature Painkiller drink. So good ! It is a must try . For dinner we went with the chicken roti, bake and shark , and the mariscadas seafood stew . We shared all the plates and were stuffed , but with just enough room to try the Guinness chocolate cake ( from the servers description sounded like it would be overwhelmingly sweet , but it an amazing combination for chocolate lovers) and apple pie egg rolls .  We enjoyed EVERYTHING! The Caribbean aspect of this place is on point and reminded me a lot of my families cooking. The portions were perfect , and I would say that you can definitely get full off of a slew or  the small plates . I don't recall our waitresses name , but she was helpful and attentive . This place is worth the trip to Brooklyn , for sure .",5.0
"Had dinner here last night with the wife. Lamar was our server . The service was excellent from beginning to end. We had the doubles and Mexican corn to start....best doubles I have ever had, and the corn was delicious. We then had the catch of the day and fish in the banana leaf. 5 stars on both accounts . We then finished it off with the Apple pie and soursop con tres leches. The soursop was my favorite but both were delicious!. Now I must say they are a little pricey but when you consider the quality of food, service and atmosphere it was well worth it, mind you we did choose some of the higher priced items on the menu. I highly recommend this place. To top it off I was offered10% off the next time I dine.",5.0
"Great place, awesome concept of serving street food from different parts of the world. The service was excellent and the food was flavorful and accurate to their home country flavor. The only thing I could think to say as a critism is that the prices are bit high when the cost of most these food items are quite low, but that is expected for the Williamsburg area. Still a great experience will definitely go back there again.",4.0
"Food: Pretty much everything was a disappointment. The dishes were neither authentic, to our knowledge, nor improved upon. I know they wanted to charge restaurant prices for foods that are usually cheap so they fancied them up. Its just that none of them ended up being very successful. Some of them didnt have much flavor. Others were overly sweet.Service: No complaints. Our server, Aidan, was very nice.Decor: Think modern, urban brewpub decor. Cement floors. Faux applebox type wood detailing. Large space, though. More tables than NYC usual.",3.0
"This is my first review and for a well desired restaurant. We had the peri peri wings, corn soup (this was rich. U can taste the coconut milk & flavors. The dumplings were soft & moist), doubles (the sauces were great), catch of the day ( I had red snapper. It was seasoned well through the fish), steak & fries (I heard this was great too. I tasted the kale salad served with it and I'm trying to mimic the flavor at home. The quinoa on the kale is a nice touch. Fries were home made. Solid!), dal bahji (loved the flavor) and we took home curry chicken roti ( the curry was flavored with garlic & ginger & the roti was light & buttery) & Peri peri wings( I still have some sauce in the fridge). Everything was on point. Hats off to the chefs!!!!I took my boyfriend and friends here last Saturday. My boyfriend who is a vegetarian most of his life and a food sceptic, enjoyed all his dishes and he's looking forward to coming back. You have no idea how happy that makes me as a foodie. I'm a fan of chef Roble & hope one day to have him cook for us, until then, we'll be eating at streets.",5.0
Love the variety of food! From the Cuban Sammy to the shark sandwich and chicken wings...sooooo good. Just at one place and one setting you get to enjoy food from around the And I love the decor and the cleanliness of the restaurant along with the friendly staff. Coming back fasho!,5.0
"Streets BK definitely met our expectations. Although new, the restaurant seemed really organized and well run. Most importantly,  the food was delish! The idea of professional, diverse street food is interesting. As a starter, we shared the Bake and Shark, which was fresh and tasty. Being of Caribbean descent, bakes is something we're familiar with. Actually, Mom has perfected the recipe, which is her secret that everyone begs her to share. So, it means something when I say it was good. Not as puffy as the usual bake, but that makes sense as this flatter, more flaky style holds up better for a sandwich.  The shark was well seasoned.

"I came her for my birthday this past weekend with my girlfriend. As a chef myself and a fan of both chef Roble and chef Arthur I had extremely high expectations. First I loved the service, very attentive and our waiter was able to keep up with my girlfriend and I playful banter. Second, we ordered the roti canai, doubles, duo prawns and pato de whatever lol to start.The roti was delicious, perfect not overly spicy.The duo prawns were huge, and delicious. Both sauces were excellent and well seasoned.The doubles were great. Not usually a huge fan and I'm trunk but I throughly enjoyed them.The cheese bread I can do without. It was free though(thanks yelp)For entrees I ordered the chili lobster and my girlfriend had the fish in banana leaf.My chili lobster was delicious but it wasn't the chili flavoring I was expecting or looking for. It was a little on the sweet side.The fish in banana leaf was flavorful and good nothing to rave about but she enjoyed it. Chef Arthur came over and presented my dessert and we chatted for a while. Much respect for that. The only issue I had was as chef was talking to me he presented us with the specials after our meal. Our waiter didn't even inform us of the specials!!!! I was turned off by that because I would of definitely ordered a few of them. Other than that I would definitely go back. The food was great.",4.0
"This place is IT! The food. I ordered the Costa Rican breakfast which included some flour tortillas, steak, scrambled eggs, mixed black rice and beans and some plantains. Boy was this on point. The steak was marinated so deliciously, the plantains were sweet and hot, the tortillas were hot (though a bit thin) and the rice and beans were just right. I put everything minus the plantains in the tortilla and ate it that way. I'm Honduran and put hot sauce on a lot things (I could've used some hot sauce here) but I didn't ask for it because I wanted to taste the food for what it was--and it was good. Next time, I'm asking for the hot sauce. My friend barely nibbled on her Mexican street corn and so me being one to not let food go to waste, I ate it. OMG---so good! I can't. I need more. I'm going back for more. In addition to this, I had a watermelon puree vodka based drink that did not disappoint. It definitely didn't lack vodka and was super refreshing. The atmosphere is a mix of rustic and modern. I went on a Sunday around noon and besides the other two parties, we had the place to ourselves. We received excellent customer service by our server and the other employees.",5.0

"Streets BK is by far one of the best restaurants I have been to in a long time. We ordered several small plates that were so delicious - South African Peri Peri Wings, Bulgogi Tacos, Roti Canai, doubles and malt fries and they were alll delicious.!!!

"I have been terrible with my yelping lately so this should help me get back in the groove. I went to Streets last Sunday for girls night out. We had 7pm reservations and we got there a bit early. We were seated immediately and to our surprise it was fairly empty. Maybe because it was a beautiful Sunday with gorgeous weather. Any who about our experience....We ordered different appetizers or small plates as they refer to it. I had the Ceviche Escuatoriano (I am sure I spelled that wrong). I enjoyed it! It's shrimp, snapper, and calamari served cold with a little bag of chips. The shrimp was whole and cold almost cocktail style while the calamari and snapper was diced into a blend. It had a nice chilled citrus flavor. My entreé was the jerk pork. Now normally I would try something different but I'm trying to get my boyfriend to try different foods because I was going to bring him home a little doggie bag. So jerk pork it was. He has to start somewhere. The pork was so tender when I lifted the fork it broke. It's not your typical west indian jerk flavor. Intially It's very soft and subtle and then at the end it's a kick of spice. A BIG KICK! The plantains were cooked to my liking and sweet. The only negative I have is about the dish is the coleslaw or whatever it was served with it. Too salty. I didnt even want dessert but our waitress described a dish that was apple pie inside of an egg roll. I would order that again. A nice sweet balance with some green sauce. The drink I ordered was the blackberry lemonade and it tasted just like juice until I realized I had a little buzz. All of my friends enjoyed their dishes. They ordered Mariscadas, Bake and Shark, Trini Corn Soup, Brazilian Rice, Malt Vinegar Fries (I would recommend skipping that) and our free Pao De Quiejo thanks to yelp. Overall great experience. Out waitress was very helpful, punctual and gorgeous I might add. I'll be going there again to try other things. Cool vibes, great food and nice decor.",4.0
"Can I leave 6 stars?We came for lunch on a Wednesday so it was pretty empty, but the food was phenomenal. We got the whole fish tacos (take small bites and chew slowly as there are bones), and it was amazing! Also, the peri peri wings are recommended, and that's coming from a girl who doesn't really like buffalo wings.This place is huge, so I really hope it does well. It was beautifully decorated as well, with that very trendy hipster vibe, and I hesitate to say hipster. But really, I was impressed that literally every detail of this place was lovely, from the lighting fixtures, to the bar design, to the soap in the bathroom. It looks like a interior designer went over it with a fine tooth comb before they open. Also, every single employee looks like they could be model. Not kidding, they are all gorgeous. The bar, kitchen, and staff are all really great. Fantastic happy hour margaritas and a nice beer selection -- I kinda hope they start carrying Tusker, which is a Kenyan beer. Our server (Malissa?) was incredibly knowledgeable about the menu, which is all different types of street food from all over the world.

Needless to say it was AMAZING!!!!The steak was perfectly cooked (I like medium) and flavorful. They also gave this sauce on the side. You didn't need it, but it was delicious too and had a little kick. The risotto side had a great texture and mixed in with seafood.I also had the apple pie a la mode for dessert. It took a little long to come out, but I think that's because they bake it upon ordering in a small personalized pan.

"What a find. Excellent top to bottom. Visited Streets this past Wednesday evening. Received a warm, professional greeting upon entering. Cheerful, courteous waiter was quickly table side and did a nice job explaining the menu. A question he couldn't answer was followed by a visit from the chef. Very nice touch. Draft beer selection was good. Lebanese Fattoush was just a tad harsh as I thought the mint and kale could have been chopped a bit more but that's a minor complaint. Overall it was tasty, refreshing and perfectly set up the other dishes.Peri Peri Wings were simply bursting with flavor and the texture was a perfect balance of tender inside and crunchy outside. South African chilies gave it a nice bit of heat at the finish. Portion was generous. Well done.Jerk Pork was delicious. Tender, complex and served piping hot. (kitchen was on its game). Plantains and especially a delicious, slightly citrusy slaw rounded out and excellent dish.The Mariscadas was also very good. Perhaps the best seafood broth I've tasted. Didn't know the Portuguese used coconut milk. It was a bit salty but that's a small quibble. Generous serving. Will upgrade my rating to 5 stars if my next visit is as impressive as my first.",4.0
"Am I too easily impressed? Maybe. But I honestly loved this place! The food, the drinks, the staff/service all made this such a pleasant experience.I went on a pretty busy Saturday night and we waited probably over 45 minutes for our table. Not a problem as we were able to sit/stand at the bar. I had some kind of sorrel cocktail and I loved it. The menu has quite a variety of dishes, but it's not terribly overwhelming. Our table ordered peri peri wings, roti, mariscadas, a big 'ole steak (can't remember the name), lobster roll, bulgogi tacos. Everything was really good! There was a mix up with one of our orders and they waived the charge for it. Can't wait to go back and try some other stuff!",4.0
"Had a late brunch at Streets this afternoon and it was one of the best casual meal experiences ever. The restaurant is spacious with easy access by subway or waterway. The staff all seemed genuinely happy, attentive and prompt. We had all 4 of the hot dogs on the menu, trying a piece of one each, the Lebanese fatoush was fresh and clean with a great flavor mix and the peri peri wings were the tastiest ever. Nice, plump meat that just fell off the bone. Amazing.

"Had an absolutely fantastic brunch at Streets. Very eclectic menu. Had the Costa Rican Breakfast and the Plantain Foster French Toast. Both were scrumptious! And add in a side of Rosti - a terrific side instead of home fries. The wait staff were all friendly, Daniel was a terrific server! Can't wait for a chance to go back",5.0
"Love the decor and atmosphere. Service is great. Perfect place to eat family style or to take a date. So many different foods on the menu.

"What a find. Excellent top to bottom. Visited Streets this past Wednesday evening. Received a warm, professional greeting upon entering. Cheerful, courteous waiter was quickly table side and did a nice job explaining the menu. A question he couldn't answer was followed by a visit from the chef. Very nice touch. Draft beer selection was good. Lebanese Fattoush was just a tad harsh as I thought the mint and kale could have been chopped a bit more but that's a minor complaint. Overall it was tasty, refreshing and perfectly set up the other dishes.Peri Peri Wings were simply bursting with flavor and the texture was a perfect balance of tender inside and crunchy outside. South African chilies gave it a nice bit of heat at the finish. Portion was generous. Well done.Jerk Pork was delicious. Tender, complex and served piping hot. (kitchen was on its game). Plantains and especially a delicious, slightly citrusy slaw rounded out and excellent dish.The Mariscadas was also very good. Perhaps the best seafood broth I've tasted. Didn't know the Portuguese used coconut milk. It was a bit salty but that's a small quibble. Generous serving. Will upgrade my rating to 5 stars if my next visit is as impressive as my first.",4.0
"Am I too easily impressed? Maybe. But I honestly loved this place! The food, the drinks, the staff/service all made this such a pleasant experience.I went on a pretty busy Saturday night and we waited probably over 45 minutes for our table. Not a problem as we were able to sit/stand at the bar. I had some kind of sorrel cocktail and I loved it. The menu has quite a variety of dishes, but it's not terribly overwhelming. Our table ordered peri peri wings, roti, mariscadas, a big 'ole steak (can't remember the name), lobster roll, bulgogi tacos. Everything was really good! There was a mix up with one of our orders and they waived the charge for it. Can't wait to go back and try some other stuff!",4.0
"Had a late brunch at Streets this afternoon and it was one of the best casual meal experiences ever. The restaurant is spacious with easy access by subway or waterway. The staff all seemed genuinely happy, attentive and prompt. We had all 4 of the hot dogs on the menu, trying a piece of one each, the Lebanese fatoush was fresh and clean with a great flavor mix and the peri peri wings were the tastiest ever. Nice, plump meat that just fell off the bone. Amazing.

I really really wanted to LOVE this place. The restaurant looks great! I came in there for brunch and the best thing I ate was the mexican corn. Everything else was okay.We ordered:Mexican Corn - BEST!!!CACHAPA - wasn't that great.PERI PERI WINGS - good; not too spicyADOBO CHICHARRÓNES - it was ok. I'm filipino so I'm used to this being fried really good to a point it's crispy. Maybe I'm a little biased. My friend didn't like it.GRILLED WHOLE FISH TACO - this was really good.Water -  it didn't come with ice which was very weird to me. We had to ask for it! I'll definitely come back for the lunch or dinner menu to check out the rest.,4.0
Ehh not bad but not good either. The grilled chicken wings were burnt. The octopus too spicy ... Maybe it was just an off night for the chefsWoke up with a horrible after taste. Baking soda and toothpaste aren't helping. I am not trying to be so harsh but my food experience was horrible. The server was attentive and the decor/location is awesome.Again my 1 star is for the food only.,1.0
"Came to this restaurant with two friends of mine. One is from Barbados and the other from Jamaica. They were so looking forward to checking for authenticity of the Caribbean dishes and they are super fun foodies to be around!Started off with going to the bar because my busy, exhausted friend made reservations for the wrong night. This was serendipitous because this led me to the delicious pickle back cocktail while we waited. It had a perfect blend of alcohol, pickle juice, and a slight kick...loved it. The bartenders were great too. Super friendly and funny. Apparently,  the pickle back cocktail recipe had just changed. People used to think it tasted like ""a grandpa"". Spicy and garlicky with a hint of pickle. The new recipe sure is on point though.We get seated, by a lovely hostess,  and start looking over the menu. I order the clementine cilantro mojito, a refreshing and light pairing for the all star meal I was about to partake in. We were having such a hard time choosing what we wanted, looking at all the tasty dishes, and being hungry. It was decided to order a little over a quarter of the menu and share everything. So glad we did...my husband was too because he got the doggie bag when I got home.The following was ordered:*got the free cheese biscuit you get for checking in on yelp...not good. It was chewy and not very cheesy.  Ate just a bite to try it, and not to waste the space in my tummy.Mexican Street Corn- so good, my friends were saying something to me while I was eating it, and because I was so into it, I didn't hear a word they said!Trini Corn soup - I had a spoonful. It's very good and my friends said it reminds them of home.Doubles - legit and delicious, the sauces are so good with it. My favorite with the doubles was the tamarind sauce.Chicharon - fried pork skin and fat. Crispy pork with melt in your mouth fat... So so so good.Jerk pork - literally teared up a little, because this was so tender and perfectly seasoned that I exclaimed,  I will remember this pork for the rest of my life. My friends agreed.Lobster roll- this was good, but I've had better rolls...I'm a lobster roll fiend, especially in the summer. Had many a lobster roll.Bulgogi Beef tacos - these were delicious. The seasoning seamed authentic and the veggies\ toppings all made sense.Hot dog trio - all three hot dogs were delicious. The hot dog with the duck confit slaw was unique decadence and I think my favorite was the one with caramelized onions.Bake and shark - at this point I was super stuffed... This dish was still so tasty and from what my friends said, very legit. Must try this when you go. The shark was tender, like tender\moist chicken and the bake (fried bread) was the prefect compliment to it. I threw some tamarind sauce on my two bite piece too. Wheew,  ok. So that was quite a meal,  but since the food was so good we actually considered dessert. David, our awesome waiter,  told us about them and it was honestly tempting, eventhough I felt like if I moved,  I'd probably explode. The manager was super cool and informative too when she came over to the table. She explained that chefs were sent around the world to learn how to perfect these street foods,  making them as authentic as possible. Super awesome idea...they must have visited a few grandmothers houses because all the food was the truth.We ended up not getting the dessert, this time. I'm definitely going to be back. So grateful for such an amazing culinary experience.",4.0

Nothing worst than a waiter not knowing how the food is made or what's in it. I ordered doubles and bake and shark. Now since I've been to Trinidad, tasted doubles from Curepe to Ali's in Brooklyn, these were on point, can I say maybe even better?! The bake and shark was also very flavorful! We also had the wings which were good. The drinks were strong and tasted good as well. I judge bathrooms too lol it was very modern and clean. Streets is Highly recommended!",5.0
"Despite having to drive over to Williamsburg after work on a six-day work week, it turned out to be one of the best post-work nights ever. We were a group of 13 (9 adults and 4 children under the age of 5), gathered together for a birthday celebration. Despite having to tend to the other patrons, our awesome waitress Yolli and the other waitstaff at Streets totally made our night! Fellow parents can relate with the challenges of dining outside with your young ones - from not being able eat, chasing them around the table, bringing them to the bathroom, and whatever else may come up. Not to mention the weary eyes of some of the waitstaff. You won't find that at Streets. They went through great lengths to cater to us and especially the little ones. Knowing there might be some spills at the table, she offered us water in to-go cups, which were somehow magically spill-proof! I'm sure one of the toddlers had dropped the cup on the floor several times and none led to a spill. Sadly to say, the adults had no such luck with their beverages. Other highlights besides the exceptional service was the food. As others have mentioned, the wings are awesome, grilled corn always wins and the fried pork bellies are delicious! We had many different entrées (all of the meats were tender), but we believe the lamb was the winner! Regretfully we did not take a picture of the dish, but it was seriously bigger than one's head. Will hope to come back again, maybe next time I'll be smarter and park further from this restaurant so I can walk off all the food I couldn't stop myself from devouring.",5.0

"I've been on a hiatus from Yelping, but the experience we recently had at Streets has unfortunately made my first post since being back, not a good one. As many yelpers have stated, the concept of Streets is a great one...but something very difficult to execute given the variety of the menu and the 'something from everywhere, for everyone' approach.That said, I cannot say I was impressed with the food, the service, or the ambience. We were a group of 8 and sampled many dishes on the menu. While the octopus and bulgogi tacos were fine, the udon noodles were terrible. $15 for a box of noodles in a tiny white take out container? Not to mention, the noodles were soggy, and overly salted (and this is coming from someone that has a pretty high tolerance for salty food). We also ordered the fish in a  banana leaf, which they got wrong, and gave us lobster instead. They actually even charged us for the wrong dish at the end of the meal, and we had to tell them to take it off the bill since we didn't eat it. Overall, the idea of street food and a very varied menu is just very difficult to execute, and it showed. They are trying to do too much, be too much, have too much on the menu, be precious (tiny white containers, etc.) - but it just falls very flat since the food we ordered was just not good. There was not one outstanding dish, and the prices were high we thought for the quality and quantities.In terms of the decor, it's not intimate, at all. It's a very large restaurant and has a weird vibe.  Reminded me a bit of the vibe at the restaurant Sea up in North Williamsburg (batchelorette groups, large birthday parties, etc). Not my scene. Not typical Brooklyn.Lastly on the service. The servers we had seemed completely clueless on the menu. I asked how the udon was and the response i got was ""its eh, I don't do vegetarian well"". I'm all for being honest, but she could have at least told me what to get instead before moving on to the next person. She just seemed completely disinterred and again, not very impressive.I hate to leave a negative review, and will only do so if it is absolutely necessary. Somehow it baffles me that this restaurant has 4 stars -- so I am compelled to tell about our 'not 4 star' experience.",1.0
"Great verity on the menu, I believe the waitress told us 18 different countries are represented. A little on the pricey side but you do leave full from the portion of food served.

Overall a great experience, I suggest using open table to reserve on a busy weekend night.",5.0

This was the BEST Trini style corn soup I've had, hands downx and Yes, it had dumpling in it too. I was pleasantly surprised.

"So I walk into a nice bright(well lit) location and my guest and I were greeted by a friendly/bubbly hostess. We sat at the bar as we waited for our table to be prepared. Took a look at the drink list and I wanted to try every last cocktail. We decided to have the pain killer, the Flavors of sorrel, pineapple juice, coconut cream, nutmeg and rum blended sooooo well we had to order 3 more. We were seated rather quickly and my date had a real cozy chair.       For appetizers we started off with Mexican corn, doubles and a 3 meat taco special (which consisted of cow tongue, pig ear, and rabbit). The corn was grilled and had a cheese and Cajun seasoning coating to die for. The Flavors of the tacos were to immaculate. The spices and mayo on the rabbit taco made love to my tastebuds. The guacamole on the cow tongue was soo smooth, meat wasn't chew which was awesome. Since im allergic to pork my friend had the pig ears, she said it was a bit salt and had too many onions on it. It was our first time having doubles, but being that I have a lot of Trini friends I had to try it. They were amazing, the curry the chic peas are mad in are delicious. I had to ruin a quarter of my double with scotch bunet hot sauce, it was a green sauce they brought out with the doubles and the server said its a lil spicy and goes with the doubles. I put it on and it woke me up with a nice smooth flavor....then the heat kicked in lol.           Lastly our main courses came to the table. She had lamb and I had the whole chicken. I will tell you this they are not cheap with the portions and Flavors. The lamb comes off the bone with such ease, it comes with hummus, rice and kale in a big pottery bowl. My whole chicken came in a wooden cutting board and had a mixes sautéed veggies. These two dishes blew my mind.       At the end of our marvelous eating experience we were greeted by the head chef. He explained each dish we had also apologizing to my date for too many onions which was overly nice of him (because I wouldn't do it, she's a picky eater lol). He also explained his background being from St. Thomas and the owner being from Trinidad and always test their cooking to make sure its authentic. I'm a foodie and a big home/firehouse chef and it meant a lot to me that he took time to come listen to our input/praise of his cooking. This is my new favorite restaurant in all of NYC I will be back this Sunday for brunch as I was invited by the chef. Only downfall is parking besides that Streets is a homerun.",5.0
"Streets is one of the newest most talked about restaurants in Williamsburg so I decided to try it out on Saturday. We arrived there at 4 and they just finished brunch, so we hung around at the bar until 5 when they were starting the dinner menu. At the bar we had a drink called the painkiller that had sorrel and nutmeg in it. I don't know if it because I'm West Indian but it was one of the best drinks I've ever had.  When we got seated at 5pm it kind of took a while for the waiter to come and take our order because I swear exactly at 5pm, 50 people showed up.  Anyways we ordered the Peri Peri chicken wings, the  steak Bulgogi tacos and the fried chicken feet. Yes, I said friend chicken feet. I never thought I would eat chicken feet while I'm out for dinner... Just thought it was something only my grandmother put in soup for me when I'm sick.  The food took about 12 minutes to come out. I didn't care for the Bulgogi tacos, didn't like the Peri Peri wings at all, BUT THOSE CHICKEN FEET?!?!?! They were delicious!!!!!!!!!! They were well seasoned and had this great sauce to go along with it. For dessert i had apple pie eggsrolls. When they came out they looked like / eggsrolls but the inside was warm apples and cinnamon. It was a very tasty. I would go there over and over just for those fried chicken feet, the painkiller drink and the apple pie eggrolls.Tip- If you check in on Yelp while you are there you can get free Brazilian Cheesy Bread",4.0
"This place has so much promise---but unfortunately it fell a little flat for me. The menu looks so interesting, as do the cocktails! We had a reservation, and when we showed up they ushered us to the bar even though the restaurant was pretty much empty. We got drinks at the bar, which were just ok. My bf had a tom collins which wasn't mixed properly - it is an easy enough drink to make, so it was a bummer they couldn't get it right. We sat down to dinner---we ordered the PÃO DE QUEIJO to start (recommended by our waitress). It was basically just cheesy doughy bread, nothing special. I ordered the BULGOGI TACOS for my main, and they were actually really really good (I would definitely order these for takeout). My bf ordered the DAL BHAJI, and he was very unimpressed. He loves indian food, and he thought this was a bland version of what is usually a really tasty dish. Maybe they are trying to do something different with this dish, but unfortunately it was unsuccessful. The overall vibe of the place is also a little off---it seems like they are trying too hard to be a cool restaurant, and it feels a little contrived. For a place that specializes in street food from around the world, I was hoping it would feel a little more ""street"" in there---more low key but cool. I don't think I will be revisiting this restaurant any time soon, but I will definitely order takeout to try some of the other dishes.",3.0
"STREETS is hands down one of the best restaurants I've had during my stay in NYC. Coming from CA,  we don't have shark meat on our menus, so Streets is a definite must when I'm in the city. Their Shark meat sandwich has got to be the best sandwich I've ever had. The meat was fried to perfection and the bread was toasted to perfection. Two perfections made an amazing sandwich worth every bite. Besides the shark sandwich, I also recommend the Da Nang shrimp dish, Cuban sandwich, and thier chicken wings. And if you love spicy,  you MUST ask for their homemade spicy sauce. It's like a mango habanero but better. I'm making myself drool just thinking about it. Haha. I've tried most of the items on the menu and none disappointed me. I'm definitely going to come back and try the rest of the menu. Attentive service and amazing food=1 amazing restaurant. What else can u ask for?",5.0
"I've been on a hiatus from Yelping, but the experience we recently had at Streets has unfortunately made my first post since being back, not a good one. As many yelpers have stated, the concept of Streets is a great one...but something very difficult to execute given the variety of the menu and the 'something from everywhere, for everyone' approach.That said, I cannot say I was impressed with the food, the service, or the ambience. We were a group of 8 and sampled many dishes on the menu. While the octopus and bulgogi tacos were fine, the udon noodles were terrible. $15 for a box of noodles in a tiny white take out container? Not to mention, the noodles were soggy, and overly salted (and this is coming from someone that has a pretty high tolerance for salty food). We also ordered the fish in a  banana leaf, which they got wrong, and gave us lobster instead. They actually even charged us for the wrong dish at the end of the meal, and we had to tell them to take it off the bill since we didn't eat it. Overall, the idea of street food and a very varied menu is just very difficult to execute, and it showed. They are trying to do too much, be too much, have too much on the menu, be precious (tiny white containers, etc.) - but it just falls very flat since the food we ordered was just not good. There was not one outstanding dish, and the prices were high we thought for the quality and quantities.In terms of the decor, it's not intimate, at all. It's a very large restaurant and has a weird vibe.  Reminded me a bit of the vibe at the restaurant Sea up in North Williamsburg (batchelorette groups, large birthday parties, etc). Not my scene. Not typical Brooklyn.Lastly on the service. The servers we had seemed completely clueless on the menu. I asked how the udon was and the response i got was ""its eh, I don't do vegetarian well"". I'm all for being honest, but she could have at least told me what to get instead before moving on to the next person. She just seemed completely disinterred and again, not very impressive.I hate to leave a negative review, and will only do so if it is absolutely necessary. Somehow it baffles me that this restaurant has 4 stars -- so I am compelled to tell about our 'not 4 star' experience.",1.0
"Great verity on the menu, I believe the waitress told us 18 different countries are represented. A little on the pricey side but you do leave full from the portion of food served. The restaurant had a great ambiance, the music if I'm not mistaken was all Caribbean instrumentals which added to the easy going vibe. Overall a great experience, I suggest using open table to reserve on a busy weekend night.",5.0

Great time here at brunch. Went for a late brunch on Saturday of Mother's Day weekend. Restaurant wasn't crowded. Or waiter Daniel was very attentive . The food was amazing.

"Awesome concept, excellent food, great service. They serve healthier versions of international street foods yet they still manage to maintain great flavor. This was the BEST Trini style corn soup I've had, hands downx and Yes, it had dumpling in it too. I was pleasantly surprised. I also had the lobster roll with malt vinegar fries that won me over as a fan of salt and vinegar chips. My friend had the fish in banana leaf which was awesome as well. I would definitely be a returning customer.",5.0
"So I walk into a nice bright(well lit) location and my guest and I were greeted by a friendly/bubbly hostess. We sat at the bar as we waited for our table to be prepared. Took a look at the drink list and I wanted to try every last cocktail. We decided to have the pain killer, the Flavors of sorrel, pineapple juice, coconut cream, nutmeg and rum blended sooooo well we had to order 3 more. We were seated rather quickly and my date had a real cozy chair.       For appetizers we started off with Mexican corn, doubles and a 3 meat taco special (which consisted of cow tongue, pig ear, and rabbit). The corn was grilled and had a cheese and Cajun seasoning coating to die for. The Flavors of the tacos were to immaculate. The spices and mayo on the rabbit taco made love to my tastebuds. The guacamole on the cow tongue was soo smooth, meat wasn't chew which was awesome. Since im allergic to pork my friend had the pig ears, she said it was a bit salt and had too many onions on it. It was our first time having doubles, but being that I have a lot of Trini friends I had to try it. They were amazing, the curry the chic peas are mad in are delicious. I had to ruin a quarter of my double with scotch bunet hot sauce, it was a green sauce they brought out with the doubles and the server said its a lil spicy and goes with the doubles. I put it on and it woke me up with a nice smooth flavor....then the heat kicked in lol.           Lastly our main courses came to the table. She had lamb and I had the whole chicken. I will tell you this they are not cheap with the portions and Flavors. The lamb comes off the bone with such ease, it comes with hummus, rice and kale in a big pottery bowl. My whole chicken came in a wooden cutting board and had a mixes sautéed veggies. These two dishes blew my mind.       At the end of our marvelous eating experience we were greeted by the head chef.

"Still sitting in the restaurant as I write this and I have to say that I was impressed by the authenticity and originality of the dishes we ordered.

The doubles were tastier than the ones we had on the street in Trinidad. The sauces were addicting and the dough was soft, spongy, and flavorful. The Sicilian arancini balls were pleasing to the eye and taste buds. They offered a nice crunchy outside soft on the inside with dark squid ink rice & calamari shrimp center. I doused the balls in the sweet sauce and was in heaven. And the shark & bake just rocked. All the fixins like on the beach in Maracas Bay. You must get this. Enjoy!",4.0

"Original, brilliant concept of mixing street food with gourmet fusion, Streets executed on this idea flawlessly sans any of the Williamsburg pretentiousness.

The decor was a little overwrought; the mural on the back wall seemed to be trying too hard. Still, the food is amazing and I plan on going back a lot.

"This place was amazing, the staff is very friendly and the wood decor is unique. The menu has a small variety from Spanish, Asian and West Indies dishes. I came in with a party of four and by the time our entrees arrived we had a multi cultural feast. I had tender Korean BBQ steak tacos(Brilliant), one person had a Shark Bake sandwich that came with spicy pepper sauce and sweet tamarind sauce which I enjoyed sampling over my taco. The two other dishes were Prongs with a succulent pepper and onion sauce (the sauce alone was boss)and the other was chicken roti. No complaints. Now the dessert was to die for, our party raved about the Tres Leches  and chocolate cake with Guinness topped with baileys cream (Wow!!!). The coconut cheesecake was delicious and its presentation was unique which was a turnover stuffed with cheesecake topped with honey( absolutely delicious). We were all very pleased and plan to come again, Thank you Streets for great food and great service!!",5.0
"I was excited to try Streets since it's just around the corner from me. First the positives - the service was friendly, no issues there. The interior is a little confused, I liked the rope chandeliers though. The menu is all over the place. Latin America, South East Asia, India, Korea, Japan, Caribbean. I get the street food concept, but I think it would be a lot better to have a narrower focus - maybe just Latin America and Caribbean for example. We need a good place like that in the neighborhood.We ordered the Peri Peri Wings, the Doubles and the Bento. - The wings were just bad - they tasted like they had been pre-cooked and reheated. It's very hard to overcook wings, but they seem to have succeeded. The flavor was just ok. - The Doubles were fine - nothing special, no major issues. - The bento was awful. The Crispy duck part was not crispy and had a nasty over garlicky flavor (that lingered in my mouth the rest of the night until I got to some mouthwash), the short ribs had no lemon grass flavor (as billed) and were just stodgy. The Bacalao tasted like someone had mixed tomato ketchup with it. Even the pickled cucumbers were nasty. I would avoid this dish at all costs.As always, it may have been just the choices we made (from the very very large menu), I'm sad to say I won't be going back unless they do a major overhaul of the food.",2.0
"I've lived in the neighborhood for 7 years and i love this addition in the southside.

Now for the food...I've traveled quite a bit and there are always days that I am wishing I had some legit hot sauce or West Indian dumplings. And boy, did they deliver!!! I practically had every part of the pig last night. The jerk pork butt...the adodo lechon(Filipino adobo flavored lechon! OMG!!!)...and last but certainly not least, the bento box, which comes complete with every animal you can think of and some steamed buns. lol!THANK YOU! THANK YOU!

Was very excited to try this new restaurant however we were kinda dissatisfied with the food we ordered the prawns where lackluster ... The sauce was flavorless n fell short of our expectations . We also ordered the mojito which tasted like orange juice and the manager offered to add more rum which helped but the thrill was gone. We also ordered the gyang chicken which we enjoyed the sauce was tasty and innovative.  We also ordered the hot dogs which I must say was the highlight of our dinning experience. The service was impeccable our server Aiden from Ireland was so attentive funny and accommodating we loved him!!! And the decor was beautiful ... I wish Streets all the best but they definitely need to iron out some of the kinks ...However the concept is great though and I'm sure it will be successful,3.0

The two other dishes were Prongs with a succulent pepper and onion sauce (the sauce alone was boss)and the other was chicken roti. No complaints. Now the dessert was to die for, our party raved about the Tres Leches  and chocolate cake with Guinness topped with baileys cream (Wow!!!). The coconut cheesecake was delicious and its presentation was unique which was a turnover stuffed with cheesecake topped with honey( absolutely delicious). We were all very pleased and plan to come again, Thank you Streets for great food and great service!!",5.0
"I was excited to try Streets since it's just around the corner from me. First the positives - the service was friendly, no issues there. The interior is a little confused, I liked the rope chandeliers though. The menu is all over the place. Latin America, South East Asia, India, Korea, Japan, Caribbean. I get the street food concept, but I think it would be a lot better to have a narrower focus - maybe just Latin America and Caribbean for example. We need a good place like that in the neighborhood.We ordered the Peri Peri Wings, the Doubles and the Bento. - The wings were just bad - they tasted like they had been pre-cooked and reheated. It's very hard to overcook wings, but they seem to have succeeded. The flavor was just ok. - The Doubles were fine - nothing special, no major issues. - The bento was awful. The Crispy duck part was not crispy and had a nasty over garlicky flavor (that lingered in my mouth the rest of the night until I got to some mouthwash), the short ribs had no lemon grass flavor (as billed) and were just stodgy. The Bacalao tasted like someone had mixed tomato ketchup with it. Even the pickled cucumbers were nasty. I would avoid this dish at all costs.As always, it may have been just the choices we made (from the very very large menu), I'm sad to say I won't be going back unless they do a major overhaul of the food.",2.0
"I've lived in the neighborhood for 7 years and i love this addition in the southside. Love the interior and the fact that it's easy for a big group. we had 8 in our party and service was great. in our table, we got the mexican corn, adobe chicarons, pork butt, cuban sandwiches, seoul spicy octopus, bento box, tacos and of course the hot dogs. nice size servings and no complaints from anyone at the table.i would come back every day for the hot dogs and the tres leches dessert if i wasn't supposed to be on a ""diet""",5.0
"I am taken away by this spot. FINALLY, a breath of fresh air in the culinary world. The décor is chic and cozy at the same time. Very well curated. They give you a sense of travel without making it hokey. Hats off to the design team behind the setup. Everything flows so well. The drinks...I literally drank everything. And what ever I had a hankering for, the mixologist concocted for me, and blew my  mind with it. Even his twist on the side car, this was one of the best drink I have ever had. Now for the food...I've traveled quite a bit and there are always days that I am wishing I had some legit hot sauce or West Indian dumplings. And boy, did they deliver!!! I practically had every part of the pig last night. The jerk pork butt...the adodo lechon(Filipino adobo flavored lechon! OMG!!!)...and last but certainly not least, the bento box, which comes complete with every animal you can think of and some steamed buns. lol!THANK YOU! THANK YOU! To the wonderful staff for making me and my friends feel like apart of a true experience. And thank you for the genius behind this restaurant concept. A MUST GO TO Y'ALL!!!!",5.0
"Omgeeee!!! Where can I start..I came with a few friends so that we can all sample something..everythingggg was delicious!! We started with the doubles,and fried buttermilk chicken feet,TO DIE FOR,sampled the peri peri wings,the Seoul octopus,everything amazing. Entrees included Bake and Shark that I had I thought I went to heaven.Then I sampled the ""catch of the day"" which was Red Snapper,""The Bento Box"",All Slamming,One of the others had churrasco steak which she said was amazing!!! Chef Roble and Co you did well...Customer Service is a plus,even their cocktails are amazing!!!! Check it out,you will not be disappointed!!!",5.0
"My second time here and I loved it! The Pain Killer was the perfect drink (not too overloaded with liquor to lose the taste). I also had the market fish (Red Snapper) wrapped in banana leaf....so flavorful! To top it off, I chose the Carbomb for dessert....heaven in a jar! Our server, Daniel, was the best! Can't wait to try brunch",5.0
"The STREETS are talking!! Definitely no hype- just real damn GOOD food;)As a globe trotting butterfly...I'm a huge fan of international street food. Hats off to chef Arthur and Roble for bringing it to BROOKLYN!! I had the trini corn soup and shark & bake. Both were bangin'! Then for dessert,  I ventured for the crispy filo dough stuffed with cheese cake- YUM!!And to top it all off the mezcal mojito was absolutely delish!!Definitely will be by to see what other delights pop up on their menu.Thanks to Jing Hee and Tim our servers who gave some great suggestions.",5.0
Streets lived up to the hype!! Food was amazing! Decor was eclectic but not comfortable - service was on point for a moderately busy Thursday - will definitely be back!,4.0
Food was soooo diverse and just ridiculously tasty! Drinks were flavorful. The seafood stew should be made into a soup. As a Caribbean person all that stew was a waste since I couldn't really eat it with the amount of rice I had. Great atmosphere and great wait staff.,5.0
Was very excited to try this new restaurant however we were kinda dissatisfied with the food we ordered the prawns where lackluster ... The sauce was flavorless n fell short of our expectations . We also ordered the mojito which tasted like orange juice and the manager offered to add more rum which helped but the thrill was gone. We also ordered the gyang chicken which we enjoyed the sauce was tasty and innovative.  We also ordered the hot dogs which I must say was the highlight of our dinning experience. The service was impeccable our server Aiden from Ireland was so attentive funny and accommodating we loved him!!! And the decor was beautiful ... I wish Streets all the best but they definitely need to iron out some of the kinks ...However the concept is great though and I'm sure it will be successful,3.0
"Really yummy. Had higher expectations for the food from the yelp reviews so I give four out of five stars on the food. Four of us ordered the bento box, spicy pork, Moroccan lamb and churrasco. BEST PLATE IS THE CHURRASCO! GET THE CHURRASCO! Hands down way better than everything else. My spicy pork was pretty good but supppperrrr spicy for my taste. TRES LECHES IS AMAAAAZINGGGGGGGGG!I give five stars overall because the restaurant gives a great atmosphere for a fun culinary adventure! ---very chill vibes, great lighting, family oriented, nice plants and a really cool art mural of the different countries they represent. Our waiter Tim was really cool and fun. The bathroom is also worth going to haha. Fun, decorative and overall a really great experience.",5.0
"I came here this past Sunday in horrible weather, but by the end of the night I was glad I did! The decor & scent when you walk in is just inviting, down to the lock on the bathroom door & the sink I loved everything about this place & I hadn't even eaten yet. Our server was very nice, said she was new & made a couple of minor mistakes.  She was very polite & attentive, we appreciated her. Now the food, we ordered doubles, chicharrones, peri peri wings, Brazilian green rice, bake & shark & a Cuban! Needless to say we were stuffed and enjoyed everything we tried. Also had a blackberry lemonade, nice libations. I had a wonderful experience & I can't wait to go back for the lobster that is not on the menu.",4.0
"The restaurant was just my style, really artisy, rustic and industrial.

It made me feel like I was getting wayyy too much face...or way too much Asian booty when she squatted to talk to someone else. LolYeah,  and the water guy WAS annoying! I LOVE water (you don't even know) but this water boy had to chill! ""Im good!!""Food was a winner, we had this cheese bread stuff w the bomb sauce, my gf had the chiccarone (sp) & I had the lobster roll with these bomb vinegar fries!

The bento box trio a must have there's crispy duck, braised short ribs and bacalao what a mix! Also had the street hot dogs, we ordered a second one for the table yes it was that good.

As foodie world traveler with a weak stomach, I can finally eat authentic street food and not worry about the aftermath. Yes!",5.0
"I'm so happy they are in my neighborhood and finally open. I pass by everyday on my way home, and been anxiously waiting.  The pretty hostesses were really nice and we got sat right away. My mom ordered the Roti Canai and Bulgogi Tacos. She said she enjoyed it very much and my dad ordered the catch of the day, the Bronzino. I was in the mood for chicken so I ordered the Gai Yang, Thai style grilled whole chicken and my dad and I shared the coconut jasmine brown rice. Which complimented our dishes exquisitely. We finished our dinner with the Churros and 3 sauce dippings. The only negative I have to say is I wished we could've ordered more but we were so full! I'm a happy a satisfied gal! Will be back soon. Can't go wrong when your having good food.",5.0

"Streets Bk is a restaurant that sells street food from around the world. I've been here twice and both times my friends and I enjoyed the food. I can last month for my best friend's birthday and the staff were very accommodating since the bday party was over 30 minutes late. At our table we ordered the peri peri wings which is an African chili . These wings were slightly crispy and glazed with this unique sauce. We were staring to see who would've gotten the last two wings. The rest of the party ordered the beef bulgogi tacos, jerk pork butt, and the churrasco y papas. The jerk pork butt was very tender and spicy and very filling. The churrasco was also tender and flavorful and those huge fries were also good. We also had the Mexican corn and had to order several. I didn't get to try the tacos but I heard it was good and also filling. As drinks we ordered the Streets Painkiller which was made with sorrel, rum, Creme de coco, pineapple juice, and nutmeg. Very tasty and refreshing for a hot summer day however I wished it was a tad bit stronger in liquor taste. I'll sure be back here again. Follow my ig page:eatingwithetienne",5.0

"This place is great! I went here during their soft opening and was not disappointed. I was seated quickly and came as a group of 4. The place was packed, but it was a Saturday night so it was expected. The volume was a bit loud so it was a little hard to hear your companions at the table. For dinner, I had the Doubles and it was absolutely delicious. They were short on a few drinks though, ( I wanted the Tao Tsing and if not the Sapporo) so I ordered a Red Stripe. The waitress (Jen?) was very knowledgable about the food and was very kind. I don't know about anyone else, but people who can describe food using words that describe texture, taste, spice, the chef making it, and how to eat it are very impressive to me. That made service a lot better bc I had a decent idea of what the food tastes like. They also had a pretty decent vegetarian selection so that was a plus!! I'm a vegetarian, and was happy they had delicious cultural foods that were available to me. The cons? Well, there isn't much. I just wished they had the beer I wanted. Also the cheesey bread (Pao de Queijo) was pretty gross. Even though they were free with the Yelp coupon, it was not good. At all. It was like eating heart clogging cheese. Echhh!Secondly, this place is sneakily expensive. We all had the SMALL plates, with the addition of my beer and my friends cocktail. The total came up to $85 bc they included tip....yes. No entrees. I don't know how it came to that much, but it did. Also, they serve shark on the menu. Seriously. That pissed me off right there. If you are reading this, and are not aware of the 'over-fishing of sharks for human consumption' problem, look it up right now. I'm not gonna sit here and lecture about the issue, but it really angered me that they would serve shark....a vulnerable species of shark for that matter. I'm sure there are other Trinidadian foods that are just as good, that doesn't advocate this practice. ~_~Other than that, if they take shark off the menu, stock their beverages properly on busy nights, and perhaps serve larger portions of those delicious small plates, this'd be a fun and culturally enriching place to dine with you and your friends!",4.0
"If I could give Streets a 4.5 from my phone, I would.  Came here for a Birthday dinner and had the Peri Peri Wings, Doubles, Fish of the Day, the veggie dish that comes with jasmine rice and Season Vegetables.  We loved the flavor of the wings, the Doubles dish was good, and the Jasmine Rice was amazing.  The veggies were great and the Bok Choy came with fried onions which was a great combination.  The Fish of the Day needed a tad more flavor (maybe salt).  The atmosphere of the restaurant is really comfortable since the space is open and much bigger than most NY food spots. Our waitress, Glorimar, gave excellent recommendations.  Would definitely recommend Streets for a fun outing with foodie friends.",4.0

"I went here yesterday with a pal of my mine and was impressed with the design and decore of the restaurant.  Its really a nice space.  The tables are spaced out nicely so people aren't sitting on top of each other and I always make sure to go into a restaurants bathroom ...it doesn't matter if I have to use it or not; I just think a well designed and decorated bathroom says a lot about a place.  Well streets has a nice bathroom...nice space... so lets talk about the ""street food"".I adore a good Mexican corn at a street fare so I ordered it here- I wasn't impressed.  It seemed like they tried to make Mexican corn fancy, cutting back on prime ingredients that makes it great comfort food.  I thought I had better corn at a street fare.I then ordered the bake and shark.  Now Guinese,  Trinadadian, and Bajians make the best shark and bake so I expected a nice fluffy, crisp, slightly greasy pastry, accompanied by a flavorful piece of fried shark.  Well, I didn't get that... I got what tasted like it was bake that was made the day before, It wasn't fluffy, it was crispy, but not like it had just been fried, however.  And the shark, was just ok... I could get better on Fulton Street and Nostrand.Then I ordered the bentibox which consisted of braised short rib, crispy duck, and bacalao, with steamed buns.  The duck wasn't crispy at all, the bacalao was very bland, and the short ribs were nothing to tell my friends about.  Also very regular, not impressed.In between i was trying cocktail after cocktail.  I started off with a bellini mojito, which was tasty.  Then I had the signature drink the Painkiller.  The drink is really pretty but they added coconut and cinnamon to sorrel, rum,and pinnacle juice.  All of those flavors have different characters so my palate was confused.  Wouldn't order that again. Then I had two whiskey sidecars for obvious reasons.  They were really good.I am going to go back and give Streets another try.  Maybe I just ordered the wrong things on the menu.  If nothing else, its a great place to get a whiskey sidecar.",2.0

"I went here yesterday with a pal of my mine and was impressed with the design and decore of the restaurant.  Its really a nice space.  The tables are spaced out nicely so people aren't sitting on top of each other and I always make sure to go into a restaurants bathroom ...it doesn't matter if I have to use it or not; I just think a well designed and decorated bathroom says a lot about a place.  Well streets has a nice bathroom...nice space... so lets talk about the ""street food"".I adore a good Mexican corn at a street fare so I ordered it here- I wasn't impressed.  It seemed like they tried to make Mexican corn fancy, cutting back on prime ingredients that makes it great comfort food.  I thought I had better corn at a street fare.I then ordered the bake and shark.  Now Guinese,  Trinadadian, and Bajians make the best shark and bake so I expected a nice fluffy, crisp, slightly greasy pastry, accompanied by a flavorful piece of fried shark.  Well, I didn't get that... I got what tasted like it was bake that was made the day before, It wasn't fluffy, it was crispy, but not like it had just been fried, however.  And the shark, was just ok... I could get better on Fulton Street and Nostrand.Then I ordered the bentibox which consisted of braised short rib, crispy duck, and bacalao, with steamed buns.  The duck wasn't crispy at all, the bacalao was very bland, and the short ribs were nothing to tell my friends about.  Also very regular, not impressed.In between i was trying cocktail after cocktail.  I started off with a bellini mojito, which was tasty.  Then I had the signature drink the Painkiller.  The drink is really pretty but they added coconut and cinnamon to sorrel, rum,and pinnacle juice.  All of those flavors have different characters so my palate was confused.  Wouldn't order that again. Then I had two whiskey sidecars for obvious reasons.  They were really good.I am going to go back and give Streets another try.  Maybe I just ordered the wrong things on the menu.  If nothing else, its a great place to get a whiskey sidecar.",2.0
"I loved this place. I went during the week and it was empty. I'm told you need a reservation during the weekends though. They have an odd happy hour time, that might explain why it was empty. But the food was great. Our server was a little hard to understand but it seemed like her knew what he was talking about. This is a place you will have to go to multiple times and not be afraid to share to taste all the different types of food.",4.0
"I went here on a double date last night and i have zero complaints. GG the waitress was super cute and attentive. She explained the menu well, Kept checking on us. The decor and atmosphere were cool, it was pretty quiet(it was a Tuesday). The food was great. The Chicharrón's were great, the street corn lobster roll and those vinegar fries were really good. I ordered the purple drink, forgot the name  but all the reviews about it were accurate. I will def be returning.",4.0
Been here twice. First time got my socks blown by how good it was; 2nd time around I had to question if I was in the same Resturant.

"My wife and I had an amazing dinner here! We tried the chefs special, Sicilian Arancini, and we're not disappointed. My wife's churrasco was flavorful and cooked perfectly. I had the jerk pork and it was excellent, tender and full of flavor. The drinks were also great. The staff was helpful and attentive. We had a wonderful food experience and will be back!",5.0
"If you're undecided on what type of cuisine to go for this place is a good shout. We went for lunch so a limited menu compared to dinner, but food was good. The ""Doubles"" were good, as were the grilled whole fish taco. I wouldn't go for the Peri Peri wings - they seem to lack something. Overall was OK- the staff were great and squeezed us in just before they closed the kitchen. Cocktails are Good - recommend the whiskey sidecar",3.0
Excellent service and the food is amazing!! I had the trini corn soup for an app and the lamb for an entree. The lamb was really good but had a ton of fat on it so I had to take a star off. I had some kind of clementine drink and it was absolutely delicious!! I will definitely be going back for brunch.,4.0

"I'm pretty impressed when a restaurant takes the time to get it right. I spoke to the manager Diana and was informed that the oweners sent out their consulting chefs to different parts of the world to learn the recipes. Also, the owners own Negril and are part owners of Soco. I have been to all of those restaurants and can say that this is  hands down the best  of the three. As my friend put it, ""they went into someone's grandma's house to learn these recipes."" That's how it felt at least from the items I tried. I felt like I was taken back to Trinidad as a kid with each taste.The portions were a good size and don't be shy about ordering multiple items. I came with two other friends and it got real when they had to rock paper scissor it out over whether to order the pork or lamb. FYI paper beats rock and they loved the jerk pork. The staff was very friendly and our waiter David was very nice and patient as we proceed to order multiple items off of the menu. How much did we order? Well it had to come out in three stages. Don't judge! Hell if David kept a straight face after we were done to ask if we wanted dessert then we obviously didn't order THAT much.",5.0
"Wow-- what an experience. The concept in and of itself should be enough to draw a crowd. Street food from around the globe with a spin--hell yeah.

To reiterate, because that's how impressed we were, the servers were very attentive, knowledgeable and overall just awesome. The FOOD WAS INCREDIBLE. A little pricey, yes, but worth the mouthgasm. We split the Brazilian seafood stew and the Thai chicken, and between the two of us, nothing was left untouched.

The bathrooms were sooooo clean, one of the cleanest resturant bathrooms I have come across so far at a restaurant....I have to say LOL. The waiter suggested for me to have  the pain killer drink which was by far one of the best drinks I have had. For appetizer we had the doubles and the corn, very tasteful.

"I would say the restaurant would be a solid 4 stars but had to take it down a star for a couple of reasons. Ill get the negatives out the way because it seems more so like new restaurant issues. As sweet as our waitress was, I dont think having someone that that seemed extremely new to the restaurant should be working a friday evening. Her nervousness showed when going over the basis of the restaurant when we said we were first time diners and she had trouble explaining things on the menu. It was just awkward waiting for her to finish so we can order.  When we asked about dessert, she mentioned chicharones, then corrected herself to long mexican donuts after we gave her a very confused look. Luckily we checked out the reviews on yelp, so we knew she was referring to the churros. She stopped naming desserts after that so we had to ask if there was anything else, since we saw a couple others mentioned online. She then said they had guacamole and dulce de leche. After another confusing look from us, she corrected herself to chocomole and we asked if they had the tres leche. She proceeds to say oh yeah, same thing as the dulce de leche. God bless her soul, because it seemed like she was really trying. Another issue which was quite annoying was the fact that all 4 things we ordered came out at practically the same time and had to constantly keep rearranging everything on the table to make it fit or had to rush and combine plates or stuff it down our throat to finish. We ordered doubles, shark and bake, peri peri wings, and the hot dog trio and all 4 things could not possibly fit on the table with our cocktails and glasses of water. Other than those minor nuisances, food was pretty good. Hot dog trio was way better than expected and a bargain when compared to other places that may serve fast food hot dogs. Peri peri wings were worth the hype although I wish it was cooked just a tad bit longer. Shark and bake was cooked perfectly and delicious. Double were simple and delicious. The mango chutney that came with a couple dishes was very good, especially for something thats just supposed to be a sidenote to the bigger dishes.. The hot sauce was really good with a spicy kick at the end.Hopefully the little kinks get ironed out because I'd love to try some of the other dishes.",3.0

"The food was great ! Service was also very good. It was very close to getting 5 stars but I was expecting a better view or a location closer to the bridge from reading  reviews some mentioned the views of the bridge while eating there is none lol but the decor  is great. Me and a friend went for dinner we shared and app, had 2 entrees and 2 deserts and 1 drink each -I think we spent about $60 a person not bad!! Prices are reasonable. So for our app we shared the doubles my first time tasting that and it was delicious!!! Our sever was very knowledgeable on each meal and we had alot of questions. I had the jerk pork, I never really order pork at restaurants but this was the most tender pork I've had!!! It was spicy but not intolerable very good.

"Yea yea hail king Streets for coming thru with a clever idea, establishment, and foods. Lawd fada! 1st time I was invited by a friend. When I discovered the trinidadian influence I couldn't help but open up a bit more to what could be in store...grabbed the bake and shark, doubles to dine in and the corn soup to go...classic trini street food. Pass!2nd time I returned with a team of 9 I think ...reunion of sorts...the team was SUPER late but the kind folks at Streets were wayyy patient. Thanks! My friends enjoyed the service and food...we had our ambassador for the night order everything for us! Hot damn, if we didnt cover the whole menu that night I'd be surprised. Wo wo! their mixologist created a cocktail with my go to alcoholic beverages ...grand marnier, whiskey, lime and thyme! Yea the drinks were good too! One of my friends who didn't want to come to brooklyn had lovely things to say about the service and food.I've been there a 3rd time already and yum yum. Might be hanging out there often. Oh and the prices...down right unbelievable. They are, in the forseeable future, very likely to have a packed house every night!I'd love to be a part of what they are doing for brooklyn!Oh and Jinhee! That girl is downright amazing!

"Yum!  I went to StreetsBK in the first week or so that it was open.  The idea is street food from around the world.  We made reservations for 10 pm, so we could eat and then PAR-TAY.  We ordered the vegetable tart, roti, and lamb.  We also stayed for dessert.  The food was all very good but the best part was the dessert!! It was a dulce de leche cake that was amazing.  My friend and I got to see Chef Roble running around while we were there so we thought that was pretty cool.  (We were fans of his show on Bravo.  So really I cannot give less than 5 stars just because of that.)  Our waitress was very pleasant and I had a great experience at Streets.  I am excited to go back and try different items off the menu.",5.0
"Came here for a friends B-day event. We sat at the bar as we waited for the rest of our group to arrive. Got here on a Sat. and they must have just changed shift because I ordered wine and  took about 5-10 mins to pour in a glass that was kinda dirty. The  dishwasher didnt do it's job correctly because the bartender noticed the unclean glass and I noticed him sift threw several glasses, which i appreciate because he could have disregarded the dirt, and it's not his fault but the cleaning staff. Anyhow we were seated, the manager was nice enough to come out and speak to all of the patron which you rarely see in almost all restaurants in NYC, so that was a nice touch. The food is a interesting mix, FUSION TO THE T! I order the double which was really good! My friend complained about the wings he ordered, as it was luke warm-cold.  Everyone enjoyed there meal, but Im sure if its because we waited for ever of our meal to come out, as we were pretty HUNGRAYYY! LOL. As an entree I had the Risotto squid ink seafood balls, which I dont believe I read on the menu that it was a deep fried stuff ball, it was not what I expected. As soon as my meal came the balls rolled off my plate and landed on my lap, the manager and waiter was nice enough to replace/redo my meal! The service is definitely A+, but I just feel the menu was a hit or miss. I will return and I may have try something different. The Doubles was on point though, but definitely a must try spot.",3.0
"I had high expectations for this place when I heard that its Chef Roble's restaurant and I also saw the manager from Soco there... And I love me some Soco!. But I didn't fall in love. The corn soup was good and I tasted my husbands doubles and it was good as well. But, I had the lobster and I didn't really like it. The cheesy bread that was paired with it was too oily and so was the lobster. And something about the flavors just didn't work for me. My husband had the bronzino and said it was tasty, but he too wasn't blown away.",3.0

"I would say the restaurant would be a solid 4 stars but had to take it down a star for a couple of reasons. Ill get the negatives out the way because it seems more so like new restaurant issues. As sweet as our waitress was, I dont think having someone that that seemed extremely new to the restaurant should be working a friday evening. Her nervousness showed when going over the basis of the restaurant when we said we were first time diners and she had trouble explaining things on the menu. It was just awkward waiting for her to finish so we can order.  When we asked about dessert, she mentioned chicharones, then corrected herself to long mexican donuts after we gave her a very confused look. Luckily we checked out the reviews on yelp, so we knew she was referring to the churros. She stopped naming desserts after that so we had to ask if there was anything else, since we saw a couple others mentioned online. She then said they had guacamole and dulce de leche. After another confusing look from us, she corrected herself to chocomole and we asked if they had the tres leche. She proceeds to say oh yeah, same thing as the dulce de leche. God bless her soul, because it seemed like she was really trying. Another issue which was quite annoying was the fact that all 4 things we ordered came out at practically the same time and had to constantly keep rearranging everything on the table to make it fit or had to rush and combine plates or stuff it down our throat to finish. We ordered doubles, shark and bake, peri peri wings, and the hot dog trio and all 4 things could not possibly fit on the table with our cocktails and glasses of water. Other than those minor nuisances, food was pretty good. Hot dog trio was way better than expected and a bargain when compared to other places that may serve fast food hot dogs. Peri peri wings were worth the hype although I wish it was cooked just a tad bit longer. Shark and bake was cooked perfectly and delicious. Double were simple and delicious. The mango chutney that came with a couple dishes was very good, especially for something thats just supposed to be a sidenote to the bigger dishes.. The hot sauce was really good with a spicy kick at the end.Hopefully the little kinks get ironed out because I'd love to try some of the other dishes.",3.0
Wow!  I'm a foodie and this place is legit!  I just had the best lobster of my life!  Food is amazing and it's across the street from the best real estate office in town!  This is a must go to.  Jinhee was our server and guided us in a legit way.  Loved everything that came out.  I am full now.,5.0
"The food was great ! Service was also very good. It was very close to getting 5 stars but I was expecting a better view or a location closer to the bridge from reading  reviews some mentioned the views of the bridge while eating there is none lol but the decor  is great. Me and a friend went for dinner we shared and app, had 2 entrees and 2 deserts and 1 drink each -I think we spent about $60 a person not bad!! Prices are reasonable. So for our app we shared the doubles my first time tasting that and it was delicious!!! Our sever was very knowledgeable on each meal and we had alot of questions. I had the jerk pork, I never really order pork at restaurants but this was the most tender pork I've had!!! It was spicy but not intolerable very good. We had the flan and I forget the other one but both deserts were delish!",4.0
"Yea yea hail king Streets for coming thru with a clever idea, establishment, and foods. Lawd fada! 1st time I was invited by a friend. When I discovered the trinidadian influence I couldn't help but open up a bit more to what could be in store...grabbed the bake and shark, doubles to dine in and the corn soup to go...classic trini street food. Pass!2nd time I returned with a team of 9 I think ...reunion of sorts...the team was SUPER late but the kind folks at Streets were wayyy patient. Thanks! My friends enjoyed the service and food...we had our ambassador for the night order everything for us! Hot damn, if we didnt cover the whole menu that night I'd be surprised. Wo wo! their mixologist created a cocktail with my go to alcoholic beverages ...grand marnier, whiskey, lime and thyme! Yea the drinks were good too! One of my friends who didn't want to come to brooklyn had lovely things to say about the service and food.I've been there a 3rd time already and yum yum. Might be hanging out there often. Oh and the prices...down right unbelievable. They are, in the forseeable future, very likely to have a packed house every night!I'd love to be a part of what they are doing for brooklyn!Oh and Jinhee! That girl is downright amazing! Glad to have her as my ambassador for multiple evenings!Had the pleasure to meet all the owners.. and lady and gentlemen all the best with Streets!Excuse any typos.",5.0
"Yum!  I went to StreetsBK in the first week or so that it was open.  The idea is street food from around the world.  We made reservations for 10 pm, so we could eat and then PAR-TAY.  We ordered the vegetable tart, roti, and lamb.  We also stayed for dessert.  The food was all very good but the best part was the dessert!! It was a dulce de leche cake that was amazing.  My friend and I got to see Chef Roble running around while we were there so we thought that was pretty cool.  (We were fans of his show on Bravo.  So really I cannot give less than 5 stars just because of that.)  Our waitress was very pleasant and I had a great experience at Streets.  I am excited to go back and try different items off the menu.",5.0
"Came here for a friends B-day event. We sat at the bar as we waited for the rest of our group to arrive. Got here on a Sat. and they must have just changed shift because I ordered wine and  took about 5-10 mins to pour in a glass that was kinda dirty. The  dishwasher didnt do it's job correctly because the bartender noticed the unclean glass and I noticed him sift threw several glasses, which i appreciate because he could have disregarded the dirt, and it's not his fault but the cleaning staff.

"Went on a Saturday night to celebrate two birthdays. We had a reservation for 17. They were very accommodating. Our server was Aiden. He was pretty good. The food and drinks were delicious.

I ordered the jerk pork and Brazilian green rice. Delicious and succulent. The doubles and adobo chicharrones were very tasty. Peri Peri wings were delicious as well. Tasted a bit of the lobster roll, also great. So pretty much everything was a winner. I would definitely recommend this restaurant. It was loud and lively and an overall great time.

I had a good time at the restaurant.

I'd curl up with that soup on a cold winter night. .lol. My bestie had the bake and shark. I was impressed. That bake was on point. Not everybody can make a good bake.

"Back-blowing-churros!!! I'll come back to that. The 5th star missing was for the booking plan being a blower! I follow Chef Roble on Facebook and learned of the new spot via him on there. My girlfriends and I had no plans for V-Day, so we decided to spend it together. I made reservations earlier this past week for the only block they had left of 10pm. The restaurant closes at 10, so I figured we needed to be there on time to ensure we got fresh food from the kitchen. Just before 4pm on V-Day I get a call from the restaurant confirming my reservation for the night. They advised that we need to all be there at 10 in order to be seated and they'll only hold the reservation for 10mins. Well we all arrived together just before 10 and were told, it would be about 10mins as the table wasn't ready. There were a couple of tables where we could have been seated, but they kept holding them. One was never occupied even after we finally got our table. Almost an hour later, we were finally seated after everyone else who was also waiting out the process! Our server Aidan was the best! If you make it there, ask for Aidan's station!! He was SUPER knowledgeable of the menu and was extremely friendly! I asked for a sample of the Brazilian rice and seasonal greens (pea shoot greens) and Aidan set off to provide me with it. Unfortunately, everything is made to order, so no samples were available. But that worked to my advantage! My friends and I ordered: doubles, Mexican street corn, pao de queijo, peri peri wings, Cuban sandwiches and the seasonal greens! Everything was seasoned SO well! I'm Caribbean, so I take my seasoning very seriously. When I tell you the doubles tasted like they came out of my Trini Grandmom's kitchen...HUNNY!! Everything also tasted great. But those greens?!? #fullofflavor I've never had pea shoot greens before, but this weekend I'll have had it twice in one weekend because I got an order to take home with the remainder of my wings! The greens pack in some of my favorite things, French fried onions and bean sprouts!! Flavor town in my mouth! We also ordered the Dark & stormy, sprite, cranberry ginger mule and blackberry lemonade for beverages. Everything was yummolicious!! I did send the blackberry lemonade back for a dark & stormy because the blackberries were just too thick. It totally threw the drink off!!I was thoroughly ready to roll after all those flavors hit my palate! One of the runners, Francisco kept us entertained and smiling as he took care of boxing up our leftovers! Then here comes Aidan asking if we wanted dessert. Simply inquisitive with no real intention of partaking, we ask about what's available. Aidan starts describing tres leches (I'm not a fan), churros with salted caramel dip, dark chocolate dip and a vanilla icing dip with almonds or a chocolate mole'. Well the churros won out as a share for the table. I took a small piece of the churro, dipped one end in the vanilla and the other in the salted caramel and popped it in my mouth!!! MAN! I had a quick jolt like someone hit me in my back. Hence, BACK-BLOWING-CHURROS!!! If you eat nothing else when you get there, #getthechurros!!! Only one thing was missing from this dessert moment and that was the perfect pairing of wines (sweet red for the chocolate, a Riesling for the vanilla, and prosecco or moscato for the salted caramel). But the bar was closed after I got that 2nd drink, so no perfect pairing. Aidan's recommendations were so on point that I had to do a slow-clap to him from across the dining area!! Overall, a wonderful night spent with old friends in a new setting! Chef Roble managed to pop in for a few, but didn't really socialize with patrons, which was a bit disappointing given his appearance of such an outgoing personality on tv. I enjoyed meeting Aidan's smiling Irish eyes and the lovely Mexican French history of Francisco! I'll be back because I've got to get into the bake & shark and the jerk pork! Sorry my review was so long. But so was my wait! Hoping my return visit won't be as long and was told as this is only the 3rd week and V-Day, the reservations were backed up. OH! I almost forgot. The bar area has chargers at EVERY seat. There aren't any purse hooks, but staff advised they're pending installation! StreetsBK...get to know them!!",4.0
"So my review of streets is really more of a 3.8 than an absolute 4. We arrived on time for our  7 PM reservation and were seated promptly. It took a while for someone to bring water (although it was pretty empty). When the waiter arrived, we ordered both our drinks and our food at the same time in order to save time. I ordered the dark 'n' stormy & my date ordered the painkiller, and both were AMAZING. Delicious and strong. For food, we ordered the doubles as an appetizer, my date ordered the Mariscados (which was seafood- shrimp, clams, calamari, etc, marinated in a great sauce) as an entree, and I ordered the bento box. The doubles were DELICIOUS. I devoured them and tried them with all the sauces they came with (a pepper sauce, and a green spicy/sweet sauce). The bento box was a little underwhelming, although I did pretty much eat it all. My date's Mariscados dish was also finished, and that was much better. The reason why I wouldn't give this a full 4 is because of the inattentiveness of our server (which isn't really his fault, I literally counted two servers our entire time there). I would definitely go back, as I feel that I want to try other foods as well as other drinks. It was a pretty good experience though!",4.0
"Went here for my sister's birthday last night and it was very impressive. The ambiance and unique décor such as the artistry painting of NYC on the wall and old school light bulbs hanging on ropes is such a cool touch. You can tell they put a lot of thought to every aspect of the place including the menu. The menu was a whole other story, I saw so many items I wanted to try and as a group we were able to do that. We ordered the Mexican Street Corn which was so delicious I swear I could have eaten a whole basket full! Then we tried the Doubles, Bulgogi Tacos and Ceviche to start. They were all very good. For entree, I had the Churrasco Y Papas which was a skirt steak with fries and kale salad with pineapple....WOW...the skirt steak was one of the best I had. They cooked it a perfect medium and it paired well with the kale salad. The fried were thick cut but a great crisp on the outside and creamy inside. My tummy was already so happy but it didn't stop there. For dessert, we had the churros which was served with 3 dipping sauces. Chocolate, White chocolate and salted caramel. I loved the salted caramel and definitely recommend it. Everyone needs to experience this place!!! I am definitely going back!",5.0

"(The food is great!! Tasty food that lights up the pallet). From my food choices, the beef tacos were a stand out hit. It was full of different flavours and seasoned very well. I also tried the wings which were tasty and flavourful. Since I'm from Trinidadian descent, I had to try the roti and the bake & shark. I didn't expect them to be how momma makes them but they were close enough for me to enjoy. The drinks were enjoyable, but they ran out of a few selections on the drink menu. Overall the atmosphere was good and the staff was excellent. I urge to make reservations.",4.0
I had one of the best server in the place. I had the best food it was crazy. I love to kill a restaurant if it's not all together. I walked in streets an from the lighting to the food. I was like dam this place is real nice. 120 Diffrent foods from other country. I was blown away with that an the prices are the best. I tell you if you go and you don't like it something is wrong with you enjoy.   Food brother1,5.0
"I went to street about a week ago and I must say the food was very good. My family and I ordered quite a bit off the menu and was NOT mad at all. The whole fish snapper, peri peri wings, curry chicken,Whole chicken, lamb was a bit bland but hey. sister finished off the octopus before I could even taste it ...so I guess it was alllllll good.Jerk Pork, shark and bake, hot dogs, corn soup and complimentary of the chef was the fried pork. Yes if you are west Indian you already know how this food could be taken up a notch but it was VERY good. I must say we were very pleased and wil be back. We didnt drink so I can't even talk about that but I will save that for the next visit. The staff was very nice,and Chef Roble was also there and stopped by the table to to let us know about a few more projects that he was working on.",4.0
Very mediocre place. First I was asked to wait 20 minutes for the table even though they had 3 available. I was hoping it was worth for. The food is overpriced even for Williamsburg and it's nothing special. It was my first and last time here. Waitress is very professional,2.0
"I shared the Sicilian Arancini, Bulgogi Tacos, and Gai Yang Chicken with my partner. We were both disappointed with the taste of everything. It was difficult to distinguish the flavors in the Sicilian Arancini, the tacos just simply lacked flavor, and the chicken was far below the taste-quality of chicken that I've had in the past. Overall, nothing tasted original. The service was also quite slow.",2.0
"Some of the best food from around the world that i have ever tasted.   The vibe was really chill.   As a Trinidadian Born and Bred, i was very impressed with the bake and shark.  It's  the best i have had outside of Richards on Maracas Beach.   Also, the sauces are amazing.  Tamarind, Shado Beni and pepper sauce topped off an amazing meal.   Everyone in my group had an great time and thought the food was amazing for a very reasonable price.  This place is worth a trip if you are in the tri State area!  I'll def be back soon.",5.0
"Back-blowing-churros!!! I'll come back to that. The 5th star missing was for the booking plan being a blower! I follow Chef Roble on Facebook and learned of the new spot via him on there. My girlfriends and I had no plans for V-Day, so we decided to spend it together. I made reservations earlier this past week for the only block they had left of 10pm. The restaurant closes at 10, so I figured we needed to be there on time to ensure we got fresh food from the kitchen. Just before 4pm on V-Day I get a call from the restaurant confirming my reservation for the night. They advised that we need to all be there at 10 in order to be seated and they'll only hold the reservation for 10mins. Well we all arrived together just before 10 and were told, it would be about 10mins as the table wasn't ready. There were a couple of tables where we could have been seated, but they kept holding them. One was never occupied even after we finally got our table. Almost an hour later, we were finally seated after everyone else who was also waiting out the process! Our server Aidan was the best! If you make it there, ask for Aidan's station!! He was SUPER knowledgeable of the menu and was extremely friendly! I asked for a sample of the Brazilian rice and seasonal greens (pea shoot greens) and Aidan set off to provide me with it. Unfortunately, everything is made to order, so no samples were available. But that worked to my advantage! My friends and I ordered: doubles, Mexican street corn, pao de queijo, peri peri wings, Cuban sandwiches and the seasonal greens! Everything was seasoned SO well!

"Baby!? Smh. I hate to shake my head, really I do. 2 1/2 stars. I came on a Saturday night and ordered the peri peri wings and the fried seafood balls with tomato sauce as a starter. The peri peri wings were ok, nothing great, and the seafood had little to no flavor to them. I barely tasted the seafood in the balls *pause* but I thought, 'hey, they're small plates, there's always the entree.' I ordered the jerk pork; it was very tough on the outside making it hard to chew and slightly tender on the inside. Aside from the less than desirable texture, I barely tasted the jerk and it was salty! Ay dios mio! The vegetable that came with the entree was super salty and I could barely eat it :-( I tried my cousins lamb and beef from her bento box and it just didn't taste good to me at all. I hated to say, that I was dissapointed. Our waitress was sweet though and my drink (the painkiller) was good! The bathroom was also nice with the huge lock across the door. The food, however, was what I came for and I was a little shocked that it wasn't at all what I expected. We waited a while for our food to come (atleast 40+ mins) and once I ate, I just wanted to go; I didn't have the energy to complain.Will I be back? Doubt it. But maybe that was a bad night :-/ because I'm trying to be where all you guys that gave 5 stars were at. What night was that? lol I love Chef Roble' from his hit show and couldn't wait to get the opportunity to try cuisine influenced by his expertise. I wish this establishment the best of luck but it missed the mark with me, sad to say.",2.0
I had reservations at 8:30pmThe front staff appeared to be friendly as we arrived 15 mins early. They stated they would seat is in 5 mins  since it wasn't that crowded but when 8:30pm closely came and went I asked them around what time will I be seated. The young lady in the front got really rude and sat me and my friend in a back corner table right in front of the music system even though the restaurant was far from crowded. She even rolled her eyes a couple times. I guess it was her pay back for merely asking a question. After all the hype the food simply wasn't that good.But could be the fact that I waited almost 2 hours to get my food.The drinks were watered down completely. I called the waitress who seemed extremely overwhelmed as she tasted the drink and stated yea it was really bad. She did give us a free drink but it was worse than the first one. And it didn't help that the water from the pipes in the ceiling were dripping down on a lady next to me shirt who complained for hours behind me. I thought I would love it since I love chef roble and always wanted to taste his food but sorry it just wasn't what I expected. Chef roble was actually in the restaurant but unfortunately never made it to my table as he greeted many fans to hear my laundry list of complaints and suggestions.  I will never come here again and wouldn't recommend it  to anyone I know .,1.0
"Visited this for the first time May 16th to celebrate my husband's new job. We had a 5pm reservation. We were a few minutes early and were told the kitchen wasn't open yet and that we could sit at the bar and have a drink. Which we did. I had the Streets Pain Killer. Awesome. Doesn't taste strong at first but I had 3 so I was def feeling a bit buzzed. My husband had a long island ice tea. It was $16. A bit pricey and he is super picky about that drink and said it was just ok. Once we were seated we quickly ordered 3 small plates: Mexican Street Corn, Adobo Chicharrónes, Bulgogi Tacos - all were flavorful and delicious. We ordered our entrees next which were: Jerk Pork, Gai Yang chicken and Brazilian Green Rice (so buttery good). We def went overboard it being our first time we wanted to get a sense of what they had to offer and boy did we ever. It was excellent. Cool vibe to the place and staff was super attentive. We topped off the meal with apple stuffed egg roll dessert. Needless to say we ended up in a food coma and had a few leftovers to take home and they tasted even better the next day. Def worth a visit or two or three...Will be back Streets.",4.0

Great food. I wish it came out hotter however. Everything was closer to luke warm than hot. PeriPeri wings and Brazilian rice were amazing!,4.0
"Amazing, fun experience and worth the journey to Brooklyn.  Its a great concept, Street food from around the world and well executed.  Sexy restaurant and kudos to the mixologist.  I had a cranberry ginger mule with Vodka, Fresh Muddled Cranberries, Ginger, Lime, Ginger Beer, Ginger Candy Garnish.  We shared peri peri wings, escaviche and a vegetable tart.  All amazing, and the desert was apple pie in an egg roll with a green tea ginger dipping sauce!!  Service was very attentive. Yep, they got it right!",5.0
"Awful hostess... While we did arrive late to our reservation, she offered no alternative to table seating (there were a lot of bar seats) and was completely rude.",1.0
"Baby!? Smh. I hate to shake my head, really I do. 2 1/2 stars. I came on a Saturday night and ordered the peri peri wings and the fried seafood balls with tomato sauce as a starter. The peri peri wings were ok, nothing great, and the seafood had little to no flavor to them. I barely tasted the seafood in the balls *pause* but I thought, 'hey, they're small plates, there's always the entree.' I ordered the jerk pork; it was very tough on the outside making it hard to chew and slightly tender on the inside. Aside from the less than desirable texture, I barely tasted the jerk and it was salty! Ay dios mio! The vegetable that came with the entree was super salty and I could barely eat it :-( I tried my cousins lamb and beef from her bento box and it just didn't taste good to me at all. I hated to say, that I was dissapointed. Our waitress was sweet though and my drink (the painkiller) was good! The bathroom was also nice with the huge lock across the door. The food, however, was what I came for and I was a little shocked that it wasn't at all what I expected. We waited a while for our food to come (atleast 40+ mins) and once I ate, I just wanted to go; I didn't have the energy to complain.Will I be back? Doubt it. But maybe that was a bad night :-/ because I'm trying to be where all you guys that gave 5 stars were at. What night was that? lol I love Chef Roble' from his hit show and couldn't wait to get the opportunity to try cuisine influenced by his expertise. I wish this establishment the best of luck but it missed the mark with me, sad to say.",2.0
I had reservations at 8:30pmThe front staff appeared to be friendly as we arrived 15 mins early. They stated they would seat is in 5 mins  since it wasn't that crowded but when 8:30pm closely came and went I asked them around what time will I be seated. The young lady in the front got really rude and sat me and my friend in a back corner table right in front of the music system even though the restaurant was far from crowded. She even rolled her eyes a couple times. I guess it was her pay back for merely asking a question. After all the hype the food simply wasn't that good.But could be the fact that I waited almost 2 hours to get my food.The drinks were watered down completely. I called the waitress who seemed extremely overwhelmed as she tasted the drink and stated yea it was really bad. She did give us a free drink but it was worse than the first one. And it didn't help that the water from the pipes in the ceiling were dripping down on a lady next to me shirt who complained for hours behind me. I thought I would love it since I love chef roble and always wanted to taste his food but sorry it just wasn't what I expected. Chef roble was actually in the restaurant but unfortunately never made it to my table as he greeted many fans to hear my laundry list of complaints and suggestions.  I will never come here again and wouldn't recommend it  to anyone I know .,1.0
"Visited this for the first time May 16th to celebrate my husband's new job. We had a 5pm reservation. We were a few minutes early and were told the kitchen wasn't open yet and that we could sit at the bar and have a drink. Which we did. I had the Streets Pain Killer. Awesome. Doesn't taste strong at first but I had 3 so I was def feeling a bit buzzed. My husband had a long island ice tea. It was $16. A bit pricey and he is super picky about that drink and said it was just ok. Once we were seated we quickly ordered 3 small plates: Mexican Street Corn, Adobo Chicharrónes, Bulgogi Tacos - all were flavorful and delicious. We ordered our entrees next which were: Jerk Pork, Gai Yang chicken and Brazilian Green Rice (so buttery good). We def went overboard it being our first time we wanted to get a sense of what they had to offer and boy did we ever. It was excellent. Cool vibe to the place and staff was super attentive. We topped off the meal with apple stuffed egg roll dessert. Needless to say we ended up in a food coma and had a few leftovers to take home and they tasted even better the next day. Def worth a visit or two or three...Will be back Streets.",4.0
