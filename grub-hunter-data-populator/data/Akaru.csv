"Decent sushi for the area but Man, that psycho delivery guy.by the time he got to my door he looked extremely pissed, when I paid for the food I gave him a $2 tip which should have been fine but when i did he looked at me and said, that's it? In his broken English and then proceeded to stick his head in my door and look around my place! was crazy and a little scary! Finally I said thats it goodbye and had to literally shut the door on his face.Cut to 20 mins later my dog was barking up a storm and I realized that the delivery man was lurking right by my door yelling on his phone!I opened the door and asked why he was still here and he said because he can and then i said you need to get off my doorstep.. He ignored me, I said get off my doorstep or I'm going to call the police. He started mocking me and copying what I was saying! I am super freaked out and will never order again. I literally had a nightmare about this dude a week later!",2.0
"Dined here last night and it was incredible. We ordered goyza and the rolled beef with scallions for appetizers. Perfect start to the meal for us. We ordered the American Dream roll and Yaki Vegetable Udon, both delicious, and finished with mochi ice cream and fried ice cream. Everything tasted fresh and perfectly seasoned.We will be returning!",4.0
"Two words: Lunch. Special. $8.00 for two rolls, $10.00 for three. Lately every day around noon my craving for a spicy tuna and salmon avocado hand roll starts kicking in. Fish in my experience has always been fresh tasting and delivery is speedy quick. It ain't Nobu but it definitely satisfies my cravings for sushi in my hood.My only complaint is that they aren't on GrubHub / Seamless. With the convenience of these websites I have become a bumbling idiot trying to order food on the phone.",4.0
Great place.  Nice atmosphere. And the sushi was good.  I was a little upset that I had to ask for water but they get a pass because the rolls were real good also they have my favorite Japanese soda.  I will come again.,4.0
"Tasty fish, really really reasonable prices, especially for brooklyn. I was pleased.",4.0
Prior to this place I didn't even like Sushi. While I still won't try most things Akaru has certainly change my take on Sushi. The Spicy lobster rolls are so good. The shrimp Tampura - another fav. Ive had the.. I think it's a Dragon rolls (spicy Tuna roll with crab meat on top) yumm. The shrimp rice is much better then any regular Japanese spot. Oh and the ginger (Green) salad also a thumbs up. Ive haven't had the seafood soup yet but certainly intend to try it. The meso soup is as good as a plan soup can be I suppose. Overall this is my go to sushi place.... A little attached to it at this point and thats coming from a former sushi hater,5.0
"I totally agree with Gail Q about being confused at how good and how inexpensive and close to my crappy Bushwick apartment this place is. I have always gotten delivery and it is always fresh and quick. Portions are big (well, for sushi at least) and they don't skimp on the fish in the maki. The selections are pretty basic - nothing out of the ordinary - but maybe that is how they keep things so fresh. I am eager to go in there in person when I am feeling less lazy and willing to put on pants.",5.0

"First time ordering from here and yea Im still hungry. The shrimp tempura was tasteless and the shrimp were not cleaned! The nikki roll did not look appetizing,even took off the eel because I honestly thought it would make me sick! Never again",2.0
"My parents live in the area so my mom and I decided to stop in and see what this new Japanese place was all about. I am so glad we came in! I ordered the rock shrimp dinner box that came with rock shrimp, a California roll, tempura and shumai! The rock shrimp was so delicious with the mayonnaise sauce. My mom got shrimp pad thai that was also very delicious. The soda I ordered was brought out in can and a glass but I never had to touch the can, my waiter always refilled it for me! When it came to boxing the rest of my dinner, my waiter took care of that as well so the service was awesome! Can't wait to come again and try more. They have great lunch special deals but they aren't available on Sunday's so plan accordingly!",4.0
Food is pretty good. Service is decent. The sushi is pretty fresh and the Udon noodles are good. Nice to have a good sushi restaurant in Bushwick where there aren't many options.,4.0
"I love the box food here, it's awesome. The sushi is average. What I really cannot stand is the terrible customer service. My department orders food from here at least once a week. This last time they forgot an entire order, once we all say down to eat I called to let them know. Their only response was to basically call me a liar by saying I took too long to call them and let them know. After a while another woman got in he phone and said ""oh yeah maybe there was a mix up"" and said she would credit my account. Took down my name and number.The next week I called to order again, reminded them of my credit only to have them transfer me to 2-3 people all which who said they don't do that.Boo.",3.0

"Very polite staff. Sushi at awesome prices. I thought the sushi wouldn't be good, but my expectations were beyond met. You can even have a glass of wine for $6 and a roll for $5. Worth checking out. You won't be disappointed. A lot of people come here for take out and delivery also.",5.0

"OK sushi, pretty average Americanized sushi, generally. Looking at the menu, it seems a bit pricey for what it is, but there aren't many Japanese places nearby, so I guess they're capitalizing on that. Also, we went on a really hot day, and it was equally hot inside, which wasn't so pleasant. We were really hungry, so we got the dinner boxes. At $17, I suppose you got a fair amount of food. I got the beef negimaki, and the beef was a bit tough, the scallions a bit much, and the whole thing was swimming in dilute teriyaki sauce. Not super appealing. The rest of it was pretty standard American sushi bento stuff - salad, miso soup, shumai, tempura, california roll. All decent, but not stellar.",3.0

I'm actually confused as to how sushi can this good and cheap and close to my house.

The lunch special is only $11 for 3 rolls, a miso soup and a salad. That's 18 pieces of sushi, and it's their good stuff too! The spicy tuna roll and the shrimp tempura are my favs.For some reason there never seems to be very many people in there - that should change!

"Literally made a Yelp account just to post this review. Now...If only the food looks as great as what's shown in the photos. Prices are a little higher than what you expect for sushi in a neighborhood like that, but the pieces are quite a bit smaller than your standard sushi.Never have I been to a sushi restaurant where the sushi is cut SO thin that when you try to pick it up, the insides completely fall out. Approximately cut, let's say 3/4 of a centimeter? Wish I had taken a photo, because what you get at looks nothing like what you see in the photos. The prices are fair for mediocre sushi, but the portions are so small compared to other sushi bars out there. We ordered 4 rolls, 2 salads, and one entree that came to over $100 after tips. The servers aren't the friendliest either. Not a smile on their face.The sashimi is a whole different story. Quite large pieces actually but the taste is unbearable. You can taste that the fish has been left out just sitting on the counter and definitely wasn't fresh fish from that day. I won't be coming back to this place. No thank you.",1.0

"I study around here a lot and I'm so glad this Sushi spot opened up!!! It's really nice to get some variety around this area, there are a ton of hispanic style restaurants (and fast food joints) but I think this is the first Sushi spot close by.I was skeptical to try it out since I visited when it first opened a few months ago and it was never packed with customers. But I was so tired of living off of Subway and Salads from the Deli for lunch.We went on a Monday afternoon and this place was definitely a crowd pleaser. They make the sushi right infront of you and its all fresh ingredients. Also the staff is really pleasant and I've never had and problems with my order. The food is cheap and exceeded my expectations. I got the salmon avocado, spicy tuna and shrimp tempura rolls. I enjoyed all of them!! You even get some delicious miso soup and a salad along with the 3 rolls for ONLY $10. Come on, no one can beat that. Just use the wasabi cautiously - it was a little more intense than most sushi spots (the other times I went it wasn't as spicy, so maybe it was just that day!). My friend almost died with a cough attack 3 times because of it.Can't wait to visit again.",4.0
"There aren't a lot of good options for sushi in Bushwick, but Akaru definitely gets the job done. I've done takeout and delivery from here. Staff is super nice and helpful, delivery was incredibly quick (20 minutes!), the prices are reasonable, and the quality of the sushi is pretty good. It's not the best I've ever had, but it's good and fresh, and I'll definitely order from here again.",4.0

"Pretty decent Japanese (Chinese own) food. Quick and friendly service, open late for this area. Raw fish is edible, cheap spot for a sushi fix. There is a bit too much red walls in the decor, and sound bounces around too much, adding a tapestry or some plants would help with the atmosphere.",3.0
"We had the edamame, gyozas, pink lady roll, soft shell crab and chicken teriyaki last night. Service was good, food was completely delicious. They served us a complimentary salad and miso soup first ( though one soup and one spoon for two people...just as well I liked my date) . All of the food, especially the sushi was so good. The teriyaki was the only thing I wasn't keen on as it was super sweet . I'll definitely be back",4.0
"I come here with my colleagues from the hospital all the time for their great sushi lunch deals. 3 rolls, miso soup, and salad for 10$. The sushi is very fresh and crisp. Miso soup is hot and rich. Salad has delicious ginger dressing. I always leave stuffed and satisfied. My fav rolls are sweet potato, spicy tuna, and yellowtail jalapeno.The restaurant itself is simple and classy. The servers are always prompt. They refilled my drink as soon as I needed it and were their with a fresh set of chopsticks as soon as I dropped mine on the floor.",4.0
"My fiancee and I come here almost every Friday, to the point where the servers know our order.  We love sushi and have been to a lot of sushi spots in the city and I have to say, this place always ends up being better than all the others.  The fish is super fresh and tasty, it's affordable and everyone is very friendly.  We will continue to come every Friday, because it's amazing.",5.0
"I study around here a lot and I'm so glad this Sushi spot opened up!!! It's really nice to get some variety around this area, there are a ton of hispanic style restaurants (and fast food joints) but I think this is the first Sushi spot close by.I was skeptical to try it out since I visited when it first opened a few months ago and it was never packed with customers. But I was so tired of living off of Subway and Salads from the Deli for lunch.We went on a Monday afternoon and this place was definitely a crowd pleaser.

"This place is satisfyingly Not Terrible and Close To My Apartment.The atmosphere inside could be helped greatly by not loudly playing an awful playlist of radio dance pop.

"I work at an authentic, upscale Japanese restaurant in the city, and have eaten at a couple of high end sushi places as well. Given that there are no ""real"" sushi restaurants in this area, I was excited to see this place open a few blocks from where I live. Honestly, I did not have any expectations. I just wanted standard sushi fare with at least decently priced dishes and passable freshness. But I am very impressed so far with Akaru. The fish is very fresh and comparable to most of the places in the city. Every dish I have ordered - from their rock shrimp to roll combinations, sashimi, and even beef negimaki, has been on point and satisfyingly delicious. Service is always very friendly and warm, I wouldn't mind coming every day. On the occasions that I would order delivery, the nice and smiley delivery guy actually goes to my front door and knocks - none of those calling and saying that they're outside, wanting me to go out and get my food while they hang out in their car. This man really gives meaning to the word delivery. 10 stars if possible!So folks, I urge you to try this place out. Do not expect authentic Japanese food, because this place will surely disappoint you. Just be ready for some fresh, affordable food, larger than average portions, and spot on service. Akaru will surely exceed your expectations. This place is the perfect addition to the neighborhood.",5.0

"We were skeptical about trying out the sushi at Akaru since its fairly new. Every time we walked by there were no guests eating in and barely anyone had reviewed the food. However, we recently noticed that over 30 people checked in at Akaru on Four Square and when we walked by it today we saw their delivery guy leave with two orders, so we decided to try out their free delivery. We've tried out the other sushi restaurants around Ridgewood, like Tendo and Sakura, so we know good sushi and had really high expectations for Akaru and wow! their food was a fantastic surprise. We ordered a few sushi pieces (tuna, white tuna, smoked eel, striped bass) and the fish was super fresh and soft. The rolls of spicy tuna and spicy crab were very flavorful and tasted clean.  We also ordered the Nikki roll  with shrimp tempura, eel and avocado which was delicious!! The miso soup was a typical amount you'd get from any Japanese spot and it came at a hot temperature given the freezing snow storm outside; it was very good and had a nice smokey flavor. The agetashi tofu came semi-firm but it was plain, as tofu usually is. There was nothing wrong with it, I just thought it was going to be crispy.  Akaru's prices are decent, its an affordable average price that is expected of good sushi spots. When ordering delivery remember to mention the 10% off coupon found on their menu. The whole experience was awesome and we'll definitely continue ordering from Akaru. Watch out Tendo, Akaru may give you a run for your money.",5.0

Great food and staff! Ordered a teriyaki chicken lunch special for delivery at 3:50pm just before 4pm and it wasn't an issue at all.  The man on the phone was nice and I told him of my allergy and made accommodations for me specially.  He even asked if another ingredient was ok.    Delivery was quick...the whole thing from ordering to the food at my doorstep was 35mins tops.  Took away one star because their lunch price is $10.00 but I was charged $10.90...maybe because of my allergy accommodations?  Not sure. But I still thoroughly enjoyed it all.,4.0

I work down the block and lunch hour coincides nicely with Akaru's opening time. My coworkers and I have taken advantage of their lunch special and every single time we have no complaints. When we can't pick it up the delivery is prompt so that is a definite plus.,5.0
Great food and staff! Ordered a teriyaki chicken lunch special for delivery at 3:50pm just before 4pm and it wasn't an issue at all.  The man on the phone was nice and I told him of my allergy and made accommodations for me specially.  He even asked if another ingredient was ok.    Delivery was quick...the whole thing from ordering to the food at my doorstep was 35mins tops.  Took away one star because their lunch price is $10.00 but I was charged $10.90...maybe because of my allergy accommodations?  Not sure. But I still thoroughly enjoyed it all.,4.0
Great sushi at a decent price. Nice ambience. Good service. Solid alternative to Momo Sushi Shack if you're looking for a more intimate evening out with a significant other in the Bushwick area.,4.0
Much needed addition to this neighborhood.  The sushi was very fresh and put together well. Came in for a late lunch.  Will update on my next visit.  Friendly staff.,3.0
Had lunch here the other day. The Teriaki Chicken lunch box. This was the best japenese lunch box i have ever had. It wasnt the normal small box. It was a super large plate with everything fresh. Will be back,5.0
"I've passed this place quite a few times since its opening mainly because I'm partial to my favorite sushi restaurant. I've generally always been nervous about trying new places, but I'm glad that I finally took the plunge and ordered here. I ordered miso soup, edamame and a Phoenix roll and it was all fresh and delicious. I will definitely be back!",5.0
"I have never had a bad meal at this restaurant (and I live down the block so I go often!). Service is always quick and the staff is very friendly. Amazing sushi, and their lunch special is phenomenal (8-10 dollars for a large meal. And it is offered on Saturdays!). The decor and general atmosphere of the restaurant is a very welcome addition to the neighborhood. I recommend Akaru fully!",5.0
New spot in Bushwick! Not many sushi places in the area. The food was delish! The sushi was very fresh and they offered a brown rice option. The prices were great and they deliver! The have a great lunch menu too.... I will be back!,5.0
