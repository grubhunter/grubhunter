"I love the pizza here!! And Dom uses his own fresh herbs grown in the window.  The nickname of this place is ""Dirty Dom's"" - but I don't care (usually I would - luckily I wasn't told the nick name until after I ate his pizza.)  Prices are a bit steep but he uses the best ingredients (I hate cheap mozzarella), his sauce is cooked well and very tasty and his crust is delicious and on the thin side. (I don't like doughy pizza crust.) It's a small place so we go there in the warm weather & eat standing up outside.",5.0
"It's 12:26pm ... Friday afternoon ... Ur recording states u r opened at 12pm... Where the hell r u ???? If u r not opening today, u should let us know ...All forgiven ... Omg ... U have a great pizza!!!  The crust IS delicious !!!!",5.0

"Holy crap does this place live up to expectations. The pizza is hands down the best I have ever had. Cheesy, flavorful sauce & crispy but not dry crust. The Sicilian slice ain't too shabby either. It's well worth the price/trip/hassle. If you're a pizza fanatic you have to try this place. If you're not a pizza fanatic you have to try this place.",5.0
"Is this pizza overpiced? Yes. Will you be waiting for an hour or more? Yes. Is this the best pizza you will ever eat? Quite possibly Yes._________________________________Pizza:Cheese: 10/10The mozzarella is delicate, perfectly melty, and milky. The extra parmesan sprinkled on adds another layer of texture in the savory oil on top of the slice. Sauce: 10/10The tomato sauce is ripe and naturally sweet, with small chunks of plum tomatoes in the sauce. Tastes fresh and full of life, not canned and flat in flavor.Crust 7/10Harder than other crusts I've tried. The slice ""crunches"" when you fold it in half. But I think this is appropriate as it adds a firmer base to hold up all the melty cheese, sauce and olive oil. The only thing I would note is that our pie was a little charred, and the crust could be a little more chewier (personal preference)Wait Time :1/10Expect to wait an hour or more. It's long and there's no way to get around that. Really, set aside an afternoon to come here.Price: 1/10$30 something for a pie, $5-6 for a slice. Makes the most sense to split a pie with a friend and pay around $15 per person._________________________________The little sprinkle of chopped basil is sweet and peppery. The pizza slices are a little oiler than other slices I've had, but note that it's not a sick, greasy oil. It's the aromatic and fruity olive oil combined with the sweet oil coming from the cheese. If wait time and price was not an issue, I think we might all agree that this is quite possibly the best slice of Pizza you may ever eat. Is it worth $30 for a pie and an hour plus wait? At least once yes.",5.0
"Whether Di Fara is one of the best pizza joints in New York is subjective. Personally, I love their pizza. This place is a MUST go for me every time I come back to New York. There is always a line no matter what time of the day you come. If you order a slice of pizza, you'll be in and out relatively quick. If you order a pie, that'll be an hour wait. Personal advice: make sure you get up there and put in your order and don't let nobody cut you off and delay you from getting that delicious pizza. There are a few tables inside where you can sit and enjoy the pizza, but they're usually occupied by people.Their pies cost around $35 which is totally worth it in my opinion and I want to say they cut it up to about 8 slices total. For one slice of pizza its $5. I highly recommend the pie and have leftovers because leftover pizza is da bomb!Dom makes all the pies himself still for the most part. The pies are made when after you order. Every thing is fresh. The dough, the ingredients...and you can most definitely taste it. Usually, the pies come out a bit burnt, but that's the allure of the pizza here in my opinion.",5.0
"Got here 1215pm on a Thursday and was maybe a 5 min wait. Not very busy. Ordered 2 regular slices with pepperoni. Wanted one square but since they just opened it would have been a 40min wait. Very limited seating, 3 fold out tables with maybe 15 chairs all together. Taste: 8/10 very good slice. Sauce was light and not much oil. It tasted like olive oil. Cheese was delicious and not heavy at all. Surprisingly the crust was actually very good. Crispy crust not chewy.There is a lot of hype for this place and much of it is warranted. Best slice I've ever had? I don't know. I'm a big fan of John's on Bleecker street. Nevertheless, if you want a good slice this is definitely worth it. $5 plus a $1 for a topping is a little much though. But all their ingredients are fresh and these days the price of cheese is ridiculous. Glad they didn't raise the price to $7.Ended up staying til 215 because I was enjoying a conversation with a guy who had been eating there since December 1965 (the place opened in '65). As luck would have it channel 11 news stopped in to ask Domenic what he thought of de blasio and lasting eating with a knife and fork. They then interviewed Lloyd( the guy I met, who also refused to give his last name to the PIX lol). Lloyd then recommended Ostrovitsky's bakery, which I gladly went to for desert. All in all very successful trip.",5.0
"I dare say, the best pizza I ever ate. I have had my fair share, but you can taste the freshness and can tell that these pies are made with care. Do you care that the place can use a renovation?  Not when what comes out of these generations old ovens is as good as it gets. In a rush? Fahggedaboutit!Kinda pricey, you say?  You don't hear 'em complaining at Per Se, do ya?I can rest in peace.",5.0
"I'm really confused why this pizza is so highly rated.  It's pretty impressive that Dom makes every pie himself but when we finally got our order after a 2 hour wait, it was so disappointing.  We were told that our order would be ready in an hour and so we left to get a drink, but when we returned we were told that they needed a break and the pizzeris was going to close for a while.  We waited some more as the line grew.The majority of our pie was burnt so I was only able to eat the toppings which were tasty.  But at $5 a slice and a 2 hour wait, I really expected to be blown away. The Sicilian slice was way better than the regular.  Mostly because it had more sauce (and flavor) and was Not burnt.  I've definitely had better slices elsewhere without the wait.",2.0
"Lots and lots of fanfare here. It's a religious experience - people taking pictures of the old man like he's a crying Mother Mary statue. You get it.Do I get it? Kind of. It's old school, it's done right. Fanfare warranted? You be the judge.There was an incredible moment during my 40 minute wait for a slice:Two young dudes walk in, ask about slices, and are told wait is 25 minutes. They say, ""that's crazy"" and head out. Not disrespectfully, just shocked, and not interested in waiting I suppose. The lady running the show points out that all these people waiting must be crazy then... again, not disrespectful, just pointing out... Then the guy making square pies in the back - who comes out to throw a couple in the oven every now and then - maybe her brother? He points out the possibility that everyone is a little crazy somewhere, somehow, and that there's plenty of room for the possibility that his sister, and those young kids, are both correct. Very cool.Anyway, it's good pizza. Only had a plain round slice, but the nice sauce, freshly grated fresh mozzarella and parmesan, and fresh basil go a long way. The crust was very nice. Simple, good flavor, right amount of char and crispness. Not a floppy NY slice, not a New Haven chew-fest. A proper Brooklyn slice. Understand it. Love it. Spread the knowledge.",4.0

I loved the fresh basil, and maybe I'm picky, but don't just put a clump of four leaves on my pizza. Separate them, and chop up the big leaves at least a little for me. Again, it wasn't bad.

"Came here Because I fancy myself a pizza connoisseur and since this made a lot of people's list of must have Pizzas in NY had to give it a go.  After a fail attempt to go to a near by bike shop I came here with my girl and my son.  We were extremely hungry and a made a stop for a quick bite, well when I saw in the reviews that Di Fara had long lines, they were not kidding. Long lines and a 40 minute wait later we got our 2 regular slices and 2 more with prosciutto on it.  After eating the slices we realized that we should've gotten a pie because it was a good a bit too oily but still good. I'm amazed that Dom is still making them pies all by himself, but that is what makes Di Fara, Dom makes them how he's always made them, one by one and with much love.I would come back, but I would get a pie next time.",4.0
"So, we finally made the journey to Midwood to see if Di Fara lives up to all the hype. First, it's impressive that this guy has been hand making pizzas everyday for so many years and has earned this type of fame. I think the neighborhood itself has lent a hand to Di Fara's acclaim as it certainly stands out among all the kosher spots in town. Regardless, it's the notoriety that allows a $32 charge for a plain pie and/or a $5-6 slice. I will say, I enjoyed both my square and round slice thoroughly. It's important to note, that while I can appreciate a good char on a pizza, this pizza was straight-up burnt. I'm talking a thick strip of super burnt dough along the bottom of the pie. I will agree with others that the olive oil added to the pie makes for a somewhat greasy slice; however, I think that grease is part of what gives this pie such good flavor. It's not that nasty orange grease from cheap mozzarella that you so often find on sub-par pizza, it's olive oil. There's a whole system in place which involves queuing up outside and placing your order for pies or slices at the window, then going for a walk/standing around outside and waiting anywhere from thirty minutes to three hours, and then you're allowed to stand inside until they call your name. Still at that point, you may have to take those pies you waited hours for somewhere else to eat as there's only a few tables in the back. To sum it all up, I appreciate that the man is so dedicated to his business and that he's using fresh quality ingredients. Bottom line is: it works, even with the excessive char and grease and really, I enjoyed my slices thoroughly. When you take all the hassle into account, I'd say it's probably only worth a trip out here once or twice. I can't drop stars for the location or the wait; it was my choice to schlep out there and you have to realize once a place becomes an institution, a wait is inevitable.",4.0
"This review is not for the pizza itself, which is pretty good. This review gives equal weight to the food and our experience -- which was awful. We won't be coming back. You may not agree with me on this point, but I really don't have a masochistic tilt -- like at all. You aren't going to make me enjoy a dish more by torturing me before I eat it and then expecting me to give it extra stars because of the contrast between the food and the bad experience getting to the food. I'm not a lab rat, I'm a human being. Stop trying to brainwash me. Honestly guys, the pizza ain't that good. It's good, but let's be real: flour, tomatoes, cheese, basil. I've spent 3 months in Italy and this pizza has nothing on Italy. If you want good pizza, go to Italy because you will get great pizza and you will be happy. Sometimes I think New Yorkers want to be miserable. Di Fara is just further proof of that. Your wait time will not be accurate. If you're lucky, you will have a crate to sit on while you wait. They lock the door so no one can come in without their permission, but the inside is super ugly -- tables and chairs that look like they were stolen from PS _____ arts and crafts room. The idea that there's only one man in New York who can make good pizza is bullshit. Making pizza is simple. You stretch out some dough, put on the toppings, put it in the oven and voila. Anyone can do it. The idea that the water in New York makes for better pizza is even more bullshit. Seriously, if you believe that, you are a total idiot. So little water goes into pizza, and water is literally the cheapest ingredient in ANY dish. If it were the water, someone would be shipping water from New York to California. It ain't the smelly-ass New York water. Trust me on that. I don't know New York Pizza that well, but for just-as-good pizza and a 100,000,000x more pleasant experience, come to Vito's in Beverly Hills.",2.0

He really takes his time on getting it out of the oven and snipping the basil on top. I was prepared for the line so no big deal.The disappointment comes to the pizza itself. It looks like the top oven doesn't cook like the bottom oven. Certain pizzas came out way overdone. My pizza was unfortunately one of the overdone ones and turned to cardboard real fast. The first few bites of the first slice were heaven; the rest of the pizza was cold and hard in less than 5 minutes. So disappointing. I do not find it to be worth the wait.Also, the amount of oil drizzled on top is, shall we say, an expeditious laxative.",2.0
"I've been here many times. I remember when a regular square was only $4. Now it's $6 a square. The square is way better than the slice. From experience, wait time here ranges from 10 minutes to 3 hours. I want to give this place a lower rating because I feel the pizza is overrated and pizza is occasionally served burnt but I can't give Di Fara's any less than 4 stars because I find myself craving the distinct pizza. The crust is crispy from the pool of olive oil placed in the pan before it is baked. This basically fries the crust and yields this incredible crunch (unexpected for a slice this thick). After the pizza is taken out, more olive oil is drizzled over the pie and topped with fresh basil. This place attracts people of all kinds. Bikers eating next to people in suits.",4.0
"Well, it is good pizza. Just not as good as I expected after a wait that long. And the price of course. What you pay for is the experience. Watching Dom making your pizza gives you ASMR! I am glad that I tried this place once but probably not going to there again.",4.0
"Dom did not disappoint and the sole pizza maker at this corner joint. He peacefully and joyfully makes the pizza in the background and you wait your turn for your slice/pie. My first slice was perfectly crunchy, cheesy, saucey. New York style it holds upright on its own and it is foldable too. The fresh basil they cut before your eyes on each classic slice. I would go back for this true New York Italian slice - nothing fancy - just simple and delicious.",5.0
"Came here Because I fancy myself a pizza connoisseur and since this made a lot of people's list of must have Pizzas in NY had to give it a go.  After a fail attempt to go to a near by bike shop I came here with my girl and my son.  We were extremely hungry and a made a stop for a quick bite, well when I saw in the reviews that Di Fara had long lines, they were not kidding. Long lines and a 40 minute wait later we got our 2 regular slices and 2 more with prosciutto on it.  After eating the slices we realized that we should've gotten a pie because it was a good a bit too oily but still good. I'm amazed that Dom is still making them pies all by himself, but that is what makes Di Fara, Dom makes them how he's always made them, one by one and with much love.I would come back, but I would get a pie next time.",4.0
"So, we finally made the journey to Midwood to see if Di Fara lives up to all the hype. First, it's impressive that this guy has been hand making pizzas everyday for so many years and has earned this type of fame. I think the neighborhood itself has lent a hand to Di Fara's acclaim as it certainly stands out among all the kosher spots in town. Regardless, it's the notoriety that allows a $32 charge for a plain pie and/or a $5-6 slice. I will say, I enjoyed both my square and round slice thoroughly. It's important to note, that while I can appreciate a good char on a pizza, this pizza was straight-up burnt. I'm talking a thick strip of super burnt dough along the bottom of the pie. I will agree with others that the olive oil added to the pie makes for a somewhat greasy slice; however, I think that grease is part of what gives this pie such good flavor. It's not that nasty orange grease from cheap mozzarella that you so often find on sub-par pizza, it's olive oil. There's a whole system in place which involves queuing up outside and placing your order for pies or slices at the window, then going for a walk/standing around outside and waiting anywhere from thirty minutes to three hours, and then you're allowed to stand inside until they call your name. Still at that point, you may have to take those pies you waited hours for somewhere else to eat as there's only a few tables in the back. To sum it all up, I appreciate that the man is so dedicated to his business and that he's using fresh quality ingredients. Bottom line is: it works, even with the excessive char and grease and really, I enjoyed my slices thoroughly. When you take all the hassle into account, I'd say it's probably only worth a trip out here once or twice. I can't drop stars for the location or the wait; it was my choice to schlep out there and you have to realize once a place becomes an institution, a wait is inevitable.",4.0
"This review is not for the pizza itself, which is pretty good. This review gives equal weight to the food and our experience -- which was awful. We won't be coming back. You may not agree with me on this point, but I really don't have a masochistic tilt -- like at all. You aren't going to make me enjoy a dish more by torturing me before I eat it and then expecting me to give it extra stars because of the contrast between the food and the bad experience getting to the food. I'm not a lab rat, I'm a human being. Stop trying to brainwash me. Honestly guys, the pizza ain't that good. It's good, but let's be real: flour, tomatoes, cheese, basil. I've spent 3 months in Italy and this pizza has nothing on Italy. If you want good pizza, go to Italy because you will get great pizza and you will be happy. Sometimes I think New Yorkers want to be miserable. Di Fara is just further proof of that. Your wait time will not be accurate. If you're lucky, you will have a crate to sit on while you wait. They lock the door so no one can come in without their permission, but the inside is super ugly -- tables and chairs that look like they were stolen from PS _____ arts and crafts room. The idea that there's only one man in New York who can make good pizza is bullshit. Making pizza is simple. You stretch out some dough, put on the toppings, put it in the oven and voila. Anyone can do it. The idea that the water in New York makes for better pizza is even more bullshit. Seriously, if you believe that, you are a total idiot. So little water goes into pizza, and water is literally the cheapest ingredient in ANY dish. If it were the water, someone would be shipping water from New York to California. It ain't the smelly-ass New York water. Trust me on that. I don't know New York Pizza that well, but for just-as-good pizza and a 100,000,000x more pleasant experience, come to Vito's in Beverly Hills.",2.0
"Is this a good pizza, yes. Do they make a good slice, yes. The crust has a complex flavor and just the right combination of elaticity and drispness. The sauce is perfectly balanced, not too much garlic, not too sweet, not too savory and not too salty. They put just the right amount of cheese on it, too. Is a slice of this pizza worth $5.00 and a whole pie $30. No. Not by a long shot.",4.0

"A pizzeria with enormous amount of reviews is either a hit or a miss. But if you ever wondered what reviews can do to a place, you need to see the lines outside the pizza place on ave J in Brooklyn. Mostly hipsters, but not only. So I joins the line.Surprisingly people were ok with the long line. Maybe they know something that I don't...Inside it is a place that reminded me of my local pizza place. When I was 20 years old lol which is actually kind of cool. The pizza was good.

"So you're not sure about visiting. Here's a reviews meta-analysis. Me, like you, have read a lot of the reviews, specially from the Elites, thank you guys. This is what you will first off gather:1- The lines are long2- The pies and slices are expensive3- They are greasy4- They are salty5- There's no seating space6- You will wait for hours7- The crust is more charred than normalBut I will tell you what was true for MY SUNDAY, October 11, 2015 at 7:30pm and 65F weather outside:1- Parking, right at the corner2- No lines outside, Only waited 5 minutes for the slice3- Straight out of the oven, piping hot and leaking fat4- There were available tables and chairs (albeit dirty)5- Regular slice $5 (no toppings)6- They ran out of sicilian slices (boo)7- Greasy (normal), but it was very salty, and I am by no means a low salt eating person. That is true, as well as the crust, which was chewy and warm, thin and definitely one of my favorite parts. Fresh basil cut on top before serving makes all the difference, oh that aroma. The tomato sauce is excellent (barely sweet, fresh tasting, non acidic)8- Yelp says it closes at 9pm, they hung a closing sign at 8pm, possibly due to low clientele? because it wasn't due to long lines for sure.I was unsure whether it was worth the wait before I came. To my surprise there was no wait and the slice was very good, not the best i have ever had, but if there's one thing you must do in Brooklyn (notice I am not saying NYC), you should visit Di Fara. Some people don't think its worth it, some love it, but honestly, the man has gotten where he is for a reason. At one point in time, he made an amazing pie and critics and food lovers loved it (as well as the majority of visitors). So Yes, you should go and have it at least once in your life. It's only $5 that may change your life. Just may. And do visit before it is no longer there, if you know what i mean.Btw, I lived in Brooklyn for 9 years and have had my fair share of pizza slices in all kinds of places and all kinds of times (4am anyone?).

"I had a good experience when I was a high schooler about 10 (shoot....has it been 10 years since high school already?!) years ago. Had a great experience 2 years ago. But maybe that was Di Fara's peak because this time around, the pizza was just meh.The crust into about halfway into the slice is pretty burnt, so that's really all you're tasting. Maybe some people like that burnt flavor but I certainly do not. Plus, even if you order it with toppings, you don't get a lot of ingredients. So you might as well just save a few bucks and order it without.The place is small but they treat it like it's some exclusive club. They rope off the entrance and even hired a (teenaged) bouncer to make sure nobody gets in.After waiting online for about half an hour, and then another 40 min - 1 hour for the actual pizza, you start to realize somewhere down the line that it really isn't worth it - time wise, or money wise (it isn't exactly cheap....a single slice will set you back $5 and I feel like I've had dollar slices in the city that I've enjoyed more).I feel like people who love Di Fara's are really just holding onto this memory that they had years ago of what Brooklyn pizza is like.

If you have extra you can probably sell it for double to some poor sop still waiting. Also go for the square.

"I've been going here for about 15 years now. The place is a dive. For me not a bad thing if the food is off the charts. For me this is the absolute best square slice I've ever eaten! Molten hot oil, perfect char and the best three cheeses you can put over what ever delicious tomato sauce he uses. I hate giving up secrets but every time We go we get at least two square pies. One to eat there that day and the other to take home and freeze for a day when I just can't wait an hour for a pie. The bonus days are while I'm waiting for my pies and he's serving the single slice line of people i get to sneak an appetizer square slice that hasn't been claimed.

"I came all the way to Brooklyn after a friend recommended that I come here for some good pizza. I was lucky to have only waited only 5-10 minutes, after reading some of the reviews on here saying that customers would even form a line outside the store before it's even opened. You know a pizza place is good by looking at its storefront with its serif vintage font, wooden counters and a old man working on the pizza behind the counter.  It may not be the most hygienic pizzeria in the world (workers not wearing hats, flies around the whole store, used pizza pans on the tables), but this will do. I had the regular slice. I had to wait a few minutes but I was satisfied at the fact that my order came fresh out of the oven. After the pie came out, freshly cut basil is sprinkled on top of the whole pie. The price is a bit steep, but once in a while is ok. The slice sort of had a thin crust feel to it with the cheese melting and running off. Overall, I enjoyed my pizza here and it's great to know that there's still pizza stores from 1965 floating around NYC.",5.0

"Di Fara is for the pizza freaks out there. You know who you are. Dom DeMarco is the master, and you are his worthless slave! He'll make you stand on the sidewalk, not up front, but around the freaking corner. He doesn't care whether it's hot and humid or snowing like a mother. You wait with the rest of the freaks for your turn. When you finally get to order, he doesn't ask your name. You are reduced to your initials, then you wait some more! After another agonizing wait, he finally lets you inside. The tables and chairs look beaten and abused. The chair you're sitting in is barely hanging on. There's no AC up in here, and there never will be! If you want to get really dirty, set foot in the bathroom, if you dare. But none of that matters, after all of that torture, one bite and he owns you. Gotcha! Dom is the cutest pizza making grandpa I have ever seen. He single handedly produces each delicious Sicilian pizza. As with any thin crust, the less toppings the better. The pie is an oily hot mess, but slurping it up is what makes it so damn delicious. There are no utensils meaning, there is no clean or easy way to eat it. It will get all over one's lips and hands and quite possibly even the table or one's clothes if one is not careful. The square pizza does indeed taste better than the round. The price per slice is steep, but a whole pie is actually a good value. Waiting on Avenue J in the humid month of July and sitting on a rickety folding chair with no AC is just plain torture. But if Dom De Marco can smile in the heat as he stands over each of his creations, so can we. I'm glad I tasted it, but would I return? Maybe if I happen to be around Midwood in the cooler months and can order a whole pie to share with enough people. Btw you may want to bring your own hand sanitizer, and you probably won't want to use the restroom here.",4.0
"Pizza lovers must make the journey to Di Fara's at least once. The pies, both square and regular, are perfect in their own ways. Personally, I prefer the square because the sauce and toppings can fully be enjoyed, while the regular is great to enjoy just the basil and cheese as the main element. Best thing about these pies are the hand prints baked into the crust from Dom personally rounding out the dough.    To all those saying that the pizza in Italy is better, remember this is CLASSIC NEW YORK STYLE PIZZA. Not Neapolitan, not al taglio, & not Sicilian. Di Fara's is the definitive New York Style Pizza Parlor. Places like Di Fara's help remind why and how pizza has become a stable of American cuisine.       The wait is just as long as the trip for me, but it is always worth it. Dom is the pizza maestro.",5.0
"Of course I have read many articles and have known about this Di Farra for years. I just never got the chance to get down to Midwood and the famous shop. I had gotten a special $15 offer to see the Beach Boys  at the beautifully restored Kings Theatre, on Flatbush Ave., Tuesday February 9. So I saw that as a perfect opportunity to stop by and try a delicious pizza made by Dom expert pizza maker. I called and they informed me that Tuesday was not a very busy day. February 9 happened to be national pizza day so what better time to visit. I arrived and as soon as I came up out of the subway station DI Farra was the first thing I saw when I looked across the street.It was about 3 PM when I arrived and no  line outside. But there were several people in this small seating area/dining room. I decided to keep it simple and ordered a regular cheese pie. Dom was hard at work. There was a camera crew there from the food network. In about 15 minutes my pizza came out. What a beautiful looking pie. I figured I'd only have four slices and save the rest for later. I eagerly brought the pizza pie back to the long table at the back of the dining room.The wonderful buffalo mozzarella mixed with Parmesan cheese and the fresh basil leaves had such a wonderful aroma. I took out the first slice and Took a bite. The first thing that struck me was how incredibly delicious the actual crust was. It had a full rich deep flavor. Perfect chewiness crispy without being too thin or too thick. The sauce was very flavorful and unique and the three parts buffalo mozzarella cheese really made the difference. The Parmesan cheese along with the basil leaves and olive oil that's poured onto the pizza before it's cooked all work very well together perfectly proportioned which make the pizza absolutely delicious. I've tried pizza at Lombardi's, john's, Totino's and I have to say thatDI Farra definitely had the edge on all those three iconic places. The care that goes into each one of the pizzas , as well as the loving hands of one man. along with the high-quality ingredients is what makes this pizza place worthy of the long trek and higher price definitely worth it.I talked to Dom and told him I was very happy with the pizza. He thanked me and smiled. As I said the food network was there and they were interviewing some people near the front of the dining room while I was eating my pizza. Which I managed to finish off seven of the eight slices. I was actually interviewed by the food network as well. So I hope to see this segment on DI Farra will run  sometime in early September. The weekend Friday Saturday and Sunday is an absolute madhouse . So if you want to experience one of the best pizzas you'll ever have try to come on a Tuesday Wednesday or Thursday.",5.0
"This is a old time Brooklyn Pizzaria that is run by Nick Di Fara. He makes every pizza himself and is helped by his adult  children. He uses the best ingredients and the pizza's are amazing, fresh cut Basil, Buffalo Mozzarella and pure extra virgin olive oil on a fresh semolina crust.

"This is the best slice of pizza (who are we kidding, the best PIE of pizza) I've ever had. Fine, you win this time, Dom. But here's a totally random list of things you can do in two hours:- Run ~32 miles (at world record mile pace)- Bike ~60 miles (at average Tour de France pace)- Eat 744 hot dogs (assuming this year's champ kept his 10-minute pace)- Fly from New York to Chicago- Drive from D.C. to Philadelphia- Be almost done your wait for a pizza at Di FaraEvery pie is hand-made by the guy in all of these pictures, and that's admirable and all, but as a wise man once said, Henry Ford isn't famous for hand-manufacturing each Model-T. There's a point where you get some efficiencies, and that point needs to be a long time ago.Ok, enough of the complaining. This pizza was AWESOME. I strongly recommend you eat here if a) you're about to leave the country and won't have pizza for several weeks, or b) want to quit pizza cold turkey. Why? Because nothing will compare to it. It's unbelievable. Saying that other places are ""almost as good"" is like saying that Delaware has ""lots of skyscrapers"". I went to Roberta's the day before, and I don't even remember it. A top-10 place in NYC, and it didn't hold a candle to Di Fara. So yea, enjoy, it's awesome, but don't come hungry.",5.0
Came on a noon Friday and no line or wait at all. Classic pie was great but a bit too greasy for us.  Service was good and def would revisit if minimal wait.  Not sure I'd do it if I had to wait beyond 15 mins.,4.0
"I've been going here for about 15 years now. The place is a dive. For me not a bad thing if the food is off the charts. For me this is the absolute best square slice I've ever eaten! Molten hot oil, perfect char and the best three cheeses you can put over what ever delicious tomato sauce he uses. I hate giving up secrets but every time We go we get at least two square pies. One to eat there that day and the other to take home and freeze for a day when I just can't wait an hour for a pie. The bonus days are while I'm waiting for my pies and he's serving the single slice line of people i get to sneak an appetizer square slice that hasn't been claimed. I've occasionally tried a round slice but not the best for me. If you can handle it and have a big party you have to eventually try the calzone. It's delicious too. Di Fara Sicilian square 5 solid stars.",5.0
"I came all the way to Brooklyn after a friend recommended that I come here for some good pizza. I was lucky to have only waited only 5-10 minutes, after reading some of the reviews on here saying that customers would even form a line outside the store before it's even opened. You know a pizza place is good by looking at its storefront with its serif vintage font, wooden counters and a old man working on the pizza behind the counter.  It may not be the most hygienic pizzeria in the world (workers not wearing hats, flies around the whole store, used pizza pans on the tables), but this will do. I had the regular slice. I had to wait a few minutes but I was satisfied at the fact that my order came fresh out of the oven. After the pie came out, freshly cut basil is sprinkled on top of the whole pie. The price is a bit steep, but once in a while is ok. The slice sort of had a thin crust feel to it with the cheese melting and running off. Overall, I enjoyed my pizza here and it's great to know that there's still pizza stores from 1965 floating around NYC.",5.0

"Di Fara is for the pizza freaks out there. You know who you are. Dom DeMarco is the master, and you are his worthless slave! He'll make you stand on the sidewalk, not up front, but around the freaking corner. He doesn't care whether it's hot and humid or snowing like a mother. You wait with the rest of the freaks for your turn. When you finally get to order, he doesn't ask your name. You are reduced to your initials, then you wait some more! After another agonizing wait, he finally lets you inside. The tables and chairs look beaten and abused. The chair you're sitting in is barely hanging on. There's no AC up in here, and there never will be! If you want to get really dirty, set foot in the bathroom, if you dare. But none of that matters, after all of that torture, one bite and he owns you. Gotcha! Dom is the cutest pizza making grandpa I have ever seen. He single handedly produces each delicious Sicilian pizza. As with any thin crust, the less toppings the better. The pie is an oily hot mess, but slurping it up is what makes it so damn delicious. There are no utensils meaning, there is no clean or easy way to eat it. It will get all over one's lips and hands and quite possibly even the table or one's clothes if one is not careful. The square pizza does indeed taste better than the round. The price per slice is steep, but a whole pie is actually a good value. Waiting on Avenue J in the humid month of July and sitting on a rickety folding chair with no AC is just plain torture.

"This is by far THE best pizza I've tasted in NY. The owner whom which is in his 70's and still making pizza till this day is running the show still.The first thing I noticed was the small intimate store itself. A couple tables and the kitchen itself. Dom, the founder and pizza godfather was in the kitchen rolling dough and making the pizza by hand, and still keeping a closed body language. The whole hr me and my friends were there, there was not one time where he acknowledged the customers or even faced forward; he just stared at his cooking the whole time and would peep a word or two to his son who is serving the pizza and ringing the customers up. We ate two different kinds of pizzas: traditional Sicilian pie style pizza & the original flat crust. The tomato sauce is fresh and well pronounced as well as the cheese. The crust from the Sicilian style is crispy and almost had this fried-texture to it. The pepperoni soaked up the fresh olive oil and curled up to make this nice crispy texture. Everything about both types of pizzas was tremendous. I love how fresh their pizzas are! Dom even takes a bush pile of fresh basil and just trims is down! It's a sight of beauty when you see the cheese bubble on top and the basil leaves slowly drop on the pizza like autumn leaves.I am thankful to witness Dom DeMarco put in work while he's still healthy and making the pizza. This is a once in a lifetime opportunity. The pizza is really worth the trip to BK and it tastes like no other. Hands down the best pizza I've ever had.",5.0

"I can't believe it has taken me this long to write this review. Di Fara's is certainly an institution and worth making a trip to at least once, though if you live in NYC, it probably won't just be once. It looks like your standard mom and pop pizza shop, but the pizza here is far from average. It's got a hell of a lot more love, more impressive ingredients, and way more flavor.

If he is not there, there's no pizza. That also means there is a limited number of pies made each day. If you watch him, you'll notice how carefully he assembles each pie. It's pretty amazing.  He uses fresh ingredients, mostly imported, several different kinds of cheese and tops it all off with a generous drizzle of olive oil and fresh basil. The pizzas are cooked in a very hot oven, which gives them a crispy crust and a good bit of char. The result of all of these steps is a very savory, rich, and flavorful pizza. It's got a nice salty bite to it as well if you're into that sort of thing. I have tried both the regular pizza and the Sicilian. Both are good, but I prefer his Sicilian mainly because I think the extra crust stands up a little better to the overwhelming flavor of everything else.

"This is by far THE best pizza I've tasted in NY. The owner whom which is in his 70's and still making pizza till this day is running the show still.The first thing I noticed was the small intimate store itself. A couple tables and the kitchen itself. Dom, the founder and pizza godfather was in the kitchen rolling dough and making the pizza by hand, and still keeping a closed body language. The whole hr me and my friends were there, there was not one time where he acknowledged the customers or even faced forward; he just stared at his cooking the whole time and would peep a word or two to his son who is serving the pizza and ringing the customers up. We ate two different kinds of pizzas: traditional Sicilian pie style pizza & the original flat crust. The tomato sauce is fresh and well pronounced as well as the cheese. The crust from the Sicilian style is crispy and almost had this fried-texture to it. The pepperoni soaked up the fresh olive oil and curled up to make this nice crispy texture. Everything about both types of pizzas was tremendous. I love how fresh their pizzas are! Dom even takes a bush pile of fresh basil and just trims is down! It's a sight of beauty when you see the cheese bubble on top and the basil leaves slowly drop on the pizza like autumn leaves.I am thankful to witness Dom DeMarco put in work while he's still healthy and making the pizza. This is a once in a lifetime opportunity. The pizza is really worth the trip to BK and it tastes like no other. Hands down the best pizza I've ever had.",5.0

"Read it was the best. Decided to stop in last Sunday and get a few slices -on the weekend supposedly you'll wait a while (for me it was an hour to order and 30 min to get my 2 slices). They cut off the line around 4PM because I think they were running out of ingredients  (everything seems to be completely fresh that they use). To the pizza: I wanted a square and a regular piece but they were done with the squares for the day so I got 2 regular.This is literally melt in your mouth pizza -oily, not too much cheese or sauce (which usually for me the more cheese the better but not in this case). Everything was delicious and left a flavor that you do not want to leave from your mouth. Never experienced pizza like this it's just different. I really don't want to put this in the same category as what I've known to be pizza just because it is a unique experience.",5.0
"Today was my second time going here. First time was good, second time was only ok, Dough was salty and pizza slices were tiny.

I will not be back.If you're looking for good pizza without the hype I would suggest you get back on the Q train, get off at Newkirk Plaza and go to Lo Duca pizza. Pizza is just as good but cheaper and minus the long lines and hype.P.S. this place is super divey. No one even comes out to wipe the only 3 tables in this establishment.

"What else can be said about Di Fara Pizza? I'm writing this review not so much to contribute any new insight, but for me to put down my thoughts after experiencing what could be one of best slices of pizza I have ever tasted.Domenico DeMarco's life has almost reached mythical status, as his story has been retold over and over through various food blogs, television shows, and documentaries - a man who immigrated from the Italian province of Caserta while in his 20s, and then opening a pizza shop on Avenue J in Brooklyn in 1964, where Dom has personally made every single pizza by hand since it opened. When you have guys like Anthony Bourdain and Christopher Kimball declaring this could very well be the best pizza, you listen...So given all this, does the place live up to the hype? I would say yes. I have had a small handful of life-changing meals in my life, for example my first XLB at Din Tai Fung in Taipei, or my first SJB at Yang's Dumpling in Shanghai, or my first beef rib at Black's BBQ in Lockhart, TX...and now Di Fara Pizza might make the short list for me. I had heard stories of long waits, but luckily I came in early on lunch on a weekday so the wait wasn't too bad at all. I ordered two slices of the regular pie. As others have mentioned, watching Dom at work is a joy - pizza making to him is an art form, and each pie is masterfully put together. There is something endearing about someone who is in business solely for the love of his craft, and nothing else - sure he could hire workers or let others help him make his pizza, but Dom's going to have none of that. I ate my first slice of pizza, and was absolutely in heaven. The pie was simply perfect in its simplicity. Harmoniously balanced with just the right amount of cheese, basil, olive oil, and tomato...and the crust was crisp and soft on the inside while being piping hot. Apparently almost all the ingredients are imported from Italy, and you can taste the quality and the freshness. The second slice was even more satisfying than the first, if that was even possible.Was this the best pizza I had ever eaten? Maybe, maybe not - but what made the place special for me and worthy of the hype was Domenico DeMarco himself...watching him meticulously assembling each pie was magical, and there's a certain nostalgia knowing that what you're experiencing was very much the same as it was thirty-forty years ago.TLDR:- this review does not say anything new- a must-try for pizza lovers!",5.0

"Any serious pizza lover has to go to Di Fara at some point in his life, so yesterday was my turn. As the other 1700+ reviews have all stated, this is an unassuming old school pizzeria far away from Manhattan, with one exceptional man running the show.My husband and I got REALLY lucky in that we only had to wait around 10 minutes for 2 pepperoni slices. The employee shouted ""Kathy, pepperoni pie for Kathy. Kathy?"" And since Kathy didn't show up immediately, we were able to nab 2 slices from her pie. Sorry Kathy.Where Di Fara really excels is the crust. I have had pepperoni this good, I have had sprinkles of parmegiano reggiano and fresh basil, I have had this perfect balance of cheese and excellent sauce. However, I have not encountered this special or unique of a crust. It is almost reminiscent of a really good baguette from a Parisian bakery. It's that kind of fantastic bread work.Of course as other people have mentioned, Di Fara fails because it's unapproachable. To wait 45 minutes for a pie, or 2 slices, and to consider that a ""short wait time"" is absolutely insane. When you enter the pizzeria, it's a zoo. There's no line structure, just a bunch of hipsters standing around.

"Great slice made with tlc and time from someone who has been making pizzas for the last 50 yrs. As you watch him make your pizza in his kitchen, you kind of want to help him. You watch him stretch the dough, knead it with his experience; Spread sauce; Freshly grate cheese onto your pizza. This is not a place for you to order a number of pies to go. It's a place meant for you to eat your pizza fresh right after its done, kind of like how you're supposed to eat sashimi the moment its served. The thin foldable crust and cheese at first made the perfect bite. Then, the crust gets pretty hard to chew if you wait too long to eat it. The crust can also be a bit on the salty side and he could have possibly drizzled a bit too much olive oil for your liking. I enjoyed the regular and Sicilian slice, however, eat it fresh. Don't wait and let it go to waste. Cash only. Yes there is cola in a bottle.",4.0
"I'd been wanting to try Di Fara for forever! It's always on the top of every ""best pizza in New York list"" and foodies are always mentioning in it. I was finally able to make the trek out Midwood over the summer, and even though we arrived a bit after 5 pm, the line was already building up and all of the seats were taken! We put in our order quickly (for two pepperoni slices and one mushroom) and waited for about an hour. It was fun to watch Di Fara pick basil off his basil plant to put on the pizzas, form mozzarella balls, and carefully place pies in the oven. Overall, I thought the pizza was pretty wonderful, but I didn't think it was the best I'd had in New York. I think the hype and wait time also took away from the experience. It was still fun to experience and I would recommend it!! It's definitely still a gem of Brooklyn and it won't be around for forever.",4.0

It was already 7pm on a Friday evening and we decided that since we were in Brooklyn why not pass by Di Fara.I did the mistake of going hungry here and since we were that hungry we should've ordered the Sicilian Pie instead of 4 regular slices. We opted for the slices because it was a shorter wait.  I have to say that it doesn't matter the wait time, it is worth it.Yes, the decor of the place is not eye worthy and the place needs an uplift but Di Fara is one of the spots that you dont go for decoration, you go for the taste and art of how Dom makes each individual pie with TLC. Also, that bug situation outside of the pizzeria, what are they? It was 40 minutes wait of torture (those things did not step down, they just kept biting away even through pair of jeans, but all forgotten when I took my first ever bite of Dom's famous pizza. Loved that they had Newspaper clippings and awards all over the walls and yes it was one of the best slices I've ever had in Brooklyn, this place should go down in history and become a landmark with so much history taken place, come on NYC and do it!Go for the Sicilian pie and it doesn't matter the wait time just go for it! you will regret it in the end.",5.0

"Pizza is inconsistent (sometimes too charred, sometimes too oily), but when it's good, it's THE BEST. Pretty pricey pie considering the calibre of ingredients going into it is just mediocre. However, when Dom puts his magic into that pie, it's pizza heaven on your taste buds. I know, my review is conflicted. But if you go on a good day, it is totally worth the trek. And if not, at least you can Instagram that time you made a journey to the pizza Mecca of Brooklyn and met the legendary Domenico DeMarco of Di Fara!",4.0
Why is this place so overpriced??? Because of its 2000 reviews or may be because the pizza comes with extra salt and extra extra oil???Never again.,1.0
"Too greasy, salty and thin. Sauce was blue...the cheese fell off and the slice was small.And $35 for a pie. Ha",1.0
"Great slice made with tlc and time from someone who has been making pizzas for the last 50 yrs. As you watch him make your pizza in his kitchen, you kind of want to help him. You watch him stretch the dough, knead it with his experience; Spread sauce; Freshly grate cheese onto your pizza. This is not a place for you to order a number of pies to go. It's a place meant for you to eat your pizza fresh right after its done, kind of like how you're supposed to eat sashimi the moment its served. The thin foldable crust and cheese at first made the perfect bite. Then, the crust gets pretty hard to chew if you wait too long to eat it. The crust can also be a bit on the salty side and he could have possibly drizzled a bit too much olive oil for your liking. I enjoyed the regular and Sicilian slice, however, eat it fresh. Don't wait and let it go to waste. Cash only. Yes there is cola in a bottle.",4.0
"I'd been wanting to try Di Fara for forever! It's always on the top of every ""best pizza in New York list"" and foodies are always mentioning in it. I was finally able to make the trek out Midwood over the summer, and even though we arrived a bit after 5 pm, the line was already building up and all of the seats were taken! We put in our order quickly (for two pepperoni slices and one mushroom) and waited for about an hour. It was fun to watch Di Fara pick basil off his basil plant to put on the pizzas, form mozzarella balls, and carefully place pies in the oven. Overall, I thought the pizza was pretty wonderful, but I didn't think it was the best I'd had in New York. I think the hype and wait time also took away from the experience. It was still fun to experience and I would recommend it!! It's definitely still a gem of Brooklyn and it won't be around for forever.",4.0

"On a failed attempt to go to a bike shop in Sheepshead Bay (it was closed). It was already 7pm on a Friday evening and we decided that since we were in Brooklyn why not pass by Di Fara.I did the mistake of going hungry here and since we were that hungry we should've ordered the Sicilian Pie instead of 4 regular slices. We opted for the slices because it was a shorter wait.  I have to say that it doesn't matter the wait time, it is worth it.Yes, the decor of the place is not eye worthy and the place needs an uplift but Di Fara is one of the spots that you dont go for decoration, you go for the taste and art of how Dom makes each individual pie with TLC. Also, that bug situation outside of the pizzeria, what are they? It was 40 minutes wait of torture (those things did not step down, they just kept biting away even through pair of jeans, but all forgotten when I took my first ever bite of Dom's famous pizza. Loved that they had Newspaper clippings and awards all over the walls and yes it was one of the best slices I've ever had in Brooklyn, this place should go down in history and become a landmark with so much history taken place, come on NYC and do it!Go for the Sicilian pie and it doesn't matter the wait time just go for it! you will regret it in the end.",5.0

"The craziest place in New York City, hands down.

Haha!Seriously, the first time we came here (thank god we weren't hungry) we could not believe how long it was taking to get to the counter to place our order. Even once at the counter it took an eternity before the Pizzaiolo even looked at us. Before that, we were just puzzled and after about 30 minutes of waiting in line a couple ahead of us got fed up, cursed the place and left.

The crust is oily and tastes like absolute heaven.Watching the pizza making is part of the fun. You see the master at work and interestingly, he doesn't seem willing to let his son do anything more than provide the chopped toppings. He shapes the dough, ladles the sauce on, adds three types of cheese, bakes it, cuts fresh basil, and throws parmiggiano cheese on top. Fascinating. And when you finally get to place your order, and you know the one he is working on is yours, you go into a sort of trance. Your anticipation becomes nearly unbearable as he pulls pizzas out of the oven and you just know you will be able to eat yours soon. Finally, yours is out of the oven, he tosses the parm on top, cuts it into eight beautiful slices, and hands you the box. Now you carry it to the nearest table and devour it. Unbearable yet unbelievably satisfying experience with a cheesy pizza ending that never disappoints.The only problem as I see it is that we may not be able to enjoy this for much longer - The Pizza Master Mr. DeMarco is in his 70s.

"We went on a Sunday just as it opened and there was already a line outside. We ordered after about 15-20 minutes and got our pie about an hour later.

The sauce was great, the dough was fantastic and of course the cheese was excellent. Was it worth the wait? I think so, this once.

"Went here at 7 on a Sunday.  Yes the wait sucks, but it was sooo worth it!!  Sure, the pizza is kinda pricey, but it's the BEST pizza I have ever eaten.  Pizza in my area has been RUINED due to how yummy this pizza was.  We ordered the plain pizza as well as a plain scicillian pizza as well (there were 5 of us).  We waited a little more than an hour for the pizza and paid a little more than $60 bucks, but there is nothing to complain about.  The sauce on the pizza alone was fantastic.  I also enjoyed watching the owner, Dom handcraft each and every pizza.  We even watched him trim the fresh basil that goes on top of each and every pizza.  After being allowed into the restaurant  (they only allow you in once your pizza is ready, which is a GREAT IDEA), we sat down and waited a few more minutes.  They brought the scicillian over first but told us to let it sit for at least 5 mins.  That 5 mins was absolute torture.  We were starving!!  Once we could eat the pizza though, it was worth every second of the wait!!  The regular pie was great as well.  The sauce is just sooo good.  We can't wait to go back again!!",5.0
Di Fara Pizza is purely magical. It has this spiritual realm to its taste and vibe. The pizza is more than just perfect. The place opened in 1959 and keeps its legend. Maybe its the old man Domenico DeMarco's trick. This is probably one of the best Pizza in the New York Pizza scene. Absolutely worth the visit and the wait.,5.0
"Torn.The first time I came here, I had a square slice and a regular slice and both were AMAZING. The crust was substantial and held up the pizza with nice crisp. The cheese was perfect in its melty goodness, and the basil freshened up the slice. I said it was the only restaurant in New York City worth waiting hours for.However, I came back recently, and admittedly, it wasn't Dom working, so maybe that's why? But the pizza slices I received were so lackluster, and when I'm paying $5 a slice, I expect it to be amazing. I felt like I could get better pizza in my neighborhood. I want to come back here a third time (and make sure Dom is working) and hope for that heavenly slice again, but it's out of the way and expensive to take a risk on.",3.0
Came on a Saturday afternoon around 1:45 pm. There was no wait to order but about 15 minutes wait for a square slice. The regular slices were available immediately. The pizza was AWESOME. One of the better slices I've had (better than Spumoni Gardens and Totonno's). They have awesome chili oil out to put on the pizza and it's a great addition. Also love how they cut up the fresh basil. The regular slice was better than the square one but both were delicious. Definitely worth the trip there if you live in Manhattan.,5.0
"Good pizza. Great sauce. Moz OK. Toppings (pepperoni and sausage for us) meh. VERY oily.Ridiculous setup. The wait can be anywhere between 1 to 3 hours. Incredibly inconvenient which takes a lot of the pleasure out of any food experience.If you live locally perfect. It's a neighborhood relic from a bygone era. You can swing by when you judge the pie is ready fairly easily as people have done for the decades it's been around. There's a lot of appeal with that kind of place, but I get the impression a lot of people are more impressed by the uniqueness of the establishment and what it represents, rather than the quality of the experience and food.Honestly, unless you are a SERIOUS pizza affcianoado or food adventurer with hours to kill, there's very little point making the trek from farther afield. Plenty of excellent (and distinctly better) pizza elsewhere to try.",3.0

"En route to Coney Island this summer, we paid a visit to our dear friend Di Fara for a very long-awaited pizza meal !  The wait was not terrible, perhaps 15 or so minutes for the slices and about 20 minutes on top of that for the full pie.  It helps to visit Di Fara on a Monday holiday.We ordered one square vegan slice for our pal Ryan.  Di Fara's son was super nice about making the slice vegan for us and warned that some parmesan cheese may accidentally be dusted on it.  We said we would take our chances, and just failed to mention that small disclaimer to Ryan.  It worked out alright though !The cheeseless slice looked positively radiant, topped thick with sun-dried tomatoes and broccoli rabe.  The rest of us shared one plain square slice as an appetizer to our full round pepperoni pie.  The square slice was absolutely delightful - the bottom crust was so crunchy, practically fried in the oven by the generously drizzled layer of olive oil at the bottom of the baking sheet.Though I definitely enjoyed the pizza, my favorite part of the whole dining experience was watching Di Fara in the kitchen working his magic.  Swift scissor snips released lovely leaves of basil onto the bubbling pizza surface.  And with a heavy pour of olive oil, Di Fara completed our pizza masterpiece.  And the pizza was terrifically satisfying: fresh flavors evident of high quality Italian imported ingredients, and the whole pie imbued with the utter charm of a truly remarkable pizza artisan - who doesnt want a pizza dat?",5.0
"Going here is a quest, so you should brace yourself and set aside like 2 hours. We arrived at 12:30 on a Wednesday and waited an hour and 40 minutes to get our pizza. That was a long time and the inside of pizza shop was hot (uncomfortable so), I broke down and left to buy a bagel at one point because I'd forgotten to eat breakfast. There's not much seating and it's just folding table and some beaten up chairs. The pizza is expensive $33 for a large pie, $5 for a slice. That being said, this was some of the best pizza I've ever eaten. Fresh ingredients, amazing sausage, perfect sauce, perfect crust, and fresh basil snipped across it.

"I came here expecting to be blown away.  And although the pizza was good, the rest of the experience is SO TEDIOUS that I had to take away two stars.The BF and I arrived at 4pm, thinking we'd be the first in line for the dinner service starting at 6pm.  We were so smug walking in.  We thought we'd be the second, maybe third pie on order that evening.  We thought we beat them at their own game....So.... we stumble in to find a room already filled with people.  FILLED with people.

"total time capsule eat. this is probably the best cheese pizza slice that I have eaten so far. if you weren't intentionally looking for this place, you'd never think that from the outside it was special as it looks like any generic nyc pizza place. decor probably hasn't changed at all since it first opened in 1965. everything here is old school. dom demarco makes the pies in open view, pulls pizza's & calzones out of the oven, the cashier hand-writes the orders, and there are about a dozen seats in the place that haven't been replaced in a long time. If you have ever watched seinfield, there's an episode about a crepes shop called ""magic pan."" it turned out that the ""magic"" in magic pan came from the fact that a person from the owners family had to roll each crepe. that's exactly what is special about this place. dom has to personally ""bless"" each pie. pretty amusing and amazing. I admire dom's passion for doing this for as long as he has. god bless. was in the neighborhood today and decided to take the dive. there was no line forming outside the door so I thought that was a good sign. wrong. I placed an order for a cheese slice and waited a good 30 minutes or so. some guys ordered two pies and was told that it would be about an hour. but was it worth it? the cheese slice is $5. pies are $30 plus. it's a touch greasy, but yes, the cheese slice was pretty awesome. the blended cheese worked well with the sauce and slightly salty dough. and watching dom and the workers in action and how people waited and waited for their turn to eat some special pizza was pretty captivating.

We had to go around the corner and order a sandwich just to get us through the longer wait (also owned by DiFara's).Also, you'll notice that they have very limited seating - 19 seats to be exact. If they had 20 seats, they would legally need to have a customer bathroom available. Since they don't, they can only offer 19 seats, which means you'll have to stand and wait in this small pizzeria.

When it comes out - you are exhausted, hungry and that first bite is pure sex on the plate. You can really taste the love in the pizza.PS. Don't come if you are looking for atmosphere\service, fast food prep\delivery, etc. This is a 1hr+ experience, with pizza being the star and Dom being the magician.",5.0
"NEWSFLASH: I had a pie here on Tuesday NOT made by Dom DeMarco. It's the first time I've ever seen it. Also, don't listen to Yelp, they're open on Tuesdays now. Always check their Facebook before making the trip because they do switch their hours sometimes. I think it's his son who was making all the pies today, I've seen him in there assisting the old man over the years. We're all better off if the next generation can make pies just like Dom so I'm pulling for the guy. Firstly, it seemed like a more efficient set up. Dom wasn't the fastest mover and always handled everything himself. His son is able to get the pies in and out of the oven quicker and also received a lot of help from the other guy working behind the counter as far as setting out the dough and clipping the basil leaves at the end. I went in on a Tuesday afternoon and was told a half hour for my pie but got it only fifteen minutes. That's by far the fastest I've ever gotten anything here. It seems like his children are a bit more business oriented considering the additions of MD Kitchen, Dolce FATTS, the Di Fara branch in Las Vegas and even just updating the menu in the shop. It's good that his son is open to other people helping him behind the counter as it should allow things to run a bit quicker in there. I can already hear what you're all thinking: is this the first step towards a commercialized, rushed, soulless Di Fara? Are they now going to become the Apple of pizza shops, charging double the amount based on name recognition and trendiness for a product you could get for half price if you're just willing to look less cool doing so? (sorry, Apple fans, but truth is love)The good news is that the pizza was very similar to what we're all used to. The sauce and cheese were exactly the same as when Dom cooks. The only difference was the crust, which was far too thin towards the middle of the pie and too thick towards the outer edge, as well as being undercooked. The normal Di Fara pie always has a good char or is just flat out burnt.  This was very chewy and doughy towards the outer crust, almost closer to a Neapolitan style crust than you would get at Roberta's or Zero Otto Nove. For that reason, right now I'm giving it a four instead of the customary Di Fara 5 star review and will update the next time I get a non-Dom Di Fara pie. One final note: don't be the toolbag that walks in, orders, than loudly starts complaining about how ""it's not the same without Dom"" or asking the guy about to make your pie, ""Hey, why isn't Dom here?"" We get it, we're all very impressed with your pizza expertise but stop being a foodie hipstee and just his children live. They've been working with him their whole lives and they don't need you expressing disappointment before you even take a bite.",4.0

Very skimpy on the onions (really couldn't understand that since onions are cheap) and unmemorable mushrooms. In all, don't need to go back. The general opinion of the group was that Totonno's is better. However, we will continue on the quest for the perfect pizza.",3.0

"It was worth the travel and the waits - FOR ONCE. If this place was in my neighborhood, I'd eat pizza once a week (not a fan of pizza, generally speaking), of course. The excitement was great to see the legendary place and its owner. Pizza was delicious. Greasy, but loved the olive oil on the bottom of the pie, and that fresh basil was everything. Overall a good experience, but I doubt I will go there again just for the pizza.BTW, the bathroom is one of the dirtiest ones that I've ever been to. I came right back out. ;-/",4.0

"The pizza was ""good"" but $5 for a slice, no thanks, I'll go down the block and get a slice just as good for $2.00.On top of that the place was closed due to roaches and mice droppings but has since reopened. I will never go back, you can...........",3.0
"Di Fara Pizza is more of an experience, than a pizza restaurant.The place is not fancy (and I'm generous here), the lines are huge (1 hr wait is common) and location is generic.The pizza itself is a slice of heaven though. But what really makes it a 5-star review is the experience - come here when you are not in a rush and stand in line... place an order and watch Dom do his magic - every pie made from scratch, watch him roll and toss the dough, slice fresh veggies, cut up and shred mozzarella, spread home-made sauce, cut fresh basil and pop it in the oven. When it comes out - you are exhausted, hungry and that first bite is pure sex on the plate. You can really taste the love in the pizza.PS. Don't come if you are looking for atmosphere\service, fast food prep\delivery, etc. This is a 1hr+ experience, with pizza being the star and Dom being the magician.",5.0
"NEWSFLASH: I had a pie here on Tuesday NOT made by Dom DeMarco. It's the first time I've ever seen it. Also, don't listen to Yelp, they're open on Tuesdays now. Always check their Facebook before making the trip because they do switch their hours sometimes. I think it's his son who was making all the pies today, I've seen him in there assisting the old man over the years. We're all better off if the next generation can make pies just like Dom so I'm pulling for the guy. Firstly, it seemed like a more efficient set up. Dom wasn't the fastest mover and always handled everything himself. His son is able to get the pies in and out of the oven quicker and also received a lot of help from the other guy working behind the counter as far as setting out the dough and clipping the basil leaves at the end. I went in on a Tuesday afternoon and was told a half hour for my pie but got it only fifteen minutes. That's by far the fastest I've ever gotten anything here. It seems like his children are a bit more business oriented considering the additions of MD Kitchen, Dolce FATTS, the Di Fara branch in Las Vegas and even just updating the menu in the shop. It's good that his son is open to other people helping him behind the counter as it should allow things to run a bit quicker in there. I can already hear what you're all thinking: is this the first step towards a commercialized, rushed, soulless Di Fara? Are they now going to become the Apple of pizza shops, charging double the amount based on name recognition and trendiness for a product you could get for half price if you're just willing to look less cool doing so? (sorry, Apple fans, but truth is love)The good news is that the pizza was very similar to what we're all used to. The sauce and cheese were exactly the same as when Dom cooks. The only difference was the crust, which was far too thin towards the middle of the pie and too thick towards the outer edge, as well as being undercooked. The normal Di Fara pie always has a good char or is just flat out burnt.  This was very chewy and doughy towards the outer crust, almost closer to a Neapolitan style crust than you would get at Roberta's or Zero Otto Nove. For that reason, right now I'm giving it a four instead of the customary Di Fara 5 star review and will update the next time I get a non-Dom Di Fara pie. One final note: don't be the toolbag that walks in, orders, than loudly starts complaining about how ""it's not the same without Dom"" or asking the guy about to make your pie, ""Hey, why isn't Dom here?"" We get it, we're all very impressed with your pizza expertise but stop being a foodie hipstee and just his children live. They've been working with him their whole lives and they don't need you expressing disappointment before you even take a bite.",4.0

The marinara and fresh mozzarella cheese they use are super delicious although I'd say sometimes they tend to put a little more oil that needed.,4.0

I love their pizza. It's delicious and I'm glad that I came here at least once. The wait was ridiculously long. It's understandable because it's one man making every pie.

"Finally came here on the third time after two failed attempts in which people bailed on me, tsk tsk. My sister, who I practically guilt tripped into coming with me, was happy to learn that we could take the Q train directly there and Di Fara was mere steps from the stop.I had done my research and expected a 40min to 1 hour wait for the pizza. I'm not sure if we got lucky or not, but my friend, who placed the order for a classic pie right at 6pm when they opened on a weekday, only had to wait 10-15 min for it to be ready! There was no long line to place orders, just a few people waiting for their orders to be ready.Unfortunately, they had run out of pepperoni which we were surprised to hear as pepperoni must be one of the most popular toppings. Also they were closed for a private party, so we were unable to enter the restaurant. Thankfully they were still taking orders from the side window.Our classic pie ($33) came out piping hot and was loaded with fresh tomatoes, peppers and thick rounds of sausage. It was delicious and definitely a step above other new york pizza places, but ultimately not the best I've ever had. My hat still goes to Paulie Gee's for that one, a much more inventive pizza place while Di Fara is good for a classic pie. Also, there was way too much oil on the pie and it took a while for my throat to feel clear of all the grease. Still, I'm glad I had the opportunity to try Di Fara and with such a short wait time!",4.0
"On my first trip to Di Fara's, I arrived during a weekday evening to find a group of customers standing around the counter, waiting silently. The staff behind the counter went about their business, also silently. After about 5 minutes of standing unacknowledged at the counter, I felt like I had stumbled into a solemn wake where I didn't know the deceased, and left.More than a year later, on a quest to find the best pizza in Brooklyn, I stopped by during a summer's afternoon to find the place closed. Okay, fair enough, why not take a few weeks off in the summer? A month later, I arrived at 5 pm to find the place open. Well, not really. The sign said they were taking orders for 6 pm. I couldn't wait, and left, but the woman inside said that they had summer hours, and it would change in the fall.A few weeks later (post Labor Day), they were still on the same schedule.Well, the 5th time's the charm, and at 5:30 on a Wednesday, I finally found them open and serving pizza. Sorta. I could describe the bizarre series of actions and interactions that took place over the 5 minutes I waited in line, but I'll just put it this way: I waited 5 minutes and I was the third person in line - and the orders ahead of me were far from complicated, and one had been pre-ordered. Not organized.But the important thing is the pizza, right? Sure, I had to wait, but was it worth it? Are they dispensing the best pie west of Naples?Nuh-uh. Not by a long shot. I got a tiny slice for $5. It was cold, as if it had been sitting on the counter for an hour (every pizza place I've ever been to in New York has the good sense to put it in the oven for at least a minute before serving). And the taste? ""Salty"" pretty much says it all. Given their few opening hours, surly attitude, and mediocre product, I don't see why they don't just hang it up and take the other 11 months of the year off, too. If they don't want to make pizza anymore, that's fine with me. Why people talk about this place as if it were something special is beyond me. Not only could you do better in terms of flavor, price, and service, you literally couldn't do worse at any random pizza parlor in the New York area.",1.0

Of course u have to go to Dominick famous pizza.  One slice u will be in heaven. The slice is very freshly made with fresh tomato sauce cheese in house made and the Basil leaves are cut into pieces right in front of you. It is worth the price because everything is fresh. When u go into the shop it looks very worn out and u have to wait for a while. If u are getting a pie please call ahead of time. You won't be sorry.,5.0

"Went on a rainy Saturday afternoon.  They open at 12, we got there at 11.50am and were first in line [I think this is rare, but since it was rainy, there was less of a crowd].  The doors opened at 1pm.  At this time, there were about 30 people in line behind us.  The people behind us in line were really rude, pushy and obnoxious - but this doesn't reflect on Di Fara's at all.  Di Fara's staff was very nice and super friendly.  I think they messed up our order, but we were so excited about the pizza, we didn't care. There are three tables that each seat 5 people.  But there are extra chairs so technically you can squeeze about 7 to a table ... in general people are very friendly and getting Di Fara's pizza is an adventure/experience. They are BYOB, so you can bring your own wine/beer which is nice.  Just don't forget to bring your own bottle opener  The Pizza - is absolutely amazing.  We got 4 pies, and all were perfect.  They have square and round pies.  I personally like the crust and texture of the rounds better.  But the square was perfectly done as well.  The square had a thicker crispier crust, I've heard since it takes longer to cook, sometimes it's burnt, but ours was cooked perfectly.Classic Round - just cheese, basil and olive oil - sooooo simple yet so delicious.  Garlic and Pepperoni - garlic is to die for! Pepperoni is thick small cuts, Love it! Veggies and Sausage - veggies add a nice touch and the sausage is fantastic Square Sicilian - was much thicker than the rounds - at the time it was my least favorite of the four pizzas we got, but we were also the fullest at this time.  Ate some room temperature left overs a few hours later, and this was my favorite ... Love this place - easily the best pizza i've had in New York thus far - and the three others i was with agreed.  I definitely  would come back and recommend to others, you just have to have the mindset that it's an adventure.  Don't go when you're starving and expect pizza immediately.   Pizza is pricey - our 4 pizza's cost us $130, but I think it's totally worth it!  We also had left overs that reheat well and are still very delicious!

"Came here yesterday on a Saturday afternoon around 2pm, and the place was still elbow-to-elbow, yet not spilling out of the doors.

Domenico DeMarco is in his 80s and has been making pizzas like yours for decades. a shiver may go down your spine when he makes an occasional glance back and looks you in the eye.-don't watch. close your eyes. just smell everything.-hate. get it out of your system: why is everyone being so reverential?! is this pizza really that great!? what is this, like, the Soup Man? good lord Brooklyn is so eye-rollingly full of itself. would it kill anyone to start a line here? could there be MORE cyclists in spandex here?!-love. you need to get any possible hating out of your system because what you are witnessing is truly special. you will repent.-walk. you might go nuts standing around for an hour, which is as long as it might take for your za to be ready. don't worry, there is interesting stuff nearby. Woody Allen's childhood home is like two blocks away on Rugby Ave, and nearby are some interesting Hasidic and Syrian Jewish neighborhoods. You'll be in awe but also realize why about 1.1 million NYC citizens, about one in seven people, are Jewish.-stay where you are. how awful would it be if you missed your order. get back in time to find a possible place to sit or decide if you're taking this stuff to go.-eat. when your pizza is ready, hopefully you will have gotten a seat in the small place. take it to your table and enjoy. I had the square sicilian with pepperoni and sausage. The pan it's baked in is slathered in olive oil, which makes the crust super flavorful. The San Marzano tomatoes for the sauce were nicely sweet and acidic, the buffalo mozzarella cheese from Casapulla was creamy and gooey, freshly grated grana padano blended nicely with the mozzarella, as did the hand-grated Parmigiano Reggiano, the Israeli basil scissored onto the pizza at the end was perfect.-don't eat. let that stuff cool for a solid 4-5 minutes or you'll burn your mouth and ruin the whole experience.

The best quality ingredients mixed with Doms loving care he gives to each pie make this place and all the food from it special. If you haven't tried this Pizza yet you are truly missing out.,5.0

"Di Fara's is an experience.  The pizza wasn't the best I've ever had, but watching the old guy make the pizza was worth the trip and wait. If I were to go again I would go during the week when its less busy, in addition I would also get the square pie - the guy next to me was eating it, and it looked much easier to handle and even more delicious than the regular pie.  Overall I am a fan, but like most people mention, it's not exactly worth the 2 hour wait hence why I would go when it is less busy aka during the week.",3.0
Overrratedddd. Peter pizza or spumoni are a better option.Crust was a little burnt. Dont get me wrong the pizza wasnt terrible but didnt live up to the hype. I ordered the classic pie ($34??) and it just fell flat.Brooklyn is the best place to get pizza but better options than di fara.,3.0

"When planning my recent trip to visit relatives in Brooklyn, this was thee number one pizzeria that was on my list. Yelp bud Dave G's review from February of this year demanded that I make a visit since I was going to be staying several nights with the cuz'z. Dave prepared me for the spartan digs that Di Fara calls home. My cousin even muttered at one point...""you would think they would slap on some paint once every decade or so."" Yep, a little shabby with maybe a dozen chairs around several basic tables all pushed together. The patrons more or less policed themselves by waving down their fellow diners to alert them that they were almost done and ready to give up their seats. It surprisingly went very smooth. A definite organic camaraderie in a place of such high esteem within the world of pizza aficionados. OK, now that you have been prepared for the homely (not homey) ambiance, and have surely noticed the five stars lets get down to why this place is hallowed ground to pizza lovers. Dom puts so much thought and care into his creations that he has perfected over 50 years performing his labor of love. Only the highest quality ingredients are allowed on these masterpieces, and the taste shows. The super fresh bittersweet San Marzano tomatoes are blended into the sauce and one piece (the one I made sure to grab), had a whole tomato plopped on top. Man-oh-man what a treat those bites were. In all my years of eating pizza this was a first. All pizzas are topped off with fresh basil leaves immediately after the pizza is brought out of the oven. And the crust, oh lordy lord, such perfection. So flavorful, and some pieces were more charred than others. I took the one with the most char as my three dining mates didn't seem excited to go for the full char effect. I loved it. A couple of tidbits: place your order through the window and wait within earshot for your name to be called. There isn't a waiting area, unless you call the bus bench and the milk crates that we sat on out front of their next door neighbor's shop a waiting area. No restrooms, we walked to the Walgreens across the street. No alcohol sold, but you are allowed to BYOB, sorry but I didn't inquire if there was a corkage fee. I would guess there isn't one. They do have a cooler with sodas and water however. OK, number one spot on my list crossed off. How will Lombardi's compare? Will get to that review soon.",5.0

"Finally got a chance to head here on a sunday afternoon and they had window service for pickup. Ordered a regular large pie for $28 and it took 40 min. for pickup. For this shop i hear that was pretty quick. Quality ingredients. You can tell it is fresh. Nice pieces of tomatoes, basil, grated Parmesan, and olive oil. The distinct taste though is the crust. Crispy and has a note of a sour dough taste.Go for the fresh red peppers as well to put on top. As other pizza shops use dried red pepper flakes. Using the fresh ones definitely gives it a nice spicey kick.",4.0
"Waited OVER 30 minutes for 2 slices of pizza, which were TOO small and TOO expensive in comparison to other NYC spots. Pizza should've been amazing considering the hassle, but just average.

"First off the pizza is very good but NOT WORTH WAITING 2 HOURS FOR. Keep in mind I came here around 1pm on  Friday and I only waited about 10 minutes to actually place my order. The older gentleman really takes his time with each and every pie to make sure each is given special attention from shredding the mozzarella to cutting fresh basil to drizzling each with olive oil. Also they have a limited amount of ingedients you can get on each pizza, so you know everything they serve is very fresh and done well.With all that said the pizza is too expensive! I could see the price justification if it was in an expensive area or the restaurant itself was high end...but no. It's in midwood brooklyn and looks like it's never been renovated. The pizza is very good but this place gets 3 stars because it's too expensive and when you have to wait over 2 hours for a pie that literally takes 10 minutes to make I think that says a lot about your management.

"I waited two years to come here -- until I was in the neighborhood, the time seemed right and they were open. I was aware of the hype. I think that, overall, the pizza is excellent -- but it's only marginally better than some of the other really, really good places in NYC and the price and the hassle are far, far less at other places. I even got there, and by some miracle, rolled right up to the counter and got two cheese slices in about 30 seconds -- but if I had to wait, I would think it would not be worth it for the price and the madhouse that is the neighborhood -- even though there was not a line for the pizza. The pizza crust is very good -- the first bite was perfect -- that thin-soft thing with the crunch just right as your teeth come together. The ingredients were superior. The outer crust was just okay -- no seasoning and a little too bready. Had the cheese fallen more to the edge and the pizza cooked just a bit more, it probably would have been fine. It is salty, but I like that -- so that didn't bother me at all. I feel those commenters are correct who say the potential hassles, price and size of the slices figure in to the overall review -- the pizza is definitely one of the best -- but the experience could probably be better.",3.0
"I grew up 2 blocks from this pizzeria. It used to be a very relaxed neighborhood hang-out where you could get a good slice any day--even every day! Over the years, every time I saw it on the cover of ""Time Out NY"" I cringed. Not because the pizza is bad (it's good, although it's way fancier now than it was back then--Dom puts on a show) but because, well--""there goes the neighborhood.""  Now it is a tourist destination known to have the best pizza, period. And now the pizza is fancy with 3 types of fresh mozzerela and fresh basil. The basil is a nice improvement, but now it doesn't make sense for anyone in the neighborhood to get pizza here. There are lines, sometimes tour buses. It's crazy.  And a basic slice is $4. If I went by and there was coincidentally no line (say, 11 am) I would say ""what an opportunity!"" and get a slice. But I don't bother anymore.The place makes me feel stupid. There are so many people waiting, and there's no formal line sometimes, they are just standing around waiting for a new pie to come out, and I feel like it's bad form to make eye contact with the staff in case they get the idea that you're impatient instead of lucky to be there. I just don't understand the etiquette and feel out of place.This could be fun for a tourist and/or a group of friends. I have seen back-packers lined up outside waiting for it to open, like they are on a pilgrimage.

But this spot is ruined for people like myself living in Midwood.I miss their old incarnation, but I wish them well. Clearly Dom doesn't need to work anymore but he enjoys it. Can you imagine becoming a pizza-making celebrity rock-star after eons of toiling in a regular family-run business!?! I have seen Dom interviewed and on documentaries and on the news for what he does.If you are looking for a very good basic slice of pizza, there is Smiley's or Smilers Pizza on the corner of 7th Ave and 9th Street in Park slope. It's right on top of the F train. I think it's open 24-hours, or late, at least. When I lived in Park Slope I noticed that kids from Bay Ridge  would travel there as a destination spot.

"It has been however many years since I've been trying to go to Di Fara, but it never worked out - until, at last, on our recent trip, we were able to make our way out there!   Owned by Mr. Domenico DeMarco (also known as 'Dom'), he immigrated to NY from Italy back in '59.  Most of his family members were bakers and master pizziaolos, and when he first arrived to the States, he worked as a farmer; eventually, in '64, he opened Di Fara Pizza.  The menu offers pizza slices (regular, square, with topping, or with specialty topping), pizza pies (regular pie, square pie, or the DiFara Classic Pie (with sausage, peppers, mushrooms, and onions), and calzones.  Toppings selection include: sausage, pepperoni, mushrooms, onions, garlic, black olives, meatballs, anchovies, peppers, artichokes, porcini mushrooms, green olives, baby eggplant, broccoli rabe, prosciutto, sun-dried roasted peppers, sun-dried tomato, and semi-dried cherry tomatoes.  When we arrived (very convenient off, literally right across from the Q), there was already a line, but not too long.  I just put in an order of one Square slice of pepperoni and garlic, requested a 'corner' piece, and waited for about 1.5 hours.  Now, I didn't mind waiting, as I was just so happy that I was finally able to try this place out.  I've noticed that other larger parties ordered either a small or a large square, which I will probably do, as I saw one that was extra well-done, and it literally came out sizzling (had similar toppings as me) - it looked AMAZING.  When I was finally able to try mine, I found it to be pretty tasty!  I wished I requested it to be extra well-done (which I usually do), but I think I got too excited and couldn't think straight T___T  Either way, the dough was nice and crispy, nonetheless, and held the toppings well - the ingredients were quite generous - copious amounts of pepperoni and fresh garlic that you can actually taste, and I loved the chunky tomato sauce that tasted oh-so-fresh!  Loved that!  I also loved the automatic additions of the basil and the olive oil - definitely adds that extra pizazz!  I loved how Mr. Dom was there, assembling the pizza, cutting the fresh basil, drizzling olive oil, checking the temperature, checking the baking progress in the oven, and transferring it onto the tray for the patrons to chow down.  The restaurant itself is small (only seats 19 (and, yes, I counted the number of chairs :P  There are only 3 tables as well, so expect to share space!).  I'd love to come back again, but this time, I would order a whole Square pie, extra well-done, and gobble up them corner pieces :D  Also, don't be shy in asking for chili flakes as well as Parm cheese - the guy who takes the order is very generous in his pourings (also very nice and very efficient!).  I thanked Mr. Dom on my way out, and he gave me such a sweet smile and a wave - HEART HEART HEART.  Definitely check Di Fara out :D+seeing Mr. Dom in action :D  Heart heart heart!+Square pizza - pepperoni and garlic; extra well-done (corner pieces will be fought over!)+automatic addings of basil and olive oil :D+lovely chunky tomato sauce :D+19 seats, 3 tables; sharing will be inevitable+across from Q station",5.0

"I don't think I've ever posted such few stars, but I was honestly disappointed.  As another reviewer mentioned, he doesn't open on time.  I was maybe 12th in line at 11:45 am.  The plan was to get a slice of each the square and the round.  When I got up to the counter somewhere around 12:30, he said there were only rounds and that my slice would take another 15-20 minutes.  When I got the slice there was literally a pool of olive oil in the middle of the slice.  I tried to pour some of it off but every attempt would take the cheese with it so I gave that up.  Overall, it was the saltiest slice of pie I've ever eaten.  With the $2 bottled water and $5 slice, I would've been a lot happier buying a pie from Two Bro's.  Seriously though, if you're sensitive to salt at all...don't waste your time and money.  A pie is $30!

"I don't think I've ever posted such few stars, but I was honestly disappointed.  As another reviewer mentioned, he doesn't open on time.  I was maybe 12th in line at 11:45 am.  The plan was to get a slice of each the square and the round.  When I got up to the counter somewhere around 12:30, he said there were only rounds and that my slice would take another 15-20 minutes.  When I got the slice there was literally a pool of olive oil in the middle of the slice.  I tried to pour some of it off but every attempt would take the cheese with it so I gave that up.  Overall, it was the saltiest slice of pie I've ever eaten.  With the $2 bottled water and $5 slice, I would've been a lot happier buying a pie from Two Bro's.  Seriously though, if you're sensitive to salt at all...don't waste your time and money.  A pie is $30! A calzone? $30! Regular toppings are $1 and specialty are $2.",2.0

The place is a bit small and really vintage looking which is awesome! I came here on a Saturday at 7:30pm and ordered the Regular pie and a square pie. We waited 2 hours to get our pies and it was worth the wait. He makes all the pizza himself and you can clearly see how much he cares about pizza. With each pie he takes his time to make sure it's perfect. What's crazy is when he takes the pie out of the oven he touches it with his hands! I guess he's been doing it for so long his hands don't get burned haha.I liked the square pie a bit more than the regular. I guess it was thicker so you can taste the dough more. It was also nice and crispy while the classic was thin and soft. The regular had more of a cheesier taste and was also really good! One thing to watch out for is to take your time eating the pizza because the sauce is piping hot, since it's fresh out of the oven lol I got the top of my mouth burned a bit.

At the same time, though not burnt to the point where it's inedible or where you can't taste the pizza without tasting the burnt taste, I feel like it got in the way of experiencing the true Di Fara pizza.  The table next to ours had a seemingly perfect pizza as theirs were not dark around the edges. We probably just got unlucky. Given the time and opportunity, I would like to go back and give it another try! [:",4.0

"After a five year absence, I returned to Di Fara with a group of friends wiser and hungrier than the previous time.  This time, I did not arrive at lunch time, I came in the morning, had breakfast at the Dunkin' Donuts down the block and was the first on line!  I told those behind me on line tales of my previous visit and the mastery of Dom DeMarco as he made his pies.  Most importantly, my friends and I had time to strategize who would hold our table and who would order (and what pies we wanted).  By the time the doors opened, we had our plan.  My friends held the table, I went to order and we were the first served.  It was like clockwork and it was glorious!I am happy to report that the pizza now is every bit as good as it was the first time I went.  The crust is crisped to perfection thanks to Dom's generous helping of olive oil as the crust bakes.  The cheeses taste wonderful and the basil offers up a wonderful layer of flavor to every slice.  We tried the round and square pies and loved every bite.  We also tried the ""Classic"" which features toppings including onion, sausage and peppers.  I found out these ingredients were fresh cut for each pie and it tasted great!Watching Dom make a pie is still part of the reason you go.  He makes everything look so easy and yet you know he's putting his all into every pie that goes into his oven.  I confess to feeling a bit like I was watching a bit of foodie history and was a bit in awe as Dom personally sliced up a pie and slid it over to me.

"So there's this thing about being a New Yorker - we are surrounded by decent pies.   Like your neighborhood Vinnie's?  $2.75/slice .  Cheap?  $1 slice from 99 cent fresh or 2 Brothers.  Fancy pants with a history?  Patsy's, Lombardi's, Totonno's.  Sit-down joints with tablecloths/waiter service, standards of the city, $24/pie.  Pizza is like sex - even bad ones should be good.  In this case however, it's sex in a dirty cathouse with celebrity names plastered all over, 2+ hour wait, insufferable crowds, silicone and parlor tricks, all those people ranting and raving about its quality/authenticity seemingly violated some oath of abstinence just to bust a nut here.Don't get it?  For your discernment:Exhibit A: The sign on the door.  ""Sorry for the wait, but it's worth it"".  This is a symbol of business entitlement which tells you they don't have to take your shit, and the lack of courtesy towards their patrons extends to all aspects of their operation.  40 minute subway ride and need to pee?  No restrooms.  Tired?  No seats or a place to lean on.  The real blood boiler is when someone gets half their order and feels entitled to sit there and wait until the other half shows up...between now and 30 minutes from now.  Local joint with the $2.75/slice?   $5/slice (almost double the NYC average for a not-very-big-slice).  The place hasn't been renovated since 1965, and filthy?  ""It's part of the charm"". There is a 2+ hour line out the door, a shitshow order tracking system, and the crowd looks pissed?   ""Don't like it, get out"".  What can you use to justify the price, the decor AND the wait?  You can't clean/fix the place up, install restrooms, and make it takeout only?  If someone tosses out the words ""authentic"", ""traditional"" or that ""timewarp to the past"" cliche to excuse this, I'll show you the interior of Totonno's, and you can go fuck yourself.  They are failing customer respect 101, and you are enabling it.Exhibit B:The people on that line - they look suspiciously out of place in Midwood on a late Saturday afternoon.  They seem to think that it's a badge of honor to be treated like cattle, and to pass it forward, due of some lost-in-translation interpretation of the ""Noo Yorka"" stereotype.  Real New Yorkers are gruff, resilient and streetwise, but we have built-in filters.  We do have to put up with 8 million other people daily, and some of them are certifiably crazy.  Here -  they don't care.  It's almost like they are trying to ""out-Brooklyn"" each other in some attempt to get their pies faster.  Think of it as DiFara's sycophantic auto-immune system.  Exhibit C:The pizza isn't really unique or a major breakthrough to warrant the accolades. Okay, pizzas are simple.  The differentiator between good and great is the quality of the crust.  A great pie is done in an extra hot oven so it'll will cook faster and do less damage to the flavor of the ingredients, and the crust crisp up more - your typical oven can't usually hit those heights.  Here they use a modified oven so it'll crank higher than the usual, but without proper upkeep it'll be inconsistent and burn pies (which happen frequently here).  It's true that Dom hand-toss the dough, cut the fresh basil, and then douse the pie once more in oil...but that's just a slightly burnt pie with basil.  Nothing unique about the sauce, nothing eye opening about the cheese, the crust is obtainable somewhere else.  This ""quality"" is not hard to find, and you won't have to waste a Saturday afternoon waiting for it.  If the cliche is ""Dom still got it"" my response would be ""Yes, just like Lombardi's, except much slower, more anal retentive, with a filthy kitchen and poor customer respect to boot"". If you grew up eating Pizza Hut or Dominos out in Indiana or Arizona, sure, it's like licking the baby jesus.  If you ate local Vinnie's in New Jersey, this place can be a treat.  But if you had stuff from the NYC standards listed above (all just a subway ride away), they all serve comparable pies minus the inflated price ($35/pie?!), the wait, the filth or the inflated sense of entitlement.Someone got the idea that Dom the hardworking barehanded geriatric pizza flipper somehow made this place better than the rest simply because of the old-world-perfectionist narrative, and that because of it, this is the nexus of NYC pizza authenticity.  Well, I am here as a native New Yorker to tell you that no, it's not.  It's just an old tightwad with OCD slinging out the same pie slowly since the 1960s.  It's not a James Beard culinary achievement.  It might be on all the guidebooks, but the return-on-time-investment is extremely poor.  Go there once if you must, but do not make the mistake of a repeat visit.  You waited 3 hours and spent double the usual, and the result isn't justified.  You would have to pull an emperor has no clothes at this point.   Welcome to the pizza world equivalent of the $30 tourist hot dog.",2.0

"I had the best slice of pizza I've ever tried in my life from Di Fara.  I got the Regular slice, and it was simple perfection.  No need for an overload of ingredients, just fresh, quality tomato, cheese, and basil perfectly melded together atop a thin-crust dough hot out of the oven. One tip I highly recommend you try is to get one of the red peppers in oil from the jars on the counter, and put a piece on your plate so that some of the oil drips into your pizza (or you can put it on your pizza, but i thought the entire pepper might overwhelm it with too much spiciness). The oil and small bits of pepper gives your pizza this amazing smoky and slightly spicy flavor that elevates your slice of pizza to a sublime slice of heaven. I think was a key part what made it soo memorably good.I read that the owner of Di Fara has been making pizza for over 40 years, and he is the only one who makes the pizzas here, and that is how he has perfected his craft of pizza making.  I don't know how many times I've said perfect in this review, but...you get the idea. The only reason I didn't give it a complete 5 stars is because the service from the girl was meh.  She wasn't wasn't very welcoming or nice.  But she wasn't mean either.  But I also think that I'm just used to really perky and nice service from people in CA, because I did notice alot of people in NYC generally had a similar type of attitude. So I guess it wasn't too big a deal.  (And don't get me wrong here, I LOVE NYC!! It was just a different style of service that I'm not used to.)Place - inside is very small, it can seat maybe 4-5 people.  I think most people get it to-go.There are many occasions that I miss this place and want to fly back to NY soon just to eat it!",4.0
"I'm super excited to write this review because this spot has been on my radar for a long time..This was easily some of the best pizza I've ever had(I'm from Chicago, so my standards are high). I ordered a whole pie w/ 1/2 sausage 1/2 pepperoni. The pepperoni was amazing, I learned quickly that NY is the pepperoni city..But what really put Di Fara over the top was the Sicilian pie, I ate a few slices on the ride back to Manhattan and was tempted to turn around and get a whole one. When I got here, nobody was in there and I didn't see Dom slanging pies so I was kinda disappointed. But out of nowhere like Spiderman he emerged from the back holding my dough, ready to save the day, and he did!!I only waited a half hour..Mission accomplished.",5.0
"This is very expensive pizza for for which you have to spend at least an hour waiting in a fairly basic pizzeria (really a dive) and if you are not there when they call your name (like say you stepped out for some air or something), then they will totally give your pizza to someone else. There is a chance that some of your crust might be a little burnt (Mr. DiFara is old, busy, and still mostly doing it on his own). Yet despite what a freaking pain in butt it is, this place is *always* busy (even super early on weekdays-we've tried), 'cause the pizza is worth it!I personally think the plain square pie is where it's at. Get a whole pie--a whole pie is the only thing that can make all the pain and suffering worth it. Don't worry about that extra slice, just eat it now 'cause the this is special occasion pizza (did I mention how expensive it is). The only problem is that it spoils you for regular pizza.",5.0
"Di Fara Pizza makes amazing pizza, but bring lots of cash and be ready to wait an hour or two.  Here, plain pizza, means great cheese and sauce, covered with plenty of whole leaves of fresh basil.  Mr. Di Fara insists on making each pizza personally, making sure each one is prepared and cooked to perfection.   The bottom line, getting a Di Fara Pizza is not a quick lunch. It is an afternoon event which you will remember for years.",5.0
"Since my GF and I were too lazy to hit the beach on this otherwise spectacular summer day, we thought that perhaps others weren't going to be as lazy as we were and that the usual wrap around the block line of DiFara's Pizzeria would only extend to the sidewalk. Our gambit paid-off in a big way. Not only was the line a relatively short 45 minutes long, we found parking right outside. I ordered my usual pepperoni and sausage pie. The pies are overall pretty good. On some occasions they are great on other not so much. But this is a very different pie than the typical NYC neighborhood pizzeria. DiFara's make a custom production each and every time. This pizza is handmade from the moment the dough it placed on the counter to the moment is is pulled out of the oven with no tools. You have to see it happen and taste the pizza for yourselves. I think this place is worth the trip although I brought others who didn't think DiFara's was as much of a big deal I think it is.",4.0
"Can you call ahead for takeout?I went here with 2 of my friends who came all the way from NJ to try this pizza. I live just a few blocks away and I never even heard of it.We placed an order for a pie and were told it would be about 40 minutes. After 40 minutes of walking around Avenue J and sitting on the bench outside, I went inside to see how much longer it would be. I was told there were 3 pies ahead of ours. About 20 minutes later, I went back in, waited in line, and asked for an update... still 3 more pies ahead of us. We were starving so we cancelled our pie and took out 5 slices.There is only one other pizza place I've ever eaten at (including pizza spots in Italy) that would compare to Di Fara. Di Fara's pizza is cooked to perfection with an utterly delicious, crispy crust. The owner cooks each pizza himself - no wonder why it takes so long but it's SOOOOO worth it. I can't even deduct ONE star for the wait because it's so delicious and if ANYTHING is worth the wait, this is it!!!Next time, I'm going to try to call first, if they allow it.",5.0

I personally hate the wait and think the pizza is over rated and is too oily! But when I am with friends and they suggest to go here I do not argue because this is a Brooklyn Landmark. The old man is an artist and the pizza pie is his canvas. Someone who has never tried it must try it at least once in their lives but I do not know about multiple trips. You will wait at the bare minimum for 45 minutes in a not so clean place but people say it is worth the wait. But once you take off some of the oil the taste is amazing. Please let me know if anyone else feels the same way about it.,3.0
Amazing Pizza. The original owner makes every single Pizza.  It's great. Worth the price.  You will have  to wait a while for the pizza and the sitting area is small. A must eat in Brooklyn.,5.0
"I will say this... the pizza IS fantastic. I don't know what touch Dom the owner has, but its amazing. And its only really good when he makes it. But the price & size of some of those pizzas is just not worth the wait or the price. Its great to do it once. But after that, me thinks not.",4.0
"I had the best slice of pizza I've ever tried in my life from Di Fara.  I got the Regular slice, and it was simple perfection.  No need for an overload of ingredients, just fresh, quality tomato, cheese, and basil perfectly melded together atop a thin-crust dough hot out of the oven. One tip I highly recommend you try is to get one of the red peppers in oil from the jars on the counter, and put a piece on your plate so that some of the oil drips into your pizza (or you can put it on your pizza, but i thought the entire pepper might overwhelm it with too much spiciness).

"5 stars because the pizza does taste special in some indescribable way. His daughter kindly takes your order so service is great!Got the Classic Di Fara pizza.

I'm no high profile food critic so I can only say this pizza indeed tasted special. Watching him make the pizza and eventually eating it, hits you right in the feels! Like this pizza reflects decades of experience. Pizzeria operates in an interesting way. The place revolved around Di Fara since he's the only one making the pizza. Place your order and, generally, pick it up later. It's based on when he gets around to making it. I came when there was no line at 5pm right when they close briefly for an hour.

Definitely one of the more expensive pies in the city, but I would gladly spend the around 30 dollars to sample Mr. Demarco's pizza every now and then. Limited toppings but you don't really need to add much to an already stellar pie.",5.0

"I love pizza and am usually pretty critical of any pizza I order.  Being from CT,  I am quite familiar with some pretty good pizza from places like Sally's, Pepe's, and Modern in New Haven, the Colony in Stamford and others including Bridgeport ""apizza"", and New Jersey ""tomato pies"" from Atlantic City to Trenton.  I'm not talking about specialty pizza here which is a different genre altogether in my opinion.  Although specialty pizzas are great in their own right when you want to have a personal goat cheese, kalamata olive and fig pizza,... but its not the traditional tomato sauce & mozzarella cheese pies.I heard the hype about Di Fara's pizza and had to try it.  So I drive to Brooklyn and... ,...the first time I eat Di Fara's pizza, it was over the top the best pizza I've ever eaten.  Not kidding!  I've been back several times since then with friends and family.  .Now here is the disclaimer;  1) There is always a wait time to get your pizza and it can be really long depending on which day & time.  2) It is the most expensive pizza pie I have ever bought....not cheap!   3) Unlike many pizza ovens which are usually used at 800º or so, Di Fara keeps his ovens at 1000º so it is really easy to burn the pizza an often one side of your pizza will be a bit burnt. 4) The finishing touch to each pizza is a dose of fine imported olive oil and fresh cut basil - for me, this makes the pizza unique and adds great flavor but other people might consider it a little oily.  (To me, fresh olive oil on bread is always nice but when too much olive oil is cooked into the pizza, as I have experienced at other establishments, it is a different story.  The flavor of olive oil is best when it is not cooked at high temperature which is why at Di Fara's, it is put on after the pizza comes out of the oven.)80+ year old Mr. Di Fara makes every single pizza and the ingredients are always top notch, most imported from Naples Italy.  He has been doing it for over 45 years so I think he deserves some credit.  On a good day, I think it is the best in the country, not just New York.",5.0

This pizza tastes exactly what a mom and pop shop (in this case a pop shop) should taste, delicious. The combination of fresh ingredients was on point and was well balance. The pizza crust was crunchy with just the right amount of give and the center wasn't too oily. You definitely feel better about eating this pizza over your regular pizza joint.

My friends and I ordered a plain pie. I also ate a square while waiting for them. The verdict: best pizza in NYC, hands down. Spoken by a native New Yorker and pizza lover. The regular slice is delicious, but get the square. Just do it, trust me. Regular slice is $5, square is $6. A plain pie is $30. Totally worth the price.",5.0
"Tried the round, and have to say, you CAN taste the difference from other pizza joints. The crust is thin, but non foldable slice thin. The tomato sauce is more of an Italian Sunday gravy. The mozzarella is grated right over the pie. The basil, is fresh cut over the pie just pulled from the oven, it's so nice and tasty.. I'd equate the pizza to having a gourmet making homemade pizza all from scratch, just for you.. Definitely should not be missed by any pizza hound..

"There are experiences, and there are life experiences, and there are life-changing experiences. Technically they're three shades of one happening, and what happened to me here falls squarely within the latter. This is fairly life-changing pizza. It's good. Really damn good. Downright incredible pizza. Some of the best if not best that I've ever had. These folks follow the tried and true method of doing one thing and doing it well. There are only a couple of options here, and you have to know about them to order them. Otherwise you order a pie, or a slice. It's hand-tossed dough, marinara, fresh mozz, and olive oil baked to perfection, then topped with fresh basil, more olive oil and grated parm. It's simple. It's made to order. And it's downright perfect. I guess you can get a square pie with thicker crust. You can get meat added on if you know that's an option. And, well, they do sell some sodas. But it's all about the pizza here, and the same guy has been doing it for ages. The downsides to this concept are immediately apparent. They open when they want to. They move as slow as they damn well please. And they only accept cash (as far as I can tell). Also this joint is way the hell out in Midwood, which is a trek for anyone from anywhere except Midwood. On the upside, the people-watching here is excellent. We made a pilgrimage here and showed up on a Sunday afternoon, to find the gate down but the window open, and a group of people hovering out front. It took maybe 10-15 minutes to make my way to the front of the line, and another few to converse with the dude writing orders on a lined paper pad. The quoted wait for a pie was two hours. Two. HOURS. But since we come from way out west, and made the trek, we waited. It took the full two hours for our pie to arrive, and was it worth the wait? Yes. For many reasons. First, it's delicious. The sauce, the flavors, the fresh basil, the crust... all good. Second, it's delicious. Third, this was my only chance to get it. If I lived in town, would I do it again? Sure, occasionally. But now that the taste of this pie is indelibly imprinted on my brain, I can always sweetly recall the wonders I experienced when consuming this pie while I wait a much, much shorter time somewhere else. But I'd still make it happen. Dom's only going to be slinging pies for so much longer, and I'd want to get as much of this in my belly as possible before he's done. This is serious business folks, and it takes serious dedication to do business here. But if you appreciate good food, it's your line of business.",5.0

It seemed to have been sitting there cold for some time, almost as if it had been prepared a few days before.It was pretty brutal, I have to say. You can go to fifty places in Brooklyn and get something better. Pizza is pizza, anyways.That being said, the place is mad famous and the workers probably do better then any place in the city, so why would the people there care about a random guy coming in mid-week?",2.0
"I finally got a chance to make a trip to Di Fara. I went in the afternoon on a weekday. Luckily, the place was totally empty, but I was told by another customer that this was a rare occurrence. My friends and I ordered a plain pie. I also ate a square while waiting for them. The verdict: best pizza in NYC, hands down. Spoken by a native New Yorker and pizza lover. The regular slice is delicious, but get the square. Just do it, trust me. Regular slice is $5, square is $6. A plain pie is $30. Totally worth the price.",5.0
"Tried the round, and have to say, you CAN taste the difference from other pizza joints. The crust is thin, but non foldable slice thin. The tomato sauce is more of an Italian Sunday gravy. The mozzarella is grated right over the pie. The basil, is fresh cut over the pie just pulled from the oven, it's so nice and tasty.. I'd equate the pizza to having a gourmet making homemade pizza all from scratch, just for you.. Definitely should not be missed by any pizza hound.. Yes, you can knock it about the wait, price, limited seating, ect, but it's all about the pizza IMHO.. Will be back!",5.0
"There are experiences, and there are life experiences, and there are life-changing experiences. Technically they're three shades of one happening, and what happened to me here falls squarely within the latter. This is fairly life-changing pizza. It's good. Really damn good. Downright incredible pizza. Some of the best if not best that I've ever had. These folks follow the tried and true method of doing one thing and doing it well. There are only a couple of options here, and you have to know about them to order them. Otherwise you order a pie, or a slice. It's hand-tossed dough, marinara, fresh mozz, and olive oil baked to perfection, then topped with fresh basil, more olive oil and grated parm. It's simple. It's made to order. And it's downright perfect. I guess you can get a square pie with thicker crust. You can get meat added on if you know that's an option. And, well, they do sell some sodas. But it's all about the pizza here, and the same guy has been doing it for ages. The downsides to this concept are immediately apparent. They open when they want to. They move as slow as they damn well please. And they only accept cash (as far as I can tell). Also this joint is way the hell out in Midwood, which is a trek for anyone from anywhere except Midwood. On the upside, the people-watching here is excellent. We made a pilgrimage here and showed up on a Sunday afternoon, to find the gate down but the window open, and a group of people hovering out front. It took maybe 10-15 minutes to make my way to the front of the line, and another few to converse with the dude writing orders on a lined paper pad. The quoted wait for a pie was two hours. Two. HOURS. But since we come from way out west, and made the trek, we waited. It took the full two hours for our pie to arrive, and was it worth the wait? Yes. For many reasons. First, it's delicious. The sauce, the flavors, the fresh basil, the crust... all good. Second, it's delicious. Third, this was my only chance to get it. If I lived in town, would I do it again? Sure, occasionally. But now that the taste of this pie is indelibly imprinted on my brain, I can always sweetly recall the wonders I experienced when consuming this pie while I wait a much, much shorter time somewhere else. But I'd still make it happen. Dom's only going to be slinging pies for so much longer, and I'd want to get as much of this in my belly as possible before he's done. This is serious business folks, and it takes serious dedication to do business here. But if you appreciate good food, it's your line of business.",5.0

"What compels a man write his first review ever? This: my experience today at Di Fara pizzeria was so underwhelming relative to my expectations that I nearly had an aneurism.

"A few years ago when I came to NY to find the best pizza, I went to Lombardi's and Grimaldi's.  I got quite a few yelp comments saying ""Hey what about Di Fara's?""  It seems it's a 3 team race for best NY pizza on many message boards, so I knew the next time I got back to NY, a pilgrimage to this Brooklyn pizza spot was in order.  What I didn't know was that the word pilgrimage is exactly what it would feel like.Dom DeMarco has been hand making each pizza here since he opened in 1965.  Nobody but him makes the pizza.  Sure some help with prep, but the actual making of the pizza will be done only by him.  I'm guessing he's about 80 years old and watching him slowly work his craft, spreading of the dough until he has just the right shape, the slow circular motion of spreading on the sauce, and then the same motion for the olive oil - the singleminded attention to detail on his face as he goes through these perfect motions, it was like watching a Zen - Buddhist Master raking a Japanese Rock Garden.  There was a serenity to his work that seemed to spread throughout the small pizzeria.  No music playing, no TV blaring, in fact everyone seemed to just sit quietly and wait for their pizza.  Anything more than a whisper seemed out of place, like this place should be treated as holy ground.  Shhh the master is making your pizza, you wouldn't interrupt Mozart composing, or Da Vinci painting, and in this building, Domenico DeMarco commands such reverence.  yelp.com/biz_photos/di-f…We were told by his assistant that it would take an hour or so to make the pie.  I came over 3,000 miles for this pie, another hour would be just fine.  We ordered pepperoni, sausage, and onions.  My initials of DG was written down on a little yellow pad and we waited.  Dom was only given one order at a time.  Only when he was done with the specific pie, would he request the next.  Regardless of how busy Di Fara's gets, this system keeps a calm working environment in which greatness can be achieved.  Surprisingly the hour went quickly and the moment of truth arrived.The pizza is more of a traditional NY pie here, very charred crust from an extremely hot oven.  Cooking time is quick, prep time is where all the love is.  That and the amazing ingredients.  San Marzano tomato sauce provided a slightly sweet sauce, which balanced nicely with the oregano.  The cheese made this pizza much different from Lombardi's and Grimaldi's where they choose to use slices of fresh mozzarella.  At Di Fara's, Dom DeMarco has gone with a blend of 3 different types of Mozzarella, as well as a salty Grana Padano and Parmesan Romano.  This gives his pizza a bold flavor.  The crust is perfectly crunchy and charred just right.  Top notch pepperoni and slices of sausage were delicious.  Extra Olive Oil is poured on the pie, which also adds some richness that separates it from others.  Fresh basil is cut just before being served, which always provides a wonderful aromatic experience as you are biting into your pizza.  yelp.com/biz_photos/di-f…There's only one size here.  And that is the right thing to do. The pizza must be allowed to breath, when you have too small of a pie, the crust chokes off the topping area.  Cut into 8, me and my friend had no problem finishing off our 4 slices each.  I even managed to try a square Sicilian slice, just to say I did.  I found that one a little too blackened on the bottom for my taste, as the olive oil just fried the pizza dough in the hot oven.  However my friend loved it.  First time here - go with the traditional round pie.  yelp.com/biz_photos/di-f…If Lombardi's Pizza is number 1, then Di Fara's is 1A.  It's very hard to pick one over the other, even though they are very different in taste.  I'm so glad I got to experience Di Fara's, it's truly a foodie destination.  Don't expect much in terms of how the place looks though, all the love is put into the pie.  There's only perhaps about 10-12 seats and they're pretty run down.  But I found that part of the charm.  (Closed on Monday and Tuesday so plan accordingly)",5.0
"The pizza here is delicious and you can taste the freshness in each bite.  We bought 3 squares with different toppings for 2 of us but I think the next time we come around, we should just get a whole pie.  Each square is $6 plain but if you add toppings, you could be adding $1 - $2 more to each slice.  After our 3 squares, we bought another 1 slice because we just couldn't get enough! Mmmm...fresh olive oil, basil, tomato sauce and Parmesan cheese.  Surprisingly there was not much of a line when we got there one Friday afternoon but understand that they make this pizza fresh.  It could take like another 45 minutes to an hour just to get your food.  Slices are speedier to come out than squares.  An full plain pies might sometimes be faster than single slices.  Things to think about...I'm originally from Chicago so I'm a deep dish pizza kind of girl but even with that said, I would say this has got to be one of the best pizzas, maybe not the best, but one of the best...",5.0
Meh. If you come here with no expectations it's really an experience more then the actual pizza it self. Take time out of your day to come.

"Yup. That was worth a 45m wait for a couple slices. Both the regular cheese (the basil makes it) and the square pepperoni were great.

"Okay, so... I read several reviews about this place before I decided to make the trip over here. When I was a teenager, I do remember hanging out in this neighborhood because my best friend used to live over here. However, I don't remember eating at the pizzeria back then. Anyway, my daughter and I went there on a Friday at around 6 o'clock. We waited for about 30 minutes on line outside before we got inside and were actually able to place an order. The young lady wrote our order on a yellow pad and we stepped over to the side and waited. And waited. And waited. And waited...While we were here, we witnessed the older gentleman who owns the place making the pizzas. Actually, he was the only one who was making the pizza. This has a lot to do with why it takes so long to actually get your food. A lot of people have complained about this place being dirty, and the service being nasty. I don't think that this is true. I think that people are confusing an older building with uncleanliness. The restaurant was not dirty. It's just that, when a building is so old no matter what you do it will still look a certain way. The people behind the counter were not OVERLY friendly, but they were definitely not rude by any means.Look, if you want some really delicious pizza and you're not averse to spending a good amount of time waiting for it, then this is definitely the place for you. When we finally got our pizza it was great! You can tell that there is a difference between the ingredients that they use and the ingredients that other places use. The crust was crunchy and flavorful, you can taste the freshness of the olive oil. The cheese was off the hook! Even the Parmesan cheese tasted different to what I am normally used to. The basil was exceptionally fragrant and very fresh.Overall, it was really delicious and I do see what everyone is raving about. Honestly, if you do decide to visit this place unless you are one of the first people on line, I would definitely recommend having a little snack or something beforehand. I think there's a good chance that the negative reviews about this place stem from people having to wait so long for the food.Anyway, if you do decide to come here make sure you pay attention to the times that they open. They have two shifts. One of them is early afternoon, the other one is later on. If you are one of the first people there, the wait will not be as long. Again, it was definitely worth our time. I will be back for sure.I'll just make sure I'm the first person on line ;-)",4.0
"So after hearing much hype about Di Fara, I finally decided to stop by this place since it's not too far from where I live and there aren't any good pizzerias in my neighborhood. i was disappointed :-( Being born and bred in NYC, and somewhat of a pizza connoisseur, I know what constitutes good pizza and this ain't it. I think many of the 4 and 5 star reviews here on Yelp must be from out-of-towners who don't know any better because there is no way this pizza should have the reputation it has. This pizza is not great, nothing spectacular, just okay at best. Then, there's the prices :o| OH MY GOD, those prices!!! We paid 30 bucks for a friggin pie! Unheard of!

The neighborhood that pizzeria is in and the size of the establishment tells me that the owners are making a KILLING in profits.

"People make Di Fara out like it's the holy grail of pizza--maybe I just showed up on an off day?  Don't get me wrong, the pizza was *good*, but it didn't feel like it was worth the VERY long wait, or high prices.  The seating area is pretty dirty, and the pizza tastes a little burnt.  No, not brick oven crispy, just burnt.  The sauce is flavorful, and who doesn't love cheese, but it's ultimately uninspiring.  I think people think it's great because they're so hungry after staring at other people's pizzas that by the time their name is called for their food that anything would taste delicious. It's okay, and at $15 less a pie, and 1 hour less of a wait, it would be good, but it sure ain't great.",2.0
It's everything people say it is. One of the best pizzas you'll ever have.,5.0
"A few years ago when I came to NY to find the best pizza, I went to Lombardi's and Grimaldi's.  I got quite a few yelp comments saying ""Hey what about Di Fara's?""  It seems it's a 3 team race for best NY pizza on many message boards, so I knew the next time I got back to NY, a pilgrimage to this Brooklyn pizza spot was in order.  What I didn't know was that the word pilgrimage is exactly what it would feel like.Dom DeMarco has been hand making each pizza here since he opened in 1965.  Nobody but him makes the pizza.  Sure some help with prep, but the actual making of the pizza will be done only by him.  I'm guessing he's about 80 years old and watching him slowly work his craft, spreading of the dough until he has just the right shape, the slow circular motion of spreading on the sauce, and then the same motion for the olive oil - the singleminded attention to detail on his face as he goes through these perfect motions, it was like watching a Zen - Buddhist Master raking a Japanese Rock Garden.  There was a serenity to his work that seemed to spread throughout the small pizzeria.  No music playing, no TV blaring, in fact everyone seemed to just sit quietly and wait for their pizza.  Anything more than a whisper seemed out of place, like this place should be treated as holy ground.  Shhh the master is making your pizza, you wouldn't interrupt Mozart composing, or Da Vinci painting, and in this building, Domenico DeMarco commands such reverence.  yelp.com/biz_photos/di-f…We were told by his assistant that it would take an hour or so to make the pie.  I came over 3,000 miles for this pie, another hour would be just fine.  We ordered pepperoni, sausage, and onions.  My initials of DG was written down on a little yellow pad and we waited.  Dom was only given one order at a time.  Only when he was done with the specific pie, would he request the next.  Regardless of how busy Di Fara's gets, this system keeps a calm working environment in which greatness can be achieved.  Surprisingly the hour went quickly and the moment of truth arrived.The pizza is more of a traditional NY pie here, very charred crust from an extremely hot oven.  Cooking time is quick, prep time is where all the love is.  That and the amazing ingredients.  San Marzano tomato sauce provided a slightly sweet sauce, which balanced nicely with the oregano.  The cheese made this pizza much different from Lombardi's and Grimaldi's where they choose to use slices of fresh mozzarella.  At Di Fara's, Dom DeMarco has gone with a blend of 3 different types of Mozzarella, as well as a salty Grana Padano and Parmesan Romano.  This gives his pizza a bold flavor.  The crust is perfectly crunchy and charred just right.  Top notch pepperoni and slices of sausage were delicious.  Extra Olive Oil is poured on the pie, which also adds some richness that separates it from others.  Fresh basil is cut just before being served, which always provides a wonderful aromatic experience as you are biting into your pizza.  yelp.com/biz_photos/di-f…There's only one size here.  And that is the right thing to do. The pizza must be allowed to breath, when you have too small of a pie, the crust chokes off the topping area.  Cut into 8, me and my friend had no problem finishing off our 4 slices each.  I even managed to try a square Sicilian slice, just to say I did.  I found that one a little too blackened on the bottom for my taste, as the olive oil just fried the pizza dough in the hot oven.  However my friend loved it.  First time here - go with the traditional round pie.  yelp.com/biz_photos/di-f…If Lombardi's Pizza is number 1, then Di Fara's is 1A.  It's very hard to pick one over the other, even though they are very different in taste.  I'm so glad I got to experience Di Fara's, it's truly a foodie destination.  Don't expect much in terms of how the place looks though, all the love is put into the pie.  There's only perhaps about 10-12 seats and they're pretty run down.  But I found that part of the charm.  (Closed on Monday and Tuesday so plan accordingly)",5.0
"The pizza here is delicious and you can taste the freshness in each bite.  We bought 3 squares with different toppings for 2 of us but I think the next time we come around, we should just get a whole pie.  Each square is $6 plain but if you add toppings, you could be adding $1 - $2 more to each slice.  After our 3 squares, we bought another 1 slice because we just couldn't get enough! Mmmm...fresh olive oil, basil, tomato sauce and Parmesan cheese.  Surprisingly there was not much of a line when we got there one Friday afternoon but understand that they make this pizza fresh.  It could take like another 45 minutes to an hour just to get your food.  Slices are speedier to come out than squares.  An full plain pies might sometimes be faster than single slices.  Things to think about...I'm originally from Chicago so I'm a deep dish pizza kind of girl but even with that said, I would say this has got to be one of the best pizzas, maybe not the best, but one of the best...",5.0
Meh. If you come here with no expectations it's really an experience more then the actual pizza it self. Take time out of your day to come. Enjoy the essence of the old school feel of the place but please don't expect this to be the best pizza you've ever had. It's good but the whole experience is what it's about!,4.0
"Yup. That was worth a 45m wait for a couple slices. Both the regular cheese (the basil makes it) and the square pepperoni were great. But I kinda think the square was better, and the main man doesn't seem to make those. Just saying. Pro-tip: just as for whatever slices are available first if you want to shorten that wait.",5.0
"I repeat think for yourself, does anyone know how to do that anymore? I gave it a low rating to counter all the hype. There is too much good pizza in Brooklyn for this to be getting all the attention that it is. The shallow population that is Williamsburg, is slowly ruining everything around them, and they just follow vapid music blogs, and trends. Trends trends follow the trends, follow what the blogs are telling you what iTunes is pushing you. Do what the screen says. The pizza is ABOVE AVERAGE people not worth the HYPE.",1.0
"Fuggedaboudit.This is top notch, delicious, quality ingredients, a classic setting.The only bad part is you've gotta wait.This is one of the only spots I would wait on line for, because it's a damn legend and the pizza is complex and delicious.  The oil is olive oil, not grease, and combined with the grated cheese and other ingredients it is a true Brooklyn treat.  An artist. Best pizza in NYC, though I'm a huge fan of uptown Patsy's, Totonno's and L&B.",5.0
"Okay, so... I read several reviews about this place before I decided to make the trip over here. When I was a teenager, I do remember hanging out in this neighborhood because my best friend used to live over here. However, I don't remember eating at the pizzeria back then. Anyway, my daughter and I went there on a Friday at around 6 o'clock. We waited for about 30 minutes on line outside before we got inside and were actually able to place an order. The young lady wrote our order on a yellow pad and we stepped over to the side and waited. And waited. And waited. And waited...While we were here, we witnessed the older gentleman who owns the place making the pizzas. Actually, he was the only one who was making the pizza. This has a lot to do with why it takes so long to actually get your food. A lot of people have complained about this place being dirty, and the service being nasty. I don't think that this is true. I think that people are confusing an older building with uncleanliness. The restaurant was not dirty. It's just that, when a building is so old no matter what you do it will still look a certain way. The people behind the counter were not OVERLY friendly, but they were definitely not rude by any means.Look, if you want some really delicious pizza and you're not averse to spending a good amount of time waiting for it, then this is definitely the place for you. When we finally got our pizza it was great! You can tell that there is a difference between the ingredients that they use and the ingredients that other places use. The crust was crunchy and flavorful, you can taste the freshness of the olive oil. The cheese was off the hook! Even the Parmesan cheese tasted different to what I am normally used to. The basil was exceptionally fragrant and very fresh.Overall, it was really delicious and I do see what everyone is raving about. Honestly, if you do decide to visit this place unless you are one of the first people on line, I would definitely recommend having a little snack or something beforehand. I think there's a good chance that the negative reviews about this place stem from people having to wait so long for the food.Anyway, if you do decide to come here make sure you pay attention to the times that they open. They have two shifts. One of them is early afternoon, the other one is later on. If you are one of the first people there, the wait will not be as long. Again, it was definitely worth our time. I will be back for sure.I'll just make sure I'm the first person on line ;-)",4.0
"So after hearing much hype about Di Fara, I finally decided to stop by this place since it's not too far from where I live and there aren't any good pizzerias in my neighborhood. i was disappointed :-( Being born and bred in NYC, and somewhat of a pizza connoisseur, I know what constitutes good pizza and this ain't it. I think many of the 4 and 5 star reviews here on Yelp must be from out-of-towners who don't know any better because there is no way this pizza should have the reputation it has. This pizza is not great, nothing spectacular, just okay at best. Then, there's the prices :o| OH MY GOD, those prices!!! We paid 30 bucks for a friggin pie! Unheard of! And again, this is coming from a native NYer where I'm accustomed to everything being expensive, but this is just freakin' ridiculous!

"Sometimes the simple things in life are what really make an impact. Good food made with love and a sense of pride shared with appreciative mouths. That's the DiFara experience in a nut shell. The originator himself stoops over his dough and sauce, methodically (albeit slowly) moving back and forth to put pies in the oven or cut sprigs of basil from his plants by the window. He is so focused, he's developed a permanent hump in his back from the thousands of pizza's he has likely created since he started fiddling with dough back in his early twenties. That's a lot of pizza. So, how can you doubt the stuff wouldn't be magical??!!In keeping with that theme of simple, just sauce and cheese with some raw garlic on top and I'm a happy little Mediterranean girl.",5.0

"I was really excited about trying Di Fara for the first time yesterday. I should have done more research but I quickly realized this was going to be a multiple hour affair. We decided it was worth the wait for this famous pizza and it was a lovely day to walk around and kill time. We got there 20 minutes after they opened and there was already a short line. They take orders as they come in and make them one by one. We were told our pizza would already take about 1.5-2 hrs to be ready. We decided to tuck in and explore the neighborhood in the meantime, which is primarily Jewish and has some beautiful old houses on the side streets surrounding the high street. Our pizza was ready after about 2 hours. There is no room to sit in Di Fara really, just a few tables that people waiting stake out for hours. We ordered a sausage and pepperoni regular pie. I was disappointed by the size of the pizza for over $30. That is a lot of money for a few slices of pizza. We took it to a building nearby that had concrete slabs to eat outside since there is no seating or parks really anywhere nearby. The pizza was definitely one of the most savory I've ever had, it's bursting with salt and olive oil and fresh tomato flavors. The crust is thin and very tasty as well. I felt that the olive oil and basil on top gave good taste but it really trumped the taste of the whole pizza- I didn't think the cheese stood out or the sauce. The meat was good, nothing special, but very good as well.

"It pains me to write this, but the experience we had a Di Fara yesterday was so poor. Got in line at 1130a for a noon opening. At noon, advised there was a private party, will take orders, come back in an hour. We were 6th in line at that time. Came back at one, and had to go to the sweet shop around the corner as private party still going on. Watched a single pizza at a time get walked down the street to the sweet shop. Watched a lot of people that had been in line behind us get their pizza. Told 3 times that it's in the oven. Told one time it must be the toppings we ordered- we ordered a cheese round pie with pepperoni on half. Told one time it got burnt and needed to be remade. Finally got it at 210p and it was barely cooked and no basil. Was advised by staff there to ""go see them"" pointing up the street. No one on window of shop and couldn't get in the door. I could have gotten a better pizza from 100 or more shops in NYC in a 10th of the time for half that price. Shame on you Di Fara, I guess the age of Dom touching every pizza is over.",1.0
"Their pizza is on par with Lombardi's, Gromaldi's, Frank Pepe, DeLorenzo's, etc.  Is it better?  Not in my opinion, but the wait is much, much longer (not including the subway ride).  The pizza itself is typical thin crust served with high quality sauce, freshly grated mozzarella, and basil (and solid toppings). The square slice is slightly thicker but it uses the same flour.  This makes it come out hotter and crispier.  Personally, I think a Sicilian slice should use flour more reminiscent of cake flour a la Umberto's in Boston but that's a personal preference. Overall not bad but I don't plan to make the pilgrimage again.",4.0

U get what comes out!!! There are so many good pizza in ny. Don't waste a whole day there like we did. Not worth it trust me it's just a fad!! Tourist trap! Even the hipsters that were there were mad!!! Stay away from this trap. And on top of it a 6 piece pizza is 30$ whaaattttttt FORGET ABOUT IT!!!  FYI they keep saying do you want me to rush and 80-year-old to make the pizza?  Well what's going to happen when he's not able to make pizza anymore is the place going to close done or does someone else carry on the tradition I am sure somebody else is making pizza there. Also, as we will be meeting the guy in front of us we just finished his pizza half burnt may I say said he used to be so much better like 10 years ago he will not be back.",1.0

"I went based on the all the GREAT reviews.  It took over two hours.  There is one old guy that does everything.  I must say I was impressed that he took the pizza's out of the oven with his bare hands.  He was SUPER slow and it was SUPER crowded.  For that reason alone I would never go back.  After all that hype and wait, I couldn't wait to eat.  It was mediocre pizza at best.  I have had better.  I was soooooo disappointed.  It was edible but truly was not as good as everyone raved about.  I really wanted to like it since this place is like 5 minutes from my house but I would never go back.  It wasn't worth it.",1.0
"Sometimes the simple things in life are what really make an impact. Good food made with love and a sense of pride shared with appreciative mouths. That's the DiFara experience in a nut shell. The originator himself stoops over his dough and sauce, methodically (albeit slowly) moving back and forth to put pies in the oven or cut sprigs of basil from his plants by the window. He is so focused, he's developed a permanent hump in his back from the thousands of pizza's he has likely created since he started fiddling with dough back in his early twenties. That's a lot of pizza. So, how can you doubt the stuff wouldn't be magical??!!In keeping with that theme of simple, just sauce and cheese with some raw garlic on top and I'm a happy little Mediterranean girl.",5.0

"I was really excited about trying Di Fara for the first time yesterday. I should have done more research but I quickly realized this was going to be a multiple hour affair. We decided it was worth the wait for this famous pizza and it was a lovely day to walk around and kill time. We got there 20 minutes after they opened and there was already a short line. They take orders as they come in and make them one by one. We were told our pizza would already take about 1.5-2 hrs to be ready. We decided to tuck in and explore the neighborhood in the meantime, which is primarily Jewish and has some beautiful old houses on the side streets surrounding the high street. Our pizza was ready after about 2 hours. There is no room to sit in Di Fara really, just a few tables that people waiting stake out for hours. We ordered a sausage and pepperoni regular pie. I was disappointed by the size of the pizza for over $30. That is a lot of money for a few slices of pizza. We took it to a building nearby that had concrete slabs to eat outside since there is no seating or parks really anywhere nearby. The pizza was definitely one of the most savory I've ever had, it's bursting with salt and olive oil and fresh tomato flavors. The crust is thin and very tasty as well. I felt that the olive oil and basil on top gave good taste but it really trumped the taste of the whole pizza- I didn't think the cheese stood out or the sauce. The meat was good, nothing special, but very good as well. Overall, for the hassle, the price, and having to figure out what to do around there for multiple hours, I wouldn't head back there anytime soon.

"I recently realized that I live pretty close to this place so the beau and I went over to see if all the hype and press (who does this man's PR?) would hold up.We got there right before the shop opened and there was a line of tourists and locals about 30 people deep.

The pizza here is irresistible. They use fresh ingredients and made from scratch hence the long wait. The only concern is when they leave the pie in the oven so long the bottom comes out burnt. For the price I pay I want to be able to enjoy the pizza and not scrape off burnt side.,3.0
"I am a sucker for NYC history and I have a special place in my heart for the elderly. I also, really appreciate the fact that Domenico DeMarco, who at almost 80, makes every single pie from scratch. EVERY SINGLE PIE! He cranks out anywhere between 100-150 pies a day. In the front window, you can see basil, chiles and other herbs they grow in house. With that said, I think $5 a slice/square is insane. I appreciate that the pies are made by a pizza master but pizza is cheap. Also, the wait is absurd. A regular was an hour and a square was an hour and a half. The line of people in front was kinda weird waiting for just pizza. I guess I am used to pizza being a quick in and out thing, especially in New York. I guess waiting for a Cronut wouldn't be so bad...The food:Square- The square was nice. The bottom had a nice thick crunchy bottom. The sauce was nice but I was expecting a very pronounced sauce. The cheese and basil were nice as well. But an hour and half wait for a $5 squares is not worth it. yelp.com/user_local_phot…Regular- It's weird when I saw the regular in front of me, I already knew I was going to be disappointed.

"Pizza snobs and people born in Brooklyn need to calm down, this place is really not so great.I went once a year ago and was thoroughly unimpressed. After constantly hearing about how this is one of the greatest slices ever, I knew I had to try it. Since I always hear about extremely long wait times here, I was ecstatic when I stopped by late on a Sunday night and was able to get a slice almost immediately.I think it must've been that they had a few slices left over from an old pie, because they gave us a few lukewarm square slices that were surprisingly ordinary. The slices were soaked in WAY too much oil, so the cheese was all completely sliding off into a big sloppy pool of oil, alongside some soggy crust. And I paid $5 for that slice.Strike 1.Over the past year, I've endured seeing this place featured on several more lists of not only the best pizza in NY, but the entire country. Bewildered, I figured I must be missing something, so I went to try it again, this time going for a regular slice (also a ridiculous $5 each).I arrived late on Saturday after the lunch rush (3 PM) hoping it would be an off time, only to find the place completely packed. I wrestled my way to the front around the several people waiting for pies, and was surprised to hear that it would only be 30 minutes for 2 slices (which is way too long but not too bad for this precious place). Luckily we were driving so I occupied myself with Strutting and gettin some out of the way tiles while waiting (check out strutapp.com).Anxious not to miss the pie, we got there promptly, only to enjoy waiting an additional 45 minutes. So in total, about an hour and 15 minutes. For two slices of pizza. For $5 each.Yeah, the pizza is pretty good. The crust is thin and super crispy. I don't get why he needs to put on that extra oil though, as it just gets to be way too much pooling up in there. Also, there is a good inch and a half of pure crust at the top, which no cheese or sauce or anything. There are just a few tables in the overcrowded little spot, too, so you most likely have to eat your slice on the go. Also, it's really oily, so get plenty of napkins.I would say this is a place you maybe come once just so you can tell pizza snobs they're wrong and it's not so good. I would just drive a little further south to Totonno's in Coney Island if you want some very hyped pizza that's actually worth it.Strike 2. And I think 3, too. I'm done here.",2.0

"This is the best pizza that I have ever had in my life.  The line is usually out the door, but the pizza is well worth the 1-2 hour wait.  I've been there about 4 or 5 times now and it really is excellent.  I recommend the square pie.  I've gotten it with pepperoni, garlic and mushrooms and it is great.  You should eat it in the restaurant, because it is really good fresh.  There isn't a lot of seating available, so you should stake out your claim.  The texture of the bread is crunchy and delicious, but I think the real gem is the savory sauce and cheese.  It's a wonderful combination in your mouth.  If you take some home, make sure to line your pizza container with wax paper, or the grease will seep through.  It's a bit expensive at around $40/pie, but you can buy $5 slices as well.  It's well-worth the cost.",5.0

"Since I was to be in the area this past weekend anyway, I was randomly yelping good lunch spots to try and happened to come across Di Fara Pizza. Little did I know it was supposedly one of the ""best slices of pizza"" in New York! I was excited to check it out but almost knew nothing about it before going.I was a little surprised about the chaos that was inside. There's no real organization or queue to order. The ""cashier"" system is a yellow notepad with what looks like gibberish scribbled on it. I quickly noticed that people were in general just ordering pies as they were being made one pie at a time and the wait was more often than not 45 min - 1 hr. My friend and I just wanted 3 slices and surprisingly the slices were only 10-15 min wait each.As others have mentioned, you can 100% taste the quality of cheese, sauce, herbs, etc etc on this pizza. I often say that I like pizza but it's hard for me to tell great pizza from good pizza and this.. I could tell was great pizza!! The tomato sauce was chunky and had pieces of tomato in it and the cheese was just the perfect amount of saltiness. The fresh cut basil on top really added a good touch.It wasn't until after I did some more research on Di Fara Pizza was when I learned who that hardworker older man in the background making each and every pie was. True props for Dom DeMarco for doing what he loves and doing it great!! All that being said. 5$ for a cheese slice (it wasn't large either..) is a bit pricey. I wouldn't travel ~45 min again just to come for the pizza and wait another 45 min which is why I am giving it 4 stars. But this is definitely the best pizza I've had in NYC to date!! If I lived in the area I'd get a pie a week!!",4.0
"Fell a little short of my expectations due to the price. Pizza was ok; nothing spectacular for $34 a pie. We ordered two pies and spent around $80!

"The pizza would be excellent if there weren't so many things working against them:1) The restaurant has been closed multiple times by the health department, and you can tell by looking at it why.  The man makes money from the adoring throngs who wait for pizza, although it's true, not as much as he would if he baked more than one pie at a time (not sure if that's right or just how it feels).  Anyway, he's not broke, and I believe they should be able to at least make it LOOK like rats don't have the run of the place as soon as he closes the door behind the last customer.  I've been here multiple times and have lived around here for 23 years, so I'm not just being a tourist icked-out by the place.  2) The adoring throngs.  Yes, most people are nice, that's true, but over the years this place has become more about the ""experience"" of waiting and the hipster cool factor than about serving customers.  One of my closest friends grew up just around the corner from DiFara and used to get pizza there all the time as a young person.  Dom knows her from the neighborhood.  She's polite, patient, and sweet.  But she's said the wait has become interminable as it's become a complete tourist destination, and the last time she was there, after waiting on line like everyone else for more than two hours, he gave her pie away to some well-dressed tourist that was standing beside her.  She objected and complained, but he brushed her off and gave her a rude answer.  So she's never gone back.  3) The pizza is not touched by Jesus.  It's really good, but it's not *that* much better than other places like Totonno's in Coney Island, or even Grimaldi's if you get a good one.  Once you get to that level and that style of pizza, unless you're a well trained connoisseur, you're probably not going to notice much difference at all EXCEPT THAT YOU WAITED THREE HOURS (evening), standing up, in a locked restaurant (because they lock the doors early to prevent MORE customers from coming in), and the old man pulled your pie out of the oven bare-handed.   Okay, and he hand-clipped basil. Blah blah blah. It's a cult.  It's very good pizza, but it's a cult, and it's a long wait among hipsters and tourists, and it's just not worth it.",2.0
The pizza here is irresistible. They use fresh ingredients and made from scratch hence the long wait. The only concern is when they leave the pie in the oven so long the bottom comes out burnt. For the price I pay I want to be able to enjoy the pizza and not scrape off burnt side.,3.0
"I am a sucker for NYC history and I have a special place in my heart for the elderly. I also, really appreciate the fact that Domenico DeMarco, who at almost 80, makes every single pie from scratch. EVERY SINGLE PIE! He cranks out anywhere between 100-150 pies a day. In the front window, you can see basil, chiles and other herbs they grow in house. With that said, I think $5 a slice/square is insane. I appreciate that the pies are made by a pizza master but pizza is cheap. Also, the wait is absurd. A regular was an hour and a square was an hour and a half. The line of people in front was kinda weird waiting for just pizza. I guess I am used to pizza being a quick in and out thing, especially in New York. I guess waiting for a Cronut wouldn't be so bad...The food:Square- The square was nice. The bottom had a nice thick crunchy bottom. The sauce was nice but I was expecting a very pronounced sauce. The cheese and basil were nice as well. But an hour and half wait for a $5 squares is not worth it. yelp.com/user_local_phot…Regular- It's weird when I saw the regular in front of me, I already knew I was going to be disappointed.

"This is indeed the best pizza in New York. Dom is the elderly gentleman who makes the pizzas and he takes his time to form and make each one. This is definitely not the place to go for a quick bite. Food: 5/5We waited for ~35 minutes for a regular pie and it was delicious. The ingredients are very fresh and tasty. Eat the pizza there or within 15 minutes!!! By the time we got it home, it had cooled and it was still delicious!!! (but imagine how yummy it would have been fresh)If you want a single regular slice you might be able to escape the wait. Sometimes they have them behind the counter. Service: 3/5It is really slow... I recommend sitting there and waiting for your pizza as I saw one person's pizza was given away because he wasn't there and he showed up right afterwards (too late for him) and had to wait extra 20 minutes. Atmosphere:5/5This place is really old and has a rustic/nostalgic feel to it. The walls are lined with all the reviews and awards it has received. Value: 4/5It was $28 for a regular pie (8 slices). This is an expensive pizza but it is the best pizza you'll ever have, so it balances it out. Plus it is better than Grimaldi's and I don't have to make that trek all the way to Downtown Brooklyn.",5.0

Each slice is cheesy and delicious! - plain pie, good but the crust was a little soggy- Di Fara's classic pie comes with sausage, peppers, mushrooms and onions- square pie with sundried tomatoes and garlic (FAV!), Perfect crispy crust. Make sure to have mouthwash and a toothbrush ready for after. Your breath will stankkkk of garlic.Tip - If you are ordering pies for dinner, go to the little screen window and place your order for pickup.

"This is indeed the best pizza in New York. Dom is the elderly gentleman who makes the pizzas and he takes his time to form and make each one. This is definitely not the place to go for a quick bite. Food: 5/5We waited for ~35 minutes for a regular pie and it was delicious. The ingredients are very fresh and tasty. Eat the pizza there or within 15 minutes!!! By the time we got it home, it had cooled and it was still delicious!!! (but imagine how yummy it would have been fresh)If you want a single regular slice you might be able to escape the wait. Sometimes they have them behind the counter. Service: 3/5It is really slow... I recommend sitting there and waiting for your pizza as I saw one person's pizza was given away because he wasn't there and he showed up right afterwards (too late for him) and had to wait extra 20 minutes. Atmosphere:5/5This place is really old and has a rustic/nostalgic feel to it. The walls are lined with all the reviews and awards it has received. Value: 4/5It was $28 for a regular pie (8 slices). This is an expensive pizza but it is the best pizza you'll ever have, so it balances it out. Plus it is better than Grimaldi's and I don't have to make that trek all the way to Downtown Brooklyn.",5.0
"We arrived at 5pm expecting to wait on a long line outside. Instead we were told we could place orders for pickup. They told us to come back at 7:15 to pick up our 3 pies. Arrived at 7 starving to be told the pizza won't be ready for another hour. Was it still worth it? YES!!!!3 pies + 7 people = 0 leftover slices. I'm actually salivating thinking of the slices! Each slice is cheesy and delicious! - plain pie, good but the crust was a little soggy- Di Fara's classic pie comes with sausage, peppers, mushrooms and onions- square pie with sundried tomatoes and garlic (FAV!), Perfect crispy crust. Make sure to have mouthwash and a toothbrush ready for after. Your breath will stankkkk of garlic.Tip - If you are ordering pies for dinner, go to the little screen window and place your order for pickup. They'll give you an estimate of what time your pies will be ready.",4.0

"The hour trek from Midtown to here was worth it. It's expensive for a slice of plain pizza, $5 a pop, and if you want topping, add an extra $1. And it takes forever!

We waited close to an hour just to eat two slices to pizza. But nonetheless, it was delicious!The sauce completely makes this pizza stand out.

"Di Fara gets five stars and deserves zero complaints, unless you don't know what to expect and end up waiting for an eternity to pay a lot of money for a pizza you don't even want anymore by the time it arrives. I get it -- that could be annoying. So read Yelp reviews and if it sounds like the kind of thing you're into, go! But go informed.1) People lie about the lines around the block being there at all times of day, all days of the week. They're *always* there on weekends during prime hours, yes. And they're often there after work hours on weekdays. And on summer Fridays, sometimes it is still crowded at 3pm. So it's hard to plan. Assume the experience will take a few hours. But know that if you time it right and get lucky, it might not! Use common sense -- early in the day is always less crowded. Rainy days are likely less crowded. 6pm will definitely be crowded.2) So, as people have suggested, bring some beer or wine! Bring a book or a game to play! A crossword! Family jigsaw puzzle? Be prepared to wait for 2 hours without a sour face. And be psyched -- it's your lucky day! the train's running express right to your stop! -- if it's not busy somehow when you walk in.3) It's dingy in there. Not like bad health inspection rating dingy. But not like they've renovated and made it into a retro-cutesy caricature of itself for your benefit. It looks how it looks and it is what it is.4) The pizza is amazing. But it's amazing in a classic way -- a perfected version of a simple thing. So don't go for the ""amazing pizza"" and then write a mean review about how it didn't have toppings like bacon and ramps and goat cheese. It's not that kind of place. That's not what we're all so excited about! It's the great tomato sauce, great mozzarella, and fresh basil, hand-cut by a delightful and committed older gentleman right on to your pie. Each pie is different -- some have slightly crispier crusts; some have more basil; some have more olive oil on top. Go with it. Love it.5) Don't be a tool about your table. There aren't many in there and you're not the only one waiting for pizza. Enjoy yourself, don't be rushed, but don't think you can hang out and have a few more drinks after you're done. Or someone is likely to start a fight with you. And you'll deserve it. It's just not that kind of place. Go somewhere else for a relaxing evening.",5.0
"Yes, believe the hype.While I will say that this is one amazing slice, and while I will say that 10 out 10 doctors recommend it, and that I would choose it over any other slice I have had thus far if i didn't have to wait in line, sadly I did have to wait in line.Driving by i saw there was no line, my eyes couldn't believe the sight! my eyes were wrong, you walk in and place the order with no problem, but there is a catch, a slight 2 hour wait from the time you order, stuck on ave J with not much else to do. However, like most others, I appreciate the fact that Dom makes every pie personally, and watches over every pie and puts the personal touches on it, which really makes it a one of a kind pizza that I have not seen elsewhere.Today, as I write this, my mouth waters and awaits the next time I am willing to wait that long for a pie.",5.0
"The stars are for the taste. Simply great Pizza. I live in the hood and I don't have the waiting problem as much as others. I can go home and come back, but I get that the wait is annoying. I love the place but the truth is that for Di Fara to continue as is will be almost impossible. People don't mind waiting for something that is considered one of the best pies in NYC, but people do mind the conditions of the eatery. Eating at Di Fara can be a challenge. In between bites you have to fight off the flies and finding a decent chair to sit in is next to impossible. So while I love my Di Fara it upsets me that they don't give a shit about how the customer is going to sit and enjoy the slice or pie. Come on guys - Go to home depot or Target and buy a few decent folding chairs!  Also, I have to say it wouldn't kill anyone to wipe down the tables every so often. All that being said I still say go to Di Fara, but take it to go instead.",4.0
"We HAD been going to Di Fara's pizza for over 10 years, since long before the reduced hours and now crazy-long lines most temperate days. Since we live just a couple blocks away, we could take a quick trip to get a few great slices or pies. I say 'HAD' because as his prices have gone way up, his consistency has gone way down. When Dom is on, his is the best pizza I've ever had. But in the last few years we've gone a few times, and each time he either forgot ingredients or let the pies cook too long and burn. So we just don't bother anymore. The divey interior and long waits and high prices might be worth it if the pie were reliably great. But since it's not, who wants to drop e.g. $60 for a couple pies for a birthday only to have them come out...ugh.An FYI for anyone still interested in taking a chance. We've noticed that unlike the food from a lot of more ""generic"" pizza joints, Dom's doesn't do well after it's been out for a while (and forget about cold pizza for breakfast the next morning!). Maybe it's the flip side of the fact that his ingredients are fresh and high quality (a lot of them imported). Can't say, but it's by far best eaten quickly right out of the oven.",2.0
"It was really good, best pizza around. Like that the order was taken with precision and no issues or miss communication. 100% recommendation :) thank you!",4.0
"3:30 pm on a Wednesday, there's four people in there.  I was immediately put off by the way the lady talked to the customers - she talks as if everyone were three years old, and does everything (speaking, making change, writing names on the list, as well as making pizza) extremely slow.  I was shocked by the prices.  $10 for two regular slices?  Even if it's really good, can you justify $5 per slice ($6 for square slice)?  I order two regular slices.  None left.  When will there be more?  She tells me the old guy will be off the phone in 10 minutes, then he'll make a pie (she can't make the regular pie).  I'm mildly irritated, but what hell, I'll wait.  After sitting around for 20 minutes, I check with her.  The old guy is still on the phone (WTF?).  So I say, ""I'll take a square slice then.""  No square slices available, she'll have to make a new square pie.  At that point, I just left.It might be very good pizza, but it's still just pizza.  I'm not a tourist going there to say ""I ate at Di Fara's"", nor am I trying to fulfill a culinary bucket list.  Just sell me a slice of pizza and stop acting like morons.These type of places, the kind that make ""best of"" lists and become destinations, are often more trouble than they're worth, and that is certainly the case with Di Fara's.  Listen, pizza can only be so good, kind of like a latte can only be so good.  I appreciate a good one, but it's still just pizza.  Do yourself a favor and don't spend half your day or more fiddling around trying to get pizza.  My god, even the customers in this place were annoying.  I was listening to a guy eat a slice of pizza with his family remark ""I just love the way the pepperoni curls when it's cooked just right!""  Pepperoni tends to do that when it's cooked.  I think some people are trying to justify the torture they went through to get a slice.  If you waited four hours, you're a nimrod.This place made me appreciate the above-average, anonymous pizza joints all over the city, where ordering a good slice is a satisfying non-event.",1.0

It's kind of like how they think 'Peter Lugar' is the world's best steakhouse - and that's friggin' hilarious. Would I go back? Certainly. Are there better options - especially if you have to wait the obligatory two hours before you get your pizza? I'm afraid so.",4.0
"Lived in this neighborhood for about 10 years, and my husband is from here. We don't go because the line is always so long... And ""we can go whenever we want""... BUT when we did go, we loved it loved it loved it. There's a reason this beautiful old man is always on the best pizza lists. The wait is long yes, and he will forget about you yes... But it's so tasty and delish, it is so worth it. I am so proud to have tasted and to even have lived next to this pizza Mecca!",5.0
Best pizza in NY Im convinced of it and dare you to try and change my  mind.  Theres a reason why you wait so long for this pie.  I would order a month in advance if they required it - worth it on every level.,5.0
"Di Fara gets five stars and deserves zero complaints, unless you don't know what to expect and end up waiting for an eternity to pay a lot of money for a pizza you don't even want anymore by the time it arrives. I get it -- that could be annoying. So read Yelp reviews and if it sounds like the kind of thing you're into, go! But go informed.1) People lie about the lines around the block being there at all times of day, all days of the week. They're *always* there on weekends during prime hours, yes. And they're often there after work hours on weekdays. And on summer Fridays, sometimes it is still crowded at 3pm. So it's hard to plan. Assume the experience will take a few hours. But know that if you time it right and get lucky, it might not! Use common sense -- early in the day is always less crowded. Rainy days are likely less crowded. 6pm will definitely be crowded.2) So, as people have suggested, bring some beer or wine! Bring a book or a game to play! A crossword! Family jigsaw puzzle? Be prepared to wait for 2 hours without a sour face. And be psyched -- it's your lucky day! the train's running express right to your stop! -- if it's not busy somehow when you walk in.3) It's dingy in there. Not like bad health inspection rating dingy. But not like they've renovated and made it into a retro-cutesy caricature of itself for your benefit. It looks how it looks and it is what it is.4) The pizza is amazing. But it's amazing in a classic way -- a perfected version of a simple thing. So don't go for the ""amazing pizza"" and then write a mean review about how it didn't have toppings like bacon and ramps and goat cheese. It's not that kind of place. That's not what we're all so excited about! It's the great tomato sauce, great mozzarella, and fresh basil, hand-cut by a delightful and committed older gentleman right on to your pie. Each pie is different -- some have slightly crispier crusts; some have more basil; some have more olive oil on top. Go with it. Love it.5) Don't be a tool about your table. There aren't many in there and you're not the only one waiting for pizza. Enjoy yourself, don't be rushed, but don't think you can hang out and have a few more drinks after you're done. Or someone is likely to start a fight with you. And you'll deserve it. It's just not that kind of place. Go somewhere else for a relaxing evening.",5.0
"Yes, believe the hype.While I will say that this is one amazing slice, and while I will say that 10 out 10 doctors recommend it, and that I would choose it over any other slice I have had thus far if i didn't have to wait in line, sadly I did have to wait in line.Driving by i saw there was no line, my eyes couldn't believe the sight! my eyes were wrong, you walk in and place the order with no problem, but there is a catch, a slight 2 hour wait from the time you order, stuck on ave J with not much else to do. However, like most others, I appreciate the fact that Dom makes every pie personally, and watches over every pie and puts the personal touches on it, which really makes it a one of a kind pizza that I have not seen elsewhere.Today, as I write this, my mouth waters and awaits the next time I am willing to wait that long for a pie.",5.0
"The stars are for the taste. Simply great Pizza. I live in the hood and I don't have the waiting problem as much as others. I can go home and come back, but I get that the wait is annoying. I love the place but the truth is that for Di Fara to continue as is will be almost impossible. People don't mind waiting for something that is considered one of the best pies in NYC, but people do mind the conditions of the eatery. Eating at Di Fara can be a challenge. In between bites you have to fight off the flies and finding a decent chair to sit in is next to impossible. So while I love my Di Fara it upsets me that they don't give a shit about how the customer is going to sit and enjoy the slice or pie. Come on guys - Go to home depot or Target and buy a few decent folding chairs!  Also, I have to say it wouldn't kill anyone to wipe down the tables every so often. All that being said I still say go to Di Fara, but take it to go instead.",4.0
"We HAD been going to Di Fara's pizza for over 10 years, since long before the reduced hours and now crazy-long lines most temperate days. Since we live just a couple blocks away, we could take a quick trip to get a few great slices or pies. I say 'HAD' because as his prices have gone way up, his consistency has gone way down. When Dom is on, his is the best pizza I've ever had. But in the last few years we've gone a few times, and each time he either forgot ingredients or let the pies cook too long and burn. So we just don't bother anymore. The divey interior and long waits and high prices might be worth it if the pie were reliably great. But since it's not, who wants to drop e.g. $60 for a couple pies for a birthday only to have them come out...ugh.An FYI for anyone still interested in taking a chance. We've noticed that unlike the food from a lot of more ""generic"" pizza joints, Dom's doesn't do well after it's been out for a while (and forget about cold pizza for breakfast the next morning!). Maybe it's the flip side of the fact that his ingredients are fresh and high quality (a lot of them imported). Can't say, but it's by far best eaten quickly right out of the oven.",2.0

"3:30 pm on a Wednesday, there's four people in there.  I was immediately put off by the way the lady talked to the customers - she talks as if everyone were three years old, and does everything (speaking, making change, writing names on the list, as well as making pizza) extremely slow.  I was shocked by the prices.  $10 for two regular slices?  Even if it's really good, can you justify $5 per slice ($6 for square slice)?  I order two regular slices.  None left.  When will there be more?  She tells me the old guy will be off the phone in 10 minutes, then he'll make a pie (she can't make the regular pie).  I'm mildly irritated, but what hell, I'll wait.  After sitting around for 20 minutes, I check with her.  The old guy is still on the phone (WTF?).  So I say, ""I'll take a square slice then.""  No square slices available, she'll have to make a new square pie.  At that point, I just left.It might be very good pizza, but it's still just pizza.  I'm not a tourist going there to say ""I ate at Di Fara's"", nor am I trying to fulfill a culinary bucket list.  Just sell me a slice of pizza and stop acting like morons.These type of places, the kind that make ""best of"" lists and become destinations, are often more trouble than they're worth, and that is certainly the case with Di Fara's.  Listen, pizza can only be so good, kind of like a latte can only be so good.  I appreciate a good one, but it's still just pizza.  Do yourself a favor and don't spend half your day or more fiddling around trying to get pizza.  My god, even the customers in this place were annoying.  I was listening to a guy eat a slice of pizza with his family remark ""I just love the way the pepperoni curls when it's cooked just right!""  Pepperoni tends to do that when it's cooked.  I think some people are trying to justify the torture they went through to get a slice.  If you waited four hours, you're a nimrod.This place made me appreciate the above-average, anonymous pizza joints all over the city, where ordering a good slice is a satisfying non-event.",1.0

"The man, the legend, Domenico DeMarco , was working his magic making excellent pizza pies.  Arrived at 2pm on a Friday and the tables were full (seating for about 15 people) and a few people standing around.  We ordered a pie and continued to wait.  Pies came out a slow pace and as people ate, they left and new people sat with their pies; just be patient and by the time your pie comes out you will most likely get a seat.Domenico takes his time making each pizza, he doesn't let the crowds waiting affect his timing.  He shreds the mozzarella by hand one pie at a time and mans the oven as well.  I witnessed him taking a round pie out of the oven with his bare hands.After almost an hour our name was called and we received our (round) pizza.  There were 2 of us, but couldn't imagine not getting a whole pie. Plus there was a long wait for slices as well.  The pie went quickly, it's not a gigantic pie and if you are hungry 2 can easily finish a pie.  And what a pie it was!  The crust is unique, it reminded me more of an artisan crust vs. a standard pizza place version; his crust is probably the original artisan version.  It was chewy, cooked perfectly and had just the right amount of crisp to it. The sauce was delicious, not overpowering and it wasn't ladled heavy on the pizza.  The cheese was not greasy, but stringy and delicious.  This is the real stuff.Once out of the oven, the pie is sprinkled with cheese and topped with torn basil.  This really is a fantastic pizza and all the hype about this place is totally warranted.  With that said, I can't imagine going on a weekend and waiting 3 hours, but for lunch on a weekday it's a no brain-er and worth the experience.",5.0

"I wish I could say the pizza was fantastic, but... it's okay. It's more of an experience rather than a great meal out. We got there an hour or two before closing on a Sunday, and the seating area already had the gate rolled down. However, we put our name down for two pizzas, the margherita and the meatier one. We waited at a nearby Dunkin' Donuts for an hour before knocking on Di Fara's back door and sitting at one of the few tables inside. You may have to stand for 20 minutes until someone gets up from a table. After one-and-a-half to two hours, our approx. $35-each pizzas were ready.The first thing I noticed was that they were drenched in olive oil. The toppings slid right off the pizzas. They were thin, slightly chewy, and soggy, except for the parts of the crust that were burned black. The pizza tasted fresh and flavorful, but it might have just been all of the oil. I gobbled up two slices before calling it quits. Our party of four departed with about one full pizza's worth of leftovers.It's cool to see old man Dom making the pizzas, and the guy taking the orders is very friendly.

The kitchen is completely exposed so you can watch the pizza being made while you're standing in line.

"Important tips:-Get there early-Bring a snack or eat a real meal before you leave your house.  Whatever you do, don't come here hungry!-Go to the counter and order your pizza.  There isn't really a single line, some people are waiting to order food while some people are waiting for seats so just ask people if they're waiting to order.-Expect to wait at least 40 minutes for the pizza to be baked.-There aren't a lot of seats so unless you're taking the pizza to go, don't go there with more than 4 people. -Make sure you come back at least 20 minutes before your pizza is done in order to get seats.  -The pizza is greasy and soggy so get lots of napkins.Ok so on to my review.This gets a 2.5 but I will be nice and give it 3 stars.The first time I went there was Easter Sunday and it was closed! I checked their website and called to double check that they were closed but nothing! When we got there there was no sign saying they were closed, so I was not a happy camper.We went again this past Sunday around 5:30pm. Their website says they close from 4:30-6 but they did not (perhaps they should update this). We put in our order and they told us it was going to be 40 mins.The food!We ordered 4 slices, 2 plain triangles, one triangle with sausage and one square with pepperoni. The plain triangle slice was just okay, yes, you've heard me, ""just okay"" and my date felt the same. It was not worth the wait. The square slice however, was pretty damn delicious and perhaps one of the best Sicilian slice I've tasted. It was crunchy, saucy, super cheesy and the pepperoni was so good.AmbianceThis place is small, super plain and honestly, it could use a face lift... at $5 a slice, I am sure they can afford to make the place look as good as its reputation.Service: There is one guy at the counter who takes your order and he is pretty friendly.  But other than that, there isn't much to say about the service. I understand that some people find the fact that DeMarco makes each pie exciting but I don't. You know what I find exciting? Not having to wait 40 minutes for pizza.  If he were to teach someone he trusts how to make pies the waiting time could be cut by half (who knows, even more!).  The oven can clearly fit more than one pie.I am glad I tried it but like skydiving, this is one of those things most people will do only once.",3.0

"Best authentic pizza I have ever had. I've been here 3 times, with a minimal wait time (very rare from what I hear). Every pie is made with love. The cost is a little up there,  but I pay it because it's that good. I would definitely recommend trying it at least once in your life.",5.0
"I wish I could say the pizza was fantastic, but... it's okay. It's more of an experience rather than a great meal out. We got there an hour or two before closing on a Sunday, and the seating area already had the gate rolled down. However, we put our name down for two pizzas, the margherita and the meatier one. We waited at a nearby Dunkin' Donuts for an hour before knocking on Di Fara's back door and sitting at one of the few tables inside. You may have to stand for 20 minutes until someone gets up from a table. After one-and-a-half to two hours, our approx. $35-each pizzas were ready.The first thing I noticed was that they were drenched in olive oil. The toppings slid right off the pizzas. They were thin, slightly chewy, and soggy, except for the parts of the crust that were burned black. The pizza tasted fresh and flavorful, but it might have just been all of the oil. I gobbled up two slices before calling it quits. Our party of four departed with about one full pizza's worth of leftovers.It's cool to see old man Dom making the pizzas, and the guy taking the orders is very friendly. That being said, I don't think this place is worth a pilgrimage if you're coming from far away, although it might be fun for a one-time thing. It's simply too expensive and too long a wait, and the pizza quality isn't worth it.",3.0

"Yes, there is a wait and yes, it is worth it! My group and I arrived in line at around 6:45 on a Sunday evening (there was already a line running outside the building) and got our pizza at around 8:45. They close at 9:00, but Di Fara stops taking orders long before that, so get in line early!We split the toppings on our pizza - half special and half whatever. The kitchen is completely exposed so you can watch the pizza being made while you're standing in line. I watched how olive oil and fresh basil were sprinkled onto pizzas, right before they're finished baking - I think it made a huge difference in taste! The pizza's scent was crazy strong and the flavors just as intense. If you love food, Di Fara's is worth the wait.",5.0

As a lifelong New Yorker I can unequivocally say this is the best pizza I've ever eaten. Is it worth the 1-2 hour wait?  YES !!!,5.0
My favorite pizza... People complain about the price... Well good food is worth it... Been a difaras lover for close to 20yrs and sometimes consider driving from Staten Island for it... EXCELLENT PIZZA ... Fresh basil 3 cheeses ....AWESOMENESS,5.0
oh why Dom are you making me write this review! I have been living a few blocks away my entire life and have been coming here over 25 years and today validated to me why this place just isn't worth it anymore. came here around 2P on a Tuesday and waited 30 minutes for a pie. usually the waiting is over an hour and a half. we decided to eat inside as there were seats available and ever bite I took was blander then the one before. the sauce has absolutely no taste. cheese had no taste. barely any fresh cut basil on the pie and worst of all the bottom of the pie was ENTIRELY BURNT. BLACK. tastes like I was eating charcoal. after eating this pizza all these years I am truly disappointed. I never minded paying the $30+ for a pie but it's just not worth it anymore.,2.0
Long wait.  It is best to get a pie instead of going by the slice.  Pizza sometimes is burned which for the price is unacceptable  But mostly the pizza is delicious second to none.,4.0
"Amazing, amazing amazing. I don't need to repeat the praises, just to say that i wish I had enough time to wait for this pizza. I don't, so I can't really come here anymore. In the years since I first came here, the waiting time has increased to from  merely slow to well over 2 hours on many days. Those who can wait will enjoy the best pizza in NY; I'll have my memories.",5.0
"Yea, I get it. I get that this place is considered by many to be the holy grail of NYC pizzerias. I get the fact that Dom DeMarco makes every pizza by hand himself and because of that fact the wait time becomes ridiculously long. I get it. I get that despite all the fame and notoriety, the DeMarco family doesn't spend a dime on the interior, so it probably looks the same way it did 30 years ago. I get it. It's nostalgic. I grew up in an Italian American family myself (yes they do exist outside the tri-state area for those clueless New Yorkers who think otherwise) and this pizzeria reminds me of several pizzerias back home. One difference is back home no self respecting Italian pizza maker would sell his pizza in slices. It's a matter of freshness. Slices are a NY thing. But I digress. So I get it. I get it all.Well I get most of it. What I don't get is how some people think this is the best pizza in the country. I think all the nostalgic and the huge anticipation of waiting in a long line may have warped some peoples' judgement. Either that, or many New Yorkers don't get out very much. Now I understand many don't own vehicles but that's no excuse to not explore the world outside the city. If they had they're realize that many pizza places make a better pizza than DiFara's.So what did I not like? My biggest complaint was that the pizza was dry. No, Domenic didn't forget to add tomato sauce or olive oil. I just prefer a more wet and floppy pizza. Otherwise it's basically focaccia bread. Unfortunately the pizza's dryness also attributed to its rigidity. Rigid pizza sounds yummy, right? No.I also didn't like the fact that the cheese congealed 30 seconds after taking possession of my pizza. I prefer an ooey, chewy, gooey cheese, the kind that stretches a mile when pulled. There was none of that happening on my pizza. Also, the sauce was a bit too sweet for me. I prefer a more basic tomato sauce that's just one step below diced tomatoes. Last of my negatives was the price. $28 for a pizza?? I thought that was a joke until I actually handed over 28 smackers for my pizza.So what did I like? I liked the whole DeMarco family working together and in spite of very demanding customers they managed to treat everyone with the utmost respect. Very very cool. I liked the whole nostalgic and tradition thing. It's impressive that Dominic has been making pizzas here since the 60's, but it's not overly impressive because I can name a handful of pizzerias back home that were pumping out pizzas before Dominic was in diapers.Like I said I'm Italian American. This place would be ""mom approved"" because of the Padre Pio prayer card sitting on the back wall. My mom is a big fan of him too and has an arsenal of other prayer cards in her possession too.Lastly, I like the fact that DiFara's makes traditional NY style of pizza. Many of the newer fru fru pizza restaurants in Brooklyn make a style of pizza that is more artisan-like, than New York-like. Lucali and Paulee Gee's I'm looking at you. Again, tradition. I like tradition and kudos to DiFara for sticking to its New York roots.",3.0
"I grew up here in the NYC area, with many great pizzerias, but Di Fara outshines them all. Every ingredient is the absolute best you can get. The crust is thin and well-cooked. The sauce is incredibly delicious. They use a couple of different cheeses that are so flavorful. Once the pizza comes out of the oven, the owner (who makes every pie), drizzles some high quality olive oil on top, and cuts fresh basil and puts that on top too. When you taste it, it somehow is a flavor explosion and melts in your mouth all at the same time. The toppings are amazing, but my favorite is the plain, round pie...you can really taste the ingredients more without anything covering them up too much.Well worth waiting on line, but if that wasn't enough, they have private parties right in the pizzeria! I've been there for two parties already with my soccer team, and we were all treated like family. They will make any pies you want with any toppings right there on the spot.

"This isn't a pizza place, it's a monument, a Sistine Chapel that is painted and scrubbed clean every morning. (Health rating, solid B) Watching Dominic cover your steaming pizza with freshly cut basil and slicing it unevenly with what seems like the last bit of strength left in his body is not just seeing a cook, it's seeing a craftsman. A sculptor in dough and painter in marinara.My advice for newcomers is simple. Come early, put your order in, enjoy the BYOB policy while you wait, slowly meander into a comfortable seat. Then prepare yourself for an experience unparalleled by any creation of man. Get a cheese pizza, because though all the ingredients are top notch, his style is best enjoyed with nothing getting in the way of the basil crunching on a bed of cheese and olive oil, slowly fusing, making each bite  a separate experience from the one before it. Then get another with all the toppings you want and enjoy that too.I once stayed till closing, nabbing the last pie of the day, when tragedy struck. I was told, a massive spill of olive oil landed in the oven, filling the whole place with smoke. They attentively cleaned it and begun fanning the smoke out the door but it was too much too soon. We sat there, devouring the pizza in a cloud of smoke that would have rendered Tommy Chong unconscious, My eyes watered, and for a moment, I couldn't tell if it was the smoke lapping at my tier ducts, or the pizza revitalizing my hope for mankind.

"Di Fara is the godfather of pizza. I am honored to have been able to try probably one of the greatest pies in the world. Just the fact that he makes each and every pizza shows how much he cares about making phenomenal pies. I am still finding an excuse to make a trip back to NY for the sole purpose of getting Di Fara's.I made a trek out here on a weekday right after work. I arrived around 4:45ish and the doors were open but ""roped"" off. It was my lucky day though...a lady, I'm guessing one of Di Fara's daughters, came over to me and told me they were closed but that she would be glad to take my order for when they reopen. I was blown away because she offered to make whatever pizzas I wanted...my eyes lit up in disbelief and I said back to her, ""wait...so you're telling me I can choose the next 4 pizzas that Di Fara is going to make?"" She replied with a laughing smile, ""yes."" I felt a little overwhelmed at first from the excitement but I gathered myself and decided on a regular cheese slice, pepperoni, the grandma's slice with sausage and mushroom, and a grandma's slice with just cheese...(lay off I was starving!) After ordering, I walked around the area just trying to find things to do to keep my mind off the greatness that was to come. I got back in line at about 6:00pm and there were about 5 people ahead of me. But little did they know that Di Fara was in there making the next 4 pies for me. . The line got to about 30 deep. Finally, the gates of heaven opened up, the heavenly music was playing, and I see God himself, Mr. Di Fara, trimming the fresh basil onto my pies. (That actually would be my ideal heaven...Di Fara just making pies for me) 1) The cheese slice - cheese combination was amazing. Crust was cooked to perfection. Not cracker-like, not too chewy, and NOT wet. The best part was the sauce. The tomato sauce is so good and refreshing even. And the fresh basil on top just sealed the deal.2) Pepperoni - very interesting. Never seen this type of pepperoni before. They look like little cups or suction cups. I like them better than the normal flat/thin pepperoni slices b/c they have more flavor and are actual chunks of pepperoni vs. thin slices. 3) Grandma slices - Same quality of the other cheeses and sauces. The tomato sauce is perfect. Not too sweet but very tasty. The blends of cheeses just melt in your mouth. And the best part, the CRUST! I preferred the grandma slices because I loved the crusts. The crusts were cooked perfectly. Almost looked burned but tasted amazing with a slight charred taste that I like. Next time I am getting a whole pie. Wait, make that 4 whole pies...I'm a man of my word.I was truly in my own world enjoying these slices. And I felt so bad for the other people just waiting in line just salivating, waiting for their turn to take a bite of heaven. Great service.

"A great part of the pleasure of going here is watching Domenico DeMarco work. As is well known, he makes every pie served in this shop, which he has been running for 50 years. And there is plenty of time to observe him during the inevitable wait for your pizza, assuming you don't leave the shop during that time to walk around the rather charming side streets of Midwood. Seen from the front he looks older than he does in the painting of him that hangs next to the counter, his jowls pendulous and his back bent when he walks. He's 80 after all. He moves about the few square feet behind the counter with an almost robotic shuffle, not speaking to the customers, a job instead managed by his patient, attentive daughter, who writes down orders with a pen in 3x3"" squares she's drawn on a piece of lined paper, one square per pizza ordered, carefully and methodically ripping off each square as the corresponding pie is produced. His sons are there too, moving back and forth from the front to the back of the store, preparing ingredients and slicing the pies once they come out of the oven. But despite this well-oiled family machine, the pies themselves have no trace of a robotic aura to them, there is no question that they are human creations.Let me tell you about the pie my friend and I shared a couple nights ago. I'd poked my head in the shop before, but this was my first time eating there: and I will not say that what we ate was the very best pizza I've ever eaten. I'm a sauce guy. Many people will go on about the most perfectly singed crust with just the right thickness, or about the freshest cheese ever melted on a slice, and I think that's important, but a perfect balance of sweetness, saltiness, and tanginess in the sauce, and enough of it, matter to me personally even more. The sauce yesterday did not hit me right on the nose! What did hit me on the nose was that human touch I mentioned, how casually Mr. DeMarco arranged his quality ingredients, much like in the great pizzas of New Haven (please - at Sally's Apizza): the crust bunched up and blackened more on one side than the other; the massing of the toppings on our divided circle - half sausage, peppers, and onions, half porcini mushrooms - uneven from slice to slice, and even shockingly spilling across the normally inviolable midline of the pie; the dough thinnest in the center of the circle and even soggy at some slices' tips (an affliction that affects whole slices at the sadly overrated Grimaldi's), growing in robustness and crunch as your mouth approaches the outer rim and you end that particular movement of the orbicular opus.This was a pizza full of personality, folk art with a touch of urbanity, more aligned with Darger than Degas. It had the taste of a home-cooked meal by a host so practiced, so casual, he seems almost careless. But in the end this carelessness redeems him. If this were not Dom's but Domino's, each pizza might be immaculate in its own watered-down way. But would you remember the taste of that particular pie? This is not the perfect pie to be framed and hung on the wall. This is just good pizza.",4.0
Best pizza in NYC by far. It's very expensive and takes forever but you get to watch a true master practice his craft. It's quite an experience and the pizza will floor you. If you consider yourself a pizza pro you gotta take the trip down to Midwood.,5.0

"I made the journey here about 10 years ago for the first time and try to come back a couple of times a year.  It is without a doubt the very best pizza join in NYC, and arguably the country.  I have not had better pizza than this.  I can watch Dom make pizza four hours.  He is an artist.  My only advice is to bring some road sodas for the wait on line.",5.0
"This is a serious pizza experience. My boyfriend and his family have been frequenting Di Fara for years and I was invited on their last visit. I had heard a great deal of hype about this place from them, so I went in with high expectations. My experienced surpassed my expectations in ways I could not even imagine!Dom DeMarco, the little old man who grabs the pies out of the blazing oven with his bare freakin' hands, is the man. Seriously. The pizza is, by far, the best I've ever had. The place looks like nothing from the outside, there are approximately 5 tables in the joint, and there is absolutely no ambiance. But who needs it? Here are some things you should know before coming here. 1. Be prepared to wait. We arrived at an odd time where there was no line out the door, and we still waited an hour for our pizza. Apparently, that is nothing. Waits can be closer to two hours at rush times.2. Do not come here if you want to grab a .99 slice. Plain slices are $5 a pop. Insane right? I'd agree with you, but I've eaten it and am officially a convert. Shell out the $5, you will not be disappointed.3. Bring cash. A lot of it. We ordered two pies and 2 slices and it came close to $70.

This place is not just pizza it's a piece of history made by a true artist.  Those people that haven't tried it may miss out on simply the best pizza period.  Of course it's expensive and the place is a dump but what's your point.  Wait your turn and pony up the cash you'll see what all the hype is about.  There's just something magical about this guy.

"A great part of the pleasure of going here is watching Domenico DeMarco work. As is well known, he makes every pie served in this shop, which he has been running for 50 years. And there is plenty of time to observe him during the inevitable wait for your pizza, assuming you don't leave the shop during that time to walk around the rather charming side streets of Midwood. Seen from the front he looks older than he does in the painting of him that hangs next to the counter, his jowls pendulous and his back bent when he walks. He's 80 after all. He moves about the few square feet behind the counter with an almost robotic shuffle, not speaking to the customers, a job instead managed by his patient, attentive daughter, who writes down orders with a pen in 3x3"" squares she's drawn on a piece of lined paper, one square per pizza ordered, carefully and methodically ripping off each square as the corresponding pie is produced. His sons are there too, moving back and forth from the front to the back of the store, preparing ingredients and slicing the pies once they come out of the oven. But despite this well-oiled family machine, the pies themselves have no trace of a robotic aura to them, there is no question that they are human creations.Let me tell you about the pie my friend and I shared a couple nights ago. I'd poked my head in the shop before, but this was my first time eating there: and I will not say that what we ate was the very best pizza I've ever eaten. I'm a sauce guy. Many people will go on about the most perfectly singed crust with just the right thickness, or about the freshest cheese ever melted on a slice, and I think that's important, but a perfect balance of sweetness, saltiness, and tanginess in the sauce, and enough of it, matter to me personally even more. The sauce yesterday did not hit me right on the nose! What did hit me on the nose was that human touch I mentioned, how casually Mr. DeMarco arranged his quality ingredients, much like in the great pizzas of New Haven (please - at Sally's Apizza): the crust bunched up and blackened more on one side than the other; the massing of the toppings on our divided circle - half sausage, peppers, and onions, half porcini mushrooms - uneven from slice to slice, and even shockingly spilling across the normally inviolable midline of the pie; the dough thinnest in the center of the circle and even soggy at some slices' tips (an affliction that affects whole slices at the sadly overrated Grimaldi's), growing in robustness and crunch as your mouth approaches the outer rim and you end that particular movement of the orbicular opus.This was a pizza full of personality, folk art with a touch of urbanity, more aligned with Darger than Degas. It had the taste of a home-cooked meal by a host so practiced, so casual, he seems almost careless. But in the end this carelessness redeems him. If this were not Dom's but Domino's, each pizza might be immaculate in its own watered-down way. But would you remember the taste of that particular pie? This is not the perfect pie to be framed and hung on the wall. This is just good pizza.",4.0
Best pizza in NYC by far. It's very expensive and takes forever but you get to watch a true master practice his craft. It's quite an experience and the pizza will floor you. If you consider yourself a pizza pro you gotta take the trip down to Midwood.,5.0

"Some say the Di Fara slice is like a slice of heaven. We've heard so many good things about the pizza here for a while but we were too lazy to take a trip down to Brooklyn to give it a shot. Finally one night, we deiced to drive all the way down to Brooklyn from Queens to fulfilled our curiosity about this place. We were here around 6:30pm on a cold Wednesday evening. There was no line. We waited about 10 minutes just because we wanted the fresh from the oven slice. For $5 a slice, we were expecting something bigger. The size of the slice is just like any other pizza slice in NYC. After reading & hearing about how great the slice is, we came here with a high expectation. The pizza were absolutely delicious! You can actually taste the fresh ingredients. We also like the ""burnt"" thin crust. The sauce is light but very well balanced with the cheese. You'll love the fresh basil and olive oil that they top it with!The place is small, practically a hole in the wall, nothing fancy. We ate our pizza, sit for about few minutes & left. The staff is very friendly.

"DiFara's was worth the 1 hour journey, provided that it's not recurring!It easily has one of the best pizzas in the entire country (forget about NY, this takes on the best in the US!) and was third to pizzas I've had in Italy and Mexico. The trip is quite inconvenient, especially when the Q isn't running and you have to take a shuttle. However, once you enter the doors to DiFara's, you can definitely feel the passion and care that this man has for your food.Everything was made one by one, taking his time to create an individualized and personalized pizza for you. At the end of the day, a $29 pie is OUTRAGEOUS and the dough was a bit too salty, but you know this pizza is good when it even tasted like heaven when it was cold!Overall, 4/5.

"I know I'm probably going to be shunned for this, but honestly? I'm not sure what all the hype is for this pizza joint. We arrived here on a Saturday afternoon to find the place jammed. Granted, this is in the middle of a heavily Hasidic part of Brooklyn, so nothing else was open. My friend informed me that we'd probably have a good 45 minute wait before we got our pie, but that it would be 100% worth it. Order placed. ""Come back in two hours!"" WHAT? Dear LORD. Let me tell ya folks, if you're hungry and in this part of town on a Saturday, you're kinda screwed. Starving, we ended up finding a Thai/Japanese place a subway stop away where we nommed on appetizers while awaiting the pizza. Returning two hours later, we were greeted with ""it'll be ready soon!"". So after a full two hours, still not done. But this will be worth it, I've been repeatedly told. An additional 45 minutes later (that's two hours and forty-five minutes in total, for all those keeping score) our pizza was done. We rushed back to my friend's apartment and dove into the pie. I say dove because there was enough oil on it to fill a swimming pool. I'm talking soggy as can be. You couldn't lift a slice without everything gracefully sliding off, leaving a dangling crust. Now, gripes aside, the pizza was delicious, which is why I'm giving it a 3 star ""A-OK"" review. Was it the most delicious pizza in the city? No, not by a long shot. Will I return? No, probably not. The cost alone would have me barely returning even if the pizza was phenomenal. Over $30 for a pie and $5 a slice. That's way too expensive.",3.0
This places allure is long dead. Pizza is still delicious but in a city overrun by pizza places it's not worth the high price or long wait. They need to get with the times and speed up.

"Di Fara's. Diehard pizza aficionados swear it's the best pizza in NYC, if not the world.Ranked near the top of numerous polls as the pizza to beat, Di Fara's claim to fame is the uncomplicated use of quality ingredients as well as the tender loving care given to each pie by Dom DeMarco, an old-school pizzamaker.The first time I heard about this pizza institution was back in 2009. Many plans to taste this mythical pizza were made throughout the years, then quickly scrapped because of its inconvenient location deep in the heart of Brooklyn.My chance finally came in the fall of 2012. My friend Doug was moving to LA and requested a pilgrimage to this pizza mecca. Accompanied by Sam, a fellow pizza lover, we set off on our trek via the Q train.We must have arrived at an off-peak time because the excruciatingly long line mentioned on Yelp was non-existent. As we stepped into the restaurant, we were transported back in time. Framed reviews and magazine articles of decades past adorned the faded green walls, creating a sense of history and legitimacy. Fragrant basil greeted us at the counter as we placed our order of one Di Fara Classic Pie (sausage, bell peppers, mushrooms, and onions). In hindsight, we should have ordered a plain cheese pie, a mistake that we didn't realize until later. Watching a master like Dom at work with pizzas was an honor. His movements were deliberate with no action going to waste. Forming the dough from scratch, ladling the fresh tomato sauce, scattering the cheese and toppings and placing it delicately into the oven...these were all actions he must have performed thousands of times and perfected down to a science. The whole process was conducted in silence, interrupted by the occasional grunt of approval as Dom passes the pizza to the welcoming hands of hungry customers - many who have braved the 1 hr travel time and 1 hr waiting time.After 30 minutes, our pizza was ready. Our anticipation crescendoed as we saw him scatter the fresh basil leaves and top the pizza with a few streaks of extra virgin olive oil - the final strokes of his masterpiece.Carrying it carefully to the table, we let the pizza rest a bit, the basil still quivering slightly from the bubbling cheese underneath. Unable to deny our desire any longer, we tore into it.The fresh sauce, pillowy dough, and crispy, charred crust were mouth-wateringly delicious. The mild acidity from the sauce complemented the savory cheese. Unfortunately, the water content from the onions and bell peppers, coupled with the streaks of olive oil resulted in a limp, soggy slice which served as a slip-n-slide for the cheese to slide on our plates with a soft thud.A puddle of oil pooled on our plates as we switched to knife and fork since folding the pizza was no longer a viable option.My lofty expectations were dashed to pieces as I stewed in silence and finished the slice with a swig of Pepsi. But that wasn't enough to wash out the taste of disappointment.The only way to right this wrong was to double down and visit another pizza joint nearby in Bensonhurst: L&B Spumoni Gardens.For additional pictures, please visit (scrumphsus.com/blog/di-f…)",3.0

"Di Fara has really made a name for himself in the NYC area and for good reason. As New York's first $5 a slice pizza, It's truly a title that Di Fara of all places has earned with their testament to consistently delivering a quality product.The lines out the door really speak for itself when it comes to their pizza. People aren't kidding when they say be prepared to wait, overall from getting in line to shoveling pizza in my mouth, I think we waited a good 1.5-2 hours.Inside you'll find old man Di Fara diligently and lovingly making each pie from scratch. From spreading and tossing the dough, layering on sauce, adding fresh cheese curd, cutting up fresh basil via his vintage kitchen shears, and setting each pie in his circa 1986 pizza oven. His son will take your order on a legal pad with a pen and a system that clearly only makes sense to himself and tell you exactly how long you'll have to wait for your slices.As for the slice itself, there's not much I can say that hasn't been said. crusts are thin, well done on the bottom, but nice and firm on top while retaining all of its flavor. The sauce is really savory, it's hard to describe really but I could taste it on my tongue for 20-30 minutes after I ate it. It plays well with the cheese and basil which were just cooked to absolute perfection.There's something admirable about a man who takes it upon himself to truly master the art of doing one thing and then ensuring that it stays consistent no matter what. If you've seen Jiro Dreams of Sushi, you'll know exactly what I'm talking about. Di Fara and his fine establishment is like a more toned down, Italian version of Jiro.",5.0
"Di Fara is hands down one of the best pizzerias I have ever been to period!! Dom makes every single pie himself that is ever sold at this joint, he makes them with such care and with bare hands right out of the oven. And then cuts fresh basil that is grown in his pizzeria and for that extra authentic taste adds a drip of olive oil. I would have given this place 5stars but I think that 5$ for a slice of pizza is a bit expensive and they are regular size like any other pizzeria slices. On top of that the you have to wait about 30-40mins for the slice. They're well worth the wait just the price makes this a 4star especially because of the size of the slices but in taste this is 4.5stars. Dom still has the great passion as he did 40years ago! And who wouldn't want to try a slice from this 80yr old expert. Hope you go on for many more years to come :)",4.0
"Best pizza in the country, easily. Don't let any negative reviews sway you of trying this pizza. Pricy, sure, but it deserves to be with all the love and care that goes into making a pie at DiFara's. If you go, tell Dom hello for me.",5.0
"I made the trek out to this place since it's such an institution among  pizza lovers here. I'd say the pizza is good, for New York,  but it's not better than a good pizza from Italy.  The ingredients were very fresh but the olive oil didn't add flavor to the pizza and just made it really oily. Also, we waited 2 hrs for a pie when we were only third in line.  KEY LESSON LEARNED: do not get a pie unless you like standing in line forever.

I've heard a lot about this place and decided to make a trip here one Wednesday evening. We arrived a little before 7 PM and surprisingly there was no wait at all. We ordered the regular pie and it took about 20 minutes to be ready. It's a medium size pizza that 2-3 people can finish and the most expensive pizza at $28 a pie that I've had without any toppings. The pizza is finished with olive oil and fresh basil. It's definitely one of the best slices I've had but I don't think I would make the trip out again. A lot pizza joints in NYC make comparable quality pizza for half the price. The place is very old and has a few tables to eat in. It's best to eat it right away.,4.0
Truly worth the wait - though sometimes you do get lucky with a fresh pizza being pulled out of the oven and no customers in line. Everything is made with so much love and its apparent in the quality and taste of the pizza. Worth the trek no matter what part of town you're staying in.,5.0
Solid 5 stars made by the one man show in Brooklyn. On my way to CT I was passing by the original Godfather house and in the mood I decided go completely out.

"Difaras is a magical place where $5/slice pizza is made by the expert hands of Mr. Difara himself. Although his pizza is delicious and uses high quality ingredients, this also means that you are stuck with the pizza you are dealt with. Unfortunately for me, I was stuck with a pizza that was half burnt. Oh, awkward. I carried the pizza home with me. When I got home the pizza was good, but not much more than that. Everyone said that you should eat the pizza right away or it's not as good. But if I paid $5 a slice for pizza, I better be able to eat it whenever I want and have it still be amazing! Limited hours, long lines, and a burnt $5/slice pizza had me not exactly dying to go back. But I would be willing to give it another chance.",3.0
"A place to visit once in your lifetime if you're a Brooklynite and love pizza! I must admit that this was NOT the best pizza ever. Hands down the best part of both the slice and squares was the crust. The slices were thin and crunchy. The crust for the squares were thicker and crunchy as well. The problem that I had was the sauce being a bit salty for me. I prefer more sauce than cheese so it gives the dough/crust a nice soft crunch; but the tomato sauce was making me thirsty. I also got the classic pie with sausages to gave me even more of a salty punch. Hello blood pressure!Another reason why I had to knock down another star is the wait time. Since I wasn't completely blown away by the pizza, the 2.5+ hr wait kinda ruined it for me. They do a summer siesta between 5-6:30. I got on line around 5:50, doors opened at 6:50 and didn't get to eat until after 7:30. I appreciate the old man Dom creating each and every slice all by himself, so I like the hard-working aspect of it. As others have mentioned the price is high for pizza. We spent about $45 on a classic pie and 2 squares. That's some luxury fast food (except it wasn't fast nor located in the city). I guess I paid for bragging rights. I'd personally go for L&Bs for squares and Totonno's for slices. My 2cents.",3.0

"I haven't had a better traditional slice of pizza ever.Domenico imports all his ingredients from Italy, so everything is super fresh. Watching him make a pizza is like watching Mr. Miyagi doing Karate. His attention to detail is highly impressive. Dom doesn't stick to a strict recipe, he does everything by ""feeling and seeing"" the pizza. Anyhow, I ordered a square slice with pepperoni and a cheese pie. I'm glad I was able to try both, as they were both different and delicious. The square pie was cooked perfectly with fresh basil on top, and what I really loved most was how you could taste the olive oil in the crust. The cheese pie was to die for with every bite tasting better than the last. Everything is perfect, the crust, the taste of the cheese, the amazing basil that he cuts up personally, and the sauce. I read a lot of reviews stating that the slice is too messy. Well, as any experienced pizza eater would know, you need to let the slice rest for a little, and settle especially at the 900-1000 degree farenheit that Dom cooks the pies at. It's tough letting the pie settle but in the end its worth it. Also, the slice is a little greasy and oily which I actually really liked.I got there around 645pm, and the last order was taken at about 715pm - yep, they sold out hours before they close, so get there early and be prepared to wait. If you order a pie it will take longer than just a few slices so keep that in mind.

"Another New York institution that serves good food, but not really worth the cost/wait. I stopped by with a few friends around 7 on a Friday evening, and we ordered two regular pies, one with cherry tomatoes and one DiFara Classic (sausages, peppers, mushrooms, onions). We ended up waiting for about 2 hours for our pizzas (we were initially told ""over an hour"", which proved to be a little light, but it is what it is) and managed to secure seating for our small group. There are only a handful of tables, so definitely not some place you want to come with more than 6 people, and 4 is even a bit tough. The pizza itself is decent--the toppings are all very fresh, but the excess olive oil that is generously applied pre- and post-oven makes it a tad soggy; our first pizza was largely unable to be held by the slice due to its soggy-ness in the middle. The ingredients are all very fresh (sauce and cheese especially), but the dough itself is fairly unremarkable and not really edible to eat on its own. I've since heard you can call ahead and order in advance, and then maybe then it's worth the trek out here to eat some pizza. However, I just don't think it's remarkable-enough pizza to otherwise schlep out here for.",3.0

"The pizza was good, but nothing too special in my eyes. It's great that the place looks so authentically old-school, but the pizza, well... I wouldn't go out of my way to come here.In terms of which type of slices to get: we both thought that regular slices were better than square slices. Square slices are chunkier (more cheese) but the regular slices taste better. I guess the pizza is unique in that it's coated with lots of parmesan cheese and olive oil--but that can make almost anything taste better.I love sun-dried tomatoes, but they were wayyyy too salty as a topping. They made my slice super duper salty. Glad I finally got to experience Di Fara's (I'd heard SO much about it), but probably won't be coming back again. Half-hour wait for pizza (""fast"" food) is pretty excessive.",3.0
"Let me first start off by telling you I'm am a HUGE pizza fan.  My love handle existence is due to my over indulgence of this fatty fast food.  With that said, I came here during the summer just to order 2 slices of pizza.  As mentioned in other Yelp reviews, the line was out the door with many customers ready to order a slice or pie of Di Farra Pizza.  My review was based only on purchasing per slice so it might be skewed.  I though the price was outrageous for one slice of pizza.  I believe they were charging over $5 for one slice and $1 for a topping.  Once I began eating the slices I expected the Pizza to taste like Gold.The Pizza did have a lot of taste and I enjoyed eating the thin crust.  The ingredients of the Pizza tasted fresh and I believe it was of high quality.  The Pizza unfortunately did not taste like Gold and I was upset that I spend so much money for one slice.It took 20 minutes just to receive my Pizza which is way to long and my experience wasn't as great as most Yelper's.  Again my experience would have been a lot different if I ordered a pie which decreases the per slice price to $3 and some change. My favorite Pizza by far is still Grimaldi's",3.0

The sauce on the pizzas is amazing! Chunky tomatoes in a savory thick paste. Our pizzas were cold by the time we got them (due to the wait) so the cheese didn't taste spectacular but the slice was thin and obviously made with care by the great Di Fara himself. -1 star for the overall 2 hour wait (30 minutes to put the order in and an hour and a half for the 2 slices of plain pizza we ordered) I would definitely come back again but probably on a weekday for lunch to avoid the crowds.Also 20+ bucks for a calzone?

I stopped by with a few friends around 7 on a Friday evening, and we ordered two regular pies, one with cherry tomatoes and one DiFara Classic (sausages, peppers, mushrooms, onions). We ended up waiting for about 2 hours for our pizzas (we were initially told ""over an hour"", which proved to be a little light, but it is what it is) and managed to secure seating for our small group. There are only a handful of tables, so definitely not some place you want to come with more than 6 people, and 4 is even a bit tough. The pizza itself is decent--the toppings are all very fresh, but the excess olive oil that is generously applied pre- and post-oven makes it a tad soggy; our first pizza was largely unable to be held by the slice due to its soggy-ness in the middle. The ingredients are all very fresh (sauce and cheese especially), but the dough itself is fairly unremarkable and not really edible to eat on its own. I've since heard you can call ahead and order in advance, and then maybe then it's worth the trek out here to eat some pizza. However, I just don't think it's remarkable-enough pizza to otherwise schlep out here for.",3.0
Still the best pizza in Brooklyn.  Dominick is still at it and the pizza is worth the wait,5.0
"The pizza was good, but nothing too special in my eyes. It's great that the place looks so authentically old-school, but the pizza, well... I wouldn't go out of my way to come here.In terms of which type of slices to get: we both thought that regular slices were better than square slices. Square slices are chunkier (more cheese) but the regular slices taste better. I guess the pizza is unique in that it's coated with lots of parmesan cheese and olive oil--but that can make almost anything taste better.I love sun-dried tomatoes, but they were wayyyy too salty as a topping. They made my slice super duper salty. Glad I finally got to experience Di Fara's (I'd heard SO much about it), but probably won't be coming back again. Half-hour wait for pizza (""fast"" food) is pretty excessive.",3.0
"Let me first start off by telling you I'm am a HUGE pizza fan.  My love handle existence is due to my over indulgence of this fatty fast food.  With that said, I came here during the summer just to order 2 slices of pizza.  As mentioned in other Yelp reviews, the line was out the door with many customers ready to order a slice or pie of Di Farra Pizza.  My review was based only on purchasing per slice so it might be skewed.  I though the price was outrageous for one slice of pizza.  I believe they were charging over $5 for one slice and $1 for a topping.  Once I began eating the slices I expected the Pizza to taste like Gold.The Pizza did have a lot of taste and I enjoyed eating the thin crust.  The ingredients of the Pizza tasted fresh and I believe it was of high quality.  The Pizza unfortunately did not taste like Gold and I was upset that I spend so much money for one slice.It took 20 minutes just to receive my Pizza which is way to long and my experience wasn't as great as most Yelper's.  Again my experience would have been a lot different if I ordered a pie which decreases the per slice price to $3 and some change. My favorite Pizza by far is still Grimaldi's",3.0
Try to go on a off day (tues/weds) and especially as soon as they open around 6pm.1)Order your pie (get the Sicilian Square) Seating is extremely limited2)Eat/Devour the best pizza you've ever had in your life.3)Pay for your meal once you're done!,5.0
The sauce on the pizzas is amazing! Chunky tomatoes in a savory thick paste. Our pizzas were cold by the time we got them (due to the wait) so the cheese didn't taste spectacular but the slice was thin and obviously made with care by the great Di Fara himself. -1 star for the overall 2 hour wait (30 minutes to put the order in and an hour and a half for the 2 slices of plain pizza we ordered) I would definitely come back again but probably on a weekday for lunch to avoid the crowds.Also 20+ bucks for a calzone? What's the deal with that??,4.0
"Okay, for starters, this place usually consist of long lines of people buying slices. Let's disregard my first visit here... I wasted 25 minutes waiting for just a slice and wind up with nothing. The second time around, things happened  a lot smoother: I had just arrived a minute before their break in the afternoon. (They're so Italian, it makes them old school!) This time I had to wait about the same time, but left with a slice. From having just one slice, I'm seriously addicted to their regular slice. (I'm just not digging the idea of $5 per slice.) I absolutely love their crust -- it's not too chewy nor is it too crunchy -- it's perfect. The texture of the crust is so distinct that I don't even think I have had anything like it before. (I'm comparing their pizza to Denino's and Joe & Pat's on Staten Island.) On top of the balanced texture in the crust, their regular pie contains of basil, sauce, cheese and more cheese! I was star struck on my first bite: it was just so good, it's making my mouth water as I am writing this review. There was an even amount of everything... If it's the old italian man making your pic, nothing can go wrong. Bless this man for being old and still making that delicious pizza for us. TIP: If you're coming here just to try their pizza, bring a friend and an appetite! Paying $5 a slice is absolutely not worth it, unless you're utterly desperate. A regular pie only costs you $28. Grab lunch or dinner here with a friend, and make sure you have it fresh. I can't guarantee the pie be still be good after it cools off or gets cold.",5.0
I'm so disappointed..... Truly bummed. Messed up my orders multiple times.... Waited a long time for 2 slices..... After a long day and all I wanted to do was treat myself. Almost two hours... I heard this place is great and know how famous it is but its not worth it.....,3.0

"The square (Sicilian) pie is hands down the best pizza I've ever had in my life, and I suspect it will continue to be the best pizza I'll ever have. The olive oil-infused crust, the fresh tomato, the delicious salty cheese -- it was all out of this world.For a ONE time experience, it was well worth the hour-long wait to taste Dom's pizza, and to watch him work behind the counter, carefully sprinkling the cheese on my pie and hand-cutting the basil. I went when I was sure it wouldn't be crowded (it wasn't, really, near closing time; I hear that the other thing you can do is to plan to be there EXACTLY when it re-opens at 4). But it was still a long wait, and it's probably not worth it to again, when in Manhattan, there is slightly-less amazing but still pretty-darn-good pizza (like, for example, the Sicilian at Artichoke Basille's -- ignore their crappy signature slice and go for the Sicilian) is much more easily available, without a wait.As for expense -- well, it's a $5 slice here, but if you're buying a pie, the prices start to even out. It was $34 for a pie, as compared to Artichoke Basille's $30 for a Sicilian pie. Choose your options wisely, folks.",4.0
"Really good Pizza ! However management or even a small sign on the wall should keep other guest who haven't received their order yet from hogging the limited seating while checking their iphones and making people who have waiting 1:30 mins for their pizza stand up and eat.

Food=Awesome!!!! Tasted like I was in pizza heaven. The regular slice is better in my opinion than the square which is super greasy and has an extremely thick crust.Wait= A bit crazy.

"Delicious pizza.....worth the wait. We arrived during the siesta which is usually 5-7pm. Even though there were people in the restaurant, the door was tightly shut.

"Myself and four other expert pizza mavens headed to Di Fara two weeks ago as the first stop on 'ANDY'S HOLY GRAIL OF PIZZA' tasting extravaganza. We went to Di Fara, Totonno's and L&B Spumoni Gardens. The result of the contest and the review of Di Fara is below.AND THE WINNER IS: DI FARA PIZZA.With a grand total of 134 points, Di Fara dusted the other two worthy competitors in this contest (L&B 115 points, Totonnos' 98 points). Some of the comments made by my panel of expert judges about this extraordinary pie included:- Superior crust, although comments were mixed on the slightly burnt nature of parts of it- Delicious sauce and fresh mozzarella cheese, with the right amount of each.- A rich flavor that was way beyond the somewhat bland taste of the other two competitors.- The addition at the end of some very good olive oil drizzled on top, and fresh basil cut with a scissor and put on the pizza at the end took this pie to places unheard of in the annals of this totally ethereal foodIt was agreed that even though this pie was $28, it was worth every penny.Di Fara totally and completely rules.... and to say that this pizza is legit is almost a laughable word to describe something that totally eclipses the expectation that you would have for pizza or anything else for that matter. While we didn't get to go to John's on Bleeker St., or Roberta's due to time, one of those other joints would have to serve up something totally and completely amazing to unseat Di Fara as the best pizza on the planet. There are just no words to describe how good this pizza is., and while the words 'masterpiece', 'work of art', 'Fuckin Aye', 'off-the-chain' come to mind, the only words I have to say are - ""Its the best there is""..... and as my friend Ira put it ""Andy, I can't eat pizza no where else.

"Just thinking about Di Fara makes me HUNGRAY. We make the trek out on a Saturday afternoon in early November. We were able to order right away and ""only"" waited about an hour. the inside of the small shop was totally cramped, but it smelled of amazing basil. My friend and I only ordered one slice each. When they finally came out, they were smaller than I had expected, especially at $5.00 a slice. The sauce, cheese, olive oil and super-thin crust make for an absolutely delicious mess of a pizza. I had to inhale its awesomeness, lest its ingredients accidentally slide to the ground. The basil was the best part; I wish my slice had more. My chief complaint is that the crust was so charred in one spot that I had to throw that small piece away.Still, the pizza was tasty, the place is an institution, and I felt like a fangirl watching the owner man do this thing.",4.0

"It's good - the line was out the door, people waited over 2 hours for a pie, and the place down the block was half price and EMPTY.  My only complaint is the crust - it's always burnt and doesn't taste quite right, luckily the other ingredients compensate for it.   They've been in business 50 years, since '65.",4.0

"My homeboy Sam, a native New Yorker, took me by this joint after surfing the other week.

We put in our order (the special pie in round to stay and a different one with different stuff on it in square to go). Then we went and walked around looking for a place to get a beer -- pretty dry around there -- but we found a bodega, bought two bottles, and walked to the Midwood Athletic Center and watched some high school football and drank said beers out of paper cups. The coaches needed to teach the QBs to throw the football. A bee flew in my beer. The stadium was relatively packed with over sexed teens. Time flew and we went back and they let us in through the rope cord barring entrance to the sanctuary of old Brooklyn pizza. The pies came out hot. We waited for them to cool. I got a Rootbeer (n/a of course). And then we dug in. Worth the wait, the experience, every penny. Even though we got the square to go, we had a slice of that. Hands down the way to go. The round was excellent too: thin crust, nice sauce, every flavor bright and oily. But the square is kind of fried in the oo and just so crispy. Watching Dom make the pies is also a part of the whole experience. To see someone of that age still doing what he loves to do and it serves a community, that's just priceless. I posted a pic of my pie on Instagram and all of these og pizza heads I know (also native NYers) commented up a storm about too much oo, go here, go there, but you know, this was great. I bet those other places are great too. But I like that this has a story and the pizza tasted like a really good story. I brought some cold slices home to my girl. She was pumped.

To top it off the slices were burnt on the bottom, my hands were stained with black and the pizza tasted horrible.Dont waste your time with this place, you are better off going to Juliana's and getting a pie for $16 or any of the other pizza spots I mentioned at the top of my review.",1.0
"I've been hearing about this place for the longest time and finally had a chance to try the pizza. Honestly, after all the hype, I had high expectations. The experience is definitely nice and the smell of fresh basil is divine but, other than that, I feel the place is overrated. Definitely not worth the wait",3.0

"Simply one of the best pizza in NYC. The dough it's amazing the sauce is perfect and the kind of meticulous incorporation of ingredients can only be described as art. I live in fear that this place will close.  Domenico  DeMarco has made  pizza for more than 30 years now, his experience is like no other and you can still see him behind the counter making the best pies topped with fresh basil to this day. I love it when a place is well-known for quality that not just hype. If you haven't tried a Di Fara slice, you don't know pizza.",4.0
"I've been here twice now, and yes, you are likely to have to wait (though on my first visit I lucked out and was served in less than ten minutes).

"Di Fara's is constantly in contention for the title of ""Best Pizza in NY"" on countless panels, surveys, food publications, food blogs, and so on. Rightfully so. The pizza here is fantastic, albeit very expensive at $5 a slice and $28 for a regular pie. Whether you're a Di Fara's loyalist or not, most people will agree that they deserve a spot amongst the legends of pizza.The crust is crispy yet soft with a great crumb, chew, and flavor. The tomato sauce has a slight sweetness that contrasts beautifully with the saltiness of the fresh mozzarella. As Dom pulls each pie out of the oven, iconic fistfuls of fresh basil make their appearance as he carefully snips basil leaves over the steaming-hot pie. Another quick drizzle of olive oil and his masterpiece is finished.Now the dirty little secret... You're going to have to wait. A very long time. Ok, this isn't a secret at all if you've done any research, but you need to prepare yourself. This is NOT a quick grab-and-go situation. Your best bet is to reserve a pie ahead of time. Be aware that if you reserve a pie for, say, 4pm, that doesn't mean your pie will be waiting for you at 4:01pm. Dom is one man (an old one for that matter) and he's the only one making pies. Sometimes things get backed up and you'll have to wait beyond your reservation time. This is not unusual for Di Fara's. Loyalist and supporters like myself have learned to accept it.Be aware that seats are incredibly limited and often given to customers that ordered full pies as opposed to slices to passers-by. Sometimes Di Fara's will host private parties and the dining area will be closed to patrons. They will still take customers through the walk-up window. Be prepared to eat standing up or on the move if that's the case. You can usually check their Facebook page to see if a party has been reserved to help you plan accordingly.If you're feeling lucky, you can walk up without a reservation and try to get a slice or put in for a pie, but the wait times are often well over an hour. Last Sunday my girlfriend and I were fortunate and got two slices in about 40 minutes while a private party was going on. I was very surprised.

This gigantic ethereal sheet of molten sauce and cheese took an hour to come out but it was pretty amazing. We got ours with prosciutto, which was a bit too salty, but every other element else was great. The cheese was pretty gooey, the sauce was excessive, and more importantly, the bread was fantastically fluffy on the inside but crispy on the outside.

I read and heard so many great things about Di Fara Pizza so I decided to stop by on a Saturday afternoon while shopping with my friend. I figured it would be a lot less crowded and it was. The place was FILTHY, but I mean disgusting. The owner looked like he hadn't washed his clothes in weeks and his hands didn't look too clean either for that matter and he was touching everything with his bare hands. The price for a slice was $5. That's for 1 slice! My friend and I looked at each other after inspecting the place silently and we both agreed that this place did not look too ""kosher"" (no pun intended for my Jewish friends and neighbors). As we left we looked behind the counter from the window and there was bug spray, drano, rags, etc. all over the place. The floors were gross. I know that this place did not pass inspection a while back due to hygiene issues and all of a sudden there is an A in the window. It makes me wonder who is giving out the grades and maybe they need to revisit the place. All I can say is EW.",1.0
"My husband and I moved from New York to South Carolina. We are home on vacation and read all the wonderful reviews for Di Fara Pizza. Since we have been deprived of REAL pizza in S.C., we decided that it would be worth the wait and price. After standing around for 40 minutes, we received our basil laced slices - just as the review had promised. We walked back to the car, picked up the slices and bit into burned crap. The crust was completely black. All we could taste was that nasty burned flavor. What a major disappointment. There was barely any cheese or sauce on it. It should have been thrown out instead of served.  I too, looked around to see if we were being punked. The ketchup flavored, imitation cheese pizza in South Carolina is a thousand times better. Do yourself a favor and skip it. It's not worth the wait.",1.0
"After hearing many rave reviews, I finally tried a regular slice when I happened to be in the area recently.  It did not disappoint.  Delicious, crispy crust on the bottom, yummy cheese and basil drowning in olive oil on top.  You can taste the love of making great food here.  I look forward to retuning here and trying some slices with toppings -- even at the princely sums of $5 for a basic slice and $1 or $2 per topping.  It's a splurge, no doubt.The wait for a regular slice was pretty short, but if it looked like the wait for custom orders can be rather lengthy, and there isn't much room in the shop to hang out.  Or to sit and eat your slice.  You might end up eating it on the street, as my friend and I did.  Fortunately, it was a lovely afternoon.",4.0
"After about a little over 2 hours (an hour for traveling from the city and about another hr for waiting) i finally got my first slice of pizza - regular slice with proscuitto.  It was good (kinda on the salty side) with it's super thing crust crunchy dough.  that was delicious.  As i downed down that slice, we had to wait another 15 mins for our 2nd slices (2 squares).  I was not a fan of the squares.  It was too dense/heavy for me.  Loved the crunchy crust again, but everything in between the tomato sauce/cheese and the crust was just way too much for me.  My pick would definitely be the regular pizza with toppings.That being said though, $7 for a slice of pizza ($5 regular/square plus $1-$2 per topping) is pretty ridiculous.  That plus an hour wait for a couple of slice (you'd prob have to wait a little longer for a whole pie), i'm not sure i'll be back.  Dom is the only guy making these pies and it's pretty cute/adorable that he's still working hard at it.  Someone drew a picture of him making a pizza & it's hung right next to the oven. and next to that is Dom himself making each and every pie/slice with all his heart.  pretty fcking adorable/cute if you ask me.  Not sure i would travel all the way out there just for it but if i'm in the neighborhood, then maybe i'll pick up a pie and head over to a park and stuff my face there instead.  Or i heard there was a pick up option. NOt sure if it i still exists, but if it does that'd be my way to go.",3.0
"This pizza was great. I had a slice of the square and a slice of the regular with nothing extra on them. I got one slice after ten minutes and then waited for the other another 50 minutes. People that had ordered pies were waiting for over 2 hours but they all seemed happy to do so. All the seating was taken by people who were waiting for pies and not by people who were trying to eat, which was annoying. Other than that, the slices were great and we will be back.",5.0

"I grew up in Brooklyn and we have a certain sense of ""Brooklyn Exceptionalism"" when it comes to things such as Hot Dogs, Bagels, women who drink and curse like sailors and, of course, Pizza.  My childhood was spent thinking my local pizzeria, Victoria's - yelp.com/biz/victoria-pi… - was the greatest purveyor of Italian gastronomy outside of Southern Europe.   And while Victoria's will always have a special place in my heart and palate, the true king of all Pizza is a little old pizzaiolo in the predominantly Jewish neighborhood of Midwood: Dom DeMarco of Di Fara.Dom - the obvious offspring of a torrid and fantastical Italian love affair between a San Marzano Tomato and mountainous pile of Buffalo Mozzarella - lovingly hand makes each and every pie himself with a spritz of imported EVOO and a healthy handful of basil and other fresh herbs trimmed from his windowsill box.I've come here with friends on several occasions and waited as long as two hours just to devour a sometimes half bunt pizza, but it's always worth every second of the wait.  I can't begin to describe the sensation which will run up and down your back as each patron preceding you has their order filled and your's gets closer and closer. (You're absolutely mad if you think you won't pay attention.)The crust is thin and crispy, and the sight of near burnt dough may make you cringe initially, but it's actually meant to be that color.  The sauce is a light and savory mixture of San Marzano tomatoes and the cornucopia of imported cheeses leaves you begging for more despite the obvious fear of a fat-induced coronary blockage. Plenty have attempted to explain the flavor explosion you'll experience at Di Fara.  It's like describing a sunset to a blind man, it can't be done adequately. Just take my word for it, you need to experience Di Fara's pizza at least once.  Get past the wait (and lack of seating) and you'll be hooked.Some have scoffed at the $5 per slice price tag, but they need to recognize that Di Fara is not in the business of selling slices.  Drop into California Pizza kitchen and ask for a slice...they'll laugh at you.  Now, I'm obviously not equating Di Fara pizza to CPK, the point is that selling slices is a luxury to Di Fara.  Totonno's doesn't sell slices, neither does Lombardi's.  If you want to experience a fresh slice of goodness just cough up the $25 for a plain pie with extra fresh basil. You won't be disappointed.",5.0
I went to order take out.  I asked for a classic but the person charge me $39.  I looked at the menu and it was $33.  He gave me back the correct amount when I told his mistake for prepaid take out order.  I waited for an hour + for the pizza.  He told me that I didn't order the classic but the regular pizza.  He told me that he can't get me another pizza instead he would use the cooked pizza and dump all the topping and recook it.   I refused and got my money back.  I think they are famous pizza but careful that they would rip you off if you don't know what you get and what you pay. Zero star.,1.0
This place may look too small and primitive but this pizza place has been here for many many years. The pizza here is simply THE best pizza in entire New York! No exaggerations and the only disadvantage is that you have to wait for a minimum 30-60 min for a pizza pie. A slice of pizza is always available. Very busy but must visit place for real pizza lovers! Truly Italian crispy pizza with fresh mozzarella and basil!,5.0

The price for a slice was $5. That's for 1 slice! My friend and I looked at each other after inspecting the place silently and we both agreed that this place did not look too ""kosher"" (no pun intended for my Jewish friends and neighbors). As we left we looked behind the counter from the window and there was bug spray, drano, rags, etc. all over the place. The floors were gross. I know that this place did not pass inspection a while back due to hygiene issues and all of a sudden there is an A in the window. It makes me wonder who is giving out the grades and maybe they need to revisit the place. All I can say is EW.",1.0
"My husband and I moved from New York to South Carolina. We are home on vacation and read all the wonderful reviews for Di Fara Pizza. Since we have been deprived of REAL pizza in S.C., we decided that it would be worth the wait and price. After standing around for 40 minutes, we received our basil laced slices - just as the review had promised. We walked back to the car, picked up the slices and bit into burned crap. The crust was completely black. All we could taste was that nasty burned flavor. What a major disappointment. There was barely any cheese or sauce on it. It should have been thrown out instead of served.  I too, looked around to see if we were being punked. The ketchup flavored, imitation cheese pizza in South Carolina is a thousand times better. Do yourself a favor and skip it. It's not worth the wait.",1.0
"After hearing many rave reviews, I finally tried a regular slice when I happened to be in the area recently.  It did not disappoint.  Delicious, crispy crust on the bottom, yummy cheese and basil drowning in olive oil on top.  You can taste the love of making great food here.  I look forward to retuning here and trying some slices with toppings -- even at the princely sums of $5 for a basic slice and $1 or $2 per topping.  It's a splurge, no doubt.The wait for a regular slice was pretty short, but if it looked like the wait for custom orders can be rather lengthy, and there isn't much room in the shop to hang out.  Or to sit and eat your slice.  You might end up eating it on the street, as my friend and I did.  Fortunately, it was a lovely afternoon.",4.0
"After about a little over 2 hours (an hour for traveling from the city and about another hr for waiting) i finally got my first slice of pizza - regular slice with proscuitto.  It was good (kinda on the salty side) with it's super thing crust crunchy dough.  that was delicious.  As i downed down that slice, we had to wait another 15 mins for our 2nd slices (2 squares).  I was not a fan of the squares.  It was too dense/heavy for me.  Loved the crunchy crust again, but everything in between the tomato sauce/cheese and the crust was just way too much for me.  My pick would definitely be the regular pizza with toppings.That being said though, $7 for a slice of pizza ($5 regular/square plus $1-$2 per topping) is pretty ridiculous.  That plus an hour wait for a couple of slice (you'd prob have to wait a little longer for a whole pie), i'm not sure i'll be back.  Dom is the only guy making these pies and it's pretty cute/adorable that he's still working hard at it.  Someone drew a picture of him making a pizza & it's hung right next to the oven. and next to that is Dom himself making each and every pie/slice with all his heart.  pretty fcking adorable/cute if you ask me.  Not sure i would travel all the way out there just for it but if i'm in the neighborhood, then maybe i'll pick up a pie and head over to a park and stuff my face there instead.  Or i heard there was a pick up option. NOt sure if it i still exists, but if it does that'd be my way to go.",3.0
"This pizza was great. I had a slice of the square and a slice of the regular with nothing extra on them. I got one slice after ten minutes and then waited for the other another 50 minutes. People that had ordered pies were waiting for over 2 hours but they all seemed happy to do so. All the seating was taken by people who were waiting for pies and not by people who were trying to eat, which was annoying. Other than that, the slices were great and we will be back.",5.0
"This place has been ruined by hipsters and yuppies alike. No matter how good the pizza really is, its not worth $28 for a regular pie that I just saw on one of the pics shown. Not worth a 3 hour wait for one pie.there are much better pizza places then this one, who actually know how to function with more then one person doing the pizza making.",1.0
"I grew up in Brooklyn and we have a certain sense of ""Brooklyn Exceptionalism"" when it comes to things such as Hot Dogs, Bagels, women who drink and curse like sailors and, of course, Pizza.  My childhood was spent thinking my local pizzeria, Victoria's - yelp.com/biz/victoria-pi… - was the greatest purveyor of Italian gastronomy outside of Southern Europe.   And while Victoria's will always have a special place in my heart and palate, the true king of all Pizza is a little old pizzaiolo in the predominantly Jewish neighborhood of Midwood: Dom DeMarco of Di Fara.Dom - the obvious offspring of a torrid and fantastical Italian love affair between a San Marzano Tomato and mountainous pile of Buffalo Mozzarella - lovingly hand makes each and every pie himself with a spritz of imported EVOO and a healthy handful of basil and other fresh herbs trimmed from his windowsill box.I've come here with friends on several occasions and waited as long as two hours just to devour a sometimes half bunt pizza, but it's always worth every second of the wait.  I can't begin to describe the sensation which will run up and down your back as each patron preceding you has their order filled and your's gets closer and closer. (You're absolutely mad if you think you won't pay attention.)The crust is thin and crispy, and the sight of near burnt dough may make you cringe initially, but it's actually meant to be that color.  The sauce is a light and savory mixture of San Marzano tomatoes and the cornucopia of imported cheeses leaves you begging for more despite the obvious fear of a fat-induced coronary blockage. Plenty have attempted to explain the flavor explosion you'll experience at Di Fara.  It's like describing a sunset to a blind man, it can't be done adequately. Just take my word for it, you need to experience Di Fara's pizza at least once.  Get past the wait (and lack of seating) and you'll be hooked.Some have scoffed at the $5 per slice price tag, but they need to recognize that Di Fara is not in the business of selling slices.  Drop into California Pizza kitchen and ask for a slice...they'll laugh at you.  Now, I'm obviously not equating Di Fara pizza to CPK, the point is that selling slices is a luxury to Di Fara.  Totonno's doesn't sell slices, neither does Lombardi's.  If you want to experience a fresh slice of goodness just cough up the $25 for a plain pie with extra fresh basil. You won't be disappointed.",5.0
I went to order take out.  I asked for a classic but the person charge me $39.  I looked at the menu and it was $33.  He gave me back the correct amount when I told his mistake for prepaid take out order.  I waited for an hour + for the pizza.  He told me that I didn't order the classic but the regular pizza.  He told me that he can't get me another pizza instead he would use the cooked pizza and dump all the topping and recook it.   I refused and got my money back.  I think they are famous pizza but careful that they would rip you off if you don't know what you get and what you pay. Zero star.,1.0
This place may look too small and primitive but this pizza place has been here for many many years. The pizza here is simply THE best pizza in entire New York! No exaggerations and the only disadvantage is that you have to wait for a minimum 30-60 min for a pizza pie. A slice of pizza is always available. Very busy but must visit place for real pizza lovers! Truly Italian crispy pizza with fresh mozzarella and basil!,5.0
"This place breathes atmosphere.  Going here is an experience.  It's located on a busy corner near subway stop in Brooklyn.  Dining room is small with oven right behind the counter.  Great crisp thin crust.  Tasty toppings.  Slightly oily, but that's by design I believe.  I only had one slice because they were temporarily closed so I won't say its the best I've ever had but it's pretty damn good.  All pies here are made either by the owner (who I think is 83 so they close at times during day for him to take breaks) and the front is run by Maggie, his daughter.  Maggie was kind enough to let us in and sell us couple slices.",5.0

We got the regular pie, and after waiting for an hour for the pie, and it looked, and smelled, delicious.The dough was too doughy. It was just too much bread. Cheese didn't stand out too much. Parmesan was sharp and a bit overpowering, and the actual cheese didn't have too much bite to it. Good thing about the pie was that when the lumps of tomato from the sauce came together with evoo, basil, and the cheese, it was a great bite, but not the best.Tad bit disappointed, but like I said, maybe it was an off pie or my expectations were too high. I'll definitely get the square pie next time",4.0

Overall really good tasty traditional NYC pizza! You'd think with all that $$$ they'd fix up the place a bit more as barely enough room for people to sit and eat and almost a soup nazi type of feel to the place as the godfather (Dom) is great at what he does and still at it after all these years!

We checked in a few times, and were repeatedly told, ""Just five more minutes"" or something similar. We didn't want to wait any longer and got up to leave. She berated us and told us that if we left now, everyone else would have to wait even longer and it would be our fault. What? She continued yelling at us, basically saying that we couldn't leave. My husband told her we wanted to pay for our Cokes and go. First she wouldn't take the money, continuing to yell at us. Finally, she said it would be $4 (for two half bottles). My husband gave her a $20 -- she put it in the cash register and walked away. He actually had to ask repeatedly for our change, all the while getting yelled at by her for not wanting to stay longer. The pizza looked good, but the place itself is extremely dirty. During our time there, no one cleaned any of the tables. They were covered in parmesan cheese, dirty napkins, spilled drinks, etc. I heard one of the customers complain that his chair was broken, another pointed out that upholstery stuffing was spilling out through a large tear in his seat. The bathroom is really bad, thick mildew on the sink, filthy floor...not good. I wish we could have tried the pizza, but the service was such a turnoff. I get that Di Fara's is extremely popular, but it would be nice to feel like customers were valued. While we waited, there were a number of customers who approached the counter to ask how long the wait was. Each time, the cashier would shoot them a dirty look, say nothing, and walk away.

"Quite frankly, the best pizza I have ever had. Wait is long, but this place is worth the visit. If they gave Michelin stars to pizza joints, this would be one of those ""worth a special trip"" places. I no longer live in New York, but I will carry this experience with me forever. A one and a half hour wait is a small price to pay. Dom makes each one himself, the ordering system is a bit chaotic, but while you wait, you get to observe a master at work. The man reaches into the scorching hot 900 degree oven and pulls out the pies with his bare hands. The best part is when he pulls out a bundle of basil and a pair of scissors and tiny bits of green leaves rain down onto the pie. I think the real game changer here is the Buffalo Mozzarella. I personally prefer the traditional margherita, but the baby artichokes are also a nice topping (the son sautés these).   As for the price, I think it is quite cheap for what you get. I live in Switzerland now, and a slice of pizza costs $10 (you read that right) in the school mensa.

"Dom DeMarco carefully crafts every pizza. He has one guy working the cash register and taking down the order on a yellow legal pad and another guy in the back. He starts off by getting dough and shaping it into a circle. Then he adds tomato sauce and chunks of tomato. He then takes some mozzarella and slices them onto the pie and adds whatever topping on the order. Then he drizzle olive oil and puts the pie in the oven and checks on it occasionally with his bare hands. His arms are covered with flour. Then after the pizza is cooked he drizzle some more olive oil, snip off some basils, or add extra cheese. The wait is long- anywhere from half an hour to an entire hour. The service is slow and they even sell t shirts that say ""it's worth the wait."" Service is not friendly, more like take your order and wait. This place is always full. The classic Difara pie has onions, peppers, sausages, and mushrooms- cost $32 tax included. I recommend this. The peppers taste marinated and this is really good but not the best pizza in the world. It is on the soggy side but still good.One slice cost $5.They have spicy red chili peppers that you can add yourself on the counter. Its cover in foil and it is contained in a white mug. This is a must try. It taste great on the pizza. I recommend this place and it is fun to watch him create pies. Even Bill Debalsio eats here according to the article they have on the counter. He says this is the best place for pizza. There is not enough seating here. At most this place can seat 15 people. Also when you order, just go up to the counter and tell them your order and your name. You pay after you get your order which usually takes around 45 minutes depending on how many people are there.",4.0

Of course the pizza ovens were not working in the morning so they tell us a 1-2 hour wait plus another one hour wait for the ovens plus another hour for all the other orders ahead of us.

"its a good pizza. Fresh-quality ingredients. I will say there are better in NYC.  It is not worth a 2 hour wait, and that wait is typical on weekends. No food is worth that long a wait, especially pizza. The pizza was greasy as they pour olive oil generously after baked. The mystique of the elder man preparing each pie is the attraction I guess. Would not eat there unless in the area. As a suggestion, I would say the guy taking the orders should take off the glove when handling money. I saw him cut the pizza, and it gives off a bad feeling watching him handling money and handling food with the same glove. The pricing is higher than most other places. A regular pie $28.",3.0
"Let me start off by saying this is 5 star pizza!!  It won't and cannot disappoint as far as quality.  The pizza is here is among some of the best that I've had anywhere, and I've had a lot of pizza. Domenico is slow and consistent and cranks out gorgeous pizzas. Everyone it's own masterpiece; making you that much hungrier as you wait and watch him work.  I took one star off the rating because I was severely misled on wait time for a few slices. I was told 40 minutes for 4 slices (2 square and 2 triangle) but waited over and hour and a half. This was NOT on an extremely busy day. So I have to take one star off for that. If Domenico's daughter had told me 90 minutes from the beginning I would've planned for it better. The whole pie wait was 2hrs so I would've been much better off going that route. What I learned was this: always order a whole pie. And the square pie (which is baked twice) is much better than the regular pie and worth the $4 extra. If you don't want to wait 2hrs+ and pay $32 for a pizza, even though it is worth it, get a couple of plain slices of triangle pizza. You can get a plain slice in 5-10 minutes if you're lucky. If you want toppings then your wait goes up drastically. All in all, I'm glad I went but probably won't go back. I've experienced a Di Fara pie and I'm happy with that. I like my pies at Sally's Apizza in New Haven almost evenly and without the epic lines. It is a must try though.",4.0
This place is really good I used to live 5 blocks from here and never knew about it. The products are so fresh the taste is perfect.

"Finally!Ok, this born and bred Brooklynite is always on the quest for the best pizza. I've always thought that L&B and Totono's were the tops in the perfect pie category. DiFara's was always there, a name I'd heard, a review I read and a recommendation I had never tried.Well, today it all changed.  A drive home from a holiday getaway with the family had us driving through Brooklyn just around lunch time. It was time.We made our way to Avenue J amd 15th and parked across the street. BTW, remember to feed the meter machine and max out the time, your gonna need it.We put our name on the list and were told about an hour wait for our pie. Sounded reasonable as it was midday and during a holiday week, why not. Well, 1 hour turned out to be 1:45 however we snagged a small table in the corner and watched Dom perform his methodical magic with dough, sauce, cheese and basil. Lots of pictures and 90 minutes of salivating over the pies as one by one they came out of the oven, we finally heard the magic word, Adam.It was our turn to parade this gorgeous masterpiece of a pie across a crowded room to our table.This pie is made up of the following  ingredients:Crisp, well done and absolutely perfect crust. Ok, maybe a little soft toward the middle for a pizza folder like me however it is the hand drizzled olive oil that Dom uses that causes this and I'm totally fine with that.The sauce, a bit sweet, a bit chunky and seasoned just right.The cheese, mozzarella that Dom hand grates for each and every pie. No prestredded pizza cheese here. A great deal of hand sprinkled Parmesan cheese across the pie and in it goes.Now, only 1 or 2 pies at a time are in the oven and the process is a slow and methodical approach. Several checks for doneness and once those lovely bubbles of cheese are seen and the crust is slightly charred, out it comes.Next comes the hand cut basil as Dom grabs a bunch and begins to snip away with a scissor. He proceeds to use a small can of olive oil and drizzles the whole pie before serving.You hear your name, you pay, and then you eat. And your mouth is so happy! The flavors, the textures all perfect. Yes there is a long wait and yes $28 is pricey for a pie. Lets put it this way, if DiFara's was near my home there would be no other pizza for me. It's that good.Put it on your list, try it at least once. This is a must.",5.0

It is on the soggy side but still good.One slice cost $5.They have spicy red chili peppers that you can add yourself on the counter. Its cover in foil and it is contained in a white mug. This is a must try. It taste great on the pizza. I recommend this place and it is fun to watch him create pies. Even Bill Debalsio eats here according to the article they have on the counter. He says this is the best place for pizza. There is not enough seating here. At most this place can seat 15 people. Also when you order, just go up to the counter and tell them your order and your name. You pay after you get your order which usually takes around 45 minutes depending on how many people are there.",4.0
"I came here on a thursday around 2PM and there was no line, although there was still very limited seating.  I was able to snag a small table with one chair, which was fine cause i was alone.  I ordered a cheese pie, waited about 20 minutes, then devoured 5 slices (could've had more but I had to save some for my wife) of some of the best pizza i've ever had.  The 2 and a half hours on the subway was totally worth it. I wouldn't hesitate to do it again.",5.0
"Im a pizza connoisseur and will seek out  good pizza at any cost. So I bring my wife to Di Fara's. What a joke. You have old man Di Fara who gives my wife a dirty look after taking a picture. He looks like he should hang up the apron. Of course the pizza ovens were not working in the morning so they tell us a 1-2 hour wait plus another one hour wait for the ovens plus another hour for all the other orders ahead of us. The helper  left the cage down so no one could sit or have a drink while they painfully waited  like second class citizens on a bread line. So pissed, never again. Guys if you hate what you do hang it up. Maybe it was just a bad day. I apologize to Patsy Grimaldi for going behind your back it will never happen again.",1.0

"its a good pizza. Fresh-quality ingredients. I will say there are better in NYC.  It is not worth a 2 hour wait, and that wait is typical on weekends. No food is worth that long a wait, especially pizza. The pizza was greasy as they pour olive oil generously after baked. The mystique of the elder man preparing each pie is the attraction I guess. Would not eat there unless in the area. As a suggestion, I would say the guy taking the orders should take off the glove when handling money. I saw him cut the pizza, and it gives off a bad feeling watching him handling money and handling food with the same glove. The pricing is higher than most other places. A regular pie $28.",3.0
"Let me start off by saying this is 5 star pizza!!  It won't and cannot disappoint as far as quality.  The pizza is here is among some of the best that I've had anywhere, and I've had a lot of pizza. Domenico is slow and consistent and cranks out gorgeous pizzas. Everyone it's own masterpiece; making you that much hungrier as you wait and watch him work.  I took one star off the rating because I was severely misled on wait time for a few slices. I was told 40 minutes for 4 slices (2 square and 2 triangle) but waited over and hour and a half. This was NOT on an extremely busy day. So I have to take one star off for that. If Domenico's daughter had told me 90 minutes from the beginning I would've planned for it better. The whole pie wait was 2hrs so I would've been much better off going that route. What I learned was this: always order a whole pie. And the square pie (which is baked twice) is much better than the regular pie and worth the $4 extra. If you don't want to wait 2hrs+ and pay $32 for a pizza, even though it is worth it, get a couple of plain slices of triangle pizza. You can get a plain slice in 5-10 minutes if you're lucky. If you want toppings then your wait goes up drastically. All in all, I'm glad I went but probably won't go back. I've experienced a Di Fara pie and I'm happy with that. I like my pies at Sally's Apizza in New Haven almost evenly and without the epic lines. It is a must try though.",4.0
This place is really good I used to live 5 blocks from here and never knew about it. The products are so fresh the taste is perfect. The only problem I have with this place but it doesn't bother me add much is the price per slices and whole pizza. And the old man is getting a little unsanitary. But I'd easy there again if I wad in the area.,4.0
"Finally!Ok, this born and bred Brooklynite is always on the quest for the best pizza. I've always thought that L&B and Totono's were the tops in the perfect pie category. DiFara's was always there, a name I'd heard, a review I read and a recommendation I had never tried.Well, today it all changed.  A drive home from a holiday getaway with the family had us driving through Brooklyn just around lunch time. It was time.We made our way to Avenue J amd 15th and parked across the street. BTW, remember to feed the meter machine and max out the time, your gonna need it.We put our name on the list and were told about an hour wait for our pie. Sounded reasonable as it was midday and during a holiday week, why not. Well, 1 hour turned out to be 1:45 however we snagged a small table in the corner and watched Dom perform his methodical magic with dough, sauce, cheese and basil. Lots of pictures and 90 minutes of salivating over the pies as one by one they came out of the oven, we finally heard the magic word, Adam.It was our turn to parade this gorgeous masterpiece of a pie across a crowded room to our table.This pie is made up of the following  ingredients:Crisp, well done and absolutely perfect crust. Ok, maybe a little soft toward the middle for a pizza folder like me however it is the hand drizzled olive oil that Dom uses that causes this and I'm totally fine with that.The sauce, a bit sweet, a bit chunky and seasoned just right.The cheese, mozzarella that Dom hand grates for each and every pie. No prestredded pizza cheese here. A great deal of hand sprinkled Parmesan cheese across the pie and in it goes.Now, only 1 or 2 pies at a time are in the oven and the process is a slow and methodical approach. Several checks for doneness and once those lovely bubbles of cheese are seen and the crust is slightly charred, out it comes.Next comes the hand cut basil as Dom grabs a bunch and begins to snip away with a scissor. He proceeds to use a small can of olive oil and drizzles the whole pie before serving.You hear your name, you pay, and then you eat. And your mouth is so happy! The flavors, the textures all perfect. Yes there is a long wait and yes $28 is pricey for a pie. Lets put it this way, if DiFara's was near my home there would be no other pizza for me. It's that good.Put it on your list, try it at least once. This is a must.",5.0

When we eventually got to try the pie, I thought the pizza was bland and it was burnt on the bottom, and later on we tried another slice and it was essentially inedible.

"This has got to be the most over hyped place in New York or anywhere, at least when it comes to quality pizza. I first tried Di Fara's like 10 years ago when I was a teen, and remember it having been super under whelming. Well, now that I'm older I wanted to give it a second chance, and the result is tragic. This place SUCKS. I came in hoping to once again give the mushroom slice I had as a teen a second chance, and try their famous square slices. Just because you cover something in olive oil and add basil to it does not make it quality Italian food. The mushroom slice ($6) had more Parmesan on it than mozzarella (ever watch Do The Right Thing? it's like that), the whole slice was just slimy and flappy, no consistency to how the cheese was laid out, it was like splotches of cheese, areas missing sauce or cheese, puddles of olive oil, and about 2 slivers of mushroom (not exaggerating), and the crust was nothing to brag about. It took about 35 minutes to get that one slice. 10 just waiting for his daughter to take the orders, this was at 1pm, there were like 4 guys in front of me, and she wasn't running back and forth busy, she took her sweet time to start taking orders; then another 25 before I got the slice. Next was the famous square ($5) which I've heard so much about. Another 20 minutes before I could get it. His daughter pulled out some large ready made/cut dough square from the freezer, placed it inside the square pan, and then let her dad (the old guy) do his thing. The square was ok, but it was still absolutely mediocre. It wasn't as sloppy as the mushroom slice, but it was so oily that the crust was transparent, but despite the oil the crust was still super brittle. There is nothing special at all about the pizza in this place, other than it is incredibly over priced and over hyped. I should also add that the pan seemed to be covered in gunk and chunks of other pizza, as did the oven although he did brush it with a broom, the place just doesn't feel clean.

I don't even think he sells slices, and if he does, they are old, because everyone orders at least one pie lol.So anyway this is like gourmet pizza, with the finest organic ingredients, and the best pepperoni in the freaking world... and its all in this small little corner store that people wait for hours around the block!I mean, of course, it sounds completely insane, but their pizza is damned good, lemme tell you.  The old guy cuts the basil onto your pizza ever so gracefully, its so cute, he takes it so seriously.  And I guess it payed off for him.I've heard that the place has been shut down several times due to failing to comply with city health mandates.

"OMG, 6 stars. ""I"" am reviewing this place, trust me its the real deal. Quirky and very hard to love but OG 6 stars NY pizza. I'm gonna explain this place to you so you'll get a better understanding of Di Fara Pizza. So sit back, and get ready.First - Its a hole in the wall place, Its not charming. The tables are folding card tables and cheap plastic chairs. Old skool paneling on the walls as well as pictures of Dom making his pizza.Second - Don't think your gonna run in, grab a pie and bolt. You order a pizza and wait. For almost one hour. You may order a $5 slice (if they have it available)Third - location. How the hell do you get here? The friggin Q train?Fourth - Price. Where are you from, Long Island? I'd say a whole pie cost in Lake Ronkonkoma $16 bucks. Not here, its $30 bucks with no toppings. Don't like it? Take the Q outta here babyI ordered a $30 pie with pancetta topping. If your a first timer, don't get too loopy with the toppings! Start out slow. Trust me, the plain pizza by itself is worth it.I see Dom taking a sicilian pizza out of the oven and its sizzling. Friggin sizzling!! I have never seen a pizza sizzle before and trust me its a good thing.I see him making my pizza. It seems so simple, lay on the sauce, thick graded mozzarella cheese and cut up pancetta. He makes these pizzas one at a time. There is no rapid fire 5 pizzas in the oven. Just a few at a time, its a one man operation.When my pizza is finished? HE TAKES THE PIZZA OUT OF THE OVEN WITH HIS HANDS! What. The. Eff!!! He's my hero at the this point.Finally, he takes a handful of fresh basil and cuts a bunch over the pizza. Then drizzles more olive oil on top. So me and my boys fight for a seat on a folding table. We sit down and each take a slice. Holy Moley, THIS was the best pizza I ever had in NY, the best I ever had. Ever.What's probably funny and true? For $30 pizzas, Dom probably owns a small house and lives a simple life. I looked in his old eyes yesterday, he's tired but he loves what he does. And that my friends is the secret of life. Aspire to be more, not to have more.",5.0

I don't even think he sells slices, and if he does, they are old, because everyone orders at least one pie lol.So anyway this is like gourmet pizza, with the finest organic ingredients, and the best pepperoni in the freaking world... and its all in this small little corner store that people wait for hours around the block!I mean, of course, it sounds completely insane, but their pizza is damned good, lemme tell you.  The old guy cuts the basil onto your pizza ever so gracefully, its so cute, he takes it so seriously.  And I guess it payed off for him.I've heard that the place has been shut down several times due to failing to comply with city health mandates.

"This pizza is made with love.  Fresh ingredients. Everything is homemade. They make it in front of your face. It's legit. Also why not drizzle a little more olive oil on top? It obviously makes everything taste better.  These difaras know what they're doing. They do only make a couple pies at once, so it's best to decide how many slices you want up front as opposed to ordering one slice then deciding later you want another one.I've been lucky to go during off peak hours, so I haven't experienced this crazy wait time that everyone is talking about. I'd probably be mad too.  I hate waiting for things. This is the generation of instant gratification. But just wait  for this pizza, guys. It's worth it. At least once in your life.",4.0
"I came here once to get a pizza pie. They told me I would have to wait from 45 minutes to 1 and a half hours. I walked around the neighborhood and came back to check twice, still not done. At least they were honest about the 1 and a half hour. I just couldn't believe the wait and I came back a few times.The person at the cashier was fair. The last time I went back to check I stood there and waited. Since I was back and the people on line in front of me wasn't, he asked the chef to make my pizza first. When I got my pizza, I ate a slice in the car and I couldn't stop eating it. It was so delicious and worth the wait. The only thing I regret about going there is that I will never feel the same when I bite into any other pizza slices because this place was just THAT GOOD. I also wish I ate the pizza really slowly because I should have savored it!I would definitely come back to this place for pizza. I think the price for pizza here is reasonable because the pizza is godly.",5.0

"Even though Di Fara's is overly saturated with rave reviews, I must add my two cents on this place. I LOVE DI FARA! Definitely some of the best pizza I've ever had. Although it is NOT convenient in any way, it is totally worth all the inconveniences for a real NYC pizza experience!Di Fara is located in an unsuspecting part of Brooklyn (Avenue J between E 14th and E 15th St.) and there are no ""cool"" areas to hang out in the area. The restaurant is small, with seating for about 15 people, so consider yourself lucky if you get a table. There is ALWAYS a wait so be prepared! Last time I was here we waited over an hour for our pie, so make sure you come with a fully charged phone! :)The absolute best part about Di Fara is Dom DeMarco, the owner/old man that makes all the pizza. He scoots around the kitchen, individually preparing each pizza with his flour covered apron and hands. He is a true Brooklyn legend!When it comes to the pizza itself, I recommend the Square Pie. The crust is thick, crispy, and a tad charred (the corner slices are the best!). The pizza is very flavorful, with fresh, high quality ingredients. Dom is very generous with the olive oil and fresh basil on top. He cuts the fresh basil with scissors, which I find so cute for some strange reason. The Square pie is baked 2-3 times, so expect a longer than normal wait time if you decide to order one. In fact, Di Fara's is SO good that a guy once offered me $15 for a slice!

"I still dream about this pizza. As a Brooklyn native I had long heard it was the best of the best, but it wasn't until recently that I made the trek with my husband and some pizza loving friends. One of our group was a vet, and he knew the secret: Get there by 6:30. They close to clean the ovens in the afternoon after the lunch rush, and open again around then. We still had to wait a bit, but by the time we were chowing down there were about 100 hungry eyeballs staring longingly at our pizza. I almost felt guilty. There aren't may places to sit, so it's another reason to get there early. No frills, just big card tables and folding chairs. Taking it to go might mean more comfortable eating, but then you forego the fresh-out-of-the-oven taste. You have to wait for the pizza... but it's worth it. It is as good as they say it is.",5.0
"While I understand that not everyone will be a fan, Di Fara is definitely a must try! My friend spoke highly of this place. I went to Midwood High School back in the day and I never tried it until this year. My friends from Staten Island and Queens came to Brooklyn and we all went together. While I had high expectations, I was pretty confident that it would fall short since I heard such great reviews. We arrived a little after they opened and we were able to find seats for the 5 of us. We ordered the plain and the one with meats (I forgot what it's called). Yes, the plain gets finished with fresh basil and olive oil. However, it was the perfect combination. The meat pie was delicious as well. Extremely flavorful! Being a New Yorker, I didn't think pizza could ever taste like this. I loved it so much, I tried coming here with my cousins. They're brooklynites and have never tried Di Fara as well. Unfortunately by the time we arrived, they were closing. Now that they're back from break, we're going to make another attempt.

"This pizza is made with love.  Fresh ingredients. Everything is homemade. They make it in front of your face. It's legit. Also why not drizzle a little more olive oil on top? It obviously makes everything taste better.  These difaras know what they're doing. They do only make a couple pies at once, so it's best to decide how many slices you want up front as opposed to ordering one slice then deciding later you want another one.I've been lucky to go during off peak hours, so I haven't experienced this crazy wait time that everyone is talking about. I'd probably be mad too.  I hate waiting for things. This is the generation of instant gratification. But just wait  for this pizza, guys. It's worth it. At least once in your life.",4.0
"I came here once to get a pizza pie. They told me I would have to wait from 45 minutes to 1 and a half hours. I walked around the neighborhood and came back to check twice, still not done. At least they were honest about the 1 and a half hour. I just couldn't believe the wait and I came back a few times.The person at the cashier was fair. The last time I went back to check I stood there and waited. Since I was back and the people on line in front of me wasn't, he asked the chef to make my pizza first. When I got my pizza, I ate a slice in the car and I couldn't stop eating it. It was so delicious and worth the wait. The only thing I regret about going there is that I will never feel the same when I bite into any other pizza slices because this place was just THAT GOOD. I also wish I ate the pizza really slowly because I should have savored it!I would definitely come back to this place for pizza. I think the price for pizza here is reasonable because the pizza is godly.",5.0

"Even though Di Fara's is overly saturated with rave reviews, I must add my two cents on this place. I LOVE DI FARA! Definitely some of the best pizza I've ever had. Although it is NOT convenient in any way, it is totally worth all the inconveniences for a real NYC pizza experience!Di Fara is located in an unsuspecting part of Brooklyn (Avenue J between E 14th and E 15th St.) and there are no ""cool"" areas to hang out in the area. The restaurant is small, with seating for about 15 people, so consider yourself lucky if you get a table. There is ALWAYS a wait so be prepared! Last time I was here we waited over an hour for our pie, so make sure you come with a fully charged phone! :)The absolute best part about Di Fara is Dom DeMarco, the owner/old man that makes all the pizza. He scoots around the kitchen, individually preparing each pizza with his flour covered apron and hands. He is a true Brooklyn legend!When it comes to the pizza itself, I recommend the Square Pie. The crust is thick, crispy, and a tad charred (the corner slices are the best!). The pizza is very flavorful, with fresh, high quality ingredients.

"First confession: This review is about a year old but Dom doesnt change too much so I wouldnt worrySecond confession: I don't like pizza. I mean it's ok and I will eat it but it's not the passion that some Yelpers have for it and argue points over it.

I cant stand that burnt bottom taste. To me I would eat a slice of freaking Papa John over those gourmet crap pies that Yelpers do cartwheels over. So that being said I didnt expect much from Di Fara as me and a coworker set out across Brooklyn on a weekday late afternoon. I guess this is the time to come because on a wednsday at 3pm there wasnt many people and we waited about 15 minutes or so.

Putting his hands right in the hot oven, cutting the fresh basil, shaving the Parmesan, drizzling the olive oil.  One thing I love is food ceremony, craft.This is why I love Japanese food so much, the artistry of it and Dom is an artist.   So we get 2 slices each. My complaining friend takes a bite, pauses, swallows, looks at me and says ""you know what...this is effing good pizza"". He literally ate his words and we both ate the slices pretty fast. I loved it as it wasnt all burnt and tasted so fresh, i love basil (grow my own) and olive oil so this made it taste far better than any other slice I had before.    A year later and I sadly have not returned because it's in freaking Midwood and I wont travel that far for Pizza, Any pizza but alas  the memory remains...",5.0

"I'm usually pretty skeptical about pizza places that get raved about. Naturally I was super skeptical of this place because its reviews come littered with hyperboles like 'hands down,' 'best ever,' 'the ultimate,' 'magical,' 'oh, I know my pizza and THIS PLACE is numero uno' (okay this one was directed to me verbally by a random enthusiast when I walked into the crowd and hesitated; it was accompanied by an unneeded wink). Don't get me wrong, I definitely always enjoy pizza when I go to these list-topping places, but find it hard to understand how any pizza can REALLY inspire soo much passion. But for the pizza at DiFara's, I get it.First of all, there's Mr DeMarco. The little old man obviously takes a lot of pride in his pizza, and he is literally the only one behind the counter running the oven (though a helper runs back and forth from the kitchen with rolled out dough and crushed tomato sauce before Mr DeMarco showers it with cheese, pushes it deep into the oven and then nearly sticks his head in the oven to inspect that all is bubbling nicely.They quoted us an hour when we arrived, so like most of the others we put our name down and left to do some exploring of Midwood in the meantime. We returned 40 minutes later, a bit nervous we had missed it but there was no need to worry. It ended up actually taking an hour and half or more, so we staked out a spot at one of the folding card tables.So here's what I think really makes the pizza so great: While it's still steaming out of the oven, Mr DeMarco drizzles the entire face of the pie with olive oil, cuts whole leaves of basil on top, and silently pushes it across the counter. Underneath the just-wilting basil, pockets of mozzarella, and salty chunks of parmesan you'll find crushed tomatoes still intact. Any olive oil that slides off the top should be directed into the tray for later - I used my airy crust to sop it up and then dunk that whole thing in some parmesan (ask for it on the side!)",5.0
"This pizza is succulent and wonderful! Thanks, Dom!But, I don't want to talk about that. I want to talk about the youngish guy with a faux-hawk who lives above Di Fara's kind of to the right and above the green awning with the window open. So like, my friends were saving this spot for me to park in front of Di Fara's, and this woman tried to back in as I was pulling in, got supa-mad, threatened to hit my friend with her car, did hit my friend with her car, gesticulated wildly, screamed a lot, and then called the cops.  This all happened within 2 minutes while I stared from the driver's seat. She kept saying she wanted her Dunkin Donuts or something, so maybe she was on some kind of drugs because anyone who is going through so much trouble to get Dunkin Donuts is going through some issues I don't understand.  Anyhow, THEN, Mr. Faux-hawk upstairs starts yelling at my friends from his window and hyping the other lady, so now they're just shouting to each other so the whole damn street is staring (including the Hasidic/ conservative children).  Then my other friend was taking out her phone, and he starts screaming that it's against the law to take pictures of other people's cars (not true) and like sprints downstairs into the street with his wife beater and landline yelling that he was trying to call the cops.  WHAT? At this point, I'm like this noise is too ratchet, let's all get in this car and park a block down. Windows up, doors locked.Even though we were worried that the tiny crowd of onlookers in front of Di Fara's would come after us like angry villagers Beauty and the Beast style, we went anyways and got that pizza and it' was definitely WORTH IT. I guess the condensed version of this review is:1. Eating Di Fara's pizza is worth a physical altercation to get to2.

It ended up actually taking an hour and half or more, so we staked out a spot at one of the folding card tables.So here's what I think really makes the pizza so great: While it's still steaming out of the oven, Mr DeMarco drizzles the entire face of the pie with olive oil, cuts whole leaves of basil on top, and silently pushes it across the counter. Underneath the just-wilting basil, pockets of mozzarella, and salty chunks of parmesan you'll find crushed tomatoes still intact. Any olive oil that slides off the top should be directed into the tray for later - I used my airy crust to sop it up and then dunk that whole thing in some parmesan (ask for it on the side!)",5.0
"This pizza is succulent and wonderful! Thanks, Dom!But, I don't want to talk about that. I want to talk about the youngish guy with a faux-hawk who lives above Di Fara's kind of to the right and above the green awning with the window open. So like, my friends were saving this spot for me to park in front of Di Fara's, and this woman tried to back in as I was pulling in, got supa-mad, threatened to hit my friend with her car, did hit my friend with her car, gesticulated wildly, screamed a lot, and then called the cops.  This all happened within 2 minutes while I stared from the driver's seat. She kept saying she wanted her Dunkin Donuts or something, so maybe she was on some kind of drugs because anyone who is going through so much trouble to get Dunkin Donuts is going through some issues I don't understand.  Anyhow, THEN, Mr. Faux-hawk upstairs starts yelling at my friends from his window and hyping the other lady, so now they're just shouting to each other so the whole damn street is staring (including the Hasidic/ conservative children).  Then my other friend was taking out her phone, and he starts screaming that it's against the law to take pictures of other people's cars (not true) and like sprints downstairs into the street with his wife beater and landline yelling that he was trying to call the cops.  WHAT? At this point, I'm like this noise is too ratchet, let's all get in this car and park a block down. Windows up, doors locked.Even though we were worried that the tiny crowd of onlookers in front of Di Fara's would come after us like angry villagers Beauty and the Beast style, we went anyways and got that pizza and it' was definitely WORTH IT. I guess the condensed version of this review is:1. Eating Di Fara's pizza is worth a physical altercation to get to2. The guy who lives directly above the green awning might try to create that physical altercation, like a real-life troll guarding the bridge to Dom's pizzas, except he doesn't like riddles.",5.0
"Di Fara's the THE BEST pizza I've ever eaten. Way better than Lombardi's and Grimaldi's (the latter is utter crap IMO). It is so good that I waited 2 hrs and 45 minutes for a pie. And I would do it again. Domenico DeMarco is serious about his pizzas, during my wait, I saw him throw out 2 pizzas (that looked perfectly fine to me!) in the trash halfway through baking in the oven. I think about Di Fara's pizza often, but don't always get to go because it's out of the way. =(",5.0
"Upon walking to the entrance you are met with a B rating for cleanliness.  Been here a couple of times before.  Yes the pizza is good, but overall not worth the trouble.  As everyone knows it is a long wait, get right up to the counter and get on the list.  Always a bit of a wait, do not go on weekends.  Slices are small for $5,  no where to sit, and is really dirty.  BewAre of the bathroom with the collapsing floor, and no where to wash your hands.  What to do the workers use?!? hmmm.If you are a pizza junky do your self a favor and just go to L&b spumoni garden for the real experience.  In my opinion the pizza is good, and unfortunately places that actually have someone of Italian descent are hard to find in NYC so that counts a lot.  Just find it hard to justify coming all the way out here just for it.  Lucky I can walk here and even then will come only during off times.",3.0

Hands down one of the best slices in NYC without a doubt. I would rank it tied for first with tottonos white pizza. I have been here so many times and the pizza gets better every time. It is so worth the wait which can be unbelievable. My trick to minimize the wait is to show up and order a pie or two and then go run some errands and come back 30-40 mins later and I usually get my pizza within 10 mins or so. The pizza is unreal with the mixture of the many different cheeses and the freshest basil and tomato sauce. It is heaven!!And to add to that is the owner Dominic who has been making pizza for his whole life and even now in his old age every pie is a work of art. Watching him make the pizza is just as good as eating it.,5.0
"Di Fara has been the flavor of the month amongst foodies for the last couple of years now when it comes to ""Best Pizza in NYC"". While I agree it's probably top 4 or 5 in the city, it's not the best. But it's definitely worth the hike (for most) to Midwood.Get here nice and early and just wait. You'll be glad you did. If you're not amongst the first and you have to wait on the chaotic line (if you even want to call it that), it could be a while before you get your delicious pizza.Here's how you know Di Fara is legit: There's just one old Italian man making the pizza and he uses a rusty old oil can to pour the olive oil on and uses a dirty scissor to cut the fresh basil onto the pizza. It's also legit because this place has been shut down numerous times for health code violations, even before the city really cracked down and started that whole letter grade system. If that scares you off, good.

YES!!! definitely it is a MUST to try their pizza. omg.. it was amazing. i don't like hamburgers hotdogs.. or even fries.. but only thing i love are the pizza!!!!and this place is one of the best I've been to. tase was good.. the ingredients the chef was using were amazing. he would literally chop fresh basil on the pizza. one thing.. that got me knock off a star from 5 to 4 was the price. even though this place was worth it... $28 is just a too much for a pizza.. even tho 3 people shared the whole thing. i prolly will go somewhere else next time... but i am so happy i tasted this place's pizza.!,4.0
"I just don't get it.Yeah, the slice was really good.  Crust was crisp on the outside, and doughy on the inside, sauce was pretty tasty and the cheese was fresh.BUT, a 1 hour trip to Midwood gives you PLENTY of time to think about what the perfect slice of pizza should taste like, and I just didn't get that at Di Fara's.  If anything, my biggest takeaways for both slices (1 square, 1 plain) were that they were doused in too much oil, meager on sauce, and visually smaller than almost any slice you'll get in New York.And as is well documented on Yelp, they have the balls to charge $5 for the slice.It's awesome to see the original dude still making pies, but for a pizza mecca they need much more than a nostalgic moment to win me over.  They also have not put a penny into their store in decades.  I like the homemade feel of a pizza joint (which at its best feels like a familiar hangout), but this is really just a dining area in decay.

"If pizza could heal the world, this would be the place to get it.

The sauce seemed different than the regular pie too.  It was pure heaven!  A few minutes later I heard the magic words again.  T.S.  Pizza ready for T.S.  Score again!The regular Di Fara Special came out next.  Dom was chopping my basil and asked if it was my pie.  Told him, ""Yes sir and also wished him a Happy Fathers Day"".  He smiled, said thanks and then said ""enjoy"".  You could see in his eyes he loves what he does and thats why hes been doing it FOREVER and does each pie with love.  It truly does show and hes a master at his craft.  Im glad I got to try out his masterpieces.   Back to the pizza....The Di Fara Special has sausage, onions, mushrooms and yellow peppers on it.  This thing was just as amazing as the square....different, but just as good.  They are both so unique, you have to try out one of each.  You could pick out each individual topping as you went through each slice eating it.  The thing that stood out the most though was the other cheese besides mozzarella that he put on.  Whatever it was it had a great nutty taste and I kept wanting more and more.  Just a great pizza man.....easily in my top 5 ever!Total damage wasn't cheap by any means.  2 pizzas and a Coke came out to $65.00 or so but you know what?  TOTALLY worth it!  The pies are large too...between 3 hungry dudes, we brought back 2 slices of the round and 4-5 slices of the Sicilian.  Well worth it and I'm glad I got to try this place.  Its totally worth the trek down to Avenue J and to have to wait for a little while.

"So, on the outside, Di Fara's is a real hole-in-the-wall. There are no special decorations and fanfare (even the sign is somewhat unassuming).

This leads to my first tip--don't go if you're in a rush (or get one of the slices).As for the pizza itself, it's very much how a traditional NY slice should be: perfectly crispy and chewy crust covered in sauce in exactly the right amount with a uniform distribution of mozzarella. My favorite toppings are sausage and red peppers, but I'm sure even their plain pizza is delicious.

"as a preface, in all fairness I managed to catch the place relatively empty and only had to wait about 20 minutes from the moment I walked in to the moment I ate my slice. you've heard the hype, you've seen the articles, you know the price. overall, it's...good. it's very good. you can't really ask for much more in a slice of pizza, which is just that, a slice of pizza. I like fancy pizza, I like $0.99 pizza, I like pizza in general. before you haters attack me for not being a true pizza connoisseur or aficionado or enthusiast, I spent six months living in Italy so I get it. the pizza is delicious, there's no denying it. It tastes fresh, there's a great ratio of ingredients, and it's a gosh darned good slice. HOWEVER. would I wait an hour for it more than once? no. would I ever pay $5 a slice again? no. am I glad I tried it once as a resident in this city? yes. as I said, I went at 2:45 PM on a friday and the entirety of the experience was relatively quick, pleasant, and enjoyable to my palette. worth trying out if you're in the general area, not worth making the trek as a visitor to the big apple. big ups to the homie dom, it really is true that he hand makes every single pizza. It's seems the reputation has gone a bit to their heads, as the place isn't very clean, the tables are full of hours of pizza residue, the utensils are in a box; just because you're a great joint that can charge (barely) $5 per slice doesn't make getting a B by the health department fine and dandy. anywho, it's a good stop on your pizza journey through life.",4.0
"Delicious. Waited about an hour on a Sunday night from the time we placed the order to the time we finally got it in our hands but it was very much worth the wait.

"as a preface, in all fairness I managed to catch the place relatively empty and only had to wait about 20 minutes from the moment I walked in to the moment I ate my slice. you've heard the hype, you've seen the articles, you know the price. overall, it's...good. it's very good. you can't really ask for much more in a slice of pizza, which is just that, a slice of pizza. I like fancy pizza, I like $0.99 pizza, I like pizza in general. before you haters attack me for not being a true pizza connoisseur or aficionado or enthusiast, I spent six months living in Italy so I get it. the pizza is delicious, there's no denying it. It tastes fresh, there's a great ratio of ingredients, and it's a gosh darned good slice. HOWEVER. would I wait an hour for it more than once? no. would I ever pay $5 a slice again? no. am I glad I tried it once as a resident in this city? yes. as I said, I went at 2:45 PM on a friday and the entirety of the experience was relatively quick, pleasant, and enjoyable to my palette. worth trying out if you're in the general area, not worth making the trek as a visitor to the big apple. big ups to the homie dom, it really is true that he hand makes every single pizza. It's seems the reputation has gone a bit to their heads, as the place isn't very clean, the tables are full of hours of pizza residue, the utensils are in a box; just because you're a great joint that can charge (barely) $5 per slice doesn't make getting a B by the health department fine and dandy. anywho, it's a good stop on your pizza journey through life.",4.0
"Delicious. Waited about an hour on a Sunday night from the time we placed the order to the time we finally got it in our hands but it was very much worth the wait. The basil was more aromatic and flavorful than any other basil I've eaten in my life, must've been homegrown or something. I highly recommend eating the pizza immediately when it comes out the oven instead of bringing it home. After only 15 minutes in a closed box, the crust got soggy already :(",5.0

"The slices are great, but I don't know what all the hype is about.  The prices are just outlandish, and it's crazy that you can get all the way out there and have them be out of dough, or have the ovens shutdown.  Might be worth it if you live nearby, but I won't be making any more journeys out there for DiFara.",3.0
"I've been coming here for years. Having grown up in Bensonhurst, I've had some of the best pizza. This place is located in Midwood. What is interesting is that its in a most unlikely location.

Di Fara is the corner pizza store (1424 if I'm correct). If you're going to visit New York and are in the hunt for some of the finest pizza, this should be one of your stops. Note: you need to be patient if you are eating there. Service is not quick but you'll be satisfied. I don't like to rate pizza shops as being the best out there because everyone has a preference of how they like their pizza. All I can say is this is real, old school authentic Italian pizza.",5.0

Best pizza! Fresh! Been coming here since I was a kid. Because of the popularity service isnt great but what do u expect when its only Dominic making the pizzas. A man whos in his late 70s or 80s.

"When I evaluate pizza, this is the Di Fara pie is the standard that I compare it to. The ingredients are fresh. Char is perfect. Basil is generous. Zero complaints about the food.

"We were on our quest to find the most delicious pizza in NY...and chose this place over my friend's Grimaldi's recommendation.Let me just say, this place is tiny! It was raining and there was barely anywhere to sit, or stand. The line was out the door so we were freezing in the cold waiting for our pizza! The pizza is really fresh. The fresh chopped basil at the end really ads to the freshness and flavor. The guy making the pizzas is definitely a pizza master who knows what he's doing! It's like he's a pizza making machine, pizza after pizza after pizza with impeccable perfection.We got the Di Fara Special pie and finished it all between three girls. We were definitely very fed.

The restaurant is a small area with fluorescent lights, a few cafeteria tables and fold up chairs. If the place had a nice bar, cozy warm atmosphere, where the walls were lined with the great reviews and history, it would be so much better.Instead, we stood starving in a cold bright room drinking canned Sapporo from the convenience store, trying not to bump into hungry patrons waiting for a pizza like they might wait for a Visa...anxious, listening intently for their initials...The key--order, then leave.

"I always love seeing someone like Dom still taking pride in his work after so many years.  I think that is why people really come here.  For people who live around there, it's their way of preserving a memory; remember the neighborhood as it was when they were kids.  And for people who didn't grow up around Di Fara's, the story of a man who is still making pizzas the same way after 50 years is an appealing story.Do I think the pizza is the best I've ever had? No. It's very good, but not so unique you can find similar pizza elsewhere in NY.  And that's fine.  For me, watching someone still dedicated to his craft after half a decade was worth the trip.  In a world of robotics, cheap labor, and unskilled workers, craftsman are a rare thing these days.

"How have I NOT reviewed this place yet?Best pizza I've ever had to date. Go during the weekdays at off-hours and you don't have to wait as long. Typically, getting it by the slice will be quicker too, but be warned - you will want more than a slice or two!!!I live in SF, but every single time I go to NY, I jump on the long subway ride and travel from anywhere in Manhattan to deep into Brooklyn for this slice of heaven. This is one of only two places in NY that I truly miss while I'm in SF. As much as I wish there was better pizza in SF... this one just hands-down trumps them all!Margherita pie - Everything from the crust, the sauce, the cheese, the olive oil, and the basil make up the perfect complexion that a true pizza should be. The middle of the pizza, yes, gets a little soggy, but only in a good way! It's truly flavor like you can't get anywhere else. And c'mon, you've got to give the owner a little bit of credit - Dom pulls pizzas out of the burning hot oven with his bare hands. Now that's badass - only a pizza masterpiece can come out of that!!

I agree with what every thing James h wrote ...it's an art to experience what goes in in that pizzeria....Since I am a pizza lover...n I might upset certain people....

"one word: heartbreaking.My friends have been bragging about this place for years to me.

You don't see that anymore and as soon as you walk in, you'll see the dark green paint and all the articles and magazine covers and credentials DiFara's pizza were ever in.It wasn't too busy like I anticipated and honestly, I wanted to share this experience with my brother and mom. So, I placed my order and gave the assistant my name since I wanted the DiFara Classic Pie (which btw is a whopping $32 for a 8-slice pie. go hard or go home right?) He told us it would be a 1-hour wait which we were willing to do. So, we stepped out for about 40 minutes. Came back and I asked how much longer and was told 5 minutes. It turned out he ended up giving our pie to the people who ordered right after us, thinking we were together (he happened to be asian as well and I'm filipino). So, I was then informed 15 more minutes. Okay no biggie, I'm assuming the next pie will be ours. nope. neither was the next or the one after or the 8 pies after. waited an extra half an hour after pie after pie passed me. This was so frustrating and HEARTBREAKING. I would understand that maybe we should have waited in the pizzeria but people were ordering pies and stepping out as well. What made our order any different??I did not want to go down this route but this is what I got out of it. I felt like because we were a different race, we were treated differently. mind you, I refuse to mention situations like this but its only right because my mother was offended by the patrons eating there as well. A group of Caucasian males looked at us and complained loudly about the ""different kind of people coming here."" this is absurd and you're in NY, buddy. I also felt DeMarco and his assistant were constantly postponing our order. We finally got our pie after that long wait. it was burnt. horribly burnt on the crusts. I've enjoyed brick-oven before but it was a flimsy dough and putting that handful of parm was salty and not impressive. the fresh basil, maybe. nothing about this pie impressed me. Remember I mentioned I saw the same kinds of pizza pie passed me? yeah, I think I'm able to tell the difference if DeMarco cared for our pie like he did others.Sorry, they lost a potentially good yelp review. and this is probably my longest. its a shame they have to run their business this way. Well, I always have had Gaby's Pizza on Hillside. Want superceded flavor AND service? get Gaby's in Queens Village. I would even refer to $1 pizza from TwoBros in Manhattan than DeMarco's pizza.",1.0
"there's something especially charming about these old establishments that are a throwback of old new york. Quick aside, if you really think about, I have these moments where I just sit in awe of the reality of the sheer number of great people that have walked these streets that we have walked - and even the ones who we never heard about - to me, it keeps me in a constant state of wonder.okay, so this leads me to di fara pizza. the same man making pizza for customers for decades. I just wonder how many people stepped through those doors over the years with a story to tell. Maybe they were regulars. Maybe they were the first customers to come before it became an absolute tourist trap for transients like me.... but no matter who you are, I think there is something magical about this place. an establishment where one man makes pizza the right way for his entire life day in and day out. In a city where change is the ethos of the day, sometimes its nice to have something consistent.It wasn't the best pizza I have ever had in NY, but it's right up there in the mix. the wait was about an hour - the only thing that sucks about this is that if you go on a saturday, the place is a ghost town, and there is literally nothing to do but go to the convenience store and god forbid, loiter with your friends.But you can tell the ingredients are fresh, and that there is something truly authentic in the craft and final product here. a quintessential nyc slice. just to clarify, when I say fresh, there is that extra ""it"" factor when it comes to the mixture of flavors that hit your taste buds and connect to those weird brain electrodes..... i should probably stop there - but the flavor of the basil, the salami that i like to imagine comes from the local butcher down the street who the old man has been friends with since childhood...ok i digress.Go here for the experience, for an authentic nyc slice, and a long ass wait ;) nyc baby!!!",4.0

A group of Caucasian males looked at us and complained loudly about the ""different kind of people coming here."" this is absurd and you're in NY, buddy. I also felt DeMarco and his assistant were constantly postponing our order. We finally got our pie after that long wait. it was burnt. horribly burnt on the crusts. I've enjoyed brick-oven before but it was a flimsy dough and putting that handful of parm was salty and not impressive. the fresh basil, maybe. nothing about this pie impressed me. Remember I mentioned I saw the same kinds of pizza pie passed me? yeah, I think I'm able to tell the difference if DeMarco cared for our pie like he did others.Sorry, they lost a potentially good yelp review. and this is probably my longest. its a shame they have to run their business this way. Well, I always have had Gaby's Pizza on Hillside. Want superceded flavor AND service? get Gaby's in Queens Village. I would even refer to $1 pizza from TwoBros in Manhattan than DeMarco's pizza.",1.0
"there's something especially charming about these old establishments that are a throwback of old new york. Quick aside, if you really think about, I have these moments where I just sit in awe of the reality of the sheer number of great people that have walked these streets that we have walked - and even the ones who we never heard about - to me, it keeps me in a constant state of wonder.okay, so this leads me to di fara pizza. the same man making pizza for customers for decades. I just wonder how many people stepped through those doors over the years with a story to tell. Maybe they were regulars. Maybe they were the first customers to come before it became an absolute tourist trap for transients like me.... but no matter who you are, I think there is something magical about this place. an establishment where one man makes pizza the right way for his entire life day in and day out. In a city where change is the ethos of the day, sometimes its nice to have something consistent.It wasn't the best pizza I have ever had in NY, but it's right up there in the mix. the wait was about an hour - the only thing that sucks about this is that if you go on a saturday, the place is a ghost town, and there is literally nothing to do but go to the convenience store and god forbid, loiter with your friends.But you can tell the ingredients are fresh, and that there is something truly authentic in the craft and final product here. a quintessential nyc slice. just to clarify, when I say fresh, there is that extra ""it"" factor when it comes to the mixture of flavors that hit your taste buds and connect to those weird brain electrodes..... i should probably stop there - but the flavor of the basil, the salami that i like to imagine comes from the local butcher down the street who the old man has been friends with since childhood...ok i digress.Go here for the experience, for an authentic nyc slice, and a long ass wait ;) nyc baby!!!",4.0
"My original review disappeared... I don't know why.  Waited over 90 minutes middle of a Saturday  for what some say is THE best pizza.  It was good, don't get me wrong but not the best.  Too greasy -- too much olive oil for me.  But yes, very tasty and lots of flavorful sauce.Not worth a wait in my opinion.  But a very good NY slice to try.Amazing how Dom takes the pizza pans out of the oven with his bare hands!!",4.0
"There are pizzerias in every direction in New York, but the finest pizza may just be in Brooklyn. Lots of wonderful pizza, but only one Di Fara. Some people would prefer it this way, but few would disagree Midwood's greatest asset is a pizza lovers dream. It's far from perfect, but that's part of what makes their pies among the very best.Despite owning and operating Di Fara's for the better part of four decades, Dom DeMarco still churns out pies with his bare hands, carefully mastering his craft with each pizza, topping them off with a little olive oil and freshly snipped basil. He might be at times slow, but with a little patience and appreciation, a pie made by one of the pizza gods himself is a real treat.There are some issues at hand that many folks just can't seem to get over. Yes, it's far in Brooklyn. Midwood is no place to enjoy post-pizza festivities and coming 40 minutes outside of the city can be torture for those who have a hard time leaving 14th street. It's also cash only - at $5 a slice and practically $30+ for a pie, which makes this hardly budget pizza. They have odd hours, sometimes delaying their start time and will close for 3 days straight at a moment's notice. They rarely answer their phone  and a wait of 30-40 minutes is completely normal.But knowing those things ahead of time, makes it easy to avoid the pitfalls and nix the surprises. Bring lots of cash and bring a drink of choice (BYOB!). Split the pie with some friends or shoot for pizza on the go. Don't just show up and get a slice unless you live in the neighborhood and are just coming by for a casual slice. Those who do this are destined for instant disappointment - long subway rides for an expensive slice of pizza is a disaster in the making.And though I do love their regular slices, I think there is a better bang for your buck by going strictly sicilian. The hearty square slices, along with my favorite toppings of  sausage and pepperoni, three cheeses and fresh basil make for a helluva pizza. It's tasty, it's fresh, and for me, worth the wait. The old adage of ""good things come to those who wait"" has never been more true.When Dom decides to hang it up and enjoy the high life, it will be the end of an era. While I'm sure Dom Jr. (who is often seen helping out) is also a master in his own right, his father has established a pizza legacy that has put their family business on the map.

"OUR FAVORITE NY PIZZA!  This is easily pilgrimage pizza. There were people in there from Minnesota just for the pizza. I truly love to watch Dom DeMarco make the pies. I like to stand at the counter and just watch him work. A true artisan. He makes each one himself for 11 hours a day. He works nonstop creating each pie and has flour all over his shoes. His daughter was working at his side and even dealt with a heckler at the window with ease. Seriously, a pizza heckler?Anyway, to me there are two main types of pizza in NYC. First you have the type with the big bubbly crust, the fresh mozzarella, and basil...I guess it's the margherita pizza type. Second, would be what I call NY style pizza with the thin crust and tangy sauce which is duplicated mostly in every little town and city. Then you have Di Fara which to me is in a league all of its own and leaves them all behind. It is gooey, cheesy, tangy sauce with random chunks of tomato, the basil is fresh and yet not overpowering somehow. Quality ingredients, three types of cheese. I love how he drizzles olive oil before he puts it in the oven. We seriously love this place. Our favorite pizza. The pizza dreams are made of. The pizza that is ""last meal"" worthy.

"Pizza is almost always my last choice for lunch or dinner. Nevertheless, at the insistence of my wife, I went to experience what many have called the best neapolitan-style pizza on earth. High expectations lead to disappointment, right?I won't say that light shined down from Heaven on the slice I purchased, but I confess that it is the best pizza I've ever eaten. Not so much the cheese or the sauce or even the fresh basil (though these are obviously of the highest quality) but because of the crust.Oh, that crust. It has not left my mind. I do not know when it will leave my mind. Needless to say, as effortlessly as Mr. DeMarco creates such a succulent crust, I have to wonder: is he a genius, or is the rest of the pizza world just not getting it?Built into the pizza's value is the charm of Mr. DeMarco himself and his store. Yes, this is a real Italian immigrant working alone at his labor of love---slowly, carefully, and before everyone's eyes in a humble corner shop. He's spent fifty years perfecting his craft. Even the temperature of the water he uses in the dough depends on the weather.I have heard stories of two-hour lines. Our wait was twenty minutes on a Friday afternoon, a little past one o'clock. Admittedly, if I returned I'd try this same time again because my desire for pizza will probably never reach such pilgrimage status that a two hour wait is worth it.Despite the small crowd, the unaccomodating size of Di Fara Pizza meant that the tables were still filled, causing my wife and I to wander the neigborhood in search of a place to set our pizza on.

"After our first few bites, my friend Emilie straight out asked me, ""Well...how are you going to rate this on Yelp?"" with a slight *myeh* look on her face. (She knows me too well.)I sat at a table, looking at four seemingly plain slices of pizza, drooling from hunger but holding back tears over the fact that I was staring at $24 dollars worth of pizza. Over our table hung an article that stated why, at $4 per slice (with no attentional toppings), people were still flocking to Di Fara.Broken down (sadly, I had to get out my calculator to divide 4 into 24, and I'm sure my second grade teacher is spinning in her grave as we speak), we spent $6 a slice for a cheese pizza with garlic and onion....dude.Taste wise? An absolute delight. The crust? Watery, soggy, and barely able to hold its integrity. We just made it before the ""close for dinner"" lockdown. The door was locked behind us, with the workers letting us out in waves as each of us finished our ""ordered before 4 p.m."" pizza. Felt a little off to be at the mercy of the workers...haha...but when people that couldn't read the ""closed"" sign and tried to open the doors, it totally made sense. 'Twas a fun adventure down through Brooklyn, despite major issues with the Q train, and I'm glad to say I've been to Di Fara. However, do I see myself making a return trip? Honey...I live in Washington Heights. I don't go anywhere I don't have to. I have no reason to go from the comfort of Pinehurst Avenue to Avenue J in Brooklyn, and Di Fara isn't reason enough for me to make the venture.

"My in-laws live in the neighborhood, so I'm nearby more often than one might expect. With the weird hours, (closing for an hour in the middle of the day? OK!), and since I'm usually visiting for dinner anyway, I missed out on this place a few times. Finally we made it in the line, and then eventually through the door, and then eventually placed my order. There was no room to sit, so we took it to go.First impression: I thought it tasted very fresh. I loved watching them make the pizza right in front of me, down to cutting up the fresh basil over the top. I don't consider myself a pizza connoisseuse, but I could definitely tell it was better than the average slice at my local pizza place.

"You are DEFINITELY waiting 2 hours. I am stating the obvious here, but yeah, YOU ARE DEFINITELY WAITING 2 HOURS. I was the third person on line for the day, getting to the place at 11AM for a 1:30 opening time and still waited 2 hours and fifteen minutes. Only a few tables, and the place is tiny, so much of that time you will be waiting outside. The guy who makes the pizza is a sweet old guy who does everything by hand. I still haven't decided if that's part of the charm or if he is just trolling us. The pizza is very good. Solid crust from a old fashioned oven, perfect amount of sauce, and the Pecorino Romano is a great touch on the high quality mozz. What sets it apart is the tremendous toppings, which are among the best around. The garlic cherry tomatoes are an absolute must have, rivaled only for best NYC pizza topping by the handmade sausage at Louie and Ernie's. It's not perfect though, as everything is loaded with salt, with lots and lots of oil. No doubt DIFara makes a suburb pie, and its worth going too. Once. After that, its gets insane spending that much time waiting.  Again, the pizza is great, but in the same league as Patsy's and Grimaldis (original location).  You aren't waiting for 2 hours at either of those iconic joints. Bottom line, if you are a pizza geek like me, you have to try it. Sadly though, there's no way I can go back again. I mean, 2 hours for a slice of pizza? It brings to mind Soviet breadlines in the 1980's, where starving peasants would wait on line hours in the brutal Russian winter for a scrap of cooked dough. Replace  ""starving peasants"" with ""hipster bourgeois"", and put expensive cheese on the dough, and you have the idea. Add two stars if you like standing around doing nothing in the cold for a few hours or if you are a Russian peasant.",3.0

Over our table hung an article that stated why, at $4 per slice (with no attentional toppings), people were still flocking to Di Fara.Broken down (sadly, I had to get out my calculator to divide 4 into 24, and I'm sure my second grade teacher is spinning in her grave as we speak), we spent $6 a slice for a cheese pizza with garlic and onion....dude.Taste wise? An absolute delight. The crust? Watery, soggy, and barely able to hold its integrity. We just made it before the ""close for dinner"" lockdown. The door was locked behind us, with the workers letting us out in waves as each of us finished our ""ordered before 4 p.m."" pizza. Felt a little off to be at the mercy of the workers...haha...but when people that couldn't read the ""closed"" sign and tried to open the doors, it totally made sense. 'Twas a fun adventure down through Brooklyn, despite major issues with the Q train, and I'm glad to say I've been to Di Fara. However, do I see myself making a return trip? Honey...I live in Washington Heights. I don't go anywhere I don't have to. I have no reason to go from the comfort of Pinehurst Avenue to Avenue J in Brooklyn, and Di Fara isn't reason enough for me to make the venture. Good pizza, but I know where to find good pizza closer to my 'hood.",3.0
"My in-laws live in the neighborhood, so I'm nearby more often than one might expect. With the weird hours, (closing for an hour in the middle of the day? OK!), and since I'm usually visiting for dinner anyway, I missed out on this place a few times. Finally we made it in the line, and then eventually through the door, and then eventually placed my order. There was no room to sit, so we took it to go.First impression: I thought it tasted very fresh. I loved watching them make the pizza right in front of me, down to cutting up the fresh basil over the top. I don't consider myself a pizza connoisseuse, but I could definitely tell it was better than the average slice at my local pizza place. I hope they don't raise his rent anymore, so he sticks around!",4.0
"You are DEFINITELY waiting 2 hours. I am stating the obvious here, but yeah, YOU ARE DEFINITELY WAITING 2 HOURS. I was the third person on line for the day, getting to the place at 11AM for a 1:30 opening time and still waited 2 hours and fifteen minutes. Only a few tables, and the place is tiny, so much of that time you will be waiting outside. The guy who makes the pizza is a sweet old guy who does everything by hand. I still haven't decided if that's part of the charm or if he is just trolling us. The pizza is very good. Solid crust from a old fashioned oven, perfect amount of sauce, and the Pecorino Romano is a great touch on the high quality mozz. What sets it apart is the tremendous toppings, which are among the best around. The garlic cherry tomatoes are an absolute must have, rivaled only for best NYC pizza topping by the handmade sausage at Louie and Ernie's. It's not perfect though, as everything is loaded with salt, with lots and lots of oil. No doubt DIFara makes a suburb pie, and its worth going too. Once. After that, its gets insane spending that much time waiting.  Again, the pizza is great, but in the same league as Patsy's and Grimaldis (original location).  You aren't waiting for 2 hours at either of those iconic joints. Bottom line, if you are a pizza geek like me, you have to try it. Sadly though, there's no way I can go back again. I mean, 2 hours for a slice of pizza? It brings to mind Soviet breadlines in the 1980's, where starving peasants would wait on line hours in the brutal Russian winter for a scrap of cooked dough. Replace  ""starving peasants"" with ""hipster bourgeois"", and put expensive cheese on the dough, and you have the idea. Add two stars if you like standing around doing nothing in the cold for a few hours or if you are a Russian peasant.",3.0
"Just the best pizza on the planet.  The sauce is homemade.  Not too sweet, not too acidic.  Spiced to perfections, but not too much.  Fresh cheese, fresh dough, frsh basil, and all made to order.  Worth the long wait, and worth the price.  Di Fara is a Brooklyn institution, but it should not be forgotten that it is revered because the pizza is sublime!  If you want quick, disgusting pizza, go to Domino's -- I'll stick with Di Fara.",5.0

"Definitely one of the best pizzerias in New York. Their pizza is quite different from what you get at Grimaldi's or Lombardi's. Di Fara has a bit less tomato sauce, and the mozzarella cheese is not quite as good as Grimaldi's. But Dom really likes to go crazy with the olive oil and basil, which I enjoy a lot. The best way I would describe the difference is that Grimaldi's and Lombardi's are more hearty while Di Fara has a more sharp, flavorful taste. The way the flavors come together is better than any other pizza place I have ever been to.Some might balk at the prices. The price for a regular pie is $28, but remember that tax is included and no tip is expected (you pick up your pizza at a counter). So it's really more like $22 on a menu. I got a classic pie (sausage, mushrooms, onions, peppers) for $32, or $25 equivalent. Grimaldi's and Lombardi's large pizzas with four toppings would be $22 ($14 + $2 per topping) and $32.50 ($20.50 + $3 per topping), so the price isn't actually that bad.I would normally give this 4.5 stars, but I'm knocking off half a star for deficiencies in communication. In this day and age, everything is increasingly electronic, but sometimes you want a specific question answered in real time, so it is helpful for a business to have a working phone. Unfortunately, if you call them, there is a very good chance they will not pick up the phone. Their email address, info@difara.com, also does not work. I wanted to find out what day they were least busy, when was the latest I could show up and still be served, etc. In the end, at 6:30 PM on Wednesday I decided to make the 45-minute excursion from Manhattan to Brooklyn without any knowledge of whether I'd make it on time. Of course, when I got there, I got all the answers to my questions. For your benefit, I am sharing it here, because there is pretty much no other way for you to find out:1. The lady who works there on Wednesdays always tries to pick up the phone. She also works on some Fridays. If they do pick up the phone, you can place a phone order ahead of time to save some of the wait.2. The listed 8:30 PM closing time is the last time they will accept an order. So they might stay open until 10 PM (or whenever they finish making the pies) if necessary. However, there is a possibility they could run out of dough, so placing orders before 8 PM is recommended.3. There is essentially no line for ordering, though this is only reflective of this particular Wednesday night at 7:15 PM; your experiences may differ. You go up to the counter, place your order, and she writes it down on a legal pad.4. The main waiting time is for your pizza. During this time, you are free to wander around the area (and visit all the kosher shops), because your place in line is held on the pad.

I still don't get it. I just don't. People are like sheep I guess. I thought I would give this place another chance to figure out why anyone would want to pay $5.00 for a slice that is half the size than any normal slice. Two slices here is a light snack. Pizza purists and Zagats alike continue to call this the best pizza in NYC. It's good but not great. Reputation and longevity does not justify the price markup. I think the only competition this place has in the immediate area is a kosher pizza place. It was also pretty greasy for such a small slice. It's a thin crust that is very similar to the margarita slice at Artichoke's. I know two stars is pretty harsh but this pizza is just decent and doesn't live up to the accolades.

Little did we know, a 20 minute wait really means a 90 minute wait. So wait we did, drooling and starving while all the pizzas that were ordered before ours (VERY) slowly came out. And 90 minutes later, our pizza was ready. The two of us wolfed down the entire pie, with its thin and slightly crispy, slightly burnt crust, burn-your-mouth hot cheese (if you don't burn your mouth, you are not consuming your pizza properly), tangy tomato-ridden sauce, and fresh basil. Don't get me wrong, the pizza was definitely really good. But was it the best pizza I ever had? I'm not sure. If it was, it wasn't the best by a wide margin. And $30 for a pie/$5 a slice? I dunno, I've had great pizzas for half the price, and the difference in good-ness is negligible and certainly not double. So is it worth going once for the experience?

"Best pizza I've had.Was it worth the price?  You betcha.Was it worth a long wait to order and then another hour and a quarter (not the promised 45 minutes) for the pies?  Well, maybe if you're into the mystique.It was neat, though, to see Dom take a pie out of the oven, add pepperoni and put it back, so the pepperoni wouldn't be overcooked.  That's the kind of TLC his pizza gets, and you can taste it.What did make the wait worthwhile was using the time to find out that I could have come in during the afternoon, placed an order, and then come back at the appointed time to pick it up.  (I wouldn't count on not waiting, but it won't be as long.)That's what I'll do next time.  But this time was one of those experiences that get better as they fade into memory, the other folks on line were nice, and I am now a Di Fara veteran.And the pizza is the best.",5.0

"Pizza = 5 starsWhy the 4 star rating?1. No seating. Well there is, but it is a bunch of mismatched tables and chairs clumsily put together. Good luck finding a seat, too...

"After years of hearing all the rave reviews, we finally decided to check this place out and it really did live up to its hype! We ordered two regular slices and one square and were estimated a 35 minute wait time. The two regular slices were ready in five minutes (score!) and we scarfed it down while waiting another 20 minutes for the square. The crust was the perfect combination of crunchy and pillowy with just the right amount of sauce and cheese topped off with a sprinkle of fresh basil. The sauce is omg_worthy fresh and served at the right temperature, important so it doesn't burn your tongue! The square was ready as we finished our regulars and was just as delicious with a slightly thicker crust and basil_less! Would we return? Absolutely yes!!!!!",5.0

"Best pizza I've had.Was it worth the price?  You betcha.Was it worth a long wait to order and then another hour and a quarter (not the promised 45 minutes) for the pies?  Well, maybe if you're into the mystique.It was neat, though, to see Dom take a pie out of the oven, add pepperoni and put it back, so the pepperoni wouldn't be overcooked.  That's the kind of TLC his pizza gets, and you can taste it.What did make the wait worthwhile was using the time to find out that I could have come in during the afternoon, placed an order, and then come back at the appointed time to pick it up.  (I wouldn't count on not waiting, but it won't be as long.)That's what I'll do next time.  But this time was one of those experiences that get better as they fade into memory, the other folks on line were nice, and I am now a Di Fara veteran.And the pizza is the best.",5.0
"Come on a rainy Thursday night and there won't be a line, you'll be able to get your own table, and you won't feel rushed to finish your pizza.

I think our pie was $39 but I'm not too sure since we had every topping on the planet on it. Get the pie, skip the slices.

"There's a lot of hype surrounding this place. So I just had to witness for myself being kind of a self-professed pizza snob. So I took the Q train all the way down to Avenue J, AND NOT TO SEE CONEY ISLAND. JUST FOR THIS PIZZA. hopped off the subway, and found myself on Avenue J. And, but for a Game Stop and Walgreen's, this is the only establishment of note on this side of the subway! The ordering means is chaos. There's no set lines, you just move yourself to the counter, get your order placed. It's all made fresh to order. I ended up waiting 40 MINUTES for my two slices of regular w/ pepperoni. When the pizza comes out, Dom sprinkles it with parmigiano reggiano, fresh basil, and EVO. I think the pizza's very good, and rates a 4.5. Tomato sauce is very smooth, light (not chunky), very inoffensive, and fresh. The crust has just enough bite to make it crunchy, but also very foldable. Not quite the best NY slice I've ever had, but certainly rates very good. I'm personally not a fan of the extra parmigiano that goes on the slice. I think it's unnecessary, makes it a bit too salty, and might even cloud the otherwise subtle flavors of this pizza. Perhaps a true litmus test would be to just try the pizza as a 'virgin' before she's been deflowered. Pizza slice at $6 is rather small as well for what you pay. And, let's face it, walking through Avenue J to kill some time while you wait for your pizza is just like walking through a ghost town. Just about every store is locked up. Luckily, this place is right off the metro. While you're waiting, you can stare in the direction of the subway so that at least there's some illusion of civilization. Several customers in front of me had a pie that was just horribly burnt through 1/2 the pie. It's surprising how inconsistent these pizzas come out despite THE ONE CONSTANT: THERE IS ONLY ONE DOM MAKING THEM! After eating through half of the pizza, one of them wanted her money back. Which was kind of absurd... you just ate through half the fvcking slice, but the guy handling the cash register obliged. Good on him. So I guess I consider myself lucky to have two non-crispy slices. If you're a pizza connoisseur, I think it's worth checking this place. If you're not, you just may not understand what the big deal is. And, you'd be right. On the surface, there really isn't much that separates di Fara's from any other pizza shop in NYC. Overall: Would I come here again? Only if I had no place to be and all the time in the world. What? Who in NY has that kind of time?! Pizza is a 4.5. But, this place is just way too far a trek. If I have to wait 40 minutes for pizza, plus 40 minutes at least round-trip from Manhattan, it'd better be worth it. Honestly, as good as the pizza is, it didn't blow my mind. NOT WORTH THE WAIT, but because it is pretty darn good pizza... a solid 4 stars.",4.0
This place is good but it's not really worth to wait. It's so long wait and lit over priced. Usually pizza is burned little around I really don't like that.

I think the old man making the pizza is the best thing about this place. Just great how he gets the pies out of the oven with his bare hands and then cuts fresh basil over the pie with a scissors right after pouring fresh olive oil over it.

The place is tiny and it's $4 a slice, but so worth it. We each grabbed a plain margarita style slice, sauce, cheese, and basil.

"I consider myself to be a bit of a pizzaholic so Di Fara's has been on my ToDo list for years!  We got in line fifteen minutes before opening, a handful of pizza afficionados in front and back of us.  As the door opened, we shuffled inside, got our order in for a meatball pie and waited patiently on a shared table.  There was a bit of reverence in the air as Dominic worked his magic!  Moving in a measured, efficient fashion, he knocks out pies with the ease of a seasoned pizzaiolo.  A few lucky people got their slices early but we needed to wait for our custom order pizza.  In about 30 minutes, our name was called and my cousin trotted triumphantly back with our beautiful pie!  A bit burnt on one side, swimming with cheese and a bit of olive oil, the pie had a smattering of hand-cut basil and was baked to perfection.  I waited a bit for it to cool down which was pure torture!  The first bite was magical, you can taste the three cheeses that are used and the fresh basil on top.  The crust cracks a bit but holds its own with some chewiness, light and delicious.  The sauce pops out with bright, tomato flavor and the meatball was perfectly spiced.  Definitely some first-class, fresh ingredients here, you have to appreciate the details of a master at work.    Take em all together and you know you're eating a pie that is uniquely special and made with love.   What can I say, it was great pizza but hard to compare it to anything else since I haven't had anything else like it.  Better than Pepe's?  Hmmm.  Better than Totonnos and Lombardi's?  Probably.  Best pizza ever?!  Wow, that's a tough one but just maybe...  The only way I can find out is by sampling all the other great pies out there, in the US and Italy.  And that's a goal that I'll happily take on.  But for now, DiFara's is certainly at the top of the pizza pantheon for me!Update 12/19/09: Just went to Pepe's in New Haven last week and what can I say but Di Fara is still the pie to beat...",5.0

Tons of people love it so, you wont know until you try it! I myself have no desire to return.",3.0
"I consider myself to be a bit of a pizzaholic so Di Fara's has been on my ToDo list for years!  We got in line fifteen minutes before opening, a handful of pizza afficionados in front and back of us.  As the door opened, we shuffled inside, got our order in for a meatball pie and waited patiently on a shared table.  There was a bit of reverence in the air as Dominic worked his magic!  Moving in a measured, efficient fashion, he knocks out pies with the ease of a seasoned pizzaiolo.  A few lucky people got their slices early but we needed to wait for our custom order pizza.  In about 30 minutes, our name was called and my cousin trotted triumphantly back with our beautiful pie!  A bit burnt on one side, swimming with cheese and a bit of olive oil, the pie had a smattering of hand-cut basil and was baked to perfection.  I waited a bit for it to cool down which was pure torture!  The first bite was magical, you can taste the three cheeses that are used and the fresh basil on top.  The crust cracks a bit but holds its own with some chewiness, light and delicious.  The sauce pops out with bright, tomato flavor and the meatball was perfectly spiced.  Definitely some first-class, fresh ingredients here, you have to appreciate the details of a master at work.    Take em all together and you know you're eating a pie that is uniquely special and made with love.   What can I say, it was great pizza but hard to compare it to anything else since I haven't had anything else like it.  Better than Pepe's?  Hmmm.  Better than Totonnos and Lombardi's?  Probably.  Best pizza ever?!  Wow, that's a tough one but just maybe...  The only way I can find out is by sampling all the other great pies out there, in the US and Italy.  And that's a goal that I'll happily take on.  But for now, DiFara's is certainly at the top of the pizza pantheon for me!Update 12/19/09: Just went to Pepe's in New Haven last week and what can I say but Di Fara is still the pie to beat...",5.0

"I have had every kind of pizza imaginable. I have had horrible convenient lunchtime Korean-owned Italian restaurant pizza, I have had regrettable slices that were purchased in a drunken haze, I have had forgettable slices of I-don't-even-recall-what-was-on-it pizza, and I have had some incredibly tasty addiction-inducing pizzas. Above all, regardless of how shitty or great the pizza is, I always eat my pizza with meat on it. In fact, I only eat pizza with meat on it. Lo and behold, on my first trip to New York, my boyfriend orders me two slices of the regular Di Fara signature pie with cheese and basil sprinkled on top. This was a napkin-twisting moment for me. Pizza with no meat? GETOUTTAHERE. FORGETABOUTIT. PEPPERONIFORLIFE. We waited in a small line outside the shop before it opened. Once in, the ordering process was quick. Five slices came to us, just like that. The slices are visually unremarkable. They just look like your average pizza. Maybe this is why a disgruntled man bitched about having to pay $5 for the slice. Then he ate it and immediately STFU. The crust is subtly salted and perfectly crisp on the edge, chewy in the middle. The sauce is thick and savory, with chunks of sweet and mellow Roma tomatoes. The cheese has a bite to the creaminess that envelops the bits of basil sprinkled on top. The entire slice is drizzled with olive oil. All of these things combined made me forget all about my fascination with pizza meat. This here is truly a slice of heaven.",5.0
If you're going to di fara pizza then you have to expect to wait. There's always a line but the pizza is so worth it. The slices are quite expensive compared to your average pizzeria but keep in mind this is not your average pizzeria. It's worth trying at least once. You'll love the fresh basil and olive oil that they top it with! Also the staff are very nice and friendly. they are also very generous. when i asked for parmesan cheese she gave it to me in a huge cup. i really appreciate that.,4.0
"As if this place needs a review. I'm also way overdue in finishing this review. Dominic the original maestro is a true dedicated genius of pizza. I'd definitely get the artichoke topping when it's available but you must also get regular cheese only to appreciate the magnificent flavors Dominic creates from dough, sauce, cheeses and anything else he tops it with e.g. olive oil, fresh basil, or that great oregano he buys. Fresh artichoke hearts sautéed in olive oil how could that be bad?  Also while I usually prefer the Neapolitan style he makes the best Sicilian pizza which is not too thick.  I get both. Also just relax it's a true hole in the wall and hot at that, but it's so worth the wait. Think about the end product and give him a break if the pizza is not perfectly round or cut equally...the tastes are beyond compare. The pizza gods have blessed this man.",5.0
"Oh I love Di Fara's.  And I know the pies aren't 100% perfect.  You've probably read and seen that sometimes the crust can come out burnt.  But the TLC that goes into creating each pie and the freshness/seasonings of the ingredients is something to crave.Everybody loves Grimaldi's but I've been there twice and felt that the pepperonis were tasty but they had to carry the weight of most of the moderately bland pizza.  Now Di Fara's doesn't have as nice of a seating area.  In fact, some of the tables are wobbly and the smoke made my eyes tear up to the point that I just had to stand outside by myself.  It's a bustling area so you need not be afraid.You all know by now that only 1 adorable man makes the pizza and one at a time.  On a Thursday night, there were only 5-6 orders ahead of mine but I waited a good 40 minutes for the Di Fara Special Pie ($32).  This has as lot of stuff on it and can make your slice floppy at times so I'd go with something simple to start off with.  He'll top every pie with fresh basil no matter what.And another small detail: I like that they don't overcharge people for sodas.  You can get 3 drinks for $2.  They close at 9pm but if you've already ordered, they'll let you eat there until after closing.",5.0

My brother and I ordered a round pie to go. I got a square slice while we were waiting. The square slice was average at best, totally disappointing. After about 45 minutes waiting, they tried to give my brother a burnt pie. In typical NYer fashion he said, that pie is burnt I don't want it.  We had to wait a few extra minutes but they obliged and gave him the next pie and gave the burnt pie to some poor shmucks. I will admit the pizza itself was delicious. Was it worth $5 a slice or the wait? Absolutely not! I've had better pizza locally all over NY (especially New Park in Queens). Being a foodie, I'm happy I tried it, but I would never eat here again. IF it were cheaper and didn't have ridiculous lines, I would probably eat here all the time.",2.0

Pizzas pretty good here but I wouldn't call it the best in Brooklyn. It's always packed in there; especially between the hours of eleven to two so the wait is usually more than ten minutes. Plus they're super expensive(which I guess is like every standard pizzeria nowadays).

"At first glance, this pizzeria is unassuming and without any flashy signs of excellence.  The storefront is unflinchingly dingy that you'd walk right by without even realizing that Di Fara's has consistently been dubbed a ""pizza heaven"" for years on-end by various food mags, and that Yelpers adore this place.  Now, I don't mind dingy; if a place can churn out spectacular food while appearing completely unassuming, that's the golden ticket, I go bonkers for that sort of thing.  But DiFara's, for all it's supposed modesty, is actually slightly pretentious.3.5 stars.These are my gripes:1)  The atmosphere feels like a post-apocalyptic doomsday scenario, Cormac McCarthy's ""The Road"" style.  I mean, people are trying their hardest to elbow their way to a table and vie for seats that are scare in supply and ridiculous in demand.  Case in point:We saw a pregnant woman rubbing her belly in discomfort as she stood there looking into the faces of the many seated diners who didn't care about her or her unborn child.  Yes, she may have voluntarily placed herself in that position because she wanted DiFara's pizza and nothing else would suffice, but common courtesy should look past that and someone should have given up a seat for her.  It was nice that my boyfriend eventually got up to give her some relief until a table opened up to her and her bun, and hubby.  This is not the type of mood I want to be in while enjoying a pizza.  The weight of all the pairs of eyes looking upon you as you eat, almost burns a hole into your body.  It seems people are mentally counting the slices of pizza you have on your plate until you are done and ready to go, so that they can strategize the best way to nab your free table.  We did the same.  It places pressure on you to rush through your meal so others can sit.  Stressful.  It only took 3 seconds before some lady scooped up my chair as I got up to leave.  No matter how tasty that pizza, how great the crust,  this left a bitter taste in my mouth.  Here was great pizza being marred by a hostile environment. *2) It's expensive.  Maybe these ingredients are rare, pure, organic, virginal, local, or perhaps imported from Italy, but $5.00 for a slice makes one's head scratch.  I've never seen such high prices for pizza.  We decided to get a plain cheese pie, with olives on one half of the pie.  This was a whopping $29!  I'm wondering what the profit margin looks like here.  It amused me that as we left, they posted a signed on the door that said they were out of dough.  I had to say to myself, ""I get it, they mean pizza dough, and not dough as in the casual, slang way of saying money, because that, they are certainly rolling in.""  And, my can of diet sierra mist cost $2.00.  Whatever argument that is used to justify the expensive pizza cannot be applied to this hefty pricetag on a can of soda.  No one can argue this.  3) The wait time is a good one hour and some change.  The fact that it was my first go at DiFara's helped my patience level because it gave me the opportunity to observe the way the world works in DiFara's universe.  The flow of people, the vying for tables, the making of great pizza, the taking down of orders on a, yellow legal-sized pad.. this was all entertaining to watch.  But at the 45-minute mark, I started to get hungry, and I was also sad for the pregnant woman, that my amusement slowly turned to annoyance.  If you sit there for an hour, eating your pizza, savoring each slice and enjoying the company you are with, that is understandable, but if you have to kill an hour just standing around and waiting for your pizza before you can even eat it, it's really not an ideal situation.  Maybe we went during an extremely busy time (Sunday, early afternoon), but then again, for all the hype driving this business, I don't think there's ever any quiet time.  The pizza chef mastermind, Dominic, looks like a very sweet man.  He works diligently and in quiet confidence like a man that knows his trade inside-and-out.  It's a glorious process of pizza craftsmanship to witness his expert hands form a gorgeous pizza.  He is due this praise.  But maybe someone should implore him to pay a little attention to the swarms of customers that would like to eat in some peace and comfort.  Maybe, wipe down those grease-stained beer pong picnic tables every once in a while?  Perhaps ask the patrons to respect each other and not mimic the dealings of a vulture the second a table becomes available.  Without question DiFara's pizza is fantastic, but fantastic can be had elsewhere without such stress.  (Paule Gee's is my fave!)__* Hostile except for the few kind souls that told us we didn't have to get anything fancy as our first time.. that a plain cheese pizza would prove their greatness.  Also, the nice lady that offered use some rugala from the bakery across the street as we waited in line for our pie.",3.0

"It is not hype. This really was the best pizza I ever ate. My husband agrees and he and I are really picky.

"Is it the olive oil?  The tender morsels of tomato?  The hits of freshly cut basil?  Hard to say what makes the pizza here so great (personally, I think it's the olive oil), but it's a great slice nonetheless and certainly worth the trek and wait.I would say that it tops many other well heralded pie shops (sorry, Grimaldi's), but it certainly does not best other favorites I've had in the past (helloooo, Fornino).And although I may be treading on heresy by saying that there may actually BE too much of a good thing, including a Di Fara's pie, I think that an entire pie for 2 people may seem like a good idea at first, but the drive to maximize value and indulgence may take its toll on even the most ardent pizza lover (you know who you are!).Definitely looking to make a second trip, as rumblings around the shop from regulars was that the square pie is another experience not to be missed!",4.0

Regular pizzeria's use garbage ingredients, part-skim mozzarella, NO oil of any kind, NO Romano cheese and horrible tomato sauce. This place doesn't do anything great, it's just that all the others are getting worse and worse.SO, I would give the pizza THREE stars, but the price, ONE star, so there you have it.Also, the place is NOT the cleanest place in town.

"Well I'm going to risk the wrath of the Pizza Gods for perhaps being blasphemous here, but I simply thought it was pretty decent.  Certainly above average, but for me it didn't raise the bar nor merit a rating of best in all of NYC.I like there's a trek involved, the dive-like corner store (that's it?) and the patriarch assembling each pie one at a time.  Love that they have a bowl of chili-infused oil, and that papa cuts basil with scissors and pours olive oil over the finished pie.  But I was simply only semi-charmed by the taste.I've been trying to put my finger on it and this is what I've concluded:  Some have said it's food like grandma would have made.  And that's just it.  To me, the pizza I had tasted like it was home made.  The sauce and cheese were decent, but not wow.  The ingredients pretty simple, again not wow or pow.  The dough was solid in its holding value, but end crusts had a bit of a undercooked flour taste, and not pillowy (which merits its own debate).  Meanwhile it was a tad charred, which is fine, but it was charred by a very long oven time, as you might get at home with a 400 degree oven that doesn't quite get hot enough (even with a pizza stone) versus the blister-hot coal/wood fired ovens that cook a pizza in 1 or 2 minutes.  Ultimately it comes down to personal taste.  I'd love to try this pie from a 1,200 degree oven.But do go and try.  Half the fun of food is exploring, so see if it fist your tastes.  It definitely has character and is unique to NY.  As for being the best?  Well only you can decide.",3.0

"As with any experience at a famous eatery, one must not be overly influenced by the brand power. One must speak truth to pizza.I went to DiFara's a second time, because I really wasn't satisfied with my first trip. This time, I would show up when the place opened, order my own pizza so as to have it fresh, and not sit around waiting an hour for it only to be disappointed by all the hype. And I would bring a friend from Sweden, since it qualifies as a mini city adventure.Well, we arrived at 12pm, opening time (on a freezing cold day), and still ended up waiting about an hour. There weren't so many people in front of us, but Dom just makes those pies one... at... a... time. So waiting is probably in the cards for you no matter how well you plan your visit. Luckily, we snagged one of the four tables early.When our pizza finally arrived amidst the usual rituals, it was steaming hot, boilingly expensive, and large enough that my friend and I doubted seriously that we could finish it. In fact, we did, and it was an extremely satisfying, easy to eat meal. If I were to say anything more specific, it would be that the flavors were extremely well-balanced. I complained about the saltiness last time, but it didn't bother me as much this time. And the generous fresh basil is a really nice touch.That all probably doesn't make for a compelling-sounding review, but perhaps we Yelpers (Americans?) have too much of a tendency to spew superlatives all over every experience that is simply just good. The pizza is definitely above average, but I have to repeat my misgivings about it being worth the long trip and the long, uncomfortable wait. Up to you, pizza fans. As typical New York pizza, it probably is the very best. Compared to trendy places like Keste or Motorino, it may not be so distinguishable, but that may not be a fair or reasonable comparison.If you do go, ask to use the restroom. The back of the restaurant, where the ingredients are prepped, is actually pretty interesting to look at. Just be nice to the owners. They're all lovely people, but they're also human beings running a family-operated, New York institution that handles larger capacity crowds than most upscale, corporate-sponsored operations downtown. Be nice to them, and they'll be nice to you. Amazingly, they're even polite about letting you take photos. I can't believe they're opening a branch in Vegas. Are they going to clone old Dom and then teach the clone how to go through all those deeply embodied pizza making motions?Previous review plus this review = 3.5 stars average",4.0
"I almost wish I'd have paid twice as much for my cheese slices, so I wouldn't have eaten them as quickly.

Definitely the best pizza by the slice I've ever had.",5.0
"Despite the notoriety Di Fara has received for failing health inspections, nothing was going to stop us from eating one of the world renowned pies served up by the hands of Dom DeMarco. Especially after a prior trek to Midwood to consume one of his pies, only to discover the pizzaiolo was on vacation. On that occasion, we weren't going to go home empty-bellied, and hopped right back on the Q train to try Totonno's. This time we were in luck.Upon entering, we observed Dom behind the counter, kneading the dough into perfection, completely oblivious to the growing crowds, his mind completely intent on serving up one of his signature pizzas. For each pie, he painstakingly shreds the fresh mozzarella and distributes it evenly across the pie. Once out of the oven, he tops it with some fresh basil, which I am confident has not been washed, but that just adds a little bit of flavor. For a finishing touch, he drizzles the pizza with olive oil and sprinkles on some grana padana cheese.On a Sunday afternoon, the line didn't appear to be too long. Within a minute or two, we placed our order for a large round pie. The man taking orders informed us the pie would be ready in about an hour. An hour later, our pie was finally ready. Less than 5 minutes later, the pie had been completely consumed. The crust was top notch, thin crust and crispy, almost to the point of being burned but not quite. Very solid ratio of sauce to cheese, with the canned San Marzano tomatoes counterbalancing the sweetness of the sauce with a touch of acidity.Definitely worth the wait. Ignore the minimalist decor of the restaurant and focus on the pizza itself. You will be more than satisfied. Keep up the good work Dom!",4.0
"Oh. My. God. Oh my god. Oh my god. Ohmygod ohmygod ohmygodohmygodohmygod. This is the best pizza I've eaten in my life. Today was my second time at Di Fara and it was every bit as delicious as I remembered it. When I talk about Di Fara and my eyes get really big, people ask me how I can get so excited about it. ""It's just pizza, right?"" Yes, and that's precisely what makes it so great.Unlike pizza shops like Artichoke and Co., which offer pies that are recognizable as pizza only in the aesthetic sense (not saying it's bad, just not traditional), and even Grimaldi's, whose fare is very much pizza but a little self-conscious with its strategic sauce placement, Di Fara serves up plain old pizza. If you don't believe me, look at the pictures. Do you see that pie? Outside of the fresh basil it's almost exactly like any regular pie, nothing fancy, no gimmicks. However, it's the most delicious pizza ever.I don't give out five stars lightly (this is my second, and as of right now I can only think of two other places that I'd award this rating), but Dom DeMarco has earned it through offering sublime perfection from top to bottom.Actually, let's do this bottom to top. The crust at Di Fara is wonderful on its own: thinner than normal but not too thin, foldable and not brittle, and it possesses just the right pinch of salt and that slightly oven-charred flavor that, since you will almost certainly be eating it straight out of the oven, irresistibly wafts toward your nostrils. It's so good that it's almost a crime to not finish it along with the rest of the pizza. If you have perpetrated this by mistake, I would strongly urge you to reconsider the error of your ways.Next up is one of my favorite food groups: sauce! The tomato sauce on this pizza is everything you could ever want and more; it's sweet and flavorful, has the right hit of acidity, and Dom manages to cover the pie with it pretty well. In addition, the sauce contains pieces of diced tomato, which add a really nice texture to the pizza - a touch that you don't see too often.Di Fara uses three different cheeses in its pies. These are thickly sliced slabs of buffala mozzarella, shredded regular mozzarella, and finely grated grana padano. When Dom assembles his pizza, you'll see him cover the sauce with the mozzarellas, but he holds off on dusting the pizza with the grana padano until after the pie is done baking. Grana padano is related to parmigiano reggiano and has a really good nutty flavor that helps make this pizza distinctive.For most pizzas the review would wrap up at this point, with the cheese, but Di Fara doesn't stop there. After Dom dusts the pie with the final cheese, he drizzles olive oil over the pie, then takes a bunch of fresh basil leaves and a pair of scissors and cuts the basil over the pizza (I think something on the order of almost half of the Yelp pictures show Dom performing this ritual). To sum up: you have a perfect crust, a delicious sauce that has pieces of tomato in it, three different cheese, one that has a little edge to it, and aromatic fresh basil all rolled into one pie. Di Fara also has the perfect proportions. With each bite you can savor all of these ingredients and no one of them overpowers another or gets lost in the mix. When you taste it you'll understand: this is what pizza is meant to be. It can be a little messy to eat with the threads of cheese stretching for over a foot as you extricate one slice from a pie or the pieces of tomato rolling down your chin and hands as you quickly use evasive maneuvers to avoid losing any part of heaven, so ready your napkins before you start.At $28 a pie you could certainly go cheaper, but without a shadow of a doubt you'll also go lower quality. Half a pie is usually more than enough food, so $14 a person isn't too bad, especially when it's the best pizza ever. When you consider that each slice costs $5, the pie - 8 slices - is the way to go. The one thing that bears mention is the wait. After you order be prepared to spend 40 minutes to an hour for your pizza to come out. This is partially because Dom expends a lot of attention and care on each and every pie that goes into his oven, but also because, at 645 reviews and counting, the cat's been out of the bag for a long time now, and the tiny shop is always filled to the brim (good luck getting a seat!). It might even take you 15 minutes to place your order. Because I know what I'm getting into, and it's the best pizza ever, I don't mind too much, but don't expect to double park outside and run back with a slice. Tomorrow I may go to some random pizza shop and be fine with my pizza, but I know that nothing can compare to this place. If I lived nearby I would eat this pizza every single day. It's the best. As I was saying, ohmygodohmygodohmygod. It's so good.For the uninitiated and fans alike, you should check out ""The Best Thing I Ever Done"", an ode to Di Fara - vimeo.com/16077855",5.0
"Delicious pizza. Let's just say, for the five star experience, you need to do a bit of planning.1. Drive, if you can, because seating inside is very limited and there aren't any parks or benches around. If the weather is bad, at least you can enjoy the pizza in your car. You may have to do that anyway, since parking is very difficult in the neighborhood.2. Don't go to Di Fara hungry. You will wait at least an hour, possibly over 2. I have a vague memory of someone once telling me you could call ahead- I've never done that, so don't bet your life on it. If you go during non-sabbath times, you can get some standard poppy seed hamantaschen from the Jewish bakery across the street for a little appetizer. You can also peruse the dollar store while you wait. 3. Try to time your hunger so that when you do eventually get your pizza, you can eat a lot of it. It is so effing delicious. I always order a whole pie (or several depending on how many I'm dining with). One pie is good for two people who've been waiting a year for this pizza.  I never get toppings because I'm like that, but one time I saw a single guy order the special pizza, a sicilian with a bunch of tasty looking toppings, and I was ggggrrrreeeeennnn. So maybe one day, I will order the special. I have never ordered by the slice.",5.0
"I think it's the best slice in the city.  I actually prefer the regular, plain slice.  The Di Fara special is very good, but I think the plain slice with the fresh basil and olive oil is terrific.  I think it's fresh mozzarella paired with grated parmesan.  It's fantastic.  Been twice and haven't waited in line.  It takes a bit to get the food because everything is cooked fresh.",5.0

Despite all that, the pizza is divine. Fresh cheese, sauce, basil and drizzled with olive oil.

Especially after a prior trek to Midwood to consume one of his pies, only to discover the pizzaiolo was on vacation. On that occasion, we weren't going to go home empty-bellied, and hopped right back on the Q train to try Totonno's. This time we were in luck.Upon entering, we observed Dom behind the counter, kneading the dough into perfection, completely oblivious to the growing crowds, his mind completely intent on serving up one of his signature pizzas. For each pie, he painstakingly shreds the fresh mozzarella and distributes it evenly across the pie. Once out of the oven, he tops it with some fresh basil, which I am confident has not been washed, but that just adds a little bit of flavor. For a finishing touch, he drizzles the pizza with olive oil and sprinkles on some grana padana cheese.On a Sunday afternoon, the line didn't appear to be too long. Within a minute or two, we placed our order for a large round pie. The man taking orders informed us the pie would be ready in about an hour. An hour later, our pie was finally ready. Less than 5 minutes later, the pie had been completely consumed. The crust was top notch, thin crust and crispy, almost to the point of being burned but not quite. Very solid ratio of sauce to cheese, with the canned San Marzano tomatoes counterbalancing the sweetness of the sauce with a touch of acidity.Definitely worth the wait. Ignore the minimalist decor of the restaurant and focus on the pizza itself. You will be more than satisfied. Keep up the good work Dom!",4.0
"Oh. My. God. Oh my god. Oh my god. Ohmygod ohmygod ohmygodohmygodohmygod. This is the best pizza I've eaten in my life. Today was my second time at Di Fara and it was every bit as delicious as I remembered it. When I talk about Di Fara and my eyes get really big, people ask me how I can get so excited about it. ""It's just pizza, right?"" Yes, and that's precisely what makes it so great.Unlike pizza shops like Artichoke and Co., which offer pies that are recognizable as pizza only in the aesthetic sense (not saying it's bad, just not traditional), and even Grimaldi's, whose fare is very much pizza but a little self-conscious with its strategic sauce placement, Di Fara serves up plain old pizza. If you don't believe me, look at the pictures. Do you see that pie? Outside of the fresh basil it's almost exactly like any regular pie, nothing fancy, no gimmicks. However, it's the most delicious pizza ever.I don't give out five stars lightly (this is my second, and as of right now I can only think of two other places that I'd award this rating), but Dom DeMarco has earned it through offering sublime perfection from top to bottom.Actually, let's do this bottom to top. The crust at Di Fara is wonderful on its own: thinner than normal but not too thin, foldable and not brittle, and it possesses just the right pinch of salt and that slightly oven-charred flavor that, since you will almost certainly be eating it straight out of the oven, irresistibly wafts toward your nostrils. It's so good that it's almost a crime to not finish it along with the rest of the pizza. If you have perpetrated this by mistake, I would strongly urge you to reconsider the error of your ways.Next up is one of my favorite food groups: sauce! The tomato sauce on this pizza is everything you could ever want and more; it's sweet and flavorful, has the right hit of acidity, and Dom manages to cover the pie with it pretty well. In addition, the sauce contains pieces of diced tomato, which add a really nice texture to the pizza - a touch that you don't see too often.Di Fara uses three different cheeses in its pies. These are thickly sliced slabs of buffala mozzarella, shredded regular mozzarella, and finely grated grana padano. When Dom assembles his pizza, you'll see him cover the sauce with the mozzarellas, but he holds off on dusting the pizza with the grana padano until after the pie is done baking. Grana padano is related to parmigiano reggiano and has a really good nutty flavor that helps make this pizza distinctive.For most pizzas the review would wrap up at this point, with the cheese, but Di Fara doesn't stop there. After Dom dusts the pie with the final cheese, he drizzles olive oil over the pie, then takes a bunch of fresh basil leaves and a pair of scissors and cuts the basil over the pizza (I think something on the order of almost half of the Yelp pictures show Dom performing this ritual). To sum up: you have a perfect crust, a delicious sauce that has pieces of tomato in it, three different cheese, one that has a little edge to it, and aromatic fresh basil all rolled into one pie. Di Fara also has the perfect proportions. With each bite you can savor all of these ingredients and no one of them overpowers another or gets lost in the mix. When you taste it you'll understand: this is what pizza is meant to be. It can be a little messy to eat with the threads of cheese stretching for over a foot as you extricate one slice from a pie or the pieces of tomato rolling down your chin and hands as you quickly use evasive maneuvers to avoid losing any part of heaven, so ready your napkins before you start.At $28 a pie you could certainly go cheaper, but without a shadow of a doubt you'll also go lower quality. Half a pie is usually more than enough food, so $14 a person isn't too bad, especially when it's the best pizza ever. When you consider that each slice costs $5, the pie - 8 slices - is the way to go. The one thing that bears mention is the wait. After you order be prepared to spend 40 minutes to an hour for your pizza to come out. This is partially because Dom expends a lot of attention and care on each and every pie that goes into his oven, but also because, at 645 reviews and counting, the cat's been out of the bag for a long time now, and the tiny shop is always filled to the brim (good luck getting a seat!). It might even take you 15 minutes to place your order. Because I know what I'm getting into, and it's the best pizza ever, I don't mind too much, but don't expect to double park outside and run back with a slice. Tomorrow I may go to some random pizza shop and be fine with my pizza, but I know that nothing can compare to this place. If I lived nearby I would eat this pizza every single day. It's the best. As I was saying, ohmygodohmygodohmygod. It's so good.For the uninitiated and fans alike, you should check out ""The Best Thing I Ever Done"", an ode to Di Fara - vimeo.com/16077855",5.0
"Delicious pizza. Let's just say, for the five star experience, you need to do a bit of planning.1. Drive, if you can, because seating inside is very limited and there aren't any parks or benches around. If the weather is bad, at least you can enjoy the pizza in your car. You may have to do that anyway, since parking is very difficult in the neighborhood.2. Don't go to Di Fara hungry. You will wait at least an hour, possibly over 2. I have a vague memory of someone once telling me you could call ahead- I've never done that, so don't bet your life on it. If you go during non-sabbath times, you can get some standard poppy seed hamantaschen from the Jewish bakery across the street for a little appetizer. You can also peruse the dollar store while you wait. 3. Try to time your hunger so that when you do eventually get your pizza, you can eat a lot of it. It is so effing delicious. I always order a whole pie (or several depending on how many I'm dining with). One pie is good for two people who've been waiting a year for this pizza.  I never get toppings because I'm like that, but one time I saw a single guy order the special pizza, a sicilian with a bunch of tasty looking toppings, and I was ggggrrrreeeeennnn. So maybe one day, I will order the special. I have never ordered by the slice.",5.0
"I think it's the best slice in the city.  I actually prefer the regular, plain slice.  The Di Fara special is very good, but I think the plain slice with the fresh basil and olive oil is terrific.  I think it's fresh mozzarella paired with grated parmesan.  It's fantastic.  Been twice and haven't waited in line.  It takes a bit to get the food because everything is cooked fresh.",5.0
"Yes, the wait for a slice of pizza can be up to 1-2 hours.Yes, the price for a slice of pizza is astronomical. Yes, the place is absolutely filthy and has been closed down by the health department a bunch of times. Yes, the owner is a bit obnoxious and will not hurry up for anyone. Despite all that, the pizza is divine. Fresh cheese, sauce, basil and drizzled with olive oil. (I will admit that sometimes it is a bit too greasy)I am not in a rush to go back only because I can't bear to wait that long. However, it is worth it at least once in your lifetime!",4.0
If it had a better ambiance it would easily be a 5 star; great pizza,4.0

"5 stars means a place should be (one of) the best of the best in its category. Far too frequently, I find Yelpers overly generous with their ratings; for the record, this is my second 5 star review (and I think I'm going to downgrade my other 5 star review)!Having read all the press and hype about Di Fara, my expectations were raised to super high levels. I prepared myself for disappointment - after all, how can any restaurant live up to this much anticipation? The wait was as hideous as advertised; my friends and I were third in line (before opening) Sunday afternoon, and it still took over an hour to get our pizza!Tons of restaurants talk about ""beauty in simplicity"" and letting ""ingredients talk for themselves"" - precious few manage to execute that well. Di Fara was a mind-blowing experience for me; up until that point, I never realized pizza could be that good!I've had pizzas with traditional, top-notch, imported produce and all that jazz... but none of them come close to the magic of Di Fara! I wish I could pinpoint what made this pizza so great - the fresh cheese, basil, dough, or generous pour (this isn't diet food, folks) of olive oil - but I'll leave that to the folks with the better palette. All I know is: it works, and works great!Back to the point of simple ingredients: I enjoyed the plain Sicilian (square pizza with thicker crust) much more than the Sicilian with sausage.

"I've tried to eat at Di Fara before but I was deterred by the crowd out the door. Today I actually got into the store. I had expected to wait long, but there's no peace in the waiting: ""Excuse me, please move so I can get to the trash... the drinks... the bottle recycle... blah blah."" I got to watch the old man's pizza-making technique from many vantage points. I felt like a sports cameraman.Smoke lingered in the air and tinged the ceiling and award-studded walls.

The floor was worn to embarrassment, and the crease where it met the wall was grimy. Dom does cook with his bare hands, and he snips the gorgeous aromatic basil with a scissor that isn't the kind you can dissemble to wash. How did Di Fara get an A rating? Well I imagine it might have something to do with the patronage. The table next to mine was occupied by a certain kind of 'businessman.'Hmm... $5/slice vs. $3.50/slice for a whole pie... that's a no-brainer. My friend and I got a pie, to go. But then, amazingly, someone got up so we lucked out on a table. The pizza didn't take as long as I thought, and was very tasty. The flavors of each high-quality ingredient stood out individually to me, but they also blended perfectly together, like instruments in an orchestra. The basil was exquisite. The tomatoes were bursting with juicy flavor. I loved the olive oil. (One of my favorite things is to dip semolina bread in seasoned olive oil.) There's one flaw: SALT. One of the cheeses is just too too salty. Hours later I still had an unquenchable thirst. And my eyes were irritated and dry for hours from the smoke.

"9.4 / 10The journey to this pizza parlor is truly memorable. You make your way to lower-mid Brooklyn, and find it on a simple neighborhood corner. The line does not appear long, but you will probably be waiting over an hour for a fresh pie. A single man perfects each pizza himself, as he a done for several decades. Places like these are truly special. The smells and sights that come from the open counter area is tortuous during the wait. However, make some friends in the meantime, as the locals are friendly and like to chat. Your finished pie comes out finished with freshly cut basil leaves and whatever ingredients you choose. Do select whatever toppings you prefer, there is no wrong choice. The finished pizza is worth the wait, as you will likely be unable to last long enough before taking a bite, and sitting on the sidewalk to finish, hopefully with new friends.Score is based on overall experience, considering food, comfort, and lasting impression.",5.0

It's true what they say, Italians taught the world how to eat...and like all Italians who do it right, it's all about ingredients.

And it was like $5. These two facts run against the basic principles surrounding a great slice - it's fast and cheap. DiFara's was neither. Next time, I will skip the hype and go to PizzaMaster, my corner pizzaria which served me oh so well during high school. Now, I don't want to mar DiFara's slice, but I think nostalgia has a lot to do with how we view food. So while they have what has been called, objectively, Great pizza, I would still prefer my crappy corner pizzeria pizza hands down. Don't hate me.",3.0
"9.4 / 10The journey to this pizza parlor is truly memorable. You make your way to lower-mid Brooklyn, and find it on a simple neighborhood corner. The line does not appear long, but you will probably be waiting over an hour for a fresh pie. A single man perfects each pizza himself, as he a done for several decades. Places like these are truly special. The smells and sights that come from the open counter area is tortuous during the wait. However, make some friends in the meantime, as the locals are friendly and like to chat. Your finished pie comes out finished with freshly cut basil leaves and whatever ingredients you choose. Do select whatever toppings you prefer, there is no wrong choice. The finished pizza is worth the wait, as you will likely be unable to last long enough before taking a bite, and sitting on the sidewalk to finish, hopefully with new friends.Score is based on overall experience, considering food, comfort, and lasting impression.",5.0
"This isn't your everyday pizza, this is special pizza like birthday pizza or people in from out of town pizza, because you just can't eat this pizza all the time for $30 a pop and still pay your rent. Limit to special occasions or you'll wind up thinking that you can go around spending that kind of cheddar on mozzarella on a regular Wednesday and the next thing you know it's back to Ohio for you, so just be careful, is all I'm saying... homemade filete de palmi makes for a slippery slope is you're not used to such luxury. It's true what they say, Italians taught the world how to eat...and like all Italians who do it right, it's all about ingredients. They make their own sauce, the mozzarella is the real deal, the basil fresh from the garden, even in winter. And nono Di Fara is still in there making pizzas everyday. Go there. Tomorrow. Even if you have to change your birthday officially to do so!",5.0

Crap hole. We waited almost an hour and a half for 4 slices of pizza and never got them. We finally just had to walk out. The way this place does business is total BS. They could learn some things from other establishments. It seemed people who ordered whole pizzas get priority and if you just want slices you are a chump and don't matter. People came in after us and hog their food before us. It's totally stupid. If this place could shape up how they operate they could make way more money.

"I recently took another trip to DiFara's and managed to get there when they were actually open and because I went fairly early my wait for a pizza was only 45 minutes. Dominic DeMarco (the only one who makes the pizza's here) is still chugging along making one of the best pizza's in the world, certainly my favorite (or at least in the top 3) ever. Nothing has changed since my last review (so check that out for more details on the place) except for the prices. The prices have skyrocketed to $5 slices, $28 plain pizza, and I believe $32 for a square pizza. The ""square"" or Sicilian as some people call it is a thicker and more buttery (or oily?) crust with the same amazing ingredients. I resisted trying it because this type of pizza anywhere else in NYC is super thick and doughy, not to mention, not the classic New York styled pizza. After hearing so much about it at DiFara's I had to give it a try. I'm glad I did, it's not nearly as thick as any other place's, is still perfectly crispy on the bottom, and seems to hold a lot more toppings than your traditional pizza. Yes the crowd and lines here are unbearable, the space is kind of dirty and cramped and you have to be willing to shove people aside to grab a table when it frees up and yes it's cash only and it's expensive; BUT it's amazing pizza made the right way by the same guy who's been doing it in the same spot since the 60s. It's still worth the drive/subway ride and the wait (though he's certainly testing the limits of how much people will pay to line up for his pizza).UPDATE: Last time I came the squares were burnt to a black crisp and it wasn't just mine, I saw many others like it. When you're charging more than $30 for a cheese pizza, it's really not a great business model to let pizzas go out like this. At $5 and up for a single slice, it's pushing the value even if the pizza was cooked perfectly (which my traditional round pizza thankfully was).",4.0
"Ridiculously expensive, but absolutely mind blowing pizza. All of their ingredients are either fresh from the garden or imported from Italy and care goes into every pie they make. They is actually he, since the father and owner makes every pie by hand by himself. Unfortunately, this often leads to long wait times. There is almost always a line out the door, and it starts forming before they even open. The pies are a bit on the small side: 14-16"" and can easily be eaten by 2 people. This is a must try before you for, so add it to the bucket list and get your spot in line.",5.0
"The pizza is definitely THE BEST, no doubt, and the place has clearly been around for ages. It's definitely a cute place, very casual too; however, the wait is CRAZY! My friend and I were there for an hour and a half waiting for our one pizza. If your timing is good though, you can get there right after they bring out a pie for slices, and if all the people that pre-ordered slices got theirs and there are extras, you can buy them right then and there. Also, it is kind of pricey, but very worth it! Still gets 5 stars despite the wait because it is THAT good.",5.0
"Pizza is pizza, right? I mean, I've had pizza I like better than others but the variant between the best and worst is pretty slim. At least, this is what I thought before Difaras.I was getting tired of Aaron saying how good Difaras was. I mean, shut up dude, it's freaking pizza! Although I should have known seeing that Aaron is rarely off in his recommendations.When he suggested heading for Brooklyn, on an early Sunday morning, I was all too ready to go and decide for myself. That and as a teen, I had worn out a Beastie Boys cassette listening to "" No Sleep Til Brooklyn"" and I was curious to visit.So we set out on our Pizza pilgrimage to Brooklyntown ( or as Jessie Jackson once called it Hymietown). The trip up was amazingly easy ( remember this was Sunday morning). From the Art Museum in Philly to parking on a side street near Difaras in Flatbush, it took 1 1/2 hours. The Difaras experience was interesting to say the least. It opens at noon, and already at 10am people were milling around, waiting to get in.  Difaras is located in a decidedly orthodox Jewish neighborhood , where everything is kosher ...except Difaras. Because of this, some Rabbis take it upon themselves, to inform the people waiting to get in, that eating there is a sin. This led to a hilarious exchange between Aaron ( who is self proclaimed "" Jewy"") and the rabbi, who didn't think he was Jewish.Early on, we got bad news. Someone emerged from Difaras to inform the growing crowd that they won't be opening til 1pm. He was, however, nice enough to take our order so that we would get the first pies out of the oven.With our order in, we took a stroll around the cool neighborhood. Were it not for our reason for being there, I would have loved to get a nosh from one of the amazing Jewish bakeries and delis there. When we returned to Difaras, a good sized line had formed and we regretted not holding our spot in line because even though we had our order in, the seating at Difaras is minimal.Once again, luck favored us here because as the gates opened, everyone rushed the counter and we were able to slip past and secure a table.Keep in mind though, that we were 3 rather large men and the table was barely suitable for 2 children not to mention having to deal with 3 large pies.As promised, the pies came out immediately after we sat and I can tell you that every complaint, every inconvenience , any negative thought was erased as I bit in to that masterpiece. Difaras does for pizza what Sycamore does for a meal in that it makes you realize how good something can actually be. It makes you realize that what you were used to, was mediocre at best.The afternoon following the first bite was a blur. I remember the crisp tasty crust, the fresh tasty toppings, the heat, the flavor. The seating was stuffy and cramped, but I assure you, we felt like we were in heaven.  As we emerged from Difaras, we had to fight through the line of less fortunate people, in a line that wrapped around a corner. Having just eaten that amazing pizza, I both pitied and understood the waiting masses unsatisfied faces.The ride back home was not as smooth and all told the day had cost us each a good $50, between food and tolls. Yet I don't regret it in the least. This was an experience. Something that everyone should try at least once. To make a trip for something so worthwhile is what living is all about.",5.0
"Tried this pizza for the first time this weekend. Let me make this clear: the pizza IS GOOD.Cons: $5 a slice/ $28 a pie- makes this the most expensive pizza I've ever encounteredThey have a tendency to burn (char) the crust. Self admittedly. ""That's how we make it""For the price, the venue is the pits. It's old and dingy, and HOT. Don't plan to eat in.Although there was a grade of ""A"" in the window, I'm not positive they're meeting codes. The guy was handling money, cutting pizza, and paper toweling his sweaty face down the whole time I was waiting, and I did not see him wash his hands. Maybe it adds to the flavor.

Dominic DeMarco (the only one who makes the pizza's here) is still chugging along making one of the best pizza's in the world, certainly my favorite (or at least in the top 3) ever. Nothing has changed since my last review (so check that out for more details on the place) except for the prices. The prices have skyrocketed to $5 slices, $28 plain pizza, and I believe $32 for a square pizza. The ""square"" or Sicilian as some people call it is a thicker and more buttery (or oily?) crust with the same amazing ingredients. I resisted trying it because this type of pizza anywhere else in NYC is super thick and doughy, not to mention, not the classic New York styled pizza. After hearing so much about it at DiFara's I had to give it a try. I'm glad I did, it's not nearly as thick as any other place's, is still perfectly crispy on the bottom, and seems to hold a lot more toppings than your traditional pizza. Yes the crowd and lines here are unbearable, the space is kind of dirty and cramped and you have to be willing to shove people aside to grab a table when it frees up and yes it's cash only and it's expensive; BUT it's amazing pizza made the right way by the same guy who's been doing it in the same spot since the 60s. It's still worth the drive/subway ride and the wait (though he's certainly testing the limits of how much people will pay to line up for his pizza).UPDATE: Last time I came the squares were burnt to a black crisp and it wasn't just mine, I saw many others like it. When you're charging more than $30 for a cheese pizza, it's really not a great business model to let pizzas go out like this. At $5 and up for a single slice, it's pushing the value even if the pizza was cooked perfectly (which my traditional round pizza thankfully was).",4.0
"Ridiculously expensive, but absolutely mind blowing pizza. All of their ingredients are either fresh from the garden or imported from Italy and care goes into every pie they make. They is actually he, since the father and owner makes every pie by hand by himself. Unfortunately, this often leads to long wait times. There is almost always a line out the door, and it starts forming before they even open. The pies are a bit on the small side: 14-16"" and can easily be eaten by 2 people. This is a must try before you for, so add it to the bucket list and get your spot in line.",5.0
"The pizza is definitely THE BEST, no doubt, and the place has clearly been around for ages. It's definitely a cute place, very casual too; however, the wait is CRAZY! My friend and I were there for an hour and a half waiting for our one pizza. If your timing is good though, you can get there right after they bring out a pie for slices, and if all the people that pre-ordered slices got theirs and there are extras, you can buy them right then and there. Also, it is kind of pricey, but very worth it! Still gets 5 stars despite the wait because it is THAT good.",5.0
"Pizza is pizza, right? I mean, I've had pizza I like better than others but the variant between the best and worst is pretty slim. At least, this is what I thought before Difaras.I was getting tired of Aaron saying how good Difaras was. I mean, shut up dude, it's freaking pizza! Although I should have known seeing that Aaron is rarely off in his recommendations.When he suggested heading for Brooklyn, on an early Sunday morning, I was all too ready to go and decide for myself. That and as a teen, I had worn out a Beastie Boys cassette listening to "" No Sleep Til Brooklyn"" and I was curious to visit.So we set out on our Pizza pilgrimage to Brooklyntown ( or as Jessie Jackson once called it Hymietown). The trip up was amazingly easy ( remember this was Sunday morning). From the Art Museum in Philly to parking on a side street near Difaras in Flatbush, it took 1 1/2 hours. The Difaras experience was interesting to say the least. It opens at noon, and already at 10am people were milling around, waiting to get in.  Difaras is located in a decidedly orthodox Jewish neighborhood , where everything is kosher ...except Difaras. Because of this, some Rabbis take it upon themselves, to inform the people waiting to get in, that eating there is a sin. This led to a hilarious exchange between Aaron ( who is self proclaimed "" Jewy"") and the rabbi, who didn't think he was Jewish.Early on, we got bad news. Someone emerged from Difaras to inform the growing crowd that they won't be opening til 1pm. He was, however, nice enough to take our order so that we would get the first pies out of the oven.With our order in, we took a stroll around the cool neighborhood. Were it not for our reason for being there, I would have loved to get a nosh from one of the amazing Jewish bakeries and delis there. When we returned to Difaras, a good sized line had formed and we regretted not holding our spot in line because even though we had our order in, the seating at Difaras is minimal.Once again, luck favored us here because as the gates opened, everyone rushed the counter and we were able to slip past and secure a table.Keep in mind though, that we were 3 rather large men and the table was barely suitable for 2 children not to mention having to deal with 3 large pies.As promised, the pies came out immediately after we sat and I can tell you that every complaint, every inconvenience , any negative thought was erased as I bit in to that masterpiece. Difaras does for pizza what Sycamore does for a meal in that it makes you realize how good something can actually be. It makes you realize that what you were used to, was mediocre at best.The afternoon following the first bite was a blur. I remember the crisp tasty crust, the fresh tasty toppings, the heat, the flavor. The seating was stuffy and cramped, but I assure you, we felt like we were in heaven.  As we emerged from Difaras, we had to fight through the line of less fortunate people, in a line that wrapped around a corner. Having just eaten that amazing pizza, I both pitied and understood the waiting masses unsatisfied faces.The ride back home was not as smooth and all told the day had cost us each a good $50, between food and tolls. Yet I don't regret it in the least. This was an experience. Something that everyone should try at least once. To make a trip for something so worthwhile is what living is all about.",5.0
"Tried this pizza for the first time this weekend. Let me make this clear: the pizza IS GOOD.Cons: $5 a slice/ $28 a pie- makes this the most expensive pizza I've ever encounteredThey have a tendency to burn (char) the crust. Self admittedly. ""That's how we make it""For the price, the venue is the pits. It's old and dingy, and HOT. Don't plan to eat in.Although there was a grade of ""A"" in the window, I'm not positive they're meeting codes. The guy was handling money, cutting pizza, and paper toweling his sweaty face down the whole time I was waiting, and I did not see him wash his hands. Maybe it adds to the flavor. I dunno.I know there seems to be A LOT of cons.....but like I said, it's really good pizza.",4.0
"Absolutely FANTASTIC tasting pizza, but do avoid eating till full as it runs a pretty penny at $5 a regular slice.Nonetheless, one of Brooklyn's main pizza stables aside from L&B's, the same owner has been making pizza for decades. Sadly if he ever passes I highly doubt his kids will be able to fill in his shoes and still justify the cost of their pizza.Must try but pre-game on food before you come, nothing hurts like shelling enough money for a pie elsewhere for 2-3 slices.",4.0

"Decided on a random wednesday to bike over to Di Fara's with a friend. Took about an hour+ from  Manhattan. Got there at 8pm. No line. Weird.Ordered a sicilian slice and a di fara's special. The sicilian came out right away. Wow. The best sicilian I've had. Crunchy/crispy. Full of flavor, cheese, olive oil, basil, tomatoes. Yum40 minutes later we got the try the special. It was very good. Maybe the number of toppings took away from the dough/sauce/cheese/basil but it was not a mind-blowing extraordinary slice of pie. But when you're talking about this caliber of pizza you're really just splitting hairs. Would I trek an hour just for Di Fara's? No. I would definitely go if it's on the way to the beach or something.",5.0
Haven't been here in about 6 years. Back in the day the wife and I used to come here around once a month. Back then the pizza was truly awesome.Was in the neighborhood and stopped by for a pie. Waited an hour for the pie. All I can say all good things must come to an end...Dom has lost his fastball. Pizza was very average. Hell the Parmesan cheese used is no longer freshly grated from a block - looks to be from a bag.,3.0
"My wife and I decided to try this pizza yesterday spot after receiving a Zagat saying this was the best pizza in New York. I will give you the full FAIR run-down so you don't waste your time and money. First lets talk about décor...the place is VERY tiny, If you think you will enjoy a pizza with your spouse, girlfriend/boyfriend....fughetaboutit! I think only about 10 people could sit down at this DIVE, plus you would be facing a wall sitting cafeteria style bunched up like a sardine, with customers breathing on your pizza while you eat or standing over you. We decided to order a pizza and eat it in our car. Next up Service...So when you order a pizza $5 slice, $28 pie, $32 for classic pie, you have to let the order taker know what you want. In our case it was a guy, (maybe the owner son) but he takes your order on yellow tab paper and you become like a box on a crossword puzzle. You would think with this system, it would be first come first served, but it is not. Although the order taker told us about a 40 min wait, we happily waited to taste why this pizza was so good. Anyway, my wife and I have never been to this pizza joint before but as we were waiting, we started to notice that the order taker was switching boxes with orders. Yep, what I mean is that if you were a regular and you came in after someone else, your pizza came out before the person ahead of you. We both assumed that some of these people may have called in an order, although we heard no phones ringing, and no pizzas waiting for pickup. After we had been waiting for about 20 mins a family can in and placed their order...you guessed it they got their pizza 1bout 10 mins before me. The gentleman said it was his first time at Di Fara. Hmmmm. Finally hows the food? well my rating tell it all. Frank Pepe in New Haven CT IS BY FAR the best tasting pizza! But let me share with you why you may want to save your $28 herd earned bucks! The place is NASTY in terms of being sanitary. The health grade is still pending wich means for a location that has been there that long they must consistently get below an ""A"" grade. This is what we saw on Saturday November 2nd 2013...The same guy who is taking orders with a dirty pen and pad, is the same person handling the money. Cash is one of the filthiest things you can touch because its full of germs. But here is where it gets nasty...yep, the same guy who is touching all those dollar bills, is also going to the back and replenishing the dough (two or three at a time)  for the old man to make the pies. Oh Yeah, no gloves, he's touching the dough with bare dirty, nasty hands. Also, the same guy that touches the money, and the dough, is reaching his filthy hands into the cheese been and grating the cheese. Now about the pizza, when we finally got it about 45 mins later it was a disgrace to true pizza lovers! We tried the classic (sausage, peppers, onions, mushrooms) and the toppings were almost non existent. The pizza was to soggy at the ends (your crucial first bite will flop over) and the ends were to hard. (because its a thin crust) The ends were NOT chewy at all. Also, If you like gooey, cheesy pizza, (the kind when you pick up a slice the cheese is all over) then don't go here. They use tree different kinds of cheese and they are lacking on the mozzarella. The sauce did not hold up either as it was pushed to the end of the hard crust!Bottom line...save your money, this place is overrated!",2.0
"Go there.  Bring beer (or wine).  Realize you will wait a long, long time.  One time I ordered a slice to tide me over while I waited for my pizza (slice came in 20 minutes, pizza closer to two hours).  Extraordinarily flavorful-the numerous cheeses, the fresh herbs, the olive oil-I also add those amazing peppers that I've never seen elsewhere.  Go pay homage to the king.",5.0
"A  moment on the lips, a lifetime of the hips. WHO CARES! Totally worth it!

If I was not so poor, this lovely hand-made pizza would be in my stomach everyday. I live 10 minutes away from Di Fara and I remember when I was younger I would go to the Avenue J library to ""study"" and then 2 hours later, I would buy a slice (of course it was cheaper then). It might be 5 dollars a slice/square, but just wow, MOUTH 'GASM! That basil, drizzled olive oil, cheese that is still sizzling, the oddly shaped thin crispy crust. I can't even describe the feelings that go into this pizza.  Di Fara is simply a must for any pizza connoisseur.  Some helpful tips:1) I think it is 27 or 28 for a pie now. Totally worth it, because you cannot stop at one.2) Do not try to go here on Monday and sometimes Tuesdays (varies by season) as they are closed! 3) Q train to Avenue J is the only way here! 4) Be wary on Fridays, it can be really crowded. I waited an hour once for this pizza, totally worth it. This is the only pizza I would ever wait over 15 minutes for. 5) I think they implemented a no photo policy without permission now, but never stops anyone!Seriously, worth it over and over again.",5.0

"Di Fara's Pizzeria has been in the spotlight for a pretty long time now -- and definitely deserves to be!  Their freshly made Pizza's and Mr. DeMarco's freshly cut basil (as seen below) really make it hard to beat!Regular Pie [$25] -- I'm pretty picky about cheese pizza's.  Why not though, right?  Cheese pizza's are pretty simple to make but the ingredients need to be perfect for it to work.  For slices, I'd go for a fresh one Ray's on 11th and 6th but for an AMAZING dine-in cheese pie, Di Fara's is the way to go!The tomato sauce on their pies is perfect.  Definitely not too acidic and even a little sweeter than usual!  The sauce, believe it or not, is a well thought out mixture of fresh and canned tomatoes, that works very well with mozzarella cheese (which is imported directly from Italy, mind you).  How awesome is that?!Regular Pie with Mushrooms and Onions [$28] -- This was SIZZLING when it got out of the oven. He also sprinkled freshly grated Parmesan over the fresh pie.  The Mushrooms and Onions were fresh and added the right amount of texture to the pie.  The crust was just right, not too crunchy and not too soft!  We took it easy by ordering only Mushrooms and Onions but next time around, we'll make sure to go crazy because gosh, if this was as good as it was, I'm sure everything else will be too!All in all, Di Fara's position on all of the top 10 lists for Pizza in NYC is definitely well deserved.  The trip to Brooklyn, even if it took a little longer than expected, was well worth it!  Fortunately, when we visited (close to closing time), there was only one person ordering from the window.  We basically had the seating area to ourselves!  Find a way to make it out to Brooklyn to enjoy the Di Fara's pizza.  Really, I think you'll love it!If only every pizzeria cut fresh basil for every pie they made.  That might lead to a perfect world!  I guess we'll never know!",5.0

I lived here around the block for 20 years and been eating his pizza . Domenick puts his heart and soul into making each pie. This pizza is just amazing it melts in your mouth . Yes the slices are thin but that's how Italian pizza should be. The best pizza in New York,5.0
"I've been living in this neighborhood for a LONG time and have had this pizza all the time, I DON'T see what's so amazing about the pizza here, people line up outside and wait over an hour just to get a slice of this mediocre pizza. First off, this place has been shut down before by the health dept. (this place is dirty), and when the guy goes to take your money and change, he doesn't wear gloves and goes straight back to making the pizza (witnessed this a few times personally). The slices are 80% burnt on the bottom and are extremely thin with very little to no cheese at all. Not to mention that each slice is over $5, seriously this place sucks.",1.0
"Wanted to leave a review for this place due to lack of consensus of food:Drove down to Di Fara after spending some time at Brooklyn Promenade and eating ice cream there. I wasn't hungry at all but then when I walked into the store and smelled the air (a mix of burnt crust along with sizzling cheese), I was hungry again.We found parking across the street luckily and proceeded to line up. We were ""lucky"" and lined up for 20 minutes and left our order so they could commence baking. We ordered 2 pepperoni and 1 mushroom because we saw how good it was when other people were eating it. We were told that the square slices would have to wait 30 min and the round slices were 20. By this time, we had waited 20 min, so another 30 would result in my stomach eating itself - so we decided to go with round slices.After 15 minutes, they called our name to come up and pickup and pay. We had found a seat in a dirty table in the back, but we were happy to find a seat.Unfortunately, as we went up to pick up, we realized the famous old man had screwed up our order and instead, we got:1 x mushroom pizza slice1 x sausage pizza slice1 x artichoke pizza sliceThe young man who took our order was extremely apologetic, but we didn't want to wait another 15 to 20 min AND waste freshly made pizza, so we decided to give it a shot.... And it was the best decision we ever made!The mushroom slice was 7/10, excellent aroma and juicy mushrooms without sogging the crust. The crust was amazingly fresh and somehow crunchy yet soft... crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. It lacked a kick of flavor though. (but smelled damn good!)The sausage slice was 9/10, the sausage was still sizzling and whatever flavor mushroom lacked, sausage delivered and then some. We still need to try pepperoni but man, the sausage was full of grease (yummy grease, don't judge!) and was exactly how a sausage + cheese + pizza crust should be. It lacked mushroom's awesome aroma but the flavor was full and didn't disappoint.Finally, we came to the artichoke pizza... and man i'd give it 12/10 - and it was even better than artichoke pizza's artichoke pizza. THIS is a bold statement, I know. I waited outside for 30 minutes in the middle of freezing February for artichoke pizza at artichoke pizza and it was awesome and well worth it. But! But! This place's artichoke gave me several pieces of FULL artichoke... literally the ingredient was thicker than the 3 times the crust. The artichoke was really fresh because when you bit into it, the full flavor + full aroma danced in your mouth into an expertly created topping selection.I had to thank the younger gentleman for Di Fara's error - and he laughed: ""the artichoke is the chef's special ingredient this week"". No joke, it delivered. Try it! Note: as we left the restaurant at 7:45 pm, the line had tripled.",5.0
"Di Fara is a slice of heaven. It is perfect without any toppings. Get whatever slice is ready - regular or square - if you don't want to wait - you can't go wrong!

"Di Fara's Pizzeria has been in the spotlight for a pretty long time now -- and definitely deserves to be!  Their freshly made Pizza's and Mr. DeMarco's freshly cut basil (as seen below) really make it hard to beat!Regular Pie [$25] -- I'm pretty picky about cheese pizza's.  Why not though, right?  Cheese pizza's are pretty simple to make but the ingredients need to be perfect for it to work.  For slices, I'd go for a fresh one Ray's on 11th and 6th but for an AMAZING dine-in cheese pie, Di Fara's is the way to go!The tomato sauce on their pies is perfect.  Definitely not too acidic and even a little sweeter than usual!  The sauce, believe it or not, is a well thought out mixture of fresh and canned tomatoes, that works very well with mozzarella cheese (which is imported directly from Italy, mind you).  How awesome is that?!Regular Pie with Mushrooms and Onions [$28] -- This was SIZZLING when it got out of the oven. He also sprinkled freshly grated Parmesan over the fresh pie.  The Mushrooms and Onions were fresh and added the right amount of texture to the pie.  The crust was just right, not too crunchy and not too soft!  We took it easy by ordering only Mushrooms and Onions but next time around, we'll make sure to go crazy because gosh, if this was as good as it was, I'm sure everything else will be too!All in all, Di Fara's position on all of the top 10 lists for Pizza in NYC is definitely well deserved.  The trip to Brooklyn, even if it took a little longer than expected, was well worth it!  Fortunately, when we visited (close to closing time), there was only one person ordering from the window.  We basically had the seating area to ourselves!  Find a way to make it out to Brooklyn to enjoy the Di Fara's pizza.  Really, I think you'll love it!If only every pizzeria cut fresh basil for every pie they made.  That might lead to a perfect world!  I guess we'll never know!",5.0

I lived here around the block for 20 years and been eating his pizza . Domenick puts his heart and soul into making each pie. This pizza is just amazing it melts in your mouth . Yes the slices are thin but that's how Italian pizza should be. The best pizza in New York,5.0
"I've been living in this neighborhood for a LONG time and have had this pizza all the time, I DON'T see what's so amazing about the pizza here, people line up outside and wait over an hour just to get a slice of this mediocre pizza. First off, this place has been shut down before by the health dept. (this place is dirty), and when the guy goes to take your money and change, he doesn't wear gloves and goes straight back to making the pizza (witnessed this a few times personally). The slices are 80% burnt on the bottom and are extremely thin with very little to no cheese at all. Not to mention that each slice is over $5, seriously this place sucks.",1.0
"Wanted to leave a review for this place due to lack of consensus of food:Drove down to Di Fara after spending some time at Brooklyn Promenade and eating ice cream there. I wasn't hungry at all but then when I walked into the store and smelled the air (a mix of burnt crust along with sizzling cheese), I was hungry again.We found parking across the street luckily and proceeded to line up. We were ""lucky"" and lined up for 20 minutes and left our order so they could commence baking. We ordered 2 pepperoni and 1 mushroom because we saw how good it was when other people were eating it. We were told that the square slices would have to wait 30 min and the round slices were 20. By this time, we had waited 20 min, so another 30 would result in my stomach eating itself - so we decided to go with round slices.After 15 minutes, they called our name to come up and pickup and pay. We had found a seat in a dirty table in the back, but we were happy to find a seat.Unfortunately, as we went up to pick up, we realized the famous old man had screwed up our order and instead, we got:1 x mushroom pizza slice1 x sausage pizza slice1 x artichoke pizza sliceThe young man who took our order was extremely apologetic, but we didn't want to wait another 15 to 20 min AND waste freshly made pizza, so we decided to give it a shot.... And it was the best decision we ever made!The mushroom slice was 7/10, excellent aroma and juicy mushrooms without sogging the crust. The crust was amazingly fresh and somehow crunchy yet soft... crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. It lacked a kick of flavor though. (but smelled damn good!)The sausage slice was 9/10, the sausage was still sizzling and whatever flavor mushroom lacked, sausage delivered and then some. We still need to try pepperoni but man, the sausage was full of grease (yummy grease, don't judge!) and was exactly how a sausage + cheese + pizza crust should be. It lacked mushroom's awesome aroma but the flavor was full and didn't disappoint.Finally, we came to the artichoke pizza... and man i'd give it 12/10 - and it was even better than artichoke pizza's artichoke pizza. THIS is a bold statement, I know. I waited outside for 30 minutes in the middle of freezing February for artichoke pizza at artichoke pizza and it was awesome and well worth it. But! But! This place's artichoke gave me several pieces of FULL artichoke... literally the ingredient was thicker than the 3 times the crust. The artichoke was really fresh because when you bit into it, the full flavor + full aroma danced in your mouth into an expertly created topping selection.I had to thank the younger gentleman for Di Fara's error - and he laughed: ""the artichoke is the chef's special ingredient this week"". No joke, it delivered. Try it! Note: as we left the restaurant at 7:45 pm, the line had tripled.",5.0
"Di Fara is a slice of heaven. It is perfect without any toppings. Get whatever slice is ready - regular or square - if you don't want to wait - you can't go wrong!

"I understand that this place has a polarizing effect on Yelpers. On the one hand, this pizza is truly a labor of love and I'm pretty sure we'll agree on that. On the other hand, service is eccentrically slow, slices are expensive, and the quality is neither super-consistent, nor is it /significantly/ better than any other New York pizza.I really enjoyed the slices I had (one square slice with pepperoni, sausage, and mushroom and one virgin regular slice). There was no pizzagasm. It was just a good all around slice, slightly burnt on the edges, great fresh basil flavor, and most certainly made with concentration and effort.But I understand that many people build this place up as the be-all and end-all of pizza places, and when they're disappointed, recommend that no one else should waste their time here and that the prospective pizza eater should just go to any old pizza joint that's convenient. I think that's too harsh, as I really enjoyed myself, but if you're not interested in a 'pizza experience', you can probably save a couple bucks going elsewhere.Though I like this place, I probably wouldn't go out of my way to come here on a regular basis.

"Nostalgia and history is what happens when you walk into this place. It's run down and a bit chaotic too.$5 for a slice isn't cheap, but there's some affection watching Dom, the only person allowed to make and assemble pizza's.I've only been there once, and I had no idea how to order a slice. But after a good 10 mins of waiting with other people who were also confused, we were able to order and get a slice within 10 mins.The pizza is good. Would be worth a 30 min wait, but nothing like what other people have been posting.",4.0
"Honestly this place is a joke!!!! I heard so much hype about this pizza joint and decided to go. Low and behold when I got there around 5pm, they claim they ran out of pizza dough and will not be open till 6:30pm. Supposedly word on the street is, it's because this joint is run by a one man (and I mean really old man) show. Apparently, the guy who makes the pizza moves at a molasses pace and he and his daughter are the owner.  So instead of hiring help, this old man that I like to refer to as grandpa rather does it all by himself and hence this is why they are always running out of ""pizza dough"" from 4-6:30pm, because grandpapa needs his cat nap.Don't get me wrong, the pizza is really just okay, but for the price that they are asking for it is so not worth it or the trip to the boom docks.CAUTION: Expect a very and I mean a VERY LONG ROPING LINE!!!",2.0
"I found the best pizza in NYC! Only you have to travel an hour to get there. And it costs $32 bucks a pie. And if it snows, the uptown train will break and you will have to walk a mile to the F train. And you can't call ahead an order. And you have to snatch one of the very few tables. But it's still the best.",5.0
"Truly the best pizza in NY (or the world?) This guy is unbelievable! If he's not there, no pizza is made! There is usually a line out the door, and when you order you better be on your game, but that's what makes it so classic.

"The place look old and some might think shady but the Pizza is great. The best Pizza I have ever had. Everything to perfection from crust,    cheese, to toppings and final touch with some fresh herbs and olive oil. First time we waited  90 minutes and second time 45 minutes so you need to try this with good company so you don't get bored. IMNSHO it worth the wait and lives to the hype.",4.0
"Still the same guy, but so many changes. I had this pizza since high school, from an unknown mom & pop's shop to a line around the corner shop. However, my recent purchase was disappointing.  Don't get me wrong, it is still a really good slice of pizza, but no longer worth my $5. The crust is not longer super crunchy. The cheese fails to be slightly burnt for that nice flavor. The fresh herb (literally growing at the window) is no longer there. SMH. It's still good, but no longer $5 a slice good.",4.0
"I understand that this place has a polarizing effect on Yelpers. On the one hand, this pizza is truly a labor of love and I'm pretty sure we'll agree on that. On the other hand, service is eccentrically slow, slices are expensive, and the quality is neither super-consistent, nor is it /significantly/ better than any other New York pizza.I really enjoyed the slices I had (one square slice with pepperoni, sausage, and mushroom and one virgin regular slice). There was no pizzagasm. It was just a good all around slice, slightly burnt on the edges, great fresh basil flavor, and most certainly made with concentration and effort.But I understand that many people build this place up as the be-all and end-all of pizza places, and when they're disappointed, recommend that no one else should waste their time here and that the prospective pizza eater should just go to any old pizza joint that's convenient. I think that's too harsh, as I really enjoyed myself, but if you're not interested in a 'pizza experience', you can probably save a couple bucks going elsewhere.Though I like this place, I probably wouldn't go out of my way to come here on a regular basis. But it's definitely at least a 4 star pizza.",4.0

Watching Dom make pizza in his slow, methodical fashion is an incredible experience, and as I said, the pizza here is as good as it gets.

You want to come back, because the pizza is amazing...but you're in NYC, and there are a lot of amazing pizzerias here. Sure, I believe that Di Fara makes a better pie than Motorino or Patsys, but a marginally better pie usually isn't worth the pain of going to Di Fara. The pain is real - the 2-3 hour combined subway ride/wait, worrying if you are going to be able to get a table, dealing with the lack of air conditioning if its summer, having to go to CVS across the street for a restroom, and then once you get your pie, feeling rushed because there are 3-4 tables and everybody wants your spot. So Di Fara is never able to be a truly amazing dining experience.The best way I can find to sum it up: The pizza that Dom Demarco makes is the best pizza in NYC, and when he's really on maybe the best in the world, but Di Fara is far from the best *pizzeria*.",4.0

They charge $5 for a regular slice while a regular pie cost $28. Their slices are pretty small and I left Di Fara's hungry.",3.0

"I have been to Italy and had fabulous pizza in Los Angeles (Mozza) as well but this pizza right here! TAKES THE CAKE!!! This place should have pizza stands on every corner in every state! I can not say enough about this pizza. We only went because it had close to 1000 reviews, didn't even know it was show cased on FoodNetwork! We waited approx 30mins for 4 slices of cheese pizza with fresh basil. Worth every second. I hear that's fast too we caught them as they cut the line off right before they closed in the middle of the day. This is a place I would make it a point to visit every time I visited NY/BK",5.0

"All you need to know is that it holds up to the hype. The best pizza in New York.The good:The regular slice reminds me of a plain New York slice, but takes it onto a whole different level. Great crust, well seasoned sauce, three types of cheese (a combination that you will not get anywhere else), fresh cut basil, and lathered with delicious olive oil.However, there's something different from the square pie, it takes the pizza to a whole different level. The pie is double baked and olive oil is put under the pie while it's baking. Along with a more robust crust, the bottom has a perfect crunch. Simply the best crust you will ever have.The tips:It's closed Monday and Tuesday. Go early, before it opens so you can order before the pies are made. After ordering a pie, you can wait over an hour.The square pie takes extra long because of the double baking.The bad:Fine, it might be one of the dirtiest, most run down places I've ever been, but I'm here for pizza.

The line surprising wasn't that long... we were the 3rd people the order as soon as we walked in. Majority of the people were waiting for their food. Cleanliness... wow. I am SO surprised that this place got an A. After taking a walk to the bathroom, I really wanted a shot of something hard to sanitize my stomach just in case.

It felt old, tattered and worn out. Nice! But the seating situation... annoying. It is a little pricey ... but the food was worth it.

So you decide if you want to eat at a CASH ONLY, MICE infested place. maybe if they'll be fined the 2nd time they'll finally spend some $$ (and with $6/slice they are not poor)and finally renovate/make this place safer and buy some napkins for their costumers.

"About three years ago a friend of mine offered me a deal.  In exchange for a drive back to Brooklyn from the Jersey Shore she would treat me to the best pizza in the world.   I was more than happy to drive her home regardless of the offer of pizza.

I only give this place 4 stars because the quality of the pizza is better than most. The pizza there is always fresh since the guy who makes it is hardly there. Try it if you want a slice of old style pizza.,4.0
"I finally decided to bite the bullet and try out Di Fara Pizza today.  In fact I was determined to see why so many people, magazines, blogs, and newspaper call it the best pizza around. I looked up the hours for the pizza shop and found out from Yelp that they close for two hours from 4pm to 6pm.  Oh Oh.  I had half an hour and it would take me about 20 to 25 minutes to get there according to my gps.  Off I went driving like a mad man, determined to bite into that pizza no matter what.  By luck there was a free parking space right in front of the store. Yahoo!!!  I parked there, hopped out to pay the meter and discovered that the meter was out of order.  Free parking.  Double yahoo!!!I ran to the door.  It was 3:55pm.  5 minutes to 4pm.  I made it.  Dancing with joy, I was about to open the door when I noticed the store hours posted on the glass.  The store closes at 4:30pm to 6pm.  What?  Yelp gave me the wrong closing hours and I drove like a crazy person, risking life and limb to get to this pizza on time and I didn't need to?  Thanks Yelp.  That pizza better be worth it.So was it worth the trouble?  Hell yes.  That is some magic tasting pizza.  It was soft, thin, chewy without being soggy and wimpy.  There are burnt edges here and there but somehow it adds character and flavor to the pizza instead of detracting from it.  The cheese literally melts in your mouth.  They grate fresh Parmesan behind the counter and you are free to use as much as you want.  If you want to add a spicy kick to the pizza, they also provide a wonderful pickled red pepper in oil that you are free to pile on. That red pepper was so good.  Just be aware that the pizza is very oily (they put in olive oil while making the pizza).  If you are one of those people that like to soak up the oil in your pizza before eating, get a lot of tissues ready.  I'm pretty sure there would be those that will lower the score by 1 or 2 stars for this but it doesn't bother me much here for some reason.Is it the best pizza out there.  Maybe not but it is among the top few. Is it worth 5 bucks a slice?  It depends on how you look at it.  I for one believe food should be judged on if the quality of the food is up to the price they are demanding.   If they ask for 5 bucks and it's substandard or ordinary then hell no. Although I do wish that it was more affordable at least they justify it by their quality and the time and care he puts into each pie.   Besides, if I worry about the price of everything I eat I would never end up in a five star restaurant.  The owner is the only person making the pies here and it takes a while for each one (thus the long waits). I was here for 45 minutes and it wasn't even that crowded at the time so people that come here better be patient. The whole place is very old looking.  If you need a place to be spotless before you could order food, this is not the place for you.  Also people should be aware that each slice is pretty small.  It's about 2/3 the size of a regular pizza slice from most pizza shops.I guess that it's a blessing in disguise that it's 5 bucks a slice and 25 bucks for a pie because otherwise I'll gain so much weight from eating there non-stop. I could not afford to, but I'll be back once in a while for sure anyway.  Next time though,I'll ignore Yelp when it's telling me that this place closes at 4pm for two hours since I now know it's wrong.One more thing.  Yelp is also wrong about Tuesday.   Di Fara is actually closed on both Mondays and Tuesdays now even though Yelp states that on Tuesdays they are open.  Di Fara have changed their store hours a few months back but Yelp apparently haven't updated this information.  Writing a email to Yelp about this little boo boo of theirs so hopefully they would update it soon.  Don't want anyone to fly from California to eat Di Fara's pizza just to find out they are closed on Tuesday.  There's my good deed for the day.Update: Yelp got my email and they corrected Di Fara's business hours on Tuesday 1-12-10.  Ok now back to eating.",5.0

"We stopped at Di Fara as part of our 4-part Brooklyn pizza tour.I will say, first off, that the pizza here is absolutely phenomenal. It's really some of the best I've ever had. The fresh basil and the olive oil added at the end make it just about perfect. We got a large regular cheese as well as a square pizza with peppers, onions and sausage. Both were awesome.Despite the incredible pizza, I can't give Di Fara 5 stars, unfortunately. It's really not convenient to anything, but you probably already know that if you're thinking about coming here. The line was actually quite short when we arrived, but it was deceptive. Once we ordered it took nearly an hour to get our pizzas, and it was brutally hot inside with hardly anywhere to sit. There also isn't much of anywhere nearby to hang out and wait (and I got the sense that if you leave they may not make your pizza at all!). It was also, by far, the most expensive stop on our tour.All in all, if you want some of the best pizza you will ever have, you need to stop into Di Fara at some point. Just know that it's going to be inconvenient, expensive and take a while. It's certainly worth doing for a special occasion, but not an every week kinda thing.",4.0

(By the way, does this guy ever go to the bathroom? in THAT bathroom?) He does not use gloves or plates or .... towels?Atmosphere. This was very hole in the wall, dive place. It felt old, tattered and worn out. Nice! But the seating situation... annoying. It is a little pricey ... but the food was worth it. The pizza was definitely good but this is another tried it move on. Not going to become a frequently visitor here. But I am glad I have tried it.",3.0
"ok Yes the pizza is greesy but good BUT , they were closed by Health department with F grade for over a month recently they reopened...MICE all over the floor, nothing really renovated (too greedy I suppose to worry about hygine and safety of their costumers) NO napkins, tables are NEVER wiped , always dirty, the place is a size of a grocery store and yes a typical 45min-1hr wait. So you decide if you want to eat at a CASH ONLY, MICE infested place. maybe if they'll be fined the 2nd time they'll finally spend some $$ (and with $6/slice they are not poor)and finally renovate/make this place safer and buy some napkins for their costumers. I've never seen a greedier owners.",3.0
"About three years ago a friend of mine offered me a deal.  In exchange for a drive back to Brooklyn from the Jersey Shore she would treat me to the best pizza in the world.   I was more than happy to drive her home regardless of the offer of pizza. When we got to Brooklyn and I discovered the line outside of the door in order to get that pizza, I reitterated the lack of need for the pizza. ""I'm not waiting two hours for pizza.  We can go somewhere else! - Really!""""But Marc, you don't understand, this is the best pizza in the world. You have to trust me.""""Ok, fine.""Two hours later I was kissing the ground this girl walked upon.  I was in pizza heaven.  There is absolutely nothing which can compare to Di Fara's pizza.The rest of these reviews tell the story of the pie and the way it is made.  There is nothing that I can really add to those stories.   All I can do is relay my first experience there.  And yes, I've been back multiple times since then.To the nay sayers, all I can say is the fact I would wait, on purpose, for over two hours to eat anything is a testament to the awesomeness of this pie.   It is well worth the trip and time.",5.0
I only give this place 4 stars because the quality of the pizza is better than most. The pizza there is always fresh since the guy who makes it is hardly there. Try it if you want a slice of old style pizza.,4.0
"I finally decided to bite the bullet and try out Di Fara Pizza today.  In fact I was determined to see why so many people, magazines, blogs, and newspaper call it the best pizza around. I looked up the hours for the pizza shop and found out from Yelp that they close for two hours from 4pm to 6pm.  Oh Oh.  I had half an hour and it would take me about 20 to 25 minutes to get there according to my gps.  Off I went driving like a mad man, determined to bite into that pizza no matter what.  By luck there was a free parking space right in front of the store. Yahoo!!!  I parked there, hopped out to pay the meter and discovered that the meter was out of order.  Free parking.  Double yahoo!!!I ran to the door.  It was 3:55pm.  5 minutes to 4pm.  I made it.  Dancing with joy, I was about to open the door when I noticed the store hours posted on the glass.  The store closes at 4:30pm to 6pm.  What?  Yelp gave me the wrong closing hours and I drove like a crazy person, risking life and limb to get to this pizza on time and I didn't need to?  Thanks Yelp.  That pizza better be worth it.So was it worth the trouble?  Hell yes.  That is some magic tasting pizza.  It was soft, thin, chewy without being soggy and wimpy.  There are burnt edges here and there but somehow it adds character and flavor to the pizza instead of detracting from it.  The cheese literally melts in your mouth.  They grate fresh Parmesan behind the counter and you are free to use as much as you want.  If you want to add a spicy kick to the pizza, they also provide a wonderful pickled red pepper in oil that you are free to pile on. That red pepper was so good.  Just be aware that the pizza is very oily (they put in olive oil while making the pizza).  If you are one of those people that like to soak up the oil in your pizza before eating, get a lot of tissues ready.  I'm pretty sure there would be those that will lower the score by 1 or 2 stars for this but it doesn't bother me much here for some reason.Is it the best pizza out there.  Maybe not but it is among the top few. Is it worth 5 bucks a slice?  It depends on how you look at it.  I for one believe food should be judged on if the quality of the food is up to the price they are demanding.   If they ask for 5 bucks and it's substandard or ordinary then hell no. Although I do wish that it was more affordable at least they justify it by their quality and the time and care he puts into each pie.   Besides, if I worry about the price of everything I eat I would never end up in a five star restaurant.  The owner is the only person making the pies here and it takes a while for each one (thus the long waits). I was here for 45 minutes and it wasn't even that crowded at the time so people that come here better be patient. The whole place is very old looking.  If you need a place to be spotless before you could order food, this is not the place for you.  Also people should be aware that each slice is pretty small.  It's about 2/3 the size of a regular pizza slice from most pizza shops.I guess that it's a blessing in disguise that it's 5 bucks a slice and 25 bucks for a pie because otherwise I'll gain so much weight from eating there non-stop. I could not afford to, but I'll be back once in a while for sure anyway.  Next time though,I'll ignore Yelp when it's telling me that this place closes at 4pm for two hours since I now know it's wrong.One more thing.  Yelp is also wrong about Tuesday.   Di Fara is actually closed on both Mondays and Tuesdays now even though Yelp states that on Tuesdays they are open.  Di Fara have changed their store hours a few months back but Yelp apparently haven't updated this information.  Writing a email to Yelp about this little boo boo of theirs so hopefully they would update it soon.  Don't want anyone to fly from California to eat Di Fara's pizza just to find out they are closed on Tuesday.  There's my good deed for the day.Update: Yelp got my email and they corrected Di Fara's business hours on Tuesday 1-12-10.  Ok now back to eating.",5.0

"We stopped at Di Fara as part of our 4-part Brooklyn pizza tour.I will say, first off, that the pizza here is absolutely phenomenal. It's really some of the best I've ever had. The fresh basil and the olive oil added at the end make it just about perfect. We got a large regular cheese as well as a square pizza with peppers, onions and sausage. Both were awesome.Despite the incredible pizza, I can't give Di Fara 5 stars, unfortunately. It's really not convenient to anything, but you probably already know that if you're thinking about coming here. The line was actually quite short when we arrived, but it was deceptive. Once we ordered it took nearly an hour to get our pizzas, and it was brutally hot inside with hardly anywhere to sit. There also isn't much of anywhere nearby to hang out and wait (and I got the sense that if you leave they may not make your pizza at all!). It was also, by far, the most expensive stop on our tour.All in all, if you want some of the best pizza you will ever have, you need to stop into Di Fara at some point. Just know that it's going to be inconvenient, expensive and take a while. It's certainly worth doing for a special occasion, but not an every week kinda thing.",4.0
"Overall, on taste, this place is 3 stars.  I gave 2 stars because it is ridiculous to wait 30 minutes for 2 plain slices of pizza, pay $5.00 a slice, and because the actual slices are quite small.  Taste wise the pizza is good, I like the basil and parm cheese on the pizza, but did find it to be a little greasy/oily.  I would prefer L&B or Two Boots over Di Fara any day of the week.",2.0
Excellent pizza! The fresh basil really added to the taste. The wait was close to two hours so you have to find things to do but also be back when it comes out of the oven or they will give it away to somebody else. You also run the risk of waiting two hours and getting a burnt pizza which we witnessed. Nice ingredients and hand made.,3.0
"Best pizza I have ever had in my life (and I have eaten a LOT of pizza). No exaggeration. As a native New Yorker I am extremely picky about my pizza - crust needs to be the right balance of crunchy on the outside, moist on the inside, melted cheese that's slightly bubbly and the correct cheese to sauce ratio. We waited almost an hour for this pizza and I don't regret it one bit. If I lived anywhere even remotely close to this place I would eat here every week - at least. If you love pizza and are passionate about fresh ingredients, you MUST go to Di Fara at least once. Don't deprive yourself of this treasure.",5.0

Sitting and waiting for your pizza is its own heavenly experience because you'll find yourself intoxicated by the warm scent of baking crust which is further augmented by the delightful odor of fresh cut basil just after it joins freshly melted cheeses.

"Is this guy the Mozart of pizza?I went to Di Frara's a month or two ago with some friends that know of it.  It certainly is a little expensive and very slow, but we were with someone from out of town and passed the time just fine.  Mostly socializing while watching him, the lone pizza man, churn out pie after pie.  From the numerous articles on the wall, we discovered that he's the only one that makes the pizza and refuses to teach his children.  As I watched him work the dough and toppings, then thoughtfully snip fresh basil just so on cooked pies, I couldn't help but imagine that he sees musical notes or equations fly through the air as he works.The pizza itself is very good, you can taste the difference with their fresh ingredients and special blend of cheeses melted in as well as crumbled on top.  I enjoyed the experience and everyone should go once just to see him work, but due to the time involved I think this may have been a once per lifetime trip.",4.0
"I lived in Brooklyn my whole life and never even heard of this place until recently. The yuppies line up like loyal stooges for an ""authentic new york pizza"" and will wait around like masochists while old man di fara smears his olive oil all over his pizza...in SLOW MOTION. On my way back from a doctors appointment one night, I passed this place and decided to see what the big deal was. I was doing research on some of the great pizzarias of NYC and saw this place listed. The place was officially closed (rope across the doorway) but the window was still open and I asked if thier were any slices left. I was in luck, There was one left over, and seeing that I was outrageously handsome and burning with pure charisma; the lady worker rushed over and put the pizza in the oven for me. A minute later she slid the slice over to me and in a heavy new yawk accent told me it was gonna cost me 5 bucks. 5 bucks? for a slice?? do i look like a tourist to you? I said ""what the hell"" and paid it because NOW I was to damn curious to stop myself. After taking a couple of bites I have to admit..that it was a great slice. Even by NYC standards. Maybe a bit to much olive oil, but still one of the best slices I ever had. Worth 5 bucks? Nah. Worth a half hour/hour wait? nah. not in my opinion. While I believe that Pizza is a great part of NYC heritage, 5 bucks for a plain slice with an hour wait on top of it; sounds ridiculous to me. It prevents me from giving this place 5 stars. Ultimately if you are a out of towner who wants to see what the big deal is and are curious as to what OLD brooklyn pizza tasted like in another era, and you arent put off by the blatant over-charging and long waits, then a slice at DiFaras just might be an offer you can't refuse.",4.0

"We were biking from Fort Tilden yesterday when a friend suggested we stop here on the way back. it was about 6 (they open at 6:30, despite what Yelp says) when we arrived, so we took our place as second in line. There was a sign on the door out front saying that seating had been reserved for the evening, but pizza would be available for take out from the window to the left. Through the window, we could see Domenico DeMarco, the famed pizzaolio who opened Di Fara in 1964, making pizzas at a pace that suggested he was unaware of the line forming out front, and the growing private party inside. This was a good sign. A slightly longer wait for a well-made pie would make the whole experience really worth it, especially after riding my bike for almost 40 miles that whole day. A nice woman in a  gray t-shirt that read ""Di-Fara "" in blue baseball font took our order (large cheese) a few minutes after 6:30. And then we waited. Until 7:30.Now, this pizza literally had to be better than sex. Shortly after we ordered, I texted my girlfriend asking how her day was, to which she plied that it was good and she'd tell me about it when I got home. By the way, she ended, when will you be home? I told her we were stopping for pizza in Midwood and I'd be back in about an hour, more or less. We watched with rising hanger as the party inside devoured slice after slice. After twenty minutes, the woman who took our orders opened the screen on the windows to hand four pizzas to a man who appeared out of nowhere. Call ahead if you can. At that point I'd been in an increasingly frustrating text conversation with my girlfriend. Somewhere along the way we'd miscommunicated--I thought she'd be out with coworkers getting food and drinks after work, but she thought I'd be home around dinner time and we'd eat together, then have sex. Or more likely the other way around. I knew we were going to have sex: we'd talked about it earlier that day, and I was still expecting to. But then she texted me that she was hungry and was in lingerie, and sent a picture. Damn. I need to get home. It was too late for me to bail--at this point I figured it would come out any minute, I could eat and then get home fast, have sex and then eat dinner again (40 miles is a lot of miles to ride on a bike). But still, I didn't want to be the guy who ditches sex for food. She got too hungry to wait for me and, frustratingly cut her losses. Neither of us were particularly happy with the situation, or each other. Midwood is still 8 miles from our apartment. The pizza came out after almost an hour. One friend got a small plastic cup of some hot peppers (get them, not too spicy, but a good flavor). We took it around the corner and sat on the street. I had a lot riding on this pizza. In stopping and waiting for it I had likely foregone sex (really good sex) and made for a very frustrating night. So when we opened the box and saw this masterpiece, with a crispy baked crust, parmesan chunks of plum tomatoes baked on top, and fresh basil, our mouths watered in anticipation. Yes. Incredible. I tried to savor each moment of this pizza, each bite more perfect than the last, but my hunger could not contain me. I devoured three slices in a matter of ten blissful moments of freedom. Sitting on the sidewalk on 15th street outside the flower shop, I could not have asked for a more perfect pizza on a perfect day. While I won't say the pizza was better than sex (and, thank god, we did have sex when I got home), it was pretty far up there. Definitely among of the best pizza I've had in New York CIty. If you've got a few hours to kill, and $28 to spend on a large cheese, this is not a bad way to spend a Wednesday evening.",5.0
"You want good Brooklyn-style pizza made with primo ingredients? Then eat here.You want to fill your gut with Polly-O string cheese on doughy slabs of blah? Then eat at the 2,387 other pizza parlors in town.It ain't rocket science. This is how you do it:Step 1: Order a regular pie[1] at the counter. Step 2: Wait for your pizza.[2] Step 3: Watch the old man remove the hot pie from the oven, top it with freshly-grated Parmigiano-Reggiano, snipped basil leaves, and extra-virgin olive oil.Step 4: Eat.Step 5: Consider moving (back) to Midwood even though you'd be bored out of your mind in the down time waiting to eat Di Fara's pizza again. For me, Di Fara's has all the elements of the Brooklyn pizza par excellence: a thin, chewy crust that's supple enough to fold; specks of black oven char on the bottom of the crust; tangy-sweet tomato sauce; a generous layer of gooey cheese to weigh down the tip of a slice; and that special ""liquid gold""--the pool of orange grease that collects in the creases of the cheese. Yet it's the basil (flown in from Israel) that perfumes the pie with that extra sumthin' sumthin'.On a recent visit with my friend, a funny, chatty guy struck up a conversation with us. He starts name dropping Oprah and cooking for the Governator and Maria Shriver...when it clicks: ""Oh, you're Oprah's personal chef!"" (Art Smith--love this guy! He and his crew were there to shoot Di Fara's for a show on the Discovery Channel.)==============================================[1] Don't be retarded and order a $5-slice when you can just split a pie (8 slices) with a friend for $25.

Had the Sicilian pizza with no toppings. Was pretty good but really not worth the trek to Ave J and the literally 2.5 hour wait. Was a tad greasy and salty too. And pricey.

Not just the food ""thing"" itself. So.....Its a very good pizza. & God I would hope so for $30 a pie or $5 a slice.Fresh dough. Excellent quality  mozzarella. The saucy tomatoes had beautiful tangy flavor. The Basil was bright w a bit of citrus. The char and crunch was varied in spots. Artists w their hands in the paint as it were, creating edible (unpretentious) art.

For me, Di Fara's has all the elements of the Brooklyn pizza par excellence: a thin, chewy crust that's supple enough to fold; specks of black oven char on the bottom of the crust; tangy-sweet tomato sauce; a generous layer of gooey cheese to weigh down the tip of a slice; and that special ""liquid gold""--the pool of orange grease that collects in the creases of the cheese. Yet it's the basil (flown in from Israel) that perfumes the pie with that extra sumthin' sumthin'.On a recent visit with my friend, a funny, chatty guy struck up a conversation with us. He starts name dropping Oprah and cooking for the Governator and Maria Shriver...when it clicks: ""Oh, you're Oprah's personal chef!"" (Art Smith--love this guy! He and his crew were there to shoot Di Fara's for a show on the Discovery Channel.)==============================================[1] Don't be retarded and order a $5-slice when you can just split a pie (8 slices) with a friend for $25. Trust me, you're gonna want more than one slice.[2] We went at 1:15 on a rainy Tuesday and waited just 10 minutes for a pie.",5.0
"Eat It OR Beat It?**EAT IT!!**OK... never have I waited for a pizza for 2.5-3 hrs... until I came to Di Fara's. Worth it? Not if I have to wait 2+ hrs for a whole pizza pie... delicious? yes! And unlike most Yelpers, I am not going to knock down a star because I waited forever. This place was crazy packed and the walls were decorated with dozens of awards! Reason for the long wait is because one older man touches and creates the pizza. Need I say more? CONCLUSION:EAT IT!

Dom DeMarco takes out the pie... and drizzles olive oil and cuts his freshly home grown basil to add to the finishing touches.  It's not the sauce that will get you ... it's the cheese and basil and that fine extra virgin olive oil.  And if you like spicy, he combines olive oil and chili peppers to make the perfect combo.  i can't get enough.  i'm saddened by two facts:1) DeMarco will die with his recipes... he won't share with his son2) Recently closed for a health code violation, but has now reopened as of November 23 after it passed inspection.  despite the past health violations, i will still come back for their deliciousness.",5.0
Had the Sicilian pizza with no toppings. Was pretty good but really not worth the trek to Ave J and the literally 2.5 hour wait. Was a tad greasy and salty too. And pricey. Overall I'm glad I checked this off my NY pizza list but definitely wasn't missing much all these years. Overhyped but would be decent if I lived around the neighborhood and knew when to go without the long wait.,3.0
"Wow. Interesting. I won't bore you with my international pizza jaunting. But perhaps you will review my ""Pizza List"" then you'll be better aquatinted w the fact that I confidently know a good pie when I have one.Typically, the style of my reviews are on the whole pie (double antandra) addressing each componant which makes up the eating exsperience. Not just the food ""thing"" itself. So.....Its a very good pizza. & God I would hope so for $30 a pie or $5 a slice.Fresh dough. Excellent quality  mozzarella. The saucy tomatoes had beautiful tangy flavor. The Basil was bright w a bit of citrus. The char and crunch was varied in spots. Artists w their hands in the paint as it were, creating edible (unpretentious) art. Yet, the hours are unpredictable (which completely sux when it's a sweltering 100 degrees & you've driven 1.5 hrs just to seek this gem out) & then your ""greeted"" by a dirty hand written cardboard sign attached to rope saying @ 4:00 that they are closed & will reopen at 7 when they say they are open til 4:30. They were slightly merciful, let my husband in, order & we ate it on the hood of the car.The establishment itself is antiquated w little or no attention to its cleanlines,  the refrigeration cant keep up w the beverage demand when its hotter than Hades in there so your drinks are luke warm at best, the staff impersonal, intimate seating is being gracious.Is this joint a so called cliched authentic pizza experience?

Stopped by on Halloween with the kids and family from out of town. We were there around 7:00 and we waited well over 35 minutes for the two round pies. Well worth the wait!!  It was delicious the first time I've eaten there a couple of years ago and it's still delicious today. Every pie that was served was made by the man himself. 2 pies and a couple of waters and soda set us back 65 bux.I will continue to stop by as much as I can while the pies are still being served.I walked by the offshoot restaurant they'd just opened on the way to Difara's and it was not busy at all. I'll have to give them a try next time I'm in the neighborhood.,5.0
"After wanting to come here for a couple years, I finally took it upon myself to make the trek out to Brooklyn from Murray Hill (travel time, including transfers, ended up being almost 45 minutes one way). I first heard of Di Fara's from the New York Times article about their $5 slices. Luckily, I didn't encounter the wait that most people seem to have to endure. I arrived a few minutes before the 6 PM reopening, and there were only 2 people in front of me. Although we had to wait 10-15 minutes longer than expected before reopening, it wasn't too bad. Even when I went to order first, there weren't so many people behind me that all the tables were taken; I was still able to score myself a seat so I could sit down and properly enjoy the pizza right after it came out of the oven.Now, for the pizza itself: it's fantastic. I'm not sure I'd rate it higher than Grimaldi's, but the cheese was delicious (and slightly different from most other pizzas I've had). I also think some parmesan was sprinkled on top as well. I didn't get much basil, which was slightly disappointing, but that didn't detract from the quality much. I'm a big fan of the lumpy tomato sauce used; you get some of the actual tomatoes in the slices, which definitely adds some texture to the bite. The crust is a bit thicker than I prefer, but definitely not something that really took away from the flavor.So why the extra star off? Simply put, I don't think it's worth the $5 that each slice cost. It'd be one thing if the flavor was otherworldly good, or if the slices were as large as some of the Ray's joints in the City make them. It's definitely one of the best slices, but I don't think it justifies the price. And if I did have to endure the wait...well, Grimaldi's is plenty bad enough, but I don't know if I could have (or would have) done 1.5-2 hours in a cool fall evening waiting for a couple slices. It's fantastic, and I'll probably go back from time to time, but I doubt I'll make it a regular occurrence to travel that far for the pizza.",4.0

"I keep swearing never to return. It's quite the ordeal: an hour to get there and this time a 1 ¾ hour wait for a couple of little slices, all gone in a few bites. The wait is far from pleasant, what with all the uncontrolled chaos in the packed, sweltering dive. Worse, being given to persecutory ideation, I'm convinced that people who order after I do often get served before I do. And while I can appreciate watching the master craftsman at work (in slow motion), it also disturbs me to see a poor elderly man slaving over a scorching pizza oven all day, hardly how I'd choose to spend my golden years.All of which is to say, Di Fara has a huge hurdle to overcome; it overcomes it handily. What's remarkable isn't how much better it is than the typical pizzeria, but how much better it is than the best of them. For instance, L&B gets a nice sweet flavor in its renowned square pie, yet sweet is the one dimension. Di Fara's taste is far more complex, with (at least) sweet, savory and lactic notes, like the best Italian restaurant food. Suffice it to say this isn't a place where you start sprinkling all the dried seasonings before even tasting your food. The fine ingredients explain only part of what makes it special. Many places chop in fresh basil these days and some purport to use San Marzano tomatoes, but none gets this flavor. One huge difference I notice here is that there aren't separate layers of dough, sauce and cheese; it all somehow melds into one. Another is that Dom isn't afraid to char the crust. Other places will make the pizza hot (if you beg), but never really well done. Anyway, I guess I'll be back next year.",5.0

I went last summer on a Sunday night. There was a line outside waiting for them to open. We ordered a plain round pie for $28 and we got it to go. Yes the slices are expensive and small but i've eaten pizza all over NY and this is some of the best pizza i've ever had.,5.0
"It's a bitch to wait, it's expensive, it's not close by to anything else, it's unorganized, and there is zero ambience, but watching Dom make a pie is magical.  Someone else might grate the cheese, or bring him the dough, but he's the master and no one but the master will actually touch your pie.   And what a pie it is - we got a square pie, because Deanna W. told Lizz K. and I that it was something special, and it was. Just charred enough, thin crisp, and seasoned to perfection,  with tomato sauce tasting only of the brightest tomato, amazing cheese, and creamy, fresh cheese, with basil lovingly hand cut over the top. There is nothing that I could think of to improve this pizza, taste wise, and when it comes to pizza that's the most important thing. I also got a slice of a regular, round pie to go, and it was also pretty damn incredible, even reheated. Don't go hungry, as others have warned - we had almost no one in front of us and STILL had to wait an hour. I think that the round pies come out much faster than square pies do, since the square pies are double baked (to make them uber crispy, I guess). Also dont expect to be comfortable, as you will probably stand for a good long while, and even when you get a seat, it will be cramped and sort of dirty, and uncomfortable and hot. But honestly, once you eat, you won't care. You won't care that you paid $32 for pizza and sodas that arent very cold at all. You won't care that you almost punched someone in the face for chatting at a table after their pizza was done, or that someone took all of the free pickled hot peppers to eat with your pizza and didn't leave you any. All you'll want to do is eat this pizza, forever.",5.0
Maybe it's me but I didn't find anything special about this place. This place is supposed to be a very big deal and I just don't get it. The pizza was good but so not worth the hype. Not worth the price or the longggg wait.,3.0
"Is this the best pizza in all of Brooklyn? YES! When you want to show someone what's so special about New York pizza, is this the place to take them? YES!If this Pizza metamorphosed into a woman would I make love to it? YES!Then you might be asking yourself, ""Why 4 stars?"" Simply put this is pizza and no pizza is worth waiting in line for over an hour while people are trying to steal the pie in front of you while the people who work there have no organization in their establishment.I can care less about the quality of the place. It's a dump and I can care less. I don't mind it's real small. I don't care about the price. It's worth it.Simply put, it's the best tasting pizza around, but it's just not worth the hassle of the wait. On top of the wait, there is no concept of a line and people try to steal pies. Dominick's son does an alright job of keeping everything in order but he still can't do it alone. If his daughter is working the front, forget about it. Complete chaos will ensue. People will try to take your Pizza and if you're like me, you might kill someone if you've been waiting in line for over an hour for a freaking pizza!I would say if you have never have tried it or you want to bring someone who's never tried it before in their life, so you can see their face when they take their first bite, GO! I would suggest trying to make a call in advance but they don't pick up their phone half the time and even if they do they, sometimes just put you in the back of the line once you get there. So a must do for everyone for this is the Mecca of pizza but I don't know if you would really want to relive the voyage.",4.0
"We randomly decided to make the trek here one day, oblivious of the their hours. By chance we arrived at 6:10pm, 20 mins before they opened and 2nd in line. Lucky. Real lucky.We tried 3 different slices, clocking in at $18 in total. You kiddin me? Alright fine, but the pizza better be good. It was. It is. It's almost identical to Lucali's style, which now makes sense after being told that Lucali's owner learned his craft from Di Fara's Dom himself. So the pizza, therefore, is unreal. The olive oil.

"3.5 StarsSome friends rented a car for the day and we decided on driving out to Di Fara to grab a pie.  The drive isn't too bad but from what I hear the long ride on the Q can be unbearable.  What's worse, is that once you get there and place your order, your guaranteed to wait an additional 40 minutes to an hour before you get to eat.Some tips for speedy eating:-The store closes in the afternoon and opens back up for dinner.  Get there around 30 minutes before it reopens.  A line forms at the door, the closer you are to the front the earlier your order gets in.- If the wait for a pie is unbearable, check behind the counter. They usually cook an extra pie for individual slices.  GET THEM!- Bring snacks and possibly a folding chair.  We were 7th in line and waited an hourThe pizza is amazing.  The old guy cooking knows what he is doing.  However he is the only one making pies and only utilizes one of the six ovens so he can only cook two pies at a time.  Though when your pie comes out of the oven and you watch that beautiful old man drizzle extra virgin olive oil, fresh cut basil, and parm cheese over your boiling hot pizza - you tend to let the other things slide.  All in all, the pizza is very good but to trek out there, wait, wait, wait, stuff your face, then trek back may be more trouble than it is worth.",4.0
"Hey sports fans, I love ya!Ever had an experience that shakes your beliefs to the very core?  You know, something that challenges what you've believed your whole life?  Take me for example:  I've always thought that I was the indestructible world champion pizza eater.  Then I went to visit my aunt and uncle in Yankee Candle land, and we had pizza for dinner.  Great, right?  Well, actually no.  Why, because my uncle (21 years my senior) kicked my ass eating pizza.  Seriously.  I had barely finished slice #2, and UR was already on slice #5.  Unbelievable.  I was crushed (well, not enough to give up eating pizza), but crushed all the same.  I'm still in awe of my uncle.  He's the real Mr Pizza Man.Can't relate?  Well, what about when you learned that Santa Claus didn't make his own toys or ride around the entire world in 24 hours (sorry if you didn't know that before)?  Actually, I thought that was the case when I was about 10 or 11, when I started getting clothes instead of cool presents for Christmas.  But it wasn't till a couple of years ago that I found out for real.  Total bummer.So, why does all this matter?  Glad you asked.  I was on my annual pizza safari to New York, the pizza home of the universe, with my favorite cousin of all time Smokin' Hot Stephanie, Super Woman.  Ironically, SHS's father is Mr. Pizza Man.  So, back to the safari.  Blossom and I have crissed-crossed four of the five boroughs of the Big Apple in search of the best pizza in the universe.  We had a long held belief that the title of best pizza in the universe was at Totonno's on Neptune in Brooklyn.  Truthfully, it's been about 5 years since we were there, but still, nothing else has topped this long-held, bedrock belief, until now.I heard about this little place in Midwood Brooklyn from Big Jersey Hair, so Blossom and I hit the Q train to check it out.  So here's this great pizza place right in the middle of an orthodox jewish neighborhood.  Just a little hole in the wall with a couple of tables.  We didn't have to wait long, but without a doubt, whatever the wait, it's worth it.  This pizza is incredible .  Made by Dom DeMarco for like forever.  The story is that Dom is the only one who knows the secret recipe for the pizza, and it's been said that he's taking it to his grave with him.  In Italy, we call this Omerta, the code of Silence.Okay, the pizza:  just the right amount of crust, very tasty pizza sauce, and fresh ingredients.  How fresh?  He grows basil right in the window of his shop.We get the pep and black olive.  The little puff of smoke when he opens the over door means your pie is ready, almost.  When the pie comes out, he sprinkles the top with fresh grated grana padano (first cousin to parmigiano reggiano).  Then he cuts up fresh basil and puts it on top the the grana padano.  Then he lightly sprinkles EVOO (extra virgin olive oil) over the entire pie.  You cannot believe how great it tastes, from the first bite to the last slice.  The fresh basil brings out the light taste of the EVOO, and everything is complemented by the pizza sauce, which is not too tangy, just right.I'm frickin dreaming about this pizza.  Me and Blossom have been debating this for the past 24 hours.  We're having a hard time wrapping our arms around the possibility that DiFara's is better than Totonno's.But it may just be.  I give it my highest rating, five basil plants.  Plus, Mr. DeMarco invited me behind the counter to take a picture of him and I in front of the ovens.",5.0
"I keep swearing never to return. It's quite the ordeal: an hour to get there and this time a 1 ¾ hour wait for a couple of little slices, all gone in a few bites. The wait is far from pleasant, what with all the uncontrolled chaos in the packed, sweltering dive. Worse, being given to persecutory ideation, I'm convinced that people who order after I do often get served before I do. And while I can appreciate watching the master craftsman at work (in slow motion), it also disturbs me to see a poor elderly man slaving over a scorching pizza oven all day, hardly how I'd choose to spend my golden years.All of which is to say, Di Fara has a huge hurdle to overcome; it overcomes it handily. What's remarkable isn't how much better it is than the typical pizzeria, but how much better it is than the best of them. For instance, L&B gets a nice sweet flavor in its renowned square pie, yet sweet is the one dimension. Di Fara's taste is far more complex, with (at least) sweet, savory and lactic notes, like the best Italian restaurant food. Suffice it to say this isn't a place where you start sprinkling all the dried seasonings before even tasting your food. The fine ingredients explain only part of what makes it special. Many places chop in fresh basil these days and some purport to use San Marzano tomatoes, but none gets this flavor. One huge difference I notice here is that there aren't separate layers of dough, sauce and cheese; it all somehow melds into one. Another is that Dom isn't afraid to char the crust. Other places will make the pizza hot (if you beg), but never really well done. Anyway, I guess I'll be back next year.",5.0
"The best pizza I've ever had! We got lucky and didn't have to wait, there is usually a long line, but trust me its worth the wait.",5.0
Well worth the wait! Will happily wait again for another pie! I think this is better than Grimaldis and one of the best i've had in New York!,5.0
I went last summer on a Sunday night. There was a line outside waiting for them to open. We ordered a plain round pie for $28 and we got it to go. Yes the slices are expensive and small but i've eaten pizza all over NY and this is some of the best pizza i've ever had.,5.0
"It's a bitch to wait, it's expensive, it's not close by to anything else, it's unorganized, and there is zero ambience, but watching Dom make a pie is magical.  Someone else might grate the cheese, or bring him the dough, but he's the master and no one but the master will actually touch your pie.   And what a pie it is - we got a square pie, because Deanna W. told Lizz K. and I that it was something special, and it was. Just charred enough, thin crisp, and seasoned to perfection,  with tomato sauce tasting only of the brightest tomato, amazing cheese, and creamy, fresh cheese, with basil lovingly hand cut over the top. There is nothing that I could think of to improve this pizza, taste wise, and when it comes to pizza that's the most important thing. I also got a slice of a regular, round pie to go, and it was also pretty damn incredible, even reheated. Don't go hungry, as others have warned - we had almost no one in front of us and STILL had to wait an hour. I think that the round pies come out much faster than square pies do, since the square pies are double baked (to make them uber crispy, I guess). Also dont expect to be comfortable, as you will probably stand for a good long while, and even when you get a seat, it will be cramped and sort of dirty, and uncomfortable and hot. But honestly, once you eat, you won't care. You won't care that you paid $32 for pizza and sodas that arent very cold at all. You won't care that you almost punched someone in the face for chatting at a table after their pizza was done, or that someone took all of the free pickled hot peppers to eat with your pizza and didn't leave you any. All you'll want to do is eat this pizza, forever.",5.0
Maybe it's me but I didn't find anything special about this place. This place is supposed to be a very big deal and I just don't get it. The pizza was good but so not worth the hype. Not worth the price or the longggg wait.,3.0
"Is this the best pizza in all of Brooklyn? YES! When you want to show someone what's so special about New York pizza, is this the place to take them? YES!If this Pizza metamorphosed into a woman would I make love to it? YES!Then you might be asking yourself, ""Why 4 stars?"" Simply put this is pizza and no pizza is worth waiting in line for over an hour while people are trying to steal the pie in front of you while the people who work there have no organization in their establishment.I can care less about the quality of the place. It's a dump and I can care less. I don't mind it's real small. I don't care about the price. It's worth it.Simply put, it's the best tasting pizza around, but it's just not worth the hassle of the wait. On top of the wait, there is no concept of a line and people try to steal pies. Dominick's son does an alright job of keeping everything in order but he still can't do it alone. If his daughter is working the front, forget about it. Complete chaos will ensue. People will try to take your Pizza and if you're like me, you might kill someone if you've been waiting in line for over an hour for a freaking pizza!I would say if you have never have tried it or you want to bring someone who's never tried it before in their life, so you can see their face when they take their first bite, GO! I would suggest trying to make a call in advance but they don't pick up their phone half the time and even if they do they, sometimes just put you in the back of the line once you get there. So a must do for everyone for this is the Mecca of pizza but I don't know if you would really want to relive the voyage.",4.0
"We randomly decided to make the trek here one day, oblivious of the their hours. By chance we arrived at 6:10pm, 20 mins before they opened and 2nd in line. Lucky. Real lucky.We tried 3 different slices, clocking in at $18 in total. You kiddin me? Alright fine, but the pizza better be good. It was. It is. It's almost identical to Lucali's style, which now makes sense after being told that Lucali's owner learned his craft from Di Fara's Dom himself. So the pizza, therefore, is unreal. The olive oil. The basil. The garlic.To enjoy virtually the same amazing pizza, but with BYOB and candlelight, i'll take Lucali's every time. One star off for paying $6 per slice.",4.0

"If you are looking for the best pizza you can put in your mouth, Di Fara is the place to go. Getting off the Avenue J stop, it is situated on the corner with an old yet bold sign that reads PIZZA. Perhaps an even more telling sign that you have come to the right place is the crowd of people waiting outside what looks, to the untrained eye, like another run-down pizza establishment. Once inside, however, your pizza journey begins..Your first conquest is waiting in line. Expect at least a minimal wait in off hours and up to a substantial wait during peak hours. As your turn arrives, tell the nice lady what you would like to order. While there are a variety of toppings, combinations, and cuts, do not fret as they are all something to try. The prices are steep...$5 for a regular plain slice and $28 for a pie. That is a premium price but expect no less than a premium slice/pie. The lady will take your name and write down your order.Now comes your second and perhaps most challenging conquest, which is waiting for your food. This wait can last anywhere between 30-60 minutes. What you do as you watch others get their beautifully made pizzas is entirely up to you. Your favorite tunes and some companionship will help to ease this leg of the journey. Make sure you are around to hear your name being called. It will happen, and when it does, you can finally get to the best part.It is time to eat! But before you chow down, take a moment to take a look at what is front of you. In a paper plate is the best pizza New York has to offer. Nobody but Mr. DeMarco knows exactly what makes it so special. Is it the freshly cut basil that adds that extra flavor? Or perhaps the drizzle of olive oil in the sauce? Maybe it is that delicate sprinkle of Parmesan cheese. It could be all of these things. Whatever it is, it tastes darn good. Your first bites of the pizza melts every other thought away. The hour-long wait you just endured? Gone. The $5 you had to cough up per slice? Gone. You are left with thoughts of nothing but the finest combination of crust, cheese, sauce, and toppings running through your mouth. After finishing the pizza, however, some may have realized their journey has ended. One may find oneself to experience mild depression. This is of course until you realize that another $5 could buy you another 5 minutes in pizza heaven.

"OK, here's the 781st Yelp review of this place. I went on a Friday for my very first time and thought it was absolutely great! A ROYAL pain in the ass to get to (we drove), but well worth the adventure.Turns out our timing was perfect in every regard as far as our visit went. We arrived promptly at 2 PM and found a free parking spot a mere block and a half away. When we came in, there were about six patrons in line in front of us. It turned out they were alI just waiting for slices though, and Mr. Pizza just happened to be pulling out a pie for slices from the oven right when we walked in. The small line sped along and I ordered a ""square pie"" to stay. Old ""Mr. Pizza"", Dom de Marco went to work on it immediately and 15 minutes later we were eating it.It was fascinating to watch this man work. He brought out a slightly pre-baked long rectangular crust in a pan with a little bit of sauce spread out on it. He then grabbed one of those four sided cheese graters like your mom uses and sliced up a bunch of fresh mozzarella onto the pie. After that, he ladled a bunch more perfectly tangy tomato sauce onto it. Finally, he grabbed a ball of fresh mozzarella di bufala, drained it of it's water and tore it up all over the pie, sprinkled some soft sharp grated cheese all over it, drizzled it with copious amounts of olive oil and shoved it into the oven.He pulled it out after a few minutes (with his bare hands!!!) and here's where most of the magic occurred: he sprinkled the hot pie with more finely grated sharp soft cheese and then, cut with a scissors all over the pie, sprigs of fresh basil and oregano that he grew himself. That did it!When I took my first bite, I was all of a sudden 11 years old again, eating pizza in NYC back when NYC pizza was good! There's no way to describe the experience of eating a Dom de Marco pizza. The most profoundly intimate thing I can say about eating this pie is that you can really taste the love that went into making it. I don't mean to be cliche or maudlin, but the taste of love really comes through in this food! So much different than most restaurant food experiences that I've sadly grown used to these days. This is old fashioned NYC pizza in it's most classic form and I would highly recommend getting down there for some while he's still making it.Q train stops one block over.",5.0

"Yeah, yeah...a slice will set you back five bucks and a cheese pie will cost you $25. But Di Fara's is leagues beyond your typical slice shop or take out pizza joint. When you walk in, there is no line, just a mob of people waiting to place an order. It's almost like a bar, with only the most assertive making their way to the counter. Forty minutes isn't too bad of a wait for pizza, if we had to wait two hours, I might've needed a beer. Make that an entire six pack. Coming into this place, you know the wait is gonna be long and sweaty. It's hot and there's one old man making pizza at his own place. But damn, just enjoy your time with friends and take in the sights, smells and actions in the joint.The pizza. Mmm. The pizza. That's what makes it all worth it. This isn't a pizza you order out for a drunken movie night chronicling the illustrious career of Steven Seagal. No, you sit and enjoy the shit outta every bite of this pizza. DiFara's pizza has the perfect marriage between the three main ingredients of bread, sauce and cheese.  The crust is appropriately thin, with excellent crisp and lots of slightly charred portions. Delicious, slightly salty cheese. Minimal grease. Sauce that isn't sweet and has the flavor of fresh tomato.Combining quality ingredients and perfect execution, DiFara's creates a pie at the highest level of the New York form. Sure, it's pricey, but every once and awhile it's nice to spend a few extra bucks for the extra quality.",5.0
"I went here once over the summer when I had a lot of free time on a lazy Sunday afternoon. It's good that I had a lot of free time cause this trip took the entire afternoon of waiting. When we were finally done waiting, my friend and I shared the entire pie. This was probably the greasiest pizza I've ever had in my life, and I do not intend to say that as a positive point. The greasiness was nauseating and I had to wick off a lot of it to make the pizza edible. Once the grease was mostly absorbed though, the crust was very thin and crunchy, and the cheese, tomato sauce and fresh basil were delicious. If it weren't for the pools of olive oil on top, it would have been the perfect slice.Admittedly, the pizza was pretty good, but I don't think the trip was worth the interminable wait. Given the historic value of this pizzeria, I would say that maybe its worth one trip when it's rainy and you really don't have anything else to do. However, you should leave it to that one trip.",2.0
i visited this place after hearing of all the talk about how good there pizza was.We were disappointed with both service and pizza and extremely pricy.  A regular pie was $32.00 with topping's $45.00 for pizza come on.  The calzones were $32.00 each. The place was dirty and needs a total makeover from floor to ceiling.  TThey also need extra help with serving so many customers. The location is a block from the train station but very crowded area.  The sanitary conditions were poor there rating is still pending after 6 months. The owner pit man needs to wash his hands after handling the pies that he produces. He also uses a scissor to cut fresh basil as the pies come out of the oven and sprinkles oil all over the pie making is soupy. The server grinds cheese with his hands and handles the exchange of money as the orders come out. What I place the slices are $5.00 each this place needs a lot of clean up and out of the building. I would not come back at all. With so many wonderful pizza parlors in Brooklyn to choose from.,2.0
"I read on Thrillist NYC Di Fara Pizza was ranked the best pizza in NYC and I've hear for the past two years living in Brooklyn it's one of the best around. I went there 9/6/13 and wasn't sure what to expect. I waited nearly 70mins  before getting my slices. The pizza is fresh out the oven and so many people ordered by the pie that is part of the reason for the wait. I had 2 slices with sausage  and they were good. The basil on the slice does ad a bit of flavor to. It's the wait that sucks. I understand it's busy there but the process is slow there. It's also tough to justify spending $5 a slice add another $1 for the sausage topping, especially since the slices are not as big as you would expect. If you have time to kill and $$$ to spend it worth checking out.",4.0

He brought out a slightly pre-baked long rectangular crust in a pan with a little bit of sauce spread out on it. He then grabbed one of those four sided cheese graters like your mom uses and sliced up a bunch of fresh mozzarella onto the pie. After that, he ladled a bunch more perfectly tangy tomato sauce onto it. Finally, he grabbed a ball of fresh mozzarella di bufala, drained it of it's water and tore it up all over the pie, sprinkled some soft sharp grated cheese all over it, drizzled it with copious amounts of olive oil and shoved it into the oven.He pulled it out after a few minutes (with his bare hands!!!) and here's where most of the magic occurred: he sprinkled the hot pie with more finely grated sharp soft cheese and then, cut with a scissors all over the pie, sprigs of fresh basil and oregano that he grew himself. That did it!When I took my first bite, I was all of a sudden 11 years old again, eating pizza in NYC back when NYC pizza was good! There's no way to describe the experience of eating a Dom de Marco pizza. The most profoundly intimate thing I can say about eating this pie is that you can really taste the love that went into making it. I don't mean to be cliche or maudlin, but the taste of love really comes through in this food! So much different than most restaurant food experiences that I've sadly grown used to these days. This is old fashioned NYC pizza in it's most classic form and I would highly recommend getting down there for some while he's still making it.Q train stops one block over.",5.0

"Yeah, yeah...a slice will set you back five bucks and a cheese pie will cost you $25. But Di Fara's is leagues beyond your typical slice shop or take out pizza joint. When you walk in, there is no line, just a mob of people waiting to place an order. It's almost like a bar, with only the most assertive making their way to the counter. Forty minutes isn't too bad of a wait for pizza, if we had to wait two hours, I might've needed a beer. Make that an entire six pack. Coming into this place, you know the wait is gonna be long and sweaty. It's hot and there's one old man making pizza at his own place. But damn, just enjoy your time with friends and take in the sights, smells and actions in the joint.The pizza. Mmm. The pizza. That's what makes it all worth it. This isn't a pizza you order out for a drunken movie night chronicling the illustrious career of Steven Seagal. No, you sit and enjoy the shit outta every bite of this pizza. DiFara's pizza has the perfect marriage between the three main ingredients of bread, sauce and cheese.  The crust is appropriately thin, with excellent crisp and lots of slightly charred portions. Delicious, slightly salty cheese. Minimal grease. Sauce that isn't sweet and has the flavor of fresh tomato.Combining quality ingredients and perfect execution, DiFara's creates a pie at the highest level of the New York form. Sure, it's pricey, but every once and awhile it's nice to spend a few extra bucks for the extra quality.",5.0
"I went here once over the summer when I had a lot of free time on a lazy Sunday afternoon. It's good that I had a lot of free time cause this trip took the entire afternoon of waiting. When we were finally done waiting, my friend and I shared the entire pie. This was probably the greasiest pizza I've ever had in my life, and I do not intend to say that as a positive point. The greasiness was nauseating and I had to wick off a lot of it to make the pizza edible. Once the grease was mostly absorbed though, the crust was very thin and crunchy, and the cheese, tomato sauce and fresh basil were delicious. If it weren't for the pools of olive oil on top, it would have been the perfect slice.Admittedly, the pizza was pretty good, but I don't think the trip was worth the interminable wait. Given the historic value of this pizzeria, I would say that maybe its worth one trip when it's rainy and you really don't have anything else to do. However, you should leave it to that one trip.",2.0
i visited this place after hearing of all the talk about how good there pizza was.We were disappointed with both service and pizza and extremely pricy.  A regular pie was $32.00 with topping's $45.00 for pizza come on.  The calzones were $32.00 each. The place was dirty and needs a total makeover from floor to ceiling.  TThey also need extra help with serving so many customers. The location is a block from the train station but very crowded area.  The sanitary conditions were poor there rating is still pending after 6 months. The owner pit man needs to wash his hands after handling the pies that he produces. He also uses a scissor to cut fresh basil as the pies come out of the oven and sprinkles oil all over the pie making is soupy. The server grinds cheese with his hands and handles the exchange of money as the orders come out. What I place the slices are $5.00 each this place needs a lot of clean up and out of the building. I would not come back at all. With so many wonderful pizza parlors in Brooklyn to choose from.,2.0
"I read on Thrillist NYC Di Fara Pizza was ranked the best pizza in NYC and I've hear for the past two years living in Brooklyn it's one of the best around. I went there 9/6/13 and wasn't sure what to expect. I waited nearly 70mins  before getting my slices. The pizza is fresh out the oven and so many people ordered by the pie that is part of the reason for the wait. I had 2 slices with sausage  and they were good. The basil on the slice does ad a bit of flavor to. It's the wait that sucks. I understand it's busy there but the process is slow there. It's also tough to justify spending $5 a slice add another $1 for the sausage topping, especially since the slices are not as big as you would expect. If you have time to kill and $$$ to spend it worth checking out.",4.0
"I admit I was dubious when I trekked out to DI Fara to try the famous pie. I walked in, waited in line and felt cranky...that is until I laid eyes on Dom DeMarco making those exquisite pizzas. He takes such care with them, and handles steaming pizzas with no protection whatsoever. His bare hands so callused from years of pizza art, that he just doesn't need it anymore. And, the wait...yes, it sucks. But to see pizza art in action? Well, just give it a try. The pie is so good, when I finally tried it I forgot that I had waited so long. All was forgiven. All was forgotten. And my mind was full of spicy sauce, cheesy cheese and the aroma of pizza done just right. True art.",4.0
"I can't believe I was even momentarily concerned that this would top the pizza on Arthur Ave.  The pizza was absolutely sodden with grease.  Thin crust pizza's don't travel well, but these slices weren't able to keep their composure several minutes out of the oven.  What wasn't completely chewy and saturated in grease was charred to a crisp.  The mozzarella used on the pizza was easily something I could have picked up in Pathmark.  There was practically no sauce of the slice.  Also, the slices were TINY and five bucks a pop.  My boyfriend got sick after eating his two slices.This slab of grease would be perfect as a hangover cure, maybe, but you'd have to still be drunk to fork over 5 dollars a slice.  Oh yeah, and to top it off, the ladies working behind the counter were rude.",1.0
"I don't want to be a Debbie Downer but...I don't get the hype about this place AT ALL.I'm a born and raised Brooklyn girl, so I feel like I have an authority on what makes a good NY slice delicious: thin crunchy crust, tomato sauce where you can taste the freshness of the tomatoes, melty gooey mozz cheese.  Those are simple, yet delicious aspects of a good NY slice.To be fair, I tried a sicilian slice and a round slice.  I wasn't impressed with either.  The round slice was tiny, like it was meant for a small child AND it was $5 with no toppings - just a plain cheese slice.  It was SUPER oily to begin with (I blame the type of cheese they use) and then they add additional olive oil and a couple of small pieces of basil.  The slice was so sopping with oil, that when I picked it up, it couldn't support itself and I had to go the 2 hand method.  Lame.  Where's the crunch?The square was way too saucy for me, which again makes the crunch factor non-existent.  Again with the oil!  Why so much oil??I've def had far better.  Glad I tried it once, but do not plan to go back.  Especially for over an hour wait (which sounds like a good deal compared to some of these other reviews) no where to sit and an ambiance that makes me feel like I'm in my great great great grandmother's house that hasn't been rennovated since the dawn of time.  Some say that offers character, some say that's just grimy.Peace out Di Fara, you won't trick me again into your long wait time and pricey oil with a side of soggy pizza!",2.0

"Over the last 6 months or so, my friends and I have been on a quest to find the best slice of pizza in NYC by trying 16 different highly rated places. Di Fara's was one of them. I made the trek out to Midwood walked into Di Fara's and my eyes immediately started burning from the gusts of smoke in the dining area. It was packed, my party had to stand for about 20 minutes before getting a table. It takes about 45 mins to an hour to get your pizza, we ordered 2 pies, one with cheese and one with mushrooms and garlic. Just as my stomach started eating my back, the pizza was ready. Pretty thin crust, half of which was charred on both pizzas. The cheese was good, not too much of it. The distinguishing characteristic of the pizza was the basil. It was cut fresh by a really old italian guy at the counter. The pizza was also a little too greasy, as if they poured olive oil over the top of it. Overall, I wouldn't make the trek out to Midwood just for this pizza, and they are about $30 a pop, and its not a comfortable place to enjoy your pizza.",3.0
"After going to Di Fara's, I can understand where it gets its reputation from.  I'm originally from right by here actually, and back in the day Di Fara's was nothing special.  When I say this I mean no disrespect to Dom DeMarco, but the main reason its so popular is that it's one of the last of the great Brooklyn pizzerias that used to dot every other corner.  That era is gone, but he is one of the few that can still make pizza of that type and quality.  Not surprisingly, by upgrading his ingredients from the old days, he now has the best pizza in the city.  If you don't want to wait in line, don't come.  If you don't have the time to wait for your pie, don't come.  If you can't navigate the ordering process (not exactly rocket science), don't come.  If you're a hipster, don't come.  If you can't stand eating in a less than clean place, don't come.  If you can't tell Dom to skip the extra olive oil at the end, then don't come.  If you read all of the stuff about this place and see things like this that make you think you might not like it, then don't come.  Makes the line shorter for the rest of us and saves you a trip to eastern Brooklyn.  All of that said, this trashes nearly every other pizza in the city.  I've had nearly all of the of-the-moment pies listed in a few publications recently--Keste, Motorino, etc.--and Di Fara's blows them out of the water.  Those places lose themselves in their own hype and in trying to live up to some imaginary ""Neapolitan pizza"" ideal.  The ultimate thing that makes a pizza the best is how it tastes.  That is where Di Fara's excels.  The 3-cheese combo of mozzarella, mozzarella di bufala, and parmesean is the best in the city.  The sauce is perfectly flavorful and spiced, and balances well with the cheese.  The crust is thin and delicious, with a nice amount of char and smokiness.  The pepperoni was among the best I've had (seriously).  The basil is nice and flavorful...writing this review makes me want to go there now.  Its that perfect, and it lives up to the hype.  I've never had a bad pie here, but I will respond to a few complaints here.  One, he does use too much olive oil sometimes, but you need to watching always for your pie and then just tell him to only put a little bit on.  He does burn the crust a little bit too much sometimes, but in my experience its never been to an barely edible level.  If he did, hey this is Brooklyn: bring it to his attention, and if he doesn't want to rectify it, walk out.  In regards to the freshness, he gets deliveries every few days, other than that I could care less if they're 'fresh from the garden' or not.  One problem I have is the BYOB policy.  Its nice that they have this, but some people get absolutely trashed in there and its ridiculous.  Don't be one of those people.  Will this be the best pizza in NY for years to come?  I don't know, there are some pizzerias creeping up on Di Fara's in quality and Mr. DeMarco isn't immortal.  But for now, Dom DeMarco is unequaled.",5.0

After the haul up the parkway over the whitestone bridge and into the bowels of Brooklyn We found the oasis of pizza called Di Fara!Well it is hot as the ovens in there, there is about 4-5 tables strewn into the corner but if you are patient you can enjoy your pizza with the crown around you looking jelous and watching the fresh basil that Dom just snipped onto your pie meld into the cheese.We opted for the regular pie although upon seeing the ""square"" pie I wish i had gone with that one! When Dom took one of the square pies from the oven the oil would hit the hot pan and fill the place up with smoke! Once your eyes got used to the tearing and irritation it actually becomes part of the charm. the pie we had was with porcini mushroom mozzerella and a drizzle of olive oil and snipped fresh basil at the end.Oh so good! My friend and I ate it like it was an appetizer and surely could have polished off another. It's a small place but the hustle and bustle is key. On ave J in a very small corner you roll in tell his daugter what you want, she writes it in a notebook and calls your name when the pie is ready. I didnt see anyone but Dom make, bake, and cut the pizza himself! There is a wait even if you order and the place isnt too busy I think he likes to make the pies one at a time. but the ambience of a time lost and the people that gather there will keep you occupied until the round plate of deliciousness is in front of you waiting to be devoured!Great place  the walls are adorned with plaques and articles it doesnt get any better!

I recently saw a show where restaurant patrons visited a restaurant with fairly inexpensive meals with non-fancy sounding names and a restaurant with higher priced items and dishes with fancy sounding names.  The patrons at the latter place gave much higher ratings to their meals than those that visited the former.  The catch?  Both restaurants served the exact same thing.  People at the fancier sounding place rated their meals more highly because they followed the group dynamic and felt that's what was expected of them.That's DiFara for you.  The slices are fine.  Not amazing.  Not bad.  Certainly not worth the ridiculously long wait.  And certainly not worth the $5 the old man has now started charging.  $5 a slice?  Are you kidding me?  I guess it's NY and the old guy is smart.  He knows there's a sucker born every minute and willing to pay.  Now what should be my scheme to sucker all the faux New Yorkers into giving me their money...?  ;-),2.0
"I find the greatest difficulty with being exposed to greatness is that you can no longer tolerate mediocrity following said exposure. My concern in schlepping out to Di Fara was not that it would fall in the mediocre bracket but that instead it would make my pizza eating elsewhere increasingly difficult. It's fair to say that is what in fact occurred.The restaurant front of Di Fara is unassuming and in no way indicative of what lies inside. If you were walking along the street, you would most likely continue to walk, never realizing the live art gallery you had just passed. Fortunately, I was with a veteran pizza eater who knew better. Bless you, Adam.I watched Dom work his magic for over an hour, and can I just say that I did not mind the wait? I definitely was dying to bite into one of the glorious-looking pies, but watching Dom was like watching Michelangelo sculpt using Carrara marble. Dom takes the resources of the earth and creates something unforgettable. His experienced fingers formed the dough, lovingly swirled olive oil, and tossed a ball's worth of freshly sliced mozzarella and Grana Padano on each canvas of dough. Literally, fresh sliced and grated for each pie. I marvelled that Dom put so much care and attention into each order. No vat of premade dough balls, sliced mozzarella, grated Grana Padano, or cut basil would do. Which is why I am more than happy to pay $25 for a plain pizza here. Not only is the quality amazing but the workmanship and artistry is all part of the value.My conclusion? Fantastic pizza. I don't even like whole tomatoes but I absolutely loved the roasted cherry tomatoes. They softly burst in my mouth with a savory wash of tomato juice and pulp. What put it over the top was the basil that unleashed its clean aromatic scent as it was snipped and tossed on a brown bubbling pizza. If you are in the New York City area, please go. You won't be sorry. And its much friendlier to the pocket than a trip to Naples when the craving hits.",5.0
"The pizza that my friend and I got were a bit off. It was way too thin. There was not enough cheese :(  Unfortunately for us, the owner had to make about 5-6 pizza pies while I was there.

"The pizza of my dreams. I tried time and time again for about two years to come to this famed institution, and each time, the line was out the door (i refuse to wait), and/or there was no parking in the area. Finally, on a brilliant Sunday afternoon soon after the 1pm opening time, I made it. I was thrilled there were only about 3 people in line. After ordering, it soon sank in that EACH pie was handmade, and made to order, so even though it was only a 5-minute wait to order, it was probably about 45 minutes until the pie was ready. Dom, the pizza master, methodically makes each pie, deliberately stretching the dough and lovingly dressing it with a ladle of the most fantastically flavorful sauce, shaving thick slices of fresh mozz from high quality balls of mozz, and giving each pie a sprinkling of freshly grated romano and a drizzle of high quality olive oil before easing it into the oven. When the pie is ready, he TAKES THE PIE OUT WITH BARE HANDS, gives it another palmful of freshly grated romano and drizzle of olive oil, and then cuts fresh basil onto the pie. Voila. The pizza of my dreams. From one perfectionist to another, I totally respect that Dom personally makes each pie, bringing quality control to a whole new level. He doesn't skimp on using only the finest ingredients, and his efforts are immediately evident. Even the crust was delicious! I was worried my expectations had risen too high, but in actuality, this pizza exceeded everything I could have imagined tasting in a pizza.$5 for a slice. $28 for a regular pie, $32 for a sicillian. The slices are modestly sized, and you'll want more than one. Gotta get a whole pie!",5.0
"I have died, and gone to PIZZA HEAVEN...I must say that I didn't wait all that long..about 15-20 minutes for a pie on a Thursday night. Seriously though, unlike any other NYC pizza experience I've ever had. After ordering my pie, I grabbed some modelo especial's at the supermarket across the street. No one seemed to mind I was enjoying a cocktail while I waited. This place is a dump.. seriously you would never expect something so delicious and amazing to come out of here. The interior hasn't changed a bit since the place opened god knows how long ago. All of that is superficial to the product, I was memorized watching the boiling cheesey goodness come out of the oven (check out the picture's I've included).There is one old Italian man that makes the pizza. They average about 20 pies and hour (I asked!). Keep in mind this place is only open for 3 hours in the evening - 6pm - 9pm!

"The rating would have been 4 stars however half the pizza was burnt so it gets half the score - 2 stars...The half of the pizza that wasn't burnt was exceptional - as good as pizza gets.  The generous addition of salty parmesan cheese and sweet fresh cut basil right over the top at the end made the perfect topping to the a pizza masterpiece.  However as mentioned above, burning the pizza ruined any hope of enjoying the second half.  I won't be going back - but if you make the trek, and see the bottom of your pizza is burnt - GIVE IT BACK!  Paying $28 for the pie (tax included) should mean that you can enjoy the entire pie.  They are going to keep serving the burnt pizza till you guys say enough is enough and refuse to pay for it... I saw a few other pies come out that were in worse off shape then our.  Definitely regret not giving them the advice I'm giving you - I think I didn't out of respect for how old the owner is...",2.0
I recently saw a show where restaurant patrons visited a restaurant with fairly inexpensive meals with non-fancy sounding names and a restaurant with higher priced items and dishes with fancy sounding names.  The patrons at the latter place gave much higher ratings to their meals than those that visited the former.  The catch?  Both restaurants served the exact same thing.  People at the fancier sounding place rated their meals more highly because they followed the group dynamic and felt that's what was expected of them.That's DiFara for you.  The slices are fine.  Not amazing.  Not bad.  Certainly not worth the ridiculously long wait.  And certainly not worth the $5 the old man has now started charging.  $5 a slice?  Are you kidding me?  I guess it's NY and the old guy is smart.  He knows there's a sucker born every minute and willing to pay.  Now what should be my scheme to sucker all the faux New Yorkers into giving me their money...?  ;-),2.0
"I find the greatest difficulty with being exposed to greatness is that you can no longer tolerate mediocrity following said exposure. My concern in schlepping out to Di Fara was not that it would fall in the mediocre bracket but that instead it would make my pizza eating elsewhere increasingly difficult. It's fair to say that is what in fact occurred.The restaurant front of Di Fara is unassuming and in no way indicative of what lies inside. If you were walking along the street, you would most likely continue to walk, never realizing the live art gallery you had just passed. Fortunately, I was with a veteran pizza eater who knew better. Bless you, Adam.I watched Dom work his magic for over an hour, and can I just say that I did not mind the wait? I definitely was dying to bite into one of the glorious-looking pies, but watching Dom was like watching Michelangelo sculpt using Carrara marble. Dom takes the resources of the earth and creates something unforgettable. His experienced fingers formed the dough, lovingly swirled olive oil, and tossed a ball's worth of freshly sliced mozzarella and Grana Padano on each canvas of dough. Literally, fresh sliced and grated for each pie. I marvelled that Dom put so much care and attention into each order. No vat of premade dough balls, sliced mozzarella, grated Grana Padano, or cut basil would do. Which is why I am more than happy to pay $25 for a plain pizza here. Not only is the quality amazing but the workmanship and artistry is all part of the value.My conclusion? Fantastic pizza. I don't even like whole tomatoes but I absolutely loved the roasted cherry tomatoes. They softly burst in my mouth with a savory wash of tomato juice and pulp. What put it over the top was the basil that unleashed its clean aromatic scent as it was snipped and tossed on a brown bubbling pizza. If you are in the New York City area, please go. You won't be sorry. And its much friendlier to the pocket than a trip to Naples when the craving hits.",5.0
"The pizza that my friend and I got were a bit off. It was way too thin. There was not enough cheese :(  Unfortunately for us, the owner had to make about 5-6 pizza pies while I was there. He was probably in a hurry. So I figured this is why he wasn't up to his best. (But $5 for a super thin slice?!)The positive side is I do LOVE the taste of the pizza for the most part. I still love you Di Fara!",3.0

For a second, I actually thought Dom was going to throw away the burnt pizzas. I mean, why the hell would you serve really burnt, tasteless pizza? But NOPE, he still sold those pies to some poor people. He drizzles HELLA olive oil and scissors basil on top of each pie. Each slice is different in that it could be soaking in olive oil and/or you may have a little piece of basil. This inconsistency sucks. I was praying my slice wouldn't be burnt but a part of it was. The areas that wasn't burnt was great but not the burnt areas. The crust was crunchy and had the perfect amount of ingredients. Was it memorable? Somewhat. Sorry, Dom, but I won't be returning to your pizzeria. I can see why you got closed down from the Health Department for several days. The restaurant and their aprons are a filthy mess.

"It was a random weekday and we drove out to Midwood so we could get some real pizza.  In the morning, we starved ourselves by snacking on some Russian fast food and did some pre-summer tanning at Brighton Beach.  I forgot how much I missed that area, so many interesting people walking on the beach!Anyway, back to the pizza.  We got there at around 2pm.  Because Dom (the owner) liked to make everything from scratch, the wait was pretty long, but we didn't really mind as we were drinking the Buds we got from Walgreens across the street (it's BYOB!).  Six of us ordered two regular pies (cheese only), the round one (thin crust) and the square one (regular crust). Since it was an open kitchen, I was able to observe the whole pizza making process.  Long story short, Dom put three different types of cheeses and a ton (I mean, tons!) of olive oil on the pizzas.  Oh my goodness!!!!!  No secret, just tons of cheese and oil!!  Here is the review.      Thin crust pie - 8 slices, very oily but not greasy, nice crunchy crust with basil on top, very light and delicious.   Regular crust pie - 12 slices, again oily but not too greasy, much more cheesier and richer with basil, very very satisfying.Don't forget to put some chili pepper on the pizza, it definitely added a kick to the flavor!  Personally I preferred the thin crust over the regular one, because it was not as heavy and I could probably have eaten a lot more slices, haha.  The other person behind the counter (Dom's daughter?) was also very friendly.  I was screaming and taking loads of pictures of Dom and she just smiled.  They also let me use their employee toilet room.Basically, you haven't lived if you haven't had Di Fara Pizza!",5.0

I would buy a crust with nothing on it, that's how good it is. The sauce is fresh, the toppings as well, you may get a large chunk of mozzarella in the middle. It's not going to be possible to eat with table manners and it will probably burn your mouth, but this is the price you pay.Oh, the price-price you pay? Yeah, $5 a slice - before toppings - is a lot, but think of it this way. $14 is about what you'd spend for one meal on Seamless, which is probably going to be crappier than this.

It's like a pizza from another planet, and a good planet (I thank u Steve Jobs)!You are a true artist Dom. The sauce, the cheese (3 or 4 kinds of those, including real bufala mozzarella and imported parmigiano reggiano), watching you pouring that olive oil before you send it to the oven where she is slowly, wondrously brought into being. You're putting all of that love into each pie, and taking your sweet time at that.. the lines are long at Di Faras but only cause Dom can stop time. Expect about 1-2 hours wait, and in the summer you don't want to wait inside since the place can get blazing hot and that shitty ceiling fan wont really help. I had a lot of pizza in New York, and there are some really good other spots (L&B Spumoni if u like sicilian, Lucali, John's in the village, Grimaldi's...) but I really think that Dom is the thin crust Leonardo Da Vinci of our time.

"Pretty perfect pizza and a must try for NY pizza fans at some point. Esp watching him make the pizzas. It might be impossible to live up to the hype but it definitely beats the other hyped places like grimaldi's. Not much seating though, and one downside is the crust is blah - it doesn't have the perfect crispy-chewy texture of Motorino's crust but I rarely eat my crust. That's ok cause the two cheeses and olive oil goodness of the pizza is so delicious. Plain or with toppings, you can't go wrong.Funny story - they didn't collect payment because our pizzas came at different times. We ended completely forgetting to pay until we asked our friend how much we owed - had to come back to the restaurant to pay because they forgot too!",5.0

"Best slice in my world!! I'm far away Dom, but your pizza is my permanent reference when it comes to... well, pizza:) I use to live at the top floor of that magical little corner of Brooktown, and I can't remember a day passing by with me not stopping automatically at Di Faras to long lines for that divine slice. It's like a pizza from another planet, and a good planet (I thank u Steve Jobs)!You are a true artist Dom. The sauce, the cheese (3 or 4 kinds of those, including real bufala mozzarella and imported parmigiano reggiano), watching you pouring that olive oil before you send it to the oven where she is slowly, wondrously brought into being. You're putting all of that love into each pie, and taking your sweet time at that.. the lines are long at Di Faras but only cause Dom can stop time. Expect about 1-2 hours wait, and in the summer you don't want to wait inside since the place can get blazing hot and that shitty ceiling fan wont really help. I had a lot of pizza in New York, and there are some really good other spots (L&B Spumoni if u like sicilian, Lucali, John's in the village, Grimaldi's...) but I really think that Dom is the thin crust Leonardo Da Vinci of our time. I'm thinking of you (the pizza, not the dude that makes it) and Jamiroquai's Little L comes to mind. We shall meet again..",5.0

"There are plenty of raving reviews about Di Fara and I'm just adding another to the list. I was only in NYC for a long weekend...this was one of my must-tries and I'm so glad we came for lunch on a rainy Sunday afternoon since it wasn't too crowded.It's a local spot in Brooklyn and to me, it was the epitome of what a true pizzeria should be. Small and rundown space, several pizza ovens in an open kitchen, one person taking orders, and of course the owner Dom making every single pizza himself! Apparently, he's been doing this for the past 40 years or something so I truly admire him. (yelp.com/biz_photos/C8j0…)We waited around 45 min for food but it was well worth it, although the wait is known to be even longer. This sign says it all. (yelp.com/biz_photos/C8j0…) You can either get pizza by the slice ($4 or $5 with toppings) or a whole one (ranging from $20-$33 depending on toppings). My bf and I were starving so we thought it would be more bang for our buck with getting the entire pie.Patiently waiting while Dom drizzled more olive oil, sprinkled some freshly grated cheese, and cut up basil onto our pizza. It was like watching a master of a craft perfect his piece of work. (yelp.com/biz_photos/C8j0…) He was amazing and never rushed anyone's pizza. We ordered one with pepperoni, mushrooms, and black olives ($25)...it came out of the oven and was ginormous!It was definitely the oiliest pizza I have ever had but it was so incredibly tasty that we didn't care or even bothered to sop up the grease (aka Dom's love) with our napkins. I was all set with my parsley and chili flakes too...YUM! OMG I was in pizza heaven!! Now I feel like I can't have NY-style pizza anywhere else. It was pretty thin in the middle so that the toppings slid off a bit but that's what the plates and utensils were for. =)The ingredients he used were all fresh and delicious...I loved how he used whole tomatoes instead of just tomato sauce too. I was ridiculously full after 3 huge slices but couldn't help eating the crust too... it was just crispy and doughy enough at the same time for me to want to savor every last bite. Reading all the articles and newspaper clippings on the walls about this historic pizzeria during our meal was entertaining as well.The destruction of our pie in photos:Before: yelp.com/biz_photos/C8j0…During: yelp.com/biz_photos/C8j0…After: yelp.com/biz_photos/C8j0…Yes, the two of us ate that entire pizza by ourselves! *hides in shame* It really lived up to the hype...the food as well as the Di Fara experience!Cash only of course and you pay after you get your food. There are regular or square pies too (I noticed the latter was more of a deep-dish pizza). Come on a rainy day like us so the wait won't be as long!",5.0

"There are plenty of raving reviews about Di Fara and I'm just adding another to the list. I was only in NYC for a long weekend...this was one of my must-tries and I'm so glad we came for lunch on a rainy Sunday afternoon since it wasn't too crowded.It's a local spot in Brooklyn and to me, it was the epitome of what a true pizzeria should be. Small and rundown space, several pizza ovens in an open kitchen, one person taking orders, and of course the owner Dom making every single pizza himself! Apparently, he's been doing this for the past 40 years or something so I truly admire him. (yelp.com/biz_photos/C8j0…)We waited around 45 min for food but it was well worth it, although the wait is known to be even longer. This sign says it all. (yelp.com/biz_photos/C8j0…) You can either get pizza by the slice ($4 or $5 with toppings) or a whole one (ranging from $20-$33 depending on toppings). My bf and I were starving so we thought it would be more bang for our buck with getting the entire pie.Patiently waiting while Dom drizzled more olive oil, sprinkled some freshly grated cheese, and cut up basil onto our pizza. It was like watching a master of a craft perfect his piece of work. (yelp.com/biz_photos/C8j0…) He was amazing and never rushed anyone's pizza. We ordered one with pepperoni, mushrooms, and black olives ($25)...it came out of the oven and was ginormous!It was definitely the oiliest pizza I have ever had but it was so incredibly tasty that we didn't care or even bothered to sop up the grease (aka Dom's love) with our napkins. I was all set with my parsley and chili flakes too...YUM! OMG I was in pizza heaven!! Now I feel like I can't have NY-style pizza anywhere else. It was pretty thin in the middle so that the toppings slid off a bit but that's what the plates and utensils were for. =)The ingredients he used were all fresh and delicious...I loved how he used whole tomatoes instead of just tomato sauce too. I was ridiculously full after 3 huge slices but couldn't help eating the crust too... it was just crispy and doughy enough at the same time for me to want to savor every last bite. Reading all the articles and newspaper clippings on the walls about this historic pizzeria during our meal was entertaining as well.The destruction of our pie in photos:Before: yelp.com/biz_photos/C8j0…During: yelp.com/biz_photos/C8j0…After: yelp.com/biz_photos/C8j0…Yes, the two of us ate that entire pizza by ourselves! *hides in shame* It really lived up to the hype...the food as well as the Di Fara experience!Cash only of course and you pay after you get your food. There are regular or square pies too (I noticed the latter was more of a deep-dish pizza). Come on a rainy day like us so the wait won't be as long!",5.0
It's Di Fara's! What more can I add to what's already a NY treasure?,5.0
"Not overly impressed!Pizza was good but not $28 a pie good, ingredients did seem fresh but too oily & the container he keeps basil in i question the cleanliness.Location is horrible, I was really grossed out at location.  I ordered my pies to go so had to park in surrounding neighborhood.  Not sure what the locals cook but the smell in this area was horrendous.The DiFara store itself was gross too.  Had I not known the reputation of this place after walking in I would have done a complete turn around and left.  Seriously, your charging $28 a pie, you should at least have a place somewhat clean & inviting.  Place is neither!Longest I ever waiting for 2 takeout pies and at the end of day not worth it in my eyes.  I could easily find a similar tasting pie elsewhere for half the cost.  I don't see that the value is there with a DiFara cheese pizza so won't be returning.",3.0
Best pizza I've ever had in my life hands down. I waited 2 hours I think and yes it was worth it. I would go back and do it again.,5.0
The pizza here is solid. But the wait time is ridiculous. Last time I came here I waited almost 2 hours for a pie and I was the 3rd person in line. I'm sorry but that is way to long to wait for cheese and tomato sauce on bread. If you want some good pizza minus the wait go to tottononos on Coney Island.,3.0
"Pricey Delicious Pizza-ness!Had the last special of the day, split it among the two of us and it was probably the best pizza I've had in years. Mind you, the wait can be up to an hour in the smokey hole in the wall. Fresh basil cut on top of the pizza was a nice touch. Sauce was fresh, ingredients were good. For $30 a pie, I would expect nothing less and remember the BYOB policy. Brooklyn pizza heaven.",5.0
"Oh wow, this place was delicious! I just had a regular slice, but boy it was amazing! They do make you wait (I came in and the first thing the guy said to me is that it'd be about a 10 minute wait for slices) because they only serve fresh slices. You get to watch the guy make each pie and how he checks on them in the oven using only his bare hands. When it comes out he puts fresh parmesan, basil, and olive oil on it. It's best to let the slice rest a bit once you've gotten it to let the cheese melt and the crust to get more crispy. There isn't all that much seating, but there's a decent amount. It is expensive at $5 a slice, but people pay it for good reason. Next time I'll have to try the Sicilian.",4.0
"Seriously, I feel like I'm plagiarizing every reviewer before me. I can't say anything new, original, funny or interesting other than it is incredible, delicious and worth visiting. The pizza is a slice of heaven, basil oil cheese and sauce. I've enjoyed it every time we've visited and yes its worth the wait.",4.0
"Man, this was such a disappointment.I have so many friends who talked up difaras, that it is the second coming of jesus, that it will save judgement day etc etc etc.I went here on a wednesday afternoon right when it opened, and had to wait probobly 30 minutes for my pizza. Which is supposedly quick.The pie was nothing special, I mean it was good, but it was small for 25 bucks and inside it was really dirty and cramped. I was very disappointed. Overall, if this pizza was down my block and the pie was 10-15 bucks with no wait, I would come once in a while. But to wait so long and pay so much, skip this....",2.0
Let me tell you that this pizza is one of a kind and this is the reason you should try it.It is expensive(i agree) but worth it!!!Different taste of pizza.,5.0
"We waited for 45 AGONIZING minutes for this one slice of HEAVEN. My only regret was not ordering two of these bad boys. This pizza is hands down the absolute best I have ever tasted, ever. The basil, oil, freshly grated parm on top after it comes out? Simply magically delicious! I am going back. This is not hype. I cannot wait! I think about this one slice in an unhealthy, almost obsessive way.",5.0
"Like so many places in our fair city, Di Fara's is an establishment every New Yorker should check out at least once in their time here.  And then probably never go back ever again.My plan was to check out the famed pizzeria in the middle of the week, after lunch but before dinner in order to minimize wait time.  It worked perfectly!  My guy and I strolled in, ordered our pizza right away and had it ready and piping hot within 15 minutes.  No fuss, no muss.The pie itself is a feast for the eyes-- I could hardly contain my glee as I watched Dom snip the fresh basil onto our pie-- I gushed and oohed like a school girl with a pop star crush.  ""It's a work of art!!"" I exclaimed to Dom as he smiled.  Meanwhile he's probably thinking this girl needs to get some pizza in her mouth so she'll SHUT UP.The pizza has a beautiful char and is covered with just the right amount of mozarella and grated parmesan.  The fresh basil is incredibly fragrant and is the perfect complement to the sweet and tangy tomato sauce.  The olive oil drizzled on top did have a tendency to drip and get all over my hands, making for a somewhat messy eating experience, so if anything I would just be wary of that.Because we're overly ambitious eaters, the two of us ordered a whole pie to share (half cheese, half sausage and pepperoni) and had 3 slices left over (which made for a delicious late night meal).  Di Fara's definitely dishes out a great pie and watching Dom work on his craft is really a NY experience not to be missed.  With that said, I'd probably be willing to wait 30 minutes max for his pizza but anything more I'd suggest you come back when you can enjoy your pie without the long lines and cranky attitudes.",4.0
"Forget the haters. This is simply the best pizza on the planet. I've been all over (not to Bianco in AZ yet, but soon.) - The Level of ingredients used and the care put into each pie - these are the two things that put Di Fara above the rest. The pies do tend to be on the softer side, and Dom uses lots of olive oil, as opposed to super-thin and crisp pies like at John's  - but the combination of the tomatoes, the cheeses, the dough, the basil and the oil is a truly beyond belief.  Try to go during off hours.If you're reading reviews of those who knocked Di Fara because they came in for a slice and waited 20 min or something, or those that don't even know how to spell the name of the establishment - just ignore them.

Have been lucky enough to have been going to DiFaras since the early 70's. I remember standing at their side door which opened to the kitchen and watch the sauce being made. They had a full menu back then. Dom was making the pies. It was so good to see him still doing what he loves. The pizza is just fantastic! Nothing more to say. Well worth the trip and the wait.,5.0
"Perfect! The best pizza I've ever had. No exaggeration--this might be the best pizza in the world.It does take a while (only 1 group in front of us hadn't ordered and it was 45 minutes till we had our pizza), but during that time you get to watch a master at work. He obviously values quality, checking the crust of each pie before pulling it out bubbling hot. Then he adds more freshly grated cheese and uses scissors to trim basil from a bunch.The crust is thin and crunchy. The cheese is high quality. The sauce is delicious. The proportions of each are perfect.Also, they were quiet, all business, but nice. They even let a girl come to their side of the counter to take a picture with Dom DeMarco and her pizza.",5.0

"i consider myself a pizza connoisseur lol. I usually like to try pizza from different cities & states & I heard of this place from one of my buddies. He mentioned that there is this old guy who's been making pizza for many, many years & he was ""HANDS-DOWN"" the best. My friend said his hands are so CALLOUSED from pizza-making but because he does it himself is what makes it very special. I showed up to Di Fara's at 5pm on a windy & chilly Thursday afternoon & had to wait outside. The store was closed & the sign at the store read - WILL RE-OPEN AT 6PM. Hung out at Dunkin Donuts for an hour & returned at 5:50pm.

AT 5$ A SLICE & 28$ A PIE....hmm got me questioning....My girlfriend ordered a sausage slice & absolutely LOVED IT. I ordered a garlic pie for 2$ more for a total of 30$ for the pie.

"We arrived at 11.45am on a Sunday ready for the noon opening and there was line outside of about 10 people.  Once the doors opened we ordered, grabbed a seat and were eating the Classic pie in about 20 minutes.  Not too bad at all.I have to say that the line outside, the decor inside and the $5 a slice prices made me question our lunch choice that day.  And those elements meant I couldn't give this place 5 stars.  However, the first bite of that pie made all those doubts disappear!  It is amazing pizza.  I'll certainly be going back!!",4.0
"It's OK. Nothing more nothing less. Crust is crispy but feels chewy and dense. The sauce is a bit too sour and thick. The cheese on the square pizza is overpowering and too thick, the cheese on regular slice is almost non-existent. Porcini mushroom special topping is flavorless and soggy. Saying this is the best slice in NY is an exagerration to a point of a hyporbole.",3.0
"I recommended this place to my friend and he came back and told me it was ""ehhh just okay"". I didn't understand why he had such a laskluster review of the best pizza I ever ate. I went today and figured out why. I placed my order for 4 slices and was told it would be ready in 20 mins. My boyfriend and I came back in 20 mins and the counter guy informed us that we took too long so he gave it away. So we put our names down for another 4 slices and decide to wait it out. In 10 mins our slices were ready. Tip: Order your pizza and wait by the counter no matter how long they claim the wait is. The guy who worked the counter today was a low talker, so if you don't pay attention to hear your initials, kiss your pizza goodbye.As for the pizza, it tasted ""ehh just okay."" It was so oily that the oil clouded the taste of the fresh cheese and sauce. The crust was close to burnt. Don't get me wrong, I'm not ready to write off DiFara's.

"This is some pretty damn good pizza. I'll admit, I hadn't heard of this place until an out of town friend came to NYC and invited me out. Thankfully, I didn't have to trek out on the Q to get there. I could drive like 10 minutes over. We didn't have to wait, as it was a week day, and our pie came out right away. It was delicious, but I'm not going to go as far as to say it's the best pizza I've ever had, but it's def. in the top 5 margarita pizzas out there.

Luigi's fresh slice is possibly my favorite.)You can bring your own booze, so that's a nice addition.One thing that really makes the food good is the flavor from the oven and the pans.

"My girlfriend and I decided we had to try Di Fara since it is a Brooklyn staple, and generally regarded as the best pizza in the city. Boasting that it is 'worth the wait', which I've heard can be up to 3 hours on busy nights, we tried our luck and headed over to dine in. It has limited seating, but that is most places in NYC to begin with, so if you are bringing a large group, you might have to get creative with your seating arrangements. The pies are a tad pricey, but I have to say that it lived up to the hype. We waited in total about an hour, but a quick trip down the street to grab a bottle of wine to bring in made the wait bearable, and the pizza was  perfect. We went with the original, which was a little bit damp at the tip of the slice, but each slice became more and more amazing as you get toward the crust, which was the perfect consistency and super delicious.My theory on pizza has always been that anyone can throw good toppings on a pizza. Toppings don't make the pizza; you have to have an amazing crust to make it truly remarkable, and this crust is top notch. It also helps that the ingredients Di Fara uses are great. The cheese is that wonderful Buffalo mozzarella that I can easily say is the envy of the rest of the country, but it's the crust, man! The crust! It's basically the beauty of a real lye bagel in a pizza crust, if that makes sense.",5.0
"We arrived at 11.45am on a Sunday ready for the noon opening and there was line outside of about 10 people.  Once the doors opened we ordered, grabbed a seat and were eating the Classic pie in about 20 minutes.  Not too bad at all.I have to say that the line outside, the decor inside and the $5 a slice prices made me question our lunch choice that day.  And those elements meant I couldn't give this place 5 stars.  However, the first bite of that pie made all those doubts disappear!  It is amazing pizza.  I'll certainly be going back!!",4.0
"It's OK. Nothing more nothing less. Crust is crispy but feels chewy and dense. The sauce is a bit too sour and thick. The cheese on the square pizza is overpowering and too thick, the cheese on regular slice is almost non-existent. Porcini mushroom special topping is flavorless and soggy. Saying this is the best slice in NY is an exagerration to a point of a hyporbole.",3.0
"I recommended this place to my friend and he came back and told me it was ""ehhh just okay"". I didn't understand why he had such a laskluster review of the best pizza I ever ate. I went today and figured out why. I placed my order for 4 slices and was told it would be ready in 20 mins. My boyfriend and I came back in 20 mins and the counter guy informed us that we took too long so he gave it away. So we put our names down for another 4 slices and decide to wait it out. In 10 mins our slices were ready. Tip: Order your pizza and wait by the counter no matter how long they claim the wait is. The guy who worked the counter today was a low talker, so if you don't pay attention to hear your initials, kiss your pizza goodbye.As for the pizza, it tasted ""ehh just okay."" It was so oily that the oil clouded the taste of the fresh cheese and sauce. The crust was close to burnt. Don't get me wrong, I'm not ready to write off DiFara's.

"Why did the hipster burn his mouth on his DiFara slice?He ate it before it was cool.I arrived @ 3:01 on a Wednesday, satisfied that Don was behind the counter. I ordered my regular slice @ 3:05 (there was no line but they took their time asking for it) and was quoted a wait of a ""few minutes"". I anxiously waited as basil wafted through the hot air (98-degrees if the thermostat was correct), amazed when my name was called @ 3:07 and I forked over the five-spot, walking out @ 3:08 with a fresh-out-the-oven creation. As I walked through Midwood, treating the slice like any other that's designed for traversing a borough, I noticed a hint of fennel seed, but not much in the way of a pronounced flavor that set it apart from its contemporaries. For what it was, Di Fara is a slice of Brooklyn and a legitimately tasty product, but Dom seemed to personify the downward spiral of the place following escalating media exposure - too many people who wanna chew his ear off claiming they were there in the decades ago and that he should thus preferentially treat them and expedite their pie.Why a 4 and not a 5? The slice wasn't that spectacular. The same not-so-stellar slice cost $5. I potentially could've waited upwards of an hour for said slice.Why a 4 and not a 3? I didn't have to wait. It's in a not-so-hip area where you gotta respect the lines and the dedication, even if it can be mainly young people with time to kill who make a pilgrimage out of it.

For what it was, Di Fara is a slice of Brooklyn and a legitimately tasty product, but Dom seemed to personify the downward spiral of the place following escalating media exposure - too many people who wanna chew his ear off claiming they were there in the decades ago and that he should thus preferentially treat them and expedite their pie.Why a 4 and not a 5? The slice wasn't that spectacular. The same not-so-stellar slice cost $5. I potentially could've waited upwards of an hour for said slice.Why a 4 and not a 3? I didn't have to wait. It's in a not-so-hip area where you gotta respect the lines and the dedication, even if it can be mainly young people with time to kill who make a pilgrimage out of it. Frankly, I'm scared of giving Di Fara a 3; my Yelp reputation, or lack thereof, could have hinged on the click of the ""Post"" button.",4.0
There really isn't anything else to say that hasn't already been said. This is the absolute best pizza I have ever had and no wait time or price should stand in anyone's way of trying it.,5.0
"Best pizza in Brooklyn and in all of NYC. HOWEVER, if you've sweated it out a few times and got the taste of it you can be easily over the wait and try another place like Lucali or Guissepina in Brooklyn. Cute old man, secret family recipe-the little Italian love affair is over-and I'm over IT. Kudos to DiFara but I can't wait two hours any more. Try it a couple of times and you'll be over it too.",5.0
"Yelp confession #13849: I hate cheese. I'm not lactose intolerant. I love milk. I love Cheetos.It is because of this I can't eat cheezy pizzas at Naples 45, Patsy's or Artichoke. I promise you, it's an Ipecac serum for me.I've heard the hype. I just never had an opportunity to try the legendary Di Fara pizza. The first time I went to Di Fara's I tried, excuse me, waited for the pizza, was Gina C's birthday. I thought I would bring an interesting gift.I kicked myself as I waited over an hour for one regular and one Sicilian pie. As pies came out, I became angry because I thought it was MY pie coming out of the oven. I thought about mugging the losers who got their pies before me.Then Dom smiled at me. He sprinkled more cheese, drizzled olive oil on my pies, and cut them. I paid him. The other worker locked the door. It was closing time. I was so famished, I opened the boxes and swallowed a slice from each. I gathered my belongings took my pies and thanked Dom. He was surprised and smiled when I told him, it was my first time.I was happy to share the pizza with the party guests and realized that it was worth the wait and a great present. I could only be trumped if someone brought a drunk clown or a unicorn (Ironically, I think someone did bring a drunk clown - J.W.)Anyone who understands finance, always considers calculating the time value of money... with Present Value greater than $4, I am not sure I can afford paying this much for this pizza per slice (the travel time + wait time + price) often. I think it's worth waiting for once in your life.However this is the most delicious pizza I have ever eaten. I didn't like the Sicilian so much. I will concur, it's the best in NYC.

"This place has sparked lengthy, circular disagreements in my house - and if my husband were writing this review, it would be 5 stars. Di Fara Pizza fascinates me because of the debate it inspires, mainly. The pizza's really good.

This pizza would have to be the best pizza I've ever had in order for me to get over the wait, the discomfort, the heat, etc. And it's not the best pizza I've ever had. The best pizza I've ever had is around the corner from where I used to live in New Jersey, and I never had to wait more than 30 minutes for it.

"I got a tip about DiFara from a foodie friend of mine who has been raving about the amazing pizza.  After some deliberation, the BF and I decided that we would go forth and venture to the famed pizzeria.  After hiking down from Manhattan to this hole-in-the-wall joint on Avenue J, we realized how lucky we were that we had literally nothing else to do all day.  DiFara requires a serious time investment; the shop had only been open for 20 minutes and already we were facing about an hour wait for a pie.  Here's why: a disorganized line/wait system, dependent only on the non-owner and a legal pad, hordes of amateur foodie bloggers/hipsters/tourists snapping their cameras and asking too many questions, and an artisinal (read: archaic) way of making the pizzas.  As a side note, we ended up waiting half an hour longer for our pie because the guy taking the orders misheard my name and order and skipped over us because he didn't know what to do.  Luckily, I stepped in to right the wrong and after 90 heat-filled painstaking minutes, got my pizza.The menu is simple: pizzas come by the slice or in whole pies, either round or square.  A plain slice will cost you $5 while a plain pie goes for $28 (get the pie, it's a much better deal).  We ended up going for the DiFara classic pie, which is the best deal if you want toppings on your pizza ($32 round pie that comes with sausage, peppers, onions, and mushrooms).  There's also a list of toppings (both regular and premium) to choose from, but most people go for the plain or the special. To be fair to DiFara and to the process, the pies come with A LOT of TLC: the owner Dom hand-makes each one with plenty of extra virgin olive oil, hand-tossed dough, freshly grated cheese, and snips on heaps of basil to finish the pies.But truth be told (and I'm about to make enemies with hundreds of foodies out there), the pies are not worth the excruciating wait.  The pizza was very very good, but it wasn't, as many reviewers here and elsewhere claim, ""the best pizza ever"".  My crust was kind of burnt, the middle of the pie was soggy, and the intial bites were so hot it burnt my mouth. Granted, these are small gripes and on the whole, the pizza was definitely a cut above the standard NYC pie, but when you wait an hour and a half for a pizza pie, you should expect nothing but the best.  This was not the best.  Motorino makes an equally good (and in my opinion, better) pie and the wait time is far shorter.With that said, it's an experience that every New York pizza snob should go through at least once.  There is something special and unique about the pizza and the process.  But for everyone who sings their praises and thinks DiFara is the greatest thing to happen to pizza, you don't need to wait a lifetime for great food.  There are other pizzas in this city that are just as good (and arguably better) that can be brought to your hungry stomach much more quickly than DiFara.But I'll say one thing that the reviewers here will likely agree with me on: DiFara kicks the absolute shit out of that tourist hole known as Grimaldi's.",3.0

"This is the best pizza I have ever had.  Despite this, I cannot bring myself to eat here.  I get it.  If there are enough people willing to pay the exorbitant price, then it just makes good business since to take them all to the cleaners.  Walking into this pizzeria you will notice nothing that visually separates this establishment from any other.   It is small.  You will have to buss your own table, if you are so luck to stake one out.  Ordering is laborious, as there is no cut and clear line.  If you are in line for slices it is feast or famine.  People ordering whole pies might get preference, it is hard to tell.  While you are waiting to place and receive your order, you can watch an old man make pies with great attention to detail.  At least prior to them going into the oven, you may end up with a pie with extra char.  The round and square are both equally wonderful.  You cannot go wrong.  With that said, I have not been here in a couple of years.  I am close enough, but with the price increases and the change in hours I could not justify the expense, especially with what you must put up with to get an order.  I still have the memories.  Perhaps within my last visiting they have improved the ordering process, I doubt it.",5.0

"There is not much more to say about the food that has not been stated.  The pizza is damn good here.  The upside is that every pie is made from scratch, with pride, using all fresh ingredients.  The downside is that with all of the cheese and olive oil, the pizza gets very greasy.Getting here is a hike from almost anywhere, and then you have to wait on a very long line.  If you are lucky, you can find a seat at one of the wobbly tables in the restaurant.  At this point, you have been waiting so long that you're starving.  The biggest mistake at this point is to rush that first bite because you will end up burning your whole mouth.  Sure, you can also take your pizza to go, but you might as well eat now considering that you just made the trip out here (in all likelihood).Is the pizza really delicious?  Yes.  Is it worth the trip, the wait, and the overall hassle?  Maybe not more than once...but, you should definitely go at least once.",4.0

"I'm from Brooklyn, and been around a lot of pizza joints, this one takes the prize as best pizza ever. Totally fresh with great ingredients. I see people complaining about the burned pizza they get; it's Mr DiFara making it, so it's gonna have some burns (maybe). So it's unusual.

"Overall, Di Fara's pizza is OK. Don't get me wrong! The pizza is pretty good. Traditionally hand-made, fresh ingredients, basil topped, brick oven-baked. That's all really nice. And I can also appreciate the story of Domenico DeMarco and how he also slowly hand makes ALL of the pizza's with love and expertise. But for the price, it's just too expensive compared to all the other pizzas I've eaten before. It might be the hype, the fresh ingredients, I don't know! A plain square sized pie is almost $30. With three drinks, total came out to $36. Really pricey. And because of this, it has to be AWESOME, not just pretty good. Some other gripes I have is that our pizza was really burnt around some parts of the crust. I mean blackened. Not a huge fan of that. And it was really saucy. This might be a preference thing. I guess one thing I can appreciate is that we didn't have to wait very long for the pizza (about 10-15 minutes). I've heard about this place's legendary wait times and I'm glad I didn't have to go through that for a pretty good $30 pizza pie.",3.0

My favorite pie. Not only is the pizza good but a cute little old man makes each one. I think part of the experience is watching him create these pies. It's definitely a wait but it's worth it. Both the square and the round are good but I prefer the square for the extra crunch/chew. My only complaint is the price. It's gone up since the first time I went many years ago (which is expected) but the price was high too begin with.,5.0
"I'm glad I finally got to try the legendary Di Fara and see the famed pizzaiolo in action.  On a blustery weekday evening, the wait time was only around twenty minutes.  The pizza was served piping hot with a mouth-watering fragrance courtesy of the plethora of hand-chopped basil leaves on top.  The only component of the pizza I really liked was the sauce, which had a slight kick. I was disappointed that the not thin enough crust, rather than resembling that of pizzas I've had in Italy or at other famed New York pizzerias,  reminded me of one Enzo's/Pizza Palace of New Jersey, which is, at best, passable for Jersey, and, at worst, cardboardy.  I also found that the addition of the pungent grana padano overwhelmed all the other components.  I wonder if this topping would work better as an optional topping that customers could add on themselves like the hot red peppers.  The abundance of extra virgin olive oil was also unpalatable.  Still, all New Yorkers ought to make a pilgrimage here at least once to judge the pizza for themselves.",3.0
"I went here about a year before they were cited for the 67 health code violations in 2011.  One man makes ALL the pizza.  My order took about 3 hours to be ready and only because someone before me cancelled.  No pre ordering over the phone.  Your not even guaranteed to eat there the same day because they close or go on break when they feel like it.  As far as the taste of the pizza, I have had much better.",1.0
"I absolutely love this place. The 2-hour wait for the pizza was well worth it. I cannot even find the words to describe the experience at Di Fara.

After reading one of the articles on the wall (trust me, you will have plenty of time to do so) I learned he no longer has feeling sensation in his fingers. My favorite part is when he gets a fresh bunch of basil and cuts it with scissors onto the pizza, then pours olive oil onto it. I could probably sit at Di Fara all day and just watch Dom.When our square pie was ready, I went up to the counter and he said, ""Is this yours?"" with his accent sounded more like 'Is this yos?"" I had the biggest smile across my face.

We got pepperoni and mushroom pie. OMFG it was delicious. You can tell Di Fara uses quality ingredients and adding fresh basil and olive oil is genius. And the crust, OMG the crust. It was the best pizza crust I've ever had, perfectly crispy. I probably said ""this crust is sooo good"" to my friends about ten times. Just beware, the restaurant does get very warm and hot inside and it's tiny. We lucked out and got a table. If you visit NY, you definitely have to go to Di Fara and have Dom's pizza.

"How do I even approach a review of Di Fara Pizza?Invariably, it's discussed from one of two perspectives: the virgin and the veteran. I'm sorry to say, but these tropes are as stale as it gets (yes you're guilty).The virgins write as if entering a sacred (likely Catholic) shrine for the first time (I think they picture themselves in an Indiana Jones movie). Photographs are a constant, but everyone still seems to show an incongruous reverence normally reserved for a pope, head of state or Lady Gaga. After an already eternal wait, they meekly place their order, waiting in line for their baptism in pizza grease and holy extra virgin olive oil. Finally, once the pizza itself is a mere formality, they depart slightly heavier, but spiritually reborn (or something like that).Veterans, on the other hand, burnish their credibility by claiming to have been among the first to try Di Fara (while Midwood locals reminisce at how Di Fara used to be before the crowds). They worship at the alter of Pope Dom DeMarco, and write about Di Fara in tones of a wise man leading a rapturous flock to a holy Midwood pilgrimage, spreading salvation to those poor souls who's heathen lips have never touched the most holy blessed pizza in existence.If my comments show anything, it's that I'm sorely lacking in whimsy or the ability to accept anything with more than jaded cynicism (being only 26, this deeply disturbs me). More importantly, I've overused the Catholic imagery and relied too much on the sarcasm. No one wants to sound like this guy (which I did after my first draft).Still, I'm also compelled to admit that, until recently, I too was a Di Fara virgin.Sure, my experience was less stressful than others. My friends got there early on a Saturday morning, allowing me to dodge the wait while seizing a prime table (the largest) directly across from the counter.Waiting for our pizza, we talked about food (as we almost always do). Even while catching up with a college friend who I hadn't seen since graduation, our discussion eventually circled back towards eating. At the same time, the conversations of other line-waiters stamping foodie bingo cards grew louder as more people packed into the narrow restaurant. Hearing these conversations (almost exactly like ours) just made me more cynical. Why the hell am I waiting for a pizza like this, I wondered. The likelihood that the answer was ""because everyone else is in line,"" and I'm not all that special (despite what my mother says) was frightening.Now I question whether I have anything to say (assuming you care in the first place) about Di Fara that hasn't been written a million times before. I want to tell interesting stories about food and restaurants, but how many times can you read about someone going to DiFara's (I guess it's too late to worry about that if you've read this far), before you too become jaded to all of it?I do take a little pleasure in contributing. I think it's just that I'm a contrarian asshole that this stuff gets to me (a hypocrite too!), but shouldn't I be out looking for the ""next"" Di Fara rather adding to the endless praise?Back to the pizza. Relax. Focus on the food (and make sure to breathe). It's just pizza, albeit very good pizza.The traditional pie arrived quickly--half plain half pepperoni. Nearly as good (and as oily) as I'd hoped. I dug the mozzarella, Grana Padano and the herbal bite of basil (allegedly sourced from Israel). The cheeses, combined with the acidity of the tomato sauce, displayed a near-perfect synergy of toppings, while the crust was suitably chewy (but in the parlance of Adam Kuban, it displayed notable tip sag). And yes, I lost a measure of cynicism when I heard DeMarco ask, ""Issa dis your pie?"" after our sausage and eggplant Sicilian pizza came out of the oven (also after another forty minute wait).Even still, my overanalysis likely prevented complete enjoyment of the decadent Sicilian pizza (as it does with so many other things) before me. Sitting at my table, a dated, framed Time Out magazine proclaiming the opening of DiMarco's on Houston (with Parker Posey and Ethan Hawke staring back at me) proved almost too much of a distraction while strings of melted cheese and droplets of oil fell from my chin. For a brief moment I felt as if I had achieved the state of mind that others had written about so reverently, but soon realized that I was probably just experiencing a rush of endorphins from the cheese and oil burning through the roof of my mouth.Sometimes it's better to think less, respect the moment, and let that oil drip.",4.0
"This is one of those places that you want to go once in a while and enjoy one of the best pizza brooklyn has to offer!With that said, I have to say the place is pretty dirty! I mean it definitely needs an upgrade. Seating place is limited, so if you are coming in a large group, you probably in tough luck. Also, you have to keep in mind that they aren't open like traditional pizzerias. Do call before you go there to see if they are open.With everything said, I still think if you are a food junkie like me..you have to try this place out at least once in your life!!",4.0
"A true master of pizza craft resides here.Forget the reviews on the wall or even this review as long as you go there and taste it for yourself.You will be a believer in the slice and in the art of Dom.He's stopped wearing the hat the inspectors made him put on for ""health"" reasons. I've seen reviews that knock the place as dirty and the service at a snails pace.  I don't care. All I care about is that gooey, warm, oily slice of heavenly pizza.Get a regular pie first. You'll be hard pressed to find any better.If you're into Sicilian pies his ranks #1-2 of those that I've tried. He uses a whole package of Buffalo mozzarella on each pie.I've had the regular with artichokes on it and loved it as well.The best ends are the ones that have been soaked in the oil while it was cooking but there's always ample oil to dip the crust in on the pan. The last time I went we got a Sicilian to go with black olives on it (along with a plain regular pie that we devoured at a table staked out well in advance).The next day at work was my best work-lunch all month.I notice that they close now till 6 (or 6:30)  for a two hour break which is ok.

"I've lived in NYC for about two years now and my friend kept swearing that this place had the best pizza in NY, but it was so far that I never wanted to make the trek. I actually had attempted to come here once before, but of course I didn't think to check whether they were actually open and instead had to take the subway out 1 hour just to find that they are closed on Mondays. (just in case you were planning to try and come here on a Monday DON'T DO IT!) One Saturday and 2 hours later by bike, we finally arrived at this famed pizza joint. The pizza did NOT disappoint!! Maybe it tasted better because we were famished and had to wait another 45 minutes once we got there for Mr. Domenico Demarco to actually make the pizza, but it was sooo good. Between three girls we finished a whole pie. We got sausage and mushroom for toppings and Dom topped it with fresh basil as he does every pizza. The place itself is very bare bones. It's definitely no upscale pizza place. You either sit at one of three tables next to the walls, and if you're a small party you'll probably be sharing that table with strangers. Also, expect to wait a long time here no matter what. We didn't even have that many people in front of us but we still had to wait close to an hour for our pizza. Although the pizza was probably one of the freshest tasting and best I've had, I don't know if I would make the trek and wait that long again just to get the pizza a second time...unless I lived closer. It's definitely worth checking out at least once though and please go soon.

"I have to say that this pizza to me is a bit overrated.  I have tasted pizza that was better prepared for less the wait.  I find that there is way too much cheese, and oil used.  It is salty and slightly burned.  The pizza is really messy to eat, there is more cheese to bread ratio and it's better to eat with a fork and knife.  I should mention that the owner makes the pizza personally, and he is not in a rush.  I find that there is no air conditioning on the premises and there is a line to get in.  I believe I waited almost half an hour for my one slice.  There is not a lot of seating and many times there is a huge line.

"Eek, I don't understand the excitement about this place...We were more than happy to journey out to Brooklyn to experience ""the best pizza"" in Brooklyn, New York, the world...Got there about 6:45 pm; the store re-opened at 7.  The line wasn't too bad.  We originally ordered a whole pie.  The one they offered was really burned.  And they ran out of fresh basil, so they sprinkled a bit of dried basil on top.  We opted to downgrade the order to a single slice, hoping it would at least be edible.  The slice they gave us didn't look too bad on top. I had to pick off charred carbon from the bottom of a dry, bitter crust... Yikes.  Something about the balance of cheese and sauce was off too (too little sauce I think).  At $5 a slice, I was really hoping for a good experience.Perhaps it was an off day?  Even so, shouldn't there be quality control?  If a pizza is obviously burned, they shouldn't sell it (they didn't even blink when they called my name for the order), especially at $30 for a sad, non-basil-ed pie.",2.0

The likelihood that the answer was ""because everyone else is in line,"" and I'm not all that special (despite what my mother says) was frightening.Now I question whether I have anything to say (assuming you care in the first place) about Di Fara that hasn't been written a million times before. I want to tell interesting stories about food and restaurants, but how many times can you read about someone going to DiFara's (I guess it's too late to worry about that if you've read this far), before you too become jaded to all of it?I do take a little pleasure in contributing. I think it's just that I'm a contrarian asshole that this stuff gets to me (a hypocrite too!), but shouldn't I be out looking for the ""next"" Di Fara rather adding to the endless praise?Back to the pizza. Relax. Focus on the food (and make sure to breathe). It's just pizza, albeit very good pizza.The traditional pie arrived quickly--half plain half pepperoni. Nearly as good (and as oily) as I'd hoped. I dug the mozzarella, Grana Padano and the herbal bite of basil (allegedly sourced from Israel). The cheeses, combined with the acidity of the tomato sauce, displayed a near-perfect synergy of toppings, while the crust was suitably chewy (but in the parlance of Adam Kuban, it displayed notable tip sag). And yes, I lost a measure of cynicism when I heard DeMarco ask, ""Issa dis your pie?"" after our sausage and eggplant Sicilian pizza came out of the oven (also after another forty minute wait).Even still, my overanalysis likely prevented complete enjoyment of the decadent Sicilian pizza (as it does with so many other things) before me. Sitting at my table, a dated, framed Time Out magazine proclaiming the opening of DiMarco's on Houston (with Parker Posey and Ethan Hawke staring back at me) proved almost too much of a distraction while strings of melted cheese and droplets of oil fell from my chin. For a brief moment I felt as if I had achieved the state of mind that others had written about so reverently, but soon realized that I was probably just experiencing a rush of endorphins from the cheese and oil burning through the roof of my mouth.Sometimes it's better to think less, respect the moment, and let that oil drip.",4.0
"This is one of those places that you want to go once in a while and enjoy one of the best pizza brooklyn has to offer!With that said, I have to say the place is pretty dirty! I mean it definitely needs an upgrade. Seating place is limited, so if you are coming in a large group, you probably in tough luck. Also, you have to keep in mind that they aren't open like traditional pizzerias. Do call before you go there to see if they are open.With everything said, I still think if you are a food junkie like me..you have to try this place out at least once in your life!!",4.0
"A true master of pizza craft resides here.Forget the reviews on the wall or even this review as long as you go there and taste it for yourself.You will be a believer in the slice and in the art of Dom.He's stopped wearing the hat the inspectors made him put on for ""health"" reasons. I've seen reviews that knock the place as dirty and the service at a snails pace.  I don't care. All I care about is that gooey, warm, oily slice of heavenly pizza.Get a regular pie first. You'll be hard pressed to find any better.If you're into Sicilian pies his ranks #1-2 of those that I've tried. He uses a whole package of Buffalo mozzarella on each pie.I've had the regular with artichokes on it and loved it as well.The best ends are the ones that have been soaked in the oil while it was cooking but there's always ample oil to dip the crust in on the pan. The last time I went we got a Sicilian to go with black olives on it (along with a plain regular pie that we devoured at a table staked out well in advance).The next day at work was my best work-lunch all month.I notice that they close now till 6 (or 6:30)  for a two hour break which is ok. We just walked around the neighborhood and picked up some baked goods and pickles from the Pickle Guys.",5.0
"I've lived in NYC for about two years now and my friend kept swearing that this place had the best pizza in NY, but it was so far that I never wanted to make the trek. I actually had attempted to come here once before, but of course I didn't think to check whether they were actually open and instead had to take the subway out 1 hour just to find that they are closed on Mondays. (just in case you were planning to try and come here on a Monday DON'T DO IT!) One Saturday and 2 hours later by bike, we finally arrived at this famed pizza joint. The pizza did NOT disappoint!! Maybe it tasted better because we were famished and had to wait another 45 minutes once we got there for Mr. Domenico Demarco to actually make the pizza, but it was sooo good. Between three girls we finished a whole pie. We got sausage and mushroom for toppings and Dom topped it with fresh basil as he does every pizza. The place itself is very bare bones. It's definitely no upscale pizza place. You either sit at one of three tables next to the walls, and if you're a small party you'll probably be sharing that table with strangers. Also, expect to wait a long time here no matter what. We didn't even have that many people in front of us but we still had to wait close to an hour for our pizza. Although the pizza was probably one of the freshest tasting and best I've had, I don't know if I would make the trek and wait that long again just to get the pizza a second time...unless I lived closer. It's definitely worth checking out at least once though and please go soon. Seriously wondering how much longer people will be able to go and actually get a pizza still made by Dom himself cause he's so old!Don't forget CASH",4.0
"Despite all the hype, and the health crises and other noise, the pizza is still good. Is it worth going 40 minutes out of the way from New York for a slice... Meh. Is it worth doing to see a legend in the making with a bunch of friends and some drinks... Absolutely!!!!Loved the Sicilian pie!!!",4.0
"I have to say that this pizza to me is a bit overrated.  I have tasted pizza that was better prepared for less the wait.  I find that there is way too much cheese, and oil used.  It is salty and slightly burned.  The pizza is really messy to eat, there is more cheese to bread ratio and it's better to eat with a fork and knife.  I should mention that the owner makes the pizza personally, and he is not in a rush.  I find that there is no air conditioning on the premises and there is a line to get in.  I believe I waited almost half an hour for my one slice.  There is not a lot of seating and many times there is a huge line. I should also say that my friends love this place.  They don't mind waiting and love the taste of this pizza joint.",3.0
"Eek, I don't understand the excitement about this place...We were more than happy to journey out to Brooklyn to experience ""the best pizza"" in Brooklyn, New York, the world...Got there about 6:45 pm; the store re-opened at 7.  The line wasn't too bad.  We originally ordered a whole pie.  The one they offered was really burned.  And they ran out of fresh basil, so they sprinkled a bit of dried basil on top.  We opted to downgrade the order to a single slice, hoping it would at least be edible.  The slice they gave us didn't look too bad on top. I had to pick off charred carbon from the bottom of a dry, bitter crust... Yikes.  Something about the balance of cheese and sauce was off too (too little sauce I think).  At $5 a slice, I was really hoping for a good experience.Perhaps it was an off day?  Even so, shouldn't there be quality control?  If a pizza is obviously burned, they shouldn't sell it (they didn't even blink when they called my name for the order), especially at $30 for a sad, non-basil-ed pie.",2.0

"OK, everybody hold on to your pantyhose.  What is this...mass hysteria?  I lived on Ocean Ave and J since 1980 and ate pizza here plenty of times and back then there was nothing special about the place or the pizza.  In fact, everyone on the block thought it was actually pretty ordinary, and back then there was the old guy AND two others making pizza -- there was more than one person  working the counter, so you never had to wait on line; plus the place was cleaner...MUCH cleaner.  I still live on Ocean Ave but now about 15 blocks away, so I haven't been there in years, but recently I decided I wanted to see what all the hoopla was about and quite honestly, after the experience, I think there is a lot of cool-aid drinking going on here.  People, you are willing to pay $5 for a slice of BURNT pizza with 2 cents worth basil leaves throw on top (truffles it ain't) and then ""olive oil"" squirted all over it to make it a sloppy mess?  Really?!  You're willing to eat at a place that consistently FAILS health inspections and then gush about it in these reviews?   REALLY?  I put  ""olive oil"" in quotes because I am very familiar with the viscosity of undiluted virgin olive oil and what he pours all over the slice is NOT undiluted olive oil.  Either it's a mix of olive oil and some other vegetable oil or not olive oil at all.  Sorry, that's my opinion from what I saw coming out of the old man's squirt bottle and from what I know of my own use of REAL olive oil as I cook with it all the time -- virgin, extra virgin, and raw (I won't dare use that  ""lite"" swill which maybe is what he's using) -- and this just doesn't look like real olive oil.Since I've been a regular there decades ago, the place has gotten dirtier (has it ever been cleaned once since 1980?), the old guy has gotten older and the pizza that was always no more than just OK back then has gotten even MORE ordinary than I remember, in the opinion of this pizza-loving Italian.  In fact, years ago he never burnt the pizza or saturated it with oil.  I don't remember him strewing basil leaves on it either back then.  Surely it can't be that it's that few basil leaves on it that make people claim it the ""best pizza in the world""  Hey, give me a great slice from San Remos on Corteleyou Road and Ocean (now really GREAT pizza in my opinion) or Spumoni Gardens on 86st in Bensonhurst or Di Napoli's on Nostrand Ave and I, and sprinkle some basil leaves on it and poof -- best pizza in the world!  if you asked fans of those other pizza joints, they would also claim that THOSE guys make the best pizza...and subjectively speaking, they would all be right, only difference is, they are rational about it.  It's just that this feeding frenzy (pun intended) and the crescendo of hype has gotten to a weird threshold where I don't think people are being very objective about DeFara's or the quality of the pizza.

"Quick review:We showed up right before the place opened and there was already a line. We ordered the Classic Pie (Peppers, Mushrooms, Sausage, fresh basil and extravagant amounts of olive oil). We waited about 2 hours.Yes, the place has a dirty charm.The pizza was great, but I'm not ready to say its the best (I'm new here).Tip for not getting bored while inevitably hungover: Either order a slice....or for an entire pizza: (1) order pizza; (2) pop Advil; (3) find a bar and alternate between bloodys and water for about 1.5 hours; (4) return to Difara's and watch the man cook for about 20 minutes; it's entrancing; (5) enjoy pizza.",4.0
"I hadn't heard/read anything about this place, but agreed to make the longest ever commute for pizza, just because my friends wanted to go.Tiny hole in the wall, JAM PACKED with people.

And it was the best damn square slice of pizza heaven ever encountered.So fresh, so tasty, so simple, SO GOOD.",4.0
"3.5 starsDominic its time to pass on the recipe and throw in the towel... You move waaay too f$&@!*# SLOW! I can do 12 things by the time this man spreads the sauce on your pie. In my opinion, If you can not run the place properly alone (that includes cooking and cleaning) then don't do it. The place is dirty; you charge an arm and a leg for a pie but you cant hire a kid at minimum wage to clean up? Maybe the eye sight has gone bad too because it seems like he dumped the bottle of olive oil on our pie. The bites of pizza that were not saturated in oil you can taste every fresh ingredient used and it's really good pizza!! Please don't even bother with toppings, it's disrespect to the recipe. Overall, it's good pizza, I'm glad I did not wait an hour to eat, but that oil is just too much and it sits in your stomach all day. Glad I got the chance to try and damn glad I didn't see any rats yesterday.

"Delicious.  A 45 minute wait on a Saturday afternoon, but the pizza's great.  It didn't change my life, but it was good.  Small space - first-come, first-serve seating for 15-20 people.  Not a great place for groups.Only cons - he burned one pizza and the place filled up with smoke, and stayed smoky for about an hour.  There's no real rhyme or reason for ordering and you have to just kind of invade the counter to figure it out.  It's not challenging, but a little annoying.  Because tables are hard to come by, there's definitely no sitting for waiting customers (so if you're waiting for 90 minutes, be ready to stand).  The standing space is so small that in the winter I expect that it would get crowded and uncomfortable pretty quickly.  Go for the pizza not the ambiance.  Or experience - it's not a great ""experience"" place...it's about the pizza.",4.0
"This pizza shrine is overrated. The worst part was the one hour wait for the pizza and standing in the midst of the young worshipers who, frankly, know nothing about good pizza and fall for the hype. It was like being in church instead of a pizzeria.( I half-expected that knucklehead Jesus to make an appearance.) When my pizza was finally ready,, I walked home in full-throttled expectation of a nirvana-like dining experience. Five minutes later I bit into the worst pizza that I've had in my life. The crust was as hard as cardboard and the cheese and sauce had coagulated into a Vesuvian knot. It was horrible. I gave the rest to my dog who, fortunately, is less demanding than his owner.

"Oh man.  What can I say about this place?  If you are ever in NYC, I'd suggest you take a trip into Brooklyn just to get a slice of the best pizza in New York.  Yes I've had Lombardi's, but in my opinion, Di Fara's is on a different level.  Lombardi's might have been the original, but the original isn't always the best.Di Fara's is located conveniently right across the street from the Ave. J subway station, so transportation is pretty convenient.  As another reviewer has mentioned, get in line, and get ready to wait a bit just to place your order.  It took me about 30 min before I was able to get on ""the list"".  Trust me its worth it.  After that, comes the most agonizing wait as Old Man Dom gets to work on your pizza.  Dom is a master.  All the decades of making pizza must have made his hands impervious to heat because he reaches into the oven bare-handed to turn your pie while its baking (intense).  After about another 20 min, the pizza is ready.Dom uses amazingly fresh ingredients.  Fresh mozzarella, tomatoes and herbs.  After the pizza comes out of the oven, he'll cut fresh basil straight onto your pie to add even more flavor.What's amazing about this pizza isn't just one thing, but its a combination of everything.  Fresh ingredients and a great sauce makes it great, but his crusts brings it all together.  The fabled New York water helps, but because Dom is the only one that bakes the pizza, it is always consistent, and just perfect.  The actual shop is small.  Half of which is the occupied by the register and kitchen.  Seating is scarce so I got mine to-go.  The place is pretty much always jam packed with customers enjoying  their pizza, and there is almost always a line out the door.  Decor on the wall is full of personal affects from the years Di Fara has been open, with pictures of Dom as a young boy, to the next generation.The price for a slide is extremely steep at $5, so I'd go for a pie and share.  Even then, it will be the best $5 slice you will ever have, if its not, then it will be on your top 3.Di Fara Pizza gets my top vote for the best pizza in New York, and looks like I'm not the only one that thinks so at it was voted best pizza in New York again for the year 2011.Get over to Ave. J and check this place out.  It's an absolute treasure.",5.0

"The Famous DiFara always lives up to the hype! I've been eating this delicious pizza for about 10 years now and every time is literally an adventure. First off, you gotta pick your times- if you are going to go on a nice sunny day , midday, prepare to wait 2 hours, that's right 2 hours for a pie. If you order a slice , the people waiting to order will look at you like you're crazy... and you would be because there is no way in hell you are only going to want 1 slice. If you do not know about Domenico DeMarco, the artist who makes these pies then you've been out of the loop for some time... google him . If you are smart, you'll wait till the weather is bad and go later in the day, you'll get a pie quick (about 20 mins) and you'll cheer like my fiance and I did on the night of the first snowstorm in Brooklyn last December 2013.

"Sometimes, the best things can be found in your backyard.  In this case, I do not live in Brooklyn.For years, I've heard about the famous Di Fara from online reviews, in passing conversation, and even from trusted foodies.  This past weekend, I was in the mood for pizza.  Good pizza.We drove all the way to Brooklyn to finally try the famous Faras.  Well, the wait is to be expected right?  Everyone knows that Dom walks and works at the pace he pleases.  That is a-ok with me, but while waiting in the windy cold, I thought to myself,""This slice better be a slice of heaven"".  Come noon time, the supposed opening time, and no sign of the gate going up.  About 20 minutes pass, and finally, signs of lifeform!  The gates slowly go up and the hungry mongers throw themselves into the shoebox known as Di Faras.I have to give it to them.  They had a few pies ready already.  Sicilians were baking in the oven and cheese was churned as we were waiting.  For $5 a slice, I really hoped heaven was to be found somewhere.We opted to share the pie as the pie was cheaper vs. by the slice.  The first bite was good; not great.  I was quite hungry so cardboard might have tasted ok by then.  As I gorged myself further and further, I noticed how oily and salty the pizza was.  The cheese is shredded and just landed on the pizza.  The dough is not chewy nor bouncy.  The sauce was... meh, tasteless.  Overall, it didn't taste fresh, as it should have.  I know Dom uses fresh ingredients.  It was evident by the basil and the buffalo mozzarella he uses.  However, the end result didn't do it for me.  It was really, just a regular slice of pizza and tasted and looked like, a regular slice a pizza. There a handful of places just as good or much better than Di Faras, one that happens to be in walking distance of where I live in Queens.  When one thinks about the type of pizza it is, Di Faras is not gourmet, it's not brick oven. One has to compare it to a regular slice of pizza with no bells and whistles.Rays in the city, Rosas in Maspeth all land in that category and rank much higher in my book, and  much, much closer to heaven.",2.0

"Sometimes, the best things can be found in your backyard.  In this case, I do not live in Brooklyn.For years, I've heard about the famous Di Fara from online reviews, in passing conversation, and even from trusted foodies.  This past weekend, I was in the mood for pizza.  Good pizza.We drove all the way to Brooklyn to finally try the famous Faras.  Well, the wait is to be expected right?  Everyone knows that Dom walks and works at the pace he pleases.  That is a-ok with me, but while waiting in the windy cold, I thought to myself,""This slice better be a slice of heaven"".  Come noon time, the supposed opening time, and no sign of the gate going up.  About 20 minutes pass, and finally, signs of lifeform!  The gates slowly go up and the hungry mongers throw themselves into the shoebox known as Di Faras.I have to give it to them.  They had a few pies ready already.  Sicilians were baking in the oven and cheese was churned as we were waiting.  For $5 a slice, I really hoped heaven was to be found somewhere.We opted to share the pie as the pie was cheaper vs. by the slice.  The first bite was good; not great.  I was quite hungry so cardboard might have tasted ok by then.  As I gorged myself further and further, I noticed how oily and salty the pizza was.  The cheese is shredded and just landed on the pizza.  The dough is not chewy nor bouncy.  The sauce was... meh, tasteless.  Overall, it didn't taste fresh, as it should have.  I know Dom uses fresh ingredients.  It was evident by the basil and the buffalo mozzarella he uses.  However, the end result didn't do it for me.  It was really, just a regular slice of pizza and tasted and looked like, a regular slice a pizza. There a handful of places just as good or much better than Di Faras, one that happens to be in walking distance of where I live in Queens.  When one thinks about the type of pizza it is, Di Faras is not gourmet, it's not brick oven. One has to compare it to a regular slice of pizza with no bells and whistles.Rays in the city, Rosas in Maspeth all land in that category and rank much higher in my book, and  much, much closer to heaven.",2.0
"It's worth the trip.  Believe the hype. Impress your pizza-snob friends.It's hard to pay $5 for a slice and not feel ripped off, but you know ingredients are top quality.You'll have to wait for a pie, so check out the fun articles posted around the old-skool place.  I'm proud to say that I've never had to wait for a slice, but I only go in a few times a year and live nearby, so I run in when the place is not too crowded.There's good shopping on Ave. J. If you're there on a Thursday or Friday walk down a few blocks toward Coney Island Ave. and pick up some Jewish soul food (kugel, chulent, etc.) from Gourmet on J.CLOSED on SUNDAY!",4.0
"Probably the most overrated pie in the country. the pizza is solid. nothing extraordinary. hate the fact that they throw basil on everything, makes half the pies unslightly. it's also really dirty. the only thing i can think of as to why the lines are so long is that the place is popular.",3.0

"After hitting up a friend's bday at The Gutter on a Saturday and guzzling lots of pitchers, we were all hungry for a bite. Since we decided to stay and bowl another game, and the afternoon was still young, we all agreed delivery was the way to go. About 45 min later, we were greeted with 6 steaming pizza pie boxes (there were 14 of us, no judging). Di Fara truly deserves an all caps OMG. It was exactly how a pizza should be, thin crust with those little burnt bits that only a brick oven can give; fresh toppings including real mozzarella - no shredded business here and of course, great sauce. We truly ordered the gamut from arugula, red onions and goat cheese (I think?!)  to pesto shrimp to your standard margarita and every slice was better than the last.

"A sublime experience that is not without tragedy in the form of an eventual expiration date as Dom can not go on slinging this perfection forever.

Were 2nd in line, and received our full pie by 12:05PM (They Open at Noon).  I think it pays to get there a little early.  People that were 3-4 spots behind us were still waiting for their pie when we left and from there it only gets worse.",5.0
"There is a lot of buzz about this pizzeria because of the legendary owner who has been featured on TV including America's Test Kitchen where Di Fara's pizzas are touted as being the best in all of Brooklyn.  So I decided to bike ride out to Avenue J in the heart of an Orthodox Jewish neighborhood, and see if the hype is true.As usual there was a line - relatively short since it was a Sunday.  Instead of waiting for a custom-topped slice, I decided to have what was immediately available .... a basic pizza - no toppings.  Di Fara's ""schtick"" is to top off his pizzas with a few scissor clippings of fresh basil and to drizzle some olive oil as well.  The server then proceeded to divide the ~14 inch diameter thin pizza into 1/8th slices.    Considering it was only a 14 inch sized pizza, the slices end up being fairly small.  Price?  5$ basic+ fresh basil add $1 = $6.  That may seem reasonable..but factoring in the small size, with essentially no toppings ...it's actually  expensive.  The pizza was quite thin and soggy and it was fresh out of the oven!. How about the taste?  Its good - nothing spectacular.   I needed 2 slices to feel at all satisfied.  Grand total $13. For now I still give Grimaldi's in Brooklyn Bridge Park, the edge in terms of overall quality and value. Di Fara is now enjoying the fame due to recent media coverage featuring  the almost the mythic status of the  owner who quietly still works behind the counter making pizzas.Bottom line: For the price...the pizza should not be soggy. Not worth the trek.",2.0
"Best pizza I ever tasted! Been going there since I was a kid and I live only a half a block away. That slice will make you come back for more, that freshly cut basil gives it a good taste. Price is a bit high for a slice, I believe it's because he uses high quality ingredients! So you know its money well spent and you can taste the difference between a real slice and a regular from another spot. I've also tried the chicken parmesan with cheese! Delicious! It took really long, but I still can't complain.This place will be in my memory forever!! :)",4.0

"After all the hype I tried this place out and was HIGHLY disappointed. Traveled all the way to Brooklyn to this place and it really wasn't worth the trip (especially where I live) From what I heard was there was this old guy individually making each one of the pies. I'm thinking ""How? No way.."" But once I walked up to the place and saw the line out the door it all made sense..You can pretty much get just a slice or a whole pie any way you want it just remind yourself its being made by one guy so excuse the presentation AND the wait. When I received my slice it was burnt with my toppings falling off left and right.

"I had been planning on trying Dom's world-famous pizza for months now, and my friend and I finally worked up the energy to trek down to Brooklyn after a night of solid partying.  We got there at 4 PM on a Saturday, which is actually when the store is supposed to close and then re-open at 6.  We found that the place was very much alive, to our delight, but that a whole Sicilian pie (which is what all 15 other people in the small shop were also waiting for) would take up to 2 hours at least.  After putting our names down for 2 whole pies (honestly, if you're coming here, you might as well) and wandering around in Park Slope for an hour and a half, we came back to find Dom boxing our pizzas in front of a line that hadn't changed in size.The pizza: glorious.  The bread is just the right thickness, not as thick as most Sicilians but very far from your traditional NY slice.  The man adds generous amounts of olive oil to the bottom of the pan, which causes the pizza to basically fry in its pan while in the oven, much like Pizza Hut style but lighter and more airy.  The mozzarella is a tiny bit on the sparser side (even though he adds more at different points in the pizza-making process) but practically liquifies on top of hot, bubbly fresh tomato ""sauce"" (really, it tastes more like stewed fresh tomatoes).  The fresh basil, cut with scissors on top of the completed pie, takes it over the top.  My only complaint is that I generally don't like my pizza blackened around the rims, which seemed relatively standard here and is a small blemish to an overall masterpiece.Each pie is cut into 12 slices, and I ate my share of 6 slices in one sitting, hands-down the best pizza I've had in NY (although I'm looking to try Keste, Artichoke, and Grimaldi's).  Slightly nauseating?  Yes.  Did I burn parts of my tongue?  Yes.  Did I cut up the roof of my mouth with the crust?  Unfortunately, yes.  Would I do it all over again?  Absolutely, preferably some time later this month.",5.0

I'm not sure if its REALLY worth $5 for a slice but its def really good pizza! I will def go back to try it again. they use fresh basil and the ingredients are just magnificent.

Best Pizza in Brooklyn!,5.0
"A sublime experience that is not without tragedy in the form of an eventual expiration date as Dom can not go on slinging this perfection forever. But of course that is part of the beauty of it all.  Everything about my time at DiFara was perfect and reminded me why i find the pursuit of perfection in food one of life's great pleasures. The minute details have been otherwise adequately covered. Please get here as soon as you can before its too late. We arrived on a Friday at 11:40AM. Were 2nd in line, and received our full pie by 12:05PM (They Open at Noon).  I think it pays to get there a little early.  People that were 3-4 spots behind us were still waiting for their pie when we left and from there it only gets worse.",5.0
"There is a lot of buzz about this pizzeria because of the legendary owner who has been featured on TV including America's Test Kitchen where Di Fara's pizzas are touted as being the best in all of Brooklyn.  So I decided to bike ride out to Avenue J in the heart of an Orthodox Jewish neighborhood, and see if the hype is true.As usual there was a line - relatively short since it was a Sunday.  Instead of waiting for a custom-topped slice, I decided to have what was immediately available .... a basic pizza - no toppings.  Di Fara's ""schtick"" is to top off his pizzas with a few scissor clippings of fresh basil and to drizzle some olive oil as well.  The server then proceeded to divide the ~14 inch diameter thin pizza into 1/8th slices.    Considering it was only a 14 inch sized pizza, the slices end up being fairly small.  Price?  5$ basic+ fresh basil add $1 = $6.  That may seem reasonable..but factoring in the small size, with essentially no toppings ...it's actually  expensive.  The pizza was quite thin and soggy and it was fresh out of the oven!. How about the taste?  Its good - nothing spectacular.   I needed 2 slices to feel at all satisfied.  Grand total $13. For now I still give Grimaldi's in Brooklyn Bridge Park, the edge in terms of overall quality and value. Di Fara is now enjoying the fame due to recent media coverage featuring  the almost the mythic status of the  owner who quietly still works behind the counter making pizzas.Bottom line: For the price...the pizza should not be soggy. Not worth the trek.",2.0
"Best pizza I ever tasted! Been going there since I was a kid and I live only a half a block away. That slice will make you come back for more, that freshly cut basil gives it a good taste. Price is a bit high for a slice, I believe it's because he uses high quality ingredients! So you know its money well spent and you can taste the difference between a real slice and a regular from another spot. I've also tried the chicken parmesan with cheese! Delicious! It took really long, but I still can't complain.This place will be in my memory forever!! :)",4.0
"It wouldn't be inaccurate or an exaggeration to find an article about a great artist of the Renaissance and insert ""Di Fara"" at every mention of the painting and ""Dom"" at ever mention of the artist's name.Dominico, a distinguished Italian pizza-maker, crafts each and every masterpiece at an unassuming joint in low-key Midwood, Brooklyn.  But at the heart of this mostly Jewish neighborhood, beats the most sublime New York/Italian pizza flavors I've ever had.  And yes, I've had the pizzas in Italy.I won't arouse myself  by going all in, though my fingers tremble just at the thought of exalted pleasure by typing the flavors.  One bite--one bite, and you'll see and taste years of dedication and unrelenting devotion to a simple craft.  Because, it is simple.  It's dough, sauce, and cheese, and whatever toppings.And its celestial taste is what makes it simply un-fucking-believable.",5.0
"After all the hype I tried this place out and was HIGHLY disappointed. Traveled all the way to Brooklyn to this place and it really wasn't worth the trip (especially where I live) From what I heard was there was this old guy individually making each one of the pies. I'm thinking ""How? No way.."" But once I walked up to the place and saw the line out the door it all made sense..You can pretty much get just a slice or a whole pie any way you want it just remind yourself its being made by one guy so excuse the presentation AND the wait. When I received my slice it was burnt with my toppings falling off left and right. I could taste and feel that it was made from the heart but for my time and money I could have went to any pizza shop and been satisfied better.  There had to be over 25 people standing inside and out watching this guy though. 6.50 is rape for a slice..

Forget this overrated dump.  Service was the worst I've had in my 37 years on the planet.  The old man behind the counter causes the ridiculous waits by going about his process of making one pie every ten minutes.  You would think for $5 a slice this old prick would hire some help behind the counter.  But apparently only his skilled artisan hands can produce this oily burnt mess.  He encourages the wait because it continues the hype.  Do yourself a favor and bypass this overrated slop.,1.0
"Never have I waited outside a pizzeria for a slice.However, I will always make an exception for this place. Once you enter, you smell the aroma for fresh basil, olive oil, pizza dough, and previous pizzas that left the oven.It's so warm and welcoming here with people speaking to each other while waiting, observing the numerous awards throughout the walls, or simply admiring a master pizza maker doing his thing.Wait time was ok, I measured from the point I ordered to receiving my order. 30mins. Relatively quick. Now, if you were further down the line, patience may be tested, but you will be greatly rewarded.I came here for the first time and decided to order the pie ($25). Delicious! Soft crust and the thinness just right. Fresh cheese, basil, and a dollop of olive oil for finishing touches. And it's not as if it's one pie immediately after the other. The man takes his time observing if the crust is just right and will hold off the next pie if his satisfaction is not met.The crew (his children) are friendly and will help get condiments for customers. They pace the orders according to the pizza maker and keep the customers happy.I finished 6/8 slices myself. I couldn't resist because the slices are just that exceptional! Goodness, I doubt I can find anywhere else in NYC that can compare to this place. Probably have to leave for Italy to get a fair comparison. For $5 a slice, the pie is a better choice. Next time, the DiFara Special $30 for me.Ultimately, you will be satisfied.",5.0

Forget this overrated dump.  Service was the worst I've had in my 37 years on the planet.  The old man behind the counter causes the ridiculous waits by going about his process of making one pie every ten minutes.  You would think for $5 a slice this old prick would hire some help behind the counter.  But apparently only his skilled artisan hands can produce this oily burnt mess.  He encourages the wait because it continues the hype.  Do yourself a favor and bypass this overrated slop.,1.0
"Never have I waited outside a pizzeria for a slice.However, I will always make an exception for this place. Once you enter, you smell the aroma for fresh basil, olive oil, pizza dough, and previous pizzas that left the oven.It's so warm and welcoming here with people speaking to each other while waiting, observing the numerous awards throughout the walls, or simply admiring a master pizza maker doing his thing.Wait time was ok, I measured from the point I ordered to receiving my order. 30mins. Relatively quick. Now, if you were further down the line, patience may be tested, but you will be greatly rewarded.I came here for the first time and decided to order the pie ($25). Delicious! Soft crust and the thinness just right. Fresh cheese, basil, and a dollop of olive oil for finishing touches. And it's not as if it's one pie immediately after the other. The man takes his time observing if the crust is just right and will hold off the next pie if his satisfaction is not met.The crew (his children) are friendly and will help get condiments for customers. They pace the orders according to the pizza maker and keep the customers happy.I finished 6/8 slices myself. I couldn't resist because the slices are just that exceptional! Goodness, I doubt I can find anywhere else in NYC that can compare to this place. Probably have to leave for Italy to get a fair comparison. For $5 a slice, the pie is a better choice. Next time, the DiFara Special $30 for me.Ultimately, you will be satisfied.",5.0

Never take the subway it is very loud and scary. do not take it. It is hellish.Everybody here likes to eat the pizza. Anybody who comes in can get pizza.  It is round and delicious or square and has more cheese. The pizza is very hot at first. Everybody is there.  Everybody is talking about the pizza.

"This review is long overdue. Let's put it this way, I wrote my college essay about Di Fara Pizza. The personal statement that got me into NYU included anecdotes of this establishment. I love Di Fara. I've waited in lines both long and short and come at odd hours in the pouring rain to get a pie. Oh yeah, always go for the pie. You pay $5 for one slice, so why not get the eight slices for $28? Also after your long wait you'll be glad you got more pizza. I have had both round and square, call me traditional but I'm more a fan of the round. I always get half peperoni, half plain. The peperoni is insanely delicious, but you also want to have the chance to sample the purity of the untouched cheesy, basil goodness of the original. All the haters who complain about the line are heartless Debbie Downers who can keep off the line. Go get your Famiglia around the corner and leave the good stuff for those of us who appreciate the art and craft that is a slice of Dom's pizza. Take pictures, indulge and bring a bottle of wine (they offer plastic cups) and most importantly bring your appetite for one of the finest New York experiences out there, IMHO as a born and raised NYer.",5.0
"Awesome slice of fresh cheese and basil pizza.The only thing holding me back from giving it 5 stars is 1) the price, and 2) the location. My boyfriend and I trekked all the here via subway from Forest Hills, Queens, and since we came on a Sunday, there were service changes galore on a bunch of subway lines in Brooklyn. We definitely had to work to get our pizza.Fortunately, the wait was only 25 minutes for our slices, and we spent the time watching Domenico crank out pie after pie. We couldn't believe that he actually pulled the pizzas out of the ovens with his BARE HANDS, without a flinch. He must have no nerve endings left in his fingers!Domenico then cuts up fresh basil, which wilts immediately when it hits the bubbling pizza. More cheese is sprinkled on top. The crust is perfectly charred on the edges, and it has a great crunch with every bite. The sauce also has actual chunks of tomato...yum. But $5 for a plain slice of pizza is pretty pricey (extra toppings cost $1 each). It's definitely a great slice of pizza, but it's not anything life-changing.That being said, I would still love to come back here to try a whole pie. The Classic pie looked amazing, topped with Italian sausage, mushrooms, red peppers, red onions, and of course, fresh basil. Pies start at $28, so it's obviously a much better value, but it was just the two of us there, and we had just finished eating brunch. We're fatties, but we're not THAT fatty to eat two big meals in a row. Seating is very limited, so you better hope you've claimed a table by the time your pizza's ready!",4.0
"We arrived early to beat the line. On advice from Yelp, we ordered a whole pie instead of slices. Too much food. Pizza was tasty. A little too greasy/oily. I would say that it was worth the stop, just not our favorite.",3.0
Definitely a good slice. But is it five dollars good? NoThe crust is thicker than Grimaldi's but more airy. I like Grimaldi's sauce and cheese better. They use more cheese here which was shredded into smaller pieces. And the addition of parmesan adds something interesting to the slice. Not really better but different texture to give the slice some depth.The wait here is definitely gimmicky. The store was suppose to open at 6pm but they did not open until 7pm. Once inside only one oven was used out of the six they had. Only two pies went into the oven at any one time. I can understand the old guy taking his sweet time making a pie but the younger guy moved just as slow. And all he really did was take orders and grind up some parmesan cheese. You are really paying for the pizza and a show.I didn't like the freshly cut basil just thrown on after the pizza comes out of the oven. It didn't bring out the full flavor of the herb. But that's part of the gimmick. Only the old man can grab that bunch of basil and cut it in front of a line of customers.A lot of things can and should change to make this place run more efficiently. But that's really not why you come to Di Fara. History and Atmosphere along with a pretty good slice of pizza is what they are selling.,3.0
"I'm a bit of a pizza fanatic, so I decided to (finally) make the trip out to DiFara to get a taste of this $5 slice ($5 slice!!). Since it was a Saturday, I was expecting a bit of a wait.The place is small, but its got that perfect pizza place feel. The pizza is delicious. Its a lot of fun to watch him make the pizzas. He dribbles olive oil all over it before and after it goes in the oven. He even adds some extra cheese after it comes out all steaming hot, which melts right away. Its also crazy to watch him take the pies out of the over with his bare hands.Overall, the pie was good. People always ask me about my favorite place in NYC, and I always say that every place has its own unique characteristics that make comparisons impossible. DiFara's is different because it is a slice joint. Most other notable pizzeria's in NYC serve pies only, and at that, they focus mainly on thin crust with fresh mozz. DiFara's crust wasn't too thin (in fact, my biggest complaint about the pie my friend and I purchased is that the crust did not taste as fresh as I would expect; I was definitely disappointed in the crust).The sauce and cheese were delicious though. I haven't been to a place in NYC that just gobs tons of cheese on the pie, but DiFara's did just that. It was delicious. Very different than other places in NYC.Overall, 4 stars, because of my disappointment with the crust.",4.0
"`There are over a dozen pizza joints in NYC (that I've been to) that have comparable or BETTER pizza than this over-hyped hack of a shack called DiFara.I ask you -- When is it O.K. to charge over $14 for a plain round cheese pie when it costs you less than $3 to make it?How do you raise the price of said pie (again, a Reg./Plain pizza!!!) from $17.00 to $25.00 in less than three years? Why would you praise a pizza ""chef"" when he burns at least one half of the pie's crust on practically EVERY order he makes? ... or when he can't evenly distribute the toppings properly on any pie or slice? ... or when this Million Dollar business, cannot meet the lowest possible Health Safety Standards; they've been shut down MANY times by the Health Dept. since I've lived in NYC (over 20 years). And to top it off, the service at DiFara is unbearable... considering how much $$$$ they pull-in, their lack of organization is inexcusable. The attitude of the staff is a joke... total sense of entitlement & lacking all humility. He & his kids (who are some of the staff) act as if they're invincible -- do they take their success/fortune/customers for granted?Sure seems that way. They're just asking to lose it all!!!Anyone who has praised this rundown, dirty hole-in-the-wall over the years is clearly a sheep & believes the hype instead of forming their own opinion... all the newcomers are merely tardy sheep.

Kingsbridge Rd. in the Bronx) *  these are places where you can get a quick slice to stay or go (unlike some popular favorites where you must order a whole pie).^  I haven't been to some of these establishments in quite a few years... I'm trying to watch my waistline ;-) So, who knows if they're still as great as they once were.Honorable mention: When I first arrived in NYC to attend The New School, my favorite joint was St. Mark's Pizza on 3rd Ave. near the corner of St. Mark's Place. Other than the 'infamous' Ray's on 6th Avenue, SMP was closest to my classes & very popular among college students, musicians, etc. The slices were huge, but more importantly they were to die for...

"I have not been here in a little while but it is so good the memory of the pizza here makes me drool.The fresh mozzarella, the fresh olive oil, oh man... no wonder people wait TWO HOURS for a pie - it's not just for the hype it is WORTH IT.  I wish I lived closer.  My friend lived around the corner - he used to stop by after dinner to get a slice for DESSERT.This place beats all of the other ""famous"" pizza joints in the city HANDS DOWN.  Grimaldi's, Lombardi's, suck it!",5.0
"I don't know how this place has only 4 stars. I've been going here for over 20 years, and I can honestly say this is the best slice I have ever eaten. Sure, it may be $5 bucks a slice, you may wait a while, and the decor isn't superb but when Dom Demarco cranks out that pie then cuts fresh basil on it - it's a little slice of heaven. IF YOU LOVE PIZZA LIKE I DO- YOU MUST TRY DI FARA- YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT.",5.0
"I have to laugh to myself every time I hear about Difara pizza. I started eating his pizza when I was a kid, long before all these people came along. There was never a line way back then, but the pizza was just as good as it is today. That said, I urge anyone that makes a trip out to Brooklyn for pizza to not overlook some of the other fine pizza  joints that we have here. Whatever your pizza jones is, Brooklyn has a solution for you!",5.0
"This review is long overdue. Let's put it this way, I wrote my college essay about Di Fara Pizza. The personal statement that got me into NYU included anecdotes of this establishment. I love Di Fara. I've waited in lines both long and short and come at odd hours in the pouring rain to get a pie. Oh yeah, always go for the pie. You pay $5 for one slice, so why not get the eight slices for $28? Also after your long wait you'll be glad you got more pizza. I have had both round and square, call me traditional but I'm more a fan of the round. I always get half peperoni, half plain. The peperoni is insanely delicious, but you also want to have the chance to sample the purity of the untouched cheesy, basil goodness of the original. All the haters who complain about the line are heartless Debbie Downers who can keep off the line. Go get your Famiglia around the corner and leave the good stuff for those of us who appreciate the art and craft that is a slice of Dom's pizza. Take pictures, indulge and bring a bottle of wine (they offer plastic cups) and most importantly bring your appetite for one of the finest New York experiences out there, IMHO as a born and raised NYer.",5.0
"Awesome slice of fresh cheese and basil pizza.The only thing holding me back from giving it 5 stars is 1) the price, and 2) the location. My boyfriend and I trekked all the here via subway from Forest Hills, Queens, and since we came on a Sunday, there were service changes galore on a bunch of subway lines in Brooklyn. We definitely had to work to get our pizza.Fortunately, the wait was only 25 minutes for our slices, and we spent the time watching Domenico crank out pie after pie. We couldn't believe that he actually pulled the pizzas out of the ovens with his BARE HANDS, without a flinch. He must have no nerve endings left in his fingers!Domenico then cuts up fresh basil, which wilts immediately when it hits the bubbling pizza. More cheese is sprinkled on top. The crust is perfectly charred on the edges, and it has a great crunch with every bite. The sauce also has actual chunks of tomato...yum. But $5 for a plain slice of pizza is pretty pricey (extra toppings cost $1 each). It's definitely a great slice of pizza, but it's not anything life-changing.That being said, I would still love to come back here to try a whole pie. The Classic pie looked amazing, topped with Italian sausage, mushrooms, red peppers, red onions, and of course, fresh basil. Pies start at $28, so it's obviously a much better value, but it was just the two of us there, and we had just finished eating brunch. We're fatties, but we're not THAT fatty to eat two big meals in a row. Seating is very limited, so you better hope you've claimed a table by the time your pizza's ready!",4.0
"We arrived early to beat the line. On advice from Yelp, we ordered a whole pie instead of slices. Too much food. Pizza was tasty. A little too greasy/oily. I would say that it was worth the stop, just not our favorite.",3.0
Definitely a good slice. But is it five dollars good? NoThe crust is thicker than Grimaldi's but more airy. I like Grimaldi's sauce and cheese better. They use more cheese here which was shredded into smaller pieces. And the addition of parmesan adds something interesting to the slice. Not really better but different texture to give the slice some depth.The wait here is definitely gimmicky. The store was suppose to open at 6pm but they did not open until 7pm. Once inside only one oven was used out of the six they had. Only two pies went into the oven at any one time. I can understand the old guy taking his sweet time making a pie but the younger guy moved just as slow. And all he really did was take orders and grind up some parmesan cheese. You are really paying for the pizza and a show.I didn't like the freshly cut basil just thrown on after the pizza comes out of the oven. It didn't bring out the full flavor of the herb. But that's part of the gimmick. Only the old man can grab that bunch of basil and cut it in front of a line of customers.A lot of things can and should change to make this place run more efficiently. But that's really not why you come to Di Fara. History and Atmosphere along with a pretty good slice of pizza is what they are selling.,3.0
"I'm a bit of a pizza fanatic, so I decided to (finally) make the trip out to DiFara to get a taste of this $5 slice ($5 slice!!). Since it was a Saturday, I was expecting a bit of a wait.The place is small, but its got that perfect pizza place feel. The pizza is delicious. Its a lot of fun to watch him make the pizzas. He dribbles olive oil all over it before and after it goes in the oven. He even adds some extra cheese after it comes out all steaming hot, which melts right away. Its also crazy to watch him take the pies out of the over with his bare hands.Overall, the pie was good. People always ask me about my favorite place in NYC, and I always say that every place has its own unique characteristics that make comparisons impossible. DiFara's is different because it is a slice joint. Most other notable pizzeria's in NYC serve pies only, and at that, they focus mainly on thin crust with fresh mozz. DiFara's crust wasn't too thin (in fact, my biggest complaint about the pie my friend and I purchased is that the crust did not taste as fresh as I would expect; I was definitely disappointed in the crust).The sauce and cheese were delicious though. I haven't been to a place in NYC that just gobs tons of cheese on the pie, but DiFara's did just that. It was delicious. Very different than other places in NYC.Overall, 4 stars, because of my disappointment with the crust.",4.0
"`There are over a dozen pizza joints in NYC (that I've been to) that have comparable or BETTER pizza than this over-hyped hack of a shack called DiFara.I ask you -- When is it O.K. to charge over $14 for a plain round cheese pie when it costs you less than $3 to make it?How do you raise the price of said pie (again, a Reg./Plain pizza!!!) from $17.00 to $25.00 in less than three years? Why would you praise a pizza ""chef"" when he burns at least one half of the pie's crust on practically EVERY order he makes? ... or when he can't evenly distribute the toppings properly on any pie or slice? ... or when this Million Dollar business, cannot meet the lowest possible Health Safety Standards; they've been shut down MANY times by the Health Dept. since I've lived in NYC (over 20 years). And to top it off, the service at DiFara is unbearable... considering how much $$$$ they pull-in, their lack of organization is inexcusable. The attitude of the staff is a joke... total sense of entitlement & lacking all humility. He & his kids (who are some of the staff) act as if they're invincible -- do they take their success/fortune/customers for granted?Sure seems that way. They're just asking to lose it all!!!Anyone who has praised this rundown, dirty hole-in-the-wall over the years is clearly a sheep & believes the hype instead of forming their own opinion... all the newcomers are merely tardy sheep.

I'm trying to watch my waistline ;-) So, who knows if they're still as great as they once were.Honorable mention: When I first arrived in NYC to attend The New School, my favorite joint was St. Mark's Pizza on 3rd Ave. near the corner of St. Mark's Place. Other than the 'infamous' Ray's on 6th Avenue, SMP was closest to my classes & very popular among college students, musicians, etc. The slices were huge, but more importantly they were to die for...

"Punished for being single. Punished for wanting just one. Punished for not being able to eat more. A single slice is $5 at Di Fara. It's not even as big as or as heavy as a slice from Artichoke. Nor is it about quality versus quantity (although many will differ). If I came here by myself, instead of getting just one slice, I would get a whole pie. When going to Di Fara, adopt the Costco mentality: pay more for more (literally).Luckily I had my gang of foodies with me. People from Queens sure can eat (and size of stomachs have nothing to do with this statement). We started with one pie (half special and half regular). The crust was thin, the sauce was soupy, and the pie was steaming hot. It doesn't get any fresher than this. I loved the taste of the sauce, the grated fresh parmesan, and the very generous addition of basil. At Di Fara you get a forrest of basil on your pizza unlike at other pizzerias where they literally give you three leaves. While the special toppings were good for bulk and the protein fix, I actually preferred the regular side of the pizza. Since the pizza slices were on the small side and thin, we decided to get a square pie. We consumed the first pie within minutes.I welcomed the square pie at Di Fara with an open mouth. I was a little disappointed that my friend ordered a special square. I had thought we were getting a regular square. Our square pizza was burnt all around the edges and could not hold the heavy toppings. Perhaps we should have waited an additional 20 minutes before diving in but with a Di Fara pizza in front of our faces and the smell of fresh pizza tempting us, it was difficult holding back. We attacked the pizza armed with plastic forks and knives, the necessary utensils needed, to get the pizza in our mouths without having everything fall on our laps or burning our fingers. Sadly, we were not able to finish the square pie. It was just too much for our bellies. The sweet smell of roasted tomatoes, fresh cheese, and aromatic basil also turned fiery. The smell of burnt crust stuck to my hair and clothes. Di Fara also got a little steamy and the steam was not from the love that Dom has for his pies.I appreciate the history behind Di Fara. I smiled as Dom made our pizza with TLC. I liked how everything was so casual and old at Di Fara. I got happy when I saw Izze soda in the fridge. I was surprised when I asked for hot peppers and one of the customers scooped me some red peppers in olive oil. I had meant for the crushed red pepper flakes. I didn't know about the fresh ones in the olive oil. It made the pizza even better. I like to torture myself with the burn. All my friends know me for saying, ""My mouth is on fire!"" But in the end, I give em three Yelp stars. I like John's and Roberta's better and I think the clam pie at Lombardi's is the best thing on Earth. I wanted to hug Dom the way I used to hug my grandpa and say goodbye.It was a quiet Sunday afternoon and we rode the subway home as the rain went pitter patter. It was hard to breathe and focus. The pizza coma was beginning and the soot smell would not go away. These were the Di Fara memories we were left with.",3.0
"So here's the 459th take on DiFara Pizza and yes, I have to agree with all the four and five star reviews:Though I can't compare Di Fara pizza to Totonno's or Patsy's because I haven't tried them yet, I have to say I was mightily impressed. And let me tell you everything was working against my liking this pizza joint. How  can I put this delicately? The place is a dump. It's depressingly worn and unkempt. We're talking decrepit, plastic wall paneling aged to a greasy gold, which no doubt gathered its tarnish from the incessant waves of heat emanating from the gas ovens. The place has a sepia glower, and not even the lacquered reviews and framed newspaper articles can distract you from its 70's Guido chic décor. If you can call it decor.Shuffling behind the counter is Dominick Demarco, the proprietor of DiFara who has been honing his pizza making craft for over forty years. He takes his sweet time doing what he does best.My friend astutely remarked that Mr. DeMarco runs the pizzeria more like a hobby than a business, but that may not necessarily be a bad thing, especially since I had what was arguably the best pizza in a long while.From sweet San Marzano tomatoes imported from Naples, to the three cheeses with which Mr. DeMarco prepares his pies, fresh ingredients is the obvious secret. The sauce is a delicate, succulent blend of sweet and acid tartness, and a perfect complement to the creamy cows-milk mozzarella and Bufala that Mr. DeMarco imports from his hometown of Casserta. Still bubbling out of the oven, he completes the cheese trifecta with a blithe and generous dusting of hand-grated Grana Padano; this is followed with a drizzling of Olive Oil and snips of fresh basil.What's to say about the crust? A wafer crisp delight, charred and blistered on the edges, which I love, and best of all, it didn't buckle under the weight of the sauce/cheese on top. There was no spongy mess in the center. I was surprised such a great crust came from a gas oven when most pizza purists would prefer results from the old-fashioned wood burning kind, but gas ovens can do the job just as well when they're set to a very high temperature. Considering the vision warping heat that practically radiates from the establishment, DiFara's undoubtedly employs this method to achieve a charry edged crust with the right balance of chewiness and crunchiness throughout.I also tried a sicilian slice or as they call it, a square. It was also excellent, but a little messier to eat. It broke apart more easily and overall, I wasn't as impressed or blown away as with the regular slices. Still, the square offers a lesson on how thick dough should really be cooked - a great combination of crunchy/soft textures with its pores soaked in extra virgin olive oil. It was greasy while never feeling heavy, just delicious as hell.So there you have it. Dominick DeMarco clearly puts no heart into DiFara's run down setting. But then again, he doesn't need to when he puts all of it into the pizza.",5.0

(Do they clean this place at all?) A pizza was being pulled out of the oven and the line getting longer and longer by the minute. Sadly, this pizza was not ours. Nor were the several others that followed. As we starved it out in the humidity sipping on our sodas I wondered how Dominoes could get me my pizza in twenty minutes and Di Fara's couldn't. One friend jokingly commented that he had probably gone to Italy to pick it up. After forever (one hour and forty six minutes in the humidity being forever in my humble opinion) our names were called and we dug into the crunchy cheese pizza with globs of mozzarella and snippets of basil strewn over. It was good... really really good. The special wasn't that memorable though, I just remember biting into some capsicum and thinking the square pizza was much better. Best pizza in New York? Arguable. But definitely worth a trek, once... just once.",4.0
This place isn't any better then the next pizza (well some pizza places are terrible) but this is good pizza. There is no need for a half hour wait or a 5dollar slice. I wouldn't go out of my way for this place but if I'm in the area then sure why not,4.0
"Punished for being single. Punished for wanting just one. Punished for not being able to eat more. A single slice is $5 at Di Fara. It's not even as big as or as heavy as a slice from Artichoke. Nor is it about quality versus quantity (although many will differ). If I came here by myself, instead of getting just one slice, I would get a whole pie. When going to Di Fara, adopt the Costco mentality: pay more for more (literally).Luckily I had my gang of foodies with me. People from Queens sure can eat (and size of stomachs have nothing to do with this statement). We started with one pie (half special and half regular). The crust was thin, the sauce was soupy, and the pie was steaming hot. It doesn't get any fresher than this. I loved the taste of the sauce, the grated fresh parmesan, and the very generous addition of basil. At Di Fara you get a forrest of basil on your pizza unlike at other pizzerias where they literally give you three leaves. While the special toppings were good for bulk and the protein fix, I actually preferred the regular side of the pizza. Since the pizza slices were on the small side and thin, we decided to get a square pie. We consumed the first pie within minutes.I welcomed the square pie at Di Fara with an open mouth. I was a little disappointed that my friend ordered a special square. I had thought we were getting a regular square. Our square pizza was burnt all around the edges and could not hold the heavy toppings. Perhaps we should have waited an additional 20 minutes before diving in but with a Di Fara pizza in front of our faces and the smell of fresh pizza tempting us, it was difficult holding back. We attacked the pizza armed with plastic forks and knives, the necessary utensils needed, to get the pizza in our mouths without having everything fall on our laps or burning our fingers. Sadly, we were not able to finish the square pie. It was just too much for our bellies. The sweet smell of roasted tomatoes, fresh cheese, and aromatic basil also turned fiery. The smell of burnt crust stuck to my hair and clothes. Di Fara also got a little steamy and the steam was not from the love that Dom has for his pies.I appreciate the history behind Di Fara. I smiled as Dom made our pizza with TLC. I liked how everything was so casual and old at Di Fara. I got happy when I saw Izze soda in the fridge. I was surprised when I asked for hot peppers and one of the customers scooped me some red peppers in olive oil. I had meant for the crushed red pepper flakes. I didn't know about the fresh ones in the olive oil. It made the pizza even better. I like to torture myself with the burn. All my friends know me for saying, ""My mouth is on fire!"" But in the end, I give em three Yelp stars. I like John's and Roberta's better and I think the clam pie at Lombardi's is the best thing on Earth. I wanted to hug Dom the way I used to hug my grandpa and say goodbye.It was a quiet Sunday afternoon and we rode the subway home as the rain went pitter patter. It was hard to breathe and focus. The pizza coma was beginning and the soot smell would not go away. These were the Di Fara memories we were left with.",3.0
"So here's the 459th take on DiFara Pizza and yes, I have to agree with all the four and five star reviews:Though I can't compare Di Fara pizza to Totonno's or Patsy's because I haven't tried them yet, I have to say I was mightily impressed. And let me tell you everything was working against my liking this pizza joint. How  can I put this delicately? The place is a dump. It's depressingly worn and unkempt. We're talking decrepit, plastic wall paneling aged to a greasy gold, which no doubt gathered its tarnish from the incessant waves of heat emanating from the gas ovens. The place has a sepia glower, and not even the lacquered reviews and framed newspaper articles can distract you from its 70's Guido chic décor. If you can call it decor.Shuffling behind the counter is Dominick Demarco, the proprietor of DiFara who has been honing his pizza making craft for over forty years. He takes his sweet time doing what he does best.My friend astutely remarked that Mr. DeMarco runs the pizzeria more like a hobby than a business, but that may not necessarily be a bad thing, especially since I had what was arguably the best pizza in a long while.From sweet San Marzano tomatoes imported from Naples, to the three cheeses with which Mr. DeMarco prepares his pies, fresh ingredients is the obvious secret. The sauce is a delicate, succulent blend of sweet and acid tartness, and a perfect complement to the creamy cows-milk mozzarella and Bufala that Mr. DeMarco imports from his hometown of Casserta. Still bubbling out of the oven, he completes the cheese trifecta with a blithe and generous dusting of hand-grated Grana Padano; this is followed with a drizzling of Olive Oil and snips of fresh basil.What's to say about the crust? A wafer crisp delight, charred and blistered on the edges, which I love, and best of all, it didn't buckle under the weight of the sauce/cheese on top. There was no spongy mess in the center. I was surprised such a great crust came from a gas oven when most pizza purists would prefer results from the old-fashioned wood burning kind, but gas ovens can do the job just as well when they're set to a very high temperature. Considering the vision warping heat that practically radiates from the establishment, DiFara's undoubtedly employs this method to achieve a charry edged crust with the right balance of chewiness and crunchiness throughout.I also tried a sicilian slice or as they call it, a square. It was also excellent, but a little messier to eat. It broke apart more easily and overall, I wasn't as impressed or blown away as with the regular slices. Still, the square offers a lesson on how thick dough should really be cooked - a great combination of crunchy/soft textures with its pores soaked in extra virgin olive oil. It was greasy while never feeling heavy, just delicious as hell.So there you have it. Dominick DeMarco clearly puts no heart into DiFara's run down setting. But then again, he doesn't need to when he puts all of it into the pizza.",5.0
"You hear the hype.  You soak in the hype.  You then visit the hype, wait 150 minutes for it, eat it, digest it, and absorb its nutrients.  What say you now? I had extremely high expectations for this hole in the wall pizza joint that I've heard people, both local and visitor alike, rave about.  They would tell me the old man in the plaid shirt makes the most wonderful pizza pie in all of NYC.  The whole concept of only one man making the pizza here for years and years and years is quite an endearing story.  Nevertheless, making your customers wait 2.5 hours for a couple pies is not.  When I wait that long, especially for food, I expect mind blowing, orgasmic, want to die for food.  Di Fara's did not do that for me.  It was, I admit, a good and tasty pizza, just not that life altering type of stuff like i was expecting.  To pour a bit more salt in the wound, my friends and I ordered 2 pies and paid roughly $70 for them!  When all is said, done, and eaten, the only mind blowing things about this joint were the price and the wait.  Not the pizza.",2.0

"Ok, the ""Pie"" was only so so.Lots of extra olive oil, a great flavor of freshly cut basil from Di Fara himself and as he prepares everything from start to finish, this place is as famous as any neighborhood legend in NY.

"As a Native New Yorker, I've had the privilege to sample some of the finest pizza in all of NY, pizza such as Totonno's, Grimaldi's, & Lombari's to name a few.  Great pizza artisan's in their own right and I take nothing away from them, BUT, Dom of Di Fara's Pizza, leads this pack of artisan pizza makers.Domenico DeMarco of Di Fara Pizza, AKA ""The Don""  is in a class by himself.  If you haven't had the good fortune of sampling his extraordinary pizza, then I suggest you do, If you don't, you will be doing yourself a disservice.Walking through his door, is like taking a step back through time.  The wood paneled walls painted green for a fresh look, are aligned with well deserved accolades & miscellaneous Italian art.  The counter looks original as do the tables & chairs.You immediately get hit with the sweet aroma of pizza and become almost catatonic.  You give your order and stand aside.  Waiting for at least an hour or so, you become fascinated by how easy he makes taking a pie of pizza out of the oven with his bare hands.  He follows through with drizzling some extra virgin olive oil, and the beautiful basil he cuts with a scissor over your pie.  Then you realize ""Oh yeah, its not my pie"", it's someone else's and you suddenly start becoming anxious.Soon enough the moment arrives, and you take your pizza to stay, because taking it to go, means more waiting, and that equates to unnecessary suffering.  And if you can not get a seat, then do what I do, eat it in your car.Then comes the first bite. You will literally feel like someone punched you in the mouth with some brass goodness.  It's that good.  So perfect, you'll taste every ingredient and savor every bite.When visiting remember to bring your own wine.  Dom is more than happy to open it for you and hand you some plastic cups.

But now with demands for a quicker turn-over, we are now left with this watery, slipper mess that could never properly live up to the golden days.It is of great regret that such popularity had to have ruined something so good. But I guess I am left to blame myself for not being here earlier before the popularity, when Mr. De Marco was still stubborn enough to hold true to his known ways, before the weight of the world took upon him.",4.0
"As a Native New Yorker, I've had the privilege to sample some of the finest pizza in all of NY, pizza such as Totonno's, Grimaldi's, & Lombari's to name a few.  Great pizza artisan's in their own right and I take nothing away from them, BUT, Dom of Di Fara's Pizza, leads this pack of artisan pizza makers.Domenico DeMarco of Di Fara Pizza, AKA ""The Don""  is in a class by himself.  If you haven't had the good fortune of sampling his extraordinary pizza, then I suggest you do, If you don't, you will be doing yourself a disservice.Walking through his door, is like taking a step back through time.  The wood paneled walls painted green for a fresh look, are aligned with well deserved accolades & miscellaneous Italian art.  The counter looks original as do the tables & chairs.You immediately get hit with the sweet aroma of pizza and become almost catatonic.  You give your order and stand aside.  Waiting for at least an hour or so, you become fascinated by how easy he makes taking a pie of pizza out of the oven with his bare hands.  He follows through with drizzling some extra virgin olive oil, and the beautiful basil he cuts with a scissor over your pie.  Then you realize ""Oh yeah, its not my pie"", it's someone else's and you suddenly start becoming anxious.Soon enough the moment arrives, and you take your pizza to stay, because taking it to go, means more waiting, and that equates to unnecessary suffering.  And if you can not get a seat, then do what I do, eat it in your car.Then comes the first bite. You will literally feel like someone punched you in the mouth with some brass goodness.  It's that good.  So perfect, you'll taste every ingredient and savor every bite.When visiting remember to bring your own wine.  Dom is more than happy to open it for you and hand you some plastic cups. It doesn't get any better, or any more old school, then that.",5.0
"- Midwood is far with not much else to do out there- $5 slices and $28 large pies are pushing it- Waiting time can be atrociousTaken all that into account, that might be the best slice i've ever had.  I walked into that place already had lunch and half full.  I easily polished off 4 slices because it was THAT good.  The crust is salty and crispy and the tomatoes and cheese were both top notch.  fresh basil on top is perfect.  The amount of work and attention to detail that Dom and his crew do to make each pizza justifies the ridiculous cost of his pizzas.  This is not a neopolitan pizza made from a fancy oven or celebrity chef.  The place is not a fancy sit down place with proper plates, silverware or even drinks.  This place is an old skool pizza joint owned and run by a lifetime pizza maker who cares.  And I hope it never changes.",5.0
"damn tasty pizza! but i'm cheap, so $5 per slice for this goodness is a bit expensive for me.",4.0
"I really liked Di Fara.  Yes, I waited for one hour to get two slices (square).  Yes, that is a very long time for two pieces of pizza.  But it was really good.  If I go back I'll get a pie. Go with a group and get a square.  It's a little on the burnt side, but its a great little place.  Tons of charm.",5.0

"It's a real hike to travel to Di Fara, at least if you're living/staying in Manhattan.  I actually drove to NYC for the weekend just so I could take an adventure deep into the heart of the heart of Brooklyn in search of pizza.  Di Fara, L & B Spumoni Gardens, Lucali, Roberta's, Motorino, Grimaldi's...Brooklyn is pizza heaven!!!  Tip: If you drive to NYC, free parking in Brooklyn on the weekends...holla! If/when you finally make it to Di Fara, the $5 a slice you pay will be well worth it!  This pizza is just so fantastic, the freshest ingredients!  I swear Dom took the hot pizza out of the oven without even using an oven glove.  Seriously, the man has been making pizza so long that he's impervious to heat or pain!  Grimaldi's is still the best but Di Fara is a close second.  You won't make it to Di Fara every time you visit NYC but just make sure you visit Di Fara at some point, it is not to be missed.",5.0

"For those of us in New York who are in search of the best pizza around, Grimaldi's, Lombardi's, John's, Joe's, Nick's (and the list goes on...) are the obvious joints to hit up. For the more serious pizza hunters, a trek out to Midwood in Brooklyn to Di Fara's is an absolute must.Rated 26 in ZAGAT (out of 30. 26 is currently the highest rating given to a pizza place in NYC), Di Fara's is arguably the best pizza in New York. And even if you leave Di Fara's with a different opinion than most of your fellow pizza lovers, you'll definitely agree that it was a unique experience. At Di Fara's, you'll find yourself in Midwood, a neighborhood--once predominantly Jewish and currently very diverse---that I only know as being home to this famed pizza place. Di Fara's was opened by Italian immigrant Dom DeMarco in 1964, and Dom has been making the pizzas himself, day and night, every day, since then. He believes only one person should handle the pizza-making, and so when Dom can't come in, Di Fara's doesn't open. Because all the pizzas must be made by one man, we heard the service can be slow. So when we decided to go one Friday, we got there at 6pm (it opened at 6:30pm that night) to be first in line.Seventy-six-year-old Dom emerged from the back into the exposed kitchen a couple of minutes before 6:30, and we were quickly ushered inside the warm, outdatedly painted, pizza parlor. Make sure you know what you want because you order at the counter as Dom's children (he supposedly only employs family) eagerly await to scribble down your order, bang out a pizza and move on to the next hungry customer.We ordered the Di Fara's Special (sausage, onions, mushrooms, peppers- $32-- yes, Di Fara's is the most expensive pizza around. A slice is $5.) and 30 minutes later, our name was called, and we got to watch as Dom blessed our pie with fresh basil and parmigiano reggiano.When we finally got to sink our teeth into Dom's famous pizza, we quickly realized that all the other pizzas we've had in New York were NOT the best pizza around. Though I'm not experienced enough to state that this is the best pizza, I know it's up there. You can taste the three different cheeses he uses (buffalo mozzarella, regular mozz, and parmigiano reggiano), the tomato sauce is not too tart (San Marzano tomatoes from Italy), and instead of being greasy, it's olive-oily.There's something about the whole experience that makes you feel like you're in the real New York, whatever that means. So what if Dom sometimes burns the crust? It's a no frills, borderline dingy pizza place serving drool-worthy pies made by a man living his American Dream-- really, what's not to love?",4.0

"Wow this owner is no joke. 70+ years old (probably) and still baking pizza like a pr0.

It's something about the sauce or the cheese or his hardworking mojo touch that just makes the pizza tastes soo good! For once, I actually enjoyed a slice of thin, authentic Italian pizza.  Try it for yourself before he stops making pizza.

Luzzos beats the snot out of this place in every way shape and form.Lets just start with decor: Terrible, Trashy, Dirty.Service: Terrible: I dont think anyone comes here for service though.Pizza: Overly greasy, not much flavor besides the Basil.  It wasnt overly burnt like other people have written but just wasnt that great.At times it honestly felt like I ordered a Basil pizza, its the only thing on the pizza where the taste popped out.Overall im just really disapoined.  Go to Luzzos its a lot better.",2.0
"Yes the pizza was delicious and I will probably never have any like it again, but it took over 2 hours just to get it ..the place was hot, tiny, and not ventilated-so every time a pizza went in the oven a cloud of eye burning olive oil smoke filled the air. At $5 a slice and $28 a pie this man probably isn't doing it for the money anymore-so bless his heart for keeping at it for his customers.",3.0
"Wow this owner is no joke. 70+ years old (probably) and still baking pizza like a pr0. I finally got a chance to try cuz they're only opened like 12 hrs a wk lol let me just say I was hesitant to pay $5 for a slice of thin, burnt-crust pizza but trust me when I say this, once you try it you will be hooked b/c you will not be able to find another pizza joint with the same quality pizza. It's something about the sauce or the cheese or his hardworking mojo touch that just makes the pizza tastes soo good! For once, I actually enjoyed a slice of thin, authentic Italian pizza.  Try it for yourself before he stops making pizza. I heard he doesn't share his recipe with anybody, not even family lol and if you don't appreciate di fara one bit then you need to check out those taste buds lol (kidding)",5.0
The best pizza I've ever had! Getting the pizza is a pain in the ass but well worth the hassle. I would eat this every day if i could!,4.0

"Although I'm giving this place 3-stars, my sentiment falls more in line with the phrase ""meh, I've experienced better."" After years of raves reviews I finally made the trek to Midwood.  I arrived at opening so the wait time was not an issue, but upon receiving my slice, I was kinda disgusted by the large pool of olive oil/grease on the slice.  Usually I accept the grease considering that it's all a part of a pizza slice's unique appeal and a part of the experience, but this was more than I could handle.  So, I did that shameful act of blotting up the oil with some napkins.  The pizza was very flavorful and had nice hints of fresh basil, but between the slightly charred crust and grease, I honestly can say that it's not worth the price ($5 per slice) or the trip to Brooklyn from Manhattan.  Like I said 3 stars , but I've experienced better.",3.0
"I've tried all of the so-called ""best pizza"" places in New York, and DiFara's blows every single one of them out of the water. I've also made it my business to try the best pizza when I travel across the country, and DiFara's stands alone when compared to the best in Illinois, California, and even my beloved Taos Pizza Outback in Taos, New Mexico.DiFara's pizza is special in that the ingredients are delivered from Italy, from the tastey cheese to the sweet tomatoes for the rich sauce. Fresh basil and olive oil is spread over the top of every pizza, giving it a zing unlike any pizza you will ever taste. Unlike Grimaldi's and Lombardi's, the sauce covers the entire pizza, and there are no ""bare"" spots leaving you wishing for more topping. The crust is of the perfect traditional hand-tossed variety; not-too-thin, not-too-thick, and is tastier than 90% of all the crusts in New York. It has a buttery, crispy edge to it, and you will actually want to eat it, unlike most bland crusts in New York.When you go, just try it plain first--the pizza margarita. After you taste the pizza in its purest, most delicious form, feel free to add on your favorite toppings and experiment.DiFara's has odd hours, so make sure you check ahead of time. There is also not a lot of seating inside, so be prepared to either go early, or wait it out. And the price tag is 100% worth it if you want to experience what REAL pizza should taste like!",5.0
"(DISCLAIMER: I had just eaten roast beef sandwiches at nearby Brennan & Carr right before, and was pretty stuffed when I arrived here. Therefore, I may not have been able to appreciate the pizza as much as if I had not eaten anything like a normal person might do.)Di Fara was the 2nd stop in a south Brooklyn food tour that our friends had planned for us, and we got there right before 4pm, when they close the shop for a break. My g/f and I were giddy like kids on Christmas as we walked into the small storefront and saw the famous chef Dom working at his craft. He personally handcrafts every single pizza, and watching him do everything from stretching the dough to cutting up the pie was amazing and absolutely worth the trip. Make sure to watch right after the chef takes out the pie from the oven: he sprinkles freshly shredded parmesan cheese, cuts up basil leaves on top of the pie, and finally anoints the pizza with a couple drizzles of olive oil from his flask. Watching is free, but eating is going to cost you. It's $5 a slice, gulp, and I saw a couple people walk out with some tiny pieces. Therefore, if you're there with at least a couple other people, it is totally worth it to get a full pie, which is $25, even if you're full like we were. Since we arrived at an odd eating hour at 3pm, we waited about 1/2 an hour for our pie to be ready. When it came out, oh it looked so good BUT, and I'm really really sad to say this, it just didn't taste as magical as I thought. Perhaps we didn't give the pizza enough time to settle but the cheese and sauce completely fell off the top of one of the slices, and overall it was pretty messy. I also thought the parmesan sprinkles on top actually made it a little too salty and detracted from the rest of the pizza. On the positive side, the fresh basil provided freshness and bite, and the crust was thin and slightly crispy. And overall, I didn't think it was that oily, even with the final anointing of oil at the end. Trying to figure out where Di Fara ranks among the best of New York pizza is impossible. While it doesn't provide the satisfaction of a Grimaldi's or a Luzzo's, there is much more to the pilgrimage to Di Fara than just eating. Di Fara is about watching one man and his family put their love and soul into a pizza and allowing the public to experience a tiny piece of that.",3.0

"Had a horrible experience with this restaurant.  We went on a weekend and it was very busy and took 2 to 3 hours to get our pizza, which was horribly burnt and had to be re-done, which took ANOTHER hour and the pizza was still considerably burned but they served it to us anyways and after spending 4 hours trying to get pizza we were starving and desperate so we accepted and ate it even though it was pretty much ruined.   The old man who owns and runs the place takes so much care and pride in making the pizza by hand himself.  Its very cute to watch at first as he snips the basil by hand and drizzles each pie with Olive Oil, but it soon looses its appeal as you realize you may not get your pie before the next millennium.   The poor old man seemed overwhelmed by the constant stream of people coming in and barking orders and asking ""how long until my pie is ready"". I could tell that he burned our pizza on two occasions because he forgot it and left it in for too long while he was trying to (unsuccessfully) multitask.  I really felt sorry for him though.  It was like watching a perfectionist/control freak being pushed to produce at a faster pace than he was was comfortable with.  You could see that he was just as mad at himself for burning our Pizza as we were.  I don't think he realized that he burned OUR pizza twice in a row.  I would hope that maybe we'd get a free pie, or even a discount...but NOPE.The restaurant is more or less a stand up whole in the wall where you have to fight to get your pizza order in much like fighting to get a drink in a posh Manhattan bar.  There are 2 tiny plastic outdoor patio furniture type tables in the back of the restaurant to crowd around and eat.  No place to sit and wait for your pizza to be made.  The worst part is that locals come in all the time and get to put their order in ahead of everyone else or will call in their order and show up and skip the line.  The few bites of unburnt pizza we had were simply amazing though.  I really want to come back and try this place again on a slow day/time.  Definitley authentic New York Style thin crust pizza.  Fresh ingredients, many of which are shipped directly from Italy.  The owner is a first generation immigrant I am pretty sure.  The fresh olive oil drizzled on top and basil that he snips right off a live plant (both imports from Italy) send the flavor over the top.  This place is very well reviewed by all the papers and magazines.  I am pretty sure the pizza would be as good as everyone raves if it was not burnt.  BUT the rude service, slow speed, and lack of any seating are so bad it makes one question their sanity and pray that the pie is worth the hellacious experience.If i had to rate the bites of burnt pie alone, I'd give this place a 1.  If I had to rate the unburnt bites of pie alone, I'd give this place a 5.  If i had to rate the service, speed, price, or atmosphere alone, I'd give this place a 1.  Thus, I'll average that out to a 2 star experience.",2.0

"This is one of the best things I've eaten in my entire life. The people around me understand- they have experienced this very special place as I am doing now for the first time. DiFara Pizza. Nothing will ever be the same. I now understand The Perfect Pizza, and my mouth will never forget...The care with which this noble old man lovingly bends over each and every creation is a testament of tradition, and he shares his gift with yearning disciples who revere him and give him thanks. Each bite is a revelation- sweet mouthfuls of tomatoes, salty, chewy, charred crust.The fine quality cheese melting with all that olive oil... Ohhh olive oil... Then topped with basil, freshly cut over the warm pie. A euphoric pizza extacy.",5.0
"I've read the reviews talking about how DiFara Pizza is nearly heaven on earth.  We had our hopes set quite high, but not unreasonably so.  We already were on our way to Coney Island for the day, so it's simple enough to get off the train at Avenue J on the way back.  Entering the store is a little interesting, there's no line, per se.  Just one guy who takes orders in a really informal matter and Mr. Di Fara who makes the actual pizzas.It's really cool to see how he makes the pizzas and ""blesses"" them with herbs and olive oil when they come out.  The ingredients taste incredibly fresh.  Really very very good.But I'm reviewing this based on the experience, not just the food.  We arrived at 3:30pm on a Saturday and waited about 40 minutes for two slices of pizza.  When the pizza came out the slices were burnt on the edges but perfect in the middle.  Sorta a love hate relationship.  If you can get a piece that isn't burnt and doesn't require you to wait 40 minutes then go for it, if not, you might want to consider one of the other hundred or so fine pizza establishments in New York City.",3.0
"Hard to complain about a place where so much passion and a delightful purity of execution.This is one of the most honest business propositions I've seen: one man charges a higher-than-average amount while you wait for him to prepare your pizza personally for you. He's not fussy, but he's painstaking. Every detail clearly matters, even after 50 years mastering this repetitious trade.The resulting pizzas are truly delicious, though I concur with others who have mentioned that it might be even better with less of the drizzled oil.

"This is one of the best things I've eaten in my entire life. The people around me understand- they have experienced this very special place as I am doing now for the first time. DiFara Pizza. Nothing will ever be the same. I now understand The Perfect Pizza, and my mouth will never forget...The care with which this noble old man lovingly bends over each and every creation is a testament of tradition, and he shares his gift with yearning disciples who revere him and give him thanks. Each bite is a revelation- sweet mouthfuls of tomatoes, salty, chewy, charred crust.The fine quality cheese melting with all that olive oil... Ohhh olive oil... Then topped with basil, freshly cut over the warm pie. A euphoric pizza extacy.",5.0
"I've read the reviews talking about how DiFara Pizza is nearly heaven on earth.  We had our hopes set quite high, but not unreasonably so.  We already were on our way to Coney Island for the day, so it's simple enough to get off the train at Avenue J on the way back.  Entering the store is a little interesting, there's no line, per se.  Just one guy who takes orders in a really informal matter and Mr. Di Fara who makes the actual pizzas.It's really cool to see how he makes the pizzas and ""blesses"" them with herbs and olive oil when they come out.  The ingredients taste incredibly fresh.  Really very very good.But I'm reviewing this based on the experience, not just the food.  We arrived at 3:30pm on a Saturday and waited about 40 minutes for two slices of pizza.  When the pizza came out the slices were burnt on the edges but perfect in the middle.  Sorta a love hate relationship.  If you can get a piece that isn't burnt and doesn't require you to wait 40 minutes then go for it, if not, you might want to consider one of the other hundred or so fine pizza establishments in New York City.",3.0
"Hard to complain about a place where so much passion and a delightful purity of execution.This is one of the most honest business propositions I've seen: one man charges a higher-than-average amount while you wait for him to prepare your pizza personally for you. He's not fussy, but he's painstaking. Every detail clearly matters, even after 50 years mastering this repetitious trade.The resulting pizzas are truly delicious, though I concur with others who have mentioned that it might be even better with less of the drizzled oil.

"This is actually a 6-star review, if I could do that. Lives up to the hype! Worth the wait! A man who is a true craftsman, and his art form is pizza! Lucky us, lucky me for finally getting there, and lucky you when you go. With as many combinations of bread-cheese-tomato sauce that NYC has, how can one pizza be so superlatively fantastic? I dreamed about it after I ate it, I still could taste it the next day. Its like the best date in the world, ending with the sweetest kiss, so sweet you think about for days, re-imagining it, hoping to re-experience it soon. Yes THAT good. Seriously. The pizzas are oily, it is true. Dripping with olive oil actually. There is a clipping taped to the wall about a woman who lived to be 120 years old and drank a half cup of olive oil a day - and ate di Fara's like 4 times a week. I guess that's Dom's answer to that complaint. The pizza come out of the oven, and he grates Parmesan on its already bubbling mozzarella, then more olive oil, then fresh basil he snips with scissors. Its like, the olive oil sucks up all the basil and parmiggiano flavor and creates this extra layer of flavor. I couldn't even really think about the sauce until midway through slice, I was so busy experiencing the basil-parm factor. You know, if you want fast pizza, there are like 2 bazillion places you can go to. If you want true food art, slow food, communal, cared about, everything that NYC is not about, come here. Relax, enjoy, and feel lucky. I waited over an hour for one pie on the Sunday after Thanksgiving - and I NEVER, EVER wait for restaurants. But this is different. Next time I'll be like the guys next to me and bring a bottle of wine and just chill out. Its Italian after all.",5.0
"Pause and take in the sights as you wait to order: old counter tops, a vintage cash register, soda that comes in glass bottles, and the aroma of a perfectly crafted pizza with the best imported ingredients. Two kinds of mozzarella, and a Gran Padano grating cheese; a splash of extra virgin olive oil to connect the cheeses and the imported Italian flour dough. Wonder at Mr. DeMarco's arms as he takes each pizza out by hand and finishes the pie with fresh cut basil and oregano (from Israel). At first glance, I was wary of the sagging slice edge, but with the first bite the flavors come together in a rich saliva-inducing bite. So much for giving negative points for soggy slices. Fortunately, the rest of the slice holds up well, equally crisp and equally chewy. If you are used to the imitation cheese used by the chain pizza places, you will definitely taste the difference. The square slice is actually better than a regular slice, unbelievably. It doesn't possess the fluffy volume that we all love and trust to fill our stomachs when we really need a calorically efficient grab-and-go lunch. Instead, the dough is a little denser, able to soak in the nuances of the olive oil in the unpretentious gas oven. Trust me, the extra money spent on the square is worth it. (One member of our group couldn't help but eat 4 squares, which is about $20 on pizza, justifying that because his gf is lactose intolerant, he cannot come back anytime soon) The most humbling part of the experience is that with DeMarco working in such close proximity to the customers, there is 100% transparency. There is no pretense at all. The pizza is prepared in front of you, and as you taste, there is a distinct difference in the taste. This difference has been identified by many discerning critics as being the ""best"" pizza in New York, but everyone is entitled to different experiences. I've lived in NYC for more than 25 years and DiFara's pizza is now the standard by which all other pizzas will be judged. Mr. DeMarco hails from a fading generation of pizza makers, which is giving way to those who surround their food with trendy decor, cooking techniques, ingredients (gold flake pizza, anyone?), etc. Take time to take a trip out to Avenue J in Midwood and experience pizza in an unpretentious, unadulterated moment in time.",5.0

"The Mark W. Diaries: Part Deux --- Jan 22, 2007My name is Mark, and today was a big day for me... I finally got a date. Woohoo! After I had failed miserably to attract anyone from yelp, I turned to Craigslist... and it worked! Yaay! I got one response to my 17th ad and quickly fixed up a dinner date... I searched for a good place to take my date. Yelp reviewed this pizzeria called Di Fara highly --- that settled it. I would take my date, Holly, to Di Fara.I thought I'd watch something funny on TV, that I could repeat to her. So I got a DVD of the British comedy from my thirty something years, ""Some Mothers Do Have Them"". My, she will really think of me as clever now. After spending six hours watching that, I decided that I needed to get off my ass and start walking to Di Fara. After all, it was only three hours of walking time from home.As I make my way over the Brooklyn Bridge I hope that Holly's a hottie. But, I decide to lower my expectations --- I'll settle for a pulse.  I calm my nerves and roll up the good stuff. As I approach Di Fara I see a long line outside. Not good, I think to myself. These people probably don't have home delivery. Why else would there be a line? Why? Huh? I reach Di Fara and Holly recognizes me from the red rose I have tucked inside my shirt (clever ploy from the black and white movies...heh heh). She leans forward to greet me and I try to check her out... ""Nice, Nice"". Sorry, she asks me. Oh, I was saying the place seems nice. We decide to wait in line together. I think: not good. This girl is very inconsiderate. Shouldn't she have gotten in line before me to save me waiting time? The line is moving slowly. I finally get to see the famous guy who owns this place, Dom. Man, this guy is really old! Shouldn't he be put away in some island for the old, and not allowed to mingle with the rest of the society? I hope that he doesn't conk off before serving me pizza. Man, I hate this ""discrimination against the elderly"" law. Idiot lawmakers, it should be the other way around. I must petition to change it.Even though I am hungry, I try to listen to what Holly is chattering about. She seems excited about this guy, Dom, she is! How meticulous he is with the dough, how accomplished and brilliant he is ...ooh genius. I tune out. Blah Blah Blah Blah. I think about the Taco Bell dinner I could have been having. Now that is real food. Since Holly had told me that she was a foodie, I decide to impress her with my own knowledge.You know, I tell her, I think this old geezer should hire young people from Taco Bell. That way he'd be fast with the order. You know, if we were at Taco Bell, we would have been done with dinner and be home making out by now. I can't tell from Holly's expression what she thinks of my idea. Either she is dumb-struck by my genius or she is just plain dumb.I decide to continue: see that young dude who is standing next to the old geezer..he should be doing more work. Now, that's efficiency. Why does the old geezer need to customize my pie for me? I don't care if it is done by him or by that young dude. What's the difference? After all, the High School kids at Taco Bell do a great job no matter who is serving!I think Holly is upset now. She says angrily: but Dom is a master. He is using his experience to delight the customers with an incredibly tasty and delicious pizza. His movements may be slow and deliberate, but it's an experience - look at his craftsmanship: stretching the dough, dressing it with the sauce made from fresh San Marzano tomatoes, carving the slices of mozzarella over the pie, placing it on a wooden paddle and then in the oven, later pulling it out with his bare hands. Drizzling olive oil and sprinkling herbs over it. The pizza is a perfect balance of textures and flavors. It is a piece of art! I say nothing, but think: whiny woman! Still, I say to myself: Patience, man...eye on the prize!As our turn comes to be seated, I mention that we want take-out. I turn to see that Holly is about to have a heart attack! She is shaking uncontrollably. After a few seconds she says: This artist is creating a work of pure genius and you want take out? A work of art that should be enjoyed straight from the oven and you want: Take-out? You Philistine!I see a number of eyes looking in our direction. I stammer nervously: but I thought you wanted to make out. So, wouldn't it be better to take-out? (nice, poetic touch.. heh heh)Hearing this, she storms out. I take the pizza home with me. Who cares? She's the loser, I now have the whole pizza to myself. I take a bite. Hmmm, this pizza is really tasty. That old geezer must know a thing or two. Next time, I will ask my neighborhood Taco Bell dude why an old geezer can make better stuff than him. Yum, this stuff is very good. It's giving me a high. I don't think I need to smoke the other stuff today. Yummm(Inspired from a ""True"" review and reposted at the request of yelper",5.0
"This pizza experience was definitely different than any other. First off, the subway drops you off in an area that you're sure you're gonna get mugged in.. there are beer cans littering the tracks among who knows what else? Then, you walk up to Di Fara's where there is a line out the door, not because there are so many people waiting for pizza, but because Dom only makes two pies at a time! We ordered our pizza (round) almost immediately but had to wait a while for it to be made- so we split a slice of the thicker square pie.... DELISH!!! The crust, being baked in a gas oven as opposed to a wood fire oven, tastes really crispy and oily- almost like it had been fried. And the three different imported cheeses Dom uses are heavenly while the basil he takes from his windowsil to cut (with scissors) over the pizza were so fragrant and fresh. On to our custom pie- mushrooms, pepperoni, and olives... It was thinner than the square pie but just as delicious with the fried- tasting crust dripping with olive oil. The pepperoni was pretty thick, but nothing I couldn't handle. If it weren't for the fact that I was looking at a dirty, grease splattered wall while I was eating, I may have given Di Fara's 5 stars, but the place seriously needs a makeover. My boyfriend made a point that the ambience was part of the whole experience, as people from the city don't leave to just go to another cookie cutter pizzeria. I suppose I understand that arguement, but I really think if they took some pinesol to the place, I would be willing to go back.",4.0

However, for this one slice I had to wait 1.5 hours and spend $5. I know I know I should have gotten a pie and maybe next time I will but the memory of standing in that store with a hundred other people waiting for one pie keeps me from going back. And for that, I cannot give Di Fara's 5 stars...",4.0
"From LIC i finally ventured here. Really couldn't understand why this place has been on the spotlight so often, the pizza here it's ok, nothing special, I found the sauce to be on the heavier side, like over reduced, let alone that there was no AC and the temp outside was 90F. The floor it's dirty, not specially because there was lots of people.  Your best bet, if you're hungry for pizza and this is the only place, go for the pie, given that slices cost $5 e/a. To me, tearing fresh basil apart to place atop of the slice, does not justify the $5.",3.0

Then, you walk up to Di Fara's where there is a line out the door, not because there are so many people waiting for pizza, but because Dom only makes two pies at a time! We ordered our pizza (round) almost immediately but had to wait a while for it to be made- so we split a slice of the thicker square pie.... DELISH!!! The crust, being baked in a gas oven as opposed to a wood fire oven, tastes really crispy and oily- almost like it had been fried. And the three different imported cheeses Dom uses are heavenly while the basil he takes from his windowsil to cut (with scissors) over the pizza were so fragrant and fresh. On to our custom pie- mushrooms, pepperoni, and olives... It was thinner than the square pie but just as delicious with the fried- tasting crust dripping with olive oil. The pepperoni was pretty thick, but nothing I couldn't handle. If it weren't for the fact that I was looking at a dirty, grease splattered wall while I was eating, I may have given Di Fara's 5 stars, but the place seriously needs a makeover. My boyfriend made a point that the ambience was part of the whole experience, as people from the city don't leave to just go to another cookie cutter pizzeria. I suppose I understand that arguement, but I really think if they took some pinesol to the place, I would be willing to go back.",4.0
"wonderful pizza, made by a grumpy old man.What else could you possibly want?",4.0
"Finally came.  It was a joy watching the quiet and deliberate Maestro DiFara making his pizza pies.  Oh, and eating the pizza wasn't too bad either :)In Brooklyn tradition, they have a reputation for being gruff here. But if you're first in line, you'll be greeted with a softly spoken ""good morning"" from Maestro himself.  He's just a sweet grandpa at heart, I swear!",5.0

"I had to go to see this man. It's a pretty amazing concept and you feel special or lucky even to get to eat this pizza that this man is only allowed to eat. It was a treat watching him make it - very cute indeed. The pizza is delicious. As great as Brooklyn pizza is expected to be. I love the blend of cheeses and the fresh basil. However, for this one slice I had to wait 1.5 hours and spend $5. I know I know I should have gotten a pie and maybe next time I will but the memory of standing in that store with a hundred other people waiting for one pie keeps me from going back. And for that, I cannot give Di Fara's 5 stars...",4.0
"From LIC i finally ventured here. Really couldn't understand why this place has been on the spotlight so often, the pizza here it's ok, nothing special, I found the sauce to be on the heavier side, like over reduced, let alone that there was no AC and the temp outside was 90F. The floor it's dirty, not specially because there was lots of people.  Your best bet, if you're hungry for pizza and this is the only place, go for the pie, given that slices cost $5 e/a. To me, tearing fresh basil apart to place atop of the slice, does not justify the $5.",3.0

"A recent visit shows some things have changed over the years:1) they don't take advance orders anymore, so don't try to call ahead.2) they don't use dried oregano branches; they use the same shaker stuff everyone else does now3) they now have this jar of hot peppers in oil. holy cow, it's awesome - don't put the peppers on, but spoon some of that hot oil on your slice and you will not regret it!",5.0
"Plastered on the walls of the smoky interior of a little pizza joint in the Midwood neighborhood of Brooklyn are years of praise lavishly bestowed on Domenico DeMarco, proprietor and still principal pizza preparer. Since 1964, DeMarco has stood guard over the gargantuan oven with dough in hand. So why is the joint called Di Fara when it has always been DeMarco as the stalwart pizza maven? His original business partner was named Farina, and a portmanteau of their names became the famous Di Fara. Now most people who pride themselves on NY pizza perspicacity will have much to say about Di Fara, but outside the NY circle, large as it may be, Di Fara has not reached the fame of some of the other pizza places. I theorize that this has nothing to do with the quality of the pizza, but rather on the refusal for DeMarco to scale up his operation. The pizza procuring procedure is Byzantine at best, and arriving with a guide is not a bad idea. After waiting the requisite wait in the line that forms outside the restaurant at all hours, make your way up to the counter and choose from the $5 slices or opt for a ~$30 pie. Someone, likely one of DeMarco's children, will write up your order on a scrap of paper and simply call you when it's ready. The additional wait for the pizza could take quite awhile, but you should make sure you return in time, lest your pizza be presented to another patron. $5 for a slice of pizza. Expensive, yes, but Di Fara doesn't fail to bring in the crowd. Since I didn't make the trip out to Brooklyn too often, I had a slice of the thin, a slice of the deep-dish, and another thin crust pie. While utterly delicious, the pizza was undeniably oily. And though DeMarco might be making each pie himself, there were issues with consistency. Some crust comes out burnt, some too soft. The ingredients are tossed on capriciously by hand, though I'll admit there might be some sort of strategic topping placement that I didn't perceive. As you can see, the pizza is not much to behold, and from experience, I can tell you that next morning cold Di Fara's isn't nearly as appetizing. Given the long wait, hassle of ordering, cost, and inconsistency, I can see why Di Fara is often a hit or miss for pizza pilgrims. Still, if you're comparing the best pies in town, you can't leave out Di Fara as a contender.",4.0
"Pizza is great, but just a little overated... I ve had better. The wait for 2 slices was out of this world. I think what ruins this experience is the hype. Maybe if I wasnt expecting the worlds greatest pizza I would have enjoyed it more... And oh yeah... He needs to hold back a little on the olive oil and hire someone help him make these pizzas... You could teach anyone to do this as long as you have the proper procedure and ingredients. I give the Pizza a 4.5. It is a really good pizza. The cheese and sauce is great, as well as the basil.

The guy in front of me said he went there 6 times, and they were always closed or on holiday. They finally opened an hour later, at 6:45pm, by then, there were probably about 15 people waiting (with local kids skateboarding by making fun of you and yelling ""I love $5 pizza!""). It's better to go in a group and have your friends grab a table for you while you wait at the counter, the people are rough! People were running for the tables. The first group in got the first pie right away, next guy gets his pie in about 5 minutes, then I get my plain slices. You definitely have to wait at the counter and hold your spot or the pushy local behind will try to budge you. Got the lone chair that I saved with my coat at the folding table and enjoyed my slices.

I think the best time to go is 1/2 hour before they open, and be the 1st one in line, you'll get your pie right away.When I was finishing up my slices, the line had died down and I think it was probably only a 10-15 minute wait for a pie, most people just walked in and placed their orders right away.

I guarantee you will be thinking about why Dom hasn't changed his ways and hires some nice Italian guys to crank out more pizzas under his tutelage.

However, the round pies are usually on the soggy/watery side and when this occurs you wished you had not wasted upwards of 1+ hours for your food. I'd say your chances on getting a perfect round pie is about 20%. As mentioned, I love the square pie and the chances of getting a great square is about 85%...sometimes the bottom can be ""too charred"" for my liking. If you have 2 hours to burn and want to take your chances on getting a great pizza...do it! Just know that it sucks to wait soo long for something that cost more than normal for pizza that is at times sub par. I guarantee you will be thinking about why Dom hasn't changed his ways and hires some nice Italian guys to crank out more pizzas under his tutelage. The fact that he makes each pie to order is a nice novelty that wears very thin after 30 minutes of waiting. Just some food for thought...  Bon appetite!",3.0
"A slice at $5 or a pie for $25 (you save 37% to get the pie, so bring a friend).  Well-worth the trek into Brooklyn to this no-frills street corner slice shop, Dom makes every pie himself, trimming fresh basil with scissors onto the bubbling three-cheese blend.  Is the cost a bit much? That's up for debate...  But what exactly is a fair price tag when you can literally taste the love?",5.0
"Apparently I am missing something. All I hear (and read) about is Di Fara's, Di Fara's, Di Fara's - THE BEST PIZZA IN ALL OF BROOKLYN - I couldn't agree less.If rude staff that moves at a glacial pace, dirty dingy walls and ceiling tiles, broken chairs and tables and greasy, burnt pizza make for a fantastic dining experience, count me OUT! Let me not forget to mention that I could not even bring myself to eat the entire $5 slice that I had waited over half an hour for - the grease consumed my hands, wrists and forearms and the charred crust was equally as vile.I even went so far as to subject myself to a second round of this place, only to be let down even harder.I get the historical value of a business that has been around as long as Di Fara, but in my opinion, all this place has to offer is HISTORY!",2.0
"If only people would respect each other while waiting in line. I've had more and more frequent bad experiences with people taking my pie, making the already long wait excruciatingly long. For those of you who complain about the cleanliness, well, please go somewhere else and make the line shorter. The pizza is fresh and it is made in the hands of a very talented man.",4.0
Holy Sh*t!!! This is hands down the best pizza that i have ever had and it's such an experience going there. I am happy I was able to go with my family and cannot wait to go back.,5.0
"Great great great!!Go to watch Dom DeMarco lovingly make each pie, with mozzarella grated in rustic, imprecise chunks. Olive oil dripped over each pie, romano cheese sprinkled on top. Perfectly cooked till the crust is perfectly barely burned, then basil cut by Dom with scissors over the top.The lines are long for the $5 slices, but nobody complains about the price. Seems steep for a slice, and it would be if it was pizza like everywhere else. But this is another animal, a gourmet piece of cooking that you just want to gobble up regardless of price.",5.0
"Early on in the school year, my roommate and I decided to make the epic journey from Manhattan to Brooklyn, in search of the Holy Grail of Pizza, aka Di Fara's. It was a long, exhausting journey filled with lots of reading and crowding on the train, and by the time we actually got to Brooklyn, there was a small, hand-scrawled sign on the door: ""no more dough, will open again at 7:30pm"". We had arrived at 6:30pm. Any shopping malls or book stores to lounge around in and wait? Nope. After walking around aimlessly for an hour, we returned only to discover a large and rapidly growing line in front of the small door. Waited about another hour to get our pizza. It was 8:30 by the time we retrieved our beloved prize, and by that time my stomach was already eating itself.Therefore, I'm not really sure if the great flavor of the pizza was due to the fact that I was severely hungry or from the pizza itself, but the buffalo mozzarella and the fresh basil were awesome. The pizza was a little on the greasy side, but nothing a little napkin dabbing can't fix. Holy Grail? Maybe. Worth $5 a slice? Questionable, at best. But unless I move to Brooklyn, this was probably a once in a lifetime journey.",4.0
"I can tell that this place does not receive quite enough praise, so here's more. For starters, yes this is a little crap shack of a place on Ave J.

"The world has gone mad.Me and my buddy were in here today.  First off, we made the mistake of ordering a slice and a square - we later changed it TWENTY FIVE MINUTES later when we got the slice but the squares were going to be a bit longer, where we said, ""we'll just take two slices, please.""While we waited, we downed root beers, watched the smoke belch from the oven, and the old man lovingly create a pizza out of nothingness.  Yes, very nice.  There wasn't a huge crowd in the place, the usual suspects, guys in sweatsuits and Tap Out shirts - I could have been in East Boston. The next clue in this adventure should have been when the beautiful Jewess came sweeping in from the street, her big tortoise-shell framed sunglasses shielding half her face, and she ordered a square, GOT IT, and walked past us.  I glimpsed the square - it was a hacked up looking square filled with oily tomato sauce, so oily you could sail a ship on it - the slices, I will say, were not oily, but I digress. The crowd in here was a bit over the top (hence the hot Jewess), but then again so is this part of the world - and my family is from Borough Park, go figure.  One smart ass was in the background saying, ""Alright, who is the virgin to Di Fara's.""  I don't think he was talking to me, and if he asked me that after I actually ate my two slices I would have said, ""yes, we all remember the first time we've been F'ed.""As I said, the pizza is made from scratch.  Also, the fresh basil is a nice touch, cut with gigantic scissors, and the pie is slightly well done, which I like, and the crust was delicious, but for five bucks a slice and nearly a half hour of waiting, well, let's just say that Spumoni Gardens has it all over this place.It's Brooklyn, people, and it's pizza, calm down.  Going out for a slice shouldn't be an EVENT!",2.0

"I think the pizza at Di Fara's 4 stars - it is good but I have had better. The line is just so long and the counter staff is so unhelpful that I have to deduct a star for the experience as a whole. Honestly the best part of my Di Fara's experience was walking out the place with my slices and getting jealous looks from the costumers in line. As for the pizza itself the tomato sauce Dom uses is some of the best I have ever had. The crust is nice and thin but it was a little bit burnt. My biggest problem with the pizza was the cheese - it just lacks flavor.I have no problem waiting in line for good food, I have no problem waiting at the shake shack, but I just don't think the pizza at Di Fara's is worth more than a half hour wait. Come once try it for yourself but this place is not worth a return visit.",3.0

"Schoolin' it up near by (exercise science grad at BC, affectionately labeled ""Broken College""), and while I sought to quiet a craving of carbs away from the usual fare of chicken and rice or big-name fast food right outside campus. Then I realized the obvious: a calorie-bomb of a pizza slice is just a few blocks down, y'kno, so I could earn back all that was lost from my morning workout. So, I speed-walked over and order a slice (Big mistake. Big. Huge! ...I ordered a second.) from Avenue J's gem, and didn't mind the NYCish price--many of the ingredients were imports. Sad that the basil was out that day. I love basil. Ate one there, unwillingly eavesdropping on two Russian ladies carrying a loud conversion about how fresh each other's groceries were in half-Russian/half English (Russlish? Englsian?). Triumphantly returned to campus, a warm Sicilian inside a greasy paper bag in tow.",3.0
"Everything they say is true, but I'll be the first to tell you how to really enjoy Di Fara's pizza. Go for lunch on Saturday around 1:30pm. Have a friend, or in my case, parents with you.

"Di Fara is only open for a few hours a day. When i went, the place opened 45 minutes late, and a long line had formed outside. I waited almost an hour for one single slice which costs twice as much as any pizzeria in New York. The place itself is a small little den with no a/c which makes it very hot in the summertime.

"I think the pizza at Di Fara's 4 stars - it is good but I have had better. The line is just so long and the counter staff is so unhelpful that I have to deduct a star for the experience as a whole. Honestly the best part of my Di Fara's experience was walking out the place with my slices and getting jealous looks from the costumers in line. As for the pizza itself the tomato sauce Dom uses is some of the best I have ever had. The crust is nice and thin but it was a little bit burnt. My biggest problem with the pizza was the cheese - it just lacks flavor.I have no problem waiting in line for good food, I have no problem waiting at the shake shack, but I just don't think the pizza at Di Fara's is worth more than a half hour wait. Come once try it for yourself but this place is not worth a return visit.",3.0
"Best slices in New York. Period. Ignore the decor, don't focus on a 30mins line of hungry people waiting, appreciate that tediously slow process with which Dominic makes each pie. Its all worth it!!! Strongly recommend the square slices with porcini mushrooms.",5.0
"Schoolin' it up near by (exercise science grad at BC, affectionately labeled ""Broken College""), and while I sought to quiet a craving of carbs away from the usual fare of chicken and rice or big-name fast food right outside campus. Then I realized the obvious: a calorie-bomb of a pizza slice is just a few blocks down, y'kno, so I could earn back all that was lost from my morning workout. So, I speed-walked over and order a slice (Big mistake. Big. Huge! ...I ordered a second.) from Avenue J's gem, and didn't mind the NYCish price--many of the ingredients were imports. Sad that the basil was out that day. I love basil. Ate one there, unwillingly eavesdropping on two Russian ladies carrying a loud conversion about how fresh each other's groceries were in half-Russian/half English (Russlish? Englsian?). Triumphantly returned to campus, a warm Sicilian inside a greasy paper bag in tow.",3.0

"I did my research. I read the first two pages of reviews at Yelp. I felt I knew enough to at least act as if I knew what to do once I entered the haven of gustatory excellence. I prepped by not eating or drinking all day so as to have my innards as empty as possible by the time I arrived.I chose a day with gorgeous weather (good for standing outside if necessary) that was a weeknight, the better to possibly avoid the crowds.4:31 p.m.: The downtown Q train departs 57th Street.5:15 p.m.: The Q train pulls into the Avenue J station, and I get off.I descend to the street. Shockingly, there is no one anywhere near the pizzeria.I walk up and can see people inside, behind the locked front door, the woman who is presumably Dom DeMarco's daughter sweeping the floor. I am first in line! I have a novel with me and the Daily News, and I am already reading the News, so I lean up against the doorway, content to watch the parade of locals stream by in the sunshine, a breeze rippling up and down the street. But aside from a couple and two young guys who show up about 15 minutes before 6, the huge crowd I have been anticipating never materializes. While waiting, I eye the menu board and decide what I want. I also scope out the refrigerator and the table selection, spying the small circular table I want and fully ready to pounce on it if necessary once the doors open.6 p.m. comes and goes, and there is no sign of any effort being made to unlock the doors. The couple behind me is a little antsy, she noting aloud that it is 6 p.m. and craning her neck to see inside. I know, from reading the reviews at Yelp, that the doors open whenever the family feels like opening them. I have nowhere to be. I am content.At 6:10, Dom DeMarco's daughter comes to the doors and unlocks them and spreads them open. She then walks behind the counter and stands poised with a pen over a looseleaf tablet, ready to take my order. I order a regular pie with green olives and artichokes. Dom is there, of course, and he sets about the process of making the dough, grating the cheese, spreading the sauce, and distributing the olives and artichokes on the pizza. Meanwhile, I put my bag on the chair that was at the small circular table.I am pleased to see there are more than just the three tables that previous Yelpers had reported seeing. Not that the seating capacity is much greater than I had thought; there is probably seating for 10 to 15 people, probably closer to 15. I grab a couple of 8-ounce Diet Cokes and a 12-ounce can of seltzer from the fridge, and Dom's daughter tells me I will pay for the drinks when I get the pizza. I go back and get a Diet Pepsi for good measure. (Tab: $38.)I look for a bottle opener for the Diet Cokes, thinking it might be hanging off the side of the cooler. Then I spot a bottle opener sitting atop the napkin dispenser on the main counter. I take the bottles over and relieve them of their caps. Ten minutes later, Dom's daughter says loudly, ""OK, Peter?"" It is 6:20. She had put an empty tray on the counter, and, like clockwork, Dom had brought the pie out of the oven and set it, still bubbling, atop the tray. The master looks at me, smiles in a kindly grandfatherly way, and asks, ""Is this your pie?"" I say yes, and he nods and pours some more olive oil atop it, sprinkles some more grated cheese around the pie, and snip-snip-snips some basil all around the pie. Basil flies everywhere. Then he cuts the pie into triangles; I think there were eight altogether. I sprinkle crushed red peppers over the pie and add liberal doses of oregano. And now the moment of truth has arrived.I bring the pie over to the table, which is just large enough to accommodate the tray with a few inches to spare, most of that taken up by the array of drinks I had waiting. I put the newspaper basically under the tray so I could read it. The slices are better suited for eating with a knife and fork. In fact, I wish I had one of each and think about asking Dom's daughter, but I don't want to appear a rube, so I pick up the wayward huge green olive-as big as a Yankee's World Series ring--or artichoke and place it atop a slice of gooey goodness. Then, I spy a fellow diner using plastic utensils and ask him if they were out somewhere or if I have to ask at the counter. He says, ""They're up there, to the left."" Sure enough, in trays I had not seen at the far left of the counter are little labeled drawers containing plastic forks and knives. The pizza is, as some Yelpers have noted, unevenly burnt, but I don't care. Each piece is a delightful fiesta of flavor to be savored in the mouth, each crust a wonder of puffy, chewy excellence.I blitz through five slices, two thirds of the pie. Three slices remain. Alas, I have eaten and drunk as much as I can. I return the tray with the uneaten slices to Dom's daughter and thank her, and I leave. It is 7:30.I walk away, sated.

"DiFara's is in a class by itself.  I first read about it on the cover of the Village Voice in 2003 as being the best pizza in the city (no one had ever heard of the place and all the food critics went stampeding out to Midwood - I read review after review after that).  Unfortunately, I waited 6 years to go there and finally made it out this Summer (and then went back every other weekend until now).  I cannot stop kicking myself that I have missed out on 6 additional years of DiFara's heavenly pizza.Some people say that Mark (Marc?) at Lucali's learned how to make pizza by watching Dom and asking questions.   I'd say that he has the basics down but Lucali's is a step down from DiFara's.On my most recent visit there, I brought a friend who kept pestering me by saying, ""What's so special about the pizza?""  I said, ""Just taste it and you'll see.""  She was skeptical.  We waited the usual time and got our first slice.  I let her have the first bite and she exclaimed, ""Oh dear baby Jesus!""  I'm not sure what that means but the next plaintive words out of her mouth were, ""Why did we only order 2 slices??!""  (They let us order more.)I went with my mom on Labor Day weekend.  We spent the usual 2 hours at DiFara's - 1 hour to order, 1 hour to get the pizza.  My mother and I ended chatting with a Brooklyn native who was like the ringmaster for everyone waiting.  He was funny and charming and, because of him, everyone ended up talking to everyone while watching Dom make pies.  My mother was completely fascinated and entertained watching Dom do his magic.  It was one of the best, most bicker-free times I've had with my mom. I met someone recently who said she hated DiFara's pizza and that L&B Spumoni Gardens was much better.  I instantly knew her judgment was bad and that we wouldn't be friends.  ;-)",5.0

"When does eating pizza become a truly unforgettable experience? Is it the distance one has to travel to get there? Hop aboard the Q train and get off at Avenue J; A 40 minute trek from Times Square. Is it the location? Located in Midwood, Brooklyn; Di Fara's features a crude, hand-painted sign, grungy interior and dirty tables. Perhaps it's the wait for your pizza to be made? Domenico De Marco (Dom for short) churn's them out at an earth shattering pace (a 45 minute average). Is it the ingredients? Fresh and canned San Marzano tomatoes for the sauce, a combination of high-quality regular mozzarella, imported fresh buffalo mozzarella, a generous sprinkle of Grano Padano, and a then the Coup de grace; a drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil and a fresh basil.So when does eating pizza become a truly unforgettable experience...when you eat pizza at Di Fara's Pizzeria. Forget what you know about pizza, Di Fara's transcends what you thought was good or even great pizza. I didn't know what to expect coming all the way out to Midwood. I had heard good things but remained cautiously optimistic. Walk in and expect to be greeted by the throng of people inside. Thus, your pizza experience begins with the wait. Yes, the wait. Bring friends, or bring a book because you'll be waiting for a minimum of 45 minutes, but as their pamphlet tells you, ""Sorry, but it's worth the wait."" Worth the wait indeed!Dom is the man, the legend, the master himself. He alone makes the pizza, hence the wait. Watch as he artistically cradles the dough, making sure not to over work it. It's truly a labor of love. Watching Dom work, one will begin to think that pizza is his religion and after you're done eating, you'll worship him forever.Don't be quick to grab your pizza once it comes out, it's still not finished. Let Dom hit it with his Coup de grace; a generous sprinkle of imported Parmigiano Reggiano, roughly cut aromatic basil imported from Israel and a luscious drizzle of extra virgin olive oil.The final step is your first bite. It is transcendent. It is unique. It IS delicious. No need to describe the crust, sauce, cheese, or even the rich, sweet yet nutty olive oil. This pizza is one you'll have to experience for yourself to truly believe it. I did.",5.0
"Hole in the wall place run by an old school guy who makes every pizza by hand himself (burning his fingers in the process).  Last Sunday they were closed for a few hours because they ran out of dough but reopened at 7PM after which a huge line formed waiting to get in and sit at the few tables inside.  Freshest of ingredients, cooked just the way I like it: dough had plenty of chew with a perfect amount of char.  I'd put it in my top three of New York Pizzas (Totonno's and Grimaldi's are on that list).",5.0

He treats each pizza as a real meal NOT just fast food or a quick bite to eat so give the man some time to work his magic. The olive oil Basil and crisp crust give this pizza its distinct flavor. The real joy comes when dom hand scissors the final pieces of fresh Basil on your pie, at this point you will be starving from the wait, and you are ready to begin your feast.

"Despite the warnings about Di Fara's far-flung location, slow pizza-making, formidable lines and poor organization, it turned out to be incredibly simple to get pizza here. It was a straight shot on the Q from our hotel in Tribeca, and we were there in 30 minutes. We meant to line up before 12, when we thought they opened, but didn't make it there until around 12:50. Turned out they open at 1 on Sundays, and there was a modest line waiting for Di Fara to roll up the grate. The first few pies went to the groups ahead of us, and in no time we were at the front of the line, being offered slices from a steaming cheese pie. We had intended to order an entire pie ($28) but happily forked over $15 for three slices and ate them standing outside as a long line quickly formed. The sauce, blend of cheeses, drizzle of oil and scattering of basil atop a thin, chewy crust were just perfect. The crust's blackened bottom was imparted a beautiful charred flavor. Instant pizza at Di Fara - we felt like we had gotten away with something!",5.0
"DiFara's is in a class by itself.  I first read about it on the cover of the Village Voice in 2003 as being the best pizza in the city (no one had ever heard of the place and all the food critics went stampeding out to Midwood - I read review after review after that).  Unfortunately, I waited 6 years to go there and finally made it out this Summer (and then went back every other weekend until now).  I cannot stop kicking myself that I have missed out on 6 additional years of DiFara's heavenly pizza.Some people say that Mark (Marc?) at Lucali's learned how to make pizza by watching Dom and asking questions.   I'd say that he has the basics down but Lucali's is a step down from DiFara's.On my most recent visit there, I brought a friend who kept pestering me by saying, ""What's so special about the pizza?""  I said, ""Just taste it and you'll see.""  She was skeptical.  We waited the usual time and got our first slice.  I let her have the first bite and she exclaimed, ""Oh dear baby Jesus!""  I'm not sure what that means but the next plaintive words out of her mouth were, ""Why did we only order 2 slices??!""  (They let us order more.)I went with my mom on Labor Day weekend.  We spent the usual 2 hours at DiFara's - 1 hour to order, 1 hour to get the pizza.  My mother and I ended chatting with a Brooklyn native who was like the ringmaster for everyone waiting.  He was funny and charming and, because of him, everyone ended up talking to everyone while watching Dom make pies.  My mother was completely fascinated and entertained watching Dom do his magic.  It was one of the best, most bicker-free times I've had with my mom. I met someone recently who said she hated DiFara's pizza and that L&B Spumoni Gardens was much better.  I instantly knew her judgment was bad and that we wouldn't be friends.  ;-)",5.0

"A buddy of mine had recommended Di Fara's before I left for NY, but I wasn't planning on going there because I was already going to Spumoni Gardens and Grimaldi's. But while I was at Spumoni, a guy standing next to us at the counter overheard me and my friend talking about heading over to Grimaldi's afterwards and he adamantly suggested we take a little detour and fit Di Fara's into our itinerary as well. Two strong recommendations from New Yorkers? Fine, I'll go.I'm glad I went. It turned out to be my favorite thin crust pizza in all of New York (and I guess it didn't hurt that there was absolutely no wait on a Thursday evening in December). $5/slice is definitely not normal, so I'm somewhat relieved I don't live nearby. But I'm also sad that I don't live there because I wouldn't mind eating their pizzas every so often. All the toppings (as you've probably read from the other reviews) are fresh, the sauce is sweeter than usual, and I love the cheese and olive oil on top. But what impressed me the most about this pizza was the crust. It's extremely thin and the bottom is slightly crispy from the oven. However, despite how thin the crust is, the bread is still doughy and chewy. I love that! Is the water in NY really that different or is Domenico De Marco just that awesome? I'm guessing it's a little of both since none of the other thin crusts I had in NY were that chewy.Keep it up Signore De Marco!",5.0

Di Fara's is truly the best pizza I have ever tasted (and I live in New York). The perfect 3-cheese blend, fresh toppings, and seasoned-to-perfection sauce, nestled in harmony atop a thin, crispy crust are Mr. DeMarco's ingredients for heaven in a 13 inch pan. It is every bit worth the wait, the weight, the short hours, the price, etc.Skeptics, trust me on this one.

"I'll start with the pizza.  It was very good.  It was better than your average pizza.  The ingredients were fresh and the pizza was full of flavor, though maybe I'm only saying that because of the dozens of articles from various publications posted on wall telling me so.  Fresh basil was cut for our pie right before it was served.  Yes, it was certainly a delicious pizza and you could tell that care was put into making it.There was a downside, however, that seemed to dominate our experience.  It was the wait.  The sign on the door said they were opening a half hour late, but the actual opening time was even a half hour later than that.We were the very first people to put in our order, but got worried when we saw one, then two, then three groups get pies before us.  Then people were served slices.  Then pie after pie came out of the oven and went into boxes for carry-out.  All the while, the place seemed chaotic with people standing on top of each other and smoke from the ovens filled the air.It was a full 45 minute after opening (and almost two hours after the original opening was supposed to be) that we finally got a pizza.For the first 40 years of Di Fara's life, it may have been a traditional and dependable neighborhood pizza joint, serving great pizza to the people of Midwood.  For better or for worse, that is no longer the case.  Now, as the articles plastered all over the wall tell me, it's one of the best pizzas in New York.  Unfortunately that seems to have come with a price.",3.0

"A buddy of mine had recommended Di Fara's before I left for NY, but I wasn't planning on going there because I was already going to Spumoni Gardens and Grimaldi's. But while I was at Spumoni, a guy standing next to us at the counter overheard me and my friend talking about heading over to Grimaldi's afterwards and he adamantly suggested we take a little detour and fit Di Fara's into our itinerary as well. Two strong recommendations from New Yorkers? Fine, I'll go.I'm glad I went. It turned out to be my favorite thin crust pizza in all of New York (and I guess it didn't hurt that there was absolutely no wait on a Thursday evening in December). $5/slice is definitely not normal, so I'm somewhat relieved I don't live nearby. But I'm also sad that I don't live there because I wouldn't mind eating their pizzas every so often. All the toppings (as you've probably read from the other reviews) are fresh, the sauce is sweeter than usual, and I love the cheese and olive oil on top. But what impressed me the most about this pizza was the crust. It's extremely thin and the bottom is slightly crispy from the oven. However, despite how thin the crust is, the bread is still doughy and chewy. I love that! Is the water in NY really that different or is Domenico De Marco just that awesome? I'm guessing it's a little of both since none of the other thin crusts I had in NY were that chewy.Keep it up Signore De Marco!",5.0
"It's de-lightful, it's de-licious, it's Di Fara! This small, dingy eatery on Ave J has forever redefined ""pizza"" in my mind and has transformed me into an overnight culinary snob. Di Fara's is truly the best pizza I have ever tasted (and I live in New York). The perfect 3-cheese blend, fresh toppings, and seasoned-to-perfection sauce, nestled in harmony atop a thin, crispy crust are Mr. DeMarco's ingredients for heaven in a 13 inch pan. It is every bit worth the wait, the weight, the short hours, the price, etc.Skeptics, trust me on this one. Unlike Avatar and Justin Bieber, Di Fara Pizza is 100% worthy of all of the hype it receives.",5.0
"DO NOT FALL FOR THE HYPE!!lots of oil, burnt crust and the sheer arrogance of the owner and his family that work here..its all an ego stroke for dom...I went here, the place is over priced, you can get much better Pizza at a lot of difference places around the city. the lines and hours are wack...what I will say that is positive...the ingredients used are extremely fresh and you can taste the tomato and cheese. very fully flavors.. for the price you pay you should be able to seat down and enjoy yourself, nope, I have seen better seating in jail cells ....this does not look like a place that serves $4 slices or $20 pies......OVER PRICED!!! forget this spot...save your money dont eat oily burnt slices.........side note, we waited in line, he opened an hour and a half later after the scheduled time (such an arrogant pr*ck) and the worlds most mind numbing conversation was coming from this big mouthed idiot girl who my gf wanted to put a muzzle on her big gigantic c**t mouth",2.0
"I'll start with the pizza.  It was very good.  It was better than your average pizza.  The ingredients were fresh and the pizza was full of flavor, though maybe I'm only saying that because of the dozens of articles from various publications posted on wall telling me so.  Fresh basil was cut for our pie right before it was served.  Yes, it was certainly a delicious pizza and you could tell that care was put into making it.There was a downside, however, that seemed to dominate our experience.  It was the wait.  The sign on the door said they were opening a half hour late, but the actual opening time was even a half hour later than that.We were the very first people to put in our order, but got worried when we saw one, then two, then three groups get pies before us.  Then people were served slices.  Then pie after pie came out of the oven and went into boxes for carry-out.  All the while, the place seemed chaotic with people standing on top of each other and smoke from the ovens filled the air.It was a full 45 minute after opening (and almost two hours after the original opening was supposed to be) that we finally got a pizza.For the first 40 years of Di Fara's life, it may have been a traditional and dependable neighborhood pizza joint, serving great pizza to the people of Midwood.  For better or for worse, that is no longer the case.  Now, as the articles plastered all over the wall tell me, it's one of the best pizzas in New York.  Unfortunately that seems to have come with a price.",3.0

"Stepping into Di Fara's Pizzeria, I violently shook rain droplets from my hair and squinted at the bright green paint on the walls. Stepping boldly to the counter, my movements and breathing sounds suddenly seemed brash and inappropriate. Glancing at the rings of black soot that have gripped the upper walls and ceiling for years, I gently leaned against the refrigerator, holding my breath.A reverential silence hovered in the shop, as awestruck patrons stood at the counter watching Dominic DeMarco methodically shred hunks of buffalo mozzarella and spread it lovingly to the edges of a tender crust. A mound of freshly sliced mushrooms was dispersed with the same care, and then Dominic turned away from the crowd, his seasoned hands slowly lifting this glorious pie to the oven racks. He subsequently transferred a bubbling cheese pizza to a large delivery box, haphazardly clipping a bunch of fresh basil over its steaming slices. Then, a handful of romano cheese was sprinkled without flourish, its flecks evaporating in the tomato sauce. As the crowd quietly climaxed, two patrons placed their money on the counter and obsequiously carried their pizza outside. Three NYU students then arrived, and the spell was broken.For the next 45 minutes, we collectively listened to the tapping rain, contemplated the true meaning of tweeting, and watched Dominic and his son navigate the cramped kitchen with experienced postures.

Given my trouble walking in a straight line when sober, and my tendency to flail my arms when I am speaking, I was envious. Soon, our order was ready. Our pizza was gorgeous, fragrant with freshly snipped basil, olive oil, thick pepperoni slices, sliced garlic, buffalo mozzarella, and romano cheese. Unfortunately, Dominic's hand heavily oiled our pizza before and after it was placed in the oven, and our slices were drenched, to the point that only the chewy, salty, slightly charred edges resembled a crust. I was unable to fold my slices without dropping hunks of meat, garlic, and tomato on my plate, and resorted to picking bits of toppings up with each bite.

I only wished old man Dom would cut more up! I recommend coming with friends to eat a pie, because it's much cheaper (prices below). And you have been warned: the pizzas are really filling, which probably stems from all the oil that Di Fara is infamous for. A round pie is probably good for 3 and square is probably good for 3-4. And come prepared to watch a show. As other reviewers have mentioned, Dom, a guy probably in his 70s, makes all the pizzas by hand alone. He spreads the sauce and cheese, slides the pies into the oven, pulls them out, and etc all by the counter. It really is a one of a kind show.And the prices as of today (06/10/09) were: $4 a slice (round or sicilian), $20 a round pie, and $25 a sicilian pie.",4.0

"I had this place at the top of my list for my New York trip.  I have been to Pizzeria Bianco in Phoenix and Mozza in LA and Di Fara is supposed to round out the top three best pizza places in the USA.  I was expecting five stars all the way on my long subway trip out to Brooklyn.Let me say it was great to watch Domenic toil over a hot oven for his passion, and being first in line for dinner hours and getting the first pie out of the oven was great, too.  Scratch that, I was confident I was in pizza heaven.  But my heaven only lasted through two slices, as I was sharing my pie with others and had ordered a few slices other to sample the sicilian style.  Well, I was not notified until an hour later that Domenic does not like making slices and therefore would wait until every whole pizza was finished to make my slices.  Mind you, I worked hard to get there early enough to be first.Another half hour passed and the rest of my party grew weary of waiting for a couple slices of pizza, them not being the pizza fanatic I am.  I had to cancel my treasured slices and leave.  I honestly think I would have been there for three hours if I hadn't cancelled.My advice: order whole pies ONLY.  This would have been an easy five star rating if I didn't have to leave hungry because Domenic decided he doesn't like making something he has on the menu.  What a huge disappointment.",4.0
"One of my top five pizzas in NYC (that says a lot), but i understand why it's not for everyone. I appreciate that  a bit of burtness is a desired state in high-end pizzza, but sometimes it could be a bit much here. Still, the pizza's so good that i'm able to overlook this detial. Don't go when you're really hungery or in a rush or wanting to sit down in a half-decent place to eat. Buy every pizza lover needs to try this place at least once.

"I'd give the pizza four or five stars, but there were a number of negative aspects to our visit that detracted from the overall experience.I'll start with the good: It was fun to watch Dom carefully (and slowly) make each pizza, and finish off each one with a handful of cheese, cut up basil leaves, and some olive oil.  The location is right next to the subway, so you don't have to trek around Brooklyn on foot to get there.  And of course, the pizza itself was good.And the bad: There were only two people working (Dom and another guy), and when we got there it took 10 minutes before anyone even came to the counter to take our order.  When we were done eating, we waited another 10 minutes before someone came to the counter and allowed me to pay.  The place is small but it wasn't too hard to get a table, but having a table didn't matter because there weren't enough chairs.  The soda from the cooler was warm.  And even though the pizza was pretty good, the crust was burned on half of it, and even the unburned crust was too crunchy and not very appetizing.We went on a Saturday at 12:15pm (they opened at noon) and it wasn't too crowded, but even without the crowd we waited probably 35 minutes for the pizza.  It looked like the wait got much longer shortly after we ordered.  I'd say it's worth a trip to Brooklyn to try Di Fara's pizza once, but I would definitely try to pick a time (like we did) that avoids the crowds and long waits.",3.0

"I was doing web searches for the best New York City pizza places because it was going to be my first time there. Di Fara popped up and I decided to make it one of my birthday meals. After the long subway ride to Brooklyn, the place was right on the corner of the street.The place is very small and has only maybe 5 or 6 tables. Luckily we got a table. It took about 45 minutes to get our pizza after ordering.  We ordered one of the round pizzas, which was about $30 because we added toppings. It's a steep price, but I knew that before going.When I was called to get my pizza, the cook (the only one it seems!) came up with some fresh basil and used some large scissors to cut them over the top.The pizza was great! The pizza at Di Fara is different from what I'm used to (I live on the West coast). But I must say it was well worth the money!  I've had better pizza, but that's only because I'm used to eating the pizza I grew up on here in the West.The edges of the pizza can come out a little burned on some spots, but the pizza is large enough were you can skip those slightly burned areas. The middle is great!  When you bite in to a piece of the basil, it can catch you by surprise. But, that's part of the charm.I would highly recommend Di Fara Pizza if you have quite a bit of time to kill and want to make a special trip out to Brooklyn.PS - CASH only.. they do not accept credit cards or other forms of payment.",4.0

And now that I have had Di Fara, none of my other former favorite pizza places even come close to measuring up now. Seriously, after the first bite of this pizza, my three friends and I were all speechless. Though, we did make some weird moaning noises. This is one of those foods that kind of changes the way you think about food forever.We ordered both the plain round and a square special.

Gone back a dozen times now to midwood. This is not an easy place to get to from Long Island. He never ceases to amaze me with his craft.

"oh. my. god.When I hear someone say ""this is the best pizza place"", I tend to be skeptical. There's nothing too special about the atmosphere of this place.  For the most part, you have to go out of the way to get to it, even though it's just a short walk from the subway stop.  But it looks like a typical pizza place. Friendly staff, small seating area, cash only, nothing special.But the pizza!  THE PIZZA!  DELICIOUS!Fresh basil on everything is wonderful!  Definitely the best pepper and onions pizza I've ever eaten!  Everything was just... amazing!  Definitely worth the trek down there!",5.0
"Near perfection...maybe perfection, better than Grimaldi's not by much but still better.  This was better than any of the pizza I've had anywhere (including several in Italy).  The pizza was thinner than I prefer and seating was extremely limited, but damn that shit it good!    At first I was horrified when I saw him pouring oil on the pizza but I loved it.  Not much else to say that other people haven't said already.  Next time I'm trying the square pie (thicker, more like a Sicilian style).",5.0
"Wow, this place really lived up to the hype!  After reading some reviews about the wait times, we decided to head there for a late lunch around 3pm which was good.  We put in our order and probably only waited about 15-20 min for our pie.  It felt longer because the place is a hole in the wall and I was stressed about securing a spot at one of the mismatched tables and not enough chairs.  (I feel like I want to donate extra chairs and non-broken tables to them.)  After we found ourselves two spots and tasted the first bite, everything was easy going after that. :) Fresh basil, drizzled olive oil on top, good cheese covering, tasty sauce, soft and thin crust...and clearly made with love.  We got roasted red peppers on a regular large pie that were sweet and caramelized to perfection. Definitely recommend!",4.0
"This is as good as it gets.  I can't imagine a better pizza.  Actually, I can't imagine a better food experience.  My friend and I were baffled as to how making such a simple food so amazing is possible.  It is impossible to describe how good the food is and do it any justice.  You just have to trek out to Midwood and find out for yourself.",5.0
"Absolutely the best pizza I have had so far.  Dom is a complete artist and perfectionist.  Every time I order pizza from here I get the same delicious, consistent product.  You cannot beat the ingredients that goes into this masterpiece.  Everything is so fresh tasting.  If I am in Brooklyn I will always make a stop here.  I encourage everyone to try this pizza when they are in the area, and are willing to dish out around close to 30 dollars for a pie or however much they are charging currently.",5.0
"I was doing web searches for the best New York City pizza places because it was going to be my first time there. Di Fara popped up and I decided to make it one of my birthday meals. After the long subway ride to Brooklyn, the place was right on the corner of the street.The place is very small and has only maybe 5 or 6 tables. Luckily we got a table. It took about 45 minutes to get our pizza after ordering.  We ordered one of the round pizzas, which was about $30 because we added toppings. It's a steep price, but I knew that before going.When I was called to get my pizza, the cook (the only one it seems!) came up with some fresh basil and used some large scissors to cut them over the top.The pizza was great! The pizza at Di Fara is different from what I'm used to (I live on the West coast). But I must say it was well worth the money!  I've had better pizza, but that's only because I'm used to eating the pizza I grew up on here in the West.The edges of the pizza can come out a little burned on some spots, but the pizza is large enough were you can skip those slightly burned areas. The middle is great!  When you bite in to a piece of the basil, it can catch you by surprise. But, that's part of the charm.I would highly recommend Di Fara Pizza if you have quite a bit of time to kill and want to make a special trip out to Brooklyn.PS - CASH only.. they do not accept credit cards or other forms of payment.",4.0

The freshness just leaps off the pie. The pizza is drizzled with olive oil and fresh basil which make a delicious topping to the otherwise bare regular pie. Don't expect a loaded pie, these are very thin, perfectly crispy and unbelievably flavourful pizzas.

"The constantly notoriety and mentioning of the marquis establishment owned by one Domenico De Marco deserves a much delayed pilgrimage in the most sought after, best pizza in the 5 boroughs.I arrived at Di Fara's Pizzeria at 7:00pm on a Wednesday evening (as I live about 10 minutes away) and found the place to have less occupancy than expected.  There is no need to mention anything about the décor except for the follow description illustrated by my friend Vinny...""The place looks like a freakin bomb went off in it.  Then the place was fixed up really nice, and then another bomb went off inside it.  That's what you have today"".Couldn't help but laugh when first envisioning his statements and then applying it to the actual apparatus.  Expect nothing of the décor other than this being another hole in the wall type place that serves high recognized Pizza.My friend George and I opted to order the traditional round pie, no toppings.  There were approximately 10 patrons in front of us so the wait was going to be about 45 minutes.  Luckily, we managed to find a seat.  As the minutes slowly passed, we saw the numerous amounts of patrons, put in their order, leave, and come back to either pick up or dine in.*Note to future patrons...  Di Fara's allows for call ins ahead of time for pick up or dine ins.  Time wisely, and this can be a painless process.Finally... After 45 minutes of waiting and watching, Master De Marco presents us with 1 of his 300 daily produced pizzas!The application of the pizza was extremely simple...Master Da Marco starts the application with flattening a piece of Imported Italian Flour Dough to form a 1/8"" crust.  The flattened dough is then coated with an evenly distributed amount of San Marzano Tomato Sauce that nicely coats the dough, but doesn't drench it.  The last step prior to baking is to have a cheese application on top of the sauce.  From my observation, the cheese consists of three different types.  I was only able to determine that one from the mix of cheeses used was of course, Fresh Mozzarella.  The Pizza is then put into a 650 degree oven for baking @ approximately 20 - 25 minutes.  Upon retrieve, the bubbling cheese and steam generated by this application is highly noticed and produces watering of every salivary gland on the tongue.  The pizza is finally finished off a heavy coating of grated Pecorino Romano, chopped Fresh Basil (Master Da Marco holds the Basil stems and cuts it with blue scissors), and a heavy drenching of Imported Italian Extra Virgin Olive Oil.Let the feast begin...When first retrieving the Pizza, there is only one thing that comes to mind...WHY THE HECK IS THERE SO MUCH EXTRA VIRGIN OLIVE OIL ON THIS PIZZA!?!?!Seriously...  The excess application of the EVOO distorted and mangled the well baked crust of this pizza.  In fact, the excessive amounts of EVOO used, caused the pizza is become slimy, and thus, had to be eating with two hands, even when folded.  I must admit, deciphering the Pizza itself was the most challenging part as the EVOO overwhelmed every bite of Pizza!  Despite trying to hang dry the pizza by letting the EVOO drizzle off, the taste itself was still distorted and rejecting.  After constant attempts, I was able to achieve a singular bite that allowed for the appreciation of the various flavors used in the application.  It was evident with this one bite that Master De Marco's use of the Imported Italian Flour, San Marzano Tomato, and Three Cheese Application was well put in creating a robust taste.  The delicate nature of the dough crust worked well with the richness of the San Marzano Tomato sauce, which opened the gates to the fluffy yet heartiness of the cheese.  Of course, this observation only came from one bite of Pizza as the rest of the time was spent wondering where Master Da Marco gets his EVOO from since there was must a sale going on if he's using this much!After about 2 slices, the excess EVOO finally took its toll, and the pizza became more Burdensome Corpulent rather than Flattering and Humbling.  I opted to finish off my remaining 2 slices just so there would be no leftovers.After the final bite, the overwhelming application did not produce any feelings other than the excessive burden that was placed before me in having to consume so much EVOO during one sitting.  I seriously kid you not when I state with certainty that Master De Marco could've filled a 6oz cup with the amount he used on the Pizza.I've deliberated with numerous previous patrons of Di Fara's and they've confirmed that the excessive oil is De Marco's signature application...Think it's wise if I go back and ask Master De Marco to go light on the EVOO?  I'm tempted to take on such a task but I need not have a Soup Nazi incident nor have my butt whooped for having offended the legendary Avenue J master.Of course...  I will ask for less EVOO to be used in the application.  Thus setting up my future update review.",2.0

We went on a Saturday afternoon so all you see were hipsters there.First off one slice of pizza is $5!! Seriously, you would think the pizza must be awesome if the owner can jack up the price and people are still willing to pay for it. It was burnt at different places so we couldn't eat the whole of the slices we got. The dough was thin, the crust was dry and didn't offer much taste nor did it compliment the toppings, sauce or cheese. After the pizza was taken out of the oven they added the cheese and cut up some basil on top.The pizza was amazingly oily. The cheese was fresh and tasted better than a typical pizza place. The sauce wasn't anything special.I have no idea what others see in this place and the high ratings. I don't think my taste buds took a day off or anything so I have to say I totally agree with all other reviewers that were not only disappointed but felt they were had by the charge of $5 a slice for average pizza!",2.0

"I tried this place many years ago. At that time I thought the pizza was mediocre at best. But passing by the neighborhood again I thought I would give it another try. We went on a Saturday afternoon so all you see were hipsters there.First off one slice of pizza is $5!! Seriously, you would think the pizza must be awesome if the owner can jack up the price and people are still willing to pay for it. It was burnt at different places so we couldn't eat the whole of the slices we got. The dough was thin, the crust was dry and didn't offer much taste nor did it compliment the toppings, sauce or cheese. After the pizza was taken out of the oven they added the cheese and cut up some basil on top.The pizza was amazingly oily. The cheese was fresh and tasted better than a typical pizza place. The sauce wasn't anything special.I have no idea what others see in this place and the high ratings. I don't think my taste buds took a day off or anything so I have to say I totally agree with all other reviewers that were not only disappointed but felt they were had by the charge of $5 a slice for average pizza!",2.0
"Reviewing this place seems nearly pointless as I know its glory can be called common knowledge. When I was in High School (2 avenue blocks away from the pizzeria) I would splurge nearly weekly on a slice and an Aranciata. This is not High School priced pizza! Maybe in Manhattan, or in the Slope, but not public school priced. Piling up the quarters that could have gone to 40s of OE...now that is devotion.",5.0

"Certainly among the best pizza in the city. Other noteworthy features include the lighting (which serves as a medically accurate test of whether you have epilepsy), the wait (~1.5 hours on top of the subway ride to Midwood), and the ventilation (oh right there is none, have fun trying to breathe in a small room shared by a giant old pizza oven). Overall, it's worth a trip for the surreal experience, but don't actually expect to enjoy the entirety of it.",3.0
"I'd say it's mostly worth the hype.  My pizza was delicious - fresh tomato sauce, cheese, olive oil, basil and the fanciest, thickest pepperoni I've ever seen.  The divey-ness of the place and it's recent bout with the health department didn't phase me - it's old school, man.  However, in the realm of pizza, and maybe I'm alone here, I feel that there isn't too much separating an exceptionally good slice with a mostly good slice except for an hour long wait (at 12:15! - I'm sure those in the know must start assembling at 11:45) and a price of $30 a pie with topping.  I'm glad that I made the trek, that I experienced a bit of pizza history that will surely disappear soon enough, that someday I can put on a fake Brooklyn accent and tell the kids about the good ole days, but I'm not sure it's a trek I'll make again soon.",4.0
"As my friend Seth said, ""This guy is the pizza Terminator"".  This is as good as pizza gets.  The ingredients are top of the line and if you can find a pie made with more love tell me where.  Our pizza with house brined olives & garlic was nothing short of epiphinal.  The pizza reveals ever changing layers of flavor, all the while intoxicating the nose with the perfume of Basil permeating from the steaming hot cheese and oil.  This was my first journey to DiFara's and I can't imagine a trip back to NYC without a visit to this place.BELIEVE THE HYPE!

"I'm a big pizza guy and the rep this place has peaked my curiosity.   I was a bit disappointed to say the least.   Mr Di Fara is indeed a culinary genius.   Every one of his pizzas are painstakingly hand made by him.  there are four to five different cheeses and imported olive oil and home made mozzarella going into each pie.  When you bite into the pizza, the flavor explodes in your mouth.   Now my problem is not with the food but rather with the way the business is run.   The culinary prodigy is a 70 -ish old man who moves pain stakingly slow.   And the other counter person is either his son or his daughter who happen to lose at rock paper sissors that  day.  The wait is usually about forty minutes because he can only pump out one pie at a time and there are usually a line going out the door.  A feat that cannot be taken lightly since he is located in the middle of a hasidic neighborhood of coney Island and ave J.

"OK. I hate to be the pizza curmudgeon (well, not really -- I actually don't mind in this case). But this place is waaaay over-hyped.In fact, I would venture that if a Di Fara pie were subjected to a blind taste test of pizza-loving NYers, along with pies from other highly-rated pizzerias, the Di Fara would maybe, just maybe be judged average (or slightly above average).I think a fair number of the ecstatic reviews and superlatives that are heaped on Di Fara's pizza are the result of a combination of suggestion (the godawful lines, the interminable wait, and the excitement of seeing the grand master at work, pouring the olive oil and clipping generous mounds of fresh basil onto the pies) with the lemming effect (EVERYbody else and his mother says it's ""the BEST pizza,"" so it's gotta be the best, right?).It's kind of like the assumption that expensive wines taste better than cheap wines -- a proposition that has been shown in multiple studies, that is, blind taste tests, to not be the case, at least for the average taster -- see for instance,freakonomics.blogs.nytim…pnas.org/content/105/3/1…wine-economics.org/worki…What's wrong with Di Fara pizza, you ask? The tomato sauce, which is more a dried tomato juice than a proper sauce, is too bland; it should be sweeter and needs more spices. The cheese tends to form an oily mess that is much too salty and lacks the sweet creaminess of the fresh cheeses used in the best pizzerias. The edges of the crust are more often than not burnt to the point of being inedible. The meat toppings (eg pepperoni) are second- or third-rate. And he uses too much oil; this is a pizza, not a salad gdammit!Now, add to all of that the sickly off-yellow lighting and the squalor and grime of the place, both in the seating area (with its rickety chairs and tables that are seemingly never wiped off) and -- worse -- behind the counter where the pizzas are being made, and its a wonder anyone has an appetite left when the pizza is finally done.I do marvel at the dedication of the proprietor, who is a veritable Cal Ripken Jr of pizza-making, steadfastly turning them out one after another, day in and day out, year after year, each one getting the master's touch. And in my experience, both he and his daughter at the counter are some of the nicest people you will ever meet in any restaurant (let alone pizzeria).All in all, Di Fara's is a nice little neighborhood joint for a local slice, but ""the best"" in NYC it is not.

But this place is waaaay over-hyped.In fact, I would venture that if a Di Fara pie were subjected to a blind taste test of pizza-loving NYers, along with pies from other highly-rated pizzerias, the Di Fara would maybe, just maybe be judged average (or slightly above average).I think a fair number of the ecstatic reviews and superlatives that are heaped on Di Fara's pizza are the result of a combination of suggestion (the godawful lines, the interminable wait, and the excitement of seeing the grand master at work, pouring the olive oil and clipping generous mounds of fresh basil onto the pies) with the lemming effect (EVERYbody else and his mother says it's ""the BEST pizza,"" so it's gotta be the best, right?).It's kind of like the assumption that expensive wines taste better than cheap wines -- a proposition that has been shown in multiple studies, that is, blind taste tests, to not be the case, at least for the average taster -- see for instance,freakonomics.blogs.nytim…pnas.org/content/105/3/1…wine-economics.org/worki…What's wrong with Di Fara pizza, you ask? The tomato sauce, which is more a dried tomato juice than a proper sauce, is too bland; it should be sweeter and needs more spices. The cheese tends to form an oily mess that is much too salty and lacks the sweet creaminess of the fresh cheeses used in the best pizzerias. The edges of the crust are more often than not burnt to the point of being inedible. The meat toppings (eg pepperoni) are second- or third-rate. And he uses too much oil; this is a pizza, not a salad gdammit!Now, add to all of that the sickly off-yellow lighting and the squalor and grime of the place, both in the seating area (with its rickety chairs and tables that are seemingly never wiped off) and -- worse -- behind the counter where the pizzas are being made, and its a wonder anyone has an appetite left when the pizza is finally done.I do marvel at the dedication of the proprietor, who is a veritable Cal Ripken Jr of pizza-making, steadfastly turning them out one after another, day in and day out, year after year, each one getting the master's touch. And in my experience, both he and his daughter at the counter are some of the nicest people you will ever meet in any restaurant (let alone pizzeria).All in all, Di Fara's is a nice little neighborhood joint for a local slice, but ""the best"" in NYC it is not. In fact, I wouldn't even call it the best in Brooklyn.",3.0
"Call ahead.  If you get lucky, someone might answer and take your order, and then you won't have to wait on line for two hours.  If you don't pick it up, there might be hell to pay.(I could describe the thinnest, most delicious pizza in the world; I could ponder how he gets basil to grow under fluorescent lights; and so on.  But it's been done.)Think of it this way: people from Manhattan are willing to come out to Midwood.  That must mean something.",5.0
"In NYC many places trade on the hype and hyperbole that surrounds them. e.g. P. Luger's steak whilst very good, does not make the clouds part on a rainy day nor eclipse the live performance by Vienna Symphony Beethoven's ""ode to joy"" high in the Austrian Alps on a summers eve.... BUT ...the pizza at Di Fara's is perhaps that rare place that lives up to it's hype and justifies the schlep from just about anywhere to taste the magical combination that is dough, tomato, basil, mozzarella cheese and time in stove clearly from the Pleistocene period... I was in toe with the finest pizza eating babe from Italia so I was slightly nervous to show her wass' up in the depths of  beloved BK....suffice to say it was all good, however there needs to be a update to the ventilation system.....i like a good smoke now and then but sitting in a smoke filled box not terribly pleasant ...but neither of us were complaining after getting those slices down..we like it Di Fara...molto real...\\ side note ....grab some tall boy cans of beer from the deli next door..makes the medicine go down all the better...",4.0
"This pizza is great! Top three gourmet pizza in NYC (Grimaldi's, Lombardi's) I love the fresh basil and the oil that is used on this pizza.Be prepared for a 45 minute wait during the weekends-greatness takes time.It's a bit pricey for a pie, but worth it.",4.0
"This place is great.  The artichoke and the regular are my favorite and I love the liberal application of basil. Yeah you'll wait in line sometimes, and you might get an occasional slice that is a little greasy-but it's tried and true and pretty damn good.  It's not trying to ride the over wrought gourmet wave and its not a schlubby frat boy's 4am goto. And I know there is good pizza all over the city.  If you feel that way, don't come here. It's ok.  Just stop crying about it.",4.0
"GOT LUCKY AGAIN WITH NO LINE! Stopped by again today. Got there at 5:20pm on a Sunday. A sign by the door read (closed 5-6pm). Dom wanted some rest. Doors reopened @ 6:10pm. I noticed two gentlemen (his sons?) helping Dom today with the ordering/cleaning today. This time we came to try the regular slices. It started getting packed at 7pm.This time I observed how Dom makes his pies:-Hand tosses the pizza dough-Spoons the tomato sauce and spreads it-Shaves parm reggiano and hand spreads the cheese-Pours EVOO on it out of a copper tin canAfter the pizza comes out of the oven:-Hand cuts basil over it-Hand grinds romano and spreads it-Pours more EVOO on itWhile reading the walls waiting for our slices, we noticed a few interesting facts:-Dom came to the US in 1959-Dom bought out his partner in 1976-Di Fara is a combination of 2 last names, Dom's and his former partners'-The '00' flour is imported from ItalyI also observed:-San Marzano peeled canned tomatoes are used here - they are the only brand w/ the president's seal on them. Dom steps on 2 boxes w/ his flour dusted shoe to reach the top oven-Filippo Berio EVOO is used here-Icontornelli cattina peperoncini piccanti tagliati (99oz glass jar) is used here -Coluccio Various Wild Italian Mushrooms (huge glass jar) is used hereOrdered:Regular slices [w/ pepperoni] ($5/ea) - ordered 3 slices, VERY generous w/ the toppings, quite delicious, enjoyed this more than the square special toppings, crust was perfectly chewy, was dripping EVOOIt is safe to say that after today, my quest for the perfect pizza is officially over.Pics: meetup.com/teamfoodie/ph…",5.0
"$4 for a slice???? Okay, the pizza is really good but if you are germaphobic as I am sometimes, beware. It's dirty but everyone seems to hang around there like it's the last drop of water on earth. Would it kill him not to touch money and pizza with the same hands? Okay, enough with that.. onto the price. Sure it's delicious but you may regret it once you munch it down within two minutes... and I'm not frugal by any means. I just to see what it is I pay for.

"In general, I think most New Yorkers would agree that our image of being rude, obnoxious, self-important assholes couldn't be farther from the truth, and that we are, overall, quite polite and nice.  However, when it comes to Di Fara's, all bets are off.  When we arrived yesterday at 5:15 Dom was just locking the door, posting a sign in the window that said ""Open at 6"".  At 5:45 they changed the opening time to 6:20.  At 6:30 they still hadn't opened the door, but they let people place their orders at the window, presumably to get a head start.  Great, we think to ourselves, our pizza will be ready when we get in!  OMG LOL BEST JOKE EVER!At 6:45 the door finally opened, and it was then that the gloves came off.  All the nice people who for the last hour and a half had stood patiently in line chatting amiably with their neighbors rushed in and filled the small space in front of the pizza counter with no regard to who had been ahead of whom in line.

When we grew so tired of listening to her that we finally relinquished our chair on the condition we get it back upon the arrival of our pizza, she continued to berate us for not giving it up sooner.We got our first pizza just after 7:30, and yes, it was delicious, but 2 and a half hours delicious? I'm not sure anything is.  A sneaky and evil old man STOLE our second pizza, but we managed to get the next one that came out, and that was quite good too.   As we left, we saw two groups begin to argue about who had been waiting longer for our seats, and others pushing and shoving to get to the front of the counter space.  Honestly, the whole experience was some of the ugliest human behavior I've seen in a long time, and I was genuinely sad witnessing the levels people were willing to stoop to.  It's pizza, people!  A little perspective, please!Pizza alone:  5 starsEverything else:  0 stars",3.0

This did.I can now say I have have the best pizza in New York, and quite possibly anywhere.First of all dont worry if you get there and theres a line. After watching what this man does you'll realize why it takes a little longer. You have to understand he's slicing mushrooms only per order. Pepperoni per order. Cheese per order. Yes EVERY PIZZA has cheese but he doesnt shred it until its about to go on your pizza. The very best pizza I've ever had. I do not like basil normally. I die for this mans basil. It made me want to cry when he handed me my pizza. You can't seriously not feel like hes a grandfather that just called you over to his house made you a pizza and now your leaving without staying to visit. Its seriously like love in a box. OMG I have food issues, but I swear to you this pizza is not pizza its love. It should be shaped in a heart. The taste is the most obsurd thing you will ever have in your life.

"I recently ate at Di Fara with a few friends and the pizza was awesome. Eating at Di Fara is an all-evening event. We got there around 6pm and weren't able to get in the front door until around 6:45. After placing our order, we waited another hour for our pizza. And this was a rainy weeknight. It's worth the wait.We ordered round and square pies to compare, and I definitely preferred the round pie. The flavor is incredible. My only complaint is that they go very, very heavy on the olive oil. I would have been happy with about half of what he put on. Nonetheless, the pizza was beyond delicious and the whole experience was fun. It takes too long for me to go here regularly, but it's a fun place to go every once in awhile for something different.",4.0

"I cry for this man. No seriously I have no words. Actually I have words. Listen.....I can say that I have trecked down a few places I have seen on tv. NONE have lived up to the real hype. This did.I can now say I have have the best pizza in New York, and quite possibly anywhere.First of all dont worry if you get there and theres a line. After watching what this man does you'll realize why it takes a little longer. You have to understand he's slicing mushrooms only per order. Pepperoni per order. Cheese per order. Yes EVERY PIZZA has cheese but he doesnt shred it until its about to go on your pizza. The very best pizza I've ever had. I do not like basil normally. I die for this mans basil. It made me want to cry when he handed me my pizza. You can't seriously not feel like hes a grandfather that just called you over to his house made you a pizza and now your leaving without staying to visit. Its seriously like love in a box. OMG I have food issues, but I swear to you this pizza is not pizza its love. It should be shaped in a heart. The taste is the most obsurd thing you will ever have in your life. I didnt like New York, but If I am ever back on the east coast I would drive hours upon hours for this pizza. Seriously.",5.0
"What can I say?  If we are traveling within 50 miles of this joint we always stop in, traffic-be-damned.  Always the slice of cheese, with the tomatoes and the fresh basil.  Regular slice, not that square cut crap.  Always delicious.  Every. Single. Time.  I don't even really like pizza as a rule.  I guess the wait time is a part of the culture of the place.  For any other pizza I would never wait 40 minutes, but for this one I will.  Here, patience begets great pizza.  Still the best slice in NYC.  We'll be back.",5.0
"Quite possibly the best pizza in New York, and therefore America.  Each pizza is painstakingly hand-made by the owner who is quite comfortable moving at the speed of a slower, simpler time.  The wait can be long, but it will all be worth it when you take that first bite.  There is also something to be said for ordering a pizza and watching a craftsman at work as he makes it for right before your eyes.  The fresh herbs that are hand snipped from their branches, only add to the deliciousness.  n.b. Bring a book.",5.0
"The bad: cramped, crowded, kinda dirty, LONG WAITS (even longer if you order an uncommon variety by the slice).The good: excellent pizza.  I didn't find it ethereal, but it was still delicious.Note: they open later than they claim to (9PM), watching Dom do his thang is charming and hunger-pain-inducing, his kids are really nice, and sinking your teeth into this pizza is, simply, indescribable.",5.0

"OVERRATED!!!! OVERRATED!!!! Okay I know this not a popular opinion, but it is the truth. Most of the reviewers here are blinded by the fact they have to validate spending 3 hours waiting for Pizza. Now I can appreciate a true artist, but let's be serious here. I have been here on 3 separate occasions and I have walked away disappointed all 3 times. It is about time we bring some true objectivity to this board.Let me break it down here:FoodFood is #1. After waiting 1.5 hours for a pie and slice on multiple occassions,  I was seriously not impressed with the limp and greasy slice I received. While the ingredients are probably top notched, Dom failed to really bring it all together. One of the slices I received was not cooked crispy enough. It fell apart instantly under the heat of the cheese and sauce.  ServiceAnybody that is truly objective here can see that the system is insane. You walk in there and there are no lines or any system for that matter. I am used to disorder and chaos growing up eating and shopping in Chinatowns in NYC. I would rather deal with that then this chaos. I stood at the counter and watched Dom do everything. While that is admirable, it also is one of the dumbest things I have ever seen. He has to flip the dough, sauce the pizza, drop the cheese, and put it in the oven. He even needs to be the one to cut the Basil and slice the pizza. Let's be honest guys. A monkey can cut the basil and slice the pizza. The reason I bring this insanity up is that by having him do all of these steps, the pizza is backed up for hours and as a result the food is inconsistent. Yes that seems crazy, but I saw how the intensity of the crowds start to push Dom and as a result things get all out of whack for him. Cooking times for pies are varied, orders get mixed. etc. I am sure the food at one point was great. However my experience was surely less than stellar. It was not once, but 3 times. Twice by myself and once with a group that wanted to drag me there based on bad reviews such as the ones on this board. Please open your eyes and think objectively for once Yelpers!!",1.0

"Last week, a bunch of us got together to watch the NBA playoffs and we ended up picking up some pies from Di Fara. My Wizards went on to beat down the Cavs by 30 points and we ended up getting 4 pies: 1 plain, 1 porcini, 1 pepperoni, and 1 sausage. First of all, I HATE pepperoni like it stole family property. The kind you get from Papa Johns and Pizza Hut are always salty, greasy, and crunchy at the same time. How do they get that way? You gotta try to get anything to suck as bad as the pepperoni does at most places. Alas, I suffer in silence whenever I have to get pizza with friends. People get surprisingly pissed off when you criticize their favorite toppings. The loneliness of this pizza-topping stigma has followed me my whole life.This pepperoni that Dom uses was unbelievable. Chewy, thick and shaped like a tire instead of a frisbee. Not too salty. Not too greasy. It was amazing. I loved this slice of pepperoni so much. In fact, this slice challenged every preconceived notion I had about pepperoni. It shook my fragile id to it's very core. In a delicious way.  All of the toppings were fantastic. The porcini was great and so was the sausage.  All of the toppings were sliced surprisingly thick but none of them were overpowering. The blend of 3 cheeses was the proverbial MVP and the oil and basil were nominated for the 6th man of the year award only to lose in an extremely close contest to the handmade crust. This was, by far, the best pizza I have ever had.  So if there are any other pepperoni haters out there who read this review, you don't have to suffer any longer.

"Man, this place has all the ups and downs of a family business that's been around for a while.The ups have everything to do with having eaten one of the best pizzas I've ever eaten.The downs have everything to do with age and not wanting/needing to scale given what they can get away with charging (it really is that good, when it's good).The problem is...  even after the agonizingly long wait (ours was half an hour which is on the shorter side, actually), you still might not get a perfectly-executed pie.  My brother and I were lucky enough to get a GREAT one, and the restaurant benefited from us buying at least 6 sodas between the two of us over the course of ordering, waiting, and finally eating...  but there were plenty of other pies that were burnt to a crisp including one that filled the place with smoke.  In the end, best pizza gutbomb ever, every time, n% of the time.  Go get it while n is still high enough to keep the guy going, I guess.  I do say ""the guy"" because the place does seem like it's all the one older guy and his single oven, painstakingly poring over each pie while everyone else is simply there to do everything that isn't pizza-making for him.",4.0
"Nothing I could say here would contribute anything new. Essentially, I am here to fall heavily enough onto the review bell curve so as to eventually negate the reviews that have been less than 5 stars so Di Fara will hopefully read ""5 stars, 573 reviews"" instead of ""4.5 stars, 572 reviews.""I do not live in Brooklyn, I live five hours away in Brookline. But every time I step foot in Manhattan off the Bolt Bus, I save an afternoon and an evening for making this epic pilgrimage down to Q line onto Avenue J so I can get some of Domenico the Pizza Wizard's sorcery into my stomach.I can't resist making a completely unimaginative and disrespectful comparison like making the Hajj to Mecca. This is a journey you must plan for: it costs you a large chunk of time and a large chunk of money, and to have that stand as the basis for your review calling this place less than stellar is to functionally misunderstand the concept. It's written all over the walls in the write-ups from NYC magazines over the past several decades, the guys who work for Dom explain this to you, the horde of people suffocating the small size of this place indicate it to you... what more explanation do you want? You're going to pay a lot of money for a pizza and it's going to take a long, long time... but good lord is it worth it.I accept that it is a valid criticism too say that Domenico goes too heavy on the olive oil, underneath the pizza, throughout the pizza, and on top of the pizza. But it's part-and-parcel with the overall heavy pizza he constructs in general.The herbs he grows on the windowsill of the business that he then coarsely chops with scissors all over your pizza... oh man is that good, and essential to the flavor of each pizza.The fact that the ingredients are sort of scattered variously around the surface area of your pie leads to an interesting variation of the flavor from slice to slice... this piece has more pepperoni, this piece is all pizza and no toppings, this piece is herb city. Honestly, I don't think that's naive; it's exciting. This is what it is to have something prepared gourmet by an artisan. This what what that means, in the dictionary and stuff. This is one product, mass produced by one guy, who needs to take a break in the middle of the day, and has the right to do it whenever he wants for as long as he wants. His pizzas speak for themselves, and the demand will never decrease because he doesn't function on the same clock a business of more than one would.",5.0

"I finally had the opportunity to taste the savory slice of Di Fara.  My bf and I decided to have pizza for lunch and since I've never tried Di Fara before he suggested we go there.  Just walking towards the corner where the pizzeria sits, you would never notice it was open for business.  It's really dark inside, so you can't see the crowd of people waiting until you walk right up to the doorway and say to yourself ""holy cow!""  We walked in confused.  We couldn't figure out where we should order, so we started to ask random people if they knew where the line was.  Funny as it may seem, but they didn't know either and yet they had ordered their pizza already.  We made our way to the counter and ordered 2 slices.  There was no way of knowing who came first, so you just need to stick by the counter and plant your feet there hoping the girl taking the orders remembers you walked in before the others.Di Fara really would not be so packed if it wasn't for a one man show.  It takes Dom literally 15mins to prepare a pie to be placed in the oven.  The poor man is so old now that he works like a turtle.  He does have a younger man in the back preparing the dough and that in itself takes  the same amount of time as preparing a pie.I can't say that it was totally worth the 45mins wait for a $5 slice, but I do give them the credit of using fresh ingredients and Dom making every single pie in this establishment all by himself.  If you're looking to enjoy a slice of pizza on the go... don't go!  If you're looking to try the infamous Di Fara's pizza, I suggest getting a pie - it's a lot cheaper (not including any toppings).",4.0
"I had only one meal (lunch) to have while visiting from SF and this is where we decided to go because we were in a mood for pizza.

Would I go back anytime soon? Probably not, although we did enjoy the pizza quite a bit. We got there at noon, but the line was still short. we waited about 45 min. or so for the food.

My only complaint is the wait, it could be run way more efficiently but the guy helping Dom was like a chicken with his head cut off. It worth the wait just to have Dom personally make the pizza. The pizza itself is absolutely amazing. I love Brooklyn style and this is the perfect Brooklyn pizza.

"Man, this place has all the ups and downs of a family business that's been around for a while.The ups have everything to do with having eaten one of the best pizzas I've ever eaten.The downs have everything to do with age and not wanting/needing to scale given what they can get away with charging (it really is that good, when it's good).The problem is...  even after the agonizingly long wait (ours was half an hour which is on the shorter side, actually), you still might not get a perfectly-executed pie.  My brother and I were lucky enough to get a GREAT one, and the restaurant benefited from us buying at least 6 sodas between the two of us over the course of ordering, waiting, and finally eating...  but there were plenty of other pies that were burnt to a crisp including one that filled the place with smoke.  In the end, best pizza gutbomb ever, every time, n% of the time.  Go get it while n is still high enough to keep the guy going, I guess.  I do say ""the guy"" because the place does seem like it's all the one older guy and his single oven, painstakingly poring over each pie while everyone else is simply there to do everything that isn't pizza-making for him.",4.0
"Nothing I could say here would contribute anything new. Essentially, I am here to fall heavily enough onto the review bell curve so as to eventually negate the reviews that have been less than 5 stars so Di Fara will hopefully read ""5 stars, 573 reviews"" instead of ""4.5 stars, 572 reviews.""I do not live in Brooklyn, I live five hours away in Brookline. But every time I step foot in Manhattan off the Bolt Bus, I save an afternoon and an evening for making this epic pilgrimage down to Q line onto Avenue J so I can get some of Domenico the Pizza Wizard's sorcery into my stomach.I can't resist making a completely unimaginative and disrespectful comparison like making the Hajj to Mecca. This is a journey you must plan for: it costs you a large chunk of time and a large chunk of money, and to have that stand as the basis for your review calling this place less than stellar is to functionally misunderstand the concept. It's written all over the walls in the write-ups from NYC magazines over the past several decades, the guys who work for Dom explain this to you, the horde of people suffocating the small size of this place indicate it to you... what more explanation do you want? You're going to pay a lot of money for a pizza and it's going to take a long, long time... but good lord is it worth it.I accept that it is a valid criticism too say that Domenico goes too heavy on the olive oil, underneath the pizza, throughout the pizza, and on top of the pizza. But it's part-and-parcel with the overall heavy pizza he constructs in general.The herbs he grows on the windowsill of the business that he then coarsely chops with scissors all over your pizza... oh man is that good, and essential to the flavor of each pizza.The fact that the ingredients are sort of scattered variously around the surface area of your pie leads to an interesting variation of the flavor from slice to slice... this piece has more pepperoni, this piece is all pizza and no toppings, this piece is herb city. Honestly, I don't think that's naive; it's exciting. This is what it is to have something prepared gourmet by an artisan. This what what that means, in the dictionary and stuff. This is one product, mass produced by one guy, who needs to take a break in the middle of the day, and has the right to do it whenever he wants for as long as he wants. His pizzas speak for themselves, and the demand will never decrease because he doesn't function on the same clock a business of more than one would.",5.0

"I finally had the opportunity to taste the savory slice of Di Fara.  My bf and I decided to have pizza for lunch and since I've never tried Di Fara before he suggested we go there.  Just walking towards the corner where the pizzeria sits, you would never notice it was open for business.  It's really dark inside, so you can't see the crowd of people waiting until you walk right up to the doorway and say to yourself ""holy cow!""  We walked in confused.  We couldn't figure out where we should order, so we started to ask random people if they knew where the line was.  Funny as it may seem, but they didn't know either and yet they had ordered their pizza already.  We made our way to the counter and ordered 2 slices.  There was no way of knowing who came first, so you just need to stick by the counter and plant your feet there hoping the girl taking the orders remembers you walked in before the others.Di Fara really would not be so packed if it wasn't for a one man show.  It takes Dom literally 15mins to prepare a pie to be placed in the oven.  The poor man is so old now that he works like a turtle.  He does have a younger man in the back preparing the dough and that in itself takes  the same amount of time as preparing a pie.I can't say that it was totally worth the 45mins wait for a $5 slice, but I do give them the credit of using fresh ingredients and Dom making every single pie in this establishment all by himself.  If you're looking to enjoy a slice of pizza on the go... don't go!  If you're looking to try the infamous Di Fara's pizza, I suggest getting a pie - it's a lot cheaper (not including any toppings).",4.0
"I had only one meal (lunch) to have while visiting from SF and this is where we decided to go because we were in a mood for pizza. Was it worth the drive and $10 toll to drive back to Staten Island that took us 1.5 hours and was almost late for a friend's wedding? Well... no, not really, but I am glad that we tried it. Would I go back anytime soon? Probably not, although we did enjoy the pizza quite a bit. We got there at noon, but the line was still short. we waited about 45 min. or so for the food. Somebody posted about concerns with health code violation, but I did not find the place to be unclean (but then I am a frequent Tenderloin eater, so my standard is pretty low).",4.0

We arrived at 630 and were out by 830. A guy drove from Detroit to try Doms pizza. My only complaint is the wait, it could be run way more efficiently but the guy helping Dom was like a chicken with his head cut off. It worth the wait just to have Dom personally make the pizza. The pizza itself is absolutely amazing. I love Brooklyn style and this is the perfect Brooklyn pizza. Four cheeses grated while make each pizza, handmade sauce made in small sauce pans in the back, fresh basil grown in the window, and olive oil, lots of olive oil!

"I have no problems accepting that their pizza is very good (which is what saved this from the lowest rank), though I didn't get to have any of it. However, I have a big problem with the guy who took my order. He mis-represented big time. As I stood by the counter to place my order, I asked whether a pie would be quicker, or a few slices. He said that, if I wanted more than a couple of slices, the pie would be quicker. I asked him how long, and he said, "" about 40 min"". I was ok with that wait, on a Saturday afternoon at 2:25, and placed the order and paid in advance.Long story short, we waited for an hour and ten minutes, the line for slices moved much faster, and we had still not received our order. In fact, by now we had figured out his process of tracking / placing orders, and there was no way we were going to get this in the next hour. I asked him again how long, and he again said ""40 min or so"", when we had already been waiting for 70 min! Why not announce this 2 hour wait the first time around? Now, I don't have a problem with a $40 pizza, because it is listed on the menu. I do have a problem with someone who says the wait is 40 min, when he definitely knew that my wait was likely to be two hours or longer. I had paid in advance, so I asked for my money back, which he reluctantly gave me. It was a waste of a precious Saturday afternoon, since I made the trek from midtown. But, I am glad I saved that extra hour. I may have missed a few slices of good pizza, but after how this guy lied to me, I would not have enjoyed it.

By the time you carry it to your table the fresh parmesan cheese will have melted.The pizza was absolutely delicious. And be warned by other reviewers and myself, the pizza is very greasy/oily. I am the type that usually does dab the pizza with a few napkins to get the extra grease off, but I just couldn't do it here. I wanted to taste all the flavors and I didn't regret my decision at all.

"Di Fara's: I love, I love, I love.It inspires me to new heights of craziness in my food eating adventures. I've been going on and off since 2003, my first time as a wide eyed, gawking tourist from Canada. I brought my boyfriend, he sat and waited at a table doing a slow burn while I held our place in line all the while soaking in the theatrics of a true pizzaiolo. Since that virgin visit, I've returned a couple of times each year, enough to have the Q train schedule burned into my memory. Enough to endure hour long subway rides back and forth. Enough to know that I should bring a Tolstoy tome to pass the time between commute and pizza making. A couple of years ago I ventured out and I made the sore mistake of not calling beforehand so I braved freezing temperatures and a windy snow storm only to arrive at a closed storefront. Arrgghh! So I was on a Di Fara's hiatus for the last two years. Enough with the erratic hours and the gong-show waits I thought, time to move on. Although I could never help but wonder when I would make my next return to my own personal pizza mecca. I went back this past week seizing the great snowstorm of February as a capital pizza eating opportunity. And yes I called beforehand. The place is as charmingly worn down as it was before with a fresh lick of green paint inside. And Dom, the septuagenarian pizza maestro is still sporting the same worn plaid shirt and cap, churning out pies effortlessly.  Maggie -his wry daughter mans the counter and tries to keep the crowds in check with her expediting. I had a 20 minute wait for a pie this visit but other visits I've waited upwards of an hour and half to two hours. So yeah, don't go on the weekends or prime dinnertime. It's a zoo and it requires all the patience and zen of a Jedi master to endure the madness. Like Luke you'll find yourself tempted by the dark side when others (most likely the uninitiated or uncouth) cut in front or steal a pizza out of turn only to have your eyes cut into their backs like daggers. But the pizza here is first rate in my books. Yes, it's not true authentic Neapolitan style neither pliable or fluffy soft in its dough. Tender, chewy crisp is more appropriate. The thin crust barely strong enough to support the dynamite melange of cheese on top. Added extra virgin olive oil almost gilds the lily, a dangerous pool of cheese and oil. If Dom is extra generous with the oil, the dough groans to support the embarrassment of riches, like strippers at a frat boy party. Oil, cheese and more oil: sometimes you'll get a pie with a sheen not unlike a pimply teenager from Fat city. It's a flavorful greasy mess though not for everyone. The tomato sauce is suitably herbaceous and sweet and the dusting of grana padano on top lends a sweet nuttiness to the mozz below.  Finally, a sprinkle of the specially imported basil gives a nice verdant freshness to each pie, I couldn't imagine having a slice without some of that good stuff. So yes, lots of love for this pizza despite all the pains. I love, I love, I love.",5.0
"This is the best pizza I have had in Brooklyn. Well worth the trip out here. Yes, it is oily (they, and by they I mean the old fellow who runs the place, put extra olive oil on before tossing it in the oven) But each pie has about a pound of fresh grated mozzarella on it, a very nice sauce and when it comes out it gets some fresh grated parmesean and fresh basil. Looks like most of it is all imported from Italy. The crust was nice and crisp. The place does get packed but if you have the time its worth the wait. Its not cheap ($20 for a plain pie) and cash only. But, I still think its worth it.So much better than Grimaldi's has been recently.",5.0

"I like to think of myself as a pizza connoisseur, so it's almost criminal that I hadn't made it to Di Fara until today.  Since I went on a weekday at around 4pm, my experience was vastly different from those of other reviewers.  There was absolutely no line, and there were maybe 5 people in the shop.  I think this is how Mr. DeMarco envisioned it - it was really chill, I walked in, he asked me what I wanted, and I got the pizza.  He said ""Pay whenever you want"", so I sat down, ate some slices, drank some Pellegrino, relaxed, went back for seconds and thirds, and then I finished and paid.  He had a huge smile on his face the entire time - and it looked like 80% of the customers were regulars.  I'm sure this is when he thinks ""THIS is why I opened my pizza shop.""  Oh yes, the pizza!  It was AMAZING.  I tried both the ""reguler"" and the square, or Sicilian.  The reguler slice, piping hot out of the oven, was delicious.  The tomato sauce was tangy and flavorful, there was the right amount of cheese, and there was just the right amount of saltiness.  The crust was crispy, albeit a tad thin.  The square slice - now THAT's why you go to Di Fara.  The crust was crispy and yet chewy and tender in the middle.  And the tomato sauce and cheese combination was fantastic.  As stated before, Dom DeMarco is an artist.  I saw him bake an entire cheese pie, put it into a box, slice it, and then take a huge sprig of basil and cut pieces with a scissor to spread them out.  He then dribbled olive oil over - no wonder the wait can be long!  Is this the best in NYC?  For many, it is, though I've viscerally had more amazing pizza experiences at UPN (and Luzzo and Grimaldi's are close).  But definitely try to go during non-peak times - you will appreciate Di Fara all the more.",5.0
"The toughest thing about reviewing Di Fara's pizza is that it's not really pizza.  Not in any traditional sense, anyway.  Is it cheese and tomato sauce on oven-baked dough?  Of course.  But the comparisons stop there.  This is a bear of a slice.  It's more Kimbo than Mike Tyson: it's not a heavy weight champ and it's not the best, per se.  It's something else entirely that happens to qualify as pizza.  It delivers a blunt-force-trauma jungle of flavor that leaves you feeling like it judged you, not vise verse.I don't unequivocally recommend Di Fara for pizza lovers.  The next time I want pizza, I'll run to Luzzo's.  Di Fara stands a craving apart:  the next time I want food to dominate me, I'll hop on the Q.",4.0

It's a zoo and it requires all the patience and zen of a Jedi master to endure the madness. Like Luke you'll find yourself tempted by the dark side when others (most likely the uninitiated or uncouth) cut in front or steal a pizza out of turn only to have your eyes cut into their backs like daggers. But the pizza here is first rate in my books. Yes, it's not true authentic Neapolitan style neither pliable or fluffy soft in its dough. Tender, chewy crisp is more appropriate. The thin crust barely strong enough to support the dynamite melange of cheese on top. Added extra virgin olive oil almost gilds the lily, a dangerous pool of cheese and oil. If Dom is extra generous with the oil, the dough groans to support the embarrassment of riches, like strippers at a frat boy party. Oil, cheese and more oil: sometimes you'll get a pie with a sheen not unlike a pimply teenager from Fat city. It's a flavorful greasy mess though not for everyone. The tomato sauce is suitably herbaceous and sweet and the dusting of grana padano on top lends a sweet nuttiness to the mozz below.  Finally, a sprinkle of the specially imported basil gives a nice verdant freshness to each pie, I couldn't imagine having a slice without some of that good stuff. So yes, lots of love for this pizza despite all the pains. I love, I love, I love.",5.0
"This is the best pizza I have had in Brooklyn. Well worth the trip out here. Yes, it is oily (they, and by they I mean the old fellow who runs the place, put extra olive oil on before tossing it in the oven) But each pie has about a pound of fresh grated mozzarella on it, a very nice sauce and when it comes out it gets some fresh grated parmesean and fresh basil. Looks like most of it is all imported from Italy. The crust was nice and crisp. The place does get packed but if you have the time its worth the wait. Its not cheap ($20 for a plain pie) and cash only. But, I still think its worth it.So much better than Grimaldi's has been recently.",5.0
Over priced slice of pizza here... I had better pizza in new jersey,2.0
"I love Dom.   I argue all the time about the best pizza in NY, and I always push Dom's as the best.   It's almost a shame he got so popular - I only eat here a few times a year now - whereas I was a once a week customer.  The wait , ""while worth it"", really puts some drag on the experience.  Oh and please understand that ""your pizza is next"" is italian for one day you will get a pizza.   If you arent willing to wait for your pie - don't go - you will just get disappointed.  Otherwise, happily wait for your reward will be forthcoming.I doubt Dom has time anymore, but its not just his Pizza's (round cheese pie is hands down the best) - i would have some off menu stew in the winter that knocked my socks off, and his pasta's were always on the money too.",5.0
"I like to think of myself as a pizza connoisseur, so it's almost criminal that I hadn't made it to Di Fara until today.  Since I went on a weekday at around 4pm, my experience was vastly different from those of other reviewers.  There was absolutely no line, and there were maybe 5 people in the shop.  I think this is how Mr. DeMarco envisioned it - it was really chill, I walked in, he asked me what I wanted, and I got the pizza.  He said ""Pay whenever you want"", so I sat down, ate some slices, drank some Pellegrino, relaxed, went back for seconds and thirds, and then I finished and paid.  He had a huge smile on his face the entire time - and it looked like 80% of the customers were regulars.  I'm sure this is when he thinks ""THIS is why I opened my pizza shop.""  Oh yes, the pizza!  It was AMAZING.  I tried both the ""reguler"" and the square, or Sicilian.  The reguler slice, piping hot out of the oven, was delicious.  The tomato sauce was tangy and flavorful, there was the right amount of cheese, and there was just the right amount of saltiness.  The crust was crispy, albeit a tad thin.  The square slice - now THAT's why you go to Di Fara.  The crust was crispy and yet chewy and tender in the middle.  And the tomato sauce and cheese combination was fantastic.  As stated before, Dom DeMarco is an artist.  I saw him bake an entire cheese pie, put it into a box, slice it, and then take a huge sprig of basil and cut pieces with a scissor to spread them out.  He then dribbled olive oil over - no wonder the wait can be long!  Is this the best in NYC?  For many, it is, though I've viscerally had more amazing pizza experiences at UPN (and Luzzo and Grimaldi's are close).  But definitely try to go during non-peak times - you will appreciate Di Fara all the more.",5.0
"The toughest thing about reviewing Di Fara's pizza is that it's not really pizza.  Not in any traditional sense, anyway.  Is it cheese and tomato sauce on oven-baked dough?  Of course.  But the comparisons stop there.  This is a bear of a slice.  It's more Kimbo than Mike Tyson: it's not a heavy weight champ and it's not the best, per se.  It's something else entirely that happens to qualify as pizza.  It delivers a blunt-force-trauma jungle of flavor that leaves you feeling like it judged you, not vise verse.I don't unequivocally recommend Di Fara for pizza lovers.  The next time I want pizza, I'll run to Luzzo's.  Di Fara stands a craving apart:  the next time I want food to dominate me, I'll hop on the Q.",4.0
"Being a professional cook I'm always on the look out for great place to grab a descent bite to eat and liven my palette. After hearing all the hype for years i was finally convinced to go and grab a pie. What a waste of time, Grano Padano cheese? Why? For 25 bucks a pie you better use parmaggiano  di parma. Colavita Olive oil really? Why not use imported olive oil from sicilia or turino or an artisan grower? Maybe Americans don't know any better but please  have some respect for your fellow country men, and your profession. Sellouts!",1.0
"If you cannot stand the wait you're an impatient fool!Read a book!The entire time you wait you'll be warm and wrapped in the delicious scent of freshly baked Italian goods.

For those who cried out for it's lack of sanitation--get over it! Walk away if you have such a problem with it. Anyway, the fact of the matter is that it's the best damn pizza out there. Dom is a genius and that's all there is to it.",5.0
"I mean. Its worth the trip to see an adorable older man devoted to his craft. And what a great craft it is: pizza.Now, let me be very unpopular. I ordered a circular pizza with olives and mushrooms. The ingredients were VERY fresh tasting. VERY tasty cheese, sauce, veggies and bread/crust.But, it kinda was falling apart all over the place. Now maybe I shoulda let it sit for longer or maybe I should have ordered plain cheese, but either way, it was falling apart all over.So I dunno. Tasty ingredients, lovely man cooking them but...sorta loose pizza.Hey, I know, but I call it like I had it.",4.0
"Don't expect a light, simple pizza (""Neapolitan"").  Dom makes a spicy, thick, complex slice. It took me about half of a slice to even begin to make sense of what I was tasting.

That being said, this isn't really my type of pizza. But it IS a hellava(n) IMPRESSIVE pizza.

Would you have liked to have been in the same room with Michelangelo when he was creating David. You can get close when you watch Dominick DiFara create his pizza masterpieces.

Di fara excels, the pizza is light with good aromatics in the sauce and the level of cheese and olive oil on the pizza being just right. Very very good pizza, among the best i've ever had. Worth the 45-60 minute wait, watching the old man at work is good compensation for your time.When was the last time you saw bobby flay cooking up a dish at Bar American or Wolfgang serve up something -personally- at one of his restaurants. You cannot but appreciate the effort of this person to stay true to his craft. Dont get me wrong i am not trying to trash all celebrity chefs and their offerings, but would urge you to pause for thought. On balance.. the place is really old and oozes character but i am not sure that these ovens can deliver a even pie. The pizza i was served was charred on one end and on the other end of the pie it could have been baked a little longer. The place is not organized and people dont get served in sequence. i would happily put up with this for their pizza.",4.0
"Great pizza, not worth the wait! Just a show for the out of towners!!! Who wants to wait for 1 hour 45 minutes on average!!  If you are hungry, avoid it!! If you want to wait and pay $50+ for 2 pies---- think twice!! We have great pizza all over NY--- why? Its become a show",5.0
Temporarily closed as of 1/30........Went for a slice for lunch and gate was down on the side of the restaurant.  Sign in the front said call Dom for updates with a number.  Could it be the health department is at it again? Did you run out of basil?  Dom with the $4 you charge for your your now famous slice you could afford to throw a little cash into the joint.,4.0
"Best pizza in NYC, hands down. After coming here, I can't go anywhere else. The wait is long but if you go at the right times, it's not bad...but even with a wait, it's worth it. A bit pricey but like I said, totally worth it. I heart DiFara's",5.0
"I often wonder if the experience - waiting on line in a tiny crowded pizza parlor, watching Mr. DeMarco cut up fresh basil and pouring olive oil on every steaming pie fresh out of the oven and knowing that we'll only experience such an event for a limited time (yes, it's an event)  - overshadows the actual taste of the pizza.  It would only add flavor, right?  I can't explain it but please go taste this magical metaphysical ingredient while you can.",4.0
"Hmmm, simple review since there are hundreds others here.regular slice (new york thin, triangle): 4 stars. excellent sauce, cheese, olive oil and fresh basil. very good crust (a little soggy at the end but otherwise still really good)square slice (Sicilian type, thick crust): 6 stars. same excellent sauce, cheese, olive oil and fresh basil as above. extraordinary crust, crispy on the bottom doughy in the middle, and perfectly complemented by the sauce and cheese on top. I always thought I was a new york thin crust lover, but this made me rethink my entire pizza-loving life.dom: 10 stars. This man knows what he is doing, is not going to be rushed by anyone, and understands that sometimes the process is more important than the outcome.if you love pizza, go. if you love tradition, go. if you love life, go.",5.0
"Believe the hype!  Dom DeMarco's pizza really is that good - and the lines really are that long.  Truth to tell, I've never had a wait of more than twenty minutes or so; I've come at off-hours and then stationed myself at the counter (as I'd been advised by cognocenti) so he wouldn't forget I was there.  Even with no lines, it's a deliberate process, as he approaches each pizza with total concentration, popping it back into the oven, seasoning with ev olive oil and fresh basil, giving it a sprinkling of parmesan.  I have had plain round pies, plain square pies, and pies with fresh artichokes and Italian eggplant.  All were amazing.  There's been a hullaballoo lately about DiFara raising its prices to $4 a slice.  Personally, if I'm making the trek to Midwood, I'm going to get a pie, but even if not, I don't think I'd begrudge them the money.  The pizza really is something special.As you have probably read, the space is nothing more than a dingy corner pizzeria in appearance (it was just another slice shop before Dom DeMarco started upgrading.)  You won't care once your pizza arrives!I've never minded waiting on line (in fact, I've always had interesting conversations - always at least one lamenting how the crowds have multiplied from the days when it was a secret), but sometimes the experience does make you feel like a creepy foodie, coming to marvel at some shrine, and gawking self-consciously at some master's artistry.  Seriously, a lot of your company will compound that feeling; at least half the reason I like to go on off-hours!But the pizza's the real deal, and it won't be around forever.  Get thee to Midwood!",5.0
"At a certain point, additional Yelp reviews become a waste of time. In the case of DiFara's, they have 591 reviews, and mine isn't going to tip the scales. But I thought I'd weigh in and see if I might be able to add a hint of moderation to the chorus of orgasmic praise that has been lavished upon this pizzeria.After reading all these reviews, a few friends and I decided to check it out for ourselves. First tip: Arrive early. We got to the restaurant at exactly 6 (when it reopens) and there was a sign saying that they would actually open at 7 that night. Since there was nothing else to do in that neighborhood, we just stood in line and waited. And it was a good thing we did that; by 7pm, there was a line of probably 40-50 people waiting for the opening.When the doors opened, one person went the counter to order while the others commandeered a table (there are only 5 tables, two of which can seat 3-4 people, and three that can seat 2 people). It was a bit of a cold night, so most of the unseated patrons decided to move inside to wait. This meant that we had dozens of people standing over our table. A bit suffocating, but not the end of the world. After placing the order, our pizza took about 20 minutes to be ready.Now, to the main event: the pizza. I must say, this is not the best pizza I've ever had. It was, however, the greasiest. Personally, I love it that way. Not all of my friends agreed, and a couple of them were mopping up the pools of orange grease before eating their slices. The tomato sauce was excellent, with some chunks of tomato and plenty of oregano. The cheese was also very good, a mix of a couple varieties. The crust was definitely burnt, which was disappointing, but didn't keep me from enjoying it. I especially liked the heap of basil.Tips: Show up 20 minutes before opening and you'll enjoy your experience much more. Bring your own drinks (they don't care) and save some money. Come with friends and split a whole pie to cut down on costs.Conclusion: I honestly have no idea why some people nearly climax when describing this pizza. It is a good slice of pizza. That's all. And when you consider the price ($5/slice, $25/plain pie), the location, and the atmosphere, I'm not sure you're getting your money's worth. I might go back if I happen to walk by and notice that there is no line. However, I doubt this will every happen because there's absolutely no reason for me to be in this neighborhood in the first place, and I'm sure it's almost always packed.",3.0

"We were lucky nough to find street parking but GOD DAMN... we had to run 3 more times to put coins in.... that's how long it took us to get our 2 special pizzas.So 4 of us enter this place mad hungry yo.... there are people everywhere, we see a desi dude in the line and ask him as to where is the line and if he is in it. He replies that he is only waiting for a slice ... so we nudge ahead and wait for the young lady for attention at the same time drooling over every pie that came out of the oven. I swear my cousin who came from india was ready to rip the head out of the next person who got his pie...we ordered two special pie's $55, one square and the other round... we got hold of a table and the wait started... while waiting we munched on a snack, took at least a hundred pics, ran 3 times to the car and got a million dirty looks. So 1st came the round pie, my cuz was so fuckin impatient cause he almost walked off with it without Dom cutting it into slices or putting his famous cheese and garnishment on top of it... and I swear I could sell each slice for double the money to all the hungry eyes waiting . anyways we all pounced on our quota of 2 slices each which were done in like 5 minutes...WHAT A TEASE !!!Now the wait was worse for the square pie... anyways another 10 minutes and here we go again.... round 2 .. we pounce on our quota again of 2 slices but only this time, I could not finish my 2ND one, there is definitely a big difference between the round and the sq. pie.. personally I liked the round pie but the overall vote was for the sq. pie 3-1.... Was it worth the wait... well I had awesome company... but the pizza was definitely awesome... so yes it was worth it...next time I might call it in....we got out drinks from outside as someone suggested....We didn't get to see Dom much as we were tryin to make sure we hold our table and there were at least 30 more folks in that small place..Good luck guys and if you find this review helpful please keep a slice aside for me....",5.0
"It is definitely worth coming here, as a very unique pizza eating experience. It is quite fascinating to watch the chef carefully hand make each pizza, taking immense pride in his work. With that said, the wait is outrageous and I would not recommend going when you do not have an hour or two to kill. Also, each pizza is made very slowly, so if there is a long wait it will take forever. There were 5-6 people ahead of me, and it took literally 1 hour to get 2 slices!The pizza is very good, though it is quite oily. I thought the square pizza was outstanding, whereas the regular round pizza was good, but not worth the wait. It is certainly a place to go at least once in your life, but go at an off time if you can, and go with friends to prevent boredom during the wait.",4.0

My friend introduced me to this place in college-how shocked I was to discover a non-Kosher pizzeria in Midwood-and I've never regretted it for a single day.",5.0
"I grew up in the neighborhood and still live there to this day.  I have been eating this pizza my entire life and it is hands down THE BEST!!!  You really appreciate the time and effort Dom puts into every single pie.  The pizza itself gets 5 stars, however, having to wait 45+ min is the reason for only 4 stars.  You may get lucky once in a while and get served quick, but dont get your hopes up.  Oh yea, slices are $5 and pies are $35",4.0
"I found this place by chance. I ended up on the corner to buy my fiancee a bicycle of off cl. When we walked off the train, we immediately saw the line at the door, waiting for the place to open. While waiting, I figured why not get a slice. We walked in and seen the $5 ticket. As we were walking out, I thought it just might be worth it. After all, there were tourist that were taking pictures of each other in front of the place where I least expected it. After a second look, I saw the guy had great ingredients so we took a chance. I am so glad that we did. The first pie came out and he cut fresh basil off the vine onto the pizza. I wait for about 20 minutes for a slice that was simply incredible. I can't wait to go back with a few friends for a pie and a video. Places like this are why I love Brooklyn.",5.0
worth the field trip. get there a few minutes before they open and be prepared to wait for a WHILE. we always bring cribbage and beer and sometimes even a snack! very fun vibe in this delicious little hole-in-the-wall!,4.0
"I haven't had a better slice. I went there on three separate occasions. Once I had to leave because the wait was too long and people began skipping and arguing. there was no way I was getting a pie, much less a slice.The second and third time I wised up and came right before opening. Got a pie quickly.Other than what the other reviewers already said, I can't say much more. My rating will have to speak for itself.",5.0
"If Yelp allowed 10 stars, this place would get it.  Every time I return to the East Coast I make a beeline straight to Dom to crowd around his counter for a pie.  After waiting for an hour for pizza, you can no longer get a slice --- you need a pie.  He puts some sort of magic on his pies.  His combination of cheeses, sauce, dough, and basil are amazing.  Toppings are unnecessary here.  Lately, however, his pies are are up and down.  They vacillate from slightly burnt to ""why is this pie black""?  Fortunately, I like my crust crunchy and charred so I do not mind at all.I was never a big fan of the Sicilian but Dom's version has turned me into a believer.  The perfect crunch on every slice.Another thing I wasn't a big fan of, in general --- Calzones!  Dom convinced my dad to try his calzones --- they are like crack.  Crack Calzones!  Every inch of the calzone was edible and delicious.And so what if the place is a little dirty or that Dom handles the money and kneeds his dough at the same time --- I think that it only adds to the orgasmic taste of his stuff.As another reviewer mentioned, you need to make sure that you're in Dom's line of vision at all times after you've placed your order.  If you leave the counter to sit in a chair, he will forget you.  He's a good pizza maker but doesn't have the greatest memory.Dom, may you live forever so I can bring my grandkids here one day.",5.0

"There has to be a reason why Di Fara's gets so much buzz, not just on Yelp, but everywhere else. I first heard about Di Fara's when it was spotlighted on net, for being the most expensive slice in NY. After reading/watching the article, I decide to make it a personal journey to visit this place at least once. And so I did, a few months back, and since those few months that past, I can still say that Di Fara's is it. It is the definitive best pizza in New York. Everything about this place shows tradition and culture. From the small pizza parlor to the ingredients use, it's just simply breath taking. Di Fara's uses the freshest ingredients I have ever tasted on a pizza. The crust is so crisp, but is not tough. The sauce is savory and sweet, but not excessively tangy our sour. The cheese, is warm, soft, and melts in your mouth. It's not hard, rubbery, or excessively thick and chewy. The sprinkle of olive oil helps to intensify and tie the flavors together. It's just a blend of pizza goodness in your mouth. The only downsides to Di Fara Pizza could be the pricing and the wait. But what can you expect? They justify the price because they import the ingredients. I completely agree with them. If you didn't care about the ingredients, then you wouldn't be here. You would be at another local joint, settling for mediocre pizza at 2.75 a pop. The pizza at Di Fara is worth the 5 dollar stipend. Am I telling you to visit this place daily?

"I have been blessed with having grown up in Midwood, just a few blocks down Avenue J from DiFara and the transformation that place has gone through over the years has been a fairy tale in its own right.When I was 14 and a freshman at Midwood HS (I'm class of 95, so you figure it out) I remember going to DiFara to get a regular slice for $1.25 and thinking it was kinda pricey. There was another ""Italian"" pizza joint just a block away, on J and E. 14th at the time. Di Fara wasn't much of anything back then. No amazing ingredients, no amazing people, just a regular corner pizzeria with good pizza. The major change happened about 10 years ago when Dom decided to try to add more homemade food onto the menu and decided to add a few touches like fresh Parmigiana Reggiano and baby artichokes. Along with that came the fresh Buffalo Mozzarella and baby mushrooms (whole at the time). Then he decided to roast fresh peppers before serving and then he went all out. Well... the people came from all over and the wait became 45-1 hour... for anything. But you know what? I don't care. Dom is still like a grandpa to me and I love him and I love his food (all of it, not just the pizza) and you know what? He loves his customers and that's what makes his food special. Update: No more calling in for your pizza. They don't pick up the phone (self-admittedly.)  It now takes about 2 hours to get a pie. The staff (family) now has overgrown egos and refuses to change the way they manage their business to fit their growing demand. It still makes the best pizza, but it simply isn't good enough to go to it anymore. I mean they don't even tell you what their hours will be. They now open when they want to, close when they want to and take hours long breaks in the middle of the day. All without notifying the customers.  It isn't a good place for kids because of the crowds and wait times. It isn't a good place for a romantic anything. It's only good for a tourist who wants to say, ""yeah, I ate there"" and the prices reflect that.If you've never had it and the trip isn't too far, go. It's a bucket list thing.

"I love the fact that Di Fara takes his time snipping basil with his scissors, shaving the cheese, and drizzling olive oil on each one as if he was making pizza for the first time.  The expression on his face when he looks in the oven to check on the pies reminds me of the one my Dad had when he would make us lunch.  He took more time to cook than my Mom, but things were always delicious.They take a while to take your order here, but Di Fara's daughter is very pleasant and there are plenty of neighborhood characters to entertain you.  But I also got a laugh watching the pained expressions of the Blackberried classes eager to just get their slice and check this place off their to do list.I was incredibly hungry myself, but a nice guy shared some zucchini flowers with me, which were quite tatsy and can tide you over while waiting for pizza.  As the wait went on, one regular joked about two pictures of Dominick Di Fara hanging on the wall, one of a younger Dom from the 50's, and another from the 80s.  ""That first one's of Dom when he opened the restaurant, and the other one is when he finished his first pie!""  Even Dom's daughter laughed heartily.  Minutes later a little girl from the neighborhood brought in a crayon drawing of dom holding a big wood peel pizza turner, and presented it to a smiling Dom.  I was glad I had the time to see it all.After an hour of ""theater"", my mushroom slice was ready and it was the most delicious slice I had ever eaten, until I started eating my plain cheese square, which had just a bit more of Di Fara's delicious cheese and sauce, and a bit more charred flavor from the oven.  I hope Di Fara passes on his skills, so this place will be here for years to come, but I suspect that even though he doesn't allow his kids to touch the pies, they have seen his painstaking process so many times that they could do it in their sleep. In fact I have no doubt that they have dreams of their Father making his pies.",5.0

One of the reasons i believe it tastes so good is that you have to wait approx 45min for your dish to arrive.

Don't go around dinner time and expect to get a pizza in any reasonable amount of time and, I'm not talking 30 minutes, I'm talking up to 2+ hours.

"The place looks nothing like somewhere you would go to eat, but if you can look past the horrible interior and the amount of time it takes to get your food (About 2 hours for a regular pie as the place is seemingly always packed, but is worth it) it truly is the best pizza you will ever eat in your life.

"I went here a couple of years ago (it was rated #1 by Time Out).  The pizza was great, and I actually got to briefly speak with the head chef.  He's skilled and wise.  If you're in Brooklyn, be sure to stop by for a slice.  I needn't say more... the other 500+ reviews have spoken for me!",4.0
"I love the fact that Di Fara takes his time snipping basil with his scissors, shaving the cheese, and drizzling olive oil on each one as if he was making pizza for the first time.  The expression on his face when he looks in the oven to check on the pies reminds me of the one my Dad had when he would make us lunch.  He took more time to cook than my Mom, but things were always delicious.They take a while to take your order here, but Di Fara's daughter is very pleasant and there are plenty of neighborhood characters to entertain you.  But I also got a laugh watching the pained expressions of the Blackberried classes eager to just get their slice and check this place off their to do list.I was incredibly hungry myself, but a nice guy shared some zucchini flowers with me, which were quite tatsy and can tide you over while waiting for pizza.  As the wait went on, one regular joked about two pictures of Dominick Di Fara hanging on the wall, one of a younger Dom from the 50's, and another from the 80s.  ""That first one's of Dom when he opened the restaurant, and the other one is when he finished his first pie!""  Even Dom's daughter laughed heartily.  Minutes later a little girl from the neighborhood brought in a crayon drawing of dom holding a big wood peel pizza turner, and presented it to a smiling Dom.  I was glad I had the time to see it all.After an hour of ""theater"", my mushroom slice was ready and it was the most delicious slice I had ever eaten, until I started eating my plain cheese square, which had just a bit more of Di Fara's delicious cheese and sauce, and a bit more charred flavor from the oven.  I hope Di Fara passes on his skills, so this place will be here for years to come, but I suspect that even though he doesn't allow his kids to touch the pies, they have seen his painstaking process so many times that they could do it in their sleep. In fact I have no doubt that they have dreams of their Father making his pies.",5.0
"My sister took us here last year and ever since, I've been wanting to come back.     Last time we came there was quite a line to order and then a line to receive our order.This time we got there about 3pm and managed to get our pizza and finish eating by 4pm.   I think we've hit on the best time to come.  Mr. Demarco is consistent in his wonderful skills in pizza making.  He puts a lot of love and attention to his pizza.  The toppings are not heavy just accents the yummy thin pizza.   I managed to eat 3.5 slices of our diFara special pie....   It costs about $28.   So well worth the costs, the wait, and the flight to NYC... for a slice.",5.0

"This place is a little hole in the wall pizza joint. The pizza is good but nothing life changing. One of the reasons i believe it tastes so good is that you have to wait approx 45min for your dish to arrive. Also the cheese falls right off the slice when picked up, so its a good idea to let it cool a bit. With all that said I would go again just to try their other pies.",3.0
"Theres 1 guy who makes and has always made the pizza, hes very nice, old, and deserves respect.   You might have to wait 2 hours for a pizza... but as the saying goes ""rome wasnt built in a day""While waiting to try this place out my friend asks the locals in there ""hey, is this the best pizza in brookland""  they respond, with a stright face ""this it the best pizza in the world!""  - i agree, so far....I would recommend the regular slice.The hint of FRESH basil adds a nice lingering taste to the pizza.",5.0
I said it once. And I will say it again. BEST. PIZZA. EVER.  People complaining about the size of the place being small? I don't go there to inspect the place. I come for the pizza. Long lines? So what. I'll wait.$5.00 a slice? I'll pay it. You think it's too much? Go somewhere else.Greasy? Drench mine in extra olive oil.  Enough said.,5.0
"Fantastic pizza for sure, but you gotta be careful. Don't go around dinner time and expect to get a pizza in any reasonable amount of time and, I'm not talking 30 minutes, I'm talking up to 2+ hours. I think it's best to go at off hours when you've got a better chance of not waiting. Every pizza's a bit different, which is probably a good thing, so expect varying experiences. Ingredients are great. Crust is usually incredible. Can be a bit runny in the center when crust gets too thin. 4.5 stars.Don't miss your chance to try this place out though. It is one of a kind and Dominic isn't exactly a spring chicken!",5.0
"The place looks nothing like somewhere you would go to eat, but if you can look past the horrible interior and the amount of time it takes to get your food (About 2 hours for a regular pie as the place is seemingly always packed, but is worth it) it truly is the best pizza you will ever eat in your life. While I've tried the pizza with different toppings as well as the square pie, I still prefer the regular cheese pie with nothing on it to be the best they have here.

"I really tried to like Di Fara's. 1. Did I mind traveling from Bensonhurst to Midwood where parking and traffic was terrible? No.2. Did I mind the rude customer service? No. 3. Did I mind waiting over 40 minutes for my pie? No.4. Did I mind being skipped by 5 other customers who came after me? No.5. Did I mind that the pie was pretty burnt? No.6. Did I mind that the slices were so oily that it dripped oil all over? No.I read the Yelp reviews on Di Fara and I braced myself. I thought the pizza would make up for everything we went through to get a pie from Di Fara but I was very wrong. Maybe we went for pizza on his bad day? The pizza was super salty. So salty that it was inedible. After taking 3 bites from a slice of pizza, we didn't want to finish it. My opinion? Not worth $5 per slice. Not worth the hassle.",2.0
"Two-hour wait for a fragrant and crispy pizza that's dripping in olive oil.The wait is long.  Trust me.The line seemed to always end just outside the door when I was there so it's deceptively short with just about 10 people ahead of you but pizzas for those 10 people will take a good 2 hours.  If you want to avoid the wait, you might want to consider going there at odd hours, ie 2 hours before you think you'll be hungry and/or earlier in the day whereby the herbs (basil/oregano) that are snipped and sprinkled onto the pizza right at the end might be fresher too.There are a few tables inside for seating.  Ventilation is not good.  You're definitely going to smell like pizza for a while, especially considering the 2 hours of fumigation.Doesn't look like they accept credit cards.  They are closed on Mondays and they also say they close at 10pm.  The Q train is a nightmare but gets you right there and Di Fara's is very close to the Avenue J subway station.Dominco is a very nice, kindly man indeed and he definitely takes great pride in his pizza, which makes up most of the appeal of his pizza, for me.  The remaining appeal is the oregano he liberally sprinkles onto the pie at the end.He has hands of steel/wood, he uses those long-handled spatulas but very often you'll see him pick up a smoking hot pie with his bare hands from the oven.  I guess that's proof of a real master at work.You can certainly order single slices, the wait is still going to be just as long, depending on your luck as pies for individual slices are not made that often simply because most folks order a whole pie (1 pie for 2 will be plenty), and there's no such thing as ""efficiency"" here in terms of finding out too much in advance who in the line wants what.  You do not and cannot rush things here.You get to choose between a regular (round) pizza or a square (it's really rectangular) pizza, which is more expensive.  The regular pizza bases are made to order and sprinkled with 2 types of cheeses whereas the square pizza bases are pre-made with a layer of sauce and have fresh buffalo mozerella added on top in addition to the 2 other cheeses.You can also choose a variety of regular toppings such as sausage, mushrooms, pepperoni, onions etc or pay a little more for ""special"" toppings such as porcini mushrooms etc.  Note that the porcini mushrooms are simply marinated separately in a large glass jar and added directly to the pizza after it is cooked (ie not cooked with the pizza).  There's also a Di Fara's Special, it's a regular round pizza topped with sausage, peppers, mushrooms and sliced red onions.  The onions are added raw and cooked with the pizzas and they are unbelieveably sweet.The pie crust is very thin and quite crispy.  The square pizzas look like they have a slightly thicker crust.The sauce is delicious and made from plenty of crushed tomatoes and fresh basil.  Interestingly, it's also quite a watery sauce.  The square pizzas have an additional layer of special tomato sauce (hidden in the fridge under the counter in a separate container) added on top.Other than that, I think the pizzas here are drenched in way too much olive oil.  Domenico douses the pie liberally with olive oil while it gets assembled and then again after it comes out of the oven before serving it up.  Sometimes he gets a bit absent minded and will double annoint the already glistening pies.The pies are all finished with a handful of grated grana padano and freshly-snipped basil/oregano,I read about how he supposedly has his own herb garden with which he gets the basil for his pizzas but I didn't see any of that when I was there.  I did see a few pots of rosemary sitting by the window but the basil and oregano that he snips directly from a bunch in his hand and sprinkles onto the pizzas definitely came from a package.  The pizzas don't all get basil either, sometimes they'll get oregano, I guess depending on whatever Domenico feels is appropriate.  I love the oregano.There are a few people helping him out (bringing the ingredients, grinding the grano padano, making sure that there's enough flour and enough fresh dough, slicing up the pizzas and boxing them up etc) but Domenico is the only one that makes the pizza bases, sauces them, adds the fillings and decides when the pizzas are ready.  I cannot imagine how he has the stamina to do this 6 days a week from 11am till 10pm...just me waiting for 2 hours was enough to kill me...and he's suppose to be in his 70s?!!Domenico is a really nice man.  Again, that holds most of the appeal of this place for me.  He really cares that he has your order right.  He really cares that your pizza has everything that it should have.",3.0
"This place has some good pizza.  We ordered a thin round (the classic), which has 8 slices.  It was thin enough that my husband was able to finish 6 slices without much trouble, and I had two.  He says that it was the best pizza that he has had that he can remember.  And he loves his pizza.  For myself, while the pizza was really good, I think I would have enjoyed it much more had I ordered a slice of the square pizza.  The square (as I saw from the others around me) was much thicker, like a deep dish, with lots of cheese on it.  Make sure to order the square if you generally enjoy Chicago style or deep dish pizzas.  For those that like the thin crust and minimal cheese and crust pizzas, go with classic.One other thing that made the pizza less than ideal for me was that it was absolutely oozing in oil.  The man who makes the pizza (Di Marco, I think was his name) is the only one who makes them and one of his signature touches to the pizzas is to add a rather large drizzle of extra virgin olive oil over the entire pizza after it comes out of the oven.  The pizza came out seriously GLEAMING from the layer of oil on top of it.  Yuck.  I know, I know - it's a personal preference.  Some people LOVE that; others are not such fans.  I fall in the latter category.  I had to dab a whole lot of it off, and even still, the pizza was just way too oily for me.   Just an FYI to others like me who might want to be warned!  Otherwise, disregard and enjoy! :) Last note, but be prepared for a LONG WAIT.  Others here have commented about this, but when we arrived, there was just one guy that was taking orders and payment, and not in a very systematic manner.  It took us 10 minutes to even grab his attention to order and what was supposed to take 30 minutes (perhaps less, he said) for the pizza to be ready, ended up being more like 50 minutes.  I think it's just the nature of the place and how it's run, but in such a cramped, crowded space, it wasn't much fun.  Bottom line - good classic pizza with a great looking square pizza, but be mindful of the wait and oily goodness.",4.0

"I distinctly remember my first trip to Di Fara's, I had moved out to the Big Apple all the way from SoCal not too long ago and after getting used to my surroundings, I decided to explore the wonders the city had to offer. It was a hot afternoon and I was a little lost way out on the Q train all the way down to Avenue J in search of the fabled Di Fara Pizza, only to find this little humble joint right in front of me after I got off the train. I entered confusedly, a bit disappointment even; this didn't seem any different from all the other pizzerias I'd been to in NYC. The only indication of the fame I had heard of this unassuming abode was the history of awards and raving reviews hung sporadically over the walls. Admittedly, I was taken back by the prices on the menu, $5 for a base slice seemed a bit crazy, but I had already managed to come so far so might as well. It was small and cramped, I barely managed to get myself a little wobbly table in the corner as I waited for my slice. Boy, did I wait too. I watched as Mr. Domenico Demarco slowly make my special square slice topped with porcini mushrooms and each step he took to complete my meal made me all the more enthralled to dig right in. Finally, my slice was finished, I quickly picked it up from the counter and took a brief second to feast my eyes at the peculiar wonder before me. Never before had I seen such a deep slice sloppily oozing Parmesan cheese mixed laboriously with a thick saucing topped with fresh smelling basil and my wonderful porcini mushrooms. I could not hold back myself any longer from the hunger pains rising in my stomach, so I opened my mouth excitedly and bit in. From that moment on, my life had changed. I opened my eyes wide as the wondrous mix of flavors bathed my mouth in sheer savory. I could never go back to the ""dark ages"" when I could consider frozen pizza a delectable treat. This was the true pizza experience that all the fame around Di Fara's proclaimed loud and clear, it was all true, so very, very true! I will never forget that experience and despite since then I've come to eat there many, many times, that same heavenly taste remains ever stronger with each and every bite. This may not be your typical review, but that's because Di Fara's isn't quite your typical place and it cannot be described in a normal fashion by any means. Truthfully, it is small, cramped, messy, expensive, a bit out of the way, and owns to legendarily long waits! Yet, all that said and done, the place feels very homely, Mr. Demarco & Co. always greets me with a smile and are very willing to engage in friendly discussions when they can, it feels like a place where one can be taken back to a simpler time and simply enjoy some tantalizing pizza.

"Another vote for ""the world has gone mad.""Thus I take Yelp's raves with a grain of salt.In DiFara's case, they must have used a handful of salt. It's pretty salty and greasy. I don't know what is the big deal with all the hype. The pizza was badly burnt. Needing to scrape charcoal off the pizza is already not perfect. The ingredients used show the potential of the pizza to be as good as they say, but the end result wasn't.The pizza was soggy. I had to eat with utensils. I don't mind the wait, but I'd want something that at least lives up to 50% of the hype and justify the $5 price of a slice. The pizza at DiFara's is probably not what it used to be.*** Revision 12/9/2009I went back to Di Fara on a day that had no lines during lunch. Without the pressure of time to satisfy a line of eaters and without the summer heat, this time Dom pretty much got it right. No overly burnt crusts. Still, I almost had to ask for a fork because it was too oily to pick up. I think the pizza is still a bit too salty and too oily, but the sauce was delicious and full of flavor. The basil had better effect this time. The crust was decent, though slightly chewy. I also tried the Sicilian, which was heavy on the cheese. I liked the thick crunchy crust, but with so much cheese, I couldn't enjoy the sauce as much. Very oily.I'm glad I gave Di Fara another try. Still... $5/slice?*** Revisit 12/2/2010One year later, it is still $5/slice. I had another slice and it wasn't as good as I last remembered. The pizza wasn't crispy. The slice of pizza is very small. The sauce wasn't as flavorful. The end crust was crunchy but too burnt to eat -- and I love end crusts. Nothing stood out for me this time. Di Fara has been good 1 out of 4 times I've been here, and that's not a mark of consistency. The emperor's not wearing clothes, folks. If I want a slice, I know where to go: Joe's.*** Revision 3/4/2012If I want a slice, I'd go to Patsy's. Best pizza for the price. A lot more consistent than Joe's.",3.0

"Another vote for ""the world has gone mad.""Thus I take Yelp's raves with a grain of salt.In DiFara's case, they must have used a handful of salt. It's pretty salty and greasy. I don't know what is the big deal with all the hype. The pizza was badly burnt. Needing to scrape charcoal off the pizza is already not perfect. The ingredients used show the potential of the pizza to be as good as they say, but the end result wasn't.The pizza was soggy. I had to eat with utensils. I don't mind the wait, but I'd want something that at least lives up to 50% of the hype and justify the $5 price of a slice. The pizza at DiFara's is probably not what it used to be.*** Revision 12/9/2009I went back to Di Fara on a day that had no lines during lunch. Without the pressure of time to satisfy a line of eaters and without the summer heat, this time Dom pretty much got it right. No overly burnt crusts. Still, I almost had to ask for a fork because it was too oily to pick up. I think the pizza is still a bit too salty and too oily, but the sauce was delicious and full of flavor. The basil had better effect this time. The crust was decent, though slightly chewy. I also tried the Sicilian, which was heavy on the cheese. I liked the thick crunchy crust, but with so much cheese, I couldn't enjoy the sauce as much. Very oily.I'm glad I gave Di Fara another try. Still... $5/slice?*** Revisit 12/2/2010One year later, it is still $5/slice. I had another slice and it wasn't as good as I last remembered. The pizza wasn't crispy. The slice of pizza is very small. The sauce wasn't as flavorful. The end crust was crunchy but too burnt to eat -- and I love end crusts. Nothing stood out for me this time. Di Fara has been good 1 out of 4 times I've been here, and that's not a mark of consistency. The emperor's not wearing clothes, folks. If I want a slice, I know where to go: Joe's.*** Revision 3/4/2012If I want a slice, I'd go to Patsy's. Best pizza for the price. A lot more consistent than Joe's.",3.0
I don't care if you think this is good or bad pizza . I just wanted to get my five star review in. If you want to take advantage if this man and his life's work while it's still around more power to you. If you want to ignore all of the accolades and argue such and such is better pizza then be my guest. You are never going to take away from what is the best pizza in the word made lovingly by the best pizza maker in the world. Hope you go!,5.0

"The iconic DiFara pizza and pizzeria experience.

Nothing on display, actually there was no display.No pizza stands,no food, nobody placing orders, taking orders, or talking.All I could see was the slightly hunched over old gentleman with a white apron on with his back facing to me seemingly busy. Second thing I noticed, it smelled amazing, like freshly baked dough and herbs. Not sure if they had run out of pizza or if this place was even for real, until finally with bare hands a beautiful literally steaming hot pie was pulled out of the oven and sprinkled with freshly grated Parmesan and freshly picked basil leaves from the window sill.

If you aren't sure whether your favorite pizza is being made by Mario and Luigi or by Mike and Leeroy, or you just want experience something truly authentic... this is the place to go. Dom can be heard mumbling Italian to himself from time to time as grabs pies out of the 750 degree oven with his bare hands, having lost the capacity to feel heat after so many years of hard work in the kitchen. This is pizza.- The wait can be long. You'll walk in, see 20 people inside and think to yourself, ""Hey, this doesn't seem bad..."" but don't be fooled. Dom makes every single pie himself. Yes. Every one of them. So, while having only a couple dozen patrons ahead of you may not seem daunting, at approx 5 minutes a pie (crafting time), you're likely looking at a 1-1.5 hour wait.  - The SLICE: The Traditional ($20, $3 toppings) is a thin crust, crispy bottom (sorry to all the pizza folders out there) made from the best ingredients you can get. Apparently Dom gets the cheese shipped in from his hometown in Italy. Be warned though, the chef is a bit heavy handed with the Olive Oil. After the sauce and cheese have been put into place on the dough, Dom goes to work with the oil, liberally applying (borderline drenching) before the pie hits the oven. When the pie is done cooking Dom will famously add his finishing touch: a generous handful of basil cut with scissors over top of the pie, another handful of cheese tossed on... then again with the oil! This time an even bigger dose. 10-15 seconds of pouring oil on top of the cooked pizza. It's hard to say that anything Dom does is wrong, but it is just a little too much oil for me, and for the pie as well. It's otherwise sturdy, crispy crust is smothered and soggy towards the middle of the pie from so much oil. In the end, a little too much oil doesn't stand in the way of the most delicious piece of pizza you'll ever shovel down your throat after a 2 hour wait. And as a side note, as you watch Dom pull pizza after pizza out of the oven you may think to yourself ""Man, that kind of looks burnt..."" but don't worry. Every single finished pie looks burnt on one side, merely as a result of a uneven oven one would assume. But what appears to be burnt is actually perfectly cooked...it's something you truly need to eat for yourself to believe. PS- We ordered the Di Fara's Specialty last night (sausage, peppers, red onions, mushrooms) as they were out of pepperoni. Let me tell you... I have never had such perfectly cooked vegetables on a pizza. It was truly one of the best slices I have ever had.",5.0
"The best slice pizza I've had, or one of. Very simple process, dough, chunky tomato sauce, bufalo mozz, pecorino and olive oil. He bakes it then snips basil on top and a little extra romano. Crust layer (not the entire crust) is a little harder than other NY pizzerias like Lombardi or Grimaldi, not as salty. The cheese is what makes this pizza stand above the rest. Just amazing.",5.0
"Me and John went here on his last day at Lutheran (woot!). So yea, as you all know, this is supposedly one the big pizza spots to go to... supposedly. It seemed like it was a lot of hype to me. I will say this: the sauce is the BEST I have ever had on any pizza. It has a nice kick to it, I don't really know how to describe it, but once you taste it, you'll be hooked. This place takes forever. Not a good thing for your typical on-the-go New Yorker. People were waiting more than 15 minutes just for a slice. I know it's cool to have that old guy hand make all your pizzas, but he looks like he's about to fall over, the guy seems so tired. I guess that's why the hours are so weird. He probably has a nap every afternoon or something. It's long past due that he passed the torch. We ordered the square ""special""' (Sausage, peppers, mushroom, onions). It took literally 45 minutes till our pizza was ready. The old man puts fresh parmesan and basil on the pies, which is a nice touch. The oil that he sprinkles under the crust is not a good thing. The pie gets pretty soggy, pretty quick. We ate there, but if you had to commute home and then eat it, it would probably be a soggy mess. Not good eats! The crust seemed pretty dense, just much different from the rest of the ""Best"" pizza spots. The toppings were not symmetrically placed, some slices were pretty empty, some had too much toppings. I felt that the pizza was average at best, definitely not mind-blowing. The ""regular"" pizza looked like I would have enjoyed it a lot more (it's the regular thin crust). Maybe we messed up by getting the ""Square"" pizza, ironic since it costs $5 more. But yea, after the long wait for the expensive ass pizza, I won't be going back, so I'll never know.I don't normally take price into account, but if I did, I would take away another star. $5 a slice is pretty extreme, and the wait is ridiculous. Unjustified in my opinion.",3.0

So, while having only a couple dozen patrons ahead of you may not seem daunting, at approx 5 minutes a pie (crafting time), you're likely looking at a 1-1.5 hour wait.  - The SLICE: The Traditional ($20, $3 toppings) is a thin crust, crispy bottom (sorry to all the pizza folders out there) made from the best ingredients you can get. Apparently Dom gets the cheese shipped in from his hometown in Italy. Be warned though, the chef is a bit heavy handed with the Olive Oil. After the sauce and cheese have been put into place on the dough, Dom goes to work with the oil, liberally applying (borderline drenching) before the pie hits the oven. When the pie is done cooking Dom will famously add his finishing touch: a generous handful of basil cut with scissors over top of the pie, another handful of cheese tossed on... then again with the oil! This time an even bigger dose. 10-15 seconds of pouring oil on top of the cooked pizza. It's hard to say that anything Dom does is wrong, but it is just a little too much oil for me, and for the pie as well. It's otherwise sturdy, crispy crust is smothered and soggy towards the middle of the pie from so much oil. In the end, a little too much oil doesn't stand in the way of the most delicious piece of pizza you'll ever shovel down your throat after a 2 hour wait. And as a side note, as you watch Dom pull pizza after pizza out of the oven you may think to yourself ""Man, that kind of looks burnt..."" but don't worry. Every single finished pie looks burnt on one side, merely as a result of a uneven oven one would assume. But what appears to be burnt is actually perfectly cooked...it's something you truly need to eat for yourself to believe. PS- We ordered the Di Fara's Specialty last night (sausage, peppers, red onions, mushrooms) as they were out of pepperoni. Let me tell you... I have never had such perfectly cooked vegetables on a pizza. It was truly one of the best slices I have ever had.",5.0
"The best slice pizza I've had, or one of. Very simple process, dough, chunky tomato sauce, bufalo mozz, pecorino and olive oil. He bakes it then snips basil on top and a little extra romano. Crust layer (not the entire crust) is a little harder than other NY pizzerias like Lombardi or Grimaldi, not as salty. The cheese is what makes this pizza stand above the rest. Just amazing.",5.0
"Me and John went here on his last day at Lutheran (woot!). So yea, as you all know, this is supposedly one the big pizza spots to go to... supposedly. It seemed like it was a lot of hype to me. I will say this: the sauce is the BEST I have ever had on any pizza. It has a nice kick to it, I don't really know how to describe it, but once you taste it, you'll be hooked. This place takes forever. Not a good thing for your typical on-the-go New Yorker. People were waiting more than 15 minutes just for a slice. I know it's cool to have that old guy hand make all your pizzas, but he looks like he's about to fall over, the guy seems so tired. I guess that's why the hours are so weird. He probably has a nap every afternoon or something. It's long past due that he passed the torch. We ordered the square ""special""' (Sausage, peppers, mushroom, onions). It took literally 45 minutes till our pizza was ready. The old man puts fresh parmesan and basil on the pies, which is a nice touch. The oil that he sprinkles under the crust is not a good thing. The pie gets pretty soggy, pretty quick. We ate there, but if you had to commute home and then eat it, it would probably be a soggy mess. Not good eats! The crust seemed pretty dense, just much different from the rest of the ""Best"" pizza spots. The toppings were not symmetrically placed, some slices were pretty empty, some had too much toppings. I felt that the pizza was average at best, definitely not mind-blowing. The ""regular"" pizza looked like I would have enjoyed it a lot more (it's the regular thin crust). Maybe we messed up by getting the ""Square"" pizza, ironic since it costs $5 more. But yea, after the long wait for the expensive ass pizza, I won't be going back, so I'll never know.I don't normally take price into account, but if I did, I would take away another star. $5 a slice is pretty extreme, and the wait is ridiculous. Unjustified in my opinion.",3.0

"If you listen to food critics like Zagat, they frequently say DiFara is the best pizza in the city. If you listen to the hype of foodies who've made the trek to Midwood, Brooklyn, you'll hear the same thing. Can so many people be wrong?  In a word, no. But I don't defer to others' opinions on why this pizza is the best or how long people traveled to get there. I base my humble opinion on my taste only and the hundreds of places I've sated my addiction to this simple yet complex food, pizza. Piece for piece, pound for pound or what have you, Dom DeMarco's oblong magnum opus is simply the best and well worth the trip.I grew up not far from this place's location so I was well acquainted with DiFara's product long before the din of ooohs and ahhhs brought in the barbarian hordes. My brother found this place which looks like a typical old school pizzeria, maybe worse on first glance. In fact, I might not even have gone in initially had I not been told to ignore the outer (and maybe the inner) appearance. Disregard the looks of the place as it's merely a mirage, I assure you Nirvana lies therein.I'll start with the biggest bitch most people have about DiFara's, the God damned bullshit wait one must have to endure to get a slice of pizza. Actually getting a slice might be easier, I usually order a whole pie which is often much more time consuming. For those of you not yet schooled in Dom's place, the pizza is made by one man who is, at best, slow and steady. I have often waited well in excess of an hour and a half to get a pie. Why in the mecca of pizza, Brooklyn, would I subject myself to this type of torture? Why it's the pizza and it's worth the wait. My Father said it years ago, you've got to go there when you're full just so you'll be hungry by the time you eat. One suggestion, if you're starving or don't have an hour to an hour and a half to kill, don't bother. Maybe you'll get lucky and there will be an ebb and flow of customers but play the odds and prepare for a lengthy wait.Dom used to serve lunches and dinners with 1 or 2 of his 7 children working the back kitchen. Although pizza is Dom's forte', his dinners were similarly good and worth checking out. He used to make a large dinner type salad with Italian antipasto type meats and cheeses, also worth checking out. Dom also used to make rustic Italian peasant food like stewed rabbit, if the meat was fresh. He buys all his meats fresh daily so if he's serving it, it's good to go. Getting a dinner also used to be a great wait to short curcuit the long wait for pizza.Why is DiFara's pizza the best? Initially it's the ingredients. Dom uses only the best imported ingredients including extra virgin olive oil (which is draped over the steaming pie when it exits the oven). Dom also uses buffalo mozzerella which is imported from Italy at great cost. You can see the styrofoam packing crates nearby so it's no joke, this stuff comes in from JFK directly from Italia. This stuff along with domestic fresh mozzerella is combined to create a wonderful creamy crown to the pizza.Dom also uses imported Grana Padano cheese in lieu of the more commonly seen Parmagiano Reggiano, which he grinds and sprinkles over the top of the bubbling pie when it's removed from the oven. The sauce is homemade, of course, there's no bulk made crap here. It's made daily (or semi daily) from imported San Marzano tomatoes, grown in the soil surrounding Mt. Vesuvius. The sauce has a rich sweetness which isn't found in other sauces using other types of tomatoes.  All these ingredients are high in cost individually which is why a slice of Dom's pizza is $4. This cost is passed onto the consumer but if you're a pizza afficianado like I am, you'll find it worth it. There's plenty of slice shops in NY but they don't taste like this.  As far as what to order, Dom has a lot of specialty toppings which all sound great. And they are great as I've tried most of them but it's just that this product doesn't need any accouterments. It's that good au natural. Additionally, the Neopolitan slice is far too thin to support much weight so order with this in mind. There's also a large calzone that can come with imported proscuitto which ruins about $20-$22. A few guys can gorge off this, it's pretty large. The cheese is wonderfully rich and runny, not the gloppy and clumpy mess that you'll find in most pizza place calzones. This stuff is fresh as fresh can be. Dom also snips fresh basil onto his hot pies which got him in trouble with the Dept. of Health but it SO adds to the taste.In addition to growing up on Brooklyn pizza, I've tried nearly all of the ""best"" pizzas in NY so my opinion of this place is based on a lot of trial and error. Suffice it to say, if you're looking for cheap eats or a quick pizza fix, go elsewhere. But if you want some of the best pizza you'll ever have AND have time to kill, venture off to Avenue J in Brooklyn and bite the bullet. I think you'll be happy you did",5.0
"There are plenty of reviews that have been written canonizing this pizza.  And a few that provide the inevitable backlash/contrarian view to combat all the hype.  This review aims to use the elements of the Di Fara experience as ingredients towards a larger contemplation of man's quest for perfection - consider it an homage to Dom's attempt to honor his fantastic ingredients via his pizza-making.....except with infinitely more pretentiousness (extra cheese?) and infinitely less virtuosity (canned sauce).""What is the price of perfection?"" I ponder during my long wait for receiving one man's (a spry, near septuagenarian Dom Demarco) attempt at creating perfection within an edible 15 inch circle of tomato, cheese(s), and dough.  Now this isn't my initial thought, mind you.  I entered with my heart a-thumpin' as I finally found myself at the oft-proclaimed best pizzeria  in New York.  My initial thoughts vacillate between: 1) an internal loop of ""I'm gonna have Di Fara pizza"" that resembles both Eddie Murphy's old ""I have some ice cream"" stand-up bit and commercial pleadings of cartoon dogs for Snausages and Kibbles & Bits2) concern over whether the wait will drive the rest of my family crazy (My cousin had a party about 2 miles away and, after hearing how excited I was about the pizza, my mom, dad, 2 sisters, and sister's fiancee decide to join me in the experience).These pragmatic concerns are taken care of by the key decision (after 30 minutes of waiting) to take 6 slices (1 for each of us) in lieu of our first pie (I had ordered a 2nd pie to go).  The slice was great but too complex to make any grand assessment of it.  I'm left longing for another slice as I bid adieu to my family who head back to the land of malls and hair spray (NJ).As I wait for my pie to go, I start to take in my surroundings. There's nothing fancy or romantic about the place - the only thing distinguishing it vs other northeastern pizza joints are the various framed articles touting Di Fara.  (Not that other pizza places don't toot their own horn - if I had a nickel for every pizza box I've seen with the 'You've tried the rest.  Now try the best' line.  At least Di Fara employs third-party assessments...).  But this place is different in two key ways:1) There isn't a dough-slinger or chef behind the counter - there's an artisan.  You can tell it in the way Dom grates the buffalo mozzarella onto each pie (vs. having the bucket of grated mozzarella cheese to sprinkle on).  Or the way he chops basil and grates another type of cheese (grana padana) to top off the finished pie as classical music plays in the background.                2) There isn't a line of customers waiting for a pie or some slices.  There is chaos. Perhaps due to naivete, I pictured the wait for a Di Fara pie to be a communal experience.  People bonded together for one common objective --- sharing a mutual respect...yadda yadda yadda.  But I'm not seeing a lot of that.  Whatever positive motivations everyone brought to the pizzeria have all but disappeared thanks to the long wait and the infuriating lack of an equitable ordering system. And it's this yin/yang battle separated by a pizza counter that gets me thinking about the price of perfection.  Watching Dom apply his craft is a treat and I can only hope he finds inner peace and tranquility in it.  But the desperation, conflict, and opportunism (people try and often succeed at getting their pie before others) on the other side of the counter feel like a microcosm of other quests for perfection.  Blood diamonds (perfect jewel).  Ethnic cleansing (perfect race), Enron (perfect scam). Steroids (perfect male body).  Eating disorders (perfect female body), The unnecessary zaniness that Balky inflicted on Cousin Larry (perfect strangers), etc.  Is the quest for perfection - even one much more noble than all the above examples - ever worth the cost?After probably 60 minutes of such philosophizing (on top of the earlier 30 minutes), I finally get my pie and can find out whether the pizza truly is worth it.  The first slice is fantastic.  The interplay of the two cheeses has such a sharp, rich taste to it.  The San Marzano tomatoes taste so rustic and earthy.  The basil complements both the cheese and tomatoes.  The crust has a great char to it.  It's like no slice I've had before.  Another slice confirms the assessment --- this could very well be the best pizza I've ever had.But I'm still not totally satisfied.  I don't know if it was the hype, the wait, self-inflicted nihilism or a bit of all three but this odyssey didn't end up being about a search for the best pizza --- it became about a search for the perfect pizza.  And perfection is too much to ask of anyone - even Dom.",5.0

"If I had to rate the pizza alone, that would be 4-5 stars. However, the process of getting the pizza, and, quite frankly the conditions the pizza is made in, take it down a notch.

It can be very irritating so prepare yourself for this.

"Myself and two of my friends just got back from Di Fara. And it was well worth the trek to Avenue J in Brooklyn to do so. Acknowledging that there would be a considerable wait, we set off from Manhattan around 5:00 and arrived outside Di Fara around 5:45 or so, before they opened for the 6-9pm dinner shift. We walked around the block and came back to a short line which formed outside the restaurant before it opened. It took about 10 minutes, then we got our order for a sausage and pepperoni square pie in. I picked up a Pepsi from the refrigerator and paid for the pizza while my friends got one of the very few seats in the place. There really wasn't any ambiance whatsoever and the service was a bit convoluted, but we began eating somewhere around 6:40.The food was absolutely fantastic. Although the square pie wasn't like any conventional pizza I've had before, it was masterfully crafted. The crust was somewhat thick and a bit dense, and even though the outer edges of the crust were charred, all of the crust was scrumptious. The large chunks of fresh mozzarella(you can watch the guy drain the fluid from the mozzarella bag as he's making your pizza) complemented the crust very well with its stringiness and light taste. The sauce had a very smooth consistency and also tasted great. What really set this pizza apart in my opinion was the generous amounts of olive oil and fresh basil which topped it off -- these made the pizza especially delicious. Also, as a bunch of college students, my friends and I were worried that the rather small-looking square pizza we had just paid $36 for wouldn't be enough to fill us up. On this point, we were most definitely mistaken -- I couldn't even eat my third of the last slice in the box. Even though everything here seems expensive, you get a lot of food for the price.As for whether or not it's better than Grimaldi's, I honestly can't say. It seems like a cop-out, but the circular pizzas at Grimaldi's and the square pizzas at Di Fara are just different enough that it becomes like a comparison between tuna tartar and beef carpaccio -- both somewhat similar in form, but different enough to make them beyond comparison. While the service and ambiance were lacking at best, the food here was good enough to get a five-star rating out of me.",5.0
"Hosannas have been showered upon this place, and there isn't much else to say. But as much as I love Di Fara, it isn't perfect. I hate for my first Yelp review to be crotchety, but I will say, as a caveat, that (duh) the pizza is great.First of all, no pizza can be the best pizza in New York or the world, objectively. But no pizza can be in that upper echelon if it doesn't come from a wood-fired oven. Di Fara's does not have a wood-fired oven. Not many places in New York have one, so Di Fara's, then, is in that upper echelon of pizza places without wood-fired ovens. Persnickety, I know, but Franny's is a few stops away on the Q, and they have one. Then again, they don't have $3 slices. Different ballgame.Also, Dom DeMarco makes all regular (cheese and herb) pizzas, and  then reheats them with the toppings if you ask for them. That's fine for a one-man show -- and his care really shows in the regular slices -- but that means that if you want a pepperoni slice, for instance, he puts the pepperoni on the slice and heats it up again, making the crust too crackery for my taste.And that's a problem only because the crust on the regular slices is so amazing. The best part of a pizza, for me, is the crust, and Di Fara's is pretty near perfect. Dom's toppings are very good -- the cheese is just enough of two types of mozzarella, plus some parmesan (I think), topped with fresh herbs -- and the tomato sauce is great, but his crust is really the accomplishment. And (yes) it's some of the best crust in the city. If you want toppings, order a whole pie.Oh, and to those that say the wait is too long or it's too far away, deal with it. Go on off hours or the weekend. It's 40 feet from a subway stop. No place that serves amazing food that's this close to a major subway line (Q at Avenue J) is too far away from anywhere, as long as you live in the city. As much as it's unfortunate that there's no wood-fired oven, this place is excellent and it's about as accessible as you can expect. The pizza is worth it.",4.0

"I love DiFara's pizza, but I don't honestly see how anyone in their right mind is willing to suffer through a 2+ hour wait to get it.Here's the thing: the first time I went, the wait wasn't too bad.  It was a few years back, before all of the hype.  The slices I got were decent, not bad.  The plain slices were good, and the ""special"" slice with the broccoli rabe was excellent.  It was a bit of a trek, but I figured I'd be back - and it was a great stop-off on the way to the beach.  Ok, count me in.Fast forward a few years, to last year.  I've been going less and less each year, as its popularity goes up and the lines get longer and longer.  I order my pie and get it, and you know what?  It's good, but it's a little too salty, and sitting is impossible so we bring it back to my apartment to eat and by then it's a little cold, and this after we spent well over an hour waiting to order it, watching him make it, stressing over whether he'd remember our order or if that girl on the side was going to try to sneak in front of us or why the hell we were there... the pizza was still good, even if it was a little too salty and a little cold and I definitely loved eating it.  But you know, it's just not worth it any more.I'll let other people wax rhapsodic over how great Dom is - and they're right - and about how he grows his own basil in the window or how he prepares each pie with the utmost of care and everything is done by hand and whatever else.  It's all true.  The problem is that in the end, all you're getting is a great pie, and there's no question that there's a lot of value to a great pie, but I'd much rather wait 10 minutes to score a slice of ""the 2nd best in the world"" pizza rather than wait 2 hours for a slice of ""the best in the world"" pizza.  Dom has his bad days, and honestly, waiting in line to get the pizza is boring and frustrating and a little stressful and... well, look, if you want to wait in line, fine, but I'm avoiding it, and you would be wise to as well.(And hopefully, just hopefully, the hype will die down again and then I can go back to visiting good ol' Dom and his fantastic pies...  If you care, Yelpers, if you truly care - vote this mofo down so that those of us that really know and don't need to rely on the Yelp review can go in peace.  Do it for the children!)",1.0
"I've had an epiphany. I'm convinced that Dom DeMarco is not a man, he is a god. Well, he doesn't wear a white robe or have a fluffy white beard or float on clouds or anything that you'd normally consider to be godly, but he does preform miracles---edible miracles. And that's enough to make him a god, isn't it?The first bite of a pie from DiFara Pizzeria is a revelation that you've just had an epiphany; you've just seen a true master, THE god of all things pizza-y. Everyone that loves pizza should build churches, write a bible, and bow down and worship him. Its like you've just taken a peek into heaven, almost like when you were a kid and you found where your parents hid the christmas presents and realized there is no Santa, you'll see that there is no ""pizza"" other than his, its all a farce. You'll be floored. Hell, I was floored. I didn't want to stop chewing the first bite. By now everyone has covered how he does it. I mean, you'll see how he does it... about 30 times before you see how he does yours. But its worth it. Its a one-man show on the train to pizza-deliverance (deliverance in the going to heaven sense, bible stuff... all that jazz).This pizza will change your life.It changed mine.

"If you listen to food critics like Zagat, they frequently say DiFara is the best pizza in the city. If you listen to the hype of foodies who've made the trek to Midwood, Brooklyn, you'll hear the same thing. Can so many people be wrong?  In a word, no. But I don't defer to others' opinions on why this pizza is the best or how long people traveled to get there. I base my humble opinion on my taste only and the hundreds of places I've sated my addiction to this simple yet complex food, pizza. Piece for piece, pound for pound or what have you, Dom DeMarco's oblong magnum opus is simply the best and well worth the trip.I grew up not far from this place's location so I was well acquainted with DiFara's product long before the din of ooohs and ahhhs brought in the barbarian hordes. My brother found this place which looks like a typical old school pizzeria, maybe worse on first glance. In fact, I might not even have gone in initially had I not been told to ignore the outer (and maybe the inner) appearance. Disregard the looks of the place as it's merely a mirage, I assure you Nirvana lies therein.I'll start with the biggest bitch most people have about DiFara's, the God damned bullshit wait one must have to endure to get a slice of pizza. Actually getting a slice might be easier, I usually order a whole pie which is often much more time consuming. For those of you not yet schooled in Dom's place, the pizza is made by one man who is, at best, slow and steady. I have often waited well in excess of an hour and a half to get a pie. Why in the mecca of pizza, Brooklyn, would I subject myself to this type of torture? Why it's the pizza and it's worth the wait. My Father said it years ago, you've got to go there when you're full just so you'll be hungry by the time you eat. One suggestion, if you're starving or don't have an hour to an hour and a half to kill, don't bother. Maybe you'll get lucky and there will be an ebb and flow of customers but play the odds and prepare for a lengthy wait.Dom used to serve lunches and dinners with 1 or 2 of his 7 children working the back kitchen. Although pizza is Dom's forte', his dinners were similarly good and worth checking out. He used to make a large dinner type salad with Italian antipasto type meats and cheeses, also worth checking out. Dom also used to make rustic Italian peasant food like stewed rabbit, if the meat was fresh. He buys all his meats fresh daily so if he's serving it, it's good to go. Getting a dinner also used to be a great wait to short curcuit the long wait for pizza.Why is DiFara's pizza the best? Initially it's the ingredients. Dom uses only the best imported ingredients including extra virgin olive oil (which is draped over the steaming pie when it exits the oven). Dom also uses buffalo mozzerella which is imported from Italy at great cost. You can see the styrofoam packing crates nearby so it's no joke, this stuff comes in from JFK directly from Italia. This stuff along with domestic fresh mozzerella is combined to create a wonderful creamy crown to the pizza.Dom also uses imported Grana Padano cheese in lieu of the more commonly seen Parmagiano Reggiano, which he grinds and sprinkles over the top of the bubbling pie when it's removed from the oven. The sauce is homemade, of course, there's no bulk made crap here. It's made daily (or semi daily) from imported San Marzano tomatoes, grown in the soil surrounding Mt. Vesuvius. The sauce has a rich sweetness which isn't found in other sauces using other types of tomatoes.  All these ingredients are high in cost individually which is why a slice of Dom's pizza is $4. This cost is passed onto the consumer but if you're a pizza afficianado like I am, you'll find it worth it. There's plenty of slice shops in NY but they don't taste like this.  As far as what to order, Dom has a lot of specialty toppings which all sound great. And they are great as I've tried most of them but it's just that this product doesn't need any accouterments. It's that good au natural. Additionally, the Neopolitan slice is far too thin to support much weight so order with this in mind. There's also a large calzone that can come with imported proscuitto which ruins about $20-$22. A few guys can gorge off this, it's pretty large. The cheese is wonderfully rich and runny, not the gloppy and clumpy mess that you'll find in most pizza place calzones. This stuff is fresh as fresh can be. Dom also snips fresh basil onto his hot pies which got him in trouble with the Dept. of Health but it SO adds to the taste.In addition to growing up on Brooklyn pizza, I've tried nearly all of the ""best"" pizzas in NY so my opinion of this place is based on a lot of trial and error. Suffice it to say, if you're looking for cheap eats or a quick pizza fix, go elsewhere. But if you want some of the best pizza you'll ever have AND have time to kill, venture off to Avenue J in Brooklyn and bite the bullet. I think you'll be happy you did",5.0
"There are plenty of reviews that have been written canonizing this pizza.  And a few that provide the inevitable backlash/contrarian view to combat all the hype.  This review aims to use the elements of the Di Fara experience as ingredients towards a larger contemplation of man's quest for perfection - consider it an homage to Dom's attempt to honor his fantastic ingredients via his pizza-making.....except with infinitely more pretentiousness (extra cheese?) and infinitely less virtuosity (canned sauce).""What is the price of perfection?"" I ponder during my long wait for receiving one man's (a spry, near septuagenarian Dom Demarco) attempt at creating perfection within an edible 15 inch circle of tomato, cheese(s), and dough.  Now this isn't my initial thought, mind you.  I entered with my heart a-thumpin' as I finally found myself at the oft-proclaimed best pizzeria  in New York.  My initial thoughts vacillate between: 1) an internal loop of ""I'm gonna have Di Fara pizza"" that resembles both Eddie Murphy's old ""I have some ice cream"" stand-up bit and commercial pleadings of cartoon dogs for Snausages and Kibbles & Bits2) concern over whether the wait will drive the rest of my family crazy (My cousin had a party about 2 miles away and, after hearing how excited I was about the pizza, my mom, dad, 2 sisters, and sister's fiancee decide to join me in the experience).These pragmatic concerns are taken care of by the key decision (after 30 minutes of waiting) to take 6 slices (1 for each of us) in lieu of our first pie (I had ordered a 2nd pie to go).  The slice was great but too complex to make any grand assessment of it.  I'm left longing for another slice as I bid adieu to my family who head back to the land of malls and hair spray (NJ).As I wait for my pie to go, I start to take in my surroundings. There's nothing fancy or romantic about the place - the only thing distinguishing it vs other northeastern pizza joints are the various framed articles touting Di Fara.  (Not that other pizza places don't toot their own horn - if I had a nickel for every pizza box I've seen with the 'You've tried the rest.  Now try the best' line.  At least Di Fara employs third-party assessments...).  But this place is different in two key ways:1) There isn't a dough-slinger or chef behind the counter - there's an artisan.  You can tell it in the way Dom grates the buffalo mozzarella onto each pie (vs. having the bucket of grated mozzarella cheese to sprinkle on).  Or the way he chops basil and grates another type of cheese (grana padana) to top off the finished pie as classical music plays in the background.                2) There isn't a line of customers waiting for a pie or some slices.  There is chaos. Perhaps due to naivete, I pictured the wait for a Di Fara pie to be a communal experience.  People bonded together for one common objective --- sharing a mutual respect...yadda yadda yadda.  But I'm not seeing a lot of that.  Whatever positive motivations everyone brought to the pizzeria have all but disappeared thanks to the long wait and the infuriating lack of an equitable ordering system. And it's this yin/yang battle separated by a pizza counter that gets me thinking about the price of perfection.  Watching Dom apply his craft is a treat and I can only hope he finds inner peace and tranquility in it.  But the desperation, conflict, and opportunism (people try and often succeed at getting their pie before others) on the other side of the counter feel like a microcosm of other quests for perfection.  Blood diamonds (perfect jewel).  Ethnic cleansing (perfect race), Enron (perfect scam). Steroids (perfect male body).  Eating disorders (perfect female body), The unnecessary zaniness that Balky inflicted on Cousin Larry (perfect strangers), etc.  Is the quest for perfection - even one much more noble than all the above examples - ever worth the cost?After probably 60 minutes of such philosophizing (on top of the earlier 30 minutes), I finally get my pie and can find out whether the pizza truly is worth it.  The first slice is fantastic.  The interplay of the two cheeses has such a sharp, rich taste to it.  The San Marzano tomatoes taste so rustic and earthy.  The basil complements both the cheese and tomatoes.  The crust has a great char to it.  It's like no slice I've had before.  Another slice confirms the assessment --- this could very well be the best pizza I've ever had.But I'm still not totally satisfied.  I don't know if it was the hype, the wait, self-inflicted nihilism or a bit of all three but this odyssey didn't end up being about a search for the best pizza --- it became about a search for the perfect pizza.  And perfection is too much to ask of anyone - even Dom.",5.0
"The most amazing pizza I've ever had in my life. Waited two hours for a pie, and it was worth every second of it. I want to go back to NY, just to eat at Di Fara's again.",5.0
"If I had to rate the pizza alone, that would be 4-5 stars. However, the process of getting the pizza, and, quite frankly the conditions the pizza is made in, take it down a notch. Always overcrowded, there is no rhyme or reason to ordering here, it's every man for himself as there is never any ""line"" just a crowd trying to catch someone's attention like you're bidding on pizza. It can be very irritating so prepare yourself for this. If you're lucky enough to elbow past the crowd to the counter, be prepared to see some rather messy and sometimes downright unsanitary conditions. Sometimes it's better NOT to know where your food comes from. The pizza itself, is delicious. Even though my Mom lives not to far away, I don't go here as often as I'd like just because of the hassle of getting to the pizza.",3.0
"Myself and two of my friends just got back from Di Fara. And it was well worth the trek to Avenue J in Brooklyn to do so. Acknowledging that there would be a considerable wait, we set off from Manhattan around 5:00 and arrived outside Di Fara around 5:45 or so, before they opened for the 6-9pm dinner shift. We walked around the block and came back to a short line which formed outside the restaurant before it opened. It took about 10 minutes, then we got our order for a sausage and pepperoni square pie in. I picked up a Pepsi from the refrigerator and paid for the pizza while my friends got one of the very few seats in the place. There really wasn't any ambiance whatsoever and the service was a bit convoluted, but we began eating somewhere around 6:40.The food was absolutely fantastic. Although the square pie wasn't like any conventional pizza I've had before, it was masterfully crafted. The crust was somewhat thick and a bit dense, and even though the outer edges of the crust were charred, all of the crust was scrumptious. The large chunks of fresh mozzarella(you can watch the guy drain the fluid from the mozzarella bag as he's making your pizza) complemented the crust very well with its stringiness and light taste. The sauce had a very smooth consistency and also tasted great. What really set this pizza apart in my opinion was the generous amounts of olive oil and fresh basil which topped it off -- these made the pizza especially delicious. Also, as a bunch of college students, my friends and I were worried that the rather small-looking square pizza we had just paid $36 for wouldn't be enough to fill us up. On this point, we were most definitely mistaken -- I couldn't even eat my third of the last slice in the box. Even though everything here seems expensive, you get a lot of food for the price.As for whether or not it's better than Grimaldi's, I honestly can't say. It seems like a cop-out, but the circular pizzas at Grimaldi's and the square pizzas at Di Fara are just different enough that it becomes like a comparison between tuna tartar and beef carpaccio -- both somewhat similar in form, but different enough to make them beyond comparison. While the service and ambiance were lacking at best, the food here was good enough to get a five-star rating out of me.",5.0
"Hosannas have been showered upon this place, and there isn't much else to say. But as much as I love Di Fara, it isn't perfect. I hate for my first Yelp review to be crotchety, but I will say, as a caveat, that (duh) the pizza is great.First of all, no pizza can be the best pizza in New York or the world, objectively. But no pizza can be in that upper echelon if it doesn't come from a wood-fired oven. Di Fara's does not have a wood-fired oven. Not many places in New York have one, so Di Fara's, then, is in that upper echelon of pizza places without wood-fired ovens. Persnickety, I know, but Franny's is a few stops away on the Q, and they have one. Then again, they don't have $3 slices. Different ballgame.Also, Dom DeMarco makes all regular (cheese and herb) pizzas, and  then reheats them with the toppings if you ask for them. That's fine for a one-man show -- and his care really shows in the regular slices -- but that means that if you want a pepperoni slice, for instance, he puts the pepperoni on the slice and heats it up again, making the crust too crackery for my taste.And that's a problem only because the crust on the regular slices is so amazing. The best part of a pizza, for me, is the crust, and Di Fara's is pretty near perfect. Dom's toppings are very good -- the cheese is just enough of two types of mozzarella, plus some parmesan (I think), topped with fresh herbs -- and the tomato sauce is great, but his crust is really the accomplishment. And (yes) it's some of the best crust in the city. If you want toppings, order a whole pie.Oh, and to those that say the wait is too long or it's too far away, deal with it. Go on off hours or the weekend. It's 40 feet from a subway stop. No place that serves amazing food that's this close to a major subway line (Q at Avenue J) is too far away from anywhere, as long as you live in the city. As much as it's unfortunate that there's no wood-fired oven, this place is excellent and it's about as accessible as you can expect. The pizza is worth it.",4.0

"It was a rather dull Sunday evening.  After nearly overdosing on the DVD of ""The Office"" (BBC version of course), my man and I thought ""Why not walk over to Di Fara?""  It's in my hood and we needed to get off our asses, so we decided to give it a shot.  The time was then 6:30 pm (this note of time is actually quite important).We get to the joint about 15 minutes later, after a romantic stroll through Ditmas Park/Midwood, only to find a not-so-romantic queue about 25 people strong.  Rather intimidating.  If I didn't have a calming cig-buzz I would probably have turned around right then and headed down the block to ""Brooklyn's Best Kosher Pizza"" and just imagined it was the same thing.  The place is dingy.  Peachy-orange walls, caked tiles, and dust piled on top of the picture frames (most of which are articles praising this modern day mecca of pizza).  It takes about 30 minutes for us to actually be far up enough in the line to  SEE the man behind the magic, ""Dom.""  My first thought is, ""Good God, how old is this guy?""He moves slowly, or as my southern mama would say ""like molasses runnin' uphill in January.""  He hunches over, and squints to see how thickly he grates the fresh mozz over his meticulously shaped and slapped dough.  He has this young whippersnapper assistant who I am convinced does absolutely nothing.  He just keeps disappearing to the back room to ""make sauce.""  The good thing about Dom being so slow, is that I now know exactly how to make my own Di Fara pie, right down to the number of grates of cheese and exact drizzle of olive oil.  I rather enjoyed watching him make his pie....but after a while I was debating whether or not his adamant need to make every pie himself was really sweet and cute or just plain effin' ridiculous.  45 minutes passed, and, after having my hand slapped when reaching for someone's leftover crust, I had to restrain myself from shouting ""Dom!!!  For fuck's sake!!!  Hire some FAST, NIMBLE HANDS!!!!  THE PEOPLE MUST EAT!!!""  Maybe if I had just eaten some shrooms I would have seen his slow-moving, old world solo pizza making routine perfectly nostalgic and spiritual, but in 2007 I must say that it's stupid.  The upper west siders behind me must have been on drugs though, as they said stuff like ""Wow.  He must have a lot of patience.  Just look at his method.

"I last visited in 2006 and on that night waited 3+ hours to eat pizza at Difara.  No exaggeration, I walked in at 6:10, ordered at 6:40 and left at 9:45.  Pizza took all of 15 min to eat.  Even if this was a top 3 pizza in NY, it would not be worth the extra wait.  More importantly, it's not top 3, not even top 20 in terms of taste and texture.  If you think he sprinkles magic dust on this you are nuts.  Look at the pics, no bread product should ever be charred black all over.Good: - Dom obviously cares about the pizza, and he takes his time.  - As far as I can tell he doesn't skimp on quality, the ingredients are good.  - I also like fresh basil added *after* the pizza comes out of the oven, but I think this is because of his tendency to overcook, which would turn the basil to ashes if he cooked it normally.  - It's also a unique experience, I suppose, but in aspects that have nothing to do with the taste: trek far, wait hours, one man show, eat on a dirty table.Bad: - Pizzas are consistently burned, look through pics, both the crust and cheese end up getting TORCHED.  - Too much olive oil added - he pours it on to compensate for the overcooked and dried out pizza.  - Crust is not exceptional. I can't verify the scientific reasons why a gas oven is considered worse than a brick oven, but I can say the Difara crust is very close to my weak gas-ovened home pizzas and nothing like neapolitan (Difara uses a very conventional slot gas pizza oven).  - Expensive.  Most ""quaint obscure Yelp-Hype"" spots are dirty, cramped and CHEAP.  But this place is dirty, cramped, and 2x the cost of the best Manhattan pizza spots.  I feel bad for the neighborhood people who have lived nearby for decades.  They probably used to be able to drop in and say hi and get their friday night pizza, now they gotta fight with NYU Yelp whores armed with $2000 DSLRs, Japanese Hipsters and Kiwis on holiday just to get a slice of the pie.",1.0

He's like the Dalai Lama or something.""  (This is where I snorted and nearly choked on a stolen crumble of fresh parm).  No.  He is not the Italian version of His Holiness .  He is an old man who needs to retire and let that little useless assistant of his actually do some work.Hm.  Negative tirade aside, I must say the pizza was pretty damn good when we finally got home (at 9:30, mind you) and sat down to eat accompanied by more episodes of ""The Office.""  The mixture of cheeses is by far the best I've ever had.  But the wait is definitely not worth it.",2.0
"I last visited in 2006 and on that night waited 3+ hours to eat pizza at Difara.  No exaggeration, I walked in at 6:10, ordered at 6:40 and left at 9:45.  Pizza took all of 15 min to eat.  Even if this was a top 3 pizza in NY, it would not be worth the extra wait.  More importantly, it's not top 3, not even top 20 in terms of taste and texture.  If you think he sprinkles magic dust on this you are nuts.  Look at the pics, no bread product should ever be charred black all over.Good: - Dom obviously cares about the pizza, and he takes his time.  - As far as I can tell he doesn't skimp on quality, the ingredients are good.  - I also like fresh basil added *after* the pizza comes out of the oven, but I think this is because of his tendency to overcook, which would turn the basil to ashes if he cooked it normally.  - It's also a unique experience, I suppose, but in aspects that have nothing to do with the taste: trek far, wait hours, one man show, eat on a dirty table.Bad: - Pizzas are consistently burned, look through pics, both the crust and cheese end up getting TORCHED.  - Too much olive oil added - he pours it on to compensate for the overcooked and dried out pizza.  - Crust is not exceptional. I can't verify the scientific reasons why a gas oven is considered worse than a brick oven, but I can say the Difara crust is very close to my weak gas-ovened home pizzas and nothing like neapolitan (Difara uses a very conventional slot gas pizza oven).  - Expensive.  Most ""quaint obscure Yelp-Hype"" spots are dirty, cramped and CHEAP.  But this place is dirty, cramped, and 2x the cost of the best Manhattan pizza spots.  I feel bad for the neighborhood people who have lived nearby for decades.  They probably used to be able to drop in and say hi and get their friday night pizza, now they gotta fight with NYU Yelp whores armed with $2000 DSLRs, Japanese Hipsters and Kiwis on holiday just to get a slice of the pie.",1.0

"Ten years ago I went to Di Fara pizza and had the most amazing pizza. It hasn't been since 2007 I had visited which I considered the Mecca of Pizza. Due to Doms age and the fact I live in LA now I couldn't wait to have two of my good friends try DiFara. To say I was upset would be an understatement. We arrived 30 mins before they opened to find out there would be no dine in due to a private party. That's a real slap in the face to the customers to have everyone wait and not be able to dine in. We ordered the pizza on the street and was quoted 90 mins. We came back and didn't end up getting our pizza for 2 hours and 10 minutes. But if the pizza was so amazing as it once was you honestly wouldn't mind. Dom has lost it. The pizza was barely cooked and they didn't have the famous Israeli basil. Other than Doms Daughter the rest of the staff couldn't have been ruder. Pushing people out etc. It was total chaos. People yelling arguing and I'm left with a pizza that tasted average but wasn't cooked like it used to be.

"It's something in the oil. Or the cheese. Or the sauce. I have no idea. It combines in this... way... that is difficult if not impossible to describe.I went because of Yelp, and I gotta say.... it's everything everyone here says. It is the pinnacle of pizza, and ridiculously delicious. Everyone's said everything I could--but go. GO.Sal & Carmine's has always been my favorite NY pizza (well, actually I really love Chicago-style the most, but I digress)--Grimaldi's, John's and Lombardi are also good, but not (to me) of the same caliber. This is FAR, FAR beyond even my two beloved Neopolitans on the upper west side :)Dom's also such a character. You gotta love the guy! He's so old-school and sweet, which is so refreshing in this day and age. We went on a Wednesday night at 8:45 (they close at 10) and had our pizza by 9:20--not bad at all. FWIW, people kept coming in long after 10, and getting pizzas without any wait since there was no line at that time of night.Wonderful food. And it reheats surprisingly well--almost as well as Sal & Carmine's. In a 350 degree oven for ten minutes, it tastes better the second time around than most pizza ever can.Just had a second taste of Di Fara's -- this time the square pie. Much thicker, juicier, and with a little more crusty ""harshness"" -- while it's also phenomenal, and more filling since I can eat just one slice and be very very happy, I think I prefer the round pies. They melt in your mouth-- literally! (And, again on a Wednesday night, there was almost no one there and I got my pizza in under 30 minutes!)It is VERY true that each night is different. The pizza is always phenomenal, but certain aspects stand out differently with every pie. My first time, it was the oil; this time, it was the cheese, which is so absurdly delicious I could eat nothing but that.

"Tonight, I found my muse and his name is Domenico Demarco. Dom - as his friends call him - is a kindly old man uncanily reminiscent of Pinocchio's father, Geppetto. Only instead of carving life out of wood, Domenico creates magic out of flour, water and the finest ingredients on the other side of the Atlantic: buffalo mozzarella mixed in with two other cheeses (all imported from Italy), fresh tomatoes, basil leaves cut straight from the plant.This adorable 78 year-old pizzartisan stretches the dough old school, splatters the tomato sauce, and hand grates the mozza on to the crust before drizzling fresh olive oil on top. Every few minutes, he opens the fiery oven door and reaches his arm inside, finger testing the dough. Once baked to perfection, he grabs the piping hot product with his two bare hands, lifting them on to a plate. (No, the man can't be human)The product? None other than one of the best meals of my 32 (count 'em) years. Pure heaven in a bite. Sumptious dollops of onions, mushrooms, sausage and cheese on a thin crust cooked so well that it never once bent. Yes, the crust stood its cantilevered ground. This once-in-a-lifetime delight made Lucali, Grimaldi's and Pepe's seem like Domino's, Pizza Hut and Papa Johns.Most importantly of all, Domenico has stayed incorruptible, maintaining his integrity over the years. Despite all the accolades - #1 pizza in this magazine or that guidebook - his ego has not swollen, as he humbly and quietly creates his art, everyday (but Mondays) from noon til 9.",5.0

"Yes the place is a dump.Yes it may take more than an hour to get your pizza (there is a secret to get your pizza a lot faster but if I told you it wouldn't be a secret, would it? Let me just say when I go there, I usually get it within 5 minutes).Yes they have no AC so it can become insanely hot in the summer.Yes $4 a slice is the most expensive slice I've ever paid for. However, I usually get a though. Comes out much cheaper that way.They favor their regular customers. They will serve their regular customers considerably faster than others.When there is a crowd, it gets very disorganized. Just fight your way to the front and order. Being agressive works to your advantage here.Talk to Dominic (the guy making the pizza) and he will like you and will know to serve you faster in the future.All that will help you.

"It's a very good slice but I hate to say, it's just not worth the wait.  Nowadays there are so many other delicious pizza places throughout Bklyn and Manhattan that one doesn't need to wait 45 minutes for a square slice.  If it's a nice day and you don't mind schlepping out to Di Fara's and you don't mind waiting a LONG time for pizza, go for it.  The place is very simple and old school - which gives it a nostalgic vibe.  But again, not worth it in my opinion.",3.0
Half of my Sicilian slice was fantastic!! Buffalo mozz and crazy good basil and olive oil. The other half was a carbonized brick of what used to be dough before meeting di fara's 19th century pizza oven. You may wait twenty mins for a half-blackened piece of pie...but its worth it.,3.0
"It's something in the oil. Or the cheese. Or the sauce. I have no idea. It combines in this... way... that is difficult if not impossible to describe.I went because of Yelp, and I gotta say.... it's everything everyone here says. It is the pinnacle of pizza, and ridiculously delicious. Everyone's said everything I could--but go. GO.Sal & Carmine's has always been my favorite NY pizza (well, actually I really love Chicago-style the most, but I digress)--Grimaldi's, John's and Lombardi are also good, but not (to me) of the same caliber. This is FAR, FAR beyond even my two beloved Neopolitans on the upper west side :)Dom's also such a character. You gotta love the guy! He's so old-school and sweet, which is so refreshing in this day and age. We went on a Wednesday night at 8:45 (they close at 10) and had our pizza by 9:20--not bad at all. FWIW, people kept coming in long after 10, and getting pizzas without any wait since there was no line at that time of night.Wonderful food. And it reheats surprisingly well--almost as well as Sal & Carmine's. In a 350 degree oven for ten minutes, it tastes better the second time around than most pizza ever can.Just had a second taste of Di Fara's -- this time the square pie. Much thicker, juicier, and with a little more crusty ""harshness"" -- while it's also phenomenal, and more filling since I can eat just one slice and be very very happy, I think I prefer the round pies. They melt in your mouth-- literally! (And, again on a Wednesday night, there was almost no one there and I got my pizza in under 30 minutes!)It is VERY true that each night is different. The pizza is always phenomenal, but certain aspects stand out differently with every pie. My first time, it was the oil; this time, it was the cheese, which is so absurdly delicious I could eat nothing but that. Just realize that your experience will be different (and yummy) each time you go.",5.0
"Tonight, I found my muse and his name is Domenico Demarco. Dom - as his friends call him - is a kindly old man uncanily reminiscent of Pinocchio's father, Geppetto. Only instead of carving life out of wood, Domenico creates magic out of flour, water and the finest ingredients on the other side of the Atlantic: buffalo mozzarella mixed in with two other cheeses (all imported from Italy), fresh tomatoes, basil leaves cut straight from the plant.This adorable 78 year-old pizzartisan stretches the dough old school, splatters the tomato sauce, and hand grates the mozza on to the crust before drizzling fresh olive oil on top. Every few minutes, he opens the fiery oven door and reaches his arm inside, finger testing the dough. Once baked to perfection, he grabs the piping hot product with his two bare hands, lifting them on to a plate. (No, the man can't be human)The product? None other than one of the best meals of my 32 (count 'em) years. Pure heaven in a bite. Sumptious dollops of onions, mushrooms, sausage and cheese on a thin crust cooked so well that it never once bent. Yes, the crust stood its cantilevered ground. This once-in-a-lifetime delight made Lucali, Grimaldi's and Pepe's seem like Domino's, Pizza Hut and Papa Johns.Most importantly of all, Domenico has stayed incorruptible, maintaining his integrity over the years. Despite all the accolades - #1 pizza in this magazine or that guidebook - his ego has not swollen, as he humbly and quietly creates his art, everyday (but Mondays) from noon til 9.",5.0
"I have been going to Di Fara's for the last decade. Hands down the best pizza in NYC. I have tried original Patsy's, grimaldi's, totonno's, Lombardi's and they are all good but do not stand up to the pies at Difara. I know all you people have to wait, but imagine a world where you walked into Difara and they know you by name, you simply say that you want the usual, in my case a plain round, and 10-20 mins later you have a pie or two if necessary. The pizza is sublime, nothing else can be said.",5.0
"ok, the pizza is really really good. thin crust. bubbling cheese right out of the oven. simple but delicious. 5 stars for the pizza.but the wait is just plain ridiculous. it's just 1 guy making the pie. everyone's crowded around the counter hoping he looks your way and takes your order and then everyone watches him slowly work the dough, put the toppings on - i feel like everything is in slow motion. i literally waited 1.5 hours to get my pie - painful!next time, i will get a slice to go - i didn't realize you could do that until i saw someone literally someone get a slice, pay and leave.",5.0
The pizza is worth the long line . You can just smell the fresh basil and the cheese . Only thing I was disappointed with was that the price went up to $5.00 a slice . I travel from California to visit Di Fara . Dominic is the best pizza maker . Yummy !!!!!!!!!!!!,5.0
"An unforgettable experience. Probably the best pizza on the planet. This man is truly dedicated to making the best pie , every time. No matter how far away you are , it is worth the trip. If you really enjoy pizza , and haven't been to Di Fara's , you really must try it. Once you try it , you will be back.You may even decide to move to an apartment nearby. It's that good.",5.0
"Di Fara is an amazing little shop frozen in time.  Places like this increase in value as old school New York vanishes around us all of the time.  The pizza itself is amazing - there's absolutely no doubt about that.  But it is transcendent enough to justify a regular trip out to the middle of nowhere Brooklyn?  Probably not.  But it is the work of an artisan and we should value places like this that do things slowly, with care while they still exist.",4.0
"Yes the place is a dump.Yes it may take more than an hour to get your pizza (there is a secret to get your pizza a lot faster but if I told you it wouldn't be a secret, would it? Let me just say when I go there, I usually get it within 5 minutes).Yes they have no AC so it can become insanely hot in the summer.Yes $4 a slice is the most expensive slice I've ever paid for. However, I usually get a though. Comes out much cheaper that way.They favor their regular customers. They will serve their regular customers considerably faster than others.When there is a crowd, it gets very disorganized. Just fight your way to the front and order. Being agressive works to your advantage here.Talk to Dominic (the guy making the pizza) and he will like you and will know to serve you faster in the future.All that will help you.

"Great pizza but insane wait times. I have visited this establishment on several occasions.

The round slices are great but what puts this place over the top are the squares, its also expensive, $5 a slice, double many other places.

I enjoyed the olive oil he puts on the pizza and the basill taste great. I had to wait an hour for 4 slices which isn't to bad considering that I would of had to wait twice that for a whole pie.

"easily the best new york pizza I've ever had.as any true pizza connoisseur knows, you judge a NY pizza by the plain (cheese) slice, and theirs was the best I've ever had.The process (I watched Dom work his magic)First, he works the crust.  I have no idea how he gets it so thin, but there it is.  thinnest crust I've ever had.Then he ladels on the sauce:  just enough, and not too sweet, not too sour.next is the best part.  the cheese:  mozzarella sliced onto the pie directly, then spread evenly.  freshly grated romano (I think) cheese scattered by hand.  fresh mozzarella torn apart by hand and spread around the pizza.  just before he puts the pizza in the oven, he pours olive oil on top with a can with a long thin spout.after about 10-15 minutes, he takes the pizza out, cuts it up, then scatters some more fresh romano on, drizzles some more olive oil on top, and then gets a pair of scissors and cuts FRESH BASIL on top of the pizza.  just like the classic marguerite style neapolitan.THe result:  a complicated, nutty cheese flavor with the perfect amount of stringiness on paper thin crust and perfect sauce.  damn.The only problem I have with the whole experience, was the wait.  I am supremely grateful that Dom bumped my order in line so I could make my flight, and have his ambrosia-riffic slice of pizza.  He's a really nice old man, probably making pizza the same way for 30+ years.  He's just a little bit busy with all the people waiting and the pizza to make.  however with a 1 hour + wait that everyone I asked in line had, I think there could be an improvement made with the process.  Then.... well there's the environment for the wait.  Walking in the hole-in-the wall, you get rained on by the air conditioning, dripping into a bucket as you walk in.  thing is, it's actually disturbingly refreshing after waiting inside, with the heat, smoke, and smell of burned flour inflaming your eyes, and a few folding tables scattered around the interior.  One of the fridges for cold drinks was broken even.I say this to prepare you.  Prepare to wait a while for the best slice of NY you've ever had.  Prepare for the wait and the smoke.  If they just fixed the place up a little (at least just the air), I'd easily give it 5 stars.",4.0
Everything cooked very well done.Big difference from authentic NY style: Pecorino Romono and lots of Olive Oil on every single pie.It is a good pie but I would never wait for another 40 minutes.

"Just so everyone in San Francisco doesn't think I'm a stingy pizza reviewing bee-atch, I'll pen an ode to the best pizza man ever, my hero, the one and only Domenico DeMarco the proprietor of DiFara's on Avenue J, smack dap in the center of Brooklyn.Dom is amazing and at almost 80 years old he hand makes every single pie at DiFara's today, just the way he has for almost 50 years.  He uses tomatoes he imports himself from his home region in Italy.  He sprinkles each pie with a combo of three high quality cheese - regular semi hard mozzarella, fresh mozzarella and parmesan.  He make two kinds of pies - square and regular.  He offers only a few toppings and they are prepared to order.  When you order a sausage slice, he or a helper goes to the back and slices sausage for your pizza.  The special toppings are artichoke and porcini mushroom - Dom claims to import these things himself.  They are expensive but when you order an artichoke slice you have more artichokes than pizza on your plate and it's worth every penny.  My presonal favorites are sausage (nice and fennel-ly) and the peppers/onions/mushroom combo.  I also always get at least one square and one regular and have been known to eat 4 slices in one visit.Going to DiFara's is like making a pilgrimage.  Since it's only Dom making pies it's a slow process, he makes every pie to order and he's so busy that the pies for slices don't last long.  So every slice is almost fresh out of the oven.  The slowness really gets to some people but I love it.  It means that I get to watch Dom work and that is a beautiful thing.  He is a master at his craft, he creates every pie with love and tenderness, he moves with grace and harmony.  Watching him make pizza is like watching art in motion.  Dom knows all his regulars.  He even remembered me after a nine month absensce.  When I told him I went to Africa, he asked me if I ate pizza in Africa.  When I said yes, he said we'll probably not like this and he was right.  When I said i was moving to California, he said that's too bad he heard that they don't have good pizza there.  And so far he's right.",5.0
"Best pizza in the area.  Went there one memorable day a while back and really enjoyed it. Very happy, great pizza.  A nice place (tiny place) to meet and enjoy good company and good food.  Getting here is easy, plenty of busses and trains go here. Parking is slightly difficult during dinner and lunch times and some weekends.  It is worth trying their pizza. Good non-smoking place (at least when we visited there were no smokers in the place or around the place). The surrounding shopping area is very nice.  You have such a variety of stores, and convenient transportation.    If you want pizza here, go there in the early afternoon, daytime and early supper hours.",5.0
"I came on a Friday afternoon, and was in a rush to get to a job in the area, so I didn't expect a line and did not find one. woohoo! I got two slices and a cream soda to go. The place was crowded by the tables and there weren't any seats available. Otherwise I would have had my fresh slices  right out of the oven immediately. The crowd were not your typical kids after school crowd. You had all ages of sophisticated foodies here. I ran with my box back to my car, got to the job site a few minutes later with just enough time to relax and devour this pizza I hear is so good. I will be the judge. I open the box and sitting before me are two of the most gorgeous, exquisite slices of pizza I have ever seen. I saw the chef cut some fresh basil and sprinkle it onto the pie, but I did not see the sprinkle of grated Parmesan. I missed that one while talking to a friend I grew up with.  Hows that to add to the nostalgia of this experience? The pizza was fierce, the bottom, which I am reading people don't like burnt, was a little blackened on the bottom, adding to the amazing flavor of this pie. If anything, I'd say that launches this pizza into space for being so good. But the Parmesan and the basil definitely make this pizza so much more than ordinary corner pizzeria, Difara's perfects what seems like the most perfect food ever created.",5.0

You can tell he really cares about every single slice and that's all you can really ask for as a customer.

The crust is perfectly rolled, thrown, or whatever he does. It's not too doughy but not thin where it falls apart when you go to eat it. The sauce is old fashioned but compliments the cheese so well. Dom cuts the cheese with an old school pencil sharpener, or at least that's what it looks like. On top of the Bufalo Mozzarella, when the pizza just comes out of the oven, Dom grates some cheese on top along with olive oil.

"I'm a long time listener, first time caller on DiFara's.  What makes this place unique is not only the quality of the pizza, which you've heard tell of so often (the scissor-snipped basil, the San Marzano tomatoes, the cheese, the magical crust/oven calculus), but the respect that the customers show to DeMarco and each other.  Nobody cuts lines, nobody gets rowdy for waiting, and everybody pays a type of silent reverence.  The worst part is people who sit down and camp out at tables, waiting for their pie orders, eating pastries from across the street complaining about the wait.  Order, wait for your pizza, pay, sit down, eat and leave. I think (no experience with toppings) that you should either order the pizza with no toppings or only one.  Any more and you run the risk of soggy crust.  The square pies/slices are unique and a little burned ( the pie was blackened and *burning* coming out of the oven), but amazingly crunchy. The round pies/slices highlight the delicate crust better.  Plus, seeing a man pull a pizza from a 700+ degree oven WITH HIS BARE HANDS is pretty spectacular.  Definitely linger around the counter to make sure that your order is getting taken care of.",5.0
"Di Fara Pizza is definitely a special pie worth waiting for.  Just as much a star of the show as the pizza is the pizzaiolo Dominick DeMarco.  DeMarco alone makes his pizzas. Right before your eyes, he snips off fresh basil onto your pizza and pours a generous amount of olive oil on top as well as a large sprinkling of grated cheese.  These quality  toppings make for an extra special pizza--although the pizza itself is wonderful.  The dough is thin and perfectly executed.  Of course, the downside to Di Fara is the wait, which I thought would be longer based on reading the reviews.  I went at noon on a Wednesday and my pizza was ready within an hour.  I got it to go, as the dining room is VERY small and people seem to grab a table and sit there even if they are not eating.  I thought I did the right thing getting there at opening, but it pays to get there even earlier and secure a seat.  In addition, there is no restroom there so plan accordingly.  I had heard Dominick was like the soup nazi but not at all.  I told him I had come from NC to try his pizza and he was very pleased and happy--seems like a sweet man to me who likes making food the way it SHOULD be made.  Based on what I know about pizza, you can't judge a pizza by ordering just a slice.  The slices take about 20 minutes here, but it is worth getting a whole pie.  If you are desperate for a place to eat it, the Q platform has a nice little ""table"" where you can eat waiting for your train for a quintessential NY dining experience.  I heard from a local on the platform that Dominick may be throwing in the towel soon and it's not certain if his kids will be taking over the place, so RUN to get your pizza soon.",5.0

"DiFara just may be the favorite pizzeria of New York pizza maniacs.  People flock there even though it's hidden in the middle of Brooklyn's Midwood section, at least a few subway stops away from other attractions.  The magic of DiFara lies within the four-caked hands of Domenico Demarco.  Save a few moments of dough prep, Dom is the only person who will touch your pizza before you.  The process starts when he flattens  the dough and ladles on a thin skin of his superbly fruity-sweet sauce.  He does so slowly and with great intent.  The sauce is made from imported San Marzano tomatoes.  He even uses the box as a step stool for help reaching the upper oven.  Next, Dom slices fresh fior di latte (cows' milk mozzarella) directly onto your pie and arranges them with the eye of a true artist.  Next, he reaches for a brine-filled bag of mozzarella di bufala (mozzarella from Italian water buffalo) and pulls the ball apart, distributing bits of the heavenly cheese throughout the surface.  Just before putting the pizza into his oven (the center seems to be a favorite of Dom's) he drizzles top notch olive oil atop the pie.  The test of each pie's readiness come with a crust pinch from Dom himself.  Pies usually bake in about 6-8 minutes, which is nothing compared to the time you've already spent waiting for the pie.  When it's done, Dom will remove it from the oven with his bare hands.  This is totally badass.  Watch how the cheese pulsates like fresh magma oozing in a volcanic pool.  Just in time to awaken you from a state of deep hypnosis, Dom dumps a handful or two of freshly shredded grana padano.  Next, he drizzles yet another helping of olive oil onto the pizza's surface.  This incorporates all three cheeses into one cohesive community of flavor.  Finally, Dom grabs a beautiful bouquet of fresh basil and snips bits of it onto your pie.  It makes me weep.  One time I saw him remove a bit he didn't like and replace it with a more pleasing shred.DiFara also provides a dish of peppers and extra grana padano upon request.  There are both Italian and American sodas available with a couple bottle openers on the counter.  If you're lucky, Dom will have one of his opera cassettes playing while you wait patiently for your pizza.TIPS:- Don't be afraid to place your order as soon as you can grab the attention of Dom or whichever of his children are working.- Maintain eye contact with anyone behind the counter so they don't forget about you.  Just don't be rude.- Don't come hungry, come excited.- Smile, you're about to eat some heavenly pie.",5.0

Dom makes all the pizzas himself; he pulls them out of his prehistoric oven with his bare hands, and sets 'em on the counter still bubbling. He tops each pizza with grated grana panada and fresh basil, then drizzles extra virgin olive oil on top (most of the ingredients are imported from his hometown in Italy). The pizza is oily but not greasy; light and crispy and complex.

"The $5 slice is absurd to begin with. There are some pretty tremendous $2-$2.50 slices out there. But the bigger issue is that the owners of this place must be ""well-connected"". This is now the 3rd time since 2007 they've been shut down for being a health hazard, and our local media beams over it's reopening, going even to the lengths of putting down inspecters. All while the owner jokes about the fly & mouse-laden conditions and remarks that the shut downs are great cause it's nice to get a vacation every now and then. Blatant disrespect for customers and potential customers. Also, in a time where the economy is so rough, they could really hire some staff, for cleanliness and to speed things up, considering the outrages prices. So i have to give them the full thumbs down.",1.0
"The pizza here is good - fresh herbs make it so, BUT it's pricy, and oily, and the restaurant is very poorly run. I had tried to accomodate the wait by calling in advance for a pie, and even going in, ordering, and paying in advance but the owner/chef always kept us waiting until every single person who ordered a slice had been served. He has no problem a store full of small children crying that they are hungry. He's not getting my business with a regular hour and a half wait and I live blocks away. Five bucks a slice - no way!",1.0
"This pizza is the best on the planet. There isn't any better in the city or anywhere else. I love to watch that old man work. He once burned the pizza we had been waiting on. He's way too busy to ask to make another, and he wasn't the kind of guy to get snotty with, so we ate it. And it was STILL the best pizza I could ever hope to eat in this life.",5.0
This place is absolutely amazing! If you don't mind the wait (which can take up to an hour or two) then you have to go try their pizza. The first time I went I didn't know about the Di Fara's special pie....but that's what everyone else around me got so definitely have to give that a try next time!,4.0
"Di Fara Pizzeria serves the best (BEST) pizza I've ever had. The shop is a teensy rathole smack in the middle of an Orthodox Jewish neighborhood (I'm lucky enough to be a local). Dom makes all the pizzas himself; he pulls them out of his prehistoric oven with his bare hands, and sets 'em on the counter still bubbling. He tops each pizza with grated grana panada and fresh basil, then drizzles extra virgin olive oil on top (most of the ingredients are imported from his hometown in Italy). The pizza is oily but not greasy; light and crispy and complex. Dom is ancient, hunched over and unbelievably slow, plus the place is always packed - not too long ago, my boyfriend spent nearly 3 hours waiting for our pizza. It was totally worth it.",5.0
"the people here are sweethearts and the pizza is to die for! now why just three stars you ask?! my friend and i came in here and we ordered a square slice each, with a topping or two. we then sat down, waited and watched the man work his magic in anticipation of holding up our slices to our mouths. however, it took over an hour for us to receive our slices. we watched people come in and order whole pies, eat it all, and then leave before we got our two measly slices. maybe our order got mixed up and was made out of order, but they definitely saw us sitting at the front table waiting and waiting. when we finally got our pizza, we stuffed our faces with them bc they were so very tasty. i just don't know that five bucks a slice, the far ride, and long wait is worth it when i can get other just as good, if not better slices of pizza closer to and/or in the city.",3.0
"This i some of the best pizza I've ever had, and the sauce itself is, bar none, the best sauce I've ever had on a piece of pizza. It's well worth the schlep, the wait, and the price. Go on off hours and eat as much as you can. Don't take it out: it's best eaten right there and as a bonus you can watch the old man himself lovingly and painstakingly make each pie! This place is legendary.",5.0

I loved everything about, the crust, the sauce, the chesse, the drizzling of olive oil and the fresh basil cut on top. Just simply amazing!!!!!! I had to work at the nursing home several other Saturdays and I am sure you could have guessed what I had for lunch each time.  You guessed it..

Frankly, if it weren't busy, it maybe worth one more star. When you walk in, you are confronted by a small room which is ""crowded."" The crowd is partly thanks to the small space and coupled by the long waiting time. Apparently the process is so special in making this pizza, that only the fellow behind the counter can create it. That's right, one guy makes the pizza. Now in this little room, there are tables and chairs. Of course there is no actual room to sit down between people who are eating or just waiting. I have seen greater crowds that appear much smaller simply due to the size of the building. Typically, the crowd is moved along more rapidly.

The pizza is flavorful, but I found myself having trouble maintaining the pizza's structure in order to successfully eat it.

The pizza made by Domenic (the owner and as far as I know sole cook in the pizzeria) it some of the tastiest I've ever tried. One slice is never enough, even two will leave you wanting more. Take the suggestion of other reviewers and order a pie by calling ahead. You will still have to wait a darn long time to get it, but when Domenic hands you an entire pie the jealous looks you will get from the rest of the people waiting at the counter will tell you that you've got something special.While waiting walk around the shop and read the numerous articles and awards that the place has gotten, pick out your drinks from the good selection that he has there, but most importantly watch the care with which Domenic makes the pies and the skill with which he handles the burning hot pies in the oven with his bare hands.

Only once in all the times I've gone there have I gotten lucky enough to get a slice as soon as I came in. That doesn't mean it isn't worth waiting for though. The pizza made by Domenic (the owner and as far as I know sole cook in the pizzeria) it some of the tastiest I've ever tried. One slice is never enough, even two will leave you wanting more. Take the suggestion of other reviewers and order a pie by calling ahead. You will still have to wait a darn long time to get it, but when Domenic hands you an entire pie the jealous looks you will get from the rest of the people waiting at the counter will tell you that you've got something special.While waiting walk around the shop and read the numerous articles and awards that the place has gotten, pick out your drinks from the good selection that he has there, but most importantly watch the care with which Domenic makes the pies and the skill with which he handles the burning hot pies in the oven with his bare hands. This is a dying breed of pizza store and if you don't try it now who knows when and if you will ever find another.",5.0

"I just moved to Brooklyn a few weeks ago.  After my first week here, my friend invites me out to dinner with his wife and her friend.  He tells me about this pizzeria right around the corner only 4 blocks from where I live.  He asks me to get there early and order to pies.  He tells me he'll be there by 8pm.  He asked me to order them at around 6pm.  I was like, uh....why does it take 2 hours to make pizza???  He tells me, trust me, you'll see why it takes so long.  Well I get there early and it wasn't as busy as it normally is apparently.  I stood around watching and talked to a few customers.  Especially after I saw the prices...I was like, wow...$5/slice...$25-30/pizza.  Everyone there told me, people from all over NYC come to Brooklyn for Di Fara's.  Well once I ordered the pies and my friends got there...I got to find out first hand how good this pizza was...I was in pizza heaven...it's definitely the best I've ever had so far in life.  You could taste the quality of all the ingredients.  The fresh basil is what really did it for me.  I don't know if the rumor is true, but supposedly they import all their ingredients from Italy.  The flavor was truly outstanding.   They could definitely use more space as it was pretty crowded considering it wasn't really all that busy.  Other than that, all my friends from the West Coast will definitely be making a trip here with me when they come out to visit.",4.0

"Loved, loved, loved it. We got there at 6p (that's when Yelp says it opens- but it's actually at 630). After an hour long ride on the subway, I wasn't thrilled to wait in line, but WTH- it put us in line first. Ah, yes- line. People queue for this pizza. We waited until 640p, watching the two younger people run around, and the older legend work his dough. When they let us in, it was mere moments until we were served two beautiful slices of oily, basil-decorated cheese pizza. There were different types of cheeses used, and you could tell. You could discern the salty sauce, the perfect oil... Each ingredient stood on its own. A few minutes later, we had another slice- I ordered mine with garlic and onions. There was SO. MUCH. GARLIC. And it was beautifully browned, slightly sweet, and dispersed perfectly. The onions were sliced thinly and in manageably short pieces, so I never got a long, stringy one that caused any sort of mess. This pizza was simply exquisite, and well worth the wait.

Secondly the infamous wait for the pizza. We came early and were some of the first people to put our order in, one regular pie and one square, and it only took about 20 minutes to get the pies.

The regular pie was OK, it was just soaked in olive oil, and the square pie was swimming in olive oil, which made both very very soggy. The best pizza in the world should not be soggy.

I think I was expecting the best pizza I ever ate but I must say that we did not like the pizza at all. We ate about two slices each bc we waited so long for it and at close to 30bucks for the pie, we did not want to waste it. Yes the pizza is thin but thats about all it has going for it. The pizza is really salty. Im not sure if its the cheese or the dough but it was way salty in a bad way. It was also really oily and greasy.

"I'm just waiting for tremendous backlash from DiFara-worshipping Yelpers, as my review lacks that precious fifth star.  And while the pizza was very, very good (and certainly the most entertaining & artistic process I've ever witnessed), I can't bring myself to call it the best pizza in New York.  The wait I'm ok with, the dirt I'm mostly ok with, but when it comes down to it, is it really better than Grimaldi's?  Now first I think I should probably take some responsibility... we ordered too much shit on our pizza - half artichoke/porcini mushroom & half artichoke/pepperoni.  However, getting down to the basics, the cheese was ok, but not enough of it (again, our fault).  I do prefer Grimaldi's cheese, I think.  The sauce is kickass though.  Definitely the best of all the 'best ny pizza' contenders.  Those San Marazano tomatoes and the fresh basil topping are unbeatable.  The crust was pretty good (love those pockets of olive oil), but I prefer the saltiness of Lombardi's crust.  The pizza was very greasy, but I don't have any issue with that.  I've never really understood why pizza loving people don't like grease... it's extra flavor!  And if you're on a diet, you should be skipping pizza altogether! :) As for the toppings, I stole a piece of pepperoni, and it was outstanding (I really need to stop calling myself a vegetarian... it's just so hard to be an adventurous eater and not occasionally sample a tiny piece of meat!).  Artichokes and porcini mushrooms were good, but in the end I think canned artichokes in general are never that great (so I should stop ordering my pizza with them) and the mushrooms were huge, which of course took up room where cheese could be!!The best part of the entire process is watching Dom De Marco mold the dough, lob hunks of fresh romano off a big round and grind by hand, and personally snip fresh basil right over the pizza.  He's inarguably an artisan.  In summary - Sauce: A+++Basil: A+Crust: B+Cheese: A-Other toppings: A-/B+ (love those split grades)",4.0

Ok I know that there a re a million reviews on this place but I went here on Saturday with my boyfriend and felt the need to contribute. We arrived around 5:15 and waited until around 7 to get our pizza. It was sooo worth the wait.  This is the BEST pizza I have ever eaten and I've had a lot. I could watch that man make pizza all day.  And the reason that the pizza is so good...Because each one is made with love.,5.0
"Even though it costs $5 a slice and you have to wait an eternity for one slice, and there usually isn't anywhere to sit,  I still will drive to get this pizza!

"While it made for a fun adventure, to come and try Di Fara's pizza, the product itself is not so impressive.  The place is really run down and unclean looking, although they now have an ""A"" rating.  The seating is something you would imagine in some of the least appealing pizza places you might imagine.  But most importantly the pizza...the biggest disappointment was the crust.  It had very little character and was hard and cracker like.  To me it is usually the crust that makes a pizza.  The other ingredients can make almost any pizza taste good but the crust can make a pizza great.  In this case the sauce was ok with chunks of tomato, obviously canned tomato, not highly seasoned or even modified in any way.  The cheese is half a one pound chunk of mozzarella, like any of us buy in the supermarket, that is hand grated by the elderly pizza maker, and spread on the pie.  He adds a big handful of grated cheese after baking and cuts some basil roughly over the pie with a scissor.  The pizza tastes very good due to the abundance of cheeses and basil and an adequate sauce.  However the lack of a crust with character makes the pie unimpressive.",2.0
"My husband and I were so excited to come here to try the pizza. We had just taken ""Scotts Pizza Tour"" and Scott totally recommended this place and based on all the positive reviews, we had to stop by before we left New York. When we got there, the place was pretty packed. Its a tiny pizza parlor with 3-4 tables. We waited for close to a hour for our pizza. I think I was expecting the best pizza I ever ate but I must say that we did not like the pizza at all. We ate about two slices each bc we waited so long for it and at close to 30bucks for the pie, we did not want to waste it. Yes the pizza is thin but thats about all it has going for it. The pizza is really salty. Im not sure if its the cheese or the dough but it was way salty in a bad way. It was also really oily and greasy. Compared to all the pizza I have had in New York, this place had the worst. It just was not that good and totally not worth the long trip down to Brooklyn and the long wait. We were totally disappointed.",2.0
"There's nothing I can say that hasn't been said before.  The naysayers/haters will always be there.  Get past the negatives:  The long wait, the $30 pie, the small sometimes dirty looking place and get down to what you are really there for, the Pizza, and you will find perfection.  Completely redefined what I knew about pizza, and not in one of these trendy gimmicky ways.  It is the pizza you know, with flavors that are so complex and fantastic it's difficult to look at Pizza the same again.  Personally I recommend the plain pizza as toppings only interfere with the flavors of perfection.Hear the ""mmmm's""  coming from other people who are lucky to have already gotten their pizza, and sit back and watch the show that is Dom.  I true Pizza master.  enjoy the show and magic while it lasts, because Dom is getting up in age, and when he is done, this pizza will be extinct, the thing of legends, as no one can recreate what this Pizza Maestro has mastered!",5.0
"Everyone has mentioned the wait, and yes I've waited about 45 minutes every time I've been to DiFara, but the wait is actually a pleasure and just as essential to the total DiFara experience as the pizza is.  The slow pace at DiFara just feels right when you enter a space where time has stood still for about 35 years (take a look at the cash register) and where every pizza is meticulously and slowly handmade.  The crowd at DiFara has to be one of the most truly mixed and diverse anywhere in New York, and they're all waiting patiently just like you.  It's therapeutic to go to a place like this and not be rushed, and to leave an hour or so later with a much slower pulse and a much happier stomach.",5.0

"I lived in Brooklyn for 12 years (not too far from this pizzeria) but never heard of Di Fara's until recently. My brother-in-law found DiFara's on gayot and we decided to give it a try. We went there on a Saturday around 1PM. Although there was a long line it moved pretty quickly. However there were only 3 people working, 5 tables, maybe about 13 chairs and 50 people crammed into the tiny place. The only reason the line moved quickly was because a lady takes down the orders in a notebook. After about an hour we managed to get a table. After another hour we finally got our pizza. The pizza was good, not great though and with the wait and the lack of seating i would never go back again. I've had way better pizza without the wait and definitely not as pricey ($5 a slice???!!!) save yourself the time and trouble and go somewhere else unless you like to wait 2 hours for mediocre pizza from a pizzeria that's been closed down a few times for unsanitary conditions.",3.0

my favorite place ever!! go go go go go!,5.0
"Let it be known.  I LOVE DiFara's Pepperoni Pizza!  It as good, if not better, than any other pepperoni pizza I've had (and that includes Frank Pepe's, Sally's, Totonno's, Grimaldi's, Any Chicago Deep Dish Incarnation, etc.)  The Pepperoni is meaty, thickly sliced and simply delectable. The crust is like no other, with different textural give and crunch than any I've experienced.  The sauce is delectable.  And, the cheese is worthy of the highest praise (especially when you get your mitts on a paper plate-full of shredded goodness for additional application).The Square Pie is also VERY GOOD, yet inconsistent (overly charred the second time I ordered it) but delicious, nonetheless.  As a whole the pizzas can be tad oily, especially meat versions, but that is not really detractor for me (it just limits the overall amount I can scarf down).So, how can I only give 3 stars?  It's ridiculous, right?  Maybe.  But let's count the reasons, shall we?:1. The Definition of Inefficiency: This is, without a doubt, the worst run business, EVER:  - Order Taking and Delivery: Devoid of any logic.  And, on two seperate visits, late-comers got their pies, prior.  Not a huge deal if it didn't happen 4 and 6 times on those visits.- Slice Scavengers: for a man overwhelmed with demand, the fulfillment of the $4 slice should come to an end.  Inevitably, those customers always get there pie orders completed quicker.  Coincidence?- Counter Help: a term use very loosely, as these might be dimmest individuals ever to stand erect.- Workflow: Items utilized to construct these pizzas seem to be strewn all over the place (cheese in three different locales, dough kept in the back, toppings never on hand, et al). - Lastly, chefs should not be ringing up orders.  EVER.To conclude, I envy those individuals who able to visit and obtain their orders within 1 and 1/2 hours.2. This is also, without a doubt, one of filthiest food purveyors I've ever paid a return visit:- The walls are, literally, dripping with muck.  - The pictures have dead bugs affixed.- The tables are NEVER wiped down during service.- The condiments are hastily provided.  And, on several occassions, I've witness people use their hands to extract hot peppers (witnessed by the owner, without a word muttered).  Frikkin' nasty!- The slats open to the kitchen are adorned with inch-thick dust.- The wood floor, on which the pies are crafted, is utterly disgusting.- The counter utilized to sliced the pies are up front where customers cough, sneeze, spittle all over them.- As noted, previously, the same person who makes the pies handles the money (some of the most disgusting material EVER, mind you).- And, without fail, the beverage fridge will have multiple exploded containers held within.- But, if you don't believe me...go to the Board of Health and Read Up on their reviews of DiFara's.  Two words: Rodent Droppings.   Now, excuse me as I will, now, vomit.  I should have read up on this place earlier.To conclude: I want some penicillin.3. Clientele: Sorry, but some of most abrasive, obnoxious, loud and rude people I've ever encountered, have been at this establishment.  But, for further atmosphere, you also have to fend off the routine visits of pan-handlers who come and go throughout the ""restaurant"", sometimes idling up right next to you while you eat.To conclude: Not a shining endorsement for Brooklynites.Now, I know there are those who can overlook such things; I am just not one of those people.  Nothing is worth re-enduring the wait, the patrons, nor the grime of this establishment.  I've done it several times as I am foodie and pizza fanatic, but life is too short for such nonsense.  And, as good as the pizza is, it isn't that much better than other places; and other places have other pizza items that are superior (see: Frank Pepe's Clam Pie, for example).  Final Conclusion: Goodbye DiFara's.  And, best wishes.",3.0

"I lived in Brooklyn for 12 years (not too far from this pizzeria) but never heard of Di Fara's until recently. My brother-in-law found DiFara's on gayot and we decided to give it a try. We went there on a Saturday around 1PM. Although there was a long line it moved pretty quickly. However there were only 3 people working, 5 tables, maybe about 13 chairs and 50 people crammed into the tiny place. The only reason the line moved quickly was because a lady takes down the orders in a notebook. After about an hour we managed to get a table. After another hour we finally got our pizza. The pizza was good, not great though and with the wait and the lack of seating i would never go back again. I've had way better pizza without the wait and definitely not as pricey ($5 a slice???!!!) save yourself the time and trouble and go somewhere else unless you like to wait 2 hours for mediocre pizza from a pizzeria that's been closed down a few times for unsanitary conditions.",3.0
"It's a long way, but it's worth it. The pizza is amazing!",5.0
my favorite place ever!! go go go go go!,5.0
"Let it be known.  I LOVE DiFara's Pepperoni Pizza!  It as good, if not better, than any other pepperoni pizza I've had (and that includes Frank Pepe's, Sally's, Totonno's, Grimaldi's, Any Chicago Deep Dish Incarnation, etc.)  The Pepperoni is meaty, thickly sliced and simply delectable. The crust is like no other, with different textural give and crunch than any I've experienced.  The sauce is delectable.  And, the cheese is worthy of the highest praise (especially when you get your mitts on a paper plate-full of shredded goodness for additional application).The Square Pie is also VERY GOOD, yet inconsistent (overly charred the second time I ordered it) but delicious, nonetheless.  As a whole the pizzas can be tad oily, especially meat versions, but that is not really detractor for me (it just limits the overall amount I can scarf down).So, how can I only give 3 stars?  It's ridiculous, right?  Maybe.  But let's count the reasons, shall we?:1. The Definition of Inefficiency: This is, without a doubt, the worst run business, EVER:  - Order Taking and Delivery: Devoid of any logic.  And, on two seperate visits, late-comers got their pies, prior.  Not a huge deal if it didn't happen 4 and 6 times on those visits.- Slice Scavengers: for a man overwhelmed with demand, the fulfillment of the $4 slice should come to an end.  Inevitably, those customers always get there pie orders completed quicker.  Coincidence?- Counter Help: a term use very loosely, as these might be dimmest individuals ever to stand erect.- Workflow: Items utilized to construct these pizzas seem to be strewn all over the place (cheese in three different locales, dough kept in the back, toppings never on hand, et al). - Lastly, chefs should not be ringing up orders.  EVER.To conclude, I envy those individuals who able to visit and obtain their orders within 1 and 1/2 hours.2. This is also, without a doubt, one of filthiest food purveyors I've ever paid a return visit:- The walls are, literally, dripping with muck.  - The pictures have dead bugs affixed.- The tables are NEVER wiped down during service.- The condiments are hastily provided.  And, on several occassions, I've witness people use their hands to extract hot peppers (witnessed by the owner, without a word muttered).  Frikkin' nasty!- The slats open to the kitchen are adorned with inch-thick dust.- The wood floor, on which the pies are crafted, is utterly disgusting.- The counter utilized to sliced the pies are up front where customers cough, sneeze, spittle all over them.- As noted, previously, the same person who makes the pies handles the money (some of the most disgusting material EVER, mind you).- And, without fail, the beverage fridge will have multiple exploded containers held within.- But, if you don't believe me...go to the Board of Health and Read Up on their reviews of DiFara's.  Two words: Rodent Droppings.   Now, excuse me as I will, now, vomit.  I should have read up on this place earlier.To conclude: I want some penicillin.3. Clientele: Sorry, but some of most abrasive, obnoxious, loud and rude people I've ever encountered, have been at this establishment.  But, for further atmosphere, you also have to fend off the routine visits of pan-handlers who come and go throughout the ""restaurant"", sometimes idling up right next to you while you eat.To conclude: Not a shining endorsement for Brooklynites.Now, I know there are those who can overlook such things; I am just not one of those people.  Nothing is worth re-enduring the wait, the patrons, nor the grime of this establishment.  I've done it several times as I am foodie and pizza fanatic, but life is too short for such nonsense.  And, as good as the pizza is, it isn't that much better than other places; and other places have other pizza items that are superior (see: Frank Pepe's Clam Pie, for example).  Final Conclusion: Goodbye DiFara's.  And, best wishes.",3.0

"I live in Midwood. I'd heard great things about DiFara's, and seen Domenic working away through the windows of his shop (viewed though the pots of basil and rosemary plants - cool). And of course i'd seen the lineups before opening time. but i'm vegan. vegans can eat pizza, but tend to get it at places like Two Boots or Cafe Viva that feature vegan slices, or Rosarios in the LES who make great marinara slices.  You *can* eat at most regular pizza joints, but you run the risk of them not listening or not believing you when you say ""no cheese"". Then you're kind of screwed. (Never phone-order vegan pizza.) Anyway, i've got Domenic's pizza twice: once he listened and once he just didn't believe me. the one i had was heavenly -- the perfect texture for the dough, and incredible sauce, with intact tomatoes, pungent and delicate and exciting. There were some mushrooms and chopped tomatoes as toppings, but they weren't even necessary, probably. Fresh garlic. He snips basil from the bunch over the cooked pie. Right before closing the box he drizzles a spiral of olive oil over your pizza. Very good. My roomate got the cheese one. Not sure if i'll go back, because the lineup/crowd was ridiculous and i don't want another cheese mistake, but i'm glad i got to try it, and i loved watching Domenic in action.

"i feel bittersweet about this significant event in my life. and i'll tell you why. i have been on a quest to find the best pizza in the world. although i thought nothing could beat mamma lucia's (see my review), i decided there must be better pizza out there. i just had a feeling. so i began my quest, and it ended much earlier than i anticipated. i journeyed far and wide to the heart of brooklyn and that's where the holy grail of pizza was hidden. so, i am a little sad that the quest is over, though i will still wholeheartedly try pizza that someone claims to be the best in the world. let me know. for being such a yelp virgin, am i giving 5-star ratings too frivilously? ah, well, i don't care. this place deserves it. i made the trek from the upper east side to avenue j to taste this pizza after having a less-than-amazing experience with grimaldi's. after reading what other yelpers had to say about di fara's, i was magnetized onto the Q line. getting a pizza at di fara's is quite an experience for a pizza enthusiast. nobody seems to care about the long line of people because they are so mesmerized by dom demarco and his delicate pizza crafting abilities. i'll summarize my experience here. i got to di fara's around 8pm on a sunday night. the Q line wasn't running to avenue J that night for some reason, so I had to get out early and take a cab there. fortunately, because the Q line stop wasn't running, there were significantly less people there than i expected. i guess not everyone is as hardcore as me in their pursuit of the best pizza in the world... so i get there, and there's probably about 10-15 people in line. and when i say line, i mean a big group around the counter. everyone is silent and staring intently at the adorable man behind the counter, who is putting toppings on pizzas like he was in a science lab - perfect portions and exact amounts of each topping. i am still in awe that for each pizza he takes a new ball of fresh mozzerella, still in the bag, drains it, and then crumbles it by hand over the pizza. he grates another type of cheese over the pizza as well, and cuts the basil with scissors. he pauses a few times to drizzle olive oil over the pizza. and this happens with EVERY pizza, so you bet your ass you'll be waiting in line for awhile. but, as other yelpers have yelped, it is SO worth it. i would stand there for hours to watch this guy make pizzas. its just incredible. if only this pizza weren't so far away...but i think that's part of what makes me covet it so much, i have to WORK for it. ok, so i know its ""gross"" to eat food in the subway and all that, but when i got my pizza there was no way in hell i was waiting an hour to get back up to my apartment. i sat down on the concrete in the subway station and opened up my delicious pizza and took my first bite right there. and that's when my life changed. i knew i had tasted the best pizza in the world. what do you do when you realize all your dreams have come true??",5.0

"Walking into Di Fara's was like walking into a little bubble encapsulating the whole city of New York. To my left is a Sicilian Harley biker with a heavy accent talking to a hedge fund manager from Westchester. To my right there are a group of ""youts"" from jersey city, the leader of which is barking orders to his minions to secure a table. There are families, there are babies, there is the moody daughter who is turns from sweet to malicious in seconds, and then there is dom, oblivious to all the havoc and theatrics, making his pies one by one, dough-sauce-mozzarella-olive oil-bake-olive oil under-basil from both ends-olive oil over-cheese then repeat. A routine he's been doing for years and years. After waiting for an hour or so we get a slice. With eager anticipation, I grab the it with my hand, and its so hot, I almost drop the precious slice. (Dom must have some bionic fingers because he just pulls the pie right off the oven with his bare hands). When the slice has cooled off to reasonability, I take a bite...the heavens open up and I am transported to pizza nirvana. A blissful combination of ingredients and love. Unbelievable. If there's one bite of food I will be craving from all my meals in New York, it will be this.  We waited another hour and half for 2 more slices.",5.0
"I stumbled upon this place incidentally on the way to a doctor's office that was a block away.  It was about 8 years ago when the slice cost 2.50 at Dom's and 1.50 anywhere so my first reaction was-what is this dingy overpriced place?  But, I was so hungry that I said, whatever, I just need to eat something.  Little did I know that I have stepped into the legendary Di Fara land but upon taking the first bite I realized that this was something unusual and when I saw people walking in and the place getting crowded by the second, I knew this was something famous.  Of course, the next day I searched for the place on the Internet and this is how my love affair has started.  I usually try to call ahead and surprisingly, I have always gotten my order made on time.  Maybe it's the fact that when Dom picks up the phone, I always call him by his first name so although I am not a stead regular, it sounds that I am.  The pizza is absolutely delicious, thin crust, the perfect balance of sweetness of the sauce and the tanginess of the cheese.",5.0
"Once you get past the fact that Difara's probably has not been cleaned since the Nixon administration, you are in for a real treat by way of the best pizza in New York.  The old man is some kind of genius, with herb garden growing beside the ovens, and his meticulous attention to detail.  Some things in life are worth the wait...like the Jay-Z and Nas reunion *tear*...and a slice from Difara's is equally worth the wait.  I once waited 40 minutes to get a slice, only to devour it in seconds, and then return for a 25 minute wait to get a second slice.  I think your best bet is to spring for a pie, because if you opt for a single slice, you will be left pining for more.  Sitting and waiting has its advantages at Difara, though.  When the joint gets really packed, you get to witness this neurotic ballet performed by locals, hipsters (who probably read about Difara's in the Village Voice's Best of NY) and whoever else is waiting for the divine offerings of Difara's.  People will get up ten times or more during their wait and nervously pace the floor by the counter, as if after 40 years in the business, the old man is finally going to fuck up and it's going to be THEIR order.  The old man is so calm, though, it's almost scary.  If I had to run a booming mom & pop business like that, with minimal help, I'd be a nervous wreck.  But if one TRULY wants to measure the greatness of a Difara slice, first, head over to one of Avenue J's countless kosher pizza joints.  Try one of THEIR slices, and then grab one at Difara's.  The choice is clear:  The Jews may be God's chosen people, but Difara's is God's chosen pizza.",5.0

"i feel bittersweet about this significant event in my life. and i'll tell you why. i have been on a quest to find the best pizza in the world. although i thought nothing could beat mamma lucia's (see my review), i decided there must be better pizza out there. i just had a feeling. so i began my quest, and it ended much earlier than i anticipated. i journeyed far and wide to the heart of brooklyn and that's where the holy grail of pizza was hidden. so, i am a little sad that the quest is over, though i will still wholeheartedly try pizza that someone claims to be the best in the world. let me know. for being such a yelp virgin, am i giving 5-star ratings too frivilously? ah, well, i don't care. this place deserves it. i made the trek from the upper east side to avenue j to taste this pizza after having a less-than-amazing experience with grimaldi's. after reading what other yelpers had to say about di fara's, i was magnetized onto the Q line. getting a pizza at di fara's is quite an experience for a pizza enthusiast. nobody seems to care about the long line of people because they are so mesmerized by dom demarco and his delicate pizza crafting abilities. i'll summarize my experience here. i got to di fara's around 8pm on a sunday night. the Q line wasn't running to avenue J that night for some reason, so I had to get out early and take a cab there. fortunately, because the Q line stop wasn't running, there were significantly less people there than i expected. i guess not everyone is as hardcore as me in their pursuit of the best pizza in the world... so i get there, and there's probably about 10-15 people in line. and when i say line, i mean a big group around the counter. everyone is silent and staring intently at the adorable man behind the counter, who is putting toppings on pizzas like he was in a science lab - perfect portions and exact amounts of each topping. i am still in awe that for each pizza he takes a new ball of fresh mozzerella, still in the bag, drains it, and then crumbles it by hand over the pizza. he grates another type of cheese over the pizza as well, and cuts the basil with scissors. he pauses a few times to drizzle olive oil over the pizza. and this happens with EVERY pizza, so you bet your ass you'll be waiting in line for awhile. but, as other yelpers have yelped, it is SO worth it. i would stand there for hours to watch this guy make pizzas. its just incredible. if only this pizza weren't so far away...but i think that's part of what makes me covet it so much, i have to WORK for it. ok, so i know its ""gross"" to eat food in the subway and all that, but when i got my pizza there was no way in hell i was waiting an hour to get back up to my apartment. i sat down on the concrete in the subway station and opened up my delicious pizza and took my first bite right there. and that's when my life changed. i knew i had tasted the best pizza in the world. what do you do when you realize all your dreams have come true??",5.0
mMm. YUM! I love their square pizzas. Their sauce is nothing like Prego. Their cheese is nothing compared to cheap neighborhood pizzeria cheese. it's very good. I'd say it's the best pizza in the city.,5.0
"it's good. it's really freakin good. but damn, that old man needs to let someone else help him make the pizza. we waited about 1.5 hours for a pizza. he also needs to stop selling pizza by the slices when he has about 100 people waiting for whole pies.",4.0
"Walking into Di Fara's was like walking into a little bubble encapsulating the whole city of New York. To my left is a Sicilian Harley biker with a heavy accent talking to a hedge fund manager from Westchester. To my right there are a group of ""youts"" from jersey city, the leader of which is barking orders to his minions to secure a table. There are families, there are babies, there is the moody daughter who is turns from sweet to malicious in seconds, and then there is dom, oblivious to all the havoc and theatrics, making his pies one by one, dough-sauce-mozzarella-olive oil-bake-olive oil under-basil from both ends-olive oil over-cheese then repeat. A routine he's been doing for years and years. After waiting for an hour or so we get a slice. With eager anticipation, I grab the it with my hand, and its so hot, I almost drop the precious slice. (Dom must have some bionic fingers because he just pulls the pie right off the oven with his bare hands). When the slice has cooled off to reasonability, I take a bite...the heavens open up and I am transported to pizza nirvana. A blissful combination of ingredients and love. Unbelievable. If there's one bite of food I will be craving from all my meals in New York, it will be this.  We waited another hour and half for 2 more slices.",5.0
"I stumbled upon this place incidentally on the way to a doctor's office that was a block away.  It was about 8 years ago when the slice cost 2.50 at Dom's and 1.50 anywhere so my first reaction was-what is this dingy overpriced place?  But, I was so hungry that I said, whatever, I just need to eat something.  Little did I know that I have stepped into the legendary Di Fara land but upon taking the first bite I realized that this was something unusual and when I saw people walking in and the place getting crowded by the second, I knew this was something famous.  Of course, the next day I searched for the place on the Internet and this is how my love affair has started.  I usually try to call ahead and surprisingly, I have always gotten my order made on time.  Maybe it's the fact that when Dom picks up the phone, I always call him by his first name so although I am not a stead regular, it sounds that I am.  The pizza is absolutely delicious, thin crust, the perfect balance of sweetness of the sauce and the tanginess of the cheese.",5.0
"Once you get past the fact that Difara's probably has not been cleaned since the Nixon administration, you are in for a real treat by way of the best pizza in New York.  The old man is some kind of genius, with herb garden growing beside the ovens, and his meticulous attention to detail.  Some things in life are worth the wait...like the Jay-Z and Nas reunion *tear*...and a slice from Difara's is equally worth the wait.  I once waited 40 minutes to get a slice, only to devour it in seconds, and then return for a 25 minute wait to get a second slice.  I think your best bet is to spring for a pie, because if you opt for a single slice, you will be left pining for more.  Sitting and waiting has its advantages at Difara, though.  When the joint gets really packed, you get to witness this neurotic ballet performed by locals, hipsters (who probably read about Difara's in the Village Voice's Best of NY) and whoever else is waiting for the divine offerings of Difara's.  People will get up ten times or more during their wait and nervously pace the floor by the counter, as if after 40 years in the business, the old man is finally going to fuck up and it's going to be THEIR order.  The old man is so calm, though, it's almost scary.  If I had to run a booming mom & pop business like that, with minimal help, I'd be a nervous wreck.  But if one TRULY wants to measure the greatness of a Difara slice, first, head over to one of Avenue J's countless kosher pizza joints.  Try one of THEIR slices, and then grab one at Difara's.  The choice is clear:  The Jews may be God's chosen people, but Difara's is God's chosen pizza.",5.0
"i take back one star because it's not always fun to wait two hours for your pizza, but the four stars is for the pie (though i'm not a big fan of the crust) and the absolute wonder that fills me up when i watch the master make each pizza with such love and ease. if you live nearby, it's definitely worth the walk over to fill your order and come back a couple hours later to pick it up; otherwise, it's worth the one, long pilgrimage for the difara experience, but probably just that one time. and a word for the wise: order a couple of pies at once to save time, even if you're not completely sure you could finish one.",4.0
"Like every other Brooklynite, I'm very particular about my pizza and Di Fara does not disappoint--it actually exceeded my expectations (since I've gotten mixed reviews from friends)..I thought I reached pizza heaven when I ate at L&B's and Lombardi's and this places tops them both in taste and quality of pizza (although the above mentioned pizza places are still among the best I've ever had) yes this place is seedy/greasy looking and has no seats and you smell like ""kitchen"" after you walk about but it is truely worth it to see the master Dom at work..the pies come out bubbling as he sprinkles cheese, cuts fresh basil leaves, and drizzles berio olive oil all over it..truely a masterpiece..my friends who made the trip from LI wanted to take some home but concluded that it'd get soggy and they would probably scarf it down before they got on the highway anyhow. The only criticism I have of the pizza is that one of our pies were burnt on one side but that won't stop me from coming back and bringing hungry friends with me.",5.0

"Does not look like anything special, except for the crowds.  1 Block from the Q train, often hard to park in the neighborhood.  Pizza slices are great, and the Sicilian square pizza is out of this world.  All fresh, real ingredients, slowly and carefully prepared by Dominic, the owner.  Did I say slow?  Don't be surprised at an hour wait when it is busy, but worth it.  Not the cleanest place you'll ever eat, but overlook it and enjoy the food.",5.0

"This has to be the best pizza experience in all of New York and not just because the pizza is the best in New York City, but because of the unique process that goes into making it.  The pizza here is perfect, with a nice crunchy, thin and sweet crust and a tomato sauce that has no equal.  It is some amazing stuff that the owner makes himself.  But we'll get to that in a minute.  The toppings are all mouth-watering and very fresh while the cheese is too good to be true, even if it looks a little different from your normal pizza.  But this is no ordinary pizza.  This is DiFara, where there is one guy making each and every pizza pie with the freshest ingredients possible, which he keeps in the back and are all imported from the motherland of italy.  The process is long and arduous but in the end, you don't care as the pizza is just too tasty to make you upset.  My dad and I finished a whole large plain pie.  He usually doesn't eat that much pizza, so I was really impressed with it.  Try to call beforehand and order fifteen to thirty minutes before getting there, because it takes the seventy-year-old owner that long to make the heavenly pies.  The reason why is as follows:  first, he kneads the dough and pours on the fresh tomato sauce made there.  Next, he adds the mozzarella cheese off of a fresh slab of mozzarella, which looks pretty cool, as it isn't shaved but cut into quite lage pieces all over the pizza.  Still covers the pizza very well and is all in all, a great way to do it.  Then it goes in the oven and he continues.  This is all without gloves and who cares about the health department because this place is just too good for them.  His Igor-like assistant brings him any ingredients or toppings that he needs from the back and this goes on all day.  When done, the pizza comes out with the cheese still bubbling and this is where it gets too good.  He sprinkles fresh parmeasan cheese on the pie and then adds fresh basil by actually taking the plant and cutting it over the pie with a pair of scissors.  Hey, he could be doing it with his hands, so the scissor is fine by me. Now, you wait for the pizza to cool and then, pizza bliss as you bite into it.  This pizza really lived up to the hype and was a fantastic meal to leave new york for college.  Last great taste of New York before heading down South.  The place is a hole-in-the-wall type pizza parlor but it just can't be beat.  Parking meters are around and the subway train is right by the pizza place, so getting there ain't the problem.  It's the wait that upsets some, but just have some patience and you'll be feasting on what is the best pizza in new york and you'll have a great story for your pals.",5.0
