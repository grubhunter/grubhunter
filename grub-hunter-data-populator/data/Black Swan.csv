"It's more like 3.5 but the service was great so we'll call it an even 4 stars. We came early on a Saturday evening.  Considering it was only like 5:30-6 o'clock the music was waaaaay too loud. There were only 2 other tables of people eating and at the most another 10 people at the bar. The music didn't need to be that loud.  If it were like 8-9 on a Saturday night that would obviously be different.Anyway, the mussels and fries were fantastic. They could've been a little more generous with the fries but the broth from the mussels made it all worth it.  My girlfriend got the burger, which neither of us were crazy about. Maybe we came on an off day..? I see a lot of people raving about the burgers.  Sweet potato fries were an optional side with the burger and they were probably the best sweet potato fries either of us have ever had.  Great beer selection and happy hour as well!",4.0
"Annoyed! I'm at a dinner party I arrived later so I just wanted to order drinks at the bar and have my own tab so when my other friend came we could just have our own tab. . Doris the manager. Says ""Excuse me where are you sitting,""""In the back""""Ok, you have to order drinks with your server""I said"" I don't want to, i would like my own tab at the bar""""Well that's not the way it works so please order with your server and tell her you want your own tab""""I won't""So, I sat at the dinner party without a drink and was planning on ordering food later, but I won't do that either. Guess what else doesn't work here, My money.",1.0
"So disappointed with our experience last night. Been meaning to try this place out for a while - been looking for a new neighbourhood restaurant and being British this place looked ideal. Bad experience started when I called to inquire about their roast - asked the first person who answered the phone if they were doing a roast today, they didn't reply and passed the phone to someone else, this happened again with the next person. Finally got someone on the line who replied, and after asking several times if they do a roast dinner, they told me they 'don't do anything like that here.' After checking online to make sure I didn't have the wrong place, my partner called back, confirmed that they do indeed do a roast dinner on a Sunday, and booked a table. When we arrived there was no record of our booking. The decor was gorgeous, music was great - really liked the atmosphere. The wait/bar staff were perfectly nice and did their best, but they were completely understaffed. We placed our food and drink order quickly. The drinks arrived after the food, so sat for 30mins with no word or update from anyone. The sides arrived after we had already finished our meal, we gave up on the extra gravy we asked for. The roast itself wasn't great - very little gravy, unseasoned boiled new potato's rather than roast or mashed as you would expect, and the yorkshire puddings were more like strange little cakes or muffins. We had planned to come here on their happy hour nights and check out the whole menu - it might be better on a quieter night, but I just don't think we'll be bothering trying it again. We didn't complain at the time, having worked in the service industry half my life I know it's not the waiters fault and nothing could be done that night, but after spending money (and my partners birthday night) on a useless evening - I needed to vent.",1.0
"I never thought I would be the angry disgruntled customer who would actually walk out of an establishment due to poor service... Well there's a first time for everything! Came in and expected a pretty uneventful evening with great food... What I got was a headache and a level of annoyance I still can't shake off. My waitress was nice enough. We ordered drinks, appetizers and food right away as we had waited about 15 minutes before anyone even came to our table. We Put in the orders and we wait... We wait some more, and then we wait a bit more... Here is where I get aggravated when we walked in there was no one else in the restaurant and we put our orders in before the other patrons started staggering in. As we wait, and wait and wait... We begin to notice everyone else is getting their food except us! While our waitress struggles at the kiosk. Ok... Let me ask... Ummm excuse me miss where is my burger? You ordered it well done so it takes a long time! A long time? Are you burning it to hell? It's been over 40 minutes! Not to mention everyone else has gotten food! Then the manager comes by and almost scolds me because I'm at a restaurant and I'm hungry and I haven't gotten my food yet... Can you imagine that!? She also gives me the very lame excuse that the burger needs to be cooked to hell because I ordered it well done. At this point it's been an hour and another burger flys by for someone who isn't me! So I decide to jump ship too! Just say that you forgot to put in my order and maybe offer something else in the meantime while I wait... I think that's called proper customer service! Won't ever be back sorry that's just not the way to treat someone. Oh and the appetizer I had was awful! One octopus tentacle for 14 bucks with some horseradish sauce?! Nah... no way doesn't work!",1.0
"Today's experience was very disappointing.  I've been to Black Swan more times than I can count since they opened a few years back.  I've come for brunch. I've come for happy hour, both food and drinks. I've come for late night drinks and/or eats. I've come for proper dinners.  I've come with new friends and old. Today I came for a beer and a burger. I waited a good ten minutes to order. This is after I was given a menu, after five minutes of sitting at the bar, and told that ""[she]'ll be right with me.""! She wasn't right with me. Eventually I was giving the eye and another woman responded to me.  She wasn't pleasant either, but not early ride, so okay. I then waiting another 30 minutes for my burger and fries. A few other orders came out before mine even though I had ordered first. Perhaps the second bartender did not put in my order right away?Either way, when I got the burger. The bun practically crumbled away. Disappointing. I love, love black swan. I rave about it. I write about it in other reviews when the situation calls for it. But tonight has me remembering the other restaurants I've forgone, for Black Swan, when caving burgers. I'll be back, sure, but not as my go to.  There are so many restaurants and bars in Bedstuy now, that now is the time to get better, not worse.",3.0
"BEST bloody Mary's in Brooklyn. Possibly even NYC. Whether it's for brunch or a late night bender, anytime is a good time for a Bloody Swan. The menu is pretty interesting--it's like British cuisine meets the South. The food is usually pretty good but there are certain items I wouldn't order again. For example, the duck crumpets we ordered today looked amazing but had a funny taste to it. But love the full English and the chicken & waffles and lobster Mac & cheese and rum French toast! Staff is super friendly and chill. The dining area's in the back and there's a bar with TVs for sports fans in the front.",4.0

The chicken and waffles is really good!  The steak is a decent size for brunch which I like.  I absolutely loved the crumpets!  The service...not so great.  I truly believe our waitress forgot to put in our order.   Everyone around us received their orders first even though the place was empty when my party got there.  One table close to us ate and left and the next party after them STILL got their food before us.,3.0
Some of the items need some improvements but other than that very good quality food. Amazing serving and attentive staff. cocktails rock!!!,4.0

"Came in on a Sunday evening around 830, bar was packed with what seems to be with locals. Bartenders were extremely attentive, personable, and worked quickly. I was only at the bar for ten minutes before my party of 1 joined me.Seating area had a few patrons, very dimly lit, borderline intimate setting. Waitress was also attentive, unfortunately she was the only one working the floor.-After getting over the fact they had no honey jack daniels, I ordered honey whiskey only to find out bartender ran out of it. Ordered a whisky sour, and it tasted like it had honey in it?! Still good.-Ordered the lobster mac and cheese or shall I call it crack and cheese. (Be mindful that the mac and cheese itself is $10, and adding bacon is an additional $3, adding additional lobster is $12. So in actuality the lobster mac and cheese was $22) I can see people getting this confused especially since our Math system in NYC has failed us.THOROUGHLY enjoyed everything here, want to return before actually giving them 5 stars, especially since I wasn't blown away by the whiskey sour, but that crack n cheese tho...EVERYTHING!",4.0

"I just moved to the neighborhood and was excited to try this place out! I kept hearing about it and the only thing i regret is not visiting earlier on - this place is GREAT! Upon arrival, there was a nice hostess/Dj (the music was NOT obnoxiously loud - the acoustics in that place was just amazingly perfect)  and the bar was to your right. You would think that was it, but when you continue to look in front of you, the restaurant still unfolds into a much bigger and beautiful space. The staff was very friendly and attentive. Huge credit to both the bartender(Terry) and the manager of the night (Doris)...they welcomed me with big smiles and a great atmosphere, another big reason why I would definitely return over and over again. Terry made his drinks perfectly (be careful - they are too perfect and you may order more than you originally planned.) He had great knowledge about the menu and informed me on some pretty good menu combo/specials - thanks. Im looking forward to their brunch menu and can't wait to try it (i've already invited my sister/friends to join me - definitely this weekend.and oh my godddddddddddd (eyes rolling to back of head), their brussel sprouts...girrrrrllllll:) Thank you guys so much - this place is just amazing:)",5.0
"Went with a last minute large group on a saturday night and was seated immediately. The service was good but the drinks were crazy strong and my Cornish hen dish was dry and flavorless.

The late night menu is limited but there are some good choices. They also have daily specials. We kept it simple by just ordering some buffalo wings and fries to share. We wanted the white sangria but there was no more left so we got Moscato which is $5 on happy hour. We were very content with the food. The bartender was very kind and so was the manager.

"This spot has been on our list to check out for a while now, and we were able to check it off our list with the aid of a Groupon last weekend. We ordered the Pulled Pork Puff Pastry as a starter and I had a Burger while the lady had the Mussels. The service seemed to be a little on the shower end from the beginning as there appeared to be one man waiting and one woman hosting/running food. All of our food came out together, which was disappointing. My Burger (Medium) was extremely charred on the outside, to the point that it was pretty much burnt, but still medium on the inside. The Sautéed onions appeared to be just pulled from the fridge and plopped in to because they were ice cold! With no waiter coming to check in on things in sight, I was starving and powered through as much as I could. The bun fell apart and it all ended up in a mess on my plate. The Mussels got a better review, but appeared to be cooked separately from the soup as the ones on top lacked the flavor. The Puff Pastries were OK, but weren't able to be enjoyed on their own since they came out with the entrees.Overall we had a disappointing experience, no issues redeeming the Groupon, but won't be rushing to come back dinner/food.",3.0
Mac and cheese here is delicious. I really needed a big gooey cheese pile and this was perfect. The bacon Mac and cheese had a generous amount of beautiful gooey cheese on top. Really hit the spot. Side note: The service is kind of weird. Very slow. Worth it for the Mac and cheese I would say.,4.0
I really enjoyed my time spent at Black Swan. Love the set up...u walk in pass the bar then the seating is in the back . There's also a private section for parties as well .

Had the lobster Mac and cheese ...very good..on the cheesy side.its on the menu as a small plate/ appetizer I guess  bt nothing small about the price .$22 bt so worth it.  But then again it's lobster so that explains it ! Also tried the salmon ..nicely done ! My hubby had the beer battered fish and chips..said u can actually taste the beer..Servings are well proportioned ..had to ask for a take out tray ...we were stuffed!

"A couple days ago, I unwittingly walked into the middle of a conversation on how to foil the rigid stoicism of a Beefeater.  This possibly was the universe's way of telling me to hurry up and write my review of this English pub, sitting itself unsuspecting in the middle of the Bedford-Sty, lest I not be able to tell as colorful of a story as the one I entered about the Queen's guards.Friends who lived nearby swore by the food and drink here, and arriving for brunch on Saturday we entered a full restaurant.  They did somehow manage to squeeze everyone in, and we were seated without a wait.They have a full bar and all your usual brunch suspects for beverages (mimosas, bellinis) and other fancier drinks.  The bloody mary (a ""bloody swan"" here) came highly recommended (gruesome imagery aside), so I tried that one.  Conclusion: it was good (served with shrimp, cheese, sausage) but I am still very much a girly-drink person.  If you like bloody marys you'll probably enjoy this one.Food:They serve dinner here too but I thought the variety here was perfect for brunch.  It's a mix of southern comfort food with English pub classics.  Items on the menu that looked great:  Full English, mac n cheese(was told its really good and you can add stuff to it too), Eggs Benedict, kale salad, black swan burger.  I went with the Chicken 'n' waffles...always hard to pass up when its offered.  The chicken?  Perfect...some of the best friend chicken I remember.  The waffle?  Eh, a little limp.  No problem though, because the whole thing was covered with whipped cream and maple syrup.  Slice off a piece of chicken with your waffle, dip the whole thing in syrup, slather in whipped cream and prepare yourself for a long walk back to the subway (at the corner but feeling far far away:).I'm told its a fun chill place to come for dinner and drinks, and for brunch seemed to attract a lot of people from the neighborhood.",4.0
I am giving 2 stars because my food was edible and taking off 3 because I was charged $26 for a tiny non flavorful mac and cheese with lobster and sun dried tomatoes. $2 for tomatoes and $12 for lobster.

"Food is not great. The English breakfast is sort of ridiculous. Comes with chicken sausage. The beans are gross. The potatoes sloppy. The toast underdone. No bother, you can find bar type things that are acceptable to eat. The wings. The fries. Mac and cheese. Fish and chips. Treat this like an Applebee's and you will be happy. But it's friendly, the beer selection is excellent and it serves as a totally acceptable bar. Come here to drink and hang out. Not to eat. I would rebrand this as a regular bar and ditch the English thing. It's not really coming through anymore.",3.0
"This Tasty gastropub (lol which autocorrected into gastrointestinal...also fitting) in the neighborhood was our Saturday brunch adventure today. Great friendly service, liked the dark pub vibe (especially at 10am on a rainy Saturday), cozy booth to sit and eat with friends.My wife got the eggs Benny - really tasty, or so she says because I was unable to get a fork in on her plate, it was gone so fast! They did a deep-fry on the hashbrowns so they almost looked like fritters. Again, I heard they were tasty...not bitter I couldn't have any. Not at all.

"I'm an original brooklynite. I grew up one block north of Black Swan. Some of the changes in this neighborhood aren't so easy to swallow. Black swan stands as one addition that's awesome to experience time and time again. We went for brunch. I felt like a classic mixture of breakfast and lunch. No better way than chicken and waffles. The waffle was nicely done. Crispy on the outside, fluffy and airy on the inside. The chicken was boneless and fried well. The waffle was topped with a pleasant and light whipped cream. I'm not used to my chicken having a sweet element to it, however these married well together. Like no socks and skinny jeans. My girls (yes, I had two dates. They won't read this review so let me act as if I was entertaining the attention of two ladies rather than one being a platonic friend. I don't come and ruin your reviews. Let me be great). Ordered the two eggs any style breakfast and the Rum French toast respectively. The French toast is made with what I believe is the most awesome breakfast pastry created. The buttery flaky croissant. So imagine the flaky goodness of a croissant, dipped in egg wash, fried in butter, topped with unicorn tears and caramel goodness. Definitely a great spot.",4.0

"I've been here a couple times and it is an absolute neighborhood gem. The food is pretty good.

"The only reason I am even giving this place one out of five is because of the food. Alas, food can not save a place. Lets start at the beginning...The hostess- The hostess sets the tone for your dining experience. The one here had an attitude. You shouldn't show that to customers. Keep your personal issues at home. Rolling your eyes and sighing when a customer tells you that they'll need a table for 4 instead of 3 isn't a sufficient reason to have an attitude. The waiter- Andrew started off nice enough. He took our drink and food order. Too bad he didn't remain that way. He checked on our table once. One time the whole brunch. When we were paying at the end, Andrew was quick to tell the person in our group who was paying by card that he can count. She was simply trying to explain the breakdown to him. She was not rude, therefor he shouldn't have been either. The service- Our entrées, drinks and appetizers all came out at the same time. The booths are small and uncomfortable. These are things I can over look if the service and food are good. The food was delicious. That is the one thing I will not take away from them. That is the only thing I can say good about them. There was also another man there. Perhaps he was the manager or owner.  When we stopped him for the check, he seemed as if he was also annoyed. How can one be annoyed about someone wanting you pay you for piss poor service, I could not understand. Because we have manners and class, my friends and I still left a 15% tip. We should not have. I will not be going here again, nor will I recommend this place to anyone. A shame since the food is delicious.",1.0
This place has seriously good food but seriously bad service. I've come a couple of times since my last review and even though the food was dreamy both times they had one girl waiting tables which proved to be too much for her to handle. We were out of water the entire time even after asking for it twice.  The coffee is teeny tiny and hard to come by. However the food is great and worth the wait time and time again. Just don't have plans for the rest of the day if you dine in. Bravo on delivering through Seamless now also!,4.0
Hadn't been here in a while because our last experience was meh and the choices in the neighborhood have expanded. We were pleasantly surprised at how much better the food was than the last time we were here. The wings were quite good. They had a vegetable chowder which was really great and the bowl was big enough for a meal! The burger continues to be good but they also have a chicken sandwich which was delicious. The beer list on their website isn't necessarily up to date but the selection is still large. Black Swan is going back on the regular rotation!,4.0

"Upon entering the establishment, I noticed one thing.. It is DARK and DANK, so if you're in the mood to fall asleep in your food or you're a vampire, this is a perfect place for you. I was waiting for girlfriends at the bar so I decided to have a libation. It took a solid 7 minutes to receive my sidecar. The female bartender asked the male bartender to make the drink but didn't so she made it for me. The cocktail was good. When my girlfriends arrived we asked to be seated for 3 but then stated that one more person would be joining us. The hostess exhaled and rolled her eyes. Nice. First of all, the bench seating is most definitely NOT wide enough for you to sit comfortably. I've been sitting here with pins and needles running through my legs and toes and well as a numb rear-end. The table was sticky and the silverware had greasy smudge marks. Gross. Second, Andrew, our server.. A little bit of a space cadet but sweet. He took our drink and food order at the same time. Our drinks, apps and food came out at the same damn time. What is that about?! The table is small so we had to pile the plates on top of each other. The food was just eh. I played it safe with a burger and salad. The dressing was yummy. Lemony and vinegary. Long story short, we asked some dude wearing ""manager attire"" for our check because Andrew was MIA.. 10 minutes later, he came back. My girlfriend goes to pay the bill up front because we were totally over this place. Andrew was up front.. She gave him the check with the money inside of the leather binder and said ""you should count the money"" (just to make sure we were square) Drew replied with ""I can count"". I'll neverrrrrrrr everrrrrrr everrrrrrrrrrr go to this dungeon again.",1.0

"Absolutely awful experience. Ordered a burger medium rare and it came out well done, 30 mins later. When I asked the kitchen, they promised to do it again and bring it out. I didn't ask for a 2nd burger, but they had offered. Waited another 30 mins, the burger never came out. Got charged for the full price of the burger at the end of the night.

"I lived in Bed Sty back in '98 to 2005. Those were different times, to say the least. There were many reasons I left, one of them being places like this didn't exist and I wanted to live in a hood that had more options, plus I couldn't wait anymore for the hood to turn over; a decade later, it has...It's the kind of spot you want and need in your hood. Yeah, i want to drink on a tuesday till 4 am, but more importantly, I might need some grub at that time too without haveng to Uber over to Douecheburg. I had fries. Yeah, I know...I might be the douche. But, they were good man. Next time, I'll hook up the rest of the menu. Eclectic crowd, check. Pub feel, check. Interesting items on the menu that you will either love or regret ordering? Check. Attentive bartenders who know how to make a proper drink? Double check. Good chance getting a yellow cab off Bedford, because all the cabbies are bringing the drunks back to BK from the city at 4 am or they are just starting their shifts? Tripple check. Boo Yow!What else do you need?",4.0
"Walked in and immediately loved the set up. Bar in front, tables in back. Tables were too small though. I had to eventually stretch my legs after sitting almost nose to nose with my friend across the table lol. I ordered the bloody swan because it sounded interesting. Guess I'm not a fan but I did nibble on the garnishes (olive, shrimp, mini pickle...) . It comes with a little beer chaser. I had the macaroni with jalapeños and bacon and it was pretty good. Tried the calamari...also good. Took a little long for my food because I believe they forgot me lol. It's ok though. I'd try them again",4.0
"This really is a decent pub and not a bad place to live a block away from. Call your order in and walk down to get some yummy jerk chicken wings or come in for brunch and strike up a conversation with other folks at the bar.  Overall, it's a great neighborhood spot.I was surprised when some tourists stopped me on the G train platform and asked for directions to Black Swan. They said the place on their hit list of restaurants. Go 'head Black Swan, getting international recognition. The service has been decent, but sometime sit can be somewhat slow. I think they forgot about me during my first visit. However, when I spoke up and said ""yo, where's my food?!?"", they hustle on it. You might not be impressed from the outside and there's a KFC right next door, but likely won't be disappointed if you go inside and check it out. Drinks and food aren't too shabby.",4.0
I came here especially for the full English breakfast... I am British and I haven't had a full English for a long time. Unfortunately it was possibly the worst food I have ever had! It came out in roughly 2 mins!  The sausage must have been a few days old. The smallest piece of bacon! The beans were absolutely disgusting! Luckily they have a friendly bartender called Phil...otherwise I would have left 0 stars ! Very disappointed !,2.0
"Living in the neighborhood, Black Swan is a great go-to when you don't feel like cooking.  I have not had a single menu item that I didn't like yet. This is going to sound skinnyb*tch, but trust me, I'm not one: their salads are uhhmazzing. So generous and fresh. I've had all three and would rate them in this order: country salad (candied pecans, goat cheese and balsamic vinaigrette, add chicken); chop salad (you already know what's in a chop salad), and THEN the kale Caesar, because it's just a little bland compared to the other two.On the less healthy side, their burgers are fantastic: big and juicy with your choice of sweet potato or regular fries, or salad. There's no wrong choice, but you won't be sorry if you choose sweet potato fries, just sayin'. Brunch is lovely, and should be started with a Bloody Swan. That bad boy has a shrimp, a pickle, an onion, a cube of cheese AND a slice of bacon, and it comes with a beer chaser. Bravo, Black Swan. If that's not enough, I always order anything Benedict; you can't go wrong with Benedict.",5.0
The food use to be good. They food is stale and cold. The last time I came the restaurant smelled like a fish market very stink I had to leave after 15 mins. The drinks are bad and over price for them to be no name brand liquor.,3.0

I had loved black swan before this, but this experience just wrecked it all.",1.0
"I had a lovely time at Black Swan!Our waitress Miriam was amazing!She was very attentive and wonderful!She suggested their beverage The New Yorker to my friends and I, and they loved it! (I had a bottle of wine since it was 1/2 price on wine!) I definitely plan to come back and see her againShe's such a sweet heart!",5.0
"I lived in Bed Sty back in '98 to 2005. Those were different times, to say the least. There were many reasons I left, one of them being places like this didn't exist and I wanted to live in a hood that had more options, plus I couldn't wait anymore for the hood to turn over; a decade later, it has...It's the kind of spot you want and need in your hood. Yeah, i want to drink on a tuesday till 4 am, but more importantly, I might need some grub at that time too without haveng to Uber over to Douecheburg. I had fries. Yeah, I know...I might be the douche. But, they were good man. Next time, I'll hook up the rest of the menu. Eclectic crowd, check. Pub feel, check. Interesting items on the menu that you will either love or regret ordering? Check. Attentive bartenders who know how to make a proper drink? Double check. Good chance getting a yellow cab off Bedford, because all the cabbies are bringing the drunks back to BK from the city at 4 am or they are just starting their shifts? Tripple check. Boo Yow!What else do you need?",4.0
"Walked in and immediately loved the set up. Bar in front, tables in back. Tables were too small though. I had to eventually stretch my legs after sitting almost nose to nose with my friend across the table lol. I ordered the bloody swan because it sounded interesting. Guess I'm not a fan but I did nibble on the garnishes (olive, shrimp, mini pickle...) . It comes with a little beer chaser. I had the macaroni with jalapeños and bacon and it was pretty good. Tried the calamari...also good. Took a little long for my food because I believe they forgot me lol. It's ok though. I'd try them again",4.0
"This really is a decent pub and not a bad place to live a block away from. Call your order in and walk down to get some yummy jerk chicken wings or come in for brunch and strike up a conversation with other folks at the bar.  Overall, it's a great neighborhood spot.I was surprised when some tourists stopped me on the G train platform and asked for directions to Black Swan. They said the place on their hit list of restaurants. Go 'head Black Swan, getting international recognition. The service has been decent, but sometime sit can be somewhat slow. I think they forgot about me during my first visit. However, when I spoke up and said ""yo, where's my food?!?"", they hustle on it. You might not be impressed from the outside and there's a KFC right next door, but likely won't be disappointed if you go inside and check it out. Drinks and food aren't too shabby.",4.0
I came here especially for the full English breakfast... I am British and I haven't had a full English for a long time. Unfortunately it was possibly the worst food I have ever had! It came out in roughly 2 mins!  The sausage must have been a few days old. The smallest piece of bacon! The beans were absolutely disgusting! Luckily they have a friendly bartender called Phil...otherwise I would have left 0 stars ! Very disappointed !,2.0
"Living in the neighborhood, Black Swan is a great go-to when you don't feel like cooking.  I have not had a single menu item that I didn't like yet. This is going to sound skinnyb*tch, but trust me, I'm not one: their salads are uhhmazzing. So generous and fresh. I've had all three and would rate them in this order: country salad (candied pecans, goat cheese and balsamic vinaigrette, add chicken); chop salad (you already know what's in a chop salad), and THEN the kale Caesar, because it's just a little bland compared to the other two.On the less healthy side, their burgers are fantastic: big and juicy with your choice of sweet potato or regular fries, or salad. There's no wrong choice, but you won't be sorry if you choose sweet potato fries, just sayin'. Brunch is lovely, and should be started with a Bloody Swan. That bad boy has a shrimp, a pickle, an onion, a cube of cheese AND a slice of bacon, and it comes with a beer chaser. Bravo, Black Swan. If that's not enough, I always order anything Benedict; you can't go wrong with Benedict.",5.0
The food use to be good. They food is stale and cold. The last time I came the restaurant smelled like a fish market very stink I had to leave after 15 mins. The drinks are bad and over price for them to be no name brand liquor.,3.0
"Had no urge to last cook last night after a long week. Yelped 'mac & cheese' and this place came up. Some reviews are quite horrible but management must've read them and took into account the complaints because our service was FANTASTIC!!! We went during happy hour on last night(10/9/15) and everyone on the floor was amazing, especially our super attentive waitress Ida (Hey Ida!! Great work!!) The bussers, food runners and hostess were all pleasant and on top of their jobs. Not one empty cup/plate stayed on the table more than 30 seconds.The happy hour drinks were great!! $5 well/wine and so was the mac&cheese. I had it plain but I'm going for lobster or bacon next time around. Great flavor throughout the dish!! The fish fry was good. A little bit too heavily battered on the fried fish part of the dish. If tasted like a upscale version of a fish stick because the fish was fresh but the density of batter was a lot for my taste last night.But I have zero complaints! We'llbe back! Thanks guys!",5.0
"Went to Brunch Here and ordered the Chicken and Waffles. The chicken was good but the waffle, served with imitation corn maple syrup. was worse than what they serve in bad college cafeterias. looking at my friends dishes I'm sure i would not have fared any better.Definitely would not be upset if i never came here again.

"British pub feel-- wood furnishings and dim lighting. There is a nice bar area at the front and additional seating in the back. I had the Portobello Burger with French fries, which is a giant grilled portobello mushroom with grilled onions on a brioche bun with lettuce tomato and blue cheese. The burger and fries were tasty and came out pretty quickly, but the burger itself was a little messy to eat. My meal was $15 with a tip. The service was good and my waitress was nice. They also have drink specials every night which I thought was very cool. I was a little disappointed with their dessert selection so I did not order anything but overall I liked Black Swan.",4.0
"One random Tuesday night my friend and I stumbled into this place ravenous. The oatmeal I consumed at 9am was long gone and nothing but water had hit my stomach all day. I was ready for some sustenance. Looking at the menu the 1st thing that my eyes saw was the BYO burger option. I ordered it w/ an egg, avocado and fries. My friend got the black swan burger. So although I was starving I believe it was one of the best burgers I've had regardless. It was made just right. We basically inhaled our burgers and fries in complete silence. Once I was satisfied I actually looked around and thought the decor was a bit dark which I like. The service was excellent... this I know b/c when you're hungry and things are messed up it's 10x's worst.I will definitely come back and try that steak & Guinness pie and brunch.",4.0
Went here on a brunch date to watch soccer and for bloody Mary's. The date was very happy they were able to play the soccer match he wanted to see. The eggs Benedict were good! Bloody Mary's were better. I will be back for another Bloody Swan!,4.0
"Guys, let me tell you about this Bloody Mary. I know there are approximately 134 other reviews that have already tried to tell you about this Bloody Mary - but they did not do it justice. Yea, it comes garnished with cheese and a grilled shrimp and an olive and pepper and a slice of freaking bacon (BACON, guys.) And yes, it comes with a mini beer chaser on the side. And yes it's filling enough that you can drink two, add a side of grits and call that brunch for twenty five bucks. But, this Bloody Mary is so good. It's spicy, its horseradishy, it's bright with a squeeze of lemon. It's the best Bloody Mary ever.I used to date a guy who lived across the street (uh, sorry for being a terrible person, AP!) and we'd stop by at least once a week for brunch or for drinks. They have pretty solid drink specials - I especially enjoyed the rotating beer/shot deals. For $7 you get a beer and either whiskey, tequila or vodka. Yum. Cocktails are good too, although at twelve bucks a pop they're pretty pricey for the neighborhood. Stick to the brunch and the cheap liquor and you'll be happy.Food is good, service is good, Bloody Mary is epic. Go.",4.0

This was done purposefully because it was very obvious to my table and probably everyone else's. Their racist seating and attempt to hide black patrons spoiled my meal and humiliated us all.Shame on Black Swan.

"I cannot imagine life without the b.y.o.burger, medium rare with sauteed onions and cheddar, or the mac and cheese with bacon and siracha.

Not only is the food amazing every single time, but the servers are super friendly and welcoming. They seem to enjoy the place and each other which is certainly a plus. Of course, I can't forget that it is also a bar. The beer on tap and in bottle are varied and delicious. If you are unsure of what you want, ask the folks behind the bar. Not only do they know the menu but are willing to give you a sample to make sure you will enjoy it. Try to keep the beer menu if you like to taste around while you're there.

Maybe if I was drunk I wouldn't care but I drove here just for food cause their open and close. Next time I will drive further away for some late night food. I think if the kitchen is open then you should cook the food fresh. Fry or bake, whatever but when you start to out out not good food that's a no no. The beer was good tho!",2.0
Just finished having brunch with my daughter at Black Swan because I love their food. I am a neighborhood resident who has been patronizing this establishment since they first opened. To my dismay I just received the worst NY Strip steak which I asked for MEDIUM. IT WAS PRACTICALLY  raw! The worst part is it was 26 damn dollars. I also ordered eggs soft and received them medium to well done and the tasted powdered. I was offered to have the chef make the dish over but I declined. I must say I was quite DISAPPOINTED. Probably won't be back. The thing is the waitress was average and my bill was 75 dollars and I didn't even eat my food! UNBELIEVABLE BLACK SWAN.... JUST UNBELIEVABLE Shawn B,1.0
"I love black swan partially. The food is great (most of the times) but the service is shameful. I went in there at 6pm and it was a dead zone.

Except I look over and there are not one BUT TWO parties of 2 comfortably seated on booths. This was a huge slap in the face. Sat down upset but hungry and ready to eat. Waitor took FOREVER to get to our table so we ended up walking out. The restaurant was not the least bit busy and not one person was waiting to be seated. There is no reason a client who frequents black swan and orders take out ATLEAST 3 times a week should have been made feel uncomfortable and u satisfied with the service. Unfortunately I will not be returning. Bye bye Mac and cheese its been swell. Black swan you will no longer get my hard earned money.",2.0
"In short: Terrible slow service, nice ambiance, sub par over-priced food. I recommend spending your money and time somewhere else. It took an hour for them to make 5 medium rare burgers. An hour? Lol that's so ridiculous on so many levels. Not only that, I asked for raw onion on my burger and got charged $1.50! Matthew, our waiter, should have mentioned that a piece of white onion (standard fixing for a burger in my opinion) would be an up charge of $1.50, it's a slice of onion not truffle butter or some shit. AN ONION  Not only that but I finished my burger before I got any mustard. My friend asked for caramelized onions on her burger and never got them.Multiple times throughout the meal I had to wait for coffee and water. Seeing as I've been in a server's shoes before I understand things can be hectic but you have to acknowledge your guests' needs otherwise don't serve food. Just laughably bad service, one humongous shit show. I think the worst part of it all is that as he dropped the bill he said ""have a good day ladies"" to a group of 4 women and A MAN. Open your eyes dude, show some respect and learn how to do your job better. So done with over-priced food and slow service. Leaving Black Swan feeling pissed the fuck off.",1.0
Black Swan is a great pub to meet up with friends and my go-to place to bring visiting family. It never disappoints. The service is great and the beer selection is good & constantly rotating - their house cocktails are always very interesting too! My boyfriend loves the full English breakfast - I usually opt for a burger and fries (huge!) or the rum french toast to satisfy my sweet tooth. The only weird thing that ever happened here was that my debit-card information got stolen immediately after dining here this past summer - I emailed the owner and he gave a prompt apology & remedied the situation. He even offered to comp me a meal and drink. I still have yet to come here during a weekday for one of their nightly specials - the Prosecco & grilled cheese night certainly catches my eye!,4.0

"My friends and I had quite the negative experience at this institution, and I will not be returning, nor recommending this business to others.  As a former service-industry employee for a number of businesses during my school years, I have a great deal of respect for the values and culture of an industry which strives to provide quality service and a pleasant environment to the customer in exchange for that customer's hard-earned dollar.  I work hard during the week, and expect when I choose to attend an institution to relax in my recreational time that there will be, at the bare minimum, a mutual level of respect between both the two parties, regardless of the perceived qualities of the product provided.  The age-old cliché may well be just that: a cliché.  But the customer is indeed (almost) always right.  The management of this institution treated my friends and I poorly over a dispute relating to the bill, and forced us to wait in patient aggravation while they continuously challenged our version of a mundane exchange which had caused us to be over-charged a non-negligible sum.  In short, the management treated us as if we were trying to cheat the restaurant out of its money.  I have not felt so disrespected at a business in some time, if ever.  If the management is short-sighted to the degree that it is willing to antagonize a group of customers who has just spent over 5 hours and a good sum of money on their food and beverages--and who have all promised to return to the restaurant and its sister institution--over the price of a few beers, then so be it.  That is the institution's prerogative, and in my opinion, a poor business decision.Quite an unfortunate experience over all.",1.0

"Great for late night food, as they are open until 4 (1 star)Also, they open at 11:30 am They have good fries, always fresh.

I chose to come here one day b/c I had been here once before and the wings were so good I came back. They have specials everyday. We went on a Thursday so the special was 6$ margaritas and 4$ tacos.

The service was not so good but we didn't really want to bothered anyway and the food surpassed any terrible service. Definitely would recommend to anyone.

"My friends and I had quite the negative experience at this institution, and I will not be returning, nor recommending this business to others.  As a former service-industry employee for a number of businesses during my school years, I have a great deal of respect for the values and culture of an industry which strives to provide quality service and a pleasant environment to the customer in exchange for that customer's hard-earned dollar.  I work hard during the week, and expect when I choose to attend an institution to relax in my recreational time that there will be, at the bare minimum, a mutual level of respect between both the two parties, regardless of the perceived qualities of the product provided.  The age-old cliché may well be just that: a cliché.  But the customer is indeed (almost) always right.  The management of this institution treated my friends and I poorly over a dispute relating to the bill, and forced us to wait in patient aggravation while they continuously challenged our version of a mundane exchange which had caused us to be over-charged a non-negligible sum.  In short, the management treated us as if we were trying to cheat the restaurant out of its money.  I have not felt so disrespected at a business in some time, if ever.  If the management is short-sighted to the degree that it is willing to antagonize a group of customers who has just spent over 5 hours and a good sum of money on their food and beverages--and who have all promised to return to the restaurant and its sister institution--over the price of a few beers, then so be it.  That is the institution's prerogative, and in my opinion, a poor business decision.Quite an unfortunate experience over all.",1.0
"Went there on a Friday night as a pre-clubbing stop. Only went to the bar section to get some drinks and something to eat. Chill atmosphere, good selection of drinks.

"This was my second time at Black Swan and I was, once again, not disappointed. Last time I had the lobster sandwich with fried pork and a fried egg which I washed down with cider. Fast forward months later to today when I had a ""Build Your Own Burger"" with goat cheese and bacon on a poppy seed brioche bun that came with heavenly sweet potato fries. This was after I had started my appetizer (umm I mean drink): The Bloody Swan. This creation included a skewer of lemon wedge, pepper jack cheese cube, and green olive across the top with a surprise inside: a crispy bacon strip. This liquid meal also came with a beer chaser. All of this, in addition to attentive staff and a full belly, was well worth $30.",4.0
"This has become the spot we take out of town guests to because it's delicious! First, the space is 100% accessible. NO stairs, front door is often open (when it's warmish) and the path to the dining area is wide enough to fit a chair, and patrons at bar are usually decent enough to move chairs if more space is needed.Next, the vibe is great. You walk in and hit the bar first, folks sit here to watch games or shows, chat, eat, and drink. The dining area is farther towards the back. They've added tables to the left side of the path towards the larger dining hall. These are bar stools with short tables for 2. The dining room is all the way in the back with three rows of seating: on the left are seats for parties of 2, in the center a large picnic style table and bench, the right booths. Towards the back is  more seating with an ""outdoor"" feel with natural light but it's not outside. We always come for brunch if we can. The chicken and waffles are amazing. They use boneless chicken breast and a yummy batter. The meat is so juicy. The waffle is never burnt or overdone so its' soft, comes with heavy whipped cream and syrup. We also love the rum french toast with caramelized bananas. The name says all you need to know. We also have had the egg, bacon, potato, and salad which is great as well. The potato's are really well made. Burgers are great, made to order, great buns, very filling and shoestring fries. They have specialty drinks from the UK, like sodas, they also have ciders that are seasonal such as pumpkin cider. Full bar with drink specials and happy hour all day until 8pm!There is one bathroom with one stall. The sink is outside the bathroom. The door swings inward and the space is very wide and accessible.",5.0
"I've been to the Black Swan twice and both times had horrendous service.  The first time there were four of us and we had to track down our waiter to order a second drink after we'd sat there for 20 minutes with empty glasses.  Then when he gave us our check he disappeared for a half hour and we ended up having to settle up with the hostess.  Last night, my friend and I sat at the center of the bar and asked each other twice ""are we invisible?""  We were not offered a drink for at least 15 minutes though we tried rigorously to make eye contact with the two bartenders working, who by the way were not at all in the weeds.  One of the bartenders seemed more interested in running his hands through his hair and beard (gross!) than tending to his customers.  He seemed annoyed that he even had customers.  The continuous waiting and neglect lasted the whole time, and he never checked in with us to see how our  food was, and we had to ask a passing waitress for utensils as he did not bother to give us a set up when we ordered.  The three stars are for the food and drinks, which were tasty, but I will not be going back there again after these two experiences of rude and disinterested service.",3.0
"This place is right on the corner of my place and I've been going here for about 3 years now. It's always been very consistent on its food quality and service. That was until a couple months back. I'm not sure if I'm just the unluckiest mf ever or if they really don't care about their costumers anymore but I have had bad experiences, repeatedly, in my last 3 visits. First I bring a friend from out of town to have dinner with me and my wife since we used to love the place. We got moldy bread with our mussels and my ""well done"" was practically alive still. I didn't care so much seems I knew that place was consistent and mistakes can happen.The first time I returned after that, my meal was over 35 minutes late and the guy helping us didn't make anything better by making us stand, yes, STAND by the crowded hallway while being pushed by every single person that walked by us. After STANDING for 35 minutes I wen't to check on our food again and the idiot with the worst attitude tells us is about to be ready when I see they putting in the order. Just keep in mind that when I first got there, already 10 minutes passed the time for my food pick up(trying to give them time) he told me he was sorry for the delay and my food would be right out. Well, 35 minutes after my food was still anywhere but not with me. The experience was ruined by one asswhole that thinks playing with the girls and being the cool hispter is going to get him far. Maybe with those girls but defined not in life. The last time I went there, to have lunch by myself, i ordered two meals for myself since I can never decide between their burger or mac and cheese. Long story short, for my luck, the same guy was ""taking care"" of my table however in the more than 40 minutes wait for my meal, which came out wrong, he managed to break a plate and not apologize for a piece that hit my head. Instead he laughed at the table with girl and said: THIS IS WHAT I WANT TO DO ANYWAYS. This would be fine of he was still working but in these 45 minutes he only managed to get me one warm beer and forget about my second drink. When my food came, hooorayyy finally, sure enough it was wrong and my burger had to come back for the cheese. It took over 15 minutes for them to add the cheese to my burger. And it FINALLY came out again, it was all wrong. The worst part. I heard the kitchen calling him to. Bring me my food for at least 10 minutes while he was chatting at the bar. When he brought my food and I said it was all messed up and cold like a snowball he pretty much walked on me and started throwing thing on the ground and cursing, right in front of me.   At this point I was about to deal with him myself but I decided to simply walk away from the place. That loser isn't worth my time or energy. Another server did get my phone and said a manager would call me, since there was none there at the time. Two weeks went by and nothing. Needless to say, this place won't be getting any of mine or my friends money and I'll do everything I can to make sure everyone know how they treat a costumer that's been going there pretty much every week for 3 years. SHAME ON YOU, Sureshan Pather. I literally am right in between both of your restaurants and now will be taking my business elsewhere.",1.0

"If you've lived in or near the Bed-Stuy area for more than a week, then there should be no reason that Black Swan isn't already your spot. No seriously, no excuse. You should walk, run, or ride an ostrich to Black Swan, immediately. Bus or cab should work, too.Black Swan is an English Public House-themed restaurant on Bedford Ave, with a full menu and extensive beer selection. I have eaten here five or six times and I have been blown away each time. I confess that I have mostly been here for brunch (once for dinner - also awesome), so I speak more to the morning/afternoon ambience here, which I love. It is quiet but not too much so, the staff is polite and professional, and they hardly ever seem frantic even when it's super busy. Each time I visited Black Swan I sat at the bar and had the pleasure of meeting some of the Swan's awesome bartenders (I'm thinking specifically of Michael and Kaylee), who know the many beers on their menu and are quick to pique your interest with their recommendations.I haven't even mentioned the brunch menu yet, have I? THE BRUNCH MENU. Seriously, this brunch menu requires that you strap on your thinking cap and hunker down for a meal that matches your mood, cuz I tell ya, they got a dish for every occasion. So far I am three plates deep (English Breakfast any-style, Crab Benedict, and Black Swan burger), and each one made a swift departure from the plateware and into my belly. The English Breakfast is an absolute mind-boggler. It is so loaded with protein that (once you wake up from your two-hour nap) you'll feel ready to jack some lumber... or whatever it is that lumberjacks do.As for the drinks, there is something at Black Swan for every boozer. They have quite a few beers on taps (maybe 20?), many of which the bartender can describe with little hesitation. I myself am a fan of the Founder's Breakfast Stout, and they also have a chocolate Porter which is pretty nice. The Bloody Marys are pretty fancy and come with a garnish of shrimp, olive, vidalia onion, bacon, and asparagus. OH AND A BEER FLIGHT. I mean, that's a meal in and of itself.Perhaps you noticed that I have nothing but awesome things to say about Black Swan. That's because I have nothing but awesome things to say about Black Swan. It's not a cheap place, but neither is the experience. Top to bottom I am 100 percent satisfied every time I visit this place, and I think you will be, too.",5.0

"This was my second time at Black Swan and I was, once again, not disappointed. Last time I had the lobster sandwich with fried pork and a fried egg which I washed down with cider. Fast forward months later to today when I had a ""Build Your Own Burger"" with goat cheese and bacon on a poppy seed brioche bun that came with heavenly sweet potato fries. This was after I had started my appetizer (umm I mean drink): The Bloody Swan. This creation included a skewer of lemon wedge, pepper jack cheese cube, and green olive across the top with a surprise inside: a crispy bacon strip. This liquid meal also came with a beer chaser. All of this, in addition to attentive staff and a full belly, was well worth $30.",4.0
"This has become the spot we take out of town guests to because it's delicious! First, the space is 100% accessible. NO stairs, front door is often open (when it's warmish) and the path to the dining area is wide enough to fit a chair, and patrons at bar are usually decent enough to move chairs if more space is needed.Next, the vibe is great. You walk in and hit the bar first, folks sit here to watch games or shows, chat, eat, and drink. The dining area is farther towards the back. They've added tables to the left side of the path towards the larger dining hall. These are bar stools with short tables for 2. The dining room is all the way in the back with three rows of seating: on the left are seats for parties of 2, in the center a large picnic style table and bench, the right booths. Towards the back is  more seating with an ""outdoor"" feel with natural light but it's not outside. We always come for brunch if we can. The chicken and waffles are amazing. They use boneless chicken breast and a yummy batter. The meat is so juicy. The waffle is never burnt or overdone so its' soft, comes with heavy whipped cream and syrup. We also love the rum french toast with caramelized bananas. The name says all you need to know. We also have had the egg, bacon, potato, and salad which is great as well. The potato's are really well made. Burgers are great, made to order, great buns, very filling and shoestring fries. They have specialty drinks from the UK, like sodas, they also have ciders that are seasonal such as pumpkin cider. Full bar with drink specials and happy hour all day until 8pm!There is one bathroom with one stall. The sink is outside the bathroom. The door swings inward and the space is very wide and accessible.",5.0
"I've been to the Black Swan twice and both times had horrendous service.  The first time there were four of us and we had to track down our waiter to order a second drink after we'd sat there for 20 minutes with empty glasses.  Then when he gave us our check he disappeared for a half hour and we ended up having to settle up with the hostess.  Last night, my friend and I sat at the center of the bar and asked each other twice ""are we invisible?""  We were not offered a drink for at least 15 minutes though we tried rigorously to make eye contact with the two bartenders working, who by the way were not at all in the weeds.  One of the bartenders seemed more interested in running his hands through his hair and beard (gross!) than tending to his customers.  He seemed annoyed that he even had customers.  The continuous waiting and neglect lasted the whole time, and he never checked in with us to see how our  food was, and we had to ask a passing waitress for utensils as he did not bother to give us a set up when we ordered.  The three stars are for the food and drinks, which were tasty, but I will not be going back there again after these two experiences of rude and disinterested service.",3.0
"This place is right on the corner of my place and I've been going here for about 3 years now. It's always been very consistent on its food quality and service. That was until a couple months back. I'm not sure if I'm just the unluckiest mf ever or if they really don't care about their costumers anymore but I have had bad experiences, repeatedly, in my last 3 visits. First I bring a friend from out of town to have dinner with me and my wife since we used to love the place. We got moldy bread with our mussels and my ""well done"" was practically alive still. I didn't care so much seems I knew that place was consistent and mistakes can happen.The first time I returned after that, my meal was over 35 minutes late and the guy helping us didn't make anything better by making us stand, yes, STAND by the crowded hallway while being pushed by every single person that walked by us. After STANDING for 35 minutes I wen't to check on our food again and the idiot with the worst attitude tells us is about to be ready when I see they putting in the order. Just keep in mind that when I first got there, already 10 minutes passed the time for my food pick up(trying to give them time) he told me he was sorry for the delay and my food would be right out. Well, 35 minutes after my food was still anywhere but not with me. The experience was ruined by one asswhole that thinks playing with the girls and being the cool hispter is going to get him far. Maybe with those girls but defined not in life. The last time I went there, to have lunch by myself, i ordered two meals for myself since I can never decide between their burger or mac and cheese. Long story short, for my luck, the same guy was ""taking care"" of my table however in the more than 40 minutes wait for my meal, which came out wrong, he managed to break a plate and not apologize for a piece that hit my head. Instead he laughed at the table with girl and said: THIS IS WHAT I WANT TO DO ANYWAYS. This would be fine of he was still working but in these 45 minutes he only managed to get me one warm beer and forget about my second drink. When my food came, hooorayyy finally, sure enough it was wrong and my burger had to come back for the cheese. It took over 15 minutes for them to add the cheese to my burger. And it FINALLY came out again, it was all wrong. The worst part. I heard the kitchen calling him to. Bring me my food for at least 10 minutes while he was chatting at the bar. When he brought my food and I said it was all messed up and cold like a snowball he pretty much walked on me and started throwing thing on the ground and cursing, right in front of me.   At this point I was about to deal with him myself but I decided to simply walk away from the place. That loser isn't worth my time or energy. Another server did get my phone and said a manager would call me, since there was none there at the time. Two weeks went by and nothing. Needless to say, this place won't be getting any of mine or my friends money and I'll do everything I can to make sure everyone know how they treat a costumer that's been going there pretty much every week for 3 years. SHAME ON YOU, Sureshan Pather. I literally am right in between both of your restaurants and now will be taking my business elsewhere.",1.0

The food, though slightly expensive for what it is (2 burgers, 1 portobello burger, and 1 bear came to $48 pre-tip), was tasty enough though certainly not inventive, creative, or exciting.  For example, a portobello dressed with goat cheese and caramelized onions seemed to need just one more ingredient to give it a truly interesting taste. The burgers are oversized, and served on slightly sweet brioche rolls, with a choice of salad, regular fries or sweet potato fries (I'd go for the sweet potato fries).    I suppose if I judge Black Swan on its own merits, it's good enough.

"Came here for a bite to eat prior to a NYE party. It was billed as an English pub, so I couldn't help but order fish and chips, the the Guinness & steak pie.Fish was cooked really well, tasty, flaky, and succulent. It tended to separate from the batter, but that's the only thing I could say bad about it. Fries were standard shoe string, probably the store bought frozen variety, but again, cooked really well, crispy, warm, and lightly salted.The pie was also good. Beautiful, flaky crust on top, nice pieces of beef inside. Though I thought it was a tad under seasoned.Our server was Michelle, who was friendly, and although said she wasn't really knowledgeable about beer, steered me away from this ridiculously sweet porter, and even brought me a sample to bring the point home.Nice beer selection, great service, felt a lil cramped, but not uncomfortable.

Lots of horseradish, yummy yummy yummy.Also: they do other things well. - Great beer selection- Ridiculous and crazy steaming curried pot pie- Chicken and waffles - moist chicken, waffle isn't too heavy- Crab cake benedict is delicious- Banana Rum French toast. I mean, really.Staff is always helpful and great, back dining area is cozy and dark, and if you feel like hanging out bar-style, not an issue. Probably my favorite Bed-Stuy brunch.",4.0
"Amazing Bloody Mary (served all day and night!), beautiful space. I can't comment on the food because I didn't order food, but my friend got a burger with a fried egg on it and sweet potato fries. I can comment on the fries, they were delicious. Go here!",5.0
Great Thai wings and mac and cheese. I'm a bit disappointed that they don't carry Kwak anymore.,3.0
"It's possible that I'm just partial to gastropubs, but I have never had a negative experience at Black Swan. I've come here for lunch, dinner and late-night drinks here my fair share of times, and I've always been happy with the service & the quality of the food/drinks.I specifically recall receiving no less than excellent service during Hurricane Sandy, which was cool, 'cause like, what else was I gonna do that week?",5.0
I am not sure what happened to this place. It seems like the good fell off.   Every time i come here its getting worse.  The mac and cheese is horrible. Its just shell noodles with cheese on top. (Just the top) not in the middle of it . I have lived in the area my entire life and was happy when they opened. But the quality of the food has dropped so much this will prolly be my last time here.    I'll have to walk  down bedford av to some of the newer spots that have opened up,2.0
"Came here for a bite to eat prior to a NYE party. It was billed as an English pub, so I couldn't help but order fish and chips, the the Guinness & steak pie.Fish was cooked really well, tasty, flaky, and succulent. It tended to separate from the batter, but that's the only thing I could say bad about it. Fries were standard shoe string, probably the store bought frozen variety, but again, cooked really well, crispy, warm, and lightly salted.The pie was also good. Beautiful, flaky crust on top, nice pieces of beef inside. Though I thought it was a tad under seasoned.Our server was Michelle, who was friendly, and although said she wasn't really knowledgeable about beer, steered me away from this ridiculously sweet porter, and even brought me a sample to bring the point home.Nice beer selection, great service, felt a lil cramped, but not uncomfortable. I will def be back, and would recommend to others.",4.0
"Giving it three stars, mainly for their inconsistencies. The first time I went- I went with a groups of people. About 5 of our meals were raw. I've been there twice- both times on a Tuesday for their unlimited mussels. Both times were good.Their black & white cake is OFF THE CHAIN! Don't leave here without trying it! Pretty pricey for basic meals, but overall good.",3.0

"Will never return. The establishment seems to exude a collected, well-planned business model for a local spot in Bedford, but the staff ruined this experience for my guests and I, particularly in our interaction with management.

"Met some friends here for a Saturday brunch. I was told to order the bloody mary. They serve these fully loaded - bacon, shrimp, veggies, etc. To be hoenst it was just ok and I ended up switching to prosecco.

"My friend is obsessed with this place and has made it her mission to introduce all of her other friends to this place, which is why I ended up. It's a cool spot and not a bad place to be on a Saturday night. The place seems to be equally divided between the bar up front and the restaurant in the back. I came for the food so headed to the back when I arrived.The place was moderately busy the night I went. We got a seat right away but it took about 10 minutes for someone to come check on us. While the waitress who eventually showed up was really nice, the slow service continued. In her defense, I think she might have been the only wait staff for the restaurant part. So shame on Black Swan.My lobster and pork belly PLT was good. Normally, I avoid getting sandwiches, but I like lobster and I like pork belly. Seemed like the perfect dish for me. My girlfriend was disappointed with her meal. The reason why she drags people here is because of a particular fish dish that  Black Swan does really, really well (according to her). Well Black Swan changed up the menu by the time she dragged me here so she went with the trout. She thought it was bland. She also sent back her first drink. Not such a good night for her. I usually stick to the beer and this place had a good selection of bottled beers.  I had this really amazing German beer, Licher Oktoberfest. I wanted to try a few more but I had an early morning the next day.I will return but mostly for the bar.  Seems like a great spot to start your night or even end it.",3.0
"This place is a huge joke. To whoever said ""rude customer service is an understatement,"" I would like to buy you a drink next time I'm in town. Just not at Black Swan. When the waiter was clearing our plates, he hastily grabbed one with a knife sticking out and ultimately cut my arm. Since it was that rough part of the elbow, it felt worse than it was, but it shocked me and I involuntarily gasped and grabbed my arm. Our waiter couldn't have been more inconvenienced. He just stood there for a moment and then when I realized it was surface and it wasn't going to bleed, he said, ""You're fine."" This is after he took all the time in the world grabbing our drinks and asked us if we were ready to order by saying, ""What do you want?"" and then when we were actually ready to order, ""Do you know what you want yet?"" My friends hate me for giving a 17% tip but what can you do. He did show up to his job he clearly hates, after all.The biggest trickery of this place is that their website sounds like a very classy establishment however you show up and it's a dark, dank dive that I would not take my mother to. The food was mediocre (I got the portobello burger w/ fries) but the biggest perk was that our dirty martinis were only $6 - you CANNOT beat that. I would probably like this place if I knew up front it was more of a dive, if I just got drinks and perhaps ate at the bar or something, and if I didn't leave with a laceration.",2.0
"Went for brunch yesterday--got a bloody mary and two eggs, home fries, toast.Eggs were sunny-side up, cooked flawlessly, and absolutely delicious.

I was confused about this notion of a beer chaser being a shot of beer...in Wisconsin, you typically get a pint of PBR with the drink. $10 for a bloody is pricey, even by NYC standards.

"Get to the Chase:Pros:1) GODDAM!!! SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY!! 2) This place is absolutely to die for because of the quality in food, the astoundingly friendly service, and super chill ambience; It's affordable food at ridiculously above-par quality! 8 drinks, 6 entrees, 1 dessert = $37/person for a group of 6 and that includes 20-25% tip. 3) Any Michelin star place can't compare! Hands down the best crab cakes, the best lobster mac n cheese, the best french toast, and the best burgers I've ever had. 4) Umami burger, Shake Shack, and any other burger place can't even compare to the generously sized, minimal oil, full of flavor burgers that Black Swan offers5) Black Swan sets a standard of service and food that no place in Manhattan comes close to. 6) If I could go here for brunch I would every day!7) Oh having great food is not enough, they also have ridiculous variety in taste and offerings for drinks!

When I ordered a Manhattan, he made sure to ask exactly how I wanted it (perfect manhattan-equal parts sweet and dry vermouth, up!). It was great.

"Walking through the black doors you'll find yourself looking down a long, full bar with a compliment of TVs playing whatever the sports game of the moment is (world cup in this case).It could be London, it could be New York, could be a British styled pub anywhere really. It's 6:00pm on a Wednesday and you order their happy hour prosecco - bottomless until 8:00pm.It takes a few minutes to order because the woman working your end of the bar is distracted by some malfunctioning electronics, but the guy at the other end swings down finally and helps you out.They've changed the prosecco brand. It's better now. It was hot and humid out too. The game is good. The glasses swill down easy. Water and food keep you in check. Gastropub it is - certainly a notch above your normal pub grub. Hey, there are some good looking people here. Or maybe it's the low candlelight and dozen glasses of prosecco talking.Black Swan is a solid gastropub. The service is solid, the drinks are solid, the happy hours will certainly keep you happy (they have a late night one too 1:00-4:00am for your nightcap pleasure), but it lacks that ""it"" factor that makes for something special.",3.0

To make things worse, their service has not changed from the usual state of middling to crappy, depending on the day. This was not the case a year and a half ago...

"This place was pretty awesome. Came here for dinner last Friday night w/ my boyfriend and we had a great time. I cannot remember the last time I had a good dining experience in the Clinton Hill/Bed Stuy area.Anyway, I got the mussels and fries small plate and our server permitted me to change the fries to sweet potatoes at no extra charge. They had a gfree beer from Colorado so I ordered that too and E had the Black Swan Burger. The mussels were piping hot and a bit spicy- just the way I like it.The place was dimly lit and the tables were not too close together like its competitors. The fantastic decor and the design (dark wood panels, goth-y fixtures) adds more mystique to the restaurant.Good happy hour prices for well drinks and beers from 5-8pm.Michelin recommendation is truly well earned. Here's to getting a star next year.",5.0
"I like Black Swan a lot and have been a number of times. Normally, my wife and I think of it as a good neighborhood option. On two recent occasions, though, I have noticed a very upsetting development: thinly veiled racism from the bar staff.My wife and I like to sit at the bar. On a recent visit, a number of black people began streaming in after an event let out somewhere in the neighborhood. It was clear these people hadn't been to Black Swan before and were just looking for some food and a drink before they went home. A number of folks ordered food to go and had a drink while they waited, others sat down. From what I saw, all of these folks were treated with disdain -- the bar staff was needlessly difficult and curt and sent a clear message that these people were not the business the establishment wants. They were hassled and pushed out of the way by wait staff. A woman asked about how long her order would take, and the bartender responded, ""this isn't fast food."" He might as well have told her to go to Crown Fried Chicken.Last night, my wife and I were sitting at the bar when a black couple sidled up next to us and ordered a pair of long island ice teas. The bartender said flatly ""we don't make that."" The couple then asked for lemon drops, which the bartender turned down as well. At this point, the couple seemed flummoxed. I used to bartend. There are people who have a signature drink or two but otherwise don't know what they like. Its easy to help such people, teach them something about ordering alcohol. Basically, to be friendly and do your job. This bartender took the other tack, making clear again that Black Swan doesn't want to cater to a certain portion of the neighborhood.Let me spell it out. The most offensive guy has brown hair, short on the sides and longer on top, he wears it straight up, and has a brown beard. I don't think English is his first language. Also, perhaps worth noting that while he wasn't racist towards us, a white couple, he wasn't anything towards us. He's a shitty server. This guy needs a talking to.",2.0
"I  do not like crowded restaurants so if I ever get the day off , I go during the week becauae Saturdays and Sundays it's crowded with drinking people from early. It's an around the way place. I always get the Waffles w/ Fried chicken . I give it 4 of 5 stars .  It's more appropriate for a group of friends or a casual brunch date than it is for a family. I had one bad experience with a lady waitress but the service I would later receive compensates 100xs for that one experience. Just friendly people. Not cheesy and chummy. Great spot for brunch.

It's 6:00pm on a Wednesday and you order their happy hour prosecco - bottomless until 8:00pm.It takes a few minutes to order because the woman working your end of the bar is distracted by some malfunctioning electronics, but the guy at the other end swings down finally and helps you out.They've changed the prosecco brand. It's better now. It was hot and humid out too. The game is good. The glasses swill down easy. Water and food keep you in check. Gastropub it is - certainly a notch above your normal pub grub. Hey, there are some good looking people here. Or maybe it's the low candlelight and dozen glasses of prosecco talking.Black Swan is a solid gastropub. The service is solid, the drinks are solid, the happy hours will certainly keep you happy (they have a late night one too 1:00-4:00am for your nightcap pleasure), but it lacks that ""it"" factor that makes for something special.",3.0
"Atmosphere is super cozy (the lighting is perfect... not too dark, but you can still see the person in front of you). The folks are super friendly! The only thing I'm not a fan of is the awkward small tables in the middle of the room (but, I suppose they have to use their space) -- makes for weird seating. Their bloody mary = awesome. I'm super picky when it comes to a great BM and theirs tastes like it was made with love. Approved. The only other thing I had were the cheese curds -- delicious, but I'd be surprised if anyone could efF up cheese. Impossible. I'd come back for a drink!",4.0
"Really sad to be writing this but the quality of food at Black Swan has a really deteriorated. Over the last six months I've gone there a handful of times, and they have really fucked up orders. Last time they screwed up my friend's burger, this time they screwed up mine (ordered Black Swan burger medium rare with french fries, the burger came back well done, the fries were soggy and looked half cooked). To make things worse, their service has not changed from the usual state of middling to crappy, depending on the day. This was not the case a year and a half ago... I loved coming here because it was close to my apartment and pretty good food, now the food is terrible and still expensive. Get your shit together Black Swan.",1.0
"I do take-out late snacks after work sometimes.I hardly eat meat. But then I had the jerk wings with thai dip. Oh my chickens. so sorry. What mac n cheese? You wanna slide on my tongue? Yes. 3 wings down, 1/40th of the Mac remaining, reclining on the wall bc I'm too full and exhaling just to take another bite...4wings in...Comfort foods. #pillows and nams....4.5 wings in. Break time.",5.0
Music was way too loud. It was way too dark. And forget about ordering delivery. My order is now over two hours late and when I called to check on it they just put me on hold for 10 minutes. I have been going here for years and I will never return after my last few experiences.,1.0
"Black Swan is like a sports bar and cocktail bar rolled up into one: I had very delicious cocktails here, but they also seem to serve hearty meals with widescreen TVs playing sports. This bar will appease the dudes, the hipsters, and the chicks. I like that it's a comfortable, unpretentious bar that still looks nice and has quality victuals.BedStuy-On-Rye - reminiscent of Christmas/gingersnaps/eggnog.The Hensley - like an old-fashioned but with bacon flavor and maple syrup for sweetness.The bartender was also really friendly - she gave us a sample of some cider when she overheard us talking about BedStuy-On-Rye tasting seasonal.",5.0
"This place was pretty awesome. Came here for dinner last Friday night w/ my boyfriend and we had a great time. I cannot remember the last time I had a good dining experience in the Clinton Hill/Bed Stuy area.Anyway, I got the mussels and fries small plate and our server permitted me to change the fries to sweet potatoes at no extra charge. They had a gfree beer from Colorado so I ordered that too and E had the Black Swan Burger. The mussels were piping hot and a bit spicy- just the way I like it.The place was dimly lit and the tables were not too close together like its competitors. The fantastic decor and the design (dark wood panels, goth-y fixtures) adds more mystique to the restaurant.Good happy hour prices for well drinks and beers from 5-8pm.Michelin recommendation is truly well earned. Here's to getting a star next year.",5.0
"I like Black Swan a lot and have been a number of times. Normally, my wife and I think of it as a good neighborhood option. On two recent occasions, though, I have noticed a very upsetting development: thinly veiled racism from the bar staff.My wife and I like to sit at the bar. On a recent visit, a number of black people began streaming in after an event let out somewhere in the neighborhood. It was clear these people hadn't been to Black Swan before and were just looking for some food and a drink before they went home. A number of folks ordered food to go and had a drink while they waited, others sat down. From what I saw, all of these folks were treated with disdain -- the bar staff was needlessly difficult and curt and sent a clear message that these people were not the business the establishment wants. They were hassled and pushed out of the way by wait staff. A woman asked about how long her order would take, and the bartender responded, ""this isn't fast food."" He might as well have told her to go to Crown Fried Chicken.Last night, my wife and I were sitting at the bar when a black couple sidled up next to us and ordered a pair of long island ice teas. The bartender said flatly ""we don't make that."" The couple then asked for lemon drops, which the bartender turned down as well. At this point, the couple seemed flummoxed. I used to bartend. There are people who have a signature drink or two but otherwise don't know what they like. Its easy to help such people, teach them something about ordering alcohol. Basically, to be friendly and do your job. This bartender took the other tack, making clear again that Black Swan doesn't want to cater to a certain portion of the neighborhood.Let me spell it out. The most offensive guy has brown hair, short on the sides and longer on top, he wears it straight up, and has a brown beard. I don't think English is his first language. Also, perhaps worth noting that while he wasn't racist towards us, a white couple, he wasn't anything towards us. He's a shitty server. This guy needs a talking to.",2.0
"I  do not like crowded restaurants so if I ever get the day off , I go during the week becauae Saturdays and Sundays it's crowded with drinking people from early. It's an around the way place. I always get the Waffles w/ Fried chicken . I give it 4 of 5 stars .  It's more appropriate for a group of friends or a casual brunch date than it is for a family. I had one bad experience with a lady waitress but the service I would later receive compensates 100xs for that one experience. Just friendly people. Not cheesy and chummy. Great spot for brunch. And so much natural lighting in the back ! Oh, I love .",4.0

"I Effing love black swan! I went on a crazy packed Saturday night and was still able to get a table without a wait. Had mac and cheese and wings, which was super filling. I eat like a 16 year old stoner, but I could barely finish my meal. Although the seating is pretty tight, the crowd is very laid back so it wasn't an issue. The staff were super friendly, upon sitting my friend and I were talking our life away rather than looking at the menu.

"The centerpiece of the part of Bed/Sty that feels like an extension of Clinton Hill, Black Swan is a sports bar that doubles as a brunch place. Or maybe it's a restaurant that occasionally shows basketball games and has a reasonable beer selection. Whatever it is, Black Swan delivers no matter the hour. Brunch is usually a walk-in, no-line affair in a bright but not-too-bright dining room full of black painted booths and long tables. The food isn't terribly cheap but no one will be hungry after making an attempt at the chicken and waffles or the rum French toast with bacon and bananas.The bar food is commendable as well, with a  no-nonsense mac and cheese and chicken wings being two of the more memorable examples. I can't think of a misstep that's gone on here, either in the sit down back or bar and standing room of the narrow front room.The beer list doesn't push any boundaries - some rarer taps would be nice - and it can get loud, but this is the kind of establishment would be welcome in any neighborhood.",4.0

Whoever came up with that recipe needs to reconsider what actually pairs well with salmon. My girlfriend ordered griled steak, and asked to substitute the fries with a salad. No problem, they assured us.  They sent the fries anyway and billed her for the salad later. They also decided to bill us for a beer that we never got b/c they had run out.

We finally get our PLT but the egg is over easy instead of fried. UGH. We have to wait 5 more minutes to finally get a so so sandwich. My husbands fish and chip was OK.

Tonight my boyfriend and I had the ribs (damn good!) and I had a lobster Caesar salad. I very clearly and audibly asked for the dressing on the side and our waiter Mike nodded yes, and when my salad came, there is was, dressing tossed in, with wilted greens. Not my thing, but it wasn't so drenched that I couldn't just roll with it. I was hungry and I'm a laid back person. MIKE never came by and checked on the table, until we flagged him down to ask for the check, even though he clearly had time to check his FB status. I told him when we handed him out payment, ""Next time try to take a moment to make sure dressing is on the side when it's ordered that way."" He couldn't even own his shit! ""oh the kitchen did that."" That was his response. HEY MIKE: THAT'S YOUR JOB MORON! I've waited tables before asshat, get your shit together and DO YOUR JOB.",3.0

"Went today for for brunch.  Ordered a Bellini which came in a small glass with lipstick stain on it that was not mine.  Sent it back.  Utensils were not clean so we had to be given a new set up.  Ordered Chicken and Waffles.  I could not cut the waffle it was so hard.  Sent it back, new   waffle was better, chicken was good.  Overall not the greatest experience, not sure if I will go back again.",2.0
The food was fine there but the service leaves much to be desired. I had to practically beg the bartender for a drink. My drink was empty for quite awhile. The food was fine but nothing out of the ordinary. What really bothered me was that no one seemed really interested in my experience. I will probably frequent other local establishments and recommend that others do the same.,1.0
"Ive been to black swan twice, and both times have left me feeling like I wish I wouldve gone somewhere else. I heard great reviews about the Black Swan Burger, so both me and my girlfriend ordered it with some IPAs. The burgers were overdone and underseasoned. The second time we went, I decided to try the grilled salmon, which came overdone, underseasoned, and with some weird creme freche on a bed of corn. It was gross. Whoever came up with that recipe needs to reconsider what actually pairs well with salmon. My girlfriend ordered griled steak, and asked to substitute the fries with a salad. No problem, they assured us.  They sent the fries anyway and billed her for the salad later. They also decided to bill us for a beer that we never got b/c they had run out. The service is lacking, the food is not great. Sorry black swan, you don't get a chance to strike out a third time.",2.0

We went at 5:30 on a Saturday August 1 2015 to beat the crowd. Ordered drinks which were ok. Mac and cheese with bacon and jalapeño was delicious. 45 minutes later no food. People who came in after our party of 3 got their food. My daughter asked if there was an issue. The waitress said one minute. 5 more minutes no food. Ask to see manager....kitchen mix up they say. We finally get our PLT but the egg is over easy instead of fried. UGH. We have to wait 5 more minutes to finally get a so so sandwich. My husbands fish and chip was OK. The sweet potato fries were good. They gave us the sandwich at no fee but the whole experience was awful. We have  been to so many fantastic restaurants. In Brooklyn do not wast your time here.,1.0
"I live in the neighborhood and have been eating here on the regular for almost 2 years. I like the food and the atmosphere is fine. I often order to go, and have a glass of wine and have probably eaten *in* the establishment 3 times altogether. That said, the kitchen does a fine job. Tonight my boyfriend and I had the ribs (damn good!) and I had a lobster Caesar salad. I very clearly and audibly asked for the dressing on the side and our waiter Mike nodded yes, and when my salad came, there is was, dressing tossed in, with wilted greens. Not my thing, but it wasn't so drenched that I couldn't just roll with it. I was hungry and I'm a laid back person. MIKE never came by and checked on the table, until we flagged him down to ask for the check, even though he clearly had time to check his FB status. I told him when we handed him out payment, ""Next time try to take a moment to make sure dressing is on the side when it's ordered that way."" He couldn't even own his shit! ""oh the kitchen did that."" That was his response. HEY MIKE: THAT'S YOUR JOB MORON! I've waited tables before asshat, get your shit together and DO YOUR JOB.",3.0
"I am totally unclear why this spot gets only 3.5 stars.

"I went here early last Sunday night with one of my oldest friends, the two of us still recuperating from his full blown Brazilian Carnaval house party. At around 5:30, we staggered in there and were quickly amused by our quirky waiter. Service wasn't fast; then again, it was fairly crowded with locals getting ready to watch the Oscars.He ordered a regular burger with Swiss cheese and fries plus a fruity Abita beer, and I had the tuna burger with avocado and salad. I opted out of the jalapeno mayo because my love of spice does not exceed my hatred of mayo's slimy texture. No beer for me. My liver was still processing the cachaca, coconut rum, white wine and craft beer from the night before.Both burgers came on the tastiest, freshest brioche ever. My patty perfectly cooked and HUGE, to the edges of its bun. The avocado texture complemented the juicy, zingy tuna patty so well. And the salad was what appeared to be a whole head of baby red leaf lettuce, just misted with dressing. Nothing could have been better about my hangover meal. From the sound of contented munching, I know my friend's beef patty and fries must have been equally satisfying. I am not a fan of regular fries at all, but would definitely like to come back to try the sweet potato ones. I did taste his beer. Thankfully, it was only citrusy, not sweet at all despite how its orange color resembled pink lemonade in the semi-dark.This place is certainly work a revisit, and I only gave it four stars because it took almost 40 min for out food to show up.

I will definitely be a repeat offender.... I ordered the catfish sliders... And the Swan salad... Yeah its basic but basically awesome. Lol... For the price I was expecting a little smaller portions.  I got three lovely sliders with a pretty sizeable piece of catfish.  That I decided to eat open face. Needed a Lil spice but overall not bad.  Now the Swan salad.  Mixed greens pecans goat cheese and balsamic vinegarette...  Basic and yummy.  The salad wasn't drowned. It was just right.  I had a ginger tea to drink which was ginger tea with a spiced rum or something... Really nice. They had a nice Lil assortment of hot adult beverages... Which I love.  Had black and white mousse cake for dessert. Creamy sweet and to the point.  My partner in crime had the Mac and cheese... It was OK.. Not the best but definitely not the worst.... Super creamyAnd he ate it without complaint... Along with jerk wings... Once again no complaint.  I will say it's a good compromise for date night.  The game is showing for him and you don't have to eat wings and fries..   Service and decor cool...

"2.5 for food4 for service3 for valueI have a pretty standard routine on Saturday mornings that involve checking into #nerdland with Mrs. Melissa Harris-Perry at 11am.  Sometime that means having to chose between a good brunch and my weekend fix of my favorite sister-girl-role-model and her left-leaning, remarkably diverse, socio-political roundtable.  But sometimes, I don't.  I arrived at Black Swan just before 11 was greeted by a friendly female bartender, who encouraged me to sit at the bar while I waited for my friend to arrive. Two televisions had Fox News playing on them and I sat silently debating whether or not I should risk a discussion on politics by asking if they could change one over to Mel on MSNBC.  Just as i decided not to ask, the sweet bartender openly questioned why the televisions were tuned to Fox at all.  I silently rejoiced and took the opportunity to ask if they would mind switching to MSNBC for Nerdland and they happily obliged.Needless to say, they won tons of points with me for their carefree attitude about the television.  I sat contented, reading the captions while I waited for my friend.  Unfortunately, as luck would have it, 35 minutes into the program, my friend calls to tell me that she's having a terrible time trying to get to the restaurant due to the marathon.  Her frustration was evident and we decided to reschedule.  However, since I was already there (and by that point, starving), I decided to order the Salmon Eggs Benedict and finish watching my show.My breakfast came out hot and plated very nicely, however, I'd say the meal itself was less than I'd hoped for.  I can't really pinpoint where the execution went wrong - something was off with the Hollandaise Sauce for sure - but I must say that I've had better.All in all, good experience, meh food.  Given that Black Swan opens early for brunch, has great customer service, and is in my neighborhood, I'll probably give it one more chance to wow me.",3.0

"During my visit to NYC, I wanted to experience a good taste of Brooklyn in the area I'm staying. I've been to a couple other places and had good experiences, and when I looked and saw there was a cool and decently reviewed pub I went to try it out.It wasn't really that good, unfortunately.Getting a table was no problem - it was before early dinner rush (I arrived around 5:30) - and there weren't many people in the dining area. When you get to the table, they give you a bottle of water that looks like a bottle of wine, and the menus. The area itself is dimly lit, which would give a nice ambiance except that there's pretty loud music playing and two TVs, which I would have expected in to the bar but not the dining area. The music selection was good but I'd rather have it a little quieter so that if I had a date I could have better intimate conversations. Service was slow in general. Even though it took me 10-15 minutes to decide on what I wanted, it took the server longer to actually come and ask what I'd like or if I had any questions. If it was how it was when I left, during the rush, I could kinda understand, but there were not many tables so I didn't expect to wait that long. There was one woman who walked around and checked on the tables in the dining area, but didn't come by and talk to anyone from what I could tell, maybe sometimes clearing the tables. There were a couple servers, and at least one food runner, but it still took a ton of time to get anything accomplished and didn't seem very coordinated overall. Anyway, I ordered the ""Carmen, 7am"" starter with bacon and the fish & chips, plus a Haringey (mescal and peach cocktail). The cocktail arrived first, and I enjoyed it. The starter took a while to get there, longer than I expected, and it was alright -- it's fries, baked beans, a fried egg, and I added in bacon. The egg was a little overcooked, so the yolk was not runny, but not completely solid either. The dish seemed like it had been sitting out a little bit, or at least the fries weren't fresh. The bacon was just two slices of bacon put on top, rather than cut into chunks, which made it kind of tricky to eat with the dish. Overall okay, the drink helped.The fish & chips took a lot longer than I expected to get there. I figured that they'd put in both orders at once and it would arrive shortly after I finished my first. This wasn't the case though; I think I waited around 15-20 minutes for the fish & chips to arrive, and in that time I ordered a second drink: the Antidote, which is Bols Genever gin, egg white, and ginger. I'm under the impression that the cocktail wasn't well made, since it arrived in a dirty (as in there was some of the cocktail on the coupe stem and base), and wasn't really to my liking (maybe a little too much gin? too much egg white?). I also made a mistake in ordering it with the fish & chips, so don't do that! haha.The fish & chips weren't what I'd expect from a pub. The fries were nice and fresh, if a little overdone, and salted well, but there were a TON of them (probably 3 or 4 handfuls). The fish was a bit past done as the batter was a dark brown rather than golden. The first fish didn't stay together with the batter at all, which made it difficult to eat while the second fared a little better, but since the batter was overdone I'm kind of glad it came apart so I didn't have to eat it with it. There were two slices of lemon but they were buried under the mountain of fries and I didn't see until I was halfway through the first fish. The upside is that the shitty fish & chips you get at a chain restaurant always upset my stomach, and these didn't, so there's that.The only other comment I have is that the server asked for my ID when I paid rather than when I asked for a drink, was is a little strange and I was surprised because I had already had my two drinks...Maybe it was a bad night, since there were a few other tables that seemed to not be having a good time? In any case, if you're looking for a good place to eat, I'd look elsewhere, and I wouldn't say it was worth the check price.",2.0
"Service- not too good. The restaurant part was empty except for 1 group at a booth and 2 people at a small table, but they wouldn't allow my friend and I to have a booth because they're ""reserved for parties of 3+.

One guy who brought the food was pretty awkward. And he forgot to bring syrup with my chicken and waffles. Food- The food was good. I had chicken and waffles, which was great. I like dense waffles and well seasoned chicken. The chicken was also moist, and easy to cut. My friend had the crabcake eggs benedict, which was good also. It came with a side of arugula which she said was weird. We had a side of sweet potato fries which were really great. The drinks were tiny! The bellini comes in a small, shallow glass and the caiprinha comes in a short glass filled with ice. Maybe 3 oz liquid in each.",3.0

There's some weird mix of Asian and Australian liquor and a shelf of cookies/candies available.Large list of beers and ciders for great prices.Interesting menu including an option to BRING your own burger patty to make and have them put whatever toppings you want on it (an egg too!?)I ordered the Grilled Portobello Burger with a side of salad. The burger was surprisingly done really well and was flavorful- if you can say a mushroom is moist, that's what it was. The salad on the other hand.... wasn't a salad.It was a bunch of mixed greens, and only mixed greens with a vinagrette on top.... the worst part is that the greens smelled like they were washed in water and then sat out damp since it had that ""stank water"" scent. Blegh.Just come here for the drinks. If you're getting food, don't mess with the greens.",3.0

No less than five kilos. Special order. For the odd girl at table five.I like the interior, the patrons were varied, the service was spotty but friendly, and the brunch moved on. Their drink menu is at least fourscore times the size of the food menu. And the price to quality ratio for meals is no less than 2:1.

The upside is that the shitty fish & chips you get at a chain restaurant always upset my stomach, and these didn't, so there's that.The only other comment I have is that the server asked for my ID when I paid rather than when I asked for a drink, was is a little strange and I was surprised because I had already had my two drinks...Maybe it was a bad night, since there were a few other tables that seemed to not be having a good time? In any case, if you're looking for a good place to eat, I'd look elsewhere, and I wouldn't say it was worth the check price.",2.0
"Service- not too good. The restaurant part was empty except for 1 group at a booth and 2 people at a small table, but they wouldn't allow my friend and I to have a booth because they're ""reserved for parties of 3+. Whatever. Our waiter brought my food, but didn't bring my friend's order until about 10 minutes later! Wtf. I wasn't going to start eating, but my food was getting cold. One guy who brought the food was pretty awkward. And he forgot to bring syrup with my chicken and waffles. Food- The food was good. I had chicken and waffles, which was great. I like dense waffles and well seasoned chicken. The chicken was also moist, and easy to cut. My friend had the crabcake eggs benedict, which was good also. It came with a side of arugula which she said was weird. We had a side of sweet potato fries which were really great. The drinks were tiny! The bellini comes in a small, shallow glass and the caiprinha comes in a short glass filled with ice. Maybe 3 oz liquid in each.",3.0
"In the middle of a few delis, homes, and a block away with a fellow peering INTO my friend's car after he parked is unexpectedly, Black Swan.Went in to find it ENTIRELY packed on a Tuesday night near midnight. People were still seated dining. The bar was pretty much full and so was the seating along the wall. WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE? WHY ARE THEY ALL OUT ON A TUESDAY?The bartenders were really friendly. There's some weird mix of Asian and Australian liquor and a shelf of cookies/candies available.Large list of beers and ciders for great prices.Interesting menu including an option to BRING your own burger patty to make and have them put whatever toppings you want on it (an egg too!?)I ordered the Grilled Portobello Burger with a side of salad. The burger was surprisingly done really well and was flavorful- if you can say a mushroom is moist, that's what it was. The salad on the other hand.... wasn't a salad.It was a bunch of mixed greens, and only mixed greens with a vinagrette on top.... the worst part is that the greens smelled like they were washed in water and then sat out damp since it had that ""stank water"" scent. Blegh.Just come here for the drinks. If you're getting food, don't mess with the greens.",3.0

"Not bad. Not great. And so, an uninspired review follows of a a place that left me feeling uninspired.Good coffee, ok french toast (oh-so sweet and too banana'y), tasty hollandaise and well-poached eggs, but average everything else. Stellar black and white pudding. In fact, I wish I would have just had a solid order of the stuff with a stiff drink and I would be good to go. Black and white pudding piled high. No less than five kilos. Special order. For the odd girl at table five.I like the interior, the patrons were varied, the service was spotty but friendly, and the brunch moved on. Their drink menu is at least fourscore times the size of the food menu. And the price to quality ratio for meals is no less than 2:1. Perhaps if a terrifyingly eerie ballerina on toe made an appearance, I would change my tune. But for now, the whistle is monotone.",3.0
"Food was OK but service, awful.  Came in at noon, NO ONE ELSE in the place.  Still our orders took over half an hour to get to us.  There were three of us, the waiter brought 2 brunch orders and then FIFTEEN MINUTES later brought my order.  Not exaggerating.  At no time did the guy come over and say, sorry your order's been delayed.  I actually ordered the waffles and fried chicken.  Not real crispy, also just tasted weird.  Not bad, just weird.  My mates ordered a burger (OK, kind of undercooked) and eggs benedict (pretty damn delicious).Also no toilet paper in the bathroom.  Nor is there a sink, the sink's communal, after you get out of the bathroom. And, the music's kind of loud.  Maybe that's great at 4am but we had trouble talking over it.",2.0

"I used to live around the corner from Black Swan but never made it over, so I was happy to hop on the bus and come back to the hood to try their food. The brunch menu was packed but I had my heart set on the french toast, which while filling and fluffy, wasn't the best I'd ever had. My boyfriend had the huge English breakfast which had more favor. Service was great and even though there was a soccer match going on it wasn't too crazy or loud. I'd like to swing by again at night for dinner and drinks.",4.0
"Great space, good-looking staff, sumptuous drinks and excellent food. Especially for drunch, which is their forte. The bloody mary comes with two slices of bacon, a skewer of caper, cocktail onion, olive, shrimp and lemon, and a shot of beer as a 'chaser,' which I don't really get since bloodys don't have a particularly offensive flavor and the beer will be flat by the time you finish it... Anyway, onto food. I chose the greenest, healthiest-looking thing on the brunch menu, which is my current go-to strategy for ameliorating a hangover. That was a cobb salad, which sounds bland, but was done exquisitely. The greens had a light oil dressing that complemented the other flavors flawlessly. We ordered a Radeberger to cap off the morning and it came in a tall, frosty mug. Good people-watching, not too crowded and not too many strollers either.Excellent spot for food and drink at any hour.",4.0
"The black swan is almost perfect! I've gone here at least 15 times for dinner over the last year and the food is always great. My favorite is the BYOBURGER and the fish and chips.

The extensive beer list is great for people who are into craft beers, the servers are always knowledgable if I ask questions.Service is usually great, everyone is friendly and always makes sure we are taken care of. Once, I forgot my purse and it turned out they locked it up over night in their office and were happy to help me get it back for me. Thank you!",4.0

"Stopped by here for brunch, waited only about 5 min to get seated.

Also ordered the chicken and waffles and the portions were huge. I've eaten a LOT of chicken and waffles all over the US and this was by far THE best I've ever had. I was surprised that the chicken was boneless because the white meat was so juicy and moist, and there was plenty of dark meat as well (and zero gristle).

"I have come here to review one dish and one dish only:CHICKEN AND WAFFLES.My wife and I are going through our NYC bucket list, and several rounds of chicken and waffles are a priority. With a ton of places to choose from, this place got the first nod, and boy was it a good choice.The chicken was piled 3 huge, delicate pieces high - perfectly moist and tender. The waffle was just how I like it - soft and slightly chewy. One huge dollop of freshly (like immediately) made whipped cream, and a dipper of high quality, real maple syrup later... and we were in heaven. One minor negative... when we asked for hot sauce we received Siracha....what? Wouldn't be my first hot sauce choice for Chicken and Waffles...Also a note on the batter seasoning (or lack thereof): good fried chicken, to me, doesn't need a lot of seasoning in the batter. It is a delicate flavor, and with the waffle/syrup I don't want a lot of extra savory-ish seasonings. If it was dinner time I could hear an argument for more batter seasonings, but at breakfast - leave em out. I loved this dish.",5.0

I love this place. My favorite it's the pork chop and lobster Mac and cheese. It's delicious. There is seating in the back for a nice intimate dinner and a bar on the front to hang out with friends or just meet some of Brooklyn's interesting characters. Happy hour is till 8 pm so there is no rush to get here by 6. Steve one of the bartenders here is very friendly and let's you try pretty much anything before you decide what you're drinking for the night. You might even be tipsy by the time you made your choice ;),5.0
Stopped in for a beer or two after work. Great draft beer selection. The wings were pretty good too.,4.0

"I have come here to review one dish and one dish only:CHICKEN AND WAFFLES.My wife and I are going through our NYC bucket list, and several rounds of chicken and waffles are a priority. With a ton of places to choose from, this place got the first nod, and boy was it a good choice.The chicken was piled 3 huge, delicate pieces high - perfectly moist and tender. The waffle was just how I like it - soft and slightly chewy. One huge dollop of freshly (like immediately) made whipped cream, and a dipper of high quality, real maple syrup later... and we were in heaven. One minor negative... when we asked for hot sauce we received Siracha....what? Wouldn't be my first hot sauce choice for Chicken and Waffles...Also a note on the batter seasoning (or lack thereof): good fried chicken, to me, doesn't need a lot of seasoning in the batter. It is a delicate flavor, and with the waffle/syrup I don't want a lot of extra savory-ish seasonings. If it was dinner time I could hear an argument for more batter seasonings, but at breakfast - leave em out. I loved this dish.",5.0
"I really enjoyed the food. However, I am giving this place 3 stars because of their RUDE bartender. From the minute I walked in, I could tell she would be an issue. From her snide, passive aggressive remarks toward other  patrons to her clearly visible lack of interest in making certain drinks. I got there at about 4:30 and was informed by the hostess that they would not be serving food until 5. Thus, my friend and I decided to wait at the bar. As I say at the bar, two more gentleman came in and was informed of the 5pm policy. As they talked amongst themselves, the bartender asked them if they wanted a drink. The gentlemen kindly informed them that they were deciding whether they wanted to stay or not. Instead of saying ""OK"" and leaving it like that she says ""oh, just so you know this has ALWAYS been the policy."" The men, as well as my friend and I, looked at her like ""WHO ASKED YOU?"" Shortly after that, I asked her if Sunday brunch is typically loud because I was considering having my bridal luncheon there. Of course, she couldn't just answer the question in the nicest way possible. Rather her response was (in the most passive aggressive manner) ""well I have no way of knowing how loud it will be this Sunday."" With that, I had had ENOUGH and had to calmly put her in her place and tell her that while I didn't expect her to be PSYCHIC, I simply asked a question about the past Sundays. For some reason, she was shocked that someone could be as rude as she was. Oh and last but not least, when it was time to close my tab, I PERSONALLY (I say personally bc it wasn't something I said out loud) observed that all credit transactions had to be over $15. My total was only $7 but I wanted a margarita. So again, I asked the bartender how much a margarita was. NOTICE MY QUESTION: ""How much is a margarita?"" Of course she couldn't just ANSWER THE QUESTION. Her response was ""I can close it if it's under $15."" Trying to be patient, I simply said ""OK, but I would like a margarita please."" She turns around and let's out the biggest SIGH as she made the drink. I'm sorry, am I inconveniencing you by asking you to make a menu drink?!!! Is this not your job?!!! I will never recommend this place to anyone.  And If I ever return to this place, I will NEVER drink at that bar again.",3.0

We decided to order some drinks at the bar and after about 10 minutes of waiting, nothing happened. At this point, I have to be pro-active. I flagged down the bartender and asked for a few drinks. I had something with jalapeno in it and Ribena. Too bad I couldn't taste anything spicy and honestly, Ribena is just too sweet. Not sure I would come back.

"Good place, but they are so cheap with the heat.  I'm sitting here, right now, on a cold night, and it feels like I'm sitting outside.  The employees (some guy named Max - maybe an owner or manager?) got into a loud, semi-joking and definitely profane) back and forth with a couple employees over where to set the temp.  I'm sitting at the bar right now and I said to this ""Max"" guy - ""Hey, it's really cold in here!"" and he replied ""Yeah the thermostat's not workin' right.""  That's it.  No apology, and he acted annoyed that a customer would say something.  This kind of stuff really drives me nuts!  If they warm it up and get better with these kinds of interactions, my rating jumps, too.  I mean, at 4:40 I sat down at the bar and asked for a menu.  The guy replied ""We don't serve till 5!""  I'm like, alright, that's fine...may I have a menu?  So I've been in here dozens of times (would be several dozen if they paid attention to the details) and there are some really good employees here, but man...they have to tighten the ship if they want to be taken seriously.  I'm talking to the guy next to me right now and he tells me it's ALWAYS COLD in here in the winter.  The staff is having fun with each other, but not so much with the customers..and I was totally dismissed when I said it was cold.  G-r-r-r-r and B-r-r-r-r-r.",3.0
"I just moved half a block down the street from Black Swan, so I know I'll be back... but I'm not like, peeing myself thinking about that next adventure. I sort of wish I was, because my cousins and I have been meaning to go here since it opened, and have never made it. When the three of us embarked on post-moving-me brunch this last Sunday, we were all satisfied but no one was really exclaiming (or peeing). I really love the aesthetic at Black Swan - it's totally my type of environment - dark colors and heavy wood. I can easily see myself spending many-a happy hour here when I am too lazy to walk four blocks to Myrtle to Project Parlor. I would say when it gets too cold to walk four blocks, but it's actually not getting cold this winter, in case you didn't notice. It seems like they have some good happy hour specials (a margarita special on Thursday nights), so I'll be indulging in that soon, too. On Sunday, two of us ordered the bloody swan - the Black Swan's version of a bloody mary. Now, it was super cool and trendy-ish that this delicious beverage came with a shrimp, a cube of cheese, and a strip of bacon floating in it - but as there is no description on the brunch menu of what a bloody swan is (aside from a cutely named bloody mary), this can be problematic to those of us who don't eat meat. I gave my bacon to my cousin and ate the shrimp and cheese... but, I don't normally eat cheese and I only sometimes eat seafood. So I'm just sayin, you might wanna warn people, because while I made the choice to eat said items, they were already floating in my drink anyway - and thus I was basically drinking parts of them whether I liked to or not. Speaking of warning people, our waitress, who was very pretty and wearing a pleasantly low-cut top, didn't have much personality. She didn't really help my cousin when he asked about different brunch items, and she didn't really interact with us much at all. Even though it wasn't busy, she had someone else take care of us a couple times (or maybe the other person just felt obligated, since we weren't being helped?). It took foreverrrrr to get our check and to get my card back to sign the check. The food was decent, though, albiet pricey. I had smoke salmon eggs benedict(since I'd already eaten the shrimp, I thought I'd just go for it), which was good but nothing to get all hot and bothered over. It came with potatoes (crispy, decent), and salad (fine). One of my cousins got the rum waffles (pancakes? I don't remember) and the other got a burger sans bun. Both said their food was good. I thought $15 was a bit much for my dish, but the total bill wasn't awful - $65 before tip. I'm usually a generous tipper, too, but I think I left just barely 20%, as it took about 20 min to complete the whole process of paying. Yes, I'll be back here for drinks for sure. I'm not so sure about food, though, unless it's eaten at the bar. Black Swan was kinda anticlimactic. Womp.",3.0
"My friends took me here for brunch when I visited New York. They have been here before and had good service, so I am not sure how typical my experience is.

It took 40 minutes to get our food and the waitress said ""You came after them so...."" No apology or anything to address our concerns. I tasted the chicken and waffles my friend ordered and it was AWESOME. My eggs were good but they didn't bring bacon and my potatoes were cold. After waiting 40 minutes for food, I was over it and didn't ask for them to make me bacon because I was starving and didn't want to wait another 40 minutes for bacon. Not the best experience- Went to scratchbread (Not a sit down place) and had way better food and service for much less money. Needless to say, the waitress did not get much of a tip.",2.0

"I was a little bit skeptical upon going to Black Swan for brunch one Saturday afternoon. My experience with BedStuy brunches have not been particularly stellar as of late. Unfortunately many of the businesses in the area offer so-so food and small portions with large price tags. Black Swan does the complete opposite. Delicious food, handsome portions & reasonable price tags to match.I got busy over a plate of chicken & waffles which was pretty pitch perfect, the only improvement I would offer would be to add just a touch more seasoning to the chicken, but when I asked for hot sauce they gave me both Cholula & Sriracha hot sauces! I don't know about you, but if an establishment is offering Sriracha as a staple it much be doing something right.My friend enjoyed a delicious burger with perfectly cooked and seasoned sweet potato fries, something that is definitely hard to come by as in most places they are usually soggy, oily & tasteless. Service was a little strange & confusing but eventually it turned out just fine. All in all I shall be returning, maybe for dinner, or for happy hour while watching a game, which would be perfect since they have about 6 flat screen TVs showing sports & a lovely well stocked bar to keep you happily lubricated.Well done Black Swan.

I don't know about you, but if an establishment is offering Sriracha as a staple it much be doing something right.My friend enjoyed a delicious burger with perfectly cooked and seasoned sweet potato fries, something that is definitely hard to come by as in most places they are usually soggy, oily & tasteless. Service was a little strange & confusing but eventually it turned out just fine. All in all I shall be returning, maybe for dinner, or for happy hour while watching a game, which would be perfect since they have about 6 flat screen TVs showing sports & a lovely well stocked bar to keep you happily lubricated.Well done Black Swan. Well played.",4.0
"While the service was great, the food here has taken a drastic turn for the worse in recent months. I would not recommend this as a place to eat. The food has been rather bland and flavorless. It seems strangely like they have attempted to become more fancy then they are capable of actually providing.",2.0
"Was here for a friend's birthday. Started off the evening with a White Hart from the bar. Black pepper infused gin, Chartreuse, Egg White, Lemon and Celery Bitters. Yum. Couldn't taste the Chartreuse, but drink was delicious anyways, and $10 is really good for NYC. The fresh ground black pepper was a nice garnish on the drink too.Seated for dinner at a large table. They were nice enough to hold it for us for a while.The waitress was sweet, and had a nice sense of humor. She was good with the recommendations, and efficient enough. Great so far.The food was okay, or slightly below okay. My seafood stew was mostly halved potatoes. 3 halves of potatoes was a little much, especially when you're just getting 2 shrimp and 2.5 scallops. And 2 small half-slices of grilled bread aren't nearly enough either. But okay, not bad. The sweet potato fries were good. The Mac and Cheese was really bland (bad cheese mix) and could have done with some black pepper or something. From what my neighbors said, the burger and veggie pot pie were both just okay too.My friend asked if they could do a dessert with a candle for the birthday girl, and they said she'd have to buy the dessert. Fair enough, but here's what I don't understand:Why wouldn't they want to give one dessert away for free to a table of 10 that ordered food + drink? After all, it isn't about us getting a freebie - it's about their getting enough goodwill and brownie points (pun intended) from us, and having us come back again because they were sweet to the birthday girl. To me, an investment of $3 or whatever one dessert costs them is way worth it, to have everyone feel that they did something nice for the birthday girl, and make everyone happy.As my friend remarked: ""I've lived 28 years in New York City and this is the first time a place has refused to serve dessert to the birthday girl on the house when she brought 10 people to the restaurant.""I can see both sides, but I narrowly side with my friend on this...",2.0
"Irish Joe sent us for the best brunch EVER! Wu tang came on while we waited for our food...sooo that was a plus! The food itself was worth the wait. It would be nice if they had bigger bottles of Pelligrino, but that didn't matter much once I had that french toast.That french toast was orgasmic, and I didn't want to share! The waiter's recommendation was spot on. I did have a little bit of my friend's Irish Breakfast, and that was delicious as well. It's basically a ""Bananas Foster"" French Toast with bacon and it's one of the best that I've had. It tasted as good as it looked!",5.0
"My wife, son and I met a friend and her boyfriend here yesterday for brunch. Maybe it's because the black walls, avant garde music (walked into a Communards tune), and clubby, in-the-know feel slightly reminded me of Downtown Beirut on 1st Ave. in the late 80s (only much more sanitary), or maybe I was giddy about being back in NYC, but I really loved this place. The Black Swan just oozes New York Groove. The staff couldn't have been genuinely friendlier. I was greeted by a friendly bartender and a guy who I'm fairly sure is the owner or manager. Our server, Fontaine, was excellent. She clearly enjoys her job - you can't fake her big, bright smile - and we really liked interacting with her. A photo of the signature Bloody Swan on aforementioned friend's FB page compelled me to venture into uncharted territory I grew up avoiding: Bed-Stuy. Just like me, though, the 'hood seems to have mellowed (just a scooch) over the years. I started with the Bloody Swan, a wonderfully spicy Bloody Mary garnished with a grilled shrimp, perfect strip of bacon, a pickled onion, a cornichon and a small cube of jalapeno Jack cheese. It's worth every penny of $10. Junior had a virgin version. He's 10. Bed-Stuy may no longer be the Thunderdome, but laws still apply. Wife and friends started with amazingly redolent coffee as black as the walls. Entrees were very good. The Black Swan, you see, is a gastro pub. Wife and I had Smoked Trout Hash served with fresh salad greens in a light vinaigrette ($11.95), son and friend had the Rum French Toast with Bananas and Bacon ($10.95) and her boyfriend had Eggs Bennie ($10). Everyone was pleased with their meal. We then moved on to a round of beers. The Swan has a wide range of draft and bottled craft beers from around the globe and around the corner at very reasonable prices, e.g. $5 for Belgian Blanche. I could have hung out and knocked down pints all day if not for having to drive back to Boston. By all means, go to The Black Swan. It's a 5-star neighborhood pub with a spirit all its own. Please let me know what you think about my review. Thanks!BTW, check out DMANBURGER'S blog post about The Swan: dmanburger.wordpress.com…",5.0
Ok I'll make this one quick. Black Swan almost as good as the movie. 2 happy hours!!!!!!!!!!!!The drinks are strong and cheap.The staff is good. Daniel was my waiter.

A number of times we tried the fried chicken appetizers with soy sauce and it was great. The drinks are always right on point!.

"Love Black Swan. I've been there a few times for dinner and once just for late night drinks. Always a good time.  The crowd is great... A nice mix of folks, not totally gentrified like some spots on Bedford. The food is heavy... But it's pub food, so it's supposed to be heavy. I've had the burger and the fish and chips. The burger was delish.. The fish and chips was good but too rich, I could only eat a little bit of it. Tasty drinks... decent wine list, and the bartenders are great. Tip: hot buttered rum really is just rum with about 3 big tablespoons of spiced butter... Maybe I'm the only one who didnt realize that? Delicious, but I couldn't drink more than a few sips...

Good selection of everything, and nice Happy Hour deals. I have to say I love the food - I've had the burger and (weirdly) several salads. For my money this is one of the best dinner salads in the area - fresh ingredients, nice flavor, good price. My husband hasn't been so lucky - he's tried a few specials, and the veggie curry pot pie and cottage pie in particular have been a disappointment. Not enough seasoning or flavor.Bottom line: if you're looking for basic bar food with maybe a bit of flair, solid drinks, and a great atmosphere - this will deliver on all fronts.",4.0

A nice mix of folks, not totally gentrified like some spots on Bedford. The food is heavy... But it's pub food, so it's supposed to be heavy. I've had the burger and the fish and chips. The burger was delish.. The fish and chips was good but too rich, I could only eat a little bit of it. Tasty drinks... decent wine list, and the bartenders are great. Tip: hot buttered rum really is just rum with about 3 big tablespoons of spiced butter... Maybe I'm the only one who didnt realize that? Delicious, but I couldn't drink more than a few sips... Because I don't love drinking butter.  Thankfully the bartender noticed my distaste and removed the cup-o-butter from the tab. Love that! Will totally be back",5.0

"Based on the meals and booze I've consumed here, I'd give this spot a 5. Based on my significant other's culinary exploits, however, I have to reserve a star.We live in the neighborhood and have been here a number of times. The space is nice, particularly in back when it opens up a bit; the bar can get very crowded and cramped if a big game is on.Drinks-wise, no complaints. Good selection of everything, and nice Happy Hour deals. I have to say I love the food - I've had the burger and (weirdly) several salads. For my money this is one of the best dinner salads in the area - fresh ingredients, nice flavor, good price. My husband hasn't been so lucky - he's tried a few specials, and the veggie curry pot pie and cottage pie in particular have been a disappointment. Not enough seasoning or flavor.Bottom line: if you're looking for basic bar food with maybe a bit of flair, solid drinks, and a great atmosphere - this will deliver on all fronts.",4.0
"A neighborhood fave but service is slow and sometimes very forgetful. The roast chicken is perfectly tender and the other foods on the menu (fish and chips, burger, fried chicken sandwich) are very good as well, as far as standard pub food goes. It gets pretty loud so not recommended for anything too intimate or a date with someone soft spoken.",3.0
"Ever since discovering Black Swan last year or maybe it was the year before its quickly become one of my favorite go to spots. It's become one of the beau and I's favorite date night locales and he's even hipped his best friend to it and the come often for their little homie pow-wows. I love the wood work of the few booths they have very kind of urban rustic. I always try to score one of these. This is another place where I think the service is impeccable. Most of the times we've dined here the owner has been there and been very personable, one time even getting us in and seated in the nick of time before the kitchen closed, so wouldn't leave and go somewhere else. That I thought was very cool.The original cocktails here are very good. They use a lot of ingredients that aren't overdone.

"Fried chicken sandwich. Get it. Flavorful and crispy but not so crispy that it falls out of the ciabatta and becomes chicken tenders instead. The B.Y.O Burger is a made to order item, but may I suggest bacon and bleu cheese with caramelized onions? Also order both types of fries. Shoestring plain or chunkier sweet potato - either way they went just fine with the sandwich and burger. It's one of the first really satisfying dinners I've had since moving to New York. Well worth the trip and cost.",4.0

"I was really looking forward to brunch. I was told that their chicken and waffles were amazing. So I go in really excited for their chicken and waffles. They didn't have chicken and waffles. That's where it fell apart for me. I was irrationally disappointed at that point, and it kind of ruined the rest of my brunch. I didn't see anything else that really caught my eye, I ended up getting just the eggs home fries toast and bacon. I will say this. The coffee was good. I had a fresh squeezed OJ too, which I was a little suspect of it actually being fresh squeezed. When my breakfast arrived, my toast was cold. So, no nice melty buttered toast. That to me is a simple thing. Also, the bacon was alright, but not great, and a meager two strips. The eggs were good and they had siracha, which made me happy. But the home fries were a small portion, and rather than nice pan fried well herbed potatoe and onion concoction, with a nice char on it, it looked just like bits of potatoes were thrown in an oven to bake and dry. Also, while the coffee was good, we needed to do a good bit of neck craning to get a refill. Maybe I was just soured by the fact that they didn't have what I wanted, but the lack of chicken and waffles, combined with cold toast, and other drawbacks, I had to drop a two star. I'll be going elsewhere for brunch in the future.",2.0

"Great for a late night bite! Went here on a random night last week and the place was pretty packed even though the weather was horrible. Got here around 11:30p and was a little surprised to see how many people were dining at this time. Ordered the veggie empanadas, burger and fries and everything was pretty good. The empanadas were full of black beans and nice chopped veggies, the burger was a good standard burger (i've had better). The bar scene was definitely jumpin', we left around 1a and it was still very, very crowded. Black Swan is the perfect neighborhood pub/restaurant to meet friends and grab some drinks. I want to try their brunch next, I hear it's great!",4.0

"The Black Swan is a great place to catch a quick bite and hang out for a pint -- whether you're looking for a late-night bite or a hangover-curing brunch.  I've been here for both occasions, and I'm generally impressed every time.In true English style, they have great pub fare, lots of beers on draft, and a great selection of cocktails.  It can get seriously loud in the evenings between the hipster crowd, the sports on the tellys, and the DJ playing its beats in the corner, so I wouldn't expect to have any soul-fulfilling conversations.Though the brunch wait can get ridiculously long, it's worth waiting to have the borough's best Bloody Mary -- not only is the drink tasty, they serve it with a seriously loaded skewer of cheese, olive, cornichon, shrimp, and a slice of bacon.  Holy sheeeeeit.  If that wasn't enough for you, the rum french toast is equally eye-opening at the first bite.  Hangover, what hangover?",4.0

"If I could give zero stars, I would. We went to Black Swan this afternoon to try and have lunch. I ordered a beer and a burger, medium rare. Over an hour later, my burger arrived cold, barely brown on the outside and completely raw on the inside. I tried to send it back to the kitchen, but the host/manager came over and indignantly insisted that my burger was properly cooked. Nope. He disappeared with it. After 15 more minutes and no burger, we asked for the check. No attempt to make it right, or offer me something to eat or even to keep my fries while they fixed the burger. This was after they made us linger for over half an hour for our drinks.  Actually, we had to ask for the check a few times. This used to be a great place, but seems to be suffering since they opened Beast of Bourbon. Never again, Black Swan.",1.0
"I've been to this place twice, both times on a wednesday night. Let's keep this short and simple, the food is pretty good for bar food(we didn't go to the dining area). I had the fried calamari and it's definitely a portion meant for a few. Let me rephrase, for the average human being who isn't part Sasquatch it is a portion meant for a few. I ate it all, like a boss. My friend had the wings and he said they were okay. Black Swan feels like a bar where everybody knows your name. It's kind of hipster so if you visit tell them your name is Blaine, or Joanne with a silent 'J' or something, to fit in. There are a lot of TVs so cancel your appointment to the chiropractor and, a lot of different beers to choose from(so keep your AA appointment). Oh yeah and, there apple cider is SO GOOD. I had it with rum and the other time with Brandy. So good. My only qualm is that the bartenders service is hit or miss. The girl who was working the bar, seemed a little inattentive but to her credit there were a lot of people there(but still). Other than that, grab a seat at the bar and hang out! OHHHHHH and they have two happy hour specials! 4-8 and 1-4am! Ballin'.",4.0

While the mac n cheese and wings have always been hit or miss (entirely dependent on the busyness of the restaurant - not busy=good, busy= variations of burnt/dry/meh), the Black Swan chop salad had become my reliable entree. I'm not sure when they implemented this cost-saving measure, but that salad has now been reduced to half its size, there's barely any chicken in it (and what's there is pre-cooked and dry), and the price went up 2 bucks to $14. It's a disappointment to say the least. I guess I'll stick to drinking. The beer selection is still great, and they make a good cocktail.",3.0

I had the Full English Breakfast and while the portion toprice ratio was phenomenal, the food was OK. My side order of mac and cheese with sindried tomatoes, though, was really really tasty.

I like this bar alot.  It's in the neighborhood and very low key vibe.  I was hanging out with a friend of mine earlier and stayed for 4 hours talking/chilling.  Good place!,4.0
"Love Love Love Black Swan! Hands down best jerk chicken wings in town that simply keeps it real! It's not good unless you're eating with a napkin for your runny nose! Sorry but I'm Caribbean!!My sister and I stumble into here almost once a week and stick to our usual lineup: -Jerk Chicken Wings-Black Swan Burger (with fries, you might as well)If we're feeling adventurous, we will include a third pick of something we've never tried before. The service is always on point and the food never disappointing. If you're waiting for a table, you can always grab a drink on the side and watch the chefs throw down in the kitchen. The beer menu is quite extensive which has something for everyone- I recommend the Boddingtons if you like Cream Ales*Definitely make it in here early for Brunch!",5.0
"Pluses : amazing DJ during dinner, great beer selection.Minuses: I remember loving their brunch a couple of years ago but went for dinner recently and the burger was flavorless and overcooked. Lobster also overcooked.",3.0
"Jerk wings and a happy hour drink at 1am, yes please! Quiet seating towards the back or enjoy a game on the big screen by the bar. Love love love Black Swan and their very cool relaxing vibe.",5.0

"I can't believe I've been living around the corner from this place since it has opened(years) and I have never eaten there until now. I had brunch with my girlfriends on a Friday afternoon... The service was great and they have so many specials they offer during the week. The food was on point... I ordered the chicken & waffles, my friend ordered the steak and eggs, and my other friend ordered a custom omelette with potatoes. When our food came out it was worth the wait. The color variation on the plate was so appetizing and everything tasted just as good as it looked. I'm looking for every reason to go back. Lol",4.0
"Nice place. A friend and I went here for dinner-- a year or so ago, I had passed by this place and it smelled delicious, so I finally decided to check it out. Against my heart, I ordered a mixed green salad. It was fairly inexpensive-- $7 or $8? I was not expecting a lot. And the restaurant smelled deliciously of meat and fish, so I was set on being disappointed. But holy wow, was I not disappointed. This salad was not only HUGE, but it had candied pecans that were ridiculously delicious, and amazingly creamy goat cheese. I have actually been craving this salad, that's how good it was.My friend got a salmon burger with some sweet potato fries-- also amazing. Both plates had huge portions and good flavor.My one qualm would be that it's a little dark, even with the TV screens on. It's a little loud too, but that's what's to be expected for the back of a pub. Definitely crowded, though. On a Friday night, there was a 15 minute wait-- which would be excellent for NYC, but I'm really not used to that in Bed Stuy. I guess it just shows the quality of the place.",4.0
"I live next door to the Black Swan and my partner and I go here several times a week. It's perfect for 2. The food is great and the drinks are pretty good too. Great beer selection. The fries are perfectly crispy. The burger is always done just right and is served on a very tasty bun. The Camden 7am is fantastic too - try it! I have  a suggestion for the owners/managers however: Please, please, please PLEASE get better seating! Holy hell the booths are so uncomfortable. I'm a very small person and the seats in the booths are too narrow. Right angles don't work for seating. The large picnic-style tables are ridiculously uncomfortable too. The surfaces are uneven and as a result someone's drink gets knocked over every couple of minutes. We would bring large groups to the restaurant all the time but because the seating is so terrible we often go out of our way to a place with a measly cocktail menu and subpar food just so we know we can be comfy. The few times I've made the mistake of going there and getting a booth I couldn't wait to leave.",4.0

"So, I stop in for a drink with some frequency. They have a pretty good beer selection, with a knowledgeable and accommodating staff, even when the joint is packed to the gills, which is from Thurs through to Sun, I have never waited more than a few minutes for a beer. They also have several different bar snacks, including British pub style crisps. Lovely. Another plus, they show most of the major soccer games.That was the good, the bad is that this place can get pretty packed, while that is good for business, it can make it awkward to just go there for a few beers, this isn't the owners fault, obviously they want the place to be packed, but I liked it better when the vibe was more laid back. Another bad, fairly inconsistent food, sometimes I have gone and had a fantastic meal, sometimes it's been god awful, I once had bangers and mash that were almost inedible, on the other hand, I had a burger here that was ridiculously good. The food can be good, but the quality seems inconsistent.",3.0
"First time at Black Swan. Went with my girlfriend for brunch. It definitely won't be my last time. The food was amazing. I ordered the Mac n cheese with jalapeños. OMG! Delish!!! Next time I'm going to try it with lobster. I also tried the Thai wings and the calamari. The wings were great and the calamari was good. My girlfriend ordered the French toast with bananas and that was delicious also. Service was good and drinks were tasty. We had bellinis, mimosas and wine. We sat there for hours and weren't rushed at all. I can't wait to go back. Run don't walk to Black Swan!",4.0
"I love this place! The bloody marys are great, as well as the beer selection. My favorite thing to get there is the burger. It's one of my late night comfort foods. When I leave work on the verge of crying at 12:30am I know I can call in a take out order and it will be ready for pick up usually within 15 minutes. The kitchen is open really late and the service is always friendly and knowledgable. So many reasons to like this place.",5.0
"Best Wings I've had in Brooklyn yet! The thai wings, you must try them. The other food there is very delicious as well. It's a gem in Bedstuy thats for sure.

"The Black Swan is at the outer eastern reaches of the score or so cask beer providers in Brooklyn.   I have been here a few times and they always have the same cask ale on tap.  Since that is the Sly Fox Chester County Bitter from PA that is no bad thing.   This has an appealing bite - it lives up to the bitter name (even tho' ""bitter"" was originally used in England to distinguish this style from the more common Mild Ale rather than 'cos it had any bitterness).  The other day the Sly Fox was a lovely pint of cool and refreshing beer.  The pub is like a cave - it seems to have no windows or natural light at all.   That said it's a real find and great as a refuge on hot and cold days alike.",4.0

"Black Swan is located on a stretch of Bedford (1.5 blocks from my apt) that has very little in the way of ""real food."" It's nearby competition is Kennedy Fried Chicken, KFC, some bodegas, and a very bad cafe. If fact, its a good 10 minute walk from Black Swan before you reach any other decent sit-down dining. This is not a snobby assertion or a judgement call its just fact. There is a lot of fast food in the area.Black Swan is a totally welcome reprise from the cheap greasy junk on the block. They have an amazing Bloody Mary. I want to say the best Bloody Mary EVER, but I don't know if I can commit to that. But it's surely in the top 3 of my life. There is bacon on top. It's spicy. It's not too watery or too thick or too boozy. I wish I had one right now actually.The salads are enormous. The burger is always cooked to the temp you ask for, which for some reason, a lot of restaurants can't get right. They carry a really great bottled cream soda that I appreciate. The onions rings are stupid delicious. A couple of dishes I have had over the last couple of years were Mehhh, but I can overlook them because the staples on the menu are great. The servers are always sweet and the bartenders are refreshingly humble and cordial, which is a rare find in NYC if you ask me. There is very little Attitude coming from the staff. There are a couple of things about the resto itself that could really use some attention, such and the weird mold situation up in one area of the ceiling, which my husband sort of obsesses about everytime we go there. The other issue is the bench seating which is so narrow that any woman with an ass cannot make it through a meal without feeling like her legs are falling asleep. DEEPER SEATS Y'ALL. Thankfully they have plenty of tables with normal sized chairs to sit at instead. Final note, the prices are super reasonable for the serving sizes. It's so often that I go out to eat and I walk away like ""How dare!"" when I realize what I ate in relation to what I paid. Black Swan gets claps for keeping me from feeling ripped off.",4.0

Also, I hate TVs.  I know it's their ""thing,"" supporting a footie team and all, but I feel safe saying in Brooklyn that I hate TV, sports and most of all, televised sports (that said, it wasn't loud and obnoxious, so the star docking is really on the menu issue as I really wanted that burger!!!).",4.0

Also, I hate TVs.  I know it's their ""thing,"" supporting a footie team and all, but I feel safe saying in Brooklyn that I hate TV, sports and most of all, televised sports (that said, it wasn't loud and obnoxious, so the star docking is really on the menu issue as I really wanted that burger!!!).",4.0

As for my drink I had a regular and a strawberry margarita, I prefer trying the strawberry because the regular was too tart for me. My server was ok, like he did his job...nothing beyond. The decor is a dim lightening, wood picnic like tables, not to big just right if you don't want a lot of noise. In all I would suggest this place as a decent pub to go have a meal. Oh and I read that they do a double happy hour from opening to 8pm, then from 12-2am (call just to make sure) but hey happy hour is always a good reason to try out a new pub lol.",3.0

"I come to this place fairly often, so feel a little like a Judas in that I'm giving it 3 stars. But, my simple review is: atmosphere and booze list is very good, only thing like it in the area and worth checking out. Crazy bloody mary's that are worth it. Their food however, is boring bar food--far from great. Mac and Cheese that others rave about seemed bland to me both times I ordered. Watermelon salad is matched with an overpowering dressing. Burger and Portabella burger are unmemorable. They have good onion rings and a somewhat interesting Brussels sprout side dish. I'd stick to it as a bar, but wouldn't go here to impress a foodie.",3.0
"A culinary gem in the neighborhood.  Nice bar scene (dark, sexy, classy, big selection of drinks) with a dining area in the back of the restaurant.Two people shared: Macaroni and Cheese with Bacon, and a HamburgerThe Mac 'n Cheese was fantastic - rich, creamy, savory, but not greasy. The hamburger was very good but completely overshadowed by the macaroni.  Sharing these two (plus the fries that came with the burger, and drinks) was more than enough for two people.Two people shared: Salad + Island Spiced Roasted ChickenThe salad was basic/expected, but the chicken looked delicious!  If I remember correctly it came with a side of plantains and something else tasty.  I was less impressed with the appetizers, though they were good ... we shared deviled eggs ($1 per egg half) and cod fritters.

"I enjoy the Black Swan. It's consistent and has good food and good beer and drink specials/options. Good, however, is the operative word.

The Bloody Mary's.The Bloody's are delicious and the beer chaser is a nice treat but keep in mind - it's a ""chaser"", not a beer ""back"" - which personally I think it should be. So you're basically getting a shot of beer rather than a pint.AND they do that annoying thing with 12oz Guinness glasses. Come on.

"If you want good food and a great happy hour deal (Thursdays have $12 bottomless margaritas) on a standard drink that's near impossible to mess up, not a bad choice. If you're looking for anything more out of your bar or dining experience, be sure to pregame to decrease the disappointment levels...Here's my spiel:I'll start by saying I liked the food a lot.

Upon asking for a ""strong, but girlie"" drink recommendation, the bartender suggested a shot of Jameson. When I told him that whiskey was not a traditionally girlie/ feminine drink, he took it very personally and refused or was unable to come up with any alternatives. The cocktails they have on their little bar signs all look (and the one I tried tasted) extremely unappetizing. On a different night, my boyfriend WROTE down the exact ingredients, and the portions, of a drink he thought I'd like, and it still came out terribly wrong (in that bartender's defense, they were short one ingredient and he had to be resourceful. Resources do not appear to be this bar's strong point).To top it all off, the last night I was there ended with one of the staff coming out and hitting on my friend and me.

"Love the craft beer selection, and usually the music. Most of the bartenders, too. Front area is too crowded at peak times, though, makes standing around the bar a pain in the ass. And I'm not feeling the $1.50 upsell to get cheese on my burger. Good food and drink at the end of the day.",3.0
"Great atmosphere.  Great beer selection, tons of great stuff on tap, constantly changing and adding new things.  Tons of TV's with sports playing at all times, but not obnoxiously like most sports bars.  For you football (not American football) fans, the owner (?) is a Tottenham fan (Go Spurs!) and so always has all the games and events going.  They also have English candy and sauces (HP sauce, flake bars, etc..) for all you Anglophiles.  It's a great place to go for beer and conversation, but also the food is pretty damn spot on.  It's not the best bar food I've had (only 4 stars) but certainly is good and filling.  The burgers are good, the steak is certainly good but occasionally overcooked in my experiences.  Mac & cheese with bacon isn't revolutionary but its comforting.  I'd say the price of the food hurts it a bit.  If it were a little cheaper, I think I'd be here way more often.A bit of a random thing, but their bathrooms are magically hidden in the walls and I've seen people try to find them, get totally frustrated, and just walk away.  Just press on the wall... I swear it will open.  If not, someone's in there so let them poo in peace.They have outdoor seating, but I've never made it out there.",4.0
":( The SLOW Swan?The brunch options were limited and a little boring. The ""blueberry"" muffin was actually citrus. Maybe that's why the lemon waffles didn't taste like citrus? because all of the lemons were used up in muffins?? Or used as a garnish on my friend's iced coffee? That confused the hell out of everyone. :'( The waitstaff was attentive, but the service was really slow. It took, like, 10 hours to get our cocktails. How the fuck do you cook chicken in less time than it takes to make a mimosa?! :'( And when my friend's mimosa arrived, it had a hair in it. If the bartender was getting a full weave, that would almost explain the delay. The fastest thing about this experience was the swarm of flies buzzing around our heads.

"I've been coming once every couple of months since it opened.When it opened I was totally excited.  A bar with a ton of cool beers and fancy bar grub in my neighborhood??  Times are a-changin'.The first 5 or 6 times I went I felt like the place didn't know what it was yet.  The music, the lighting, the service, kinda left me wondering.  Some nights the music would be blasting 80s rock and you'd have to shout to be heard, other nights it would be quiet country rock and the lights would be too bright.  Service can be spotty.I've been back recently and I think it's found it's groove.  Laid back bartenders who know their stuff.  It's a great place to meet up with friends and have some bar food and a couple of drinks.",3.0
"Love the craft beer selection, and usually the music. Most of the bartenders, too. Front area is too crowded at peak times, though, makes standing around the bar a pain in the ass. And I'm not feeling the $1.50 upsell to get cheese on my burger. Good food and drink at the end of the day.",3.0
"Great atmosphere.  Great beer selection, tons of great stuff on tap, constantly changing and adding new things.  Tons of TV's with sports playing at all times, but not obnoxiously like most sports bars.  For you football (not American football) fans, the owner (?) is a Tottenham fan (Go Spurs!) and so always has all the games and events going.  They also have English candy and sauces (HP sauce, flake bars, etc..) for all you Anglophiles.  It's a great place to go for beer and conversation, but also the food is pretty damn spot on.  It's not the best bar food I've had (only 4 stars) but certainly is good and filling.  The burgers are good, the steak is certainly good but occasionally overcooked in my experiences.  Mac & cheese with bacon isn't revolutionary but its comforting.  I'd say the price of the food hurts it a bit.  If it were a little cheaper, I think I'd be here way more often.A bit of a random thing, but their bathrooms are magically hidden in the walls and I've seen people try to find them, get totally frustrated, and just walk away.  Just press on the wall... I swear it will open.  If not, someone's in there so let them poo in peace.They have outdoor seating, but I've never made it out there.",4.0
":( The SLOW Swan?The brunch options were limited and a little boring. The ""blueberry"" muffin was actually citrus. Maybe that's why the lemon waffles didn't taste like citrus? because all of the lemons were used up in muffins?? Or used as a garnish on my friend's iced coffee? That confused the hell out of everyone. :'( The waitstaff was attentive, but the service was really slow. It took, like, 10 hours to get our cocktails. How the fuck do you cook chicken in less time than it takes to make a mimosa?! :'( And when my friend's mimosa arrived, it had a hair in it. If the bartender was getting a full weave, that would almost explain the delay. The fastest thing about this experience was the swarm of flies buzzing around our heads. Whatever you do, don't try to sit in the booth on the back wall closest to the kitchen... let's just say it's taken... :'( The food wasn't the worst. Please tell me this place opened 2 weeks ago.",2.0
"I stopped in here with a friend on a Thursday night, so it was pretty crowded, in a good way. There were a bunch of people at the bar upfront and tables in the back. Despite being really busy, the staff was extremely accommodating when we asked to switch our table....twice. It's great that they have outdoor seating, which is typically a huge plus for me, but, they were right -- it was small, loud, and filled with mosquitos. We moved back inside and ordered burgers and a giant salad. both delicious and very generous portions. They didn't rush us along either, which was great, so we stayed and hung out for a while.",4.0
Black Swan is indeed an awesome neighborhood bar and restaurant. The decor and lighting are great and the food is even better! I love their chicken and waffles for brunch and the mussels and fries appetizer is scrumptious. For a yummy filling snack try the jalapeño grilled cheese sandwich. The staff is also fantastic and super friendly. This includes the owner and manager who don't mind helping their staff at all when its busy. And it gets busy! They also have five HD tvs to watch sports and events on and great resident djs. But even when there's no DJ the music is fabulous. Id give it 6 stars if I could.

Tiny and doesn't seem worth the $8.  Attempted to go for their late night menu. Waited over an hour for food. Dude, I'm drunk and just wanna eat! No food listed on a late night menu should take AN HOUR to prepare! Tried my luck one last time for brunch. And boy did my luck run out! Over an hour AGAIN for eggs on a Saturday the dining room was a little less than half full (we had a table of 3 so I'm supposing our large party was too much to handle??) and they came stone cold. Calamari was soggy and undercooked. So you poached my eggs in ice water while slow-cooking my raw, deep fried calamari FOR AN HOUR??  FOR AN HOUR?! There's no reason any brunch food should take a hour to cook either no matter how many tables ordered before me! If your ""chef"" takes that long when he's not slammed, perhaps its time to find another one!

"Black Swan doesn't really need reviews, it's a beacon in a neighborhood without a lot of options. As a pub, they've got a good selection of beers (I don't drink beer) a terrible wine selection, but a great selection of classic or inspired cocktails. They're as expensive as manhattan ($12) but they're the size of a tankard. Good 'pub food' at the bar & they show soccer, which I appreciate. The problem is that they are kind of flippant with the tv (not like a sports bar with a sport focus & a schedule) so it just feels like someone randomly left the tv on & it gets way too loud to do anything but shout at the person next to you. Fun Monday-Friday drink or appetizer specials, but it's always crowded & loud. Nice dark atmosphere.

"I write very few reviews and try not to be a meanie bo-beanie when I do, but my husband and I were pretty disappointed with our brunch at Black Swan. The staff are very nice and attentive, the place has a good vibe and pleasantly skylit interior, and the Guinness was well-poured even if it came in Old Speckled Hen glasses (gasp!) However, the Full English Breakfast was just weird. Newfangled interpretations of traditions have their place, but only when actual improvements have been made on the standard. There were no improvements here that I could see, especially when it came to the baked beans that resembled a bean-tomato stew without even a hint of sweetness, and the meats that were almost impossible to guess what animal they came from. Full English and Irish Breakfasts are all about pork, pork, and more pork. I don't know if Black Swan wanted to make the breakfast more appealing to people who love meat but don't like pork, or if they just wanted to try their hand at an updated gastro-version, but the result is kind of a flop. The rashers (what should be back bacon) had me joking that they were human meat because they were white and soft instead of pink and crisply fried (are they steamed chicken? are they boiled beef?) and they tasted nothing like bacon. I knew ahead of time that the sausage would not be pork but chicken apple sausage, yet it was also soft and pallid instead of having a crispy skin that pops pleasantly when you cut into it (OK, they only give you half a sausage that's already been cut, but still). The black and white puddings did not have a crunch as they should, but were... yep, soft and gloopy. I also wasn't thrilled with the stewed grape tomatoes in place of a large, fried tomato slice, but that's a minor complaint. The eggs were cooked perfectly, though, and the toast and butter were quite tasty. I gave three stars because I haven't had any of their other food, so I feel like a jerk for taking them to task over one dish, but I really doubt I'd go back to Black Swan for more than pints in the future. I'll just have to hope St. Dymphna's in the East Village never closes and continues to serve their stellar Full Irish Breakfast until I might tragically develop a pork allergy.",3.0

"Not quite what I'd hoped it would be. Granted, The Black Swan is, as many will tell you, a welcome addition to a neighborhood that's almost entirely free of upscale bars and restaurants.  A good deal of money clearly went into the sweeping, modern space, which features a large pub-style front area, a full size restaurant dining room, and a small back patio.  But even though everything is done in dark, heavy wood stain, with impressively high ceilings, there's something just a bit tacky about it: wall to wall black ceiling fans and hi-tech speakers, slick, loungey design details that don't quite fit together, especially considering the ""pub"" billing.   (""Lounge-pub""? I don't think this works.)The beer list is a bit daunting in that it's weighted heavily towards German draft beer and esoteric bottled beers like Chimay, Sam Smith, a Framboise, etc., but all three tap beers we drank were unimpressive--faintly soapy, and either overly floral or too bitter, and served in the requisite (but annoying) proprietary giant mug or stein.  (They could certainly use a few go-to bottles, along the lines of Stella, Sierra Nevada, Brooklyn Lager, etc., that are dependably rich and tasty.) The bartender was knowledgable and patient, though, as we pestered him with questions about each beer.",2.0
"A nice, clean bar that's a great addition to the area.  The beer menu is amazing and the prices, though not dive bar cheap, are decent for the selection.I wouldn't order anything near closing time though.  I think the cooks just give up.  We once got calamari & fries that made me go crying back to Kennedy's fried foods.",4.0
"I walk and drive past this place all the time but didn't know or expect food to be served here. I first walked in and saw the bar, it was a bit dark. Huge selection of liquor displayed. Crowed was the typical gentrified new bedstuy. Who am I to Judge I'm a part of the new wave of so call yuppies moving into the area. Staff was extremely friendly which I liked, felt very welcomed here. The rear seating area was nice, laid back atmosphere. Food was great! This was my first time eating here so I can only vouch for the brunch. I ordered the Rum Raisin French Toast with bacon, I also had the eggs Benedict. The French toast was amazing! Mmm Mmm Mmm. The eggs Benedict was good, not amazing but good. I tasted the Lemon Waffles with Fried Chicken. The lemon waffles were good but I must admit the fried chicken could have been better. Forgive me but my Caribbean background has me spoiled. Our foods are very well seasoned and I've tasted better fried chicken. It wasn't horrible just needed a little more seasoning.  Again the staff was very friendly as I was walking out. I had very nice waitress who allowed me to make modifications to my order. I don't like Canadian bacon so I was able to switch it to regular bacon on my eggs Benedict.",5.0

I knew ahead of time that the sausage would not be pork but chicken apple sausage, yet it was also soft and pallid instead of having a crispy skin that pops pleasantly when you cut into it (OK, they only give you half a sausage that's already been cut, but still). The black and white puddings did not have a crunch as they should, but were... yep, soft and gloopy. I also wasn't thrilled with the stewed grape tomatoes in place of a large, fried tomato slice, but that's a minor complaint. The eggs were cooked perfectly, though, and the toast and butter were quite tasty. I gave three stars because I haven't had any of their other food, so I feel like a jerk for taking them to task over one dish, but I really doubt I'd go back to Black Swan for more than pints in the future. I'll just have to hope St. Dymphna's in the East Village never closes and continues to serve their stellar Full Irish Breakfast until I might tragically develop a pork allergy.",3.0
"My husband and I frequent this place a lot. Friendly bartenders, good beer selection, and really delicious burgers. I had brunch here for the first time (after having been 7-9 times before) and the bloody was unreal. The eggs Benedict were nothing special, but the service was WRETCHED. 15 minutes for water, 10 for a friend to get coffee, and my meal came out significantly later than the rest of the tables. I love Black Swan and we will keep going back, but will just avoid the tables and stick to the bar.",3.0

"Not quite what I'd hoped it would be. Granted, The Black Swan is, as many will tell you, a welcome addition to a neighborhood that's almost entirely free of upscale bars and restaurants.  A good deal of money clearly went into the sweeping, modern space, which features a large pub-style front area, a full size restaurant dining room, and a small back patio.  But even though everything is done in dark, heavy wood stain, with impressively high ceilings, there's something just a bit tacky about it: wall to wall black ceiling fans and hi-tech speakers, slick, loungey design details that don't quite fit together, especially considering the ""pub"" billing.   (""Lounge-pub""? I don't think this works.)The beer list is a bit daunting in that it's weighted heavily towards German draft beer and esoteric bottled beers like Chimay, Sam Smith, a Framboise, etc., but all three tap beers we drank were unimpressive--faintly soapy, and either overly floral or too bitter, and served in the requisite (but annoying) proprietary giant mug or stein.  (They could certainly use a few go-to bottles, along the lines of Stella, Sierra Nevada, Brooklyn Lager, etc., that are dependably rich and tasty.) The bartender was knowledgable and patient, though, as we pestered him with questions about each beer.",2.0
"A nice, clean bar that's a great addition to the area.  The beer menu is amazing and the prices, though not dive bar cheap, are decent for the selection.I wouldn't order anything near closing time though.  I think the cooks just give up.  We once got calamari & fries that made me go crying back to Kennedy's fried foods.",4.0
"I walk and drive past this place all the time but didn't know or expect food to be served here. I first walked in and saw the bar, it was a bit dark. Huge selection of liquor displayed. Crowed was the typical gentrified new bedstuy. Who am I to Judge I'm a part of the new wave of so call yuppies moving into the area. Staff was extremely friendly which I liked, felt very welcomed here. The rear seating area was nice, laid back atmosphere. Food was great! This was my first time eating here so I can only vouch for the brunch. I ordered the Rum Raisin French Toast with bacon, I also had the eggs Benedict. The French toast was amazing! Mmm Mmm Mmm. The eggs Benedict was good, not amazing but good. I tasted the Lemon Waffles with Fried Chicken. The lemon waffles were good but I must admit the fried chicken could have been better. Forgive me but my Caribbean background has me spoiled. Our foods are very well seasoned and I've tasted better fried chicken. It wasn't horrible just needed a little more seasoning.  Again the staff was very friendly as I was walking out. I had very nice waitress who allowed me to make modifications to my order. I don't like Canadian bacon so I was able to switch it to regular bacon on my eggs Benedict.",5.0
"I thought Black Swan was going to be a neighbor-hood gem, but unfortunately in a somewhat sketchy neighborhood, they do NOT offer a place to be comfortable and relaxed. I took my girlfriend here for a couple drinks and a late night snack. Upon receiving the bill (which lacked any detail), I asked the bartender to clarify how the charges broke down since it did not seem to add up. After asking him, he said that ""somehow"" a %20 percent gratuity was already added, and he will fix it for me if I would like. I believed it to be a mistake until the table next to me had the same issue 10 minutes after and I overheard. When I brought it up with the manager, she told me that they sometimes do this because they have been getting stiffed and they are upset. I may understand an 18% gratuity charged after a certian time in the night to avoid drunken idiots not tipping anything, but to not inform the customer about it so they tip AGIAN and they lie about it when asked is completly unethical. I will not be returning to this place and I caution anyone who is thinking of going to give one of the many other options a try. That was just my first expeience, who knows what else they are up to.",1.0

It seems that all of the drink prices are a bit high for the neighborhood. In addition, the gigantic TV is almost always flashing in your face and the music is inconsistently bad. Not good. Unfortunately, there have also been too many steamy days this summer where the air conditioner was turned off. Buzz kill.Food: Can be hit or miss, but the burgers rival some of the better in the area --which comes down to the quality meat and delicious sweet onion topping. Other dishes feature interesting West Indian/Caribbean flavors. It's obvious that there is indeed a serious cook trying to settle in to a new kitchen. Will be interesting to see if/how the menu progresses in coming months. Stay away from the below average late night menu. It's a huge disservice to the chef and serves as bad advertisement for the resto side.I hope Black Swan is listening to the critiques and that patrons can count on nothing but positive (yet minor) changes sooner than later.

It's a fixed price brunch, almost 17 per person including a beverage/cocktail, pastry or fruit, and a main.  The zucchini muffin was awesome! the fruit was good as well. I had a warm cup of coffee at all times, the service was excellent. For my main I had rum raisin french toast and two sunny side up eggs. Everything was great, our server was very nice and genuinely friendly which is refreshing. I had a great brunch and a nice end to my stay there...

Shani and I picked up the keys to her new place, and hit up Target to purchase various sundries and necessities. After leaving Target at 8:30 and lugging 6 bags full of apartment essentials onto the G train, both of us were famished and in dire need of a libation and sustenance. We were both pleased by the adorable waitress and her enthusiasm. Our drinks came promptly and we ordered food. Shani got 2 sides: bok choy and mashed plantains, I got a burger. Verdict? Her bok choy was amazing. I also really enjoyed my burger, especially the caramelized onions on top. It was cooked exactly to order: medium, with a side of salad. I felt that the portions were pretty generous. I picked off the bun, due to my wheat sensitivity, but I found the burger patty + mixed greens to be satisfying. I felt feeling full but not sick. So happy this place is next door to Shani B! We will happily return.",4.0
"Love their burgers (really tender and juicy) and their thin crispy french fries, and I'm also a big fan of the vegetable goat cheese wrap and BLT. They also have a good selection of beer, and the very reasonably priced Black Swan Seasonal was great (at least when I had it in late October). The ambience and service is pleasant, it never seems too crowded nor too desolate, and the music is never too loud, which is one pet peeve of mine at so many other bars (generally I like to be able to hear and speak without shouting). So glad they're in my neighborhood!",5.0
"I made a Yelp account just so I could review Black Swan!  Rarely do so many good things coalesce in a bar/restaurant: good location, cool decor/atmosphere, friendly and diverse crowd, really attentive and smart waitstaff (and bartenders, and bussers, and hosts!), the happy hour is boss and the food quality and prices totally great.  I felt really welcome, had a great time, and will keep going back!",5.0
"So, I've been to Black Swan several times. I find that the service is better for brunch. On one occasion, I went with two other people for dinner and the service was not too good. I felt bad for the waitstaff, she looked like she was overwhelmed, it's my neighborhood place and I was willing to work with it, but my companions were underwhelmed, to say the least. My most recent experience was more disappointing. Before I begin, let me write that the appetizers were good. For the main dish, I ordered the Salmon BLT, which came without bacon or tomato. Yes, a ""BLT"" without bacon or tomato. It did have avocado though. At $18, I want the bacon. I had to ask for it. The salmon was too crispy on the outside. I know it is supposed to be blackened, but it was too dry. The salad that came with it was mismatched. It looked like they took baby greens and mixed it with head-a-lettuce. Give me one or the other. Moreover, the salad tasted like it had been sitting in a lot of oil for hours. They were generous with the salad, but It wasn't good at all, very oily. One of my companions had the hangar steak. I took a piece of it and it took me so long to chew that one piece, that I took the remaining small piece home and gave it to my dog. He enjoyed it. It tasted OK, but just not tender enough for me to chew. Not worth the effort. I don't like to waste food, but after the whole bacon debacle, I wasn't in the mood to chew one bit of steak for ten minutes. I don't know why, but two of us had stomach's that grumbled all night long after we got home. I am not sure what the vibe is supposed to be in this place. Is it a sports bar? Is it a restaurant? Why was the music so loud on a Sunday night? I know the game was on, but it was so distracting. And the public sink area outside the bathroom- why is it so damn dark? You can't even see where the faucet is to turn on the water to wash your hands.I don't know what is happening here; there is some competition creeping up in the neighborhood. I'm not sure if I'm feelin' it anymore.",3.0

"I stopped in a week after opening, and it was quite impressive upon walking in. The  interior is impeccable and tasteful. Drink selection is sublime. When it came to food, the menu only had a handful of items on it, so I ended up ordering the burger - which was not what I even felt like eating, but it was the only thing on the menu that was appealing. The waitstaff tends to your every need, and is eager to please, which is a very nice change!",3.0
"Just caught my first World Cup game at the Swan and I liked what it had to offer!  No food, just beers, Jameson, and martinis like any Wednesday afternoon should be spent, right?  For the World Cup especially I liked what it had to offer; really tied the neighborhood together for the most part and I dig that.  The decor is very dope, great ambiance, great beer list, and the food looked good as well.  When I return this review may raise .5 b/c I do plan on eating :)*I ate there and my review is the same.  I enjoyed my Spicy Thai wings, the Mac N' Cheese was decent, I heard it was better before.  One thing I would say is they need to be a bit more cognizant of the bartenders they hire because the one I encountered certainly could use a brush-up.",4.0

"Recently went on a trip to NY and while staying at a friend's place in Brooklyn, decided to try this place for Sunday brunch because it was a short walk and the menu looked interesting. It's a fixed price brunch, almost 17 per person including a beverage/cocktail, pastry or fruit, and a main.  The zucchini muffin was awesome! the fruit was good as well. I had a warm cup of coffee at all times, the service was excellent. For my main I had rum raisin french toast and two sunny side up eggs. Everything was great, our server was very nice and genuinely friendly which is refreshing. I had a great brunch and a nice end to my stay there... Next time I'm up in NY I will definitely try to stop by again. PS The mimosas would be a lot better with fresh squeezed OJ ;)",4.0

"I just moved in next door and this place was my life force while I was unpacking and unable to cook. I think the Swan may have even swayed my decision a bit to take the apartment after having an IPA first before seeing it. For brunch we tried the lemon waffles with fried chicken which was really good and the salmon BLT. The bacon was amazing. The best part of brunch was The Bloody Swan, a bloody mary loaded with goodies- cheese, bacon, olives. pickles (almost Wisconsin bloody mary style, just missing the beer chaser). I guess for $10 the bloodies should be good. Maybe it was because we were sitting at a table in the back corner, but the service wasn't the greatest. The other times I have eaten there have been at the bar and no problem there. I've also tried the portabella sandwich and the man n'cheese. Good music and good drink specials through out the week.

The full english is pretty damn close to the real thing and the mac and cheese with bacon will definitely give you a boner.The place is simple and intimate and the wait staff is always accommodating.

But when you ask about it, they suggest something else and make the house wine sound like garbage they wouldn't drink themselves.

We returned for the opening, and were part of an unpretentious, diverse, grown-up crowd enjoying the brews and food. The decor consists of black wood panels over brick (visible above and below), recessed lighting, copper counters -- beautiful, well-crafted and unfussy.

"This is my favorite bar in Brooklyn maybe in all of NYC. The atmosphere is magnificently tranquil yet the bar is vibrant in its music selection (the clash, the talking heads).  There's tons of beers, $4 happy hour cocktails, and the bartenders are friendly and attentive.  The food is delicious and influenced from several diverse cultures.  Try their portabella and goat cheese sandwich it's amazingly good.  I really enjoy this place for the environment, they were able to seat myself and 5 others for my girlfriends birthday last minute and were friendly about doing it.  Now that's service.",5.0
"TOO SALTY.  Everything we've tried on the menu makes us go home and crave water all night.  We actually get up at night for more water.  Food: our evaluation on items we had are as follows, and add ""too salty"" for each of these: fried oysters - yum, but saltybaby rocket salad - not bad, but not exciting, saltyfries - bad, saltyjerk pork chops - my boyfriend said 'best he's ever had' but a bit saltycod fritters - not bad, saltyturkey chili - extremely salty, asked for extra onions and they brought out cooked onions.  cornbread with it was blahburger - good bun, tasty meat (med-rare) but it falls apart, saltychicken wings - pretty good, saltycalamari - not bad, not too chewy, lightly battered, saltybok choy side - saltysalmon blt - not bad, saltysoup du jour - colddrinks: good, but only had beer.  they have good drink prices specialsservice: SLOW and confused.TV: totally agree with the review on world cup central; spot on.Overall atmosphere: it's a good neighborhood bar with decent beer that's lacking in that neighborhood.  It has a good ""bar"" appeal, it's dark, dark wood furniture. A bit on the expensive side for the food.  I hope they improve the food and service.",2.0
"Chef Adam is great, not afraid of spices and seasoning! The bartenders are cool, I've experienced 3 of them.  The meals I have had (chili, roasted chicken) were good.  They are very accommodating of your meal preference. I  went one Saturday, forgetting it was brunch time,  craving chili (not on the Brunch menu as an entree) and the bartender asked and the chef made it happen.  It didn't have the consistency of the chili I fell in love with, but it the flavor was still pretty good.  I will definitely be back, MUST try that rum french toast!",4.0

"This place is great! Newly opened- it doesn't totally fit in the neighborhood, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. The food is good, the decor is great- the staff is friendly and I especially like the brunch here. I would just say that coming to eat here while in a time crunch may be risky. Of the 4 times I've eaten here, I would say that 3 of them took a bit Long. NOT saying I minded, i didn't, but if i was in a hurry, I would have been stressing. However, to their defense, all servers either explained the delay or at least acknowlegded/apoligized for it.",4.0
"The food is bad (you would think it'd be hard to mess up eggs, but Black Swan succeeded in making them disgusting), and the service is TERRIBLE.

"I happened to pass by the day before the opening, and walked in to have a look. My companions, former pub owners from Dublin, loved the place. We were given a tour by someone who was not the owner -- and who was unnecessarily humble, because it turns out she's the chef! We returned for the opening, and were part of an unpretentious, diverse, grown-up crowd enjoying the brews and food. The decor consists of black wood panels over brick (visible above and below), recessed lighting, copper counters -- beautiful, well-crafted and unfussy. I noticed no art on the walls: the patrons ARE the art. The music is fine.Chef's codfish fritters are little clouds of yummy! This is my new favorite place.",5.0

"Some friends and I randomly stopped by this place last night after committing to trying new bars. Good choice! They have a great beer selection and I was even more impressed, since I'm an avid cider drinker, to find out that they had 2 types of cider on the menu.

There was a pretty nice, diverse crowd, which I certainly appreciate in a bar.  I think I even saw CL Smooth - the rapper- there, but my eyes could be tricking me. The bar set-up is long, narrow and a bit awkward, but definitely doable. It seems like the restaurant section was in the back , but I never ventured there. The kitchen is open late which is a major bonus. The music was OK as well. I did feel as though things seem to die down pretty early. It was 1 am on a Saturday when I left and the crowd was thinning out rather quickly. This is a pretty laid back bar.

Apple tart was light and flakey and not too much. Nice way to end a belly increasing meal. We're stoked though to have a local spot that we can call home. The chef, Sophia, is super cool, and I'm psyched that she's at the helm.",4.0

"Tasty brunch, poor service. But I don't mind a little extra time at the table with my girls, so if they let the check hang out for a while, I'm cool.

"I was visiting new york and happen to be staying in Brooklyn one of the nights, a friend had recommended i check out the black swan. At first i was a little irritated because the location of this place was much further then i had expected it to be from where i was staying, then on top of the when my car service pulled up there i was even debating about not going at all based on the location that it was, yes it is in some what of a bad neighborhood. I figured since i went all this way i had to at least go in and check out the place. When i came in i was pleasantly surprised!!!!! The swan had a great vibe to it, the decor was really fitting and made it unique and it had the feel of a bar you go find in the middle of manhatten. I sat at the bar so i could watch the college football game that was, the bartender was great. Very attentive and  had a great sense of humor. I had a couple of appetizers and the food was not only good but the portions were good size also. I got so full on the apps i never bothered order the burger like i had originally planned to. After a few drinks i had forgotten on how annoyed i was about getting to the place. Def recommend checking this place out if you are in the area!",5.0
"It is just OK. After I ordered my drinks, but before he even started making them, the bartender asked me if it would be cash or charge. Huh? Does it matter. Food is overpriced (8 for $8 wings!) , but the crowd seems to like it.  I'll try it twice more.",2.0
I would definitely go back here. Came here with my girls after a wonderful wine tasting at Melt. We wanted to have another drink or 4...and chose this spot. Very nice place.

"Decor - 4 stars, service 3 stars, food 2 stars and PRICE 1 star!! Damn, this place is pricey for what they served. They better up their serving size and side garnish before they go out of business.Fried Calamari (frozen calamari pieces,thawed,fried) - $8 for a small (I mean small) serving. I have been to restaurants in Manhattan charging at this price but their serving was plentiful. Black Swan burger - $12 with 2 additions (cheese and avocado) came up to $16 - and literally 1 piece of slice tomato and one leaf of lettuce. C'mon Black Swan - you can do better than that!The buns used for the burgers are Barbie doll size - read it any way you want. Felt robbed again!!White wine is served in a miniature glass for $7???? WTF???This place needs to present a more substantial serving for both food and wine if they want to stay in business. Not going back there anytime soon. There are better places in Bed Stuy to go to !

If you live in Bed-Stuy this place is a must.",4.0
"I was ecstatic to find this gem in my not so Clinton Hill neighborhood.  The food is delicious (I LOVE the spicy garlic shrimp!) and the staff is super friendly.  They've got an extensive list of beers on tap, as well as awesome mixed drink concoctions.  Give it a try!  You will not be disappointed!",4.0

"Spread the word! This place is absolutely disgusting and by far has a combination of some of the worst wait staff, food, atmosphere, drinks, and air. Yes, air. I've been a number of times to support new local business and really wanted to give it a shot, but each time I went, I found it to be a terrible experience. Once there were more flies circling my table than people sitting there! I think it's because their door is always open. The bar always smells, feels and looks unkempt - isn't part of bartending 101 keeping a clean and nice bar for customers? I've always left there with smudge from the bar on my arm. The other day the bartender poured a glass of Boddington's and it was just foam. It took five minutes to turn into beer, and when it did, it was flat. When I nicely told him he said that was unlikely since he had just changed the keg. He tasted it, ""oh i guess it is flat."" Instead of asking if I wanted another one, he left and went downstairs, came back and said the pressure wasn't fastened right. He then was nice enough to give me a Founders (not flat) with a side of attitude. As for eating, the food isn't the worst, but it's not the best. I think they're really trying to be a staple hangout, hipster, local bar, but really aren't doing a good job at it. The wait staff are not very attendant, the food always takes forever. Two times ago my mimosa was served with a kinky hair on the rim of the glass, hopefully not pubic, but I wouldn't doubt it. Generally I have been there 4 times, and each time failed failed failed. As much as I want to support local business, this is hardly about supporting the community - it's seems way more like someone coming in as a guest in the neighborhood, paying little to no attention about what locals might be looking for in a bar. I know nothing about the owners though, so I can't just assume they are white yuppie-hipsters genrifying the neighborhood anymore, but that's definitely the message it sends. Ga-ross.",1.0
"I would give this nasty, HORRIBLE Owner and his restaurant ZERO stars if I could!!! This is long overdue but on May 13th I(alone) was nearly attacked by a group of 5 young girls and a young man and this Owner turned the police assistance I summoned via 911 away twice stating that the situation was resolved, and then that I had left the premises. Fortunately for me, one of these young girls identified herself as having a ""badge"" and when that was reported by me to 911 they did not stop calling me until they had all the facts straight. Meanwhile I was still in a dinner meeting with an elder gent at the rear of the restaurant. Prior to this I was a regular, watching most sports matches and having several dinner meetings here. And enjoying the cuisine, albeit the chef seemed picky at times about substitutions or ordering a choco chip cookie too late for his taste. I have NEVER returned to the BS of BS, never will. Watch out for yourself(ves), this Owner will sacrifice your safety for his reputation. That same night two girls who just left BS(yes, pun intended) also had a fight in front of the establishment with small children present. BS did nothing. Perfect example of ghetto-wannabes... So many other better places less than a mile away.",1.0
