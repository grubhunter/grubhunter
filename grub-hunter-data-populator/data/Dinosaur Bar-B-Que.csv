"First time coming to this location....Everything from the food to the space was spot on, and really enjoyed every part of my dish.Decided to try catfish for the first time which ended up being a great decision. The fish was a bit too over-fried, but was slamming nonetheless, and BBQ beans and mac & cheese sides did not disappoint.Cornbread was good, and the drink and beer menu was pretty respectable.Solid BBQ, and never a bad choice.",4.0
"I heard a lot of recommendations for this place, and decide to venture out here before a rock climbing session at Brooklyn Boulders for some fuel.There was about a 25 minute wait for a table for two, and the hostess took down our number to text us when our table is ready. I appreciate this extra accommodation instead of being stuck waiting around the restaurant the whole time.The service was decent, it was busy (or so it seem like) because our requested table outside took about 15 minutes to clean and we were stuck waiting until we received our menu. Our waiter answered our questions regarding portion size and recommended us an appetizer with our choose 3 special - we choose the shrimp, ribs and lamb shoulders. The food and taste was very mediocre, I could have better from Outback.Overall, I was not impress at all and would not be going back for a second experience.",2.0
"I've been to Dino BBQ many times (few different locations including the original in Syracuse) but I feel that I don't get as excited about it as I used to.It's a really cool atmosphere here and is always crowded. A great place to come with a group of friends. I've tried about everything here. I personally love the pulled pork and the ribs deliciously fall off the bone. There's some good flavor here. Good selection of sides too.The downside here is the size: the last time I came here, the ribs were small. I'm all about big portions and the prices just don't reflect that. Also, the chicken is nothing to be excited about.Back to the upside: the beer menu is solid and actually fairly priced. Service is quick and the staff is friendly. Love the sauces (try the ""wango tango"").I know I'll be back.",4.0
"I have been to the Dinosaur BBQ in Buffalo, NY when they first opened, and this is the first time I visited this location in Brooklyn. I tried to call this place a million times to try to make a reservation, but no one ever pick up the phone.The wait was about 45 minutes on a Saturday night. This is a pretty big location with a full bar, but the bar was super packed too. I like the setting of the restaurant, very southern bbq-ey.I ordered the house special, 1/4 rack of ribs and 1/4 chicken. The ribs were just ok, nothing special. But I have to give it to the chicken, it was crispy and juicy, they made it fresh so that even the chicken breast stayed soft and juicy. I also tried the beef brisket, the beef was tender and juicy, their house bbq sauce is a little too sweet for me. Not a fan. Overall, I think Dinosaur BBQ was just ok, it is slightly overrated and overprice.",3.0
"I came here a few weeks ago which is a complete shame because...I used to live in Rochester, but stupidly never took advantage of one of Rochester's greatest offering (maybe only offering - just kidding).This place is well known everywhere and everyone should come here once just for the experience, and their BBQ sauces are just downright amazing by the bottle.This is a good set-up and location.  Bear in mind, I have nothing to compare this to because I normally do not frequent BBQ establishments.  In terms of dining, it's a lively and not too loud place with tons of space - and the service was decent.Given I have never been to a BBQ place, I just didn't know how plates worked.  Because I wasn't too hungry, I ended up ordering the 1/4 rack of ribs with 2 sides (fries and coleslaw I believe).  Delicious food - not food porn worthy - I mean it was a messy meal but that's the intention!  I felt elated almost like Frank Underwood but not really. Definitely would come again!",4.0
"I finally got a chance to try this place out after hearing about it for years. We had to wait about 10 minutes to get seated but the service was good despite them being busy on a Saturday afternoon. This was honestly one of the most satisfying meals I've ever had. I got the half bird with mac n' cheese and collard greens. It also came with a small corn muffin. The flavors were so on point and it was some of the best comfort food I've had. Despite being full, I just wanted to keep eating because it all tasted so good! I also had a vodka soda which was decently strong for the cheap happy hour price of $6. All in all, this is a great place and I'd love to come back to try some more dishes!",5.0
"Going to school in Rochester, still get pines for Dino BBQ here and there. Not the best barbecue ever (that's the Midwest), yet always a decent meal whenever I stop by. First time in the Brooklyn location and moderate wait on a late Saturday afternoon, happy hour at the bar kept us satisfied though.Wanted as much meat as humanly possible. Settled on the Pick Three Combo ($22) - 1/2 chicken, St Louis ribs, and lamb shoulder. This monstrosity of indulgence is served with a cornbread muffin, and personally selected potato salad and mac&cheese. Ribs are good - not quite ""falling off the bone"", but still a good flavor and excellent with the side sauces. Chicken is moist and flavorful. Lamb shoulder is okay and served on a bed of rice/salsa which is seasoned well. Sides were too filling to pair with the meal, so I gave most of it to my vegetarian friend (yea I know). The cornbread/mac&cheese is your standard fair, but the potato salad is bomb.Service here is up and down. They're completely bombarded by the crowds and the size of the place. Got my meal right, though missed a couple things with my friends dishes. Not big of a deal; just don't expect quick turnaround here. I really enjoyed the food here, and I'm not comparing it to the best spots for BBQ; it's solid eating.",4.0
"Almost had a decent experience here. We were there last night and it started out alright. The food was decent. Had combo platters which we selected lamb shoulder, pulled pork, ribs and chicken. We wanted brisket but they told us they had ran out roughly 10 minutes after we had already placed our order, not a big deal, we understand that can happen. The BBQ was good for New York standards. I'm from near Memphis so I have pretty high standards. This was an acceptable substitute until I can get back home to the good stuff. The sides were okay, nothing amazing, but decent to accompany the smoked meats. The portions were good size and we definitely left full. The service was meh, at best. No one checked on us after we received our food. We didn't have water refills or drink refills, but they were very quick to get our check when we were done. Seems about right.Then things got interesting. After paying our bill with credit cards and tipping (we had split it), we requested an Uber and it had arrived outside so we were walking down the street a bit to get it and the waitress chased us down outside and said we had to come back inside because she messed something up with the the check. She didn't explain to us what was wrong, but said it and insisted we come back inside. So while our car is waiting outside, we follow her back inside and she takes us to the back ""take out"" counter where who we're assuming was a manager (an African American man with dreads) was standing there and basically ignoring us while the waitress was standing there looking down at a stack of checks. She apparently was explaining to him what she messed up on but they would never communicate to us what was wrong while we were asking. We stood there for 5-10 minutes while they were talking and looking at stuff and we finally insisted they hurry up and tell us what is going on because we have a car outside and had other plans. The manager very rudely snapped at us and said ""We're working on it!"" with such a nasty look on his face. At that point we got very angry at his rudeness and demanded they tell us something because we weren't staying there any longer. We wanted to know if we had over or underpaid, or anything. After demanding an answer, Apparently the waitress charged our cards to pay for someone else's check  instead of our bill which she had brought out to our table and we had overpaid by a small amount. If they had told us something initially, we would have been fine, because we didn't care about the small amount of money that they overcharged our cards as we were just trying to leave because we had a car outside and other plans. We were very angry about the rudeness of this manager. Back outside, our uber cancelled on us and left, for which we'll probably be charged because it was over the time limit and we had to wait 20 minutes for another one. In summary, they messed up, chased us down in the street, overcharged our credit cards and then got rude and snapped at us when we wanted to know what was going on. Terrible customer service and terrible ending to a decent experience at Dinosaur BBQ.",1.0
"To the point, it's not bbq. Lacks smoke flavor, meat is tough yet still fall off the bone indicates boiled then charred on the grill. I've had bbq in texas, arizona, new York so I've had quite the sampling across the nation to make this conclusion. But was it bad? No. Filled me up and that's that",3.0
"Sure, the Wango Tango Wings are in my top 5 wings of all time... but those wings are not enough to save this place for me. Read below for the details.APPETIZERSThe wings are plump and yummmmy. That is all. Order 2 large orders, and you will be a happy camper. The fried green tomatoes are also above average. The nachos, however, are just okay--that is, small-ish for sharing and not very flavorful. They could definitely be piled a bit higher and come with more meat.ENTRÉES Ribs are generally the highlight of BBQ joints for me, but Dinosaur BBQ's ribs were a bit skimpy (not much meat on each bone) and fattier than most other BBQ places around. The burger with green chilis was quite good (I shared it, and we ordered it medium rare). It was definitely tender and tasty. However, one of the other diners in our party ordered their burger medium, and the meat was way over cooked, dry, and tasteless.SIDESAll of the sides are super bland--avoid the black-eyed peas, mac & cheese, collard greens, and baked beans. All of them are super disappointing.DRINKSThe drinks are fine and reasonably priced for the area. I tried the on-tap Malbec wine and Apricot Old Fashioned. The Malbec was good, but the Old Fashioned was a bit too sweet.SERVICESlow, slow, slow. The guy was nice enough, but, honestly, the restaurant was not even that busy... I expected better service for sure.I probably will not go back except to order appetizers (yes to the wings) and get drinks. I'll stick to Mighty Quinn's for real BBQ.",2.0
"Stopped here with a couple friends last night for huge bbq meal. We got exactly what we wanted. Ordered 2 family platters which consist of ribs, chicken, brisket, cornbread, and multiple sides. We were overly stuffed! It was a saturday night and the wait time wasn't too bad, given that we only waited about a hour for a table of 6. The food overall was good, not much of a strong bbq taste to it but if you use their habenero bbq sauce, it solves everything.

"It saddens me to have to write another review for dinosaur, not only am I the number one person who comes here, but I've also been a loyal customer since the Harlem location, when they were coming to my neighborhood Park Slope I couldn't be happier that I no longer have to drive to Harlem, we were even there for opening day. Things were wonderful the first couple of months, I would come in for lunch & dinner, and I loved that you can make reservations, unlike the hours of waiting at the Harlem location. I really waited a couple of time before actually complaining, or better yet updating my review. I don't feel like writing a horrible review because of ONE thing, but it has been a couple, and last night was basically it for me. First....we order delivery from them a lot, and every time it comes COLD, we enjoy the skirt steak, and we always have to put it in the microwave to warm it up, which to me is gross, I really don't live that far Second...came here a couple of times for lunch, happy that they added poutine fries to the menu, and to my surprise they ran out of gravy, which means I couldn't have the mash potatoes either. That happened twice, they were also out of something else, can't remember what it was. Last night....it was empty, day before thanksgiving, we were seated right away, waitress came over took our drink orders, while sitting there, I was freezing, I noticed the doors wide open, I ask a worker if he can please close them or put some heat on, he says sure, walks away, nothing was done....so I sat there freezing. So we decided to just order appetizers because just two days ago we had dinosaur, we ordered the poutine fries, because I've been dying to try them, wings, as usual, a cheeseburger slider, and a pulled pork slider....So the food comes out, and this is where it went down hill, the wings were cold, like really really cold that you can't eat them. My pulled pork slider, also cold, I let the waitress know, she basically grabbed the plates and walked away, no apology, no I'm sorry I will get you a new one. So we basically sat there eating the fries until the rest came back out, when the wings came back out they were hot, but they weren't the good delicious, big, finger licking dinosaur wings I remember! Actually I took one bite, and didn't want to eat anymore. Plus they were half the size of the dinosaur wings we usually get. I call over the waitress, because it's not like she comes to check up on us, and ask if if they changed the recipe, she says it looks like they forgot to put the usual ""rub"" on them. She basically takes them back because by this time I've had enough, I don't want them, and I'm not paying for something we didn't eat. The pulled pork came back, and was hot this time, but DRY! Plus the bun it was on wasn't that good. By the end of it, the wings, and Pepsi were basically taken off the bill, we basically went to pig out, and only ate the poutine fries, which were good. I'm just extremely disappointed in dinosaur, they had it all together when they first opened, I have no idea what has happened, maybe the fact that all the employees are teenagers? Who knows....",2.0

"While it was not the best barbecue I have ever had (that would be between the Rib Crib in Germantown, PA and home smokes ones from the late AB Johnson, I would go back. The ribs were exceptionally good and the brisket a little fatty, but still worth ordering. As for the sides, the fried rice was amazing...full of meats and very tasty. We also had coleslaw and fries that were quite good. Crispy fries and coleslaw that was not soggy! The mac and cheese was a bit heavy and arrived cold. Our server, while not attentive, was quite friendly and replaced it with warmer (not hot) mac 'n' cheese.  Finally, Louise, stay away from their bathrooms (see pic)!",4.0
"I'm glad DinoBBQ came to Brooklyn. Years ago, travelling from BK to BX was way too tiresome and far. DinoBBQ gets really packed on weekend nights. I came here on a Sunday afternoon and we were seated immediately. My fiancé and I came famished on an empty stomach. I settled with the Swag sampler plate and Sweetheart deal for 2--a bit of binge ordering I must say. I was surprised to see people who sat after us get their food first. Our waitress must have forgotten to put our order in, but she was apologetic and reassured us our food was coming soon.Swag Sampler Plate for Two $12.95 - Contains 4 pieces of drunken spicy shrimp boil (cold), 2 chicken wings, 2 fried green tomatoes, and 2 deviled eggs (halves). I enjoyed the wings (mango tango flavor) and the deviled eggs. The fried green tomatoes and shrimp were meh. I'd definitely skip this meal if you are sharing the sweetheart deal. Once again, binge ordering on an empty stomach. Sweetheart Deal $32 - I usually get this deal because we love ribs, and the portions are huge. This is more of the unbuckle-your-belt deal for 2. You get a full rack of ribs, 2 corn breads, and 4 side dishes. I chose mac & cheese, collard greens with smoky turkey, A.K. chili with cheese, and BBQ beans with pork. Mac & cheese did not taste that fresh, collard greens were a bit sour, but the BBQ beans and chili were great. I'd definitely get the beans and chili next time around. BBQ ribs fell off the bone. Be sure to pair it with the original DinoBBQ sauce or the mango tango if you can handle some spice. We ended up packing half a rack of ribs home.The sweetheart deal is so worth it if you're a rib lover and want to try out their sides. Not a bad deal if you're sharing either.",4.0
The wait on Saturday night is so long ! We had to to wait about 65 minutes for a table for two. The food came really quickly and you get a lot for the price . I enjoyed the sides the most ( mac and cheese and mashed potatoes ) . The 1/4 of chicken was a bit cold when I got it and the 1/4 ribs were really good . Our waiter was nice and friendly. I would still go back and try something different on the menu . Overall this visit was about 3 stars .,3.0

"My friends and I got the Sweetheart Combo, which included a full rack of ribs and four sides. We got mac and cheese, mash potatoes, potato salad, BBQ fried rice, and fries. To be honest, I was honestly disappointed by the sides, the mac & cheese and mash potatoes were hard and stuck together in big pieces like they been sitting around for a really long time. The potato salad was pretty good though. I haven't tried the BBQ fried rice but it looked good. The fries were fine and the cornbreads too. The ribs were kind of bland but were really soft and easy to cut, I think it was pretty good though.  I feel like this combo is definitely worth the price, none of us were able to finish our share!",3.0
Great atmosphere. We went as a group of 6 (with 2 kids). Food was yummy. Not too hot when it was served. The bbq rice was great. Mac and cheese was at best ok. Mashed with gravy was delicious. Ribs were very well seasoned.  Corn bread was ok. Service was a little slow. Waitress didn't seem too enthused but i would go back.,3.0
"I've heard a lot of good things about Dinosaur Bar-B-Que, so I was very excited when we were looking for a place to eat and came across this restaurant.The place is huge, so there's a lot of seating. We were seated quickly on a Friday night, even though the place was busy.I ordered the Drunken Spicy Shrimp Boil to start. I'm normally not a fan of shrimp cocktail, but this was very flavorful. The habanero cocktail sauce went with the shrimp perfectly.I had the Skirt Steak for my entrée. It tasted good but it was a little overly cooked. Still the flavors were pretty good. I ordered French fries and mac & cheese as sides, but I wasn't fond of either.",3.0
"It saddens me to have to write another review for dinosaur, not only am I the number one person who comes here, but I've also been a loyal customer since the Harlem location, when they were coming to my neighborhood Park Slope I couldn't be happier that I no longer have to drive to Harlem, we were even there for opening day. Things were wonderful the first couple of months, I would come in for lunch & dinner, and I loved that you can make reservations, unlike the hours of waiting at the Harlem location. I really waited a couple of time before actually complaining, or better yet updating my review. I don't feel like writing a horrible review because of ONE thing, but it has been a couple, and last night was basically it for me. First....we order delivery from them a lot, and every time it comes COLD, we enjoy the skirt steak, and we always have to put it in the microwave to warm it up, which to me is gross, I really don't live that far Second...came here a couple of times for lunch, happy that they added poutine fries to the menu, and to my surprise they ran out of gravy, which means I couldn't have the mash potatoes either. That happened twice, they were also out of something else, can't remember what it was. Last night....it was empty, day before thanksgiving, we were seated right away, waitress came over took our drink orders, while sitting there, I was freezing, I noticed the doors wide open, I ask a worker if he can please close them or put some heat on, he says sure, walks away, nothing was done....so I sat there freezing. So we decided to just order appetizers because just two days ago we had dinosaur, we ordered the poutine fries, because I've been dying to try them, wings, as usual, a cheeseburger slider, and a pulled pork slider....So the food comes out, and this is where it went down hill, the wings were cold, like really really cold that you can't eat them. My pulled pork slider, also cold, I let the waitress know, she basically grabbed the plates and walked away, no apology, no I'm sorry I will get you a new one. So we basically sat there eating the fries until the rest came back out, when the wings came back out they were hot, but they weren't the good delicious, big, finger licking dinosaur wings I remember! Actually I took one bite, and didn't want to eat anymore. Plus they were half the size of the dinosaur wings we usually get. I call over the waitress, because it's not like she comes to check up on us, and ask if if they changed the recipe, she says it looks like they forgot to put the usual ""rub"" on them. She basically takes them back because by this time I've had enough, I don't want them, and I'm not paying for something we didn't eat. The pulled pork came back, and was hot this time, but DRY! Plus the bun it was on wasn't that good. By the end of it, the wings, and Pepsi were basically taken off the bill, we basically went to pig out, and only ate the poutine fries, which were good. I'm just extremely disappointed in dinosaur, they had it all together when they first opened, I have no idea what has happened, maybe the fact that all the employees are teenagers? Who knows....",2.0

"While it was not the best barbecue I have ever had (that would be between the Rib Crib in Germantown, PA and home smokes ones from the late AB Johnson, I would go back. The ribs were exceptionally good and the brisket a little fatty, but still worth ordering. As for the sides, the fried rice was amazing...full of meats and very tasty. We also had coleslaw and fries that were quite good. Crispy fries and coleslaw that was not soggy! The mac and cheese was a bit heavy and arrived cold. Our server, while not attentive, was quite friendly and replaced it with warmer (not hot) mac 'n' cheese.  Finally, Louise, stay away from their bathrooms (see pic)!",4.0
"I'm glad DinoBBQ came to Brooklyn. Years ago, travelling from BK to BX was way too tiresome and far. DinoBBQ gets really packed on weekend nights. I came here on a Sunday afternoon and we were seated immediately. My fiancé and I came famished on an empty stomach. I settled with the Swag sampler plate and Sweetheart deal for 2--a bit of binge ordering I must say. I was surprised to see people who sat after us get their food first. Our waitress must have forgotten to put our order in, but she was apologetic and reassured us our food was coming soon.Swag Sampler Plate for Two $12.95 - Contains 4 pieces of drunken spicy shrimp boil (cold), 2 chicken wings, 2 fried green tomatoes, and 2 deviled eggs (halves). I enjoyed the wings (mango tango flavor) and the deviled eggs. The fried green tomatoes and shrimp were meh. I'd definitely skip this meal if you are sharing the sweetheart deal.

"I regret not trying this place any sooner since I am a BBQ fanatic. This place makes me appreciate this type of cuisine so much more, the amount of options are just endless.It was easy to get a reservation through open table, and this place is huge with many seats by the bar or in the dining rooms. What really caught my eye was the décor, it had a southern feel and was very inviting. For a family of four and one kid, we decided to get an appetizer that was in the form of a sampler which included shrimp, fried tomatoes, deviled eggs and a choice of buffalo wings. Of course there is the infamous BBQ sauces on every table originally from dinosaur bbq only , some had a kick with garlic while others had more of a sweetness to it. Every single thing I tried was packed with tons of flavor and was hefty in terms of portions, this restaurant doesn't play around when it comes to meat ! I also opted for the combo platters of three meats and two sides + corn bread, and let me tell you it did not disappoint. The pulled pork was juicy, the sausage had great seasoning, the ribs had the tastiest bbq sauce and it came right off the bone, plus the beef brisket was thick and not too tender. The cornbread had a sweetness to it which I enjoyed, and my mac and cheese was light with the perfect amount of cheese, my coleslaw was also fresh and wasn't drowning in mayo. The steak my boyfriend had was very juicy, flavorful and great in terms of portion. My mom's dino burger was too huge to comprehend lol, my mother said it was so delicious but she couldn't finish it in one sitting my sister was also able to find plenty of options from the kids menu, her burger or sides did not disappoint and the portion was very generous.there is a good amount of alcohol to choose from, this place is not BYOB so you can order a lot of top shelf vodkas & whiskeys, the cocktail menu was extensive and fairly priced, but the best drink to have here is a good beer to wash down all the good food. What holds me back from giving such an amazing place 5 stars is the slow service, I know the weekends can be hectic but there should be way more then just one waiter working a whole dining room . It took forever to get our drinks and appetizers, and we didn't find out until an hour and a half later that they ran out of all salads. The waiter was nice enough to give us other options to order on the house, but we were just amazed at how a simple thing such as a salad runs out, not great for vegetarian customers if this happens often. I also was annoyed that they took over 30 mins just to bring out the bday cake we took for my mom, so our cake was already melted by the time we got it, not cool.The parking situation also sucks in this area, try to come earlier if you drive so you can give yourself time to get street parking.",4.0

"Family Stylin' BBQ consists of 1 whole chicken (6 pieces), 1 whole rack of ribs, 1 pound pork or brisket, 3 Side Dishes, and MIni Rolls.  It serves 4-6 people, and is priced at 69.95.  The first time I went in January, I was impressed by how everything tasted.  Everything was on point.  We had three people and could not finish everything, which is a good thing.  That's nothing to complain about.  I remember marveling at how it was so worth it, and how I would come back again.  The service, however, was decent.  The entire look of the place looked pretty cool.  For my first time there, I would give this place four stars.  Now, three days ago, I came here again with another group of friends, and we had six people altogether.  We ordered two Family Stylin' BBQ's.  In fact, my friends actually agreed to come because of my recommendation.  Unfortunately, I let them down because we were treated with not just bad service (waiting 20 minutes to order), but terrible taste in the meat.  The mashed potato with gravy side was good, along with the BBQ beans w. pork.  Seriously though, with all of this meat, it would be a complete disaster if we had to bite through every single piece reluctantly.  And, knowing that we were paying for the dinner, we had no choice but to reluctantly try to finish all of the pieces.  We were all appalled.  For this second time, I would give the experience one star.Overall, I'll bump my average rating for this place to three stars, because I did have a good time eating the family style the first time around - though I am disappointed by what I experienced the second time there.  I doubt I'll come back.  If I do decide to try Dinosaur Bar-B-Que again, I will probably try the Harlem location.",3.0

"I may have come on an off day since my friends said its usually better. Nevertheless, I still have to rate it based on my experiences. My party of 6 had a reservation for 8pm but we got there at 7:30 and they still sat us. Service was not good...We sat there for like 20 mins waiting for someone to take our order but no one came until eons later...When we needed utensils, it was such a chore just to flag a waiter down to request for some. In terms of decor, it's pretty loud and there is a bar so don't be surprised if you end up sitting next to obnoxious drunkies. For a restaurant, the food is the most important; the service and decor are only supplementary. However, the food here was not good at all...We got 2 family style barbecues and here's what I thought:Meats:Ribs- Some were juicy but most of them were too dry...Brisket- The parts with the fat were really juicy and I thought the slice of pepper really added a nice heat to the meat. However, the parts without the fat were way too dry and rough in textureChicken- Dry and flavorless...easily the worst meatPulled pork- Ehh kind of salty and was overcooked (aka dry)Sides:Mashed potatoes- Tasty and flavorful!Mac and cheese- AlrightFries- Yummy!! So crispy!!Pork and beans- Pretty standard tastes. Nothing specialChili- Pretty flavorful!Cornbread- Way too dry and flavorless! How can you possible mess up cornbread??You know you have a problem when the sides taste better than the meats at a barbecue restaurant...Everything was just way too overcooked and dry...The flavor was no good either and was way too salty. I mean they did give us barbecue sauce but what's the point of masking the horrible taste of the meat with barbecue sauce? Prices were ok. We each paid $30 after splitting two family style barbecue orders and we were all stuffed. Again, it might have just been an off day but I won't be returning here and will probably avoid barbecue restaurants for a while after the experience today.",1.0

"I've been to Dino BBQ probably about 5 times now... the first time I went (shortly after their grand opening) it was very hectic and they were our of a lot of things... also the food came cold. I gave it another chance and since then it has been very good.The fried green tomatoes are very popular... I usually tend to get these but they're not super flavorful. I enjoyed their wings as an appetizer.As for entrees, last time I shared the Sweetheart Deal (full rack of ribs with 4 sides). It was pretty awesome and we were too full to finish it all. Not bad for $30 bucks. The brisket is consistently good as well.My only pet peeve about this place is that their staff is not in any kind of uniform. Everyone wears street clothes so sometimes it's hard to identify an employee. Not too much of a big deal. I'll keep going back.",4.0
"I have had bbq all over the country let alone brooklyn,let me tell you Dinosaur BBQ is top notch.I had an excellent experience at the Union st location.Parking is a disaster, punlic trans,uber, subway is the way to go. F TRAIN is a short walk.The prices are quite reasonable given the quality and the portions of the food.My table started with bbq chicken wings with their wango tango sauce. Excellent meaty wing with the perfect hint of smoke finshed with their house bbq sauce. Their sayce has just the right amount of kick and full flavor. Our 2nd appetizer was the Dino poutine, nice spin on the Canadian classic. Pimento cheese, pulled pork and belly cracklings make the dish.For my entree I went with the pick three combo Sliced brisket, 4 ribs and pork belly.The belly is melt in your mouth good, scary goodThe ribs are well.....perfect, the right amount of smoke juicy and meaty finished with their signature sauce. The brisket was excellent,  fat rendered and tasty.Entrees come with 2 sides and a piece of corn bread. The macaroni and cheese and coeslaw were excellent They are made the same way I do, high quality ingredients and care.There is a full bar and from what I understand they have a kick a$$ happy hour.I went for lunch and just had sodas, free refills.Service was excellent, the waiter was very knowledgeable answered all my questions. As a matter of fact the chef came out and brought me into the kitchen to check out the smokers....if you want to know they use hickory.I will definitely be back.",5.0
Came here this past Saturday night with my two sisters. There was a long wait but we were seated after 20 minutes. I ordered the catfish platter (delicious!) which comes with 2 sides. I opted for the collard greens (which were pretty good) and the Mac n cheese (the worst I've ever tasted). Our waiter was very attentive and friendly. I would come back but NOT for the Mac n cheese,3.0
I looove meat. The whole meal was meat except for the sides. I don't remember them much but what I do was they were cold and no bueno. I didn't like the rice sides or biscuits. The collards were eh. But the wings though!! Omg the wings were out of the world. They were average sized but they were so tasty and juicy. The flavor was awesome. The ribs were OMG. So tender and saucy :D I would def go again for the wings and ribs but with different sides. Us two got the sweetheart combo and had leftovers but I had also had a light meal before so I guess it's perfect for two :),4.0
"It was good don't get me wrong , it just wasn't great, or worth the $$$. I love BBQ and have had it at a lot of place. I still can't get over how expensive it is at a restaurant. These are cheap cuts of meat slow smoked to make them awesome. I do it a lot myself, and I still can't find bbq better then mine, so I am always biased. I expected a lot more from Dinosaur because of all the hype. Just another BBQ joint in Brooklyn, still think John Browns in LIC is better.",2.0
So good - but be careful if you go late - they start to run out of meat as the evening goes on. Got there at 10:30 and they were out of brisket and ribs!!,4.0
"The food is tremendous. The service is so unpredictable. I often order take out to avoid dealing with neglectful service. I have experienced it so often that I think it is systemic with the front of house set-up and isn't about the servers. They are  generally pretty nice but seem over worked.

"I may have come on an off day since my friends said its usually better. Nevertheless, I still have to rate it based on my experiences. My party of 6 had a reservation for 8pm but we got there at 7:30 and they still sat us. Service was not good...We sat there for like 20 mins waiting for someone to take our order but no one came until eons later...When we needed utensils, it was such a chore just to flag a waiter down to request for some. In terms of decor, it's pretty loud and there is a bar so don't be surprised if you end up sitting next to obnoxious drunkies. For a restaurant, the food is the most important; the service and decor are only supplementary. However, the food here was not good at all...We got 2 family style barbecues and here's what I thought:Meats:Ribs- Some were juicy but most of them were too dry...Brisket- The parts with the fat were really juicy and I thought the slice of pepper really added a nice heat to the meat. However, the parts without the fat were way too dry and rough in textureChicken- Dry and flavorless...easily the worst meatPulled pork- Ehh kind of salty and was overcooked (aka dry)Sides:Mashed potatoes- Tasty and flavorful!Mac and cheese- AlrightFries- Yummy!! So crispy!!Pork and beans- Pretty standard tastes. Nothing specialChili- Pretty flavorful!Cornbread- Way too dry and flavorless! How can you possible mess up cornbread??You know you have a problem when the sides taste better than the meats at a barbecue restaurant...Everything was just way too overcooked and dry...The flavor was no good either and was way too salty. I mean they did give us barbecue sauce but what's the point of masking the horrible taste of the meat with barbecue sauce? Prices were ok. We each paid $30 after splitting two family style barbecue orders and we were all stuffed. Again, it might have just been an off day but I won't be returning here and will probably avoid barbecue restaurants for a while after the experience today.",1.0
"I've been to the one in Harlem before so I was happy to see this one isn't too far from Barclays center, I came here on a Sunday afternoon after climbing at Brooklyn boulders so I felt like I deserved it, it was happy hour so appetizers were $5 I had fried tomatoes, garlic chipotle wings and deviled eggs, it was really good and I'll definitely come back to try the menu items",4.0
"My second time coming here was probably my last. We had to wait around 40 mins for a table (not surprising on a Friday night with 6 people) but when we got in, the restaurant was so noisy. We sat next to a large and extremely loud group. Not just talking loudly, but dancing and yelling loudly (in a restaurant on a Friday??) Besides not being able to hear anyone talk, the food was meh. As a vegetarian, I appreciated the FGT sandwich but the mac & cheese was subpar.",2.0
"I've been to Dino BBQ probably about 5 times now... the first time I went (shortly after their grand opening) it was very hectic and they were our of a lot of things... also the food came cold. I gave it another chance and since then it has been very good.The fried green tomatoes are very popular... I usually tend to get these but they're not super flavorful. I enjoyed their wings as an appetizer.As for entrees, last time I shared the Sweetheart Deal (full rack of ribs with 4 sides). It was pretty awesome and we were too full to finish it all. Not bad for $30 bucks. The brisket is consistently good as well.My only pet peeve about this place is that their staff is not in any kind of uniform. Everyone wears street clothes so sometimes it's hard to identify an employee. Not too much of a big deal. I'll keep going back.",4.0
"I have had bbq all over the country let alone brooklyn,let me tell you Dinosaur BBQ is top notch.I had an excellent experience at the Union st location.Parking is a disaster, punlic trans,uber, subway is the way to go. F TRAIN is a short walk.The prices are quite reasonable given the quality and the portions of the food.My table started with bbq chicken wings with their wango tango sauce. Excellent meaty wing with the perfect hint of smoke finshed with their house bbq sauce. Their sayce has just the right amount of kick and full flavor. Our 2nd appetizer was the Dino poutine, nice spin on the Canadian classic. Pimento cheese, pulled pork and belly cracklings make the dish.For my entree I went with the pick three combo Sliced brisket, 4 ribs and pork belly.The belly is melt in your mouth good, scary goodThe ribs are well.....perfect, the right amount of smoke juicy and meaty finished with their signature sauce. The brisket was excellent,  fat rendered and tasty.Entrees come with 2 sides and a piece of corn bread. The macaroni and cheese and coeslaw were excellent They are made the same way I do, high quality ingredients and care.There is a full bar and from what I understand they have a kick a$$ happy hour.I went for lunch and just had sodas, free refills.Service was excellent, the waiter was very knowledgeable answered all my questions. As a matter of fact the chef came out and brought me into the kitchen to check out the smokers....if you want to know they use hickory.I will definitely be back.",5.0
Came here this past Saturday night with my two sisters. There was a long wait but we were seated after 20 minutes. I ordered the catfish platter (delicious!) which comes with 2 sides. I opted for the collard greens (which were pretty good) and the Mac n cheese (the worst I've ever tasted). Our waiter was very attentive and friendly. I would come back but NOT for the Mac n cheese,3.0
I looove meat. The whole meal was meat except for the sides. I don't remember them much but what I do was they were cold and no bueno. I didn't like the rice sides or biscuits. The collards were eh. But the wings though!! Omg the wings were out of the world. They were average sized but they were so tasty and juicy. The flavor was awesome. The ribs were OMG. So tender and saucy :D I would def go again for the wings and ribs but with different sides. Us two got the sweetheart combo and had leftovers but I had also had a light meal before so I guess it's perfect for two :),4.0
"It was good don't get me wrong , it just wasn't great, or worth the $$$. I love BBQ and have had it at a lot of place. I still can't get over how expensive it is at a restaurant. These are cheap cuts of meat slow smoked to make them awesome. I do it a lot myself, and I still can't find bbq better then mine, so I am always biased. I expected a lot more from Dinosaur because of all the hype. Just another BBQ joint in Brooklyn, still think John Browns in LIC is better.",2.0

"My family and I celebrated my mother's birthday here a couple of days ago.  For the most part I was not please with this establishment and here's why:It started at the bar - I was advised to get a ""Donkey Punch"" because it was really good and packed a punch.  What I got was a glass of fruit juice.  Even though I wasn't happy with my drink I wouldn't let it spoil my evening.There was nine of us dining, we were seated promptly and our waitress came right over to take our drink orders so they get a plus on that.  But then the food came......Out of the nine of us at least four people's food was cold.  Two sent them back to be heated.  My niece order a burger platter with sides and after being reheated they brought everything back separately.  First she received her burger, then a few minutes later she received one of her sides, a couple of minutes after that another side came out.  I was confused as to why it came back that way when everything originally came out on the same plate.  For my entrée I ordered the peel and eat shrimp and hot link sausage with mac and cheese and cucumber and tomato salad.  The hot link and mac and cheese were luke warm but I never send my food back so I ate it.  Only the shrimp had seasoning - the rest of the food was pretty bland and the rest of my party felt the same way about their food.On a positive note I have to give kudos to the waitress who got the manager immediately.  He came over to address the problems we were having and adjusted our bill accordingly.  They also sent over a slice of cake with a candle for my mom free of charge which was nice.I've been to the Dinosaur BBQ in Harlem and was quite fond on the place - I don't know if maybe they were having an ""off"" day but suffice it to say I will not be returning to this location.",2.0

I don't actually believe it's the best BBQ, but it's still finger licking good. And the sides in addition make a damn good meal. I love the Mac n cheese, and I usually get the brisket or ribs. The hot BBQ sauce too makes the dish! If you're feeling young, the donkey punch will probably still make you dizzy from just watching the bartender add all the different types of liquor to your glass. It'll definitely give you a quick buzz. Other than that, the place is just a fun atmosphere. The BBQ loving crowds are happy people!

"Not a big fan of this place, it's just BBQ meats. Nothing unusual or extraordinary, the best thing here, would be chicken wings and BBQ briskets. Other than that, everything else you can get it at any regular restaurant that serves BBQ meats. Portions are big, but some meats are tasteless, and some are overpowering with their BBQ sauce.

If you're in the area and want solid bbq then def stop by but I wouldn't make a long trip of it.,3.0
Sooooo good ! I got a steak & it was so juicy and it had it cooked medium well and it was just perfect. The steak came w/ 2 sides so I got mashed potatoes & macaroni. The mashed potatoes were really good but the macaroni was normal macaroni.The special relish & bbq sauce that came with my steak was outstanding .

However, the mac and cheese and baked beans were really good. The ribs are everything you want - the subtle burnt notes, the sweet and tangy sauce, and a juicy interior.

"E-Scale: 6/10Having lived upstate for 9 years (5 in Ithaca and thus frequenting the Syracuse Dino BBQ and another 4 in Rochester, frequenting their Dino BBQ), my standards are higher than most.Let's start with atmosphere. Outside was great, I actually got excited seeing the benches and what could potentially be motorcycle parking. Inside though... it was a let down. So clean! So big! No graffiti on the walls?! At least the bathrooms were grungy, but that was the only place.Dino BBQ is suppose to be dingy and small and crowded and filled with local families, truckers, and bikers, all mingling and eating!The food was, for the most part, up to par with the syracuse and rochester place. Chicken was tender and moist as usual, the beans and pork were out of this world, as was the mac and cheese & chili.The ribs and brisket were dry on the outside, especially the ribs. Parts of it felt like I was eating beef jerky. Definitely not the fall off the bone kind. I did not care for the ribs.The weirdest thing on the menu was the fried rice. It was bland and did not really go with any of the food. It felt like something they stuck in the menu to appease to the asian population. Made no sense and was not that ""wow"". I say bring back the corn on the cob!!!! It was disappointing to not see that on the menu.Drinks wise, it was a VERY fancy bar for dino. Luckily the beers were some of the cheapest ones I have seen in NYC. Excellent job there! I definitely will go back just for those prices! (Though the R train lowers my motivation quite a lot)Overall, its a great place for city folk here, but if you want good Dino BBQ, rent a car and drive the 4 hours to syracuse. It is worth it!",3.0

The Sweetheart deal for 2 is decent but my favorite is the Ol One Eye Burger. Beef, Bacon, Jalapenos, and a Sunny side Up egg. Delicious.I have to warn you, it will get busy during evenings. The atmosphere is not the quietest either. If you're looking for a nice place to catch up with a close friend, I wouldn't recommend here. Looking for a place to chill, dig into good food, right here!(I'm so glad there is one that just opened in my hometown, Baltimore. Hopefully the experience is just as tasty.)",4.0
I've been going here since this place opened. I've been a fan since going to the one in Albany upstate. And the food is good wherever you go! I usually get the combo plate with 1/2 chicken and brisket with double Mac. The Mac and Cheese is amazing! And I don't trust anyone's Mac. But there's is great. The service is also wonderful. I got the lamb shoulder from there last night that wasn't very good but they gave me a 1/4 chicken replacement for free! Gotta love good customer service.,5.0

"E-Scale: 6/10Having lived upstate for 9 years (5 in Ithaca and thus frequenting the Syracuse Dino BBQ and another 4 in Rochester, frequenting their Dino BBQ), my standards are higher than most.Let's start with atmosphere. Outside was great, I actually got excited seeing the benches and what could potentially be motorcycle parking. Inside though... it was a let down. So clean! So big! No graffiti on the walls?! At least the bathrooms were grungy, but that was the only place.Dino BBQ is suppose to be dingy and small and crowded and filled with local families, truckers, and bikers, all mingling and eating!The food was, for the most part, up to par with the syracuse and rochester place. Chicken was tender and moist as usual, the beans and pork were out of this world, as was the mac and cheese & chili.The ribs and brisket were dry on the outside, especially the ribs. Parts of it felt like I was eating beef jerky. Definitely not the fall off the bone kind. I did not care for the ribs.The weirdest thing on the menu was the fried rice. It was bland and did not really go with any of the food. It felt like something they stuck in the menu to appease to the asian population. Made no sense and was not that ""wow"". I say bring back the corn on the cob!!!! It was disappointing to not see that on the menu.Drinks wise, it was a VERY fancy bar for dino. Luckily the beers were some of the cheapest ones I have seen in NYC. Excellent job there! I definitely will go back just for those prices! (Though the R train lowers my motivation quite a lot)Overall, its a great place for city folk here, but if you want good Dino BBQ, rent a car and drive the 4 hours to syracuse. It is worth it!",3.0
"Juicy Lip Smackin food!This is one of the first restaurants I ate at in Brooklyn, and it was worth coming back.The food is good. I love the burgers, and ribs are good too. Only disappointment is when it comes to the appetizers. Personally I find them (beans/mac n cheese) a little dry but whos to complain when you great other options! The Sweetheart deal for 2 is decent but my favorite is the Ol One Eye Burger. Beef, Bacon, Jalapenos, and a Sunny side Up egg. Delicious.I have to warn you, it will get busy during evenings. The atmosphere is not the quietest either. If you're looking for a nice place to catch up with a close friend, I wouldn't recommend here. Looking for a place to chill, dig into good food, right here!(I'm so glad there is one that just opened in my hometown, Baltimore. Hopefully the experience is just as tasty.)",4.0
I've been going here since this place opened. I've been a fan since going to the one in Albany upstate. And the food is good wherever you go! I usually get the combo plate with 1/2 chicken and brisket with double Mac. The Mac and Cheese is amazing! And I don't trust anyone's Mac. But there's is great. The service is also wonderful. I got the lamb shoulder from there last night that wasn't very good but they gave me a 1/4 chicken replacement for free! Gotta love good customer service.,5.0
"Having been to their Harlem location many times for savory items, needed a treat or two so grabbed two slices of pie here -- Lemon Icebox Pie was a terrible way to waste $5.50, but I can't think of a better way to spend the same amount than the simple but oh-so-satisfying Peanut Butter Pie ($5.50).",4.0
"We came for Valentine's Day, and thank goodness we made a reservation. The wait at 6pm on a Sunday was 30-45 minutes, but fortunately they were able to seat us early.We got the Big Ass Pork Plate and a half rack of ribs with plenty of sides. All of it was fantastic, especially the ribs; they fall right off the bone.The service was fine; nothing special, but not bad at all. We were glad to be in a corner so it wasn't as noisy as the rest of the restaurant.",4.0
I been here numerous times and the food is consistently good.... The wings are amazing. Brisket and  Mac and cheese I recommend. The donkey punch drink will suffice for a buzz. The waiters are on point. I also recommend the peanut butter pie for desert.,4.0
"Waited on the phone for 30 minutes and never got through yet my brother called 25 minutes later and he got through.  Seriously?  Then when we wanted to order for 2, they said it was a 1.5 hour wait for a pickup!  Really?!?!   Went to Dinosaur several times at the Brooklyn location but every time when we go, service is slow when the place is only half empty but this takes the cake.",3.0
"This may be my favorite BBQ in Brooklyn...we just have to cut down on the crazy long waits!The meat is ridic. Pulled pork, brisket, ribs, chicken - I've eaten it all and I want it all. And then some. It's the type of place where you're craving it even after being heavy-laden with those thick juicy slabs of animal. Yup that good.Side dishes are on point! I often judge a BBQ spot on how well they do their beans, greens, and Mac and cheese. Best Mac at a BBQ spot I've found, greens are so delicious too!Excellent beer list, cool ambiance, servers are great - this is a BBQ Mecca that requires numerous pilgrimages!",5.0
"I first fell in love with Dinosaur BBQ after visiting the Harlem location for my company's Christmas party. The Brooklyn location is just as good and more convenient. I had another great experience during my second visit. My friend and I arrived a little after happy hour (bummer!) and the place was packed but we were seated promptly. As soon as we placed our order for drinks and food, we received our order within 15 minutes. I had the ¼ plate of rib with mac-n-cheese, potato salad and a side of sweet tea. However, I didn't like the mac-n-cheese; It was very greasy with too much cheese for my preference. Everything else was superb, especially the potato salad which was creamy and tasted homemade. Overall, I would recommend this spot to anyone especially for a casual date or after work fun. Try out the deviled eggs, shrimp boil and wings...They are 2 die 4!",5.0
Not bad for a barbecue place. I came with my department for a lunch meeting and it was good. we ordered the appetizer sampler. The wings were my favorite. The shrimp was good. The fried tomato was an interesting taste but still good. I ordered the chicken steak and it was so flavorful. I didn't expect it to be that good. It came with two sides so I ordered it with fries and a salad. Both were delish! The iced tea was super sweet but I loved it!! I definitely recommend this place!,4.0
If you have any idea what barbecue tastes like in the lone star state then you are not going to be happy with dinosaur. The location is big and spacious and utilizes an old steel factory or building which gives it a lot of character. But then again it's almost like a chain restaurant in any other city. It's nice to have some space in a NYC restaurant. The big screen tvs are just enough to allow for sports watching. They were showing college bball followed by NBA during my few hours here.I had a two meat combo which was ribs and brisket. The brisket is pretty good but the ribs aren't as good as I hoped. They were kind of tough. My friend had some pulled pork that was really gamey and pork tasting which was almost unappetizing.The poutine is good. It's nice to have a beer sampler (flights). As a former Texan this is not getting my bbq fix but it may be acceptable in a pinch.,3.0
"Come here all the time with my husband because he loves BBQ. We always get the swag sampler for an appetizer, the peel and eat shrimp are okay but the star is really the fried green tomatoes and th deviled eggs! So amazing!! Guaranteed anything you order off the menu is amazing. The chicken, brisket, ribs, if your hungry enough definitely shoot for the combo platter, you can pick any meat with two sides and you'll have to take a plate home! Seating is always quick the food always comes fast and it's a great atmosphere. Can't get any better than that especially in New York.",5.0
"Exceptional food! This place is so amazing that I dined here two days in a row which unheard of for me personally. I enjoyed everything that I ordered. I decided to start off my meal with something from the starter menu so I chose the jumbo BBQ wings covered with honey barbecue sauce which was tasteful. My dinner selection was 1/4 rack of ribs, mac n' cheese and collard greens, oh how I enjoyed this meal. I'm so glad that my friend was the one that introduced this restaurant to me because it now my favorite place for barbecue.",5.0
"BBQ joints take notice, DINO just raised the bar, or more precisely the spit, get it, a BBQ spit? No, ok I'll just stick to reviews.  The food was spectacular.  I had the sampler which came with pulled pork, ribs and brisket.  The BBQ is more on the sweet end, so I'd suggest some savory sides to balance everything out.  I had the black eyed peas which were earthy and delicious and  collards with turkey that was surprisingly light.  The ribs were delicious but still had a little bite to them.  I normally prefer fall off the bone tenderness, but these were still tasty, delicious and had structure to them. The absolute star of the show was the brisket, which showcased the best of slow cooked, red ringed, tender goodness.  The burger was simple, perfectly cooked and showcased great beef flavor married to a pillowy soft, yet hearty brioche bun.  The Cuban sandwich was amazing and a complete surprise find in a BBQ joint.The service was friendly, expedient and really down-home comfortable which I found a welcome relief from this usually snotty ass, hipster, gentrified section of Bklyn.  The staff were genuinely cool people who seemed happy to be there. The fifth star in the review was for the prices.  The food was excellent and the servers were like family all for about $60.00 for 3 entrees, 1 kids meal, 2 sodas and a beer!

"I've been to Dinosaur BBQ in a number of locations - Stamford, Syracuse, and now Brooklyn. Well, Dinosaur BBQ Brooklyn had the pleasure of seeing myself and my friends in a very unique state of mind. We had enjoyed a bottomless brunch and some shuffleboard over at the Royal Palms and were just happy to be alive. We arrived at Dino and unfortunately there was a 30 minute wait for a table. I was debating eating my own arm, but then we opted to do the take out option instead, which was only 15 minutes.As we waited for our food to be done, we checked out the neat bar and got some drinks there while we waited. Finally, our food was done. Unfortunately, we all had nearly full beers left. Naturally, the best option for us was to take our takeout and sit on the curb and eat it with our beers. For those of you who don't know, you're really not supposed to do that . . . ever. So we decided to do the NEXT best option: take our takeout, and ask someone sitting at the restaurant if we could sit down at their table with them (Great idea, Kel and team). For those of you who don't know, you're DEFINITELY really not supposed to do that . . . ever. So again, we found ourselves with our beers, our takeout, and nowhere to sit as it was poppin here on a Saturday night. The servers here went above and beyond, and you all deserve a raise after dealing with our shenanigans with such grace and hospitality. Obviously we were being complete A**H***S but they still squeezed us in before a reservation and let us sit here, eat our DELICIOUS food and finish our beer (which in retrospect, we probably didn't really need).  I HIGHLY recommend the mac and cheese (PS. Happy national mac and cheese day all you cheesy people out there!) It was seriously awesome - just look at the pictures here and you'll be convinced. I also got the pork ribs which again were really tasty and satisfying.  So things, I learned from this experience:1.

The main course was where things started to get dicey - I had a pulled pork and brisket platter with mac and cheese and fries, and while the sides were pretty good, the meat was disappointing. The pulled pork was just okay, but not really pulled (it was more chunks than shreds) and the brisket was inconsistent - one piece was melt-in-your-mouth tender and perfect, but the next was fatty and chewy. I will say that I'm from North Carolina and thus have pretty high standards for pulled pork, but this case wasn't just me being picky - it really just wasn't that good. My friends had similar experiences with the brisket's texture being off. The food also took forever to come out, and when it finally did, three of us were missing cornbread, which our waiter said they had run out of in the kitchen and brought it out to us later.Service-wise, everyone was really nice, but with the long wait time for the food and the overall disorganization (plus the fact that the barbecue itself left something to be desired), this probably came out to a two-star for me. The starters were really good though, so I'll leave it at three.Pretty much all of the Dinosaur BBQ locations are a bit of a trek for me, so I doubt I'll be back (and I definitely wouldn't recommend going out of your way to visit them).

Only 2 stars cause the food was good. Horrible hostess.  We had a party of 7 so we called Saturday morning to make a reservation. We were told they don't take reservations on the weekends for big parties. We were also told not to worry because we would be seated withing half an hour. Well we get there and they tell us 1 to 1 and a half hour wait. After waiting an hour were told it will be another hour. During this time we saw 2 large parties get seated before us who clearly arrived at least an hr after us. Hostess told us since we were walk ins it takes a while. Completely different from what we were told on the phone.  We ended up waiting over 2 hrs and having to talk to the manager before being seated. In the end we got 1 appetizer for free.

"Dinosaur Bar-B-QueNY Brooklyn Gowanus8pm Tuesday 10th February 2015Four StarsAfter drinking a few beers at Threes brewery, I wandered down a few blocks to Dinosaur BBQ. I decided on takeout. The cashier was friendly and handed me a paper menu for an easier read to the gigantic chalk board. I ordered the 3 meat combination, 2 sides, and piece of cornbread ($21.50). The pulled pork was a bit dry but with the magic of their baked beans it became delicious. The brisket was fatty, salty, and tender. Plus they added some jalapeños which added a nice kick to it. The St. Louis Style Ribs were the star of the show. The meat was slow cooked to perfection. There was enough smoke and char to complement the sweet and salty seasoning. Lastly the macaroni and cheese was very upscale tasting -more creamy than cheesy.",4.0

"We ate here a couple of weeks ago.  Everyone enjoyed their meals so we planned on going back this week.  Well, sometimes ignorance truly is bliss.  I was poking around on the Department of Health's website where you can get information on restaurant inspections.  When I looked up Dinosaur's inspection, I noted they received a 'A'!  I was elated! And it was inspected in January!  Ahhh, even happier, as I thought, ""hey, it received an 'A' in January and here it is only 3 months later.  So, eureka, found a great restaurant with a great rating.   But, I had to click on the inspection report....I couldn't just leave it alone and shut it down. I come to find out they are graded on a point system.  1 to 12 points against them and they receive an 'A'!  Well, according to the NYC DOH website, they have 12 points against them because:   Evidence of mice or live mice present in facility's food and/or non-food areas!!!!!  Friggin mice!  Are you kidding me....there is evidence of mice or live mice and they get a friggin A!  Well, there goes our plans and my appetite!  Damn!",1.0
"Arrived here early with a few friends and we were told we cannot be seated until our entire party arrives. We were a little upset considering the place was not full at all and had a good amount of empty seating. There was also no one waiting besides us. I understand if they want to keep tables going on a busy night but we were there on a relatively slow afternoon.When we were finally seated, my boyfriend and I ordered the sweet heart deal while my friends ordered similar platters. The ribs were great, maybe a little too much even for the two of us (and my boyfriend lovesssss meat). There are different options for the sides and I had the mashed potatoes with gravy (very rich). The fries were decent as well.Overall, great place for meat lovers and barbecue ribs. It's a place that I personally would try once but not again since I'm not a big fan of a lot of meat. I do have to say the staff was very accommodating when two friends arrived late and pulled up a chair from the side. The staff was quick to come over to get the order and bring out the food.",4.0
"Overall Dinosaur BBQ is similar to many other BBQ establishments. Decent food, service and prices. PROS: Ambiance: Large restaurant with many seating available.

As we left the restaurant, I had actually forgot my phone and our server had run after us to give me back my phone! Awesome service!Food: My husband and I started off with the chicken wings with the wango tango sauce. The wings were probably one of my favorite items. They were plump, juicy and the sauce was delicious. Sweet, tangy with a hint of spiciness. For our meal, we ordered the sweetheart deal which included a full rack of ribs, corn bread and four sides (chili, mac n cheese, fries and collard greens). The ribs were sort of bland, not much seasoning there. I had to slather the ribs with the bbq sauce for flavor. Even though the meat fell off the bone, there wasn't much there. The chili was good, meaty with a great spices. The mac n cheese were cheesy and it was baked. The collard greens were a little on the sweet side. The fries were good.

"Ok, so my take on the place. Prices: Not bad, The 2 dollar signs are accurately placed. Service: was amazing, I walked in grabbed a drink, and went up to the host and was seated promptly. This could be due to the fact that the place wasn't busy that night. Food: so i started off with the sampler plate for 2.  The best thing hands down was the fried tomatoes, it was just amazing.

"As with any of my Dinosaur Bar-B-Que experiences, the apps are always the scene-stealers in my book, and the Brooklyn location proves this to be a consistent feat for the franchise.

My favorites continue to be the Jumbo BBQ Chicken Wings (I was really drawn to the Garlic Chipotle and Hoisin Sesame this time around), the Fried Green Tomatoes (""Fancy""-style, please - with pimento cheese and some slaw-relish topping called Chow-Chow), and the Creole Spiced Deviled Eggs.But the newcomer that really wowed me at the BK location was the Dino Poutine.

"TLDR: Dinosaur Brooklyn's operations are off fleeck, and if you're going expecting the same level of service or quality you're used to upstate, you will be sorely disappointed.There's a reason the Yelp ratings for this Dinosaur pale in comparison to its peers upstate. The first time I visited, they had no Brisket. Nevermind that Brisket makes up approximately 1/3 of the menu... after waiting for a table, being seated, and given menus, it was only when we placed our order that our server bothered to tell us. Welp. Not fun for the non-pork types among us. After our meal, I asked to speak to a manager to let them know how frustrated I was. After waiting several minutes, no manager appeared. I gave up and left. After that visit I sent in a comment via their online form at dinosaurbarbque.com/cont…. The form says ""Contact us with your thoughts or questions and we'll get back in touch soon."" They never got back in touch.I went back tonight to give it another shot- after all I LOVED going to Dinosaur when I spent time in Syracuse. What a bust. Service was really bad. We had to ask, on two separate occasions, for our dishes to be cleared. When they brought our main courses, they didn't clear the finished appetizer plates or the sharing plates. Combined with all the marketing crap and silverware baskets in the middle of the table, it was like playing a game of Tetris.BUT IT GOT WORSE! I ordered a brisket sandwich without hot peppers and a side of mashed potatoes with gravy on the side. They brought it with hot peppers and gravy on the potatoes!. No big deal- the server apologized, assured us it wasn't HIS mistake, and promised another. 10-15 minutes later, I had potatoes, no gravy anywhere, and a second sandwich, still with hot peppers. I showed the server, spoke to the manager, who managed to get a new sandwich (sans hot peppers) in about 2 minutes. Impressive turnaround time- I guess the third time really is the charm.I could tell the server and manager were frustrated, but at the end of the day, the operational lapses turned both dinners sour. Not having a core menu item, and then consistently screwing up a fairly simple modification, resulting in my having to eat well after my friends were done, is no fun.The food was meh, although that may be influenced by my negative feelings after the screwups. And to add insult to injury, when I came home, my backpack was smothered in BBQ sauce. It was as if I had left it in a puddle of the stuff, which I guess I did. Silly me thought they keep the floors somewhat clean.",2.0
"Easily some of the best bbq I've had in a while, and definitely best in the area. Anyone coming here, here's a few things to keep in mind:· This is a no-frills type of establishment. It's a bit rough around the edges, the staff have tattoos, they play live music, and it's set in a former steel warehouse. If you can't understand that, then you're expecting too much. This type of character makes them awesome. It's all deliberate, and meant to be fun.· The bbq here is of a certain southern style. Do your homework. It isn't going to be smothered in sauce or be anything like Dallas BBQ. It's really good bbq, as they have an actual pit, and you can smell it from a block away. The sides have all been solid. The sliders leave more to be desired, and would probably fare better on a kid's menu.· The beer menu is comprehensive and intelligently put together for all types of palates. ENJOY IT.All in all, be loud, communicative with your server, and have fun! The only negative reviews I've seen here are those who take themselves and their dining experience WAY TOO SERIOUSLY.-1 star for a hostess with red flannel today for having an ongoing attitude problem that couldn't leave her face.",4.0
"For several months I have been bragging to my co workers in Delaware that when they come to Brooklyn we are all going to Dino BBQ. Well last night was the night and we arrived at 8:30 and were seated right away. The waitress was very nice and offered us some useful suggestions. When the food arrived it just looked boring, and it tasted like something I can get at my work cafeteria. I have been here several times with my family and have always walked completely satisfied. But everyone who I was with last evening including myself would probably not go out of our way to make it back here. It's pretty sad.",2.0
"Good happy hour! Long islands for $4 and a good selection of beer. I got the brisket sandwich with a side of beans and mac n cheese. Brisket was perfectly cooked and had just enough flavor, didn't even need any BBQ sauce. Our waiter was quick and checked in on us regularly. Will return!",4.0
"I came here for dinner with a friend and waited almost a half hour to be seated on a Saturday night, no reservation. Con: we were told we would only have to wait 15 mins. Pro: we were able to get a drink and hang out by the bar.Everything on the menu looked amazing. We decided to share the 'Swag Sampler Plate' for two so that we could try almost everything on the first page. We also got the 1/4 rack of ribs, mac and cheese, and fried rice. When the food arrived, we wondered if it would be enough. The sampler plate for two was more of a taster - we each tried 1 deviled egg, 1 chicken wing, 1 fried green tomato, and 2 shrimp. Everything in the sampler plate was great, but the all-star was the shrimp. We almost ordered more. The ribs fell off the bone easily. And the different bbq sauces were awesome - I especially liked the mango habanero. The mac and cheese was tasty, but forgettable. I really liked the fried rice. The meat was delicious and overall, it left you feeling how a good fried rice should... that it wasn't overly greasy and there were some vegetables included so you can pretend that it was kinda healthy.

"We were filming a commercial for Hellman's mayo nearby youtu.be/_D5DT1rmEfg and came after work (about 10pm) with DJ BBQ, seen in the linked video with my husband, who made the gadgets and co-directed the spot.

There were maybe more people joining us, but it ended up being the three of us, and we took the nachos and poutine home.Deviled eggs -- Fantastic, just the right amount of heat from jalapenos, tangy, among the best I ever had.Fried green tomatoes -- More like fritters than how my grandma made them (lightly coated in flour). Very crispy breading with some shredded parmesan cheese on top and a side of creamy cheese dip. It was ok, but maybe like how Olive Garden would make a Southern classic.Poutine -- Again, a deviation from tradition.They use pimiento cheese instead of cheese curds and throw pulled pork and brown gravy on the ""hand cut"" fries.Brisket Sliders -- They make good brisket, but I preferred the tacos at Hometown, even though they have two proper hickory smokers in the kitchen. Our friend got a tour, and he had a great time, which was most important.Nachos -- They didn't get crazy with the Cheez Whiz.While we're talking about 90s music, we came in and there was live music.

"TLDR: Dinosaur Brooklyn's operations are off fleeck, and if you're going expecting the same level of service or quality you're used to upstate, you will be sorely disappointed.There's a reason the Yelp ratings for this Dinosaur pale in comparison to its peers upstate. The first time I visited, they had no Brisket. Nevermind that Brisket makes up approximately 1/3 of the menu... after waiting for a table, being seated, and given menus, it was only when we placed our order that our server bothered to tell us. Welp. Not fun for the non-pork types among us. After our meal, I asked to speak to a manager to let them know how frustrated I was. After waiting several minutes, no manager appeared. I gave up and left. After that visit I sent in a comment via their online form at dinosaurbarbque.com/cont…. The form says ""Contact us with your thoughts or questions and we'll get back in touch soon."" They never got back in touch.I went back tonight to give it another shot- after all I LOVED going to Dinosaur when I spent time in Syracuse. What a bust. Service was really bad. We had to ask, on two separate occasions, for our dishes to be cleared. When they brought our main courses, they didn't clear the finished appetizer plates or the sharing plates. Combined with all the marketing crap and silverware baskets in the middle of the table, it was like playing a game of Tetris.BUT IT GOT WORSE! I ordered a brisket sandwich without hot peppers and a side of mashed potatoes with gravy on the side. They brought it with hot peppers and gravy on the potatoes!. No big deal- the server apologized, assured us it wasn't HIS mistake, and promised another. 10-15 minutes later, I had potatoes, no gravy anywhere, and a second sandwich, still with hot peppers. I showed the server, spoke to the manager, who managed to get a new sandwich (sans hot peppers) in about 2 minutes. Impressive turnaround time- I guess the third time really is the charm.I could tell the server and manager were frustrated, but at the end of the day, the operational lapses turned both dinners sour. Not having a core menu item, and then consistently screwing up a fairly simple modification, resulting in my having to eat well after my friends were done, is no fun.The food was meh, although that may be influenced by my negative feelings after the screwups. And to add insult to injury, when I came home, my backpack was smothered in BBQ sauce. It was as if I had left it in a puddle of the stuff, which I guess I did. Silly me thought they keep the floors somewhat clean.",2.0
"Easily some of the best bbq I've had in a while, and definitely best in the area. Anyone coming here, here's a few things to keep in mind:· This is a no-frills type of establishment. It's a bit rough around the edges, the staff have tattoos, they play live music, and it's set in a former steel warehouse. If you can't understand that, then you're expecting too much. This type of character makes them awesome. It's all deliberate, and meant to be fun.· The bbq here is of a certain southern style. Do your homework. It isn't going to be smothered in sauce or be anything like Dallas BBQ. It's really good bbq, as they have an actual pit, and you can smell it from a block away. The sides have all been solid. The sliders leave more to be desired, and would probably fare better on a kid's menu.· The beer menu is comprehensive and intelligently put together for all types of palates. ENJOY IT.All in all, be loud, communicative with your server, and have fun! The only negative reviews I've seen here are those who take themselves and their dining experience WAY TOO SERIOUSLY.-1 star for a hostess with red flannel today for having an ongoing attitude problem that couldn't leave her face.",4.0
"For several months I have been bragging to my co workers in Delaware that when they come to Brooklyn we are all going to Dino BBQ. Well last night was the night and we arrived at 8:30 and were seated right away. The waitress was very nice and offered us some useful suggestions. When the food arrived it just looked boring, and it tasted like something I can get at my work cafeteria. I have been here several times with my family and have always walked completely satisfied. But everyone who I was with last evening including myself would probably not go out of our way to make it back here. It's pretty sad.",2.0
"Good happy hour! Long islands for $4 and a good selection of beer. I got the brisket sandwich with a side of beans and mac n cheese. Brisket was perfectly cooked and had just enough flavor, didn't even need any BBQ sauce. Our waiter was quick and checked in on us regularly. Will return!",4.0
"I came here for dinner with a friend and waited almost a half hour to be seated on a Saturday night, no reservation. Con: we were told we would only have to wait 15 mins. Pro: we were able to get a drink and hang out by the bar.Everything on the menu looked amazing. We decided to share the 'Swag Sampler Plate' for two so that we could try almost everything on the first page. We also got the 1/4 rack of ribs, mac and cheese, and fried rice. When the food arrived, we wondered if it would be enough. The sampler plate for two was more of a taster - we each tried 1 deviled egg, 1 chicken wing, 1 fried green tomato, and 2 shrimp. Everything in the sampler plate was great, but the all-star was the shrimp. We almost ordered more. The ribs fell off the bone easily. And the different bbq sauces were awesome - I especially liked the mango habanero. The mac and cheese was tasty, but forgettable. I really liked the fried rice. The meat was delicious and overall, it left you feeling how a good fried rice should... that it wasn't overly greasy and there were some vegetables included so you can pretend that it was kinda healthy. To complete the meal, we tried the cheesecake with caramel whiskey sauce and almost fought over it. It was that good. I'm still thinking about that cheesecake 2 days later.

"The Harlem location was recommended to me from a friend, but since we were in Brooklyn, we figured it was just as good. We were sat right away, even though the place was pretty busy for lunch.

That is my only complaint and the only reason I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5. One of my favorite things about the Brooklyn location was the decor. Inside was all wooden seats and tables. Had a very bbq feel. The food was amazing!! So many options with bbq pork, brisket, chicken. There was burgers and ribs also. I went with the Memphis style bbq pork sandwich platter. The pork tasted so smokey. I love the open pit taste! It had coleslaw on the sandwich and came with 2 sides for 12.00. The fries were decent, average. And the bbq rice was pretty good.

The sampler is good for people who want tiny taste portions of their appetizers. I could've finished the platter myself. Afterwards, we had 3/4 quarter rack of ribs and since i had an odd craving for sausage, we added a side of sausage. Ribs were Delicious as always. Falls right of the bone. However, my side of sausages, was actually ONE sausage for $6? And i mean breakfast size sausage... that wasn't memorable at all. The sides were delicious. BBQ beans with pork, BBQ fried rice with BBQ meat and mac&cheese are so good!All in all, I would stick with ribs and sides if you choose to come here.",3.0
I've been here twice now with the girlfriend. Both times were good. Depending on what you get I think they have better items than others and also the price can be a big difference. I think their brisket is good. Nothing I'd go out of my way for but definitely tasty. Skip the fries as a side and get their Mac and cheese and baked beans. Their fried okra is great too! We got wings for an app recently they were better than expected with a dry rub then sauce added on. My girlfriend got their lamb slider which looked like a burger the size you would get at Burger King. It was really good and she got two sides for only $8 total!! They also have a good beer selection but we're out of my first two choices that I wanted first. Disappointing that they didn't update their chalk board. We'll definitely be back.,4.0
"Pretty good BBQ. Had the family style with 8 people, we got the poutine, extra brisket, mac and cheese, wings and some other items that I cannot recall at this point because I was so stuffed with food I'm trying to forget.The brisket was the star - everyone loved it (I liked the fattier sides), the wings were good with honey bbq and my friends who got the buffalo enjoyed theirs as well. The poutine was good, but didn't have that much meat on top. The ribs were fine, but not a must for me. I also thought the mac and cheese had a weird flavor, but liked the mashed potatoes and gravy.We had a lovely waitress (i think her name was Kenya) who was very attentive and sweet!

However, she was making a little different than I had seen in the past, so I decided to let her be the expert. Great idea #2. Rachel poured the vermouth over the ice in the martini glass while she let it chill. Then dumped it all out so you had just the essence of the Vermouth. A delicious dirty martini.I decided to eat my to go food at the bar. The food was good and the atmosphere was friendly.

I was happy with our food.They did a great job of coming up with a menu where there's something for most people. If you have some picky eaters, this is a good choice. They have fewer vegetarian options than I remember, but more than any other BBQ place. They have a gluten-free and allergen-free menu, too. Perhaps that's why there were so many groups here for special occasions - it's a spot everyone can agree on.The service was amazing. It was like they hired only the best Trader Joe's employees. I thought the table behind us was BFF with the waitress, only to realize later that they were totally just a random table of tourists. Our waitress was also great, but in a more normal friendly small talk kind of way, which is what I prefer.It's a little on the high side for people on a budget, but it's cheap for BBQ, so there were a ton of families out for a nice night out. Which is perhaps why everyone just seemed so happy to be there.",4.0
"The Harlem location was recommended to me from a friend, but since we were in Brooklyn, we figured it was just as good. We were sat right away, even though the place was pretty busy for lunch. The server took a while to get to us. Which I don't really mind waiting but she didn't even acknowledge us for a good 10 minutes. That is my only complaint and the only reason I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5. One of my favorite things about the Brooklyn location was the decor. Inside was all wooden seats and tables. Had a very bbq feel. The food was amazing!! So many options with bbq pork, brisket, chicken. There was burgers and ribs also. I went with the Memphis style bbq pork sandwich platter. The pork tasted so smokey. I love the open pit taste! It had coleslaw on the sandwich and came with 2 sides for 12.00. The fries were decent, average. And the bbq rice was pretty good. I would absolutely return because there's so much more I'd like to try on the menu!",4.0
"No more traveling all the way to Harlem for Dinosaur bbq, yay!! Unfortunately, the second time i came wasn't as memorable as the first experience in Harlem.For two, we had swag sampler plate (two). The sampler is good for people who want tiny taste portions of their appetizers. I could've finished the platter myself. Afterwards, we had 3/4 quarter rack of ribs and since i had an odd craving for sausage, we added a side of sausage. Ribs were Delicious as always. Falls right of the bone. However, my side of sausages, was actually ONE sausage for $6? And i mean breakfast size sausage... that wasn't memorable at all. The sides were delicious. BBQ beans with pork, BBQ fried rice with BBQ meat and mac&cheese are so good!All in all, I would stick with ribs and sides if you choose to come here.",3.0
I've been here twice now with the girlfriend. Both times were good. Depending on what you get I think they have better items than others and also the price can be a big difference. I think their brisket is good. Nothing I'd go out of my way for but definitely tasty. Skip the fries as a side and get their Mac and cheese and baked beans. Their fried okra is great too! We got wings for an app recently they were better than expected with a dry rub then sauce added on. My girlfriend got their lamb slider which looked like a burger the size you would get at Burger King. It was really good and she got two sides for only $8 total!! They also have a good beer selection but we're out of my first two choices that I wanted first. Disappointing that they didn't update their chalk board. We'll definitely be back.,4.0
"Pretty good BBQ. Had the family style with 8 people, we got the poutine, extra brisket, mac and cheese, wings and some other items that I cannot recall at this point because I was so stuffed with food I'm trying to forget.The brisket was the star - everyone loved it (I liked the fattier sides), the wings were good with honey bbq and my friends who got the buffalo enjoyed theirs as well. The poutine was good, but didn't have that much meat on top. The ribs were fine, but not a must for me. I also thought the mac and cheese had a weird flavor, but liked the mashed potatoes and gravy.We had a lovely waitress (i think her name was Kenya) who was very attentive and sweet! Made our experience very nice. Overall I would come back if I was with a group so I could have a nice spread :)",4.0
"After a less than pleasing day, I stumbled across Dino's while looking for something to eat and DRINK, while on a business trip.I ordered some food to go, but decided to have my libations at the bar while I waited. Great idea #1. I ordered a Tito's Dirty Martini from the mixologist. I was little worried because I do not like vermouth in my dirty martini. However, she was making a little different than I had seen in the past, so I decided to let her be the expert. Great idea #2. Rachel poured the vermouth over the ice in the martini glass while she let it chill. Then dumped it all out so you had just the essence of the Vermouth. A delicious dirty martini.I decided to eat my to go food at the bar. The food was good and the atmosphere was friendly. Rachel had complete control of the bar, making drinks and ordering food with Richie. And there were plenty of TVs to watch.",4.0
Best smoked chicken wings on the east coast. If you don't like their wings you don't deserve a pulse.,5.0
"*Must Try: Tres Ninos, a sampler of Brisket, Ribs, and Pulled Pork.*Brisket is amazing!*Swag Sampler: Spicy Shrimp Boil, Chicken Wings, Fried Green Tomatoes, Deviled Eggs.*Collard Greens are okay, get Mashed Potatoes instead.",4.0
"Not the best BBQ (and I think the Harlem location is better), but surprisingly great sides! I loved the mac and cheese and collard greens.The meat...not so much. The pork ribs were bland and the brisket wasn't moist (sorry to anyone with an aversion to that word). Portions were smaller than I was expecting.Aside from that, lots of seating and seems like a popular spot for families. Convenient to get to as it's right by the R. It's also close to Royal Palms and Ample Hills Creamery.P.S. Don't just walk in and order at the counter (that's for take-out). We made that mistake. Oops.",3.0
"8:20. Friday night. Restaurant is out of BBQ beans, BBQ fried rice, mashed potatoes (?), and MAC AND CHEESE(?!?!).In a borough with such good BBQ options, go ELSEWHERE.  REALLY disappointing. On the plus side: drinks were well made. Wait staff was very friendly. Not their fault, but sort of a ridiculous situation.  Verdict:  if I'm standing outside of Dinosaur BBQ and I'm not starving to death, I'm going to Yelp ""Barbeque"" and go elsewhere.",1.0

"Believe the hype, this place is amazing. Make sure you make a reservation if it's the weekend, because everyone else knows it's amazing too. As decided by my completely objective boyfriend and I, the best bbq meat is the brisket. It was so flavorful and delicious! If it's a bit dry, make sure to add some of their excellent house bbq sauce. The ribs came in second.. they were juciy and fatty, perfect all around. As for sides, we think the baked beans were the best.. I devoured mine in an instant. The mac and cheese and coleslaw were also quite good. The only drawback for me is the price. You can get bbq in NJ that's on par for quite a few dollars less. Oh well, I had a great experience here and that's all that matters!",5.0
"The first thing I need to say is that this Dinosaur BBQ has an outstanding beer selection. I was shocked when I sat down and glanced at the beer menu. Yes, beer menu. I had never actually eaten in the restaurant (takeout only) so I was assuming I'd have to choose the least sugar-filled over-sized frozen beverage Dallas BBQ style. I was wrong.Our waitress (Raven) was super knowledgeable about the beers and more than happy to grab us a few tastes. We loved all of her recommendations; I wound up with the Dino Ape Hanger Ale ($5 a pint!). It was flavorful but light enough to leave room for all that meat :P My fiancé got a flight, the Kentucky Bourbon Ale knocking it out of the park. I also like that you can get 1/2 pint. I mean, who wants to pay for a full beer unless you can finish the whole thing.The food is great. I've had better pulled pork and brisket, but the ribs are amazing. Crispy, sweet, tangy, a little spice and just enough smoke. The sides are give or take, depending on the side and depending on the day. The mac&cheese and mashed are always solid... The collard greens are tasty but a little too sweet for my liking. When I didn't think the meal could get any better, they brought over some chocolate pudding mud pie type thing on the house for my my future hub's Bday!! A small gesture, but not many places do that anymore. Oh. And the wings. Just get them.",4.0
"The time that we came in mid-April, they had closed off a portion of their restaurant.  For what reason, I have no idea but I know it wasn't for a private party.  It was just empty.  Since a section was closed off, my family of 11 people had a wait a while to get a table, as there were many other people waiting as well on a Saturday evening.  Luckily the weather was nice outside for that time of April.  Once seated, we already knew what we were going to order since we had time to look through the menu while waiting.  Our family ordered the two Swag Sampler plates for the appetizer, which included drunken spicy shrimp boil, chicken wings, fried green tomatoes and deviled eggs.  Everything was good except the shrimp...the shrimp was a bit over cooked, it had a rubbery texture.   For the main course, we decided that it would be better to order the deluxe family package deal. We ended up ordering 3...at first I thought it was two.  By the time we were all almost done eating to two platters, we were stuffed and there was still some leftover food, another platter came out.  We ended up taking it to go.   The Deluxe family deal included 1 whole BBQ chicken (6pieces), 1 full rack of ribs, 1lb BBQ pork or brisket, 3 pints of sides, 6 rolls/corn bread.   Everything was delicious.  The only minor issue that I had was that the cole slaw was too acidic.  Other than that, I really enjoyed myself, being it was my first time ever dining at a Dino BBQ... I definitely wouldn't mind having another family dinner here.   Also, the donkey punch drink was good.   I also wouldn't mind going to just grab a drink...who's down??",4.0

Everyone ended up ordering the cheesecake. The menu states that the cheesecake come with a mixed berry topping. When we got the cheesecake there was a caramel topping. One of my coworkers asked if she can get a cake with the mixed berry topping to which the waitress replied.... Wait for it....  ""there is no mixed berry topping at this time!"" WHAT??!!!?!!!?!!?!!? Maybe this is a fluke day or maybe certain items are just not ready during the lunch time. But if that is the case have a lunch time menu instead of having the waitress say every two seconds ""we don't have any of that at this time"" Needless to say I'm not in a rush back.

It was a number of minutes before she returned with the fries and Mac and cheese. At the end of the meal everyone decided to order dessert to go. We got the dessert menu and everyone chose either the cheesecake or the chocolate cake. When we began to order we were told that the chocolate cake wasn't available. WHAT??!!!?!?, change of plans. Everyone ended up ordering the cheesecake. The menu states that the cheesecake come with a mixed berry topping. When we got the cheesecake there was a caramel topping. One of my coworkers asked if she can get a cake with the mixed berry topping to which the waitress replied.... Wait for it....  ""there is no mixed berry topping at this time!"" WHAT??!!!?!!!?!!?!!? Maybe this is a fluke day or maybe certain items are just not ready during the lunch time. But if that is the case have a lunch time menu instead of having the waitress say every two seconds ""we don't have any of that at this time"" Needless to say I'm not in a rush back. The food was good but the service was horrible. Maybe I'll return in another 2 years.",1.0
"I generally don't leave reviews. If you like ribs this place is good, for what you can get in NYC. My issue is with management. Had a reservation, got there early, plenty of available tables and still waited close to our reservation time; unfortunately this is not the first time it happened. The idea is to sit people as fast as possible and sell them as much as possible. That's  what every business should strive for.Food was good, service is always friendly.",4.0
"My boyfriend and I came here on a Saturday around 4:30. It was packed already but looked like a few tables were opening up so we felt good about that. 20 minutes later three two tops are still open as the host staff stares at their screen like they don't understand how technology works. Beyond inefficient doesn't even begin to explain the incompetence of the two working up front. I saw multiple four tops also remain open for 10+ minutes. On top of all of that, after we waited 25+ minutes one couple came in and seemed to know a cook that came out from the back. The cook had a bro moment with the male hostess  and discussed getting a table and of course the couple had a table within a minute of arriving. I hope the servers realize they are losing money due to these imbeciles. Luckily our server (teddy) was nice and personable and the food came out fairly fast. The wings are better at Morgan's on Flatbush. The chicken and brisket were good. The Mac and cheese was basic but still had a good creaminess to it. The cornbread was fantastic, individually made so a little crispy all around. Lesson learned and reason why they lost a star: make a reservation or get screwed by the dummies up front at the host stand.",3.0

"My husband and I visited on a Friday evening for dinner - it was busy, but there was still space to sit. We were seated right away and our server was attentive and nice. Her name was Sara and she had great menu suggestions!Yes, the food is freaking tasty!! but let me tell you about how quickly it came out. I've NEVER been served this fast. The food came out less than 5 minutes after we ordered it. Yes, literally less than 5 minutes! These folks are fast, and yes, delicious.I ordered the Pork BBQ Classic Sandwich with Macaroni & Cheese and Black Eyes Pea with Kale for sides. My husband for the 3-meat samples, with 2 orders of Ribs, 1 order of Drunken Shrimp, and the Seasonal Cucumber Salad and Fried BBQ Rice as sides.At first, I thought the portions were a bit small, but by the time I was done, I was comfortable full and very happy that I came here to indulge in BBQ. My husband was delighted as well, barely sparing a few words while he was eating. The best complement I can give is that my husband and I will happily come back here, and we certainly will be back as soon as possible :)",5.0

"Came here on Sunday for an earlier dinner with my Lady. I ordered the Dino Burger for the 1st time. And she had the combo with 2 meats. Pulled pork and st Louis ribs, with mac and cheese side and beans. Needless to say, it was awesome. My burger was extremely juicy and flavorful. The hint of the zip sauce was nice, would have preferred some more on the burger, but it was good. According to the menu, the burger was supposed to contain jalapenos, but I didn't taste nor see it. But that's fine with me because the burger over all was awesome. I didn't expect it to be this to be so good since its a burger at a BBQ joint. The mac and cheese I ordered was perfect, cheese melted with a hint of spiciness. I also ordered the chili which was immaculate to say the least. Tasty all around. The ribs pretty much fell off the bone as soon as you bite into it. The smokiness of the ribs was delectable. The pulled pork was also wonderful. Succulent and not dry by any means. I always enjoyed the fact that they never over power the meat with BBQ sauce, instead the give it just enough to enjoy, and allow for the customer to put more at their leisure with the different types of sauce at the table. I enjoy coming here.Staff:So far, I have yet to be disappointed with the staff here. Very polite, smiles all around and helpful, not over bearing like some places who don't give you a chance to taste the food before they ask you 17 times ""hows the food?"". Only hiccup during this visit is the airing of dirty laundry. Not a good look when staff discusses their issues with a fellow co worker at the greeting/hostess table and 4 or 5 workers entertain it. Overall. 4.5 stars for me. You can never go wrong with great BBQ and this place has great bbq. You barely have to wait that long for your food and its top notch. Drinks are great here. Dont have alot of money but want a great buzz, get yourself the donkey punch. I will keep coming here until the place closes. Thanks for the great food and great atmosphere.",4.0

"Bottom line: Great food, but the service lets it down a little.Went on Sunday at around 6pm and the place was packed! We were told it was a 30 minute wait for a table for two. Went to  bar for a drink and was called 20 minutes later saying our table was ready. We were seated and saw lots of free tables around us, so not sure what the wait was for.Ordered the lemonade cocktail, a beer and the sweetheart deal (rack of ribs, cornbread and 4 sides - we got the collard greens, fries, mac&cheese and coleslaw). Beer arrived quickly, but was told that they ran out of the cocktail, so I ordered a vodka soda instead. Food arrived, but no knives...we kind of had to struggle to pull the ribs apart with our (very flimsy) forks. Everything was delicious though. The ribs were moist and flavorful. They didn't need any sauce at all. Fries were crispy and seasoned perfectly. The rest of the sides were tasty too.Half way through eating, my drink hadn't arrived (was told that the barman had to go get some vodka..?!) and we were told we could have knives now (I assume they had run out? What sort of a meat place runs out of knives?!).Drink finally arrived and the server was kind enough to take it off the bill.As a side note, the table behind us ordered the mashed potatoes and were told that they had run out of that too....at 6:30pm!Asked to see the dessert menu but was told they had run out of menus! Ordered the lemon ice box pie, which was sweet and tart and lovely.Would definitely go back for the food - it was good value and delicious, but perhaps next time we'll try a quieter night to see if the service is any better.",3.0

Our table was a typical two-seater, which they should completely get rid of due to the size of their portions and plates. Once our bone bucket, plates, utensils and drinks came, we had to move everything around to fit it all. We started with the deviled eggs for an app. They were great, but piled a little to high to be manageable. We got the Sweetheart Deal for dinner. $31.50 for a full rack of ribs and 4 sides.

It seemed that everything was heavily seasoned with a peppery/Cajun seasoning - which my boyfriend loved, but I just wanted plain Mac n cheese. The cornbread was dry and had no flavor.

"We walked by Dino bbq and decided to stop in since we were hungry and had some time to kill. And boy did we kill some time! While we were seated right away, our server was MIA for a few minutes before coming over. We started to joke that we may need to flag him down by the end of the meal (and this actually became the case quite a few times since you wouldn't see him at all for about 20 minutes at a time).I ordered the pulled pork sandwich with loaded mashed potatoes (gravy, cheese, and bacon) and corn bread on the side. The pulled pork sandwich was a good size but the pork inside was huge chunks which made it pretty sloppy to eat. The mashed potatoes were just average to me, plus there was some sort of pepper in either the gravy or the potatoes themselves that gave them a little zing which my friend and I didn't like. The cornbread was just average as well; it was very corn mealy and a bit on the dry side.The desserts passing by our table looked pretty good though!We left full but to me it was average at best.

"My boyfriend had this in Syracuse, so he had to have the Brooklyn branch. I have to say it's okay. It's a popular spot so the wait is like an hour on a Friday night. The service was average.

The food...wellI had the sweetheart deal with my boyfriend which is a full rack of ribs, four sides, and two corn breads for around $32.

Well we've been meaning to get in here for months and months but finally we decided tonight to come to Dino barbecue-I was amazed at how large space that it is and it's all bricked actually a beautiful industrial building.  The service was a little bit slow- considering it was a Sunday night it was still very busy in the restaurant.We ordered some samplings of some chicken wings for an appetizer and then we had brisket which was delicious but a little on the fatty side and ribs which were also very good- this is the real deal they have a smoker and they smoke everything and it's very good it's not like the fake barbecue that you get in some other places this is real southern style barbecue. there were many large groups and a lot of children in the restaurant as well it's suitable for both.We snagged a nice booth on the side which was quiet for couples in conversation.We enjoyed it a lot and hopefully we will have the opportunity to come back and eat there again..,4.0
"I had really high expectations for Dinosaur BBQ, given all the hype. I had been to the likes of Mighty Quinn's, Fette Sau, and Hill Country, all the way to Dallas BBQ and Bro J's, so I've seen the different sides of the BBQ spectrum. I often compare everything to Mighty Quinn's, because so far, I think Mighty Quinn's has the best all-around barbecue in the city. I had only ever had Dino BBQ for takeout, so I wanted to get the full experience at the restaurant. Needless to say, the barbecue at Dino graded out very well. They're a bit lighter with smoking the meat than some other joints, but I still thought everything was great.Came in a group of 4 and got the Family Stylin' BBQ, which included a pound of beef brisket, a rack of ribs, a whole chicken, 3 large sides, and 6 cornbread muffins. For about $70, it was a huge amount of food. We got the mashed potatoes, mac and cheese, and chili as our sides. Brisket: Good flavor and fat content, but slightly on the rubbery side. Mighty Quinn's wins this battle hands down.Ribs: Fall off the bone, and you don't even need the sauce for flavoring. Tie with Mighty Quinn's. Chicken: Moist and tender, but needed the sauce for flavor. Hill Country's BBQ chicken wins in this case.Sides: Mashed potatoes were standard but great, mac & cheese was unbelievably creamy and delicious, and the chili was meaty, but came out cold. Cornbread muffins were soft and buttery, just like cornbread should be. Hoho, yeah. While I tend to like the uniqueness of Mighty Quinn's sides better, the fact that they don't offer soul food staples like mac & cheese, collard greens, and mashed potatoes brings them down a notch. Winner: Dino BBQ.Service was attentive, and our waitress did very well in making recommendations. We got our food fairly quickly and everything came out hot and fresh, except the chili. Maybe pass on the chili. Anyways, for a meal that feeds up to 6 people, we managed to finish everything except a quarter of the chili and the 2 remaining pieces of cornbread. Yeah, it was that good. Also, we easily could have fed 1 more person, but decided to go with gluttony and stuff ourselves silly. With all that, the train ride back to Manhattan was pretty brutal, since we all just wanted to go back to our homes and relax ourselves into a comatose state.Note: The R train is the only train that stops right by Dino BBQ, and runs within Brooklyn and within Manhattan, but won't run between Whitehall Street and Court street until October 2014. If you're coming from Manhattan, you'll likely have to transfer to the R at Atlantic Av, or another stop within Brooklyn. Overall, I might wait until the R Train starts running between Brooklyn and Manhattan before I go again, but the value and quality at Dinosaur BBQ is one of the best for barbecue in New York City.",4.0

"We've been twice and had bad experiences both times. The first, we waited for a long time, were seated and had decided on our orders before being told they had run out of brisket. This wasn't late at night, it was like 7:45 pm. Considering it's a restaurant with basically three main course options, you'd think this would bear mentioning, right?The second, last night, service was just awful, in a couple of ways. Some mundane but annoying service issues: appetizer plates weren't cleared until well after we received our main dishes. The waiter tried to upsell my dining companion in a scammy way: my friend ordered a sandwich with one side, but the waiter told him he could order a second too. ""Tt comes with two,"" he said. This was false: the menu has a sandwich option with one side and a ""platter"" option with two -- which of course costs extra.That same friend ordered his sandwich with no jalapeno peppers. It arrived with peppers. His mashed potatoes, ordered with gravy on the side, had gravy poured on already. This sort of thing happens, it's no big deal if it gets fixed. He told the waiter, who said he'd fix it. At least ten minutes later pass.What happened during that ten or so minutes -- besides the rest of us eating before our food got cold -- I don't know.Finally, a second sandwich came out. Guess what, it still had jalapeno peppers. (The potatoes were right this time.)At this point, he asked to speak to a manager, who apologized, etc. and got a third sandwich pretty much immediately, this time without peppers. The manager promised to comp his meal.

"Was really disappointed at the service. Went on a Friday night for a party of two. They told us the wait was 45 mins to an hour yet other people (party of two as well) that came later than us had a seat before us.

At this point, we waited for around 50 minutes already. So we waited and waited. More people that came after us got a seat before us as well. When we ask the host why this has happened, she just said it in a casual and rude manner telling us to wait. (It was not busy as well, there were many seatings) we ask to double check the number and it turns out she had the wrong number all along. The number was the only way to let us know our table was ready and they actually had the wrong numbers all this time. We asked multiple of times when our table was ready. She never ever said sorry and couldn't care less either. She was extremely rude about it too. I just find that really upsetting that WE, the customers, had to clarify our number for the host. After we waited for another 10 more minutes, she finally sat us, at the most crappiest smallest table ever. The customer service was terrible at this place is terrible. The waiter only came to my table twice throughout the entire time(including asking for check) and I wanted a refill and order but no one was there to accompany us because we sat all the way toward the back.  The only time my waiter came fast to the table was when we asked for check and to collect my cc.

Don't waste your time with the corn muffins.  Even dipped in Dino's famous BBQ sauce they were still dry.Enjoy the atmosphere of Dino.  It's lively yet comfortable and feels like home.  Ahhh I just love this place.  Sooo glad it came to Brooklyn!",5.0

OMG! I have found my new BBQ go to spot in Brooklyn.I stopped in one evening to try the food and placed a take out order for their bbq kansas ribs with potato salad and collard greens. They had live music playing when I arrived and I must say it sounded pretty good. The restaurant decor reminded me of an old fashioned bar saloon that you'd see in an old western movie. The staff was friendly and wasted no time in greeting customers and offering their help. When I got home and tried the potato salad I was amazed. One of my co-workers mom makes the absolute best potato salad I have EVER tasted and she must've sold her recipe to dinosaur bbq-an exact duplication. The kansas ribs were also excellent and the sauce was full of flavors other than sweet sugar. I wrote this review immediately after tasting a few bites of the food but I hadn't yet tried the collard greens. But based on what I've tasted so far I'm sure the collard greens would be just as delicious as the rest of the food. I'll definitely be returning in the future.,5.0

"My boyfriend and I just got back from Dinosaur BBQ Brooklyn. He ordered the Tres Niños (pork, brisket, and 1/4 rack of ribs with two sides--mac n cheese and fries--and cornbread) and I ordered the House Special (leg/thigh of chicken and 1/3-1/4 rack of ribs with two sides--mac n cheese and mashed potatoes---and cornbread). We both agreed that the ribs were the best of our meats. They had the perfect amount of flavor (they aren't drenched in sauce but that's what I like) and there was plenty of meat that was definitely falling off the bone. I also thoroughly enjoyed my chicken--it was tender, juicy, and well-seasoned. Our favorite side, by far, was the Mac n Cheese. It's a little bit spicy and wonderfully cheesy. We also each enjoyed our potato sides and the cornbread. The only disappointing parts of the meal were the brisket and the pulled pork.

Great selection of beers, awesome ambiance - you truly can't go wrong.But tonight was extra awesome because we sat at the bar and our bartender Rachel was just straight up stellar. From her fabulous manicure to her outgoing personality, Rachel really made our night. She was attentive, funny, kind, and just overall super cool. I would go back just to have her as our bartender again (and we live in Astoria!) So props to Rachel and the rest of the crew at Dino Brooklyn. You have the Syracuse stamp of approval ;)",5.0

"Charming Fossil of a Place in Park SlopeSuper busy sightseeing and visiting friends that we had no time to research nearby hole-in-the-walls. Dinosaur BBQ was a nice surprise at the end of a long day. We were staying at the Holiday Inn Express nearby and it was almost 10pm. The only place with any food options  whatsoever was the local bodega. I read on a pamphlet that Dino BBQ delivers to our hotel so I ordered takeout. I looked up the menu on their website and it seemed a lot of the same things just in different forms but I was too tired to decide so I chose the MEMPHIS sandwich which was pulled pork with coleslaw on a wonderful potato roll. They put a lot of flavorful meat on it--enough that I could put mix it with the baked beans and feed my daughter too.  Overall the food was excellent but I found the corn bread to be a little too grainy/crumbly. It could have been since it was the end of the night though so I wouldn't hold it against them. When I went to pick my food up I had no intention of having dessert or ordering a drink but they had Boylan soda and icebox lemon pie.  The pie was delicious, although pretty much a key lime slice, but using the word icebox in the name makes it taste better.    :)I think what I liked the best was the vibe of the place. It was comfortable and authentic with the right amount of energy and some live music. The staff was nice and accommodated me even though I ordered a few minutes before closing. The place was still quite busy though. I would definitely come back and dine inside while I excavated the entire menu.",4.0
"AMAZING!As a former 'Cuse resident, I have been to the original Dino BBQ many many times.  When the restaurant started opening up locations near Manhattan, going was a must.My boyfriend and I trekked it out there but it was so worth it.  We both got combos.  I got the pulled pork and the ribs.  The ribs fell right off the bone and the pulled pork had the sauce plopped on top of it - which is exactly how I like it because come places put too much sauce and its a soupy mess.  I also got one of the small carafes of wine - which was the perfect size (about 2.5 glasses). For sides I got mac and cheese x2 - so yummy!My boyfriend got the combo as well, but he got bbq chicken and the shrimp.  He seemed to love it and thanked me for bringing him to a place where he actually wanted everything on the menu. The service was great and we were seated as soon as we arrive (we had a reservation)Wish there was a location in Manhattan!",5.0
I really am not a negative Nancy but I am an honest Nancy. I went here the other night was seated promptly by the bathroom but that was ok. It wasn't busy when we sat but intensified as our meal went on we started off with an appetizer of deviled eggs and fried green tomatoes which were actually very very good. we also had mixed drinks which were pretty decent as well. then we moved onto the main course which was sandwiches. when the main course came out it was very cold and underwhelming. I say underwhelming not to be pretentious because let's face it I'm a guy I'll eat anything you give me and I was quite hungry too. But I do have to say is it was a very loud so loud enough that I could hardly carry on a conversation with my girlfriend and secondly the waitress we had all but ignored our table she was polite but rushed us in our ordering and all the tables around us that were seated after us were served before us I'm assuming because they order platters of barbecue food that was already prepared and under heating lamp. I've been to this same location to other times and I've had mixed results every time I'm assuming it was just because we arrive just before the dinner rush but still I don't really have a good experience I'll probably try again if I need a bbq fix in a hurry.,3.0
"Let me start off by saying I love Dinosaur BBQ's food - I went to school in Syracuse and was nostalgic for it so I figured I would try the Brooklyn location.The hostess service was the WORST I have ever encountered at a restaurant. I will never come here again and really hope the other locations do not treat their customers so poorly. We got to the restaurant around 4:45PM on a Saturday with a group of 10 people. We were told the wait would be about a half hour. Not a problem! We made our way to the bar. Around 5:20PM, a friend of mine goes up to the hostess to see how much longer the wait is - they tell her we are next on the list. Then we see a group of 16 people clear out of a table near us. I think to myself, perfect that is going to be our table! I go up to the hostess who tells us we are still next, but can't have that table because it is too big for us and pull apart the 16 person table into two 8 person tables. He says it will be a bit longer, unless we want to split into two groups of 5. I say thats fine we don't mind waiting a little bit longer. Ten minutes later they text us to be seated. We again go to the hostess stand and they have us wait up front for another 5 minutes while they finish clearing off the table. Okay, fine I thought - still not a big deal, we did get here early incase their would be a wait. A man who seemed like he may have been the manager brought us to a group of three separate tables - a 2 person table and two 4 person tables. We were then told this was the best they could do. What do you mean this is the best you can do? We told you we all wanted to sit together. We asked if we could at least push the two 4 person tables together that were 2 feet apart and we were told that was not possible. Mind you were are in the middle of the restaurant and in no way blocking the aisle. The two person table was awkwardly to the right of us. We just saw them do it for another table, but apparently the wait staff didn't want to miss out on a table in their section and therefore wouldn't accommodate us pushing the tables together. We were not given any other options except to take our disjointed seats.Needless to say, the whole experience was bizarre and not worth the frustration and discomfort that they put our whole group in. It really put a damper on the whole night. So many things could have been done better to make this a more positive experience for our group. The staff should have been upfront that they do not seat large parties and should have not just split us up in three separate tables without our knowledge or consent. The rest of the meal was mediocre at best.3 tables for a group of 10?? That is just plain absurd.",1.0

"This has always been in my ""must try"" places since we've heard good things (the fact that this place is always packed is clear evidence of that lol). The place did not disappoint!I think the biggest hurdle anyone would face here is actually getting a table. We've come here before where the wait was up to 2 hours! Fortunately, the last time we went was only 25 minutes (for a table for 3), so we got lucky. I wouldn't advise going here in a big group.The meal itself was pretty tasty. The best thing I had were the fried green tomatoes. Great batter + good cheese + ranch = mouth-watering!! Definitely get that as your appetizer. For the main coures, we ordered the ""Sweetheart Deal for 2"" (yes, we actually ordered that lol), and it was definitely more than enough food for two people. It comes with your choice of four sides, and we got mashed potatoes + gravy, mac & cheese, collard greens with turkey, and BBQ fried rice. The BBQ ribs were delicious, and some of the sides were great, too. The only thing I was meh about is the mac & cheese, sadly. They make it with pimento cheese, which is not a great cheese to make mac & cheese with, in my opinion. I actually liked the BBQ fried rice the best, which was a pleasant surprise. I also liked that their sweet tea wasn't insanely full of sugar that we would get diabetes just from drinking a glass haha.Service could have been better. It wasn't horrendous, but there were a couple of times where we had to actively search for our server because it's been a while since we saw her and we needed something (and they weren't too swamped or understaffed to justify her being MIA). Overall, though, it was great experience, and really great food that I would come back when I have a craving for BBQ!",4.0
"Hubby and I came for a double date last Saturday night. Was able to make same week reservations on OpenTable, which was awesome. Also appreciated the live band and large space inside.The four of us shared a large order of the wings (half honey bbq, half wango tango) as well as the nachos (made with chili! Delicious). Hubby and I shared the tres ninos (brisket, pulled pork, and 3 ribs) which came with cornbread (not as good as I was hoping it'd be) and 2 sides. We opted for the mac n cheese and baked beans. Everything was great! Dinosaur used to reign supreme as the best bbq in NYC, but with the recent influx of bbq joints I have to say that this place is only 4 stars in comparison. Still a solid choice, and really great value.",4.0

I must say the food is just as good as the original Dino with a few fun additions like Syracuse salt potatoes and the BBQ fried rice! We love Dino and the food is always the best. Great selection of beers, awesome ambiance - you truly can't go wrong.But tonight was extra awesome because we sat at the bar and our bartender Rachel was just straight up stellar. From her fabulous manicure to her outgoing personality, Rachel really made our night. She was attentive, funny, kind, and just overall super cool. I would go back just to have her as our bartender again (and we live in Astoria!) So props to Rachel and the rest of the crew at Dino Brooklyn. You have the Syracuse stamp of approval ;)",5.0
"Love this place....the best BBQ I had here in NYC area. It is truly smoked! I always get garlic chipolte wings - I think it is better than habanero and has a better kick. Wish they offered a happy hour for wing like the one in Newark, NJ. Get the mac and cheese too - I always add a little hot sauce as well!",5.0
"Charming Fossil of a Place in Park SlopeSuper busy sightseeing and visiting friends that we had no time to research nearby hole-in-the-walls. Dinosaur BBQ was a nice surprise at the end of a long day. We were staying at the Holiday Inn Express nearby and it was almost 10pm. The only place with any food options  whatsoever was the local bodega. I read on a pamphlet that Dino BBQ delivers to our hotel so I ordered takeout. I looked up the menu on their website and it seemed a lot of the same things just in different forms but I was too tired to decide so I chose the MEMPHIS sandwich which was pulled pork with coleslaw on a wonderful potato roll. They put a lot of flavorful meat on it--enough that I could put mix it with the baked beans and feed my daughter too.  Overall the food was excellent but I found the corn bread to be a little too grainy/crumbly. It could have been since it was the end of the night though so I wouldn't hold it against them. When I went to pick my food up I had no intention of having dessert or ordering a drink but they had Boylan soda and icebox lemon pie.  The pie was delicious, although pretty much a key lime slice, but using the word icebox in the name makes it taste better.    :)I think what I liked the best was the vibe of the place. It was comfortable and authentic with the right amount of energy and some live music. The staff was nice and accommodated me even though I ordered a few minutes before closing. The place was still quite busy though. I would definitely come back and dine inside while I excavated the entire menu.",4.0
"AMAZING!As a former 'Cuse resident, I have been to the original Dino BBQ many many times.  When the restaurant started opening up locations near Manhattan, going was a must.My boyfriend and I trekked it out there but it was so worth it.  We both got combos.  I got the pulled pork and the ribs.  The ribs fell right off the bone and the pulled pork had the sauce plopped on top of it - which is exactly how I like it because come places put too much sauce and its a soupy mess.  I also got one of the small carafes of wine - which was the perfect size (about 2.5 glasses). For sides I got mac and cheese x2 - so yummy!My boyfriend got the combo as well, but he got bbq chicken and the shrimp.  He seemed to love it and thanked me for bringing him to a place where he actually wanted everything on the menu. The service was great and we were seated as soon as we arrive (we had a reservation)Wish there was a location in Manhattan!",5.0
I really am not a negative Nancy but I am an honest Nancy. I went here the other night was seated promptly by the bathroom but that was ok. It wasn't busy when we sat but intensified as our meal went on we started off with an appetizer of deviled eggs and fried green tomatoes which were actually very very good. we also had mixed drinks which were pretty decent as well. then we moved onto the main course which was sandwiches. when the main course came out it was very cold and underwhelming. I say underwhelming not to be pretentious because let's face it I'm a guy I'll eat anything you give me and I was quite hungry too. But I do have to say is it was a very loud so loud enough that I could hardly carry on a conversation with my girlfriend and secondly the waitress we had all but ignored our table she was polite but rushed us in our ordering and all the tables around us that were seated after us were served before us I'm assuming because they order platters of barbecue food that was already prepared and under heating lamp. I've been to this same location to other times and I've had mixed results every time I'm assuming it was just because we arrive just before the dinner rush but still I don't really have a good experience I'll probably try again if I need a bbq fix in a hurry.,3.0
"Let me start off by saying I love Dinosaur BBQ's food - I went to school in Syracuse and was nostalgic for it so I figured I would try the Brooklyn location.The hostess service was the WORST I have ever encountered at a restaurant. I will never come here again and really hope the other locations do not treat their customers so poorly. We got to the restaurant around 4:45PM on a Saturday with a group of 10 people. We were told the wait would be about a half hour. Not a problem! We made our way to the bar. Around 5:20PM, a friend of mine goes up to the hostess to see how much longer the wait is - they tell her we are next on the list. Then we see a group of 16 people clear out of a table near us. I think to myself, perfect that is going to be our table! I go up to the hostess who tells us we are still next, but can't have that table because it is too big for us and pull apart the 16 person table into two 8 person tables. He says it will be a bit longer, unless we want to split into two groups of 5. I say thats fine we don't mind waiting a little bit longer. Ten minutes later they text us to be seated. We again go to the hostess stand and they have us wait up front for another 5 minutes while they finish clearing off the table. Okay, fine I thought - still not a big deal, we did get here early incase their would be a wait. A man who seemed like he may have been the manager brought us to a group of three separate tables - a 2 person table and two 4 person tables. We were then told this was the best they could do. What do you mean this is the best you can do? We told you we all wanted to sit together. We asked if we could at least push the two 4 person tables together that were 2 feet apart and we were told that was not possible. Mind you were are in the middle of the restaurant and in no way blocking the aisle. The two person table was awkwardly to the right of us. We just saw them do it for another table, but apparently the wait staff didn't want to miss out on a table in their section and therefore wouldn't accommodate us pushing the tables together. We were not given any other options except to take our disjointed seats.Needless to say, the whole experience was bizarre and not worth the frustration and discomfort that they put our whole group in. It really put a damper on the whole night. So many things could have been done better to make this a more positive experience for our group. The staff should have been upfront that they do not seat large parties and should have not just split us up in three separate tables without our knowledge or consent. The rest of the meal was mediocre at best.3 tables for a group of 10?? That is just plain absurd.",1.0
"Great ribs, quick service, had a great beer too.  My kids and I shared the sweetheart ribs deal.  full rack of ribs and 4 sides.",4.0
"This has always been in my ""must try"" places since we've heard good things (the fact that this place is always packed is clear evidence of that lol). The place did not disappoint!I think the biggest hurdle anyone would face here is actually getting a table. We've come here before where the wait was up to 2 hours! Fortunately, the last time we went was only 25 minutes (for a table for 3), so we got lucky. I wouldn't advise going here in a big group.The meal itself was pretty tasty. The best thing I had were the fried green tomatoes. Great batter + good cheese + ranch = mouth-watering!! Definitely get that as your appetizer. For the main coures, we ordered the ""Sweetheart Deal for 2"" (yes, we actually ordered that lol), and it was definitely more than enough food for two people. It comes with your choice of four sides, and we got mashed potatoes + gravy, mac & cheese, collard greens with turkey, and BBQ fried rice. The BBQ ribs were delicious, and some of the sides were great, too. The only thing I was meh about is the mac & cheese, sadly. They make it with pimento cheese, which is not a great cheese to make mac & cheese with, in my opinion. I actually liked the BBQ fried rice the best, which was a pleasant surprise. I also liked that their sweet tea wasn't insanely full of sugar that we would get diabetes just from drinking a glass haha.Service could have been better. It wasn't horrendous, but there were a couple of times where we had to actively search for our server because it's been a while since we saw her and we needed something (and they weren't too swamped or understaffed to justify her being MIA). Overall, though, it was great experience, and really great food that I would come back when I have a craving for BBQ!",4.0
"Hubby and I came for a double date last Saturday night. Was able to make same week reservations on OpenTable, which was awesome. Also appreciated the live band and large space inside.The four of us shared a large order of the wings (half honey bbq, half wango tango) as well as the nachos (made with chili! Delicious). Hubby and I shared the tres ninos (brisket, pulled pork, and 3 ribs) which came with cornbread (not as good as I was hoping it'd be) and 2 sides. We opted for the mac n cheese and baked beans. Everything was great! Dinosaur used to reign supreme as the best bbq in NYC, but with the recent influx of bbq joints I have to say that this place is only 4 stars in comparison. Still a solid choice, and really great value.",4.0

"Thanks to Yelp I discover a Dinosaur BBQ in Brooklyn. Much closer than the Harlem location. I didn't have a reservation so I waited for a table.

"I ordered pulled pork and brisket as well as sides of Mac and cheese and mashed potatoes. I also shared an appetizer of Dino poutine overall the food was solid but nothing over the top. The price point was a little high for the quantity we received. The staff was a two so that averages to three stars. We weren't greeted by the hostess. She seemed bored and disinterested. The waitress also did not bring the right sized drink, it was a pint rather than a half pint. We were not given silverware had to ask two different servers. The silverware that was on our table was used from the previous customer and was not taken off the table we almost used it until we realized the wipes were already open thus used. The servers were watching NASCAR on TV and being very loud and a bit over the top. One cleaner was observed taking away children's high chairs visibly upset at the mess that was left and he was slamming the plates and cups into the basket and at one point scattered ice all over the floor because he was throwing them in there. I guess having to do a bit of broom cleaning after a table with three toddlers was too much for his patience. The staff is not the most professional. I'm assuming the owners want to hire from the local community which is a nice thing to do but they need to either train and supervise their staff better or find people willing to do the job. Hopefully they get the message - more BBQ places are popping up around Brooklyn and they need to prioritize the customer's experience over other matters before it starts to jeopardize their business.",3.0
"Came here on a Saturday - we had to wait a while for seating because it was packed and we had a large group. I liked the vibe here -- the place is pretty big and they had live music.The food was very good but overall, a bit too spicy. I ordered 12 mild wings (half and half: honey bbq & hoisin sesame) and those were pretty spicy, not sure if I'd call that mild. Btw, mild was the least spicy option - there was no plain. Also got a side of black eyed peas and kale - very good but also pretty spicy and that didn't even have 'spicy' in the title. I am not one of these people that recoils at the hint of pepper either....I like moderately spicy food. This was a hefty amount of spice. I also got an appetizer of fried green tomatoes - delicious and not spicy! The sauce had a kick though.

"Visited Dinosaur BBQ with three of my girlfriends and unfortunately I was not impressed. In fact, I was let down. I wanted to visit this place for quite some time now and finally took the trip out to Brooklyn. Even before walking in, you could smell the smokey barbecue scent, so I was excited. I ordered the combo plate of pulled pork and ribs with Mac and cheese, baked beans and a small piece of corn bread. The pulled pork was very fatty and the smokey taste was so overwhelming that you couldn't even taste the meat. It overpowered everything. The ribs were tough and I struggled to get the meat off the bone. The baked beans were just okay, nothing special and the corn bread was very hard, dense, and had no sweetness to it at all, not even a hint. Out of everything on the plate, the mac and cheese was the best part and even that wasn't good. It tasted like someone dropped the pepper shaker in the dish. There were huge flakes of black pepper throughout my small scoop of macaroni.  My friends had the same experience with their food as well. One got wings, and the other two got the combo plates with chicken and pulled pork. I felt bad giving one star but I'm not too sure this place deserves two.

"I ordered pulled pork and brisket as well as sides of Mac and cheese and mashed potatoes. I also shared an appetizer of Dino poutine overall the food was solid but nothing over the top. The price point was a little high for the quantity we received. The staff was a two so that averages to three stars. We weren't greeted by the hostess. She seemed bored and disinterested. The waitress also did not bring the right sized drink, it was a pint rather than a half pint. We were not given silverware had to ask two different servers. The silverware that was on our table was used from the previous customer and was not taken off the table we almost used it until we realized the wipes were already open thus used. The servers were watching NASCAR on TV and being very loud and a bit over the top. One cleaner was observed taking away children's high chairs visibly upset at the mess that was left and he was slamming the plates and cups into the basket and at one point scattered ice all over the floor because he was throwing them in there. I guess having to do a bit of broom cleaning after a table with three toddlers was too much for his patience. The staff is not the most professional. I'm assuming the owners want to hire from the local community which is a nice thing to do but they need to either train and supervise their staff better or find people willing to do the job. Hopefully they get the message - more BBQ places are popping up around Brooklyn and they need to prioritize the customer's experience over other matters before it starts to jeopardize their business.",3.0
"Came here on a Saturday - we had to wait a while for seating because it was packed and we had a large group. I liked the vibe here -- the place is pretty big and they had live music.The food was very good but overall, a bit too spicy. I ordered 12 mild wings (half and half: honey bbq & hoisin sesame) and those were pretty spicy, not sure if I'd call that mild. Btw, mild was the least spicy option - there was no plain. Also got a side of black eyed peas and kale - very good but also pretty spicy and that didn't even have 'spicy' in the title. I am not one of these people that recoils at the hint of pepper either....I like moderately spicy food. This was a hefty amount of spice. I also got an appetizer of fried green tomatoes - delicious and not spicy! The sauce had a kick though. Overall, good food but if you are really not into spicy food, you might want to check with your server beforehand and see what the safest item on the menu is.",4.0
"We had our daughters 1st birthday here and the staff went above and beyond. Our guests are still talking about the amazing food and great service!

"From the shrimp app to the beef rib to the catfish to the effin mac & cheese and collard greens, Dino BBQ you rocked my damn world!

The service was impeccable thanks to Lamont...!",5.0
Im in love...the french fries and ribs are perfect. You read correctly! ! The bbq sauce tastes great but the dry rub on the ribs is enough for me on every other bite.  The smokers they use is the difference between this place and the others. You can smell them from outside and the meat falls off the bone when you are eating. Enjoy!!!!!!,5.0
"Okay, this gets a 4 star because the deviled eggs and potato salad alone are scrumptious.  The brisket is yummy, but I like mine on the fattier side so it can be a crap shoot for me.  And the pulled pork has a unique taste in it that I like (but my husband is perplexed by and steers clear).Wish they made burnt ends because I know they would be deliriously good.However, they lose a star because I have feel like I have to sell a kidney to get a Saturday seating.",4.0

"Visited Dinosaur BBQ with three of my girlfriends and unfortunately I was not impressed. In fact, I was let down. I wanted to visit this place for quite some time now and finally took the trip out to Brooklyn. Even before walking in, you could smell the smokey barbecue scent, so I was excited. I ordered the combo plate of pulled pork and ribs with Mac and cheese, baked beans and a small piece of corn bread. The pulled pork was very fatty and the smokey taste was so overwhelming that you couldn't even taste the meat. It overpowered everything. The ribs were tough and I struggled to get the meat off the bone. The baked beans were just okay, nothing special and the corn bread was very hard, dense, and had no sweetness to it at all, not even a hint. Out of everything on the plate, the mac and cheese was the best part and even that wasn't good. It tasted like someone dropped the pepper shaker in the dish. There were huge flakes of black pepper throughout my small scoop of macaroni.  My friends had the same experience with their food as well. One got wings, and the other two got the combo plates with chicken and pulled pork. I felt bad giving one star but I'm not too sure this place deserves two. I had very high hopes for the food here and unfortunately I was let down.  I don't think I will be returning.",2.0

"The short of it: Extremely dry brisket, deceptive pricing, under average service, dessert that gave everybody stomach problems. Meh. I've been to this Dino BBQ one other time and remember it being delicious, so maybe this past Saturday night was just a fluke. But, I was super disappointed to say the least. I came with a group of 4 other friends, and we shared the sausage, cheese, and crackers appetizer. This was the highlight of our night. And it all went downhill from there. The first confusion and disappointment came when ordering. My best friend ordered the Tres Ninos (what was supposed to be a smaller portion of ribs, pork, and brisket) and I ordered the exact same but in combo form. Our waiter told us that my portion should have been larger. But, when the food arrived, our entrees were exactly the SAME SIZE. In fact, she seemed to get a larger portion than I did. Why, then, was her meal only $15.95, and mine $20.95? Not worth it. If you are okay with ordering the tres ninos, go down that route. The combo is a waste of money, and honestly feels a bit deceptive. Another miss at the table was the brisket. Maybe we got a bad piece as a table, but the brisket was so dry. Now, I understand that it was lean brisket, but even then, the meat was tough and hard to chew. There was no juice, and only one person in our partner finished their portion. The next complaint I have was about the service. Our waiter was nice, but he was never there. We waited almost 30 minutes to get our check, and even longer to pay. When one of my friends needed a refill, he waited almost 30 minutes for another waitress to walk by. Even then, she told us she couldn't help us and we would have to wait for our waiter. When we explained that we've been trying to spot him for a long time, she just apologized and told us she'd let him know if she saw him. Are you serious? I understand the service policies put into place, but this was ridiculous. Finally, for dessert, our table shared two of the chocolate pies. These were DELICIOUS....until we all got home and all started feeling sick. Now, maybe it wasn't the pie, but a few members of our table definitely commented on feeling queasy after eating it. All in all, we spent over $150 at our table and were left disappointed. Again, maybe this was a fluke. But I would think twice about ever frequenting Dino BBQ again.",2.0

My husband was over-the-moon about the house sausage, which has a great country-style texture, and tasty seasoning. Even better was the service.

I added ketchup and some more BBQ sauce and it still was barely edible to me. My boyfriend said his brisket had no flavor. Maybe we ordered the wrong things.

So he went to the host stand & the host apologized saying it was shift change and that someone would be with us shortly.  Yet, still no one came for another 10 minutes. We could clearly see servers working outside, just apparently not at our table!Finally our server arrived and I let her know how long we had been waiting and she was pretty ""meh"" about it.We ordered our food and let's just say with Fletcher's Brooklyn Barbecue and Hometown Bar-B-Que not too far away and even Hill Country Barbecue Market downtown, Dinosaur is open and in business because they are cheap. Their food is pretty mediocre compared to the pros doing it at the 3 spots I mentioned and while they all offer a different style of service, if you are going to have table service then maybe you should pay attention to your tables.Mind you, I am not some whiney, out of touch complainer. I work in Food & Beverage and have been for 26 years. There was not an ounce of professionalism or a speck of remorse by anyone there other than the host. The clincher came as we were leaving; this snotty ""kid"" who is an employee there came and sat 2 tables away and in a whiney voice said ""I've been waiting here 20 minutes and no one has come to my table"". I wanted to tell him it was more like 35 minutes, get your f*cken facts straight but I have no time for small minds like that.

"4.5 stars...Between Dino BBQ and Might Quinns I've completely forgotten my plans to travel down south for BBQ. NYC is where it's at, no joke. Dinosaur BBQ was the go-to spot for BBQ where I went to school in Rochester (their second location after Syracuse). After much success branching out to Harlem they've really starting to open locations all over the place, it's sort of like Shake Shack in that way. Gowanus is the latest in openings. If you've ever been to a Dino BBQ spot, they are incredibly consistent in their style, layout, and menu options. It's a rustic combination of a garage, a barn, and a honky tonk; most of all it's just a great BBQ restaurant. Depending on when you come it can be overwhelmingly busy or laid back. They also ocassionally have live music. Like any good BBQ joint you can get meats by the pound but your best bet is to get one of their combo platters with a couple sides. The best deal in my opinion is $17 for a choice of two meats with two sides and cornbread. I always go for ribs (3-4) and pulled pork. Both are cooked to perfection, have a good smoke flavor, and don't come with sauce on top. You choose from the three options at the table if you'd like to add sauce. The pulled pork is good with a little but the ribs certainly don't need anything. The sides I opted for were the beans and chili. The chili didn't blow me away and it was hard to eat off a plate with a shallow section, it was still decent and had a kick to it. I've also tried their mac and cheese in the past and they make a great one. Food aside their drink list (especially beer) is huge. I wouldn't mind the prices being a tad lower but otherwise I'm impressed with the thought they put into it. If you're thinking about coming here during dinner time, especially on a Thursday-Saturday I would recommend calling at least a few days in advance for a reservation, spots to fill up quickly.",4.0
"Soooo much better than waiting in Harlem for hours : ) gotta love Brooklyn!Ordered the 1/2 rack with Mac and cheese and the black eyed peas.  Proud to say I was a fat girl and finished everything but one rib.  The Mac and cheese was great, had spice and just the right amount of creamy cheese.  The portion was really good for under $20.I will most certainly be frequenting Dino more!",4.0

You don't have to even ask me twice if I want Dinosaur BBQ because the answer will be yes! Ive always loved Dino BBQ. The staff is friendly and the service is quick. Only this time I noticed that the food was not as on point as it used to be. Some things were a hit and some things were a miss. The chicken wings are amazing!!! The deviled eggs and the ribs were good as well but I was not too crazy about my main course. I ordered 2 pork sliders with a side of mac n' cheese and the Harlem potato salad. I really hate to say that I was disappointed because I really do like this place but its the truth. The pork was pretty bland the mac n' cheese was not very cheesy and the potato salad was not good either. Im not quiet sure where things went wrong here but the food has decreased in flavor. I cant say that I'll be running back here but I will still be rooting for Dino BBQ hope they can change things back to the way they used to be!,3.0
"Came in with a group of 6 and sat at the bar while we waited for our table. The inside is made to look like a barn but it's nothing original considering so many restaurants use this cliche kitschy old antiques hanging on the walls concept. I ordered the ""pick two"" option and chose brisket and ribs. The ribs were great! Fall-off-the-bone type. The brisket was rather disappointing as it was way too fatty. Also ordered a side of the collard greens which were very good along with the mac and cheese which was tasty but not mind blowing. Just loaded with heavy cream.  Mid-way through my meal, I ordered the jalapeno cucumber margarita which tasted like it was missing the jalapeno component. Plus, it was overly sweet to the point where I had to add water to it. It was decent but I wouldn't return.",2.0

"Dino BBQ, so much hype. Half of the ribs were dry and hard to chew.The brisket they have is the dry kind with no fat.The pulled pork was also dry and some of it looked white like chicken. There are only two options for BBQ sauces and one is really just the spicy version of the other. I found the sauces way too tangy/sour. What about those who just want a lot of sweetness with a twang of tang?The potato salad was good and came in a good portion.The pork and beans were also good although maybe too tangy at first. Again with the TANG! But you get used to it. Your taste buds kind of have to.The corn bread is not sweet at all and lacks any kind of flavor all around.

"We arrived here on a Saturday and at 4:20pm I approached the host stand and asked if it was ok to sit outside. The host took me out to a table my boyfriend had sat at and she saw menus were already at the table and nicely said ""your server will be with you shortly"". It promptly went downhill from there.My boyfriend & I looked over the menu, made our choices and then started to futz around on our phones, looking up things to do after BBQ. At 4:42 he looked at me and said ""We've been sitting here now for over 20 minutes"". So he went to the host stand & the host apologized saying it was shift change and that someone would be with us shortly.  Yet, still no one came for another 10 minutes. We could clearly see servers working outside, just apparently not at our table!Finally our server arrived and I let her know how long we had been waiting and she was pretty ""meh"" about it.We ordered our food and let's just say with Fletcher's Brooklyn Barbecue and Hometown Bar-B-Que not too far away and even Hill Country Barbecue Market downtown, Dinosaur is open and in business because they are cheap. Their food is pretty mediocre compared to the pros doing it at the 3 spots I mentioned and while they all offer a different style of service, if you are going to have table service then maybe you should pay attention to your tables.Mind you, I am not some whiney, out of touch complainer. I work in Food & Beverage and have been for 26 years. There was not an ounce of professionalism or a speck of remorse by anyone there other than the host. The clincher came as we were leaving; this snotty ""kid"" who is an employee there came and sat 2 tables away and in a whiney voice said ""I've been waiting here 20 minutes and no one has come to my table"". I wanted to tell him it was more like 35 minutes, get your f*cken facts straight but I have no time for small minds like that. What I do have time for is a lengthy review and a promise to never visit this place again or recommend it to anyone I know.You just lost a 20% tipping BBQ loving Brooklyn couple to your competition but I'm not sad about it all. Lesson learned.",1.0
"4.5 stars...Between Dino BBQ and Might Quinns I've completely forgotten my plans to travel down south for BBQ. NYC is where it's at, no joke. Dinosaur BBQ was the go-to spot for BBQ where I went to school in Rochester (their second location after Syracuse). After much success branching out to Harlem they've really starting to open locations all over the place, it's sort of like Shake Shack in that way. Gowanus is the latest in openings. If you've ever been to a Dino BBQ spot, they are incredibly consistent in their style, layout, and menu options. It's a rustic combination of a garage, a barn, and a honky tonk; most of all it's just a great BBQ restaurant. Depending on when you come it can be overwhelmingly busy or laid back. They also ocassionally have live music. Like any good BBQ joint you can get meats by the pound but your best bet is to get one of their combo platters with a couple sides. The best deal in my opinion is $17 for a choice of two meats with two sides and cornbread. I always go for ribs (3-4) and pulled pork. Both are cooked to perfection, have a good smoke flavor, and don't come with sauce on top. You choose from the three options at the table if you'd like to add sauce. The pulled pork is good with a little but the ribs certainly don't need anything. The sides I opted for were the beans and chili. The chili didn't blow me away and it was hard to eat off a plate with a shallow section, it was still decent and had a kick to it. I've also tried their mac and cheese in the past and they make a great one. Food aside their drink list (especially beer) is huge. I wouldn't mind the prices being a tad lower but otherwise I'm impressed with the thought they put into it. If you're thinking about coming here during dinner time, especially on a Thursday-Saturday I would recommend calling at least a few days in advance for a reservation, spots to fill up quickly.",4.0
"Soooo much better than waiting in Harlem for hours : ) gotta love Brooklyn!Ordered the 1/2 rack with Mac and cheese and the black eyed peas.  Proud to say I was a fat girl and finished everything but one rib.  The Mac and cheese was great, had spice and just the right amount of creamy cheese.  The portion was really good for under $20.I will most certainly be frequenting Dino more!",4.0
"This is hands down the BEST bbq place in NY (in my opinion).  The food taste just as good (not better but same quality) as the food I've tried in Kansas City and Texas!  Other BBQ places that I've tried-  Blue Smoke (NY)-  Hill Country (NY)-  Franklin BBQ (Austin, TX)-  Many places that I forgot (Kansas City, MS)-  One smoke house (Dallas, TX)(you get the gist, I've tried enough BBQ in various cities)Likes-  The ribs are finger licking deliciousDislike-  Sometimes there's a wait-  Wish there is a location in lower Manhattan",5.0
You don't have to even ask me twice if I want Dinosaur BBQ because the answer will be yes! Ive always loved Dino BBQ. The staff is friendly and the service is quick. Only this time I noticed that the food was not as on point as it used to be. Some things were a hit and some things were a miss. The chicken wings are amazing!!! The deviled eggs and the ribs were good as well but I was not too crazy about my main course. I ordered 2 pork sliders with a side of mac n' cheese and the Harlem potato salad. I really hate to say that I was disappointed because I really do like this place but its the truth. The pork was pretty bland the mac n' cheese was not very cheesy and the potato salad was not good either. Im not quiet sure where things went wrong here but the food has decreased in flavor. I cant say that I'll be running back here but I will still be rooting for Dino BBQ hope they can change things back to the way they used to be!,3.0
"Came in with a group of 6 and sat at the bar while we waited for our table. The inside is made to look like a barn but it's nothing original considering so many restaurants use this cliche kitschy old antiques hanging on the walls concept. I ordered the ""pick two"" option and chose brisket and ribs. The ribs were great! Fall-off-the-bone type. The brisket was rather disappointing as it was way too fatty. Also ordered a side of the collard greens which were very good along with the mac and cheese which was tasty but not mind blowing. Just loaded with heavy cream.  Mid-way through my meal, I ordered the jalapeno cucumber margarita which tasted like it was missing the jalapeno component. Plus, it was overly sweet to the point where I had to add water to it. It was decent but I wouldn't return.",2.0
"I had a very good time at Dinosaur BBQ. The fried green tomatoes were excellent as an appetizer, the wings were delicious and the deviled eggs were good. The ribs were wonderful and the peel and eat shrimp was great although I was surprised they served them cold. My criticism comes in at the sausage links that I could have done without and the ladies restroom I was not prepared for graffiti on the wall. Although I imagine some was purposefully done there was plenty that was not based off of the profanity used. I think they should expand their drink menu. The server could have been more attentive I looked for her more than I would have liked but overall I enjoyed the experience and would go again.",3.0

It's kind of a shame they made a chain out of this place.

The Brooklyn one is a lot more suburban whitebread..but truthfully the Syracuse one is becoming a tourist trap parody at the dining room.The main reason you should be here is for the food...and nothings lost here.,4.0

"1 point for convenience (we were staying right across the street) and 1 point for the food. It certainly wasn't the best BBQ I've ever had, but in a pinch, I needed some food.Saturday night was WILDLY busy, walked in and sat for 45 minutes waiting for take out. The ribs themselves were less fall-off-the-bone and more eat-like-a-caveman-eats-wooly-mammoth style.

I know they have a cult following, just not sure I'll be joining said cult.",2.0
"To be perfectly honest my experience here was more of a SOLID 4.5 stars. But alas Yelp doesn't do halfsies on stars yet (get on that Yelp!!) and I have decided that I want to live here and eat their brisket and chocolate icebox pie forever and ever...So last night me 6 of my favorite people and myself got together to do dinner here and catch up with one another over BBQ and beers. We made reservations for 6:30pm but ended up all arriving around 6:45pm - Dinosaur BBQ didn't miss a beat and they seated us promptly as soon as our entire party was assembled.Upon laying eyes on their menu I knew this was going to be hard. I wanted 4 of everything. I eventually settled on one of their specialty sandwiches - the Chopped Melt which is brisket with sauteed onions & peppers and melted cheddar. I asked for no peppers and certainly no onions, because onions are ICK.Because I was super, duper hungry I made it a platter with 2 sides instead of one. Yeah I know, fatass status...well when in Texas, err, I mean Brooklyn. The sides of my choosing were their mac and cheese and their BBQ fried rice.My brisket sandwich came on a lightly warmed Portuguese roll with lightly spread mayo. The brisket was perfectly seasoned, smoked, juicy, delicious and generally brisket-gasm inducing. I mean I'm pretty sure I made some variation of an ""O"" face with each bite, right up to the point where I turned to my friend Anna and said - ""I saw God in this sandwich, I get things now"". I seriously had a brisket-epiphany.Their mac and cheese was also delicious, a bit crispy on top (just how I like it) and with delicious old-bay type seasonings sprinkled liberally on top. Not too cheesy, but just right and I was pleasantly surprised because sometimes BBQ places miss the boat on mac n' cheese. Dinosaur BBQ DOES NOT.But not all was roses and butterflies - this is the reason why I strongly feel this was a 4.5 and not 5 stars experience - remember how up there I mentioned having said NO ONIONS in my brisket cheddar melt sandwich? Well my BBQ fried rice DID and I don't expect anyone to pick em' out since I bet servings are not made to order and spooned on from a giant, pre-made vat of rice - I do wish our awesome waiter (seriously, he was FANTASTIC!), Terell, would have communicated this to me - I then would have gone for a second side of mac, tried their delicious looking mashed potatoes with gravy OR stuck with 1 side instead...my dislike for onions aside, what if I was allergic? Even if he didn't KNOW there were onions in the rice, then I blame the restaurant for not adequately training their wait staff to know what ingredients are in what. This is vital - I ended up giving away all my rice and paying for a side that I did not get to enjoy.After we all destroyed our dinner food and inhaled our sides/apps we got two Chocolate Icebox pies to share amongst us. We destroyed it like animal savages looking for treasure in the form of delicious cold chocolate mousse, with vanilla ice cream, whipped cream, oreo cookie pieces on the ""crust"" part and a generous dusting of delicious semi-sweet dark chocolate chips. We all ""O"" faced at this point. It was like no one had ever had pie...but no one (except maybe one person at our table) had ever had this pie and this pie was a triumphant way to cap our dinner.We all then left with foodbabies in our bellies and crazy smiles on our faces. You know how some women are all like, ""Chocolate is better than sex!"" - I've always been like, ""BULLSHIT, you'e clearly just not having good sex!!"", well - Dinosaur BBQ's Chocolate Icebox pie has me rethinking this theory...IT WAS JUST THAT GOOD. Gosh, I think I just got a bit hot and bothered just penning this review and thinking about brisket, mac and CHOCOLATE ICEBOX PIE.Dinosaur BBQ - makes sure your awesome employees know their ingredients and can educate customers on what has what when they indicate they don't like something.People who eat food and like meat and beer - GO EAT HERE. Actually, DON'T GO EAT HERE. I WANT ALL THE BRISKET.BRISSSSSSSSSSSKKKKKKKKEEEEEEEEEEETTTTTTT!!!!",5.0
"Came here for lunch on a Sunday and there was no wait for a table. The location is located in an area where there is not much going on, it's in an industrial looking part of Gowanus near the canal. You can actually smell the BBQ aroma from a couple of blocks away. I didn't have it in me to tackle an entire rack of ribs this outing so my review will center on the Pick 3 Combo.First I'd like to say Dinosaur makes a really good Arnold Palmer. Other places don't get the ratio right and the drink is either too lemony or just flavorless. I ended up ordering two APs. I went with the pulled pork, the brisket and the ribs for my meats and the mac n cheese and mashed potatoes for sides. I liked all 3 of my meat choices but the ribs were the best.  The ribs are very good, juicy, not too peppery and they have a light BBQ sauce finish. The brisket was definitely on the lean side which is fine by me. The brisket was moist and had some smoke to it but adding some sauce made it even better. Lastly, the pulled pork was a nice mound of lean meat with just a few morsels of tasty fat mixed in. The pork arrives barely sauced so you will most likely have to add some extra to it.My sides were a little disappointing though. The mashed potatoes were extremely salty, I wouldn't recommend this as a side. The mac and cheese was also a bit of a let down. The elbow pieces were not creamy and looked dry. They also tasted more like mayo than cheese to me for some reason. Judging from some of the other photos, I'm willing to try the mac again. I also tasted some of the potato salad and it was good, not overly salty. The place seems laid back and is good for large groups or families. I also feel like this is not a place where they would judge a single patron for ordering the full rack of ribs deal meant for 2 people. Right? You guys wouldn't judge right?",4.0

"BBQ enthusiasts of the borough of Brooklyn. If I could offer you just one tip for the future, make a reservation. The long-term benefits of making a reservation have been proved by my recent visit whereas the rest of this review has no basis more reliable than my personal dining experience. I will dispense this review now.If you show up at any reasonable time, there will be a line out the door. I'm sure this will get better as time goes on, but both weekend nights there were crowds of people on the sidewalk waiting to even make a reservation. Luckily, Dinosaur is on Open Table. Sure, my friends and I had to eat at 3:45, but hey, better early than never?As for the food, most of us went with the Tres Niños, which gives you a sample of pulled pork, ribs and BBQ brisket. I actually liked them most in that order. Both the pulled pork and ribs were incredibly tender (ribs fell off the bone, but the pulled pork was spiced better). Wasn't a big fan of the brisket. Definitely had better elsewhere in Brooklyn and it was rather bland. The combo was $16 with two sides and cornbread. I had the mac and cheese (which was good but was a little too rubbery), and the chilli, which was good.In terms of service, they need to work out some kinks - they need to have their servers carry around water pitchers instead of replacing empty water glasses with full water glasses. They also seemed to be a bit confused (we had three different waiters who were confused as to whether or not we were being attended to). Another waiter also spilled a glass of water on my friend. Oops!The bathroom has a cool hand-motion flushing urinal. Made me feel like Darth Vader. There was also already graffiti on the bathroom wall (this was 4 days after opening). Not sure if this is accepted, but seemed kind of crass.Anyway, Dino BBQ is a great addition to the neighborhood. I just feel bad for Fort Reno and Fletcher's.

"Go for the BBQ. Seems pretty obvious, but don't be tempted by the interesting sounding side dishes, such as the mini wedge salad or the broccoli carrot salad. The wedge was just that...a wedge of iceberg lettuce with a few cherry tomatoes. That's it. The broccoli carrot thing was also underwhelming. Service was pretty disappointing as well. We were sat by the host outside and sat and sat until I went in to remind them we needed service. When our waitress finally came I asked about the side of the day. She actually said ""it's a smoked pasta with stuff and some vegetables"". I couldn't help but laugh. What was FANTASTIC was the pulled chicken sandwich. Oh my gosh- that chicken was so good! And the grilled peppers and onions that came with it were perfect. Couldn't have been happier with my sandwich ""and stuff"".",3.0
"Don't go without a reservation!I loved the people I was with so much it made the night worth it.  I felt the food was very good, just not good enough for a 2 hour wait.  I found the food was plenty, the drinks were tasty and strong, and the ""BBQ fried rice"" was a suprising delight.   I found the decor of the restaurant itself charming and the staff superb.  But going on a Saturday night with a larger group and no reservation was a mistake.  I would definetly return, as long as there was a reservation.",4.0
It's kind of a shame they made a chain out of this place. Not that the food suffers...but it just waters down the Syracuse mothership (the best one by far...mixed crowd from lawyers to bikers drinking together). The Brooklyn spot sits right near the Gowanus...which might freak people out but consider the Troy NY one sits on the Hudson (the water might sport three eyed carp there)... The Brooklyn one is a lot more suburban whitebread..but truthfully the Syracuse one is becoming a tourist trap parody at the dining room.The main reason you should be here is for the food...and nothings lost here.,4.0

"1 point for convenience (we were staying right across the street) and 1 point for the food. It certainly wasn't the best BBQ I've ever had, but in a pinch, I needed some food.Saturday night was WILDLY busy, walked in and sat for 45 minutes waiting for take out. The ribs themselves were less fall-off-the-bone and more eat-like-a-caveman-eats-wooly-mammoth style. My sides of fried rice and beans were good, and my husband's salad and mac and cheese looked tasty. The overall experience wasn't great but maybe that was based on the circumstances. I know they have a cult following, just not sure I'll be joining said cult.",2.0
"To be perfectly honest my experience here was more of a SOLID 4.5 stars. But alas Yelp doesn't do halfsies on stars yet (get on that Yelp!!) and I have decided that I want to live here and eat their brisket and chocolate icebox pie forever and ever...So last night me 6 of my favorite people and myself got together to do dinner here and catch up with one another over BBQ and beers. We made reservations for 6:30pm but ended up all arriving around 6:45pm - Dinosaur BBQ didn't miss a beat and they seated us promptly as soon as our entire party was assembled.Upon laying eyes on their menu I knew this was going to be hard. I wanted 4 of everything. I eventually settled on one of their specialty sandwiches - the Chopped Melt which is brisket with sauteed onions & peppers and melted cheddar. I asked for no peppers and certainly no onions, because onions are ICK.Because I was super, duper hungry I made it a platter with 2 sides instead of one. Yeah I know, fatass status...well when in Texas, err, I mean Brooklyn. The sides of my choosing were their mac and cheese and their BBQ fried rice.My brisket sandwich came on a lightly warmed Portuguese roll with lightly spread mayo. The brisket was perfectly seasoned, smoked, juicy, delicious and generally brisket-gasm inducing. I mean I'm pretty sure I made some variation of an ""O"" face with each bite, right up to the point where I turned to my friend Anna and said - ""I saw God in this sandwich, I get things now"". I seriously had a brisket-epiphany.Their mac and cheese was also delicious, a bit crispy on top (just how I like it) and with delicious old-bay type seasonings sprinkled liberally on top. Not too cheesy, but just right and I was pleasantly surprised because sometimes BBQ places miss the boat on mac n' cheese. Dinosaur BBQ DOES NOT.But not all was roses and butterflies - this is the reason why I strongly feel this was a 4.5 and not 5 stars experience - remember how up there I mentioned having said NO ONIONS in my brisket cheddar melt sandwich? Well my BBQ fried rice DID and I don't expect anyone to pick em' out since I bet servings are not made to order and spooned on from a giant, pre-made vat of rice - I do wish our awesome waiter (seriously, he was FANTASTIC!), Terell, would have communicated this to me - I then would have gone for a second side of mac, tried their delicious looking mashed potatoes with gravy OR stuck with 1 side instead...my dislike for onions aside, what if I was allergic? Even if he didn't KNOW there were onions in the rice, then I blame the restaurant for not adequately training their wait staff to know what ingredients are in what. This is vital - I ended up giving away all my rice and paying for a side that I did not get to enjoy.After we all destroyed our dinner food and inhaled our sides/apps we got two Chocolate Icebox pies to share amongst us. We destroyed it like animal savages looking for treasure in the form of delicious cold chocolate mousse, with vanilla ice cream, whipped cream, oreo cookie pieces on the ""crust"" part and a generous dusting of delicious semi-sweet dark chocolate chips. We all ""O"" faced at this point. It was like no one had ever had pie...but no one (except maybe one person at our table) had ever had this pie and this pie was a triumphant way to cap our dinner.We all then left with foodbabies in our bellies and crazy smiles on our faces. You know how some women are all like, ""Chocolate is better than sex!"" - I've always been like, ""BULLSHIT, you'e clearly just not having good sex!!"", well - Dinosaur BBQ's Chocolate Icebox pie has me rethinking this theory...IT WAS JUST THAT GOOD. Gosh, I think I just got a bit hot and bothered just penning this review and thinking about brisket, mac and CHOCOLATE ICEBOX PIE.Dinosaur BBQ - makes sure your awesome employees know their ingredients and can educate customers on what has what when they indicate they don't like something.People who eat food and like meat and beer - GO EAT HERE. Actually, DON'T GO EAT HERE. I WANT ALL THE BRISKET.BRISSSSSSSSSSSKKKKKKKKEEEEEEEEEEETTTTTTT!!!!",5.0
"Came here for lunch on a Sunday and there was no wait for a table. The location is located in an area where there is not much going on, it's in an industrial looking part of Gowanus near the canal. You can actually smell the BBQ aroma from a couple of blocks away. I didn't have it in me to tackle an entire rack of ribs this outing so my review will center on the Pick 3 Combo.First I'd like to say Dinosaur makes a really good Arnold Palmer. Other places don't get the ratio right and the drink is either too lemony or just flavorless. I ended up ordering two APs. I went with the pulled pork, the brisket and the ribs for my meats and the mac n cheese and mashed potatoes for sides. I liked all 3 of my meat choices but the ribs were the best.  The ribs are very good, juicy, not too peppery and they have a light BBQ sauce finish. The brisket was definitely on the lean side which is fine by me. The brisket was moist and had some smoke to it but adding some sauce made it even better. Lastly, the pulled pork was a nice mound of lean meat with just a few morsels of tasty fat mixed in. The pork arrives barely sauced so you will most likely have to add some extra to it.My sides were a little disappointing though. The mashed potatoes were extremely salty, I wouldn't recommend this as a side. The mac and cheese was also a bit of a let down. The elbow pieces were not creamy and looked dry. They also tasted more like mayo than cheese to me for some reason. Judging from some of the other photos, I'm willing to try the mac again. I also tasted some of the potato salad and it was good, not overly salty. The place seems laid back and is good for large groups or families. I also feel like this is not a place where they would judge a single patron for ordering the full rack of ribs deal meant for 2 people. Right? You guys wouldn't judge right?",4.0
"Decor: 4/5-About as large as the Harlem location, same wooden decor and feel-Washrooms were fairly cleanService: 2.5/5-Diana C made a reservation for 6 @ 8:30pm. We were seated closer to 8:50pm. -I want to say I'm actually quite disappointed with the service, it was slow and when presented with plates to be taken away, our server ignored us.Food: 3.5/5-Same quality as Harlem location.-My favorite were the devilish eggs and fried green onions. (5/5)-Cornbread tasted a bit undercooked inside (2.5/5)-The pulled pork sliders were slightly bland but adding bbq sauce did the trick (3.5/5)-The peppered wings were okay, not sure what the hype is all about (2.5/5)-Mac n Cheese is on the cheesy side but I like it that way (4/5)-The ribs aren't like the 'fall of the bone' tender but good nonetheless (3.5/5)-Sweet tea is unlimited refills but varied in sweetness consistency-There are no desserts offered, just meat and sides.",3.0
"BBQ enthusiasts of the borough of Brooklyn. If I could offer you just one tip for the future, make a reservation. The long-term benefits of making a reservation have been proved by my recent visit whereas the rest of this review has no basis more reliable than my personal dining experience. I will dispense this review now.If you show up at any reasonable time, there will be a line out the door. I'm sure this will get better as time goes on, but both weekend nights there were crowds of people on the sidewalk waiting to even make a reservation. Luckily, Dinosaur is on Open Table. Sure, my friends and I had to eat at 3:45, but hey, better early than never?As for the food, most of us went with the Tres Niños, which gives you a sample of pulled pork, ribs and BBQ brisket. I actually liked them most in that order. Both the pulled pork and ribs were incredibly tender (ribs fell off the bone, but the pulled pork was spiced better). Wasn't a big fan of the brisket. Definitely had better elsewhere in Brooklyn and it was rather bland. The combo was $16 with two sides and cornbread. I had the mac and cheese (which was good but was a little too rubbery), and the chilli, which was good.In terms of service, they need to work out some kinks - they need to have their servers carry around water pitchers instead of replacing empty water glasses with full water glasses. They also seemed to be a bit confused (we had three different waiters who were confused as to whether or not we were being attended to). Another waiter also spilled a glass of water on my friend. Oops!The bathroom has a cool hand-motion flushing urinal. Made me feel like Darth Vader. There was also already graffiti on the bathroom wall (this was 4 days after opening). Not sure if this is accepted, but seemed kind of crass.Anyway, Dino BBQ is a great addition to the neighborhood. I just feel bad for Fort Reno and Fletcher's. But hey, if you've been meaning to try those two out, I'm sure there won't be many lines for a month or two ;)",4.0
"Best BBQ in NYC... in fact, the Best BBQ I have ever had period.Some might argue that... everyone has their own opinion on what's considered good BBQ, but you cant argue the fact that Dinosaur BBQ is good.

Yaaaay!We were all excited, we were literally anticipating this night for a few days and couldn't wait. Finally the day and time came, Dinosaur was very punctual with their RSVP and even sent me a text 10 minutes prior to my reservation informing us that our table was ready... and trust me we were ready.The venue has the same feel to the Dinosaur location in Harlem, décor wise, but a bit smaller but still big enough.The waitress and staff were super cool, I recognized a few staff members, its nice to see a local people working there. The waitress quickly handed us menus and took our drink order and had a smile on her face the whole time.We latterly drooled reading the menu lol, so many choices, their menu is similar to their menu at the Harlem location with the exception of a few new items such as Mash Potatoes with Gravy.We ordered their Famous BBQ wings as a starter, which is a must do anytime you visit Dinosaur or its considered a sin, the wings did not disappoint and the flavor and recipe is still deliciously the same as their Harlem location.My table ordered a few Chickens BLT sandwiches and I ordered the 3/4 ribs with a side of mac and cheese and mash... all was yummy!The food, ambience and drinks are similar if not the same as their Harlem location, with the exception of a few new or different menu options, but one thing for certain that remains true and consistent is their delicious Food.Tip: Don't forget to try their Sweet Tea and Fresh Lemonades served in a Jar...

"I've heard of this place and finally tried it. I'm not a huge fan of smoked BBQ foods but i've had some that were really good from Hill Country and also Smoke Joint. But here at Dinosaur BBQ.. I didnt really like my food. I tried the wang tanga flavored wings which were pretty okay, sweet and slightly spicy but didnt feel the wings were marinated well enough becos the meat itself taste plain. I had the brisket since everyone raved abt it in the reviews but i was pretty disappointed when most of it had waaaay too much fat than meat. It was almost like selling a whole plate of fatness. I didnt like the corn bread, honestly Dallas BBQ even had better corn bread. And the sides mac n cheese, fries, chili, collard greens were okay. The food also didnt come out warm enough.. Unsure if it was cos they were busy. They did have a live band but u can only hear them if u sat on the left side of the restaurant and not the further right side. We also didnt understand why they called it Dinosaur BBQ but had no dinosaur designs thru out the restaurant.. Odd. Overall, probably will not come back again since there are many more BBQ places that taste better.",2.0
"It's always a gamble where to take my southern parents when they come to the city, so I was really pleased that my father's only complaint during our meal was the lack of a bottle of Pepper Vinegar sauce on the table (if that's a must for you, be sure to BYOV).

As everyone has said, the Fried Green Tomatoes are the go-to appetizer, perfectly breaded and just the right degree of sour tang.",5.0
"FINALLY! They opened a Dinosaur BBQ outside of Harlem! I'm glad they finally decided to expand their operations because there is so much hype around the one there. The wait in the Harlem restaurant on weekends could be dreadful, so when I heard they opened one in Brooklyn I thanked the BBQ Gods.I love the location in Park Slope, since Park Slope is a very happening area. Although it's located on the quieter side of 4th avenue between 3rd and 4th, but I'm still satisfied that they have one in BK. I came to eat on a Thursday night. We still booked reservations, but I'm not sure if we really needed it. It was crowded, but not to the point where you'd wait more than 20 minutes.I love the spacing and décor of the restaurant. Since the restaurant is new, it's got a clean look to it. It's a fairly big restaurant, with plenty of tables and space between tables. There's a bar to the left of the entrance and straight ahead is the kitchen, where you can smell all of that BBQ goodness. The service was very good too. The waiters were young and very enthusiastic! A good sign when you first sit down.There was a huge selection on their menu to the point where my head was spinning not knowing what to order. We finally settled on the Fancy fried green tomatoes as an appetizer. It came with 5 pieces, fairly average size green tomatoes. It had a spicy pimento cheese sauce on it with peppers. I loved the spicy combination on top of the tomato. It was fried very well and the additional toppings were a really nice touch. On to the main courses! I had the 3 combination plate with the 1/4 white meat chicken, pulled pork and BBQ brisket and 2 sides (Mashed Potatoes with Gravy and Mac & Cheese). The pulled pork was fantastic. Soft, juicy and easy to chew. The same could be said for the brisket. The 1/4 chicken was a bit dry, but the outside was nicely bbq'd. The inside wasn't as moist as the outside. I added some of their hot sauce onto all 3 to give my meal a little kick. The sides were AMAZING though. The mashed potatoes and mac & cheese were some of the best I EVER HAD! They were that good. Move over KFC and Popeye's mashed potatoes! The Mac & Cheese was so warm and cheesy. It was moist so it wasn't all stuck together like some places.I loved the atmosphere here and the food even more here! Can't wait to come back because this was truly one of the best BBQ experiences I had in NYC.",4.0

"Flashback group of 4 sitting at in a quaint diner like restaurant at table in Syracuse, NY. Around are bikers in leather and jeans all chopping down on peel & eat shrimp with a rack of ribs on the side. Fast forward present. Group of 4 sitting in a vast cavernous restaurant with industrial chic feel in Red Hook, Brooklyn. Around are Brooklyn hipster and gentrified urban dwellers with a taste for BBQ.Here it is all about the good ole meat. The ode to the cow, pig and bird.  The crispy Green fried tomatoes was not oily the cheese added a nice saltiness. The dipping sauce had a slight heat. The brisket plate with sides of coleslaw and baked beans topped with pickled jalapenos. The meat was moist and tender. The coleslaw cool and tangy not overly mayonnaise.  The baked beans was a bit thicker than I like but still flavorful. The ¾ rack pork rib was melt off the bone and full of flavors. The jarred sauces on the table complements the meat but not necessary.This is probably some of the best BBQ we've had and what makes it great is that it is the prices are reasonable for all to enjoy unlike some other expensive joints and don't have to sacrifice going to the bottom of the well BBQ chain.",4.0
Dino Bbq delivers again. Wings were good! ServiceWas amazing--Thanks Josh (Julio)--and beers were cold. Seriously--we eat out quite often and Josh (Julio) is a fabulous server! Manger Josh stopped by table and was great to talk with as well. Service continues to match the food--great all around. I'm a southern girl--fromNC--and know Bbq. This isn't traditional NC vinegar based bbq--but it's quite good and a place I've been too at least 4 times in one year and even visited the one in Syracuse.  Whatever their model is works...keep it and we will keep coming back! Great for bringing the kids or meeting friends for food and/or drinks.,4.0
"Subpar food. Ribs were ok, brisket was dry and the sides lacked seasoning. I'm adding an extra star for the fried green tomatoes because they were off the hook!",3.0
"I was so excited when Dinosaur opened in this area, and I'm so glad that it doesn't disappoint! The food is always consistently good, and the service is fantastic. The servers there do a great job of making you feel welcomed.  And That brisket is what's up!",4.0
My boyfriend and I went to the bbq joint last night. I have to say the bbq is AWESOME.  The sides are not. If you decide to go do not sit by the bar it is very loud and crowded. We will definitely go back for the bbq. The chicken wings and ribs were Dino-myte!!! Enjoy.,4.0
"Loved the place! Went there on a Friday night. The place was crowded but we had a reservation so the table for two was waiting for us. Staff is very friendly and considerate. The reason we went to check out this place was mainly hot wings which were rated as one of the best wings in NYC by Times Out magazine. As a huge wings fans we had to try it out. And....we were not disappointed! Those wings are one of the best I got to try! We ordered Hot and Devils Duel, which was pretty painful to eat but that was sweet pain. They also have a great selection of beers. Will be definitely coming back again and again for more wings and beer!",5.0
"I've heard of this place and finally tried it. I'm not a huge fan of smoked BBQ foods but i've had some that were really good from Hill Country and also Smoke Joint. But here at Dinosaur BBQ.. I didnt really like my food. I tried the wang tanga flavored wings which were pretty okay, sweet and slightly spicy but didnt feel the wings were marinated well enough becos the meat itself taste plain. I had the brisket since everyone raved abt it in the reviews but i was pretty disappointed when most of it had waaaay too much fat than meat. It was almost like selling a whole plate of fatness. I didnt like the corn bread, honestly Dallas BBQ even had better corn bread. And the sides mac n cheese, fries, chili, collard greens were okay. The food also didnt come out warm enough.. Unsure if it was cos they were busy. They did have a live band but u can only hear them if u sat on the left side of the restaurant and not the further right side. We also didnt understand why they called it Dinosaur BBQ but had no dinosaur designs thru out the restaurant.. Odd. Overall, probably will not come back again since there are many more BBQ places that taste better.",2.0
"It's always a gamble where to take my southern parents when they come to the city, so I was really pleased that my father's only complaint during our meal was the lack of a bottle of Pepper Vinegar sauce on the table (if that's a must for you, be sure to BYOV). The Tres Niños was a hit along with a side of collards that ""had as much flavor"" as any my dad could remember. As everyone has said, the Fried Green Tomatoes are the go-to appetizer, perfectly breaded and just the right degree of sour tang.",5.0
"FINALLY! They opened a Dinosaur BBQ outside of Harlem! I'm glad they finally decided to expand their operations because there is so much hype around the one there. The wait in the Harlem restaurant on weekends could be dreadful, so when I heard they opened one in Brooklyn I thanked the BBQ Gods.I love the location in Park Slope, since Park Slope is a very happening area. Although it's located on the quieter side of 4th avenue between 3rd and 4th, but I'm still satisfied that they have one in BK. I came to eat on a Thursday night. We still booked reservations, but I'm not sure if we really needed it. It was crowded, but not to the point where you'd wait more than 20 minutes.I love the spacing and décor of the restaurant. Since the restaurant is new, it's got a clean look to it. It's a fairly big restaurant, with plenty of tables and space between tables. There's a bar to the left of the entrance and straight ahead is the kitchen, where you can smell all of that BBQ goodness. The service was very good too. The waiters were young and very enthusiastic! A good sign when you first sit down.There was a huge selection on their menu to the point where my head was spinning not knowing what to order. We finally settled on the Fancy fried green tomatoes as an appetizer. It came with 5 pieces, fairly average size green tomatoes. It had a spicy pimento cheese sauce on it with peppers. I loved the spicy combination on top of the tomato. It was fried very well and the additional toppings were a really nice touch. On to the main courses! I had the 3 combination plate with the 1/4 white meat chicken, pulled pork and BBQ brisket and 2 sides (Mashed Potatoes with Gravy and Mac & Cheese). The pulled pork was fantastic. Soft, juicy and easy to chew. The same could be said for the brisket. The 1/4 chicken was a bit dry, but the outside was nicely bbq'd. The inside wasn't as moist as the outside. I added some of their hot sauce onto all 3 to give my meal a little kick. The sides were AMAZING though. The mashed potatoes and mac & cheese were some of the best I EVER HAD! They were that good. Move over KFC and Popeye's mashed potatoes! The Mac & Cheese was so warm and cheesy. It was moist so it wasn't all stuck together like some places.I loved the atmosphere here and the food even more here! Can't wait to come back because this was truly one of the best BBQ experiences I had in NYC.",4.0

"Flashback group of 4 sitting at in a quaint diner like restaurant at table in Syracuse, NY. Around are bikers in leather and jeans all chopping down on peel & eat shrimp with a rack of ribs on the side. Fast forward present. Group of 4 sitting in a vast cavernous restaurant with industrial chic feel in Red Hook, Brooklyn. Around are Brooklyn hipster and gentrified urban dwellers with a taste for BBQ.Here it is all about the good ole meat. The ode to the cow, pig and bird.  The crispy Green fried tomatoes was not oily the cheese added a nice saltiness. The dipping sauce had a slight heat. The brisket plate with sides of coleslaw and baked beans topped with pickled jalapenos. The meat was moist and tender. The coleslaw cool and tangy not overly mayonnaise.  The baked beans was a bit thicker than I like but still flavorful. The ¾ rack pork rib was melt off the bone and full of flavors.

"So here we go with another Dinosaur review. I believe in honesty in reviews, and tho my first review wasn't that good, I felt compelled to write a review of the Brooklyn location.We had such a great time I wish I didn't have to leave. As you can tell by every review I have wrote, I LOVE THE DEVILED EGGS!!!! I ate a dozen myself (I was there with three other people).This time I also had the TRES NINOS and the Mac and Cheese and chicken wings, as per my incredibly knowledgeable waiters recommendation. The people I was with debated how hot to get the wings, so I ordered them naked, with various sauces on the side. They ended up being so good, I didn't even use any sauce on mine. They rate as some of the BEST wings I have ever had!!The Tres Ninos was just a plate of deliciousness. Each item on the plate was better then the item before it. Coupled with the mac and cheese, it was the epitome of comfort food.The ambiance and atmosphere here is great. Great music in the back ground. Loud enough to enjoy, quiet enough to engage in conversation without yelling.The wait staff checks periodically to make sure all is well, and brings all food and drinks in a timely matter.Joe runs a tight ship, and really cares about each customers experience.15 Minutes from my hotel in Manhattan, I would recommend this place to anyone staying in the Financial district in Manhattan.We had many choices of where to go, including a BBQ place across form the Conrad Hotel. Glad we made the right decision.Oh, LOL, did I mention they make the best deviled eggs!!!!",5.0
"fourth of july, what better way to celebrate than with bbq?  apparently, many ppl share similar thoughts too.  we left our name and phone number was told there would be about an hour wait, the wait seemed shorter and we were seated about 45 minutes later.  we ordered the honey bbq wings to start, so juicy and tender, very good.  then we both got the tres ninos plate, consisted of pulled pork (juicy), bbq ribs (flavorful but definitely not fall-off-the-bone), and brisket.  the brisket was a bit off, i got the end pieces and they were tough and very very salty.  the bf got the middle section, it was very moist and tender.  for the sides, we got the potato salad (creamy and flavorful, excellent), baked beans (tasty!), bbq fried rice (smokey, bf liked it, i thought it was ok), and the mac & cheese (excellent!).  the corn breads were great too.  to wash everything down, we had sweet tea (great, southern style sweet tea!) and lemonade (awesome!).  the portions were very generous and i had enough for two meals.  yum!overall, we had a great experience at Dino's and will be back for sure!",4.0
"This review is based on two experiences I have had at Dinosaur BBQ. Hands down, one of the best BBQ restaurants that I have been to.Dinosaur BBQ has been the ""talk"" the past two months at work and from my boyfriend. My boyfriend and I have been here twice this month, once was just ourselves and once with one of our good friends.There's indoor and outdoor seating and a large bar area. Very cozy and great for family dinner or just dinner with friends. Staff is very friendly. It's crazy here on the weekends and Friday nights. You can leave your name and number with the host and they will call you when your table is ready.First experience was great. Our waitress Monique gave us a warm welcome and was ready to answer any questions we had. During our first experience, my boyfriend and I did the 'Pick Your Own Combo' with Any 2 Sides. I had the BBQ Brisket and Pulled Pork with French Fries & Turkey Neck Greens (Collard Greens on the sauce). The BBQ brisket comes with a few slices of Jalapenos and a nice portion of Dinosaur BBQ's sauce sitting on top. The brisket was the best sliced brisket I have ever had. Perfectly sliced, moist, and just fantastic. The pulled pork was moist and tender. Fries were excellent and as for the Turkey Neck Greens - I wasn't a fan of it.My boyfriend had the St. Louis Ribs and 1/4 Chicken with Mac & Cheese and BBQ Fried RIce on the side. The St. Louis Ribs were delicious! The meat just comes right off the bone and it's so moist. I am a big fan of their ribs. The chicken was alright. Mac & Cheese is a little spicy, but it's just the right amount of cheese. BBQ Fried Rice - didn't try it.  We also had their House made Sweet Tea. I think it's truly adorable that their sweet tea is served in mason jars and it's free refills too. Our second experience was with good friend Jack. There were suppose to be more friends joining us, but they weren't available. Our waiter was named Dominick and very cool and down-to-earth guy. We went a little crazy this time and did the Family Style BBQ which contained (1 Whole Chicken *6 Pieces*, 1 Whole Rack of Ribs, 1/2 pound of pulled pork and 1/2 pound of BBQ brisket, 3 side dishes, and Honey Hush Cornbread). Yeah, it was a lot of food.The chicken was roasted just right, moist and tender. The ribs were definitely the best out of all the meats we had, like I have said - it just comes right off the bone and is packed with deliciousness. Brisket and Pulled Pork was good. Four our 3 sides we had: Chili, French Fries, and Mac & Cheese. Our friend wanted chili and it was scrumptious. Packed with flavor and absolute comfort food!Both experiences were great! I felt very welcomed and enjoyed the food. This is definitely a great restaurant to check out and if you're craving for Southern Comfort food.",5.0
"Well, when I first went to Dino BBQ I had some trouble. I had to return a burger twice. Once when I asked for no sauce they put some on and when I asked them to make a new one they returned two minutes later. The bun was torn up and it was explicit that they just wiped of the sauce. The next time I went I enjoyed the food. The restaurant is quite loud and you might have to wait an hour to be seated.",4.0
"I saw God in my brisket sandwich.The above sentence is honestly all I want to write for this review. Dinosaur BBQ is incredible and is a delicious Brooklyn gem! That may seem like I'm going too far but only until I try another BBQ place in Brooklyn may I change this! Any who - I digress.A few weeks ago, a few friends and I chose this place to play catch up. Our reservations were for 6:30 but our group didn't show up at the same time. No matter. Dinosaur graciously waited for the rest of our party (well, just Stephy P.) and sat us down about 15 - 20 minutes later.The place was huge and I loved the little outdoor seating area where patrons could either wait or eat outside the restaurant. It was a rustic feel with glass bottles hanging from the ceiling and large photographs. Our table was just behind the kitchen where we could see the magic happen. Tables were all close by making this large space quiet cozy but not uncomfortable! In fact, a seventh person, a friend of a friend who never confirmed via FB if they were coming, joined us at our table and Dinosaur accommodated our impromptu guest with a seat almost as if they were expecting him.  I liked this since the place was already incredibly crowded. Probably good to mention that you're better off making reservations or coming early to eat!Our awesome waiter, Terell, took our orders and came back with what should have been some sort of dramatic, victorious kind of background music you hear in the movies because the food that we were about to consume was that glorious!!! *Record scratch* Well, the sampler plate wasn't that amazing and frankly they should take it off the menu. Plus I only got two tiny pieces of pickles on my plate. Sup with that?Right. Well, my dish was food-gasmic as I had ordered a specialty brisket sandwich. It had the perfect amount of everything on it! I literally took one bite and let out an audible ""OHHHHHH.."" (Let the record show my iPhone changed ohhh to OHHHHHH but actually, that's accurate too). That brisket changed my life. I ordered a side of Mac n Cheese which was meh but got a bit gooey towards the bottom which I love. To top it off, we all shared icebox chocolate cake and it was to die for. My taste buds were so happy that if that was the last meal they would ever experience they would be okay with that.I can't wait to come back!",4.0

I made a reservation in advance and the table was immediately available at arrival.",3.0
The food was not worth the hour wait. I was disappointed at the pictures because they seriously deceived me. The fried green tomatoes were the best and the sesame chicken wings on the appetizers were good also. As for our entrées neither of us were impressed. The fries were good. The greens tasted frozen we even added the garlic chipotle pepper sauce for flavor. The chicken was juicy. The ribs were fatty and I tried to add BBQ sauce but the sauce wasn't good. The Mac n Cheese was flavorless not southern home cooking. The mashed potatoes were also flavorless. This place is great diabetics because there is no flavor. Needless to say I'd only come back for appetizers.,2.0
"Never been here before and we enjoyed it very much. Did lunch around 1pm. The restaurant was fairly empty which surprised us. Big refurbished warehouse with lots of seating. Out waitress was friendly and sweet. I ordered the peel and eat shrimp which were delicious. Hubby had the chicken wings which were big and juicy.  For our main courses he had ribs which we're coming right off the bone. I had a sampler plate of pork brisket and ribs. Everything was great. I also had for my side dishes am and cheese and pork and beans. The beans were probably the best I've ever had. The only thing we didn't enjoy was the cornbread which was pretty tasteless but in the big scheme of things, no big deal. We'll be back and we'll be bringing friends.",5.0

Not cheap but consistently on point. Plenty of options and combos make you feel like you're getting everything you crave. They also have their own bottle of barbecue sauce for sale... And it's good!

I came here a few times and each time was very good. Always left with a full stomach. The wings aren't like traditional style but worth the try. Smokey flavor and different texture when off the grill. I have tried the ribs but I don't know if it was made with wet rubs or dry rubs but still good. I haven't tried other items on menu but look forward to doing so one day. Haven't been there when they had music which would like to experience.Maybe there are better places but if so someone send me a message cause we are all foodies.,3.0
"My friend recommended me this restaurant, saying its a pretty famous one in Syracuse and they have a large portion of food that's served. Have to admit the food is really abundant.

The mac & cheese was boring. The French fries were fried too hard. The collard greens clearly were not individually soaked, rolled and freshly cut - these suckers came straight out of a can.  But the mashed potatoes were good. My buddy didn't share his chicken with me... Lol. So I cannot comment on that. We did split the Fried Green Tomato appetizer and that was okay. Overall, the food is ""okay"". I'm glad I experienced it, but of the many other BBQ options in the city this place doesn't stand out (in my opinion). However, the prices are fair. It is a good value. I made a reservation in advance and the table was immediately available at arrival.",3.0
The food was not worth the hour wait. I was disappointed at the pictures because they seriously deceived me. The fried green tomatoes were the best and the sesame chicken wings on the appetizers were good also. As for our entrées neither of us were impressed. The fries were good. The greens tasted frozen we even added the garlic chipotle pepper sauce for flavor. The chicken was juicy. The ribs were fatty and I tried to add BBQ sauce but the sauce wasn't good. The Mac n Cheese was flavorless not southern home cooking. The mashed potatoes were also flavorless. This place is great diabetics because there is no flavor. Needless to say I'd only come back for appetizers.,2.0
"Never been here before and we enjoyed it very much. Did lunch around 1pm. The restaurant was fairly empty which surprised us. Big refurbished warehouse with lots of seating. Out waitress was friendly and sweet. I ordered the peel and eat shrimp which were delicious. Hubby had the chicken wings which were big and juicy.  For our main courses he had ribs which we're coming right off the bone. I had a sampler plate of pork brisket and ribs. Everything was great. I also had for my side dishes am and cheese and pork and beans. The beans were probably the best I've ever had. The only thing we didn't enjoy was the cornbread which was pretty tasteless but in the big scheme of things, no big deal. We'll be back and we'll be bringing friends.",5.0

"Decent place. Good environment to hang out as a group or couple. Food is ok, drinks are better. If the food was better the long wait would be worth it.",3.0
Not cheap but consistently on point. Plenty of options and combos make you feel like you're getting everything you crave. They also have their own bottle of barbecue sauce for sale... And it's good! They get a lot of traffic so there may be a wait but it is a comfortable atmosphere and service is friendly. Also good for take out.,4.0
"I gotta give this place 5 stars today,food was on point, the server Kenya was great,def will visit again.",5.0
I came here a few times and each time was very good. Always left with a full stomach. The wings aren't like traditional style but worth the try. Smokey flavor and different texture when off the grill. I have tried the ribs but I don't know if it was made with wet rubs or dry rubs but still good. I haven't tried other items on menu but look forward to doing so one day. Haven't been there when they had music which would like to experience.Maybe there are better places but if so someone send me a message cause we are all foodies.,3.0
"My friend recommended me this restaurant, saying its a pretty famous one in Syracuse and they have a large portion of food that's served. Have to admit the food is really abundant. However the taste of the food is really just so so. Not very impressed. Meat lovers can choose the family size one, it will definitely feed you full.",3.0
"Great BBQ spot that's lived up to the hype. Awesome atmosphere, solid deviled eggs and the ribs and chicken were what I expected. Sides are a good portions-good place to share with other people. Heard there is some live music and will have to come back to check it out. Get there!",4.0
"This place is a disgrace to BBQ. Do not come here. If you want good BBQ go to TEXAS. This does not even compare to what you get there. I was so disappointed, I want to cry about the calories that weren't worth it. Service wasn't that bad, but still DO NOT COME HERE, you will be sad.",1.0
"As all the others who have reviewed this place, it is the best BBQ place in NYC. At least that I've tried. This location is great, they managed to get everything right, yet again.The food is excellent. Really like it, and will be sad when I leave NYC.-Ribs are fantastic-Pulled pork has the consistency of mashed tuna fish, it's soft and delicious-Brisket is great, soft and tender-Mac and cheese is rich and super creamy-Black-eyed pea's were perfect-Mashed potatoes... just okayMy only real complaints were the service, and the coleslaw. When eating greasy meat, you want vinegar to cut through and balance out the fat, however this was very thick and creamy, almost like eating a jar of may with cabbage chunks in it.As for the service, maybe we just got unlucky. During lunch in a nearly empty restaurant, you'd expect fast service, but it was excruciatingly slow. Food was really fast, so this is only specific to our server. She was awful.",5.0
"I thought this location was just OK as compared to the others I have been to. I mean, slabs of meat and delish BBQ always is a joy, but you have to wow me nowdays since I have had so much of it all around.Dropped in here with some friends after a recent Yelp event. Place was empty on a weeknight so we had no problem getting a table. Plenty of seating in a rustic woodsy and brick wall BBQ setting as the decor is with this chain. Basically the same menu as the others and I ordered a combo platter called the Tres Ninos which is a good deal at $15.95.Solid ribs as always, pulled pork was ok and nothing major, and the brisket was just too dry and flavorless. Yet, the sides rock. Mac & Cheese and potato salad have a spicy seasoning on them - so good! Love the cornbread. A cold Kelso pilsner helped wash it all down. Service was attentive enough but kind of disappeared at times when we needed something such as an extra knife or another drink.Overall, it's ok if looking for a BBQ fix and you live close by, or in the area catching a game at the Barclays, or playing shuffleboard a few doors down at Royal Palms.",3.0
"No delivery after 5PM? Zero stars. As for the food, the only decent item on the menu are the ribs. The sides are awful, and the rest is just ok. Dinos is good for the occasional takeout, but since they don't even do that in the evening, they're pretty much useless.",2.0

My 10 yr old and I tried this for the first time and really enjoyed it.

"So much more spacious and no long wait at all compared to its original location in Harlem. So.. Is this one of my top barbecue restaurants on the list? Definately not. It's great for groups with a good price. The jumbo chicken wings & ribs are delicious, their barbecue meats are generally pretty good but nothing for me to write home about to be honest. I've been here plenty of times too; Inconsistency - briskets are usually reallyyy moist and juicy here besides the other night when I came.. It was mehhh. Sides? - Collard greens were a no-go... Mac&cheese, basic and simple. Nothing great & different stood out from it than any other place with mac&cheeses. My bf kept drowning my pulled pork with sauces because he felt it was dry and bland... I didn't have a single problem about my pulled pork though. It wasn't dry to me but yet not super juicy nor moist, good flavor there to me as well... I've had way worse pulled porks before. I like dinosaur, just don't love it like some of my other barbecue joints...

"We stopped in at this spot on a stroll through Brooklyn. Seating took a little while, but it was fairly busy. The BBQ was worth the wait though. It's classic style BBQ that definitely play homage to traditional BBQ in the south. Through an inside source, I heard that the person who started the restaurant studied southern BBQ before opening his first spot. I had the pork plate, and the meat came out smokey and flavorful. The sides we had were really good too. Their original bbq sauce is one of the best I've tried in a long time. Classic taste. Even though the kitchen was a little slow, I thought it was well worth the wait. Whether you're a local or a tourist looking for a good place to grab a bite in this part of Brooklyn, I definitely recommend this spot for solid southern style barbecue.",4.0

We enjoed all the sides, but loves the fried rice most of all! Trust. Take two of those. I also went for the cucumber and tomato salad, which was a crisp and refreshing contrast to all the sticky saucy stuff I was enjoying. Only one bbq sauce/house sauce but you can pair it with their garlic pepper sauce. Sauce was a 3/5 for me but the ribs they were on were definitely QUALITY.  Wished that the fried green tomatoes were cut a bit thicker but we had an overall great experience. Come a bit earlier than dinner rush to get the best service. The servers are cordial and try their best to be promt but this place gets busy!",4.0

I went with a bunch of girls and we all tried different combination of the meat platters and sides. Everything was delicious. I personally had the pulled pork and bbq chicken with the mac & cheese and coleslaw. It was one of the best mac & cheeses I've ever had. My friends tried the sausage, ribs, and other sides, no complaints with anything. The only downside was that we were seated at a high top table in the bar and it got very crowded.

I've also been to the Harlem location a couple years back and it was equally good.",5.0
"Came here with my boyfriend on a Friday night around 8. We were seated after somewhat of a wait (it was Friday and the food here is good.) and started off with drinks. Those cocktails in the mason jars? Fantastic and they pack a punch. We ordered nachos to start with- they were good. Pretty simple- chili, cheese sauce and jalapeños. I got the tres ninos to sample a bit of everything with collards and slaw. It was all really good. Way better than I was expecting, actually. Will be back again when in need of a BBQ fix.",5.0
"We stopped in at this spot on a stroll through Brooklyn. Seating took a little while, but it was fairly busy. The BBQ was worth the wait though. It's classic style BBQ that definitely play homage to traditional BBQ in the south. Through an inside source, I heard that the person who started the restaurant studied southern BBQ before opening his first spot. I had the pork plate, and the meat came out smokey and flavorful. The sides we had were really good too. Their original bbq sauce is one of the best I've tried in a long time. Classic taste. Even though the kitchen was a little slow, I thought it was well worth the wait. Whether you're a local or a tourist looking for a good place to grab a bite in this part of Brooklyn, I definitely recommend this spot for solid southern style barbecue.",4.0
I food is great for a bbq spot.  The drinks are indeed on point. The wait can be a little unbearable (1 - 2hrs for a table). Its a chill spot to go hang out with friends.,4.0
I absolutely adore this place! So gooood! The pulled pork is out of this world and the atmosphere is great! The waiters are always super friendly and make for a pleasant dining experience,5.0
"I have been to Dino BBQ in CT and really enjoyed it. Was at the one in Brooklyn today and what a difference. The service was terrible. Waitress asked what I wanted as SOON as I sat down. I told her I needed a minute and disappeared for 15. She didn't introduce herself, have any suggestions when  I asked. Never gave me water, never stopped to see if I needed anything etc. Bbq beans were cold. Bathroom was lacking toilet paper, soap and sink/ bathroom door broken. Overall- ghetto. I am mad I wasted $23 on lunch here.",3.0
"Great addition to the neighborhood! Love their food (wings, fried tomatoes, ribs and Mac and cheese are all delicious). Their drinks are great too and most importantly for us is their friendliness to children. Delivery tough takes forever!",4.0
"Four stars for the tender and juicy briskets they served! Our party of three agree that the whole slab of ribs could well enough feed four as it was accompanied by four sides of choice. We enjoed all the sides, but loves the fried rice most of all! Trust. Take two of those. I also went for the cucumber and tomato salad, which was a crisp and refreshing contrast to all the sticky saucy stuff I was enjoying. Only one bbq sauce/house sauce but you can pair it with their garlic pepper sauce. Sauce was a 3/5 for me but the ribs they were on were definitely QUALITY.  Wished that the fried green tomatoes were cut a bit thicker but we had an overall great experience. Come a bit earlier than dinner rush to get the best service. The servers are cordial and try their best to be promt but this place gets busy!",4.0

I went with a bunch of girls and we all tried different combination of the meat platters and sides. Everything was delicious.

"Overrated. Far from the best BBQ I've ever had. It's about $20 per person and you get a very good portion but the actually meat is very mediocre, if they smoked it a little longer maybe I wouldn't have had the same experience.

"Excellent BBQ Food to say the least!  I was extremely impressed with this restuarant.  I got the Honey BBQ Wings for appetizer and BBQ Beef Brisket Sandwich as a main course.  Everything was extremely fresh and tasty.  Seasoned/Sauced to perfection!  Also got a flight of beer (4 different types) for $6!!

"Dino BBQ is probably my absolute favorite place to eat post climbing. Located a mere couple of blocks from Brooklyn Boulders, and on the way to the subway stop, it's become frightfully dangerous. I go here way too often! My first time here, I came with six other friends and we got the family platter. Best. Decision. Of. Our. Lives! It was delicious! And so much food! And it allowed me to sample everything so I know what to choose whenever I come back. Which is mostly the brisket. Although oftentimes a little dry, it's so flavorful and tender it kind of makes up for that.  And their Dino Poutine, there's something about eating gravy and pulled pork covered fries after climbing that just appeals to me so much. The other food is also very tasty, but not truly any different from other good barbeque places. And although I always get their cornbread, since it's quite tasty, it's actually not nearly as moist and delicious as I usually prefer. But since I'm too lazy to make cornbread these days, I can't really complain. And it's still yummy! The place itself is also charming, with vintage posters on their wooden walls, and mason jars holding utensils. The wait is never horrible - usually only 15-12 minutes tops - and it's so spacious. It's never like eating in Manhattan, where sometimes you just feel too cramped. Post climb, this is always where I like to go to get some grub on and just relax.",4.0
"Dinosaur BBQ is an upgraded version of Dallas BBQ that has better food and big portions at acceptable prices. We got the sweetheart special which is a full rack of ribs and four sides (wide variety of sides). The ribs were average but the sides were very good (mac and cheese, potato salad, fries). The restaurant is very spacious and has ample seating so it is an ideal place for large groups. If you do plan to come here with a large group during the weekend, I would definitely recommend reserving a table more than a week in advance.",4.0

"Dinosaur BBQ is what a bbq chain strive to be, when compared to alternatives such as Dallas BBQ it definitely blows it competition out of the water but against other local restaurants there is definitely a lot more room for improvement. So for a starter the excessive wait can go either way, it can essentially turn you into a savage will to eat anything or discourage you and make you leave. I decided to wait it out and after maybe 50 minutes we were seated. Food came relatively fast after being seated. I will honestly say, the pork sliders were the highlight of the meal. The ribs and the four sides that we ordered were decent, but honestly I felt it could've been better in the sense where the meat was more moist. I really disliked the cole slaw and mac and cheese there was just something about the taste that threw me off. But the chili and the beans were decent.Overall, I wasn't amazed by the food nor was it worth the wait. I'll say this though, the food is definitely enjoyable but for a 45 minute wait? I think that there are alternatives, or take it to go because people were coming in and out on that line.",3.0
Best ribs I've ever had! They actually have meat on them! Highly recommend this place,5.0
"Stopped by here today - have been wanting to try Dinosaur. Had St. Louis ribs with sides of Mac and Cheese and Mashed Potatoes. Corn Bread comes with it. Ribs were extremely tasty ... not only had a smoked flavor but you could also taste a charcoal flavor (I'm guessing from being grilled to finish them off) - a wonderful combination. However, breaking the rack apart was not easy and as a result, the meat did not fall off the bone ... leaving some room for more smoke time (I believe). Yet, they were not overly chewy and were still somewhat tender when eaten. Maybe next time they will be a little more tender because often these bbq places are somewhat hit and miss. I must say a word about the ""spicy"" bbq sauce - one the best I have ever had. The cornbread was very ... different. Not overly sweet as many are, but not very ""corny"" as it should be. Still, not bad. The best thing in my experience were the sides. The mac and cheese was excellent - one of the best I've ever had at a bbq place ... where the mac and cheese is usually overly gooey and tastes like it was made with cheesewhip. This was clearly baked, and had a melted cheese crust on top. Also it had a peppery taste. Was very good.The mashed potatoes were also suprisingly good for a side dish at a bbq place. Very tasty. All in all I would go back again. The place has a nice setup in terms of a large bar area where you can hang and have a drink while waiting for a table. And the people that work there are very customer-oriented extremely friendly and want to please - moreso than at many other restaurants I have been to. I was wished a nice day on my way out from no less than 3 different people.",3.0

We ordered the ""pick your own combo"" with the chicken and spicy shrimp with Mac&cheese and mashed potatoes as our sides, as well as the dino poutine and chicken wings.

It was a good eat no doubt! But id have to say after the cray hype it was a little bit of a let down and really expensive for small portion size. Actually portion size was decent.

Cornbread was not too heavy and pretty good! Service was great and the vibe was good too. Just the price was high and just a decently solid food. Stop the hype please.,3.0
"This was my first ever visit to a Dinosaur BBQ. The name refers only to the primitive themed menu since the inside is neither dinosaur nor caveman themed. The decor is set to look old and that's it. I sat at the bar although plenty of tables were available at 2pm on a sunny Saturday. I ordered the Dino Burger patter with a side of fried rice and A.K. chili. As I ate my meal, I listened to the all genre music selections and since British soccer was on, I watched women's tennis. The burger was of the popular thin bun that can't support the weight of whatever is on top style. It was a good burger but messy. I wanted to responded to Eamonn that everything was alright when he asked but I was too focused on keeping the burger together. The rice and chili were easier to manage since I could use a fork.",3.0

Cornbread was not too heavy and pretty good! Service was great and the vibe was good too. Just the price was high and just a decently solid food. Stop the hype please.,3.0
"This was my first ever visit to a Dinosaur BBQ. The name refers only to the primitive themed menu since the inside is neither dinosaur nor caveman themed. The decor is set to look old and that's it. I sat at the bar although plenty of tables were available at 2pm on a sunny Saturday. I ordered the Dino Burger patter with a side of fried rice and A.K. chili. As I ate my meal, I listened to the all genre music selections and since British soccer was on, I watched women's tennis. The burger was of the popular thin bun that can't support the weight of whatever is on top style. It was a good burger but messy. I wanted to responded to Eamonn that everything was alright when he asked but I was too focused on keeping the burger together. The rice and chili were easier to manage since I could use a fork.",3.0

"There BBQ sauce is addictive!!!! I had there Brisket BBQ sandwich that comes with a side my choice was mac n cheese and its just heaven!! I managed to steal some of my friends skirt steak it was so soft, and that sauce it comes with is orgasmic!! YOU NEED TO COME HERE BEFORE YOU DIE!Brisket sandwich is so soft and its a very chill atmosphere! Live band when I went on saturday but the wait was an hour and 45 mins! So be prepared to wait!!It is so crowded you cant even reach the bar! My advice give your name they send you a message when your table is ready and go to CANAL BAR around the corner free popcorn big screen and alcohol! Thats what I did worked out great. Reasonable pricing  cant wait to go back! Service was slow but what do you expect the place was packed!",4.0
"It doesn't compare to the original in Syracuse but decent ribs and pulled pork. Eric and I got the chilled shrimp and sausage with crackers and pimento cheese. The shrimp was really good but the sausage was a disappointment...slices of sausage with barely a smear of pimento cheese on soggy crackers. I got the tres ninos (pulled pork, ribs and brisket) with mac 'n' cheese and greens. The sides were really good, the pulled pork was great and the ribs were good. Overall, it just didn't do it for us.",3.0
"The BBQ here is just OK. I ordered a full rack with sweet mash and fries. The ribs were dry...jerky dry almost in some parts, and was difficult to cut. Seemed like the ribs had been cooked twice, which dried the heck out of it. No fall off the bone goodness here, just a wresting match with a set of ribs.While the sweet mash was good, the fries were over cooked and overly crunchy.For more succulent meat sickles of oral pleasure, I highly recommend Cubby's in Hackensack, NJ. They leave Dinosaur BBQ in the Stone Age.",2.0
"The dino is the best bbq I've ever had! Hands down. I wish there were more of these restaurants on the west coast.Order the chicken wings!!!!

"As a vegetarian I usually don't find myself at BBQ restaurants, but after looking at their menu and noticing what they call the ""F.G.T.V."" sandwich, I definitely had to check it out. The F.G.T.V. consists of Fried Green Tomatoes, Pimiento Cheese, Shredded Cabbage, Chow Chow, and BBQ Mayo. It's definitely up there with one of the best vegetarian sandwiches I've ever had. Everything about it worked so well together. Pimiento Cheese is one of my favorite things, so this was a really awesome and original addition. I love when restaurants put a little more effort into their vegetarian options, and offer more than just your typical veggie burger, or vegetable sandwich/ salad. I ordered it as a platter which is $12.50. It comes with two sides, so I decided to take the carbs to the next level and get Mac & Cheese, with French Fries. Both sides are your typical versions, nothing really special. The mac & cheese was a little on the cold side which was disappointing, but the fries were freshly fried, and extremely hot. The sandwich platter doesn't come with their cornbread, and I'd decided against ordering it, seeing as I'd already had tons of carbs on my plate, but the awesome waitress brought me out a complimentary one to try. For dessert we went with the Peanut Butter Pie ($5.00). Words cannot properly describe how incredibly amazing it was. The pie alone deserves five stars. I could have happily eaten slice after slice until I was sick. If you're a peanut butter lover, this is a must order. It's extremely rich, but probably the best slice of peanut butter pie I've ever had. Save room for dessert, or get it to go. You don't want to pass this up. Atmosphere is really chill, and cool. I can imagine it gets quite busy on weekends. Like I mentioned above our waitress was really cool, and friendly. Service was spot on. I can't speak for the meat, but as a vegetarian I'd definitely check out this place.",4.0
"The food here is fine.  Not out of this world.  That's apparently enough to procure voluminous crowds, but the fact is, despite being a local institution, Dino is one step away from a Times Sq-style theme restaurant.Though it has its strong points.  You can bring a kid here and they can holler and make all kinds of ruckus and because the place is loud it doesn't really register.  And the $5.95 kids menu is a pretty great deal.  Both times I've been here with my 4 year-old, there was more than enough food.  Plus they gave him crayons and something to color, so, you know, bonus.I've opted for sandwiches, first time going for the pulled pork, second time for the chicken churrasco.  Both were good.  Not overwhelming in taste or size.  Even with two sides (I opted for the BBQ beans and Harlem potato salad), I was still hungry afterward.  I attempted to eat off my sons's plate, but between his protestations and my wife's glare, it was clear I was done for the day.  My wife had the chopped salad with BBQ chicken, and while she enjoyed the chicken, she felt the salad was nothing to write home about.The beer menu is extensive, and I look forward to investigating it further.  Because let's face it -- a place like this, you can bring just about anybody -- young, old, whomever.  Brooklyn standards may be through the roof, but that doesn't mean everyone else will turn their noses up.  Just leave your expectations at the door, and you'll have a ""good enough"" time.",3.0

"This place is a super shiny gem in a city full of jewels. I have been to both the locations and as for food, it is great at both places.

They both ordered the Three Meat Platter, which hold brisket, roast chicken and ribs, comes with two sides and corn bread muffin. Really they both look like a small farm that has been slow roasted, smoked and cooked to perfection. Both the men in the group finished their meals, including the extra chicken in one sitting. Really, for normal people it would be more then enough for two people to be stuffed on. My friend always orders the ribs. They really seem to be fall off the bone goodness.

I was more reserved and ordered their BBQ Burgar. It honestly was the best burgar of my life. Perfectly cooked and with the perfect amount of cheese and BBQ sauce. It was so moist and the roll that it came on was so soft and delightful. It truly makes my mouth start to water thinking about it again. I hate to make this so long, but there are two more exceptionally delightful things about this place. Their sides are great, really spot on for a BBQ joint, but the true treasure is their homemade Mac and Cheese. There are not words for how perfect it is, and they seem to include part of the cheesy topping with each serving. It is a little peppery, so be warned, but it seems to cut some of the richness of the side. Honestly, 3 of the 4 of use ordered double mac and cheese for our two sides. Its really that good. Lastly, we some how ordered dessert. We ordered their Chocolate IceBox Pie, a perfect dark chocolate cream pie with a chocolate graham cracker crust. AND their Peanut Better Cream Pie, pretty much a thick peanut butter pie with a fudge topping. Both were perfect, and topped with fresh whipped cream. Both also very rich. Two slices servered four of use perfectly. This place is a winner!",5.0

"My daughter attended an event catered by Dinosaur BBQ in Brooklyn. She raved about for days and I think that's where the problem started. She hyped it up so much that my expectations were high. We ordered take out for dinner . Rib plate, Brisket plate, Pork plate our sides were the greens with smoked turkey, fries and Mac n Cheese. It was all just ok for the most part. The ribs were the best part of the entire meal they were meaty, tender, and flavorful . The greens were ok. We didn't like the Brisket. It wasn't moist and tender and flavorful as Brisket should be. The pork plate was good. My husband said his Mac n Cheese was just ok. He didn't finish it. Our 10 year old enjoyed his ribs and greens. One of our sides were wrong so my daughter didn't get her veggies because they gave us potato salad instead of the greens we paid for. It was really annoying because we live 30 minutes away.

"My wife and I went here for BBQ with some good friends.  We arrived on a brisk February night to find that the line was 1.5 hours long and they had just turned off the outside heat lamp.  After about 45 minutes of waiting we went in to ask if they could turn on the heat lamp for their guests as we had 2 small children with us...they were kind enough to agree.  We found out moments later that we had such an exorbitant wait because they were trying to seat us at a specialized table to accommodate out 2 children, even though we didn't ask for this, didn't need it, and worst of all they didn't ask us.  Finally after being seated and taking our orders they brought us cold nachos and cold wings.  The waitress was good enough to replace the order, so we trudged on.  The entrees including the brisket plate, lamb shoulder, and burgers were all cooked wrong, mostly overdone.  The brisket they brought out was dry and fatty the waitress was embarrassed and she took my plate away.  All in all, the food was terrible but the waitress was excellent.  I realized on my way out that any BBQ place that sells entrees and burgers instead of meat by the pound isn't worth your time... Please don't eat here.",2.0

"Its half a block down from the Union Street Subway stop.We got there around 4:30-ish.  NO Wait.  I know it seems early to show up for dinner, but considering the wait after we got seated and ordered drinks and our food, we were eating at around 5:15-ish and we were done by 6:00 p.m.  We ordered a trio of BBQ ribs, pulled pork, and brisket.  The BBQ are the BEST out of the three.  The Mac and Cheese Side is really ""Cheezy"" and they put a bit of spicy seasoning on top of it.  The Chili was surprisingly good.  Corn bread was good too!This Trio plus the 2 sides + a corn bread = $20. When we left around 6:00.  There were people waiting outside to get a table.  So if you don't mind an early dinner, get there between 4:30 and 5:00 to get seated right away!Other location is in Harlem.  But I'm never there so I'm glad there's one in Brooklyn.",4.0

"We came with family members visiting us from Europe, hoping to give them a flavor of Southern culinary culture in a welcoming setting. What a disappointment...

"My daughter attended an event catered by Dinosaur BBQ in Brooklyn. She raved about for days and I think that's where the problem started. She hyped it up so much that my expectations were high. We ordered take out for dinner . Rib plate, Brisket plate, Pork plate our sides were the greens with smoked turkey, fries and Mac n Cheese. It was all just ok for the most part. The ribs were the best part of the entire meal they were meaty, tender, and flavorful . The greens were ok. We didn't like the Brisket. It wasn't moist and tender and flavorful as Brisket should be. The pork plate was good. My husband said his Mac n Cheese was just ok. He didn't finish it. Our 10 year old enjoyed his ribs and greens. One of our sides were wrong so my daughter didn't get her veggies because they gave us potato salad instead of the greens we paid for. It was really annoying because we live 30 minutes away. Overall we weren't impressed.",3.0

"My wife and I went here for BBQ with some good friends.  We arrived on a brisk February night to find that the line was 1.5 hours long and they had just turned off the outside heat lamp.  After about 45 minutes of waiting we went in to ask if they could turn on the heat lamp for their guests as we had 2 small children with us...they were kind enough to agree.  We found out moments later that we had such an exorbitant wait because they were trying to seat us at a specialized table to accommodate out 2 children, even though we didn't ask for this, didn't need it, and worst of all they didn't ask us.  Finally after being seated and taking our orders they brought us cold nachos and cold wings.  The waitress was good enough to replace the order, so we trudged on.  The entrees including the brisket plate, lamb shoulder, and burgers were all cooked wrong, mostly overdone.  The brisket they brought out was dry and fatty the waitress was embarrassed and she took my plate away.  All in all, the food was terrible but the waitress was excellent.  I realized on my way out that any BBQ place that sells entrees and burgers instead of meat by the pound isn't worth your time... Please don't eat here.",2.0

"Its half a block down from the Union Street Subway stop.We got there around 4:30-ish.  NO Wait.  I know it seems early to show up for dinner, but considering the wait after we got seated and ordered drinks and our food, we were eating at around 5:15-ish and we were done by 6:00 p.m.  We ordered a trio of BBQ ribs, pulled pork, and brisket.  The BBQ are the BEST out of the three.  The Mac and Cheese Side is really ""Cheezy"" and they put a bit of spicy seasoning on top of it.  The Chili was surprisingly good.  Corn bread was good too!This Trio plus the 2 sides + a corn bread = $20. When we left around 6:00.  There were people waiting outside to get a table.  So if you don't mind an early dinner, get there between 4:30 and 5:00 to get seated right away!Other location is in Harlem.  But I'm never there so I'm glad there's one in Brooklyn.",4.0
"Went here last night and totally loved it. Before you walk in you can smell the deliciousness of the barbecue from outside. I ordered the 1/2 rack of ribs with a side of Mac and cheese and harlem potato salad. Didn't care for the potato salad but loved the ribs. They were filled with the smokey flavor and were succulent and juicy! Best ribs I've ever had hands down. Also, there sweet tea is everything you want in a sweet tea, the perfect amount of sweetness without being overly sugary",4.0
"We came with family members visiting us from Europe, hoping to give them a flavor of Southern culinary culture in a welcoming setting. What a disappointment... Our waiter was nice at first but the food really left us wondering how the place remains so popular. The ribs were dry as hell, and the brisket was cold, too fat and overcooked. The pork plate was alright, but the Mac and cheese was rather cold. To make the matter worse, we were left unattended for a long time after our table was cleaned. We waved at multiple servers, unsuccessfully, until one came to tell us she was not our server! Disappointing food and an attitude... I would not recommend this place.",1.0
"There was no wait since we made reservations. Very large, open space. We weren't too hungry so we just ordered a three meat combo, which comes with two sides. The chili was as good chili should be. The potato salad was chunky but didn't taste overly starchy. Their pork is really good - we got the pulled pork and the ribs. Just the right amount of spice and BBQ. The brisket was good, but not smoked as well as some other BBQ joints I've been to (like Briskettown). Maybe I would come back one day, but I got this weird Dallas BBQ feel in the restaurant.",4.0
"I didn't believe the hype.  When I heard they were opening up I was like ""What is all the fuss about?"".  Now I know.First off, I'm not really a fan of American style BBQ.  I'm really not down with the whole ""smokey"" thing... just doesn't do it for me.  Secondly, for various reasons, I don't eat beef or pork... so that usually renders most BBQ places off limits for me.  However, the 20% of this menu that I COULD eat, has been amazing.  The wings... great.  The chicken sandwiches.... great.  The fried green tomatoes... the mac and cheese... the potato salad... great, great, great!There's a pretty long wait right now, so do yourself a fav... put your name in, go to the awesome Canal Bar around the corner for a drink while you wait, then come back and have... well... if you ask me... all the chicken.",5.0
Great tasting BBQ all the time! I love the fried green tomatoes and wango tango wings! Beer selection is always on point although they don't rotate the taps as often as I'd like.

Kale and black-eyed peas, ""Harlem"" potato salad (not sure what's so Harlem about it), cornbread -- all kind of middling.The St. Louis ribs were kind of dry.The cheesecake was fine, but something seemed a little bit different about it.

"Once again I tried something new and could not eat more than a bite. I am a die hard fan of the Syracuse DBQ but the Brooklyn spot always disappoints. Stick with the beer, eggs, wings and sides.

The drinks have very creative names like the donkey punch w/c my bf got for us.  I like fruity drinks, but I wasn't too fond of the mix.  As for the food, the st. louis bbq ribs was tender but not amazing.  I enjoyed the mac and cheese and the hot sauce selection they have on the table.  Also, the wings were very tasty w/c I would definitely get again.  Not to mention that the the server (Claire) we got was very attentive and friendly even though it was busy.",3.0

By the end of it, I had a nice buzz and the food was to my stomachs pleasure.  The only thing that is bad about Dino is their service time to time, but I will chalk that up for the fact it's always crowded.

"I'll give this to them: the meat, whether it was St. Louis ribs, pulled pork, or brisket, was delicious. The fried green tomatoes are very good, but sometimes the sides are a miss.

"I came here on the 4th of July, I thought this place was appropriate for the holiday. I was soooo right. I walked here all the way from Crown Heights and I must say it was well worth it. So when I arrived to the restaurant it reminded me of those old western films in a good way! When I got there I was told there was a 45 minute wait. It's the holiday so couldn't really complain. But, I was offered quicker seating if I wanted eat outside boy was I sold. So this review is based on outdoor seating which I absolutely am in love with. The waiter was a bit mia in a way but, I loved his great personality. The ribs was soooo soft and it slipped right of the bone. I loved that they give you a bucket to put the bones in which is very much needed. I came here with a friend just an FYI the portion sizes are HUGE, looking at it online gone may think it's sooo small but, it actually isn't! My meal consisted of the ribs, 1/2 chicken, Mac and cheese Cole slaw and corn bread. I was stuffed at the end. This place is a must go place if your looking for authentic southern comfort food.

"Dinosaur's newest location is like Skittles and Doritos - two good things, awkwardly combined. The mini-chain has gone maxi for this location, occupying a former warehouse over two sprawling rooms. It dwarfs even the new-ish place near my hometown in Troy. But it's not big enough. Huge lines form on weekend nights, which become enormous lines during the weekend. You'd think there were no other barbecue places in Brooklyn. The somewhat out of the way location means either a long wait outside with a beer in the increasingly cold outside patio, or nervously slink several blocks away and hope you make it back when the reservation app vibrates on the app. Our waitress on a recent visit was incredibly charming and efficient and let us temporarily forget that we were eating in a place that was more heaving than a Soviet canteen at lunchtime. They'll need 20 or 50 of her to make a dining experience here at all tolerable. As it stands, the rushed plating and constant roar doesn't make for a pleasant meal.The food here is recognizably Dinosaur - that heavy smoke and hearty sides that served as many Upstate residents first real introduction to non-Smoky Bones fare.

We ordered non alcoholic drinks and water which ended up coming after we were done eating. We ordered the sweetheart deal which serves 2 people; Full rack of ribs and 4 side orders, we ordered mac and cheese, collard greens, fries and bbq beans. The Ribs were the best part thankfully all the other side orders were just ok for me.

Great ambience the dark lighting gave a cozy feel but horrible for crappy camera phones. We didn't have to wait much. The food was good but I was disappointed. I discover them at the big Apple barbecue and the food was awesome. I guess I build up the experience in my head.However Sunday the brisket was charred on top and even though the meat was tender underneath that charred taste ruined the experience. Four dollars for a glass of cream soda masquerading as a pint. Appetizer was three tiny pieces of chicken. At the end of the day the food was good but the experience was disappointing. Oh yeah no parking so you gotta hunt for a spot. And if you're going to give this place a try I highly recommend you make a reservation because even on a Sunday it was crowded.,3.0

"I had been amping and preparing myself all day for the Dinosaur. I was still in physical pain upon exiting but I take that as a sign of success! I only had one beer here. I knew I wasn't going to be much capable of anything more because I was here for the food. But I tried Dinosaur's house ale. It was a little hoppy, not too heavy, a little funky of an after taste and I wasn't sold on the beer. Our waiter after I said ""I LIKE MANLY MAN BEERS."" recommended this or the Kentucky bourbon barrel ale, which I ironically had next door at Union Hall while I was waiting for everyone to gather. I highly recommend the Bourbon ale actually, it tastes like bourbon and a beer had a baby and made sweet love in my mouth. Moving on to the food, my buddy Gu ended up ordering the sampler swag appetizer platter for 1 and asked if I wanted to try one of his shrimp. The entire plate is pretty big for 1 and comes with a drunken spicy shrimp boil, chicken wings, fried green tomatoes, and deviled eggs. But I think they literally give you 1 or 2 pieces of each item, so order accordingly. I don't know how to eat shrimp. I tried to eat the shell. I'm from the Midwest. Excuses excuses. But I've never encountered shrimp on the shell before with its little appendages and had no idea what to do. So I ate it to everyone's horror. It was still delicious. For my meal I ordered the pulled pork Cuban sandwich that comes with ham, swiss, mustard and pickles on a pressed roll with a side of their mac n' cheese. I did see one of the prior reviews mentioned that I would see God in my Mac n' cheese so I had high expectations. I think we all agreed that we saw God in our sandwiches and that the Mac was definitely of high quality but maybe not the best I've ever had in my entire life. But it was up there for being of intense quality. I think the secret is that they may mix a tiny bit of mustard in there and don't overwhelm you with cheese so that it doesn't get globby. It was creamy with a little burnt bubbly topping and well seasoned. I also caved and got a side of cornbread. It's worth getting. Actually, I think Catfish's in Brooklyn had better cornbread because of their sweet butter mixture. But this was pretty moist and went well with hot sauce, because I'm a freak with hot sauce. My friend didn't want her bbq fried rice side because it had onions in that. So I split it with another person. It was tasty but over-hyped. I also sampled a fork full of someone's turkey neck greens and holy crap that was amazing! I don't really like collard greens because they're often cooked poorly or are over salted. No. Delicious. Other people got the chopped melt brisket sandwich, insanely as hot as you can go chicken wings, someone had a bbq platter of ribs. We were an eclectic bunch. But the brisket looked great and the dude's rack of ribs went finished. All of this was topped off with their chocolate icebox cake which I'm pretty sure is the best thing I've ever put in my mouth. Ever. Period. If I could have this every day of my life I would be the happiest person on Earth. What do they even put in this? I don't even see this on their menu. But whatever. It's thick, rich, creamy frozen chocolaty almost like a frozen custard but with the most decadent chocolate. The texture. MAN.

They will text you when your table is about to be ready and you get carry away at a nearby bar like I did, you can text back no give my table away or hold it, I am crawling back. No hard feelings!Note: during peak hours the dinning hall get pretty loud inside so don't take your date if you are looking for a candle lit dinner with piano music in the background.Update for the take out service- my office ordered from here a couple of times and there has been no complaints.",4.0
"Dinosaur BBQ, welcome to Brooklyn!!!Overhearing all of the buzz about the Harlem location and overseeing the construction of an abandoned fire-ridden warehouse become a popular eating establishment, I was very excited at the prospect of coming here to eat. As soon as you enter, the sweet smoke of barbecue fills the air, engulfing your lungs with its savory, hickory, slightly charred aroma. My friend and I had an event to attend after dinner, so we made the waitress fully aware that we had somewhere to be. She assured us that it would not be a problem and they would try to expedite our order as quickly as possible. The menu looked very appetizing but with little time to decide, I ordered the ""smothered"" mojito chicken breast sandwich with mac n' cheese, fries and a 1/4 lb. of the drunken spicy shrimp boil. When having BBQ, you gotta have beer so my meal was complimented by a Sam Adam Summer Ale. :-)The shrimp was the first thing to come out. 8 pieces of medium-sized shrimp marinated in beer, cayenne, old bay seasoning and many other herbs and spices topped with a sprinkle of cayenne. Peeling away the first shrimp, you could tell it had been properly boiled and had been cooked to perfection Each and every single element that was infused into the shrimp could be distinguished. They also provided a little trash bucket to place the shells and other garbage which was very convenient. Our entire order didn't take to long and came out shortly after we had destroyed the shrimp. My friend and I both ordered mojito chicken sandwiches but each one had a slight variation. However, his choice of sides were cornbread and cole slaw.The entrees were brought out but they had mixed up the sandwiches and apologized for the mix-up. The waitress offered to take it back and change it but we politely declined. It was nothing to go crazy over, we simply pulled a switcharoo and dug in. The mac n' cheese was very cheesy and sort of pasty but still very scrumptious. The fries were as fries should be, nice, greasy topped with a moderate dash of salt. The mojito chicken sandwich was just ""OK"" in my opinion. There was large portion of pulled chicken on the sandwich except it was very messy to eat. I'm sure I used like 10 napkins during the course of that one sandwich. Thank God for that handy-dandy bucket. With the addition of their original sauce, melted cheese and sauteed onions, mushrooms, peppers the chicken tended to ooze out and fell here and there. It became a very messy sandwich to eat and I didn't feel it was the best it could have been. Sneaking a piece of cornbread from my friend, I found it to be a little grainy and dense. The cole slaw was homemade, and it tasted very fresh and decent.During the course of our meal, the waitress brought out our check when we were 3/4 of the way through and told us that she hoped she expedited the process of our meal and we could pay when we were ready. Personally, I felt the customer service here was exquisite. I can understand other Yelper's complaints why service may be slow because for a Monday night, that place was packed, and I was having dinner at 6:30. People were still flocking in by the time I had left. Maybe it was because the server knew we were in a rush and had somewhere to be but we were in and out in about 30 minutes, which was awesome. I wished I had gotten a different sandwich or possibly the BBQ chicken or BBQ catfish but there will always be a next time.",4.0

"I'm not sure which of us is more to blame.  Dinosaur BBQ, for designing a BBQ brisket sandwich with caramelized onions and blue cheese on it; or me, for ordering that sandwich.  It was actually pretty tasty, if gooey and kind of hard to eat thanks to the toughness of the brisket.  But I still felt as if I'd done something deeply wrong.  In Texas, I think you'd get shot for less.That said, the black-eyed peas with collard greens were extremely good, and left me feeling a little redeemed.",3.0

"My girlfriend and I were in Brooklyn for a date activity, and after we were STARVING! We came to Dinosaur Barbecue and were far from disappointed. My gf got a chicken sandwich and I ordered a burger. I ordered my burger well done, and  it came back undercooked. I was about to be very disappointed, until I was able to send it back and get it redone. On top of that, the manager came over and told me they were taking my burger off the bill! What good customer service!The burger was amazing; the fries very crispy; the Mac and cheese was full of flavor.  I would definitely come back to this place in the future and would highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for authentic and delicious BBQ.",5.0
"4.5 stars, but closer to 5 than 4! My boyfriend and I came out to Dinosaur BBQ last night with reservations through HowAboutWe. Our reservation was at 9pm and the place was still packed, but we didn't have a wait since we had reservations. I would definitely recommend reservations for anyone at anytime, since we came at 9pm on a wednesday and it was still super busy. Our waitress was really helpful and nice, but wasn't aware of the HowAboutWe deal and had to consult her manager a few times to make sure she knew what we received. Not a huge deal. The HowAboutWe deal came with two beer flights of your choice, swag sampler, 4 ribs, 2 sliders, 2 sides and a desert. Our beer flights came out quickly, four 1/4 pints of craft beers. My boyfriend got the ""high octane"" flight, which seemed to be a tasting of four of their highest ABV choices. I opted for the ""choose your own"", and ended up picking 3 beers that were in the high octane, except I swapped out one of them for a laguintas. The beers that really stood out for me was the kentucky bourbon ale and their exclusive Brooklyn Brewmasters. The kentucky bourbon ale was a dark beer with hints of bourbon and vanilla. It was perfect for pairing with the BBQ and I ordered a pint of it to have with dinner. On the other hand, Their Exclusive Brooklyn Brewmasters did not suit me at all. I really really did not like it - it had a strange soapy/floral aftertaste. The swag sampler came out next, which had two wings (we chose garlic chipotle sauce), two fried green tomatoes, four drunken spicy boiled shrimp, and two deviled eggs. There were three dipping suaces; bleu cheese, some creamy scallion dressing and then cocktail sauce. All of them were really great, especially the fried green tomatoes. Next we got two pulled pork sliders, ribs, and sides. The sliders were good, but nothing compared to the ribs. The ribs fell right off the bone and had such an amazing smokey flavor. The potato salad was a great compliment and had unique flavors, as did the baked beans. We finished up with the chocolate icebox cake. I am not huge on desert but this was very very good and happened to go well with the kentucky bourbon ale I was still working on! We left there so full, walking to the train was difficult! We though we would have needed to order more but I would have regretted it if i did!Only reason I think 4.5 stars vs 5 is because they have limited outdoor seating, and the yelpers at the harlem location who used the HowAboutWe deal also got cornbread with their meals. While it wasn't stated in the deal that we would get cornbread, I would have ordered it additionally, but since I saw they got it i didn't order it. Not a huge deal, but I would have loved to try it.

"I love this restaurant! A friend recommended it so we  made reservations. My food was so delicious! Probably the best bbq I've ever had!! The bbq sauce is thick and tasty, the mac and cheese is so good, I can't even put my finger on what they did; and the turkey neck greens....OMG!! Amazing!! Tasted the Bbq Fried Rice and was so very pleased. I had the quarter ribs and the honey bbq chicken wings. Vera was our server. She was attentive and very helpful with our menu choice. I will definitely be back.",5.0
"Quick and efficient service for a BBQ establishment.  In my books, They will not be known for their margaritas, however the wings and ribs are excellent. The sweetheart deal is my favorite.  I devour them pink ring ribs every visit like if you see me you will know it is me. Or maybe I am not the only one.Dinning hall is vast and lots of tables inside and also a few outside but they were always full every time I went. They have a pretty good system for your wait. They will text you when your table is about to be ready and you get carry away at a nearby bar like I did, you can text back no give my table away or hold it, I am crawling back. No hard feelings!Note: during peak hours the dinning hall get pretty loud inside so don't take your date if you are looking for a candle lit dinner with piano music in the background.Update for the take out service- my office ordered from here a couple of times and there has been no complaints.",4.0
"Dinosaur BBQ, welcome to Brooklyn!!!Overhearing all of the buzz about the Harlem location and overseeing the construction of an abandoned fire-ridden warehouse become a popular eating establishment, I was very excited at the prospect of coming here to eat. As soon as you enter, the sweet smoke of barbecue fills the air, engulfing your lungs with its savory, hickory, slightly charred aroma. My friend and I had an event to attend after dinner, so we made the waitress fully aware that we had somewhere to be. She assured us that it would not be a problem and they would try to expedite our order as quickly as possible. The menu looked very appetizing but with little time to decide, I ordered the ""smothered"" mojito chicken breast sandwich with mac n' cheese, fries and a 1/4 lb. of the drunken spicy shrimp boil. When having BBQ, you gotta have beer so my meal was complimented by a Sam Adam Summer Ale. :-)The shrimp was the first thing to come out. 8 pieces of medium-sized shrimp marinated in beer, cayenne, old bay seasoning and many other herbs and spices topped with a sprinkle of cayenne. Peeling away the first shrimp, you could tell it had been properly boiled and had been cooked to perfection Each and every single element that was infused into the shrimp could be distinguished. They also provided a little trash bucket to place the shells and other garbage which was very convenient. Our entire order didn't take to long and came out shortly after we had destroyed the shrimp. My friend and I both ordered mojito chicken sandwiches but each one had a slight variation. However, his choice of sides were cornbread and cole slaw.The entrees were brought out but they had mixed up the sandwiches and apologized for the mix-up. The waitress offered to take it back and change it but we politely declined. It was nothing to go crazy over, we simply pulled a switcharoo and dug in. The mac n' cheese was very cheesy and sort of pasty but still very scrumptious. The fries were as fries should be, nice, greasy topped with a moderate dash of salt. The mojito chicken sandwich was just ""OK"" in my opinion. There was large portion of pulled chicken on the sandwich except it was very messy to eat. I'm sure I used like 10 napkins during the course of that one sandwich. Thank God for that handy-dandy bucket. With the addition of their original sauce, melted cheese and sauteed onions, mushrooms, peppers the chicken tended to ooze out and fell here and there. It became a very messy sandwich to eat and I didn't feel it was the best it could have been. Sneaking a piece of cornbread from my friend, I found it to be a little grainy and dense. The cole slaw was homemade, and it tasted very fresh and decent.During the course of our meal, the waitress brought out our check when we were 3/4 of the way through and told us that she hoped she expedited the process of our meal and we could pay when we were ready. Personally, I felt the customer service here was exquisite. I can understand other Yelper's complaints why service may be slow because for a Monday night, that place was packed, and I was having dinner at 6:30. People were still flocking in by the time I had left. Maybe it was because the server knew we were in a rush and had somewhere to be but we were in and out in about 30 minutes, which was awesome. I wished I had gotten a different sandwich or possibly the BBQ chicken or BBQ catfish but there will always be a next time.",4.0
"Great barbecue! Good brisket, although the slices are a bit thin and small. Great chicken. Overall a great place with reasonable prices.",4.0
Only go for the ribs and drinks. Wait time gets to be a bit much and the sides are horrible.,2.0
We originally had reservations for another restaurant and did not like the menu.  We decided to go to Dino and was told the wait was an hour.  They sat us in 20 min.  Jessie (owner) personally check on us 5 times during our meal.  The wings were unbelievably good.  The Mac and cheese is the best in NY and the drink selection was good.  Service was wonderful.  Dino is a must have!,4.0
"I'm not sure which of us is more to blame.  Dinosaur BBQ, for designing a BBQ brisket sandwich with caramelized onions and blue cheese on it; or me, for ordering that sandwich.  It was actually pretty tasty, if gooey and kind of hard to eat thanks to the toughness of the brisket.  But I still felt as if I'd done something deeply wrong.  In Texas, I think you'd get shot for less.That said, the black-eyed peas with collard greens were extremely good, and left me feeling a little redeemed.",3.0

"My girlfriend and I were in Brooklyn for a date activity, and after we were STARVING! We came to Dinosaur Barbecue and were far from disappointed. My gf got a chicken sandwich and I ordered a burger. I ordered my burger well done, and  it came back undercooked. I was about to be very disappointed, until I was able to send it back and get it redone. On top of that, the manager came over and told me they were taking my burger off the bill! What good customer service!The burger was amazing; the fries very crispy; the Mac and cheese was full of flavor.  I would definitely come back to this place in the future and would highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for authentic and delicious BBQ.",5.0
"4.5 stars, but closer to 5 than 4! My boyfriend and I came out to Dinosaur BBQ last night with reservations through HowAboutWe. Our reservation was at 9pm and the place was still packed, but we didn't have a wait since we had reservations. I would definitely recommend reservations for anyone at anytime, since we came at 9pm on a wednesday and it was still super busy. Our waitress was really helpful and nice, but wasn't aware of the HowAboutWe deal and had to consult her manager a few times to make sure she knew what we received. Not a huge deal. The HowAboutWe deal came with two beer flights of your choice, swag sampler, 4 ribs, 2 sliders, 2 sides and a desert. Our beer flights came out quickly, four 1/4 pints of craft beers. My boyfriend got the ""high octane"" flight, which seemed to be a tasting of four of their highest ABV choices. I opted for the ""choose your own"", and ended up picking 3 beers that were in the high octane, except I swapped out one of them for a laguintas. The beers that really stood out for me was the kentucky bourbon ale and their exclusive Brooklyn Brewmasters. The kentucky bourbon ale was a dark beer with hints of bourbon and vanilla. It was perfect for pairing with the BBQ and I ordered a pint of it to have with dinner. On the other hand, Their Exclusive Brooklyn Brewmasters did not suit me at all. I really really did not like it - it had a strange soapy/floral aftertaste. The swag sampler came out next, which had two wings (we chose garlic chipotle sauce), two fried green tomatoes, four drunken spicy boiled shrimp, and two deviled eggs. There were three dipping suaces; bleu cheese, some creamy scallion dressing and then cocktail sauce. All of them were really great, especially the fried green tomatoes. Next we got two pulled pork sliders, ribs, and sides. The sliders were good, but nothing compared to the ribs. The ribs fell right off the bone and had such an amazing smokey flavor. The potato salad was a great compliment and had unique flavors, as did the baked beans. We finished up with the chocolate icebox cake. I am not huge on desert but this was very very good and happened to go well with the kentucky bourbon ale I was still working on! We left there so full, walking to the train was difficult! We though we would have needed to order more but I would have regretted it if i did!Only reason I think 4.5 stars vs 5 is because they have limited outdoor seating, and the yelpers at the harlem location who used the HowAboutWe deal also got cornbread with their meals. While it wasn't stated in the deal that we would get cornbread, I would have ordered it additionally, but since I saw they got it i didn't order it. Not a huge deal, but I would have loved to try it.

"If there were 1/2 star options I would give this place 3 1/2 stars.I came here last week with my boyfriend who just moved to New York. BBQ is something we enjoyed together regularly in LA, so this move has prompted us to seek out a new locale of which we can patronize regularly.We ordered the baby back ribs, 1/4 lb. shrimp boil, hot link, and brisket with mac N cheese and collard greens on the side. (We made the huge mistake of not trying the cornbread unfortunately!)Well, firstly the baby back ribs were just as tender and delicious as everyone says, you seriously don't even need teeth to eat these!! Really delicious.The shrimp boil was disappointing and I absolutely love shrimp, I order it every place I can. And although it may seem strange to order shrimp at a bbq restaurant, this isn't the first nor the last time I've done this... but certainly wouldn't recommend doing it here. Apparently 1/4 of a lb = like 4 or 5 shrimps on the smaller size of medium. They were cold and flavorless apart from the sauce they came with. :(The hot link was good, but crumbles apart when you cut into it which made it a bit difficult to eat... like trying to eat ground beef with a fork. That wasn't really the mouthfeel I prefer for a hot link, so while the flavors were there I don't think I'd order this again.My boyfriend and I disagreed a bit about the brisket. The meat itself was very good, but I wasn't really a fan of the sauce and jalapeños that accompanied it. It was too spicy for me. I tend to enjoy foods that are moderately spicy, but I prefer to choose for myself how much spice will go on my meat.The macaroni and cheese was ok, not mind blowing, I mainly used it to cut the spice from the jalapeños so I may not have experienced it to it's fullest potential.The collard greens were delicious though! Probably the best collard greens I've ever had. They were chopped into the perfect size and the flavors and everything were just so on point.After dinner we had a slice of the peanut butter pie. OH MY GOD. Whoever makes this seriously needs to enter it into competitions. The pie was sweet without overpowering the peanut butter and had just the right balance so you know the peanut butter has been treated to go into a pie, but still maintains its creamy texture. The chocolate crust was salty and the perfect accompaniment to the filling. Really, really job well done.So overall, I think I feel like I enjoyed it but wasn't necessarily blown away by the meal as a whole. I don't feel hard pressed to go back any time soon, maybe after trying out a few other bbq joints in the area. Definitely if I do ever return, a full rack of ribs, the collard greens and the peanut butter pie are the WAY to go.",3.0

"So I must be one of few people who has not succumbed to the DIno BBQ craze. In the beginning when i use to go to the one in Harlem it was good. But then something changed. It's not as good as before. My friends love it but for me its ok. I went to the latest location in the Dino franchise, I believe on the second day after its opening. I will say that it appears bigger, in my opinion, than the one in Harlem. I did notice a few item changes that I had not seen in the Harlem location.So believe it or not after having gone to Dino maybe 5 - 6 times, this is the first time I had the ribs. The ribs were good but the Brisket was the BOMB.com. Something new that I notice on the menu was KAle and Black Eyed peas. So being that I am a huge lover of Kale and not too fond of black eyed peas, I asked the waitress what was the ratio of kale to peas. To which she responded, more kale than beans. So you could imagine my sadness when my plate did not come out with any leafy green magic just peas -_-. When she returned, she attempted to rectify the situation and gave me some collards which were really yumm. So lets just add that the food came out a tad luke warm, I didn't want to be the bitch of the table so something I usually am a stifler for I let pass cause the waitress was so nice! Some other new additions to the menu:chow chow sandwichbbq fried riceI didn't have these items but my friend who loves DINO BBQ said it was good. Conclusion:I would say that the HArlem one is more lively but maybe I need to give the brooklyn one some more time. It is conveniently located literally one minute away from the R train and 3 stops away from the city. I do however feel bad for the residential ppl who live right across the street from the restaurant. And also my friends, who know I am an avid yelper, wanted me to add that the mensroom had a very dirty sink, like really dirty. LMAO Au Revoir!",3.0

"Dinosaur is a new, but very solid BBQ place in Brooklyn. They've only been open for about a month, but it seems like they've made a great impression on everyone who's visited so far, including me. It's certainly helped that they were right across the street from the hotel I was staying in, but after eating there, I would seek it out again, regardless of location.I stopped by mid-afternoon and it was very busy. I realize some of that can be attributed to the ""newness"" factor, but the interior is huge and most of the tables were occupied. You can also eat outside, if you so choose. I grabbed a seat at the large bar to decide what to eat.Everything, including the ribs and combo meals, looked excellent but I decided to keep it simple with an original BBQ pulled pork sandwich with a side of Mac & Cheese. There was plenty of moist pork on the large sandwich and it tasted excellent. The M&C was also very good. Although I stuck with ice water, it looked like they also have a rather large beer selection in both bottles and drafts.I hesitate on giving five starts because they're still working out the kinks on the service side. Even with a number of bartenders working, it still took me awhile to get a drink and place my order. It seems like they were more concerned about filling all the numerous servers' drink orders over tending to the people actually at the bar. I realize it's a challenging balancing act, which should probably work itself out as everyone gets more comfortable in their positions and routines.",4.0

It's certainly helped that they were right across the street from the hotel I was staying in, but after eating there, I would seek it out again, regardless of location.I stopped by mid-afternoon and it was very busy. I realize some of that can be attributed to the ""newness"" factor, but the interior is huge and most of the tables were occupied. You can also eat outside, if you so choose. I grabbed a seat at the large bar to decide what to eat.Everything, including the ribs and combo meals, looked excellent but I decided to keep it simple with an original BBQ pulled pork sandwich with a side of Mac & Cheese. There was plenty of moist pork on the large sandwich and it tasted excellent. The M&C was also very good. Although I stuck with ice water, it looked like they also have a rather large beer selection in both bottles and drafts.I hesitate on giving five starts because they're still working out the kinks on the service side. Even with a number of bartenders working, it still took me awhile to get a drink and place my order. It seems like they were more concerned about filling all the numerous servers' drink orders over tending to the people actually at the bar. I realize it's a challenging balancing act, which should probably work itself out as everyone gets more comfortable in their positions and routines.",4.0
"I have to say we were all very happy and satisfied with our experience at Dino BK. We arrived for our res on time and were seated after about five minutes. The place was extremely busy as it was opening night. The restaurant is decorated very nicely in full blown BBQ/industrial Brooklyn style. We ordered the Swag sampler for two, honey BBQ wings and breakfast all day for starters. The swag sampler was nice and presented well. It comes with deviled eggs, boiled shrimp, fried green tomatoes and chicken wings. Everything on the swag was pretty good not great but definitely enjoyable. The wings were very nice. The breakfast all day which is smoked brisket hash with an egg on top was delicious! It comes with two sides. We chose turkey neck greens and cole slaw, both were nice. We all had combos for entrees. The brisket was excellent! The ribs were very good but i could only eat one because we ordered a ton of food. The pulled pork was delicious and the sausage my brother ordered was very good. The combos come with two sides. We tried beans, potato salad and all had mac and cheese. The mac and cheese stood out as the favorite. It was cheesey as hell!!! The combos also come with a little cornbread muffin style that was delicious. Everything was very good and it felt like they were very much on top of things for the launch and that was good to see. The drink selection is very nice as well. Service was quick, attentive and pleasant. They have a ton of different options and should be able to satisfy just about anyone. Yes there will be families and kids and i would suggest making a reservation. This is a BBQ restaurant that is for everybody. People who have tried plenty of BBQ will not be blown away by it but the difference is you can just sit down, relax and be SERVED some very solid BBQ. Well done by Dinosaur on opening night!",4.0
"This place is amazing. Two friends and I came up to NYC, and we stayed in The Holiday Inn Express right across the street. We came here twice, once for dinner and once the next day for bloody Mary's. Dinner: we walked in and were greeted by friendly hostesses who informed us it was a 20 minute wait. We go to the bar and order a drink while we wait for our table. We got the appetizer sampler for 2 (deviled eggs were a little salty but everything else was amazing), the sweetheart dinner for two (combo dinner with the sausage and shrimp and 2 sides) and a full rack of ribs with 4 sides). I don't even like BBQ and it was so good. The peel and eat shrimp were delicious, the ribs were OUTSTANDING (and I didn't even put sauce on them) and the collared greens were really good. Service was incredible. She attended to all of our needs and the manager helped us figure out where we should take the subway.We came for bloody Mary's the next day and Megan the bartender was very helpful and friendly. Over, best experience in NYC.",5.0
"No more trekking to Harlem. Glad they now have BK spot. Very large with a laid-back rustic decor.Table of 6. Most of us ordered the St Louis ribs  which I think is their staple. One comment on our table: "" Meat is better at Hill Country but their sides here are soooo much better"". I agree.  I had the Tres Ninos with a sample of ribs, brisket and pulled pork. Aside from the ribs, I've had better brisket and pulled pork. Not saying it wasn't delicious. Brisket could be a little more flavorful and tender. The Mac n cheese and BBQ fried rice were awesome! Fried tomatoes is a good app. I even had the side of salad of the day with tomato/cucumber in a vinaigrette and it was tasty. Great portions. Enough for 2 lunches the next day.Also great service! I totally see myself coming back to this new BK staple.",4.0
"I saw a couple of reviews of this place and thought I would try it out with a couple of friends. I had pretty high expectations but I'm not gonna lie, I was pretty disappointed.Atmosphere: It's a pretty nice place. It's in a hipster-ish neighborhood and the inside kinda reflects that. It's casual and somewhere you could go to hang out. The place is pretty big also. I came at around 12 pm so it was pretty empty and i didn't have to wait. 4/5.Service: The waitress was really nice and always checked to make sure we were ok 5/5Food: Now this is probably the most confusing part about this place. I'll go into detail about this later. I ordered the solo swag sampler with the St. Louis Ribs and BBQ Brisket combo, with mac and cheese and collard greens sides ($17.95). My friend ordered a burger with a fried egg (I forgot what it was called) and he really like it. The solo swag sampler plate was pretty disappointing, not because it tasted bad, but because it cost $7. It came with one slice of fried tomato, ONE chicken leg, 3 shrimps and a deviled egg. It tasted fine, but DEFINITELY not worth $7, especially for the small amount of food that comes with it. 2/5I also had the poutine which was about the same price and tasted really good. If I go back, I'd definitely get the poutine. 4.5/5The Ribs were decent, not the best but probably pretty good for the price. My grandmother makes better ribs hands down. 3/5The BBQ brisket was meh, it melted in my mouth, yet it was kinda dry and thin. 3/5.The mac and cheese was decently cheesy, not the best either. The collard greens were okay but they could've had more flavor. 3/5 for both. Oh and the cornbread was, well, cornbread. It's smaller than Dallas bbq cornbread and less sweet. The servings are smaller than I expected them to be, but oddly, I was stuffed without finishing my food. This was really shocking to me actually. I was sure that I wouldn't be filled up, yet my stomach told me otherwise. It's hard to explain, I felt full, but I wasn't actually satisfied. I've eaten much more food and felt less full. My friend says the same thing. Just an odd thing I noticed.Honestly, I expected better from this place. My meal costed about $25 in total and I really don't feel like it was worth it. I don't see myself coming back soon. If I do come back, I'd probably come for a burger, wings, and poutine.",3.0
"Not baaaaaaaaad!Me and my large group chose Dinosaur BBQ for a sendoff for a good friend and I found that it's a great place for a group dinner! Reservations were apparently quite easy to make, and for a large group they request participation in the prix fixe. For about $25 you get your choice of sides and meats as well as unlimited non-alcoholic drinks. They reserved a large table for us inside and allowed us to sit even though not everyone in the party was present - huge plus for me and my perpetually tardy buddies. The waitstaff was extremely efficient in refilling our drinks and making sure we had enough food. They were also kind enough to store an ice cream cake we bought for the occasion!The food itself isn't mind blowing but I do believe is of better quality than the Dino in Harlem.

The ribs itself were slightly burnt, though. They did fall off the bone and was very tender on the inside, but the outside was too burnt to eat. The other thing is that, if you share the ribs, the rack will have different bones. One side will have more meat and will probably be drier. That's just part of the deal when you get a full rack anywhere though. Our sides were generously portioned and tasted great. The fries were crispy and not too oily and the mashed potatoes were smooth and flavorful. Mac and cheese were kinda hard after it cooled down and cole slaw was okay. Of course, being the fatass that I am, I had to order the pulled pork slider cause a bunch of reviews said they were really good. It wasn't a bad deal at $4 and the meat was pouring out of the tiny bun. First bite was delicious, but later on it got too meaty and dry for me. But that might be because I was too full at that point.The waiter was good with giving us time to peruse the menu before ordering and refilled our waters promptly. So service is fine here as well.

When our whole party arrived, we in the large dinning room with the bottle chandelier beautifully hanging from the ceiling. Boy and I shared the sweetheart meal, rack of ribs with 4 sides. I think I picked bad sides - mac & cheese, beans with kale, poke beans and chili. The man and cheese was very good; highly recommend and the chili was very meaty; also highly recommend.

We waited a mere five minutes and were seated right away.They didn't have salt potatoes, and I'm pretty certain the draft root beer I drank was indeed Saranac -- even if it wasn't, it was super, duper yummy. I typically go for the pulled pork platters, but that day I wanted a little bit of everything, so I picked the Tres Nino plate.

"A dinosaur in Brooklyn? A dinosaur previously only found in the wilds of upstate New York and in Harlem? Don't be scared, friends. This lovable monster is a great addition to Gowanus/Park Slope, and once you get past the gigantic wait, you'll be so happy you stopped by. While you wait for your table, drop by the bar and get some drinks, courtesy of one of the awesome bartenders...Eamonn is the best! They have a great beer selection and you can build your own tasting flight. If you're not drinking, get the Brooklyn Soda Works root beer. So tasty!I've ordered a combination platter both times I ate at Dinosaur. You can pick 2-3 meats and 2 sides, and they bring you a gigantic plate that'll have you full for days. The ribs are delicious - not too dry, nor overwhelmed by sauce. I also love the pulled pork, especially when you add a little sauce from the selection of bottles on every table. My favorite side is definitely the baked beans, because they're not your run-of-the-mill sloppy beans. They're flavorful and full of little bits of meat and okay, my mouth is watering now just remembering. My friends also loved the Mac and Cheese, and even though my boyfriend teased me for ordering kale at a BBQ place (...only in Brooklyn), the kale and black-eyed peas were awesome too. Get yourself over to Dinosaur. It's really good value for your money, the food is great, and you'll probably run into someone you know there. Unless it's one of your vegetarian friends.",4.0

But that might be because I was too full at that point.The waiter was good with giving us time to peruse the menu before ordering and refilled our waters promptly. So service is fine here as well. Dinosaur BBQ is mostly wood decor, which makes you feel like you are inside a cabin. They keep it clean and cozy, which makes for a great bbq meal. Hopefully they don't burn the ribs next time though.",3.0
Barbecue and Chicken is excellent.  But the service was slow and the side was cold. Who in there right mind serves cold chilli.,2.0

"I was super happy to find out that the famous Dino BBQ from Harlem was in BK! WOOT WOOT!But sad, that I didn't like it as much as I thought.We came here for an early dinner, so it was relatively empty. When our whole party arrived, we in the large dinning room with the bottle chandelier beautifully hanging from the ceiling. Boy and I shared the sweetheart meal, rack of ribs with 4 sides. I think I picked bad sides - mac & cheese, beans with kale, poke beans and chili. The man and cheese was very good; highly recommend and the chili was very meaty; also highly recommend. But the other two were eh. The ribs are okay, it seemed a little tried out from sitting out too long. My fingers were very dirty after eating half the rack, but no wet nap was in sight. Maybe I should stick with brisket next time.",2.0
"Not too bad. The apps are good. Wings and fried green tomatoes are delicious. So I got me some ribs, and a bunch of sides. Also got to try some other stuff as well. The ribs are good, not great. Nice and juicy, with good texture. Truth be told they had a little too much chewy fatty stuff for me. Not the best BBQ in NY but this is definitely worth trying.",3.0
"YESSSS, I don't have to trek to Harlem anymore to enjoy the (Syracuse original) BBQ. Great when I have a sudden hankering for BBQ, not awesome for the waistline.We came on a Sunday at 3:30pm, so kind of an odd time. We waited a mere five minutes and were seated right away.They didn't have salt potatoes, and I'm pretty certain the draft root beer I drank was indeed Saranac -- even if it wasn't, it was super, duper yummy. I typically go for the pulled pork platters, but that day I wanted a little bit of everything, so I picked the Tres Nino plate. Holy crap, I can't believe I've just tried their brisket for the first time, twas amazing. It's a very welcome addition to BK!",4.0
"A dinosaur in Brooklyn? A dinosaur previously only found in the wilds of upstate New York and in Harlem? Don't be scared, friends. This lovable monster is a great addition to Gowanus/Park Slope, and once you get past the gigantic wait, you'll be so happy you stopped by. While you wait for your table, drop by the bar and get some drinks, courtesy of one of the awesome bartenders...Eamonn is the best! They have a great beer selection and you can build your own tasting flight. If you're not drinking, get the Brooklyn Soda Works root beer. So tasty!I've ordered a combination platter both times I ate at Dinosaur. You can pick 2-3 meats and 2 sides, and they bring you a gigantic plate that'll have you full for days. The ribs are delicious - not too dry, nor overwhelmed by sauce. I also love the pulled pork, especially when you add a little sauce from the selection of bottles on every table. My favorite side is definitely the baked beans, because they're not your run-of-the-mill sloppy beans. They're flavorful and full of little bits of meat and okay, my mouth is watering now just remembering. My friends also loved the Mac and Cheese, and even though my boyfriend teased me for ordering kale at a BBQ place (...only in Brooklyn), the kale and black-eyed peas were awesome too. Get yourself over to Dinosaur. It's really good value for your money, the food is great, and you'll probably run into someone you know there. Unless it's one of your vegetarian friends.",4.0
"Great food, busy atmosphere and overall great place to eat! The wait time can be very long depending on time and day. We went on a Friday night with 4 ppl and the wait ended up to be about an hr and a half. I like how their BBQ isn't so overpowering and smoked.",5.0

It'll definitely save a lot of waiting time when you can be eating instead of starving! This location compared to the one in 125th street is a little bit off. The flavor aren't as intense as the one that's located on 125th street. And they do not serve the small fingerling potatoes that I always order in the one in Harlem!

The meals would actually arrive 5 minutes after the sides. We were impressed at the speed. But as we dug into it...the food was lukewarm at best.

"I have never been to a BBQ except for korean ones. I went there on a Saturday and obviously it was packed. Although we arrived early, we were not seated until exactly when our reservation time came up ( The front "" desk "" informed us we had to wait ). After we were lead to our seats, it took exactly 20 minutes for our waiter/waitress to arrive ( We were done choosing our food and I was constantly looking at my cell phone). The person that helped us was very kind and came around frequently to check up on us. Now the food, the RIBS ARE GREAT. They did not stick to the bone at all and was really easy to cut into. We ordered the stack of 12 with four sides for 31 dollars. The cornbread from what I read is made with some honey. I loved it ! ! !

"OMG I have been a Dino BBQ fan since their only city location was Harlem. Yes, I traveled from South Brooklyn all the way uptown to eat some wings & mac and cheese. I recommend the original or honey bbq. They have additional sauces at the table if you need to spice it up.It's cheap, it's flavourful, they have a bunch of different drinks INCLUDING A FROZEN MARGARITA. How many BBQ joints can put that on their resume?The only downside is I don't think they take reservations unless you are a big party and spoken to the manager way before hand. So make sure you're mentally prepared to wait a while on a weekend night.

But we would still have to wait for another table to be open.  So as some of sat down and some of stood next to our table. We noticed that they had no clue where the rest of our party would be sitting and then asked if the rest of our group can be seated in another far table.  Um, why didnt you say asked before.  Then the snotty male manager comes over and asked why we didn't make reservations. And made a point that we didnt wait 2 hours yet as we were told.  As I am writing this review I am reminded of what a jerk the manager was, and minus another star.  I felt bad for the Birthday Girl who dealt with the ...So finally a table behind our table was leaving and we had to ask if our other party can be seated there instead of the table they suggested. Food was only ok and that is where you have your 2 stars.  But cold. Why are your chicken wings cold?   So, we finally finish our food and was wanting our MIA waiter to bring out our cake.  30 minutes later they did.  This place is suppose to cater to large groups.  Family Style!  Please at least have a plan before seating half of the group.  Then making the party feel like it was their fault for choosing this restaurant.  We wouldn't have mind waiting til you had a good plan.   Dammit I like your convenient location.  Get it together.",2.0
"I chose to try this place with couple of my friends for a Sunday lunch and it was one of the best decisions I've made in a long time. Started off with a plate of fried green tomatoes which had a a nice crunch and lots of flavor from the toppings, and a plate of poutine which was the best I have had so far in NYC.

However there is a spice  (spicy paprika) that they use in both the mash and Mac so it tastes like you're eating the same thing.. Kinda strange ?

I wouldn't go out of my way or wait in line for this place..Btw no salt potatoes what kind of dinosaur BBQ is this?  They should add them to the menuWeird side.. Fried rice?

"Overall the food was good. Pretty decent BBQ.  Standard. Nothing to rave about. Tasty but not super special. Waitress was nice and provided good service. She had a lot of tables and managed to keep us happy. We were seated immediately for a party of 5 at 6:30 on Sunday. Not bad. Now, here is the bad part.  Restrooms were filthy.  Really gross. I tend to judge how clean the kitchen is by how clean the bathroom is. There are lots of TVs in the place and they are all set to volume level 11. Everyone wants to see the game but no one wants to hear it INCLUDING the commercials!We asked the waitress, the hostess and eventually the manager to please lower the volume. It was seriously crazy, uncomfortable, dangerously loud. Waitress and hostess were nice and said they would ask. On the way out I asked to speak to the manager. Didn't get his name but he was a dude with huge dreadlocks (kinda cute too) but couldn't manage a smile to save his life. When I informed him about the bathroom he basically shrugged his shoulders. When I asked him about the TV volume he just stared at me. Never said OK, I'm sorry, we will clean that up, we can turn it down. This guy was a real jerk. Basically emotionless and couldn't care less what I was saying. No respect or concern for the customer.I dropped almost $200 on dinner and most likely wouldn't go back. My advice.... Get takeout from Jake's BBQ on Columbia Street. Cheaper, tastier and they are a hell of a lot nicer!",3.0

Now, having tried Delaney (still my favorite), Hometown BBQ, Fette Sau, Fletchers, Mighty Quinn's, and Hill Country, amongst others, we can fairly compare Dino to competitors in this new BBQ reconnaissance context.Overall, they're good, but far from great.What they do well: Wings (all of them are delicious and tender), Fried Green Tomatoes (these other joints don't do much other than sides and mains), and best of all Pork Ribs (I rarely eat pork, especially pork ribs, but I have to say they were excellent).What They don't do well: Cornbread (ehhh, dry, kind of neutral flavored...have you tried Hometown's???!!! WOW!) and Brisket. And given this is what I'm always drawn to at all of the spots named above, I was disappointed. It came out dry, in too thick, not fatty enough, pieces, unfortunately doused in a not great sauce. CAnyhow, if you've been to the Brooklyn Dino you know you'll have to put up with rather slower service and (without a RSVP) insanely long wait times (Friday evening was 1 hour 45 minutes for 4 people). Nevertheless, if you stick to the ribs and wings and make a reservation you will go home happy. This is a 3.5 star establishment with the right choices.",3.0

"I have never been to a BBQ except for korean ones. I went there on a Saturday and obviously it was packed. Although we arrived early, we were not seated until exactly when our reservation time came up ( The front "" desk "" informed us we had to wait ). After we were lead to our seats, it took exactly 20 minutes for our waiter/waitress to arrive ( We were done choosing our food and I was constantly looking at my cell phone). The person that helped us was very kind and came around frequently to check up on us. Now the food, the RIBS ARE GREAT. They did not stick to the bone at all and was really easy to cut into. We ordered the stack of 12 with four sides for 31 dollars. The cornbread from what I read is made with some honey. I loved it ! ! ! The sides we got were mac n cheese, bbq rice, fries, and I already forgot about the last one. All the sides were okay at best. It is not their specialty after all.",4.0
"OMG I have been a Dino BBQ fan since their only city location was Harlem. Yes, I traveled from South Brooklyn all the way uptown to eat some wings & mac and cheese. I recommend the original or honey bbq. They have additional sauces at the table if you need to spice it up.It's cheap, it's flavourful, they have a bunch of different drinks INCLUDING A FROZEN MARGARITA. How many BBQ joints can put that on their resume?The only downside is I don't think they take reservations unless you are a big party and spoken to the manager way before hand. So make sure you're mentally prepared to wait a while on a weekend night. It's right by the train and the Union St location is super convenient (15 min walk from Barclays center).To read more, I wrote a full review of them on my Foodie Friday section on my blog: goldingirl.com/bon-apeti…",5.0
"Location in Harlem is so much better.  This location needs help. Hurry!We tried to make reservations for 16 but was told they were booked.  So we decided to go early knowing we would have to probably wait 2 hours.  Which we were fine with and which is exactly what they said when we arrive.An hour and 45 minutes into waiting they said they had a table for most of us. But we would still have to wait for another table to be open.  So as some of sat down and some of stood next to our table. We noticed that they had no clue where the rest of our party would be sitting and then asked if the rest of our group can be seated in another far table.  Um, why didnt you say asked before.  Then the snotty male manager comes over and asked why we didn't make reservations. And made a point that we didnt wait 2 hours yet as we were told.  As I am writing this review I am reminded of what a jerk the manager was, and minus another star.  I felt bad for the Birthday Girl who dealt with the ...So finally a table behind our table was leaving and we had to ask if our other party can be seated there instead of the table they suggested. Food was only ok and that is where you have your 2 stars.  But cold. Why are your chicken wings cold?   So, we finally finish our food and was wanting our MIA waiter to bring out our cake.  30 minutes later they did.  This place is suppose to cater to large groups.  Family Style!  Please at least have a plan before seating half of the group.  Then making the party feel like it was their fault for choosing this restaurant.  We wouldn't have mind waiting til you had a good plan.   Dammit I like your convenient location.  Get it together.",2.0
"I chose to try this place with couple of my friends for a Sunday lunch and it was one of the best decisions I've made in a long time. Started off with a plate of fried green tomatoes which had a a nice crunch and lots of flavor from the toppings, and a plate of poutine which was the best I have had so far in NYC. Ordered the House special which was also great, but the star of my entree was definitely the potato salad. The plate itself didn't look that big but it was definitely filling. Will definitely go back!",5.0
"Ummm.... I was really hoping it would be better. I went to the harlem location many years ago, and it was much better. The brisket was nothing to write home about. The ribs were pretty good. The French fries were fresh, the Mac and cheese was good and the mashed potatoes. However there is a spice  (spicy paprika) that they use in both the mash and Mac so it tastes like you're eating the same thing.. Kinda strange ? Overall I'd say if you were really in the mood for BBQ and your in the hood then go. I wouldn't go out of my way or wait in line for this place..Btw no salt potatoes what kind of dinosaur BBQ is this?  They should add them to the menuWeird side.. Fried rice? It was pretty good but weird to see on the menu, the only reason we got to try it is bc they brought it out to us my mistake.",3.0
"Overall the food was good. Pretty decent BBQ.  Standard. Nothing to rave about. Tasty but not super special. Waitress was nice and provided good service. She had a lot of tables and managed to keep us happy. We were seated immediately for a party of 5 at 6:30 on Sunday. Not bad. Now, here is the bad part.  Restrooms were filthy.  Really gross. I tend to judge how clean the kitchen is by how clean the bathroom is. There are lots of TVs in the place and they are all set to volume level 11. Everyone wants to see the game but no one wants to hear it INCLUDING the commercials!We asked the waitress, the hostess and eventually the manager to please lower the volume. It was seriously crazy, uncomfortable, dangerously loud. Waitress and hostess were nice and said they would ask. On the way out I asked to speak to the manager. Didn't get his name but he was a dude with huge dreadlocks (kinda cute too) but couldn't manage a smile to save his life. When I informed him about the bathroom he basically shrugged his shoulders. When I asked him about the TV volume he just stared at me. Never said OK, I'm sorry, we will clean that up, we can turn it down. This guy was a real jerk. Basically emotionless and couldn't care less what I was saying. No respect or concern for the customer.I dropped almost $200 on dinner and most likely wouldn't go back. My advice.... Get takeout from Jake's BBQ on Columbia Street. Cheaper, tastier and they are a hell of a lot nicer!",3.0

"So my entire family and I came to Dinosaur BBQ because we heard raving reviews about the Harlem location. It was my cousin's birthday and we were all in an upbeat mood. However, our waitress, M*n*que (Yelp prohibits members from writing names), was not. Our party arrived in in 2 groups and never once did she introduce herself to us. She often disappeared for long periods of time where several people in our party stood up and looked all around the restaurant for her but to no avail. When we finally got our food, the waitress messed up the orders for 3 people in our party delaying them from fully enjoying their meals. It is also worth mentioning that the only thing memorable about the food was that it was cold and it took over an hour to come out - the same time it took for us to get our drinks. Then, when someone in our party complained that they did not like the chicken because it was dry and asked for a different dish the waitress snapped and said, ""the kitchen is closed"". That was the official moment that I was over this place. Why wasn't our party ever greeted properly by the waitress? Why weren't we told that the kitchen was closing prior to the kitchen closing? We weren't even able to order a dessert and sing happy birthday to my cousin because she didn't inform us that the kitchen was closing. It wasn't until I vocalized these issues that the waitress ran to the back to get the ""kitchen manager"" who said, ""we don't inform guest that the kitchen is closing. We close at 11pm."" After all of this, a busboy comes over to our table to tell us that his coworkers are racist and we were well in our right to complain because they treat minority customers poorly at this particular restaurant.  NEVERRRRRRRRR WILL I EVER GO BACK TO THIS PLACE EVER AGAIN.",1.0

The brisket alone didn't have much taste. The pickled pepper and barbeque sauce added some flavor to eat bite. The turkey neck greens had a vinegar flavor. I was happy to see a good amount of turkey neck meat in this side.The black eye peas with kale tasted flat. I picked this cuz of the kale. The cornbread is a tiny muffin. It tasted okay.I didn't enjoy eating this platter. Since I was hungry, I cleared my plate.

"If you are looking for delectable meats, moist poultry, succulent sides, and microbrewed excellence, look no further. Dino BBQ has it all.

The wings here are absolutely tremendous. They are (as noted above) MOIST and JUICY, voluptuous and flat out meat-tastic. I would be completely satisfied going here and order 18 wings for myself and calling it a night. Except I wouldn't because I would be cheating myself out of the BEST PULLED PORK AND BRISKET AND SIDES YOU CAN GET.  Great place to go and meat up with friends and family, or take that special someone.

"If Dino BBQ was in Boston - I would give it 5 Stars.  There is simply no BBQ up here that compares to a place like this.  But, I have to rate it on context - Brooklyn is loaded with great restaurants thus I'll respectfully do 4 Stars.That being said, the food is a total knockout in my humble opinion.   The brisket melted in my mouth with subtle smokey undertones.  I had a dollop of their house sauce, which was great - but I barely needed to touch it.  Everything I had was exceptional - from black-eyes peas (hint of Kale), complex-flavored pork beans, home-made cornbread...  The kids dishes were delicious too (and only $6).  I've never seen my 8 year old son devour chicken wings so voraciously.  The atmosphere was lively and fun - again, nothing that you would get in most cities.  Soaring ceilings, retro neon signs, a homemade ""bottle chandelier""...  We sat outside and had a front row seat on all kinds of evening happenings - kids, dogs, conga drums...  Great beer list, too.Go - you'll be happy.",4.0

If u didn't want to sit anyone you could have just said we can't take anymore seating instead making up all these stories.OH and they said they would text us when the table was ready obviously they never sat anyone down as we left went to another restaurant and still got no text whatever this place is extremely,extremely overrated",1.0

It was always super packed, and it took hours to get a table, with good reason this place has the best Bar-B-Que i've ever tasted. I recently came back to Dino BBQ but this time I visited their new location in Gawanus and the food was the so smoky,  so flavored, so perfect!I ordered the BBQ brisket chopped melt with the side order of Mac and Cheese, and my friend ordered the BBQ brisket BBS. Both orders were delicious. We immediately fell in love with the Mac and Cheese, it was cream, cheesy, and of course a bit spicy! It reminded us of our favorite Mac and Cheese, and we considered this one a better candidate. New favorite Mac and Cheese!The BBQ brisket chopped melt tasted great, I love the combination of the sweet with the smokey brisket, the meet was perfectly tender. The blue cheese on the BBS was amazing, it gave it a different flavor but was still a perfect fit for the dish. I can't explain how great these tasty sandwiches feel on your taste buds!Going back to union to avoid the long line on 125th even though i live closer to that one! This place deserves more then 5 stars :)",5.0

What's cool is that they send you a text when your table is about to be ready or you can download the app. The service started off great the waiter took our orders quick and answered our questions. Never saw him again til I was ready to pay and leave he left the check with us for over 20 mins, he claimed that he will come back but never saw him again. Me and my friend got pretty annoyed I asked another waiter if we could pay and leave.Anywho....Me and my friend ordered The sweetheart (we just wanted to get it we're bestfriends lol)the swag sampler and pulled pork fries. The sweetheart came with a rack of ribs which were AMAZINGGGGG ! It was juicy and delicious not dry at all me and my friend loved it as for the sides we weren't too crazy about it but we love the corn bread ! The Swag sampler meh , we weren't crazy about it either I sorta liked the fried green tomatoes the eggs were MEH didn't like it the wings were good. The pulled pork fries were delicious ! Make sure you eat it hot or it doesn't taste food cold. We ended up having a lot of left overs yeah our head was bigger than our stomaches as always.That's all for now will definitely come back again :) hopefully better service !",3.0
"Last night I had a great experience! The food was delicious and there was live blues music (Saturday night).

"I'm not really into BBQ. I was out voted. We blessed this place with our presence on a Saturday night. 3 of us Walked in & was immediately seated. Our waitress was cute & extremely polite. I had the Blackened Catfish with Mac & Cheese. It was ok. I didn't like the greens underneath the Catfish. The cornbread was way too hard. If you're a BBQ lover, this is the place. My friends devoured their Brisket & Chicken.",3.0

"BEST BAR-B-QUE IN NEW YORK CITY! I use to go to their one 125th street location constantly when I was a kid. It was always super packed, and it took hours to get a table, with good reason this place has the best Bar-B-Que i've ever tasted. I recently came back to Dino BBQ but this time I visited their new location in Gawanus and the food was the so smoky,  so flavored, so perfect!I ordered the BBQ brisket chopped melt with the side order of Mac and Cheese, and my friend ordered the BBQ brisket BBS. Both orders were delicious. We immediately fell in love with the Mac and Cheese, it was cream, cheesy, and of course a bit spicy! It reminded us of our favorite Mac and Cheese, and we considered this one a better candidate. New favorite Mac and Cheese!The BBQ brisket chopped melt tasted great, I love the combination of the sweet with the smokey brisket, the meet was perfectly tender. The blue cheese on the BBS was amazing, it gave it a different flavor but was still a perfect fit for the dish. I can't explain how great these tasty sandwiches feel on your taste buds!Going back to union to avoid the long line on 125th even though i live closer to that one! This place deserves more then 5 stars :)",5.0

"This is my 2nd time ordering take out from dinosaur. The first time they screwed up my order and didn't give me the shrimp.

Smothered in gravy, cheese and one of the best pulled pork I've ever tasted. The smokiness and true flavor of the pork was what made the pulled pork so good, it wasn't masked by some barbecue sauce. I could have eaten the pulled pork plain and it would have been amazing.The pork ribs were so moist and flavorful, I would definitely order a rack of these for myself because I could eat these forever. The shrimp was bold and flavorful--definitely well done, as was the brisket. My sides--mashed potatoes, Mac & cheese, and corn bread--tasted pretty standard, and the bread was a little dry.

I don't think I've ever met anyone this happy in LIFE. He would literally skip to our table whenever he checked on us. Always smiling and just a pleasant person. It was sort of the cherry on the top because while I can appreciate good food, I get turned off the moment the service is bad. I've gone once more since and we asked if Teddy was working (so that he can wait on us). Great service (from Teddy, at least). Really good food. Solid beer selection.

"You guys. I think I'm in love with  a dinosaur. We came in on a rather chilly Wednesday night. There was no wait and we got seated right away. Now I am no expert on BBQ, but I am an expert eater and BBQ is one of my faves. To start off, one friend had the swag sampler and said he thought it was delish. I tried a really small piece of the fried green tomato and it was definitely flavorful and yummy. I ordered the tres ninos (small samplings of brisket, pulled pork, and ribs) with mac n cheese and Harlem potato salad. Let's start with my favorite, the Brisket- SO flavorful. I love meats that stand alone w/o having to add any additional things to it and the brisket definitely delivered. The ribs were my next favorite. Juicy, fatty....yum. The pulled pork was just meh to me. I felt it was bland and definitely was nothing to write home about. Now for the sides. I wasn't thrilled. They are more or less what you'd expect. The potato salad felt like it was something you could get at a grocery store. Not that there's  anything wrong with that, just not breath taking. The mac n cheese was pretty good, though it seemed rather heavy. I felt more like I was eating butter macaroni than cheesy macaroni. FInally, we got some chicken wangs to go to help us get through the winter storm thats outside right now, and my goodness. These wings are unbelievable. They're flavored really well, The meat is really juicy. They come with a blue cheese dressing but they don't even need it. To summarize: Brisket- you MUST try this. Ribs- also good. Pulled pork- meh. Wings- Try now or take home and try later. Sides- also meh. Dinosaur BBQ definitely delivers  as far as BBQ is concerned.",5.0

A lot of the seats were occupied, butcit certainly wasn't packed, nor was there a waiting list. While the links had a decent taste, I bit into a bone chip (or something hard as a bone chip) on my first bite. The deviled eggs pretty much tasted like cooked yolk whipped with a lot of mustard. The cole slaw was the best item out of the bunch, but nothing to do cartwheels over. The bbq sauce (in side cups) also have a heavy mustard taste.

I usually just get all sides and dine on that. My favorite sides are the Mac & Cheese (absolutely divine), the original Fried Green Tomatoes and the deviled eggs. Then I wash it down with an awesome drink called Donkey Punch. That drink puts me in a tizzy every time and I love it! And I love that they serve the drink in Mason Jars. Every time I have went here, the service has been really good. No complaints!The reason that it doesn't receive 5 stars is probably because I admit the food can be a little hotter when it's served to me.

"Dino BBQ's arrival to the Gowanus was long awaited and did not disappoint.  The space is huge, and yet there still seems to be a nightly wait.  The menu is quite extensive, and you can stick with the standards of pulled pork, chicken, ribs, brisket or try something different like their burgers or sandwiches... actually on second thought, stick to the standards... that's why you came here.  Add a few wings, fried green tomatoes, and you are all set.  The combos are a really good deal.The service is brisk and well-coordinated.  Take out window is really great if you live nearby and want to take home some cue.  Totally meatastic!",4.0
"The full rack of ribs for two is an incredible deal. You get four sides and a full rack of ribs for $30.00. That was the equivalent of two dinners and two lunches the next day. The ribs are the main attraction. The meat is tender with good char and strong smokey flavor, the BBQ sauce is tasty and not sweet. It has too much celery seed in it, but you can't have everything. The sides were a mixed bag. The celebrated mac&cheese lived up to its reputation: tender elbow macaroni, strong well-balanced dairy flavor, and a noticeable cajun spice kick.

"Dinosaur BBQ is pretty bad.  That people wait in line for hours in Harlem to eat this muck is mind blowing to me if it's anything like the Gowanus experience. I've had BBQ a handful of times in the South.  I've had the inferior, but sometimes tasty version at silly hip places in Brooklyn numerous times.  I've had friends from North Carolina feed me delicious, vinegar based pulled pork and I'll still go down to the Ice House in Red Hook for those great $2 pulled pork sliders every now and again.  Ok, I haven't eaten BBQ at a gas station in Kansas or had brisket from a smoker the size of a public park in Texas, but I have some idea of what the stuff is supposed to taste like and it's not supposed to taste like this shit.Dry, overcooked, tasteless meat which you have the option of smothering in some pretty gross, saccharine house sauces.  Sides were bad too; inferior collared greens and beans, although the middling mac n cheese was probably the best thing about the meal not including the can of Genesee (3rd choice after being told they were out of the first two).A note on service, I'm all for moving into the 21st century, but it's sort of frustrating and silly to be told that there's no tables open and that you probably need to wait 20 minutes, only to receive a text from a machine telling you your table is ready 45 seconds after leaving.",2.0
"This review is based purely on customer service.  Made a Yelp account since I couldn't get through to talk to management and didn't know what else to do.  Just moved to the area and my neighbor recommended trying this place out.

Thought I had bad timing or they accidentally forgot about me so just called back and once again, ""Dino, please hold."" Put back on hold another five minutes before I hung up. So disappointed this happened--Pork Slope here I come.",1.0
"I've dined in previously before and loved the experience. The fried tomatoes were made just right, not too greasy and were crunchy yet tender on the inside.  The wings flavored in Chipotle BBQ sauce were also done well and over all the appetizers as a whole were very good.  I would recommend getting the sampler for two for the indecisive folks out there. However on a darker note, I would recommend never buying the Living Social deal for this place.  While the food is good, they force you to make the order two days in advance.  You can not redeem on the spot even though you had already paid in full for the voucher.  This is extremely inconvenient and this policy is strictly enforced even on less busy days such as a Monday.  I'd recommend either dining in or choosing someplace else for your takeout desires.",3.0
"Wow that's some good BBQ!  For around $16, I got 2 meat selections, 2 sides, and a cornbread.  Definitely perfect place to go when you are starving.  The ribs and pulled pork were well seasoned, as well as mac and cheese and baked beans.  The delicious cornbread muffin added a little extra.  I will definitely be taking my brother and dad here - for sports watching too.",5.0

"When I lived all the way uptown, I would go to the uptown location fairly frequently, and then when I moved all the way downtown it became too much of a trek. So I had to do without for awhile, otherwise make an extremely long journey, which of course I did do once or twice. And then this location opened, and I praised the heavens. Even though Gowanus isn't exactly convenient, and Dinosaur isn't exactly the world's greatest, it's always worth the commute and it's always worth the calories. I really like their food. The meats are tender, beers are cheap, sauces are delicious, and waitstaff are very friendly.",4.0
"Dino BBQ's arrival to the Gowanus was long awaited and did not disappoint.  The space is huge, and yet there still seems to be a nightly wait.  The menu is quite extensive, and you can stick with the standards of pulled pork, chicken, ribs, brisket or try something different like their burgers or sandwiches... actually on second thought, stick to the standards... that's why you came here.  Add a few wings, fried green tomatoes, and you are all set.  The combos are a really good deal.The service is brisk and well-coordinated.  Take out window is really great if you live nearby and want to take home some cue.  Totally meatastic!",4.0
"The full rack of ribs for two is an incredible deal. You get four sides and a full rack of ribs for $30.00. That was the equivalent of two dinners and two lunches the next day. The ribs are the main attraction. The meat is tender with good char and strong smokey flavor, the BBQ sauce is tasty and not sweet. It has too much celery seed in it, but you can't have everything. The sides were a mixed bag. The celebrated mac&cheese lived up to its reputation: tender elbow macaroni, strong well-balanced dairy flavor, and a noticeable cajun spice kick. The turkey neck greens and the black-eyed peas tasted off. The black-eyed peas tasted a little soapy. The coleslaw was a mix of white and red cabbage in a vinegary mayo dressing. It was okay.",3.0

Average BBQ in a well design place. Lots of  great menu items but when it comes to BBQ goodness it's good but not great. The smoke intensity is low and seasoning is not too solid.

"I've been to Dino BBQ in Syracuse and Harlem and am so thankful that they added a location in Brooklyn. I've been back to this location at least a dozen times in the last two years. Even ordered a bunch of food off their catering menu for a courtyard party. Anyone that comes to visit my family in Brooklyn gets a trip to Dino. The ribs are fantastic and the sweetheart deal is a bargain! Sides are plentiful and tasty. Great for parties, kids, even vegetarians can leave satisfied... the fried green tomatoes are fantastic. Discovered one of my favorite beers at this spot too... the Kentucky Bourbon Barrel Ale. So good!! The prices are very reasonable for a NYC BBQ joint.

"Thought that my socks would be blown off in this restaurant. There were so many reviews saying that this was a MUST go to restaurant. I ordered a 3/4 rack of ribs and the mac and cheese and mashed potatoes sides. I would say that the meal was pretty good, but it's certainly not worth the 1 hour and 45 minute wait that we had to endure. The ribs don't do well at all without the BBQ sauce that they have on the table. And even then, that BBQ sauce is a little too tangy for what I'd expect. So unless you are a DIE HARD bbq fan - don't expect so much out of this.",3.0
"Made a reservation online, and was seated promptly even though we got there little bit early. Quickly scanned the menu but my wife and I already knew what we were going to get.

"BBQ yum! I feel like I'm down south when I step inside Dino BBQ, where I'm told brisket and ribs are done right. So if you can't manage to book a quick flight to Texas, this joint will suffice.Great beers on tap. Local Brooklyn brews among others. The Kentucky Bourbon Barrel Ale was my favorite though. You can taste the Bourbon barrel aged in the ale. Order up, my first go around I tried the 1/2 rack of ribs with two sides of mashed potatoes & gravy and mac n cheese. The ribs crumbled as expected, and the bbq sauce was nice and tangy. Solid mashed potatoes, and the mac n cheese tasted awfully similar to the one at Pork Slope (that's a good thing). My next time here I tried the Breakfast All Day. It wasn't so much steak and eggs as it was brisket and eggs. Threw me off on the first bite, but sunnyside eggs? Yes please. I intend to try the Dino poutine when I'm back, or as we call it in Jersey, Disco Fries (on steriods).  I will frequent this place given the location to Brooklyn Boulders.

When I worked in food service if someone was in the weeds, you jumped in and helped. Our actual meal was ANOTHER 45 min after our appetizer.  The waiter, who did seem apologetic, told us that it was my sandwich that was holding everything up. A. Sandwich. Bread. With meat on it. The height of complicated cuisine. I'm a former upstate girl. My friends and I tour dinosaur bbqs like its a pilgrimage.

The chicken was good as well and so was the Mac and cheese. I like my cole slaw a bit on the sweeter side so it wasn't really to my liking.

"Great BBQ for sure. Our friends from the north up in Syracuse started this spot and boy am I glad that it made its way to Brooklyn. The spot is huge and has a bunch of TVs so I will be going to check out a game there soon enough. On to the food. For starters I had the chicken wings and the poutine. The wings were awesome. I had the garlic flavor which was perfect spice mixed with some heat. The poutine was the best thing we had the whole meal. I couldn't stop shoveling it into my mouth haha. For those who don't know about poutine I suggest you try it ASAP. It's a combo of French fries, meat, gravy, and cheese. Unbelievable. For the main menu I had a combination platter which included ribs, brisket, and the hot links. All were really good but the best was the ribs. Very juicy and tender with awesome flavor. For sides I had cornbread, chili, and the baked beans. The bakes beans were really good. However I was not impressed with the cornbread or the chili. I've had better from other BBQ spots.

"After completing the 2014 Brooklyn Half-Marathon, ten of my friends and I went to Dinosaur BBQ after hearing rave reviews about the restaurant for a long time. The hostess told us she put us on the list under the name ""Kim"" and that it would be a 30 minute wait. We asked her if we could sit at the bar until our table was ready which she verbally confirmed. After approximately 45 minutes we inquired about the status of our table after seeing large parties come into the restaurant being seated before us. The hostess claimed she thought we had left which is why she was seating other parties before us. Once again, this was after we communicated that we would be at the bar waiting until our table was ready. We also did not receive a text message nor phone call as we were promised regarding the status of our table, which would have been the logical step to take before removing a party of 11 people from the waiting list.The hostess then said she would place us at the top of the list. Nearly an hour after we first entered the restaurant we were still not seated and we again inquired about our table's status. The hostess then provided an entirely different excuse by saying she had confused us with another party of 11 also under the name Kim that had already been seated. The excuse of there being another party with coincidentally the exact same number of people under the exact name as justification for what was clearly an error of the hostess was insulting and almost laughable.At no point did we receive an apology for what were clearly mistakes of the hostess. Our inquiries on the status of our table were answered with lies and patronizing tones. The biggest insult came when the hostess responded to our last inquiry with the phrase ""no worries"" as if she was brushing off an apology (for an error she made) and as if it was our fault that they were repeatedly giving our table away. My entire party walked out of the restaurant after finishing our drinks at the bar without receiving an apology during the entire hour we were there. It was incredibly frustrating to essentially be ignored and lied to while witnessing other large parties being seated before you repeatedly. Had the staff offered us an apology and made significant attempts to rectify the situation after they messed up, there would have been a possibility of us choosing to stay there to eat. But ultimately we did not want to spend good money on an establishment that treated us in such an unprofessional manner despite the popularity of the restaurant. Someone from my group submitted a feedback form through their website describing our experience. The PR manager responded to apologize for what happened to us and said he would forward our feedback to the managers of the restaurant. We are currently waiting for their response and I will update this review once they provide one but as it stands right now, I will not be returning to Dinosaur BBQ.--------------------------------------**Update 6/30/2014**Someone from Dinosaur BBQ's PR team reached out to the other member in my group who submitted the feedback form. After apologizing for our unpleasant experience, he/she asked us what they could do to rectify the situation. We asked if our party could receive a meal and round of drinks on the house, and in return were offered a $75.00 credit instead. Once again, there were 11 people in my party. $75.00 dispersed among us comes down to an amount less than minimum wage per person. Weeks later this was the best offer they put on the table after we were essentially ignored while other large parties were seated before us repeatedly.I remain disappointed with my experience at this establishment and was even more so after receiving this paltry offer to make amends by this affluent restaurant. I will never recommend this restaurant to my friends, nor will I be returning myself.",1.0
"Honestly it saddens me to give just three stars for such a stellar business but it didnt taste as good as the location Harlem. The space itself is large & immaculate, with very friendly hosts/waiters and lots of management to supervise that. Lots of TV's to watch sports and a large bar area as well. I was disappointed in the ribs. I remember them being much larger & juicier in Harlem. I also remember the sides being amazing...here they were just plain sides. The wings of course were delicious but still not as juicy. I had the shrimp too which was good. The beef brisket & pulled pork seemed flavorless & dry. I was really let down...I didnt even finish my food!With that said, I still would be coming back cause its definetly the best bbq in my part of brooklyn.",3.0
"Big fan of the one in Harlem so had to give this one a try.  Awesome BBQ, was not disappointed, same menu for the most part but they do not have hush puppies.  Not a huge deal.  The fried green tomatoes and deviled eggs were excellent as always.  Between 4 people we got the sweetheart deal for two, which is a full rack with four sides, and the 3 piece combo, pulled pork, brisket and smoked sausage.  Everything was excellent, brisket and pulled pork were top notch, the smoked sausage was a pleasant surprise and the ribs were great.  Regarding the beer menu, they have a beer on tap that I used to have a friend ship to me as I could not get it in New York - Kentucky Bourbon Barrel ale; very smooth with a nice bourbon finish.  Highly recommend, be prepared to wait but they will text you when your table is ready and there are plenty of bars in the area where you can soak till they text.",5.0

Everyone here is so friendly and the bartender Johnny is funny.They have a very large variety of Beer!Must try Beef Brisket and Wings - I ordered them dry and it was amazing.I love how it looks inside - very spacious. I will be back to try everything on the menu.*The bathrooms here have so much space in each stall and extra hooks for bag and coat. I love this place already.,5.0

"WOW WOW WOW!!!!  Definitely as good as it gets!!! I am soooooo happy Dinosaur opened up in Brooklyn because it will now be my go to BBQ place.  The food was incredibly and the beer.... totally deliciousYes, its super busy but do yourself a favor and make a reservation.  My husband talks about the Bourbon beer on a daily basis! As for the BBQ, the combination platters are a steal. A TON of food and enough for 2 people to share.  We loved everything from the Ribs to the chicken and don't forget to try the sausage.  We also had the wings with garlic sauce which were good but the fried green tomatoes were better. You can't go wrong here but expect to eat ALOT of meat. I can't WAIT to go back.",5.0
"After completing the 2014 Brooklyn Half-Marathon, ten of my friends and I went to Dinosaur BBQ after hearing rave reviews about the restaurant for a long time. The hostess told us she put us on the list under the name ""Kim"" and that it would be a 30 minute wait. We asked her if we could sit at the bar until our table was ready which she verbally confirmed. After approximately 45 minutes we inquired about the status of our table after seeing large parties come into the restaurant being seated before us. The hostess claimed she thought we had left which is why she was seating other parties before us. Once again, this was after we communicated that we would be at the bar waiting until our table was ready. We also did not receive a text message nor phone call as we were promised regarding the status of our table, which would have been the logical step to take before removing a party of 11 people from the waiting list.The hostess then said she would place us at the top of the list. Nearly an hour after we first entered the restaurant we were still not seated and we again inquired about our table's status. The hostess then provided an entirely different excuse by saying she had confused us with another party of 11 also under the name Kim that had already been seated. The excuse of there being another party with coincidentally the exact same number of people under the exact name as justification for what was clearly an error of the hostess was insulting and almost laughable.At no point did we receive an apology for what were clearly mistakes of the hostess. Our inquiries on the status of our table were answered with lies and patronizing tones. The biggest insult came when the hostess responded to our last inquiry with the phrase ""no worries"" as if she was brushing off an apology (for an error she made) and as if it was our fault that they were repeatedly giving our table away. My entire party walked out of the restaurant after finishing our drinks at the bar without receiving an apology during the entire hour we were there. It was incredibly frustrating to essentially be ignored and lied to while witnessing other large parties being seated before you repeatedly. Had the staff offered us an apology and made significant attempts to rectify the situation after they messed up, there would have been a possibility of us choosing to stay there to eat. But ultimately we did not want to spend good money on an establishment that treated us in such an unprofessional manner despite the popularity of the restaurant. Someone from my group submitted a feedback form through their website describing our experience. The PR manager responded to apologize for what happened to us and said he would forward our feedback to the managers of the restaurant. We are currently waiting for their response and I will update this review once they provide one but as it stands right now, I will not be returning to Dinosaur BBQ.--------------------------------------**Update 6/30/2014**Someone from Dinosaur BBQ's PR team reached out to the other member in my group who submitted the feedback form. After apologizing for our unpleasant experience, he/she asked us what they could do to rectify the situation. We asked if our party could receive a meal and round of drinks on the house, and in return were offered a $75.00 credit instead. Once again, there were 11 people in my party. $75.00 dispersed among us comes down to an amount less than minimum wage per person. Weeks later this was the best offer they put on the table after we were essentially ignored while other large parties were seated before us repeatedly.I remain disappointed with my experience at this establishment and was even more so after receiving this paltry offer to make amends by this affluent restaurant. I will never recommend this restaurant to my friends, nor will I be returning myself.",1.0
"Honestly it saddens me to give just three stars for such a stellar business but it didnt taste as good as the location Harlem. The space itself is large & immaculate, with very friendly hosts/waiters and lots of management to supervise that. Lots of TV's to watch sports and a large bar area as well. I was disappointed in the ribs. I remember them being much larger & juicier in Harlem. I also remember the sides being amazing...here they were just plain sides. The wings of course were delicious but still not as juicy. I had the shrimp too which was good. The beef brisket & pulled pork seemed flavorless & dry. I was really let down...I didnt even finish my food!With that said, I still would be coming back cause its definetly the best bbq in my part of brooklyn.",3.0
"Big fan of the one in Harlem so had to give this one a try.  Awesome BBQ, was not disappointed, same menu for the most part but they do not have hush puppies.  Not a huge deal.  The fried green tomatoes and deviled eggs were excellent as always.  Between 4 people we got the sweetheart deal for two, which is a full rack with four sides, and the 3 piece combo, pulled pork, brisket and smoked sausage.  Everything was excellent, brisket and pulled pork were top notch, the smoked sausage was a pleasant surprise and the ribs were great.  Regarding the beer menu, they have a beer on tap that I used to have a friend ship to me as I could not get it in New York - Kentucky Bourbon Barrel ale; very smooth with a nice bourbon finish.  Highly recommend, be prepared to wait but they will text you when your table is ready and there are plenty of bars in the area where you can soak till they text.",5.0
"I came with 3 friends for dinner on a Friday night. It was packed! There were plenty of parties waiting for a table. Luckily, my friend lives a block from the restaurant so on her way home from work, she put her name down and gave a phone number for the hostess to call when our table was ready. She went home to wait and received a text 45 minutes later. The rest of us showed up 15 minutes after my friend got the text. They held our table until we all arrived. That was surprising but a good thing. I was also surprised to find that parking was not hard to find in the area.We ordered the 13 of the jumbo bbq chicken wings as an appetizer to share. Half were honey bbq and half were garlic chipotle. YUM! We all ordered the 2 item combinations entree. I had 1/4 chicken and bbq brisket with cornbread, mashed potatoes with gravy and crispy cole slaw. I had heard the bricket was melt-in-your-mouth goodness but I was disappointed. The brisket was too lean. I didn't enjoy it much. The 1/4 chicken, however, was much better than I expected. It wasn't dry and seasoned very well. The mashed potatoes was also really good. The cole slaw tasted fresh. The cornbread was not bad, just a tad stiff for my liking. To drink, I ordered and Arnold Palmer. I thought it was a tad on the sweet side but I liked it nonetheless.I still prefer Hill Country for my BBQ hankerings, but I would come back if my friends were putting together a gathering.",3.0

"I went here for the first time Saturday Sept. 7th, 2013.  There were five of us for a birthday lunch :)  We ordered a bucket of Bud Light and the Sausage and cheese crackers to start.  We loved them but glad there were 5 of us because we all wanted to share room for BBQ!  I ordered the original pulled pork BBq sandwich with mac and cheese as side.  They were both great and I especially loved how the mac and cheese was peppery like the kind you get at a Church picnic :) One of the best things about our dining experience was out waitress who was fittingly named Charisma!  She ROCKED!!

"AHHH, I have literally waited years for Dinosaur BBQ to make it's way down to Brooklyn (not that the plan was always there, but...I was secretly wishing it to be true, and someone read my mind).  I've frequented their Rochester location on many occasions while in college, but have always been too lazy to make my way to Harlem.The space is large and good for groups, but I imagine the wait can get quite long at nights. They have a full bar area (great to stop in for a brewski, some ribs, and watch the game on the big screens).

"Not once but twice Dinosaur BBQ was horrible to me. The first time I went the wait was 45 minutes for our party of 5 which I expected, so that was no problem. The problem was when we were seated. I had a waitress who was frustrated with my aunt and uncle who didn't know what to eat and wanted explanations of certain things on the menu and huffed and puffed when she had to come back to the table numerous times. She also failed to explain certain things such as that they can warm up the boil and peel shrimp from the combination menu so that sucked. Otherwise food was amazing and the donkey punch was just YES!2nd time I went was yesterday and it was early around 7 so I understood the wait time of an hour (so I thought). I put my name down with a host named Peter and got the text response and went to sit outside under the heated light (which was awesome). So an hour and 20 minutes pass (it's 8:30 got there for 7:10) and they don't call my name and my phone doesn't go off. So my friend gets up to go and see how long the wait is and they couldn't even find my name and phone number which was ridiculous. I received the standard Dino BBQ text but nothing. What makes it worse is they didn't even have me in the system and they said a party of 2 could have sat down 30 minutes ago. So we were just waiting to wait. The host staff apologized and we were seated 10 minutes later. Horribleeeeeeee.The only thing that really saves this place is the food and the drinks. The wings were so yummy. The pulled pork and ribs are to die for and lets not get started on how epic the Mac and cheese is! I tried the kale and black eyed peas which is now on my must have list when I go. The donkey punch makes you feel has if you're on a nice beautiful Caribbean island, it's THAT tasty. Perfect blend of rum it's just Yes! This time we had Josh as our waiter and he was great, attentive, and hilarious. I'd sit with him as my waiter each time.Next time I know to reserve my spot 2 hours in advance with the Buzztable app before even stepping foot there",2.0
"Here's the short and simple: 1. Food is Good.2. Food is expensive.3. Beer selection is ... OK. Dinosaur BBQ is frequently touted as being the best of the best when I talk to fellow cooks in the city, and to be honest I might be inclined to agree on a few of their items (specifically the FRIED GREEN TOMATOES and DEVILED EGGS are some of the best I've had) - but other elements aren't so good - the Buffalo Wings are at best average and ... kind of forgettable, which is a shame because I do love me some wings. The Pork BBQ is tasty, but I've had better - but I will give credit where credit is due as so many places in this city seem to be afraid of putting pork on the menu. I was severely disappointed by the Beef Brisket - the portion was exceptionally tiny, and the (admittedly masterfully thinly sliced) dish was cold by the time it reached my table (topping the brisket with cold pickles probably didn't help this any. ) Dinner for my wife and myself (complete with 2 entrees, and appetizer, and a lemonade and a beer) came to over $70 - which just goes to show how much of a trend food BBQ has become, I remember when BBQ joints are where you went to get lots of food for cheap - now at Dinosaur BBQ I'm getting a little bit for a lot. I probably won't be back to Dinosaur Bar-B-Que, which is a shame because the things that were good where very good, but the disappointments and the high price will keep me from going back when there are so many other, better, cheaper options out there in the city.That being said, I would certainly recommend that you try it - especially those Fried Green Tomatoes (Late at night they haunt me with their crispy beauty - ORDER THE TOMATOES, DAMNIT) ...

We both got the tres ninos platter after starting out with the sampler plate for two. The sampler plate was better than the entree, and the fried green tomatoes were the highlight of the entire night.

Talk about having the itis, I'm stuffed and loving it.",5.0
"I went here the other day and had a great experience. I had previously gone to one of their other places located uptown and had a great experience there too so decided hell why not give this place a try. It was very good, got the ribs, and i know my ribs. The area is great too, very walkable to the barclays center and there are a lot of trains in the area which makes it a convienet walk.I totally recommend this place to anyone out for some good bbq. I think that a good bbq joint can be hard to find im New York. I also want to add that the portions are huge and it really lives up to the dinosaur name.",5.0

"It is an unwritten rule in our family to try every BBQ place we come across.  From North Carolina to New York, we've done it all.  We've done Dinosaur countless times in Harlem, upstate and we were so excited to smell the amazingness exuding from Dinosaur Brooklyn just one block away from our house.We've been in Brooklyn most of our lives, and I have to say we are not disappointed.  The wait is a bit daunting, but if you don't mind a lively atmosphere, and a friendly bar, it is worth it.",5.0

"Dinosaur BBQ is amazing. I think the Brooklyn addition is better than the Harlem restaurant. I got the Big Ass Pork plate and it was delicious.

"Positives:1. Afforable: If you order the family meal it comes to be around $75 for a whole chicken, a rack of ribs, a bunch of beef briskets, corn muffins, and two sides. The price is a super plus!2. Chicken: The chicken was absolutely absolutely fantastic! I cannot express how good the chicken was. Compared to the ribs (dry rub) the chicken really gave this rating a boost. 3. Drinks: The drink menu was abundant and if I had the chance I wouldve tried one.4. Negative: 1. Waiting: It was a long wait because there were so many people waiting along with us. 2. Overrated: Ive seen many reviews about this place. Careful because there's a lot of hype and that might blind some people (like myself) in being over excited. It was still  good, just not as good as I had imagined. 3. Mac n cheese: Not really a negative, but people talk about how its so good. Just to say, I thought it was over seasoned. Tasted good the first few bites.4. NO COLESLAW: Do not get cole slaw, sorry but it was not good at all. Overall. Good place for a good price and good food. Recommend, just don't go expecting holy orgasmic food.",4.0

"ive never been a fan of bbq but for some reason lately ive had the bbq bug. unfortunately its been extremely difficult to find a quality bbq restaurant in my city so i ventured to park slope, brooklyn to try out dinosaur. first, lemme say this place is HUGE. i definitely wasnt expecting that. it was packed to the hilt. after a short wait we were seated and had a very delightful server named, VERA. she actually sat at the table with us to go over menu items and give personal recommendations. she was extremely helpful. there was a bit of a wait for our food but i guess i can attribute that to how packed the place was. i ordered the brisket with mac n cheese and collard greens as my sides. for the record, i tried to order fries bcuz im a french fry junkie but vera said ""hey, with all of these great sides you only want fries? no way, try the greens!"" so, i did, and they were delicious. very tangy and sweet at the same time. the mac n cheese was awesome. the brisket was very tender but couldve used some sauce. i think they should serve cornbread with all platters but as of now its an additional side item. my friend ordered the bbq catfish and man did that look good. he loved it. he had wings as a starter and while they werent spicy enough for him he did say the flavor was great. the only bad thing i can really say is the food wasnt piping hot. when im at a restaurant i like my food piping hot from the kitchen. aside from that i can say this was a pleasurable experience. i will be going back asap. i feel comfortable recommending this place to anyone.",5.0

Interior was clean and spacious, waitress was enthusiastic, food was good, and price was decent.I had the cuban sandwich, fiancé ordered brisket, and buddy ordered a chipotle burger. I LOVE cuban sandwiches and was thoroughly impressed by theirs. I've tried a few around Brooklyn and nothing comes close. The meat was so succulent and the bread didn't get soggy; it stayed crispy down to the very last bite! Oh yeah, we each had two sides with our dishes and had fries for the table.Ok, so... my fiancé couldn't finish his brisket. He picked through what was 90% fat - rendering it inedible. I gave him half of my cuban! Also, he didn't like the sides he ordered - bbq fried rice and I can't remember what the other was. You could tell they used leftover old scraps of meat in the fried rice! Our bud liked his burger but said it could've been a bit 'spicier'!We'll definitely go back to try the ribs!",4.0

The churasco chicken steak is to die for, well marinated and seasoned in a chimichuri sauce topped with grilled onions. I definitely recommend this place if you love BBQ.

"This is really 4.5 stars but alas... So I've been to the original Dinosaur BBQ in Harlem a million times and have great affection for that place in my heart. When my bf told me that they opened a new location in Bk of course we had to go check it out. So I call to make a reservation and spoke to 2 different ppl and was placed on hold about 3 times, but no matter, because both ladies were pleasant and I was able to confirm a 9:30pm reservation for 2.So we arrive at 9:20 and the hostess/manager named Lori claimed she had nothing under my name. I told her I called and made the reservation, and in so many words she basically alluded that I was lying! I showed her my call log and said ""Is this the number here ?"" with the length of minutes I was on the phone. She STILL told me it was impossible that I called because she had worked the phones ALL DAY and would have remembered me. At this point my boyfriend, who had never been to the Dinosaur was ready to leave based off her nastiness alone. Instead of being gracious and saying ""We haven't been open a week yet, things have been a little crazy, there may have been a mixup."", she was just flat out rude. If I hadn't wanted my boyfriend to taste the food so badly trust me we would have left.Anyways, there was another reservationist dealing with walk ins and he was super nice, and our waiter Louis was freaking awesome !!!!!! Trust me they saved the day big time. I recommend getting the swag sampler, breakfast all day, and the pick 3 combo, they were all phenomenal.We will be coming back and hopefully next time we WON'T have to deal with Lori.",4.0

"The earned their 4 star review after a very rocky start . They have a text message waiting system so when we were told it would take 45-60 min for a seat I received a text alert that I was signed up. The 6 or so outside seats were only about half full for a good 30 minutes so it was frustrating to wait. Why is no one being seated outside yet? If the next table doesn't respond to the text or show up in a timely manner, hurry up and skip them.We did get seated right at the end of the expected wait time though but the disorganized system made it feel longer. I had the unlimited ice tea refill though to keep hydrated in the heat.Once finally seated we ordered the swag sampler, ice tea refills and a long island ice tea. The swag sampler was the start of an entirely different experience. Wings were delicious and meaty. Fried green tomatoes had a nice crunch without being overdone or soggy. My friend and I shared our meals of tres ninos (pulled pork, ribs and brisket) and the churrasco chicken steak. Sides of mac n cheese, potato salad and chili. The chicken steak almost made me cat daddy in my chair. If they bottle the sauce I would buy it in bulk. I was a bit disappointed with the tres ninos. The pulled pork was more like a mushy chop vs pulled, the brisket was lacking and both a bit sauceless. It was not bad just not good.I will definitely come again to eat and may try out the Harlem location. If you are born and raised on Southern BBQ then don't come with that in mind. The food here is great for NY BBQ and good in general. Good service not too fake nice to get a tip, good drinks, nice vibe and really good food choices.

The bbq here is top notch..me and the wife came here for dinner and after a brief wait we were seated..we went straight for the entree and skipped on appetizers..i had the pork ribs and 1/4 chicken with fries and crispy cole slaw and my wife had the peel and eat shrimp with the pork ribs...the meat easily peeled off the bone and melted in my mouth..the shrimp was good too but you had to put some work in to remove the shell from the shrimp...we had lemonade to drink which we loved and refills were free!!.we were very pleased with our dinner and by far its the best bbq ive had in brooklyn!,5.0

Sauce was over tangy not good for kids to eat mac and cheese was the worst I have ever tasted in my life (like a stinky foot with cheese) do not order I warned you.

Let's get back to reason to go to Dino BBQ.  The ribs were smokey, meaty, nicely rubbed, cooked perfectly -- juicy but not greasy.

"This isn't the type of place you expect to find in NYC.  It's huge inside with that over-done uber 'Murican decor that you would see in some suburban chain restaurant somewhere in middle-America.... and that's what makes it awesome.  Dino-BBQ is a quick escape from the cramped dining experience you typically find in New York City.  There are a lot of BBQ joints in New York.  Some have actual smokers, some claim to be Texas style or KC style or a North Carolina style or some blend of styles with a lot of thought into describing the uniqueness of the flavor.  The only words on the menu at Dinosaur that I saw had to do with what was available to order and If I had to describe what type of BBQ it is I'd say KC style with a hint of vinegar.  They served up a nice tangy sauce slathered over pulled pork and some of the meatiest ribs I've ever had.  The mac & cheese had some sort of smokey pimenton to spice them up, but otherwise weren't too complicated, and that's what I think the secret is to good BBQ... they don't try to do too much... they just kick ass at what they do well.",4.0

"We had a quick dinner before a roof top movie.  The decor looked perfect for a bbq joint.

I ended up with a small slab of baby back, which I dread, because I had to keep pulling tiny bones out of my mouth.  I can say it was small when i compared it to my dining companions portion or maybe I should say he got a large portion.  The brisket was a little dry but still tasty.   I loved the mash potatoes. I was a little disappointed in the beer selection but managed to find a good beer after two tries. The service was good but busy so you had to flag down the waiter.  I would recommend this place to anyone loves BBQ and chicken.  The price was appropriate and the service and food were good.",4.0
"The earned their 4 star review after a very rocky start . They have a text message waiting system so when we were told it would take 45-60 min for a seat I received a text alert that I was signed up. The 6 or so outside seats were only about half full for a good 30 minutes so it was frustrating to wait. Why is no one being seated outside yet? If the next table doesn't respond to the text or show up in a timely manner, hurry up and skip them.We did get seated right at the end of the expected wait time though but the disorganized system made it feel longer. I had the unlimited ice tea refill though to keep hydrated in the heat.Once finally seated we ordered the swag sampler, ice tea refills and a long island ice tea. The swag sampler was the start of an entirely different experience. Wings were delicious and meaty. Fried green tomatoes had a nice crunch without being overdone or soggy. My friend and I shared our meals of tres ninos (pulled pork, ribs and brisket) and the churrasco chicken steak. Sides of mac n cheese, potato salad and chili. The chicken steak almost made me cat daddy in my chair. If they bottle the sauce I would buy it in bulk. I was a bit disappointed with the tres ninos. The pulled pork was more like a mushy chop vs pulled, the brisket was lacking and both a bit sauceless. It was not bad just not good.I will definitely come again to eat and may try out the Harlem location. If you are born and raised on Southern BBQ then don't come with that in mind. The food here is great for NY BBQ and good in general. Good service not too fake nice to get a tip, good drinks, nice vibe and really good food choices. I will be updating my review though if the seating times/organization remains though.",4.0

"I WISH I COULD GIVE THIS PLACE A MILLION STARS.This was my first experience with Dinosaur BBQ. I have never been to the Harlem location, so I wasn't even sure what to expect.

Upon being called to our table, I observed the cutesy decor and really enjoyed the pleasant service... So sweet, fast and helpful. The menu has a lot to offer - So many food and beer options. I started with the lemonade and we shared the honey wings - an order of 6 was a perfect starter for 2 people. For my entree, I decided on the BBQ 1/4 chicken and BBQ brisket combo, with mac & cheese and potato salad for my sides. My birthday boyfriend had the ribs with fries and mac & cheese, along with a beer. All entrees come with cornbread. The brisket was TO DIE FOR, the chicken was tasty, the mac & cheese and potato salad were both ON THE MONEY. We were extremely impressed, we were even talking about it the next day.For two people to enjoy an appetizer, two entrees, a lemonade and a beer, the bill came to about 70$ (with tip), which I think is perfectly reasonable, especially for the delicious food we had just enjoyed.

After visiting two of the chain's locations, I am just not that eager to eat there again. Their meat really isn't that flavorful and sometimes heads towards the dry side.

"i originally thought i was going to give a 3 star review... but the longer i think about it, the more negative i feel. so two stars it is!we had a reservation, but we still had a wait..which was annoying but whatever. our server was nice but completely inefficient. took ages to get our drinks and we were never given re-fills of our water that sat empty for 60% of the meal. the entire ordeal was slow as molasses. our server acknowledged this once and tried to pass the buck onto the kitchen but seeing as all of our food showed up less than hot, i don't know what to think. also, it's not the kitchen's fault when it takes over 20 minutes to get the check and settle it once after requesting it.on the bright side, the 2 stars comes from my dude raving about how much he loved the wings he ordered. said they were some of the best he's ever had.we also had our baby with us and planned our mealtime based on what we usually experience at restaurants to have us finished and on our way home around his bedtime but in reality, we didn't make it home until 1.5 hours PAST what we expected. excessive.this was on a wednesday evening....i shudder to think what a shitshow it must be on the weekend.",2.0

"i originally thought i was going to give a 3 star review... but the longer i think about it, the more negative i feel. so two stars it is!we had a reservation, but we still had a wait..which was annoying but whatever. our server was nice but completely inefficient. took ages to get our drinks and we were never given re-fills of our water that sat empty for 60% of the meal. the entire ordeal was slow as molasses. our server acknowledged this once and tried to pass the buck onto the kitchen but seeing as all of our food showed up less than hot, i don't know what to think. also, it's not the kitchen's fault when it takes over 20 minutes to get the check and settle it once after requesting it.on the bright side, the 2 stars comes from my dude raving about how much he loved the wings he ordered. said they were some of the best he's ever had.we also had our baby with us and planned our mealtime based on what we usually experience at restaurants to have us finished and on our way home around his bedtime but in reality, we didn't make it home until 1.5 hours PAST what we expected. excessive.this was on a wednesday evening....i shudder to think what a shitshow it must be on the weekend.",2.0
I've been to the Harlem location about 7 years ago. I was worried that over time this place became overrated but I was happy to discover that it's still as great. I love the Mac and cheese as well as the ribs. The brisket was not very memorable. The creole deviled eggs were tasty too!,4.0

"I am a big fan of Dinosaur; I've been to the Harlem location too many times to count, and I have been to the Brooklyn location three times before this most recent visit last Monday. Every previous visit was wonderful -- the food was tasty and the service was great.But this last visit left me underwhelmed. First the Dino poutine was bland and dry. The pulled pork on top had almost no taste, and there was very little gravy or cheese.The last four visits (including this one), I've ordered the 2- or 3-meat combo, and I always get the ribs. This time I found the ribs to be more like dry pork chops with barbecue sauce on top, rather than nicely smoked meat where the sauce (and flavor) is absorbed into the meat. The house made sausage was very tasty.My wife had the Texas brisket and the pulled pork. She thought both were somewhat bland. The brisket has been my favorite dish, so I tried it and thought it was a bit lacking in flavor.When we mentioned to the waiter that the poutine was bland, she had the manager come over to talk to us. He was apologetic and listened to our concerns but assured us that nothing had changed in the kitchen. We aren't so sure.I'm hoping Monday was just an off night, but I'm not as excited about going back to Dinosaur as I used to be.",2.0

As for their sauces, I tried 2/3 and must admit that even as a novice cook, I've made tastier BBQ sauce at home. The habanero wasn't spicy. The regular wasn't sweet or tangy. This was much more of a corporate chain restaurant experience, not down-home authentic BBQ. It reminded me of Claim Jumper, which is significant, I think.

"Terrible customer service! I was going to order their wings today (Superbowl) but when I called, the woman who answered was incredibly rude and said if I'd like to order takeout, I'd have to come in (listen i know its incredibly busy but part of your job is to be nice to people even under stress- she seemed angry with the world, not a pleasant phone call and I was very nice). What is your business model?? **Why have a takeout line if you can't place an order to be picked up? Is it only for today? Wish she would have clarified and said more than ""no take out over the phone, you have to come in"" And then I asked how long will it be if I came in and ordered, she said ""an hour"" eek! thought they would have a good system for Superbowl, if you do take out, do take out! Don't just do takeout on the days that are convenient for you and not as busy. So for some reason i went in (I live down the road) and there were so many people waiting for take out and the woman that was at the takeout  counter yelled at the people to move to the bar, that they can't crowd (she yelled!! probably the same woman I spoke to on the phone). After seeing that, I just turned around and went somewhere else more organized (although I had to wait at the other place just as long they were super friendly about it) But all in all I will not be recommending it to people due to their lack of efficiency and poor customer service. today completely turned me off to dinosaur (there are so many better bbq joints open that I don't need a place That does not think of setting up a system on busy days like today for their customers, especially since I like close by and gave them a lot of business in the past.)",2.0

It has been 4 long years since i last ate at Dinosaur BBQ (In Harlem).

The decor is an exact replica of the place in Harlem. The portion is small versus the price! I could have swore, the portion was a lot bigger in harlem. I ordered the 2 meats combo plate. Once again, although delicious, the portion is a big disappointment.  I got at best 1/8 pound of brisket, .25 oz of mac and cheese and beans and pork. the waiter told me there was burnt ends in the beans, umm... I was lied too! Why am I still giving this place 4 stars? its simple, the food was good, and its the only BBQ place worth going to around me.... the portion at fette sau is a lot bigger, but its also a hike for me to get there...  the next time i go, i am just ordering meat, no side!",4.0

"Hey folks lets talk Dinosaur,Like the great dinosaurs of the past they will end up extinct. Their high on the horse attitude will change when either one of two things happen ; the trend dies or they are out of business ( like most places I see over the long years I have lived in Brooklyn...long meaning ALL MY LIFE...I am not a transplant here) I think they need to consider getting off that horse and get back to customer service for the people (not just their profit) before it is to late.Ill start by saying this is not about the food...it is good food (not great just good) I say good and comparable (nothing special) to other places that serve bbq style food around Brooklyn that have been here for years (no I will not mention the others names, that is not fair or what this is about).  I have eaten there numerous times and have enjoyed their food, that is if you do not mind the hour wait for a table, the usually packed environment or well not so great attitude and service sometimes.Here is where by review goes sour for ""Dinos"" ( so far I do not think it is sour...lol). If you look at the history of ""Dinos"" it all started in a mobile concession stand with 55 gallon drums cut in half to provide bikers some good food (short version) that was when it was about serving people good food (ah the good ol days of a business). I guess business became more important than the people. I went to book a ""50th birthday party at the Union street location. A party, not a big one, a small intimate setting with 15-17 people from Brooklyn ( not a lot , right?) I look into their website to get some information on packages and such like that. They boast off site catering (which was not what I was looking for) a ""semi-private"" party room, sounds good (up to 70 people) and according to their catering menu ""we accommodate large parties in the restaurant dining room"" . They offer some great packages as well ( I was going with their Cadillac package) they give you all the information about booking, deposits and cancelations (with the explanation of forfeiting you deposit depending on cancelation) great information, so far so good, right, sounds like a plan? We decided this would be a great night for a bunch of people who LOVE to eat, love a casual environment and love that messy down to earth ""regular guy"" food, shoot they even have a band that comes on ,this is great. Well the semi private room was out because we only have 15 -17 people, so based on their website, we can do it in the dining room, which accommodates large parties....SCREEEEEEECH, HOLD UP, PUT ON THE BREAKS.... Lets break down ""Dinos"" website, the things that are not mentioned in all that information pertaining to ""parties"" the things maybe they should inform people about:Semi-Private party room: This means it is a small section of the dining room that they use as a party room this ""party room"" is not to be used on weekend nights, WHAAAAAT a party room that you cannot have a party on the weekends....Accommodate large parties in dining room: This means large parties that are not over 12 people (unless you want to be separated from each other).....Wait a minute I sometimes go out for dinner with friends and we have more than 12 people and that is not a party, that's just a bunch of guys going out to eat.Party: you can have the reservation for ( lets say 7:30 for example) but you cannot come in 10-15 minutes before to set up any ""decorations"" ( by decorations I mean a 5 balloons and some small bags designed like skulls on the table)cannot because the table will be in use before your reservation.Now do you want to know how I found this all out? By speaking with the manager. An arrogant person who thinks his (the restaurant's poop does not stink...that's my nice way of saying his S**T don't stink) and being told nah it is just to busy to do parties on weekend nights and they cannot but tables together to accommodate  a party of more than 12 and the catering packages cannot be done on weekend nights either. However he did offer a solution to our problem. Make it 12people , do it on a Thurs., get a few ""family style"" plates. Solution was forget a few people, do it on a Thursday and pay more for family style.Well folks I do not know about you but I usually do not do ""parties"" on weeknights (well I do not any longer since I was about 30 years old...lol)I called the catering dept. I figure maybe the manager just did not want to accommodate our ""party"" because it means loss to ""his"" restaurant, low and behold the catering dept. said the same things.WOW! I was shocked! I guess their ""party"" accommodations are only valid when it does not interfere with their profit accommodations. Well I hope they change some information on their website and let people know about their ""party"" accommodations upfront (they are quick to mention deposits and cancelations), get off that high horse, remember their history and get back to serving people not just a profit margin",2.0

"Sad, mediocre brisket, arrived drowned in BBQ sauce which was so unremarkable it might as well as been ketchup. Watery flavorless side dishes (turkey neck greens & black eyed peas). I won't hold the sides against them, but the brisket was not especially juicy or tender, and not at all distinctively smoked/marinated. As far as one can imagine from the cuts of brisket that you can find at Mighty Quinn, Briskettown, not to mention the likes of Lockhart, TX. Not Applebees, but far from something to get excited about. That said, service was solid.",2.0
"i came here during opening week and everything was awesome. the service and the food were on point- no new store jitters or awkward management trying to work out the kinks. i got the tres ninos so that i could try the brisket, ribs, and pulled pork. the pulled pork was really tender and fatty and the ribs were sooo delicious. i was unimpressed by the sides and the cornbread, which was kind of sad cuz i love cornbread.",4.0
"By far the best BBQ I've ever had. So many restaurants try to make the smokey pulled pork, brisket, ribs and etc and fail. But dinosaur takes the cake. Smokey rich BBQ flavor and finger lickin good. The Cajun driven shrimp is tasty. And the their home made sweet tea is awesome",5.0
I love their food!! And the fact that's its super affordable! Had the pulled pork sandwich and mashed potatoes..both were so good that I inhaled my meal. My friend had the mac 'n cheese and said that it was like a little bite of heaven.,5.0
"Finally, no more trips from Bklyn to the Harlem location. Great place and great location. The smell of BBQ is unbelievable. They just opened a few months ago and it was another fantastic meal. You must try the Donkey Punch which most ppl don't know about. Be careful, it does pack a punch. We went for a late lunch, early dinner. The pulled pork was awesome, smoky and tender. The ribs were good and the chicken was nice and moist. Had the BBQ fried rice and beans. Great combo to get and mix. My girl got the Tres Ninos, a good dish to get when you want to try a little of each. We had Taylor who was a lot of fun and is a true person. When you go, tell her Carlos and Rebeca say hi. She knows me as that guy. LOL. Get down there and try some BBQ and drinks... Go enjoy......",4.0
"So i don't know if it's my palate or if everyone on yelp is a bit overstating it but the food here tasted like it did in Harlem. It was delicious. Just beautiful! Great location too, just you're gonna have to wait for it. Grab a beer enjoy the decor (including the i hope fake grimy windows) :)",5.0
Came here with a couple of friends around 8 at night despite the hour of waiting. Now I understand why there was such a line the good was great. Dino BBQ is way better then Dallas BBQ ribs cooked with such flavor the service is great. Free refills on soft drinks and overall a good vibe for friends and family. I will definitely come back here again with my girlfriend.,5.0

"I really wanted to like Dino BBQ... We took my dad to Dino BBQ the last night to celebrate his birthday, He had seen the place and really wanted to try it, it was a Friday night so we did not feel the need to moan about the hour long wait, after being seated we were obviously eager to order and get our meals, when our waitress, Sarah stopped by to take our drink orders we bombarded her with questions about items on the menu since it was our first time, I noticed that she quickly got frustrated with our party of 5 so we decided to order water and take more time to analyze the menu. When I asked her about the BBQ friend rice, being the annoying pescatarian in the group of meat lovers, I asked what the BBQ fried rice was, she dryly informed me that i was just like Asian fried rice but with BBQ sauce instead of soy. When we were ready to order, I asked if there was meat and she let me know me that it had pork. No biggie, I hear the mac n cheese is to die for so I ordered 2 servings of that with 2 servings of the peel and eat shrimp. When my dish came,  I dived in to grab a shrimp and realized it was cold. I explained to her that all of the entrees on that part of the menu was hot and I assumed the shrimp would be too, her response was that is says on the menu that it was cold (excuse me for rushing to order after a one hour wait) well I asked if it was possible to switch meals and she explained that I would have to pay for two meals even if I only ate one without flinching or a sign of concern. Well, I didn't order something different, I ate a few shrimp and some of my mac n cheese then brought the shrimp home and re-cooked them. Also, she kept bringing us drinks with no straws (i don't do BBQ too often so I'm not sure if rum mustaches are a thing)I guess I expected more of a customer service experience than her obvious annoyance with our group, or maybe even a little empathy for the fact that my entree was unexpectedly cold...I gave 3 stars because the mac n cheese was to die for and my dad loved his food, so I guess if attitudes don't bother you, you should give it a shot.",3.0

"I first went to this location last summer for my birthday.  I was in a food coma with that visit and the subsequent one,  so I sworreee I'd make sure to review this time.  We went on St Paddy's day which is also my son's birthday.  This was his 'dream' dinner (his words!)

FYI we got there at 6:30p. Our server was great (sorry, the brisket made me forget her name) and really on point. To start, we had the swag sampler (what else?!) plate. The eggs were perfectly done,  fried green tomatoes were crispy,  shrimp weren't overcooked and the wings were juicy! My son had the kids wings with mac n cheez and cole slaw. He also had a side of chilli that ahem, his dad and I tried that was totally delicious! Bean to meat ratio was good and seasoned well. I had the combo plate with brisket, 1/4 chicken,  black eyed peas and greens. Everything was awesome, except that I felt the brisket could have hung out in the smoker a bit longer. Dad had the hot link and chixken combo and was disappointed with the sausage.  He said he wasn't wowed at all with that and it tasted 'regular'. Drinks were Donkey Punch for the adults and juice for the kids. Umm don't have that punch on an empty stomach!! Lol! To finish, the birthday boy had the chocolate icebox pie and Dad the cheesecake with whiskey sauce. They were both yummy! ;  ).

"It was a fairly long wait to get in on a Sunday evening, but its definitely worth it.  We went overboard and ordered way too much food.  Apps:  original fried green tomatoes (soooo good, especially with the ranch sauce), wango tango wings (so meaty, perfectly cooked, sauce is perfect), and deviled eggs (very good but nothing out of the ordinary.)  After that, for a table of 5, we ordered the family bbq: ribs, chicken, pulled pork, brisket, plus cornbread, baked beans, mashed potates, and coleslaw.  Everything was fantastic.  We also ordered the mac and cheese just to make sure we killed ourselves with fat and calories properly.  The menu says the family BBQ can feed 4-6 but even without the appetizers i'd say it could feed 8 people.  We ended up taking tons of leftovers home.  At the end we ordered a chocolate icebox cake for the table to share- the waitress was kind enough to bring us an extra one on the house.  It had this amazing oreo-like crust and the pie itself was like thick chocolate pudding - amazing.  All that food came out to around $23 pp - which was a steal.  Can't wait to go back!",4.0
"Dinosaur BBQ is the place that made me fall in love with BBQ when I was in college in western ny. The Rochester location was so great. When I moved to Harlem I was of course,  excited to go to the location there, but it was less than exciting. Over cooked, under seasoned etc. I decided to keep my fond memories of the upstate spot and not go to the new location in Brooklyn, now that that is my home. Well, I finally caved and went, yup absolutely bad experience. I ordered the salad with pulled pork to go. For a slow afternoon service, I still waited a half an hour for a salad. I started to leave, but decided to check before I got too far, it was missing the nuts .when I told the guy at the counter he gave me some weird answer about needing to ask for them, which I don't understand, as one assumes that you get what the menu says you get.  Went home, started eating the salad, it was tasty, like I remember. And then voila, a hair that was definitely not mine in the pulled pork. Ugh. Never going back. There was too much wrong  for one experience.",1.0
BBQ as Disney would imagine it. This is pretty much a theme restaurant that serves BBQ. The meat was better than the sides. Portions were needlessly gigantic.  Service was friendly and the decor was interesting: I liked the bottle chandelier. The restaurant seems made for the Barclay's crowd.,3.0
"I have been to the one in Harlem, and I like this place, but I wouldn't go back for anything except the wings and beer. It's all fine and dandy BBQ, but the wings and good beer selection are the return items. Dogfish IPA 90 Min by the pitcher. Yes, pls.",3.0

Dad had the hot link and chixken combo and was disappointed with the sausage.  He said he wasn't wowed at all with that and it tasted 'regular'. Drinks were Donkey Punch for the adults and juice for the kids. Umm don't have that punch on an empty stomach!! Lol! To finish, the birthday boy had the chocolate icebox pie and Dad the cheesecake with whiskey sauce. They were both yummy! ;  ). My only gripe is that I prefer booth seating (we had a floor table) and I reallllyyy wish they'd smoke beef ribs!",4.0
Ordered the family meal for a party of 4 and it was more than enough. The food has flavor and wasn't as dry as I expected it to be. The only problem I had was that all the plates didn't fit on the table .,4.0
"The first few times I went here everything was amazing, literally no one had a complaint. The last few times, however, the food and service have been terrible. One time it was empty and they still wouldn't seat us. After a thirty minute wait they rushed out the driest ribs I ever had. So disappointing!!!! DINO BBQ, I LOVED YOU!",3.0
"I'm so happy there's finally a Dino BBQ near me! I had the BBQ catfish, which was cooked perfectly with a really nice, light but tasty glaze. The cole slaw is perfect, and the mac and cheese is some of the best I've ever had.",5.0
"The two stars are only for the great service. Fried green tomatoes are off the chizzain but everything else was about as mediocre as it gets.

This place must be the best BBQ place ever. The ribs are amazing the service is great. I love this place so much that I had my 2013 Christmas party there. Great job guys keep up the good work.,5.0
"It was a fairly long wait to get in on a Sunday evening, but its definitely worth it.  We went overboard and ordered way too much food.  Apps:  original fried green tomatoes (soooo good, especially with the ranch sauce), wango tango wings (so meaty, perfectly cooked, sauce is perfect), and deviled eggs (very good but nothing out of the ordinary.)  After that, for a table of 5, we ordered the family bbq: ribs, chicken, pulled pork, brisket, plus cornbread, baked beans, mashed potates, and coleslaw.  Everything was fantastic.  We also ordered the mac and cheese just to make sure we killed ourselves with fat and calories properly.  The menu says the family BBQ can feed 4-6 but even without the appetizers i'd say it could feed 8 people.  We ended up taking tons of leftovers home.  At the end we ordered a chocolate icebox cake for the table to share- the waitress was kind enough to bring us an extra one on the house.  It had this amazing oreo-like crust and the pie itself was like thick chocolate pudding - amazing.  All that food came out to around $23 pp - which was a steal.  Can't wait to go back!",4.0
"Dinosaur BBQ is the place that made me fall in love with BBQ when I was in college in western ny. The Rochester location was so great. When I moved to Harlem I was of course,  excited to go to the location there, but it was less than exciting. Over cooked, under seasoned etc. I decided to keep my fond memories of the upstate spot and not go to the new location in Brooklyn, now that that is my home. Well, I finally caved and went, yup absolutely bad experience. I ordered the salad with pulled pork to go. For a slow afternoon service, I still waited a half an hour for a salad. I started to leave, but decided to check before I got too far, it was missing the nuts .when I told the guy at the counter he gave me some weird answer about needing to ask for them, which I don't understand, as one assumes that you get what the menu says you get.  Went home, started eating the salad, it was tasty, like I remember. And then voila, a hair that was definitely not mine in the pulled pork. Ugh. Never going back. There was too much wrong  for one experience.",1.0
BBQ as Disney would imagine it. This is pretty much a theme restaurant that serves BBQ. The meat was better than the sides. Portions were needlessly gigantic.  Service was friendly and the decor was interesting: I liked the bottle chandelier. The restaurant seems made for the Barclay's crowd.,3.0
"I have been to the one in Harlem, and I like this place, but I wouldn't go back for anything except the wings and beer. It's all fine and dandy BBQ, but the wings and good beer selection are the return items. Dogfish IPA 90 Min by the pitcher. Yes, pls.",3.0

"Came for lunch on a Saturday. I read all the reviews of the bad or so so service on Yelp before I went, so I was prepared... We got seated right away by the lovely hostess, but then 10 minutes later we were still being ignored by wait staff who were just chatting with themselves (looking at their cell phones???) and serving other tables around us, even tables who came after us. It almost seemed like the waiters and waitresses didn't get along and no one wanted us. I mean, I think that its just not cool to not come over to customers to at least welcome them and give them water? Hello management? So after 10 mins of being ignored, we got up and went and sat at the bar. The wonderful bartenders took care of us lickety split and we had drinks in 2 minutes and food pronto. Great food and great personalities at the bar. Too bad the wait staff in the main room gave us attitude. On the way to the bathroom I saw our same first table with a sad couple waiting for service too, what a drag, I almost told them to sit at the bar! Maybe the wait staff doesn't like tables for 2?

"To start off with, I'd like to be clear, if we could vote half stars, I'd only be giving it a 3.5. But I can't. My husband said he would round down, I chose to round up, but I'm not sure if that's because I wished it was better than it was.I've been to the Harlem location in the last few months, and despite what people have said, it is not the same exact menu as that location. I got the pulled pork, brisket, and sausage with mac and cheese and fries. Husband got the pulled pork, brisket, and ribs with kale and fries. Both came with cornbread. He cleaned his plate, I brought half home. Brisket usually cut against the grains, but here they did that and then chopped it in half again, so 4 pieces were really 2. Flavor wise it was difficult to notice the differences because the pork and brisket had the same sauce on it. (In Harlem location they didn't have sauce on the brisket.) I would have preferred to put my own sauce on (which they had on the table) because than I would have left it off. The sausage was the most distinct because it didn't have sauce on it. Kale was a bit bland (no seasoning). Cornbread very average. Good fries. I didn't particularly like the mac and cheese, which is usually my thing. There wasn't anything wrong with it, per se, but I didn't like the cheese they used. Ribs were decent.For dessert, we split the peanut butter pie. Good if you like peanut butter, but too rich to eat a whole slice by myself. Atmosphere was loud (husband couldn't hear me across the table) and it appears to be big with families. I liked the look of it. One of the nice things is that it has more room than the Harlem location.

We finally walked it up to the host stand and asked if we could have them run it because we were waiting so long.

"The OK PartDrinks are priced on the high side (esp cocktails) - $11 a pop for cocktailsFood was decent. Comparable to wildwood in Manhattan union square or Country Hill BBQ. We got followingBrisket -- Have had better brisket (for instance at briskettown)Wings -- Probably best part of meal. Both, sauces and meat quality were good. Got 2 star spicy (6 wings) and 4 star spicy (3 wings). 4 star was their max, and they were genuinely spicy!Grilled Cheese (kids menu) -- Very cheesy and VERY greasyRibs -- Well smoked, tender -- second best part of mealThe not OK PartI felt I was in a money making machine.My wife wanted to have 6pc wings as main course. Not too hungry. The waiter rephrased her ask as appetizers two times, and she just gave up. Next, I had to step out to move the car. Gentleman came back twice to take order for rest of meal from my wife, even though she told him I needed to come back so we could agree on rest of order. His rush was driven by fact that once appetizers came, we would order less.When our order arrived, a side we had ordered was missing. Instead we got somebody else' side. When waiter came by, informed him of this, he dashed away, and returned with the correct side. Good here is he knew what was messed up, and addressed immediately. The bad was that nary a word of apology regarding the screw up or addressing fact that we were a third of the way into our meal already.He stopped by a second time to inquire about the food, but left before we were done responding!Net net - this is a professionally run place where staff are well trained in the mechanics of good service. However, no heart. Insincerity oozed through my dining experience. Food was decent quality, sizeable portions, but not worth dealing with faux-friendliness.Without waiters' machinations, I would have probably spent $50 (for two plus child) and left without a tonne of leftovers. Better for the planet, and return business. Instead, spent approximately $70, and left with a tonne of food, much of which will get thrown away.",2.0

My server Vera never smiled and had a look on her face like"" I hate being here and serve you."" She never recommended anything, when I asked about their beers she said its in the menu, when I asked about the desert menu she said its on the table. She brought the check without asking if we want anything for desert or if I want another beer. When she brought a check, she did not say anything. Just dropped it on the table.  The host acknowledging that we need an assistance never came to the table when we need help at the time when the restaurant was dead. I felt like they just don't care about their guests.",2.0
"The OK PartDrinks are priced on the high side (esp cocktails) - $11 a pop for cocktailsFood was decent. Comparable to wildwood in Manhattan union square or Country Hill BBQ. We got followingBrisket -- Have had better brisket (for instance at briskettown)Wings -- Probably best part of meal. Both, sauces and meat quality were good. Got 2 star spicy (6 wings) and 4 star spicy (3 wings). 4 star was their max, and they were genuinely spicy!Grilled Cheese (kids menu) -- Very cheesy and VERY greasyRibs -- Well smoked, tender -- second best part of mealThe not OK PartI felt I was in a money making machine.My wife wanted to have 6pc wings as main course. Not too hungry. The waiter rephrased her ask as appetizers two times, and she just gave up. Next, I had to step out to move the car. Gentleman came back twice to take order for rest of meal from my wife, even though she told him I needed to come back so we could agree on rest of order. His rush was driven by fact that once appetizers came, we would order less.When our order arrived, a side we had ordered was missing. Instead we got somebody else' side. When waiter came by, informed him of this, he dashed away, and returned with the correct side. Good here is he knew what was messed up, and addressed immediately. The bad was that nary a word of apology regarding the screw up or addressing fact that we were a third of the way into our meal already.He stopped by a second time to inquire about the food, but left before we were done responding!Net net - this is a professionally run place where staff are well trained in the mechanics of good service. However, no heart. Insincerity oozed through my dining experience. Food was decent quality, sizeable portions, but not worth dealing with faux-friendliness.Without waiters' machinations, I would have probably spent $50 (for two plus child) and left without a tonne of leftovers. Better for the planet, and return business. Instead, spent approximately $70, and left with a tonne of food, much of which will get thrown away.",2.0
The food was great!!! and my server ( I totaly forgot her name) was amazing.  Definitely try the wings with wango tango sauce.,5.0
"Probably the worst service I've ever received at a restaurant. We had an 8pm reservation for 2, and since we were coming from Long Island, we budgeted extra time, ending up there at 7:15. The hostesses were fine with it and said that they would seat us at the next open table, and they would call my cell phone when that happened. We figured it made no sense to leave so we grabbed a couple of beers at the bar. After finishing our beers, loitering around for another 20 mins, and then realizing it was now close to 8:30 (half an hour past our reservation), I approached the hostess and asked what the deal was, and she had no clue who I was or what I was asking about, so I refreshed her memory. Then she says she has been trying to reach me (I had no missed call on my phone, which was in my hand the entire time-I also had her confirm my number before we waited, so its my assumption that she was now lying to save face) and MIRACULOUSLY at that moment a table opened up. Hm.Funny because I read someone else's review saying something very similar. Maybe management should look into what their employees up front do. The table we were seated as was small and annoyingly right in the entryway of the bathroom. Bad luck I guess, oh well. Our waitress came over and we tried to order two flights, which she didn't think to write down until we finished telling her what we wanted. Kind of annoyed at this point since we were waiting for such a long time. We got the Swag sampler, and that came out long before we got our beers. This was pretty awesome. The swag sampler for two people included ONE HALF of a deviled egg, ONE wing, three shrimp (how generous) and a slice of a fried green tomato.Is this a joke? Am I being pranked? This is ridiculous for two people to share. Kinda fed up at this point and I want to leave, but we stayed because we finally (after 20 mins) got our drinks, and this is probably the only thing this place has going for them. Great beer selection, I even discovered a few new ones that I really like. So that was cool.Then we got our BBQ plate thingy. I ordered the Brisket, which was a-ice cold when I got it. Ok. and b-the fattiest cut of meat I've ever eaten in my life. ew. My fiance got the pulled pork sandwich. He really liked the BBQ sauce, and he says it tasted about what you'd expect from this type of place.The ribs were decent.

"Our recent Dino experience began with waiting on the bartender to finish arguing with her friend / partner / nemesis before she angrily procured our take out order and ended with a night of projectile vomiting during which I relived the waves of black pepper and cayenne pepper that dominated and nearly ruined every overpriced morsel of chicken, pork, beef and macaroni and cheese we ate.

"i cannot yell enough good things about Dino BBQ. everything we've ever had has been excellent. they have a great beer selection, very good cocktails and their servers are extremely friendly and professional. my husband had ordered the sausage, which was still in the smoker, and not only did the waiter come by multiple times to apologize for the wait, but then the manager came out and apologized and comped us a round of the beer that we were drinking. we had so much food on our plates, that the sausage was totally not a big deal, and the fact that they were so concerned about it even though they knew we were working on our other food was super conscientious, i thought! also, the portions are refreshingly reasonable, so you'll eat and you'll love it, but you won't feel sick and regretfully overfed afterwards.  definitely need a reservation. this place is SLAMMED every time i'm there.",5.0

"I've been to Dinosaur in Harlem which is a great experience. And I was all excited to hear they've come to Brooklyn. But for the quality of food compared to their horrible, horrendous and rude service, it's not worth it. I ended up waiting over an hour for my food. This is after I was guaranteed that it would only be a ""couple of seconds more"" at the half hour mark. After repeated requests for more info, nothing. And then they told me a new delay of no mash potatoes and that I'd have to wait another 15 minutes unless I wanted something else. WTF. I don't care if it's growing pains, but they need to renovate the service and customer service. Horrendous and not worth it.",2.0
"the food is amazing. I definitely would say the best compared to other BBQ restaurants. I love that it is in park slope as well and do not have to travel to harlem. I have been here several times and the good food is what always drives me back. The service is another story. Typically I am very patient at restaurants (Ive worked in service industry for 10 years) however my visit last night was rather aggravating. I made reservations through open table for party of 4 and ended up being three. The hostess was more then pleasant and fine with it. We sat and waited about ten minutes for drink orders then ten minutes for the drinks and finally ordered. The waitress was not at all pleasant, the amount of stress was clearly showing on her face, and they were not even that busy. The food didn't take long however a different server served us (not a runner). Our server never checked on us and we had to wave her down to order food to go and to drop the check. She then disappeared for another 15 minutes when finally we decided to try and pay by the hostess just so we could get out of there. As I pulled out my credit card she appeared and then that was another 10 minute wait to get it back. I understand busy however she was neglectful, unpleasant and looked extremely aggravated, almost unapproachable. Usually my problem here always with the service, normally would just brush it off however was extremely uncomfortable, and she got our take home order completely wrong. I do really love the food and atmosphere, just wish the servers were more welcoming and just more pleasant- and it was a birthday dinner clearly noted on reservation and did not even offer desert, just wish I went somewhere else for this event.",2.0
"We love the Dinosaur BBQ in Harlem, so we decided to go to the new location in Brooklyn (just opened two weeks ago). When we arrived the hostess said the wait was 60-75 minutes, they take my cell phone number so they can text you when the table is ready, we decided to wait by the bar. Um, let me start with something good. The bar was VERY crowded, but the bartenders were fantastic!  Bartender made every effort to take my order while serving other patrons. Even joked with us a little while we waited for our table, which by the way took 90 minutes for a table of two......once we sat down we waited a couple of minutes for our waiter and he appeared to take our order. My husband ordered the standard bbq ribs and chicken. I made the mistake of ordering the chicken steak.  Took a while, then hubby's order arrived, but NO chicken steak. I waited an additional 20 and asked the waiter about my order. He didn't have an answer but was nice enough to send the manager to our table. When she came over, she apologized and said that the smoked meat is different from the grilled meat (chicken steak).  I guess they were only prepared to serve bbq chicken and ribs and not yet familiar with the grill.  Not sure, but my meal was on the house. FREE didn't make it better but bearable.   Oh! We ordered the deviled eggs as an appetizer and they were good. But my chicken steak wasn't cooked well, so I ate the sides and stole a rib from my husband.  Food was not as good as the Harlem location, which is weird because the menu is exactly the same. I will wait awhile before I go back and until they get the swing of things.  The managers were prompt and respected my complaint, the bar was great and the restaurant staff pleasant. This is why I will give the BK location another chance.",2.0

"Our recent Dino experience began with waiting on the bartender to finish arguing with her friend / partner / nemesis before she angrily procured our take out order and ended with a night of projectile vomiting during which I relived the waves of black pepper and cayenne pepper that dominated and nearly ruined every overpriced morsel of chicken, pork, beef and macaroni and cheese we ate. The fried green tomatoes were good--at least going down. Not so good coming back up. Egh.",1.0
"i cannot yell enough good things about Dino BBQ. everything we've ever had has been excellent. they have a great beer selection, very good cocktails and their servers are extremely friendly and professional. my husband had ordered the sausage, which was still in the smoker, and not only did the waiter come by multiple times to apologize for the wait, but then the manager came out and apologized and comped us a round of the beer that we were drinking. we had so much food on our plates, that the sausage was totally not a big deal, and the fact that they were so concerned about it even though they knew we were working on our other food was super conscientious, i thought! also, the portions are refreshingly reasonable, so you'll eat and you'll love it, but you won't feel sick and regretfully overfed afterwards.  definitely need a reservation. this place is SLAMMED every time i'm there.",5.0
Great ribs and pork and good brisket.  Still think Hill Country has best BBQ in the city but this is a nice local option for Brooklyn.,4.0
"It is OK but not great. My ribs were better than my companions - his were dry.  My chicken was ok, nothing special. They had some interesting beers available. The mac and cheese was probably the best part of the dining experience.",3.0

"I've been to Dinosaur in Harlem which is a great experience. And I was all excited to hear they've come to Brooklyn. But for the quality of food compared to their horrible, horrendous and rude service, it's not worth it. I ended up waiting over an hour for my food. This is after I was guaranteed that it would only be a ""couple of seconds more"" at the half hour mark. After repeated requests for more info, nothing. And then they told me a new delay of no mash potatoes and that I'd have to wait another 15 minutes unless I wanted something else. WTF. I don't care if it's growing pains, but they need to renovate the service and customer service. Horrendous and not worth it.",2.0
"the food is amazing. I definitely would say the best compared to other BBQ restaurants. I love that it is in park slope as well and do not have to travel to harlem. I have been here several times and the good food is what always drives me back. The service is another story. Typically I am very patient at restaurants (Ive worked in service industry for 10 years) however my visit last night was rather aggravating. I made reservations through open table for party of 4 and ended up being three. The hostess was more then pleasant and fine with it. We sat and waited about ten minutes for drink orders then ten minutes for the drinks and finally ordered. The waitress was not at all pleasant, the amount of stress was clearly showing on her face, and they were not even that busy. The food didn't take long however a different server served us (not a runner). Our server never checked on us and we had to wave her down to order food to go and to drop the check. She then disappeared for another 15 minutes when finally we decided to try and pay by the hostess just so we could get out of there. As I pulled out my credit card she appeared and then that was another 10 minute wait to get it back. I understand busy however she was neglectful, unpleasant and looked extremely aggravated, almost unapproachable.

"We were delighted to find out that a new (closer) location than their Harlem brethren was now at our disposal until our food arrived. We have frequented the harlem location in the past so we expected the same great taste at the new Brooklyn location. To our dismay, and hungry bellies, our high expectations quickly came crashing down.  If your in to BBQ that tastes like it has rolled around in crushed black pepper for the last three days this is the spot for you. Fried green tomatoes were on point but everything else we ordered (wings, ribs, Mac n' cheese, mashed potatoes) was a spicy black pepper MISS!   I have to commend our server though who noticed that I had not touched my food and alerted the manager. When I told him that the food was saturated in black pepper he stated that many patrons have the same complaint. He was very nice and adjusted the bill accordingly. We paid and left with stomachs the same way they arrived... Empty and hungry :(",1.0
Best BBQ around. Well worth the travel into Brooklyn just to get here. Definitely need a reservation or you will be waiting a bit at dinner time. The mac-n-cheese is to die for. I get a double order of the mac-n-cheese just to go with my meal. Lone star off is for mediocre service. The waitress rarely checked back and we waited awhile to get a refill on drinks.,4.0
"Stopped in for a quick takeout,  pulled pork sandwich and mac and cheese.   Disappointed when I opened it up to find that it was not piled high, lacked sufficient sauce and had no pickles.   The pork was nice, melt in your mouth and the mac and cheese had a nice spice to it.   But come on they just opened and they're already serving a sub par sandwich.",2.0
"I usually don't write reviews, but this place was so good I had to share. The food was Amazing !!! I am not a rib person but couldn't pass them up . From the chicken, to the beef, to the sides , the food melted in your mouth so good. A bit of a warning, you might have to wait. We went on a Saturday and waited about an hour. I'd say its worth the wait for sure.",5.0

"I went to school in Syracuse, so I was elated that a Dinosaur BBQ was coming to my neighborhood here in Brooklyn. I was not disappointed! The vibe is a bit different from the original in 'Cuse, but I still really liked it. The beer and drink selection is great and the food was amazing, as good as the original and some of the best 'cue in New York City. While I wouldn't say it's cheap, you get a good amount of food for your money. I was also very impressed with the service. Our server was very good and even split the check for our large group, a nice bonus you rarely find in NYC. I will be going back very soon.",5.0
