"BBQ 4/5: The meats here are pretty respectable; solid bark, fairly strong smoke flavor, good protein-to-fat ratios. I really like the sides of spicy vinegar sauce as well. SIDES 2/5: The potato salad is notable for its mustard vinaigrette but otherwise meh; the collards, as others have noted, are undercooked and bitter. VIBE 3/5: Feels kind of like a knockoff of a cool Brooklyn BBQ joint. The front counter's steam trays with plastic lids don't help. Backyard dining option is a plus.OVERALL 3/5: Not a destination BBQ joint, but a spot I'd visit fairly often if I lived in the neighborhood.P.S. No alcohol but you can BYOB.",3.0
"Hope this is a one time thing... We love this place but today's delivery was way below expectations (and we were really expecting this meal...).The portion of smoked brisket seemed less than what we ordered (though we were reassured on the phone it's not). Still, the brisket was super dry, the bread and sauce scarce... Luckily we ordered Mac n cheese but this is not the service we are accustomed to from this place that usually has the best brisket we've ever eaten... Hope it's a one off...",1.0
*sigh* When Yelp reviews steer you wrong. Everything about Humo felt good at first. I loved the dim lighting and casual seating arrangement. The gentleman that took my order was very accommodating. And it's BYOB!! *heart eyes*But the food. Oy vey. I ordered a 1/4 lb of the pork belly and a side of mac and cheese and was so disappointed. Bland as all get out. The mac and cheese was so incredibly tasteless & I didn't even bother finishing it because it tasted like air. The pork belly was better but not my much. Humo seems to do a brisk business but if you like your  food you know...seasoned...I would suggest visiting elsewhere *sprinkles some adobo on this post*,2.0
"My wife and I are from out of town and decided to go for a walk to find a BBQ joint. Unfortunately I trusted the wife's directions until she got horribly lost, so decided to go to another BBQ joint (which happened to be this one). The guys behind the counter were extremely helpful and accommodating. We ended up ordering some brisket, pulled pork, chicken, coleslaw and mac & cheese. All food was awesome. The coleslaw was a little different to most places but was really nice (maybe a bit too spicy for the wife, but I enjoyed it). Pricing wasn't too bad and would definitely go back if we were lost in the area again",4.0
"At first glance this place was small and smelly. The restaurant smelled like something was burning. Ordered the brisket and pulled pork. Also decided to try the Mac and cheese. The Mac was nothing special, fairly bland. The pulled pork was good but a little dry. The brisket was juicy but a little fatty. The meal also came with little rolls which were soft and delicious. I made sandwiches with both the pork and brisket combined, added their BBQ sauce, and it came out delicious. I couldn't sit in the restaurant for more than 30 minutes because it was way too smokey but otherwise I enjoyed it.",4.0
The service is incredible. The bbq is so darn good. The baked beans are black beans which is so rare for a bbq restaurant (I find!) and they were delicious. My favorite item that we tried was most definitely the pork ribs.,4.0
"I had such high hopes for Humo. A BYOB BBQ joint with great backyard seating? Sign me up!Unfortunately, the BBQ influx in Brooklyn has made me a bit of a snob (well, as much as a northerner can be a snob about smoked meats).Some things you just can't overlook - the food looked like it had been sitting around for a few hours, and not all of it was warm. The brisket (which they cut into chunks instead of slices) was too burnt. They took forever to finish plating our order, which probably also contributed to the coldness.That aside, I liked the chicken and the pork belly. The pork belly was so deliciously fatty.And the guys who work there are, for the most part, nice guys.They have a great backyard that's definitely great for groups.But if you're looking for the best BBQ in Brooklyn... keep looking.",3.0

Minus one star for the minimal side options. I like that they focus on the meat, good for them in not over extending themselves, but if they could just whip up a solid mac & cheese I think they'd be competing with Dino BBQ and the other big guns.",4.0

"I recently started eating poultry again after nearly 10 years of meatlessness, and as long as Humo stands, I will not be a vegetarian. Holy crap this chicken is good. It's fall-off-the-bone, melt-in-your-mouth, smoky, perfectly seasoned, juicy goodness. Collard greens were also garlicky and delicious.I will dream of you, Humo chicken.",5.0
"Impressed. Grass fed meats. A focused menu. The brisket was tender and flavorful. The dry rubbed ribs had a nice bark and cooked to the right doneness. Overall a solid experience. The ribs lacked the punch of smoke I like but these make good eating none the less. The sauce option is a standard and solid sweet sauce and a minimalistic pepper vinegar sauce. I only have tried the coleslaw. It was fine. Grass fed meats makes a big difference in avoiding the post BBQ feed saturated fat hangover. This isn't as experimental in the menu options as the other grass fed option in the city, Fletchers, but I would rather eat Humo. I would be a regular if I lived nearby.",4.0

"BYOB. It's BYOB. It's BBQ. What more do you want me to say? Great flavor in the meat even though it was a little dry (more moist meat would have been 5 stars).

I will sit in the cool backyard area.",4.0
"On one hand,  the ingredients are quality.  There's no getting around that.  The problem is that they have trouble with the concept of seasoning food.  The brisket was well prepared, high quality...and BLAND.  The BBQ sauce had to make it worth eating.  Good brisket only needs sauce as an accompaniment, not as a requirement.  The collard greens were OK.  While not traditional, it somewhat worked.  They just need to sautee them longer and add more cider vinegar.  Lastly, I think the servers were prejudiced.  My large group of people of color (like 15+) had to walk up to the counter to get our food, while the White table next to us got table service.  The place doesn't exactly come off like a supporter of #blacklivesmatter if you get my drift.",3.0
"The meat are so tender and juicy. Had the brisket and pork belly. They were both delicious and beautifully seasoned well.  It's pricey, but worth it. That's the best brisket I have ever had, better than DeFonte's and Fette Sau in Williamsburg. The meat was just incredibly melt in your mouth. I should have ordered a lb of that. I've had pork belly before and this is the first time I enjoyed all the fat from the pork. I was just missing the rice...lol. I'm usually not a fan of the fat from the pork, though I made an exception today....it was of the hook, scrumptious, melt in your mouth so heavenly....lol.Instead of a roll of bread that they give a cornbread instead.

"This place satisfied  my craving for smoked bbq. I had the brisket with the Coleslaw as a side. My friend had the pork belly with smoked black beans.  The brisket was tender and smokey as it should be was easy to cut and fall part . Distinct traits that I look for in good bbq. The Coleslaw was different  than what I have ever had. Instead of the traditional mayo vinegar salt pepper than I make it seem to just be mixed in a peppery vinegar mix. So it has the bitter sour hit of vinegar with the spicy  of pepper afteward.I did try some of my friends food. I must say that the smoked black beans were delicious as was his pork belly which was just as tender as the brisket.  The service was very friendly. The employees were very friendly I only wish I asked their names. The decor is fitting for a smokehouse. Quaint and dimly lit creating a nice atmosphere  at night. The guy we spoke with did tell us that during the spring and summer they will have a bar setup. Curious to see what it will be like I believe it maybe outdoors in the rear as they have outside seating. They do catering, so if u want to have bbq without having to cook it you definitely  can.

Good Smoked Brisket right in the hood! NEVER can beat that! I have come here a few times. As a long time smoker myself...my bar is raised pretty high when it comes to smoking meats. This place is on the right track. Some days are better than others but for the most part i would recommend them. Ribs are decent. I would suggest they look for a different butcher as i wish they could be a but more meatier. I know they can because i can. The chicken is probably the dish i liked the least. The brisket is moist and have that good smokey flavor. The sides...the Kale/Collard greens are OUTSTANDING. Cooks it right there in front of you. Smoked beans are very good. It is getting there.

Came here for lunch with a couple of co workers and the food is delicious.  I had the pulled pork sweet & sour beans. Sooooo good. My co workers had the brisket and the ribs both loved it very much. Oh and the chili is also very good. Highly recommend this place if you're in the for BBQ.,5.0

Good Smoked Brisket right in the hood! NEVER can beat that! I have come here a few times. As a long time smoker myself...my bar is raised pretty high when it comes to smoking meats. This place is on the right track. Some days are better than others but for the most part i would recommend them. Ribs are decent. I would suggest they look for a different butcher as i wish they could be a but more meatier. I know they can because i can. The chicken is probably the dish i liked the least. The brisket is moist and have that good smokey flavor. The sides...the Kale/Collard greens are OUTSTANDING. Cooks it right there in front of you. Smoked beans are very good. It is getting there. Looking forward to the future of this place.,4.0

"Humo Smokehouse changed my life. I know this sounds like hyperbole, but it's not untrue. I mean, it's not that I'm a changed man in any outwardly discernible way. However, deep down, I'll never be the same again, and all because of a couple of takeout orders. The change to which I'm referring is the fact that my expectation for good barbecue has been raised to a level that will make it very difficult for me to enjoy what has always been one of my favorite meals, lest it not reach the high bar set by Humo. I find my mouth watering just trying to describe the experience.I've ordered from this place 3 times so far, and I have yet to be disappointed with a single dish. Everything has been perfectly cooked, perfectly seasoned, and so carefully packaged for delivery that I could completely forget I wasn't eating it fresh from the smoker. So where do I begin ... Let's start with the smoke, actually. Every delicious morsel from the pulled pork to the chicken is infused with that slow cooked smoky goodness that seems to compliment seasoning and the natural flavors of the meat in a way that makes you wonder why you'd want to cook them any other way. It's like putting butter on popcorn. It just works so well that you'll never want it any other way. And speaking of the chicken. I should mention that chicken is my favorite protein. I eat chicken about 4-5 times a week, and this chicken is the reason my life will never be the same. This is the best damned chicken I've ever eaten (sorry mom). And I'm including all of the delicious fried chicken Ive eaten,l which is not even a fair comparison, but this stuff was unlike anything else I've tried before. I'm not even sure how or why but it seems like the smoke intensifies the flavor of chicken while also breaking it down in a way that it just melts in your mouth and ... well I may just have to stop here and go fix myself a snack because writing this review is making me too hungry to keep going. So to make a long story short, Humo Smokehouse is awesome, you should go there, or at least order some.You should do this right away, because once you've done this, you'll fell like you've been wasting your time with all other inferior barbecue. You should try a few things (all the sides were very fresh and tasty too), but for the love of all that is smoky and delicious, you MUST order the chicken. -b",5.0

Take your time choosing from the deceptively short menu and make sure to check out the huge backyard!  My favorites were the beef brisket, stout sauce, and smoky beans.",5.0
"Humo is far tastier than nearby options (e.g. Smoke Joint) and is also cheaper. They have a spacious backyard and the staff are very attentive, even though it's technically a non-waitered venue (someone frequently came out to check on us, offer more--free--bread, etc.) Everyone who works at Humo is very friendly and generous with the portions. To top it all off, they're BYOB, making it even more affordable than it already is.Recommendations: PORK BELLY, baked beans.",5.0
Fantastic! I'm a Southerner and a bbq critic and this place is top notch! They smoke in house and the meat is unbelievably tender and high quality. Super tasty and cheap for what you get. There's a convenience store 2 doors down to buy beer and they'll even hold it in the fridge for you. Such nice folks and great food!,5.0
"Humo is my new favorite spot in the neighborhood when it comes to BBQ, brisket and pulled pork. The place is nice and clean, service is kind and the meat is absolutely delicious. I haven't tried the sides but will go back soon again!",4.0
"If you are sick of the bad service and annually-changed fryers at Smoke Joint and Five Spot, this is the place for Fort Greene BBQ. As soon as you walk in here, true to its name, you get a heavy waft of smoke that makes your mouth water.Most of the meats are quite solid--maybe not the very best, but good-to-very good. As others note, they can be dry on occasion, but for the most part, tender and flavorful. Where this place fails is with the sides. I understand this is interpretive BBQ, but how 'bout a biscuit, for crying out loud? Instead, we get supermarket-quality rolls. Potato salad is forgettable. Cole slaw is not bad, but sliced too thick.I wouldn't put it on par with Van Horn or Georgia BBQ or some of the more famous names, but I intend to keep going back. However, if they can develop a good biscuit, maybe a mac'n cheese, perhaps some kale or non-overcooked collard greens, I could go once a week. I do want to see this place succeed.",3.0
Just moved in the area and this is a great first find. Simple grilled meat! Nicely prepared in a nice environment!,5.0
"A BBQ place must have good sides, and the smoked black beans with delicious meat bits are fantastic.  I'll be back to try the mains.",4.0
"I lived in Austin, Texas for 5 years, and Humo simply makes the best brisket. No competition. There is another BBQ place in the neighborhood, but it's terrible in comparison. The pulled pork, pork belly, chicken are also delicious.",5.0
Great sauces. Good lunch prices. BYOB!!!!Sides are a little spendy. Great addition to the neighborhood. Owners Anna and Reuben are wonderful friendly folks. Come on down. Can't wait until the spring and the backyard opens...,5.0

"Great BBQ. We have now had all of the meats except for the sausage and have been happy with everything.  We like the fact that they use organically raised meats, which means the food isn't overly greasy.  Smoked black beans are tasty but sweet, not my thing but still good. The coleslaw is a nice surprise with a vinegary dressing that is a good accompaniment to the meats.",5.0
"Barbecue brisket to die for, excellent sides, very good prices, extremely accommodating service, and a great backyard.   Need I say more?",5.0
Really awesome addition to the neighborhood.  Very friendly hosts.  We had 1/4lb of  pulled pork and pork belly this am + a 1/2lb of brisket for lunch today.  Everything was perfect and extremely flavorful.  We also really loved the texture of the rolls that comes with the meat and the bbq sauces were the best i've seen in any of the local smokehouses (HC/FS/TSJ etc.).Humo is coming on strong and thats awesome because its 100 steps from my front door!!!  Can't wait to see what they do next.,5.0
"This is a place you go up, order, get it, sit down, and enjoy. Delicious brisket. The ribs were OK. Coleslaw and black beans were great side compliments. I'll definitely be going back again to try to pulled pork and sausage. And to get the coleslaw & beans. Great addition to the neighborhood.",5.0
"Great BBQ, good service. Brisket is out of this world. Better than fette sau! Will say pork butt could be juicier, was a little dry. So if you're reading this Humo...you know what to do...",5.0
"OK I don't eat meat so I am for sure not the best person to review, but having said that I enjoyed some of the sides. My carnivorous companions however were not impressed and made jokes about shooting a pig with a flamethrower or dropping napalm on a cow... I got the impression that they considered the meat overcooked. I guess it is a matter of taste.",3.0
I'm on a serious hunt for the best brisket in nyc.... Humo might be it. Super moist and flavorful. Owners awesome delivered my food himself. Everything was timely and the prices are great. Oh and man oh man are those black beans killer. I'm a fan and totally excited about this addition to the neighborhood... Smoke joint is gonna have to step up their game.,5.0

"Great addition this stretch of Myrtle Avenue. I grew up in Tennessee and this style of BBQ is one of my favorites - they do the basics really well. I ordered pulled pork and brisket to go, and preparation and flavor were top-notch. I look forward to going back and eating in the restaurant, interior was eclectic/cozy.",5.0
"Not bad. We ordered pulled pork, brisket and a sausage + coleslaw and black beans. The seasoning of the pork and brisket was nice and smokey but the texture was a little dry. If they can fix that issue with the dryness, I'd come back. The sausage was spicy and flavorful, though I think a tad pricy for the amount you get. The coleslaw tasted fine but tbh did not look very appetizing--a bit anemic and the cabbage strips were a bit chunky. The black beans were good, though I've had better in a Venezuelan household before. I'd say it's more of 3.5 stars but I think the place has potential, so I'm rounding it up.",4.0

"Side dishes are ""whatever"" (black beans are pretty good). No liquor license.That's the bad news. The good news is, this place has very, very good real barbecue. No ""liquid smoke"". Isn't that why you came by? Seriously, great stuff.Great BBQ sauce. Smells like smoke inside. Great addition to the neighborhood. Once they figure out the kinks of what they're doing, this place could take off. I'll be stopping by on the regular for the brisket and pulled pork.",5.0
"I am SO happy to have a BBQ place in Fort Greene that's better than the mediocre Smoke Joint. While this place might not be the most consistent every time, when it's good (which is most of the time) it hits it out of the park. The pork ribs are excellent, the chicken is great... sides are delicious too. There a cute patio out in back as well. I hope it sticks around because the location's a bit off the beaten track of Myrtle. Please support this place!!!!",5.0
