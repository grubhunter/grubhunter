"Where do I start with this wonderful decorative restaurant!?!  I was here two Sundays ago for their ""bottomless"" brunch with 4 friends and I have to say, I was highly impressed!  I made a reservation that same Friday so it was a welcomed surprise to know that they weren't booked up like most bottomless brunch establishments are on weekends.  I guess being that Miti Miti is still farely new, the hype and buzz about this place hasn't gotten out completely.  Well lucky for me because I will be coming here quite often for more bottomless brunches!  Let's start with the ""Bottomless"", one word delicious and different.  You get a wide variety of different flavored mimosas (lavender, mango, lychee, and pomegranate) lavender was my absolute favorite!  You can also choose from 3 different types of Sangria (red, white, or green) & the green comes with a lychee in it!  Loved it!  We never worried about our glasses being empty long because our server Kara was on top of it all and on point.  She suggested the lavender mimosa and said it was her favorite and I know why!  She was very attentive and friendly which we all loved!  The food was very tasty and delicious as well!  Their chips and guac was really good and flavorful!  I had avocado toast which I also enjoyed very much.  My main brunch dish was Fried chicken wings and waffles.  I have to say that the waffles were cooked nicely and were fluffy and delicious.  The chicken wings were flavored nicely but they were a little on the thin frail side, not very meaty.  I would've preferred meatier wings.  My friend had the breakfast tacos which were very good as well (I had a bite of course)After we ate our awesome meals we headed over to the bar and ordered a few drinks!  I had a coconut mojito and a tamarind mojito!  Both were so good! Overall it's a great place to come with friends or on a date to talk, laugh, and enjoy some high quality drinks and some tasty food.  I definitely recommend it!  I'll actually be back again for brunch this Saturday!  =D",5.0
"My boyfriend and I sat at the bar to have some cocktails and appetizers. Diego, the bartender, was super friendly and made the best drinks. I had a coconut mojito to start and it was EVERYTHING. My boyfriend started off with the cilantro margarita and it was nothing short of fantastic.The guacamole is fresh and tasty and the salmon tar tar was delicious.I loved the food, the drinks, the service and the ambiance.",5.0
"Fantastic food and prices are not outrageous. We came here for a group dinner, and the waitstaff was accommodating and attentive.We ordered a ton of appetizers and some entrees to share, family style, and everything we tried was quite good! Service is A+. The servers are very nice and friendly, and our waters were constantly refilled. We actually had several servers tending to our table, bringing us extra chips, etc. And, they put up with our rowdy bunch. Favorites: - BRUSSEL SPROUTS. I don't know how they turn this vegetable into a crunchy, juicy heaven nugget, but they did. Don't miss this one.- Shishito Peppers. 1 in 10 is supposed to be spicy, and I can't handle spicy food so I was biting carefully, but we only got 1 spicy one, and the rest were just deliciously broiled and yummy!-  Bacon wrapped dates- GUACAMOLE. It is fantastic, perfectly seasoned and fresh. Top notch. - CORN.  Great seasoning. Negatives: We also tried the deviled eggs, which were fine, but kind of boring. The [red] Sangria was good enough, nothing to write home about but tasted nice. Some of the portions were on the small side (the bacon wrapped dates, corn come to mind). Brussel  sprouts was a a good size portion and I sneakily ate it all myself. THEY'RE SO GOOD.Will definitely come back again and again.",5.0
"The hospitality, cocktails, decor deserves 5 stars.    The food makes it go down to a 3 definitely needs more work first time here me and a fellow friend decided to share appetizers which we did lobster quesadillas was more cheese than anything I didn't even see or taste a lobster felt like I was eating a grilled cheese , lamb empanaditas were ok! A tad dry if it wasn't for the dipping sauce, which was a bit strange couldn't quite figure what it was. Salmon tartare I was really excited to try this dish and it disappointed me guacamole overpowered the taste of the salmon I must say to much guacamole I feel like I was having guacamole and chips last but not least my favorite were the peppers loved the seasoning so good! But hope miti miti works on their dishes. I will definitely be returning for the cocktails and to check out miti miti taco Tuesday night.",3.0
"Opted to go here before a concert at Barclays. It gets really crowded by the arena so we were so happy to find Miti Miti on Yelp and it was only a few blocks away. We wanted drinks and light fare. We got 4 apps: Jerk seasoned street corn, bacon wrapped dates with blue cheese, wings, and Brussel sprouts. The food was awesome! Why? It was flavorful, perfect sized, and came out, hot. I appreciate that. Drinks were perfect and it was happy hour too. We got 4 apps, 2 vodka drinks, 2 margaritas and it was $65. Service was attentive and courteous and overall, it was the perfect combination of reasons why people like to dine out. Will definitely return.",4.0
"This was my second time here. First time came with my bf when it was pretty new and we had tapas. Since then the menu has changed. I suggested this place to my friend for her birthday HH which was on a Tuesday. Miti Miti has a great HH special on Tuesdays. There are several drinks options on the HH until 11pm! In addition it was Taco Tuesday and there were several different taco options. The drinks were really good and so were the tacos. You have to try the green sangria. The décor of the restaurant is very cute, not a big space but large enough to fit groups comfortably. It does have a bar if you only want to hang out at the bar. Our waitress was very nice and accommodating as our group grew as the night progressed. I will be back to try their boozy brunch.",4.0
"The biggest problem you'll have at Miti Miti is trying to figure out what NOT to order. We wanted everything. But the way our checking account is set up...As soon as we walked in the restaurant, we knew it was going to be a great night. The ambiance is on Level: Sexy! Service on point. The menu options -- straight up food porn! For dinner, we ordered and devoured: - Honeydripper Baked Goat Cheese - what sorcery of simple delicous-ness is this? - Miso Glazed Baked Tofu - #yeslawd- Shrimp and Chorizo Mac and Cheese (so sad panda I couldn't have any)- Chimichurri Streak Frites - meatarians were about it- Patatas fritas - this was unanimously the one disappointing dish. Potatoes were delish but there wasn't enough aoili sauce and it was a bit lacking in flavor. Despite the gluttony, we made room for the Bogota Tres Leche Cake. Worth it, DO IT! The white sangria is quite an exotic treat. Lavender, passion fruit, ginger and elderflower?! Yes please! The bonus is its potency. It goes from drink to drAnk real quick! Tip: Call if you can't find your preferred time slot via the online reservation system. Sometimes the time slot is available -- which was the case for us on a very busy Saturday night.",5.0
"My boyfriend took me here for my birthday earlier this week. My first thought was ""hmm, why here? I've never mentioned this place"" (and I'm always talking about food). Well, after arriving to Miti Miti, I get it. Miti Miti is a sister restaurant to Bogota just across the street but with a more intimate, romantic vibe and fun murals painted on the walls.We came in on a Monday night and it looked pretty empty. However, as we walked through the restaurant, we noticed another dining area located near the kitchen and this is where we sat. They have great happy hours prices (and time!) here and a lot of their small eats caught my eye. I end up picking about 6 appetizers before I even got to the entrees (and thus no entrees for the night). That was fine with me because I was incredibly full by the end of the dinner. Here's what we ordered:Bacon Wrapped Dates: Lots of different flavors; sweet, salty, and cheesy. I don't know if the combination was that great but it still was tasty.Jamaican Street Corn: my favorite of the night. The toasted coconut flakes on top was a good touch to give the dish a sweeter touch.Deviled Eggs: my boyfriend's favorite of the night. I highly recommended this!Shrimp & Chorizo Mac and Cheese: great flavors (with a nice sear of burnt cheese on top). The orzo didn't really do it for me but the flavors were there.Patatas Bravas: What I would call their version of tater tots. Chunks of potatoes topped with a spicy aioli sauce.Pork Belly Tacos: 2 tacos served in a soft tortilla. I really enjoyed the lime juice flavor in the pork belly.While the food was amazing, the service was even better. A random server walked by and saw us looking at one of their sauces. He came over and gave us a short introduction what kind of sauce it is (home made mind you) and what it is generally used for. He even moved 2 tables together for us because he didn't want us to be too cramped with all our food (Aww!). He continuously made jokes with us throughout our time there and made sure we were having a good time. Would I come back here? Definitely! Good service is hard to find in New York and I really applaud them for that. Also, there are still many dishes I want to try (roasted cauliflower I'm looking at you!) so yes I would be coming back here again soon.",4.0
"I had a lovely NYE dinner last night with two friends. It's a cool menu with a great selection of snacks and appetizers to share around the table. No one even bothered to order an entree. We started with the BBQ chicken nachos, which were delicious and was a surprisingly big portion. After the appetizer I decided to go with the bacon wrapped dates. Between those two, I was pretty full. I like the drink selection, but once I actually ordered and tasted them, I felt like both drinks (mai tai & moscow Mule) were too syrupy sweet. I also didn't like that the Strawberry Moscow Mule did not come in the copper mug.Overall I think it's a decent place with reasonably priced food. One thing I didn't like was that they had daily specials advertised on their website, but informed us there were no specials for NYE. Which is fine, but they probably should have said as much on the website.I would still come back to check out their happy hour specials.",4.0
"Here's what I think. There is a lot of good about this place. First off. I had a great experience with the service. Hostess, waitress, bus boys and everyone else was super nice and attentive. Not overly attentive either. Segundo. The food was pretty good. I don't really understand the menu, seemed all over the place. Tacos and Deviled eggs; Mac and cheese and only 4 entrees or so. The drinks were tasty and they definitely have options. Worth checking out for sure.",4.0
"Ohh so good in a beautiful space. Thank you for the great service last Saturday for my friend's birthday celebration. All seven ladies enjoyed the service, drinks and food. I came opening week and will be back again and again!",4.0
"What a great spot for date night. We were seated quickly upon arrival and our waitress was friendly and eager to take our drink order. It was crowded but my table for two had personality and a candle added warmth and drowned out the chatter. The drinks was grown and sexy, the green sangria, the pink elephant garnished with sprigs of rosemary, and a red wine which I found dry. $5.00 on selected drinks including Sangria for happy hour which is 5 p.m. to close. The green and red sangria had me giggling and tipsy. For appetizers we ordered spicy deviled eggs which were definitely spicy, delicious, and beautifully decorated $6.00 for an 3 pieces of egg not 3 eggs. The lamb burger which was cooked at my requests to a medium rare and fried potatoes were awesome, the menu selection is eccentric... lobster quesadillas. The bar area is sexy, the neon pink lighting is inviting, and they were playing Chaka Khan on the mp3. Yes, Chaka Khan. Winning.",5.0
"I have mixed feelings.On one hand food was delicious and absolutely everything we tried was perfect.On another - service was terrible. Our waiter was so slow - it is not even funny.It took him 10 minutes to bring me a shot of tequila. 10 minutes!!!

They brought everything together.But... we had some entertainment (don't count on it since it doesn't happen often, I hope). At some point a bartender approached one of the waiters and they started a fight! Other waiters momentarily took them apart and bartender went back to the bar while a waiter was taken to the kitchen.That was fun!!!So I'd give this place 3 stars (a disgusting service ruined everything) but considering watching UFC fight - 4 stars. :)",4.0
I don't know why I gave their delivery a 3rd time or pre-tipped as I wished that I had not done either.  While the food is tasty the delivery took almost 2 hours so the food was all cold.  Stay away from the key lime pie as its nothing more than cream with lime flavoring for $9.  That was a rip off but the tacos and corn are good.,3.0

"We came here for a drink and guacamole and sat at the bar. The drink (a margarita) was good and strong. The restaurant was nearly empty but it took over 10 minutes for the guacamole to arrive. All that was ok- my main complaint is with the Bernie Bro who was working the bar. I was having a conversation with my girlfriend about one of her friends voting for Sanders, when completely uninvited, the bartender comes over and enters the conversation with ""everyone should vote for Bernie"". Then, continues -despite my girlfriend and I giving curt replies, clearly wanting to sit and enjoy a drink, not engage in slightly aggressive political discourse- for 5 minutes to make condescending baiting comments like ""do you even KNOW Bernie's record?"" ""Do you seriously think voting for the Iraq war was a good idea?"". Nah, dude. I'm loving your assumption that I have no idea what I'm talking about. Please explain the workings of the world to me.

"Miti Miti is the sister restaurant to Bogota Latin Bistro. Miti Miti means half and half in spanish. Another trend in NYC are the ever growing amount tapas bars. I recommend coming here for happy hour, all their drinks are half off and you can try their tapas for a lower price but in smaller portions. You usually have to sit at the bar to obtain the happy hour special but our server was able to make an exception for us. Even though I've been to Spain, I've never seen or heard of green sangria and boy have I been missing out! My usual go to is white sangria but the green one was even better! It was slightly more sweet. A single glass is pretty big so expect to get bubbly after one glass, wink wink. The pork belly tacos took me by surprise. It was more like braised shredded pork than the usual pork belly I'm used to. I asked the server about this and she said the pork belly is actually braised for long time and then the meat gets tender enough that they shred it into pieces. I wish the tacos were more saucy, the meat was tender but it could've been better if there was sauce in it. The most tasty part about pork belly is the fat, yet I didn't taste any of it at all in the tacos. The meat wasn't even juicy. The chorizo shrimp mac and cheese could've had more shrimp, the dish would've been better if there was truffle. The Jamaican corn was alright, I prefer the Mexican corn from Café Habana more. I wish the cheese was melted so it didn't fall off the corn after every bite I took. My least favorite was the bacalao croqueta, it was too fishy for my taste. All in all, I'd say it was only worth it for happy hour. It's not worth paying the full price for it. P.S. Don't forget to check in on Yelp for a free drink!",3.0

I did enjoy the steak skewers, and the shrimp & sausage macaroni & cheese, can't say I absolutely loved it, but it was my favorite out of the things we ordered. The red snapper tacos were just okay, nothing special, actually they tasted like nothing, the cod fish balls, had a very strong lemon flavor. The pulled chicken nachos were ok.

"2 hour boozy brunch!Came to Miti Miti which by the way is the sister restaurant to Bogota. The menu is totally different than Bogota and so is the vibe so don't worry you will not feel like your going to the same restaurant. This place has a totally different menu, food, lighting and decor from Bogota. Anyhow the brunch was really good. To start we had the bacalao croquettes which I really liked. Also tried the lobster quesadilla which was pretty good as well. For my entree I chose the cornmeal chicken sandwich with a side of fries. The sandwich was really good I must say. I enjoyed every bit of it and was stuffed after.  For dessert we had the tres leches which was nice and sweet. And last but not least the booz! I decided to go with the green Sangria. It tasted really good and in the 2 hrs I was able to have 3 hardy glasses and was feelin' a little buzzed after. They have a nice selection of drinks to choose from including beer, sangria, mimosas etc and might I add that they come in different flavors as well. The next time I come back I want to try the lavender mimosa. The service was slow but they were nice. I think as they get into the swing if this brunch thing they will become more attentive, at least I hope. I would definitely recommend this for groups as well!",4.0
"I really love this place but I had a weird experience the other day when I went for brunch. The waiter would disappear for a while and wasn't attentive, but the ""bottomless"" mimosas last for 1.5 hours. We had been waiting 25 minutes for our last mimosa, and the waiter said oops sorry I'll bring them over and winked, and then the manager hunted him down and said it had been more than 1.5 hours so that was it. If it hadn't been for slow service, I wouldn't have a problem with that but it was frustrating.In general this place is great. The menu is a bizarre variety of foods, but the guac and the mac and cheese were good. My friend got the egg tacos for brunch and they were pretty small. But their drinks are incredible and the bartenders are fantastic.",4.0
"I like this restaurant. The interior is absolutely beautiful and very chic. It can be a great spot for a date, a small get together with friends, or even a special event. What I like about this place the most is that although it is affiliated with another restaurant nearby (or owned by the same people, maybe), it has it's own personality and the menu is completely different. It's a tad pricier but with good reason; the menu is designed in such a way that it incorporates flavors from all over.  I stuck with two appetizers. I had the skirt steak skewers and the bacalao croquetas which I really enjoyed, and I took advantage of the happy hour special (which I heard is amazing from another customer that very night) and had a pink elephant. It was different, but it was good. I also had some of the K-Town Skirt Steak with the kimchee fried rice. The steak was perfect. The fried rice was rather spicy, but it was my first time every having such a dish so I had no idea what to expect. It was good, though. The fried egg was a nice touch. I didn't find the mango necessary, but that's just me. I also tried the jalapeño lemonade (I forgot what it was called) which was great! I do not like jalapeños very much, but the drink had just the right amount of kick. The server was knowledgeable and very helpful. This place is great, though. I'll definitely be back.",4.0
"This place deserves more than 5 stars!! Excellent food, service, drinks, and service!!!  The food is a little bit of a fusion of Latin and Korean.Of course we had to order a little bit of everything to try:Chicken Wings - spicy, crispy and sweet.

"The celebration of my wife's 30th birthday brought us to this little spot in Brooklyn with some friends and family. The very first thing I had to try was the green sangria. It is as good as most people state in their reviews. We ended up purchasing two pitchers (I think, maybe there was third?). The wait staff was great and I only took a star from the restaurant because their jerk wings were more like fried wings glazed with a jerk sauce which is unacceptable for folks like myself with roots in the West Indies. The bbq chicken nachos are a must try. My boy ordered some and when I tried it I had to order my own. I also ordered the deviled eggs which were amazing!!!  My main course which was the short ribs was way too fatty, but our waitress took it back and removed it from our bill. Great place to hang out, eat and get some drinks on a weekend. Miti Miti has my stamp of approval.",4.0

"Went with the wife for brunch since we had eaten at their sister restaurant Bogota 3 nights prior and had seen the advertisement.Out food was excellent.  My wife ordered the fish tacos, which she absolutely loved, save for the jalapeno on top of each.  I had the arepa benedict which comes with poached eggs on top of a sweet corncake covered in chorizo gravy.  It was out of this world.I'm rating this 3 stars strictly based on the service.  It seems like despite our seating location (right next to hostess station), things were very slow.  The restaurant was filled, but not full, yet the food took nearly 40 minutes to arrive.  A bus person took our plates away and asked us if we'd like desert menus. 10 minutes later we'd yet to receive them, and he's joking around at the bar.  When we finally got them, we ordered from our server and at the same time requested the check.  We eventually received our dessert, but of course the check was not with it.  Once we got the check, they were very slow in running my credit card, which was just hanging around inside its folder and the host station with no one even bothering to run it.Not happy.",3.0
"Let's start off with this was delivery, in seamless the minimum delivery tip is $9 which I feel is ridiculous, especially to just deliver food, I honestly tip my delivery people well, usually $5 but $9 minimum is excessive. The food did come quick, and it was warm, that's a plus, my husband ordered a whole bunch of stuff, which too me was really expensive $100 for takeout. I did enjoy the steak skewers, and the shrimp & sausage macaroni & cheese, can't say I absolutely loved it, but it was my favorite out of the things we ordered. The red snapper tacos were just okay, nothing special, actually they tasted like nothing, the cod fish balls, had a very strong lemon flavor. The pulled chicken nachos were ok. I honestly think for the amounts they charge that the food would have been delicious, unfortunately I was disappointed.",2.0
"Came here for happy hour on a Thursday after coming from Brooklyn boulders, they had frozen margaritas, sangria and beer on the happy hour menu, there were some appetizers on the happy hour menu but I went for the snack menu and got the bbq seasoned fries which were just right and the deviled eggs which were decent, overall this is a good spot to have some drinks and some small snacks, I didn't look too hard at the dinner menu",4.0
"Ordered delivery and there was a hair BAKED INTO the crust of my pie. Normally I give benefit of the doubt that a hair is mine when eating, but my hair was wrapped up in a towel and the hair was literally baked through the pie crust. If I hadn't dismantled filling from pie, I wouldn't have seen it. Just kind of kills a place for me.",2.0
"2 hour boozy brunch!Came to Miti Miti which by the way is the sister restaurant to Bogota. The menu is totally different than Bogota and so is the vibe so don't worry you will not feel like your going to the same restaurant. This place has a totally different menu, food, lighting and decor from Bogota. Anyhow the brunch was really good. To start we had the bacalao croquettes which I really liked. Also tried the lobster quesadilla which was pretty good as well. For my entree I chose the cornmeal chicken sandwich with a side of fries. The sandwich was really good I must say. I enjoyed every bit of it and was stuffed after.  For dessert we had the tres leches which was nice and sweet. And last but not least the booz! I decided to go with the green Sangria. It tasted really good and in the 2 hrs I was able to have 3 hardy glasses and was feelin' a little buzzed after. They have a nice selection of drinks to choose from including beer, sangria, mimosas etc and might I add that they come in different flavors as well. The next time I come back I want to try the lavender mimosa. The service was slow but they were nice. I think as they get into the swing if this brunch thing they will become more attentive, at least I hope. I would definitely recommend this for groups as well!",4.0
"I really love this place but I had a weird experience the other day when I went for brunch. The waiter would disappear for a while and wasn't attentive, but the ""bottomless"" mimosas last for 1.5 hours. We had been waiting 25 minutes for our last mimosa, and the waiter said oops sorry I'll bring them over and winked, and then the manager hunted him down and said it had been more than 1.5 hours so that was it. If it hadn't been for slow service, I wouldn't have a problem with that but it was frustrating.In general this place is great. The menu is a bizarre variety of foods, but the guac and the mac and cheese were good. My friend got the egg tacos for brunch and they were pretty small. But their drinks are incredible and the bartenders are fantastic.",4.0
"I like this restaurant. The interior is absolutely beautiful and very chic. It can be a great spot for a date, a small get together with friends, or even a special event. What I like about this place the most is that although it is affiliated with another restaurant nearby (or owned by the same people, maybe), it has it's own personality and the menu is completely different. It's a tad pricier but with good reason; the menu is designed in such a way that it incorporates flavors from all over.  I stuck with two appetizers. I had the skirt steak skewers and the bacalao croquetas which I really enjoyed, and I took advantage of the happy hour special (which I heard is amazing from another customer that very night) and had a pink elephant. It was different, but it was good. I also had some of the K-Town Skirt Steak with the kimchee fried rice. The steak was perfect. The fried rice was rather spicy, but it was my first time every having such a dish so I had no idea what to expect. It was good, though. The fried egg was a nice touch. I didn't find the mango necessary, but that's just me. I also tried the jalapeño lemonade (I forgot what it was called) which was great! I do not like jalapeños very much, but the drink had just the right amount of kick. The server was knowledgeable and very helpful. This place is great, though. I'll definitely be back.",4.0
"This place deserves more than 5 stars!! Excellent food, service, drinks, and service!!!  The food is a little bit of a fusion of Latin and Korean.Of course we had to order a little bit of everything to try:Chicken Wings - spicy, crispy and sweet. YUMSalmon tartare - really fresh, good but had to squeeze some lime on it.Shrimp and Chorizo Mac n Cheese - it is actually an orzo and cheese but still delicious, the cheese at the top was toasted just right to give a little CRUNCHShort RIbs - my FAV, topped with a watermelon saladdd, so amazing!Pork Chops- meh, too salty and the flavors just didn't match up.  I think it came with like a berry topping and stuffing.  Fish Tacos - crispy flaky fish.  I was stuffed at this point but still found it tasty.I had the watermelon drink with rosemary, refreshing and strong!Pretty on the inside, nice big seating area and our waiter and wait staff was very attentive!",5.0
"The celebration of my wife's 30th birthday brought us to this little spot in Brooklyn with some friends and family. The very first thing I had to try was the green sangria. It is as good as most people state in their reviews. We ended up purchasing two pitchers (I think, maybe there was third?). The wait staff was great and I only took a star from the restaurant because their jerk wings were more like fried wings glazed with a jerk sauce which is unacceptable for folks like myself with roots in the West Indies. The bbq chicken nachos are a must try. My boy ordered some and when I tried it I had to order my own. I also ordered the deviled eggs which were amazing!!!  My main course which was the short ribs was way too fatty, but our waitress took it back and removed it from our bill. Great place to hang out, eat and get some drinks on a weekend. Miti Miti has my stamp of approval.",4.0

"This place was great! Found it via Yelp. If you check-in you can get a free taste of a cocktail (of the sangrias).The decor: this is absolutely such a cute, chic place! I loved the decor. The high green chairs, and the lighting was beautiful--along with the fun paintings on the wall. They have a happy hour as well where some of their drinks are 2-3$ off. We started off with cocktails. I had the rosemary grapefruit gin + tonic and my friend had the lavender grapefruit paloma--both of which were very good!For tapas, we ordered some olives, bacalao croquetas, shrimp and chorizo mac and cheese, and korean pork belly tacos. Also shared a heirloom farro salad. My friend really liked the salad--it was fresh and had a nice array of vegetables.The croquetas weren't too memorable but still tasted yummy. I liked the presentation of the korean pork belly tacos and I loved loveddd the mac and cheese!I liked the sweetness of the korean pork belly tacos but perhaps it would have been better on a soft tortilla.

"We made a night-of reservation on OpenTable and got seated immediately. The ambiance and decor is bright and colorful, to say the least.

I stopped by early to find out about their happy hour prices and the staff was so helpful and pleasant, I knew I was making the right decision to have bday drinks and tapas before a night of bday shenanigans.LOVE Sofia and Shay who took care of us and made the whole night so enjoyable. THE FOOOOOOOOOOD IS SOO GOOD and the drinks were perfect.I couldn't have chosen a better place to celebrate my birthday with friends.",5.0
"What a gem from the folks behind Bogota. Have not had a bad meal here, and have not even had a bad dish here. The food is top notch, the ambiance is really fun and festive, a good place for groups. Highly recommend the following dishes:-octopus appetizer with fingerling potatoes and a tasty salsa verde, surprisingly tender and well-executed-miso kale / apple salad (best salad ever, coming from someone who doesn't really like salad)-steak skewers, simple but delicious-patatas bravas, with a great smoked paprika spicingThe service is pretty good, even if they tend to have less-than-experienced servers, they all mean well and try hard. Drinks are pretty good too - especially their brunch sangrias and mimosa variants with lots of fun juices (mango, lychee, etc.) - good deal at $12 for bottomless 1.5 hrs.",5.0
"Tonight we were there around 5PM and it was empty so we were somewhat nervous since it was our first time eating here. We were lucky because it was happy hour (4-7PM?). Lets just say that after our first drink and some tapas we were glad we came. We had the Bacon Wrapped Dates, Charred Spanish Octopus,  Lamb Empanaditas, Arepitas de Chocolo and theSalmon Tartare Guacamole. The sangria was also very nice. Try it, the food is great and so is the service",5.0
We went for an early dinner here last week (with kids) and the staff was very accommodating and speedy with our service. The food was tasty and I'd definitely go back under similar circumstances. The mac and cheese was delicious as were the Brussels sprouts.,3.0
"First time going but my date and I had a good time.Pros - very unique set of food. Quite good. I had the Moroccan pasta dish with shrimp (only 4 medium shrimp but the server had the courtesy to tell me ahead of time) that was very flavorful, and my fiance had the miso tofu dish that was delicious. Service was very good (Chris), was attentive and gave light banter and knew the menu well.Cons - A very 'hipster' feel - lot of neon lighting and fancy looking bar. Price was a little on the high side but thinking about it I think the couple extra dollars was worth it for the extra presentation and flavors of the dishes. The price issue might just be a by-product of many tapas places - tapas + drinks + entrees... tends to add up.Overall, a good place that I recommend!",4.0
Yummy small plates and even yummier cocktails. Great for winding down after work -- they have happy hour M-Th all night long.,5.0
"This place is a must try! I have been 3 times now and was originally lured in by the samples of jalapeño lemonade they were serving outside. Yes, jalapeño lemonade!! Just genius and delicious. I've never actually had their dinner but I usually sit at the bar and order their small plates and cocktails. My favourite cocktail is the pink elephant with vodka, lemon, watermelon juice and Rosemary! Happy hour is also a great deal - 7$ drinks and 5$ small plates (such as deviled eggs, mushroom croquettes). I also always order the Jamaican corn (6$ regular price) which is one cob served in 2 pieces on a skewer (easy for eating). The seasoning on the corn is very unique (coconut, spices etc.) - I highly recommend. Few reasons why this place gets a 5 star - I can physically see the staff behind the bar hand squeezing limes, prepping cocktail ingredients, slicing decorative cucumbers. I love a detail oriented place that puts time and care into the little things. Also I've gotten free shots by checking in on yelp - always a positive in my books. Service is attentive and decor and ambience is simple but fun. But what I really like about this place is the staff. My first visit I was offered a free cocktail that they were designing behind the bar. They asked my input and what they should call it (this was right around when they opened the restaurant - so I guess they were still designing the menu). And my second time, I was closing the place down with some friends, no one else was in the restaurant - they didn't rush us or kick us out and they let us plug our iPhones into the speakers to choose the music. If there were 6 stars they would get it - all in all, they get high scores in all my critical categories. bravo!",5.0
"I've been interested in checking this place out for awhile now since I'm a huge fan of Bogota. So I finally got a chance to check it out last night with a few friends. The ambiance is very trendy and inviting. We sat at the bar where we were attended to by an incredibly friendly, knowledgable, and attentive bartender. I really enjoy the green sangria. My friends tried a few of the different tapas and no one went away disappointed. The only downfall is they close kind of early which will hopefully change once business picks up. Can't wait to go back though!",5.0
"Wow. We visited NY and were walking around looking for a place for dinner when we spotted Miti Miti. A bystander remarked that it was really good so we tried it. WOW!Great food. Great atmosphere. The owner met us as we were among the first few in the place. Very nice, great place. We will come back whenever in Brooklyn. Now for the food:Cevice- Incredible. Not overpowering, seasoned like I've never experienced. The best Cevice I've ever had. Jamaican corn- Awesome. Coconut shavings with Mexican style seasoning. Steak on a stick (wife ordered so I don't know what it's called)- Perfect steak. Seasoned to perfection. None better. Lobster quesadilla- My favorite!

"FINALLY a tapas place in Park Slope. This place is so cute on the inside and the food is up to par! My boyfriend and I came in during ""brunch"" time and though they're menu doesn't have brunch yet, they had great selections. We ordered a few tapas plates and a couple large items to fulfill our appetites and all were great!The chorizo and shrimp mac n cheese is made with orzo pasta, and has the best cheese mixes: feta, manchego, and one more that escapes me. The pork belly tacos are slightly sweet but the pickled onions on the side balance that out perfectly. The have happy hour on Saturdays.. I'm sure just to bring people in for now, but that's still awesome. The bartender was not shy with pours and the glasses are nice and big. The rum punch is a good one! They're apple and cheese empanada sounded amazing but was way too full to try it, so we'll be back for that one!",5.0
"A bit pricey, but then again, when is tapas not pricey?M-W: Happy hour is ALL NIGHT! WHAT? Try the sangrias! They're $8 during HH which isn't the greatest deal but they pack a punch.

We had time to kill while waiting for our reservation at Bogota, which we found out is a sister restaurant. The bartender Diego was chatty and nice, and taught us how to make the drink we were fawning over. I highly recommend this lemonade (also as a cocktail) if you like spicy things. We had the fried chickpeas which were decent. We also tried another drink, I think a passion fruit or guava drink, it was orange, from the tap and really sweet. That was delicious as well.Although we only had drinks I would try the food here after a good experience.",4.0

So on to the review..Pros- The atmosphere is very cool and modern, the service was spot on and attentive, the drink menu had a very interesting variety.. and the star of the night was the delicious honey jerk wings.. oh-so-good.Cons- The size of the drinks( I had the pink elephant..very good but rather small), the mussels were lacking in flavor and the bread that came along was so charred it was burnt, the bacalao and potato croquettes were just o.k, the aioli it came with was rather salty..All in all, I may go back to Miti Miti, maybe try something else on their menu..  or enjoy their happy hour drinks.",3.0
I absolutely love Miti Miti. I had my first taste from a hoime delivery but just had to go inside the restaurant because I wanted this amazing food again! The service was amazing.  It is a small spot but organized well for patrons. The food is sooooo good.  I cannot wait to go back.,5.0

"Been twice since it opened, once for drinks/tapas, and once for brunch. The staff is friendly, drinks are nice, bright decor... but generally overpriced, not much of a crowd, inconsistent service, and although some of the plates are good, nothing that really stands out. One thing we will never forget though is the awful ""broken eggs"" brunch item that was two sunny side up eggs on a plate of CHIPS. No warning from the menu or the server (who recommended it). Was completely unexpected, very disappointing, and pretty much ensured we are not likely to go back for brunch at least.**We love Bogota though!! Never fails us -- that's the spot.",2.0

"Great staff, awesome vibe.  I love their attention to detail with when they serve drinks and your food.  You will not be disappointed.  Tonight I had the red sangria and my bf just had a beer but even though the bar was full still worked it well and kept our thirst buds quenched.",5.0
"I hosted a dinner here on a Monday night with a group of 8, it's one of my best experiences in Park Slope, the beer, cocktails were great, highly recommend the Hite! The tapas were happy-hour all day, $5 each, and the rest of the menu was delish. My guests were so happy with the dinner, the fish tacos, devil eggs, mushroom croquettes, lamb & honeydripped cheese, skewer steaks, watermelon salad, peach & cheese salad, etc, yum! It wasn't very packed, so we were able to have very good conversations. Great place for friends.",5.0
"I was convinced to try this place after having a delicious sample of jalapeno lemonade on the street. We had time to kill while waiting for our reservation at Bogota, which we found out is a sister restaurant. The bartender Diego was chatty and nice, and taught us how to make the drink we were fawning over. I highly recommend this lemonade (also as a cocktail) if you like spicy things. We had the fried chickpeas which were decent. We also tried another drink, I think a passion fruit or guava drink, it was orange, from the tap and really sweet. That was delicious as well.Although we only had drinks I would try the food here after a good experience.",4.0
Lovely !!  Good service !! Good food  :) nice environment ! Definitely recommend you to give it a try,5.0

"Last night, I went to Miti Miti for the fourth and last time. I live in the neighborhood and was with my father and sister who just came to Brooklyn to visit. We tried to go to Bogota (which I frequent and LOVE), but the wait was long. When the host suggested we go to Miti Miti, I didn't want to. From my previous experiences, I felt the food was tasty, but portions were tiny and the service was always very awkward- overall, just not a great value. But my visitors were starving and when I expressed disinterest to the Bogota host, he assured me that they made a lot of changes and additions to the menu, so we gave it a shot. It's always funny when you go to a restaurant and there's visibly tons of tables available, but the hostess tries to act like finding you a table is going to be a real pickle (""oh.. You don't have a reservation?!?!.. Hmmmm!"") Maybe she just couldn't decide which vacant table to choose. Anyway. It took about 40 minutes to even get our guacamole appetizer, so there's that. In the mean time, shortly after my father got his glass of wine, his hand bumped into it and it spilled all over his empty plate, his sweater, and his lap- the glass didn't break or make a mess on the floor, but I felt bad because he was so embarrassed! Someone from the restaurant came over and wiped it up and said ""I'll get you a new one."" I assumed he was going to get him a new glass of wine, but that didn't happen. In fact, it wasn't until decades later when the entrees arrived when anyone asked if he even wanted a new drink after his entire glass of wine had spilled. On the bill, we were charged for both glasses. I honestly have no words for how tacky this is.Everyone knows it's no fun to spill a drink- it's embarrassing, you mess up your clothes, and you don't have anything to drink anymore! During my experience in the service industry, if someone spills something, you get them a new one and try to help them feel less embarrassed. It's the Nice and decent thing to do. Overall, this just furthered my feeling that Miti Miti is a poor value with staff who desperately need a crash course in Customer Service 101. Even if the food and atmosphere have potential, being treated poorly sure can leave a bad taste in your mouth. I hadn't seen my dad and sister in a month, and I ended up feeling upset and super disappointed that I took them to Miti Miti.",2.0
"Delicious food in an unforgettable interior. I generally enjoyed my time, and thanks to great recommendations, I was able to have some of the best items on the menu. The most memorable was the Pink Elephant Drink (too good), and the Korean BBQ Steak w/ Side Salad. I would recommend this restaurant to any one that would listen.",4.0
"We intended to arrive before the end of brunch so we could get the unlimited mimosa and bellinis for $12. We arrived before 4 but was told by the host/manager it was too late. Disappointed, we still sat down and decided to try it anyway. When it comes to brunches, restaurants have to be specific, if it says boozy brunch until 4, if I come in at 3:30, I expect to get my boozy brunch. Otherwise, it needs to be stated on the website that boozy brunch actually ends at 3 and your last hour will be 3-4. Our hostess was extremely nice and accommodating. More so than the manager/ hostess who greeted us when we first arrived. She extended the mimosas for us since the bar took an extremely long time to bring our first round out. They have four flavors: Lychee, Mango, Lavender and something else that wasn't quite memorable. The Lavender was soooo good and the Lychee was also delicious and kind of milky.They have some gluten free options on the menu so be careful when you order. My date accidentally ordered gluten free eggs, but we definitely weren't warned by the hostess. The restaurant is pretty new so we assumed that the manager that was so quick to deny our unlimited drinks forgot to tell the waiters and waitresses to inform people about GF meals. I ordered the chicken and waffles and a side of potatoes because I'm a lush. The chicken was super good. Fried perfectly, the right amount of salt, my grandma must've been back there in the kitchen! The waffle tasted like it was made with sweet potatoes. I found it delicious but my date did not. The potatoes were good but they forgot to bring us ketchup after asking multiple times. And because my date hated her eggs we ended up ordering off of the regular menu. We ordered the jerk chicken wings which tasted like a charred version of the wings that they serve with the waffles. They should take the jerk wings off of the menu and offer the wings that come with the waffles. The shrimp mac and cheese with chorizo was heaven. Very heavy and we could barely finish it. All in all, we'll be back because we're tired of Piquant's shit. I wouldn't call this a destination place (somewhere to have a birthday) but for catching up and cheap drinks with the girls it's definitely a win.",4.0
"I came here last night, sat at the bar with a friend.  We weren't there for a full meal but we nibbled on some delicious food and tried some cocktails.  The sangria was fantastic!  We also really enjoyed the food- shaved brussels sprout salad, patatas bravas, and fried chickpeas.  The manager came around to say hello, he was making the rounds checking to see that everyone was having a good time- we certainly were as were all the folks around us.  I can't wait to go back here again and work my way through their fun cocktails and wine list.  The tile work and decor are nice!  Me gusta Miti Miti!",5.0
"Tried this place out for a change of pace. It's definitely a hip and trendy spot with just about the nicest bat staff we've ever experienced.

Went here last month. Absolutely wonderful! I'm a vegan & had their Glazed Tofu. Amazingly tasty & the vegetable pairing was perfect. I can't wait to go back & have the same dish again! The staff was excellent on this busy night. Very patient & very attentive. We had a baby w/stroller & they were very accommodating. The meat eaters in our group raved about their dishes as well. I think a vegan dish is a better representation as to the chef's knowledge & skill-Superb!,5.0
"This place is great for groups! We came here for a friends birthday and we found this place on yelp and we decided to try it. The servers were extremely nice and very knowledge about the menu and gave us good recommendations (as we have Been been to tapas bar before). We each had 2 tapas each and that was MORE than enough for 6 people. The drinks were made very well ( a little strong for my liking but that's just me). The jerk chicken was spicy and SOOOOOOO GOOD. We had a round of spicy jalapeños, which was like playing Russian roulette to find the spicy pepper which was cool. It was an overall great experience and we enjoyed ourselves.",5.0
"I came here on Monday with a friend for dinner.We ordered the baby octopus, diver scallops, baby lamb chops, shrimp & chorizo mac (orzo) and cheese and the korean pork belly tacos.Total bill was around $81 without drinks and tip.I must say, that there is very little value for money. We finished everything but the mac and cheese and were only impressed with the octopus and the scallops.The scallops were the treat of the night. Cooked to perfect, tasted divine. Not enough good things to say about this dish.The baby octopus was also charred nicely. Not rubbery, not soft. Just right. Very well done.The mac and cheese tasted very strong, however, the familiar texture of macaroni is replaced by orzo. Doesn't really work well for me.The lamb chops were very oily. There wasn't much game to them, so they were prepared well, but when cooked, there's an oily taste, like you used too much oil when you make scrambled eggs....if you make scrambled eggs with oil. The korean pork belly tacos didn't really taste like pork belly. More like roast pork in its stringy texture. Definitely did not taste any of the fattier, softer meat that's usually present in pork belly.I wasn't very full after this meal either, I picked up a chicken souvlaki dinner with all salad on my way home to satiate my hunger. I think this was the hungriest I've ever left a tapas place, and also one, if not , the most expensive. I'm not sure how this is rated $11 - $30; that is about two dishes and, given the size of said dishes, it's hard to imagine how one would be full after eating only two dishes.I'd like to give this place another shot, but I probably won't, seeing as I'm a value-conscious diner. This doesn't mean I won't go to fine dining, but the meal has to represent the bill at the end of the night, which I do not think it does at this establishment.",2.0
"As a sister restaurant of Bogota, I had high hopes. Some aspects we really enjoyed, including the shrimp and chorizo Mac n cheese, and the goat cheese appetizer. However I do think most of the menu is very overpriced for what you receive. $12 for a salad of lettuce, corn, and chickpeas is a bit much, as is 2 (very) small tacos for $9. There were some odd flavors going on in the cocktails, I tried several and weren't crazy about them. Haven't decided if I'll be back for another try yet. Our waiter noted the restaurant has changed head chefs several times already... Maybe if they get someone to stick the menu will improve.",3.0
"I visited on the first night they had Taco Tuesday and I was so pleased we walked by! You cannot beat $4 tacos that actually taste really damn good and full of flavor! They also have $6 margaritas and $7 flavored ones on Tuesday, not to mention the happy hour that is already going on until close. Nothing on that menu is over $7. This restaurant is so sexy, love the interior decor, the lighting was just right, music level was great. Perfect for a date.

To my surprise, I was seated right away and the red sangria is Aaahhhhmazing! You could screw up a sangria, believe me. They also offered a pear sangria sample which was tasty too but it didn't quite satisfy my cravings that night. The guacamole and chips were fresh (free chips refill), corn cob with coconut was interesting as well. It was definitely a strange mixture but oddly addicting. The kale salad with pear could be more exciting. At times, I did find it too salty for my liking but other times, it was the perfect balance. Perhaps a different dressing would be good.

"Recommended 2-3 small plates per person. Happy hour before 7pm available in both bar and dining room.I got the green sangria which has lychee in it. Love Asian fusion drinks...Lentil falafel tastes clean and healthy but I wish the tahini sauce had more salt. Bacalao croquetas are freaking wonderful, honestly even better than some of the ones I had in Barcelona. The fish flavor was strong and there were chunks of cod in the croquettes which I loved. Korean pork belly tacos is less fatty than it sounds; in fact the only fatty part was the pork rind that comes on top, and the pickled fennel added enough acid to balance the fat out. I didn't find a lot of Asian flavors in this dish but it was a really good taco and the jalapeno gave it a lot of heat. Tuna wonton nachos were good but I thought the dish was more of a mini ceviche and the wonton skin was too hard to chew as compared to the soft texture of the guac and tuna. The swordfish skewers were cooked perfectly - tender and moist, although I didn't care for the side salad that had disproportionately too much dill.Food is 3 stars but service is very very good - water refill continued even after bill was paid.",4.0
"3 stars for the decor, waiter/waitress demeanor and attentiveness and the overall vibe.I'm usually a red/white sangria kinda girl, but the waitress brought me a sample of the green, and it was AWESOME! It was really good and will def get again if I decide to visit again.We ordered Jamaican corn( I enjoyed), Falafel for HB (i tasted but didn't like), Jerk wings (didn't like...the sauce was good, but the wings were too much on the soft side for my liking), chicken skewers (a tad bit too salty for my taste...would've been perfect with less salt).I would come back for that green sangria and corn. Hopefully they change up/add some more things...some things just weren't appealing.",3.0

Great food.  Wonderful service.  So friendly and accommodating.  Salmon tartar is wonderful.  Mac and cheese nice and creamy.  Tacos are flavorful.,5.0
"The manager was friendly and very helpful the food though small in position size was tasty but the best part the service and the amazing drinks! I have the green sangria and loved it, I wanted more!",5.0
"Recommended 2-3 small plates per person. Happy hour before 7pm available in both bar and dining room.I got the green sangria which has lychee in it. Love Asian fusion drinks...Lentil falafel tastes clean and healthy but I wish the tahini sauce had more salt. Bacalao croquetas are freaking wonderful, honestly even better than some of the ones I had in Barcelona. The fish flavor was strong and there were chunks of cod in the croquettes which I loved. Korean pork belly tacos is less fatty than it sounds; in fact the only fatty part was the pork rind that comes on top, and the pickled fennel added enough acid to balance the fat out. I didn't find a lot of Asian flavors in this dish but it was a really good taco and the jalapeno gave it a lot of heat. Tuna wonton nachos were good but I thought the dish was more of a mini ceviche and the wonton skin was too hard to chew as compared to the soft texture of the guac and tuna. The swordfish skewers were cooked perfectly - tender and moist, although I didn't care for the side salad that had disproportionately too much dill.Food is 3 stars but service is very very good - water refill continued even after bill was paid.",4.0
"3 stars for the decor, waiter/waitress demeanor and attentiveness and the overall vibe.I'm usually a red/white sangria kinda girl, but the waitress brought me a sample of the green, and it was AWESOME! It was really good and will def get again if I decide to visit again.We ordered Jamaican corn( I enjoyed), Falafel for HB (i tasted but didn't like), Jerk wings (didn't like...the sauce was good, but the wings were too much on the soft side for my liking), chicken skewers (a tad bit too salty for my taste...would've been perfect with less salt).I would come back for that green sangria and corn. Hopefully they change up/add some more things...some things just weren't appealing.",3.0
"Creative, flavorful food in a lively setting. Our favorites: shrimp and chorizo mac & cheese, pork belly tacos, and bacon dates. Go for happy hour and try out a fun cocktail. A little pricey for the size of the dishes, but that's not unusual for tapas.",4.0
"I've been a few times now and each time I go it gets better. Service is always stellar and the space is designed beautifully. My last time in I sat at the bar and the bartender was amazing. The food is equally as good and like travelling around the world. I love the jamaican street corn, pork belly tacos, and charred octopus. The patatas bravas and shrimp and chorizo mac and cheese was also phenomenal. It's hard to choose a favorite when everything is so good. Highly recommend this place!",5.0
"Delicious food and cocktails, fun and hip decor, and great service! The happy hour deals are great. Be sure to try the mushroom croquettes, Jamaican street corn, lamb empanadas, and Brussels sprouts with bacon. Have had a great experience every time I've come here.",5.0
I was introduced to Miti Miti when they so graciously participated in a fund raiser for a neighborhood shelter. I've since returned as a party of 2 with my wife and as a party of 12 and a couple other times in between. I appreciate the hospitality and friendly vibes I've been welcomed with each time. The cocktail menu is good and I enjoy the happy hour deals. My favorites from the menu are the jerk chicken wings and shrimp/chorizo mac n cheese. I'll be back soon for sure.,4.0
"Discovered this cute tapas place near Union St in Park Slope. Mon-Wed they have happy hour all night! Cocktail prices were really good at $8 and pretty strong.We ordered a bunch of different things but the curry mussels are THE best. You could drink that stuff for days. Would also recommend the bacon wrapped dates and jamaican street corn as starters. The manager even came by to ask us how our meal was and our server was really patient and friendly. Five stars to that! Would definitely come back, if not for the happy hour alone! They also have bar snacks at a cheaper price then too!",4.0

"2.5 stars. Maybe we just did a bad job of ordering, maybe Miti Miti is still working out some kinks, but the food here was just meh. Nothing was bad, but nothing outstanding either. For the price, there are many other good tapas places in the city. Cons: The octopus was tiny given the price! Really it was a serving for one person, barely enough to share, but they tried to fill the dish out with potato chips and some kind of puree (both of which were fine, but didn't add anything to the octopus. The chorizo plate was fine, but not very spicy and kind of oily. The salad was an interesting concept, but wasn't very exciting either. The bacon wrapped dates were over-cooked, and kinda too hard. Pros: The goat cheese was a good size and tasted good, but then the bread that came with it wasn't toasted and weirdly had olive oil on it. The drinks were really tasty, and is the one thing that might make me come back, though I would probably just snack a little and plan to have my actual meal elsewhere.

"1 starter, 4 tapas, and a Mexican Coke.  Bill without tip: $54.Starter: Guacamole and chips -  small to normal portion of run of the mill guac with about 15 multi-colored chips. Interesting add: pieces of red pepper Croquetas:  best tapas by far.  I would give this dish 5 stars.  Perfect crisp with soft creamy cod fish inside, bright orange sauce drizzled over.  I wish I had ordered 4 of these.Lamb Meatballs: slightly undercooked. If they were supposed to be pink inside, they were inconsistent. first meatball was brown all the way through, although pretty tough especially for lamb. Reminded me of when I attempt to make meatballs at home and they come out hard. The next three were pink inside. My wife ate 2, and made an awkward face at the second. I give this dish 1 star.Lentil Falafel: 3 big pieces with about 2 tablespoons yoghurt sauce on the side.   The falafels looked promising.  I was in the mood for fried after chewing on cool pinkish center lamb balls.  They had something in them that was a wake up call.  Some spice I couldn't figure out.  I think it's the aromatic spice that is used in all falafels, but they used 4x the amount or something.  Had the after taste of cleaner. 2 stars.Chicken Skewers:  2 chicken skewers, grilled with grill marks, but somehow really rubbery like what you would find on a chicken salad from walmart. Slimy at spots.  Completely unseasoned, like if you just boiled the chicken, and the burned it on a grill.  Came with a side of chunky tzatziki, again only a couple tablespoons. 1 star.Mexican coke: Perfect. Wait staff: Several awkward servers, maybe second job as server.  Ours didn't really know what to say, and tried to throw a geeky spanish accent when he explained what Miti Miti meant.  He and at least 4 other individual people visited our table for something every 3 minutes.  Made it really hard to continue a conversation. This included the general manager (indian guy) who came over twice to chit chat, and to ask us to please leave a yelp review. 2 stars.Overall, food was very underwhelming, unseasoned, and very pricey.  Given the food, they would have to come down to $3 tapas for me to come back, and I would order a table full of cod croquetas.These guys are very new, so I am thinking the 5 star reviews are probably friends.  The guy next to us was pulling shells out of his teeth from one of the fried shellfish dishes.",2.0

"Really fun new spot in the area.  My recommendation to start things on the right foot is see if you can get John as your waiter.  I'm sure the rest of the staff is also great but John totally made our night and I'll be asking for him if he's there every time I go.  The way he describes the food makes you want to try everything and pretty much all his recommendations were spot on.My personal favorite dishes were the pork belly tacos and lamb sliders, but I didn't have anything that I hated.  The cocktail menu looks really interesting and I'm looking forward to trying out everything on it.  The moda vieja was a delicious take on an old fashioned but the Lovelace was missing something, maybe a little more chocolate.The only weakness on the menu right now are the desserts.  The concepts sound interesting (rice pudding empanadas!) But the execution is just alright.  The chocolate sauce with the empanadas was amazing, though.  Also the chocolate mousse didn't need the peppercorns in my opinion.  My friend has already gone back and reported that the creme brulee was decent enough.All in all, it was a wonderful experience and I look forward to exploring everything this place has to offer.",5.0
Food is tapas style mainly and amazing. My husband and I came for lunch and we thought the food was amazing. We also love bogota and love that they opened another restaurant. The drinks are good in both places. And they have such a good tres leches cake. The hostess and wait staff were amazing,5.0
"I hosted a company party here at Miti Miti Taperia on 5/13 for approximately 125 people. The party was a huge success due to George, Steve, Alex and their strong team beside them. The feedback I've received are all positive and thus, I highly recommend Miti Miti Taperia for an event venue. As detailed-oriented as I am, I found George to be even more so! He pulled off a picture-perfect event for my guests! Pre-planning: George answered my numerous emails in a timely fashion and provided great feedback for food and table-layout. He was understanding of my budget and never tried to oversell.Day of event: His staff was incredibly patient and attentive. One server presented me with a  plate of food and reminded me to eat in-between working. Special thank you to Diego for his speedy bartending skills! The drinks were quite delicious, ESPECIALLY the green sangria!Food: I am in awe of the food. My favorite items are, Jamaican street corn, blue cheese croquetas, farro salad, and rice pudding empanadas with chocolate dipping sauce. They went above and beyond to create a BBQ Seitan Nachos for this event. It was a big hit for vegans and vegetarians!

"I didn't try the food since it's not a taperia anymore and, in the efforts of being more global, it seriously lacks in variety of dishes. I personally think a restaurant should pick a specialty (tapas, Latin, bar food, etc etc) and try not to do everything at the same time.",3.0

"I didn't try the food since it's not a taperia anymore and, in the efforts of being more global, it seriously lacks in variety of dishes. I personally think a restaurant should pick a specialty (tapas, Latin, bar food, etc etc) and try not to do everything at the same time.",3.0
Great place for a tasty meal. Very specific taste to this awesome kitchen. They put a good spin on everything you try. Not so expensive. Get More than what you pay for.,4.0
"Wonderful bright restaurant. Food was great . We had the roast corn with coconut, Mac and cheese with chorizo and shrimp and watermelon salad to start with were all amazing. Our main course was the Moroccan shrimp which was good and the chicken dish which was tasty. Dessert was also good, key lime pie and churros . We had a pitcher of red sangria which was more than enough for the two of us. We will def be back!",4.0

The atmosphere was fun and silly, the decor is all bright colors and prints of famous latin works, el greco, diego rivera, etc. We decided to eat family style and buy a lot of apps to share. Service was good. Everything was really satisfying. Nothing mind blowing. The nachos were delicious. It was the strangest combination of foods, but we had fun.

"Awesome, awesome night! Came here with three other people for a nice dinner and the place def didn't disappoint. We are huge fans of Bogota, the sister restaurant, so we came with high expectations. The high lights were green sangria, lamb chops, and deviled eggs. But honestly, all small dishes were excellent.

"Looking at reviews I was very excited to try this place . We had the jalapeño lemonade and lavender mocktail, lovely.

"Came here with a large group for a friend's birthday. I heard it was the sister restaurant of bogota, so I was excited to come. The tapas was definitely not worth the price! It was mediocre at best. We order most of things from the menu, such as ceviche, charcuterie, scallops, brussels sprouts, lamb burgers, wings, mushroom with bluecheese, guacomole, roasted cauliflower and many more. Long story, short, the only thing that was good was the brussels sprouts and the charcuterie board (because they're just serving cured meat). I would not come here again to pay for overpriced tapas.

"Huge beautiful place. Stopped here for a quick drink on a Saturday afternoon. Happy hour is from 11-5PM. The drink specials were reasonable which made the drinks great. I'm not sure how great they would have been at full price. That said we did enjoy the drinks :-) The food portions however left a lot to be desired. Now hear me out, I know this is a tapas spot so I know the portions are small size, however the prices prohibit you from getting more than one or two unless you don't mind running up a bill. That said, I would happily come back and knock back a few here...but would stop for a bite before if I'm hungry.",4.0
"Awesome tapas, amazing drinks, wonderful service, what more can a girl ask for? The tapa menu options are extensive and our wonderful server made some excellent recommendations.

"I had huge expectations about this place because of their amazing sister restaurant, Bogota. The concept was very different - more of a modern, chic lounge type of place...though I prefered the cultural feel of Bogota. But anyway, onto the important part: the food. The bill came out to about $65 for 2 sangrias, 1 starter, 2 tapas, 1 dessert without tax and tip. Not ridiculous but also not really worth it. Sangrias were ok, nothing to write home about. Lamb sliders were my favorite if I had to pick. The apps and tapas sounded great on paper but just ok, a bit too salty all around, in reality. The rice pudding empanadas sounded too interesting not to get, but again, it was quite underwhelming.Our server was attentive, perhaps too attentive, but very nice and polite. No manager stopped by even though there were only about 3 other tables there. For a new restaurant, I would expect a manager to chat for a little and/or complimentary sample of something (if only just to get the good yelp reviews). Also in the middle of our dinner, the music just started to blast. Not sure what that was about.Bottom line: They're brand new and they definitely have potential.

"Some of the worst service I have ever experienced! Just in case someone from this business is reading my review - I am talking about the waitress with the bad underbite. She is the main reason why I would never come back to Miti Miti, nor will I ever suggest anyone go here. My husband and I were seated and the waitress came by to take our drink order. Once that was placed it took her 15 minutes to come back and take our food order. She apologized for the wait and said the drinks were on their way. We watched our drinks being made from afar and just sit there at the bar as the waitress took care of absolutely anything else but us. 30 minutes later getting mad I was forced to flag her down. She had a look of an ""Oops"" on her face and  with the words: ""I am sorry, the bar is just sooo backed up"" she walked right over there and grabbed our melted, awaiting to be grabbed drinks. Horrible waitress aside, I cannot say that any one of the dishes we tried would bring me back here. The bacalao croquetas - way too mooshy and should have a bit more spice/taste to them, Skirt steak skewers - although good, but I can't believe that there is no dipping sauce offered along side, charred octopus - just so so.. Last but not least - the absolute worst Margarita I have ever had in my entire life!",1.0

I really liked that the Chef brought a few of our plates to the table nice extra special touch. The drinks are great a was well I enjoyed my old fashion it was very tasty. Will be back for sure.

Jessica our server was awesome, attentive all evening without being one of those overbearing servers that visits the table every five minutes.  She was super knowledgeable about the food when I asked some very specific questions (I have dietary restrictions) and helped me figure out what to get. Thank you Jessica!",5.0
Great happy hour. I need to make this MY neighbourhood place.,5.0
"great little tapas place. were invited here by our friends and glad we came. food was terrific, a little on the pricey side (came on friday evening), but nevertheless were pretty full. would visit again!",5.0
"Some of the worst service I have ever experienced! Just in case someone from this business is reading my review - I am talking about the waitress with the bad underbite. She is the main reason why I would never come back to Miti Miti, nor will I ever suggest anyone go here. My husband and I were seated and the waitress came by to take our drink order. Once that was placed it took her 15 minutes to come back and take our food order. She apologized for the wait and said the drinks were on their way. We watched our drinks being made from afar and just sit there at the bar as the waitress took care of absolutely anything else but us. 30 minutes later getting mad I was forced to flag her down. She had a look of an ""Oops"" on her face and  with the words: ""I am sorry, the bar is just sooo backed up"" she walked right over there and grabbed our melted, awaiting to be grabbed drinks. Horrible waitress aside, I cannot say that any one of the dishes we tried would bring me back here. The bacalao croquetas - way too mooshy and should have a bit more spice/taste to them, Skirt steak skewers - although good, but I can't believe that there is no dipping sauce offered along side, charred octopus - just so so.. Last but not least - the absolute worst Margarita I have ever had in my entire life!",1.0
"The most attentive and friendly service I've experienced in NY.Had the scallops (portion is smaller than price point would suggest) which was great. Beet salad, brusselsprouts salad, lamb meatballs and tacos were all stellar. Great house wine too ($5 Tempranillo)!!Overall amazing experience but the price (for food/quantity) is a little bit on the high side...",4.0
"This place is a great addtion to the neighborhood, stopped in yesterday in the late afternoon. John our waiter was amazing such a great guy and really knows his stuff. The food was awesome, my BF and I had four different plates, I recommend the Pumpkin Hummus it was delicious. Everything else was great as well. I really liked that the Chef brought a few of our plates to the table nice extra special touch. The drinks are great a was well I enjoyed my old fashion it was very tasty. Will be back for sure. So glad this place is so close to my house will be there often. Thanks for the great food!",5.0
I passed by this place a couple times before deciding to give them a try. This place is amazing. Try out there Guacamole and Patatas Bravas in appetizers. Everything is great and the service is awesome. Servers are very friendly and always try to make sure that you are having a good time.,5.0
Service and taste is exactly what you would expect from these owners of Bogota across the street. Drinks were good and the food was flavorful. The waiters are dressed a little better and the decor is a bit more upscale. Our waiter was great (kinda reminded me of a teacher i had in elementary school or Bill Nye the Science guy). When he noticed that the food had taken long to be prepared he threw in a complimentary dessert so quick he didn't give us a chance to be mad or complain. Excellent!The only thing i didn't like was the small entree selection.,4.0
"Still going there on a regular basis with my husband, my 19 months old baby and the 2 months old new addition to the family.. The menu has changed since my first review and although I do regret the missing fried eggs with chorizo brunch and the free chick peas, the food is still rrreally good and my daughter loves too much the chick peas for us not to get it (it's on the menu now).. We are always greatly receive by the staff, everyone is very welcoming and the place is still very nice and clean.. My husband insisted on me adding a new review to say just how much we love it",5.0
"The minute you walk into the door you feel extremely welcome here and the entire staff is very friendly. Great overall dining experience , the food is delish and the drinks are great , ambiance and decor are also a plus . I would highly recommend the spicy feta dip and the corn on the cob and also the tuna wonton nachos!!!! They were sooooo good !!! I would  however skip on the pork sliders , i Didnt think the meat was that great and it also wasn't seasoned . The manager came to our table to check up and ask us how everything was twice which was very thoughtful . Overall everything was amazing , the only thing I would recommended is spacing out the orders . We ordered about five plates of tapas and everything came to our table at the same time , some were hot and some were cold so we had to kind of eat all the hot stuff quickly before it got cold , other than that the experience was great !",4.0
"We went there on opening night and am only writing this now, so keep that in mind. Had several tapas, including but not limited to the potato cakes (excellent), and the mac and cheese dish, which if I recall tasted little like mac and cheese and much more like crab or the other fish ingredients, either way it, too, was excellent. The croquetas were so great. As for all the other food, we didn't have anything we didn't like. The service was very thorough and thoughtful  and quick, but i'm not going to weigh in on this very much because first nights are rarely representative of service later on as a rule, so I'm not voicing much opinion here. We ate in the back of the restaurant, the atmosphere was really pleasant, they have some really neat murals on the wall and a nice low-light feel. Drinks were good and strong.Will keep this place in regular restaurant rotation.",4.0
Great dinner with wonderful flavors and fun tastes. The jalapeno lemonade was very good. We enjoyed the lobster quesadillas and happy hour prices.,5.0
Great addition to the neighborhood! The small plates are perfect for people who love to share multiple dishes. The Mac and cheese was unreal. Our waiter was very attentive and made great suggestions. Will definitely be back!,4.0
"I love this place! The food is delicious, and the restaurant has a really cool look. I especially love the bacon-wrapped dates. The staff is also incredibly friendly.

"We had a great time at Miti Miti!  Our friends enjoyed, great drinks, service and food.  The cocktails were yummy and the food was delicious.  We had a large group and it was so nice to be able to try different dishes and pass them around for tasting.  Loved the ceviche, croquettes, brussel sprouts, lamb meatballs,spicy potatoes....and just about everything I tasted!  Would definitely go back again, hopefully soon.",4.0
"SO a few of my friends and I visit this taperia on a weekday afternoon. Place was empty and quite, which to be honest was not so bad. Several of us got  alcoholic beverage which after a long day of work we were excited for!! Well, lets start with my drink. I ordered the Lavender Grapefruit Paloma which basically tasted like grapefruit a lots of sugar (I literally saw the settled sugar at the bottom of my glass). The other two drinks I tasted from my girlfriend were the Red and White Sangria. The white was bitter and sour and the red tasted like breakfast! French toast to be exact, powerful kick of cinnamon. Ever done the cinnamon challenge?!For our entrees my girlfriend and I ordered the warm goat cheese (which was delicious!!), the mac and cheese (for the most part it was okay, but was a little too watery and the top layer was burnt. Tasted like charcoal chips form my BBQ.), steak skewers (delicious but very small portion for the price), Carnitas Sliders (again, tasty but minuscule portions. the sliders were basically bread.), and the patatas bravas (they were really good too, but it's kind of hard to mess those up!).The place overall is cool. The decor resembles touches of pop art colors to retro with a Funky unique bar and chandeliers. The service was excellent & our waiter was very resourceful with recommendations. Everything SOUNDED delicious!! Sadly, it was all imaginative. For a new place it has a lot of potential. Being in the restaurant business myself i understand it takes a little time to smooth out the small grooves. However, when I found out it's in partners with Bogota Latin Bistro (which is located down the block) I almost lost it. For a new establishment I understand it takes time but when its run under same management or owners its almost an insult.  As a customer you are EXPECTED to pay and tip 20%, 22%, 25% (as the bottom of the receipt suggests), so as a well known establishment you are then EXPECTED to provide a decent meal. Miti Miti wasn't all that cheap either. I understand as a taperia, meaning small tapas/plates, however, some of the portions where bite-size. There were hardly enough for one person I can't imagine ""sharing."" This little establishment needs something edgy or even s signature drink?plate that will help it stand out. Besides the decor and location this Taperia isn't anything special. Would be a shame for all the hard work to go unnoticed. Hope it's better next time around for their future customers.",2.0

The the manager then announced that he was only taking care of the cheapest: we ended up ordering and paying more than intended as a ""reward"" for a terrible service... the desserts were not even worth it.The food is very average and overpriced (you basically pay entree price for tapas).

"I took my girlfriend here for a Mother's Day brunch. We left hungry and disappointed after I spent $60.

The waiter was a nice enough but neither the manager nor the owner took responsibility or even apologized. And they still charged us for everything. We left and went to Alchemy down the street afterwards (which I recommend). The worst part is that the owner sent a bullying message to my girlfriend after she wrote an honest review. He said that her review is the kind of thing that gets people fired! I posted his message here. If anyone is to be fired it should be him. We love Bogota because they welcome feedback and actually engage with people to do better.

The food is Remarkable! This will be my new spot to go to and tell all my co-workers when coming to NYC. I truly appreciate good service as I do travel alot.

I had the Lavender Grapefruit Paloma and a sip of my friend's Red Sangria and both were delicious. There were 5 of us and we all said there was nothing we wouldn't eat again. And the cherry on the Sundae for us was the music was fun but at a level where we could talk normally without screaming. I will never understand NYC's penchant for blaring music in a restaurant. Must have's imo fried chickpeas, charred octopus, brussel sprout salad, mussels in spicy sauce, and guacamole. The Whole Branzino was quite tasty too. Lots of gluten free options too.
