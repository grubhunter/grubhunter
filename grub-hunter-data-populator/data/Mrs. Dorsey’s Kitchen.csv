"When you got that craving for a grilled cheese look no further. You can also appreciate the awesome company that is Ron, the owner of this fine establishment. But don't forget why you came, the sandwiches are REDICULOUSLY tasty. Let's just say I came here for lunch and couldn't even wait a whole day to go back....I came back in a few hours....sipped a few beers(its BYOB) and listened to the DJ mixing it up. As luck would have it(or Mitch knows every deal in the city) when we came back there was a full on sandwich orgy...Not in the sense of people having sex with actual food, more so as people getting trays upon trays of different sandwiches to try for free. They all were great. In order of greatness(for my tastebuds) it goes. 1. Bacon Guac. 2. Chicken Pesto. 3. Bacon and Shrimp 4. Turkey club. I could easily eat any of them in the future and be plenty satisfied.Remember, come for the food and amazing ownership/staff...stay for the sandwich orgy.",5.0
"Black History Month Lunch provided by @dorseyskitchen!!! Ron grilled the sandwiches on site, had a banging avocado salad and bread pudding (popped my bread pudding cherry!) everyone enjoyed the lunch! Please note this is a catering review. Ron was on time and professional during our event. We showed a documentary as he grilled the sandwiches in the corner. We were able to enjoy the film without interruption. Thank you Ron for an awesome job today!!",5.0
"I ordered the eggplant sandwich, avocado salad, 5 cheese mac and cheese, bacon avocado sandwich. I got a call (very courteous from the owner) stating they didn't have the eggplant for the sandwich, so I was offered to try a shroom sandwich(which I loved btw).Although, It saddens me to say the following:1. The avacado salad was extremely dry, and the spinach could've been chopped a bit smaller. 2. The peppers in the bacon avocado sandwich should of been chopped very small and evenly spreaded throughout the sandwich.Poo  3. The mac and cheese... DRY. No mositure at all Ooo4. Some ingredients missing. (The downside of my experience).I don't want to seem disrespectful.. I just feel someone should be completely honest.Not highly disappointed ... Everyone deserves a second chance.. See you soon guys",3.0
Happy National Grilled Cheese day! Just so happens I walked in to this lovely establishment on the occasion. I had the Guac and bacon and it was the bomb!! Definitely check this place out if you're craving some grilled cheese comfort.,5.0
"Grilled cheese. Yes please. Come here at least 2-3  a week and every-time it's an adventure. Cool little spot. Exposed brick, dope art, bar like counter with seats, two tables in the front as well additional seating upstairs. Your immediately greeted when you walk in and if your a regular like me they know your name and your game. Staff is always super friendly. There's always someInteresting conversations and debates to engage in with locals, staff or other patrons. The music is always spot on. On most visits I can easily lose 2-3 hours here. After eating until my belly is content, I hang around enjoying the music, atmosphere and a conversation or 2. I've essentially tried everything on the menu. But of course I have my favs. BKNY! If you're adventurous, unpredictable and rambunctious like me. This sandwich is perfect. Even if you're not its still perfect. I get mines on ciabatta . Cream cheese, cheddar cheese, pickles, jalapeños, tomatoes & bacon. Don't think about it. Just eat it. Shrimp & Grits grill cheese. This was a special and unfortunately not on the everyday menu. But when I tell you I ate this everyday that it was a special. I mean some things in life change and some things change your life. This was life changing. Perfectly cooked shrimp in abundance, creamy polenta, basil, I don't recall the cheese served with mango-racha. I'm currently trying to convince the owner to put it on the menu. I promise I'll buy them all and bring my friends. They make a ton of specials sauces. You guys must try the spicy onion jam. This condiment is life changing. I put it on their mac & cheese, I eat it with just avocado, I create my own sandwich and put it on that. They need to bottle that stuff up and sell it. Some of my favorite sides include; the roasted tomato soup that could warm Jack Frost heart. Spicy, well seasoned and satisfying. Nothing pairs better with grill cheese than tomato soup. In the warmer months they have a gazpacho. Packed full of flavor, cool and refreshing. 5 cheese Mac and cheese: Mozzarella, Parmesan cheese, cheddar, cream cheese, blue cheese, green onion, herbs, and white cheddar Cheez-It bread crumbs.  Speaks for itself. If your feeling frisky they have a mac-mato. Tomato soup and Mac cheese together. Amen!The salads are really good and very fresh with kick ass dressings. Okay I realize that I'm trying to squeeze over a year worth of delicious dining experiences into this one review. I'm pretty sure if I don't end this now, Yelp will create a character limit. One last thing before I go, ask about the off the menu items. One in particular being the pull pork sandwich. Slow cooked for 12 hours, I usually jut skip the bread and grab a fork. Just try this place already. Ok I'm done bye!",5.0
"Finally made it back MDK and it was open! Cute place, very Brooklyn-y exposed brick, tin ceiling etc.  We met the owner Ron, who was great, friendly and helpful.  The way it works is you go to counter, order your meal and they bring it to you. I got the kids (1/2 a sandwich) grilled cheddar cheese which came with sliced apples and a juice box. I also go the onion jam. The sandwich was great--I do wish it was slightly more buttery. But it didn't prevent me from plowing through it.  The spicy onion jam is a the TRUTH. Really really good. We also shared the avocado salad, I really enjoyed the balsamic glaze/dressing. Really tasty. My BF (we eat out a lot) got the make your own grilled cheese--smoked gouda, mushrooms and chicken (?) I can't remember the protein he choose. But the way he yummed through it I'd say he enjoyed it.  We'll be back for sure. Before we could even leave he was suggesting the next time we might come back.  All in all a really cute place with great sandwiches.",4.0
"This place is as good as it gets. They are very good at what they do. The owner is one of the coolest dudes in the world. Sandwiches are always made to order and always delicious. One of the best things is you can be creative with your order and they will always cater to whatever you are in the mood for. Also a huge plus is their gluten free bread. As someone with celiac disease it is impossible to find a legit sandwich spot, but this place is it. I love coming in, sitting at the counter, watching whatever is on their big screen and shooting the breeze with the owner while enjoying one of his creations. I travel from the Upper West Side just to have some of these bites. I highly recommend this to any sandwich lover!",5.0
Came here with three of my friends for a random Thursday afternoon for a lunch get together. Who can say no to grilled cheese. Especially different types of grilled cheese and a pumpkin bread pudding for dessert to end the meal. We each ordered a different grilled cheese but my favorite is The Mac along with the bread pudding. A must visit if your around the area,4.0
"Giving 5 stars to management! Went in on a Saturday night and service was a bit slow, but the owner came out and explained that a staff member didn't show up so he apologized right off the bat. Our order finally came and ended up not being right/missing an ingredient which was disappointing since the sandwiches were good, but I can imagine how great it would be with the avocado! We explained this to the owner when we went up to pay, and he sincerely apologized again for the service and comped our bill! That was so kind of him to do so and that's exactly how a restaurant should be managed, so thumbs up to him! I definitely will be returning again to try out some of the other sandwiches and hopefully they'll have a full staff to help. Highly recommend this place if you're in the area... and get the tomato soup!",5.0
"Ron is the nicest guy, and he made some awesome recommendations for my friend and I. My choice was the 'Shroom sandwich and it was delicious. The pricing is not bad, and the atmosphere of the place is cozy.Ron told us that, in April, he's having live music and comedy for grilled cheese month.",5.0
"Amazing! The dude here is incredibly friendly and really cares about your experience. You order when you come in, and he brings you the food (we sat upstairs, where it was nice and warm). I had the shroom melt, which was a spicy delectable treat with mushrooms, tomatoes, cheese, and a spicy flavorful spread that really enhanced the meal. All on crispy ciabatta bread and cut into four triangles, which I thoroughly enjoyed. I will be back and certainly will tell all my friends about this friendly, cozy place. The only drawback is that the kitchen gets a little smokey, and it's in the same room in which you eat. Enjoy the friendly vibes and great home cooking!",5.0

What a fun scene on a first saturday! Grilled cheese and a great DJ. The owner gave out free samples :),5.0
"I like this place already. This is an example of when the difference is made by the heart, the passion, the smile of the person who runs it. Of course, food has to be good (and it is) and prices should be possibly fair (and they pretty are). But what I mostly like of MDK is that there is a style I see already, it's not just another grilled cheese sandwiches bar. Ron, the owner, gives his imprint choosing the music manually, up to mood maybe :-) and there are interesting combinations in the signature sandwiches menu. I am sure the classics are very good too.He smiles, I like smiling people. He makes his clients feel comfortable, that's so precious. Too many anonymous bars, shops... we need more authentic, personal, cosy spots. Like Mrs.Dorsey's Kitchen. I'll be back, next time I'll go the Botanic Garden I'll make sure to find time for a short walk and a tasty signature sandwich.",4.0
"It was Friday, September 30th and I was very hungry. Do I decided to go with something light. I ordered a grilled cheese w/ cheddar and bacon. The grilled cheese sandwich was burnt and the edges were hard. The mac and cheese was supposed to have 5 different types of cheese - it actually tasted like Velveta and not home made AT All !!! Next was the sweet potato bread pudding. It didn't come in a container - instead a small paper plate - which usually holds French Fries. It was mushy - had very little flavor and deposits it being $3.. It wasn't worth it. $15 later I am extremely disappointed. I tried to give this place a chance - but I don't think I will be ordering from there again. Thanks but no - thanks!",1.0
"Yummy...happened to be in the area the other day and stopped in here. What more did I need to see on the sign besides ""grilled cheese bar""?! It was a rainy day as I walked into this small spot (although they do have a little more seating upstairs). I plopped down on one of the stools and placed my order. The girl working was SUPER friendly! I ended up getting the avocodo & bacon grilled cheese. There is onion and jalapeno in it so if you don't want a little spice, either omit it or try something else. There are a few different breads to choose from. I decided on cibatta. It was perfectly crispy and delicious. I also got a small tomato soup on the side. Everything was awesome. I'm a snob and like to go to a place a few times to see the consistency before giving 5 stars but my tummy left happy that day!",4.0
"I really enjoyed myself at this restaurant! Although it's small and comfortable,  the staff, service and food are all fantastic. I had the pleasure of chatting with the hostess / waitress and tried her food suggestions which I'm glad I did. The mac and cheese was delicious. The pulled pork sandwich was perfection. This would have been a 5 star experience if I got to try the bread pudding but that's okay I'll try it next time! I will definitely be going back!",4.0
"I have never been to a restaurant where I felt I was at home or eating at a friend's place. But Ron, the owner and founder (I believe) of the restaurant did just that. I didn't see Mrs. Dorsey anywhere (and also neglected to ask why it was named such, but I guess Ron's Kitchen doesn't have quite the same appeal, unless you're Ron Swanson... where the heck am I going with this stream of consciousness?) but who cares, because Ron is the man! First of all,  when I walked in, he was having a lively conversation with two tourists (French?) and watching Chopped with them. Super chill atmosphere. The restaurant has a second floor, but the tables and chairs looked like they were upside down, so that section was closed off. The rest of the place is pretty small but had a bar. I don't think they serve alcohol, but more of a diner kind of feel.Ron was super welcoming and made awesome suggestions and excitedly told us about his sauce spread. If there's one way to my heart, it's with sauces, and boy did he deliver. Honey-racha, Mayo-racha, Mango-racha, BBQ sauce, and... shoot I think there was one more... (fyi the ""rachas"" are siriacha, and not cucaracha, so don't be scared). They were all so good! He started us off with the 5 cheese macaroni, which had more of the pimento-y cheese feel. I personally like the macs a bit more gooey, but I enjoyed it! For the sandwiches, my gf ordered the Shrooms sandwich on gluten free bread. I chose the Jalapeno Popper on traditional pullman bread. I would highly recommend the traditional bread because it comes out hard and crisp, giving that nice crunch factor, mmmm. The shroom-wich was packed with different ingredients and was spilling out with yummy goodies. The Jalapeno was a bit more reserved. It had a nice colorful balance with the green and red peppers and seriously tasted like one of those poppers you'd get at a restaurant or at Costco (no insult intended). I want to try one of the more loaded ones next time. The entire meal was really made worth it by Ron's generosity and hospitality. Sure, food was great, but it's really the experience you come for here. He told us that he's venturing out into the various proteins like shrimp and pulled pork - I am sooo stoked for that. Until next time!",5.0
"I honestly wish I could like this place, but i wouldn't feed their food to my dog. Small ass portions and nowhere to sit either. I don't know where all these glowing reviews are from. The customer service was great up until I had an issue, then the guy started acting like it was my fault for not being able to down either of their two most popular sandwiches. Keep in mind that I was super hungry as well",1.0
"Something changed between when MDK was a stand to MDK as a shop. I first had MDK near Herald Sq. I ordered the mozzarella, basil and tomato grilled cheese. It was AMAZING. They did not skimp on anything. Full of soft and melty mozz, fresh basil and sliced tomatoes it was basically the perfect grilled cheese. It felt adult enough that there was no guilt for having it for dinner, yet small enough that I didn't feel like a fatty.However, when we finally came to the MDK location (I think it's been here for about a year?) something about the sandwich just wasn't right. The mozzarella wasn't as thick, the basil was few and far in between and the tomatoes they used were grape tomatoes sliced in half. It was awkward and it was lacking. While I still enjoyed the sandwich, it didn't hit the same spot that it did those few years ago. It was quite depressing. I hope it was just an off day where they had run out of their ingredients. I'll come back to give it another try because I want MDK to redeem itself.",3.0

"I love the Malcolm Gladwell vignette in Blink regarding how doctors are sued for malpractice most often because of how they treat patients rather than quality of care.  And I thought of it here because god, I really wanted to give this place five stars.  I've been here a couple of times, and you couldn't ask for a more caring owner and more solicitous staff.  They are jovial and pleasant, and just truly seem to care about whether or not you are enjoying life in general and their food in particular.  However, the food is not quite on point for me.  I've had both the Jalapeno Popper (cheddar, cream cheese, jalapeno and red pepper) and the Guac and Bacon (cheddar, guacamole, bacon, red onion and red pepper - in each case, the cheese was totally overpowered by the jalapeno and the guac, respectively.  The non-GC options I've tried haven't been stellar either - the tomato soup is fine, but a bit boring.  Even the sweet potato pie bread pudding - which sounded like one of the most glorious things ever - I found to be a bit bland - like someone sprinkled some pumpkin pie spices over stale bread.  I have had the classic GC a couple of times, which is quite tasty (if a bit insubstantial).  To be clear, the food is fine - this is melted cheese we're talking about here - just a bit disappointing from what I've tried, with lots of room for improvement.  I can only presume that a place that clearly cares so much about what they are doing and how their customers are enjoying their food will continue to strive towards those improvements.",3.0

You can make your own sandwich for $7 bucks. Selecting your own bread. You got pullman, pretzel, chibatta, and......... whole wheat. A choice of a whole lot of different options of cheese. A vegetable, like spinach, grilled eggplant, jalapenos, avacado, onions, tomatoes. (I know tomatoes are fruit, but hey it's listed there). And a choice of a protein, prosciutto, bacon, chicken, or turkey. Only $1 if you wanted an extra topping. They have some signature sandwiches which you may want to try too. They have some excellent five cheese mac n cheese. I also had the roasted tomato soup, perfect compliment to your sandwich and great for dipping. If that combo isn't up your alley, you have to get the special sauce. Sriracha and mayo, its deadly hot but twice as delicious as it is spicy. They also have a bread pudding I'm looking to try next time. I also noticed they have happy hour deals. 4-6 and 10-midnight. 1 cheese, 2 additional toppings for $5 bucks. Not bad at all.

I sure as hell hope so because these guys need to procreate!  Like rabbits.  Seriously.  Stop whatever you're doing and go here and eat THE BEST GODDAMN THINGS YOU'LLE EVER HAVE.  It's like Jesus Christ came down from heaven and impregnated your taste buds with holy spooge in amazing crusty goodness.  Praise the cheese.  These mofos know what they are doing.  I'm actually thinking about having kids now.  Why? BECAUSE MRS. D can be trusted with them.KRAFT CALLED.  They want their dish back.  TOO EFFIN BAD.  It's in my sammich now.Don't do drugs.  Do Mrs.D.,5.0
Great little place to grab a delicious sandwich. The staff is extremely friendly and they also gave my boyfriend and I a complimentary Mac and cheese.Ingredients are fresh and the bread was nice and toasty when biting into it! Great little simple meal. Plus there are some nice choices for mixing and matching.,4.0

"I decided to check out this spot yesterday at 1pm. I've had it bookmarked for awhile and was excited to try one of their amazing looking grilled cheese sandwiches. I order the shroom melt (with Gouda instead of mozzarella) and a small tomato soup. They were out of soup (despite it only being 1pm) so I opted to try the 5 cheese mac as a side. I was greeted by the girl working behind the counter, she was packing my to go order, it appeared as though she made it as well. She was very friendly and helpful. The sandwich was delicious!!! perfectly toasted on ciabatta bread--fantastic.",4.0
"Fantastic toasted sandwiches on ciabtta bread. The service was great as I was offered a side of onion jam, which was a delicious condiment to sandwich. The jam with its acidity and sweetness really added to the saltiness of the turkey and cheese.Recommended if you're going to Brooklyn Museum because it is only a few blocks away.",4.0
"All that and a bag of chips. ;-)My son and I were at an event in the area and stopped in right off the street for a quick bite to eat. He's a vegetarian and I'm trying the no-meat diet for a while, too, so this was perfect. The atmosphere was warm and welcoming and our grilled cheese sandwiches? They were pretty fantastic! He's in Brooklyn more than me, so I'm sure the next time my son is in the area, he'll stop by to try another item on the menu. Hope he brings something back to Jersey for me, too!",5.0
"Yassssssssss!So, I want to start this review by stating that this place is all that and a bag of chips.  Those of you born prior to 1992 get me.  Anywho, I hosted a mini-event at Mrs. Dorsey's Kitchen last night with 10 of my closest friends (/girls that I randomly met, but whatever), and was blown away.  Never in my life, have I received such phenomenal hospitality and service as I did last night.  Not only did Ron (the owner) and his team whip up some amazing eats, they also let us take over their TV to watch Scandal..major plus.  This spot is super cute and intimate, and their menu is everything.I ordered the buffalo chicken mac & cheese and the guac and bacon grilled cheese.  Both were everything.  The mac and cheese had this deliciously-crispy topping that I've been thinking about since I left.  The prices are SUPER reasonable for what you get.  They have these phenom chocolate chip cookies, too.  Don't even get me started.I definitely recommend MDK.",5.0
"Although, the grilled cheese sandwiches are extremely tiny and cute, I felt as though they weren't filling. Even with the bag of chips that my sister and I shared. My bottle of soda was flat...not that I'm complaining, cause I love flat soda but...that never ever happens.I got a Jalapeño Popper sandwich on ciabatta; which came with jalapeño peppers, cheddar and freaking CREAM CHEESE (ZOMGZ!!!!!!!). It was delicious and I could've probably ate two more. I also had a piece of my sister's ""Pop's Original"" on whole wheat bread, which included honey mustard, gouda and tomato. It was crunchy and not greasy at all. The people who work here are sooooooooo chill. And they were playing cool 90's RnB music.",4.0
"If you have not had the pleasure of walking into this store, please do yourselves a favor and GO! So far I have tried their famous Guac and Bacon, Classic Cheddar, 'Shroom Melt, BKNY, Turkey BLT, and Pulled Pork. I've also tried their bread pudding and mac 'n cheese which I were lost for words. They are all amazing! I've never left the place dissatisfied. Not only is the food amazing but their service is also exceptional. Ron and his team make me feel at home whenever I visit. It is also a great spot to meet people around the area and to catch up on awesome shows (he usually has on Shark Tank along with other fascinating ones..). The place is BYOB so it can be a nice hangout spot while sippin' on some cold beer. I 100% recommend this gem of a spot.",5.0

The sandwiches were full of flavor, and the mac and cheese was FANTASTIC. The cheez it crumb topping was an awesome touch.

"Went to prospect park and I was looking for a sandwich place near there. Found this place on yelp and had very high ratings so decided to give it a try! Went in and the owner was very friendly greeting us. The place was very cozy inside and ordered guac and bacon on ciabatta bread, shroom melt(mozzarella, sautéed mash rooms with truffle oil, sweet and spicy bacon onion jam, arugula and cherry tomatoes) on pretzel bread and roasted tomato soup. The owner was the only one cooking so took a bit longer than I expected. I wasn't in a rush so was okay but if you want a quick bite then maybe this place isn't the best place. The sandwiches tasted very good. I really liked ciabatta bread more than pretzel bread. It was light and crispy outside, soft and chewy inside. Pretzel bread was okay, it was a bit hard outside and thick. I personally didn't like tomato soup though. It was too simple, plane and tasted like just canned tomato sauce. But overall, I really like the Guac and bacon sandwich and want to come back for more different kinds.",4.0

The BKNY was my favorite - cheddar, bacon, cream cheese, jalepenos, diced tomatoes, pickles and onions. Delish! The bread was perfectly toasted. The mac and cheese was creamy with delicious bread crumbs on top. The bread pudding --oohhhh the bread pudding. It's a sweet potato pie bread pudding, and you just must try.The sandwiches are in the $10 range. There's a make your own option for $7. There's about 10 speciality sandwiches on the menu to try.

Will definitely be back!! Thanks, Ron!!!",5.0
Such delicious grilled cheese and a great menu. The bread budding is also amazing! A fantastic neighborhood spot.,5.0
Ron is the man.  He has built a magical little place using grilled cheese and love. Check it out if you enjoy grilled sandwiches and good company.,5.0
"My husband and I are visiting the area and wanted a casual dinner. MDK was the perfect place! It has a casual but cool atmosphere and the food was delicious. We were greeted by Ron as we walked in. He helped us make our decisions about dinner by making some great suggestions. I got the Shroom Melt and it was scrumptious. My husband got the BKNY and tomato soup. He loved them both! On the way out I picked up some bread pudding to take with us. It was just what I needed to top off a great evening. Thank you, Ron! Great job!",5.0
"This place is fantastic!  After an afternoon at the Botanical Gardens or Brooklyn Museum, stop in here for excellent food.  The ambiance is informal but stylish and every time I'm in here I have a great conversation with someone I just met.   What's not to like?  Its good, good, good.",5.0
"Went in for a yummy, quick lunch with my daughter. Checked on yelp and found this gem. Very straightforward menu, enough choices to give the impression of variety, but nowhere near the boarder of overwhelming. I chose a sandwich with guacamole, bacon,cheddar cheese, and onion jam. One word...sublime. My mouth, tummy, and life at that moment were completely satisfied. Btw, I made 4 uturns looking for the place. It's next to a way larger restaurant. They could do with a better sign. I hope they get many more happy customers. The end.",5.0

"This place is small and cozy and their food is good. Our server was so kind and took care of us. This place is more like a takeout/pickup than sit down and dine, but there are a few tables you can sit at. They accept credit cards and I would go back for lunch if I'm around the neighborhood.",4.0
"This place is awesome! The food is great and the owner, Ron, is one of cooler people I've met in New York. He's a generous guy who cares about his customers. The food is simple, delicious and reasonably priced. It's the best place to drop in for some comfort food, relax and hang out with friends. If you're riding solo, no worries, you can always talk to Ron. He told me he got into the business because of the people. Enjoy!",5.0
"My mom and I came here for lunch. We ordered the Turkey Club on Traditional (excellent!!) and Mama Mia on Ciabatta (pretty good!) a small salad (the dressing was so tasty) and the Mac and Cheese (excellent with crunchy parts!!) Everything tastes so homemade and you could tell the ingredients were fresh. The best part was the fun conversation with the owner Ron, who was so nice and friendly. We will definitely be back ;)",5.0

"I was out with friends on a Saturday night, and the bar we were in was just way too loud, so we went wandering Prospect Heights looking for a new spot. Down the street we found Mrs. Dorsey's kitchen. Not only was the place still open at like 11 and serving the full menu, but there is this adorable little loft space up the stairs that was perfect for hanging out. The grilled cheese was phenomenal, of course, and they even brought us their leftover bread pudding at the end of the night! Great service, never pressured us to leave so they could close up.

"I just went to MDK for the first time because when one has a grilled cheese restaurant in their neighborhood and they don't want to be a thousand pounds, there need to be rules about when grilled cheese can happen. One rule for me is after I run a double digit number of miles in a day. As a post run treat, this was one of the better ideas I've ever had! The menu items are one delicious choice after another. I chose the jalapeño popper, but I'm pretty sure you can't make a bad choice! Or you can be a maverick and make your own. I mistakenly did not order the Mac and cheese, but I saw someone else did and it looked amazing! Plus, the owner and the staff are all super friendly. I guess I need to run more!",4.0

"The food: best grilled cheese I've ever eaten. So far, I've tried the Pop's Original and the Jalapeño Popper -- both with prosciutto, both on pretzel bread -- and they were both insane. The ingredients tasted fresh and high-quality, and the bread was toasted just the right amount. Also: grilled cheese on pretzel bread. I mean damn. The service: fast, friendly, and attentive. Ron, the owner, took great care of me and my friends. He's clearly hyped about running the business and making great food, and it comes through in the atmosphere. The rest of the staff was also great, making sure we had everything we needed and cracking jokes with us. They weren't in our faces, but if we felt like chatting, they were all about it.

But I usually like to make my own (cheddar, bacon, turkey, onion, bell peppers and jalepenos). The thing I love is that all the veggies are fresh and hand cut into small pieces so I'm not getting a mouth of jalepeno but still taste all the flavors. The sandwich was filling and yummy!      I also had the Mac and cheese w/ tomato basil soup and omg it was hands down the greatest addition to a perfect grilled cheese sandwich.     Home brewed chai tea was great as well.

It all tastes very fresh, and a balanced portion (not too big, not too small). All very delicious, as well as the tomato soup, topped with cheese and onions on request. Pretzel bread for grilled cheese?!? Has some great jam made if you'd like on the side.

"Stopped in on a whim while looking for some good eats in Brooklyn.

I get the feeling that the owner wants to offer a comfort food experience to customers and for the most part he gets it right.My only suggestion would be for MDK to iron out the ordering system. Was confusing as to whether we were supposed to order/bus ourselves or wait for someone else to do it. We didn't receive menus upon sitting down and had to wait a bit to catch the attention of someone who seemed to be temporarily helping out with the rush. It was also a little weird that we had to pay before getting our food, which also made me think that maybe we were supposed to put in our own orders fast food style.

And on top of that, my food is always delicious.

"Visited this spot after a local trip to the Brooklyn Museum. The owner was extremely friendly and made myself and my party feel welcome. I tried the ABC sandwich, which was a grilled cheese sandwich with a sliced apple and bacon (on cinnamon toasted bread). Although the combination of flavors was good, there was very little bacon on the sandwich (and I love bacon). I got a small side of macaroni and cheese, but it wasn't warm and it did not really taste very flavorful. I am willing to try them again and hope that my experience will be even better the next time.",3.0
We called in to arrange for a couple sandwiches to take with us for a picnic in prospect park. I called in for pickup and they  estimated 20 minutes. We got there and it took more time. It was hot waiting for the panini sandwich. I think almost everything here is cooked as a panini.   we order the turkey club that didn't have much turkey. Gauc salad was good. Definitely a take it place more the eat in.,3.0
By far the best Turkey Club sandwich I've ever had!! There's a great atmosphere and I would surely come again. Next time I'll try the Guac and Bacon or the Mushroom Melt.,5.0

"I've had MDK cater to our office for lunch twice now and will now commit to regular catering with them. Not only is the fact that they go a step beyond and actually grill the grill cheese in front of everyone but they bring a very lively personality to the experience. The food is delicious, they've become one of my favorite vendors to work with. So accommodating. My company, DigitalOcean, really encourages a fun and personal in-office culture so the fact that MDK brings fun 90's music to play while grilling in our lunch space, put them one step above any average catering.

"The food was ok, but even a great sandwich isn't worth a 45-minute (!!!) wait!

He did apologize when they finally came out 10 minutes later and gave us an extra small plate on him. Still, we didn't feel that this was a sufficiently good way of making it up to us. Also, everyone else there was waiting for way longer than a sandwich should take too. Not sure how this gets such good reviews. Maybe just because the owner is overall friendly and makes an effort to talk to customers, so they like him personally and write reviews based on that.",3.0

Ive been here twice and both times it was AMAZING. And both times i couldnt wait until next time. I am a 30 min walk and i go out of my way to get to this place.

"How I love this place right here! So far my favorites have been the Turkey Club, Guac and Bacon, and Gorg and Pear sandwiches.

The owner, Ron, always oversees that everything is in place and that my friends and I enjoy our meal. The staff are amazing and always have a knack for getting the food done and in a timely manner. I really love the decor of the place. It's small and quaint, yet it never feels crowded one bit. Best of all, the prices are not bad at all.

Amazing delish sandwiches!  Grilled cheese with a twist. Also great pulled pork for the non cheese eater in our group. Wonderful mac n cheese as well. So glad we ate here while in Brooklyn!,5.0
"Any place is better than this glorified studio with a sleeping loft.  We got there just before a group of the owner, Ron's, friends showed up.    Even though we had ordered well before them, Ron's friends all got food before us.  We ordered two salads, a sandwich and mac and cheese.  After waiting 15+ plus minutes while watching Ron's friends eat we finally got the sandwich.   The obviously stressed woman behind the counter (Ron took it upon himself to scold her in front of all of the patrons) told us that something had spilled in the kitchen and that's why the remainder of our order still had not been brought to us.  At 20+ minutes we finally got our salads and at 30 minutes we got our mac and cheese which was not worth the wait.  Ron came over to us and actually said ""it wasn't right that the other people got their food first"" and gave us a business card (in the garbage) for a ""comp"" next time and took the cheaper of the two salads off our bill.   Food, meh-to-bad (the avocado salad was almost inedible), the restaurant itself is terrible (almost have to climb a ladder to get to the sleeping loft, folding chairs at the one table on the ground floor) and I've said all I can say about the service.  Unless Ron has loads more friends to pay his bills and make up for his marginalized potential customer base,  this place will be shuttered within the year.P.S. they were out of the tomato soup, one of their signature items, at 6:30 on a Friday night.",1.0

"My friend and I were looking for an affordable quick meal in the neighborhood and came across this 4.5 star rated place.

Not to mention it was 15 min later when they finally grilled the sandwich! The cashier was unapologetic for our long wait and offered no explanation as to why it took so long to make one sandwich with bacon and avocado. We were the only ones waiting for the sandwich- really should not have taken so long. I really don't like writing bad reviews but honestly the service was subpar.

The last few times I've been there I got a sandwich with avocado, prociutto, cheddar, diced onions, and I think something else good, on a pretzel bun. It is freakin great. The tomato soup: freakin great. On the way out, Ronnie (the super cool and friendly owner) gave me a sample of sweet potato bread pudding: freakin great.

"If you're looking for grilled cheese and fresh ingredients this is definitely your spot! Found this gem by ways of Yelp and tried one of their signature sandwiches.  I didn't have a side because based on pictures their sandwiches looked pretty big and filling. For a summer afternoon, I left feeling pretty content.  The ingredients are definitely fresh and the service is fast.  I wish it was a tad cheesier but that's probably because I had so many other yummy ingredients in my sandwich.  Next time, though, I'll try the combo.  For those of us who feel like we'll be ready for a nap from a heavy comfort food kind of meal, perhaps a half a sandwich and side could be offered as a lunch special! I'm not sure what their usual lunch special runs like, but if they offered me half a grilled cheese with a cup of soup or side of mac or salad, I'd opt for that in a snap! I'll definitely be back to try something different.  Seems like I'd never be bored of options! Definitely recommend Mrs. Dorsey's!",4.0

"This place is amazing. I have only been once, but I plan to try it multiple times, until I try every sandwich that sounds good on the menu at least once. That might take me a couple of tries because just reading them on the menu is fun, because they are all interesting combinations. I had the Shroom melt yesterday and it was superb. Each sandwich is a departure from the run of the mill sandwiches of other sandwich shops. Mrs. Dorsey's Kitchen's sandwiches have character, and bring together flavors that work and taste great together that you may not have suspected would. The server was very friendly and she added to the experience. It was enjoyable speaking with her, and her presence and upbeat attitude made the place more cozy. I recommend anybody who frequents the area who hasn't tried it yet, to try it at least once. I'm sure you'll be pleased by the friendly smile and service of the young lady who works there and by the delicious and varied sandwich items on the menu.",5.0
"Bad experience....... We came here after a long walk in Brooklyn Botanical Garden on Sunday. After seeing very review, we decided to give a try.  My friend and I ordered the signature sandwiches - Mama mia, Guac & Bacon, Shroom Melt, and BKNY. They were all delicious!! UNFORTUNATELY, the service is not what customers want. I am not sure how long usually they make ONLY SANDWICH. I didn't understand why the food took so long for each sandwich. At that time it was not busy at all. The cashier didn't pay attention to our order and ask us twice what we ordered after we had been waiting for 20 mins. It seemed she messed up our sandwich and just fixed it. After the first order came and we had to wait another 15 mins to get the others. If we didn't usually stare at the counter to make sure when our food come, we wouldn't have it for sure since they kept talking and didn't pay attention to our food. The girl at the cashier didn't even say sorry for the wait. I am not sure if we were waiting for them making sushi or not. In sum, food is great but the service is in the opposite. We are not that happy our first try at Mr.Dorsey. Sorry....",2.0

If you're paying over $7 for grilled cheese, you want a generous helping of cheese.

"I visit MDK every chance I get when I'm in the city or in Brooklyn. The Turks and Queso is my ""Go To"" sandwich. I haven't had a better grilled cheese anywhere else. The Pop's Original is also really good. I added bacon to it and it takes it over the top!",5.0
"I attended the Windy City Wine Festival and had the pleasure of trying a delicious grilled cheese from, Mrs. Dorsey's Kitchen. Not only did they travel from NY to grace us with their presence, but they blew all other food vendors out of the water!!!! I ate the Jam Goat which has this amazingly creamy goat cheese, tart and sweet strawberry jam, and mint. It was tastebud shattering and if they weren't in NY, I would eat it at least once a week!",5.0
