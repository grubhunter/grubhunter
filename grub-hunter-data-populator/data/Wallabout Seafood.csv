"Undiscovered gem, but I doubt that lasts very long.  First off, the space (two stories of a corner brownstone) is utterly incredible.  Whoever renovated it must have put a ton of money into it, and it shows -- ample space (including larger tables for groups), perfect noise level (with a very good soundtrack of oldies/motown discreetly in the background), huge windows with beautiful dark wood floors.The food matches the surroundings.  The complimentary bread with house-made butter was amazing.  We started with oysters and burrata, and both were delicious -- the oysters were on the smallish side, but the well-sized portion of cheese with a tasty pea pesto made up for it.  (I think there was supposed to be bread with the burrata which didn't come, but we just attacked with the oyster spoons...didn't really miss it.)  For entrees, I had the seafood stew (heavy on shellfish), which was really tasty, but could have used (this is a theme) some bread to soak up the broth.  My fiancee had the squid ink pasta with shrimp, which was an absolutely enormous portion.  The pasta itself was good but not great, lacking a little punch in the flavor, but the shrimp were delicious and cooked perfectly.  Prices are eminently reasonable for the neighborhood/quality/quantity.Also, a tip of the cap to the bartender:  the 271 Sour is one of the best drinks I've had in a while, perfectly maple-y along with the bourbon.  The place was only about 75% full on a Saturday night and Opentable was wide open that afternoon for reservations, but I doubt that lasts.  Get here before it becomes a tough table to come by would be my advice.",5.0
"Wallabout is a new classy restaurant in Fort Greene. They have a great bar, beer and wine list, and cocktails. They also happen to serve a luxurious brunch and I need to come back for dinner sometime. For brunch, we ordered:English breakfast teaLobster omelet the brunch burgerEverything was delicious. Both dishes came with a side salad and either home fries or French fries. The salad was lightly dressed and had fresh ingredients and nice extras like cherry tomatoes. The home fries had a phenomenal seasoning and the French fries were crisp yet toothsome. The lobster omelet also had a marscapone type light cheese and the most delicate thin egg shell. It was so fresh, so refreshing to eat, even though omelets can trend toward being heavy. Perry polished off his burger quickly, but it was cooked medium as specified and was juicy.Service is very friendly and professional - she checked in on us a few times and was so sweet. We went for a late brunch so it was pretty quiet in here, hard to say what it's like for prime brunch hours. Prices are only a dollar or two more expensive than the standard brunch options in the neighborhood. I totally recommend it. They along have outdoor seating.Two cons. The signage is terribly hard to see, as they are going for the ""secret restaurant"" exclusive feel, which helps add ambiance for special dinners and such. They also have a step down from the sidewalk and a narrow layout which may make this a hard place to visit if you're in a wheel chair or part of the stroller brigade.",4.0
"We dined here on a quiet Thursday night around Christmas time and were pleasantly surprised.The oysters were fine, if not a bit fatty (might be typical for early winter), and the beet and burrata was nice. But the standout was the seafood stew. We ordered two, and not a drop was left, even though it was pretty substantial. Service was attentive, pleasant, and unintrusive. Music wasn't too loud, so you could actually hold a nice conversation. I wouldn't hesitate to return.",4.0
"Valentine's day is about the sweetness of hearts, the meeting of minds, and really good food at Wallabout Seafood and Co. Well at least it was this year because my sweet and thoughtful bf took me to  romantic Wallabout. Its living-room inspired decor in the main dining room is  an intimate ambience perfect for love. A combination of clean lines, track lighting and marble bar whisper (in its chillest voice) modern minimalist meets European savvy. We immediately felt warm and comfy, even though we were both over dressed. The other patrons were very casual.We started the meal with a sparkling wine. An enchanting Pinot Noir, dry and flavorful, that I preferred over my can't-remember-what-I-had cocktail. He had the impressionable old man and the sea, smoky, strong and smooth.Moved on to the winning Hamachi. In my opinion the right amount of horseradish goes well with any meat or fish, so I was a fan when I read it on the menu but I wish we would've gotten the tuna tartare as well. And for our mains, he chose the hanger steak which he raved about and the sauce for my lobster was delicious and the lobster itself was cooked to sumptuous almost perfection even though I suspect it had been frozen, but I found the portion of the entire dish to be a tad small for an entree. There was also a crazy carrot to lobster ratio. We ended our meal with the chocolate mousse and the ice cream sundae. Both were pretty but we preferred the ice cream sundae. Something about that butter scotch...",4.0
"Yay! A seafood restaurant in the neighborhood! And the tuna entrée sure lives up to its expectations- with veggies and purée on the side. We started with the octopus app which was delightful. It had a potato purée and chorizo on the side. We sampled a couple of cocktails - mine was delish, gin with lime sherbet. Service was good and the restaurant has a very relaxing atmosphere (like a brownstone home). Downstairs is a bit more vibrant with the bar and booth tables. Upstairs is more for the romantic and intimate dinners. Outdoor dining is set on a pretty brick patio. Next spring they are opening a deck off the dining room. Looking forward to trying their brunch.",5.0
"Very happy with the service. We took our kid with us and I was pleasantly surprised by the level of service they gave us considering that we were the only ones with a child. They gave us a baby chair for her to sit. The server also told us what were some food options that were child friendly. We decided to give her both carrots and butter nut squash soup, which were very yummy. The tuna tartar was very fresh and the octopus appetizer was nice and tender. The miso salmon reminded me of pho, with the vermicelli noodles. It was a bit salty with the miso and bacon in the soup. The shrimp linguine tasted fresh and not too heavy because of the lemon. The fish and chips came very hot and fresh. The portion was big and the fries were perfectly flavored/fried. The panna cotta has different layers to keep me interested. The top layer tasted like almond roca, which was the best part of it. In terms of price, it was a bit expensive but we left stuffed. It was worth the money and I am waiting for a reason to go back again.",5.0
"I've seen this location go through so many iterations and have been curious to check out the most recent version (5.0?) since it first opened. I finally made it to Wallabout Seafood for dinner a couple of weeks ago, and I have to say that I think it's the most promising restaurant to open on this corner so far, and it's a welcome addition to the neighborhood (which lacks seafood options in general). Their attention to detail and combination of flavors and textures is really unusual and thoughtful, and the presentation of the dishes is beautiful. I also thought the service was great, and our server was brand new.My husband and I shared the grilled octopus and scallop appetizers, both of which were delicious. The octopus ranked among the top three octopus dishes I've ever tasted. So tender and flavorful. The scallops were also perfectly cooked and came with some sort of raisin accompaniment that sounded questionable but took the dish on to a different playing field.For entrees we had the seared tuna and the seafood stew. Both were very satisfying. My only very minor criticisms of the stew were that they were out of lobster the night we went, so there wasn't any in the stew, and the broth is more ""gochujang"" based than ""kimchi"" based, but I'm Korean so that probably wouldn't matter to most people. It barely mattered to me. :-) Overall a very great experience. Looking forward to many more.",5.0
"Came in for brunch with a large group of eight and lucked out by getting the second floor mainly to ourselves. GREAT eggs benedict with pork belly, super personable server whose name I wish I remember so I could shout him out personally, and two hours of bottomless mimosas for $15 left us incredibly satisfied. This is a bit of a trek from my neighborhood in Bushwick but I will definitely be back.",5.0
"As promised in my January 1 review, we made a return trip with the intent of actually trying out the food. And I'm glad we did as the food was very good indeed. We went without a reservation this time so as to be under the radar.Our server Joshua, was great -- very outgoing and helpful. We started with a bottle of the Bailly Lapierre sparkling wine. The manager who handled the wine service was friendly and pleasant.For appetizers we had the scallops and the beet and burrata. The menu here changes some, but if the scallops are on the menu, you should definitely try them. The scallops themselves are well cooked and have the sweetness one expects, and the curried cauliflower they are served with is excellent. The beets were very nice as well, but we found the malt crumble the burrata sits on not add much to the dish -- well executed, but just not able to hold their own against the scallops.Around this time the bread arrived, and we enjoyed that very much. Joshua told us it was baked to order, which could be the case given the flatbread nature of it. It was warn and delicious, crispy on the outside, chew inside. The accompanying butter was interesting, and it sounds like they do some manipulation of it, though I'm not sure exactly what.Our mains were the seared tuna with a cider glaze and the whole roasted fish. Both were excellent. The whole fish is served head- and tail-on and very simply roasted (then quickly grill marked). The meat was very moist and the skin was completely edible (not chewy). The side dish was a very tasty chickpea ragout and black garlic sauce. Simple and delicious.The tuna dish was very good as well. The cider glaze with the perfectly medium-rare tuna was delicious. I didn't try the puree that accompanied it, but I heard no complaints.Finally, we rounded out the meal with the panna cotta. It was light and not overly sweet (which I like in a dessert) with subtle lemon flavor and fresh blueberries (not where where they got plump, juicy berries right now). Good stuff overall.The oysters on surrounding tables looked great. Large and, since we were there during happy hour, inexpensive. I'll definitely try them on my next visit.And that is that. Great experienc all around, and we will definitely be back. We're happy to have them in the neighborhood.",5.0
"We finally found a place in our neighborhood that completely sweeps us off our feet! And that is saying a lot because there are some good gems in fort Greene. We have had dinner here and now here today for our 2nd brunch experience. We have been impressed with everything we have had here. Let's touch on brunch though. I had the pork belly egg Benedict and my girl had salmon egg Benedict. The flavors are perfect! The seasoning on the potatoes I have never had, and it's beyond impressive. Hollandaise sauce is perfect, and so is the complimentary dressing on the salad to wrap it all together. It's our new favorite spot.The seafood here is on point! I don't even like oysters. ""I do now!"" Had the miso salmon for dinner. amazing!To top it all off, the servers are fun and personable and the service is premium.",5.0
"This place is delicious- great ambience, amazing food and wine selection. Great place for a date- has the look taste and feel of an expensive spot in the city but not nearly as hard on the wallet.

The upstairs is the gorgeous parlor floor (must see!) with a beautiful bay window we sat in and looked over the neighborhood- picturesque evening really. Only thing I would say is that the music downstairs was a little too amped up for a Tuesday night, but we sat upstairs where it was a cool but relaxed vibe.

"The food was delicious and the presentation was beautiful.  Service was so personable, professional, and fun!  The space has been recently renovated and restored giving you the feeling that you're in a beautiful brownstone home.  There's an entire second floor to the restaurant (where we sat) which I never knew existed when looking in from outside.  The cocktails were all great. My fiance and another friend tried a Serbian wine out of curiosity and both loved it.  Friends got the lobster and loved it, another friend had the seafood stew which was fantastic and the waitress brought us bread towards the end encouraging that we would want to take advantage of the delicious broth (she was right).  I had the tuna which was one of the best (*the best?) I've had.  When we arrived we were out front catching up with friends before we walked in and didn't realize we had started shmoozing with the owner who was also out front saying goodnight to his family.  He welcomed us in and got us set up himself, introducing us to the manager and asking him to take good care of us before he headed out.  We're excited to come back and try their brunch which we're told can include a 2 hour bottomless mimosa",5.0

"I want to say one positive thing: the staff was very nice. Sadly, the food was not. My miso salmon was cold, the octopus appetizer was cold, my friend's shrimp linguine tasted bizarre.

I should've sent the salmon back but usually don't do that at restaurants. This was the first time I considered it.",1.0
"Wallabout is set in a beautiful re-furbished brownstone on the corner of DeKalb and Adelphi. The first floor has more of a parlor type feel with the second floor as a more formal dining vibe. The music in the restaurant reflected the difference between the two floors but could also be a bit loud when the restaurant was relatively empty. Once the place filled up, it seemed to recede to the background as the various conversations took over. We had a reservation at 7:30 and despite showing up 20 minutes early were immediately seated in bay window table for 4 on the second floor. While it was a nice secluded table, it offered some challenges for the waitstaff to work around due to the relatively tight space behind the chairs. Our waitress was knowledgeable about the menu and extremely engaging, offering good explanations behind each of her food and drink recommendations. We ended up sharing three appetizers, the grilled spanish octopus, beets and burrata, and the scallops. The octopus shined the brightest out of the three with the scallops also well cooked. The beets and burrata were good as well, but the malt crumble that accompanied them had a bit too much of a charred taste for my liking. For the mains, I had the tuna after reading a few of the previous recommendations here. I have to agree that it was excellent with the celery root puree and grilled vegetables complementing the fish well. The grilled whole fish was also ordered for someone at the table. However, there was a miscommunication where my party wanted to have the fish filleted for them but the waitstaff had to be reminded. Having the fish filleted at the table was a really nice touch that Wallabout offers (definitely recommend if you have a tough time doing it yourself!) For dessert we had the chocolate mousse and caramel sundae. The sundae was served in a glass and was the better of the two. Overall, I really liked my experience at Wallabout. The food is good and the staff is attentive, but had a couple of miscommunications that may simply be attributed to growing pains. Looking forward to going back soon!",4.0

"Clocking in at just two months old, Wallabout Seafood's consistent 5-star rating is well deserved. I'm a person who orders octopus every time I find it on a menu.

The lighting is intimate (I'm a sucker for good lighting). The atmosphere succeeds at making you feel more like your eating in someone's home. Though a very tasteful and thoughtful ""someone"".

"Wow, this was the worst dining experience I've had in New York. Avoid this place at all costs. Apologies for length but so much went wrong it's hard to express how miserable our experience was without detailing the events one by one. First we came in and ordered a dozen oysters. 15-20 minutes later we were told they were sorry but the oysters wouldn't be coming. So we ordered three appetizers instead. Another 10 minutes go by and we were told that in fact the oysters were coming. So we asked that one of our appetizers get canceled. Well, then they brought all of the appetizers out anyway. When we said we hadn't ordered them they just took them away immediately but of course still charged us for them later (this is a recurring theme). We also told them that we had a diner with a gluten allergy. The server kept saying he would ask the kitchen which if any dishes had a hidden gluten element (e.g., a sauce thickened with wheat). He clearly was afraid to ask the kitchen because he told us the only thin we could have was the whole roasted fish (this after he brought us and charged us for the appetizers which sure seemed gluten free--the oysters were just oysters!) Then they bring us the wrong entree--it was the swordfish--and just asked us if we could eat that instead! When we reminded him about the gluten allergy he said ""Oh, no I checked about this too and its fine."" So of course he just made this up. We decided then that we couldn't trust the food and would just leave and wouldn't you know it they comped us nothing and charged us for all the dishes we didn't order including the ones that they had mistakenly brought us and asked us to keep. This place was a joke, and they should be embarrassed. What a nightmare.",1.0
Awesome brand new place on my block... Amazingly fresh seafood dishes !!! Had a tuna that is out of this world... Awesome scallops & tartar  my new fav spot !,5.0
"Honestly, I agree with everyone else on what they have to say about this place. Food is exceptional, service is perfect, drinks are creative and great, price was expensive but worth it, and the atmosphere and esthetic is just okay. But the one thing I couldn't get past was the music. It was annoyingly terrible and didn't fit the setting(or the neighborhood). It reminded me of one of those cheesy Thai or Japanese restaurants that play fist bumping music. I tried to ignore it at first but then my date started bringing up how loud and awful the music was.I really loved everything else about this place but I'm not sure if I will go back.",3.0
"Came here for my friends birthday brunch on news years day, we had a blast and the food was amazing! Cracking oysters with sriracha and red mignonette... Beautiful Eggs Benny with salmon on one half of my muffin, pork belly on the other (I couldn't choose so they let me have both!). Such a nice space, we already booked the amazing window table (worth asking for) for a couple weeks time when my wife's mum comes to visit.",5.0
"Our dining experience was great! The food is very good, the staff is very accommodating and the ambience is perfect. We had the oysters (SO fresh!!), tuna pan seared rare and the whole fish, which upon request was kindly filleted at our table!Things that could be improved: sharp knives for the entree but the butter knives did cut the food just fine; the sides were lukewarm; the fish needed a little more seasoning; and the salted caramel ice cream was really salty in each bite. When my server asked how it was I told her and she took it off the bill. Truly excellent service! The restaurant opened up about a month ago and has a lot of promise!",4.0
"Yaaas. This place brings flavor, and does so artfully with fish. So much more than just lemon and freshness. The tuna with celery root puree was hearty and delicious. One added and unexpected bonus was the wine selection. It was well explained by our server and paired really beautifully with the dishes we ordered. Dessert did not disappoint. Don't skip the mousse.",5.0
"This place is amazing!!!!! We used to live right by and now moved otherwise we would be here weekly! Food amazing, decor amazing, and our server Joshua was super great!

"Was snubbed at Maison Premier. What a blessing that turned out to be. My family and I were out to celebrate my son's 25th birthday... I called Wallabout and was told "" Come right over, we'll have a table ready for you."" From beginning to end, we had a fabulous night. The waitstaff was attentive but not overbearing. The food amazing. When in Brooklyn, this place is a must. We will be returning.",5.0
"Can't recommend this place enough. Beautiful brownstone interior, unique cocktails, excellent service. The octopus appetizer was one of the most memorable dishes I've had in quite some time--totally unique flavor combinations. We don't usually order dessert, but we went for the ice cream sunday (ice cream, butterscotch, malt foam and crunchy little bits of something). Totally worth it.",5.0
"Wow, this was the worst dining experience I've had in New York. Avoid this place at all costs. Apologies for length but so much went wrong it's hard to express how miserable our experience was without detailing the events one by one. First we came in and ordered a dozen oysters. 15-20 minutes later we were told they were sorry but the oysters wouldn't be coming. So we ordered three appetizers instead. Another 10 minutes go by and we were told that in fact the oysters were coming. So we asked that one of our appetizers get canceled. Well, then they brought all of the appetizers out anyway. When we said we hadn't ordered them they just took them away immediately but of course still charged us for them later (this is a recurring theme). We also told them that we had a diner with a gluten allergy. The server kept saying he would ask the kitchen which if any dishes had a hidden gluten element (e.g., a sauce thickened with wheat).

"This is a lovely place, beautiful ambience, very friendly staff and delicious food. My husband had Tuna, done to perfection and I had Salmon with udon. Very yummy .

"First of all, thank you very much for the Royal treatment we have received at the Wallabout restaurant.It was the evening the remember. Everything was PERFECT. Beginning from the tasteful décor, very professional staff, spotless setting, upbeat music, the menu which any food critic would read as a manual, the wine selection and, of course, the FOOD itself. I love cooking. I consider any good cooking as an fine art. That evening, all my senses been pleased - including visual.  The food can compete and win any high level competition.Please convey it to the chef.I will, most definitely, spread the word about the Wallabout restaurant - the gem of the Green Point.Dina Perepelitsky",5.0
"This place is simply fantastic! From the 'on point and incredibly friendly' service to the memorable meals and deserts..my bf and I were thoroughly pleased.We were apparently the restaurant's first ever reservation (of 10 very vocal and excited customers) visiting to celebrate my bf's 30th bday.. Not only were the staff very patient and incredibly sweet with us but even brought a free round of champagne and shots to celebrate! One of the memorable dishes we had was the tuna tartare as an appetizer which I can still taste, mmmm..the seafood stew as main course was packed w/ many well blended flavors and the the salmon w/ quinoa and shiitake mushrooms was the perfect follow up to the tuna tartar..the salmon melts in your mouth and the mushrooms brought everything together nicely. The chocolate moose cake was rich and Delish! So much for making this a short and sweet review haha - oh and our server was so adorable, fast acting and funny..can't wait to go back :)",5.0
Just came from there and so very impressed. I had the hanger steak; my husband the tuna tartar and scallops.  The tastes were incredible and the presentation beautifully done. The service was fantastic. Thank you Joshua!  The ambience was perfect. We were both very impressed and excited to have this restaurant in our neighborhood. We shall gladly return!,5.0

"Was there for first time last night. Was absolutely blown away by the grace and beauty of the building. The finishing touches are incredible and it has truly beautiful  bay windows overlooking the lovely street which enhances the already extremely romantic atmosphere. Service was excellent with a very knowledgeable and fun staff. But best was the food! Incredible Tuna Tartar but absolutely blown away by the Octopus. Perfectly done , tender and tasty. The entrees were equally interesting and tasty. This place is a must for a night out with that special person!",5.0

"Everything we had was delicious - scallops, squid ceviche, squid ink pasta with shrimp, whole roasted Dorade, and chocolate mousse- the portions were also just right and not at stingy. Good bang for the buck. Everything is prepared in house, right down to the bread and butter and all their ice cream. The interior is nice and spacious, not over-crowded and noisy with tables right on top of each other like most Brooklyn restaurants. While the staff was perhaps a tiny bit over-eager, they were there when needed and the meal timing was pretty perfect. Will come back next time to enjoy their sizeable bar and chef-designed cocktails.",5.0
"Went for brunch and had a great time! Restaurant has great lighting, plenty of seating (indoor and out), an unlimited mimosa deal (that the staff really keep coming) and a friendly atmosphere.

"I could honestly write 50 thousand words about this spot.. But I'll keep it short and say, GO HERE. Beautiful attention to detail from everything to decor, finishings, and of course, anything edible. The cocktails are inventive in a strange nostalgic way which absolutely confirms the designers taste, knowledge and passions for what they do. The chef is a total rockstar and gives your palette something to remember. Nearly everything seems to be made ""in house"" and with such care you'll actually be inspired. They could honestly charge more but the fact that they don't adds to their charm. My wife, infant (very kid friendly place) and I practically had genuine conversations with almost the entire staff. I cannot emphasize enough the 'genuine' when I say that. A+ to the owners, managers, and all staff. Very well thought out place and it shows.

"This is a newly opened restaurant in the neighborhood. You can't tell, but there are two floors! And I'm not quite sure why, but there are never that many people dining inside. It's a shame because the food is really delicious. We had the scallops and octopus appetizers, which were very impressive in flavor and portion. Very few places can do an octopus well, and this was probably one of the best I've had in Fort Greene (which has a lot of great restaurants that have it on the menu). Our entree was the chicken, which was not the most glamorous item on the menu, but still tasted great when combined with the garnishes. Note that the portions for every item were very generous and definitely filling for two people to share. Also, we were treated to a discount on the house! It was such a nice surprise. The atmosphere of the restaurant is a little funny. It feels like an attempted upscale manhattan/italian/brighton lounge spot rather than something in Brooklyn. The servers are mostly buff dudes with tough guy accents, who hover a little too attentively, but are all still very nice. It's definitely not the typical look of a hipstery new joint in Brooklyn. It's a great addition to the area and I'm excited to go back there for more seafood and dessert.",5.0
"Not bad, hoping it will get better. Food was good to mostly great. Started with the scallops which were tasty but marred by a very tough component (Brussel sprout leaf?). Service was nervous and slightly overbearing -- went from no attention to way too much. At one stage, seven staff stood around idly while  we waited for service, at another, our server lurched in on our table at awkward times. Seating was a little odd, we had to change seats because the in-between of the cushions, on the inside long seat (by windows), is VERY uncomfortable. Still, the food was mostly great and I'm optimistic that our next visit could be too.",3.0
