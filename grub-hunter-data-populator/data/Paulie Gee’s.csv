"Delicious!! Definitely made my top 3 favorite pizza  places (the others being robertas and best pizza). We've been meaning to come forever but the line is always so long.

I would highly recommend this tactic to those of you who have been meaning to come and haven't been able to due to the wait -- the food will be worth it. We ordered the hellboy, ricotta be kidding me and the hot honey ice cream Sunday for dessert. The hellboy was our fave. It was basically a pepperoni pizza with hot honey lined under the cheese.

"My husband and I visited Paulie Gee's about two years ago and he still dreams of the Hellboy. This time we ordered the Hellboy and Cherry Jones.  The Hellboy was great but just a touch too sweet for me.  The hot honey adds a little kick but is definitely not too hot.  My husband will tell you it is the best pizza he has ever had (saying a lot since he was raised in the Bronx).  The Cherry Jones on the other hand was way too sweet for both of us.  I couldn't taste anything other then honey.  My husband embarrassed me by telling the waitress we didn't like it.  She offered us a replacement.  We ordered the Ricky Ricotta.  It was alright.  I was shocked because the ricotta was not warm.  The crust at Paulie Gee's is the perfect texture.  However, two of our three pizzas were too charred for my taste.  I must mention Paulie walks around all the tables to make sure everyone is enjoying.  Love it!  The restaurant is too dark and loud for my taste.",3.0

"Some of the best za in the city, bar none. The lady and I traveled far and wide for it since we'd heard such great things. It was a Friday night so the restaurant was predictably packed. There's not much in the form of a waiting area, which particularly sucked given how freezing the weather was, but we had a feeling the pie would be well worth the wait (plus we also got to watch a tipsy couple aggressively suck face up close and personal which was an unexpected but enjoyable twist).The vibe was cool, featuring low--lighting, a huge and beautiful custom brick oven, and trendy attractive people who's favorite bands you've never heard of.When we finally were seated I was stoked to see the menu offered a huge variety of pies with all sorts of niche toppings AND vegan options(I personally don't give two damns about veganism but they presented them in an unpretentious way so I was cool with it). We eventually decided to go with the Hell Boy and the Prokypineapple, both of which were amazing, and I'm looking forward to going back and further chowing my way down the menu.Go here.",5.0
"After a 2-hours wait on a weekend for a party of 2, we finally got a table at the renowned pizza shop in Brooklyn. After having one of the best pizzas of all time at Little Isabella located in Baltimore, I was on the mission to find its companion in NYC. Overhyped as we suspected, Paulie Gee had nothing on Little Isabella! Perhaps, it was the quirky blend of sweet and savory flavors, but with that 2-hour wait, we surely did not have a pleasing experience.We ordered two pies: HellBoy and Greenpointer. HellBoy: Fresh Mozzarella, Italian Tomatoes, Berkshire Sopressata Piccante, Parmigiano Reggiano and Mike's HOT HoneyGreenpointer:Fresh Mozzarella, Baby Arugula, Olive Oil, Fresh Lemon Juice and Shaved Parmigiano ReggianoWe didn't really enjoy the sweetness of the honey in the HellBoy or the sourness of the lemon juice in the Greenpointer. Fresh, as we saw them make each pie to order, I definitely thought the doughiness of the pizza wasn't anything spectacular. In terms of service, I think it was pretty solid. Our waiter was patient and helpful. As a surprise, Paulie Gee himself introduced himself to just about every table, making it feel quite personable. In all, I definitely wouldn't return back to this pizzeria, especially with that crazy wait. During that 2-hour wait and 1.5-hour dining time, I can drive down to Baltimore and get some Little Isabella for half the price and no wait!",3.0
"3.5 stars for this pizza joint hidden behind a HUGE wooden door all the way down Franklin streetCrust was good with a nice char on the hellboy but the crust of the greenpoint pizza seemed a bit underdone We were quoted a 1.5 hour wait at 8pm for 3 on a Saturday but we were lucky that people in front of us hadn't returned so we were seated right away! (so don't be discouraged)---hellboy: everything was good about this except that spicy honey! Should of gone with a more classic margherita style pizza instead---greenpoint: fresh arugula, with a bit too much lemon juice, so nothing special NOTE: they don't have pepper flakes, only chili oil",4.0
"If you want great pizza and the right atmosphere look no further than Paulie Gee's. We sat at the bar (luckily) and avoided a two hour wait.  The pizza choices are numerous, with some very creative options. There were three of us and we started with two pies. Would have been content but it was so good we ordered a third.The texture. The crust. The toppings. Hard pressed to mention anything I didn't like. I love pizza and this place is right up there with the best. That includes many pizzerias throughout Italy.Paulie stopped by for a chat and he has a fantastic personality. Great stories and it is obvious that he loves what he does and holds him team to very high standards.He was also kind enough to give me an official Paulie Gee's pin and a limoncello. A very nice touch!Make sure you check out the pizza oven in the back. It's a small,cozy place so don't pass this place up in you are in NY.",5.0
I take my pizza very seriously. The vegan pizza is so good here that if they didn't tell you it was vegan you would have no clue. I had the pie with vegan sausage and shared a few others with friends. It was all out of this world. I can't wait to go back again.,5.0
"There's a LOT of really great pizza in NYC, that's nothing new. But combine amazing pizza with friendly, caring service and a killer ambiance, and Paulie Gee's has a leg up on a lot of the other heavy hitters. The wait can be crazy, but we came in on a Tuesday night and it was half empty. I guess the key is to come when there's post-blizzard sludge everywhere and no one else wants to go out. Paulie Gee was there as I'm told he usually is, weaving around the space with his cup of coffee and stopping at literally every table. For us, he offered to curate our pizza order and who were we to argue? Read on for what Paulie Gee himself recommends:- The Greenpointer: according to Paulie, basically like eating a salad due to the piles of fresh baby arugula on top. - The Mo Cheeks: My personal favorite of the meal. The pickled onions on there are a nice surprise, and give a nice kick to the rest of the ingredients. - The Monte Cristo: OK, so this is probably something I would never think to order myself, but I'm glad it came out for us because it's actually super tasty. It comes with Canadian bacon and a drizzle of maple syrup, which I know sounds weird but trust me (or rather, trust Paulie). - I didn't catch the name of the last pizza, but it was one of the best and after peeking at the menu again I think it might have been the Hellboy. It was piled high with the tastiest Berkshire Sopressata, and it was perfect with the side of Mike's hot honey (which you haven't tried on pizza you must immediately). They asked if we wanted a dessert pizza but at that point we were stuffed to the gills. It was one of the best New York pizza experiences I've had so far, and the service is what really puts them above and beyond. I'm going to run for vice-president of the Paulie Gee fanclub soon!",5.0
"Came here a few days ago with my friend after work. Very dark inside, took some time for my eyeballs to adjust lol. We started off with some beers and then went with the Hellboy which was AMAZING. The hot honey makes a difference! Then we went with a vegan pie since neither one of us was particularly full. We ordered one with spinach, sea salt and garlic on it (sorry don't remember the name!) It was OK, not that memorable. The standout is by far Hellboy, the crust for both pizzas was SUPER THIN, firm and didn't fall apart on me. We both liked it. I took off a star for the spinach pie being nothing special and that it's a bit on the pricey side. Overall, I think I'll be back to try the other pizzas on the menu!",4.0
"Maybe we came on an off night, but we didn't care too much about the pizza and it was definitely not the best we've had. My friend wanted to celebrate her belated birthday at Paulie Gee's and so we did. We ordered 3 pies (Greenpointer, Ricotta Be Kidding Me, and The Hometown Brisket). I think the Hometown Brisket was our favorite only because of the BBQ sauce. Other than that, there wasn't much brisket pieces on the pizza. Ricotta Be Kidding Me was okay. The Greenpointer was all greens so that balanced our meal a little bit. I hear people waiting for hours to get a seat here and right now I'm just wondering where all the hype went? We came when they were opening, so thank goodness we didn't wait on line for this...cause it wouldn't have been worth it. FYI: There's no sign outside that says ""Paulie Gee's"". You just have to look by the address number ""60"" in order to find this place. I actually walked passed it while we were trying to find it. Also, use your flash on your phones to read the menu. I really liked the rustic interior but it was literally pitch black in there.",3.0
"Zagat rated the hellboy as the best pizza in NYC. Wow! Big call Zagat... We had to try! We would say it was delicious... But I would have to say Marta is equal of not just ahead. We got here at 6:40 and had to wait over an hr to sit at the bar. When getting here service was prompt and food was great! We ordered the hellboy and the hellified porkpie white and I have to say it was fresh, full of flavor and great value. My only critique would be more hot suppressa on the hellified and take numbers at the door! It's a little unreasonable to ask people to wait 90 mins and not offer to call when table it ready. Either way it was great but probably won't be crossing the river to wait another 90 mins.",4.0
"If there was ever a restaurant that inspires the need for #PiDay (3.14) to be everyday, it is Paulie Gee's. The pizza is a true art, and every bite is important, from the center to the crust crust.  PG is located in pizza heaven, or right near the water on Greenpoint Ave if you want a Google Map friendly address.Read it on my blog: highclasstohighlifes.com…As you'll see below I'm constantly on the proscuitt of happiness but this time we went for a different ham, Canadian bacon, and on the Monte Cristo. You bet it counted towards happiness. This pizza combines maple syrup drizzle and gouda with the ham. Yes, yes and more yes. Paulie asked if we had butter on the crust...sadly, no. SO MUCH REGRET....that I'll be back in no time to try it. You'll notice on the menu that they have a brisket pizza that features Hometown BBQ -- I love this local BK collaboration. You can get sauced the other way too with Greenpoint local brews!Anyway, I have nearly eaten my way through the entire menu (still need to do a bit of adventuring on the vegan side, every time I get close, I just want meat...) and I have been very pleased with every slice thus far. Therefore my advice to you is go with the pizza that's toppings are most appealing...or grab a handful of friends and share, then you can try multiple pizzas!The man, who is not a myth, but definitely a legend is often found inside checking in on tables, ensuring quality control and getting to know the patrons. He loved my last Instagram post that did a little play words...sharing that I was on the prosciutt of happiness with his King Henry Classic. He's always all smiles and usually wearing a great hat, he is Paulie Gee himself. Paulie Gee's - High Class to High Lifes If you really knead to get delivery or pickup, you'll have to look elsewhere for now though. The only way to leave Paulie Gee's with a to-go box is with leftovers. Rumor has it that a slice joint is opening up nearby though! I'm counting down the days, hours and minutes. Want to keep drooling? Read the menu!Pro Tip: Grab dinner at Paulie Gee's then walk straight out on the water in Greenpoint to Transmitter park or the outlook. Maybe even catch a sunset and BYO night cap!",5.0
"My old pal Carlos and I visited Paulie Gee's last night and had a great meal. I'm accustomed to going with the ol' vegan girlfriend and have a tradition where we split two pies from their extensive vegan selection, so we can try two different types of pies. The vegan and non-vegan selections are both extensive; each category has at least a half dozen kinds of pies, including oil bases, white slices, marinara, spinach-based, spicy honey and barbecue sauce foundations. The pies are aesthetically pleasing to every sense, well, every sense except sound. It's usually better when sound isn't a factor. At least when you're talking about food. When you're talking about music, sound is obviously a very important sense to talk about. I may go as far as to say that in a conversation about music, sound is the only sense that matters.I was excited to go with Carlos because I was going to get to eat their meat and actual cheese. The Paulie Gee's brisket is lean and delicious. Their pickled red onions possess a truly memorable tang and are worth spending a couple buck to add on to pretty much any pie. The ricotta dollops on the Ricky Ricotta feel more like bursts of a cream sauce than regular old cheese. Interestingly, the dairy and non-dairy ricotta cheeses are almost indecipherable in quality, which goes to show that Paulie Gee's knows what's up. Carlos and I were pleased to compliment the trad Italian flavors of the Ricky Ricotta with a tangy Barbecue Brisket pie. I'm psyched to go with a fellow omnivore again, because there are tons of other flavor combos I'm eager to try. New Yorkers, such as myself, are notorious for being dicks about the quality of pizza dough. It's the dough that invalidates the Chicago Deep Dish's false aspiration to pizza status. I can't stand Sicilian pizza either, which is a controversial take in Nueva York. Anyhow, no matter how well adorned a Paulie Gee's pie is, its base--the crust--is its most distinct and wonderful element. The crust is thin but springy, and always a little charred. It's pretty much naan bread, which is either a very luck coincidence or a visionary innovation. Naan bread, as you know, is lit, and, as it turns out, it is the perfect surface upon which various pizza ingredients should be placed and/or spread to mingle harmoniously.I've visited Paulie Gee's a number of times, and there's a bit of narrative that forms around my visits. The first time I tried to go, it was around noon, and my gf and I made the unpleasant discovery that Paulie Gee's does not open til 5 PM. The next time, we rolled up in a deep crew of six and had to wait about two to three hours for a table for six. If you find yourself in that position, you'll be okay though because there are plenty of bars around. There's also the water/skyline, mere yards away and a nice record store a block away.The gf and I have gone a few other times and it's always been great--except for the one time that a camera crew was shooting a special on Paulie Gee's vegan options. My girlfriend and I were in the shot all throughout our meal, and we were fighting (as subtly as possible) for the duration of our meal. I was taken aback and somewhat miffed when the producers of the show asked to do a talking head with us outside. The tension was palpable but they still insisted on interviewing us. I really do believe that you should foot the bill if you're going to interview someone for your television series or web series or gratuitously long Yelp review or whatever. At LEAST commission me to write a song for the soundtrack.In closing, I would like to offer a lil sum sum for the ladies. Are you interested in grandfatherly, charmingly blue collar, short men whose personalities closely resemble those of most Robert De Niro characters--but only in David O. Russel movies? If you do, and might want to be possibly hit on by a man of this caliber, you will love Paulie Gee's. At all times, Paulie Gee's eponymous Pizza Architect and Entrepreneur, Paulie Gee, stalks the narrow spaces between tables, checking in with customers--particularly of the reasonably attractive female demographic--and asks them how their food is, making small talk and thanking them for their patronage. I think this is cool. I would do the same if I were in his position, so don't take this the wrong way. Central to Paulie Gee's game is his ability to recommend a pizza place in seemingly every zip code on the planet and his inclination to tell you (the lady in question) the name of the dude who works there/owns the place, and to tell you (still the lady in question) to tell the dude (who owns the pizza place) to say that he (Paulie Gee) says hi. The Brotherhood of Pizza Mans is truly alive and well.",5.0

"I almost feel like it's blasphemy for not giving 5 stars. Finally made my way over here at Paulie Gees after way too long. Clearly this place is GPs staple so was excited to drop by on Wednesday night.There was no wait- very good. I had been worried about this so called 3x around 6:45pm to see how long it was before heading over. No one picked up and their answering service basically hangs up on you. I ordered the Daniela and he ordered the brisket pizza. Mine came out a good 7 minutes before his. I noticed immediately that about 40% of the crust was charred to the point of being inedible. To top that off, the spinach topping my pizza was the same. It was literally a black piece of ash and when I picked a leaf up or crumbled in my hands. The cheese blend was very good (mozzarella and Parmesan) but the pizza was just not good. To top it off, parts of the center were soggy and didn't hold the toppings when I grabbed a slice. When the brisket pizza came out a few minutes later I noticed immediately that it was cooked perfectly. The crust was edible and delicious. I was bummed that mine didn't come out this way especially since it seemed like a classic. All I can say is they probably put our orders in together and maybe his needed a little longer in the oven. Mine was most likely getting over cooked while his needed a few more minutes. Hence the gap in time between both of our orders coming out and the reason why mine was half done by the time his came out.I was really disappointed but the good thing to know is at least the brisket pizza was cooked well. I know there is a good meal at Paulie Gees but I feel like we were jipped.Also, great touch that Paulie himself came in to greet all the diners. He was super friendly and it brings a family quality to the place. This is maybe one of the main reasons I'd come back.",3.0

There's not much in the form of a waiting area, which particularly sucked given how freezing the weather was, but we had a feeling the pie would be well worth the wait (plus we also got to watch a tipsy couple aggressively suck face up close and personal which was an unexpected but enjoyable twist).The vibe was cool, featuring low--lighting, a huge and beautiful custom brick oven, and trendy attractive people who's favorite bands you've never heard of.When we finally were seated I was stoked to see the menu offered a huge variety of pies with all sorts of niche toppings AND vegan options(I personally don't give two damns about veganism but they presented them in an unpretentious way so I was cool with it). We eventually decided to go with the Hell Boy and the Prokypineapple, both of which were amazing, and I'm looking forward to going back and further chowing my way down the menu.Go here.",5.0
"After a 2-hours wait on a weekend for a party of 2, we finally got a table at the renowned pizza shop in Brooklyn. After having one of the best pizzas of all time at Little Isabella located in Baltimore, I was on the mission to find its companion in NYC. Overhyped as we suspected, Paulie Gee had nothing on Little Isabella! Perhaps, it was the quirky blend of sweet and savory flavors, but with that 2-hour wait, we surely did not have a pleasing experience.We ordered two pies: HellBoy and Greenpointer. HellBoy: Fresh Mozzarella, Italian Tomatoes, Berkshire Sopressata Piccante, Parmigiano Reggiano and Mike's HOT HoneyGreenpointer:Fresh Mozzarella, Baby Arugula, Olive Oil, Fresh Lemon Juice and Shaved Parmigiano ReggianoWe didn't really enjoy the sweetness of the honey in the HellBoy or the sourness of the lemon juice in the Greenpointer. Fresh, as we saw them make each pie to order, I definitely thought the doughiness of the pizza wasn't anything spectacular. In terms of service, I think it was pretty solid. Our waiter was patient and helpful. As a surprise, Paulie Gee himself introduced himself to just about every table, making it feel quite personable. In all, I definitely wouldn't return back to this pizzeria, especially with that crazy wait. During that 2-hour wait and 1.5-hour dining time, I can drive down to Baltimore and get some Little Isabella for half the price and no wait!",3.0
"3.5 stars for this pizza joint hidden behind a HUGE wooden door all the way down Franklin streetCrust was good with a nice char on the hellboy but the crust of the greenpoint pizza seemed a bit underdone We were quoted a 1.5 hour wait at 8pm for 3 on a Saturday but we were lucky that people in front of us hadn't returned so we were seated right away! (so don't be discouraged)---hellboy: everything was good about this except that spicy honey!

"If you want great pizza and the right atmosphere look no further than Paulie Gee's.

Would have been content but it was so good we ordered a third.The texture. The crust. The toppings. Hard pressed to mention anything I didn't like. I love pizza and this place is right up there with the best. That includes many pizzerias throughout Italy.Paulie stopped by for a chat and he has a fantastic personality. Great stories and it is obvious that he loves what he does and holds him team to very high standards.He was also kind enough to give me an official Paulie Gee's pin and a limoncello. A very nice touch!Make sure you check out the pizza oven in the back. It's a small,cozy place so don't pass this place up in you are in NY.",5.0
I take my pizza very seriously. The vegan pizza is so good here that if they didn't tell you it was vegan you would have no clue. I had the pie with vegan sausage and shared a few others with friends. It was all out of this world. I can't wait to go back again.,5.0
"There's a LOT of really great pizza in NYC, that's nothing new. But combine amazing pizza with friendly, caring service and a killer ambiance, and Paulie Gee's has a leg up on a lot of the other heavy hitters. The wait can be crazy, but we came in on a Tuesday night and it was half empty. I guess the key is to come when there's post-blizzard sludge everywhere and no one else wants to go out. Paulie Gee was there as I'm told he usually is, weaving around the space with his cup of coffee and stopping at literally every table. For us, he offered to curate our pizza order and who were we to argue? Read on for what Paulie Gee himself recommends:- The Greenpointer: according to Paulie, basically like eating a salad due to the piles of fresh baby arugula on top. - The Mo Cheeks: My personal favorite of the meal. The pickled onions on there are a nice surprise, and give a nice kick to the rest of the ingredients. - The Monte Cristo: OK, so this is probably something I would never think to order myself, but I'm glad it came out for us because it's actually super tasty. It comes with Canadian bacon and a drizzle of maple syrup, which I know sounds weird but trust me (or rather, trust Paulie). - I didn't catch the name of the last pizza, but it was one of the best and after peeking at the menu again I think it might have been the Hellboy. It was piled high with the tastiest Berkshire Sopressata, and it was perfect with the side of Mike's hot honey (which you haven't tried on pizza you must immediately). They asked if we wanted a dessert pizza but at that point we were stuffed to the gills. It was one of the best New York pizza experiences I've had so far, and the service is what really puts them above and beyond. I'm going to run for vice-president of the Paulie Gee fanclub soon!",5.0
"Came here a few days ago with my friend after work. Very dark inside, took some time for my eyeballs to adjust lol. We started off with some beers and then went with the Hellboy which was AMAZING. The hot honey makes a difference! Then we went with a vegan pie since neither one of us was particularly full. We ordered one with spinach, sea salt and garlic on it (sorry don't remember the name!) It was OK, not that memorable. The standout is by far Hellboy, the crust for both pizzas was SUPER THIN, firm and didn't fall apart on me. We both liked it. I took off a star for the spinach pie being nothing special and that it's a bit on the pricey side. Overall, I think I'll be back to try the other pizzas on the menu!",4.0
"Maybe we came on an off night, but we didn't care too much about the pizza and it was definitely not the best we've had. My friend wanted to celebrate her belated birthday at Paulie Gee's and so we did. We ordered 3 pies (Greenpointer, Ricotta Be Kidding Me, and The Hometown Brisket). I think the Hometown Brisket was our favorite only because of the BBQ sauce. Other than that, there wasn't much brisket pieces on the pizza. Ricotta Be Kidding Me was okay. The Greenpointer was all greens so that balanced our meal a little bit. I hear people waiting for hours to get a seat here and right now I'm just wondering where all the hype went? We came when they were opening, so thank goodness we didn't wait on line for this...cause it wouldn't have been worth it. FYI: There's no sign outside that says ""Paulie Gee's"". You just have to look by the address number ""60"" in order to find this place. I actually walked passed it while we were trying to find it. Also, use your flash on your phones to read the menu. I really liked the rustic interior but it was literally pitch black in there.",3.0
"Zagat rated the hellboy as the best pizza in NYC. Wow! Big call Zagat... We had to try! We would say it was delicious... But I would have to say Marta is equal of not just ahead. We got here at 6:40 and had to wait over an hr to sit at the bar. When getting here service was prompt and food was great! We ordered the hellboy and the hellified porkpie white and I have to say it was fresh, full of flavor and great value. My only critique would be more hot suppressa on the hellified and take numbers at the door! It's a little unreasonable to ask people to wait 90 mins and not offer to call when table it ready. Either way it was great but probably won't be crossing the river to wait another 90 mins.",4.0
"If there was ever a restaurant that inspires the need for #PiDay (3.14) to be everyday, it is Paulie Gee's. The pizza is a true art, and every bite is important, from the center to the crust crust.  PG is located in pizza heaven, or right near the water on Greenpoint Ave if you want a Google Map friendly address.Read it on my blog: highclasstohighlifes.com…As you'll see below I'm constantly on the proscuitt of happiness but this time we went for a different ham, Canadian bacon, and on the Monte Cristo. You bet it counted towards happiness. This pizza combines maple syrup drizzle and gouda with the ham. Yes, yes and more yes. Paulie asked if we had butter on the crust...sadly, no. SO MUCH REGRET....that I'll be back in no time to try it. You'll notice on the menu that they have a brisket pizza that features Hometown BBQ -- I love this local BK collaboration. You can get sauced the other way too with Greenpoint local brews!Anyway, I have nearly eaten my way through the entire menu (still need to do a bit of adventuring on the vegan side, every time I get close, I just want meat...) and I have been very pleased with every slice thus far. Therefore my advice to you is go with the pizza that's toppings are most appealing...or grab a handful of friends and share, then you can try multiple pizzas!The man, who is not a myth, but definitely a legend is often found inside checking in on tables, ensuring quality control and getting to know the patrons. He loved my last Instagram post that did a little play words...sharing that I was on the prosciutt of happiness with his King Henry Classic. He's always all smiles and usually wearing a great hat, he is Paulie Gee himself. Paulie Gee's - High Class to High Lifes If you really knead to get delivery or pickup, you'll have to look elsewhere for now though. The only way to leave Paulie Gee's with a to-go box is with leftovers. Rumor has it that a slice joint is opening up nearby though! I'm counting down the days, hours and minutes. Want to keep drooling? Read the menu!Pro Tip: Grab dinner at Paulie Gee's then walk straight out on the water in Greenpoint to Transmitter park or the outlook. Maybe even catch a sunset and BYO night cap!",5.0
"My old pal Carlos and I visited Paulie Gee's last night and had a great meal. I'm accustomed to going with the ol' vegan girlfriend and have a tradition where we split two pies from their extensive vegan selection, so we can try two different types of pies. The vegan and non-vegan selections are both extensive; each category has at least a half dozen kinds of pies, including oil bases, white slices, marinara, spinach-based, spicy honey and barbecue sauce foundations. The pies are aesthetically pleasing to every sense, well, every sense except sound. It's usually better when sound isn't a factor. At least when you're talking about food. When you're talking about music, sound is obviously a very important sense to talk about. I may go as far as to say that in a conversation about music, sound is the only sense that matters.I was excited to go with Carlos because I was going to get to eat their meat and actual cheese. The Paulie Gee's brisket is lean and delicious. Their pickled red onions possess a truly memorable tang and are worth spending a couple buck to add on to pretty much any pie. The ricotta dollops on the Ricky Ricotta feel more like bursts of a cream sauce than regular old cheese. Interestingly, the dairy and non-dairy ricotta cheeses are almost indecipherable in quality, which goes to show that Paulie Gee's knows what's up. Carlos and I were pleased to compliment the trad Italian flavors of the Ricky Ricotta with a tangy Barbecue Brisket pie. I'm psyched to go with a fellow omnivore again, because there are tons of other flavor combos I'm eager to try. New Yorkers, such as myself, are notorious for being dicks about the quality of pizza dough. It's the dough that invalidates the Chicago Deep Dish's false aspiration to pizza status. I can't stand Sicilian pizza either, which is a controversial take in Nueva York. Anyhow, no matter how well adorned a Paulie Gee's pie is, its base--the crust--is its most distinct and wonderful element. The crust is thin but springy, and always a little charred. It's pretty much naan bread, which is either a very luck coincidence or a visionary innovation. Naan bread, as you know, is lit, and, as it turns out, it is the perfect surface upon which various pizza ingredients should be placed and/or spread to mingle harmoniously.I've visited Paulie Gee's a number of times, and there's a bit of narrative that forms around my visits. The first time I tried to go, it was around noon, and my gf and I made the unpleasant discovery that Paulie Gee's does not open til 5 PM. The next time, we rolled up in a deep crew of six and had to wait about two to three hours for a table for six. If you find yourself in that position, you'll be okay though because there are plenty of bars around. There's also the water/skyline, mere yards away and a nice record store a block away.The gf and I have gone a few other times and it's always been great--except for the one time that a camera crew was shooting a special on Paulie Gee's vegan options. My girlfriend and I were in the shot all throughout our meal, and we were fighting (as subtly as possible) for the duration of our meal. I was taken aback and somewhat miffed when the producers of the show asked to do a talking head with us outside. The tension was palpable but they still insisted on interviewing us. I really do believe that you should foot the bill if you're going to interview someone for your television series or web series or gratuitously long Yelp review or whatever. At LEAST commission me to write a song for the soundtrack.In closing, I would like to offer a lil sum sum for the ladies. Are you interested in grandfatherly, charmingly blue collar, short men whose personalities closely resemble those of most Robert De Niro characters--but only in David O. Russel movies? If you do, and might want to be possibly hit on by a man of this caliber, you will love Paulie Gee's. At all times, Paulie Gee's eponymous Pizza Architect and Entrepreneur, Paulie Gee, stalks the narrow spaces between tables, checking in with customers--particularly of the reasonably attractive female demographic--and asks them how their food is, making small talk and thanking them for their patronage. I think this is cool. I would do the same if I were in his position, so don't take this the wrong way. Central to Paulie Gee's game is his ability to recommend a pizza place in seemingly every zip code on the planet and his inclination to tell you (the lady in question) the name of the dude who works there/owns the place, and to tell you (still the lady in question) to tell the dude (who owns the pizza place) to say that he (Paulie Gee) says hi. The Brotherhood of Pizza Mans is truly alive and well.",5.0

"I almost feel like it's blasphemy for not giving 5 stars. Finally made my way over here at Paulie Gees after way too long. Clearly this place is GPs staple so was excited to drop by on Wednesday night.There was no wait- very good. I had been worried about this so called 3x around 6:45pm to see how long it was before heading over. No one picked up and their answering service basically hangs up on you. I ordered the Daniela and he ordered the brisket pizza. Mine came out a good 7 minutes before his. I noticed immediately that about 40% of the crust was charred to the point of being inedible. To top that off, the spinach topping my pizza was the same. It was literally a black piece of ash and when I picked a leaf up or crumbled in my hands. The cheese blend was very good (mozzarella and Parmesan) but the pizza was just not good. To top it off, parts of the center were soggy and didn't hold the toppings when I grabbed a slice. When the brisket pizza came out a few minutes later I noticed immediately that it was cooked perfectly. The crust was edible and delicious. I was bummed that mine didn't come out this way especially since it seemed like a classic. All I can say is they probably put our orders in together and maybe his needed a little longer in the oven. Mine was most likely getting over cooked while his needed a few more minutes. Hence the gap in time between both of our orders coming out and the reason why mine was half done by the time his came out.I was really disappointed but the good thing to know is at least the brisket pizza was cooked well. I know there is a good meal at Paulie Gees but I feel like we were jipped.Also, great touch that Paulie himself came in to greet all the diners. He was super friendly and it brings a family quality to the place. This is maybe one of the main reasons I'd come back.",3.0
"Delicious!! Definitely made my top 3 favorite pizza  places (the others being robertas and best pizza). We've been meaning to come forever but the line is always so long. We were finally seated right away on a Friday night because we ran over as soon as they opened at 6pm. I would highly recommend this tactic to those of you who have been meaning to come and haven't been able to due to the wait -- the food will be worth it. We ordered the hellboy, ricotta be kidding me and the hot honey ice cream Sunday for dessert. The hellboy was our fave. It was basically a pepperoni pizza with hot honey lined under the cheese. I liked it more than the bees sting from Robertas but both are very good. All in all would highly recommend. As an extra plus Paulie Gee was hanging around today,though it seems like he does this quite often, going from table to table talking to the customers.",5.0
"My husband and I visited Paulie Gee's about two years ago and he still dreams of the Hellboy. This time we ordered the Hellboy and Cherry Jones.  The Hellboy was great but just a touch too sweet for me.  The hot honey adds a little kick but is definitely not too hot.  My husband will tell you it is the best pizza he has ever had (saying a lot since he was raised in the Bronx).  The Cherry Jones on the other hand was way too sweet for both of us.  I couldn't taste anything other then honey.  My husband embarrassed me by telling the waitress we didn't like it.  She offered us a replacement.  We ordered the Ricky Ricotta.  It was alright.  I was shocked because the ricotta was not warm.  The crust at Paulie Gee's is the perfect texture.  However, two of our three pizzas were too charred for my taste.  I must mention Paulie walks around all the tables to make sure everyone is enjoying.  Love it!  The restaurant is too dark and loud for my taste.",3.0
"Interesting decor, super dark inside and it was hard to read the menu. We were seated under one of the speakers, so I felt like an old person complaining about how loud the music was, but really, we came for the food. Split a salad and a Greenpointer pie, and neither disappointed. Both were served quickly, and the pie just exploded with flavor. The lemon kick was strong but not overwhelming, and the crust was perfection. Service was attentive, friendly, and efficient. Lots of menu choices for anything your palate is craving. Overall, a very good experience, and one I would look forward to enjoying again.",4.0
"New York probably takes its pizza more seriously than anywhere else in the world.  I'm sure there are 7 or 8 people reading this right now that would be willing to shiv a guy for saying something bad about their favorite slice.  With that in mind, Paulie Gee's is a pizza lover's pizza place.  They make Neapolitan style pizzas with an oven shipped in from Naples and lovingly reassembled by small, Italian elves.  From this oven, comes perfectly leopard-spotted pizzas with just the right amount of bouncy chewy dough.To top the pizza, there's a lovingly curated selection to choose from so don't you dare ask for substitutions.  Lucky for you whether you're a vegan, vegetarian, white/red pie lover, averse to spice, meat lover, or whatever!  There's at least one pie on the menu* that will make you say, ""hmmm..."".  My personal favorites are the Mo' Cheeks ($16, has guanciale and is perfect with the pickled onions) and Ricotta Be Kidding Me ($17, with tons of meat topped with adorable dollops of cottage cheese).  I've only ever had 1 pizza there that wasn't stellar and I won't tell you which one because you'll definitely judge me for choosing it in the first place.The atmosphere at Paulie Gee's is great.  It's quintessential Brooklyn.  Think dark unfinished wood walls with an eclectic collection of tables made from reclaimed wood, music consisting of a mixture of jazz, rock, and anything but top 40s.  What always makes my night is that the ACTUAL Paulie Gee walks around and talks to EVERYONE.  It doesn't matter if Keri Russell** is sitting right next to you, he will still come by and have a 5-20 minute conversation with you and your table.  My only complaint is how popular this place is.  They've stopped making pizzas to go and still, the wait is crazy.  I've never been able to get a table in less than 45 minutes unless it was late at night.  I guess that's not a bad problem to have.  I also kind of wish they would get a full liquor license and take that creative pizza combo creating mind into the cocktail realm.  I mean...Mike's Hot Honey + Whiskey?  Maybe?---------* If you can't find a pizza you like on the printed menu in the restaurant, whip out the smartphone and check out the ""secret"" menu on the website.** This actually happened.",4.0
"We've literally flown across the country to enjoy his pizza. It's that good! Walking in, the aroma of pizza cooking in a brick oven hits your nose.This is about time my stomach starts to growl. The vibe is flowing with positive energy, and the low lighting is flattering & sexy. The bar to the left is where you can order a beverage while you wait.  They have a decent beer selection. Wait times vary, but it's usually not as long as anticipated, and well worth the effort.Everyone, including the servers, seem happy to be there.Paulie Gee is the utmost host. He's always found time to come to our table with suggestions, stories, and the occasional limoncello, (his recipe of the celebratory cocktail).Talking with him, I've gathered that he makes the vegan pizza for the people, or demand for it, but he didn't seem interested in the cause.

"Absolutely delicious. Huge selection of pies - good for meatatarians, vegetarians, and even vegans. Wood fire oven delivers the signature light smoke and char. Dough is absolutely tender and springy. They even let the pizza rest afterwards so the cheese sets and you don't burn the crap out of your mouth.Hellboy- spicy pepperoni with hot honey. Absolute classic pizza. Hot honey perfectly blankets the spicy meat. Super simple, absolutely delicious. Get two, trust meRicotta/sausage pie - similar to one above, hot honey included. However ricotta and sausage are a welcome addition.

Someone sitting next to us saw our struggle and took us to try the  IN Ricotta Da Vegan so we did. AMAZING!!

"My old pal Carlos and I visited Paulie Gee's last night and had a great meal. I'm accustomed to going with the ol' vegan girlfriend and have a tradition where we split two pies from their extensive vegan selection, so we can try two different types of pies. The vegan and non-vegan selections are both extensive; each category has at least a half dozen kinds of pies, including oil bases, white slices, marinara, spinach-based, spicy honey and barbecue sauce foundations. The pies are aesthetically pleasing to every sense, well, every sense except sound. It's usually better when sound isn't a factor. At least when you're talking about food. When you're talking about music, sound is obviously a very important sense to talk about. I may go as far as to say that in a conversation about music, sound is the only sense that matters.I was excited to go with Carlos because I was going to get to eat their meat and actual cheese. The Paulie Gee's brisket is lean and delicious. Their pickled red onions possess a truly memorable tang and are worth spending a couple buck to add on to pretty much any pie. The ricotta dollops on the Ricky Ricotta feel more like bursts of a cream sauce than regular old cheese. Interestingly, the dairy and non-dairy ricotta cheeses are almost indecipherable in quality, which goes to show that Paulie Gee's knows what's up. Carlos and I were pleased to compliment the trad Italian flavors of the Ricky Ricotta with a tangy Barbecue Brisket pie. I'm psyched to go with a fellow omnivore again, because there are tons of other flavor combos I'm eager to try. New Yorkers, such as myself, are notorious for being dicks about the quality of pizza dough. It's the dough that invalidates the Chicago Deep Dish's false aspiration to pizza status. I can't stand Sicilian pizza either, which is a controversial take in Nueva York. Anyhow, no matter how well adorned a Paulie Gee's pie is, its base--the crust--is its most distinct and wonderful element. The crust is thin but springy, and always a little charred. It's pretty much naan bread, which is either a very luck coincidence or a visionary innovation. Naan bread, as you know, is lit, and, as it turns out, it is the perfect surface upon which various pizza ingredients should be placed and/or spread to mingle harmoniously.I've visited Paulie Gee's a number of times, and there's a bit of narrative that forms around my visits. The first time I tried to go, it was around noon, and my gf and I made the unpleasant discovery that Paulie Gee's does not open til 5 PM. The next time, we rolled up in a deep crew of six and had to wait about two to three hours for a table for six. If you find yourself in that position, you'll be okay though because there are plenty of bars around. There's also the water/skyline, mere yards away and a nice record store a block away.The gf and I have gone a few other times and it's always been great--except for the one time that a camera crew was shooting a special on Paulie Gee's vegan options. My girlfriend and I were in the shot all throughout our meal, and we were fighting (as subtly as possible) for the duration of our meal. I was taken aback and somewhat miffed when the producers of the show asked to do a talking head with us outside. The tension was palpable but they still insisted on interviewing us. I really do believe that you should foot the bill if you're going to interview someone for your television series or web series or gratuitously long Yelp review or whatever.

"I almost feel like it's blasphemy for not giving 5 stars. Finally made my way over here at Paulie Gees after way too long. Clearly this place is GPs staple so was excited to drop by on Wednesday night.There was no wait- very good. I had been worried about this so called 3x around 6:45pm to see how long it was before heading over. No one picked up and their answering service basically hangs up on you. I ordered the Daniela and he ordered the brisket pizza. Mine came out a good 7 minutes before his. I noticed immediately that about 40% of the crust was charred to the point of being inedible. To top that off, the spinach topping my pizza was the same. It was literally a black piece of ash and when I picked a leaf up or crumbled in my hands. The cheese blend was very good (mozzarella and Parmesan) but the pizza was just not good. To top it off, parts of the center were soggy and didn't hold the toppings when I grabbed a slice. When the brisket pizza came out a few minutes later I noticed immediately that it was cooked perfectly. The crust was edible and delicious. I was bummed that mine didn't come out this way especially since it seemed like a classic. All I can say is they probably put our orders in together and maybe his needed a little longer in the oven. Mine was most likely getting over cooked while his needed a few more minutes. Hence the gap in time between both of our orders coming out and the reason why mine was half done by the time his came out.I was really disappointed but the good thing to know is at least the brisket pizza was cooked well. I know there is a good meal at Paulie Gees but I feel like we were jipped.Also, great touch that Paulie himself came in to greet all the diners. He was super friendly and it brings a family quality to the place. This is maybe one of the main reasons I'd come back.",3.0
"Delicious!! Definitely made my top 3 favorite pizza  places (the others being robertas and best pizza). We've been meaning to come forever but the line is always so long. We were finally seated right away on a Friday night because we ran over as soon as they opened at 6pm. I would highly recommend this tactic to those of you who have been meaning to come and haven't been able to due to the wait -- the food will be worth it. We ordered the hellboy, ricotta be kidding me and the hot honey ice cream Sunday for dessert. The hellboy was our fave. It was basically a pepperoni pizza with hot honey lined under the cheese. I liked it more than the bees sting from Robertas but both are very good. All in all would highly recommend. As an extra plus Paulie Gee was hanging around today,though it seems like he does this quite often, going from table to table talking to the customers.",5.0
"My husband and I visited Paulie Gee's about two years ago and he still dreams of the Hellboy. This time we ordered the Hellboy and Cherry Jones.  The Hellboy was great but just a touch too sweet for me.  The hot honey adds a little kick but is definitely not too hot.  My husband will tell you it is the best pizza he has ever had (saying a lot since he was raised in the Bronx).  The Cherry Jones on the other hand was way too sweet for both of us.  I couldn't taste anything other then honey.  My husband embarrassed me by telling the waitress we didn't like it.  She offered us a replacement.  We ordered the Ricky Ricotta.  It was alright.  I was shocked because the ricotta was not warm.  The crust at Paulie Gee's is the perfect texture.  However, two of our three pizzas were too charred for my taste.  I must mention Paulie walks around all the tables to make sure everyone is enjoying.  Love it!  The restaurant is too dark and loud for my taste.",3.0
"Interesting decor, super dark inside and it was hard to read the menu. We were seated under one of the speakers, so I felt like an old person complaining about how loud the music was, but really, we came for the food. Split a salad and a Greenpointer pie, and neither disappointed. Both were served quickly, and the pie just exploded with flavor. The lemon kick was strong but not overwhelming, and the crust was perfection. Service was attentive, friendly, and efficient. Lots of menu choices for anything your palate is craving. Overall, a very good experience, and one I would look forward to enjoying again.",4.0
"New York probably takes its pizza more seriously than anywhere else in the world.  I'm sure there are 7 or 8 people reading this right now that would be willing to shiv a guy for saying something bad about their favorite slice.  With that in mind, Paulie Gee's is a pizza lover's pizza place.  They make Neapolitan style pizzas with an oven shipped in from Naples and lovingly reassembled by small, Italian elves.  From this oven, comes perfectly leopard-spotted pizzas with just the right amount of bouncy chewy dough.To top the pizza, there's a lovingly curated selection to choose from so don't you dare ask for substitutions.  Lucky for you whether you're a vegan, vegetarian, white/red pie lover, averse to spice, meat lover, or whatever!  There's at least one pie on the menu* that will make you say, ""hmmm..."".  My personal favorites are the Mo' Cheeks ($16, has guanciale and is perfect with the pickled onions) and Ricotta Be Kidding Me ($17, with tons of meat topped with adorable dollops of cottage cheese).  I've only ever had 1 pizza there that wasn't stellar and I won't tell you which one because you'll definitely judge me for choosing it in the first place.The atmosphere at Paulie Gee's is great.  It's quintessential Brooklyn.  Think dark unfinished wood walls with an eclectic collection of tables made from reclaimed wood, music consisting of a mixture of jazz, rock, and anything but top 40s.  What always makes my night is that the ACTUAL Paulie Gee walks around and talks to EVERYONE.  It doesn't matter if Keri Russell** is sitting right next to you, he will still come by and have a 5-20 minute conversation with you and your table.  My only complaint is how popular this place is.  They've stopped making pizzas to go and still, the wait is crazy.  I've never been able to get a table in less than 45 minutes unless it was late at night.  I guess that's not a bad problem to have.  I also kind of wish they would get a full liquor license and take that creative pizza combo creating mind into the cocktail realm.  I mean...Mike's Hot Honey + Whiskey?  Maybe?---------* If you can't find a pizza you like on the printed menu in the restaurant, whip out the smartphone and check out the ""secret"" menu on the website.** This actually happened.",4.0
"We've literally flown across the country to enjoy his pizza. It's that good! Walking in, the aroma of pizza cooking in a brick oven hits your nose.This is about time my stomach starts to growl. The vibe is flowing with positive energy, and the low lighting is flattering & sexy. The bar to the left is where you can order a beverage while you wait.  They have a decent beer selection. Wait times vary, but it's usually not as long as anticipated, and well worth the effort.Everyone, including the servers, seem happy to be there.Paulie Gee is the utmost host. He's always found time to come to our table with suggestions, stories, and the occasional limoncello, (his recipe of the celebratory cocktail).Talking with him, I've gathered that he makes the vegan pizza for the people, or demand for it, but he didn't seem interested in the cause. The funky bathrooms can be a challenge to use when you've had one too many! VEGAN Pies we LOVE Simply RedVegan Tomato Sauce with Tomatoes, Olive Oil.

"Absolutely delicious. Huge selection of pies - good for meatatarians, vegetarians, and even vegans. Wood fire oven delivers the signature light smoke and char. Dough is absolutely tender and springy. They even let the pizza rest afterwards so the cheese sets and you don't burn the crap out of your mouth.Hellboy- spicy pepperoni with hot honey. Absolute classic pizza. Hot honey perfectly blankets the spicy meat. Super simple, absolutely delicious. Get two, trust meRicotta/sausage pie - similar to one above, hot honey included. However ricotta and sausage are a welcome addition. While chunks of roasted garlic are an excellent accentSo many other pies, go try them for yourself.Big lines, put your name down and go drink at browerij lane.

"One of the challenges of  being vegan is getting your friends/family to be open to the idea of trying vegan food.I have never had Vegan Pizza before and I usually try to try a restaurant first before recommending to anyone especially a non vegan but I took a chance.When we first arrived we were having trouble picking something since everything was foreign to us. Someone sitting next to us saw our struggle and took us to try the  IN Ricotta Da Vegan so we did. AMAZING!! My non vegan date was impressed and I was so happy.Thanks Paulie Gee for making me looking good Whew! One pie (6 small slices) goes for 16 bucks . Its small, nice ambiance I would say its a little darkI would go again!Menu like here ------ pauliegee.com/greenpoint… xoxoC.",4.0
"Some of the best za in the city, bar none. The lady and I traveled far and wide for it since we'd heard such great things. It was a Friday night so the restaurant was predictably packed. There's not much in the form of a waiting area, which particularly sucked given how freezing the weather was, but we had a feeling the pie would be well worth the wait (plus we also got to watch a tipsy couple aggressively suck face up close and personal which was an unexpected but enjoyable twist).The vibe was cool, featuring low--lighting, a huge and beautiful custom brick oven, and trendy attractive people who's favorite bands you've never heard of.When we finally were seated I was stoked to see the menu offered a huge variety of pies with all sorts of niche toppings AND vegan options(I personally don't give two damns about veganism but they presented them in an unpretentious way so I was cool with it). We eventually decided to go with the Hell Boy and the Prokypineapple, both of which were amazing, and I'm looking forward to going back and further chowing my way down the menu.Go here.",5.0
"After a 2-hours wait on a weekend for a party of 2, we finally got a table at the renowned pizza shop in Brooklyn. After having one of the best pizzas of all time at Little Isabella located in Baltimore, I was on the mission to find its companion in NYC. Overhyped as we suspected, Paulie Gee had nothing on Little Isabella! Perhaps, it was the quirky blend of sweet and savory flavors, but with that 2-hour wait, we surely did not have a pleasing experience.We ordered two pies: HellBoy and Greenpointer. HellBoy: Fresh Mozzarella, Italian Tomatoes, Berkshire Sopressata Piccante, Parmigiano Reggiano and Mike's HOT HoneyGreenpointer:Fresh Mozzarella, Baby Arugula, Olive Oil, Fresh Lemon Juice and Shaved Parmigiano ReggianoWe didn't really enjoy the sweetness of the honey in the HellBoy or the sourness of the lemon juice in the Greenpointer. Fresh, as we saw them make each pie to order, I definitely thought the doughiness of the pizza wasn't anything spectacular. In terms of service, I think it was pretty solid. Our waiter was patient and helpful. As a surprise, Paulie Gee himself introduced himself to just about every table, making it feel quite personable. In all, I definitely wouldn't return back to this pizzeria, especially with that crazy wait. During that 2-hour wait and 1.5-hour dining time, I can drive down to Baltimore and get some Little Isabella for half the price and no wait!",3.0
"3.5 stars for this pizza joint hidden behind a HUGE wooden door all the way down Franklin streetCrust was good with a nice char on the hellboy but the crust of the greenpoint pizza seemed a bit underdone We were quoted a 1.5 hour wait at 8pm for 3 on a Saturday but we were lucky that people in front of us hadn't returned so we were seated right away! (so don't be discouraged)---hellboy: everything was good about this except that spicy honey! Should of gone with a more classic margherita style pizza instead---greenpoint: fresh arugula, with a bit too much lemon juice, so nothing special NOTE: they don't have pepper flakes, only chili oil",4.0
"If you want great pizza and the right atmosphere look no further than Paulie Gee's. We sat at the bar (luckily) and avoided a two hour wait.  The pizza choices are numerous, with some very creative options. There were three of us and we started with two pies. Would have been content but it was so good we ordered a third.The texture. The crust. The toppings. Hard pressed to mention anything I didn't like. I love pizza and this place is right up there with the best. That includes many pizzerias throughout Italy.Paulie stopped by for a chat and he has a fantastic personality. Great stories and it is obvious that he loves what he does and holds him team to very high standards.He was also kind enough to give me an official Paulie Gee's pin and a limoncello. A very nice touch!Make sure you check out the pizza oven in the back. It's a small,cozy place so don't pass this place up in you are in NY.",5.0
I take my pizza very seriously. The vegan pizza is so good here that if they didn't tell you it was vegan you would have no clue. I had the pie with vegan sausage and shared a few others with friends. It was all out of this world. I can't wait to go back again.,5.0
"There's a LOT of really great pizza in NYC, that's nothing new. But combine amazing pizza with friendly, caring service and a killer ambiance, and Paulie Gee's has a leg up on a lot of the other heavy hitters. The wait can be crazy, but we came in on a Tuesday night and it was half empty. I guess the key is to come when there's post-blizzard sludge everywhere and no one else wants to go out. Paulie Gee was there as I'm told he usually is, weaving around the space with his cup of coffee and stopping at literally every table. For us, he offered to curate our pizza order and who were we to argue? Read on for what Paulie Gee himself recommends:- The Greenpointer: according to Paulie, basically like eating a salad due to the piles of fresh baby arugula on top. - The Mo Cheeks: My personal favorite of the meal. The pickled onions on there are a nice surprise, and give a nice kick to the rest of the ingredients. - The Monte Cristo: OK, so this is probably something I would never think to order myself, but I'm glad it came out for us because it's actually super tasty. It comes with Canadian bacon and a drizzle of maple syrup, which I know sounds weird but trust me (or rather, trust Paulie). - I didn't catch the name of the last pizza, but it was one of the best and after peeking at the menu again I think it might have been the Hellboy. It was piled high with the tastiest Berkshire Sopressata, and it was perfect with the side of Mike's hot honey (which you haven't tried on pizza you must immediately). They asked if we wanted a dessert pizza but at that point we were stuffed to the gills. It was one of the best New York pizza experiences I've had so far, and the service is what really puts them above and beyond. I'm going to run for vice-president of the Paulie Gee fanclub soon!",5.0
"Came here a few days ago with my friend after work. Very dark inside, took some time for my eyeballs to adjust lol. We started off with some beers and then went with the Hellboy which was AMAZING. The hot honey makes a difference! Then we went with a vegan pie since neither one of us was particularly full. We ordered one with spinach, sea salt and garlic on it (sorry don't remember the name!) It was OK, not that memorable. The standout is by far Hellboy, the crust for both pizzas was SUPER THIN, firm and didn't fall apart on me. We both liked it. I took off a star for the spinach pie being nothing special and that it's a bit on the pricey side. Overall, I think I'll be back to try the other pizzas on the menu!",4.0
"Maybe we came on an off night, but we didn't care too much about the pizza and it was definitely not the best we've had. My friend wanted to celebrate her belated birthday at Paulie Gee's and so we did. We ordered 3 pies (Greenpointer, Ricotta Be Kidding Me, and The Hometown Brisket). I think the Hometown Brisket was our favorite only because of the BBQ sauce. Other than that, there wasn't much brisket pieces on the pizza. Ricotta Be Kidding Me was okay. The Greenpointer was all greens so that balanced our meal a little bit. I hear people waiting for hours to get a seat here and right now I'm just wondering where all the hype went? We came when they were opening, so thank goodness we didn't wait on line for this...cause it wouldn't have been worth it. FYI: There's no sign outside that says ""Paulie Gee's"".

"I almost feel like it's blasphemy for not giving 5 stars. Finally made my way over here at Paulie Gees after way too long. Clearly this place is GPs staple so was excited to drop by on Wednesday night.There was no wait- very good. I had been worried about this so called 3x around 6:45pm to see how long it was before heading over. No one picked up and their answering service basically hangs up on you. I ordered the Daniela and he ordered the brisket pizza. Mine came out a good 7 minutes before his. I noticed immediately that about 40% of the crust was charred to the point of being inedible. To top that off, the spinach topping my pizza was the same. It was literally a black piece of ash and when I picked a leaf up or crumbled in my hands. The cheese blend was very good (mozzarella and Parmesan) but the pizza was just not good. To top it off, parts of the center were soggy and didn't hold the toppings when I grabbed a slice. When the brisket pizza came out a few minutes later I noticed immediately that it was cooked perfectly. The crust was edible and delicious. I was bummed that mine didn't come out this way especially since it seemed like a classic. All I can say is they probably put our orders in together and maybe his needed a little longer in the oven. Mine was most likely getting over cooked while his needed a few more minutes. Hence the gap in time between both of our orders coming out and the reason why mine was half done by the time his came out.I was really disappointed but the good thing to know is at least the brisket pizza was cooked well. I know there is a good meal at Paulie Gees but I feel like we were jipped.Also, great touch that Paulie himself came in to greet all the diners. He was super friendly and it brings a family quality to the place. This is maybe one of the main reasons I'd come back.",3.0
"Delicious!! Definitely made my top 3 favorite pizza  places (the others being robertas and best pizza). We've been meaning to come forever but the line is always so long.

I would highly recommend this tactic to those of you who have been meaning to come and haven't been able to due to the wait -- the food will be worth it. We ordered the hellboy, ricotta be kidding me and the hot honey ice cream Sunday for dessert. The hellboy was our fave. It was basically a pepperoni pizza with hot honey lined under the cheese.

"My husband and I visited Paulie Gee's about two years ago and he still dreams of the Hellboy. This time we ordered the Hellboy and Cherry Jones.  The Hellboy was great but just a touch too sweet for me.  The hot honey adds a little kick but is definitely not too hot.  My husband will tell you it is the best pizza he has ever had (saying a lot since he was raised in the Bronx).  The Cherry Jones on the other hand was way too sweet for both of us.  I couldn't taste anything other then honey.  My husband embarrassed me by telling the waitress we didn't like it.  She offered us a replacement.  We ordered the Ricky Ricotta.  It was alright.  I was shocked because the ricotta was not warm.  The crust at Paulie Gee's is the perfect texture.  However, two of our three pizzas were too charred for my taste.  I must mention Paulie walks around all the tables to make sure everyone is enjoying.  Love it!  The restaurant is too dark and loud for my taste.",3.0

"Absolutely delicious. Huge selection of pies - good for meatatarians, vegetarians, and even vegans. Wood fire oven delivers the signature light smoke and char. Dough is absolutely tender and springy. They even let the pizza rest afterwards so the cheese sets and you don't burn the crap out of your mouth.Hellboy- spicy pepperoni with hot honey. Absolute classic pizza. Hot honey perfectly blankets the spicy meat. Super simple, absolutely delicious. Get two, trust meRicotta/sausage pie - similar to one above, hot honey included. However ricotta and sausage are a welcome addition.

"One of the challenges of  being vegan is getting your friends/family to be open to the idea of trying vegan food.I have never had Vegan Pizza before and I usually try to try a restaurant first before recommending to anyone especially a non vegan but I took a chance.When we first arrived we were having trouble picking something since everything was foreign to us. Someone sitting next to us saw our struggle and took us to try the  IN Ricotta Da Vegan so we did. AMAZING!! My non vegan date was impressed and I was so happy.Thanks Paulie Gee for making me looking good Whew! One pie (6 small slices) goes for 16 bucks . Its small, nice ambiance I would say its a little darkI would go again!Menu like here ------ pauliegee.com/greenpoint… xoxoC.",4.0
"Some of the best za in the city, bar none. The lady and I traveled far and wide for it since we'd heard such great things. It was a Friday night so the restaurant was predictably packed. There's not much in the form of a waiting area, which particularly sucked given how freezing the weather was, but we had a feeling the pie would be well worth the wait (plus we also got to watch a tipsy couple aggressively suck face up close and personal which was an unexpected but enjoyable twist).The vibe was cool, featuring low--lighting, a huge and beautiful custom brick oven, and trendy attractive people who's favorite bands you've never heard of.When we finally were seated I was stoked to see the menu offered a huge variety of pies with all sorts of niche toppings AND vegan options(I personally don't give two damns about veganism but they presented them in an unpretentious way so I was cool with it). We eventually decided to go with the Hell Boy and the Prokypineapple, both of which were amazing, and I'm looking forward to going back and further chowing my way down the menu.Go here.",5.0
"After a 2-hours wait on a weekend for a party of 2, we finally got a table at the renowned pizza shop in Brooklyn. After having one of the best pizzas of all time at Little Isabella located in Baltimore, I was on the mission to find its companion in NYC. Overhyped as we suspected, Paulie Gee had nothing on Little Isabella! Perhaps, it was the quirky blend of sweet and savory flavors, but with that 2-hour wait, we surely did not have a pleasing experience.We ordered two pies: HellBoy and Greenpointer. HellBoy: Fresh Mozzarella, Italian Tomatoes, Berkshire Sopressata Piccante, Parmigiano Reggiano and Mike's HOT HoneyGreenpointer:Fresh Mozzarella, Baby Arugula, Olive Oil, Fresh Lemon Juice and Shaved Parmigiano ReggianoWe didn't really enjoy the sweetness of the honey in the HellBoy or the sourness of the lemon juice in the Greenpointer. Fresh, as we saw them make each pie to order, I definitely thought the doughiness of the pizza wasn't anything spectacular. In terms of service, I think it was pretty solid. Our waiter was patient and helpful. As a surprise, Paulie Gee himself introduced himself to just about every table, making it feel quite personable. In all, I definitely wouldn't return back to this pizzeria, especially with that crazy wait. During that 2-hour wait and 1.5-hour dining time, I can drive down to Baltimore and get some Little Isabella for half the price and no wait!",3.0
"3.5 stars for this pizza joint hidden behind a HUGE wooden door all the way down Franklin streetCrust was good with a nice char on the hellboy but the crust of the greenpoint pizza seemed a bit underdone We were quoted a 1.5 hour wait at 8pm for 3 on a Saturday but we were lucky that people in front of us hadn't returned so we were seated right away! (so don't be discouraged)---hellboy: everything was good about this except that spicy honey! Should of gone with a more classic margherita style pizza instead---greenpoint: fresh arugula, with a bit too much lemon juice, so nothing special NOTE: they don't have pepper flakes, only chili oil",4.0
"If you want great pizza and the right atmosphere look no further than Paulie Gee's. We sat at the bar (luckily) and avoided a two hour wait.  The pizza choices are numerous, with some very creative options. There were three of us and we started with two pies. Would have been content but it was so good we ordered a third.The texture. The crust. The toppings. Hard pressed to mention anything I didn't like. I love pizza and this place is right up there with the best. That includes many pizzerias throughout Italy.Paulie stopped by for a chat and he has a fantastic personality. Great stories and it is obvious that he loves what he does and holds him team to very high standards.He was also kind enough to give me an official Paulie Gee's pin and a limoncello. A very nice touch!Make sure you check out the pizza oven in the back. It's a small,cozy place so don't pass this place up in you are in NY.",5.0
I take my pizza very seriously. The vegan pizza is so good here that if they didn't tell you it was vegan you would have no clue. I had the pie with vegan sausage and shared a few others with friends. It was all out of this world. I can't wait to go back again.,5.0
"There's a LOT of really great pizza in NYC, that's nothing new. But combine amazing pizza with friendly, caring service and a killer ambiance, and Paulie Gee's has a leg up on a lot of the other heavy hitters. The wait can be crazy, but we came in on a Tuesday night and it was half empty. I guess the key is to come when there's post-blizzard sludge everywhere and no one else wants to go out. Paulie Gee was there as I'm told he usually is, weaving around the space with his cup of coffee and stopping at literally every table. For us, he offered to curate our pizza order and who were we to argue? Read on for what Paulie Gee himself recommends:- The Greenpointer: according to Paulie, basically like eating a salad due to the piles of fresh baby arugula on top. - The Mo Cheeks: My personal favorite of the meal. The pickled onions on there are a nice surprise, and give a nice kick to the rest of the ingredients. - The Monte Cristo: OK, so this is probably something I would never think to order myself, but I'm glad it came out for us because it's actually super tasty. It comes with Canadian bacon and a drizzle of maple syrup, which I know sounds weird but trust me (or rather, trust Paulie). - I didn't catch the name of the last pizza, but it was one of the best and after peeking at the menu again I think it might have been the Hellboy. It was piled high with the tastiest Berkshire Sopressata, and it was perfect with the side of Mike's hot honey (which you haven't tried on pizza you must immediately). They asked if we wanted a dessert pizza but at that point we were stuffed to the gills. It was one of the best New York pizza experiences I've had so far, and the service is what really puts them above and beyond. I'm going to run for vice-president of the Paulie Gee fanclub soon!",5.0
"Came here a few days ago with my friend after work. Very dark inside, took some time for my eyeballs to adjust lol. We started off with some beers and then went with the Hellboy which was AMAZING. The hot honey makes a difference! Then we went with a vegan pie since neither one of us was particularly full. We ordered one with spinach, sea salt and garlic on it (sorry don't remember the name!) It was OK, not that memorable. The standout is by far Hellboy, the crust for both pizzas was SUPER THIN, firm and didn't fall apart on me. We both liked it. I took off a star for the spinach pie being nothing special and that it's a bit on the pricey side. Overall, I think I'll be back to try the other pizzas on the menu!",4.0
"Maybe we came on an off night, but we didn't care too much about the pizza and it was definitely not the best we've had. My friend wanted to celebrate her belated birthday at Paulie Gee's and so we did. We ordered 3 pies (Greenpointer, Ricotta Be Kidding Me, and The Hometown Brisket). I think the Hometown Brisket was our favorite only because of the BBQ sauce. Other than that, there wasn't much brisket pieces on the pizza. Ricotta Be Kidding Me was okay. The Greenpointer was all greens so that balanced our meal a little bit. I hear people waiting for hours to get a seat here and right now I'm just wondering where all the hype went? We came when they were opening, so thank goodness we didn't wait on line for this...cause it wouldn't have been worth it. FYI: There's no sign outside that says ""Paulie Gee's"". You just have to look by the address number ""60"" in order to find this place. I actually walked passed it while we were trying to find it. Also, use your flash on your phones to read the menu. I really liked the rustic interior but it was literally pitch black in there.",3.0
"Zagat rated the hellboy as the best pizza in NYC. Wow! Big call Zagat... We had to try! We would say it was delicious... But I would have to say Marta is equal of not just ahead. We got here at 6:40 and had to wait over an hr to sit at the bar. When getting here service was prompt and food was great! We ordered the hellboy and the hellified porkpie white and I have to say it was fresh, full of flavor and great value. My only critique would be more hot suppressa on the hellified and take numbers at the door! It's a little unreasonable to ask people to wait 90 mins and not offer to call when table it ready. Either way it was great but probably won't be crossing the river to wait another 90 mins.",4.0
"If there was ever a restaurant that inspires the need for #PiDay (3.14) to be everyday, it is Paulie Gee's. The pizza is a true art, and every bite is important, from the center to the crust crust.  PG is located in pizza heaven, or right near the water on Greenpoint Ave if you want a Google Map friendly address.Read it on my blog: highclasstohighlifes.com…As you'll see below I'm constantly on the proscuitt of happiness but this time we went for a different ham, Canadian bacon, and on the Monte Cristo. You bet it counted towards happiness. This pizza combines maple syrup drizzle and gouda with the ham. Yes, yes and more yes. Paulie asked if we had butter on the crust...sadly, no. SO MUCH REGRET....that I'll be back in no time to try it. You'll notice on the menu that they have a brisket pizza that features Hometown BBQ -- I love this local BK collaboration. You can get sauced the other way too with Greenpoint local brews!Anyway, I have nearly eaten my way through the entire menu (still need to do a bit of adventuring on the vegan side, every time I get close, I just want meat...) and I have been very pleased with every slice thus far. Therefore my advice to you is go with the pizza that's toppings are most appealing...or grab a handful of friends and share, then you can try multiple pizzas!The man, who is not a myth, but definitely a legend is often found inside checking in on tables, ensuring quality control and getting to know the patrons. He loved my last Instagram post that did a little play words...sharing that I was on the prosciutt of happiness with his King Henry Classic. He's always all smiles and usually wearing a great hat, he is Paulie Gee himself. Paulie Gee's - High Class to High Lifes If you really knead to get delivery or pickup, you'll have to look elsewhere for now though. The only way to leave Paulie Gee's with a to-go box is with leftovers. Rumor has it that a slice joint is opening up nearby though! I'm counting down the days, hours and minutes. Want to keep drooling? Read the menu!Pro Tip: Grab dinner at Paulie Gee's then walk straight out on the water in Greenpoint to Transmitter park or the outlook. Maybe even catch a sunset and BYO night cap!",5.0
"My old pal Carlos and I visited Paulie Gee's last night and had a great meal. I'm accustomed to going with the ol' vegan girlfriend and have a tradition where we split two pies from their extensive vegan selection, so we can try two different types of pies. The vegan and non-vegan selections are both extensive; each category has at least a half dozen kinds of pies, including oil bases, white slices, marinara, spinach-based, spicy honey and barbecue sauce foundations. The pies are aesthetically pleasing to every sense, well, every sense except sound. It's usually better when sound isn't a factor. At least when you're talking about food. When you're talking about music, sound is obviously a very important sense to talk about. I may go as far as to say that in a conversation about music, sound is the only sense that matters.I was excited to go with Carlos because I was going to get to eat their meat and actual cheese. The Paulie Gee's brisket is lean and delicious. Their pickled red onions possess a truly memorable tang and are worth spending a couple buck to add on to pretty much any pie. The ricotta dollops on the Ricky Ricotta feel more like bursts of a cream sauce than regular old cheese. Interestingly, the dairy and non-dairy ricotta cheeses are almost indecipherable in quality, which goes to show that Paulie Gee's knows what's up. Carlos and I were pleased to compliment the trad Italian flavors of the Ricky Ricotta with a tangy Barbecue Brisket pie. I'm psyched to go with a fellow omnivore again, because there are tons of other flavor combos I'm eager to try. New Yorkers, such as myself, are notorious for being dicks about the quality of pizza dough. It's the dough that invalidates the Chicago Deep Dish's false aspiration to pizza status. I can't stand Sicilian pizza either, which is a controversial take in Nueva York. Anyhow, no matter how well adorned a Paulie Gee's pie is, its base--the crust--is its most distinct and wonderful element. The crust is thin but springy, and always a little charred. It's pretty much naan bread, which is either a very luck coincidence or a visionary innovation. Naan bread, as you know, is lit, and, as it turns out, it is the perfect surface upon which various pizza ingredients should be placed and/or spread to mingle harmoniously.I've visited Paulie Gee's a number of times, and there's a bit of narrative that forms around my visits. The first time I tried to go, it was around noon, and my gf and I made the unpleasant discovery that Paulie Gee's does not open til 5 PM. The next time, we rolled up in a deep crew of six and had to wait about two to three hours for a table for six. If you find yourself in that position, you'll be okay though because there are plenty of bars around. There's also the water/skyline, mere yards away and a nice record store a block away.The gf and I have gone a few other times and it's always been great--except for the one time that a camera crew was shooting a special on Paulie Gee's vegan options. My girlfriend and I were in the shot all throughout our meal, and we were fighting (as subtly as possible) for the duration of our meal. I was taken aback and somewhat miffed when the producers of the show asked to do a talking head with us outside. The tension was palpable but they still insisted on interviewing us. I really do believe that you should foot the bill if you're going to interview someone for your television series or web series or gratuitously long Yelp review or whatever. At LEAST commission me to write a song for the soundtrack.In closing, I would like to offer a lil sum sum for the ladies. Are you interested in grandfatherly, charmingly blue collar, short men whose personalities closely resemble those of most Robert De Niro characters--but only in David O. Russel movies? If you do, and might want to be possibly hit on by a man of this caliber, you will love Paulie Gee's. At all times, Paulie Gee's eponymous Pizza Architect and Entrepreneur, Paulie Gee, stalks the narrow spaces between tables, checking in with customers--particularly of the reasonably attractive female demographic--and asks them how their food is, making small talk and thanking them for their patronage. I think this is cool. I would do the same if I were in his position, so don't take this the wrong way. Central to Paulie Gee's game is his ability to recommend a pizza place in seemingly every zip code on the planet and his inclination to tell you (the lady in question) the name of the dude who works there/owns the place, and to tell you (still the lady in question) to tell the dude (who owns the pizza place) to say that he (Paulie Gee) says hi.

"Some of the best za in the city, bar none. The lady and I traveled far and wide for it since we'd heard such great things. It was a Friday night so the restaurant was predictably packed. There's not much in the form of a waiting area, which particularly sucked given how freezing the weather was, but we had a feeling the pie would be well worth the wait (plus we also got to watch a tipsy couple aggressively suck face up close and personal which was an unexpected but enjoyable twist).The vibe was cool, featuring low--lighting, a huge and beautiful custom brick oven, and trendy attractive people who's favorite bands you've never heard of.When we finally were seated I was stoked to see the menu offered a huge variety of pies with all sorts of niche toppings AND vegan options(I personally don't give two damns about veganism but they presented them in an unpretentious way so I was cool with it).

"After a 2-hours wait on a weekend for a party of 2, we finally got a table at the renowned pizza shop in Brooklyn. After having one of the best pizzas of all time at Little Isabella located in Baltimore, I was on the mission to find its companion in NYC. Overhyped as we suspected, Paulie Gee had nothing on Little Isabella! Perhaps, it was the quirky blend of sweet and savory flavors, but with that 2-hour wait, we surely did not have a pleasing experience.We ordered two pies: HellBoy and Greenpointer. HellBoy: Fresh Mozzarella, Italian Tomatoes, Berkshire Sopressata Piccante, Parmigiano Reggiano and Mike's HOT HoneyGreenpointer:Fresh Mozzarella, Baby Arugula, Olive Oil, Fresh Lemon Juice and Shaved Parmigiano ReggianoWe didn't really enjoy the sweetness of the honey in the HellBoy or the sourness of the lemon juice in the Greenpointer. Fresh, as we saw them make each pie to order, I definitely thought the doughiness of the pizza wasn't anything spectacular. In terms of service, I think it was pretty solid. Our waiter was patient and helpful. As a surprise, Paulie Gee himself introduced himself to just about every table, making it feel quite personable. In all, I definitely wouldn't return back to this pizzeria, especially with that crazy wait. During that 2-hour wait and 1.5-hour dining time, I can drive down to Baltimore and get some Little Isabella for half the price and no wait!",3.0

I take my pizza very seriously. The vegan pizza is so good here that if they didn't tell you it was vegan you would have no clue. I had the pie with vegan sausage and shared a few others with friends. It was all out of this world. I can't wait to go back again.,5.0
"There's a LOT of really great pizza in NYC, that's nothing new. But combine amazing pizza with friendly, caring service and a killer ambiance, and Paulie Gee's has a leg up on a lot of the other heavy hitters. The wait can be crazy, but we came in on a Tuesday night and it was half empty. I guess the key is to come when there's post-blizzard sludge everywhere and no one else wants to go out. Paulie Gee was there as I'm told he usually is, weaving around the space with his cup of coffee and stopping at literally every table. For us, he offered to curate our pizza order and who were we to argue? Read on for what Paulie Gee himself recommends:- The Greenpointer: according to Paulie, basically like eating a salad due to the piles of fresh baby arugula on top. - The Mo Cheeks: My personal favorite of the meal. The pickled onions on there are a nice surprise, and give a nice kick to the rest of the ingredients. - The Monte Cristo: OK, so this is probably something I would never think to order myself, but I'm glad it came out for us because it's actually super tasty. It comes with Canadian bacon and a drizzle of maple syrup, which I know sounds weird but trust me (or rather, trust Paulie). - I didn't catch the name of the last pizza, but it was one of the best and after peeking at the menu again I think it might have been the Hellboy. It was piled high with the tastiest Berkshire Sopressata, and it was perfect with the side of Mike's hot honey (which you haven't tried on pizza you must immediately). They asked if we wanted a dessert pizza but at that point we were stuffed to the gills. It was one of the best New York pizza experiences I've had so far, and the service is what really puts them above and beyond. I'm going to run for vice-president of the Paulie Gee fanclub soon!",5.0
"Came here a few days ago with my friend after work. Very dark inside, took some time for my eyeballs to adjust lol. We started off with some beers and then went with the Hellboy which was AMAZING. The hot honey makes a difference! Then we went with a vegan pie since neither one of us was particularly full. We ordered one with spinach, sea salt and garlic on it (sorry don't remember the name!) It was OK, not that memorable. The standout is by far Hellboy, the crust for both pizzas was SUPER THIN, firm and didn't fall apart on me. We both liked it. I took off a star for the spinach pie being nothing special and that it's a bit on the pricey side. Overall, I think I'll be back to try the other pizzas on the menu!",4.0
"Maybe we came on an off night, but we didn't care too much about the pizza and it was definitely not the best we've had. My friend wanted to celebrate her belated birthday at Paulie Gee's and so we did. We ordered 3 pies (Greenpointer, Ricotta Be Kidding Me, and The Hometown Brisket). I think the Hometown Brisket was our favorite only because of the BBQ sauce. Other than that, there wasn't much brisket pieces on the pizza. Ricotta Be Kidding Me was okay. The Greenpointer was all greens so that balanced our meal a little bit. I hear people waiting for hours to get a seat here and right now I'm just wondering where all the hype went? We came when they were opening, so thank goodness we didn't wait on line for this...cause it wouldn't have been worth it. FYI: There's no sign outside that says ""Paulie Gee's"". You just have to look by the address number ""60"" in order to find this place. I actually walked passed it while we were trying to find it. Also, use your flash on your phones to read the menu. I really liked the rustic interior but it was literally pitch black in there.",3.0
"Zagat rated the hellboy as the best pizza in NYC. Wow! Big call Zagat... We had to try! We would say it was delicious... But I would have to say Marta is equal of not just ahead. We got here at 6:40 and had to wait over an hr to sit at the bar. When getting here service was prompt and food was great! We ordered the hellboy and the hellified porkpie white and I have to say it was fresh, full of flavor and great value. My only critique would be more hot suppressa on the hellified and take numbers at the door! It's a little unreasonable to ask people to wait 90 mins and not offer to call when table it ready. Either way it was great but probably won't be crossing the river to wait another 90 mins.",4.0
"If there was ever a restaurant that inspires the need for #PiDay (3.14) to be everyday, it is Paulie Gee's. The pizza is a true art, and every bite is important, from the center to the crust crust.  PG is located in pizza heaven, or right near the water on Greenpoint Ave if you want a Google Map friendly address.Read it on my blog: highclasstohighlifes.com…As you'll see below I'm constantly on the proscuitt of happiness but this time we went for a different ham, Canadian bacon, and on the Monte Cristo. You bet it counted towards happiness. This pizza combines maple syrup drizzle and gouda with the ham. Yes, yes and more yes. Paulie asked if we had butter on the crust...sadly, no. SO MUCH REGRET....that I'll be back in no time to try it. You'll notice on the menu that they have a brisket pizza that features Hometown BBQ -- I love this local BK collaboration. You can get sauced the other way too with Greenpoint local brews!Anyway, I have nearly eaten my way through the entire menu (still need to do a bit of adventuring on the vegan side, every time I get close, I just want meat...) and I have been very pleased with every slice thus far. Therefore my advice to you is go with the pizza that's toppings are most appealing...or grab a handful of friends and share, then you can try multiple pizzas!The man, who is not a myth, but definitely a legend is often found inside checking in on tables, ensuring quality control and getting to know the patrons. He loved my last Instagram post that did a little play words...sharing that I was on the prosciutt of happiness with his King Henry Classic. He's always all smiles and usually wearing a great hat, he is Paulie Gee himself. Paulie Gee's - High Class to High Lifes If you really knead to get delivery or pickup, you'll have to look elsewhere for now though. The only way to leave Paulie Gee's with a to-go box is with leftovers. Rumor has it that a slice joint is opening up nearby though! I'm counting down the days, hours and minutes. Want to keep drooling? Read the menu!Pro Tip: Grab dinner at Paulie Gee's then walk straight out on the water in Greenpoint to Transmitter park or the outlook. Maybe even catch a sunset and BYO night cap!",5.0
"My old pal Carlos and I visited Paulie Gee's last night and had a great meal. I'm accustomed to going with the ol' vegan girlfriend and have a tradition where we split two pies from their extensive vegan selection, so we can try two different types of pies. The vegan and non-vegan selections are both extensive; each category has at least a half dozen kinds of pies, including oil bases, white slices, marinara, spinach-based, spicy honey and barbecue sauce foundations. The pies are aesthetically pleasing to every sense, well, every sense except sound. It's usually better when sound isn't a factor. At least when you're talking about food. When you're talking about music, sound is obviously a very important sense to talk about. I may go as far as to say that in a conversation about music, sound is the only sense that matters.I was excited to go with Carlos because I was going to get to eat their meat and actual cheese. The Paulie Gee's brisket is lean and delicious. Their pickled red onions possess a truly memorable tang and are worth spending a couple buck to add on to pretty much any pie. The ricotta dollops on the Ricky Ricotta feel more like bursts of a cream sauce than regular old cheese. Interestingly, the dairy and non-dairy ricotta cheeses are almost indecipherable in quality, which goes to show that Paulie Gee's knows what's up. Carlos and I were pleased to compliment the trad Italian flavors of the Ricky Ricotta with a tangy Barbecue Brisket pie. I'm psyched to go with a fellow omnivore again, because there are tons of other flavor combos I'm eager to try. New Yorkers, such as myself, are notorious for being dicks about the quality of pizza dough. It's the dough that invalidates the Chicago Deep Dish's false aspiration to pizza status. I can't stand Sicilian pizza either, which is a controversial take in Nueva York. Anyhow, no matter how well adorned a Paulie Gee's pie is, its base--the crust--is its most distinct and wonderful element. The crust is thin but springy, and always a little charred. It's pretty much naan bread, which is either a very luck coincidence or a visionary innovation. Naan bread, as you know, is lit, and, as it turns out, it is the perfect surface upon which various pizza ingredients should be placed and/or spread to mingle harmoniously.I've visited Paulie Gee's a number of times, and there's a bit of narrative that forms around my visits. The first time I tried to go, it was around noon, and my gf and I made the unpleasant discovery that Paulie Gee's does not open til 5 PM. The next time, we rolled up in a deep crew of six and had to wait about two to three hours for a table for six. If you find yourself in that position, you'll be okay though because there are plenty of bars around. There's also the water/skyline, mere yards away and a nice record store a block away.The gf and I have gone a few other times and it's always been great--except for the one time that a camera crew was shooting a special on Paulie Gee's vegan options. My girlfriend and I were in the shot all throughout our meal, and we were fighting (as subtly as possible) for the duration of our meal. I was taken aback and somewhat miffed when the producers of the show asked to do a talking head with us outside. The tension was palpable but they still insisted on interviewing us. I really do believe that you should foot the bill if you're going to interview someone for your television series or web series or gratuitously long Yelp review or whatever. At LEAST commission me to write a song for the soundtrack.In closing, I would like to offer a lil sum sum for the ladies. Are you interested in grandfatherly, charmingly blue collar, short men whose personalities closely resemble those of most Robert De Niro characters--but only in David O. Russel movies? If you do, and might want to be possibly hit on by a man of this caliber, you will love Paulie Gee's. At all times, Paulie Gee's eponymous Pizza Architect and Entrepreneur, Paulie Gee, stalks the narrow spaces between tables, checking in with customers--particularly of the reasonably attractive female demographic--and asks them how their food is, making small talk and thanking them for their patronage. I think this is cool. I would do the same if I were in his position, so don't take this the wrong way. Central to Paulie Gee's game is his ability to recommend a pizza place in seemingly every zip code on the planet and his inclination to tell you (the lady in question) the name of the dude who works there/owns the place, and to tell you (still the lady in question) to tell the dude (who owns the pizza place) to say that he (Paulie Gee) says hi. The Brotherhood of Pizza Mans is truly alive and well.",5.0

"I almost feel like it's blasphemy for not giving 5 stars. Finally made my way over here at Paulie Gees after way too long. Clearly this place is GPs staple so was excited to drop by on Wednesday night.There was no wait- very good. I had been worried about this so called 3x around 6:45pm to see how long it was before heading over. No one picked up and their answering service basically hangs up on you. I ordered the Daniela and he ordered the brisket pizza. Mine came out a good 7 minutes before his. I noticed immediately that about 40% of the crust was charred to the point of being inedible. To top that off, the spinach topping my pizza was the same. It was literally a black piece of ash and when I picked a leaf up or crumbled in my hands. The cheese blend was very good (mozzarella and Parmesan) but the pizza was just not good. To top it off, parts of the center were soggy and didn't hold the toppings when I grabbed a slice. When the brisket pizza came out a few minutes later I noticed immediately that it was cooked perfectly. The crust was edible and delicious. I was bummed that mine didn't come out this way especially since it seemed like a classic. All I can say is they probably put our orders in together and maybe his needed a little longer in the oven. Mine was most likely getting over cooked while his needed a few more minutes. Hence the gap in time between both of our orders coming out and the reason why mine was half done by the time his came out.I was really disappointed but the good thing to know is at least the brisket pizza was cooked well. I know there is a good meal at Paulie Gees but I feel like we were jipped.Also, great touch that Paulie himself came in to greet all the diners. He was super friendly and it brings a family quality to the place. This is maybe one of the main reasons I'd come back.",3.0
"Delicious!! Definitely made my top 3 favorite pizza  places (the others being robertas and best pizza). We've been meaning to come forever but the line is always so long. We were finally seated right away on a Friday night because we ran over as soon as they opened at 6pm. I would highly recommend this tactic to those of you who have been meaning to come and haven't been able to due to the wait -- the food will be worth it. We ordered the hellboy, ricotta be kidding me and the hot honey ice cream Sunday for dessert. The hellboy was our fave. It was basically a pepperoni pizza with hot honey lined under the cheese. I liked it more than the bees sting from Robertas but both are very good. All in all would highly recommend. As an extra plus Paulie Gee was hanging around today,though it seems like he does this quite often, going from table to table talking to the customers.",5.0
"My husband and I visited Paulie Gee's about two years ago and he still dreams of the Hellboy. This time we ordered the Hellboy and Cherry Jones.  The Hellboy was great but just a touch too sweet for me.  The hot honey adds a little kick but is definitely not too hot.  My husband will tell you it is the best pizza he has ever had (saying a lot since he was raised in the Bronx).  The Cherry Jones on the other hand was way too sweet for both of us.  I couldn't taste anything other then honey.  My husband embarrassed me by telling the waitress we didn't like it.  She offered us a replacement.  We ordered the Ricky Ricotta.  It was alright.  I was shocked because the ricotta was not warm.  The crust at Paulie Gee's is the perfect texture.  However, two of our three pizzas were too charred for my taste.  I must mention Paulie walks around all the tables to make sure everyone is enjoying.  Love it!  The restaurant is too dark and loud for my taste.",3.0
"Interesting decor, super dark inside and it was hard to read the menu. We were seated under one of the speakers, so I felt like an old person complaining about how loud the music was, but really, we came for the food. Split a salad and a Greenpointer pie, and neither disappointed. Both were served quickly, and the pie just exploded with flavor. The lemon kick was strong but not overwhelming, and the crust was perfection. Service was attentive, friendly, and efficient. Lots of menu choices for anything your palate is craving. Overall, a very good experience, and one I would look forward to enjoying again.",4.0
"New York probably takes its pizza more seriously than anywhere else in the world.  I'm sure there are 7 or 8 people reading this right now that would be willing to shiv a guy for saying something bad about their favorite slice.  With that in mind, Paulie Gee's is a pizza lover's pizza place.  They make Neapolitan style pizzas with an oven shipped in from Naples and lovingly reassembled by small, Italian elves.  From this oven, comes perfectly leopard-spotted pizzas with just the right amount of bouncy chewy dough.To top the pizza, there's a lovingly curated selection to choose from so don't you dare ask for substitutions.  Lucky for you whether you're a vegan, vegetarian, white/red pie lover, averse to spice, meat lover, or whatever!  There's at least one pie on the menu* that will make you say, ""hmmm..."".  My personal favorites are the Mo' Cheeks ($16, has guanciale and is perfect with the pickled onions) and Ricotta Be Kidding Me ($17, with tons of meat topped with adorable dollops of cottage cheese).  I've only ever had 1 pizza there that wasn't stellar and I won't tell you which one because you'll definitely judge me for choosing it in the first place.The atmosphere at Paulie Gee's is great.  It's quintessential Brooklyn.  Think dark unfinished wood walls with an eclectic collection of tables made from reclaimed wood, music consisting of a mixture of jazz, rock, and anything but top 40s.  What always makes my night is that the ACTUAL Paulie Gee walks around and talks to EVERYONE.  It doesn't matter if Keri Russell** is sitting right next to you, he will still come by and have a 5-20 minute conversation with you and your table.  My only complaint is how popular this place is.  They've stopped making pizzas to go and still, the wait is crazy.  I've never been able to get a table in less than 45 minutes unless it was late at night.  I guess that's not a bad problem to have.  I also kind of wish they would get a full liquor license and take that creative pizza combo creating mind into the cocktail realm.  I mean...Mike's Hot Honey + Whiskey?  Maybe?---------* If you can't find a pizza you like on the printed menu in the restaurant, whip out the smartphone and check out the ""secret"" menu on the website.** This actually happened.",4.0

It was piled high with the tastiest Berkshire Sopressata, and it was perfect with the side of Mike's hot honey (which you haven't tried on pizza you must immediately). They asked if we wanted a dessert pizza but at that point we were stuffed to the gills. It was one of the best New York pizza experiences I've had so far, and the service is what really puts them above and beyond. I'm going to run for vice-president of the Paulie Gee fanclub soon!",5.0
"Came here a few days ago with my friend after work. Very dark inside, took some time for my eyeballs to adjust lol. We started off with some beers and then went with the Hellboy which was AMAZING. The hot honey makes a difference! Then we went with a vegan pie since neither one of us was particularly full. We ordered one with spinach, sea salt and garlic on it (sorry don't remember the name!) It was OK, not that memorable. The standout is by far Hellboy, the crust for both pizzas was SUPER THIN, firm and didn't fall apart on me. We both liked it.

"Maybe we came on an off night, but we didn't care too much about the pizza and it was definitely not the best we've had. My friend wanted to celebrate her belated birthday at Paulie Gee's and so we did. We ordered 3 pies (Greenpointer, Ricotta Be Kidding Me, and The Hometown Brisket). I think the Hometown Brisket was our favorite only because of the BBQ sauce. Other than that, there wasn't much brisket pieces on the pizza. Ricotta Be Kidding Me was okay. The Greenpointer was all greens so that balanced our meal a little bit. I hear people waiting for hours to get a seat here and right now I'm just wondering where all the hype went? We came when they were opening, so thank goodness we didn't wait on line for this...cause it wouldn't have been worth it. FYI: There's no sign outside that says ""Paulie Gee's"".

"My old pal Carlos and I visited Paulie Gee's last night and had a great meal. I'm accustomed to going with the ol' vegan girlfriend and have a tradition where we split two pies from their extensive vegan selection, so we can try two different types of pies. The vegan and non-vegan selections are both extensive; each category has at least a half dozen kinds of pies, including oil bases, white slices, marinara, spinach-based, spicy honey and barbecue sauce foundations. The pies are aesthetically pleasing to every sense, well, every sense except sound. It's usually better when sound isn't a factor. At least when you're talking about food. When you're talking about music, sound is obviously a very important sense to talk about. I may go as far as to say that in a conversation about music, sound is the only sense that matters.I was excited to go with Carlos because I was going to get to eat their meat and actual cheese. The Paulie Gee's brisket is lean and delicious. Their pickled red onions possess a truly memorable tang and are worth spending a couple buck to add on to pretty much any pie. The ricotta dollops on the Ricky Ricotta feel more like bursts of a cream sauce than regular old cheese. Interestingly, the dairy and non-dairy ricotta cheeses are almost indecipherable in quality, which goes to show that Paulie Gee's knows what's up. Carlos and I were pleased to compliment the trad Italian flavors of the Ricky Ricotta with a tangy Barbecue Brisket pie. I'm psyched to go with a fellow omnivore again, because there are tons of other flavor combos I'm eager to try. New Yorkers, such as myself, are notorious for being dicks about the quality of pizza dough. It's the dough that invalidates the Chicago Deep Dish's false aspiration to pizza status. I can't stand Sicilian pizza either, which is a controversial take in Nueva York. Anyhow, no matter how well adorned a Paulie Gee's pie is, its base--the crust--is its most distinct and wonderful element. The crust is thin but springy, and always a little charred. It's pretty much naan bread, which is either a very luck coincidence or a visionary innovation. Naan bread, as you know, is lit, and, as it turns out, it is the perfect surface upon which various pizza ingredients should be placed and/or spread to mingle harmoniously.I've visited Paulie Gee's a number of times, and there's a bit of narrative that forms around my visits. The first time I tried to go, it was around noon, and my gf and I made the unpleasant discovery that Paulie Gee's does not open til 5 PM. The next time, we rolled up in a deep crew of six and had to wait about two to three hours for a table for six. If you find yourself in that position, you'll be okay though because there are plenty of bars around. There's also the water/skyline, mere yards away and a nice record store a block away.The gf and I have gone a few other times and it's always been great--except for the one time that a camera crew was shooting a special on Paulie Gee's vegan options. My girlfriend and I were in the shot all throughout our meal, and we were fighting (as subtly as possible) for the duration of our meal. I was taken aback and somewhat miffed when the producers of the show asked to do a talking head with us outside. The tension was palpable but they still insisted on interviewing us. I really do believe that you should foot the bill if you're going to interview someone for your television series or web series or gratuitously long Yelp review or whatever. At LEAST commission me to write a song for the soundtrack.In closing, I would like to offer a lil sum sum for the ladies. Are you interested in grandfatherly, charmingly blue collar, short men whose personalities closely resemble those of most Robert De Niro characters--but only in David O. Russel movies? If you do, and might want to be possibly hit on by a man of this caliber, you will love Paulie Gee's. At all times, Paulie Gee's eponymous Pizza Architect and Entrepreneur, Paulie Gee, stalks the narrow spaces between tables, checking in with customers--particularly of the reasonably attractive female demographic--and asks them how their food is, making small talk and thanking them for their patronage. I think this is cool. I would do the same if I were in his position, so don't take this the wrong way. Central to Paulie Gee's game is his ability to recommend a pizza place in seemingly every zip code on the planet and his inclination to tell you (the lady in question) the name of the dude who works there/owns the place, and to tell you (still the lady in question) to tell the dude (who owns the pizza place) to say that he (Paulie Gee) says hi. The Brotherhood of Pizza Mans is truly alive and well.",5.0

"I almost feel like it's blasphemy for not giving 5 stars. Finally made my way over here at Paulie Gees after way too long. Clearly this place is GPs staple so was excited to drop by on Wednesday night.There was no wait- very good. I had been worried about this so called 3x around 6:45pm to see how long it was before heading over. No one picked up and their answering service basically hangs up on you. I ordered the Daniela and he ordered the brisket pizza. Mine came out a good 7 minutes before his. I noticed immediately that about 40% of the crust was charred to the point of being inedible. To top that off, the spinach topping my pizza was the same. It was literally a black piece of ash and when I picked a leaf up or crumbled in my hands. The cheese blend was very good (mozzarella and Parmesan) but the pizza was just not good. To top it off, parts of the center were soggy and didn't hold the toppings when I grabbed a slice. When the brisket pizza came out a few minutes later I noticed immediately that it was cooked perfectly. The crust was edible and delicious. I was bummed that mine didn't come out this way especially since it seemed like a classic. All I can say is they probably put our orders in together and maybe his needed a little longer in the oven. Mine was most likely getting over cooked while his needed a few more minutes. Hence the gap in time between both of our orders coming out and the reason why mine was half done by the time his came out.I was really disappointed but the good thing to know is at least the brisket pizza was cooked well. I know there is a good meal at Paulie Gees but I feel like we were jipped.Also, great touch that Paulie himself came in to greet all the diners. He was super friendly and it brings a family quality to the place. This is maybe one of the main reasons I'd come back.",3.0
"Delicious!! Definitely made my top 3 favorite pizza  places (the others being robertas and best pizza). We've been meaning to come forever but the line is always so long. We were finally seated right away on a Friday night because we ran over as soon as they opened at 6pm. I would highly recommend this tactic to those of you who have been meaning to come and haven't been able to due to the wait -- the food will be worth it. We ordered the hellboy, ricotta be kidding me and the hot honey ice cream Sunday for dessert. The hellboy was our fave. It was basically a pepperoni pizza with hot honey lined under the cheese. I liked it more than the bees sting from Robertas but both are very good. All in all would highly recommend. As an extra plus Paulie Gee was hanging around today,though it seems like he does this quite often, going from table to table talking to the customers.",5.0
"My husband and I visited Paulie Gee's about two years ago and he still dreams of the Hellboy. This time we ordered the Hellboy and Cherry Jones.  The Hellboy was great but just a touch too sweet for me.  The hot honey adds a little kick but is definitely not too hot.  My husband will tell you it is the best pizza he has ever had (saying a lot since he was raised in the Bronx).  The Cherry Jones on the other hand was way too sweet for both of us.  I couldn't taste anything other then honey.  My husband embarrassed me by telling the waitress we didn't like it.  She offered us a replacement.  We ordered the Ricky Ricotta.  It was alright.  I was shocked because the ricotta was not warm.  The crust at Paulie Gee's is the perfect texture.  However, two of our three pizzas were too charred for my taste.  I must mention Paulie walks around all the tables to make sure everyone is enjoying.  Love it!  The restaurant is too dark and loud for my taste.",3.0
"Interesting decor, super dark inside and it was hard to read the menu. We were seated under one of the speakers, so I felt like an old person complaining about how loud the music was, but really, we came for the food. Split a salad and a Greenpointer pie, and neither disappointed. Both were served quickly, and the pie just exploded with flavor. The lemon kick was strong but not overwhelming, and the crust was perfection. Service was attentive, friendly, and efficient. Lots of menu choices for anything your palate is craving. Overall, a very good experience, and one I would look forward to enjoying again.",4.0
"New York probably takes its pizza more seriously than anywhere else in the world.  I'm sure there are 7 or 8 people reading this right now that would be willing to shiv a guy for saying something bad about their favorite slice.  With that in mind, Paulie Gee's is a pizza lover's pizza place.  They make Neapolitan style pizzas with an oven shipped in from Naples and lovingly reassembled by small, Italian elves.  From this oven, comes perfectly leopard-spotted pizzas with just the right amount of bouncy chewy dough.To top the pizza, there's a lovingly curated selection to choose from so don't you dare ask for substitutions.  Lucky for you whether you're a vegan, vegetarian, white/red pie lover, averse to spice, meat lover, or whatever!  There's at least one pie on the menu* that will make you say, ""hmmm..."".  My personal favorites are the Mo' Cheeks ($16, has guanciale and is perfect with the pickled onions) and Ricotta Be Kidding Me ($17, with tons of meat topped with adorable dollops of cottage cheese).  I've only ever had 1 pizza there that wasn't stellar and I won't tell you which one because you'll definitely judge me for choosing it in the first place.The atmosphere at Paulie Gee's is great.  It's quintessential Brooklyn.  Think dark unfinished wood walls with an eclectic collection of tables made from reclaimed wood, music consisting of a mixture of jazz, rock, and anything but top 40s.  What always makes my night is that the ACTUAL Paulie Gee walks around and talks to EVERYONE.  It doesn't matter if Keri Russell** is sitting right next to you, he will still come by and have a 5-20 minute conversation with you and your table.  My only complaint is how popular this place is.  They've stopped making pizzas to go and still, the wait is crazy.  I've never been able to get a table in less than 45 minutes unless it was late at night.  I guess that's not a bad problem to have.  I also kind of wish they would get a full liquor license and take that creative pizza combo creating mind into the cocktail realm.  I mean...Mike's Hot Honey + Whiskey?  Maybe?---------* If you can't find a pizza you like on the printed menu in the restaurant, whip out the smartphone and check out the ""secret"" menu on the website.** This actually happened.",4.0
"We've literally flown across the country to enjoy his pizza. It's that good! Walking in, the aroma of pizza cooking in a brick oven hits your nose.This is about time my stomach starts to growl. The vibe is flowing with positive energy, and the low lighting is flattering & sexy. The bar to the left is where you can order a beverage while you wait.  They have a decent beer selection. Wait times vary, but it's usually not as long as anticipated, and well worth the effort.Everyone, including the servers, seem happy to be there.Paulie Gee is the utmost host. He's always found time to come to our table with suggestions, stories, and the occasional limoncello, (his recipe of the celebratory cocktail).Talking with him, I've gathered that he makes the vegan pizza for the people, or demand for it, but he didn't seem interested in the cause. The funky bathrooms can be a challenge to use when you've had one too many! VEGAN Pies we LOVE Simply RedVegan Tomato Sauce with Tomatoes, Olive Oil.

"Absolutely delicious. Huge selection of pies - good for meatatarians, vegetarians, and even vegans. Wood fire oven delivers the signature light smoke and char. Dough is absolutely tender and springy. They even let the pizza rest afterwards so the cheese sets and you don't burn the crap out of your mouth.Hellboy- spicy pepperoni with hot honey. Absolute classic pizza. Hot honey perfectly blankets the spicy meat. Super simple, absolutely delicious. Get two, trust meRicotta/sausage pie - similar to one above, hot honey included. However ricotta and sausage are a welcome addition.

"One of the challenges of  being vegan is getting your friends/family to be open to the idea of trying vegan food.I have never had Vegan Pizza before and I usually try to try a restaurant first before recommending to anyone especially a non vegan but I took a chance.When we first arrived we were having trouble picking something since everything was foreign to us. Someone sitting next to us saw our struggle and took us to try the  IN Ricotta Da Vegan so we did. AMAZING!! My non vegan date was impressed and I was so happy.Thanks Paulie Gee for making me looking good Whew! One pie (6 small slices) goes for 16 bucks . Its small, nice ambiance I would say its a little darkI would go again!Menu like here ------ pauliegee.com/greenpoint… xoxoC.",4.0
"Some of the best za in the city, bar none. The lady and I traveled far and wide for it since we'd heard such great things. It was a Friday night so the restaurant was predictably packed. There's not much in the form of a waiting area, which particularly sucked given how freezing the weather was, but we had a feeling the pie would be well worth the wait (plus we also got to watch a tipsy couple aggressively suck face up close and personal which was an unexpected but enjoyable twist).The vibe was cool, featuring low--lighting, a huge and beautiful custom brick oven, and trendy attractive people who's favorite bands you've never heard of.When we finally were seated I was stoked to see the menu offered a huge variety of pies with all sorts of niche toppings AND vegan options(I personally don't give two damns about veganism but they presented them in an unpretentious way so I was cool with it). We eventually decided to go with the Hell Boy and the Prokypineapple, both of which were amazing, and I'm looking forward to going back and further chowing my way down the menu.Go here.",5.0
"After a 2-hours wait on a weekend for a party of 2, we finally got a table at the renowned pizza shop in Brooklyn. After having one of the best pizzas of all time at Little Isabella located in Baltimore, I was on the mission to find its companion in NYC. Overhyped as we suspected, Paulie Gee had nothing on Little Isabella! Perhaps, it was the quirky blend of sweet and savory flavors, but with that 2-hour wait, we surely did not have a pleasing experience.We ordered two pies: HellBoy and Greenpointer. HellBoy: Fresh Mozzarella, Italian Tomatoes, Berkshire Sopressata Piccante, Parmigiano Reggiano and Mike's HOT HoneyGreenpointer:Fresh Mozzarella, Baby Arugula, Olive Oil, Fresh Lemon Juice and Shaved Parmigiano ReggianoWe didn't really enjoy the sweetness of the honey in the HellBoy or the sourness of the lemon juice in the Greenpointer. Fresh, as we saw them make each pie to order, I definitely thought the doughiness of the pizza wasn't anything spectacular. In terms of service, I think it was pretty solid. Our waiter was patient and helpful. As a surprise, Paulie Gee himself introduced himself to just about every table, making it feel quite personable. In all, I definitely wouldn't return back to this pizzeria, especially with that crazy wait. During that 2-hour wait and 1.5-hour dining time, I can drive down to Baltimore and get some Little Isabella for half the price and no wait!",3.0
"3.5 stars for this pizza joint hidden behind a HUGE wooden door all the way down Franklin streetCrust was good with a nice char on the hellboy but the crust of the greenpoint pizza seemed a bit underdone We were quoted a 1.5 hour wait at 8pm for 3 on a Saturday but we were lucky that people in front of us hadn't returned so we were seated right away! (so don't be discouraged)---hellboy: everything was good about this except that spicy honey! Should of gone with a more classic margherita style pizza instead---greenpoint: fresh arugula, with a bit too much lemon juice, so nothing special NOTE: they don't have pepper flakes, only chili oil",4.0
"If you want great pizza and the right atmosphere look no further than Paulie Gee's. We sat at the bar (luckily) and avoided a two hour wait.  The pizza choices are numerous, with some very creative options. There were three of us and we started with two pies. Would have been content but it was so good we ordered a third.The texture. The crust. The toppings. Hard pressed to mention anything I didn't like. I love pizza and this place is right up there with the best. That includes many pizzerias throughout Italy.Paulie stopped by for a chat and he has a fantastic personality. Great stories and it is obvious that he loves what he does and holds him team to very high standards.He was also kind enough to give me an official Paulie Gee's pin and a limoncello. A very nice touch!Make sure you check out the pizza oven in the back. It's a small,cozy place so don't pass this place up in you are in NY.",5.0
I take my pizza very seriously. The vegan pizza is so good here that if they didn't tell you it was vegan you would have no clue. I had the pie with vegan sausage and shared a few others with friends. It was all out of this world. I can't wait to go back again.,5.0
"There's a LOT of really great pizza in NYC, that's nothing new. But combine amazing pizza with friendly, caring service and a killer ambiance, and Paulie Gee's has a leg up on a lot of the other heavy hitters. The wait can be crazy, but we came in on a Tuesday night and it was half empty. I guess the key is to come when there's post-blizzard sludge everywhere and no one else wants to go out. Paulie Gee was there as I'm told he usually is, weaving around the space with his cup of coffee and stopping at literally every table. For us, he offered to curate our pizza order and who were we to argue? Read on for what Paulie Gee himself recommends:- The Greenpointer: according to Paulie, basically like eating a salad due to the piles of fresh baby arugula on top. - The Mo Cheeks: My personal favorite of the meal. The pickled onions on there are a nice surprise, and give a nice kick to the rest of the ingredients. - The Monte Cristo: OK, so this is probably something I would never think to order myself, but I'm glad it came out for us because it's actually super tasty.

The first time I tried to go, it was around noon, and my gf and I made the unpleasant discovery that Paulie Gee's does not open til 5 PM. The next time, we rolled up in a deep crew of six and had to wait about two to three hours for a table for six.

My girlfriend and I were in the shot all throughout our meal, and we were fighting (as subtly as possible) for the duration of our meal. I was taken aback and somewhat miffed when the producers of the show asked to do a talking head with us outside. The tension was palpable but they still insisted on interviewing us.

"I almost feel like it's blasphemy for not giving 5 stars. Finally made my way over here at Paulie Gees after way too long. Clearly this place is GPs staple so was excited to drop by on Wednesday night.There was no wait- very good. I had been worried about this so called 3x around 6:45pm to see how long it was before heading over. No one picked up and their answering service basically hangs up on you. I ordered the Daniela and he ordered the brisket pizza. Mine came out a good 7 minutes before his. I noticed immediately that about 40% of the crust was charred to the point of being inedible. To top that off, the spinach topping my pizza was the same. It was literally a black piece of ash and when I picked a leaf up or crumbled in my hands. The cheese blend was very good (mozzarella and Parmesan) but the pizza was just not good. To top it off, parts of the center were soggy and didn't hold the toppings when I grabbed a slice. When the brisket pizza came out a few minutes later I noticed immediately that it was cooked perfectly. The crust was edible and delicious. I was bummed that mine didn't come out this way especially since it seemed like a classic. All I can say is they probably put our orders in together and maybe his needed a little longer in the oven. Mine was most likely getting over cooked while his needed a few more minutes. Hence the gap in time between both of our orders coming out and the reason why mine was half done by the time his came out.I was really disappointed but the good thing to know is at least the brisket pizza was cooked well. I know there is a good meal at Paulie Gees but I feel like we were jipped.Also, great touch that Paulie himself came in to greet all the diners. He was super friendly and it brings a family quality to the place. This is maybe one of the main reasons I'd come back.",3.0

I would highly recommend this tactic to those of you who have been meaning to come and haven't been able to due to the wait -- the food will be worth it. We ordered the hellboy, ricotta be kidding me and the hot honey ice cream Sunday for dessert. The hellboy was our fave. It was basically a pepperoni pizza with hot honey lined under the cheese. I liked it more than the bees sting from Robertas but both are very good. All in all would highly recommend.

"My husband and I visited Paulie Gee's about two years ago and he still dreams of the Hellboy. This time we ordered the Hellboy and Cherry Jones.  The Hellboy was great but just a touch too sweet for me.  The hot honey adds a little kick but is definitely not too hot.  My husband will tell you it is the best pizza he has ever had (saying a lot since he was raised in the Bronx).  The Cherry Jones on the other hand was way too sweet for both of us.  I couldn't taste anything other then honey.  My husband embarrassed me by telling the waitress we didn't like it.  She offered us a replacement.  We ordered the Ricky Ricotta.  It was alright.  I was shocked because the ricotta was not warm.  The crust at Paulie Gee's is the perfect texture.  However, two of our three pizzas were too charred for my taste.  I must mention Paulie walks around all the tables to make sure everyone is enjoying.  Love it!  The restaurant is too dark and loud for my taste.",3.0

"New York probably takes its pizza more seriously than anywhere else in the world.  I'm sure there are 7 or 8 people reading this right now that would be willing to shiv a guy for saying something bad about their favorite slice.  With that in mind, Paulie Gee's is a pizza lover's pizza place.  They make Neapolitan style pizzas with an oven shipped in from Naples and lovingly reassembled by small, Italian elves.  From this oven, comes perfectly leopard-spotted pizzas with just the right amount of bouncy chewy dough.To top the pizza, there's a lovingly curated selection to choose from so don't you dare ask for substitutions.  Lucky for you whether you're a vegan, vegetarian, white/red pie lover, averse to spice, meat lover, or whatever!  There's at least one pie on the menu* that will make you say, ""hmmm..."".  My personal favorites are the Mo' Cheeks ($16, has guanciale and is perfect with the pickled onions) and Ricotta Be Kidding Me ($17, with tons of meat topped with adorable dollops of cottage cheese).  I've only ever had 1 pizza there that wasn't stellar and I won't tell you which one because you'll definitely judge me for choosing it in the first place.The atmosphere at Paulie Gee's is great.  It's quintessential Brooklyn.  Think dark unfinished wood walls with an eclectic collection of tables made from reclaimed wood, music consisting of a mixture of jazz, rock, and anything but top 40s.  What always makes my night is that the ACTUAL Paulie Gee walks around and talks to EVERYONE.  It doesn't matter if Keri Russell** is sitting right next to you, he will still come by and have a 5-20 minute conversation with you and your table.  My only complaint is how popular this place is.  They've stopped making pizzas to go and still, the wait is crazy.  I've never been able to get a table in less than 45 minutes unless it was late at night.  I guess that's not a bad problem to have.  I also kind of wish they would get a full liquor license and take that creative pizza combo creating mind into the cocktail realm.  I mean...Mike's Hot Honey + Whiskey?  Maybe?---------* If you can't find a pizza you like on the printed menu in the restaurant, whip out the smartphone and check out the ""secret"" menu on the website.** This actually happened.",4.0
"We've literally flown across the country to enjoy his pizza. It's that good! Walking in, the aroma of pizza cooking in a brick oven hits your nose.This is about time my stomach starts to growl. The vibe is flowing with positive energy, and the low lighting is flattering & sexy. The bar to the left is where you can order a beverage while you wait.  They have a decent beer selection. Wait times vary, but it's usually not as long as anticipated, and well worth the effort.Everyone, including the servers, seem happy to be there.Paulie Gee is the utmost host. He's always found time to come to our table with suggestions, stories, and the occasional limoncello, (his recipe of the celebratory cocktail).Talking with him, I've gathered that he makes the vegan pizza for the people, or demand for it, but he didn't seem interested in the cause. The funky bathrooms can be a challenge to use when you've had one too many! VEGAN Pies we LOVE Simply RedVegan Tomato Sauce with Tomatoes, Olive Oil. Vidalia Onions, Garlic, Basil, Salt and PepperVegan Daniela SpinaciBaby Spinach, Olive Oil, Fresh Sliced Garlic, Mild Aleppo Chili Oil and Sea SaltIn Ricotta Da VeganVegan Tomato Sauce, House Made Vegan Sausage, Post-oven House Made Cashew Ricotta Dollops, Baby Arugula and Extra Virgin Olive OilWith many return visits, we've yet to have a negative experience.There has been noise over the years of Paulie Giannone opening a Portland outpost, but it has yet to materialize. Meanwhile, I'll dream of his pizza.",5.0
"Absolutely delicious. Huge selection of pies - good for meatatarians, vegetarians, and even vegans. Wood fire oven delivers the signature light smoke and char. Dough is absolutely tender and springy. They even let the pizza rest afterwards so the cheese sets and you don't burn the crap out of your mouth.Hellboy- spicy pepperoni with hot honey. Absolute classic pizza. Hot honey perfectly blankets the spicy meat. Super simple, absolutely delicious. Get two, trust meRicotta/sausage pie - similar to one above, hot honey included. However ricotta and sausage are a welcome addition. While chunks of roasted garlic are an excellent accentSo many other pies, go try them for yourself.Big lines, put your name down and go drink at browerij lane.

"One of the challenges of  being vegan is getting your friends/family to be open to the idea of trying vegan food.I have never had Vegan Pizza before and I usually try to try a restaurant first before recommending to anyone especially a non vegan but I took a chance.When we first arrived we were having trouble picking something since everything was foreign to us. Someone sitting next to us saw our struggle and took us to try the  IN Ricotta Da Vegan so we did. AMAZING!! My non vegan date was impressed and I was so happy.Thanks Paulie Gee for making me looking good Whew! One pie (6 small slices) goes for 16 bucks . Its small, nice ambiance I would say its a little darkI would go again!Menu like here ------ pauliegee.com/greenpoint… xoxoC.",4.0
"Some of the best za in the city, bar none. The lady and I traveled far and wide for it since we'd heard such great things. It was a Friday night so the restaurant was predictably packed. There's not much in the form of a waiting area, which particularly sucked given how freezing the weather was, but we had a feeling the pie would be well worth the wait (plus we also got to watch a tipsy couple aggressively suck face up close and personal which was an unexpected but enjoyable twist).The vibe was cool, featuring low--lighting, a huge and beautiful custom brick oven, and trendy attractive people who's favorite bands you've never heard of.When we finally were seated I was stoked to see the menu offered a huge variety of pies with all sorts of niche toppings AND vegan options(I personally don't give two damns about veganism but they presented them in an unpretentious way so I was cool with it). We eventually decided to go with the Hell Boy and the Prokypineapple, both of which were amazing, and I'm looking forward to going back and further chowing my way down the menu.Go here.",5.0
"After a 2-hours wait on a weekend for a party of 2, we finally got a table at the renowned pizza shop in Brooklyn. After having one of the best pizzas of all time at Little Isabella located in Baltimore, I was on the mission to find its companion in NYC. Overhyped as we suspected, Paulie Gee had nothing on Little Isabella! Perhaps, it was the quirky blend of sweet and savory flavors, but with that 2-hour wait, we surely did not have a pleasing experience.We ordered two pies: HellBoy and Greenpointer. HellBoy: Fresh Mozzarella, Italian Tomatoes, Berkshire Sopressata Piccante, Parmigiano Reggiano and Mike's HOT HoneyGreenpointer:Fresh Mozzarella, Baby Arugula, Olive Oil, Fresh Lemon Juice and Shaved Parmigiano ReggianoWe didn't really enjoy the sweetness of the honey in the HellBoy or the sourness of the lemon juice in the Greenpointer. Fresh, as we saw them make each pie to order, I definitely thought the doughiness of the pizza wasn't anything spectacular. In terms of service, I think it was pretty solid. Our waiter was patient and helpful. As a surprise, Paulie Gee himself introduced himself to just about every table, making it feel quite personable. In all, I definitely wouldn't return back to this pizzeria, especially with that crazy wait. During that 2-hour wait and 1.5-hour dining time, I can drive down to Baltimore and get some Little Isabella for half the price and no wait!",3.0
"3.5 stars for this pizza joint hidden behind a HUGE wooden door all the way down Franklin streetCrust was good with a nice char on the hellboy but the crust of the greenpoint pizza seemed a bit underdone We were quoted a 1.5 hour wait at 8pm for 3 on a Saturday but we were lucky that people in front of us hadn't returned so we were seated right away! (so don't be discouraged)---hellboy: everything was good about this except that spicy honey! Should of gone with a more classic margherita style pizza instead---greenpoint: fresh arugula, with a bit too much lemon juice, so nothing special NOTE: they don't have pepper flakes, only chili oil",4.0
"If you want great pizza and the right atmosphere look no further than Paulie Gee's. We sat at the bar (luckily) and avoided a two hour wait.  The pizza choices are numerous, with some very creative options. There were three of us and we started with two pies. Would have been content but it was so good we ordered a third.The texture. The crust. The toppings. Hard pressed to mention anything I didn't like. I love pizza and this place is right up there with the best. That includes many pizzerias throughout Italy.Paulie stopped by for a chat and he has a fantastic personality. Great stories and it is obvious that he loves what he does and holds him team to very high standards.He was also kind enough to give me an official Paulie Gee's pin and a limoncello. A very nice touch!Make sure you check out the pizza oven in the back. It's a small,cozy place so don't pass this place up in you are in NY.",5.0
I take my pizza very seriously. The vegan pizza is so good here that if they didn't tell you it was vegan you would have no clue. I had the pie with vegan sausage and shared a few others with friends. It was all out of this world. I can't wait to go back again.,5.0
"There's a LOT of really great pizza in NYC, that's nothing new. But combine amazing pizza with friendly, caring service and a killer ambiance, and Paulie Gee's has a leg up on a lot of the other heavy hitters. The wait can be crazy, but we came in on a Tuesday night and it was half empty. I guess the key is to come when there's post-blizzard sludge everywhere and no one else wants to go out. Paulie Gee was there as I'm told he usually is, weaving around the space with his cup of coffee and stopping at literally every table. For us, he offered to curate our pizza order and who were we to argue? Read on for what Paulie Gee himself recommends:- The Greenpointer: according to Paulie, basically like eating a salad due to the piles of fresh baby arugula on top. - The Mo Cheeks: My personal favorite of the meal. The pickled onions on there are a nice surprise, and give a nice kick to the rest of the ingredients. - The Monte Cristo: OK, so this is probably something I would never think to order myself, but I'm glad it came out for us because it's actually super tasty. It comes with Canadian bacon and a drizzle of maple syrup, which I know sounds weird but trust me (or rather, trust Paulie). - I didn't catch the name of the last pizza, but it was one of the best and after peeking at the menu again I think it might have been the Hellboy. It was piled high with the tastiest Berkshire Sopressata, and it was perfect with the side of Mike's hot honey (which you haven't tried on pizza you must immediately). They asked if we wanted a dessert pizza but at that point we were stuffed to the gills. It was one of the best New York pizza experiences I've had so far, and the service is what really puts them above and beyond. I'm going to run for vice-president of the Paulie Gee fanclub soon!",5.0
"Came here a few days ago with my friend after work. Very dark inside, took some time for my eyeballs to adjust lol. We started off with some beers and then went with the Hellboy which was AMAZING. The hot honey makes a difference! Then we went with a vegan pie since neither one of us was particularly full. We ordered one with spinach, sea salt and garlic on it (sorry don't remember the name!) It was OK, not that memorable. The standout is by far Hellboy, the crust for both pizzas was SUPER THIN, firm and didn't fall apart on me. We both liked it. I took off a star for the spinach pie being nothing special and that it's a bit on the pricey side. Overall, I think I'll be back to try the other pizzas on the menu!",4.0
"Maybe we came on an off night, but we didn't care too much about the pizza and it was definitely not the best we've had. My friend wanted to celebrate her belated birthday at Paulie Gee's and so we did. We ordered 3 pies (Greenpointer, Ricotta Be Kidding Me, and The Hometown Brisket). I think the Hometown Brisket was our favorite only because of the BBQ sauce. Other than that, there wasn't much brisket pieces on the pizza. Ricotta Be Kidding Me was okay. The Greenpointer was all greens so that balanced our meal a little bit. I hear people waiting for hours to get a seat here and right now I'm just wondering where all the hype went? We came when they were opening, so thank goodness we didn't wait on line for this...cause it wouldn't have been worth it. FYI: There's no sign outside that says ""Paulie Gee's"". You just have to look by the address number ""60"" in order to find this place. I actually walked passed it while we were trying to find it. Also, use your flash on your phones to read the menu. I really liked the rustic interior but it was literally pitch black in there.",3.0
"Zagat rated the hellboy as the best pizza in NYC. Wow! Big call Zagat... We had to try! We would say it was delicious... But I would have to say Marta is equal of not just ahead. We got here at 6:40 and had to wait over an hr to sit at the bar. When getting here service was prompt and food was great! We ordered the hellboy and the hellified porkpie white and I have to say it was fresh, full of flavor and great value. My only critique would be more hot suppressa on the hellified and take numbers at the door! It's a little unreasonable to ask people to wait 90 mins and not offer to call when table it ready. Either way it was great but probably won't be crossing the river to wait another 90 mins.",4.0
"If there was ever a restaurant that inspires the need for #PiDay (3.14) to be everyday, it is Paulie Gee's. The pizza is a true art, and every bite is important, from the center to the crust crust.  PG is located in pizza heaven, or right near the water on Greenpoint Ave if you want a Google Map friendly address.Read it on my blog: highclasstohighlifes.com…As you'll see below I'm constantly on the proscuitt of happiness but this time we went for a different ham, Canadian bacon, and on the Monte Cristo. You bet it counted towards happiness. This pizza combines maple syrup drizzle and gouda with the ham. Yes, yes and more yes. Paulie asked if we had butter on the crust...sadly, no. SO MUCH REGRET....that I'll be back in no time to try it. You'll notice on the menu that they have a brisket pizza that features Hometown BBQ -- I love this local BK collaboration. You can get sauced the other way too with Greenpoint local brews!Anyway, I have nearly eaten my way through the entire menu (still need to do a bit of adventuring on the vegan side, every time I get close, I just want meat...) and I have been very pleased with every slice thus far. Therefore my advice to you is go with the pizza that's toppings are most appealing...or grab a handful of friends and share, then you can try multiple pizzas!The man, who is not a myth, but definitely a legend is often found inside checking in on tables, ensuring quality control and getting to know the patrons. He loved my last Instagram post that did a little play words...sharing that I was on the prosciutt of happiness with his King Henry Classic. He's always all smiles and usually wearing a great hat, he is Paulie Gee himself. Paulie Gee's - High Class to High Lifes If you really knead to get delivery or pickup, you'll have to look elsewhere for now though. The only way to leave Paulie Gee's with a to-go box is with leftovers. Rumor has it that a slice joint is opening up nearby though! I'm counting down the days, hours and minutes. Want to keep drooling? Read the menu!Pro Tip: Grab dinner at Paulie Gee's then walk straight out on the water in Greenpoint to Transmitter park or the outlook. Maybe even catch a sunset and BYO night cap!",5.0
"My old pal Carlos and I visited Paulie Gee's last night and had a great meal. I'm accustomed to going with the ol' vegan girlfriend and have a tradition where we split two pies from their extensive vegan selection, so we can try two different types of pies. The vegan and non-vegan selections are both extensive; each category has at least a half dozen kinds of pies, including oil bases, white slices, marinara, spinach-based, spicy honey and barbecue sauce foundations. The pies are aesthetically pleasing to every sense, well, every sense except sound. It's usually better when sound isn't a factor. At least when you're talking about food. When you're talking about music, sound is obviously a very important sense to talk about. I may go as far as to say that in a conversation about music, sound is the only sense that matters.I was excited to go with Carlos because I was going to get to eat their meat and actual cheese. The Paulie Gee's brisket is lean and delicious. Their pickled red onions possess a truly memorable tang and are worth spending a couple buck to add on to pretty much any pie. The ricotta dollops on the Ricky Ricotta feel more like bursts of a cream sauce than regular old cheese. Interestingly, the dairy and non-dairy ricotta cheeses are almost indecipherable in quality, which goes to show that Paulie Gee's knows what's up. Carlos and I were pleased to compliment the trad Italian flavors of the Ricky Ricotta with a tangy Barbecue Brisket pie. I'm psyched to go with a fellow omnivore again, because there are tons of other flavor combos I'm eager to try. New Yorkers, such as myself, are notorious for being dicks about the quality of pizza dough. It's the dough that invalidates the Chicago Deep Dish's false aspiration to pizza status. I can't stand Sicilian pizza either, which is a controversial take in Nueva York. Anyhow, no matter how well adorned a Paulie Gee's pie is, its base--the crust--is its most distinct and wonderful element. The crust is thin but springy, and always a little charred. It's pretty much naan bread, which is either a very luck coincidence or a visionary innovation. Naan bread, as you know, is lit, and, as it turns out, it is the perfect surface upon which various pizza ingredients should be placed and/or spread to mingle harmoniously.I've visited Paulie Gee's a number of times, and there's a bit of narrative that forms around my visits. The first time I tried to go, it was around noon, and my gf and I made the unpleasant discovery that Paulie Gee's does not open til 5 PM. The next time, we rolled up in a deep crew of six and had to wait about two to three hours for a table for six. If you find yourself in that position, you'll be okay though because there are plenty of bars around. There's also the water/skyline, mere yards away and a nice record store a block away.The gf and I have gone a few other times and it's always been great--except for the one time that a camera crew was shooting a special on Paulie Gee's vegan options.

"New York probably takes its pizza more seriously than anywhere else in the world.  I'm sure there are 7 or 8 people reading this right now that would be willing to shiv a guy for saying something bad about their favorite slice.  With that in mind, Paulie Gee's is a pizza lover's pizza place.  They make Neapolitan style pizzas with an oven shipped in from Naples and lovingly reassembled by small, Italian elves.  From this oven, comes perfectly leopard-spotted pizzas with just the right amount of bouncy chewy dough.To top the pizza, there's a lovingly curated selection to choose from so don't you dare ask for substitutions.  Lucky for you whether you're a vegan, vegetarian, white/red pie lover, averse to spice, meat lover, or whatever!  There's at least one pie on the menu* that will make you say, ""hmmm..."".  My personal favorites are the Mo' Cheeks ($16, has guanciale and is perfect with the pickled onions) and Ricotta Be Kidding Me ($17, with tons of meat topped with adorable dollops of cottage cheese).  I've only ever had 1 pizza there that wasn't stellar and I won't tell you which one because you'll definitely judge me for choosing it in the first place.The atmosphere at Paulie Gee's is great.  It's quintessential Brooklyn.  Think dark unfinished wood walls with an eclectic collection of tables made from reclaimed wood, music consisting of a mixture of jazz, rock, and anything but top 40s.  What always makes my night is that the ACTUAL Paulie Gee walks around and talks to EVERYONE.  It doesn't matter if Keri Russell** is sitting right next to you, he will still come by and have a 5-20 minute conversation with you and your table.  My only complaint is how popular this place is.  They've stopped making pizzas to go and still, the wait is crazy.  I've never been able to get a table in less than 45 minutes unless it was late at night.  I guess that's not a bad problem to have.  I also kind of wish they would get a full liquor license and take that creative pizza combo creating mind into the cocktail realm.  I mean...Mike's Hot Honey + Whiskey?  Maybe?---------* If you can't find a pizza you like on the printed menu in the restaurant, whip out the smartphone and check out the ""secret"" menu on the website.** This actually happened.",4.0

"Some of the best za in the city, bar none. The lady and I traveled far and wide for it since we'd heard such great things. It was a Friday night so the restaurant was predictably packed. There's not much in the form of a waiting area, which particularly sucked given how freezing the weather was, but we had a feeling the pie would be well worth the wait (plus we also got to watch a tipsy couple aggressively suck face up close and personal which was an unexpected but enjoyable twist).The vibe was cool, featuring low--lighting, a huge and beautiful custom brick oven, and trendy attractive people who's favorite bands you've never heard of.When we finally were seated I was stoked to see the menu offered a huge variety of pies with all sorts of niche toppings AND vegan options(I personally don't give two damns about veganism but they presented them in an unpretentious way so I was cool with it).

"After a 2-hours wait on a weekend for a party of 2, we finally got a table at the renowned pizza shop in Brooklyn. After having one of the best pizzas of all time at Little Isabella located in Baltimore, I was on the mission to find its companion in NYC. Overhyped as we suspected, Paulie Gee had nothing on Little Isabella! Perhaps, it was the quirky blend of sweet and savory flavors, but with that 2-hour wait, we surely did not have a pleasing experience.We ordered two pies: HellBoy and Greenpointer. HellBoy: Fresh Mozzarella, Italian Tomatoes, Berkshire Sopressata Piccante, Parmigiano Reggiano and Mike's HOT HoneyGreenpointer:Fresh Mozzarella, Baby Arugula, Olive Oil, Fresh Lemon Juice and Shaved Parmigiano ReggianoWe didn't really enjoy the sweetness of the honey in the HellBoy or the sourness of the lemon juice in the Greenpointer. Fresh, as we saw them make each pie to order, I definitely thought the doughiness of the pizza wasn't anything spectacular. In terms of service, I think it was pretty solid. Our waiter was patient and helpful. As a surprise, Paulie Gee himself introduced himself to just about every table, making it feel quite personable. In all, I definitely wouldn't return back to this pizzeria, especially with that crazy wait. During that 2-hour wait and 1.5-hour dining time, I can drive down to Baltimore and get some Little Isabella for half the price and no wait!",3.0
"3.5 stars for this pizza joint hidden behind a HUGE wooden door all the way down Franklin streetCrust was good with a nice char on the hellboy but the crust of the greenpoint pizza seemed a bit underdone We were quoted a 1.5 hour wait at 8pm for 3 on a Saturday but we were lucky that people in front of us hadn't returned so we were seated right away! (so don't be discouraged)---hellboy: everything was good about this except that spicy honey! Should of gone with a more classic margherita style pizza instead---greenpoint: fresh arugula, with a bit too much lemon juice, so nothing special NOTE: they don't have pepper flakes, only chili oil",4.0
"If you want great pizza and the right atmosphere look no further than Paulie Gee's. We sat at the bar (luckily) and avoided a two hour wait.  The pizza choices are numerous, with some very creative options. There were three of us and we started with two pies. Would have been content but it was so good we ordered a third.The texture. The crust. The toppings. Hard pressed to mention anything I didn't like. I love pizza and this place is right up there with the best. That includes many pizzerias throughout Italy.Paulie stopped by for a chat and he has a fantastic personality. Great stories and it is obvious that he loves what he does and holds him team to very high standards.He was also kind enough to give me an official Paulie Gee's pin and a limoncello. A very nice touch!Make sure you check out the pizza oven in the back. It's a small,cozy place so don't pass this place up in you are in NY.",5.0
I take my pizza very seriously. The vegan pizza is so good here that if they didn't tell you it was vegan you would have no clue. I had the pie with vegan sausage and shared a few others with friends. It was all out of this world. I can't wait to go back again.,5.0
"There's a LOT of really great pizza in NYC, that's nothing new. But combine amazing pizza with friendly, caring service and a killer ambiance, and Paulie Gee's has a leg up on a lot of the other heavy hitters. The wait can be crazy, but we came in on a Tuesday night and it was half empty. I guess the key is to come when there's post-blizzard sludge everywhere and no one else wants to go out. Paulie Gee was there as I'm told he usually is, weaving around the space with his cup of coffee and stopping at literally every table. For us, he offered to curate our pizza order and who were we to argue? Read on for what Paulie Gee himself recommends:- The Greenpointer: according to Paulie, basically like eating a salad due to the piles of fresh baby arugula on top. - The Mo Cheeks: My personal favorite of the meal. The pickled onions on there are a nice surprise, and give a nice kick to the rest of the ingredients. - The Monte Cristo: OK, so this is probably something I would never think to order myself, but I'm glad it came out for us because it's actually super tasty. It comes with Canadian bacon and a drizzle of maple syrup, which I know sounds weird but trust me (or rather, trust Paulie). - I didn't catch the name of the last pizza, but it was one of the best and after peeking at the menu again I think it might have been the Hellboy. It was piled high with the tastiest Berkshire Sopressata, and it was perfect with the side of Mike's hot honey (which you haven't tried on pizza you must immediately). They asked if we wanted a dessert pizza but at that point we were stuffed to the gills. It was one of the best New York pizza experiences I've had so far, and the service is what really puts them above and beyond. I'm going to run for vice-president of the Paulie Gee fanclub soon!",5.0
"Came here a few days ago with my friend after work. Very dark inside, took some time for my eyeballs to adjust lol. We started off with some beers and then went with the Hellboy which was AMAZING. The hot honey makes a difference! Then we went with a vegan pie since neither one of us was particularly full. We ordered one with spinach, sea salt and garlic on it (sorry don't remember the name!) It was OK, not that memorable. The standout is by far Hellboy, the crust for both pizzas was SUPER THIN, firm and didn't fall apart on me. We both liked it. I took off a star for the spinach pie being nothing special and that it's a bit on the pricey side. Overall, I think I'll be back to try the other pizzas on the menu!",4.0
"Maybe we came on an off night, but we didn't care too much about the pizza and it was definitely not the best we've had. My friend wanted to celebrate her belated birthday at Paulie Gee's and so we did. We ordered 3 pies (Greenpointer, Ricotta Be Kidding Me, and The Hometown Brisket). I think the Hometown Brisket was our favorite only because of the BBQ sauce. Other than that, there wasn't much brisket pieces on the pizza. Ricotta Be Kidding Me was okay. The Greenpointer was all greens so that balanced our meal a little bit. I hear people waiting for hours to get a seat here and right now I'm just wondering where all the hype went? We came when they were opening, so thank goodness we didn't wait on line for this...cause it wouldn't have been worth it. FYI: There's no sign outside that says ""Paulie Gee's"". You just have to look by the address number ""60"" in order to find this place. I actually walked passed it while we were trying to find it. Also, use your flash on your phones to read the menu. I really liked the rustic interior but it was literally pitch black in there.",3.0
"Zagat rated the hellboy as the best pizza in NYC. Wow! Big call Zagat... We had to try! We would say it was delicious... But I would have to say Marta is equal of not just ahead. We got here at 6:40 and had to wait over an hr to sit at the bar. When getting here service was prompt and food was great! We ordered the hellboy and the hellified porkpie white and I have to say it was fresh, full of flavor and great value. My only critique would be more hot suppressa on the hellified and take numbers at the door! It's a little unreasonable to ask people to wait 90 mins and not offer to call when table it ready. Either way it was great but probably won't be crossing the river to wait another 90 mins.",4.0
"If there was ever a restaurant that inspires the need for #PiDay (3.14) to be everyday, it is Paulie Gee's. The pizza is a true art, and every bite is important, from the center to the crust crust.  PG is located in pizza heaven, or right near the water on Greenpoint Ave if you want a Google Map friendly address.Read it on my blog: highclasstohighlifes.com…As you'll see below I'm constantly on the proscuitt of happiness but this time we went for a different ham, Canadian bacon, and on the Monte Cristo. You bet it counted towards happiness. This pizza combines maple syrup drizzle and gouda with the ham. Yes, yes and more yes. Paulie asked if we had butter on the crust...sadly, no. SO MUCH REGRET....that I'll be back in no time to try it. You'll notice on the menu that they have a brisket pizza that features Hometown BBQ -- I love this local BK collaboration. You can get sauced the other way too with Greenpoint local brews!Anyway, I have nearly eaten my way through the entire menu (still need to do a bit of adventuring on the vegan side, every time I get close, I just want meat...) and I have been very pleased with every slice thus far. Therefore my advice to you is go with the pizza that's toppings are most appealing...or grab a handful of friends and share, then you can try multiple pizzas!The man, who is not a myth, but definitely a legend is often found inside checking in on tables, ensuring quality control and getting to know the patrons. He loved my last Instagram post that did a little play words...sharing that I was on the prosciutt of happiness with his King Henry Classic. He's always all smiles and usually wearing a great hat, he is Paulie Gee himself. Paulie Gee's - High Class to High Lifes If you really knead to get delivery or pickup, you'll have to look elsewhere for now though. The only way to leave Paulie Gee's with a to-go box is with leftovers. Rumor has it that a slice joint is opening up nearby though! I'm counting down the days, hours and minutes. Want to keep drooling? Read the menu!Pro Tip: Grab dinner at Paulie Gee's then walk straight out on the water in Greenpoint to Transmitter park or the outlook. Maybe even catch a sunset and BYO night cap!",5.0
"My old pal Carlos and I visited Paulie Gee's last night and had a great meal. I'm accustomed to going with the ol' vegan girlfriend and have a tradition where we split two pies from their extensive vegan selection, so we can try two different types of pies. The vegan and non-vegan selections are both extensive; each category has at least a half dozen kinds of pies, including oil bases, white slices, marinara, spinach-based, spicy honey and barbecue sauce foundations. The pies are aesthetically pleasing to every sense, well, every sense except sound. It's usually better when sound isn't a factor. At least when you're talking about food. When you're talking about music, sound is obviously a very important sense to talk about. I may go as far as to say that in a conversation about music, sound is the only sense that matters.I was excited to go with Carlos because I was going to get to eat their meat and actual cheese. The Paulie Gee's brisket is lean and delicious. Their pickled red onions possess a truly memorable tang and are worth spending a couple buck to add on to pretty much any pie. The ricotta dollops on the Ricky Ricotta feel more like bursts of a cream sauce than regular old cheese. Interestingly, the dairy and non-dairy ricotta cheeses are almost indecipherable in quality, which goes to show that Paulie Gee's knows what's up. Carlos and I were pleased to compliment the trad Italian flavors of the Ricky Ricotta with a tangy Barbecue Brisket pie. I'm psyched to go with a fellow omnivore again, because there are tons of other flavor combos I'm eager to try. New Yorkers, such as myself, are notorious for being dicks about the quality of pizza dough. It's the dough that invalidates the Chicago Deep Dish's false aspiration to pizza status. I can't stand Sicilian pizza either, which is a controversial take in Nueva York. Anyhow, no matter how well adorned a Paulie Gee's pie is, its base--the crust--is its most distinct and wonderful element. The crust is thin but springy, and always a little charred. It's pretty much naan bread, which is either a very luck coincidence or a visionary innovation. Naan bread, as you know, is lit, and, as it turns out, it is the perfect surface upon which various pizza ingredients should be placed and/or spread to mingle harmoniously.I've visited Paulie Gee's a number of times, and there's a bit of narrative that forms around my visits. The first time I tried to go, it was around noon, and my gf and I made the unpleasant discovery that Paulie Gee's does not open til 5 PM. The next time, we rolled up in a deep crew of six and had to wait about two to three hours for a table for six. If you find yourself in that position, you'll be okay though because there are plenty of bars around. There's also the water/skyline, mere yards away and a nice record store a block away.The gf and I have gone a few other times and it's always been great--except for the one time that a camera crew was shooting a special on Paulie Gee's vegan options. My girlfriend and I were in the shot all throughout our meal, and we were fighting (as subtly as possible) for the duration of our meal. I was taken aback and somewhat miffed when the producers of the show asked to do a talking head with us outside. The tension was palpable but they still insisted on interviewing us. I really do believe that you should foot the bill if you're going to interview someone for your television series or web series or gratuitously long Yelp review or whatever. At LEAST commission me to write a song for the soundtrack.In closing, I would like to offer a lil sum sum for the ladies. Are you interested in grandfatherly, charmingly blue collar, short men whose personalities closely resemble those of most Robert De Niro characters--but only in David O. Russel movies? If you do, and might want to be possibly hit on by a man of this caliber, you will love Paulie Gee's. At all times, Paulie Gee's eponymous Pizza Architect and Entrepreneur, Paulie Gee, stalks the narrow spaces between tables, checking in with customers--particularly of the reasonably attractive female demographic--and asks them how their food is, making small talk and thanking them for their patronage. I think this is cool. I would do the same if I were in his position, so don't take this the wrong way. Central to Paulie Gee's game is his ability to recommend a pizza place in seemingly every zip code on the planet and his inclination to tell you (the lady in question) the name of the dude who works there/owns the place, and to tell you (still the lady in question) to tell the dude (who owns the pizza place) to say that he (Paulie Gee) says hi. The Brotherhood of Pizza Mans is truly alive and well.",5.0

"I almost feel like it's blasphemy for not giving 5 stars. Finally made my way over here at Paulie Gees after way too long. Clearly this place is GPs staple so was excited to drop by on Wednesday night.There was no wait- very good. I had been worried about this so called 3x around 6:45pm to see how long it was before heading over. No one picked up and their answering service basically hangs up on you. I ordered the Daniela and he ordered the brisket pizza. Mine came out a good 7 minutes before his. I noticed immediately that about 40% of the crust was charred to the point of being inedible. To top that off, the spinach topping my pizza was the same. It was literally a black piece of ash and when I picked a leaf up or crumbled in my hands. The cheese blend was very good (mozzarella and Parmesan) but the pizza was just not good. To top it off, parts of the center were soggy and didn't hold the toppings when I grabbed a slice. When the brisket pizza came out a few minutes later I noticed immediately that it was cooked perfectly. The crust was edible and delicious. I was bummed that mine didn't come out this way especially since it seemed like a classic. All I can say is they probably put our orders in together and maybe his needed a little longer in the oven. Mine was most likely getting over cooked while his needed a few more minutes. Hence the gap in time between both of our orders coming out and the reason why mine was half done by the time his came out.I was really disappointed but the good thing to know is at least the brisket pizza was cooked well. I know there is a good meal at Paulie Gees but I feel like we were jipped.Also, great touch that Paulie himself came in to greet all the diners. He was super friendly and it brings a family quality to the place. This is maybe one of the main reasons I'd come back.",3.0
"Delicious!! Definitely made my top 3 favorite pizza  places (the others being robertas and best pizza). We've been meaning to come forever but the line is always so long. We were finally seated right away on a Friday night because we ran over as soon as they opened at 6pm. I would highly recommend this tactic to those of you who have been meaning to come and haven't been able to due to the wait -- the food will be worth it. We ordered the hellboy, ricotta be kidding me and the hot honey ice cream Sunday for dessert. The hellboy was our fave. It was basically a pepperoni pizza with hot honey lined under the cheese. I liked it more than the bees sting from Robertas but both are very good. All in all would highly recommend. As an extra plus Paulie Gee was hanging around today,though it seems like he does this quite often, going from table to table talking to the customers.",5.0
"My husband and I visited Paulie Gee's about two years ago and he still dreams of the Hellboy. This time we ordered the Hellboy and Cherry Jones.  The Hellboy was great but just a touch too sweet for me.  The hot honey adds a little kick but is definitely not too hot.  My husband will tell you it is the best pizza he has ever had (saying a lot since he was raised in the Bronx).  The Cherry Jones on the other hand was way too sweet for both of us.  I couldn't taste anything other then honey.  My husband embarrassed me by telling the waitress we didn't like it.  She offered us a replacement.  We ordered the Ricky Ricotta.  It was alright.  I was shocked because the ricotta was not warm.  The crust at Paulie Gee's is the perfect texture.  However, two of our three pizzas were too charred for my taste.  I must mention Paulie walks around all the tables to make sure everyone is enjoying.  Love it!  The restaurant is too dark and loud for my taste.",3.0
"Interesting decor, super dark inside and it was hard to read the menu. We were seated under one of the speakers, so I felt like an old person complaining about how loud the music was, but really, we came for the food. Split a salad and a Greenpointer pie, and neither disappointed. Both were served quickly, and the pie just exploded with flavor. The lemon kick was strong but not overwhelming, and the crust was perfection. Service was attentive, friendly, and efficient. Lots of menu choices for anything your palate is craving. Overall, a very good experience, and one I would look forward to enjoying again.",4.0

I take my pizza very seriously. The vegan pizza is so good here that if they didn't tell you it was vegan you would have no clue. I had the pie with vegan sausage and shared a few others with friends. It was all out of this world. I can't wait to go back again.,5.0
"There's a LOT of really great pizza in NYC, that's nothing new. But combine amazing pizza with friendly, caring service and a killer ambiance, and Paulie Gee's has a leg up on a lot of the other heavy hitters. The wait can be crazy, but we came in on a Tuesday night and it was half empty. I guess the key is to come when there's post-blizzard sludge everywhere and no one else wants to go out. Paulie Gee was there as I'm told he usually is, weaving around the space with his cup of coffee and stopping at literally every table. For us, he offered to curate our pizza order and who were we to argue? Read on for what Paulie Gee himself recommends:- The Greenpointer: according to Paulie, basically like eating a salad due to the piles of fresh baby arugula on top. - The Mo Cheeks: My personal favorite of the meal. The pickled onions on there are a nice surprise, and give a nice kick to the rest of the ingredients. - The Monte Cristo: OK, so this is probably something I would never think to order myself, but I'm glad it came out for us because it's actually super tasty. It comes with Canadian bacon and a drizzle of maple syrup, which I know sounds weird but trust me (or rather, trust Paulie). - I didn't catch the name of the last pizza, but it was one of the best and after peeking at the menu again I think it might have been the Hellboy. It was piled high with the tastiest Berkshire Sopressata, and it was perfect with the side of Mike's hot honey (which you haven't tried on pizza you must immediately). They asked if we wanted a dessert pizza but at that point we were stuffed to the gills. It was one of the best New York pizza experiences I've had so far, and the service is what really puts them above and beyond. I'm going to run for vice-president of the Paulie Gee fanclub soon!",5.0

It was OK, not that memorable. The standout is by far Hellboy, the crust for both pizzas was SUPER THIN, firm and didn't fall apart on me. We both liked it.

My friend wanted to celebrate her belated birthday at Paulie Gee's and so we did. We ordered 3 pies (Greenpointer, Ricotta Be Kidding Me, and The Hometown Brisket). I think the Hometown Brisket was our favorite only because of the BBQ sauce. Other than that, there wasn't much brisket pieces on the pizza. Ricotta Be Kidding Me was okay. The Greenpointer was all greens so that balanced our meal a little bit. I hear people waiting for hours to get a seat here and right now I'm just wondering where all the hype went? We came when they were opening, so thank goodness we didn't wait on line for this...cause it wouldn't have been worth it. FYI: There's no sign outside that says ""Paulie Gee's"".

"My old pal Carlos and I visited Paulie Gee's last night and had a great meal. I'm accustomed to going with the ol' vegan girlfriend and have a tradition where we split two pies from their extensive vegan selection, so we can try two different types of pies. The vegan and non-vegan selections are both extensive; each category has at least a half dozen kinds of pies, including oil bases, white slices, marinara, spinach-based, spicy honey and barbecue sauce foundations. The pies are aesthetically pleasing to every sense, well, every sense except sound. It's usually better when sound isn't a factor. At least when you're talking about food. When you're talking about music, sound is obviously a very important sense to talk about. I may go as far as to say that in a conversation about music, sound is the only sense that matters.I was excited to go with Carlos because I was going to get to eat their meat and actual cheese. The Paulie Gee's brisket is lean and delicious. Their pickled red onions possess a truly memorable tang and are worth spending a couple buck to add on to pretty much any pie. The ricotta dollops on the Ricky Ricotta feel more like bursts of a cream sauce than regular old cheese. Interestingly, the dairy and non-dairy ricotta cheeses are almost indecipherable in quality, which goes to show that Paulie Gee's knows what's up. Carlos and I were pleased to compliment the trad Italian flavors of the Ricky Ricotta with a tangy Barbecue Brisket pie. I'm psyched to go with a fellow omnivore again, because there are tons of other flavor combos I'm eager to try. New Yorkers, such as myself, are notorious for being dicks about the quality of pizza dough. It's the dough that invalidates the Chicago Deep Dish's false aspiration to pizza status. I can't stand Sicilian pizza either, which is a controversial take in Nueva York. Anyhow, no matter how well adorned a Paulie Gee's pie is, its base--the crust--is its most distinct and wonderful element. The crust is thin but springy, and always a little charred. It's pretty much naan bread, which is either a very luck coincidence or a visionary innovation. Naan bread, as you know, is lit, and, as it turns out, it is the perfect surface upon which various pizza ingredients should be placed and/or spread to mingle harmoniously.I've visited Paulie Gee's a number of times, and there's a bit of narrative that forms around my visits. The first time I tried to go, it was around noon, and my gf and I made the unpleasant discovery that Paulie Gee's does not open til 5 PM. The next time, we rolled up in a deep crew of six and had to wait about two to three hours for a table for six. If you find yourself in that position, you'll be okay though because there are plenty of bars around. There's also the water/skyline, mere yards away and a nice record store a block away.The gf and I have gone a few other times and it's always been great--except for the one time that a camera crew was shooting a special on Paulie Gee's vegan options. My girlfriend and I were in the shot all throughout our meal, and we were fighting (as subtly as possible) for the duration of our meal. I was taken aback and somewhat miffed when the producers of the show asked to do a talking head with us outside. The tension was palpable but they still insisted on interviewing us. I really do believe that you should foot the bill if you're going to interview someone for your television series or web series or gratuitously long Yelp review or whatever. At LEAST commission me to write a song for the soundtrack.In closing, I would like to offer a lil sum sum for the ladies. Are you interested in grandfatherly, charmingly blue collar, short men whose personalities closely resemble those of most Robert De Niro characters--but only in David O. Russel movies? If you do, and might want to be possibly hit on by a man of this caliber, you will love Paulie Gee's. At all times, Paulie Gee's eponymous Pizza Architect and Entrepreneur, Paulie Gee, stalks the narrow spaces between tables, checking in with customers--particularly of the reasonably attractive female demographic--and asks them how their food is, making small talk and thanking them for their patronage. I think this is cool. I would do the same if I were in his position, so don't take this the wrong way. Central to Paulie Gee's game is his ability to recommend a pizza place in seemingly every zip code on the planet and his inclination to tell you (the lady in question) the name of the dude who works there/owns the place, and to tell you (still the lady in question) to tell the dude (who owns the pizza place) to say that he (Paulie Gee) says hi. The Brotherhood of Pizza Mans is truly alive and well.",5.0

"I almost feel like it's blasphemy for not giving 5 stars. Finally made my way over here at Paulie Gees after way too long. Clearly this place is GPs staple so was excited to drop by on Wednesday night.There was no wait- very good. I had been worried about this so called 3x around 6:45pm to see how long it was before heading over. No one picked up and their answering service basically hangs up on you. I ordered the Daniela and he ordered the brisket pizza. Mine came out a good 7 minutes before his. I noticed immediately that about 40% of the crust was charred to the point of being inedible. To top that off, the spinach topping my pizza was the same. It was literally a black piece of ash and when I picked a leaf up or crumbled in my hands. The cheese blend was very good (mozzarella and Parmesan) but the pizza was just not good. To top it off, parts of the center were soggy and didn't hold the toppings when I grabbed a slice. When the brisket pizza came out a few minutes later I noticed immediately that it was cooked perfectly. The crust was edible and delicious. I was bummed that mine didn't come out this way especially since it seemed like a classic. All I can say is they probably put our orders in together and maybe his needed a little longer in the oven. Mine was most likely getting over cooked while his needed a few more minutes. Hence the gap in time between both of our orders coming out and the reason why mine was half done by the time his came out.I was really disappointed but the good thing to know is at least the brisket pizza was cooked well. I know there is a good meal at Paulie Gees but I feel like we were jipped.Also, great touch that Paulie himself came in to greet all the diners. He was super friendly and it brings a family quality to the place. This is maybe one of the main reasons I'd come back.",3.0
"Delicious!! Definitely made my top 3 favorite pizza  places (the others being robertas and best pizza). We've been meaning to come forever but the line is always so long. We were finally seated right away on a Friday night because we ran over as soon as they opened at 6pm. I would highly recommend this tactic to those of you who have been meaning to come and haven't been able to due to the wait -- the food will be worth it. We ordered the hellboy, ricotta be kidding me and the hot honey ice cream Sunday for dessert. The hellboy was our fave. It was basically a pepperoni pizza with hot honey lined under the cheese. I liked it more than the bees sting from Robertas but both are very good. All in all would highly recommend. As an extra plus Paulie Gee was hanging around today,though it seems like he does this quite often, going from table to table talking to the customers.",5.0
"My husband and I visited Paulie Gee's about two years ago and he still dreams of the Hellboy. This time we ordered the Hellboy and Cherry Jones.  The Hellboy was great but just a touch too sweet for me.  The hot honey adds a little kick but is definitely not too hot.  My husband will tell you it is the best pizza he has ever had (saying a lot since he was raised in the Bronx).  The Cherry Jones on the other hand was way too sweet for both of us.  I couldn't taste anything other then honey.  My husband embarrassed me by telling the waitress we didn't like it.  She offered us a replacement.  We ordered the Ricky Ricotta.  It was alright.  I was shocked because the ricotta was not warm.  The crust at Paulie Gee's is the perfect texture.  However, two of our three pizzas were too charred for my taste.  I must mention Paulie walks around all the tables to make sure everyone is enjoying.  Love it!  The restaurant is too dark and loud for my taste.",3.0
"Interesting decor, super dark inside and it was hard to read the menu. We were seated under one of the speakers, so I felt like an old person complaining about how loud the music was, but really, we came for the food. Split a salad and a Greenpointer pie, and neither disappointed. Both were served quickly, and the pie just exploded with flavor. The lemon kick was strong but not overwhelming, and the crust was perfection. Service was attentive, friendly, and efficient. Lots of menu choices for anything your palate is craving. Overall, a very good experience, and one I would look forward to enjoying again.",4.0
"New York probably takes its pizza more seriously than anywhere else in the world.  I'm sure there are 7 or 8 people reading this right now that would be willing to shiv a guy for saying something bad about their favorite slice.  With that in mind, Paulie Gee's is a pizza lover's pizza place.  They make Neapolitan style pizzas with an oven shipped in from Naples and lovingly reassembled by small, Italian elves.  From this oven, comes perfectly leopard-spotted pizzas with just the right amount of bouncy chewy dough.To top the pizza, there's a lovingly curated selection to choose from so don't you dare ask for substitutions.  Lucky for you whether you're a vegan, vegetarian, white/red pie lover, averse to spice, meat lover, or whatever!  There's at least one pie on the menu* that will make you say, ""hmmm..."".  My personal favorites are the Mo' Cheeks ($16, has guanciale and is perfect with the pickled onions) and Ricotta Be Kidding Me ($17, with tons of meat topped with adorable dollops of cottage cheese).  I've only ever had 1 pizza there that wasn't stellar and I won't tell you which one because you'll definitely judge me for choosing it in the first place.The atmosphere at Paulie Gee's is great.  It's quintessential Brooklyn.  Think dark unfinished wood walls with an eclectic collection of tables made from reclaimed wood, music consisting of a mixture of jazz, rock, and anything but top 40s.  What always makes my night is that the ACTUAL Paulie Gee walks around and talks to EVERYONE.  It doesn't matter if Keri Russell** is sitting right next to you, he will still come by and have a 5-20 minute conversation with you and your table.  My only complaint is how popular this place is.  They've stopped making pizzas to go and still, the wait is crazy.  I've never been able to get a table in less than 45 minutes unless it was late at night.  I guess that's not a bad problem to have.  I also kind of wish they would get a full liquor license and take that creative pizza combo creating mind into the cocktail realm.  I mean...Mike's Hot Honey + Whiskey?  Maybe?---------* If you can't find a pizza you like on the printed menu in the restaurant, whip out the smartphone and check out the ""secret"" menu on the website.** This actually happened.",4.0
"We've literally flown across the country to enjoy his pizza. It's that good! Walking in, the aroma of pizza cooking in a brick oven hits your nose.This is about time my stomach starts to growl. The vibe is flowing with positive energy, and the low lighting is flattering & sexy. The bar to the left is where you can order a beverage while you wait.  They have a decent beer selection. Wait times vary, but it's usually not as long as anticipated, and well worth the effort.Everyone, including the servers, seem happy to be there.Paulie Gee is the utmost host. He's always found time to come to our table with suggestions, stories, and the occasional limoncello, (his recipe of the celebratory cocktail).Talking with him, I've gathered that he makes the vegan pizza for the people, or demand for it, but he didn't seem interested in the cause.

"Absolutely delicious. Huge selection of pies - good for meatatarians, vegetarians, and even vegans. Wood fire oven delivers the signature light smoke and char. Dough is absolutely tender and springy. They even let the pizza rest afterwards so the cheese sets and you don't burn the crap out of your mouth.Hellboy- spicy pepperoni with hot honey. Absolute classic pizza. Hot honey perfectly blankets the spicy meat. Super simple, absolutely delicious. Get two, trust meRicotta/sausage pie - similar to one above, hot honey included.

"One of the challenges of  being vegan is getting your friends/family to be open to the idea of trying vegan food.I have never had Vegan Pizza before and I usually try to try a restaurant first before recommending to anyone especially a non vegan but I took a chance.When we first arrived we were having trouble picking something since everything was foreign to us. Someone sitting next to us saw our struggle and took us to try the  IN Ricotta Da Vegan so we did. AMAZING!! My non vegan date was impressed and I was so happy.Thanks Paulie Gee for making me looking good Whew! One pie (6 small slices) goes for 16 bucks .

"Some of the best za in the city, bar none. The lady and I traveled far and wide for it since we'd heard such great things. It was a Friday night so the restaurant was predictably packed. There's not much in the form of a waiting area, which particularly sucked given how freezing the weather was, but we had a feeling the pie would be well worth the wait (plus we also got to watch a tipsy couple aggressively suck face up close and personal which was an unexpected but enjoyable twist).The vibe was cool, featuring low--lighting, a huge and beautiful custom brick oven, and trendy attractive people who's favorite bands you've never heard of.When we finally were seated I was stoked to see the menu offered a huge variety of pies with all sorts of niche toppings AND vegan options(I personally don't give two damns about veganism but they presented them in an unpretentious way so I was cool with it). We eventually decided to go with the Hell Boy and the Prokypineapple, both of which were amazing, and I'm looking forward to going back and further chowing my way down the menu.Go here.",5.0
"After a 2-hours wait on a weekend for a party of 2, we finally got a table at the renowned pizza shop in Brooklyn. After having one of the best pizzas of all time at Little Isabella located in Baltimore, I was on the mission to find its companion in NYC. Overhyped as we suspected, Paulie Gee had nothing on Little Isabella! Perhaps, it was the quirky blend of sweet and savory flavors, but with that 2-hour wait, we surely did not have a pleasing experience.We ordered two pies: HellBoy and Greenpointer. HellBoy: Fresh Mozzarella, Italian Tomatoes, Berkshire Sopressata Piccante, Parmigiano Reggiano and Mike's HOT HoneyGreenpointer:Fresh Mozzarella, Baby Arugula, Olive Oil, Fresh Lemon Juice and Shaved Parmigiano ReggianoWe didn't really enjoy the sweetness of the honey in the HellBoy or the sourness of the lemon juice in the Greenpointer. Fresh, as we saw them make each pie to order, I definitely thought the doughiness of the pizza wasn't anything spectacular. In terms of service, I think it was pretty solid. Our waiter was patient and helpful. As a surprise, Paulie Gee himself introduced himself to just about every table, making it feel quite personable. In all, I definitely wouldn't return back to this pizzeria, especially with that crazy wait.

"My old pal Carlos and I visited Paulie Gee's last night and had a great meal. I'm accustomed to going with the ol' vegan girlfriend and have a tradition where we split two pies from their extensive vegan selection, so we can try two different types of pies. The vegan and non-vegan selections are both extensive; each category has at least a half dozen kinds of pies, including oil bases, white slices, marinara, spinach-based, spicy honey and barbecue sauce foundations. The pies are aesthetically pleasing to every sense, well, every sense except sound. It's usually better when sound isn't a factor. At least when you're talking about food. When you're talking about music, sound is obviously a very important sense to talk about. I may go as far as to say that in a conversation about music, sound is the only sense that matters.I was excited to go with Carlos because I was going to get to eat their meat and actual cheese. The Paulie Gee's brisket is lean and delicious. Their pickled red onions possess a truly memorable tang and are worth spending a couple buck to add on to pretty much any pie. The ricotta dollops on the Ricky Ricotta feel more like bursts of a cream sauce than regular old cheese. Interestingly, the dairy and non-dairy ricotta cheeses are almost indecipherable in quality, which goes to show that Paulie Gee's knows what's up. Carlos and I were pleased to compliment the trad Italian flavors of the Ricky Ricotta with a tangy Barbecue Brisket pie. I'm psyched to go with a fellow omnivore again, because there are tons of other flavor combos I'm eager to try. New Yorkers, such as myself, are notorious for being dicks about the quality of pizza dough. It's the dough that invalidates the Chicago Deep Dish's false aspiration to pizza status. I can't stand Sicilian pizza either, which is a controversial take in Nueva York. Anyhow, no matter how well adorned a Paulie Gee's pie is, its base--the crust--is its most distinct and wonderful element. The crust is thin but springy, and always a little charred. It's pretty much naan bread, which is either a very luck coincidence or a visionary innovation. Naan bread, as you know, is lit, and, as it turns out, it is the perfect surface upon which various pizza ingredients should be placed and/or spread to mingle harmoniously.I've visited Paulie Gee's a number of times, and there's a bit of narrative that forms around my visits. The first time I tried to go, it was around noon, and my gf and I made the unpleasant discovery that Paulie Gee's does not open til 5 PM. The next time, we rolled up in a deep crew of six and had to wait about two to three hours for a table for six. If you find yourself in that position, you'll be okay though because there are plenty of bars around. There's also the water/skyline, mere yards away and a nice record store a block away.The gf and I have gone a few other times and it's always been great--except for the one time that a camera crew was shooting a special on Paulie Gee's vegan options. My girlfriend and I were in the shot all throughout our meal, and we were fighting (as subtly as possible) for the duration of our meal. I was taken aback and somewhat miffed when the producers of the show asked to do a talking head with us outside. The tension was palpable but they still insisted on interviewing us. I really do believe that you should foot the bill if you're going to interview someone for your television series or web series or gratuitously long Yelp review or whatever.

"I almost feel like it's blasphemy for not giving 5 stars. Finally made my way over here at Paulie Gees after way too long. Clearly this place is GPs staple so was excited to drop by on Wednesday night.There was no wait- very good. I had been worried about this so called 3x around 6:45pm to see how long it was before heading over. No one picked up and their answering service basically hangs up on you. I ordered the Daniela and he ordered the brisket pizza. Mine came out a good 7 minutes before his. I noticed immediately that about 40% of the crust was charred to the point of being inedible. To top that off, the spinach topping my pizza was the same. It was literally a black piece of ash and when I picked a leaf up or crumbled in my hands. The cheese blend was very good (mozzarella and Parmesan) but the pizza was just not good. To top it off, parts of the center were soggy and didn't hold the toppings when I grabbed a slice. When the brisket pizza came out a few minutes later I noticed immediately that it was cooked perfectly. The crust was edible and delicious. I was bummed that mine didn't come out this way especially since it seemed like a classic. All I can say is they probably put our orders in together and maybe his needed a little longer in the oven. Mine was most likely getting over cooked while his needed a few more minutes. Hence the gap in time between both of our orders coming out and the reason why mine was half done by the time his came out.I was really disappointed but the good thing to know is at least the brisket pizza was cooked well. I know there is a good meal at Paulie Gees but I feel like we were jipped.Also, great touch that Paulie himself came in to greet all the diners. He was super friendly and it brings a family quality to the place. This is maybe one of the main reasons I'd come back.",3.0
"Delicious!! Definitely made my top 3 favorite pizza  places (the others being robertas and best pizza). We've been meaning to come forever but the line is always so long. We were finally seated right away on a Friday night because we ran over as soon as they opened at 6pm. I would highly recommend this tactic to those of you who have been meaning to come and haven't been able to due to the wait -- the food will be worth it. We ordered the hellboy, ricotta be kidding me and the hot honey ice cream Sunday for dessert. The hellboy was our fave. It was basically a pepperoni pizza with hot honey lined under the cheese. I liked it more than the bees sting from Robertas but both are very good. All in all would highly recommend. As an extra plus Paulie Gee was hanging around today,though it seems like he does this quite often, going from table to table talking to the customers.",5.0
"My husband and I visited Paulie Gee's about two years ago and he still dreams of the Hellboy. This time we ordered the Hellboy and Cherry Jones.  The Hellboy was great but just a touch too sweet for me.  The hot honey adds a little kick but is definitely not too hot.  My husband will tell you it is the best pizza he has ever had (saying a lot since he was raised in the Bronx).  The Cherry Jones on the other hand was way too sweet for both of us.  I couldn't taste anything other then honey.  My husband embarrassed me by telling the waitress we didn't like it.  She offered us a replacement.  We ordered the Ricky Ricotta.  It was alright.  I was shocked because the ricotta was not warm.  The crust at Paulie Gee's is the perfect texture.  However, two of our three pizzas were too charred for my taste.  I must mention Paulie walks around all the tables to make sure everyone is enjoying.  Love it!  The restaurant is too dark and loud for my taste.",3.0
"Interesting decor, super dark inside and it was hard to read the menu. We were seated under one of the speakers, so I felt like an old person complaining about how loud the music was, but really, we came for the food. Split a salad and a Greenpointer pie, and neither disappointed. Both were served quickly, and the pie just exploded with flavor. The lemon kick was strong but not overwhelming, and the crust was perfection. Service was attentive, friendly, and efficient. Lots of menu choices for anything your palate is craving. Overall, a very good experience, and one I would look forward to enjoying again.",4.0
"New York probably takes its pizza more seriously than anywhere else in the world.  I'm sure there are 7 or 8 people reading this right now that would be willing to shiv a guy for saying something bad about their favorite slice.  With that in mind, Paulie Gee's is a pizza lover's pizza place.  They make Neapolitan style pizzas with an oven shipped in from Naples and lovingly reassembled by small, Italian elves.  From this oven, comes perfectly leopard-spotted pizzas with just the right amount of bouncy chewy dough.To top the pizza, there's a lovingly curated selection to choose from so don't you dare ask for substitutions.  Lucky for you whether you're a vegan, vegetarian, white/red pie lover, averse to spice, meat lover, or whatever!  There's at least one pie on the menu* that will make you say, ""hmmm..."".  My personal favorites are the Mo' Cheeks ($16, has guanciale and is perfect with the pickled onions) and Ricotta Be Kidding Me ($17, with tons of meat topped with adorable dollops of cottage cheese).  I've only ever had 1 pizza there that wasn't stellar and I won't tell you which one because you'll definitely judge me for choosing it in the first place.The atmosphere at Paulie Gee's is great.  It's quintessential Brooklyn.  Think dark unfinished wood walls with an eclectic collection of tables made from reclaimed wood, music consisting of a mixture of jazz, rock, and anything but top 40s.  What always makes my night is that the ACTUAL Paulie Gee walks around and talks to EVERYONE.  It doesn't matter if Keri Russell** is sitting right next to you, he will still come by and have a 5-20 minute conversation with you and your table.  My only complaint is how popular this place is.  They've stopped making pizzas to go and still, the wait is crazy.  I've never been able to get a table in less than 45 minutes unless it was late at night.  I guess that's not a bad problem to have.  I also kind of wish they would get a full liquor license and take that creative pizza combo creating mind into the cocktail realm.  I mean...Mike's Hot Honey + Whiskey?  Maybe?---------* If you can't find a pizza you like on the printed menu in the restaurant, whip out the smartphone and check out the ""secret"" menu on the website.** This actually happened.",4.0
"We've literally flown across the country to enjoy his pizza. It's that good! Walking in, the aroma of pizza cooking in a brick oven hits your nose.This is about time my stomach starts to growl. The vibe is flowing with positive energy, and the low lighting is flattering & sexy. The bar to the left is where you can order a beverage while you wait.  They have a decent beer selection. Wait times vary, but it's usually not as long as anticipated, and well worth the effort.Everyone, including the servers, seem happy to be there.Paulie Gee is the utmost host. He's always found time to come to our table with suggestions, stories, and the occasional limoncello, (his recipe of the celebratory cocktail).Talking with him, I've gathered that he makes the vegan pizza for the people, or demand for it, but he didn't seem interested in the cause. The funky bathrooms can be a challenge to use when you've had one too many! VEGAN Pies we LOVE Simply RedVegan Tomato Sauce with Tomatoes, Olive Oil. Vidalia Onions, Garlic, Basil, Salt and PepperVegan Daniela SpinaciBaby Spinach, Olive Oil, Fresh Sliced Garlic, Mild Aleppo Chili Oil and Sea SaltIn Ricotta Da VeganVegan Tomato Sauce, House Made Vegan Sausage, Post-oven House Made Cashew Ricotta Dollops, Baby Arugula and Extra Virgin Olive OilWith many return visits, we've yet to have a negative experience.There has been noise over the years of Paulie Giannone opening a Portland outpost, but it has yet to materialize. Meanwhile, I'll dream of his pizza.",5.0
"Absolutely delicious. Huge selection of pies - good for meatatarians, vegetarians, and even vegans. Wood fire oven delivers the signature light smoke and char. Dough is absolutely tender and springy. They even let the pizza rest afterwards so the cheese sets and you don't burn the crap out of your mouth.Hellboy- spicy pepperoni with hot honey. Absolute classic pizza. Hot honey perfectly blankets the spicy meat. Super simple, absolutely delicious. Get two, trust meRicotta/sausage pie - similar to one above, hot honey included. However ricotta and sausage are a welcome addition. While chunks of roasted garlic are an excellent accentSo many other pies, go try them for yourself.Big lines, put your name down and go drink at browerij lane.

"One of the challenges of  being vegan is getting your friends/family to be open to the idea of trying vegan food.I have never had Vegan Pizza before and I usually try to try a restaurant first before recommending to anyone especially a non vegan but I took a chance.When we first arrived we were having trouble picking something since everything was foreign to us. Someone sitting next to us saw our struggle and took us to try the  IN Ricotta Da Vegan so we did. AMAZING!! My non vegan date was impressed and I was so happy.Thanks Paulie Gee for making me looking good Whew! One pie (6 small slices) goes for 16 bucks . Its small, nice ambiance I would say its a little darkI would go again!Menu like here ------ pauliegee.com/greenpoint… xoxoC.",4.0
"Some of the best za in the city, bar none. The lady and I traveled far and wide for it since we'd heard such great things. It was a Friday night so the restaurant was predictably packed. There's not much in the form of a waiting area, which particularly sucked given how freezing the weather was, but we had a feeling the pie would be well worth the wait (plus we also got to watch a tipsy couple aggressively suck face up close and personal which was an unexpected but enjoyable twist).The vibe was cool, featuring low--lighting, a huge and beautiful custom brick oven, and trendy attractive people who's favorite bands you've never heard of.When we finally were seated I was stoked to see the menu offered a huge variety of pies with all sorts of niche toppings AND vegan options(I personally don't give two damns about veganism but they presented them in an unpretentious way so I was cool with it). We eventually decided to go with the Hell Boy and the Prokypineapple, both of which were amazing, and I'm looking forward to going back and further chowing my way down the menu.Go here.",5.0
"After a 2-hours wait on a weekend for a party of 2, we finally got a table at the renowned pizza shop in Brooklyn. After having one of the best pizzas of all time at Little Isabella located in Baltimore, I was on the mission to find its companion in NYC. Overhyped as we suspected, Paulie Gee had nothing on Little Isabella! Perhaps, it was the quirky blend of sweet and savory flavors, but with that 2-hour wait, we surely did not have a pleasing experience.We ordered two pies: HellBoy and Greenpointer. HellBoy: Fresh Mozzarella, Italian Tomatoes, Berkshire Sopressata Piccante, Parmigiano Reggiano and Mike's HOT HoneyGreenpointer:Fresh Mozzarella, Baby Arugula, Olive Oil, Fresh Lemon Juice and Shaved Parmigiano ReggianoWe didn't really enjoy the sweetness of the honey in the HellBoy or the sourness of the lemon juice in the Greenpointer. Fresh, as we saw them make each pie to order, I definitely thought the doughiness of the pizza wasn't anything spectacular. In terms of service, I think it was pretty solid. Our waiter was patient and helpful. As a surprise, Paulie Gee himself introduced himself to just about every table, making it feel quite personable. In all, I definitely wouldn't return back to this pizzeria, especially with that crazy wait. During that 2-hour wait and 1.5-hour dining time, I can drive down to Baltimore and get some Little Isabella for half the price and no wait!",3.0
"3.5 stars for this pizza joint hidden behind a HUGE wooden door all the way down Franklin streetCrust was good with a nice char on the hellboy but the crust of the greenpoint pizza seemed a bit underdone We were quoted a 1.5 hour wait at 8pm for 3 on a Saturday but we were lucky that people in front of us hadn't returned so we were seated right away! (so don't be discouraged)---hellboy: everything was good about this except that spicy honey! Should of gone with a more classic margherita style pizza instead---greenpoint: fresh arugula, with a bit too much lemon juice, so nothing special NOTE: they don't have pepper flakes, only chili oil",4.0
"If you want great pizza and the right atmosphere look no further than Paulie Gee's. We sat at the bar (luckily) and avoided a two hour wait.  The pizza choices are numerous, with some very creative options. There were three of us and we started with two pies. Would have been content but it was so good we ordered a third.The texture. The crust. The toppings. Hard pressed to mention anything I didn't like. I love pizza and this place is right up there with the best. That includes many pizzerias throughout Italy.Paulie stopped by for a chat and he has a fantastic personality. Great stories and it is obvious that he loves what he does and holds him team to very high standards.He was also kind enough to give me an official Paulie Gee's pin and a limoncello. A very nice touch!Make sure you check out the pizza oven in the back. It's a small,cozy place so don't pass this place up in you are in NY.",5.0
I take my pizza very seriously. The vegan pizza is so good here that if they didn't tell you it was vegan you would have no clue. I had the pie with vegan sausage and shared a few others with friends. It was all out of this world. I can't wait to go back again.,5.0
"There's a LOT of really great pizza in NYC, that's nothing new. But combine amazing pizza with friendly, caring service and a killer ambiance, and Paulie Gee's has a leg up on a lot of the other heavy hitters. The wait can be crazy, but we came in on a Tuesday night and it was half empty. I guess the key is to come when there's post-blizzard sludge everywhere and no one else wants to go out. Paulie Gee was there as I'm told he usually is, weaving around the space with his cup of coffee and stopping at literally every table. For us, he offered to curate our pizza order and who were we to argue? Read on for what Paulie Gee himself recommends:- The Greenpointer: according to Paulie, basically like eating a salad due to the piles of fresh baby arugula on top. - The Mo Cheeks: My personal favorite of the meal. The pickled onions on there are a nice surprise, and give a nice kick to the rest of the ingredients. - The Monte Cristo: OK, so this is probably something I would never think to order myself, but I'm glad it came out for us because it's actually super tasty. It comes with Canadian bacon and a drizzle of maple syrup, which I know sounds weird but trust me (or rather, trust Paulie). - I didn't catch the name of the last pizza, but it was one of the best and after peeking at the menu again I think it might have been the Hellboy. It was piled high with the tastiest Berkshire Sopressata, and it was perfect with the side of Mike's hot honey (which you haven't tried on pizza you must immediately). They asked if we wanted a dessert pizza but at that point we were stuffed to the gills. It was one of the best New York pizza experiences I've had so far, and the service is what really puts them above and beyond. I'm going to run for vice-president of the Paulie Gee fanclub soon!",5.0
"Came here a few days ago with my friend after work. Very dark inside, took some time for my eyeballs to adjust lol. We started off with some beers and then went with the Hellboy which was AMAZING. The hot honey makes a difference! Then we went with a vegan pie since neither one of us was particularly full. We ordered one with spinach, sea salt and garlic on it (sorry don't remember the name!) It was OK, not that memorable. The standout is by far Hellboy, the crust for both pizzas was SUPER THIN, firm and didn't fall apart on me. We both liked it. I took off a star for the spinach pie being nothing special and that it's a bit on the pricey side. Overall, I think I'll be back to try the other pizzas on the menu!",4.0
"Maybe we came on an off night, but we didn't care too much about the pizza and it was definitely not the best we've had. My friend wanted to celebrate her belated birthday at Paulie Gee's and so we did. We ordered 3 pies (Greenpointer, Ricotta Be Kidding Me, and The Hometown Brisket). I think the Hometown Brisket was our favorite only because of the BBQ sauce. Other than that, there wasn't much brisket pieces on the pizza. Ricotta Be Kidding Me was okay. The Greenpointer was all greens so that balanced our meal a little bit. I hear people waiting for hours to get a seat here and right now I'm just wondering where all the hype went? We came when they were opening, so thank goodness we didn't wait on line for this...cause it wouldn't have been worth it. FYI: There's no sign outside that says ""Paulie Gee's"". You just have to look by the address number ""60"" in order to find this place. I actually walked passed it while we were trying to find it. Also, use your flash on your phones to read the menu. I really liked the rustic interior but it was literally pitch black in there.",3.0
"Zagat rated the hellboy as the best pizza in NYC. Wow! Big call Zagat... We had to try! We would say it was delicious... But I would have to say Marta is equal of not just ahead. We got here at 6:40 and had to wait over an hr to sit at the bar. When getting here service was prompt and food was great! We ordered the hellboy and the hellified porkpie white and I have to say it was fresh, full of flavor and great value. My only critique would be more hot suppressa on the hellified and take numbers at the door! It's a little unreasonable to ask people to wait 90 mins and not offer to call when table it ready. Either way it was great but probably won't be crossing the river to wait another 90 mins.",4.0

I would highly recommend this tactic to those of you who have been meaning to come and haven't been able to due to the wait -- the food will be worth it. We ordered the hellboy, ricotta be kidding me and the hot honey ice cream Sunday for dessert. The hellboy was our fave. It was basically a pepperoni pizza with hot honey lined under the cheese.

"My husband and I visited Paulie Gee's about two years ago and he still dreams of the Hellboy. This time we ordered the Hellboy and Cherry Jones.  The Hellboy was great but just a touch too sweet for me.  The hot honey adds a little kick but is definitely not too hot.  My husband will tell you it is the best pizza he has ever had (saying a lot since he was raised in the Bronx).  The Cherry Jones on the other hand was way too sweet for both of us.  I couldn't taste anything other then honey.  My husband embarrassed me by telling the waitress we didn't like it.  She offered us a replacement.  We ordered the Ricky Ricotta.  It was alright.  I was shocked because the ricotta was not warm.  The crust at Paulie Gee's is the perfect texture.  However, two of our three pizzas were too charred for my taste.  I must mention Paulie walks around all the tables to make sure everyone is enjoying.  Love it!  The restaurant is too dark and loud for my taste.",3.0

"Some of the best za in the city, bar none. The lady and I traveled far and wide for it since we'd heard such great things. It was a Friday night so the restaurant was predictably packed. There's not much in the form of a waiting area, which particularly sucked given how freezing the weather was, but we had a feeling the pie would be well worth the wait (plus we also got to watch a tipsy couple aggressively suck face up close and personal which was an unexpected but enjoyable twist).The vibe was cool, featuring low--lighting, a huge and beautiful custom brick oven, and trendy attractive people who's favorite bands you've never heard of.When we finally were seated I was stoked to see the menu offered a huge variety of pies with all sorts of niche toppings AND vegan options(I personally don't give two damns about veganism but they presented them in an unpretentious way so I was cool with it). We eventually decided to go with the Hell Boy and the Prokypineapple, both of which were amazing, and I'm looking forward to going back and further chowing my way down the menu.Go here.",5.0
"After a 2-hours wait on a weekend for a party of 2, we finally got a table at the renowned pizza shop in Brooklyn. After having one of the best pizzas of all time at Little Isabella located in Baltimore, I was on the mission to find its companion in NYC. Overhyped as we suspected, Paulie Gee had nothing on Little Isabella! Perhaps, it was the quirky blend of sweet and savory flavors, but with that 2-hour wait, we surely did not have a pleasing experience.We ordered two pies: HellBoy and Greenpointer. HellBoy: Fresh Mozzarella, Italian Tomatoes, Berkshire Sopressata Piccante, Parmigiano Reggiano and Mike's HOT HoneyGreenpointer:Fresh Mozzarella, Baby Arugula, Olive Oil, Fresh Lemon Juice and Shaved Parmigiano ReggianoWe didn't really enjoy the sweetness of the honey in the HellBoy or the sourness of the lemon juice in the Greenpointer. Fresh, as we saw them make each pie to order, I definitely thought the doughiness of the pizza wasn't anything spectacular. In terms of service, I think it was pretty solid. Our waiter was patient and helpful. As a surprise, Paulie Gee himself introduced himself to just about every table, making it feel quite personable. In all, I definitely wouldn't return back to this pizzeria, especially with that crazy wait. During that 2-hour wait and 1.5-hour dining time, I can drive down to Baltimore and get some Little Isabella for half the price and no wait!",3.0
"3.5 stars for this pizza joint hidden behind a HUGE wooden door all the way down Franklin streetCrust was good with a nice char on the hellboy but the crust of the greenpoint pizza seemed a bit underdone We were quoted a 1.5 hour wait at 8pm for 3 on a Saturday but we were lucky that people in front of us hadn't returned so we were seated right away! (so don't be discouraged)---hellboy: everything was good about this except that spicy honey! Should of gone with a more classic margherita style pizza instead---greenpoint: fresh arugula, with a bit too much lemon juice, so nothing special NOTE: they don't have pepper flakes, only chili oil",4.0
"If you want great pizza and the right atmosphere look no further than Paulie Gee's. We sat at the bar (luckily) and avoided a two hour wait.  The pizza choices are numerous, with some very creative options. There were three of us and we started with two pies. Would have been content but it was so good we ordered a third.The texture. The crust. The toppings. Hard pressed to mention anything I didn't like. I love pizza and this place is right up there with the best. That includes many pizzerias throughout Italy.Paulie stopped by for a chat and he has a fantastic personality. Great stories and it is obvious that he loves what he does and holds him team to very high standards.He was also kind enough to give me an official Paulie Gee's pin and a limoncello. A very nice touch!Make sure you check out the pizza oven in the back. It's a small,cozy place so don't pass this place up in you are in NY.",5.0
I take my pizza very seriously. The vegan pizza is so good here that if they didn't tell you it was vegan you would have no clue. I had the pie with vegan sausage and shared a few others with friends. It was all out of this world. I can't wait to go back again.,5.0
"There's a LOT of really great pizza in NYC, that's nothing new. But combine amazing pizza with friendly, caring service and a killer ambiance, and Paulie Gee's has a leg up on a lot of the other heavy hitters. The wait can be crazy, but we came in on a Tuesday night and it was half empty. I guess the key is to come when there's post-blizzard sludge everywhere and no one else wants to go out. Paulie Gee was there as I'm told he usually is, weaving around the space with his cup of coffee and stopping at literally every table. For us, he offered to curate our pizza order and who were we to argue? Read on for what Paulie Gee himself recommends:- The Greenpointer: according to Paulie, basically like eating a salad due to the piles of fresh baby arugula on top. - The Mo Cheeks: My personal favorite of the meal. The pickled onions on there are a nice surprise, and give a nice kick to the rest of the ingredients. - The Monte Cristo: OK, so this is probably something I would never think to order myself, but I'm glad it came out for us because it's actually super tasty. It comes with Canadian bacon and a drizzle of maple syrup, which I know sounds weird but trust me (or rather, trust Paulie). - I didn't catch the name of the last pizza, but it was one of the best and after peeking at the menu again I think it might have been the Hellboy. It was piled high with the tastiest Berkshire Sopressata, and it was perfect with the side of Mike's hot honey (which you haven't tried on pizza you must immediately). They asked if we wanted a dessert pizza but at that point we were stuffed to the gills. It was one of the best New York pizza experiences I've had so far, and the service is what really puts them above and beyond. I'm going to run for vice-president of the Paulie Gee fanclub soon!",5.0
"Came here a few days ago with my friend after work. Very dark inside, took some time for my eyeballs to adjust lol. We started off with some beers and then went with the Hellboy which was AMAZING. The hot honey makes a difference! Then we went with a vegan pie since neither one of us was particularly full. We ordered one with spinach, sea salt and garlic on it (sorry don't remember the name!) It was OK, not that memorable. The standout is by far Hellboy, the crust for both pizzas was SUPER THIN, firm and didn't fall apart on me. We both liked it. I took off a star for the spinach pie being nothing special and that it's a bit on the pricey side. Overall, I think I'll be back to try the other pizzas on the menu!",4.0
"Maybe we came on an off night, but we didn't care too much about the pizza and it was definitely not the best we've had. My friend wanted to celebrate her belated birthday at Paulie Gee's and so we did. We ordered 3 pies (Greenpointer, Ricotta Be Kidding Me, and The Hometown Brisket). I think the Hometown Brisket was our favorite only because of the BBQ sauce. Other than that, there wasn't much brisket pieces on the pizza. Ricotta Be Kidding Me was okay. The Greenpointer was all greens so that balanced our meal a little bit. I hear people waiting for hours to get a seat here and right now I'm just wondering where all the hype went? We came when they were opening, so thank goodness we didn't wait on line for this...cause it wouldn't have been worth it. FYI: There's no sign outside that says ""Paulie Gee's"". You just have to look by the address number ""60"" in order to find this place. I actually walked passed it while we were trying to find it. Also, use your flash on your phones to read the menu. I really liked the rustic interior but it was literally pitch black in there.",3.0
"Zagat rated the hellboy as the best pizza in NYC. Wow! Big call Zagat... We had to try! We would say it was delicious... But I would have to say Marta is equal of not just ahead. We got here at 6:40 and had to wait over an hr to sit at the bar. When getting here service was prompt and food was great! We ordered the hellboy and the hellified porkpie white and I have to say it was fresh, full of flavor and great value. My only critique would be more hot suppressa on the hellified and take numbers at the door! It's a little unreasonable to ask people to wait 90 mins and not offer to call when table it ready. Either way it was great but probably won't be crossing the river to wait another 90 mins.",4.0
"If there was ever a restaurant that inspires the need for #PiDay (3.14) to be everyday, it is Paulie Gee's. The pizza is a true art, and every bite is important, from the center to the crust crust.  PG is located in pizza heaven, or right near the water on Greenpoint Ave if you want a Google Map friendly address.Read it on my blog: highclasstohighlifes.com…As you'll see below I'm constantly on the proscuitt of happiness but this time we went for a different ham, Canadian bacon, and on the Monte Cristo. You bet it counted towards happiness. This pizza combines maple syrup drizzle and gouda with the ham. Yes, yes and more yes. Paulie asked if we had butter on the crust...sadly, no. SO MUCH REGRET....that I'll be back in no time to try it. You'll notice on the menu that they have a brisket pizza that features Hometown BBQ -- I love this local BK collaboration. You can get sauced the other way too with Greenpoint local brews!Anyway, I have nearly eaten my way through the entire menu (still need to do a bit of adventuring on the vegan side, every time I get close, I just want meat...) and I have been very pleased with every slice thus far. Therefore my advice to you is go with the pizza that's toppings are most appealing...or grab a handful of friends and share, then you can try multiple pizzas!The man, who is not a myth, but definitely a legend is often found inside checking in on tables, ensuring quality control and getting to know the patrons. He loved my last Instagram post that did a little play words...sharing that I was on the prosciutt of happiness with his King Henry Classic. He's always all smiles and usually wearing a great hat, he is Paulie Gee himself. Paulie Gee's - High Class to High Lifes If you really knead to get delivery or pickup, you'll have to look elsewhere for now though. The only way to leave Paulie Gee's with a to-go box is with leftovers. Rumor has it that a slice joint is opening up nearby though! I'm counting down the days, hours and minutes. Want to keep drooling? Read the menu!Pro Tip: Grab dinner at Paulie Gee's then walk straight out on the water in Greenpoint to Transmitter park or the outlook. Maybe even catch a sunset and BYO night cap!",5.0
"My old pal Carlos and I visited Paulie Gee's last night and had a great meal. I'm accustomed to going with the ol' vegan girlfriend and have a tradition where we split two pies from their extensive vegan selection, so we can try two different types of pies. The vegan and non-vegan selections are both extensive; each category has at least a half dozen kinds of pies, including oil bases, white slices, marinara, spinach-based, spicy honey and barbecue sauce foundations. The pies are aesthetically pleasing to every sense, well, every sense except sound. It's usually better when sound isn't a factor. At least when you're talking about food. When you're talking about music, sound is obviously a very important sense to talk about. I may go as far as to say that in a conversation about music, sound is the only sense that matters.I was excited to go with Carlos because I was going to get to eat their meat and actual cheese. The Paulie Gee's brisket is lean and delicious. Their pickled red onions possess a truly memorable tang and are worth spending a couple buck to add on to pretty much any pie. The ricotta dollops on the Ricky Ricotta feel more like bursts of a cream sauce than regular old cheese. Interestingly, the dairy and non-dairy ricotta cheeses are almost indecipherable in quality, which goes to show that Paulie Gee's knows what's up. Carlos and I were pleased to compliment the trad Italian flavors of the Ricky Ricotta with a tangy Barbecue Brisket pie. I'm psyched to go with a fellow omnivore again, because there are tons of other flavor combos I'm eager to try. New Yorkers, such as myself, are notorious for being dicks about the quality of pizza dough. It's the dough that invalidates the Chicago Deep Dish's false aspiration to pizza status. I can't stand Sicilian pizza either, which is a controversial take in Nueva York. Anyhow, no matter how well adorned a Paulie Gee's pie is, its base--the crust--is its most distinct and wonderful element. The crust is thin but springy, and always a little charred. It's pretty much naan bread, which is either a very luck coincidence or a visionary innovation. Naan bread, as you know, is lit, and, as it turns out, it is the perfect surface upon which various pizza ingredients should be placed and/or spread to mingle harmoniously.I've visited Paulie Gee's a number of times, and there's a bit of narrative that forms around my visits. The first time I tried to go, it was around noon, and my gf and I made the unpleasant discovery that Paulie Gee's does not open til 5 PM. The next time, we rolled up in a deep crew of six and had to wait about two to three hours for a table for six. If you find yourself in that position, you'll be okay though because there are plenty of bars around. There's also the water/skyline, mere yards away and a nice record store a block away.The gf and I have gone a few other times and it's always been great--except for the one time that a camera crew was shooting a special on Paulie Gee's vegan options. My girlfriend and I were in the shot all throughout our meal, and we were fighting (as subtly as possible) for the duration of our meal. I was taken aback and somewhat miffed when the producers of the show asked to do a talking head with us outside. The tension was palpable but they still insisted on interviewing us. I really do believe that you should foot the bill if you're going to interview someone for your television series or web series or gratuitously long Yelp review or whatever. At LEAST commission me to write a song for the soundtrack.In closing, I would like to offer a lil sum sum for the ladies. Are you interested in grandfatherly, charmingly blue collar, short men whose personalities closely resemble those of most Robert De Niro characters--but only in David O. Russel movies? If you do, and might want to be possibly hit on by a man of this caliber, you will love Paulie Gee's. At all times, Paulie Gee's eponymous Pizza Architect and Entrepreneur, Paulie Gee, stalks the narrow spaces between tables, checking in with customers--particularly of the reasonably attractive female demographic--and asks them how their food is, making small talk and thanking them for their patronage. I think this is cool. I would do the same if I were in his position, so don't take this the wrong way. Central to Paulie Gee's game is his ability to recommend a pizza place in seemingly every zip code on the planet and his inclination to tell you (the lady in question) the name of the dude who works there/owns the place, and to tell you (still the lady in question) to tell the dude (who owns the pizza place) to say that he (Paulie Gee) says hi. The Brotherhood of Pizza Mans is truly alive and well.",5.0

"I almost feel like it's blasphemy for not giving 5 stars. Finally made my way over here at Paulie Gees after way too long. Clearly this place is GPs staple so was excited to drop by on Wednesday night.There was no wait- very good. I had been worried about this so called 3x around 6:45pm to see how long it was before heading over. No one picked up and their answering service basically hangs up on you. I ordered the Daniela and he ordered the brisket pizza. Mine came out a good 7 minutes before his. I noticed immediately that about 40% of the crust was charred to the point of being inedible. To top that off, the spinach topping my pizza was the same. It was literally a black piece of ash and when I picked a leaf up or crumbled in my hands. The cheese blend was very good (mozzarella and Parmesan) but the pizza was just not good. To top it off, parts of the center were soggy and didn't hold the toppings when I grabbed a slice. When the brisket pizza came out a few minutes later I noticed immediately that it was cooked perfectly. The crust was edible and delicious. I was bummed that mine didn't come out this way especially since it seemed like a classic. All I can say is they probably put our orders in together and maybe his needed a little longer in the oven. Mine was most likely getting over cooked while his needed a few more minutes. Hence the gap in time between both of our orders coming out and the reason why mine was half done by the time his came out.I was really disappointed but the good thing to know is at least the brisket pizza was cooked well. I know there is a good meal at Paulie Gees but I feel like we were jipped.Also, great touch that Paulie himself came in to greet all the diners. He was super friendly and it brings a family quality to the place. This is maybe one of the main reasons I'd come back.",3.0

There's not much in the form of a waiting area, which particularly sucked given how freezing the weather was, but we had a feeling the pie would be well worth the wait (plus we also got to watch a tipsy couple aggressively suck face up close and personal which was an unexpected but enjoyable twist).The vibe was cool, featuring low--lighting, a huge and beautiful custom brick oven, and trendy attractive people who's favorite bands you've never heard of.When we finally were seated I was stoked to see the menu offered a huge variety of pies with all sorts of niche toppings AND vegan options(I personally don't give two damns about veganism but they presented them in an unpretentious way so I was cool with it). We eventually decided to go with the Hell Boy and the Prokypineapple, both of which were amazing, and I'm looking forward to going back and further chowing my way down the menu.Go here.",5.0
"After a 2-hours wait on a weekend for a party of 2, we finally got a table at the renowned pizza shop in Brooklyn. After having one of the best pizzas of all time at Little Isabella located in Baltimore, I was on the mission to find its companion in NYC. Overhyped as we suspected, Paulie Gee had nothing on Little Isabella! Perhaps, it was the quirky blend of sweet and savory flavors, but with that 2-hour wait, we surely did not have a pleasing experience.We ordered two pies: HellBoy and Greenpointer. HellBoy: Fresh Mozzarella, Italian Tomatoes, Berkshire Sopressata Piccante, Parmigiano Reggiano and Mike's HOT HoneyGreenpointer:Fresh Mozzarella, Baby Arugula, Olive Oil, Fresh Lemon Juice and Shaved Parmigiano ReggianoWe didn't really enjoy the sweetness of the honey in the HellBoy or the sourness of the lemon juice in the Greenpointer. Fresh, as we saw them make each pie to order, I definitely thought the doughiness of the pizza wasn't anything spectacular. In terms of service, I think it was pretty solid. Our waiter was patient and helpful. As a surprise, Paulie Gee himself introduced himself to just about every table, making it feel quite personable. In all, I definitely wouldn't return back to this pizzeria, especially with that crazy wait. During that 2-hour wait and 1.5-hour dining time, I can drive down to Baltimore and get some Little Isabella for half the price and no wait!",3.0
"3.5 stars for this pizza joint hidden behind a HUGE wooden door all the way down Franklin streetCrust was good with a nice char on the hellboy but the crust of the greenpoint pizza seemed a bit underdone We were quoted a 1.5 hour wait at 8pm for 3 on a Saturday but we were lucky that people in front of us hadn't returned so we were seated right away! (so don't be discouraged)---hellboy: everything was good about this except that spicy honey!

"If you want great pizza and the right atmosphere look no further than Paulie Gee's.

Would have been content but it was so good we ordered a third.The texture. The crust. The toppings. Hard pressed to mention anything I didn't like. I love pizza and this place is right up there with the best. That includes many pizzerias throughout Italy.Paulie stopped by for a chat and he has a fantastic personality. Great stories and it is obvious that he loves what he does and holds him team to very high standards.He was also kind enough to give me an official Paulie Gee's pin and a limoncello. A very nice touch!Make sure you check out the pizza oven in the back. It's a small,cozy place so don't pass this place up in you are in NY.",5.0
I take my pizza very seriously. The vegan pizza is so good here that if they didn't tell you it was vegan you would have no clue. I had the pie with vegan sausage and shared a few others with friends. It was all out of this world. I can't wait to go back again.,5.0
"There's a LOT of really great pizza in NYC, that's nothing new. But combine amazing pizza with friendly, caring service and a killer ambiance, and Paulie Gee's has a leg up on a lot of the other heavy hitters. The wait can be crazy, but we came in on a Tuesday night and it was half empty. I guess the key is to come when there's post-blizzard sludge everywhere and no one else wants to go out. Paulie Gee was there as I'm told he usually is, weaving around the space with his cup of coffee and stopping at literally every table. For us, he offered to curate our pizza order and who were we to argue? Read on for what Paulie Gee himself recommends:- The Greenpointer: according to Paulie, basically like eating a salad due to the piles of fresh baby arugula on top. - The Mo Cheeks: My personal favorite of the meal. The pickled onions on there are a nice surprise, and give a nice kick to the rest of the ingredients. - The Monte Cristo: OK, so this is probably something I would never think to order myself, but I'm glad it came out for us because it's actually super tasty. It comes with Canadian bacon and a drizzle of maple syrup, which I know sounds weird but trust me (or rather, trust Paulie). - I didn't catch the name of the last pizza, but it was one of the best and after peeking at the menu again I think it might have been the Hellboy. It was piled high with the tastiest Berkshire Sopressata, and it was perfect with the side of Mike's hot honey (which you haven't tried on pizza you must immediately). They asked if we wanted a dessert pizza but at that point we were stuffed to the gills. It was one of the best New York pizza experiences I've had so far, and the service is what really puts them above and beyond. I'm going to run for vice-president of the Paulie Gee fanclub soon!",5.0
"Came here a few days ago with my friend after work. Very dark inside, took some time for my eyeballs to adjust lol. We started off with some beers and then went with the Hellboy which was AMAZING. The hot honey makes a difference! Then we went with a vegan pie since neither one of us was particularly full. We ordered one with spinach, sea salt and garlic on it (sorry don't remember the name!) It was OK, not that memorable. The standout is by far Hellboy, the crust for both pizzas was SUPER THIN, firm and didn't fall apart on me. We both liked it. I took off a star for the spinach pie being nothing special and that it's a bit on the pricey side. Overall, I think I'll be back to try the other pizzas on the menu!",4.0
"Maybe we came on an off night, but we didn't care too much about the pizza and it was definitely not the best we've had. My friend wanted to celebrate her belated birthday at Paulie Gee's and so we did. We ordered 3 pies (Greenpointer, Ricotta Be Kidding Me, and The Hometown Brisket). I think the Hometown Brisket was our favorite only because of the BBQ sauce. Other than that, there wasn't much brisket pieces on the pizza. Ricotta Be Kidding Me was okay. The Greenpointer was all greens so that balanced our meal a little bit. I hear people waiting for hours to get a seat here and right now I'm just wondering where all the hype went? We came when they were opening, so thank goodness we didn't wait on line for this...cause it wouldn't have been worth it. FYI: There's no sign outside that says ""Paulie Gee's"". You just have to look by the address number ""60"" in order to find this place. I actually walked passed it while we were trying to find it. Also, use your flash on your phones to read the menu. I really liked the rustic interior but it was literally pitch black in there.",3.0
"Zagat rated the hellboy as the best pizza in NYC. Wow! Big call Zagat... We had to try! We would say it was delicious... But I would have to say Marta is equal of not just ahead. We got here at 6:40 and had to wait over an hr to sit at the bar. When getting here service was prompt and food was great! We ordered the hellboy and the hellified porkpie white and I have to say it was fresh, full of flavor and great value. My only critique would be more hot suppressa on the hellified and take numbers at the door! It's a little unreasonable to ask people to wait 90 mins and not offer to call when table it ready. Either way it was great but probably won't be crossing the river to wait another 90 mins.",4.0
"If there was ever a restaurant that inspires the need for #PiDay (3.14) to be everyday, it is Paulie Gee's. The pizza is a true art, and every bite is important, from the center to the crust crust.  PG is located in pizza heaven, or right near the water on Greenpoint Ave if you want a Google Map friendly address.Read it on my blog: highclasstohighlifes.com…As you'll see below I'm constantly on the proscuitt of happiness but this time we went for a different ham, Canadian bacon, and on the Monte Cristo. You bet it counted towards happiness. This pizza combines maple syrup drizzle and gouda with the ham. Yes, yes and more yes. Paulie asked if we had butter on the crust...sadly, no. SO MUCH REGRET....that I'll be back in no time to try it. You'll notice on the menu that they have a brisket pizza that features Hometown BBQ -- I love this local BK collaboration. You can get sauced the other way too with Greenpoint local brews!Anyway, I have nearly eaten my way through the entire menu (still need to do a bit of adventuring on the vegan side, every time I get close, I just want meat...) and I have been very pleased with every slice thus far. Therefore my advice to you is go with the pizza that's toppings are most appealing...or grab a handful of friends and share, then you can try multiple pizzas!The man, who is not a myth, but definitely a legend is often found inside checking in on tables, ensuring quality control and getting to know the patrons. He loved my last Instagram post that did a little play words...sharing that I was on the prosciutt of happiness with his King Henry Classic. He's always all smiles and usually wearing a great hat, he is Paulie Gee himself. Paulie Gee's - High Class to High Lifes If you really knead to get delivery or pickup, you'll have to look elsewhere for now though. The only way to leave Paulie Gee's with a to-go box is with leftovers. Rumor has it that a slice joint is opening up nearby though! I'm counting down the days, hours and minutes. Want to keep drooling? Read the menu!Pro Tip: Grab dinner at Paulie Gee's then walk straight out on the water in Greenpoint to Transmitter park or the outlook. Maybe even catch a sunset and BYO night cap!",5.0
"My old pal Carlos and I visited Paulie Gee's last night and had a great meal. I'm accustomed to going with the ol' vegan girlfriend and have a tradition where we split two pies from their extensive vegan selection, so we can try two different types of pies. The vegan and non-vegan selections are both extensive; each category has at least a half dozen kinds of pies, including oil bases, white slices, marinara, spinach-based, spicy honey and barbecue sauce foundations. The pies are aesthetically pleasing to every sense, well, every sense except sound. It's usually better when sound isn't a factor. At least when you're talking about food. When you're talking about music, sound is obviously a very important sense to talk about. I may go as far as to say that in a conversation about music, sound is the only sense that matters.I was excited to go with Carlos because I was going to get to eat their meat and actual cheese. The Paulie Gee's brisket is lean and delicious. Their pickled red onions possess a truly memorable tang and are worth spending a couple buck to add on to pretty much any pie. The ricotta dollops on the Ricky Ricotta feel more like bursts of a cream sauce than regular old cheese. Interestingly, the dairy and non-dairy ricotta cheeses are almost indecipherable in quality, which goes to show that Paulie Gee's knows what's up. Carlos and I were pleased to compliment the trad Italian flavors of the Ricky Ricotta with a tangy Barbecue Brisket pie. I'm psyched to go with a fellow omnivore again, because there are tons of other flavor combos I'm eager to try. New Yorkers, such as myself, are notorious for being dicks about the quality of pizza dough. It's the dough that invalidates the Chicago Deep Dish's false aspiration to pizza status. I can't stand Sicilian pizza either, which is a controversial take in Nueva York. Anyhow, no matter how well adorned a Paulie Gee's pie is, its base--the crust--is its most distinct and wonderful element. The crust is thin but springy, and always a little charred. It's pretty much naan bread, which is either a very luck coincidence or a visionary innovation. Naan bread, as you know, is lit, and, as it turns out, it is the perfect surface upon which various pizza ingredients should be placed and/or spread to mingle harmoniously.I've visited Paulie Gee's a number of times, and there's a bit of narrative that forms around my visits. The first time I tried to go, it was around noon, and my gf and I made the unpleasant discovery that Paulie Gee's does not open til 5 PM. The next time, we rolled up in a deep crew of six and had to wait about two to three hours for a table for six. If you find yourself in that position, you'll be okay though because there are plenty of bars around. There's also the water/skyline, mere yards away and a nice record store a block away.The gf and I have gone a few other times and it's always been great--except for the one time that a camera crew was shooting a special on Paulie Gee's vegan options. My girlfriend and I were in the shot all throughout our meal, and we were fighting (as subtly as possible) for the duration of our meal. I was taken aback and somewhat miffed when the producers of the show asked to do a talking head with us outside. The tension was palpable but they still insisted on interviewing us. I really do believe that you should foot the bill if you're going to interview someone for your television series or web series or gratuitously long Yelp review or whatever. At LEAST commission me to write a song for the soundtrack.In closing, I would like to offer a lil sum sum for the ladies. Are you interested in grandfatherly, charmingly blue collar, short men whose personalities closely resemble those of most Robert De Niro characters--but only in David O. Russel movies? If you do, and might want to be possibly hit on by a man of this caliber, you will love Paulie Gee's. At all times, Paulie Gee's eponymous Pizza Architect and Entrepreneur, Paulie Gee, stalks the narrow spaces between tables, checking in with customers--particularly of the reasonably attractive female demographic--and asks them how their food is, making small talk and thanking them for their patronage. I think this is cool. I would do the same if I were in his position, so don't take this the wrong way. Central to Paulie Gee's game is his ability to recommend a pizza place in seemingly every zip code on the planet and his inclination to tell you (the lady in question) the name of the dude who works there/owns the place, and to tell you (still the lady in question) to tell the dude (who owns the pizza place) to say that he (Paulie Gee) says hi. The Brotherhood of Pizza Mans is truly alive and well.",5.0

"I almost feel like it's blasphemy for not giving 5 stars. Finally made my way over here at Paulie Gees after way too long. Clearly this place is GPs staple so was excited to drop by on Wednesday night.There was no wait- very good. I had been worried about this so called 3x around 6:45pm to see how long it was before heading over. No one picked up and their answering service basically hangs up on you. I ordered the Daniela and he ordered the brisket pizza. Mine came out a good 7 minutes before his. I noticed immediately that about 40% of the crust was charred to the point of being inedible. To top that off, the spinach topping my pizza was the same. It was literally a black piece of ash and when I picked a leaf up or crumbled in my hands. The cheese blend was very good (mozzarella and Parmesan) but the pizza was just not good. To top it off, parts of the center were soggy and didn't hold the toppings when I grabbed a slice. When the brisket pizza came out a few minutes later I noticed immediately that it was cooked perfectly. The crust was edible and delicious. I was bummed that mine didn't come out this way especially since it seemed like a classic. All I can say is they probably put our orders in together and maybe his needed a little longer in the oven. Mine was most likely getting over cooked while his needed a few more minutes. Hence the gap in time between both of our orders coming out and the reason why mine was half done by the time his came out.I was really disappointed but the good thing to know is at least the brisket pizza was cooked well. I know there is a good meal at Paulie Gees but I feel like we were jipped.Also, great touch that Paulie himself came in to greet all the diners. He was super friendly and it brings a family quality to the place. This is maybe one of the main reasons I'd come back.",3.0
"Delicious!! Definitely made my top 3 favorite pizza  places (the others being robertas and best pizza). We've been meaning to come forever but the line is always so long. We were finally seated right away on a Friday night because we ran over as soon as they opened at 6pm. I would highly recommend this tactic to those of you who have been meaning to come and haven't been able to due to the wait -- the food will be worth it. We ordered the hellboy, ricotta be kidding me and the hot honey ice cream Sunday for dessert. The hellboy was our fave. It was basically a pepperoni pizza with hot honey lined under the cheese. I liked it more than the bees sting from Robertas but both are very good. All in all would highly recommend. As an extra plus Paulie Gee was hanging around today,though it seems like he does this quite often, going from table to table talking to the customers.",5.0
"My husband and I visited Paulie Gee's about two years ago and he still dreams of the Hellboy. This time we ordered the Hellboy and Cherry Jones.  The Hellboy was great but just a touch too sweet for me.  The hot honey adds a little kick but is definitely not too hot.  My husband will tell you it is the best pizza he has ever had (saying a lot since he was raised in the Bronx).  The Cherry Jones on the other hand was way too sweet for both of us.  I couldn't taste anything other then honey.  My husband embarrassed me by telling the waitress we didn't like it.  She offered us a replacement.  We ordered the Ricky Ricotta.  It was alright.  I was shocked because the ricotta was not warm.  The crust at Paulie Gee's is the perfect texture.  However, two of our three pizzas were too charred for my taste.  I must mention Paulie walks around all the tables to make sure everyone is enjoying.  Love it!  The restaurant is too dark and loud for my taste.",3.0
"Interesting decor, super dark inside and it was hard to read the menu. We were seated under one of the speakers, so I felt like an old person complaining about how loud the music was, but really, we came for the food. Split a salad and a Greenpointer pie, and neither disappointed. Both were served quickly, and the pie just exploded with flavor. The lemon kick was strong but not overwhelming, and the crust was perfection. Service was attentive, friendly, and efficient. Lots of menu choices for anything your palate is craving. Overall, a very good experience, and one I would look forward to enjoying again.",4.0
"New York probably takes its pizza more seriously than anywhere else in the world.  I'm sure there are 7 or 8 people reading this right now that would be willing to shiv a guy for saying something bad about their favorite slice.  With that in mind, Paulie Gee's is a pizza lover's pizza place.  They make Neapolitan style pizzas with an oven shipped in from Naples and lovingly reassembled by small, Italian elves.  From this oven, comes perfectly leopard-spotted pizzas with just the right amount of bouncy chewy dough.To top the pizza, there's a lovingly curated selection to choose from so don't you dare ask for substitutions.  Lucky for you whether you're a vegan, vegetarian, white/red pie lover, averse to spice, meat lover, or whatever!  There's at least one pie on the menu* that will make you say, ""hmmm..."".  My personal favorites are the Mo' Cheeks ($16, has guanciale and is perfect with the pickled onions) and Ricotta Be Kidding Me ($17, with tons of meat topped with adorable dollops of cottage cheese).  I've only ever had 1 pizza there that wasn't stellar and I won't tell you which one because you'll definitely judge me for choosing it in the first place.The atmosphere at Paulie Gee's is great.  It's quintessential Brooklyn.  Think dark unfinished wood walls with an eclectic collection of tables made from reclaimed wood, music consisting of a mixture of jazz, rock, and anything but top 40s.  What always makes my night is that the ACTUAL Paulie Gee walks around and talks to EVERYONE.  It doesn't matter if Keri Russell** is sitting right next to you, he will still come by and have a 5-20 minute conversation with you and your table.  My only complaint is how popular this place is.  They've stopped making pizzas to go and still, the wait is crazy.  I've never been able to get a table in less than 45 minutes unless it was late at night.  I guess that's not a bad problem to have.  I also kind of wish they would get a full liquor license and take that creative pizza combo creating mind into the cocktail realm.  I mean...Mike's Hot Honey + Whiskey?  Maybe?---------* If you can't find a pizza you like on the printed menu in the restaurant, whip out the smartphone and check out the ""secret"" menu on the website.** This actually happened.",4.0
"We've literally flown across the country to enjoy his pizza. It's that good! Walking in, the aroma of pizza cooking in a brick oven hits your nose.This is about time my stomach starts to growl. The vibe is flowing with positive energy, and the low lighting is flattering & sexy. The bar to the left is where you can order a beverage while you wait.  They have a decent beer selection. Wait times vary, but it's usually not as long as anticipated, and well worth the effort.Everyone, including the servers, seem happy to be there.Paulie Gee is the utmost host. He's always found time to come to our table with suggestions, stories, and the occasional limoncello, (his recipe of the celebratory cocktail).Talking with him, I've gathered that he makes the vegan pizza for the people, or demand for it, but he didn't seem interested in the cause.

"Absolutely delicious. Huge selection of pies - good for meatatarians, vegetarians, and even vegans. Wood fire oven delivers the signature light smoke and char. Dough is absolutely tender and springy. They even let the pizza rest afterwards so the cheese sets and you don't burn the crap out of your mouth.Hellboy- spicy pepperoni with hot honey. Absolute classic pizza. Hot honey perfectly blankets the spicy meat. Super simple, absolutely delicious. Get two, trust meRicotta/sausage pie - similar to one above, hot honey included. However ricotta and sausage are a welcome addition.

Someone sitting next to us saw our struggle and took us to try the  IN Ricotta Da Vegan so we did. AMAZING!!

"My old pal Carlos and I visited Paulie Gee's last night and had a great meal. I'm accustomed to going with the ol' vegan girlfriend and have a tradition where we split two pies from their extensive vegan selection, so we can try two different types of pies. The vegan and non-vegan selections are both extensive; each category has at least a half dozen kinds of pies, including oil bases, white slices, marinara, spinach-based, spicy honey and barbecue sauce foundations. The pies are aesthetically pleasing to every sense, well, every sense except sound. It's usually better when sound isn't a factor. At least when you're talking about food. When you're talking about music, sound is obviously a very important sense to talk about. I may go as far as to say that in a conversation about music, sound is the only sense that matters.I was excited to go with Carlos because I was going to get to eat their meat and actual cheese. The Paulie Gee's brisket is lean and delicious. Their pickled red onions possess a truly memorable tang and are worth spending a couple buck to add on to pretty much any pie. The ricotta dollops on the Ricky Ricotta feel more like bursts of a cream sauce than regular old cheese. Interestingly, the dairy and non-dairy ricotta cheeses are almost indecipherable in quality, which goes to show that Paulie Gee's knows what's up. Carlos and I were pleased to compliment the trad Italian flavors of the Ricky Ricotta with a tangy Barbecue Brisket pie. I'm psyched to go with a fellow omnivore again, because there are tons of other flavor combos I'm eager to try. New Yorkers, such as myself, are notorious for being dicks about the quality of pizza dough. It's the dough that invalidates the Chicago Deep Dish's false aspiration to pizza status. I can't stand Sicilian pizza either, which is a controversial take in Nueva York. Anyhow, no matter how well adorned a Paulie Gee's pie is, its base--the crust--is its most distinct and wonderful element. The crust is thin but springy, and always a little charred. It's pretty much naan bread, which is either a very luck coincidence or a visionary innovation. Naan bread, as you know, is lit, and, as it turns out, it is the perfect surface upon which various pizza ingredients should be placed and/or spread to mingle harmoniously.I've visited Paulie Gee's a number of times, and there's a bit of narrative that forms around my visits. The first time I tried to go, it was around noon, and my gf and I made the unpleasant discovery that Paulie Gee's does not open til 5 PM. The next time, we rolled up in a deep crew of six and had to wait about two to three hours for a table for six. If you find yourself in that position, you'll be okay though because there are plenty of bars around. There's also the water/skyline, mere yards away and a nice record store a block away.The gf and I have gone a few other times and it's always been great--except for the one time that a camera crew was shooting a special on Paulie Gee's vegan options. My girlfriend and I were in the shot all throughout our meal, and we were fighting (as subtly as possible) for the duration of our meal. I was taken aback and somewhat miffed when the producers of the show asked to do a talking head with us outside. The tension was palpable but they still insisted on interviewing us. I really do believe that you should foot the bill if you're going to interview someone for your television series or web series or gratuitously long Yelp review or whatever.

"I almost feel like it's blasphemy for not giving 5 stars. Finally made my way over here at Paulie Gees after way too long. Clearly this place is GPs staple so was excited to drop by on Wednesday night.There was no wait- very good. I had been worried about this so called 3x around 6:45pm to see how long it was before heading over. No one picked up and their answering service basically hangs up on you. I ordered the Daniela and he ordered the brisket pizza. Mine came out a good 7 minutes before his. I noticed immediately that about 40% of the crust was charred to the point of being inedible. To top that off, the spinach topping my pizza was the same. It was literally a black piece of ash and when I picked a leaf up or crumbled in my hands. The cheese blend was very good (mozzarella and Parmesan) but the pizza was just not good. To top it off, parts of the center were soggy and didn't hold the toppings when I grabbed a slice. When the brisket pizza came out a few minutes later I noticed immediately that it was cooked perfectly. The crust was edible and delicious. I was bummed that mine didn't come out this way especially since it seemed like a classic. All I can say is they probably put our orders in together and maybe his needed a little longer in the oven. Mine was most likely getting over cooked while his needed a few more minutes. Hence the gap in time between both of our orders coming out and the reason why mine was half done by the time his came out.I was really disappointed but the good thing to know is at least the brisket pizza was cooked well. I know there is a good meal at Paulie Gees but I feel like we were jipped.Also, great touch that Paulie himself came in to greet all the diners. He was super friendly and it brings a family quality to the place. This is maybe one of the main reasons I'd come back.",3.0
"Delicious!! Definitely made my top 3 favorite pizza  places (the others being robertas and best pizza). We've been meaning to come forever but the line is always so long. We were finally seated right away on a Friday night because we ran over as soon as they opened at 6pm. I would highly recommend this tactic to those of you who have been meaning to come and haven't been able to due to the wait -- the food will be worth it. We ordered the hellboy, ricotta be kidding me and the hot honey ice cream Sunday for dessert. The hellboy was our fave. It was basically a pepperoni pizza with hot honey lined under the cheese. I liked it more than the bees sting from Robertas but both are very good. All in all would highly recommend. As an extra plus Paulie Gee was hanging around today,though it seems like he does this quite often, going from table to table talking to the customers.",5.0
"My husband and I visited Paulie Gee's about two years ago and he still dreams of the Hellboy. This time we ordered the Hellboy and Cherry Jones.  The Hellboy was great but just a touch too sweet for me.  The hot honey adds a little kick but is definitely not too hot.  My husband will tell you it is the best pizza he has ever had (saying a lot since he was raised in the Bronx).  The Cherry Jones on the other hand was way too sweet for both of us.  I couldn't taste anything other then honey.  My husband embarrassed me by telling the waitress we didn't like it.  She offered us a replacement.  We ordered the Ricky Ricotta.  It was alright.  I was shocked because the ricotta was not warm.  The crust at Paulie Gee's is the perfect texture.  However, two of our three pizzas were too charred for my taste.  I must mention Paulie walks around all the tables to make sure everyone is enjoying.  Love it!  The restaurant is too dark and loud for my taste.",3.0
"Interesting decor, super dark inside and it was hard to read the menu. We were seated under one of the speakers, so I felt like an old person complaining about how loud the music was, but really, we came for the food. Split a salad and a Greenpointer pie, and neither disappointed. Both were served quickly, and the pie just exploded with flavor. The lemon kick was strong but not overwhelming, and the crust was perfection. Service was attentive, friendly, and efficient. Lots of menu choices for anything your palate is craving. Overall, a very good experience, and one I would look forward to enjoying again.",4.0
"New York probably takes its pizza more seriously than anywhere else in the world.  I'm sure there are 7 or 8 people reading this right now that would be willing to shiv a guy for saying something bad about their favorite slice.  With that in mind, Paulie Gee's is a pizza lover's pizza place.  They make Neapolitan style pizzas with an oven shipped in from Naples and lovingly reassembled by small, Italian elves.  From this oven, comes perfectly leopard-spotted pizzas with just the right amount of bouncy chewy dough.To top the pizza, there's a lovingly curated selection to choose from so don't you dare ask for substitutions.  Lucky for you whether you're a vegan, vegetarian, white/red pie lover, averse to spice, meat lover, or whatever!  There's at least one pie on the menu* that will make you say, ""hmmm..."".  My personal favorites are the Mo' Cheeks ($16, has guanciale and is perfect with the pickled onions) and Ricotta Be Kidding Me ($17, with tons of meat topped with adorable dollops of cottage cheese).  I've only ever had 1 pizza there that wasn't stellar and I won't tell you which one because you'll definitely judge me for choosing it in the first place.The atmosphere at Paulie Gee's is great.  It's quintessential Brooklyn.  Think dark unfinished wood walls with an eclectic collection of tables made from reclaimed wood, music consisting of a mixture of jazz, rock, and anything but top 40s.  What always makes my night is that the ACTUAL Paulie Gee walks around and talks to EVERYONE.  It doesn't matter if Keri Russell** is sitting right next to you, he will still come by and have a 5-20 minute conversation with you and your table.  My only complaint is how popular this place is.  They've stopped making pizzas to go and still, the wait is crazy.  I've never been able to get a table in less than 45 minutes unless it was late at night.  I guess that's not a bad problem to have.  I also kind of wish they would get a full liquor license and take that creative pizza combo creating mind into the cocktail realm.  I mean...Mike's Hot Honey + Whiskey?  Maybe?---------* If you can't find a pizza you like on the printed menu in the restaurant, whip out the smartphone and check out the ""secret"" menu on the website.** This actually happened.",4.0
"We've literally flown across the country to enjoy his pizza. It's that good! Walking in, the aroma of pizza cooking in a brick oven hits your nose.This is about time my stomach starts to growl. The vibe is flowing with positive energy, and the low lighting is flattering & sexy. The bar to the left is where you can order a beverage while you wait.  They have a decent beer selection. Wait times vary, but it's usually not as long as anticipated, and well worth the effort.Everyone, including the servers, seem happy to be there.Paulie Gee is the utmost host. He's always found time to come to our table with suggestions, stories, and the occasional limoncello, (his recipe of the celebratory cocktail).Talking with him, I've gathered that he makes the vegan pizza for the people, or demand for it, but he didn't seem interested in the cause. The funky bathrooms can be a challenge to use when you've had one too many! VEGAN Pies we LOVE Simply RedVegan Tomato Sauce with Tomatoes, Olive Oil.

"Absolutely delicious. Huge selection of pies - good for meatatarians, vegetarians, and even vegans. Wood fire oven delivers the signature light smoke and char. Dough is absolutely tender and springy. They even let the pizza rest afterwards so the cheese sets and you don't burn the crap out of your mouth.Hellboy- spicy pepperoni with hot honey. Absolute classic pizza. Hot honey perfectly blankets the spicy meat. Super simple, absolutely delicious. Get two, trust meRicotta/sausage pie - similar to one above, hot honey included. However ricotta and sausage are a welcome addition. While chunks of roasted garlic are an excellent accentSo many other pies, go try them for yourself.Big lines, put your name down and go drink at browerij lane.

"One of the challenges of  being vegan is getting your friends/family to be open to the idea of trying vegan food.I have never had Vegan Pizza before and I usually try to try a restaurant first before recommending to anyone especially a non vegan but I took a chance.When we first arrived we were having trouble picking something since everything was foreign to us. Someone sitting next to us saw our struggle and took us to try the  IN Ricotta Da Vegan so we did. AMAZING!! My non vegan date was impressed and I was so happy.Thanks Paulie Gee for making me looking good Whew! One pie (6 small slices) goes for 16 bucks . Its small, nice ambiance I would say its a little darkI would go again!Menu like here ------ pauliegee.com/greenpoint… xoxoC.",4.0
"Some of the best za in the city, bar none. The lady and I traveled far and wide for it since we'd heard such great things. It was a Friday night so the restaurant was predictably packed. There's not much in the form of a waiting area, which particularly sucked given how freezing the weather was, but we had a feeling the pie would be well worth the wait (plus we also got to watch a tipsy couple aggressively suck face up close and personal which was an unexpected but enjoyable twist).The vibe was cool, featuring low--lighting, a huge and beautiful custom brick oven, and trendy attractive people who's favorite bands you've never heard of.When we finally were seated I was stoked to see the menu offered a huge variety of pies with all sorts of niche toppings AND vegan options(I personally don't give two damns about veganism but they presented them in an unpretentious way so I was cool with it). We eventually decided to go with the Hell Boy and the Prokypineapple, both of which were amazing, and I'm looking forward to going back and further chowing my way down the menu.Go here.",5.0
"After a 2-hours wait on a weekend for a party of 2, we finally got a table at the renowned pizza shop in Brooklyn. After having one of the best pizzas of all time at Little Isabella located in Baltimore, I was on the mission to find its companion in NYC. Overhyped as we suspected, Paulie Gee had nothing on Little Isabella! Perhaps, it was the quirky blend of sweet and savory flavors, but with that 2-hour wait, we surely did not have a pleasing experience.We ordered two pies: HellBoy and Greenpointer. HellBoy: Fresh Mozzarella, Italian Tomatoes, Berkshire Sopressata Piccante, Parmigiano Reggiano and Mike's HOT HoneyGreenpointer:Fresh Mozzarella, Baby Arugula, Olive Oil, Fresh Lemon Juice and Shaved Parmigiano ReggianoWe didn't really enjoy the sweetness of the honey in the HellBoy or the sourness of the lemon juice in the Greenpointer. Fresh, as we saw them make each pie to order, I definitely thought the doughiness of the pizza wasn't anything spectacular. In terms of service, I think it was pretty solid. Our waiter was patient and helpful. As a surprise, Paulie Gee himself introduced himself to just about every table, making it feel quite personable. In all, I definitely wouldn't return back to this pizzeria, especially with that crazy wait. During that 2-hour wait and 1.5-hour dining time, I can drive down to Baltimore and get some Little Isabella for half the price and no wait!",3.0
"3.5 stars for this pizza joint hidden behind a HUGE wooden door all the way down Franklin streetCrust was good with a nice char on the hellboy but the crust of the greenpoint pizza seemed a bit underdone We were quoted a 1.5 hour wait at 8pm for 3 on a Saturday but we were lucky that people in front of us hadn't returned so we were seated right away! (so don't be discouraged)---hellboy: everything was good about this except that spicy honey! Should of gone with a more classic margherita style pizza instead---greenpoint: fresh arugula, with a bit too much lemon juice, so nothing special NOTE: they don't have pepper flakes, only chili oil",4.0
"If you want great pizza and the right atmosphere look no further than Paulie Gee's. We sat at the bar (luckily) and avoided a two hour wait.  The pizza choices are numerous, with some very creative options. There were three of us and we started with two pies. Would have been content but it was so good we ordered a third.The texture. The crust. The toppings. Hard pressed to mention anything I didn't like. I love pizza and this place is right up there with the best. That includes many pizzerias throughout Italy.Paulie stopped by for a chat and he has a fantastic personality. Great stories and it is obvious that he loves what he does and holds him team to very high standards.He was also kind enough to give me an official Paulie Gee's pin and a limoncello. A very nice touch!Make sure you check out the pizza oven in the back. It's a small,cozy place so don't pass this place up in you are in NY.",5.0
I take my pizza very seriously. The vegan pizza is so good here that if they didn't tell you it was vegan you would have no clue. I had the pie with vegan sausage and shared a few others with friends. It was all out of this world. I can't wait to go back again.,5.0
"There's a LOT of really great pizza in NYC, that's nothing new. But combine amazing pizza with friendly, caring service and a killer ambiance, and Paulie Gee's has a leg up on a lot of the other heavy hitters. The wait can be crazy, but we came in on a Tuesday night and it was half empty. I guess the key is to come when there's post-blizzard sludge everywhere and no one else wants to go out. Paulie Gee was there as I'm told he usually is, weaving around the space with his cup of coffee and stopping at literally every table. For us, he offered to curate our pizza order and who were we to argue? Read on for what Paulie Gee himself recommends:- The Greenpointer: according to Paulie, basically like eating a salad due to the piles of fresh baby arugula on top. - The Mo Cheeks: My personal favorite of the meal. The pickled onions on there are a nice surprise, and give a nice kick to the rest of the ingredients. - The Monte Cristo: OK, so this is probably something I would never think to order myself, but I'm glad it came out for us because it's actually super tasty. It comes with Canadian bacon and a drizzle of maple syrup, which I know sounds weird but trust me (or rather, trust Paulie). - I didn't catch the name of the last pizza, but it was one of the best and after peeking at the menu again I think it might have been the Hellboy. It was piled high with the tastiest Berkshire Sopressata, and it was perfect with the side of Mike's hot honey (which you haven't tried on pizza you must immediately). They asked if we wanted a dessert pizza but at that point we were stuffed to the gills. It was one of the best New York pizza experiences I've had so far, and the service is what really puts them above and beyond. I'm going to run for vice-president of the Paulie Gee fanclub soon!",5.0
"Came here a few days ago with my friend after work. Very dark inside, took some time for my eyeballs to adjust lol. We started off with some beers and then went with the Hellboy which was AMAZING. The hot honey makes a difference! Then we went with a vegan pie since neither one of us was particularly full. We ordered one with spinach, sea salt and garlic on it (sorry don't remember the name!) It was OK, not that memorable. The standout is by far Hellboy, the crust for both pizzas was SUPER THIN, firm and didn't fall apart on me. We both liked it. I took off a star for the spinach pie being nothing special and that it's a bit on the pricey side. Overall, I think I'll be back to try the other pizzas on the menu!",4.0
"Maybe we came on an off night, but we didn't care too much about the pizza and it was definitely not the best we've had. My friend wanted to celebrate her belated birthday at Paulie Gee's and so we did. We ordered 3 pies (Greenpointer, Ricotta Be Kidding Me, and The Hometown Brisket). I think the Hometown Brisket was our favorite only because of the BBQ sauce. Other than that, there wasn't much brisket pieces on the pizza. Ricotta Be Kidding Me was okay. The Greenpointer was all greens so that balanced our meal a little bit. I hear people waiting for hours to get a seat here and right now I'm just wondering where all the hype went? We came when they were opening, so thank goodness we didn't wait on line for this...cause it wouldn't have been worth it. FYI: There's no sign outside that says ""Paulie Gee's"".

"I almost feel like it's blasphemy for not giving 5 stars. Finally made my way over here at Paulie Gees after way too long. Clearly this place is GPs staple so was excited to drop by on Wednesday night.There was no wait- very good. I had been worried about this so called 3x around 6:45pm to see how long it was before heading over. No one picked up and their answering service basically hangs up on you. I ordered the Daniela and he ordered the brisket pizza. Mine came out a good 7 minutes before his. I noticed immediately that about 40% of the crust was charred to the point of being inedible. To top that off, the spinach topping my pizza was the same. It was literally a black piece of ash and when I picked a leaf up or crumbled in my hands. The cheese blend was very good (mozzarella and Parmesan) but the pizza was just not good. To top it off, parts of the center were soggy and didn't hold the toppings when I grabbed a slice. When the brisket pizza came out a few minutes later I noticed immediately that it was cooked perfectly. The crust was edible and delicious. I was bummed that mine didn't come out this way especially since it seemed like a classic. All I can say is they probably put our orders in together and maybe his needed a little longer in the oven. Mine was most likely getting over cooked while his needed a few more minutes. Hence the gap in time between both of our orders coming out and the reason why mine was half done by the time his came out.I was really disappointed but the good thing to know is at least the brisket pizza was cooked well. I know there is a good meal at Paulie Gees but I feel like we were jipped.Also, great touch that Paulie himself came in to greet all the diners. He was super friendly and it brings a family quality to the place. This is maybe one of the main reasons I'd come back.",3.0
"Delicious!! Definitely made my top 3 favorite pizza  places (the others being robertas and best pizza). We've been meaning to come forever but the line is always so long.

I would highly recommend this tactic to those of you who have been meaning to come and haven't been able to due to the wait -- the food will be worth it. We ordered the hellboy, ricotta be kidding me and the hot honey ice cream Sunday for dessert. The hellboy was our fave. It was basically a pepperoni pizza with hot honey lined under the cheese.

"My husband and I visited Paulie Gee's about two years ago and he still dreams of the Hellboy. This time we ordered the Hellboy and Cherry Jones.  The Hellboy was great but just a touch too sweet for me.  The hot honey adds a little kick but is definitely not too hot.  My husband will tell you it is the best pizza he has ever had (saying a lot since he was raised in the Bronx).  The Cherry Jones on the other hand was way too sweet for both of us.  I couldn't taste anything other then honey.  My husband embarrassed me by telling the waitress we didn't like it.  She offered us a replacement.  We ordered the Ricky Ricotta.  It was alright.  I was shocked because the ricotta was not warm.  The crust at Paulie Gee's is the perfect texture.  However, two of our three pizzas were too charred for my taste.  I must mention Paulie walks around all the tables to make sure everyone is enjoying.  Love it!  The restaurant is too dark and loud for my taste.",3.0

"Absolutely delicious. Huge selection of pies - good for meatatarians, vegetarians, and even vegans. Wood fire oven delivers the signature light smoke and char. Dough is absolutely tender and springy. They even let the pizza rest afterwards so the cheese sets and you don't burn the crap out of your mouth.Hellboy- spicy pepperoni with hot honey. Absolute classic pizza. Hot honey perfectly blankets the spicy meat. Super simple, absolutely delicious. Get two, trust meRicotta/sausage pie - similar to one above, hot honey included. However ricotta and sausage are a welcome addition.

"One of the challenges of  being vegan is getting your friends/family to be open to the idea of trying vegan food.I have never had Vegan Pizza before and I usually try to try a restaurant first before recommending to anyone especially a non vegan but I took a chance.When we first arrived we were having trouble picking something since everything was foreign to us. Someone sitting next to us saw our struggle and took us to try the  IN Ricotta Da Vegan so we did. AMAZING!! My non vegan date was impressed and I was so happy.Thanks Paulie Gee for making me looking good Whew! One pie (6 small slices) goes for 16 bucks . Its small, nice ambiance I would say its a little darkI would go again!Menu like here ------ pauliegee.com/greenpoint… xoxoC.",4.0
"Some of the best za in the city, bar none. The lady and I traveled far and wide for it since we'd heard such great things. It was a Friday night so the restaurant was predictably packed. There's not much in the form of a waiting area, which particularly sucked given how freezing the weather was, but we had a feeling the pie would be well worth the wait (plus we also got to watch a tipsy couple aggressively suck face up close and personal which was an unexpected but enjoyable twist).The vibe was cool, featuring low--lighting, a huge and beautiful custom brick oven, and trendy attractive people who's favorite bands you've never heard of.When we finally were seated I was stoked to see the menu offered a huge variety of pies with all sorts of niche toppings AND vegan options(I personally don't give two damns about veganism but they presented them in an unpretentious way so I was cool with it). We eventually decided to go with the Hell Boy and the Prokypineapple, both of which were amazing, and I'm looking forward to going back and further chowing my way down the menu.Go here.",5.0
"After a 2-hours wait on a weekend for a party of 2, we finally got a table at the renowned pizza shop in Brooklyn. After having one of the best pizzas of all time at Little Isabella located in Baltimore, I was on the mission to find its companion in NYC. Overhyped as we suspected, Paulie Gee had nothing on Little Isabella! Perhaps, it was the quirky blend of sweet and savory flavors, but with that 2-hour wait, we surely did not have a pleasing experience.We ordered two pies: HellBoy and Greenpointer. HellBoy: Fresh Mozzarella, Italian Tomatoes, Berkshire Sopressata Piccante, Parmigiano Reggiano and Mike's HOT HoneyGreenpointer:Fresh Mozzarella, Baby Arugula, Olive Oil, Fresh Lemon Juice and Shaved Parmigiano ReggianoWe didn't really enjoy the sweetness of the honey in the HellBoy or the sourness of the lemon juice in the Greenpointer. Fresh, as we saw them make each pie to order, I definitely thought the doughiness of the pizza wasn't anything spectacular. In terms of service, I think it was pretty solid. Our waiter was patient and helpful. As a surprise, Paulie Gee himself introduced himself to just about every table, making it feel quite personable. In all, I definitely wouldn't return back to this pizzeria, especially with that crazy wait. During that 2-hour wait and 1.5-hour dining time, I can drive down to Baltimore and get some Little Isabella for half the price and no wait!",3.0
"3.5 stars for this pizza joint hidden behind a HUGE wooden door all the way down Franklin streetCrust was good with a nice char on the hellboy but the crust of the greenpoint pizza seemed a bit underdone We were quoted a 1.5 hour wait at 8pm for 3 on a Saturday but we were lucky that people in front of us hadn't returned so we were seated right away! (so don't be discouraged)---hellboy: everything was good about this except that spicy honey! Should of gone with a more classic margherita style pizza instead---greenpoint: fresh arugula, with a bit too much lemon juice, so nothing special NOTE: they don't have pepper flakes, only chili oil",4.0
"If you want great pizza and the right atmosphere look no further than Paulie Gee's. We sat at the bar (luckily) and avoided a two hour wait.  The pizza choices are numerous, with some very creative options. There were three of us and we started with two pies. Would have been content but it was so good we ordered a third.The texture. The crust. The toppings. Hard pressed to mention anything I didn't like. I love pizza and this place is right up there with the best. That includes many pizzerias throughout Italy.Paulie stopped by for a chat and he has a fantastic personality. Great stories and it is obvious that he loves what he does and holds him team to very high standards.He was also kind enough to give me an official Paulie Gee's pin and a limoncello. A very nice touch!Make sure you check out the pizza oven in the back. It's a small,cozy place so don't pass this place up in you are in NY.",5.0
I take my pizza very seriously. The vegan pizza is so good here that if they didn't tell you it was vegan you would have no clue. I had the pie with vegan sausage and shared a few others with friends. It was all out of this world. I can't wait to go back again.,5.0
"There's a LOT of really great pizza in NYC, that's nothing new. But combine amazing pizza with friendly, caring service and a killer ambiance, and Paulie Gee's has a leg up on a lot of the other heavy hitters. The wait can be crazy, but we came in on a Tuesday night and it was half empty. I guess the key is to come when there's post-blizzard sludge everywhere and no one else wants to go out. Paulie Gee was there as I'm told he usually is, weaving around the space with his cup of coffee and stopping at literally every table. For us, he offered to curate our pizza order and who were we to argue? Read on for what Paulie Gee himself recommends:- The Greenpointer: according to Paulie, basically like eating a salad due to the piles of fresh baby arugula on top. - The Mo Cheeks: My personal favorite of the meal. The pickled onions on there are a nice surprise, and give a nice kick to the rest of the ingredients. - The Monte Cristo: OK, so this is probably something I would never think to order myself, but I'm glad it came out for us because it's actually super tasty. It comes with Canadian bacon and a drizzle of maple syrup, which I know sounds weird but trust me (or rather, trust Paulie). - I didn't catch the name of the last pizza, but it was one of the best and after peeking at the menu again I think it might have been the Hellboy. It was piled high with the tastiest Berkshire Sopressata, and it was perfect with the side of Mike's hot honey (which you haven't tried on pizza you must immediately). They asked if we wanted a dessert pizza but at that point we were stuffed to the gills. It was one of the best New York pizza experiences I've had so far, and the service is what really puts them above and beyond. I'm going to run for vice-president of the Paulie Gee fanclub soon!",5.0
"Came here a few days ago with my friend after work. Very dark inside, took some time for my eyeballs to adjust lol. We started off with some beers and then went with the Hellboy which was AMAZING. The hot honey makes a difference! Then we went with a vegan pie since neither one of us was particularly full. We ordered one with spinach, sea salt and garlic on it (sorry don't remember the name!) It was OK, not that memorable. The standout is by far Hellboy, the crust for both pizzas was SUPER THIN, firm and didn't fall apart on me. We both liked it. I took off a star for the spinach pie being nothing special and that it's a bit on the pricey side. Overall, I think I'll be back to try the other pizzas on the menu!",4.0
"Maybe we came on an off night, but we didn't care too much about the pizza and it was definitely not the best we've had. My friend wanted to celebrate her belated birthday at Paulie Gee's and so we did. We ordered 3 pies (Greenpointer, Ricotta Be Kidding Me, and The Hometown Brisket). I think the Hometown Brisket was our favorite only because of the BBQ sauce. Other than that, there wasn't much brisket pieces on the pizza. Ricotta Be Kidding Me was okay. The Greenpointer was all greens so that balanced our meal a little bit. I hear people waiting for hours to get a seat here and right now I'm just wondering where all the hype went? We came when they were opening, so thank goodness we didn't wait on line for this...cause it wouldn't have been worth it. FYI: There's no sign outside that says ""Paulie Gee's"". You just have to look by the address number ""60"" in order to find this place. I actually walked passed it while we were trying to find it. Also, use your flash on your phones to read the menu. I really liked the rustic interior but it was literally pitch black in there.",3.0
"Zagat rated the hellboy as the best pizza in NYC. Wow! Big call Zagat... We had to try! We would say it was delicious... But I would have to say Marta is equal of not just ahead. We got here at 6:40 and had to wait over an hr to sit at the bar. When getting here service was prompt and food was great! We ordered the hellboy and the hellified porkpie white and I have to say it was fresh, full of flavor and great value. My only critique would be more hot suppressa on the hellified and take numbers at the door! It's a little unreasonable to ask people to wait 90 mins and not offer to call when table it ready. Either way it was great but probably won't be crossing the river to wait another 90 mins.",4.0
"If there was ever a restaurant that inspires the need for #PiDay (3.14) to be everyday, it is Paulie Gee's. The pizza is a true art, and every bite is important, from the center to the crust crust.  PG is located in pizza heaven, or right near the water on Greenpoint Ave if you want a Google Map friendly address.Read it on my blog: highclasstohighlifes.com…As you'll see below I'm constantly on the proscuitt of happiness but this time we went for a different ham, Canadian bacon, and on the Monte Cristo. You bet it counted towards happiness. This pizza combines maple syrup drizzle and gouda with the ham. Yes, yes and more yes. Paulie asked if we had butter on the crust...sadly, no. SO MUCH REGRET....that I'll be back in no time to try it. You'll notice on the menu that they have a brisket pizza that features Hometown BBQ -- I love this local BK collaboration. You can get sauced the other way too with Greenpoint local brews!Anyway, I have nearly eaten my way through the entire menu (still need to do a bit of adventuring on the vegan side, every time I get close, I just want meat...) and I have been very pleased with every slice thus far. Therefore my advice to you is go with the pizza that's toppings are most appealing...or grab a handful of friends and share, then you can try multiple pizzas!The man, who is not a myth, but definitely a legend is often found inside checking in on tables, ensuring quality control and getting to know the patrons. He loved my last Instagram post that did a little play words...sharing that I was on the prosciutt of happiness with his King Henry Classic. He's always all smiles and usually wearing a great hat, he is Paulie Gee himself. Paulie Gee's - High Class to High Lifes If you really knead to get delivery or pickup, you'll have to look elsewhere for now though. The only way to leave Paulie Gee's with a to-go box is with leftovers. Rumor has it that a slice joint is opening up nearby though! I'm counting down the days, hours and minutes. Want to keep drooling? Read the menu!Pro Tip: Grab dinner at Paulie Gee's then walk straight out on the water in Greenpoint to Transmitter park or the outlook. Maybe even catch a sunset and BYO night cap!",5.0
"My old pal Carlos and I visited Paulie Gee's last night and had a great meal. I'm accustomed to going with the ol' vegan girlfriend and have a tradition where we split two pies from their extensive vegan selection, so we can try two different types of pies. The vegan and non-vegan selections are both extensive; each category has at least a half dozen kinds of pies, including oil bases, white slices, marinara, spinach-based, spicy honey and barbecue sauce foundations. The pies are aesthetically pleasing to every sense, well, every sense except sound. It's usually better when sound isn't a factor. At least when you're talking about food. When you're talking about music, sound is obviously a very important sense to talk about. I may go as far as to say that in a conversation about music, sound is the only sense that matters.I was excited to go with Carlos because I was going to get to eat their meat and actual cheese. The Paulie Gee's brisket is lean and delicious. Their pickled red onions possess a truly memorable tang and are worth spending a couple buck to add on to pretty much any pie. The ricotta dollops on the Ricky Ricotta feel more like bursts of a cream sauce than regular old cheese. Interestingly, the dairy and non-dairy ricotta cheeses are almost indecipherable in quality, which goes to show that Paulie Gee's knows what's up. Carlos and I were pleased to compliment the trad Italian flavors of the Ricky Ricotta with a tangy Barbecue Brisket pie. I'm psyched to go with a fellow omnivore again, because there are tons of other flavor combos I'm eager to try. New Yorkers, such as myself, are notorious for being dicks about the quality of pizza dough. It's the dough that invalidates the Chicago Deep Dish's false aspiration to pizza status. I can't stand Sicilian pizza either, which is a controversial take in Nueva York. Anyhow, no matter how well adorned a Paulie Gee's pie is, its base--the crust--is its most distinct and wonderful element. The crust is thin but springy, and always a little charred. It's pretty much naan bread, which is either a very luck coincidence or a visionary innovation. Naan bread, as you know, is lit, and, as it turns out, it is the perfect surface upon which various pizza ingredients should be placed and/or spread to mingle harmoniously.I've visited Paulie Gee's a number of times, and there's a bit of narrative that forms around my visits. The first time I tried to go, it was around noon, and my gf and I made the unpleasant discovery that Paulie Gee's does not open til 5 PM. The next time, we rolled up in a deep crew of six and had to wait about two to three hours for a table for six. If you find yourself in that position, you'll be okay though because there are plenty of bars around. There's also the water/skyline, mere yards away and a nice record store a block away.The gf and I have gone a few other times and it's always been great--except for the one time that a camera crew was shooting a special on Paulie Gee's vegan options. My girlfriend and I were in the shot all throughout our meal, and we were fighting (as subtly as possible) for the duration of our meal. I was taken aback and somewhat miffed when the producers of the show asked to do a talking head with us outside. The tension was palpable but they still insisted on interviewing us. I really do believe that you should foot the bill if you're going to interview someone for your television series or web series or gratuitously long Yelp review or whatever. At LEAST commission me to write a song for the soundtrack.In closing, I would like to offer a lil sum sum for the ladies. Are you interested in grandfatherly, charmingly blue collar, short men whose personalities closely resemble those of most Robert De Niro characters--but only in David O. Russel movies? If you do, and might want to be possibly hit on by a man of this caliber, you will love Paulie Gee's. At all times, Paulie Gee's eponymous Pizza Architect and Entrepreneur, Paulie Gee, stalks the narrow spaces between tables, checking in with customers--particularly of the reasonably attractive female demographic--and asks them how their food is, making small talk and thanking them for their patronage. I think this is cool. I would do the same if I were in his position, so don't take this the wrong way. Central to Paulie Gee's game is his ability to recommend a pizza place in seemingly every zip code on the planet and his inclination to tell you (the lady in question) the name of the dude who works there/owns the place, and to tell you (still the lady in question) to tell the dude (who owns the pizza place) to say that he (Paulie Gee) says hi.

"Some of the best za in the city, bar none. The lady and I traveled far and wide for it since we'd heard such great things. It was a Friday night so the restaurant was predictably packed. There's not much in the form of a waiting area, which particularly sucked given how freezing the weather was, but we had a feeling the pie would be well worth the wait (plus we also got to watch a tipsy couple aggressively suck face up close and personal which was an unexpected but enjoyable twist).The vibe was cool, featuring low--lighting, a huge and beautiful custom brick oven, and trendy attractive people who's favorite bands you've never heard of.When we finally were seated I was stoked to see the menu offered a huge variety of pies with all sorts of niche toppings AND vegan options(I personally don't give two damns about veganism but they presented them in an unpretentious way so I was cool with it).

"After a 2-hours wait on a weekend for a party of 2, we finally got a table at the renowned pizza shop in Brooklyn. After having one of the best pizzas of all time at Little Isabella located in Baltimore, I was on the mission to find its companion in NYC. Overhyped as we suspected, Paulie Gee had nothing on Little Isabella! Perhaps, it was the quirky blend of sweet and savory flavors, but with that 2-hour wait, we surely did not have a pleasing experience.We ordered two pies: HellBoy and Greenpointer. HellBoy: Fresh Mozzarella, Italian Tomatoes, Berkshire Sopressata Piccante, Parmigiano Reggiano and Mike's HOT HoneyGreenpointer:Fresh Mozzarella, Baby Arugula, Olive Oil, Fresh Lemon Juice and Shaved Parmigiano ReggianoWe didn't really enjoy the sweetness of the honey in the HellBoy or the sourness of the lemon juice in the Greenpointer. Fresh, as we saw them make each pie to order, I definitely thought the doughiness of the pizza wasn't anything spectacular. In terms of service, I think it was pretty solid. Our waiter was patient and helpful. As a surprise, Paulie Gee himself introduced himself to just about every table, making it feel quite personable. In all, I definitely wouldn't return back to this pizzeria, especially with that crazy wait. During that 2-hour wait and 1.5-hour dining time, I can drive down to Baltimore and get some Little Isabella for half the price and no wait!",3.0

I take my pizza very seriously. The vegan pizza is so good here that if they didn't tell you it was vegan you would have no clue. I had the pie with vegan sausage and shared a few others with friends. It was all out of this world. I can't wait to go back again.,5.0
"There's a LOT of really great pizza in NYC, that's nothing new. But combine amazing pizza with friendly, caring service and a killer ambiance, and Paulie Gee's has a leg up on a lot of the other heavy hitters. The wait can be crazy, but we came in on a Tuesday night and it was half empty. I guess the key is to come when there's post-blizzard sludge everywhere and no one else wants to go out. Paulie Gee was there as I'm told he usually is, weaving around the space with his cup of coffee and stopping at literally every table. For us, he offered to curate our pizza order and who were we to argue? Read on for what Paulie Gee himself recommends:- The Greenpointer: according to Paulie, basically like eating a salad due to the piles of fresh baby arugula on top. - The Mo Cheeks: My personal favorite of the meal. The pickled onions on there are a nice surprise, and give a nice kick to the rest of the ingredients. - The Monte Cristo: OK, so this is probably something I would never think to order myself, but I'm glad it came out for us because it's actually super tasty. It comes with Canadian bacon and a drizzle of maple syrup, which I know sounds weird but trust me (or rather, trust Paulie). - I didn't catch the name of the last pizza, but it was one of the best and after peeking at the menu again I think it might have been the Hellboy. It was piled high with the tastiest Berkshire Sopressata, and it was perfect with the side of Mike's hot honey (which you haven't tried on pizza you must immediately). They asked if we wanted a dessert pizza but at that point we were stuffed to the gills. It was one of the best New York pizza experiences I've had so far, and the service is what really puts them above and beyond. I'm going to run for vice-president of the Paulie Gee fanclub soon!",5.0
"Came here a few days ago with my friend after work. Very dark inside, took some time for my eyeballs to adjust lol. We started off with some beers and then went with the Hellboy which was AMAZING. The hot honey makes a difference! Then we went with a vegan pie since neither one of us was particularly full. We ordered one with spinach, sea salt and garlic on it (sorry don't remember the name!) It was OK, not that memorable. The standout is by far Hellboy, the crust for both pizzas was SUPER THIN, firm and didn't fall apart on me. We both liked it. I took off a star for the spinach pie being nothing special and that it's a bit on the pricey side. Overall, I think I'll be back to try the other pizzas on the menu!",4.0
"Maybe we came on an off night, but we didn't care too much about the pizza and it was definitely not the best we've had. My friend wanted to celebrate her belated birthday at Paulie Gee's and so we did. We ordered 3 pies (Greenpointer, Ricotta Be Kidding Me, and The Hometown Brisket). I think the Hometown Brisket was our favorite only because of the BBQ sauce. Other than that, there wasn't much brisket pieces on the pizza. Ricotta Be Kidding Me was okay. The Greenpointer was all greens so that balanced our meal a little bit. I hear people waiting for hours to get a seat here and right now I'm just wondering where all the hype went? We came when they were opening, so thank goodness we didn't wait on line for this...cause it wouldn't have been worth it. FYI: There's no sign outside that says ""Paulie Gee's"". You just have to look by the address number ""60"" in order to find this place. I actually walked passed it while we were trying to find it. Also, use your flash on your phones to read the menu. I really liked the rustic interior but it was literally pitch black in there.",3.0
"Zagat rated the hellboy as the best pizza in NYC. Wow! Big call Zagat... We had to try! We would say it was delicious... But I would have to say Marta is equal of not just ahead. We got here at 6:40 and had to wait over an hr to sit at the bar. When getting here service was prompt and food was great! We ordered the hellboy and the hellified porkpie white and I have to say it was fresh, full of flavor and great value. My only critique would be more hot suppressa on the hellified and take numbers at the door! It's a little unreasonable to ask people to wait 90 mins and not offer to call when table it ready. Either way it was great but probably won't be crossing the river to wait another 90 mins.",4.0
"If there was ever a restaurant that inspires the need for #PiDay (3.14) to be everyday, it is Paulie Gee's. The pizza is a true art, and every bite is important, from the center to the crust crust.  PG is located in pizza heaven, or right near the water on Greenpoint Ave if you want a Google Map friendly address.Read it on my blog: highclasstohighlifes.com…As you'll see below I'm constantly on the proscuitt of happiness but this time we went for a different ham, Canadian bacon, and on the Monte Cristo. You bet it counted towards happiness. This pizza combines maple syrup drizzle and gouda with the ham. Yes, yes and more yes. Paulie asked if we had butter on the crust...sadly, no. SO MUCH REGRET....that I'll be back in no time to try it. You'll notice on the menu that they have a brisket pizza that features Hometown BBQ -- I love this local BK collaboration. You can get sauced the other way too with Greenpoint local brews!Anyway, I have nearly eaten my way through the entire menu (still need to do a bit of adventuring on the vegan side, every time I get close, I just want meat...) and I have been very pleased with every slice thus far. Therefore my advice to you is go with the pizza that's toppings are most appealing...or grab a handful of friends and share, then you can try multiple pizzas!The man, who is not a myth, but definitely a legend is often found inside checking in on tables, ensuring quality control and getting to know the patrons. He loved my last Instagram post that did a little play words...sharing that I was on the prosciutt of happiness with his King Henry Classic. He's always all smiles and usually wearing a great hat, he is Paulie Gee himself. Paulie Gee's - High Class to High Lifes If you really knead to get delivery or pickup, you'll have to look elsewhere for now though. The only way to leave Paulie Gee's with a to-go box is with leftovers. Rumor has it that a slice joint is opening up nearby though! I'm counting down the days, hours and minutes. Want to keep drooling? Read the menu!Pro Tip: Grab dinner at Paulie Gee's then walk straight out on the water in Greenpoint to Transmitter park or the outlook. Maybe even catch a sunset and BYO night cap!",5.0
"My old pal Carlos and I visited Paulie Gee's last night and had a great meal. I'm accustomed to going with the ol' vegan girlfriend and have a tradition where we split two pies from their extensive vegan selection, so we can try two different types of pies. The vegan and non-vegan selections are both extensive; each category has at least a half dozen kinds of pies, including oil bases, white slices, marinara, spinach-based, spicy honey and barbecue sauce foundations. The pies are aesthetically pleasing to every sense, well, every sense except sound. It's usually better when sound isn't a factor. At least when you're talking about food. When you're talking about music, sound is obviously a very important sense to talk about. I may go as far as to say that in a conversation about music, sound is the only sense that matters.I was excited to go with Carlos because I was going to get to eat their meat and actual cheese. The Paulie Gee's brisket is lean and delicious. Their pickled red onions possess a truly memorable tang and are worth spending a couple buck to add on to pretty much any pie. The ricotta dollops on the Ricky Ricotta feel more like bursts of a cream sauce than regular old cheese. Interestingly, the dairy and non-dairy ricotta cheeses are almost indecipherable in quality, which goes to show that Paulie Gee's knows what's up. Carlos and I were pleased to compliment the trad Italian flavors of the Ricky Ricotta with a tangy Barbecue Brisket pie. I'm psyched to go with a fellow omnivore again, because there are tons of other flavor combos I'm eager to try. New Yorkers, such as myself, are notorious for being dicks about the quality of pizza dough. It's the dough that invalidates the Chicago Deep Dish's false aspiration to pizza status. I can't stand Sicilian pizza either, which is a controversial take in Nueva York. Anyhow, no matter how well adorned a Paulie Gee's pie is, its base--the crust--is its most distinct and wonderful element. The crust is thin but springy, and always a little charred. It's pretty much naan bread, which is either a very luck coincidence or a visionary innovation. Naan bread, as you know, is lit, and, as it turns out, it is the perfect surface upon which various pizza ingredients should be placed and/or spread to mingle harmoniously.I've visited Paulie Gee's a number of times, and there's a bit of narrative that forms around my visits. The first time I tried to go, it was around noon, and my gf and I made the unpleasant discovery that Paulie Gee's does not open til 5 PM. The next time, we rolled up in a deep crew of six and had to wait about two to three hours for a table for six. If you find yourself in that position, you'll be okay though because there are plenty of bars around. There's also the water/skyline, mere yards away and a nice record store a block away.The gf and I have gone a few other times and it's always been great--except for the one time that a camera crew was shooting a special on Paulie Gee's vegan options. My girlfriend and I were in the shot all throughout our meal, and we were fighting (as subtly as possible) for the duration of our meal. I was taken aback and somewhat miffed when the producers of the show asked to do a talking head with us outside. The tension was palpable but they still insisted on interviewing us. I really do believe that you should foot the bill if you're going to interview someone for your television series or web series or gratuitously long Yelp review or whatever. At LEAST commission me to write a song for the soundtrack.In closing, I would like to offer a lil sum sum for the ladies. Are you interested in grandfatherly, charmingly blue collar, short men whose personalities closely resemble those of most Robert De Niro characters--but only in David O. Russel movies? If you do, and might want to be possibly hit on by a man of this caliber, you will love Paulie Gee's. At all times, Paulie Gee's eponymous Pizza Architect and Entrepreneur, Paulie Gee, stalks the narrow spaces between tables, checking in with customers--particularly of the reasonably attractive female demographic--and asks them how their food is, making small talk and thanking them for their patronage. I think this is cool. I would do the same if I were in his position, so don't take this the wrong way. Central to Paulie Gee's game is his ability to recommend a pizza place in seemingly every zip code on the planet and his inclination to tell you (the lady in question) the name of the dude who works there/owns the place, and to tell you (still the lady in question) to tell the dude (who owns the pizza place) to say that he (Paulie Gee) says hi. The Brotherhood of Pizza Mans is truly alive and well.",5.0

"I almost feel like it's blasphemy for not giving 5 stars. Finally made my way over here at Paulie Gees after way too long. Clearly this place is GPs staple so was excited to drop by on Wednesday night.There was no wait- very good. I had been worried about this so called 3x around 6:45pm to see how long it was before heading over. No one picked up and their answering service basically hangs up on you. I ordered the Daniela and he ordered the brisket pizza. Mine came out a good 7 minutes before his. I noticed immediately that about 40% of the crust was charred to the point of being inedible. To top that off, the spinach topping my pizza was the same. It was literally a black piece of ash and when I picked a leaf up or crumbled in my hands. The cheese blend was very good (mozzarella and Parmesan) but the pizza was just not good. To top it off, parts of the center were soggy and didn't hold the toppings when I grabbed a slice. When the brisket pizza came out a few minutes later I noticed immediately that it was cooked perfectly. The crust was edible and delicious. I was bummed that mine didn't come out this way especially since it seemed like a classic. All I can say is they probably put our orders in together and maybe his needed a little longer in the oven. Mine was most likely getting over cooked while his needed a few more minutes. Hence the gap in time between both of our orders coming out and the reason why mine was half done by the time his came out.I was really disappointed but the good thing to know is at least the brisket pizza was cooked well. I know there is a good meal at Paulie Gees but I feel like we were jipped.Also, great touch that Paulie himself came in to greet all the diners. He was super friendly and it brings a family quality to the place. This is maybe one of the main reasons I'd come back.",3.0
"Delicious!! Definitely made my top 3 favorite pizza  places (the others being robertas and best pizza). We've been meaning to come forever but the line is always so long. We were finally seated right away on a Friday night because we ran over as soon as they opened at 6pm. I would highly recommend this tactic to those of you who have been meaning to come and haven't been able to due to the wait -- the food will be worth it. We ordered the hellboy, ricotta be kidding me and the hot honey ice cream Sunday for dessert. The hellboy was our fave. It was basically a pepperoni pizza with hot honey lined under the cheese. I liked it more than the bees sting from Robertas but both are very good. All in all would highly recommend. As an extra plus Paulie Gee was hanging around today,though it seems like he does this quite often, going from table to table talking to the customers.",5.0
"My husband and I visited Paulie Gee's about two years ago and he still dreams of the Hellboy. This time we ordered the Hellboy and Cherry Jones.  The Hellboy was great but just a touch too sweet for me.  The hot honey adds a little kick but is definitely not too hot.  My husband will tell you it is the best pizza he has ever had (saying a lot since he was raised in the Bronx).  The Cherry Jones on the other hand was way too sweet for both of us.  I couldn't taste anything other then honey.  My husband embarrassed me by telling the waitress we didn't like it.  She offered us a replacement.  We ordered the Ricky Ricotta.  It was alright.  I was shocked because the ricotta was not warm.  The crust at Paulie Gee's is the perfect texture.  However, two of our three pizzas were too charred for my taste.  I must mention Paulie walks around all the tables to make sure everyone is enjoying.  Love it!  The restaurant is too dark and loud for my taste.",3.0
"Interesting decor, super dark inside and it was hard to read the menu. We were seated under one of the speakers, so I felt like an old person complaining about how loud the music was, but really, we came for the food. Split a salad and a Greenpointer pie, and neither disappointed. Both were served quickly, and the pie just exploded with flavor. The lemon kick was strong but not overwhelming, and the crust was perfection. Service was attentive, friendly, and efficient. Lots of menu choices for anything your palate is craving. Overall, a very good experience, and one I would look forward to enjoying again.",4.0
"New York probably takes its pizza more seriously than anywhere else in the world.  I'm sure there are 7 or 8 people reading this right now that would be willing to shiv a guy for saying something bad about their favorite slice.  With that in mind, Paulie Gee's is a pizza lover's pizza place.  They make Neapolitan style pizzas with an oven shipped in from Naples and lovingly reassembled by small, Italian elves.  From this oven, comes perfectly leopard-spotted pizzas with just the right amount of bouncy chewy dough.To top the pizza, there's a lovingly curated selection to choose from so don't you dare ask for substitutions.  Lucky for you whether you're a vegan, vegetarian, white/red pie lover, averse to spice, meat lover, or whatever!  There's at least one pie on the menu* that will make you say, ""hmmm..."".  My personal favorites are the Mo' Cheeks ($16, has guanciale and is perfect with the pickled onions) and Ricotta Be Kidding Me ($17, with tons of meat topped with adorable dollops of cottage cheese).  I've only ever had 1 pizza there that wasn't stellar and I won't tell you which one because you'll definitely judge me for choosing it in the first place.The atmosphere at Paulie Gee's is great.  It's quintessential Brooklyn.  Think dark unfinished wood walls with an eclectic collection of tables made from reclaimed wood, music consisting of a mixture of jazz, rock, and anything but top 40s.  What always makes my night is that the ACTUAL Paulie Gee walks around and talks to EVERYONE.  It doesn't matter if Keri Russell** is sitting right next to you, he will still come by and have a 5-20 minute conversation with you and your table.  My only complaint is how popular this place is.  They've stopped making pizzas to go and still, the wait is crazy.  I've never been able to get a table in less than 45 minutes unless it was late at night.  I guess that's not a bad problem to have.  I also kind of wish they would get a full liquor license and take that creative pizza combo creating mind into the cocktail realm.  I mean...Mike's Hot Honey + Whiskey?  Maybe?---------* If you can't find a pizza you like on the printed menu in the restaurant, whip out the smartphone and check out the ""secret"" menu on the website.** This actually happened.",4.0

It was piled high with the tastiest Berkshire Sopressata, and it was perfect with the side of Mike's hot honey (which you haven't tried on pizza you must immediately). They asked if we wanted a dessert pizza but at that point we were stuffed to the gills. It was one of the best New York pizza experiences I've had so far, and the service is what really puts them above and beyond. I'm going to run for vice-president of the Paulie Gee fanclub soon!",5.0
"Came here a few days ago with my friend after work. Very dark inside, took some time for my eyeballs to adjust lol. We started off with some beers and then went with the Hellboy which was AMAZING. The hot honey makes a difference! Then we went with a vegan pie since neither one of us was particularly full. We ordered one with spinach, sea salt and garlic on it (sorry don't remember the name!) It was OK, not that memorable. The standout is by far Hellboy, the crust for both pizzas was SUPER THIN, firm and didn't fall apart on me. We both liked it.

"Maybe we came on an off night, but we didn't care too much about the pizza and it was definitely not the best we've had. My friend wanted to celebrate her belated birthday at Paulie Gee's and so we did. We ordered 3 pies (Greenpointer, Ricotta Be Kidding Me, and The Hometown Brisket). I think the Hometown Brisket was our favorite only because of the BBQ sauce. Other than that, there wasn't much brisket pieces on the pizza. Ricotta Be Kidding Me was okay. The Greenpointer was all greens so that balanced our meal a little bit. I hear people waiting for hours to get a seat here and right now I'm just wondering where all the hype went? We came when they were opening, so thank goodness we didn't wait on line for this...cause it wouldn't have been worth it. FYI: There's no sign outside that says ""Paulie Gee's"".

"My old pal Carlos and I visited Paulie Gee's last night and had a great meal. I'm accustomed to going with the ol' vegan girlfriend and have a tradition where we split two pies from their extensive vegan selection, so we can try two different types of pies. The vegan and non-vegan selections are both extensive; each category has at least a half dozen kinds of pies, including oil bases, white slices, marinara, spinach-based, spicy honey and barbecue sauce foundations. The pies are aesthetically pleasing to every sense, well, every sense except sound. It's usually better when sound isn't a factor. At least when you're talking about food. When you're talking about music, sound is obviously a very important sense to talk about. I may go as far as to say that in a conversation about music, sound is the only sense that matters.I was excited to go with Carlos because I was going to get to eat their meat and actual cheese. The Paulie Gee's brisket is lean and delicious. Their pickled red onions possess a truly memorable tang and are worth spending a couple buck to add on to pretty much any pie. The ricotta dollops on the Ricky Ricotta feel more like bursts of a cream sauce than regular old cheese. Interestingly, the dairy and non-dairy ricotta cheeses are almost indecipherable in quality, which goes to show that Paulie Gee's knows what's up. Carlos and I were pleased to compliment the trad Italian flavors of the Ricky Ricotta with a tangy Barbecue Brisket pie. I'm psyched to go with a fellow omnivore again, because there are tons of other flavor combos I'm eager to try. New Yorkers, such as myself, are notorious for being dicks about the quality of pizza dough. It's the dough that invalidates the Chicago Deep Dish's false aspiration to pizza status. I can't stand Sicilian pizza either, which is a controversial take in Nueva York. Anyhow, no matter how well adorned a Paulie Gee's pie is, its base--the crust--is its most distinct and wonderful element. The crust is thin but springy, and always a little charred. It's pretty much naan bread, which is either a very luck coincidence or a visionary innovation. Naan bread, as you know, is lit, and, as it turns out, it is the perfect surface upon which various pizza ingredients should be placed and/or spread to mingle harmoniously.I've visited Paulie Gee's a number of times, and there's a bit of narrative that forms around my visits. The first time I tried to go, it was around noon, and my gf and I made the unpleasant discovery that Paulie Gee's does not open til 5 PM. The next time, we rolled up in a deep crew of six and had to wait about two to three hours for a table for six. If you find yourself in that position, you'll be okay though because there are plenty of bars around. There's also the water/skyline, mere yards away and a nice record store a block away.The gf and I have gone a few other times and it's always been great--except for the one time that a camera crew was shooting a special on Paulie Gee's vegan options. My girlfriend and I were in the shot all throughout our meal, and we were fighting (as subtly as possible) for the duration of our meal. I was taken aback and somewhat miffed when the producers of the show asked to do a talking head with us outside. The tension was palpable but they still insisted on interviewing us. I really do believe that you should foot the bill if you're going to interview someone for your television series or web series or gratuitously long Yelp review or whatever. At LEAST commission me to write a song for the soundtrack.In closing, I would like to offer a lil sum sum for the ladies. Are you interested in grandfatherly, charmingly blue collar, short men whose personalities closely resemble those of most Robert De Niro characters--but only in David O. Russel movies? If you do, and might want to be possibly hit on by a man of this caliber, you will love Paulie Gee's. At all times, Paulie Gee's eponymous Pizza Architect and Entrepreneur, Paulie Gee, stalks the narrow spaces between tables, checking in with customers--particularly of the reasonably attractive female demographic--and asks them how their food is, making small talk and thanking them for their patronage. I think this is cool. I would do the same if I were in his position, so don't take this the wrong way. Central to Paulie Gee's game is his ability to recommend a pizza place in seemingly every zip code on the planet and his inclination to tell you (the lady in question) the name of the dude who works there/owns the place, and to tell you (still the lady in question) to tell the dude (who owns the pizza place) to say that he (Paulie Gee) says hi. The Brotherhood of Pizza Mans is truly alive and well.",5.0

"I almost feel like it's blasphemy for not giving 5 stars. Finally made my way over here at Paulie Gees after way too long. Clearly this place is GPs staple so was excited to drop by on Wednesday night.There was no wait- very good. I had been worried about this so called 3x around 6:45pm to see how long it was before heading over. No one picked up and their answering service basically hangs up on you. I ordered the Daniela and he ordered the brisket pizza. Mine came out a good 7 minutes before his. I noticed immediately that about 40% of the crust was charred to the point of being inedible. To top that off, the spinach topping my pizza was the same. It was literally a black piece of ash and when I picked a leaf up or crumbled in my hands. The cheese blend was very good (mozzarella and Parmesan) but the pizza was just not good. To top it off, parts of the center were soggy and didn't hold the toppings when I grabbed a slice. When the brisket pizza came out a few minutes later I noticed immediately that it was cooked perfectly. The crust was edible and delicious. I was bummed that mine didn't come out this way especially since it seemed like a classic. All I can say is they probably put our orders in together and maybe his needed a little longer in the oven. Mine was most likely getting over cooked while his needed a few more minutes. Hence the gap in time between both of our orders coming out and the reason why mine was half done by the time his came out.I was really disappointed but the good thing to know is at least the brisket pizza was cooked well. I know there is a good meal at Paulie Gees but I feel like we were jipped.Also, great touch that Paulie himself came in to greet all the diners. He was super friendly and it brings a family quality to the place. This is maybe one of the main reasons I'd come back.",3.0
"Delicious!! Definitely made my top 3 favorite pizza  places (the others being robertas and best pizza). We've been meaning to come forever but the line is always so long. We were finally seated right away on a Friday night because we ran over as soon as they opened at 6pm. I would highly recommend this tactic to those of you who have been meaning to come and haven't been able to due to the wait -- the food will be worth it. We ordered the hellboy, ricotta be kidding me and the hot honey ice cream Sunday for dessert. The hellboy was our fave. It was basically a pepperoni pizza with hot honey lined under the cheese. I liked it more than the bees sting from Robertas but both are very good. All in all would highly recommend. As an extra plus Paulie Gee was hanging around today,though it seems like he does this quite often, going from table to table talking to the customers.",5.0
"My husband and I visited Paulie Gee's about two years ago and he still dreams of the Hellboy. This time we ordered the Hellboy and Cherry Jones.  The Hellboy was great but just a touch too sweet for me.  The hot honey adds a little kick but is definitely not too hot.  My husband will tell you it is the best pizza he has ever had (saying a lot since he was raised in the Bronx).  The Cherry Jones on the other hand was way too sweet for both of us.  I couldn't taste anything other then honey.  My husband embarrassed me by telling the waitress we didn't like it.  She offered us a replacement.  We ordered the Ricky Ricotta.  It was alright.  I was shocked because the ricotta was not warm.  The crust at Paulie Gee's is the perfect texture.  However, two of our three pizzas were too charred for my taste.  I must mention Paulie walks around all the tables to make sure everyone is enjoying.  Love it!  The restaurant is too dark and loud for my taste.",3.0
"Interesting decor, super dark inside and it was hard to read the menu. We were seated under one of the speakers, so I felt like an old person complaining about how loud the music was, but really, we came for the food. Split a salad and a Greenpointer pie, and neither disappointed. Both were served quickly, and the pie just exploded with flavor. The lemon kick was strong but not overwhelming, and the crust was perfection. Service was attentive, friendly, and efficient. Lots of menu choices for anything your palate is craving. Overall, a very good experience, and one I would look forward to enjoying again.",4.0
"New York probably takes its pizza more seriously than anywhere else in the world.  I'm sure there are 7 or 8 people reading this right now that would be willing to shiv a guy for saying something bad about their favorite slice.  With that in mind, Paulie Gee's is a pizza lover's pizza place.  They make Neapolitan style pizzas with an oven shipped in from Naples and lovingly reassembled by small, Italian elves.  From this oven, comes perfectly leopard-spotted pizzas with just the right amount of bouncy chewy dough.To top the pizza, there's a lovingly curated selection to choose from so don't you dare ask for substitutions.  Lucky for you whether you're a vegan, vegetarian, white/red pie lover, averse to spice, meat lover, or whatever!  There's at least one pie on the menu* that will make you say, ""hmmm..."".  My personal favorites are the Mo' Cheeks ($16, has guanciale and is perfect with the pickled onions) and Ricotta Be Kidding Me ($17, with tons of meat topped with adorable dollops of cottage cheese).  I've only ever had 1 pizza there that wasn't stellar and I won't tell you which one because you'll definitely judge me for choosing it in the first place.The atmosphere at Paulie Gee's is great.  It's quintessential Brooklyn.  Think dark unfinished wood walls with an eclectic collection of tables made from reclaimed wood, music consisting of a mixture of jazz, rock, and anything but top 40s.  What always makes my night is that the ACTUAL Paulie Gee walks around and talks to EVERYONE.  It doesn't matter if Keri Russell** is sitting right next to you, he will still come by and have a 5-20 minute conversation with you and your table.  My only complaint is how popular this place is.  They've stopped making pizzas to go and still, the wait is crazy.  I've never been able to get a table in less than 45 minutes unless it was late at night.  I guess that's not a bad problem to have.  I also kind of wish they would get a full liquor license and take that creative pizza combo creating mind into the cocktail realm.  I mean...Mike's Hot Honey + Whiskey?  Maybe?---------* If you can't find a pizza you like on the printed menu in the restaurant, whip out the smartphone and check out the ""secret"" menu on the website.** This actually happened.",4.0
"We've literally flown across the country to enjoy his pizza. It's that good! Walking in, the aroma of pizza cooking in a brick oven hits your nose.This is about time my stomach starts to growl. The vibe is flowing with positive energy, and the low lighting is flattering & sexy. The bar to the left is where you can order a beverage while you wait.  They have a decent beer selection. Wait times vary, but it's usually not as long as anticipated, and well worth the effort.Everyone, including the servers, seem happy to be there.Paulie Gee is the utmost host. He's always found time to come to our table with suggestions, stories, and the occasional limoncello, (his recipe of the celebratory cocktail).Talking with him, I've gathered that he makes the vegan pizza for the people, or demand for it, but he didn't seem interested in the cause. The funky bathrooms can be a challenge to use when you've had one too many! VEGAN Pies we LOVE Simply RedVegan Tomato Sauce with Tomatoes, Olive Oil.

"Absolutely delicious. Huge selection of pies - good for meatatarians, vegetarians, and even vegans. Wood fire oven delivers the signature light smoke and char. Dough is absolutely tender and springy. They even let the pizza rest afterwards so the cheese sets and you don't burn the crap out of your mouth.Hellboy- spicy pepperoni with hot honey. Absolute classic pizza. Hot honey perfectly blankets the spicy meat. Super simple, absolutely delicious. Get two, trust meRicotta/sausage pie - similar to one above, hot honey included. However ricotta and sausage are a welcome addition.

"One of the challenges of  being vegan is getting your friends/family to be open to the idea of trying vegan food.I have never had Vegan Pizza before and I usually try to try a restaurant first before recommending to anyone especially a non vegan but I took a chance.When we first arrived we were having trouble picking something since everything was foreign to us. Someone sitting next to us saw our struggle and took us to try the  IN Ricotta Da Vegan so we did. AMAZING!! My non vegan date was impressed and I was so happy.Thanks Paulie Gee for making me looking good Whew! One pie (6 small slices) goes for 16 bucks . Its small, nice ambiance I would say its a little darkI would go again!Menu like here ------ pauliegee.com/greenpoint… xoxoC.",4.0
"Some of the best za in the city, bar none. The lady and I traveled far and wide for it since we'd heard such great things. It was a Friday night so the restaurant was predictably packed. There's not much in the form of a waiting area, which particularly sucked given how freezing the weather was, but we had a feeling the pie would be well worth the wait (plus we also got to watch a tipsy couple aggressively suck face up close and personal which was an unexpected but enjoyable twist).The vibe was cool, featuring low--lighting, a huge and beautiful custom brick oven, and trendy attractive people who's favorite bands you've never heard of.When we finally were seated I was stoked to see the menu offered a huge variety of pies with all sorts of niche toppings AND vegan options(I personally don't give two damns about veganism but they presented them in an unpretentious way so I was cool with it). We eventually decided to go with the Hell Boy and the Prokypineapple, both of which were amazing, and I'm looking forward to going back and further chowing my way down the menu.Go here.",5.0
"After a 2-hours wait on a weekend for a party of 2, we finally got a table at the renowned pizza shop in Brooklyn. After having one of the best pizzas of all time at Little Isabella located in Baltimore, I was on the mission to find its companion in NYC. Overhyped as we suspected, Paulie Gee had nothing on Little Isabella! Perhaps, it was the quirky blend of sweet and savory flavors, but with that 2-hour wait, we surely did not have a pleasing experience.We ordered two pies: HellBoy and Greenpointer. HellBoy: Fresh Mozzarella, Italian Tomatoes, Berkshire Sopressata Piccante, Parmigiano Reggiano and Mike's HOT HoneyGreenpointer:Fresh Mozzarella, Baby Arugula, Olive Oil, Fresh Lemon Juice and Shaved Parmigiano ReggianoWe didn't really enjoy the sweetness of the honey in the HellBoy or the sourness of the lemon juice in the Greenpointer. Fresh, as we saw them make each pie to order, I definitely thought the doughiness of the pizza wasn't anything spectacular. In terms of service, I think it was pretty solid. Our waiter was patient and helpful. As a surprise, Paulie Gee himself introduced himself to just about every table, making it feel quite personable. In all, I definitely wouldn't return back to this pizzeria, especially with that crazy wait. During that 2-hour wait and 1.5-hour dining time, I can drive down to Baltimore and get some Little Isabella for half the price and no wait!",3.0
"3.5 stars for this pizza joint hidden behind a HUGE wooden door all the way down Franklin streetCrust was good with a nice char on the hellboy but the crust of the greenpoint pizza seemed a bit underdone We were quoted a 1.5 hour wait at 8pm for 3 on a Saturday but we were lucky that people in front of us hadn't returned so we were seated right away! (so don't be discouraged)---hellboy: everything was good about this except that spicy honey! Should of gone with a more classic margherita style pizza instead---greenpoint: fresh arugula, with a bit too much lemon juice, so nothing special NOTE: they don't have pepper flakes, only chili oil",4.0
"If you want great pizza and the right atmosphere look no further than Paulie Gee's. We sat at the bar (luckily) and avoided a two hour wait.  The pizza choices are numerous, with some very creative options. There were three of us and we started with two pies. Would have been content but it was so good we ordered a third.The texture. The crust. The toppings. Hard pressed to mention anything I didn't like. I love pizza and this place is right up there with the best. That includes many pizzerias throughout Italy.Paulie stopped by for a chat and he has a fantastic personality. Great stories and it is obvious that he loves what he does and holds him team to very high standards.He was also kind enough to give me an official Paulie Gee's pin and a limoncello. A very nice touch!Make sure you check out the pizza oven in the back. It's a small,cozy place so don't pass this place up in you are in NY.",5.0
I take my pizza very seriously. The vegan pizza is so good here that if they didn't tell you it was vegan you would have no clue. I had the pie with vegan sausage and shared a few others with friends. It was all out of this world. I can't wait to go back again.,5.0
"There's a LOT of really great pizza in NYC, that's nothing new. But combine amazing pizza with friendly, caring service and a killer ambiance, and Paulie Gee's has a leg up on a lot of the other heavy hitters. The wait can be crazy, but we came in on a Tuesday night and it was half empty. I guess the key is to come when there's post-blizzard sludge everywhere and no one else wants to go out. Paulie Gee was there as I'm told he usually is, weaving around the space with his cup of coffee and stopping at literally every table. For us, he offered to curate our pizza order and who were we to argue? Read on for what Paulie Gee himself recommends:- The Greenpointer: according to Paulie, basically like eating a salad due to the piles of fresh baby arugula on top. - The Mo Cheeks: My personal favorite of the meal. The pickled onions on there are a nice surprise, and give a nice kick to the rest of the ingredients. - The Monte Cristo: OK, so this is probably something I would never think to order myself, but I'm glad it came out for us because it's actually super tasty.

The first time I tried to go, it was around noon, and my gf and I made the unpleasant discovery that Paulie Gee's does not open til 5 PM. The next time, we rolled up in a deep crew of six and had to wait about two to three hours for a table for six.

My girlfriend and I were in the shot all throughout our meal, and we were fighting (as subtly as possible) for the duration of our meal. I was taken aback and somewhat miffed when the producers of the show asked to do a talking head with us outside. The tension was palpable but they still insisted on interviewing us.

"I almost feel like it's blasphemy for not giving 5 stars. Finally made my way over here at Paulie Gees after way too long. Clearly this place is GPs staple so was excited to drop by on Wednesday night.There was no wait- very good. I had been worried about this so called 3x around 6:45pm to see how long it was before heading over. No one picked up and their answering service basically hangs up on you. I ordered the Daniela and he ordered the brisket pizza. Mine came out a good 7 minutes before his. I noticed immediately that about 40% of the crust was charred to the point of being inedible. To top that off, the spinach topping my pizza was the same. It was literally a black piece of ash and when I picked a leaf up or crumbled in my hands. The cheese blend was very good (mozzarella and Parmesan) but the pizza was just not good. To top it off, parts of the center were soggy and didn't hold the toppings when I grabbed a slice. When the brisket pizza came out a few minutes later I noticed immediately that it was cooked perfectly. The crust was edible and delicious. I was bummed that mine didn't come out this way especially since it seemed like a classic. All I can say is they probably put our orders in together and maybe his needed a little longer in the oven. Mine was most likely getting over cooked while his needed a few more minutes. Hence the gap in time between both of our orders coming out and the reason why mine was half done by the time his came out.I was really disappointed but the good thing to know is at least the brisket pizza was cooked well. I know there is a good meal at Paulie Gees but I feel like we were jipped.Also, great touch that Paulie himself came in to greet all the diners. He was super friendly and it brings a family quality to the place. This is maybe one of the main reasons I'd come back.",3.0

I would highly recommend this tactic to those of you who have been meaning to come and haven't been able to due to the wait -- the food will be worth it. We ordered the hellboy, ricotta be kidding me and the hot honey ice cream Sunday for dessert. The hellboy was our fave. It was basically a pepperoni pizza with hot honey lined under the cheese. I liked it more than the bees sting from Robertas but both are very good. All in all would highly recommend.

"My husband and I visited Paulie Gee's about two years ago and he still dreams of the Hellboy. This time we ordered the Hellboy and Cherry Jones.  The Hellboy was great but just a touch too sweet for me.  The hot honey adds a little kick but is definitely not too hot.  My husband will tell you it is the best pizza he has ever had (saying a lot since he was raised in the Bronx).  The Cherry Jones on the other hand was way too sweet for both of us.  I couldn't taste anything other then honey.  My husband embarrassed me by telling the waitress we didn't like it.  She offered us a replacement.  We ordered the Ricky Ricotta.  It was alright.  I was shocked because the ricotta was not warm.  The crust at Paulie Gee's is the perfect texture.  However, two of our three pizzas were too charred for my taste.  I must mention Paulie walks around all the tables to make sure everyone is enjoying.  Love it!  The restaurant is too dark and loud for my taste.",3.0

"New York probably takes its pizza more seriously than anywhere else in the world.  I'm sure there are 7 or 8 people reading this right now that would be willing to shiv a guy for saying something bad about their favorite slice.  With that in mind, Paulie Gee's is a pizza lover's pizza place.  They make Neapolitan style pizzas with an oven shipped in from Naples and lovingly reassembled by small, Italian elves.  From this oven, comes perfectly leopard-spotted pizzas with just the right amount of bouncy chewy dough.To top the pizza, there's a lovingly curated selection to choose from so don't you dare ask for substitutions.  Lucky for you whether you're a vegan, vegetarian, white/red pie lover, averse to spice, meat lover, or whatever!  There's at least one pie on the menu* that will make you say, ""hmmm..."".  My personal favorites are the Mo' Cheeks ($16, has guanciale and is perfect with the pickled onions) and Ricotta Be Kidding Me ($17, with tons of meat topped with adorable dollops of cottage cheese).  I've only ever had 1 pizza there that wasn't stellar and I won't tell you which one because you'll definitely judge me for choosing it in the first place.The atmosphere at Paulie Gee's is great.  It's quintessential Brooklyn.  Think dark unfinished wood walls with an eclectic collection of tables made from reclaimed wood, music consisting of a mixture of jazz, rock, and anything but top 40s.  What always makes my night is that the ACTUAL Paulie Gee walks around and talks to EVERYONE.  It doesn't matter if Keri Russell** is sitting right next to you, he will still come by and have a 5-20 minute conversation with you and your table.  My only complaint is how popular this place is.  They've stopped making pizzas to go and still, the wait is crazy.  I've never been able to get a table in less than 45 minutes unless it was late at night.  I guess that's not a bad problem to have.  I also kind of wish they would get a full liquor license and take that creative pizza combo creating mind into the cocktail realm.  I mean...Mike's Hot Honey + Whiskey?  Maybe?---------* If you can't find a pizza you like on the printed menu in the restaurant, whip out the smartphone and check out the ""secret"" menu on the website.** This actually happened.",4.0
"We've literally flown across the country to enjoy his pizza. It's that good! Walking in, the aroma of pizza cooking in a brick oven hits your nose.This is about time my stomach starts to growl. The vibe is flowing with positive energy, and the low lighting is flattering & sexy. The bar to the left is where you can order a beverage while you wait.  They have a decent beer selection. Wait times vary, but it's usually not as long as anticipated, and well worth the effort.Everyone, including the servers, seem happy to be there.Paulie Gee is the utmost host. He's always found time to come to our table with suggestions, stories, and the occasional limoncello, (his recipe of the celebratory cocktail).Talking with him, I've gathered that he makes the vegan pizza for the people, or demand for it, but he didn't seem interested in the cause. The funky bathrooms can be a challenge to use when you've had one too many! VEGAN Pies we LOVE Simply RedVegan Tomato Sauce with Tomatoes, Olive Oil. Vidalia Onions, Garlic, Basil, Salt and PepperVegan Daniela SpinaciBaby Spinach, Olive Oil, Fresh Sliced Garlic, Mild Aleppo Chili Oil and Sea SaltIn Ricotta Da VeganVegan Tomato Sauce, House Made Vegan Sausage, Post-oven House Made Cashew Ricotta Dollops, Baby Arugula and Extra Virgin Olive OilWith many return visits, we've yet to have a negative experience.There has been noise over the years of Paulie Giannone opening a Portland outpost, but it has yet to materialize. Meanwhile, I'll dream of his pizza.",5.0
"Absolutely delicious. Huge selection of pies - good for meatatarians, vegetarians, and even vegans. Wood fire oven delivers the signature light smoke and char. Dough is absolutely tender and springy. They even let the pizza rest afterwards so the cheese sets and you don't burn the crap out of your mouth.Hellboy- spicy pepperoni with hot honey. Absolute classic pizza. Hot honey perfectly blankets the spicy meat. Super simple, absolutely delicious. Get two, trust meRicotta/sausage pie - similar to one above, hot honey included. However ricotta and sausage are a welcome addition. While chunks of roasted garlic are an excellent accentSo many other pies, go try them for yourself.Big lines, put your name down and go drink at browerij lane.

"One of the challenges of  being vegan is getting your friends/family to be open to the idea of trying vegan food.I have never had Vegan Pizza before and I usually try to try a restaurant first before recommending to anyone especially a non vegan but I took a chance.When we first arrived we were having trouble picking something since everything was foreign to us. Someone sitting next to us saw our struggle and took us to try the  IN Ricotta Da Vegan so we did. AMAZING!! My non vegan date was impressed and I was so happy.Thanks Paulie Gee for making me looking good Whew! One pie (6 small slices) goes for 16 bucks . Its small, nice ambiance I would say its a little darkI would go again!Menu like here ------ pauliegee.com/greenpoint… xoxoC.",4.0
"Some of the best za in the city, bar none. The lady and I traveled far and wide for it since we'd heard such great things. It was a Friday night so the restaurant was predictably packed. There's not much in the form of a waiting area, which particularly sucked given how freezing the weather was, but we had a feeling the pie would be well worth the wait (plus we also got to watch a tipsy couple aggressively suck face up close and personal which was an unexpected but enjoyable twist).The vibe was cool, featuring low--lighting, a huge and beautiful custom brick oven, and trendy attractive people who's favorite bands you've never heard of.When we finally were seated I was stoked to see the menu offered a huge variety of pies with all sorts of niche toppings AND vegan options(I personally don't give two damns about veganism but they presented them in an unpretentious way so I was cool with it). We eventually decided to go with the Hell Boy and the Prokypineapple, both of which were amazing, and I'm looking forward to going back and further chowing my way down the menu.Go here.",5.0
"After a 2-hours wait on a weekend for a party of 2, we finally got a table at the renowned pizza shop in Brooklyn. After having one of the best pizzas of all time at Little Isabella located in Baltimore, I was on the mission to find its companion in NYC. Overhyped as we suspected, Paulie Gee had nothing on Little Isabella! Perhaps, it was the quirky blend of sweet and savory flavors, but with that 2-hour wait, we surely did not have a pleasing experience.We ordered two pies: HellBoy and Greenpointer. HellBoy: Fresh Mozzarella, Italian Tomatoes, Berkshire Sopressata Piccante, Parmigiano Reggiano and Mike's HOT HoneyGreenpointer:Fresh Mozzarella, Baby Arugula, Olive Oil, Fresh Lemon Juice and Shaved Parmigiano ReggianoWe didn't really enjoy the sweetness of the honey in the HellBoy or the sourness of the lemon juice in the Greenpointer. Fresh, as we saw them make each pie to order, I definitely thought the doughiness of the pizza wasn't anything spectacular. In terms of service, I think it was pretty solid. Our waiter was patient and helpful. As a surprise, Paulie Gee himself introduced himself to just about every table, making it feel quite personable. In all, I definitely wouldn't return back to this pizzeria, especially with that crazy wait. During that 2-hour wait and 1.5-hour dining time, I can drive down to Baltimore and get some Little Isabella for half the price and no wait!",3.0
"3.5 stars for this pizza joint hidden behind a HUGE wooden door all the way down Franklin streetCrust was good with a nice char on the hellboy but the crust of the greenpoint pizza seemed a bit underdone We were quoted a 1.5 hour wait at 8pm for 3 on a Saturday but we were lucky that people in front of us hadn't returned so we were seated right away! (so don't be discouraged)---hellboy: everything was good about this except that spicy honey! Should of gone with a more classic margherita style pizza instead---greenpoint: fresh arugula, with a bit too much lemon juice, so nothing special NOTE: they don't have pepper flakes, only chili oil",4.0
"If you want great pizza and the right atmosphere look no further than Paulie Gee's. We sat at the bar (luckily) and avoided a two hour wait.  The pizza choices are numerous, with some very creative options. There were three of us and we started with two pies. Would have been content but it was so good we ordered a third.The texture. The crust. The toppings. Hard pressed to mention anything I didn't like. I love pizza and this place is right up there with the best. That includes many pizzerias throughout Italy.Paulie stopped by for a chat and he has a fantastic personality. Great stories and it is obvious that he loves what he does and holds him team to very high standards.He was also kind enough to give me an official Paulie Gee's pin and a limoncello. A very nice touch!Make sure you check out the pizza oven in the back. It's a small,cozy place so don't pass this place up in you are in NY.",5.0
I take my pizza very seriously. The vegan pizza is so good here that if they didn't tell you it was vegan you would have no clue. I had the pie with vegan sausage and shared a few others with friends. It was all out of this world. I can't wait to go back again.,5.0
"There's a LOT of really great pizza in NYC, that's nothing new. But combine amazing pizza with friendly, caring service and a killer ambiance, and Paulie Gee's has a leg up on a lot of the other heavy hitters. The wait can be crazy, but we came in on a Tuesday night and it was half empty. I guess the key is to come when there's post-blizzard sludge everywhere and no one else wants to go out. Paulie Gee was there as I'm told he usually is, weaving around the space with his cup of coffee and stopping at literally every table. For us, he offered to curate our pizza order and who were we to argue? Read on for what Paulie Gee himself recommends:- The Greenpointer: according to Paulie, basically like eating a salad due to the piles of fresh baby arugula on top. - The Mo Cheeks: My personal favorite of the meal. The pickled onions on there are a nice surprise, and give a nice kick to the rest of the ingredients. - The Monte Cristo: OK, so this is probably something I would never think to order myself, but I'm glad it came out for us because it's actually super tasty. It comes with Canadian bacon and a drizzle of maple syrup, which I know sounds weird but trust me (or rather, trust Paulie). - I didn't catch the name of the last pizza, but it was one of the best and after peeking at the menu again I think it might have been the Hellboy. It was piled high with the tastiest Berkshire Sopressata, and it was perfect with the side of Mike's hot honey (which you haven't tried on pizza you must immediately). They asked if we wanted a dessert pizza but at that point we were stuffed to the gills. It was one of the best New York pizza experiences I've had so far, and the service is what really puts them above and beyond. I'm going to run for vice-president of the Paulie Gee fanclub soon!",5.0
"Came here a few days ago with my friend after work. Very dark inside, took some time for my eyeballs to adjust lol. We started off with some beers and then went with the Hellboy which was AMAZING. The hot honey makes a difference! Then we went with a vegan pie since neither one of us was particularly full. We ordered one with spinach, sea salt and garlic on it (sorry don't remember the name!) It was OK, not that memorable. The standout is by far Hellboy, the crust for both pizzas was SUPER THIN, firm and didn't fall apart on me. We both liked it. I took off a star for the spinach pie being nothing special and that it's a bit on the pricey side. Overall, I think I'll be back to try the other pizzas on the menu!",4.0
"Maybe we came on an off night, but we didn't care too much about the pizza and it was definitely not the best we've had. My friend wanted to celebrate her belated birthday at Paulie Gee's and so we did. We ordered 3 pies (Greenpointer, Ricotta Be Kidding Me, and The Hometown Brisket). I think the Hometown Brisket was our favorite only because of the BBQ sauce. Other than that, there wasn't much brisket pieces on the pizza. Ricotta Be Kidding Me was okay. The Greenpointer was all greens so that balanced our meal a little bit. I hear people waiting for hours to get a seat here and right now I'm just wondering where all the hype went? We came when they were opening, so thank goodness we didn't wait on line for this...cause it wouldn't have been worth it. FYI: There's no sign outside that says ""Paulie Gee's"". You just have to look by the address number ""60"" in order to find this place. I actually walked passed it while we were trying to find it. Also, use your flash on your phones to read the menu. I really liked the rustic interior but it was literally pitch black in there.",3.0
"Zagat rated the hellboy as the best pizza in NYC. Wow! Big call Zagat... We had to try! We would say it was delicious... But I would have to say Marta is equal of not just ahead. We got here at 6:40 and had to wait over an hr to sit at the bar. When getting here service was prompt and food was great! We ordered the hellboy and the hellified porkpie white and I have to say it was fresh, full of flavor and great value. My only critique would be more hot suppressa on the hellified and take numbers at the door! It's a little unreasonable to ask people to wait 90 mins and not offer to call when table it ready. Either way it was great but probably won't be crossing the river to wait another 90 mins.",4.0
"If there was ever a restaurant that inspires the need for #PiDay (3.14) to be everyday, it is Paulie Gee's. The pizza is a true art, and every bite is important, from the center to the crust crust.  PG is located in pizza heaven, or right near the water on Greenpoint Ave if you want a Google Map friendly address.Read it on my blog: highclasstohighlifes.com…As you'll see below I'm constantly on the proscuitt of happiness but this time we went for a different ham, Canadian bacon, and on the Monte Cristo. You bet it counted towards happiness. This pizza combines maple syrup drizzle and gouda with the ham. Yes, yes and more yes. Paulie asked if we had butter on the crust...sadly, no. SO MUCH REGRET....that I'll be back in no time to try it. You'll notice on the menu that they have a brisket pizza that features Hometown BBQ -- I love this local BK collaboration. You can get sauced the other way too with Greenpoint local brews!Anyway, I have nearly eaten my way through the entire menu (still need to do a bit of adventuring on the vegan side, every time I get close, I just want meat...) and I have been very pleased with every slice thus far. Therefore my advice to you is go with the pizza that's toppings are most appealing...or grab a handful of friends and share, then you can try multiple pizzas!The man, who is not a myth, but definitely a legend is often found inside checking in on tables, ensuring quality control and getting to know the patrons. He loved my last Instagram post that did a little play words...sharing that I was on the prosciutt of happiness with his King Henry Classic. He's always all smiles and usually wearing a great hat, he is Paulie Gee himself. Paulie Gee's - High Class to High Lifes If you really knead to get delivery or pickup, you'll have to look elsewhere for now though. The only way to leave Paulie Gee's with a to-go box is with leftovers. Rumor has it that a slice joint is opening up nearby though! I'm counting down the days, hours and minutes. Want to keep drooling? Read the menu!Pro Tip: Grab dinner at Paulie Gee's then walk straight out on the water in Greenpoint to Transmitter park or the outlook. Maybe even catch a sunset and BYO night cap!",5.0
"My old pal Carlos and I visited Paulie Gee's last night and had a great meal. I'm accustomed to going with the ol' vegan girlfriend and have a tradition where we split two pies from their extensive vegan selection, so we can try two different types of pies. The vegan and non-vegan selections are both extensive; each category has at least a half dozen kinds of pies, including oil bases, white slices, marinara, spinach-based, spicy honey and barbecue sauce foundations. The pies are aesthetically pleasing to every sense, well, every sense except sound. It's usually better when sound isn't a factor. At least when you're talking about food. When you're talking about music, sound is obviously a very important sense to talk about. I may go as far as to say that in a conversation about music, sound is the only sense that matters.I was excited to go with Carlos because I was going to get to eat their meat and actual cheese. The Paulie Gee's brisket is lean and delicious. Their pickled red onions possess a truly memorable tang and are worth spending a couple buck to add on to pretty much any pie. The ricotta dollops on the Ricky Ricotta feel more like bursts of a cream sauce than regular old cheese. Interestingly, the dairy and non-dairy ricotta cheeses are almost indecipherable in quality, which goes to show that Paulie Gee's knows what's up. Carlos and I were pleased to compliment the trad Italian flavors of the Ricky Ricotta with a tangy Barbecue Brisket pie. I'm psyched to go with a fellow omnivore again, because there are tons of other flavor combos I'm eager to try. New Yorkers, such as myself, are notorious for being dicks about the quality of pizza dough. It's the dough that invalidates the Chicago Deep Dish's false aspiration to pizza status. I can't stand Sicilian pizza either, which is a controversial take in Nueva York. Anyhow, no matter how well adorned a Paulie Gee's pie is, its base--the crust--is its most distinct and wonderful element. The crust is thin but springy, and always a little charred. It's pretty much naan bread, which is either a very luck coincidence or a visionary innovation. Naan bread, as you know, is lit, and, as it turns out, it is the perfect surface upon which various pizza ingredients should be placed and/or spread to mingle harmoniously.I've visited Paulie Gee's a number of times, and there's a bit of narrative that forms around my visits. The first time I tried to go, it was around noon, and my gf and I made the unpleasant discovery that Paulie Gee's does not open til 5 PM. The next time, we rolled up in a deep crew of six and had to wait about two to three hours for a table for six. If you find yourself in that position, you'll be okay though because there are plenty of bars around. There's also the water/skyline, mere yards away and a nice record store a block away.The gf and I have gone a few other times and it's always been great--except for the one time that a camera crew was shooting a special on Paulie Gee's vegan options.

"New York probably takes its pizza more seriously than anywhere else in the world.  I'm sure there are 7 or 8 people reading this right now that would be willing to shiv a guy for saying something bad about their favorite slice.  With that in mind, Paulie Gee's is a pizza lover's pizza place.  They make Neapolitan style pizzas with an oven shipped in from Naples and lovingly reassembled by small, Italian elves.  From this oven, comes perfectly leopard-spotted pizzas with just the right amount of bouncy chewy dough.To top the pizza, there's a lovingly curated selection to choose from so don't you dare ask for substitutions.  Lucky for you whether you're a vegan, vegetarian, white/red pie lover, averse to spice, meat lover, or whatever!  There's at least one pie on the menu* that will make you say, ""hmmm..."".  My personal favorites are the Mo' Cheeks ($16, has guanciale and is perfect with the pickled onions) and Ricotta Be Kidding Me ($17, with tons of meat topped with adorable dollops of cottage cheese).  I've only ever had 1 pizza there that wasn't stellar and I won't tell you which one because you'll definitely judge me for choosing it in the first place.The atmosphere at Paulie Gee's is great.  It's quintessential Brooklyn.  Think dark unfinished wood walls with an eclectic collection of tables made from reclaimed wood, music consisting of a mixture of jazz, rock, and anything but top 40s.  What always makes my night is that the ACTUAL Paulie Gee walks around and talks to EVERYONE.  It doesn't matter if Keri Russell** is sitting right next to you, he will still come by and have a 5-20 minute conversation with you and your table.  My only complaint is how popular this place is.  They've stopped making pizzas to go and still, the wait is crazy.  I've never been able to get a table in less than 45 minutes unless it was late at night.  I guess that's not a bad problem to have.  I also kind of wish they would get a full liquor license and take that creative pizza combo creating mind into the cocktail realm.  I mean...Mike's Hot Honey + Whiskey?  Maybe?---------* If you can't find a pizza you like on the printed menu in the restaurant, whip out the smartphone and check out the ""secret"" menu on the website.** This actually happened.",4.0

"Some of the best za in the city, bar none. The lady and I traveled far and wide for it since we'd heard such great things. It was a Friday night so the restaurant was predictably packed. There's not much in the form of a waiting area, which particularly sucked given how freezing the weather was, but we had a feeling the pie would be well worth the wait (plus we also got to watch a tipsy couple aggressively suck face up close and personal which was an unexpected but enjoyable twist).The vibe was cool, featuring low--lighting, a huge and beautiful custom brick oven, and trendy attractive people who's favorite bands you've never heard of.When we finally were seated I was stoked to see the menu offered a huge variety of pies with all sorts of niche toppings AND vegan options(I personally don't give two damns about veganism but they presented them in an unpretentious way so I was cool with it).

"After a 2-hours wait on a weekend for a party of 2, we finally got a table at the renowned pizza shop in Brooklyn. After having one of the best pizzas of all time at Little Isabella located in Baltimore, I was on the mission to find its companion in NYC. Overhyped as we suspected, Paulie Gee had nothing on Little Isabella! Perhaps, it was the quirky blend of sweet and savory flavors, but with that 2-hour wait, we surely did not have a pleasing experience.We ordered two pies: HellBoy and Greenpointer. HellBoy: Fresh Mozzarella, Italian Tomatoes, Berkshire Sopressata Piccante, Parmigiano Reggiano and Mike's HOT HoneyGreenpointer:Fresh Mozzarella, Baby Arugula, Olive Oil, Fresh Lemon Juice and Shaved Parmigiano ReggianoWe didn't really enjoy the sweetness of the honey in the HellBoy or the sourness of the lemon juice in the Greenpointer. Fresh, as we saw them make each pie to order, I definitely thought the doughiness of the pizza wasn't anything spectacular. In terms of service, I think it was pretty solid. Our waiter was patient and helpful. As a surprise, Paulie Gee himself introduced himself to just about every table, making it feel quite personable. In all, I definitely wouldn't return back to this pizzeria, especially with that crazy wait. During that 2-hour wait and 1.5-hour dining time, I can drive down to Baltimore and get some Little Isabella for half the price and no wait!",3.0
"3.5 stars for this pizza joint hidden behind a HUGE wooden door all the way down Franklin streetCrust was good with a nice char on the hellboy but the crust of the greenpoint pizza seemed a bit underdone We were quoted a 1.5 hour wait at 8pm for 3 on a Saturday but we were lucky that people in front of us hadn't returned so we were seated right away! (so don't be discouraged)---hellboy: everything was good about this except that spicy honey! Should of gone with a more classic margherita style pizza instead---greenpoint: fresh arugula, with a bit too much lemon juice, so nothing special NOTE: they don't have pepper flakes, only chili oil",4.0
"If you want great pizza and the right atmosphere look no further than Paulie Gee's. We sat at the bar (luckily) and avoided a two hour wait.  The pizza choices are numerous, with some very creative options. There were three of us and we started with two pies. Would have been content but it was so good we ordered a third.The texture. The crust. The toppings. Hard pressed to mention anything I didn't like. I love pizza and this place is right up there with the best. That includes many pizzerias throughout Italy.Paulie stopped by for a chat and he has a fantastic personality. Great stories and it is obvious that he loves what he does and holds him team to very high standards.He was also kind enough to give me an official Paulie Gee's pin and a limoncello. A very nice touch!Make sure you check out the pizza oven in the back. It's a small,cozy place so don't pass this place up in you are in NY.",5.0
I take my pizza very seriously. The vegan pizza is so good here that if they didn't tell you it was vegan you would have no clue. I had the pie with vegan sausage and shared a few others with friends. It was all out of this world. I can't wait to go back again.,5.0
"There's a LOT of really great pizza in NYC, that's nothing new. But combine amazing pizza with friendly, caring service and a killer ambiance, and Paulie Gee's has a leg up on a lot of the other heavy hitters. The wait can be crazy, but we came in on a Tuesday night and it was half empty. I guess the key is to come when there's post-blizzard sludge everywhere and no one else wants to go out. Paulie Gee was there as I'm told he usually is, weaving around the space with his cup of coffee and stopping at literally every table. For us, he offered to curate our pizza order and who were we to argue? Read on for what Paulie Gee himself recommends:- The Greenpointer: according to Paulie, basically like eating a salad due to the piles of fresh baby arugula on top. - The Mo Cheeks: My personal favorite of the meal. The pickled onions on there are a nice surprise, and give a nice kick to the rest of the ingredients. - The Monte Cristo: OK, so this is probably something I would never think to order myself, but I'm glad it came out for us because it's actually super tasty. It comes with Canadian bacon and a drizzle of maple syrup, which I know sounds weird but trust me (or rather, trust Paulie). - I didn't catch the name of the last pizza, but it was one of the best and after peeking at the menu again I think it might have been the Hellboy. It was piled high with the tastiest Berkshire Sopressata, and it was perfect with the side of Mike's hot honey (which you haven't tried on pizza you must immediately). They asked if we wanted a dessert pizza but at that point we were stuffed to the gills. It was one of the best New York pizza experiences I've had so far, and the service is what really puts them above and beyond. I'm going to run for vice-president of the Paulie Gee fanclub soon!",5.0
"Came here a few days ago with my friend after work. Very dark inside, took some time for my eyeballs to adjust lol. We started off with some beers and then went with the Hellboy which was AMAZING. The hot honey makes a difference! Then we went with a vegan pie since neither one of us was particularly full. We ordered one with spinach, sea salt and garlic on it (sorry don't remember the name!) It was OK, not that memorable. The standout is by far Hellboy, the crust for both pizzas was SUPER THIN, firm and didn't fall apart on me. We both liked it. I took off a star for the spinach pie being nothing special and that it's a bit on the pricey side. Overall, I think I'll be back to try the other pizzas on the menu!",4.0
"Maybe we came on an off night, but we didn't care too much about the pizza and it was definitely not the best we've had. My friend wanted to celebrate her belated birthday at Paulie Gee's and so we did. We ordered 3 pies (Greenpointer, Ricotta Be Kidding Me, and The Hometown Brisket). I think the Hometown Brisket was our favorite only because of the BBQ sauce. Other than that, there wasn't much brisket pieces on the pizza. Ricotta Be Kidding Me was okay. The Greenpointer was all greens so that balanced our meal a little bit. I hear people waiting for hours to get a seat here and right now I'm just wondering where all the hype went? We came when they were opening, so thank goodness we didn't wait on line for this...cause it wouldn't have been worth it. FYI: There's no sign outside that says ""Paulie Gee's"". You just have to look by the address number ""60"" in order to find this place. I actually walked passed it while we were trying to find it. Also, use your flash on your phones to read the menu. I really liked the rustic interior but it was literally pitch black in there.",3.0
"Zagat rated the hellboy as the best pizza in NYC. Wow! Big call Zagat... We had to try! We would say it was delicious... But I would have to say Marta is equal of not just ahead. We got here at 6:40 and had to wait over an hr to sit at the bar. When getting here service was prompt and food was great! We ordered the hellboy and the hellified porkpie white and I have to say it was fresh, full of flavor and great value. My only critique would be more hot suppressa on the hellified and take numbers at the door! It's a little unreasonable to ask people to wait 90 mins and not offer to call when table it ready. Either way it was great but probably won't be crossing the river to wait another 90 mins.",4.0
"If there was ever a restaurant that inspires the need for #PiDay (3.14) to be everyday, it is Paulie Gee's. The pizza is a true art, and every bite is important, from the center to the crust crust.  PG is located in pizza heaven, or right near the water on Greenpoint Ave if you want a Google Map friendly address.Read it on my blog: highclasstohighlifes.com…As you'll see below I'm constantly on the proscuitt of happiness but this time we went for a different ham, Canadian bacon, and on the Monte Cristo. You bet it counted towards happiness. This pizza combines maple syrup drizzle and gouda with the ham. Yes, yes and more yes. Paulie asked if we had butter on the crust...sadly, no. SO MUCH REGRET....that I'll be back in no time to try it. You'll notice on the menu that they have a brisket pizza that features Hometown BBQ -- I love this local BK collaboration. You can get sauced the other way too with Greenpoint local brews!Anyway, I have nearly eaten my way through the entire menu (still need to do a bit of adventuring on the vegan side, every time I get close, I just want meat...) and I have been very pleased with every slice thus far. Therefore my advice to you is go with the pizza that's toppings are most appealing...or grab a handful of friends and share, then you can try multiple pizzas!The man, who is not a myth, but definitely a legend is often found inside checking in on tables, ensuring quality control and getting to know the patrons. He loved my last Instagram post that did a little play words...sharing that I was on the prosciutt of happiness with his King Henry Classic. He's always all smiles and usually wearing a great hat, he is Paulie Gee himself. Paulie Gee's - High Class to High Lifes If you really knead to get delivery or pickup, you'll have to look elsewhere for now though. The only way to leave Paulie Gee's with a to-go box is with leftovers. Rumor has it that a slice joint is opening up nearby though! I'm counting down the days, hours and minutes. Want to keep drooling? Read the menu!Pro Tip: Grab dinner at Paulie Gee's then walk straight out on the water in Greenpoint to Transmitter park or the outlook. Maybe even catch a sunset and BYO night cap!",5.0
"My old pal Carlos and I visited Paulie Gee's last night and had a great meal. I'm accustomed to going with the ol' vegan girlfriend and have a tradition where we split two pies from their extensive vegan selection, so we can try two different types of pies. The vegan and non-vegan selections are both extensive; each category has at least a half dozen kinds of pies, including oil bases, white slices, marinara, spinach-based, spicy honey and barbecue sauce foundations. The pies are aesthetically pleasing to every sense, well, every sense except sound. It's usually better when sound isn't a factor. At least when you're talking about food. When you're talking about music, sound is obviously a very important sense to talk about. I may go as far as to say that in a conversation about music, sound is the only sense that matters.I was excited to go with Carlos because I was going to get to eat their meat and actual cheese. The Paulie Gee's brisket is lean and delicious. Their pickled red onions possess a truly memorable tang and are worth spending a couple buck to add on to pretty much any pie. The ricotta dollops on the Ricky Ricotta feel more like bursts of a cream sauce than regular old cheese. Interestingly, the dairy and non-dairy ricotta cheeses are almost indecipherable in quality, which goes to show that Paulie Gee's knows what's up. Carlos and I were pleased to compliment the trad Italian flavors of the Ricky Ricotta with a tangy Barbecue Brisket pie. I'm psyched to go with a fellow omnivore again, because there are tons of other flavor combos I'm eager to try. New Yorkers, such as myself, are notorious for being dicks about the quality of pizza dough. It's the dough that invalidates the Chicago Deep Dish's false aspiration to pizza status. I can't stand Sicilian pizza either, which is a controversial take in Nueva York. Anyhow, no matter how well adorned a Paulie Gee's pie is, its base--the crust--is its most distinct and wonderful element. The crust is thin but springy, and always a little charred. It's pretty much naan bread, which is either a very luck coincidence or a visionary innovation. Naan bread, as you know, is lit, and, as it turns out, it is the perfect surface upon which various pizza ingredients should be placed and/or spread to mingle harmoniously.I've visited Paulie Gee's a number of times, and there's a bit of narrative that forms around my visits. The first time I tried to go, it was around noon, and my gf and I made the unpleasant discovery that Paulie Gee's does not open til 5 PM. The next time, we rolled up in a deep crew of six and had to wait about two to three hours for a table for six. If you find yourself in that position, you'll be okay though because there are plenty of bars around. There's also the water/skyline, mere yards away and a nice record store a block away.The gf and I have gone a few other times and it's always been great--except for the one time that a camera crew was shooting a special on Paulie Gee's vegan options. My girlfriend and I were in the shot all throughout our meal, and we were fighting (as subtly as possible) for the duration of our meal. I was taken aback and somewhat miffed when the producers of the show asked to do a talking head with us outside. The tension was palpable but they still insisted on interviewing us. I really do believe that you should foot the bill if you're going to interview someone for your television series or web series or gratuitously long Yelp review or whatever. At LEAST commission me to write a song for the soundtrack.In closing, I would like to offer a lil sum sum for the ladies. Are you interested in grandfatherly, charmingly blue collar, short men whose personalities closely resemble those of most Robert De Niro characters--but only in David O. Russel movies? If you do, and might want to be possibly hit on by a man of this caliber, you will love Paulie Gee's. At all times, Paulie Gee's eponymous Pizza Architect and Entrepreneur, Paulie Gee, stalks the narrow spaces between tables, checking in with customers--particularly of the reasonably attractive female demographic--and asks them how their food is, making small talk and thanking them for their patronage. I think this is cool. I would do the same if I were in his position, so don't take this the wrong way. Central to Paulie Gee's game is his ability to recommend a pizza place in seemingly every zip code on the planet and his inclination to tell you (the lady in question) the name of the dude who works there/owns the place, and to tell you (still the lady in question) to tell the dude (who owns the pizza place) to say that he (Paulie Gee) says hi. The Brotherhood of Pizza Mans is truly alive and well.",5.0

"I almost feel like it's blasphemy for not giving 5 stars. Finally made my way over here at Paulie Gees after way too long. Clearly this place is GPs staple so was excited to drop by on Wednesday night.There was no wait- very good. I had been worried about this so called 3x around 6:45pm to see how long it was before heading over. No one picked up and their answering service basically hangs up on you. I ordered the Daniela and he ordered the brisket pizza. Mine came out a good 7 minutes before his. I noticed immediately that about 40% of the crust was charred to the point of being inedible. To top that off, the spinach topping my pizza was the same. It was literally a black piece of ash and when I picked a leaf up or crumbled in my hands. The cheese blend was very good (mozzarella and Parmesan) but the pizza was just not good. To top it off, parts of the center were soggy and didn't hold the toppings when I grabbed a slice. When the brisket pizza came out a few minutes later I noticed immediately that it was cooked perfectly. The crust was edible and delicious. I was bummed that mine didn't come out this way especially since it seemed like a classic. All I can say is they probably put our orders in together and maybe his needed a little longer in the oven. Mine was most likely getting over cooked while his needed a few more minutes. Hence the gap in time between both of our orders coming out and the reason why mine was half done by the time his came out.I was really disappointed but the good thing to know is at least the brisket pizza was cooked well. I know there is a good meal at Paulie Gees but I feel like we were jipped.Also, great touch that Paulie himself came in to greet all the diners. He was super friendly and it brings a family quality to the place. This is maybe one of the main reasons I'd come back.",3.0
"Delicious!! Definitely made my top 3 favorite pizza  places (the others being robertas and best pizza). We've been meaning to come forever but the line is always so long. We were finally seated right away on a Friday night because we ran over as soon as they opened at 6pm. I would highly recommend this tactic to those of you who have been meaning to come and haven't been able to due to the wait -- the food will be worth it. We ordered the hellboy, ricotta be kidding me and the hot honey ice cream Sunday for dessert. The hellboy was our fave. It was basically a pepperoni pizza with hot honey lined under the cheese. I liked it more than the bees sting from Robertas but both are very good. All in all would highly recommend. As an extra plus Paulie Gee was hanging around today,though it seems like he does this quite often, going from table to table talking to the customers.",5.0
"My husband and I visited Paulie Gee's about two years ago and he still dreams of the Hellboy. This time we ordered the Hellboy and Cherry Jones.  The Hellboy was great but just a touch too sweet for me.  The hot honey adds a little kick but is definitely not too hot.  My husband will tell you it is the best pizza he has ever had (saying a lot since he was raised in the Bronx).  The Cherry Jones on the other hand was way too sweet for both of us.  I couldn't taste anything other then honey.  My husband embarrassed me by telling the waitress we didn't like it.  She offered us a replacement.  We ordered the Ricky Ricotta.  It was alright.  I was shocked because the ricotta was not warm.  The crust at Paulie Gee's is the perfect texture.  However, two of our three pizzas were too charred for my taste.  I must mention Paulie walks around all the tables to make sure everyone is enjoying.  Love it!  The restaurant is too dark and loud for my taste.",3.0
"Interesting decor, super dark inside and it was hard to read the menu. We were seated under one of the speakers, so I felt like an old person complaining about how loud the music was, but really, we came for the food. Split a salad and a Greenpointer pie, and neither disappointed. Both were served quickly, and the pie just exploded with flavor. The lemon kick was strong but not overwhelming, and the crust was perfection. Service was attentive, friendly, and efficient. Lots of menu choices for anything your palate is craving. Overall, a very good experience, and one I would look forward to enjoying again.",4.0

I take my pizza very seriously. The vegan pizza is so good here that if they didn't tell you it was vegan you would have no clue. I had the pie with vegan sausage and shared a few others with friends. It was all out of this world. I can't wait to go back again.,5.0
"There's a LOT of really great pizza in NYC, that's nothing new. But combine amazing pizza with friendly, caring service and a killer ambiance, and Paulie Gee's has a leg up on a lot of the other heavy hitters. The wait can be crazy, but we came in on a Tuesday night and it was half empty. I guess the key is to come when there's post-blizzard sludge everywhere and no one else wants to go out. Paulie Gee was there as I'm told he usually is, weaving around the space with his cup of coffee and stopping at literally every table. For us, he offered to curate our pizza order and who were we to argue? Read on for what Paulie Gee himself recommends:- The Greenpointer: according to Paulie, basically like eating a salad due to the piles of fresh baby arugula on top. - The Mo Cheeks: My personal favorite of the meal. The pickled onions on there are a nice surprise, and give a nice kick to the rest of the ingredients. - The Monte Cristo: OK, so this is probably something I would never think to order myself, but I'm glad it came out for us because it's actually super tasty. It comes with Canadian bacon and a drizzle of maple syrup, which I know sounds weird but trust me (or rather, trust Paulie). - I didn't catch the name of the last pizza, but it was one of the best and after peeking at the menu again I think it might have been the Hellboy. It was piled high with the tastiest Berkshire Sopressata, and it was perfect with the side of Mike's hot honey (which you haven't tried on pizza you must immediately). They asked if we wanted a dessert pizza but at that point we were stuffed to the gills. It was one of the best New York pizza experiences I've had so far, and the service is what really puts them above and beyond. I'm going to run for vice-president of the Paulie Gee fanclub soon!",5.0

It was OK, not that memorable. The standout is by far Hellboy, the crust for both pizzas was SUPER THIN, firm and didn't fall apart on me. We both liked it.

My friend wanted to celebrate her belated birthday at Paulie Gee's and so we did. We ordered 3 pies (Greenpointer, Ricotta Be Kidding Me, and The Hometown Brisket). I think the Hometown Brisket was our favorite only because of the BBQ sauce. Other than that, there wasn't much brisket pieces on the pizza. Ricotta Be Kidding Me was okay. The Greenpointer was all greens so that balanced our meal a little bit. I hear people waiting for hours to get a seat here and right now I'm just wondering where all the hype went? We came when they were opening, so thank goodness we didn't wait on line for this...cause it wouldn't have been worth it. FYI: There's no sign outside that says ""Paulie Gee's"".

"My old pal Carlos and I visited Paulie Gee's last night and had a great meal. I'm accustomed to going with the ol' vegan girlfriend and have a tradition where we split two pies from their extensive vegan selection, so we can try two different types of pies. The vegan and non-vegan selections are both extensive; each category has at least a half dozen kinds of pies, including oil bases, white slices, marinara, spinach-based, spicy honey and barbecue sauce foundations. The pies are aesthetically pleasing to every sense, well, every sense except sound. It's usually better when sound isn't a factor. At least when you're talking about food. When you're talking about music, sound is obviously a very important sense to talk about. I may go as far as to say that in a conversation about music, sound is the only sense that matters.I was excited to go with Carlos because I was going to get to eat their meat and actual cheese. The Paulie Gee's brisket is lean and delicious. Their pickled red onions possess a truly memorable tang and are worth spending a couple buck to add on to pretty much any pie. The ricotta dollops on the Ricky Ricotta feel more like bursts of a cream sauce than regular old cheese. Interestingly, the dairy and non-dairy ricotta cheeses are almost indecipherable in quality, which goes to show that Paulie Gee's knows what's up. Carlos and I were pleased to compliment the trad Italian flavors of the Ricky Ricotta with a tangy Barbecue Brisket pie. I'm psyched to go with a fellow omnivore again, because there are tons of other flavor combos I'm eager to try. New Yorkers, such as myself, are notorious for being dicks about the quality of pizza dough. It's the dough that invalidates the Chicago Deep Dish's false aspiration to pizza status. I can't stand Sicilian pizza either, which is a controversial take in Nueva York. Anyhow, no matter how well adorned a Paulie Gee's pie is, its base--the crust--is its most distinct and wonderful element. The crust is thin but springy, and always a little charred. It's pretty much naan bread, which is either a very luck coincidence or a visionary innovation. Naan bread, as you know, is lit, and, as it turns out, it is the perfect surface upon which various pizza ingredients should be placed and/or spread to mingle harmoniously.I've visited Paulie Gee's a number of times, and there's a bit of narrative that forms around my visits. The first time I tried to go, it was around noon, and my gf and I made the unpleasant discovery that Paulie Gee's does not open til 5 PM. The next time, we rolled up in a deep crew of six and had to wait about two to three hours for a table for six. If you find yourself in that position, you'll be okay though because there are plenty of bars around. There's also the water/skyline, mere yards away and a nice record store a block away.The gf and I have gone a few other times and it's always been great--except for the one time that a camera crew was shooting a special on Paulie Gee's vegan options. My girlfriend and I were in the shot all throughout our meal, and we were fighting (as subtly as possible) for the duration of our meal. I was taken aback and somewhat miffed when the producers of the show asked to do a talking head with us outside. The tension was palpable but they still insisted on interviewing us. I really do believe that you should foot the bill if you're going to interview someone for your television series or web series or gratuitously long Yelp review or whatever. At LEAST commission me to write a song for the soundtrack.In closing, I would like to offer a lil sum sum for the ladies. Are you interested in grandfatherly, charmingly blue collar, short men whose personalities closely resemble those of most Robert De Niro characters--but only in David O. Russel movies? If you do, and might want to be possibly hit on by a man of this caliber, you will love Paulie Gee's. At all times, Paulie Gee's eponymous Pizza Architect and Entrepreneur, Paulie Gee, stalks the narrow spaces between tables, checking in with customers--particularly of the reasonably attractive female demographic--and asks them how their food is, making small talk and thanking them for their patronage. I think this is cool. I would do the same if I were in his position, so don't take this the wrong way. Central to Paulie Gee's game is his ability to recommend a pizza place in seemingly every zip code on the planet and his inclination to tell you (the lady in question) the name of the dude who works there/owns the place, and to tell you (still the lady in question) to tell the dude (who owns the pizza place) to say that he (Paulie Gee) says hi. The Brotherhood of Pizza Mans is truly alive and well.",5.0

"I almost feel like it's blasphemy for not giving 5 stars. Finally made my way over here at Paulie Gees after way too long. Clearly this place is GPs staple so was excited to drop by on Wednesday night.There was no wait- very good. I had been worried about this so called 3x around 6:45pm to see how long it was before heading over. No one picked up and their answering service basically hangs up on you. I ordered the Daniela and he ordered the brisket pizza. Mine came out a good 7 minutes before his. I noticed immediately that about 40% of the crust was charred to the point of being inedible. To top that off, the spinach topping my pizza was the same. It was literally a black piece of ash and when I picked a leaf up or crumbled in my hands. The cheese blend was very good (mozzarella and Parmesan) but the pizza was just not good. To top it off, parts of the center were soggy and didn't hold the toppings when I grabbed a slice. When the brisket pizza came out a few minutes later I noticed immediately that it was cooked perfectly. The crust was edible and delicious. I was bummed that mine didn't come out this way especially since it seemed like a classic. All I can say is they probably put our orders in together and maybe his needed a little longer in the oven. Mine was most likely getting over cooked while his needed a few more minutes. Hence the gap in time between both of our orders coming out and the reason why mine was half done by the time his came out.I was really disappointed but the good thing to know is at least the brisket pizza was cooked well. I know there is a good meal at Paulie Gees but I feel like we were jipped.Also, great touch that Paulie himself came in to greet all the diners. He was super friendly and it brings a family quality to the place. This is maybe one of the main reasons I'd come back.",3.0
"Delicious!! Definitely made my top 3 favorite pizza  places (the others being robertas and best pizza). We've been meaning to come forever but the line is always so long. We were finally seated right away on a Friday night because we ran over as soon as they opened at 6pm. I would highly recommend this tactic to those of you who have been meaning to come and haven't been able to due to the wait -- the food will be worth it. We ordered the hellboy, ricotta be kidding me and the hot honey ice cream Sunday for dessert. The hellboy was our fave. It was basically a pepperoni pizza with hot honey lined under the cheese. I liked it more than the bees sting from Robertas but both are very good. All in all would highly recommend. As an extra plus Paulie Gee was hanging around today,though it seems like he does this quite often, going from table to table talking to the customers.",5.0
"My husband and I visited Paulie Gee's about two years ago and he still dreams of the Hellboy. This time we ordered the Hellboy and Cherry Jones.  The Hellboy was great but just a touch too sweet for me.  The hot honey adds a little kick but is definitely not too hot.  My husband will tell you it is the best pizza he has ever had (saying a lot since he was raised in the Bronx).  The Cherry Jones on the other hand was way too sweet for both of us.  I couldn't taste anything other then honey.  My husband embarrassed me by telling the waitress we didn't like it.  She offered us a replacement.  We ordered the Ricky Ricotta.  It was alright.  I was shocked because the ricotta was not warm.  The crust at Paulie Gee's is the perfect texture.  However, two of our three pizzas were too charred for my taste.  I must mention Paulie walks around all the tables to make sure everyone is enjoying.  Love it!  The restaurant is too dark and loud for my taste.",3.0
"Interesting decor, super dark inside and it was hard to read the menu. We were seated under one of the speakers, so I felt like an old person complaining about how loud the music was, but really, we came for the food. Split a salad and a Greenpointer pie, and neither disappointed. Both were served quickly, and the pie just exploded with flavor. The lemon kick was strong but not overwhelming, and the crust was perfection. Service was attentive, friendly, and efficient. Lots of menu choices for anything your palate is craving. Overall, a very good experience, and one I would look forward to enjoying again.",4.0
"New York probably takes its pizza more seriously than anywhere else in the world.  I'm sure there are 7 or 8 people reading this right now that would be willing to shiv a guy for saying something bad about their favorite slice.  With that in mind, Paulie Gee's is a pizza lover's pizza place.  They make Neapolitan style pizzas with an oven shipped in from Naples and lovingly reassembled by small, Italian elves.  From this oven, comes perfectly leopard-spotted pizzas with just the right amount of bouncy chewy dough.To top the pizza, there's a lovingly curated selection to choose from so don't you dare ask for substitutions.  Lucky for you whether you're a vegan, vegetarian, white/red pie lover, averse to spice, meat lover, or whatever!  There's at least one pie on the menu* that will make you say, ""hmmm..."".  My personal favorites are the Mo' Cheeks ($16, has guanciale and is perfect with the pickled onions) and Ricotta Be Kidding Me ($17, with tons of meat topped with adorable dollops of cottage cheese).  I've only ever had 1 pizza there that wasn't stellar and I won't tell you which one because you'll definitely judge me for choosing it in the first place.The atmosphere at Paulie Gee's is great.  It's quintessential Brooklyn.  Think dark unfinished wood walls with an eclectic collection of tables made from reclaimed wood, music consisting of a mixture of jazz, rock, and anything but top 40s.  What always makes my night is that the ACTUAL Paulie Gee walks around and talks to EVERYONE.  It doesn't matter if Keri Russell** is sitting right next to you, he will still come by and have a 5-20 minute conversation with you and your table.  My only complaint is how popular this place is.  They've stopped making pizzas to go and still, the wait is crazy.  I've never been able to get a table in less than 45 minutes unless it was late at night.  I guess that's not a bad problem to have.  I also kind of wish they would get a full liquor license and take that creative pizza combo creating mind into the cocktail realm.  I mean...Mike's Hot Honey + Whiskey?  Maybe?---------* If you can't find a pizza you like on the printed menu in the restaurant, whip out the smartphone and check out the ""secret"" menu on the website.** This actually happened.",4.0
"We've literally flown across the country to enjoy his pizza. It's that good! Walking in, the aroma of pizza cooking in a brick oven hits your nose.This is about time my stomach starts to growl. The vibe is flowing with positive energy, and the low lighting is flattering & sexy. The bar to the left is where you can order a beverage while you wait.  They have a decent beer selection. Wait times vary, but it's usually not as long as anticipated, and well worth the effort.Everyone, including the servers, seem happy to be there.Paulie Gee is the utmost host. He's always found time to come to our table with suggestions, stories, and the occasional limoncello, (his recipe of the celebratory cocktail).Talking with him, I've gathered that he makes the vegan pizza for the people, or demand for it, but he didn't seem interested in the cause.

"Absolutely delicious. Huge selection of pies - good for meatatarians, vegetarians, and even vegans. Wood fire oven delivers the signature light smoke and char. Dough is absolutely tender and springy. They even let the pizza rest afterwards so the cheese sets and you don't burn the crap out of your mouth.Hellboy- spicy pepperoni with hot honey. Absolute classic pizza. Hot honey perfectly blankets the spicy meat. Super simple, absolutely delicious. Get two, trust meRicotta/sausage pie - similar to one above, hot honey included.

"One of the challenges of  being vegan is getting your friends/family to be open to the idea of trying vegan food.I have never had Vegan Pizza before and I usually try to try a restaurant first before recommending to anyone especially a non vegan but I took a chance.When we first arrived we were having trouble picking something since everything was foreign to us. Someone sitting next to us saw our struggle and took us to try the  IN Ricotta Da Vegan so we did. AMAZING!! My non vegan date was impressed and I was so happy.Thanks Paulie Gee for making me looking good Whew! One pie (6 small slices) goes for 16 bucks .

"Some of the best za in the city, bar none. The lady and I traveled far and wide for it since we'd heard such great things. It was a Friday night so the restaurant was predictably packed. There's not much in the form of a waiting area, which particularly sucked given how freezing the weather was, but we had a feeling the pie would be well worth the wait (plus we also got to watch a tipsy couple aggressively suck face up close and personal which was an unexpected but enjoyable twist).The vibe was cool, featuring low--lighting, a huge and beautiful custom brick oven, and trendy attractive people who's favorite bands you've never heard of.When we finally were seated I was stoked to see the menu offered a huge variety of pies with all sorts of niche toppings AND vegan options(I personally don't give two damns about veganism but they presented them in an unpretentious way so I was cool with it). We eventually decided to go with the Hell Boy and the Prokypineapple, both of which were amazing, and I'm looking forward to going back and further chowing my way down the menu.Go here.",5.0
"After a 2-hours wait on a weekend for a party of 2, we finally got a table at the renowned pizza shop in Brooklyn. After having one of the best pizzas of all time at Little Isabella located in Baltimore, I was on the mission to find its companion in NYC. Overhyped as we suspected, Paulie Gee had nothing on Little Isabella! Perhaps, it was the quirky blend of sweet and savory flavors, but with that 2-hour wait, we surely did not have a pleasing experience.We ordered two pies: HellBoy and Greenpointer. HellBoy: Fresh Mozzarella, Italian Tomatoes, Berkshire Sopressata Piccante, Parmigiano Reggiano and Mike's HOT HoneyGreenpointer:Fresh Mozzarella, Baby Arugula, Olive Oil, Fresh Lemon Juice and Shaved Parmigiano ReggianoWe didn't really enjoy the sweetness of the honey in the HellBoy or the sourness of the lemon juice in the Greenpointer. Fresh, as we saw them make each pie to order, I definitely thought the doughiness of the pizza wasn't anything spectacular. In terms of service, I think it was pretty solid. Our waiter was patient and helpful. As a surprise, Paulie Gee himself introduced himself to just about every table, making it feel quite personable. In all, I definitely wouldn't return back to this pizzeria, especially with that crazy wait.

"My old pal Carlos and I visited Paulie Gee's last night and had a great meal. I'm accustomed to going with the ol' vegan girlfriend and have a tradition where we split two pies from their extensive vegan selection, so we can try two different types of pies. The vegan and non-vegan selections are both extensive; each category has at least a half dozen kinds of pies, including oil bases, white slices, marinara, spinach-based, spicy honey and barbecue sauce foundations. The pies are aesthetically pleasing to every sense, well, every sense except sound. It's usually better when sound isn't a factor. At least when you're talking about food. When you're talking about music, sound is obviously a very important sense to talk about. I may go as far as to say that in a conversation about music, sound is the only sense that matters.I was excited to go with Carlos because I was going to get to eat their meat and actual cheese. The Paulie Gee's brisket is lean and delicious. Their pickled red onions possess a truly memorable tang and are worth spending a couple buck to add on to pretty much any pie. The ricotta dollops on the Ricky Ricotta feel more like bursts of a cream sauce than regular old cheese. Interestingly, the dairy and non-dairy ricotta cheeses are almost indecipherable in quality, which goes to show that Paulie Gee's knows what's up. Carlos and I were pleased to compliment the trad Italian flavors of the Ricky Ricotta with a tangy Barbecue Brisket pie. I'm psyched to go with a fellow omnivore again, because there are tons of other flavor combos I'm eager to try. New Yorkers, such as myself, are notorious for being dicks about the quality of pizza dough. It's the dough that invalidates the Chicago Deep Dish's false aspiration to pizza status. I can't stand Sicilian pizza either, which is a controversial take in Nueva York. Anyhow, no matter how well adorned a Paulie Gee's pie is, its base--the crust--is its most distinct and wonderful element. The crust is thin but springy, and always a little charred. It's pretty much naan bread, which is either a very luck coincidence or a visionary innovation. Naan bread, as you know, is lit, and, as it turns out, it is the perfect surface upon which various pizza ingredients should be placed and/or spread to mingle harmoniously.I've visited Paulie Gee's a number of times, and there's a bit of narrative that forms around my visits. The first time I tried to go, it was around noon, and my gf and I made the unpleasant discovery that Paulie Gee's does not open til 5 PM. The next time, we rolled up in a deep crew of six and had to wait about two to three hours for a table for six. If you find yourself in that position, you'll be okay though because there are plenty of bars around. There's also the water/skyline, mere yards away and a nice record store a block away.The gf and I have gone a few other times and it's always been great--except for the one time that a camera crew was shooting a special on Paulie Gee's vegan options. My girlfriend and I were in the shot all throughout our meal, and we were fighting (as subtly as possible) for the duration of our meal. I was taken aback and somewhat miffed when the producers of the show asked to do a talking head with us outside. The tension was palpable but they still insisted on interviewing us. I really do believe that you should foot the bill if you're going to interview someone for your television series or web series or gratuitously long Yelp review or whatever.

"I almost feel like it's blasphemy for not giving 5 stars. Finally made my way over here at Paulie Gees after way too long. Clearly this place is GPs staple so was excited to drop by on Wednesday night.There was no wait- very good. I had been worried about this so called 3x around 6:45pm to see how long it was before heading over. No one picked up and their answering service basically hangs up on you. I ordered the Daniela and he ordered the brisket pizza. Mine came out a good 7 minutes before his. I noticed immediately that about 40% of the crust was charred to the point of being inedible. To top that off, the spinach topping my pizza was the same. It was literally a black piece of ash and when I picked a leaf up or crumbled in my hands. The cheese blend was very good (mozzarella and Parmesan) but the pizza was just not good. To top it off, parts of the center were soggy and didn't hold the toppings when I grabbed a slice. When the brisket pizza came out a few minutes later I noticed immediately that it was cooked perfectly. The crust was edible and delicious. I was bummed that mine didn't come out this way especially since it seemed like a classic. All I can say is they probably put our orders in together and maybe his needed a little longer in the oven. Mine was most likely getting over cooked while his needed a few more minutes. Hence the gap in time between both of our orders coming out and the reason why mine was half done by the time his came out.I was really disappointed but the good thing to know is at least the brisket pizza was cooked well. I know there is a good meal at Paulie Gees but I feel like we were jipped.Also, great touch that Paulie himself came in to greet all the diners. He was super friendly and it brings a family quality to the place. This is maybe one of the main reasons I'd come back.",3.0
"Delicious!! Definitely made my top 3 favorite pizza  places (the others being robertas and best pizza). We've been meaning to come forever but the line is always so long. We were finally seated right away on a Friday night because we ran over as soon as they opened at 6pm. I would highly recommend this tactic to those of you who have been meaning to come and haven't been able to due to the wait -- the food will be worth it. We ordered the hellboy, ricotta be kidding me and the hot honey ice cream Sunday for dessert. The hellboy was our fave. It was basically a pepperoni pizza with hot honey lined under the cheese. I liked it more than the bees sting from Robertas but both are very good. All in all would highly recommend. As an extra plus Paulie Gee was hanging around today,though it seems like he does this quite often, going from table to table talking to the customers.",5.0
"My husband and I visited Paulie Gee's about two years ago and he still dreams of the Hellboy. This time we ordered the Hellboy and Cherry Jones.  The Hellboy was great but just a touch too sweet for me.  The hot honey adds a little kick but is definitely not too hot.  My husband will tell you it is the best pizza he has ever had (saying a lot since he was raised in the Bronx).  The Cherry Jones on the other hand was way too sweet for both of us.  I couldn't taste anything other then honey.  My husband embarrassed me by telling the waitress we didn't like it.  She offered us a replacement.  We ordered the Ricky Ricotta.  It was alright.  I was shocked because the ricotta was not warm.  The crust at Paulie Gee's is the perfect texture.  However, two of our three pizzas were too charred for my taste.  I must mention Paulie walks around all the tables to make sure everyone is enjoying.  Love it!  The restaurant is too dark and loud for my taste.",3.0
"Interesting decor, super dark inside and it was hard to read the menu. We were seated under one of the speakers, so I felt like an old person complaining about how loud the music was, but really, we came for the food. Split a salad and a Greenpointer pie, and neither disappointed. Both were served quickly, and the pie just exploded with flavor. The lemon kick was strong but not overwhelming, and the crust was perfection. Service was attentive, friendly, and efficient. Lots of menu choices for anything your palate is craving. Overall, a very good experience, and one I would look forward to enjoying again.",4.0
"New York probably takes its pizza more seriously than anywhere else in the world.  I'm sure there are 7 or 8 people reading this right now that would be willing to shiv a guy for saying something bad about their favorite slice.  With that in mind, Paulie Gee's is a pizza lover's pizza place.  They make Neapolitan style pizzas with an oven shipped in from Naples and lovingly reassembled by small, Italian elves.  From this oven, comes perfectly leopard-spotted pizzas with just the right amount of bouncy chewy dough.To top the pizza, there's a lovingly curated selection to choose from so don't you dare ask for substitutions.  Lucky for you whether you're a vegan, vegetarian, white/red pie lover, averse to spice, meat lover, or whatever!  There's at least one pie on the menu* that will make you say, ""hmmm..."".  My personal favorites are the Mo' Cheeks ($16, has guanciale and is perfect with the pickled onions) and Ricotta Be Kidding Me ($17, with tons of meat topped with adorable dollops of cottage cheese).  I've only ever had 1 pizza there that wasn't stellar and I won't tell you which one because you'll definitely judge me for choosing it in the first place.The atmosphere at Paulie Gee's is great.  It's quintessential Brooklyn.  Think dark unfinished wood walls with an eclectic collection of tables made from reclaimed wood, music consisting of a mixture of jazz, rock, and anything but top 40s.  What always makes my night is that the ACTUAL Paulie Gee walks around and talks to EVERYONE.  It doesn't matter if Keri Russell** is sitting right next to you, he will still come by and have a 5-20 minute conversation with you and your table.  My only complaint is how popular this place is.  They've stopped making pizzas to go and still, the wait is crazy.  I've never been able to get a table in less than 45 minutes unless it was late at night.  I guess that's not a bad problem to have.  I also kind of wish they would get a full liquor license and take that creative pizza combo creating mind into the cocktail realm.  I mean...Mike's Hot Honey + Whiskey?  Maybe?---------* If you can't find a pizza you like on the printed menu in the restaurant, whip out the smartphone and check out the ""secret"" menu on the website.** This actually happened.",4.0
"We've literally flown across the country to enjoy his pizza. It's that good! Walking in, the aroma of pizza cooking in a brick oven hits your nose.This is about time my stomach starts to growl. The vibe is flowing with positive energy, and the low lighting is flattering & sexy. The bar to the left is where you can order a beverage while you wait.  They have a decent beer selection. Wait times vary, but it's usually not as long as anticipated, and well worth the effort.Everyone, including the servers, seem happy to be there.Paulie Gee is the utmost host. He's always found time to come to our table with suggestions, stories, and the occasional limoncello, (his recipe of the celebratory cocktail).Talking with him, I've gathered that he makes the vegan pizza for the people, or demand for it, but he didn't seem interested in the cause. The funky bathrooms can be a challenge to use when you've had one too many! VEGAN Pies we LOVE Simply RedVegan Tomato Sauce with Tomatoes, Olive Oil. Vidalia Onions, Garlic, Basil, Salt and PepperVegan Daniela SpinaciBaby Spinach, Olive Oil, Fresh Sliced Garlic, Mild Aleppo Chili Oil and Sea SaltIn Ricotta Da VeganVegan Tomato Sauce, House Made Vegan Sausage, Post-oven House Made Cashew Ricotta Dollops, Baby Arugula and Extra Virgin Olive OilWith many return visits, we've yet to have a negative experience.There has been noise over the years of Paulie Giannone opening a Portland outpost, but it has yet to materialize. Meanwhile, I'll dream of his pizza.",5.0
"Absolutely delicious. Huge selection of pies - good for meatatarians, vegetarians, and even vegans. Wood fire oven delivers the signature light smoke and char. Dough is absolutely tender and springy. They even let the pizza rest afterwards so the cheese sets and you don't burn the crap out of your mouth.Hellboy- spicy pepperoni with hot honey. Absolute classic pizza. Hot honey perfectly blankets the spicy meat. Super simple, absolutely delicious. Get two, trust meRicotta/sausage pie - similar to one above, hot honey included. However ricotta and sausage are a welcome addition. While chunks of roasted garlic are an excellent accentSo many other pies, go try them for yourself.Big lines, put your name down and go drink at browerij lane.

"One of the challenges of  being vegan is getting your friends/family to be open to the idea of trying vegan food.I have never had Vegan Pizza before and I usually try to try a restaurant first before recommending to anyone especially a non vegan but I took a chance.When we first arrived we were having trouble picking something since everything was foreign to us. Someone sitting next to us saw our struggle and took us to try the  IN Ricotta Da Vegan so we did. AMAZING!! My non vegan date was impressed and I was so happy.Thanks Paulie Gee for making me looking good Whew! One pie (6 small slices) goes for 16 bucks . Its small, nice ambiance I would say its a little darkI would go again!Menu like here ------ pauliegee.com/greenpoint… xoxoC.",4.0
"Some of the best za in the city, bar none. The lady and I traveled far and wide for it since we'd heard such great things. It was a Friday night so the restaurant was predictably packed. There's not much in the form of a waiting area, which particularly sucked given how freezing the weather was, but we had a feeling the pie would be well worth the wait (plus we also got to watch a tipsy couple aggressively suck face up close and personal which was an unexpected but enjoyable twist).The vibe was cool, featuring low--lighting, a huge and beautiful custom brick oven, and trendy attractive people who's favorite bands you've never heard of.When we finally were seated I was stoked to see the menu offered a huge variety of pies with all sorts of niche toppings AND vegan options(I personally don't give two damns about veganism but they presented them in an unpretentious way so I was cool with it). We eventually decided to go with the Hell Boy and the Prokypineapple, both of which were amazing, and I'm looking forward to going back and further chowing my way down the menu.Go here.",5.0
"After a 2-hours wait on a weekend for a party of 2, we finally got a table at the renowned pizza shop in Brooklyn. After having one of the best pizzas of all time at Little Isabella located in Baltimore, I was on the mission to find its companion in NYC. Overhyped as we suspected, Paulie Gee had nothing on Little Isabella! Perhaps, it was the quirky blend of sweet and savory flavors, but with that 2-hour wait, we surely did not have a pleasing experience.We ordered two pies: HellBoy and Greenpointer. HellBoy: Fresh Mozzarella, Italian Tomatoes, Berkshire Sopressata Piccante, Parmigiano Reggiano and Mike's HOT HoneyGreenpointer:Fresh Mozzarella, Baby Arugula, Olive Oil, Fresh Lemon Juice and Shaved Parmigiano ReggianoWe didn't really enjoy the sweetness of the honey in the HellBoy or the sourness of the lemon juice in the Greenpointer. Fresh, as we saw them make each pie to order, I definitely thought the doughiness of the pizza wasn't anything spectacular. In terms of service, I think it was pretty solid. Our waiter was patient and helpful. As a surprise, Paulie Gee himself introduced himself to just about every table, making it feel quite personable. In all, I definitely wouldn't return back to this pizzeria, especially with that crazy wait. During that 2-hour wait and 1.5-hour dining time, I can drive down to Baltimore and get some Little Isabella for half the price and no wait!",3.0
"3.5 stars for this pizza joint hidden behind a HUGE wooden door all the way down Franklin streetCrust was good with a nice char on the hellboy but the crust of the greenpoint pizza seemed a bit underdone We were quoted a 1.5 hour wait at 8pm for 3 on a Saturday but we were lucky that people in front of us hadn't returned so we were seated right away! (so don't be discouraged)---hellboy: everything was good about this except that spicy honey! Should of gone with a more classic margherita style pizza instead---greenpoint: fresh arugula, with a bit too much lemon juice, so nothing special NOTE: they don't have pepper flakes, only chili oil",4.0
"If you want great pizza and the right atmosphere look no further than Paulie Gee's. We sat at the bar (luckily) and avoided a two hour wait.  The pizza choices are numerous, with some very creative options. There were three of us and we started with two pies. Would have been content but it was so good we ordered a third.The texture. The crust. The toppings. Hard pressed to mention anything I didn't like. I love pizza and this place is right up there with the best. That includes many pizzerias throughout Italy.Paulie stopped by for a chat and he has a fantastic personality. Great stories and it is obvious that he loves what he does and holds him team to very high standards.He was also kind enough to give me an official Paulie Gee's pin and a limoncello. A very nice touch!Make sure you check out the pizza oven in the back. It's a small,cozy place so don't pass this place up in you are in NY.",5.0
I take my pizza very seriously. The vegan pizza is so good here that if they didn't tell you it was vegan you would have no clue. I had the pie with vegan sausage and shared a few others with friends. It was all out of this world. I can't wait to go back again.,5.0
"There's a LOT of really great pizza in NYC, that's nothing new. But combine amazing pizza with friendly, caring service and a killer ambiance, and Paulie Gee's has a leg up on a lot of the other heavy hitters. The wait can be crazy, but we came in on a Tuesday night and it was half empty. I guess the key is to come when there's post-blizzard sludge everywhere and no one else wants to go out. Paulie Gee was there as I'm told he usually is, weaving around the space with his cup of coffee and stopping at literally every table. For us, he offered to curate our pizza order and who were we to argue? Read on for what Paulie Gee himself recommends:- The Greenpointer: according to Paulie, basically like eating a salad due to the piles of fresh baby arugula on top. - The Mo Cheeks: My personal favorite of the meal. The pickled onions on there are a nice surprise, and give a nice kick to the rest of the ingredients. - The Monte Cristo: OK, so this is probably something I would never think to order myself, but I'm glad it came out for us because it's actually super tasty. It comes with Canadian bacon and a drizzle of maple syrup, which I know sounds weird but trust me (or rather, trust Paulie). - I didn't catch the name of the last pizza, but it was one of the best and after peeking at the menu again I think it might have been the Hellboy. It was piled high with the tastiest Berkshire Sopressata, and it was perfect with the side of Mike's hot honey (which you haven't tried on pizza you must immediately). They asked if we wanted a dessert pizza but at that point we were stuffed to the gills. It was one of the best New York pizza experiences I've had so far, and the service is what really puts them above and beyond. I'm going to run for vice-president of the Paulie Gee fanclub soon!",5.0
"Came here a few days ago with my friend after work. Very dark inside, took some time for my eyeballs to adjust lol. We started off with some beers and then went with the Hellboy which was AMAZING. The hot honey makes a difference! Then we went with a vegan pie since neither one of us was particularly full. We ordered one with spinach, sea salt and garlic on it (sorry don't remember the name!) It was OK, not that memorable. The standout is by far Hellboy, the crust for both pizzas was SUPER THIN, firm and didn't fall apart on me. We both liked it. I took off a star for the spinach pie being nothing special and that it's a bit on the pricey side. Overall, I think I'll be back to try the other pizzas on the menu!",4.0
"Maybe we came on an off night, but we didn't care too much about the pizza and it was definitely not the best we've had. My friend wanted to celebrate her belated birthday at Paulie Gee's and so we did. We ordered 3 pies (Greenpointer, Ricotta Be Kidding Me, and The Hometown Brisket). I think the Hometown Brisket was our favorite only because of the BBQ sauce. Other than that, there wasn't much brisket pieces on the pizza. Ricotta Be Kidding Me was okay. The Greenpointer was all greens so that balanced our meal a little bit. I hear people waiting for hours to get a seat here and right now I'm just wondering where all the hype went? We came when they were opening, so thank goodness we didn't wait on line for this...cause it wouldn't have been worth it. FYI: There's no sign outside that says ""Paulie Gee's"". You just have to look by the address number ""60"" in order to find this place. I actually walked passed it while we were trying to find it. Also, use your flash on your phones to read the menu. I really liked the rustic interior but it was literally pitch black in there.",3.0
"Zagat rated the hellboy as the best pizza in NYC. Wow! Big call Zagat... We had to try! We would say it was delicious... But I would have to say Marta is equal of not just ahead. We got here at 6:40 and had to wait over an hr to sit at the bar. When getting here service was prompt and food was great! We ordered the hellboy and the hellified porkpie white and I have to say it was fresh, full of flavor and great value. My only critique would be more hot suppressa on the hellified and take numbers at the door! It's a little unreasonable to ask people to wait 90 mins and not offer to call when table it ready. Either way it was great but probably won't be crossing the river to wait another 90 mins.",4.0

I would highly recommend this tactic to those of you who have been meaning to come and haven't been able to due to the wait -- the food will be worth it. We ordered the hellboy, ricotta be kidding me and the hot honey ice cream Sunday for dessert. The hellboy was our fave. It was basically a pepperoni pizza with hot honey lined under the cheese.

"My husband and I visited Paulie Gee's about two years ago and he still dreams of the Hellboy. This time we ordered the Hellboy and Cherry Jones.  The Hellboy was great but just a touch too sweet for me.  The hot honey adds a little kick but is definitely not too hot.  My husband will tell you it is the best pizza he has ever had (saying a lot since he was raised in the Bronx).  The Cherry Jones on the other hand was way too sweet for both of us.  I couldn't taste anything other then honey.  My husband embarrassed me by telling the waitress we didn't like it.  She offered us a replacement.  We ordered the Ricky Ricotta.  It was alright.  I was shocked because the ricotta was not warm.  The crust at Paulie Gee's is the perfect texture.  However, two of our three pizzas were too charred for my taste.  I must mention Paulie walks around all the tables to make sure everyone is enjoying.  Love it!  The restaurant is too dark and loud for my taste.",3.0

"Some of the best za in the city, bar none. The lady and I traveled far and wide for it since we'd heard such great things. It was a Friday night so the restaurant was predictably packed. There's not much in the form of a waiting area, which particularly sucked given how freezing the weather was, but we had a feeling the pie would be well worth the wait (plus we also got to watch a tipsy couple aggressively suck face up close and personal which was an unexpected but enjoyable twist).The vibe was cool, featuring low--lighting, a huge and beautiful custom brick oven, and trendy attractive people who's favorite bands you've never heard of.When we finally were seated I was stoked to see the menu offered a huge variety of pies with all sorts of niche toppings AND vegan options(I personally don't give two damns about veganism but they presented them in an unpretentious way so I was cool with it). We eventually decided to go with the Hell Boy and the Prokypineapple, both of which were amazing, and I'm looking forward to going back and further chowing my way down the menu.Go here.",5.0
"After a 2-hours wait on a weekend for a party of 2, we finally got a table at the renowned pizza shop in Brooklyn. After having one of the best pizzas of all time at Little Isabella located in Baltimore, I was on the mission to find its companion in NYC. Overhyped as we suspected, Paulie Gee had nothing on Little Isabella! Perhaps, it was the quirky blend of sweet and savory flavors, but with that 2-hour wait, we surely did not have a pleasing experience.We ordered two pies: HellBoy and Greenpointer. HellBoy: Fresh Mozzarella, Italian Tomatoes, Berkshire Sopressata Piccante, Parmigiano Reggiano and Mike's HOT HoneyGreenpointer:Fresh Mozzarella, Baby Arugula, Olive Oil, Fresh Lemon Juice and Shaved Parmigiano ReggianoWe didn't really enjoy the sweetness of the honey in the HellBoy or the sourness of the lemon juice in the Greenpointer. Fresh, as we saw them make each pie to order, I definitely thought the doughiness of the pizza wasn't anything spectacular. In terms of service, I think it was pretty solid. Our waiter was patient and helpful. As a surprise, Paulie Gee himself introduced himself to just about every table, making it feel quite personable. In all, I definitely wouldn't return back to this pizzeria, especially with that crazy wait. During that 2-hour wait and 1.5-hour dining time, I can drive down to Baltimore and get some Little Isabella for half the price and no wait!",3.0
"3.5 stars for this pizza joint hidden behind a HUGE wooden door all the way down Franklin streetCrust was good with a nice char on the hellboy but the crust of the greenpoint pizza seemed a bit underdone We were quoted a 1.5 hour wait at 8pm for 3 on a Saturday but we were lucky that people in front of us hadn't returned so we were seated right away! (so don't be discouraged)---hellboy: everything was good about this except that spicy honey! Should of gone with a more classic margherita style pizza instead---greenpoint: fresh arugula, with a bit too much lemon juice, so nothing special NOTE: they don't have pepper flakes, only chili oil",4.0
"If you want great pizza and the right atmosphere look no further than Paulie Gee's. We sat at the bar (luckily) and avoided a two hour wait.  The pizza choices are numerous, with some very creative options. There were three of us and we started with two pies. Would have been content but it was so good we ordered a third.The texture. The crust. The toppings. Hard pressed to mention anything I didn't like. I love pizza and this place is right up there with the best. That includes many pizzerias throughout Italy.Paulie stopped by for a chat and he has a fantastic personality. Great stories and it is obvious that he loves what he does and holds him team to very high standards.He was also kind enough to give me an official Paulie Gee's pin and a limoncello. A very nice touch!Make sure you check out the pizza oven in the back. It's a small,cozy place so don't pass this place up in you are in NY.",5.0
I take my pizza very seriously. The vegan pizza is so good here that if they didn't tell you it was vegan you would have no clue. I had the pie with vegan sausage and shared a few others with friends. It was all out of this world. I can't wait to go back again.,5.0
"There's a LOT of really great pizza in NYC, that's nothing new. But combine amazing pizza with friendly, caring service and a killer ambiance, and Paulie Gee's has a leg up on a lot of the other heavy hitters. The wait can be crazy, but we came in on a Tuesday night and it was half empty. I guess the key is to come when there's post-blizzard sludge everywhere and no one else wants to go out. Paulie Gee was there as I'm told he usually is, weaving around the space with his cup of coffee and stopping at literally every table. For us, he offered to curate our pizza order and who were we to argue? Read on for what Paulie Gee himself recommends:- The Greenpointer: according to Paulie, basically like eating a salad due to the piles of fresh baby arugula on top. - The Mo Cheeks: My personal favorite of the meal. The pickled onions on there are a nice surprise, and give a nice kick to the rest of the ingredients. - The Monte Cristo: OK, so this is probably something I would never think to order myself, but I'm glad it came out for us because it's actually super tasty. It comes with Canadian bacon and a drizzle of maple syrup, which I know sounds weird but trust me (or rather, trust Paulie). - I didn't catch the name of the last pizza, but it was one of the best and after peeking at the menu again I think it might have been the Hellboy. It was piled high with the tastiest Berkshire Sopressata, and it was perfect with the side of Mike's hot honey (which you haven't tried on pizza you must immediately). They asked if we wanted a dessert pizza but at that point we were stuffed to the gills. It was one of the best New York pizza experiences I've had so far, and the service is what really puts them above and beyond. I'm going to run for vice-president of the Paulie Gee fanclub soon!",5.0
"Came here a few days ago with my friend after work. Very dark inside, took some time for my eyeballs to adjust lol. We started off with some beers and then went with the Hellboy which was AMAZING. The hot honey makes a difference! Then we went with a vegan pie since neither one of us was particularly full. We ordered one with spinach, sea salt and garlic on it (sorry don't remember the name!) It was OK, not that memorable. The standout is by far Hellboy, the crust for both pizzas was SUPER THIN, firm and didn't fall apart on me. We both liked it. I took off a star for the spinach pie being nothing special and that it's a bit on the pricey side. Overall, I think I'll be back to try the other pizzas on the menu!",4.0
"Maybe we came on an off night, but we didn't care too much about the pizza and it was definitely not the best we've had. My friend wanted to celebrate her belated birthday at Paulie Gee's and so we did. We ordered 3 pies (Greenpointer, Ricotta Be Kidding Me, and The Hometown Brisket). I think the Hometown Brisket was our favorite only because of the BBQ sauce. Other than that, there wasn't much brisket pieces on the pizza. Ricotta Be Kidding Me was okay. The Greenpointer was all greens so that balanced our meal a little bit. I hear people waiting for hours to get a seat here and right now I'm just wondering where all the hype went? We came when they were opening, so thank goodness we didn't wait on line for this...cause it wouldn't have been worth it. FYI: There's no sign outside that says ""Paulie Gee's"". You just have to look by the address number ""60"" in order to find this place. I actually walked passed it while we were trying to find it. Also, use your flash on your phones to read the menu. I really liked the rustic interior but it was literally pitch black in there.",3.0
"Zagat rated the hellboy as the best pizza in NYC. Wow! Big call Zagat... We had to try! We would say it was delicious... But I would have to say Marta is equal of not just ahead. We got here at 6:40 and had to wait over an hr to sit at the bar. When getting here service was prompt and food was great! We ordered the hellboy and the hellified porkpie white and I have to say it was fresh, full of flavor and great value. My only critique would be more hot suppressa on the hellified and take numbers at the door! It's a little unreasonable to ask people to wait 90 mins and not offer to call when table it ready. Either way it was great but probably won't be crossing the river to wait another 90 mins.",4.0
"If there was ever a restaurant that inspires the need for #PiDay (3.14) to be everyday, it is Paulie Gee's. The pizza is a true art, and every bite is important, from the center to the crust crust.  PG is located in pizza heaven, or right near the water on Greenpoint Ave if you want a Google Map friendly address.Read it on my blog: highclasstohighlifes.com…As you'll see below I'm constantly on the proscuitt of happiness but this time we went for a different ham, Canadian bacon, and on the Monte Cristo. You bet it counted towards happiness. This pizza combines maple syrup drizzle and gouda with the ham. Yes, yes and more yes. Paulie asked if we had butter on the crust...sadly, no. SO MUCH REGRET....that I'll be back in no time to try it. You'll notice on the menu that they have a brisket pizza that features Hometown BBQ -- I love this local BK collaboration. You can get sauced the other way too with Greenpoint local brews!Anyway, I have nearly eaten my way through the entire menu (still need to do a bit of adventuring on the vegan side, every time I get close, I just want meat...) and I have been very pleased with every slice thus far. Therefore my advice to you is go with the pizza that's toppings are most appealing...or grab a handful of friends and share, then you can try multiple pizzas!The man, who is not a myth, but definitely a legend is often found inside checking in on tables, ensuring quality control and getting to know the patrons. He loved my last Instagram post that did a little play words...sharing that I was on the prosciutt of happiness with his King Henry Classic. He's always all smiles and usually wearing a great hat, he is Paulie Gee himself. Paulie Gee's - High Class to High Lifes If you really knead to get delivery or pickup, you'll have to look elsewhere for now though. The only way to leave Paulie Gee's with a to-go box is with leftovers. Rumor has it that a slice joint is opening up nearby though! I'm counting down the days, hours and minutes. Want to keep drooling? Read the menu!Pro Tip: Grab dinner at Paulie Gee's then walk straight out on the water in Greenpoint to Transmitter park or the outlook. Maybe even catch a sunset and BYO night cap!",5.0
"My old pal Carlos and I visited Paulie Gee's last night and had a great meal. I'm accustomed to going with the ol' vegan girlfriend and have a tradition where we split two pies from their extensive vegan selection, so we can try two different types of pies. The vegan and non-vegan selections are both extensive; each category has at least a half dozen kinds of pies, including oil bases, white slices, marinara, spinach-based, spicy honey and barbecue sauce foundations. The pies are aesthetically pleasing to every sense, well, every sense except sound. It's usually better when sound isn't a factor. At least when you're talking about food. When you're talking about music, sound is obviously a very important sense to talk about. I may go as far as to say that in a conversation about music, sound is the only sense that matters.I was excited to go with Carlos because I was going to get to eat their meat and actual cheese. The Paulie Gee's brisket is lean and delicious. Their pickled red onions possess a truly memorable tang and are worth spending a couple buck to add on to pretty much any pie. The ricotta dollops on the Ricky Ricotta feel more like bursts of a cream sauce than regular old cheese. Interestingly, the dairy and non-dairy ricotta cheeses are almost indecipherable in quality, which goes to show that Paulie Gee's knows what's up. Carlos and I were pleased to compliment the trad Italian flavors of the Ricky Ricotta with a tangy Barbecue Brisket pie. I'm psyched to go with a fellow omnivore again, because there are tons of other flavor combos I'm eager to try. New Yorkers, such as myself, are notorious for being dicks about the quality of pizza dough. It's the dough that invalidates the Chicago Deep Dish's false aspiration to pizza status. I can't stand Sicilian pizza either, which is a controversial take in Nueva York. Anyhow, no matter how well adorned a Paulie Gee's pie is, its base--the crust--is its most distinct and wonderful element. The crust is thin but springy, and always a little charred. It's pretty much naan bread, which is either a very luck coincidence or a visionary innovation. Naan bread, as you know, is lit, and, as it turns out, it is the perfect surface upon which various pizza ingredients should be placed and/or spread to mingle harmoniously.I've visited Paulie Gee's a number of times, and there's a bit of narrative that forms around my visits. The first time I tried to go, it was around noon, and my gf and I made the unpleasant discovery that Paulie Gee's does not open til 5 PM. The next time, we rolled up in a deep crew of six and had to wait about two to three hours for a table for six. If you find yourself in that position, you'll be okay though because there are plenty of bars around. There's also the water/skyline, mere yards away and a nice record store a block away.The gf and I have gone a few other times and it's always been great--except for the one time that a camera crew was shooting a special on Paulie Gee's vegan options. My girlfriend and I were in the shot all throughout our meal, and we were fighting (as subtly as possible) for the duration of our meal. I was taken aback and somewhat miffed when the producers of the show asked to do a talking head with us outside. The tension was palpable but they still insisted on interviewing us. I really do believe that you should foot the bill if you're going to interview someone for your television series or web series or gratuitously long Yelp review or whatever. At LEAST commission me to write a song for the soundtrack.In closing, I would like to offer a lil sum sum for the ladies. Are you interested in grandfatherly, charmingly blue collar, short men whose personalities closely resemble those of most Robert De Niro characters--but only in David O. Russel movies? If you do, and might want to be possibly hit on by a man of this caliber, you will love Paulie Gee's. At all times, Paulie Gee's eponymous Pizza Architect and Entrepreneur, Paulie Gee, stalks the narrow spaces between tables, checking in with customers--particularly of the reasonably attractive female demographic--and asks them how their food is, making small talk and thanking them for their patronage. I think this is cool. I would do the same if I were in his position, so don't take this the wrong way. Central to Paulie Gee's game is his ability to recommend a pizza place in seemingly every zip code on the planet and his inclination to tell you (the lady in question) the name of the dude who works there/owns the place, and to tell you (still the lady in question) to tell the dude (who owns the pizza place) to say that he (Paulie Gee) says hi. The Brotherhood of Pizza Mans is truly alive and well.",5.0

"I almost feel like it's blasphemy for not giving 5 stars. Finally made my way over here at Paulie Gees after way too long. Clearly this place is GPs staple so was excited to drop by on Wednesday night.There was no wait- very good. I had been worried about this so called 3x around 6:45pm to see how long it was before heading over. No one picked up and their answering service basically hangs up on you. I ordered the Daniela and he ordered the brisket pizza. Mine came out a good 7 minutes before his. I noticed immediately that about 40% of the crust was charred to the point of being inedible. To top that off, the spinach topping my pizza was the same. It was literally a black piece of ash and when I picked a leaf up or crumbled in my hands. The cheese blend was very good (mozzarella and Parmesan) but the pizza was just not good. To top it off, parts of the center were soggy and didn't hold the toppings when I grabbed a slice. When the brisket pizza came out a few minutes later I noticed immediately that it was cooked perfectly. The crust was edible and delicious. I was bummed that mine didn't come out this way especially since it seemed like a classic. All I can say is they probably put our orders in together and maybe his needed a little longer in the oven. Mine was most likely getting over cooked while his needed a few more minutes. Hence the gap in time between both of our orders coming out and the reason why mine was half done by the time his came out.I was really disappointed but the good thing to know is at least the brisket pizza was cooked well. I know there is a good meal at Paulie Gees but I feel like we were jipped.Also, great touch that Paulie himself came in to greet all the diners. He was super friendly and it brings a family quality to the place. This is maybe one of the main reasons I'd come back.",3.0

There's not much in the form of a waiting area, which particularly sucked given how freezing the weather was, but we had a feeling the pie would be well worth the wait (plus we also got to watch a tipsy couple aggressively suck face up close and personal which was an unexpected but enjoyable twist).The vibe was cool, featuring low--lighting, a huge and beautiful custom brick oven, and trendy attractive people who's favorite bands you've never heard of.When we finally were seated I was stoked to see the menu offered a huge variety of pies with all sorts of niche toppings AND vegan options(I personally don't give two damns about veganism but they presented them in an unpretentious way so I was cool with it). We eventually decided to go with the Hell Boy and the Prokypineapple, both of which were amazing, and I'm looking forward to going back and further chowing my way down the menu.Go here.",5.0
"After a 2-hours wait on a weekend for a party of 2, we finally got a table at the renowned pizza shop in Brooklyn. After having one of the best pizzas of all time at Little Isabella located in Baltimore, I was on the mission to find its companion in NYC. Overhyped as we suspected, Paulie Gee had nothing on Little Isabella! Perhaps, it was the quirky blend of sweet and savory flavors, but with that 2-hour wait, we surely did not have a pleasing experience.We ordered two pies: HellBoy and Greenpointer. HellBoy: Fresh Mozzarella, Italian Tomatoes, Berkshire Sopressata Piccante, Parmigiano Reggiano and Mike's HOT HoneyGreenpointer:Fresh Mozzarella, Baby Arugula, Olive Oil, Fresh Lemon Juice and Shaved Parmigiano ReggianoWe didn't really enjoy the sweetness of the honey in the HellBoy or the sourness of the lemon juice in the Greenpointer. Fresh, as we saw them make each pie to order, I definitely thought the doughiness of the pizza wasn't anything spectacular. In terms of service, I think it was pretty solid. Our waiter was patient and helpful. As a surprise, Paulie Gee himself introduced himself to just about every table, making it feel quite personable. In all, I definitely wouldn't return back to this pizzeria, especially with that crazy wait. During that 2-hour wait and 1.5-hour dining time, I can drive down to Baltimore and get some Little Isabella for half the price and no wait!",3.0
"3.5 stars for this pizza joint hidden behind a HUGE wooden door all the way down Franklin streetCrust was good with a nice char on the hellboy but the crust of the greenpoint pizza seemed a bit underdone We were quoted a 1.5 hour wait at 8pm for 3 on a Saturday but we were lucky that people in front of us hadn't returned so we were seated right away! (so don't be discouraged)---hellboy: everything was good about this except that spicy honey!

"If you want great pizza and the right atmosphere look no further than Paulie Gee's.

Would have been content but it was so good we ordered a third.The texture. The crust. The toppings. Hard pressed to mention anything I didn't like. I love pizza and this place is right up there with the best. That includes many pizzerias throughout Italy.Paulie stopped by for a chat and he has a fantastic personality. Great stories and it is obvious that he loves what he does and holds him team to very high standards.He was also kind enough to give me an official Paulie Gee's pin and a limoncello. A very nice touch!Make sure you check out the pizza oven in the back. It's a small,cozy place so don't pass this place up in you are in NY.",5.0
I take my pizza very seriously. The vegan pizza is so good here that if they didn't tell you it was vegan you would have no clue. I had the pie with vegan sausage and shared a few others with friends. It was all out of this world. I can't wait to go back again.,5.0
"There's a LOT of really great pizza in NYC, that's nothing new. But combine amazing pizza with friendly, caring service and a killer ambiance, and Paulie Gee's has a leg up on a lot of the other heavy hitters. The wait can be crazy, but we came in on a Tuesday night and it was half empty. I guess the key is to come when there's post-blizzard sludge everywhere and no one else wants to go out. Paulie Gee was there as I'm told he usually is, weaving around the space with his cup of coffee and stopping at literally every table. For us, he offered to curate our pizza order and who were we to argue? Read on for what Paulie Gee himself recommends:- The Greenpointer: according to Paulie, basically like eating a salad due to the piles of fresh baby arugula on top. - The Mo Cheeks: My personal favorite of the meal. The pickled onions on there are a nice surprise, and give a nice kick to the rest of the ingredients. - The Monte Cristo: OK, so this is probably something I would never think to order myself, but I'm glad it came out for us because it's actually super tasty. It comes with Canadian bacon and a drizzle of maple syrup, which I know sounds weird but trust me (or rather, trust Paulie). - I didn't catch the name of the last pizza, but it was one of the best and after peeking at the menu again I think it might have been the Hellboy. It was piled high with the tastiest Berkshire Sopressata, and it was perfect with the side of Mike's hot honey (which you haven't tried on pizza you must immediately). They asked if we wanted a dessert pizza but at that point we were stuffed to the gills. It was one of the best New York pizza experiences I've had so far, and the service is what really puts them above and beyond. I'm going to run for vice-president of the Paulie Gee fanclub soon!",5.0
"Came here a few days ago with my friend after work. Very dark inside, took some time for my eyeballs to adjust lol. We started off with some beers and then went with the Hellboy which was AMAZING. The hot honey makes a difference! Then we went with a vegan pie since neither one of us was particularly full. We ordered one with spinach, sea salt and garlic on it (sorry don't remember the name!) It was OK, not that memorable. The standout is by far Hellboy, the crust for both pizzas was SUPER THIN, firm and didn't fall apart on me. We both liked it. I took off a star for the spinach pie being nothing special and that it's a bit on the pricey side. Overall, I think I'll be back to try the other pizzas on the menu!",4.0
"Maybe we came on an off night, but we didn't care too much about the pizza and it was definitely not the best we've had. My friend wanted to celebrate her belated birthday at Paulie Gee's and so we did. We ordered 3 pies (Greenpointer, Ricotta Be Kidding Me, and The Hometown Brisket). I think the Hometown Brisket was our favorite only because of the BBQ sauce. Other than that, there wasn't much brisket pieces on the pizza. Ricotta Be Kidding Me was okay. The Greenpointer was all greens so that balanced our meal a little bit. I hear people waiting for hours to get a seat here and right now I'm just wondering where all the hype went? We came when they were opening, so thank goodness we didn't wait on line for this...cause it wouldn't have been worth it. FYI: There's no sign outside that says ""Paulie Gee's"". You just have to look by the address number ""60"" in order to find this place. I actually walked passed it while we were trying to find it. Also, use your flash on your phones to read the menu. I really liked the rustic interior but it was literally pitch black in there.",3.0
"Zagat rated the hellboy as the best pizza in NYC. Wow! Big call Zagat... We had to try! We would say it was delicious... But I would have to say Marta is equal of not just ahead. We got here at 6:40 and had to wait over an hr to sit at the bar. When getting here service was prompt and food was great! We ordered the hellboy and the hellified porkpie white and I have to say it was fresh, full of flavor and great value. My only critique would be more hot suppressa on the hellified and take numbers at the door! It's a little unreasonable to ask people to wait 90 mins and not offer to call when table it ready. Either way it was great but probably won't be crossing the river to wait another 90 mins.",4.0
"If there was ever a restaurant that inspires the need for #PiDay (3.14) to be everyday, it is Paulie Gee's. The pizza is a true art, and every bite is important, from the center to the crust crust.  PG is located in pizza heaven, or right near the water on Greenpoint Ave if you want a Google Map friendly address.Read it on my blog: highclasstohighlifes.com…As you'll see below I'm constantly on the proscuitt of happiness but this time we went for a different ham, Canadian bacon, and on the Monte Cristo. You bet it counted towards happiness. This pizza combines maple syrup drizzle and gouda with the ham. Yes, yes and more yes. Paulie asked if we had butter on the crust...sadly, no. SO MUCH REGRET....that I'll be back in no time to try it. You'll notice on the menu that they have a brisket pizza that features Hometown BBQ -- I love this local BK collaboration. You can get sauced the other way too with Greenpoint local brews!Anyway, I have nearly eaten my way through the entire menu (still need to do a bit of adventuring on the vegan side, every time I get close, I just want meat...) and I have been very pleased with every slice thus far. Therefore my advice to you is go with the pizza that's toppings are most appealing...or grab a handful of friends and share, then you can try multiple pizzas!The man, who is not a myth, but definitely a legend is often found inside checking in on tables, ensuring quality control and getting to know the patrons. He loved my last Instagram post that did a little play words...sharing that I was on the prosciutt of happiness with his King Henry Classic. He's always all smiles and usually wearing a great hat, he is Paulie Gee himself. Paulie Gee's - High Class to High Lifes If you really knead to get delivery or pickup, you'll have to look elsewhere for now though. The only way to leave Paulie Gee's with a to-go box is with leftovers. Rumor has it that a slice joint is opening up nearby though! I'm counting down the days, hours and minutes. Want to keep drooling? Read the menu!Pro Tip: Grab dinner at Paulie Gee's then walk straight out on the water in Greenpoint to Transmitter park or the outlook. Maybe even catch a sunset and BYO night cap!",5.0
"My old pal Carlos and I visited Paulie Gee's last night and had a great meal. I'm accustomed to going with the ol' vegan girlfriend and have a tradition where we split two pies from their extensive vegan selection, so we can try two different types of pies. The vegan and non-vegan selections are both extensive; each category has at least a half dozen kinds of pies, including oil bases, white slices, marinara, spinach-based, spicy honey and barbecue sauce foundations. The pies are aesthetically pleasing to every sense, well, every sense except sound. It's usually better when sound isn't a factor. At least when you're talking about food. When you're talking about music, sound is obviously a very important sense to talk about. I may go as far as to say that in a conversation about music, sound is the only sense that matters.I was excited to go with Carlos because I was going to get to eat their meat and actual cheese. The Paulie Gee's brisket is lean and delicious. Their pickled red onions possess a truly memorable tang and are worth spending a couple buck to add on to pretty much any pie. The ricotta dollops on the Ricky Ricotta feel more like bursts of a cream sauce than regular old cheese. Interestingly, the dairy and non-dairy ricotta cheeses are almost indecipherable in quality, which goes to show that Paulie Gee's knows what's up. Carlos and I were pleased to compliment the trad Italian flavors of the Ricky Ricotta with a tangy Barbecue Brisket pie. I'm psyched to go with a fellow omnivore again, because there are tons of other flavor combos I'm eager to try. New Yorkers, such as myself, are notorious for being dicks about the quality of pizza dough. It's the dough that invalidates the Chicago Deep Dish's false aspiration to pizza status. I can't stand Sicilian pizza either, which is a controversial take in Nueva York. Anyhow, no matter how well adorned a Paulie Gee's pie is, its base--the crust--is its most distinct and wonderful element. The crust is thin but springy, and always a little charred. It's pretty much naan bread, which is either a very luck coincidence or a visionary innovation. Naan bread, as you know, is lit, and, as it turns out, it is the perfect surface upon which various pizza ingredients should be placed and/or spread to mingle harmoniously.I've visited Paulie Gee's a number of times, and there's a bit of narrative that forms around my visits. The first time I tried to go, it was around noon, and my gf and I made the unpleasant discovery that Paulie Gee's does not open til 5 PM. The next time, we rolled up in a deep crew of six and had to wait about two to three hours for a table for six. If you find yourself in that position, you'll be okay though because there are plenty of bars around. There's also the water/skyline, mere yards away and a nice record store a block away.The gf and I have gone a few other times and it's always been great--except for the one time that a camera crew was shooting a special on Paulie Gee's vegan options. My girlfriend and I were in the shot all throughout our meal, and we were fighting (as subtly as possible) for the duration of our meal. I was taken aback and somewhat miffed when the producers of the show asked to do a talking head with us outside. The tension was palpable but they still insisted on interviewing us. I really do believe that you should foot the bill if you're going to interview someone for your television series or web series or gratuitously long Yelp review or whatever. At LEAST commission me to write a song for the soundtrack.In closing, I would like to offer a lil sum sum for the ladies. Are you interested in grandfatherly, charmingly blue collar, short men whose personalities closely resemble those of most Robert De Niro characters--but only in David O. Russel movies? If you do, and might want to be possibly hit on by a man of this caliber, you will love Paulie Gee's. At all times, Paulie Gee's eponymous Pizza Architect and Entrepreneur, Paulie Gee, stalks the narrow spaces between tables, checking in with customers--particularly of the reasonably attractive female demographic--and asks them how their food is, making small talk and thanking them for their patronage. I think this is cool. I would do the same if I were in his position, so don't take this the wrong way. Central to Paulie Gee's game is his ability to recommend a pizza place in seemingly every zip code on the planet and his inclination to tell you (the lady in question) the name of the dude who works there/owns the place, and to tell you (still the lady in question) to tell the dude (who owns the pizza place) to say that he (Paulie Gee) says hi. The Brotherhood of Pizza Mans is truly alive and well.",5.0

"I almost feel like it's blasphemy for not giving 5 stars. Finally made my way over here at Paulie Gees after way too long. Clearly this place is GPs staple so was excited to drop by on Wednesday night.There was no wait- very good. I had been worried about this so called 3x around 6:45pm to see how long it was before heading over. No one picked up and their answering service basically hangs up on you. I ordered the Daniela and he ordered the brisket pizza. Mine came out a good 7 minutes before his. I noticed immediately that about 40% of the crust was charred to the point of being inedible. To top that off, the spinach topping my pizza was the same. It was literally a black piece of ash and when I picked a leaf up or crumbled in my hands. The cheese blend was very good (mozzarella and Parmesan) but the pizza was just not good. To top it off, parts of the center were soggy and didn't hold the toppings when I grabbed a slice. When the brisket pizza came out a few minutes later I noticed immediately that it was cooked perfectly. The crust was edible and delicious. I was bummed that mine didn't come out this way especially since it seemed like a classic. All I can say is they probably put our orders in together and maybe his needed a little longer in the oven. Mine was most likely getting over cooked while his needed a few more minutes. Hence the gap in time between both of our orders coming out and the reason why mine was half done by the time his came out.I was really disappointed but the good thing to know is at least the brisket pizza was cooked well. I know there is a good meal at Paulie Gees but I feel like we were jipped.Also, great touch that Paulie himself came in to greet all the diners. He was super friendly and it brings a family quality to the place. This is maybe one of the main reasons I'd come back.",3.0
"Delicious!! Definitely made my top 3 favorite pizza  places (the others being robertas and best pizza). We've been meaning to come forever but the line is always so long. We were finally seated right away on a Friday night because we ran over as soon as they opened at 6pm. I would highly recommend this tactic to those of you who have been meaning to come and haven't been able to due to the wait -- the food will be worth it. We ordered the hellboy, ricotta be kidding me and the hot honey ice cream Sunday for dessert. The hellboy was our fave. It was basically a pepperoni pizza with hot honey lined under the cheese. I liked it more than the bees sting from Robertas but both are very good. All in all would highly recommend. As an extra plus Paulie Gee was hanging around today,though it seems like he does this quite often, going from table to table talking to the customers.",5.0
"My husband and I visited Paulie Gee's about two years ago and he still dreams of the Hellboy. This time we ordered the Hellboy and Cherry Jones.  The Hellboy was great but just a touch too sweet for me.  The hot honey adds a little kick but is definitely not too hot.  My husband will tell you it is the best pizza he has ever had (saying a lot since he was raised in the Bronx).  The Cherry Jones on the other hand was way too sweet for both of us.  I couldn't taste anything other then honey.  My husband embarrassed me by telling the waitress we didn't like it.  She offered us a replacement.  We ordered the Ricky Ricotta.  It was alright.  I was shocked because the ricotta was not warm.  The crust at Paulie Gee's is the perfect texture.  However, two of our three pizzas were too charred for my taste.  I must mention Paulie walks around all the tables to make sure everyone is enjoying.  Love it!  The restaurant is too dark and loud for my taste.",3.0
"Interesting decor, super dark inside and it was hard to read the menu. We were seated under one of the speakers, so I felt like an old person complaining about how loud the music was, but really, we came for the food. Split a salad and a Greenpointer pie, and neither disappointed. Both were served quickly, and the pie just exploded with flavor. The lemon kick was strong but not overwhelming, and the crust was perfection. Service was attentive, friendly, and efficient. Lots of menu choices for anything your palate is craving. Overall, a very good experience, and one I would look forward to enjoying again.",4.0
"New York probably takes its pizza more seriously than anywhere else in the world.  I'm sure there are 7 or 8 people reading this right now that would be willing to shiv a guy for saying something bad about their favorite slice.  With that in mind, Paulie Gee's is a pizza lover's pizza place.  They make Neapolitan style pizzas with an oven shipped in from Naples and lovingly reassembled by small, Italian elves.  From this oven, comes perfectly leopard-spotted pizzas with just the right amount of bouncy chewy dough.To top the pizza, there's a lovingly curated selection to choose from so don't you dare ask for substitutions.  Lucky for you whether you're a vegan, vegetarian, white/red pie lover, averse to spice, meat lover, or whatever!  There's at least one pie on the menu* that will make you say, ""hmmm..."".  My personal favorites are the Mo' Cheeks ($16, has guanciale and is perfect with the pickled onions) and Ricotta Be Kidding Me ($17, with tons of meat topped with adorable dollops of cottage cheese).  I've only ever had 1 pizza there that wasn't stellar and I won't tell you which one because you'll definitely judge me for choosing it in the first place.The atmosphere at Paulie Gee's is great.  It's quintessential Brooklyn.  Think dark unfinished wood walls with an eclectic collection of tables made from reclaimed wood, music consisting of a mixture of jazz, rock, and anything but top 40s.  What always makes my night is that the ACTUAL Paulie Gee walks around and talks to EVERYONE.  It doesn't matter if Keri Russell** is sitting right next to you, he will still come by and have a 5-20 minute conversation with you and your table.  My only complaint is how popular this place is.  They've stopped making pizzas to go and still, the wait is crazy.  I've never been able to get a table in less than 45 minutes unless it was late at night.  I guess that's not a bad problem to have.  I also kind of wish they would get a full liquor license and take that creative pizza combo creating mind into the cocktail realm.  I mean...Mike's Hot Honey + Whiskey?  Maybe?---------* If you can't find a pizza you like on the printed menu in the restaurant, whip out the smartphone and check out the ""secret"" menu on the website.** This actually happened.",4.0
"We've literally flown across the country to enjoy his pizza. It's that good! Walking in, the aroma of pizza cooking in a brick oven hits your nose.This is about time my stomach starts to growl. The vibe is flowing with positive energy, and the low lighting is flattering & sexy. The bar to the left is where you can order a beverage while you wait.  They have a decent beer selection. Wait times vary, but it's usually not as long as anticipated, and well worth the effort.Everyone, including the servers, seem happy to be there.Paulie Gee is the utmost host. He's always found time to come to our table with suggestions, stories, and the occasional limoncello, (his recipe of the celebratory cocktail).Talking with him, I've gathered that he makes the vegan pizza for the people, or demand for it, but he didn't seem interested in the cause.

"Absolutely delicious. Huge selection of pies - good for meatatarians, vegetarians, and even vegans. Wood fire oven delivers the signature light smoke and char. Dough is absolutely tender and springy. They even let the pizza rest afterwards so the cheese sets and you don't burn the crap out of your mouth.Hellboy- spicy pepperoni with hot honey. Absolute classic pizza. Hot honey perfectly blankets the spicy meat. Super simple, absolutely delicious. Get two, trust meRicotta/sausage pie - similar to one above, hot honey included. However ricotta and sausage are a welcome addition.

Someone sitting next to us saw our struggle and took us to try the  IN Ricotta Da Vegan so we did. AMAZING!!

"My old pal Carlos and I visited Paulie Gee's last night and had a great meal. I'm accustomed to going with the ol' vegan girlfriend and have a tradition where we split two pies from their extensive vegan selection, so we can try two different types of pies. The vegan and non-vegan selections are both extensive; each category has at least a half dozen kinds of pies, including oil bases, white slices, marinara, spinach-based, spicy honey and barbecue sauce foundations. The pies are aesthetically pleasing to every sense, well, every sense except sound. It's usually better when sound isn't a factor. At least when you're talking about food. When you're talking about music, sound is obviously a very important sense to talk about. I may go as far as to say that in a conversation about music, sound is the only sense that matters.I was excited to go with Carlos because I was going to get to eat their meat and actual cheese. The Paulie Gee's brisket is lean and delicious. Their pickled red onions possess a truly memorable tang and are worth spending a couple buck to add on to pretty much any pie. The ricotta dollops on the Ricky Ricotta feel more like bursts of a cream sauce than regular old cheese. Interestingly, the dairy and non-dairy ricotta cheeses are almost indecipherable in quality, which goes to show that Paulie Gee's knows what's up. Carlos and I were pleased to compliment the trad Italian flavors of the Ricky Ricotta with a tangy Barbecue Brisket pie. I'm psyched to go with a fellow omnivore again, because there are tons of other flavor combos I'm eager to try. New Yorkers, such as myself, are notorious for being dicks about the quality of pizza dough. It's the dough that invalidates the Chicago Deep Dish's false aspiration to pizza status. I can't stand Sicilian pizza either, which is a controversial take in Nueva York. Anyhow, no matter how well adorned a Paulie Gee's pie is, its base--the crust--is its most distinct and wonderful element. The crust is thin but springy, and always a little charred. It's pretty much naan bread, which is either a very luck coincidence or a visionary innovation. Naan bread, as you know, is lit, and, as it turns out, it is the perfect surface upon which various pizza ingredients should be placed and/or spread to mingle harmoniously.I've visited Paulie Gee's a number of times, and there's a bit of narrative that forms around my visits. The first time I tried to go, it was around noon, and my gf and I made the unpleasant discovery that Paulie Gee's does not open til 5 PM. The next time, we rolled up in a deep crew of six and had to wait about two to three hours for a table for six. If you find yourself in that position, you'll be okay though because there are plenty of bars around. There's also the water/skyline, mere yards away and a nice record store a block away.The gf and I have gone a few other times and it's always been great--except for the one time that a camera crew was shooting a special on Paulie Gee's vegan options. My girlfriend and I were in the shot all throughout our meal, and we were fighting (as subtly as possible) for the duration of our meal. I was taken aback and somewhat miffed when the producers of the show asked to do a talking head with us outside. The tension was palpable but they still insisted on interviewing us. I really do believe that you should foot the bill if you're going to interview someone for your television series or web series or gratuitously long Yelp review or whatever.

"I almost feel like it's blasphemy for not giving 5 stars. Finally made my way over here at Paulie Gees after way too long. Clearly this place is GPs staple so was excited to drop by on Wednesday night.There was no wait- very good. I had been worried about this so called 3x around 6:45pm to see how long it was before heading over. No one picked up and their answering service basically hangs up on you. I ordered the Daniela and he ordered the brisket pizza. Mine came out a good 7 minutes before his. I noticed immediately that about 40% of the crust was charred to the point of being inedible. To top that off, the spinach topping my pizza was the same. It was literally a black piece of ash and when I picked a leaf up or crumbled in my hands. The cheese blend was very good (mozzarella and Parmesan) but the pizza was just not good. To top it off, parts of the center were soggy and didn't hold the toppings when I grabbed a slice. When the brisket pizza came out a few minutes later I noticed immediately that it was cooked perfectly. The crust was edible and delicious. I was bummed that mine didn't come out this way especially since it seemed like a classic. All I can say is they probably put our orders in together and maybe his needed a little longer in the oven. Mine was most likely getting over cooked while his needed a few more minutes. Hence the gap in time between both of our orders coming out and the reason why mine was half done by the time his came out.I was really disappointed but the good thing to know is at least the brisket pizza was cooked well. I know there is a good meal at Paulie Gees but I feel like we were jipped.Also, great touch that Paulie himself came in to greet all the diners. He was super friendly and it brings a family quality to the place. This is maybe one of the main reasons I'd come back.",3.0
"Delicious!! Definitely made my top 3 favorite pizza  places (the others being robertas and best pizza). We've been meaning to come forever but the line is always so long. We were finally seated right away on a Friday night because we ran over as soon as they opened at 6pm. I would highly recommend this tactic to those of you who have been meaning to come and haven't been able to due to the wait -- the food will be worth it. We ordered the hellboy, ricotta be kidding me and the hot honey ice cream Sunday for dessert. The hellboy was our fave. It was basically a pepperoni pizza with hot honey lined under the cheese. I liked it more than the bees sting from Robertas but both are very good. All in all would highly recommend. As an extra plus Paulie Gee was hanging around today,though it seems like he does this quite often, going from table to table talking to the customers.",5.0
"My husband and I visited Paulie Gee's about two years ago and he still dreams of the Hellboy. This time we ordered the Hellboy and Cherry Jones.  The Hellboy was great but just a touch too sweet for me.  The hot honey adds a little kick but is definitely not too hot.  My husband will tell you it is the best pizza he has ever had (saying a lot since he was raised in the Bronx).  The Cherry Jones on the other hand was way too sweet for both of us.  I couldn't taste anything other then honey.  My husband embarrassed me by telling the waitress we didn't like it.  She offered us a replacement.  We ordered the Ricky Ricotta.  It was alright.  I was shocked because the ricotta was not warm.  The crust at Paulie Gee's is the perfect texture.  However, two of our three pizzas were too charred for my taste.  I must mention Paulie walks around all the tables to make sure everyone is enjoying.  Love it!  The restaurant is too dark and loud for my taste.",3.0
"Interesting decor, super dark inside and it was hard to read the menu. We were seated under one of the speakers, so I felt like an old person complaining about how loud the music was, but really, we came for the food. Split a salad and a Greenpointer pie, and neither disappointed. Both were served quickly, and the pie just exploded with flavor. The lemon kick was strong but not overwhelming, and the crust was perfection. Service was attentive, friendly, and efficient. Lots of menu choices for anything your palate is craving. Overall, a very good experience, and one I would look forward to enjoying again.",4.0
"New York probably takes its pizza more seriously than anywhere else in the world.  I'm sure there are 7 or 8 people reading this right now that would be willing to shiv a guy for saying something bad about their favorite slice.  With that in mind, Paulie Gee's is a pizza lover's pizza place.  They make Neapolitan style pizzas with an oven shipped in from Naples and lovingly reassembled by small, Italian elves.  From this oven, comes perfectly leopard-spotted pizzas with just the right amount of bouncy chewy dough.To top the pizza, there's a lovingly curated selection to choose from so don't you dare ask for substitutions.  Lucky for you whether you're a vegan, vegetarian, white/red pie lover, averse to spice, meat lover, or whatever!  There's at least one pie on the menu* that will make you say, ""hmmm..."".  My personal favorites are the Mo' Cheeks ($16, has guanciale and is perfect with the pickled onions) and Ricotta Be Kidding Me ($17, with tons of meat topped with adorable dollops of cottage cheese).  I've only ever had 1 pizza there that wasn't stellar and I won't tell you which one because you'll definitely judge me for choosing it in the first place.The atmosphere at Paulie Gee's is great.  It's quintessential Brooklyn.  Think dark unfinished wood walls with an eclectic collection of tables made from reclaimed wood, music consisting of a mixture of jazz, rock, and anything but top 40s.  What always makes my night is that the ACTUAL Paulie Gee walks around and talks to EVERYONE.  It doesn't matter if Keri Russell** is sitting right next to you, he will still come by and have a 5-20 minute conversation with you and your table.  My only complaint is how popular this place is.  They've stopped making pizzas to go and still, the wait is crazy.  I've never been able to get a table in less than 45 minutes unless it was late at night.  I guess that's not a bad problem to have.  I also kind of wish they would get a full liquor license and take that creative pizza combo creating mind into the cocktail realm.  I mean...Mike's Hot Honey + Whiskey?  Maybe?---------* If you can't find a pizza you like on the printed menu in the restaurant, whip out the smartphone and check out the ""secret"" menu on the website.** This actually happened.",4.0
"We've literally flown across the country to enjoy his pizza. It's that good! Walking in, the aroma of pizza cooking in a brick oven hits your nose.This is about time my stomach starts to growl. The vibe is flowing with positive energy, and the low lighting is flattering & sexy. The bar to the left is where you can order a beverage while you wait.  They have a decent beer selection. Wait times vary, but it's usually not as long as anticipated, and well worth the effort.Everyone, including the servers, seem happy to be there.Paulie Gee is the utmost host. He's always found time to come to our table with suggestions, stories, and the occasional limoncello, (his recipe of the celebratory cocktail).Talking with him, I've gathered that he makes the vegan pizza for the people, or demand for it, but he didn't seem interested in the cause. The funky bathrooms can be a challenge to use when you've had one too many! VEGAN Pies we LOVE Simply RedVegan Tomato Sauce with Tomatoes, Olive Oil.

"Absolutely delicious. Huge selection of pies - good for meatatarians, vegetarians, and even vegans. Wood fire oven delivers the signature light smoke and char. Dough is absolutely tender and springy. They even let the pizza rest afterwards so the cheese sets and you don't burn the crap out of your mouth.Hellboy- spicy pepperoni with hot honey. Absolute classic pizza. Hot honey perfectly blankets the spicy meat. Super simple, absolutely delicious. Get two, trust meRicotta/sausage pie - similar to one above, hot honey included. However ricotta and sausage are a welcome addition. While chunks of roasted garlic are an excellent accentSo many other pies, go try them for yourself.Big lines, put your name down and go drink at browerij lane.

"One of the challenges of  being vegan is getting your friends/family to be open to the idea of trying vegan food.I have never had Vegan Pizza before and I usually try to try a restaurant first before recommending to anyone especially a non vegan but I took a chance.When we first arrived we were having trouble picking something since everything was foreign to us. Someone sitting next to us saw our struggle and took us to try the  IN Ricotta Da Vegan so we did. AMAZING!! My non vegan date was impressed and I was so happy.Thanks Paulie Gee for making me looking good Whew! One pie (6 small slices) goes for 16 bucks . Its small, nice ambiance I would say its a little darkI would go again!Menu like here ------ pauliegee.com/greenpoint… xoxoC.",4.0
"Some of the best za in the city, bar none. The lady and I traveled far and wide for it since we'd heard such great things. It was a Friday night so the restaurant was predictably packed. There's not much in the form of a waiting area, which particularly sucked given how freezing the weather was, but we had a feeling the pie would be well worth the wait (plus we also got to watch a tipsy couple aggressively suck face up close and personal which was an unexpected but enjoyable twist).The vibe was cool, featuring low--lighting, a huge and beautiful custom brick oven, and trendy attractive people who's favorite bands you've never heard of.When we finally were seated I was stoked to see the menu offered a huge variety of pies with all sorts of niche toppings AND vegan options(I personally don't give two damns about veganism but they presented them in an unpretentious way so I was cool with it). We eventually decided to go with the Hell Boy and the Prokypineapple, both of which were amazing, and I'm looking forward to going back and further chowing my way down the menu.Go here.",5.0
"After a 2-hours wait on a weekend for a party of 2, we finally got a table at the renowned pizza shop in Brooklyn. After having one of the best pizzas of all time at Little Isabella located in Baltimore, I was on the mission to find its companion in NYC. Overhyped as we suspected, Paulie Gee had nothing on Little Isabella! Perhaps, it was the quirky blend of sweet and savory flavors, but with that 2-hour wait, we surely did not have a pleasing experience.We ordered two pies: HellBoy and Greenpointer. HellBoy: Fresh Mozzarella, Italian Tomatoes, Berkshire Sopressata Piccante, Parmigiano Reggiano and Mike's HOT HoneyGreenpointer:Fresh Mozzarella, Baby Arugula, Olive Oil, Fresh Lemon Juice and Shaved Parmigiano ReggianoWe didn't really enjoy the sweetness of the honey in the HellBoy or the sourness of the lemon juice in the Greenpointer. Fresh, as we saw them make each pie to order, I definitely thought the doughiness of the pizza wasn't anything spectacular. In terms of service, I think it was pretty solid. Our waiter was patient and helpful. As a surprise, Paulie Gee himself introduced himself to just about every table, making it feel quite personable. In all, I definitely wouldn't return back to this pizzeria, especially with that crazy wait. During that 2-hour wait and 1.5-hour dining time, I can drive down to Baltimore and get some Little Isabella for half the price and no wait!",3.0
"3.5 stars for this pizza joint hidden behind a HUGE wooden door all the way down Franklin streetCrust was good with a nice char on the hellboy but the crust of the greenpoint pizza seemed a bit underdone We were quoted a 1.5 hour wait at 8pm for 3 on a Saturday but we were lucky that people in front of us hadn't returned so we were seated right away! (so don't be discouraged)---hellboy: everything was good about this except that spicy honey! Should of gone with a more classic margherita style pizza instead---greenpoint: fresh arugula, with a bit too much lemon juice, so nothing special NOTE: they don't have pepper flakes, only chili oil",4.0
"If you want great pizza and the right atmosphere look no further than Paulie Gee's. We sat at the bar (luckily) and avoided a two hour wait.  The pizza choices are numerous, with some very creative options. There were three of us and we started with two pies. Would have been content but it was so good we ordered a third.The texture. The crust. The toppings. Hard pressed to mention anything I didn't like. I love pizza and this place is right up there with the best. That includes many pizzerias throughout Italy.Paulie stopped by for a chat and he has a fantastic personality. Great stories and it is obvious that he loves what he does and holds him team to very high standards.He was also kind enough to give me an official Paulie Gee's pin and a limoncello. A very nice touch!Make sure you check out the pizza oven in the back. It's a small,cozy place so don't pass this place up in you are in NY.",5.0
I take my pizza very seriously. The vegan pizza is so good here that if they didn't tell you it was vegan you would have no clue. I had the pie with vegan sausage and shared a few others with friends. It was all out of this world. I can't wait to go back again.,5.0
"There's a LOT of really great pizza in NYC, that's nothing new. But combine amazing pizza with friendly, caring service and a killer ambiance, and Paulie Gee's has a leg up on a lot of the other heavy hitters. The wait can be crazy, but we came in on a Tuesday night and it was half empty. I guess the key is to come when there's post-blizzard sludge everywhere and no one else wants to go out. Paulie Gee was there as I'm told he usually is, weaving around the space with his cup of coffee and stopping at literally every table. For us, he offered to curate our pizza order and who were we to argue? Read on for what Paulie Gee himself recommends:- The Greenpointer: according to Paulie, basically like eating a salad due to the piles of fresh baby arugula on top. - The Mo Cheeks: My personal favorite of the meal. The pickled onions on there are a nice surprise, and give a nice kick to the rest of the ingredients. - The Monte Cristo: OK, so this is probably something I would never think to order myself, but I'm glad it came out for us because it's actually super tasty. It comes with Canadian bacon and a drizzle of maple syrup, which I know sounds weird but trust me (or rather, trust Paulie). - I didn't catch the name of the last pizza, but it was one of the best and after peeking at the menu again I think it might have been the Hellboy. It was piled high with the tastiest Berkshire Sopressata, and it was perfect with the side of Mike's hot honey (which you haven't tried on pizza you must immediately). They asked if we wanted a dessert pizza but at that point we were stuffed to the gills. It was one of the best New York pizza experiences I've had so far, and the service is what really puts them above and beyond. I'm going to run for vice-president of the Paulie Gee fanclub soon!",5.0
"Came here a few days ago with my friend after work. Very dark inside, took some time for my eyeballs to adjust lol. We started off with some beers and then went with the Hellboy which was AMAZING. The hot honey makes a difference! Then we went with a vegan pie since neither one of us was particularly full. We ordered one with spinach, sea salt and garlic on it (sorry don't remember the name!) It was OK, not that memorable. The standout is by far Hellboy, the crust for both pizzas was SUPER THIN, firm and didn't fall apart on me. We both liked it. I took off a star for the spinach pie being nothing special and that it's a bit on the pricey side. Overall, I think I'll be back to try the other pizzas on the menu!",4.0
"Maybe we came on an off night, but we didn't care too much about the pizza and it was definitely not the best we've had. My friend wanted to celebrate her belated birthday at Paulie Gee's and so we did. We ordered 3 pies (Greenpointer, Ricotta Be Kidding Me, and The Hometown Brisket). I think the Hometown Brisket was our favorite only because of the BBQ sauce. Other than that, there wasn't much brisket pieces on the pizza. Ricotta Be Kidding Me was okay. The Greenpointer was all greens so that balanced our meal a little bit. I hear people waiting for hours to get a seat here and right now I'm just wondering where all the hype went? We came when they were opening, so thank goodness we didn't wait on line for this...cause it wouldn't have been worth it. FYI: There's no sign outside that says ""Paulie Gee's"".

"I almost feel like it's blasphemy for not giving 5 stars. Finally made my way over here at Paulie Gees after way too long. Clearly this place is GPs staple so was excited to drop by on Wednesday night.There was no wait- very good. I had been worried about this so called 3x around 6:45pm to see how long it was before heading over. No one picked up and their answering service basically hangs up on you. I ordered the Daniela and he ordered the brisket pizza. Mine came out a good 7 minutes before his. I noticed immediately that about 40% of the crust was charred to the point of being inedible. To top that off, the spinach topping my pizza was the same. It was literally a black piece of ash and when I picked a leaf up or crumbled in my hands. The cheese blend was very good (mozzarella and Parmesan) but the pizza was just not good. To top it off, parts of the center were soggy and didn't hold the toppings when I grabbed a slice. When the brisket pizza came out a few minutes later I noticed immediately that it was cooked perfectly. The crust was edible and delicious. I was bummed that mine didn't come out this way especially since it seemed like a classic. All I can say is they probably put our orders in together and maybe his needed a little longer in the oven. Mine was most likely getting over cooked while his needed a few more minutes. Hence the gap in time between both of our orders coming out and the reason why mine was half done by the time his came out.I was really disappointed but the good thing to know is at least the brisket pizza was cooked well. I know there is a good meal at Paulie Gees but I feel like we were jipped.Also, great touch that Paulie himself came in to greet all the diners. He was super friendly and it brings a family quality to the place. This is maybe one of the main reasons I'd come back.",3.0
"Delicious!! Definitely made my top 3 favorite pizza  places (the others being robertas and best pizza). We've been meaning to come forever but the line is always so long.

I would highly recommend this tactic to those of you who have been meaning to come and haven't been able to due to the wait -- the food will be worth it. We ordered the hellboy, ricotta be kidding me and the hot honey ice cream Sunday for dessert. The hellboy was our fave. It was basically a pepperoni pizza with hot honey lined under the cheese.

"My husband and I visited Paulie Gee's about two years ago and he still dreams of the Hellboy. This time we ordered the Hellboy and Cherry Jones.  The Hellboy was great but just a touch too sweet for me.  The hot honey adds a little kick but is definitely not too hot.  My husband will tell you it is the best pizza he has ever had (saying a lot since he was raised in the Bronx).  The Cherry Jones on the other hand was way too sweet for both of us.  I couldn't taste anything other then honey.  My husband embarrassed me by telling the waitress we didn't like it.  She offered us a replacement.  We ordered the Ricky Ricotta.  It was alright.  I was shocked because the ricotta was not warm.  The crust at Paulie Gee's is the perfect texture.  However, two of our three pizzas were too charred for my taste.  I must mention Paulie walks around all the tables to make sure everyone is enjoying.  Love it!  The restaurant is too dark and loud for my taste.",3.0

"Absolutely delicious. Huge selection of pies - good for meatatarians, vegetarians, and even vegans. Wood fire oven delivers the signature light smoke and char. Dough is absolutely tender and springy. They even let the pizza rest afterwards so the cheese sets and you don't burn the crap out of your mouth.Hellboy- spicy pepperoni with hot honey. Absolute classic pizza. Hot honey perfectly blankets the spicy meat. Super simple, absolutely delicious. Get two, trust meRicotta/sausage pie - similar to one above, hot honey included. However ricotta and sausage are a welcome addition.

"One of the challenges of  being vegan is getting your friends/family to be open to the idea of trying vegan food.I have never had Vegan Pizza before and I usually try to try a restaurant first before recommending to anyone especially a non vegan but I took a chance.When we first arrived we were having trouble picking something since everything was foreign to us. Someone sitting next to us saw our struggle and took us to try the  IN Ricotta Da Vegan so we did. AMAZING!! My non vegan date was impressed and I was so happy.Thanks Paulie Gee for making me looking good Whew! One pie (6 small slices) goes for 16 bucks . Its small, nice ambiance I would say its a little darkI would go again!Menu like here ------ pauliegee.com/greenpoint… xoxoC.",4.0
"Some of the best za in the city, bar none. The lady and I traveled far and wide for it since we'd heard such great things. It was a Friday night so the restaurant was predictably packed. There's not much in the form of a waiting area, which particularly sucked given how freezing the weather was, but we had a feeling the pie would be well worth the wait (plus we also got to watch a tipsy couple aggressively suck face up close and personal which was an unexpected but enjoyable twist).The vibe was cool, featuring low--lighting, a huge and beautiful custom brick oven, and trendy attractive people who's favorite bands you've never heard of.When we finally were seated I was stoked to see the menu offered a huge variety of pies with all sorts of niche toppings AND vegan options(I personally don't give two damns about veganism but they presented them in an unpretentious way so I was cool with it). We eventually decided to go with the Hell Boy and the Prokypineapple, both of which were amazing, and I'm looking forward to going back and further chowing my way down the menu.Go here.",5.0
"After a 2-hours wait on a weekend for a party of 2, we finally got a table at the renowned pizza shop in Brooklyn. After having one of the best pizzas of all time at Little Isabella located in Baltimore, I was on the mission to find its companion in NYC. Overhyped as we suspected, Paulie Gee had nothing on Little Isabella! Perhaps, it was the quirky blend of sweet and savory flavors, but with that 2-hour wait, we surely did not have a pleasing experience.We ordered two pies: HellBoy and Greenpointer. HellBoy: Fresh Mozzarella, Italian Tomatoes, Berkshire Sopressata Piccante, Parmigiano Reggiano and Mike's HOT HoneyGreenpointer:Fresh Mozzarella, Baby Arugula, Olive Oil, Fresh Lemon Juice and Shaved Parmigiano ReggianoWe didn't really enjoy the sweetness of the honey in the HellBoy or the sourness of the lemon juice in the Greenpointer. Fresh, as we saw them make each pie to order, I definitely thought the doughiness of the pizza wasn't anything spectacular. In terms of service, I think it was pretty solid. Our waiter was patient and helpful. As a surprise, Paulie Gee himself introduced himself to just about every table, making it feel quite personable. In all, I definitely wouldn't return back to this pizzeria, especially with that crazy wait. During that 2-hour wait and 1.5-hour dining time, I can drive down to Baltimore and get some Little Isabella for half the price and no wait!",3.0
"3.5 stars for this pizza joint hidden behind a HUGE wooden door all the way down Franklin streetCrust was good with a nice char on the hellboy but the crust of the greenpoint pizza seemed a bit underdone We were quoted a 1.5 hour wait at 8pm for 3 on a Saturday but we were lucky that people in front of us hadn't returned so we were seated right away! (so don't be discouraged)---hellboy: everything was good about this except that spicy honey! Should of gone with a more classic margherita style pizza instead---greenpoint: fresh arugula, with a bit too much lemon juice, so nothing special NOTE: they don't have pepper flakes, only chili oil",4.0
"If you want great pizza and the right atmosphere look no further than Paulie Gee's. We sat at the bar (luckily) and avoided a two hour wait.  The pizza choices are numerous, with some very creative options. There were three of us and we started with two pies. Would have been content but it was so good we ordered a third.The texture. The crust. The toppings. Hard pressed to mention anything I didn't like. I love pizza and this place is right up there with the best. That includes many pizzerias throughout Italy.Paulie stopped by for a chat and he has a fantastic personality. Great stories and it is obvious that he loves what he does and holds him team to very high standards.He was also kind enough to give me an official Paulie Gee's pin and a limoncello. A very nice touch!Make sure you check out the pizza oven in the back. It's a small,cozy place so don't pass this place up in you are in NY.",5.0
I take my pizza very seriously. The vegan pizza is so good here that if they didn't tell you it was vegan you would have no clue. I had the pie with vegan sausage and shared a few others with friends. It was all out of this world. I can't wait to go back again.,5.0
"There's a LOT of really great pizza in NYC, that's nothing new. But combine amazing pizza with friendly, caring service and a killer ambiance, and Paulie Gee's has a leg up on a lot of the other heavy hitters. The wait can be crazy, but we came in on a Tuesday night and it was half empty. I guess the key is to come when there's post-blizzard sludge everywhere and no one else wants to go out. Paulie Gee was there as I'm told he usually is, weaving around the space with his cup of coffee and stopping at literally every table. For us, he offered to curate our pizza order and who were we to argue? Read on for what Paulie Gee himself recommends:- The Greenpointer: according to Paulie, basically like eating a salad due to the piles of fresh baby arugula on top. - The Mo Cheeks: My personal favorite of the meal. The pickled onions on there are a nice surprise, and give a nice kick to the rest of the ingredients. - The Monte Cristo: OK, so this is probably something I would never think to order myself, but I'm glad it came out for us because it's actually super tasty. It comes with Canadian bacon and a drizzle of maple syrup, which I know sounds weird but trust me (or rather, trust Paulie). - I didn't catch the name of the last pizza, but it was one of the best and after peeking at the menu again I think it might have been the Hellboy. It was piled high with the tastiest Berkshire Sopressata, and it was perfect with the side of Mike's hot honey (which you haven't tried on pizza you must immediately). They asked if we wanted a dessert pizza but at that point we were stuffed to the gills. It was one of the best New York pizza experiences I've had so far, and the service is what really puts them above and beyond. I'm going to run for vice-president of the Paulie Gee fanclub soon!",5.0
"Came here a few days ago with my friend after work. Very dark inside, took some time for my eyeballs to adjust lol. We started off with some beers and then went with the Hellboy which was AMAZING. The hot honey makes a difference! Then we went with a vegan pie since neither one of us was particularly full. We ordered one with spinach, sea salt and garlic on it (sorry don't remember the name!) It was OK, not that memorable. The standout is by far Hellboy, the crust for both pizzas was SUPER THIN, firm and didn't fall apart on me. We both liked it. I took off a star for the spinach pie being nothing special and that it's a bit on the pricey side. Overall, I think I'll be back to try the other pizzas on the menu!",4.0
"Maybe we came on an off night, but we didn't care too much about the pizza and it was definitely not the best we've had. My friend wanted to celebrate her belated birthday at Paulie Gee's and so we did. We ordered 3 pies (Greenpointer, Ricotta Be Kidding Me, and The Hometown Brisket). I think the Hometown Brisket was our favorite only because of the BBQ sauce. Other than that, there wasn't much brisket pieces on the pizza. Ricotta Be Kidding Me was okay. The Greenpointer was all greens so that balanced our meal a little bit. I hear people waiting for hours to get a seat here and right now I'm just wondering where all the hype went? We came when they were opening, so thank goodness we didn't wait on line for this...cause it wouldn't have been worth it. FYI: There's no sign outside that says ""Paulie Gee's"". You just have to look by the address number ""60"" in order to find this place. I actually walked passed it while we were trying to find it. Also, use your flash on your phones to read the menu. I really liked the rustic interior but it was literally pitch black in there.",3.0
"Zagat rated the hellboy as the best pizza in NYC. Wow! Big call Zagat... We had to try! We would say it was delicious... But I would have to say Marta is equal of not just ahead. We got here at 6:40 and had to wait over an hr to sit at the bar. When getting here service was prompt and food was great! We ordered the hellboy and the hellified porkpie white and I have to say it was fresh, full of flavor and great value. My only critique would be more hot suppressa on the hellified and take numbers at the door! It's a little unreasonable to ask people to wait 90 mins and not offer to call when table it ready. Either way it was great but probably won't be crossing the river to wait another 90 mins.",4.0
"If there was ever a restaurant that inspires the need for #PiDay (3.14) to be everyday, it is Paulie Gee's. The pizza is a true art, and every bite is important, from the center to the crust crust.  PG is located in pizza heaven, or right near the water on Greenpoint Ave if you want a Google Map friendly address.Read it on my blog: highclasstohighlifes.com…As you'll see below I'm constantly on the proscuitt of happiness but this time we went for a different ham, Canadian bacon, and on the Monte Cristo. You bet it counted towards happiness. This pizza combines maple syrup drizzle and gouda with the ham. Yes, yes and more yes. Paulie asked if we had butter on the crust...sadly, no. SO MUCH REGRET....that I'll be back in no time to try it. You'll notice on the menu that they have a brisket pizza that features Hometown BBQ -- I love this local BK collaboration. You can get sauced the other way too with Greenpoint local brews!Anyway, I have nearly eaten my way through the entire menu (still need to do a bit of adventuring on the vegan side, every time I get close, I just want meat...) and I have been very pleased with every slice thus far. Therefore my advice to you is go with the pizza that's toppings are most appealing...or grab a handful of friends and share, then you can try multiple pizzas!The man, who is not a myth, but definitely a legend is often found inside checking in on tables, ensuring quality control and getting to know the patrons. He loved my last Instagram post that did a little play words...sharing that I was on the prosciutt of happiness with his King Henry Classic. He's always all smiles and usually wearing a great hat, he is Paulie Gee himself. Paulie Gee's - High Class to High Lifes If you really knead to get delivery or pickup, you'll have to look elsewhere for now though. The only way to leave Paulie Gee's with a to-go box is with leftovers. Rumor has it that a slice joint is opening up nearby though! I'm counting down the days, hours and minutes. Want to keep drooling? Read the menu!Pro Tip: Grab dinner at Paulie Gee's then walk straight out on the water in Greenpoint to Transmitter park or the outlook. Maybe even catch a sunset and BYO night cap!",5.0
"My old pal Carlos and I visited Paulie Gee's last night and had a great meal. I'm accustomed to going with the ol' vegan girlfriend and have a tradition where we split two pies from their extensive vegan selection, so we can try two different types of pies. The vegan and non-vegan selections are both extensive; each category has at least a half dozen kinds of pies, including oil bases, white slices, marinara, spinach-based, spicy honey and barbecue sauce foundations. The pies are aesthetically pleasing to every sense, well, every sense except sound. It's usually better when sound isn't a factor. At least when you're talking about food. When you're talking about music, sound is obviously a very important sense to talk about. I may go as far as to say that in a conversation about music, sound is the only sense that matters.I was excited to go with Carlos because I was going to get to eat their meat and actual cheese. The Paulie Gee's brisket is lean and delicious. Their pickled red onions possess a truly memorable tang and are worth spending a couple buck to add on to pretty much any pie. The ricotta dollops on the Ricky Ricotta feel more like bursts of a cream sauce than regular old cheese. Interestingly, the dairy and non-dairy ricotta cheeses are almost indecipherable in quality, which goes to show that Paulie Gee's knows what's up. Carlos and I were pleased to compliment the trad Italian flavors of the Ricky Ricotta with a tangy Barbecue Brisket pie. I'm psyched to go with a fellow omnivore again, because there are tons of other flavor combos I'm eager to try. New Yorkers, such as myself, are notorious for being dicks about the quality of pizza dough. It's the dough that invalidates the Chicago Deep Dish's false aspiration to pizza status. I can't stand Sicilian pizza either, which is a controversial take in Nueva York. Anyhow, no matter how well adorned a Paulie Gee's pie is, its base--the crust--is its most distinct and wonderful element. The crust is thin but springy, and always a little charred. It's pretty much naan bread, which is either a very luck coincidence or a visionary innovation. Naan bread, as you know, is lit, and, as it turns out, it is the perfect surface upon which various pizza ingredients should be placed and/or spread to mingle harmoniously.I've visited Paulie Gee's a number of times, and there's a bit of narrative that forms around my visits. The first time I tried to go, it was around noon, and my gf and I made the unpleasant discovery that Paulie Gee's does not open til 5 PM. The next time, we rolled up in a deep crew of six and had to wait about two to three hours for a table for six. If you find yourself in that position, you'll be okay though because there are plenty of bars around. There's also the water/skyline, mere yards away and a nice record store a block away.The gf and I have gone a few other times and it's always been great--except for the one time that a camera crew was shooting a special on Paulie Gee's vegan options. My girlfriend and I were in the shot all throughout our meal, and we were fighting (as subtly as possible) for the duration of our meal. I was taken aback and somewhat miffed when the producers of the show asked to do a talking head with us outside. The tension was palpable but they still insisted on interviewing us. I really do believe that you should foot the bill if you're going to interview someone for your television series or web series or gratuitously long Yelp review or whatever. At LEAST commission me to write a song for the soundtrack.In closing, I would like to offer a lil sum sum for the ladies. Are you interested in grandfatherly, charmingly blue collar, short men whose personalities closely resemble those of most Robert De Niro characters--but only in David O. Russel movies? If you do, and might want to be possibly hit on by a man of this caliber, you will love Paulie Gee's. At all times, Paulie Gee's eponymous Pizza Architect and Entrepreneur, Paulie Gee, stalks the narrow spaces between tables, checking in with customers--particularly of the reasonably attractive female demographic--and asks them how their food is, making small talk and thanking them for their patronage. I think this is cool. I would do the same if I were in his position, so don't take this the wrong way. Central to Paulie Gee's game is his ability to recommend a pizza place in seemingly every zip code on the planet and his inclination to tell you (the lady in question) the name of the dude who works there/owns the place, and to tell you (still the lady in question) to tell the dude (who owns the pizza place) to say that he (Paulie Gee) says hi.

"Some of the best za in the city, bar none. The lady and I traveled far and wide for it since we'd heard such great things. It was a Friday night so the restaurant was predictably packed. There's not much in the form of a waiting area, which particularly sucked given how freezing the weather was, but we had a feeling the pie would be well worth the wait (plus we also got to watch a tipsy couple aggressively suck face up close and personal which was an unexpected but enjoyable twist).The vibe was cool, featuring low--lighting, a huge and beautiful custom brick oven, and trendy attractive people who's favorite bands you've never heard of.When we finally were seated I was stoked to see the menu offered a huge variety of pies with all sorts of niche toppings AND vegan options(I personally don't give two damns about veganism but they presented them in an unpretentious way so I was cool with it).

"After a 2-hours wait on a weekend for a party of 2, we finally got a table at the renowned pizza shop in Brooklyn. After having one of the best pizzas of all time at Little Isabella located in Baltimore, I was on the mission to find its companion in NYC. Overhyped as we suspected, Paulie Gee had nothing on Little Isabella! Perhaps, it was the quirky blend of sweet and savory flavors, but with that 2-hour wait, we surely did not have a pleasing experience.We ordered two pies: HellBoy and Greenpointer. HellBoy: Fresh Mozzarella, Italian Tomatoes, Berkshire Sopressata Piccante, Parmigiano Reggiano and Mike's HOT HoneyGreenpointer:Fresh Mozzarella, Baby Arugula, Olive Oil, Fresh Lemon Juice and Shaved Parmigiano ReggianoWe didn't really enjoy the sweetness of the honey in the HellBoy or the sourness of the lemon juice in the Greenpointer. Fresh, as we saw them make each pie to order, I definitely thought the doughiness of the pizza wasn't anything spectacular. In terms of service, I think it was pretty solid. Our waiter was patient and helpful. As a surprise, Paulie Gee himself introduced himself to just about every table, making it feel quite personable. In all, I definitely wouldn't return back to this pizzeria, especially with that crazy wait. During that 2-hour wait and 1.5-hour dining time, I can drive down to Baltimore and get some Little Isabella for half the price and no wait!",3.0

I take my pizza very seriously. The vegan pizza is so good here that if they didn't tell you it was vegan you would have no clue. I had the pie with vegan sausage and shared a few others with friends. It was all out of this world. I can't wait to go back again.,5.0
"There's a LOT of really great pizza in NYC, that's nothing new. But combine amazing pizza with friendly, caring service and a killer ambiance, and Paulie Gee's has a leg up on a lot of the other heavy hitters. The wait can be crazy, but we came in on a Tuesday night and it was half empty. I guess the key is to come when there's post-blizzard sludge everywhere and no one else wants to go out. Paulie Gee was there as I'm told he usually is, weaving around the space with his cup of coffee and stopping at literally every table. For us, he offered to curate our pizza order and who were we to argue? Read on for what Paulie Gee himself recommends:- The Greenpointer: according to Paulie, basically like eating a salad due to the piles of fresh baby arugula on top. - The Mo Cheeks: My personal favorite of the meal. The pickled onions on there are a nice surprise, and give a nice kick to the rest of the ingredients. - The Monte Cristo: OK, so this is probably something I would never think to order myself, but I'm glad it came out for us because it's actually super tasty. It comes with Canadian bacon and a drizzle of maple syrup, which I know sounds weird but trust me (or rather, trust Paulie). - I didn't catch the name of the last pizza, but it was one of the best and after peeking at the menu again I think it might have been the Hellboy. It was piled high with the tastiest Berkshire Sopressata, and it was perfect with the side of Mike's hot honey (which you haven't tried on pizza you must immediately). They asked if we wanted a dessert pizza but at that point we were stuffed to the gills. It was one of the best New York pizza experiences I've had so far, and the service is what really puts them above and beyond. I'm going to run for vice-president of the Paulie Gee fanclub soon!",5.0
"Came here a few days ago with my friend after work. Very dark inside, took some time for my eyeballs to adjust lol. We started off with some beers and then went with the Hellboy which was AMAZING. The hot honey makes a difference! Then we went with a vegan pie since neither one of us was particularly full. We ordered one with spinach, sea salt and garlic on it (sorry don't remember the name!) It was OK, not that memorable. The standout is by far Hellboy, the crust for both pizzas was SUPER THIN, firm and didn't fall apart on me. We both liked it. I took off a star for the spinach pie being nothing special and that it's a bit on the pricey side. Overall, I think I'll be back to try the other pizzas on the menu!",4.0
"Maybe we came on an off night, but we didn't care too much about the pizza and it was definitely not the best we've had. My friend wanted to celebrate her belated birthday at Paulie Gee's and so we did. We ordered 3 pies (Greenpointer, Ricotta Be Kidding Me, and The Hometown Brisket). I think the Hometown Brisket was our favorite only because of the BBQ sauce. Other than that, there wasn't much brisket pieces on the pizza. Ricotta Be Kidding Me was okay. The Greenpointer was all greens so that balanced our meal a little bit. I hear people waiting for hours to get a seat here and right now I'm just wondering where all the hype went? We came when they were opening, so thank goodness we didn't wait on line for this...cause it wouldn't have been worth it. FYI: There's no sign outside that says ""Paulie Gee's"". You just have to look by the address number ""60"" in order to find this place. I actually walked passed it while we were trying to find it. Also, use your flash on your phones to read the menu. I really liked the rustic interior but it was literally pitch black in there.",3.0
"Zagat rated the hellboy as the best pizza in NYC. Wow! Big call Zagat... We had to try! We would say it was delicious... But I would have to say Marta is equal of not just ahead. We got here at 6:40 and had to wait over an hr to sit at the bar. When getting here service was prompt and food was great! We ordered the hellboy and the hellified porkpie white and I have to say it was fresh, full of flavor and great value. My only critique would be more hot suppressa on the hellified and take numbers at the door! It's a little unreasonable to ask people to wait 90 mins and not offer to call when table it ready. Either way it was great but probably won't be crossing the river to wait another 90 mins.",4.0
"If there was ever a restaurant that inspires the need for #PiDay (3.14) to be everyday, it is Paulie Gee's. The pizza is a true art, and every bite is important, from the center to the crust crust.  PG is located in pizza heaven, or right near the water on Greenpoint Ave if you want a Google Map friendly address.Read it on my blog: highclasstohighlifes.com…As you'll see below I'm constantly on the proscuitt of happiness but this time we went for a different ham, Canadian bacon, and on the Monte Cristo. You bet it counted towards happiness. This pizza combines maple syrup drizzle and gouda with the ham. Yes, yes and more yes. Paulie asked if we had butter on the crust...sadly, no. SO MUCH REGRET....that I'll be back in no time to try it. You'll notice on the menu that they have a brisket pizza that features Hometown BBQ -- I love this local BK collaboration. You can get sauced the other way too with Greenpoint local brews!Anyway, I have nearly eaten my way through the entire menu (still need to do a bit of adventuring on the vegan side, every time I get close, I just want meat...) and I have been very pleased with every slice thus far. Therefore my advice to you is go with the pizza that's toppings are most appealing...or grab a handful of friends and share, then you can try multiple pizzas!The man, who is not a myth, but definitely a legend is often found inside checking in on tables, ensuring quality control and getting to know the patrons. He loved my last Instagram post that did a little play words...sharing that I was on the prosciutt of happiness with his King Henry Classic. He's always all smiles and usually wearing a great hat, he is Paulie Gee himself. Paulie Gee's - High Class to High Lifes If you really knead to get delivery or pickup, you'll have to look elsewhere for now though. The only way to leave Paulie Gee's with a to-go box is with leftovers. Rumor has it that a slice joint is opening up nearby though! I'm counting down the days, hours and minutes. Want to keep drooling? Read the menu!Pro Tip: Grab dinner at Paulie Gee's then walk straight out on the water in Greenpoint to Transmitter park or the outlook. Maybe even catch a sunset and BYO night cap!",5.0
"My old pal Carlos and I visited Paulie Gee's last night and had a great meal. I'm accustomed to going with the ol' vegan girlfriend and have a tradition where we split two pies from their extensive vegan selection, so we can try two different types of pies. The vegan and non-vegan selections are both extensive; each category has at least a half dozen kinds of pies, including oil bases, white slices, marinara, spinach-based, spicy honey and barbecue sauce foundations. The pies are aesthetically pleasing to every sense, well, every sense except sound. It's usually better when sound isn't a factor. At least when you're talking about food. When you're talking about music, sound is obviously a very important sense to talk about. I may go as far as to say that in a conversation about music, sound is the only sense that matters.I was excited to go with Carlos because I was going to get to eat their meat and actual cheese. The Paulie Gee's brisket is lean and delicious. Their pickled red onions possess a truly memorable tang and are worth spending a couple buck to add on to pretty much any pie. The ricotta dollops on the Ricky Ricotta feel more like bursts of a cream sauce than regular old cheese. Interestingly, the dairy and non-dairy ricotta cheeses are almost indecipherable in quality, which goes to show that Paulie Gee's knows what's up. Carlos and I were pleased to compliment the trad Italian flavors of the Ricky Ricotta with a tangy Barbecue Brisket pie. I'm psyched to go with a fellow omnivore again, because there are tons of other flavor combos I'm eager to try. New Yorkers, such as myself, are notorious for being dicks about the quality of pizza dough. It's the dough that invalidates the Chicago Deep Dish's false aspiration to pizza status. I can't stand Sicilian pizza either, which is a controversial take in Nueva York. Anyhow, no matter how well adorned a Paulie Gee's pie is, its base--the crust--is its most distinct and wonderful element. The crust is thin but springy, and always a little charred. It's pretty much naan bread, which is either a very luck coincidence or a visionary innovation. Naan bread, as you know, is lit, and, as it turns out, it is the perfect surface upon which various pizza ingredients should be placed and/or spread to mingle harmoniously.I've visited Paulie Gee's a number of times, and there's a bit of narrative that forms around my visits. The first time I tried to go, it was around noon, and my gf and I made the unpleasant discovery that Paulie Gee's does not open til 5 PM. The next time, we rolled up in a deep crew of six and had to wait about two to three hours for a table for six. If you find yourself in that position, you'll be okay though because there are plenty of bars around. There's also the water/skyline, mere yards away and a nice record store a block away.The gf and I have gone a few other times and it's always been great--except for the one time that a camera crew was shooting a special on Paulie Gee's vegan options. My girlfriend and I were in the shot all throughout our meal, and we were fighting (as subtly as possible) for the duration of our meal. I was taken aback and somewhat miffed when the producers of the show asked to do a talking head with us outside. The tension was palpable but they still insisted on interviewing us. I really do believe that you should foot the bill if you're going to interview someone for your television series or web series or gratuitously long Yelp review or whatever. At LEAST commission me to write a song for the soundtrack.In closing, I would like to offer a lil sum sum for the ladies. Are you interested in grandfatherly, charmingly blue collar, short men whose personalities closely resemble those of most Robert De Niro characters--but only in David O. Russel movies? If you do, and might want to be possibly hit on by a man of this caliber, you will love Paulie Gee's. At all times, Paulie Gee's eponymous Pizza Architect and Entrepreneur, Paulie Gee, stalks the narrow spaces between tables, checking in with customers--particularly of the reasonably attractive female demographic--and asks them how their food is, making small talk and thanking them for their patronage. I think this is cool. I would do the same if I were in his position, so don't take this the wrong way. Central to Paulie Gee's game is his ability to recommend a pizza place in seemingly every zip code on the planet and his inclination to tell you (the lady in question) the name of the dude who works there/owns the place, and to tell you (still the lady in question) to tell the dude (who owns the pizza place) to say that he (Paulie Gee) says hi. The Brotherhood of Pizza Mans is truly alive and well.",5.0

"I almost feel like it's blasphemy for not giving 5 stars. Finally made my way over here at Paulie Gees after way too long. Clearly this place is GPs staple so was excited to drop by on Wednesday night.There was no wait- very good. I had been worried about this so called 3x around 6:45pm to see how long it was before heading over. No one picked up and their answering service basically hangs up on you. I ordered the Daniela and he ordered the brisket pizza. Mine came out a good 7 minutes before his. I noticed immediately that about 40% of the crust was charred to the point of being inedible. To top that off, the spinach topping my pizza was the same. It was literally a black piece of ash and when I picked a leaf up or crumbled in my hands. The cheese blend was very good (mozzarella and Parmesan) but the pizza was just not good. To top it off, parts of the center were soggy and didn't hold the toppings when I grabbed a slice. When the brisket pizza came out a few minutes later I noticed immediately that it was cooked perfectly. The crust was edible and delicious. I was bummed that mine didn't come out this way especially since it seemed like a classic. All I can say is they probably put our orders in together and maybe his needed a little longer in the oven. Mine was most likely getting over cooked while his needed a few more minutes. Hence the gap in time between both of our orders coming out and the reason why mine was half done by the time his came out.I was really disappointed but the good thing to know is at least the brisket pizza was cooked well. I know there is a good meal at Paulie Gees but I feel like we were jipped.Also, great touch that Paulie himself came in to greet all the diners. He was super friendly and it brings a family quality to the place. This is maybe one of the main reasons I'd come back.",3.0
"Delicious!! Definitely made my top 3 favorite pizza  places (the others being robertas and best pizza). We've been meaning to come forever but the line is always so long. We were finally seated right away on a Friday night because we ran over as soon as they opened at 6pm. I would highly recommend this tactic to those of you who have been meaning to come and haven't been able to due to the wait -- the food will be worth it. We ordered the hellboy, ricotta be kidding me and the hot honey ice cream Sunday for dessert. The hellboy was our fave. It was basically a pepperoni pizza with hot honey lined under the cheese. I liked it more than the bees sting from Robertas but both are very good. All in all would highly recommend. As an extra plus Paulie Gee was hanging around today,though it seems like he does this quite often, going from table to table talking to the customers.",5.0
"My husband and I visited Paulie Gee's about two years ago and he still dreams of the Hellboy. This time we ordered the Hellboy and Cherry Jones.  The Hellboy was great but just a touch too sweet for me.  The hot honey adds a little kick but is definitely not too hot.  My husband will tell you it is the best pizza he has ever had (saying a lot since he was raised in the Bronx).  The Cherry Jones on the other hand was way too sweet for both of us.  I couldn't taste anything other then honey.  My husband embarrassed me by telling the waitress we didn't like it.  She offered us a replacement.  We ordered the Ricky Ricotta.  It was alright.  I was shocked because the ricotta was not warm.  The crust at Paulie Gee's is the perfect texture.  However, two of our three pizzas were too charred for my taste.  I must mention Paulie walks around all the tables to make sure everyone is enjoying.  Love it!  The restaurant is too dark and loud for my taste.",3.0
"Interesting decor, super dark inside and it was hard to read the menu. We were seated under one of the speakers, so I felt like an old person complaining about how loud the music was, but really, we came for the food. Split a salad and a Greenpointer pie, and neither disappointed. Both were served quickly, and the pie just exploded with flavor. The lemon kick was strong but not overwhelming, and the crust was perfection. Service was attentive, friendly, and efficient. Lots of menu choices for anything your palate is craving. Overall, a very good experience, and one I would look forward to enjoying again.",4.0
"New York probably takes its pizza more seriously than anywhere else in the world.  I'm sure there are 7 or 8 people reading this right now that would be willing to shiv a guy for saying something bad about their favorite slice.  With that in mind, Paulie Gee's is a pizza lover's pizza place.  They make Neapolitan style pizzas with an oven shipped in from Naples and lovingly reassembled by small, Italian elves.  From this oven, comes perfectly leopard-spotted pizzas with just the right amount of bouncy chewy dough.To top the pizza, there's a lovingly curated selection to choose from so don't you dare ask for substitutions.  Lucky for you whether you're a vegan, vegetarian, white/red pie lover, averse to spice, meat lover, or whatever!  There's at least one pie on the menu* that will make you say, ""hmmm..."".  My personal favorites are the Mo' Cheeks ($16, has guanciale and is perfect with the pickled onions) and Ricotta Be Kidding Me ($17, with tons of meat topped with adorable dollops of cottage cheese).  I've only ever had 1 pizza there that wasn't stellar and I won't tell you which one because you'll definitely judge me for choosing it in the first place.The atmosphere at Paulie Gee's is great.  It's quintessential Brooklyn.  Think dark unfinished wood walls with an eclectic collection of tables made from reclaimed wood, music consisting of a mixture of jazz, rock, and anything but top 40s.  What always makes my night is that the ACTUAL Paulie Gee walks around and talks to EVERYONE.  It doesn't matter if Keri Russell** is sitting right next to you, he will still come by and have a 5-20 minute conversation with you and your table.  My only complaint is how popular this place is.  They've stopped making pizzas to go and still, the wait is crazy.  I've never been able to get a table in less than 45 minutes unless it was late at night.  I guess that's not a bad problem to have.  I also kind of wish they would get a full liquor license and take that creative pizza combo creating mind into the cocktail realm.  I mean...Mike's Hot Honey + Whiskey?  Maybe?---------* If you can't find a pizza you like on the printed menu in the restaurant, whip out the smartphone and check out the ""secret"" menu on the website.** This actually happened.",4.0

It was piled high with the tastiest Berkshire Sopressata, and it was perfect with the side of Mike's hot honey (which you haven't tried on pizza you must immediately). They asked if we wanted a dessert pizza but at that point we were stuffed to the gills. It was one of the best New York pizza experiences I've had so far, and the service is what really puts them above and beyond. I'm going to run for vice-president of the Paulie Gee fanclub soon!",5.0
"Came here a few days ago with my friend after work. Very dark inside, took some time for my eyeballs to adjust lol. We started off with some beers and then went with the Hellboy which was AMAZING. The hot honey makes a difference! Then we went with a vegan pie since neither one of us was particularly full. We ordered one with spinach, sea salt and garlic on it (sorry don't remember the name!) It was OK, not that memorable. The standout is by far Hellboy, the crust for both pizzas was SUPER THIN, firm and didn't fall apart on me. We both liked it.

"Maybe we came on an off night, but we didn't care too much about the pizza and it was definitely not the best we've had. My friend wanted to celebrate her belated birthday at Paulie Gee's and so we did. We ordered 3 pies (Greenpointer, Ricotta Be Kidding Me, and The Hometown Brisket). I think the Hometown Brisket was our favorite only because of the BBQ sauce. Other than that, there wasn't much brisket pieces on the pizza. Ricotta Be Kidding Me was okay. The Greenpointer was all greens so that balanced our meal a little bit. I hear people waiting for hours to get a seat here and right now I'm just wondering where all the hype went? We came when they were opening, so thank goodness we didn't wait on line for this...cause it wouldn't have been worth it. FYI: There's no sign outside that says ""Paulie Gee's"".

"My old pal Carlos and I visited Paulie Gee's last night and had a great meal. I'm accustomed to going with the ol' vegan girlfriend and have a tradition where we split two pies from their extensive vegan selection, so we can try two different types of pies. The vegan and non-vegan selections are both extensive; each category has at least a half dozen kinds of pies, including oil bases, white slices, marinara, spinach-based, spicy honey and barbecue sauce foundations. The pies are aesthetically pleasing to every sense, well, every sense except sound. It's usually better when sound isn't a factor. At least when you're talking about food. When you're talking about music, sound is obviously a very important sense to talk about. I may go as far as to say that in a conversation about music, sound is the only sense that matters.I was excited to go with Carlos because I was going to get to eat their meat and actual cheese. The Paulie Gee's brisket is lean and delicious. Their pickled red onions possess a truly memorable tang and are worth spending a couple buck to add on to pretty much any pie. The ricotta dollops on the Ricky Ricotta feel more like bursts of a cream sauce than regular old cheese. Interestingly, the dairy and non-dairy ricotta cheeses are almost indecipherable in quality, which goes to show that Paulie Gee's knows what's up. Carlos and I were pleased to compliment the trad Italian flavors of the Ricky Ricotta with a tangy Barbecue Brisket pie. I'm psyched to go with a fellow omnivore again, because there are tons of other flavor combos I'm eager to try. New Yorkers, such as myself, are notorious for being dicks about the quality of pizza dough. It's the dough that invalidates the Chicago Deep Dish's false aspiration to pizza status. I can't stand Sicilian pizza either, which is a controversial take in Nueva York. Anyhow, no matter how well adorned a Paulie Gee's pie is, its base--the crust--is its most distinct and wonderful element. The crust is thin but springy, and always a little charred. It's pretty much naan bread, which is either a very luck coincidence or a visionary innovation. Naan bread, as you know, is lit, and, as it turns out, it is the perfect surface upon which various pizza ingredients should be placed and/or spread to mingle harmoniously.I've visited Paulie Gee's a number of times, and there's a bit of narrative that forms around my visits. The first time I tried to go, it was around noon, and my gf and I made the unpleasant discovery that Paulie Gee's does not open til 5 PM. The next time, we rolled up in a deep crew of six and had to wait about two to three hours for a table for six. If you find yourself in that position, you'll be okay though because there are plenty of bars around. There's also the water/skyline, mere yards away and a nice record store a block away.The gf and I have gone a few other times and it's always been great--except for the one time that a camera crew was shooting a special on Paulie Gee's vegan options. My girlfriend and I were in the shot all throughout our meal, and we were fighting (as subtly as possible) for the duration of our meal. I was taken aback and somewhat miffed when the producers of the show asked to do a talking head with us outside. The tension was palpable but they still insisted on interviewing us. I really do believe that you should foot the bill if you're going to interview someone for your television series or web series or gratuitously long Yelp review or whatever. At LEAST commission me to write a song for the soundtrack.In closing, I would like to offer a lil sum sum for the ladies. Are you interested in grandfatherly, charmingly blue collar, short men whose personalities closely resemble those of most Robert De Niro characters--but only in David O. Russel movies? If you do, and might want to be possibly hit on by a man of this caliber, you will love Paulie Gee's. At all times, Paulie Gee's eponymous Pizza Architect and Entrepreneur, Paulie Gee, stalks the narrow spaces between tables, checking in with customers--particularly of the reasonably attractive female demographic--and asks them how their food is, making small talk and thanking them for their patronage. I think this is cool. I would do the same if I were in his position, so don't take this the wrong way. Central to Paulie Gee's game is his ability to recommend a pizza place in seemingly every zip code on the planet and his inclination to tell you (the lady in question) the name of the dude who works there/owns the place, and to tell you (still the lady in question) to tell the dude (who owns the pizza place) to say that he (Paulie Gee) says hi. The Brotherhood of Pizza Mans is truly alive and well.",5.0

"I almost feel like it's blasphemy for not giving 5 stars. Finally made my way over here at Paulie Gees after way too long. Clearly this place is GPs staple so was excited to drop by on Wednesday night.There was no wait- very good. I had been worried about this so called 3x around 6:45pm to see how long it was before heading over. No one picked up and their answering service basically hangs up on you. I ordered the Daniela and he ordered the brisket pizza. Mine came out a good 7 minutes before his. I noticed immediately that about 40% of the crust was charred to the point of being inedible. To top that off, the spinach topping my pizza was the same. It was literally a black piece of ash and when I picked a leaf up or crumbled in my hands. The cheese blend was very good (mozzarella and Parmesan) but the pizza was just not good. To top it off, parts of the center were soggy and didn't hold the toppings when I grabbed a slice. When the brisket pizza came out a few minutes later I noticed immediately that it was cooked perfectly. The crust was edible and delicious. I was bummed that mine didn't come out this way especially since it seemed like a classic. All I can say is they probably put our orders in together and maybe his needed a little longer in the oven. Mine was most likely getting over cooked while his needed a few more minutes. Hence the gap in time between both of our orders coming out and the reason why mine was half done by the time his came out.I was really disappointed but the good thing to know is at least the brisket pizza was cooked well. I know there is a good meal at Paulie Gees but I feel like we were jipped.Also, great touch that Paulie himself came in to greet all the diners. He was super friendly and it brings a family quality to the place. This is maybe one of the main reasons I'd come back.",3.0
"Delicious!! Definitely made my top 3 favorite pizza  places (the others being robertas and best pizza). We've been meaning to come forever but the line is always so long. We were finally seated right away on a Friday night because we ran over as soon as they opened at 6pm. I would highly recommend this tactic to those of you who have been meaning to come and haven't been able to due to the wait -- the food will be worth it. We ordered the hellboy, ricotta be kidding me and the hot honey ice cream Sunday for dessert. The hellboy was our fave. It was basically a pepperoni pizza with hot honey lined under the cheese. I liked it more than the bees sting from Robertas but both are very good. All in all would highly recommend. As an extra plus Paulie Gee was hanging around today,though it seems like he does this quite often, going from table to table talking to the customers.",5.0
"My husband and I visited Paulie Gee's about two years ago and he still dreams of the Hellboy. This time we ordered the Hellboy and Cherry Jones.  The Hellboy was great but just a touch too sweet for me.  The hot honey adds a little kick but is definitely not too hot.  My husband will tell you it is the best pizza he has ever had (saying a lot since he was raised in the Bronx).  The Cherry Jones on the other hand was way too sweet for both of us.  I couldn't taste anything other then honey.  My husband embarrassed me by telling the waitress we didn't like it.  She offered us a replacement.  We ordered the Ricky Ricotta.  It was alright.  I was shocked because the ricotta was not warm.  The crust at Paulie Gee's is the perfect texture.  However, two of our three pizzas were too charred for my taste.  I must mention Paulie walks around all the tables to make sure everyone is enjoying.  Love it!  The restaurant is too dark and loud for my taste.",3.0
"Interesting decor, super dark inside and it was hard to read the menu. We were seated under one of the speakers, so I felt like an old person complaining about how loud the music was, but really, we came for the food. Split a salad and a Greenpointer pie, and neither disappointed. Both were served quickly, and the pie just exploded with flavor. The lemon kick was strong but not overwhelming, and the crust was perfection. Service was attentive, friendly, and efficient. Lots of menu choices for anything your palate is craving. Overall, a very good experience, and one I would look forward to enjoying again.",4.0
"New York probably takes its pizza more seriously than anywhere else in the world.  I'm sure there are 7 or 8 people reading this right now that would be willing to shiv a guy for saying something bad about their favorite slice.  With that in mind, Paulie Gee's is a pizza lover's pizza place.  They make Neapolitan style pizzas with an oven shipped in from Naples and lovingly reassembled by small, Italian elves.  From this oven, comes perfectly leopard-spotted pizzas with just the right amount of bouncy chewy dough.To top the pizza, there's a lovingly curated selection to choose from so don't you dare ask for substitutions.  Lucky for you whether you're a vegan, vegetarian, white/red pie lover, averse to spice, meat lover, or whatever!  There's at least one pie on the menu* that will make you say, ""hmmm..."".  My personal favorites are the Mo' Cheeks ($16, has guanciale and is perfect with the pickled onions) and Ricotta Be Kidding Me ($17, with tons of meat topped with adorable dollops of cottage cheese).  I've only ever had 1 pizza there that wasn't stellar and I won't tell you which one because you'll definitely judge me for choosing it in the first place.The atmosphere at Paulie Gee's is great.  It's quintessential Brooklyn.  Think dark unfinished wood walls with an eclectic collection of tables made from reclaimed wood, music consisting of a mixture of jazz, rock, and anything but top 40s.  What always makes my night is that the ACTUAL Paulie Gee walks around and talks to EVERYONE.  It doesn't matter if Keri Russell** is sitting right next to you, he will still come by and have a 5-20 minute conversation with you and your table.  My only complaint is how popular this place is.  They've stopped making pizzas to go and still, the wait is crazy.  I've never been able to get a table in less than 45 minutes unless it was late at night.  I guess that's not a bad problem to have.  I also kind of wish they would get a full liquor license and take that creative pizza combo creating mind into the cocktail realm.  I mean...Mike's Hot Honey + Whiskey?  Maybe?---------* If you can't find a pizza you like on the printed menu in the restaurant, whip out the smartphone and check out the ""secret"" menu on the website.** This actually happened.",4.0
"We've literally flown across the country to enjoy his pizza. It's that good! Walking in, the aroma of pizza cooking in a brick oven hits your nose.This is about time my stomach starts to growl. The vibe is flowing with positive energy, and the low lighting is flattering & sexy. The bar to the left is where you can order a beverage while you wait.  They have a decent beer selection. Wait times vary, but it's usually not as long as anticipated, and well worth the effort.Everyone, including the servers, seem happy to be there.Paulie Gee is the utmost host. He's always found time to come to our table with suggestions, stories, and the occasional limoncello, (his recipe of the celebratory cocktail).Talking with him, I've gathered that he makes the vegan pizza for the people, or demand for it, but he didn't seem interested in the cause. The funky bathrooms can be a challenge to use when you've had one too many! VEGAN Pies we LOVE Simply RedVegan Tomato Sauce with Tomatoes, Olive Oil.

"Absolutely delicious. Huge selection of pies - good for meatatarians, vegetarians, and even vegans. Wood fire oven delivers the signature light smoke and char. Dough is absolutely tender and springy. They even let the pizza rest afterwards so the cheese sets and you don't burn the crap out of your mouth.Hellboy- spicy pepperoni with hot honey. Absolute classic pizza. Hot honey perfectly blankets the spicy meat. Super simple, absolutely delicious. Get two, trust meRicotta/sausage pie - similar to one above, hot honey included. However ricotta and sausage are a welcome addition.

"One of the challenges of  being vegan is getting your friends/family to be open to the idea of trying vegan food.I have never had Vegan Pizza before and I usually try to try a restaurant first before recommending to anyone especially a non vegan but I took a chance.When we first arrived we were having trouble picking something since everything was foreign to us. Someone sitting next to us saw our struggle and took us to try the  IN Ricotta Da Vegan so we did. AMAZING!! My non vegan date was impressed and I was so happy.Thanks Paulie Gee for making me looking good Whew! One pie (6 small slices) goes for 16 bucks . Its small, nice ambiance I would say its a little darkI would go again!Menu like here ------ pauliegee.com/greenpoint… xoxoC.",4.0
"Some of the best za in the city, bar none. The lady and I traveled far and wide for it since we'd heard such great things. It was a Friday night so the restaurant was predictably packed. There's not much in the form of a waiting area, which particularly sucked given how freezing the weather was, but we had a feeling the pie would be well worth the wait (plus we also got to watch a tipsy couple aggressively suck face up close and personal which was an unexpected but enjoyable twist).The vibe was cool, featuring low--lighting, a huge and beautiful custom brick oven, and trendy attractive people who's favorite bands you've never heard of.When we finally were seated I was stoked to see the menu offered a huge variety of pies with all sorts of niche toppings AND vegan options(I personally don't give two damns about veganism but they presented them in an unpretentious way so I was cool with it). We eventually decided to go with the Hell Boy and the Prokypineapple, both of which were amazing, and I'm looking forward to going back and further chowing my way down the menu.Go here.",5.0
"After a 2-hours wait on a weekend for a party of 2, we finally got a table at the renowned pizza shop in Brooklyn. After having one of the best pizzas of all time at Little Isabella located in Baltimore, I was on the mission to find its companion in NYC. Overhyped as we suspected, Paulie Gee had nothing on Little Isabella! Perhaps, it was the quirky blend of sweet and savory flavors, but with that 2-hour wait, we surely did not have a pleasing experience.We ordered two pies: HellBoy and Greenpointer. HellBoy: Fresh Mozzarella, Italian Tomatoes, Berkshire Sopressata Piccante, Parmigiano Reggiano and Mike's HOT HoneyGreenpointer:Fresh Mozzarella, Baby Arugula, Olive Oil, Fresh Lemon Juice and Shaved Parmigiano ReggianoWe didn't really enjoy the sweetness of the honey in the HellBoy or the sourness of the lemon juice in the Greenpointer. Fresh, as we saw them make each pie to order, I definitely thought the doughiness of the pizza wasn't anything spectacular. In terms of service, I think it was pretty solid. Our waiter was patient and helpful. As a surprise, Paulie Gee himself introduced himself to just about every table, making it feel quite personable. In all, I definitely wouldn't return back to this pizzeria, especially with that crazy wait. During that 2-hour wait and 1.5-hour dining time, I can drive down to Baltimore and get some Little Isabella for half the price and no wait!",3.0
"3.5 stars for this pizza joint hidden behind a HUGE wooden door all the way down Franklin streetCrust was good with a nice char on the hellboy but the crust of the greenpoint pizza seemed a bit underdone We were quoted a 1.5 hour wait at 8pm for 3 on a Saturday but we were lucky that people in front of us hadn't returned so we were seated right away! (so don't be discouraged)---hellboy: everything was good about this except that spicy honey! Should of gone with a more classic margherita style pizza instead---greenpoint: fresh arugula, with a bit too much lemon juice, so nothing special NOTE: they don't have pepper flakes, only chili oil",4.0
"If you want great pizza and the right atmosphere look no further than Paulie Gee's. We sat at the bar (luckily) and avoided a two hour wait.  The pizza choices are numerous, with some very creative options. There were three of us and we started with two pies. Would have been content but it was so good we ordered a third.The texture. The crust. The toppings. Hard pressed to mention anything I didn't like. I love pizza and this place is right up there with the best. That includes many pizzerias throughout Italy.Paulie stopped by for a chat and he has a fantastic personality. Great stories and it is obvious that he loves what he does and holds him team to very high standards.He was also kind enough to give me an official Paulie Gee's pin and a limoncello. A very nice touch!Make sure you check out the pizza oven in the back. It's a small,cozy place so don't pass this place up in you are in NY.",5.0
I take my pizza very seriously. The vegan pizza is so good here that if they didn't tell you it was vegan you would have no clue. I had the pie with vegan sausage and shared a few others with friends. It was all out of this world. I can't wait to go back again.,5.0
"There's a LOT of really great pizza in NYC, that's nothing new. But combine amazing pizza with friendly, caring service and a killer ambiance, and Paulie Gee's has a leg up on a lot of the other heavy hitters. The wait can be crazy, but we came in on a Tuesday night and it was half empty. I guess the key is to come when there's post-blizzard sludge everywhere and no one else wants to go out. Paulie Gee was there as I'm told he usually is, weaving around the space with his cup of coffee and stopping at literally every table. For us, he offered to curate our pizza order and who were we to argue? Read on for what Paulie Gee himself recommends:- The Greenpointer: according to Paulie, basically like eating a salad due to the piles of fresh baby arugula on top. - The Mo Cheeks: My personal favorite of the meal. The pickled onions on there are a nice surprise, and give a nice kick to the rest of the ingredients. - The Monte Cristo: OK, so this is probably something I would never think to order myself, but I'm glad it came out for us because it's actually super tasty.

The first time I tried to go, it was around noon, and my gf and I made the unpleasant discovery that Paulie Gee's does not open til 5 PM. The next time, we rolled up in a deep crew of six and had to wait about two to three hours for a table for six.

My girlfriend and I were in the shot all throughout our meal, and we were fighting (as subtly as possible) for the duration of our meal. I was taken aback and somewhat miffed when the producers of the show asked to do a talking head with us outside. The tension was palpable but they still insisted on interviewing us.

"I almost feel like it's blasphemy for not giving 5 stars. Finally made my way over here at Paulie Gees after way too long. Clearly this place is GPs staple so was excited to drop by on Wednesday night.There was no wait- very good. I had been worried about this so called 3x around 6:45pm to see how long it was before heading over. No one picked up and their answering service basically hangs up on you. I ordered the Daniela and he ordered the brisket pizza. Mine came out a good 7 minutes before his. I noticed immediately that about 40% of the crust was charred to the point of being inedible. To top that off, the spinach topping my pizza was the same. It was literally a black piece of ash and when I picked a leaf up or crumbled in my hands. The cheese blend was very good (mozzarella and Parmesan) but the pizza was just not good. To top it off, parts of the center were soggy and didn't hold the toppings when I grabbed a slice. When the brisket pizza came out a few minutes later I noticed immediately that it was cooked perfectly. The crust was edible and delicious. I was bummed that mine didn't come out this way especially since it seemed like a classic. All I can say is they probably put our orders in together and maybe his needed a little longer in the oven. Mine was most likely getting over cooked while his needed a few more minutes. Hence the gap in time between both of our orders coming out and the reason why mine was half done by the time his came out.I was really disappointed but the good thing to know is at least the brisket pizza was cooked well. I know there is a good meal at Paulie Gees but I feel like we were jipped.Also, great touch that Paulie himself came in to greet all the diners. He was super friendly and it brings a family quality to the place. This is maybe one of the main reasons I'd come back.",3.0

I would highly recommend this tactic to those of you who have been meaning to come and haven't been able to due to the wait -- the food will be worth it. We ordered the hellboy, ricotta be kidding me and the hot honey ice cream Sunday for dessert. The hellboy was our fave. It was basically a pepperoni pizza with hot honey lined under the cheese. I liked it more than the bees sting from Robertas but both are very good. All in all would highly recommend.

"My husband and I visited Paulie Gee's about two years ago and he still dreams of the Hellboy. This time we ordered the Hellboy and Cherry Jones.  The Hellboy was great but just a touch too sweet for me.  The hot honey adds a little kick but is definitely not too hot.  My husband will tell you it is the best pizza he has ever had (saying a lot since he was raised in the Bronx).  The Cherry Jones on the other hand was way too sweet for both of us.  I couldn't taste anything other then honey.  My husband embarrassed me by telling the waitress we didn't like it.  She offered us a replacement.  We ordered the Ricky Ricotta.  It was alright.  I was shocked because the ricotta was not warm.  The crust at Paulie Gee's is the perfect texture.  However, two of our three pizzas were too charred for my taste.  I must mention Paulie walks around all the tables to make sure everyone is enjoying.  Love it!  The restaurant is too dark and loud for my taste.",3.0

"New York probably takes its pizza more seriously than anywhere else in the world.  I'm sure there are 7 or 8 people reading this right now that would be willing to shiv a guy for saying something bad about their favorite slice.  With that in mind, Paulie Gee's is a pizza lover's pizza place.  They make Neapolitan style pizzas with an oven shipped in from Naples and lovingly reassembled by small, Italian elves.  From this oven, comes perfectly leopard-spotted pizzas with just the right amount of bouncy chewy dough.To top the pizza, there's a lovingly curated selection to choose from so don't you dare ask for substitutions.  Lucky for you whether you're a vegan, vegetarian, white/red pie lover, averse to spice, meat lover, or whatever!  There's at least one pie on the menu* that will make you say, ""hmmm..."".  My personal favorites are the Mo' Cheeks ($16, has guanciale and is perfect with the pickled onions) and Ricotta Be Kidding Me ($17, with tons of meat topped with adorable dollops of cottage cheese).  I've only ever had 1 pizza there that wasn't stellar and I won't tell you which one because you'll definitely judge me for choosing it in the first place.The atmosphere at Paulie Gee's is great.  It's quintessential Brooklyn.  Think dark unfinished wood walls with an eclectic collection of tables made from reclaimed wood, music consisting of a mixture of jazz, rock, and anything but top 40s.  What always makes my night is that the ACTUAL Paulie Gee walks around and talks to EVERYONE.  It doesn't matter if Keri Russell** is sitting right next to you, he will still come by and have a 5-20 minute conversation with you and your table.  My only complaint is how popular this place is.  They've stopped making pizzas to go and still, the wait is crazy.  I've never been able to get a table in less than 45 minutes unless it was late at night.  I guess that's not a bad problem to have.  I also kind of wish they would get a full liquor license and take that creative pizza combo creating mind into the cocktail realm.  I mean...Mike's Hot Honey + Whiskey?  Maybe?---------* If you can't find a pizza you like on the printed menu in the restaurant, whip out the smartphone and check out the ""secret"" menu on the website.** This actually happened.",4.0
"We've literally flown across the country to enjoy his pizza. It's that good! Walking in, the aroma of pizza cooking in a brick oven hits your nose.This is about time my stomach starts to growl. The vibe is flowing with positive energy, and the low lighting is flattering & sexy. The bar to the left is where you can order a beverage while you wait.  They have a decent beer selection. Wait times vary, but it's usually not as long as anticipated, and well worth the effort.Everyone, including the servers, seem happy to be there.Paulie Gee is the utmost host. He's always found time to come to our table with suggestions, stories, and the occasional limoncello, (his recipe of the celebratory cocktail).Talking with him, I've gathered that he makes the vegan pizza for the people, or demand for it, but he didn't seem interested in the cause. The funky bathrooms can be a challenge to use when you've had one too many! VEGAN Pies we LOVE Simply RedVegan Tomato Sauce with Tomatoes, Olive Oil. Vidalia Onions, Garlic, Basil, Salt and PepperVegan Daniela SpinaciBaby Spinach, Olive Oil, Fresh Sliced Garlic, Mild Aleppo Chili Oil and Sea SaltIn Ricotta Da VeganVegan Tomato Sauce, House Made Vegan Sausage, Post-oven House Made Cashew Ricotta Dollops, Baby Arugula and Extra Virgin Olive OilWith many return visits, we've yet to have a negative experience.There has been noise over the years of Paulie Giannone opening a Portland outpost, but it has yet to materialize. Meanwhile, I'll dream of his pizza.",5.0
"Absolutely delicious. Huge selection of pies - good for meatatarians, vegetarians, and even vegans. Wood fire oven delivers the signature light smoke and char. Dough is absolutely tender and springy. They even let the pizza rest afterwards so the cheese sets and you don't burn the crap out of your mouth.Hellboy- spicy pepperoni with hot honey. Absolute classic pizza. Hot honey perfectly blankets the spicy meat. Super simple, absolutely delicious. Get two, trust meRicotta/sausage pie - similar to one above, hot honey included. However ricotta and sausage are a welcome addition. While chunks of roasted garlic are an excellent accentSo many other pies, go try them for yourself.Big lines, put your name down and go drink at browerij lane.

"One of the challenges of  being vegan is getting your friends/family to be open to the idea of trying vegan food.I have never had Vegan Pizza before and I usually try to try a restaurant first before recommending to anyone especially a non vegan but I took a chance.When we first arrived we were having trouble picking something since everything was foreign to us. Someone sitting next to us saw our struggle and took us to try the  IN Ricotta Da Vegan so we did. AMAZING!! My non vegan date was impressed and I was so happy.Thanks Paulie Gee for making me looking good Whew! One pie (6 small slices) goes for 16 bucks . Its small, nice ambiance I would say its a little darkI would go again!Menu like here ------ pauliegee.com/greenpoint… xoxoC.",4.0
"Some of the best za in the city, bar none. The lady and I traveled far and wide for it since we'd heard such great things. It was a Friday night so the restaurant was predictably packed. There's not much in the form of a waiting area, which particularly sucked given how freezing the weather was, but we had a feeling the pie would be well worth the wait (plus we also got to watch a tipsy couple aggressively suck face up close and personal which was an unexpected but enjoyable twist).The vibe was cool, featuring low--lighting, a huge and beautiful custom brick oven, and trendy attractive people who's favorite bands you've never heard of.When we finally were seated I was stoked to see the menu offered a huge variety of pies with all sorts of niche toppings AND vegan options(I personally don't give two damns about veganism but they presented them in an unpretentious way so I was cool with it). We eventually decided to go with the Hell Boy and the Prokypineapple, both of which were amazing, and I'm looking forward to going back and further chowing my way down the menu.Go here.",5.0
"After a 2-hours wait on a weekend for a party of 2, we finally got a table at the renowned pizza shop in Brooklyn. After having one of the best pizzas of all time at Little Isabella located in Baltimore, I was on the mission to find its companion in NYC. Overhyped as we suspected, Paulie Gee had nothing on Little Isabella! Perhaps, it was the quirky blend of sweet and savory flavors, but with that 2-hour wait, we surely did not have a pleasing experience.We ordered two pies: HellBoy and Greenpointer. HellBoy: Fresh Mozzarella, Italian Tomatoes, Berkshire Sopressata Piccante, Parmigiano Reggiano and Mike's HOT HoneyGreenpointer:Fresh Mozzarella, Baby Arugula, Olive Oil, Fresh Lemon Juice and Shaved Parmigiano ReggianoWe didn't really enjoy the sweetness of the honey in the HellBoy or the sourness of the lemon juice in the Greenpointer. Fresh, as we saw them make each pie to order, I definitely thought the doughiness of the pizza wasn't anything spectacular. In terms of service, I think it was pretty solid. Our waiter was patient and helpful. As a surprise, Paulie Gee himself introduced himself to just about every table, making it feel quite personable. In all, I definitely wouldn't return back to this pizzeria, especially with that crazy wait. During that 2-hour wait and 1.5-hour dining time, I can drive down to Baltimore and get some Little Isabella for half the price and no wait!",3.0
"3.5 stars for this pizza joint hidden behind a HUGE wooden door all the way down Franklin streetCrust was good with a nice char on the hellboy but the crust of the greenpoint pizza seemed a bit underdone We were quoted a 1.5 hour wait at 8pm for 3 on a Saturday but we were lucky that people in front of us hadn't returned so we were seated right away! (so don't be discouraged)---hellboy: everything was good about this except that spicy honey! Should of gone with a more classic margherita style pizza instead---greenpoint: fresh arugula, with a bit too much lemon juice, so nothing special NOTE: they don't have pepper flakes, only chili oil",4.0
"If you want great pizza and the right atmosphere look no further than Paulie Gee's. We sat at the bar (luckily) and avoided a two hour wait.  The pizza choices are numerous, with some very creative options. There were three of us and we started with two pies. Would have been content but it was so good we ordered a third.The texture. The crust. The toppings. Hard pressed to mention anything I didn't like. I love pizza and this place is right up there with the best. That includes many pizzerias throughout Italy.Paulie stopped by for a chat and he has a fantastic personality. Great stories and it is obvious that he loves what he does and holds him team to very high standards.He was also kind enough to give me an official Paulie Gee's pin and a limoncello. A very nice touch!Make sure you check out the pizza oven in the back. It's a small,cozy place so don't pass this place up in you are in NY.",5.0
I take my pizza very seriously. The vegan pizza is so good here that if they didn't tell you it was vegan you would have no clue. I had the pie with vegan sausage and shared a few others with friends. It was all out of this world. I can't wait to go back again.,5.0
"There's a LOT of really great pizza in NYC, that's nothing new. But combine amazing pizza with friendly, caring service and a killer ambiance, and Paulie Gee's has a leg up on a lot of the other heavy hitters. The wait can be crazy, but we came in on a Tuesday night and it was half empty. I guess the key is to come when there's post-blizzard sludge everywhere and no one else wants to go out. Paulie Gee was there as I'm told he usually is, weaving around the space with his cup of coffee and stopping at literally every table. For us, he offered to curate our pizza order and who were we to argue? Read on for what Paulie Gee himself recommends:- The Greenpointer: according to Paulie, basically like eating a salad due to the piles of fresh baby arugula on top. - The Mo Cheeks: My personal favorite of the meal. The pickled onions on there are a nice surprise, and give a nice kick to the rest of the ingredients. - The Monte Cristo: OK, so this is probably something I would never think to order myself, but I'm glad it came out for us because it's actually super tasty. It comes with Canadian bacon and a drizzle of maple syrup, which I know sounds weird but trust me (or rather, trust Paulie). - I didn't catch the name of the last pizza, but it was one of the best and after peeking at the menu again I think it might have been the Hellboy. It was piled high with the tastiest Berkshire Sopressata, and it was perfect with the side of Mike's hot honey (which you haven't tried on pizza you must immediately). They asked if we wanted a dessert pizza but at that point we were stuffed to the gills. It was one of the best New York pizza experiences I've had so far, and the service is what really puts them above and beyond. I'm going to run for vice-president of the Paulie Gee fanclub soon!",5.0
"Came here a few days ago with my friend after work. Very dark inside, took some time for my eyeballs to adjust lol. We started off with some beers and then went with the Hellboy which was AMAZING. The hot honey makes a difference! Then we went with a vegan pie since neither one of us was particularly full. We ordered one with spinach, sea salt and garlic on it (sorry don't remember the name!) It was OK, not that memorable. The standout is by far Hellboy, the crust for both pizzas was SUPER THIN, firm and didn't fall apart on me. We both liked it. I took off a star for the spinach pie being nothing special and that it's a bit on the pricey side. Overall, I think I'll be back to try the other pizzas on the menu!",4.0
"Maybe we came on an off night, but we didn't care too much about the pizza and it was definitely not the best we've had. My friend wanted to celebrate her belated birthday at Paulie Gee's and so we did. We ordered 3 pies (Greenpointer, Ricotta Be Kidding Me, and The Hometown Brisket). I think the Hometown Brisket was our favorite only because of the BBQ sauce. Other than that, there wasn't much brisket pieces on the pizza. Ricotta Be Kidding Me was okay. The Greenpointer was all greens so that balanced our meal a little bit. I hear people waiting for hours to get a seat here and right now I'm just wondering where all the hype went? We came when they were opening, so thank goodness we didn't wait on line for this...cause it wouldn't have been worth it. FYI: There's no sign outside that says ""Paulie Gee's"". You just have to look by the address number ""60"" in order to find this place. I actually walked passed it while we were trying to find it. Also, use your flash on your phones to read the menu. I really liked the rustic interior but it was literally pitch black in there.",3.0
"Zagat rated the hellboy as the best pizza in NYC. Wow! Big call Zagat... We had to try! We would say it was delicious... But I would have to say Marta is equal of not just ahead. We got here at 6:40 and had to wait over an hr to sit at the bar. When getting here service was prompt and food was great! We ordered the hellboy and the hellified porkpie white and I have to say it was fresh, full of flavor and great value. My only critique would be more hot suppressa on the hellified and take numbers at the door! It's a little unreasonable to ask people to wait 90 mins and not offer to call when table it ready. Either way it was great but probably won't be crossing the river to wait another 90 mins.",4.0
"If there was ever a restaurant that inspires the need for #PiDay (3.14) to be everyday, it is Paulie Gee's. The pizza is a true art, and every bite is important, from the center to the crust crust.  PG is located in pizza heaven, or right near the water on Greenpoint Ave if you want a Google Map friendly address.Read it on my blog: highclasstohighlifes.com…As you'll see below I'm constantly on the proscuitt of happiness but this time we went for a different ham, Canadian bacon, and on the Monte Cristo. You bet it counted towards happiness. This pizza combines maple syrup drizzle and gouda with the ham. Yes, yes and more yes. Paulie asked if we had butter on the crust...sadly, no. SO MUCH REGRET....that I'll be back in no time to try it. You'll notice on the menu that they have a brisket pizza that features Hometown BBQ -- I love this local BK collaboration. You can get sauced the other way too with Greenpoint local brews!Anyway, I have nearly eaten my way through the entire menu (still need to do a bit of adventuring on the vegan side, every time I get close, I just want meat...) and I have been very pleased with every slice thus far. Therefore my advice to you is go with the pizza that's toppings are most appealing...or grab a handful of friends and share, then you can try multiple pizzas!The man, who is not a myth, but definitely a legend is often found inside checking in on tables, ensuring quality control and getting to know the patrons. He loved my last Instagram post that did a little play words...sharing that I was on the prosciutt of happiness with his King Henry Classic. He's always all smiles and usually wearing a great hat, he is Paulie Gee himself. Paulie Gee's - High Class to High Lifes If you really knead to get delivery or pickup, you'll have to look elsewhere for now though. The only way to leave Paulie Gee's with a to-go box is with leftovers. Rumor has it that a slice joint is opening up nearby though! I'm counting down the days, hours and minutes. Want to keep drooling? Read the menu!Pro Tip: Grab dinner at Paulie Gee's then walk straight out on the water in Greenpoint to Transmitter park or the outlook. Maybe even catch a sunset and BYO night cap!",5.0
"My old pal Carlos and I visited Paulie Gee's last night and had a great meal. I'm accustomed to going with the ol' vegan girlfriend and have a tradition where we split two pies from their extensive vegan selection, so we can try two different types of pies. The vegan and non-vegan selections are both extensive; each category has at least a half dozen kinds of pies, including oil bases, white slices, marinara, spinach-based, spicy honey and barbecue sauce foundations. The pies are aesthetically pleasing to every sense, well, every sense except sound. It's usually better when sound isn't a factor. At least when you're talking about food. When you're talking about music, sound is obviously a very important sense to talk about. I may go as far as to say that in a conversation about music, sound is the only sense that matters.I was excited to go with Carlos because I was going to get to eat their meat and actual cheese. The Paulie Gee's brisket is lean and delicious. Their pickled red onions possess a truly memorable tang and are worth spending a couple buck to add on to pretty much any pie. The ricotta dollops on the Ricky Ricotta feel more like bursts of a cream sauce than regular old cheese. Interestingly, the dairy and non-dairy ricotta cheeses are almost indecipherable in quality, which goes to show that Paulie Gee's knows what's up. Carlos and I were pleased to compliment the trad Italian flavors of the Ricky Ricotta with a tangy Barbecue Brisket pie. I'm psyched to go with a fellow omnivore again, because there are tons of other flavor combos I'm eager to try. New Yorkers, such as myself, are notorious for being dicks about the quality of pizza dough. It's the dough that invalidates the Chicago Deep Dish's false aspiration to pizza status. I can't stand Sicilian pizza either, which is a controversial take in Nueva York. Anyhow, no matter how well adorned a Paulie Gee's pie is, its base--the crust--is its most distinct and wonderful element. The crust is thin but springy, and always a little charred. It's pretty much naan bread, which is either a very luck coincidence or a visionary innovation. Naan bread, as you know, is lit, and, as it turns out, it is the perfect surface upon which various pizza ingredients should be placed and/or spread to mingle harmoniously.I've visited Paulie Gee's a number of times, and there's a bit of narrative that forms around my visits. The first time I tried to go, it was around noon, and my gf and I made the unpleasant discovery that Paulie Gee's does not open til 5 PM. The next time, we rolled up in a deep crew of six and had to wait about two to three hours for a table for six. If you find yourself in that position, you'll be okay though because there are plenty of bars around. There's also the water/skyline, mere yards away and a nice record store a block away.The gf and I have gone a few other times and it's always been great--except for the one time that a camera crew was shooting a special on Paulie Gee's vegan options.

"New York probably takes its pizza more seriously than anywhere else in the world.  I'm sure there are 7 or 8 people reading this right now that would be willing to shiv a guy for saying something bad about their favorite slice.  With that in mind, Paulie Gee's is a pizza lover's pizza place.  They make Neapolitan style pizzas with an oven shipped in from Naples and lovingly reassembled by small, Italian elves.  From this oven, comes perfectly leopard-spotted pizzas with just the right amount of bouncy chewy dough.To top the pizza, there's a lovingly curated selection to choose from so don't you dare ask for substitutions.  Lucky for you whether you're a vegan, vegetarian, white/red pie lover, averse to spice, meat lover, or whatever!  There's at least one pie on the menu* that will make you say, ""hmmm..."".  My personal favorites are the Mo' Cheeks ($16, has guanciale and is perfect with the pickled onions) and Ricotta Be Kidding Me ($17, with tons of meat topped with adorable dollops of cottage cheese).  I've only ever had 1 pizza there that wasn't stellar and I won't tell you which one because you'll definitely judge me for choosing it in the first place.The atmosphere at Paulie Gee's is great.  It's quintessential Brooklyn.  Think dark unfinished wood walls with an eclectic collection of tables made from reclaimed wood, music consisting of a mixture of jazz, rock, and anything but top 40s.  What always makes my night is that the ACTUAL Paulie Gee walks around and talks to EVERYONE.  It doesn't matter if Keri Russell** is sitting right next to you, he will still come by and have a 5-20 minute conversation with you and your table.  My only complaint is how popular this place is.  They've stopped making pizzas to go and still, the wait is crazy.  I've never been able to get a table in less than 45 minutes unless it was late at night.  I guess that's not a bad problem to have.  I also kind of wish they would get a full liquor license and take that creative pizza combo creating mind into the cocktail realm.  I mean...Mike's Hot Honey + Whiskey?  Maybe?---------* If you can't find a pizza you like on the printed menu in the restaurant, whip out the smartphone and check out the ""secret"" menu on the website.** This actually happened.",4.0

"Some of the best za in the city, bar none. The lady and I traveled far and wide for it since we'd heard such great things. It was a Friday night so the restaurant was predictably packed. There's not much in the form of a waiting area, which particularly sucked given how freezing the weather was, but we had a feeling the pie would be well worth the wait (plus we also got to watch a tipsy couple aggressively suck face up close and personal which was an unexpected but enjoyable twist).The vibe was cool, featuring low--lighting, a huge and beautiful custom brick oven, and trendy attractive people who's favorite bands you've never heard of.When we finally were seated I was stoked to see the menu offered a huge variety of pies with all sorts of niche toppings AND vegan options(I personally don't give two damns about veganism but they presented them in an unpretentious way so I was cool with it).

"After a 2-hours wait on a weekend for a party of 2, we finally got a table at the renowned pizza shop in Brooklyn. After having one of the best pizzas of all time at Little Isabella located in Baltimore, I was on the mission to find its companion in NYC. Overhyped as we suspected, Paulie Gee had nothing on Little Isabella! Perhaps, it was the quirky blend of sweet and savory flavors, but with that 2-hour wait, we surely did not have a pleasing experience.We ordered two pies: HellBoy and Greenpointer. HellBoy: Fresh Mozzarella, Italian Tomatoes, Berkshire Sopressata Piccante, Parmigiano Reggiano and Mike's HOT HoneyGreenpointer:Fresh Mozzarella, Baby Arugula, Olive Oil, Fresh Lemon Juice and Shaved Parmigiano ReggianoWe didn't really enjoy the sweetness of the honey in the HellBoy or the sourness of the lemon juice in the Greenpointer. Fresh, as we saw them make each pie to order, I definitely thought the doughiness of the pizza wasn't anything spectacular. In terms of service, I think it was pretty solid. Our waiter was patient and helpful. As a surprise, Paulie Gee himself introduced himself to just about every table, making it feel quite personable. In all, I definitely wouldn't return back to this pizzeria, especially with that crazy wait. During that 2-hour wait and 1.5-hour dining time, I can drive down to Baltimore and get some Little Isabella for half the price and no wait!",3.0
"3.5 stars for this pizza joint hidden behind a HUGE wooden door all the way down Franklin streetCrust was good with a nice char on the hellboy but the crust of the greenpoint pizza seemed a bit underdone We were quoted a 1.5 hour wait at 8pm for 3 on a Saturday but we were lucky that people in front of us hadn't returned so we were seated right away! (so don't be discouraged)---hellboy: everything was good about this except that spicy honey! Should of gone with a more classic margherita style pizza instead---greenpoint: fresh arugula, with a bit too much lemon juice, so nothing special NOTE: they don't have pepper flakes, only chili oil",4.0
"If you want great pizza and the right atmosphere look no further than Paulie Gee's. We sat at the bar (luckily) and avoided a two hour wait.  The pizza choices are numerous, with some very creative options. There were three of us and we started with two pies. Would have been content but it was so good we ordered a third.The texture. The crust. The toppings. Hard pressed to mention anything I didn't like. I love pizza and this place is right up there with the best. That includes many pizzerias throughout Italy.Paulie stopped by for a chat and he has a fantastic personality. Great stories and it is obvious that he loves what he does and holds him team to very high standards.He was also kind enough to give me an official Paulie Gee's pin and a limoncello. A very nice touch!Make sure you check out the pizza oven in the back. It's a small,cozy place so don't pass this place up in you are in NY.",5.0
I take my pizza very seriously. The vegan pizza is so good here that if they didn't tell you it was vegan you would have no clue. I had the pie with vegan sausage and shared a few others with friends. It was all out of this world. I can't wait to go back again.,5.0
"There's a LOT of really great pizza in NYC, that's nothing new. But combine amazing pizza with friendly, caring service and a killer ambiance, and Paulie Gee's has a leg up on a lot of the other heavy hitters. The wait can be crazy, but we came in on a Tuesday night and it was half empty. I guess the key is to come when there's post-blizzard sludge everywhere and no one else wants to go out. Paulie Gee was there as I'm told he usually is, weaving around the space with his cup of coffee and stopping at literally every table. For us, he offered to curate our pizza order and who were we to argue? Read on for what Paulie Gee himself recommends:- The Greenpointer: according to Paulie, basically like eating a salad due to the piles of fresh baby arugula on top. - The Mo Cheeks: My personal favorite of the meal. The pickled onions on there are a nice surprise, and give a nice kick to the rest of the ingredients. - The Monte Cristo: OK, so this is probably something I would never think to order myself, but I'm glad it came out for us because it's actually super tasty. It comes with Canadian bacon and a drizzle of maple syrup, which I know sounds weird but trust me (or rather, trust Paulie). - I didn't catch the name of the last pizza, but it was one of the best and after peeking at the menu again I think it might have been the Hellboy. It was piled high with the tastiest Berkshire Sopressata, and it was perfect with the side of Mike's hot honey (which you haven't tried on pizza you must immediately). They asked if we wanted a dessert pizza but at that point we were stuffed to the gills. It was one of the best New York pizza experiences I've had so far, and the service is what really puts them above and beyond. I'm going to run for vice-president of the Paulie Gee fanclub soon!",5.0
"Came here a few days ago with my friend after work. Very dark inside, took some time for my eyeballs to adjust lol. We started off with some beers and then went with the Hellboy which was AMAZING. The hot honey makes a difference! Then we went with a vegan pie since neither one of us was particularly full. We ordered one with spinach, sea salt and garlic on it (sorry don't remember the name!) It was OK, not that memorable. The standout is by far Hellboy, the crust for both pizzas was SUPER THIN, firm and didn't fall apart on me. We both liked it. I took off a star for the spinach pie being nothing special and that it's a bit on the pricey side. Overall, I think I'll be back to try the other pizzas on the menu!",4.0
"Maybe we came on an off night, but we didn't care too much about the pizza and it was definitely not the best we've had. My friend wanted to celebrate her belated birthday at Paulie Gee's and so we did. We ordered 3 pies (Greenpointer, Ricotta Be Kidding Me, and The Hometown Brisket). I think the Hometown Brisket was our favorite only because of the BBQ sauce. Other than that, there wasn't much brisket pieces on the pizza. Ricotta Be Kidding Me was okay. The Greenpointer was all greens so that balanced our meal a little bit. I hear people waiting for hours to get a seat here and right now I'm just wondering where all the hype went? We came when they were opening, so thank goodness we didn't wait on line for this...cause it wouldn't have been worth it. FYI: There's no sign outside that says ""Paulie Gee's"". You just have to look by the address number ""60"" in order to find this place. I actually walked passed it while we were trying to find it. Also, use your flash on your phones to read the menu. I really liked the rustic interior but it was literally pitch black in there.",3.0
"Zagat rated the hellboy as the best pizza in NYC. Wow! Big call Zagat... We had to try! We would say it was delicious... But I would have to say Marta is equal of not just ahead. We got here at 6:40 and had to wait over an hr to sit at the bar. When getting here service was prompt and food was great! We ordered the hellboy and the hellified porkpie white and I have to say it was fresh, full of flavor and great value. My only critique would be more hot suppressa on the hellified and take numbers at the door! It's a little unreasonable to ask people to wait 90 mins and not offer to call when table it ready. Either way it was great but probably won't be crossing the river to wait another 90 mins.",4.0
"If there was ever a restaurant that inspires the need for #PiDay (3.14) to be everyday, it is Paulie Gee's. The pizza is a true art, and every bite is important, from the center to the crust crust.  PG is located in pizza heaven, or right near the water on Greenpoint Ave if you want a Google Map friendly address.Read it on my blog: highclasstohighlifes.com…As you'll see below I'm constantly on the proscuitt of happiness but this time we went for a different ham, Canadian bacon, and on the Monte Cristo. You bet it counted towards happiness. This pizza combines maple syrup drizzle and gouda with the ham. Yes, yes and more yes. Paulie asked if we had butter on the crust...sadly, no. SO MUCH REGRET....that I'll be back in no time to try it. You'll notice on the menu that they have a brisket pizza that features Hometown BBQ -- I love this local BK collaboration. You can get sauced the other way too with Greenpoint local brews!Anyway, I have nearly eaten my way through the entire menu (still need to do a bit of adventuring on the vegan side, every time I get close, I just want meat...) and I have been very pleased with every slice thus far. Therefore my advice to you is go with the pizza that's toppings are most appealing...or grab a handful of friends and share, then you can try multiple pizzas!The man, who is not a myth, but definitely a legend is often found inside checking in on tables, ensuring quality control and getting to know the patrons. He loved my last Instagram post that did a little play words...sharing that I was on the prosciutt of happiness with his King Henry Classic. He's always all smiles and usually wearing a great hat, he is Paulie Gee himself. Paulie Gee's - High Class to High Lifes If you really knead to get delivery or pickup, you'll have to look elsewhere for now though. The only way to leave Paulie Gee's with a to-go box is with leftovers. Rumor has it that a slice joint is opening up nearby though! I'm counting down the days, hours and minutes. Want to keep drooling? Read the menu!Pro Tip: Grab dinner at Paulie Gee's then walk straight out on the water in Greenpoint to Transmitter park or the outlook. Maybe even catch a sunset and BYO night cap!",5.0
"My old pal Carlos and I visited Paulie Gee's last night and had a great meal. I'm accustomed to going with the ol' vegan girlfriend and have a tradition where we split two pies from their extensive vegan selection, so we can try two different types of pies. The vegan and non-vegan selections are both extensive; each category has at least a half dozen kinds of pies, including oil bases, white slices, marinara, spinach-based, spicy honey and barbecue sauce foundations. The pies are aesthetically pleasing to every sense, well, every sense except sound. It's usually better when sound isn't a factor. At least when you're talking about food. When you're talking about music, sound is obviously a very important sense to talk about. I may go as far as to say that in a conversation about music, sound is the only sense that matters.I was excited to go with Carlos because I was going to get to eat their meat and actual cheese. The Paulie Gee's brisket is lean and delicious. Their pickled red onions possess a truly memorable tang and are worth spending a couple buck to add on to pretty much any pie. The ricotta dollops on the Ricky Ricotta feel more like bursts of a cream sauce than regular old cheese. Interestingly, the dairy and non-dairy ricotta cheeses are almost indecipherable in quality, which goes to show that Paulie Gee's knows what's up. Carlos and I were pleased to compliment the trad Italian flavors of the Ricky Ricotta with a tangy Barbecue Brisket pie. I'm psyched to go with a fellow omnivore again, because there are tons of other flavor combos I'm eager to try. New Yorkers, such as myself, are notorious for being dicks about the quality of pizza dough. It's the dough that invalidates the Chicago Deep Dish's false aspiration to pizza status. I can't stand Sicilian pizza either, which is a controversial take in Nueva York. Anyhow, no matter how well adorned a Paulie Gee's pie is, its base--the crust--is its most distinct and wonderful element. The crust is thin but springy, and always a little charred. It's pretty much naan bread, which is either a very luck coincidence or a visionary innovation. Naan bread, as you know, is lit, and, as it turns out, it is the perfect surface upon which various pizza ingredients should be placed and/or spread to mingle harmoniously.I've visited Paulie Gee's a number of times, and there's a bit of narrative that forms around my visits. The first time I tried to go, it was around noon, and my gf and I made the unpleasant discovery that Paulie Gee's does not open til 5 PM. The next time, we rolled up in a deep crew of six and had to wait about two to three hours for a table for six. If you find yourself in that position, you'll be okay though because there are plenty of bars around. There's also the water/skyline, mere yards away and a nice record store a block away.The gf and I have gone a few other times and it's always been great--except for the one time that a camera crew was shooting a special on Paulie Gee's vegan options. My girlfriend and I were in the shot all throughout our meal, and we were fighting (as subtly as possible) for the duration of our meal. I was taken aback and somewhat miffed when the producers of the show asked to do a talking head with us outside. The tension was palpable but they still insisted on interviewing us. I really do believe that you should foot the bill if you're going to interview someone for your television series or web series or gratuitously long Yelp review or whatever. At LEAST commission me to write a song for the soundtrack.In closing, I would like to offer a lil sum sum for the ladies. Are you interested in grandfatherly, charmingly blue collar, short men whose personalities closely resemble those of most Robert De Niro characters--but only in David O. Russel movies? If you do, and might want to be possibly hit on by a man of this caliber, you will love Paulie Gee's. At all times, Paulie Gee's eponymous Pizza Architect and Entrepreneur, Paulie Gee, stalks the narrow spaces between tables, checking in with customers--particularly of the reasonably attractive female demographic--and asks them how their food is, making small talk and thanking them for their patronage. I think this is cool. I would do the same if I were in his position, so don't take this the wrong way. Central to Paulie Gee's game is his ability to recommend a pizza place in seemingly every zip code on the planet and his inclination to tell you (the lady in question) the name of the dude who works there/owns the place, and to tell you (still the lady in question) to tell the dude (who owns the pizza place) to say that he (Paulie Gee) says hi. The Brotherhood of Pizza Mans is truly alive and well.",5.0

"I almost feel like it's blasphemy for not giving 5 stars. Finally made my way over here at Paulie Gees after way too long. Clearly this place is GPs staple so was excited to drop by on Wednesday night.There was no wait- very good. I had been worried about this so called 3x around 6:45pm to see how long it was before heading over. No one picked up and their answering service basically hangs up on you. I ordered the Daniela and he ordered the brisket pizza. Mine came out a good 7 minutes before his. I noticed immediately that about 40% of the crust was charred to the point of being inedible. To top that off, the spinach topping my pizza was the same. It was literally a black piece of ash and when I picked a leaf up or crumbled in my hands. The cheese blend was very good (mozzarella and Parmesan) but the pizza was just not good. To top it off, parts of the center were soggy and didn't hold the toppings when I grabbed a slice. When the brisket pizza came out a few minutes later I noticed immediately that it was cooked perfectly. The crust was edible and delicious. I was bummed that mine didn't come out this way especially since it seemed like a classic. All I can say is they probably put our orders in together and maybe his needed a little longer in the oven. Mine was most likely getting over cooked while his needed a few more minutes. Hence the gap in time between both of our orders coming out and the reason why mine was half done by the time his came out.I was really disappointed but the good thing to know is at least the brisket pizza was cooked well. I know there is a good meal at Paulie Gees but I feel like we were jipped.Also, great touch that Paulie himself came in to greet all the diners. He was super friendly and it brings a family quality to the place. This is maybe one of the main reasons I'd come back.",3.0
"Delicious!! Definitely made my top 3 favorite pizza  places (the others being robertas and best pizza). We've been meaning to come forever but the line is always so long. We were finally seated right away on a Friday night because we ran over as soon as they opened at 6pm. I would highly recommend this tactic to those of you who have been meaning to come and haven't been able to due to the wait -- the food will be worth it. We ordered the hellboy, ricotta be kidding me and the hot honey ice cream Sunday for dessert. The hellboy was our fave. It was basically a pepperoni pizza with hot honey lined under the cheese. I liked it more than the bees sting from Robertas but both are very good. All in all would highly recommend. As an extra plus Paulie Gee was hanging around today,though it seems like he does this quite often, going from table to table talking to the customers.",5.0
"My husband and I visited Paulie Gee's about two years ago and he still dreams of the Hellboy. This time we ordered the Hellboy and Cherry Jones.  The Hellboy was great but just a touch too sweet for me.  The hot honey adds a little kick but is definitely not too hot.  My husband will tell you it is the best pizza he has ever had (saying a lot since he was raised in the Bronx).  The Cherry Jones on the other hand was way too sweet for both of us.  I couldn't taste anything other then honey.  My husband embarrassed me by telling the waitress we didn't like it.  She offered us a replacement.  We ordered the Ricky Ricotta.  It was alright.  I was shocked because the ricotta was not warm.  The crust at Paulie Gee's is the perfect texture.  However, two of our three pizzas were too charred for my taste.  I must mention Paulie walks around all the tables to make sure everyone is enjoying.  Love it!  The restaurant is too dark and loud for my taste.",3.0
"Interesting decor, super dark inside and it was hard to read the menu. We were seated under one of the speakers, so I felt like an old person complaining about how loud the music was, but really, we came for the food. Split a salad and a Greenpointer pie, and neither disappointed. Both were served quickly, and the pie just exploded with flavor. The lemon kick was strong but not overwhelming, and the crust was perfection. Service was attentive, friendly, and efficient. Lots of menu choices for anything your palate is craving. Overall, a very good experience, and one I would look forward to enjoying again.",4.0

I take my pizza very seriously. The vegan pizza is so good here that if they didn't tell you it was vegan you would have no clue. I had the pie with vegan sausage and shared a few others with friends. It was all out of this world. I can't wait to go back again.,5.0
"There's a LOT of really great pizza in NYC, that's nothing new. But combine amazing pizza with friendly, caring service and a killer ambiance, and Paulie Gee's has a leg up on a lot of the other heavy hitters. The wait can be crazy, but we came in on a Tuesday night and it was half empty. I guess the key is to come when there's post-blizzard sludge everywhere and no one else wants to go out. Paulie Gee was there as I'm told he usually is, weaving around the space with his cup of coffee and stopping at literally every table. For us, he offered to curate our pizza order and who were we to argue? Read on for what Paulie Gee himself recommends:- The Greenpointer: according to Paulie, basically like eating a salad due to the piles of fresh baby arugula on top. - The Mo Cheeks: My personal favorite of the meal. The pickled onions on there are a nice surprise, and give a nice kick to the rest of the ingredients. - The Monte Cristo: OK, so this is probably something I would never think to order myself, but I'm glad it came out for us because it's actually super tasty. It comes with Canadian bacon and a drizzle of maple syrup, which I know sounds weird but trust me (or rather, trust Paulie). - I didn't catch the name of the last pizza, but it was one of the best and after peeking at the menu again I think it might have been the Hellboy. It was piled high with the tastiest Berkshire Sopressata, and it was perfect with the side of Mike's hot honey (which you haven't tried on pizza you must immediately). They asked if we wanted a dessert pizza but at that point we were stuffed to the gills. It was one of the best New York pizza experiences I've had so far, and the service is what really puts them above and beyond. I'm going to run for vice-president of the Paulie Gee fanclub soon!",5.0

It was OK, not that memorable. The standout is by far Hellboy, the crust for both pizzas was SUPER THIN, firm and didn't fall apart on me. We both liked it.

My friend wanted to celebrate her belated birthday at Paulie Gee's and so we did. We ordered 3 pies (Greenpointer, Ricotta Be Kidding Me, and The Hometown Brisket). I think the Hometown Brisket was our favorite only because of the BBQ sauce. Other than that, there wasn't much brisket pieces on the pizza. Ricotta Be Kidding Me was okay. The Greenpointer was all greens so that balanced our meal a little bit. I hear people waiting for hours to get a seat here and right now I'm just wondering where all the hype went? We came when they were opening, so thank goodness we didn't wait on line for this...cause it wouldn't have been worth it. FYI: There's no sign outside that says ""Paulie Gee's"".

"My old pal Carlos and I visited Paulie Gee's last night and had a great meal. I'm accustomed to going with the ol' vegan girlfriend and have a tradition where we split two pies from their extensive vegan selection, so we can try two different types of pies. The vegan and non-vegan selections are both extensive; each category has at least a half dozen kinds of pies, including oil bases, white slices, marinara, spinach-based, spicy honey and barbecue sauce foundations. The pies are aesthetically pleasing to every sense, well, every sense except sound. It's usually better when sound isn't a factor. At least when you're talking about food. When you're talking about music, sound is obviously a very important sense to talk about. I may go as far as to say that in a conversation about music, sound is the only sense that matters.I was excited to go with Carlos because I was going to get to eat their meat and actual cheese. The Paulie Gee's brisket is lean and delicious. Their pickled red onions possess a truly memorable tang and are worth spending a couple buck to add on to pretty much any pie. The ricotta dollops on the Ricky Ricotta feel more like bursts of a cream sauce than regular old cheese. Interestingly, the dairy and non-dairy ricotta cheeses are almost indecipherable in quality, which goes to show that Paulie Gee's knows what's up. Carlos and I were pleased to compliment the trad Italian flavors of the Ricky Ricotta with a tangy Barbecue Brisket pie. I'm psyched to go with a fellow omnivore again, because there are tons of other flavor combos I'm eager to try. New Yorkers, such as myself, are notorious for being dicks about the quality of pizza dough. It's the dough that invalidates the Chicago Deep Dish's false aspiration to pizza status. I can't stand Sicilian pizza either, which is a controversial take in Nueva York. Anyhow, no matter how well adorned a Paulie Gee's pie is, its base--the crust--is its most distinct and wonderful element. The crust is thin but springy, and always a little charred. It's pretty much naan bread, which is either a very luck coincidence or a visionary innovation. Naan bread, as you know, is lit, and, as it turns out, it is the perfect surface upon which various pizza ingredients should be placed and/or spread to mingle harmoniously.I've visited Paulie Gee's a number of times, and there's a bit of narrative that forms around my visits. The first time I tried to go, it was around noon, and my gf and I made the unpleasant discovery that Paulie Gee's does not open til 5 PM. The next time, we rolled up in a deep crew of six and had to wait about two to three hours for a table for six. If you find yourself in that position, you'll be okay though because there are plenty of bars around. There's also the water/skyline, mere yards away and a nice record store a block away.The gf and I have gone a few other times and it's always been great--except for the one time that a camera crew was shooting a special on Paulie Gee's vegan options. My girlfriend and I were in the shot all throughout our meal, and we were fighting (as subtly as possible) for the duration of our meal. I was taken aback and somewhat miffed when the producers of the show asked to do a talking head with us outside. The tension was palpable but they still insisted on interviewing us. I really do believe that you should foot the bill if you're going to interview someone for your television series or web series or gratuitously long Yelp review or whatever. At LEAST commission me to write a song for the soundtrack.In closing, I would like to offer a lil sum sum for the ladies. Are you interested in grandfatherly, charmingly blue collar, short men whose personalities closely resemble those of most Robert De Niro characters--but only in David O. Russel movies? If you do, and might want to be possibly hit on by a man of this caliber, you will love Paulie Gee's. At all times, Paulie Gee's eponymous Pizza Architect and Entrepreneur, Paulie Gee, stalks the narrow spaces between tables, checking in with customers--particularly of the reasonably attractive female demographic--and asks them how their food is, making small talk and thanking them for their patronage. I think this is cool. I would do the same if I were in his position, so don't take this the wrong way. Central to Paulie Gee's game is his ability to recommend a pizza place in seemingly every zip code on the planet and his inclination to tell you (the lady in question) the name of the dude who works there/owns the place, and to tell you (still the lady in question) to tell the dude (who owns the pizza place) to say that he (Paulie Gee) says hi. The Brotherhood of Pizza Mans is truly alive and well.",5.0

"I almost feel like it's blasphemy for not giving 5 stars. Finally made my way over here at Paulie Gees after way too long. Clearly this place is GPs staple so was excited to drop by on Wednesday night.There was no wait- very good. I had been worried about this so called 3x around 6:45pm to see how long it was before heading over. No one picked up and their answering service basically hangs up on you. I ordered the Daniela and he ordered the brisket pizza. Mine came out a good 7 minutes before his. I noticed immediately that about 40% of the crust was charred to the point of being inedible. To top that off, the spinach topping my pizza was the same. It was literally a black piece of ash and when I picked a leaf up or crumbled in my hands. The cheese blend was very good (mozzarella and Parmesan) but the pizza was just not good. To top it off, parts of the center were soggy and didn't hold the toppings when I grabbed a slice. When the brisket pizza came out a few minutes later I noticed immediately that it was cooked perfectly. The crust was edible and delicious. I was bummed that mine didn't come out this way especially since it seemed like a classic. All I can say is they probably put our orders in together and maybe his needed a little longer in the oven. Mine was most likely getting over cooked while his needed a few more minutes. Hence the gap in time between both of our orders coming out and the reason why mine was half done by the time his came out.I was really disappointed but the good thing to know is at least the brisket pizza was cooked well. I know there is a good meal at Paulie Gees but I feel like we were jipped.Also, great touch that Paulie himself came in to greet all the diners. He was super friendly and it brings a family quality to the place. This is maybe one of the main reasons I'd come back.",3.0
"Delicious!! Definitely made my top 3 favorite pizza  places (the others being robertas and best pizza). We've been meaning to come forever but the line is always so long. We were finally seated right away on a Friday night because we ran over as soon as they opened at 6pm. I would highly recommend this tactic to those of you who have been meaning to come and haven't been able to due to the wait -- the food will be worth it. We ordered the hellboy, ricotta be kidding me and the hot honey ice cream Sunday for dessert. The hellboy was our fave. It was basically a pepperoni pizza with hot honey lined under the cheese. I liked it more than the bees sting from Robertas but both are very good. All in all would highly recommend. As an extra plus Paulie Gee was hanging around today,though it seems like he does this quite often, going from table to table talking to the customers.",5.0
"My husband and I visited Paulie Gee's about two years ago and he still dreams of the Hellboy. This time we ordered the Hellboy and Cherry Jones.  The Hellboy was great but just a touch too sweet for me.  The hot honey adds a little kick but is definitely not too hot.  My husband will tell you it is the best pizza he has ever had (saying a lot since he was raised in the Bronx).  The Cherry Jones on the other hand was way too sweet for both of us.  I couldn't taste anything other then honey.  My husband embarrassed me by telling the waitress we didn't like it.  She offered us a replacement.  We ordered the Ricky Ricotta.  It was alright.  I was shocked because the ricotta was not warm.  The crust at Paulie Gee's is the perfect texture.  However, two of our three pizzas were too charred for my taste.  I must mention Paulie walks around all the tables to make sure everyone is enjoying.  Love it!  The restaurant is too dark and loud for my taste.",3.0
"Interesting decor, super dark inside and it was hard to read the menu. We were seated under one of the speakers, so I felt like an old person complaining about how loud the music was, but really, we came for the food. Split a salad and a Greenpointer pie, and neither disappointed. Both were served quickly, and the pie just exploded with flavor. The lemon kick was strong but not overwhelming, and the crust was perfection. Service was attentive, friendly, and efficient. Lots of menu choices for anything your palate is craving. Overall, a very good experience, and one I would look forward to enjoying again.",4.0
"New York probably takes its pizza more seriously than anywhere else in the world.  I'm sure there are 7 or 8 people reading this right now that would be willing to shiv a guy for saying something bad about their favorite slice.  With that in mind, Paulie Gee's is a pizza lover's pizza place.  They make Neapolitan style pizzas with an oven shipped in from Naples and lovingly reassembled by small, Italian elves.  From this oven, comes perfectly leopard-spotted pizzas with just the right amount of bouncy chewy dough.To top the pizza, there's a lovingly curated selection to choose from so don't you dare ask for substitutions.  Lucky for you whether you're a vegan, vegetarian, white/red pie lover, averse to spice, meat lover, or whatever!  There's at least one pie on the menu* that will make you say, ""hmmm..."".  My personal favorites are the Mo' Cheeks ($16, has guanciale and is perfect with the pickled onions) and Ricotta Be Kidding Me ($17, with tons of meat topped with adorable dollops of cottage cheese).  I've only ever had 1 pizza there that wasn't stellar and I won't tell you which one because you'll definitely judge me for choosing it in the first place.The atmosphere at Paulie Gee's is great.  It's quintessential Brooklyn.  Think dark unfinished wood walls with an eclectic collection of tables made from reclaimed wood, music consisting of a mixture of jazz, rock, and anything but top 40s.  What always makes my night is that the ACTUAL Paulie Gee walks around and talks to EVERYONE.  It doesn't matter if Keri Russell** is sitting right next to you, he will still come by and have a 5-20 minute conversation with you and your table.  My only complaint is how popular this place is.  They've stopped making pizzas to go and still, the wait is crazy.  I've never been able to get a table in less than 45 minutes unless it was late at night.  I guess that's not a bad problem to have.  I also kind of wish they would get a full liquor license and take that creative pizza combo creating mind into the cocktail realm.  I mean...Mike's Hot Honey + Whiskey?  Maybe?---------* If you can't find a pizza you like on the printed menu in the restaurant, whip out the smartphone and check out the ""secret"" menu on the website.** This actually happened.",4.0
"We've literally flown across the country to enjoy his pizza. It's that good! Walking in, the aroma of pizza cooking in a brick oven hits your nose.This is about time my stomach starts to growl. The vibe is flowing with positive energy, and the low lighting is flattering & sexy. The bar to the left is where you can order a beverage while you wait.  They have a decent beer selection. Wait times vary, but it's usually not as long as anticipated, and well worth the effort.Everyone, including the servers, seem happy to be there.Paulie Gee is the utmost host. He's always found time to come to our table with suggestions, stories, and the occasional limoncello, (his recipe of the celebratory cocktail).Talking with him, I've gathered that he makes the vegan pizza for the people, or demand for it, but he didn't seem interested in the cause.

"Absolutely delicious. Huge selection of pies - good for meatatarians, vegetarians, and even vegans. Wood fire oven delivers the signature light smoke and char. Dough is absolutely tender and springy. They even let the pizza rest afterwards so the cheese sets and you don't burn the crap out of your mouth.Hellboy- spicy pepperoni with hot honey. Absolute classic pizza. Hot honey perfectly blankets the spicy meat. Super simple, absolutely delicious. Get two, trust meRicotta/sausage pie - similar to one above, hot honey included.

"One of the challenges of  being vegan is getting your friends/family to be open to the idea of trying vegan food.I have never had Vegan Pizza before and I usually try to try a restaurant first before recommending to anyone especially a non vegan but I took a chance.When we first arrived we were having trouble picking something since everything was foreign to us. Someone sitting next to us saw our struggle and took us to try the  IN Ricotta Da Vegan so we did. AMAZING!! My non vegan date was impressed and I was so happy.Thanks Paulie Gee for making me looking good Whew! One pie (6 small slices) goes for 16 bucks .

"Some of the best za in the city, bar none. The lady and I traveled far and wide for it since we'd heard such great things. It was a Friday night so the restaurant was predictably packed. There's not much in the form of a waiting area, which particularly sucked given how freezing the weather was, but we had a feeling the pie would be well worth the wait (plus we also got to watch a tipsy couple aggressively suck face up close and personal which was an unexpected but enjoyable twist).The vibe was cool, featuring low--lighting, a huge and beautiful custom brick oven, and trendy attractive people who's favorite bands you've never heard of.When we finally were seated I was stoked to see the menu offered a huge variety of pies with all sorts of niche toppings AND vegan options(I personally don't give two damns about veganism but they presented them in an unpretentious way so I was cool with it). We eventually decided to go with the Hell Boy and the Prokypineapple, both of which were amazing, and I'm looking forward to going back and further chowing my way down the menu.Go here.",5.0
"After a 2-hours wait on a weekend for a party of 2, we finally got a table at the renowned pizza shop in Brooklyn. After having one of the best pizzas of all time at Little Isabella located in Baltimore, I was on the mission to find its companion in NYC. Overhyped as we suspected, Paulie Gee had nothing on Little Isabella! Perhaps, it was the quirky blend of sweet and savory flavors, but with that 2-hour wait, we surely did not have a pleasing experience.We ordered two pies: HellBoy and Greenpointer. HellBoy: Fresh Mozzarella, Italian Tomatoes, Berkshire Sopressata Piccante, Parmigiano Reggiano and Mike's HOT HoneyGreenpointer:Fresh Mozzarella, Baby Arugula, Olive Oil, Fresh Lemon Juice and Shaved Parmigiano ReggianoWe didn't really enjoy the sweetness of the honey in the HellBoy or the sourness of the lemon juice in the Greenpointer. Fresh, as we saw them make each pie to order, I definitely thought the doughiness of the pizza wasn't anything spectacular. In terms of service, I think it was pretty solid. Our waiter was patient and helpful. As a surprise, Paulie Gee himself introduced himself to just about every table, making it feel quite personable. In all, I definitely wouldn't return back to this pizzeria, especially with that crazy wait.

"My old pal Carlos and I visited Paulie Gee's last night and had a great meal. I'm accustomed to going with the ol' vegan girlfriend and have a tradition where we split two pies from their extensive vegan selection, so we can try two different types of pies. The vegan and non-vegan selections are both extensive; each category has at least a half dozen kinds of pies, including oil bases, white slices, marinara, spinach-based, spicy honey and barbecue sauce foundations. The pies are aesthetically pleasing to every sense, well, every sense except sound. It's usually better when sound isn't a factor. At least when you're talking about food. When you're talking about music, sound is obviously a very important sense to talk about. I may go as far as to say that in a conversation about music, sound is the only sense that matters.I was excited to go with Carlos because I was going to get to eat their meat and actual cheese. The Paulie Gee's brisket is lean and delicious. Their pickled red onions possess a truly memorable tang and are worth spending a couple buck to add on to pretty much any pie. The ricotta dollops on the Ricky Ricotta feel more like bursts of a cream sauce than regular old cheese. Interestingly, the dairy and non-dairy ricotta cheeses are almost indecipherable in quality, which goes to show that Paulie Gee's knows what's up. Carlos and I were pleased to compliment the trad Italian flavors of the Ricky Ricotta with a tangy Barbecue Brisket pie. I'm psyched to go with a fellow omnivore again, because there are tons of other flavor combos I'm eager to try. New Yorkers, such as myself, are notorious for being dicks about the quality of pizza dough. It's the dough that invalidates the Chicago Deep Dish's false aspiration to pizza status. I can't stand Sicilian pizza either, which is a controversial take in Nueva York. Anyhow, no matter how well adorned a Paulie Gee's pie is, its base--the crust--is its most distinct and wonderful element. The crust is thin but springy, and always a little charred. It's pretty much naan bread, which is either a very luck coincidence or a visionary innovation. Naan bread, as you know, is lit, and, as it turns out, it is the perfect surface upon which various pizza ingredients should be placed and/or spread to mingle harmoniously.I've visited Paulie Gee's a number of times, and there's a bit of narrative that forms around my visits. The first time I tried to go, it was around noon, and my gf and I made the unpleasant discovery that Paulie Gee's does not open til 5 PM. The next time, we rolled up in a deep crew of six and had to wait about two to three hours for a table for six. If you find yourself in that position, you'll be okay though because there are plenty of bars around. There's also the water/skyline, mere yards away and a nice record store a block away.The gf and I have gone a few other times and it's always been great--except for the one time that a camera crew was shooting a special on Paulie Gee's vegan options. My girlfriend and I were in the shot all throughout our meal, and we were fighting (as subtly as possible) for the duration of our meal. I was taken aback and somewhat miffed when the producers of the show asked to do a talking head with us outside. The tension was palpable but they still insisted on interviewing us. I really do believe that you should foot the bill if you're going to interview someone for your television series or web series or gratuitously long Yelp review or whatever.

"I almost feel like it's blasphemy for not giving 5 stars. Finally made my way over here at Paulie Gees after way too long. Clearly this place is GPs staple so was excited to drop by on Wednesday night.There was no wait- very good. I had been worried about this so called 3x around 6:45pm to see how long it was before heading over. No one picked up and their answering service basically hangs up on you. I ordered the Daniela and he ordered the brisket pizza. Mine came out a good 7 minutes before his. I noticed immediately that about 40% of the crust was charred to the point of being inedible. To top that off, the spinach topping my pizza was the same. It was literally a black piece of ash and when I picked a leaf up or crumbled in my hands. The cheese blend was very good (mozzarella and Parmesan) but the pizza was just not good. To top it off, parts of the center were soggy and didn't hold the toppings when I grabbed a slice. When the brisket pizza came out a few minutes later I noticed immediately that it was cooked perfectly. The crust was edible and delicious. I was bummed that mine didn't come out this way especially since it seemed like a classic. All I can say is they probably put our orders in together and maybe his needed a little longer in the oven. Mine was most likely getting over cooked while his needed a few more minutes. Hence the gap in time between both of our orders coming out and the reason why mine was half done by the time his came out.I was really disappointed but the good thing to know is at least the brisket pizza was cooked well. I know there is a good meal at Paulie Gees but I feel like we were jipped.Also, great touch that Paulie himself came in to greet all the diners. He was super friendly and it brings a family quality to the place. This is maybe one of the main reasons I'd come back.",3.0
"Delicious!! Definitely made my top 3 favorite pizza  places (the others being robertas and best pizza). We've been meaning to come forever but the line is always so long. We were finally seated right away on a Friday night because we ran over as soon as they opened at 6pm. I would highly recommend this tactic to those of you who have been meaning to come and haven't been able to due to the wait -- the food will be worth it. We ordered the hellboy, ricotta be kidding me and the hot honey ice cream Sunday for dessert. The hellboy was our fave. It was basically a pepperoni pizza with hot honey lined under the cheese. I liked it more than the bees sting from Robertas but both are very good. All in all would highly recommend. As an extra plus Paulie Gee was hanging around today,though it seems like he does this quite often, going from table to table talking to the customers.",5.0
"My husband and I visited Paulie Gee's about two years ago and he still dreams of the Hellboy. This time we ordered the Hellboy and Cherry Jones.  The Hellboy was great but just a touch too sweet for me.  The hot honey adds a little kick but is definitely not too hot.  My husband will tell you it is the best pizza he has ever had (saying a lot since he was raised in the Bronx).  The Cherry Jones on the other hand was way too sweet for both of us.  I couldn't taste anything other then honey.  My husband embarrassed me by telling the waitress we didn't like it.  She offered us a replacement.  We ordered the Ricky Ricotta.  It was alright.  I was shocked because the ricotta was not warm.  The crust at Paulie Gee's is the perfect texture.  However, two of our three pizzas were too charred for my taste.  I must mention Paulie walks around all the tables to make sure everyone is enjoying.  Love it!  The restaurant is too dark and loud for my taste.",3.0
"Interesting decor, super dark inside and it was hard to read the menu. We were seated under one of the speakers, so I felt like an old person complaining about how loud the music was, but really, we came for the food. Split a salad and a Greenpointer pie, and neither disappointed. Both were served quickly, and the pie just exploded with flavor. The lemon kick was strong but not overwhelming, and the crust was perfection. Service was attentive, friendly, and efficient. Lots of menu choices for anything your palate is craving. Overall, a very good experience, and one I would look forward to enjoying again.",4.0
"New York probably takes its pizza more seriously than anywhere else in the world.  I'm sure there are 7 or 8 people reading this right now that would be willing to shiv a guy for saying something bad about their favorite slice.  With that in mind, Paulie Gee's is a pizza lover's pizza place.  They make Neapolitan style pizzas with an oven shipped in from Naples and lovingly reassembled by small, Italian elves.  From this oven, comes perfectly leopard-spotted pizzas with just the right amount of bouncy chewy dough.To top the pizza, there's a lovingly curated selection to choose from so don't you dare ask for substitutions.  Lucky for you whether you're a vegan, vegetarian, white/red pie lover, averse to spice, meat lover, or whatever!  There's at least one pie on the menu* that will make you say, ""hmmm..."".  My personal favorites are the Mo' Cheeks ($16, has guanciale and is perfect with the pickled onions) and Ricotta Be Kidding Me ($17, with tons of meat topped with adorable dollops of cottage cheese).  I've only ever had 1 pizza there that wasn't stellar and I won't tell you which one because you'll definitely judge me for choosing it in the first place.The atmosphere at Paulie Gee's is great.  It's quintessential Brooklyn.  Think dark unfinished wood walls with an eclectic collection of tables made from reclaimed wood, music consisting of a mixture of jazz, rock, and anything but top 40s.  What always makes my night is that the ACTUAL Paulie Gee walks around and talks to EVERYONE.  It doesn't matter if Keri Russell** is sitting right next to you, he will still come by and have a 5-20 minute conversation with you and your table.  My only complaint is how popular this place is.  They've stopped making pizzas to go and still, the wait is crazy.  I've never been able to get a table in less than 45 minutes unless it was late at night.  I guess that's not a bad problem to have.  I also kind of wish they would get a full liquor license and take that creative pizza combo creating mind into the cocktail realm.  I mean...Mike's Hot Honey + Whiskey?  Maybe?---------* If you can't find a pizza you like on the printed menu in the restaurant, whip out the smartphone and check out the ""secret"" menu on the website.** This actually happened.",4.0
"We've literally flown across the country to enjoy his pizza. It's that good! Walking in, the aroma of pizza cooking in a brick oven hits your nose.This is about time my stomach starts to growl. The vibe is flowing with positive energy, and the low lighting is flattering & sexy. The bar to the left is where you can order a beverage while you wait.  They have a decent beer selection. Wait times vary, but it's usually not as long as anticipated, and well worth the effort.Everyone, including the servers, seem happy to be there.Paulie Gee is the utmost host. He's always found time to come to our table with suggestions, stories, and the occasional limoncello, (his recipe of the celebratory cocktail).Talking with him, I've gathered that he makes the vegan pizza for the people, or demand for it, but he didn't seem interested in the cause. The funky bathrooms can be a challenge to use when you've had one too many! VEGAN Pies we LOVE Simply RedVegan Tomato Sauce with Tomatoes, Olive Oil. Vidalia Onions, Garlic, Basil, Salt and PepperVegan Daniela SpinaciBaby Spinach, Olive Oil, Fresh Sliced Garlic, Mild Aleppo Chili Oil and Sea SaltIn Ricotta Da VeganVegan Tomato Sauce, House Made Vegan Sausage, Post-oven House Made Cashew Ricotta Dollops, Baby Arugula and Extra Virgin Olive OilWith many return visits, we've yet to have a negative experience.There has been noise over the years of Paulie Giannone opening a Portland outpost, but it has yet to materialize. Meanwhile, I'll dream of his pizza.",5.0
"Absolutely delicious. Huge selection of pies - good for meatatarians, vegetarians, and even vegans. Wood fire oven delivers the signature light smoke and char. Dough is absolutely tender and springy. They even let the pizza rest afterwards so the cheese sets and you don't burn the crap out of your mouth.Hellboy- spicy pepperoni with hot honey. Absolute classic pizza. Hot honey perfectly blankets the spicy meat. Super simple, absolutely delicious. Get two, trust meRicotta/sausage pie - similar to one above, hot honey included. However ricotta and sausage are a welcome addition. While chunks of roasted garlic are an excellent accentSo many other pies, go try them for yourself.Big lines, put your name down and go drink at browerij lane.

"One of the challenges of  being vegan is getting your friends/family to be open to the idea of trying vegan food.I have never had Vegan Pizza before and I usually try to try a restaurant first before recommending to anyone especially a non vegan but I took a chance.When we first arrived we were having trouble picking something since everything was foreign to us. Someone sitting next to us saw our struggle and took us to try the  IN Ricotta Da Vegan so we did. AMAZING!! My non vegan date was impressed and I was so happy.Thanks Paulie Gee for making me looking good Whew! One pie (6 small slices) goes for 16 bucks . Its small, nice ambiance I would say its a little darkI would go again!Menu like here ------ pauliegee.com/greenpoint… xoxoC.",4.0
"Some of the best za in the city, bar none. The lady and I traveled far and wide for it since we'd heard such great things. It was a Friday night so the restaurant was predictably packed. There's not much in the form of a waiting area, which particularly sucked given how freezing the weather was, but we had a feeling the pie would be well worth the wait (plus we also got to watch a tipsy couple aggressively suck face up close and personal which was an unexpected but enjoyable twist).The vibe was cool, featuring low--lighting, a huge and beautiful custom brick oven, and trendy attractive people who's favorite bands you've never heard of.When we finally were seated I was stoked to see the menu offered a huge variety of pies with all sorts of niche toppings AND vegan options(I personally don't give two damns about veganism but they presented them in an unpretentious way so I was cool with it). We eventually decided to go with the Hell Boy and the Prokypineapple, both of which were amazing, and I'm looking forward to going back and further chowing my way down the menu.Go here.",5.0
"After a 2-hours wait on a weekend for a party of 2, we finally got a table at the renowned pizza shop in Brooklyn. After having one of the best pizzas of all time at Little Isabella located in Baltimore, I was on the mission to find its companion in NYC. Overhyped as we suspected, Paulie Gee had nothing on Little Isabella! Perhaps, it was the quirky blend of sweet and savory flavors, but with that 2-hour wait, we surely did not have a pleasing experience.We ordered two pies: HellBoy and Greenpointer. HellBoy: Fresh Mozzarella, Italian Tomatoes, Berkshire Sopressata Piccante, Parmigiano Reggiano and Mike's HOT HoneyGreenpointer:Fresh Mozzarella, Baby Arugula, Olive Oil, Fresh Lemon Juice and Shaved Parmigiano ReggianoWe didn't really enjoy the sweetness of the honey in the HellBoy or the sourness of the lemon juice in the Greenpointer. Fresh, as we saw them make each pie to order, I definitely thought the doughiness of the pizza wasn't anything spectacular. In terms of service, I think it was pretty solid. Our waiter was patient and helpful. As a surprise, Paulie Gee himself introduced himself to just about every table, making it feel quite personable. In all, I definitely wouldn't return back to this pizzeria, especially with that crazy wait. During that 2-hour wait and 1.5-hour dining time, I can drive down to Baltimore and get some Little Isabella for half the price and no wait!",3.0
"3.5 stars for this pizza joint hidden behind a HUGE wooden door all the way down Franklin streetCrust was good with a nice char on the hellboy but the crust of the greenpoint pizza seemed a bit underdone We were quoted a 1.5 hour wait at 8pm for 3 on a Saturday but we were lucky that people in front of us hadn't returned so we were seated right away! (so don't be discouraged)---hellboy: everything was good about this except that spicy honey! Should of gone with a more classic margherita style pizza instead---greenpoint: fresh arugula, with a bit too much lemon juice, so nothing special NOTE: they don't have pepper flakes, only chili oil",4.0
"If you want great pizza and the right atmosphere look no further than Paulie Gee's. We sat at the bar (luckily) and avoided a two hour wait.  The pizza choices are numerous, with some very creative options. There were three of us and we started with two pies. Would have been content but it was so good we ordered a third.The texture. The crust. The toppings. Hard pressed to mention anything I didn't like. I love pizza and this place is right up there with the best. That includes many pizzerias throughout Italy.Paulie stopped by for a chat and he has a fantastic personality. Great stories and it is obvious that he loves what he does and holds him team to very high standards.He was also kind enough to give me an official Paulie Gee's pin and a limoncello. A very nice touch!Make sure you check out the pizza oven in the back. It's a small,cozy place so don't pass this place up in you are in NY.",5.0
I take my pizza very seriously. The vegan pizza is so good here that if they didn't tell you it was vegan you would have no clue. I had the pie with vegan sausage and shared a few others with friends. It was all out of this world. I can't wait to go back again.,5.0
"There's a LOT of really great pizza in NYC, that's nothing new. But combine amazing pizza with friendly, caring service and a killer ambiance, and Paulie Gee's has a leg up on a lot of the other heavy hitters. The wait can be crazy, but we came in on a Tuesday night and it was half empty. I guess the key is to come when there's post-blizzard sludge everywhere and no one else wants to go out. Paulie Gee was there as I'm told he usually is, weaving around the space with his cup of coffee and stopping at literally every table. For us, he offered to curate our pizza order and who were we to argue? Read on for what Paulie Gee himself recommends:- The Greenpointer: according to Paulie, basically like eating a salad due to the piles of fresh baby arugula on top. - The Mo Cheeks: My personal favorite of the meal. The pickled onions on there are a nice surprise, and give a nice kick to the rest of the ingredients. - The Monte Cristo: OK, so this is probably something I would never think to order myself, but I'm glad it came out for us because it's actually super tasty. It comes with Canadian bacon and a drizzle of maple syrup, which I know sounds weird but trust me (or rather, trust Paulie). - I didn't catch the name of the last pizza, but it was one of the best and after peeking at the menu again I think it might have been the Hellboy. It was piled high with the tastiest Berkshire Sopressata, and it was perfect with the side of Mike's hot honey (which you haven't tried on pizza you must immediately). They asked if we wanted a dessert pizza but at that point we were stuffed to the gills. It was one of the best New York pizza experiences I've had so far, and the service is what really puts them above and beyond. I'm going to run for vice-president of the Paulie Gee fanclub soon!",5.0
"Came here a few days ago with my friend after work. Very dark inside, took some time for my eyeballs to adjust lol. We started off with some beers and then went with the Hellboy which was AMAZING. The hot honey makes a difference! Then we went with a vegan pie since neither one of us was particularly full. We ordered one with spinach, sea salt and garlic on it (sorry don't remember the name!) It was OK, not that memorable. The standout is by far Hellboy, the crust for both pizzas was SUPER THIN, firm and didn't fall apart on me. We both liked it. I took off a star for the spinach pie being nothing special and that it's a bit on the pricey side. Overall, I think I'll be back to try the other pizzas on the menu!",4.0
"Maybe we came on an off night, but we didn't care too much about the pizza and it was definitely not the best we've had. My friend wanted to celebrate her belated birthday at Paulie Gee's and so we did. We ordered 3 pies (Greenpointer, Ricotta Be Kidding Me, and The Hometown Brisket). I think the Hometown Brisket was our favorite only because of the BBQ sauce. Other than that, there wasn't much brisket pieces on the pizza. Ricotta Be Kidding Me was okay. The Greenpointer was all greens so that balanced our meal a little bit. I hear people waiting for hours to get a seat here and right now I'm just wondering where all the hype went? We came when they were opening, so thank goodness we didn't wait on line for this...cause it wouldn't have been worth it. FYI: There's no sign outside that says ""Paulie Gee's"". You just have to look by the address number ""60"" in order to find this place. I actually walked passed it while we were trying to find it. Also, use your flash on your phones to read the menu. I really liked the rustic interior but it was literally pitch black in there.",3.0
"Zagat rated the hellboy as the best pizza in NYC. Wow! Big call Zagat... We had to try! We would say it was delicious... But I would have to say Marta is equal of not just ahead. We got here at 6:40 and had to wait over an hr to sit at the bar. When getting here service was prompt and food was great! We ordered the hellboy and the hellified porkpie white and I have to say it was fresh, full of flavor and great value. My only critique would be more hot suppressa on the hellified and take numbers at the door! It's a little unreasonable to ask people to wait 90 mins and not offer to call when table it ready. Either way it was great but probably won't be crossing the river to wait another 90 mins.",4.0

I would highly recommend this tactic to those of you who have been meaning to come and haven't been able to due to the wait -- the food will be worth it. We ordered the hellboy, ricotta be kidding me and the hot honey ice cream Sunday for dessert. The hellboy was our fave. It was basically a pepperoni pizza with hot honey lined under the cheese.

"My husband and I visited Paulie Gee's about two years ago and he still dreams of the Hellboy. This time we ordered the Hellboy and Cherry Jones.  The Hellboy was great but just a touch too sweet for me.  The hot honey adds a little kick but is definitely not too hot.  My husband will tell you it is the best pizza he has ever had (saying a lot since he was raised in the Bronx).  The Cherry Jones on the other hand was way too sweet for both of us.  I couldn't taste anything other then honey.  My husband embarrassed me by telling the waitress we didn't like it.  She offered us a replacement.  We ordered the Ricky Ricotta.  It was alright.  I was shocked because the ricotta was not warm.  The crust at Paulie Gee's is the perfect texture.  However, two of our three pizzas were too charred for my taste.  I must mention Paulie walks around all the tables to make sure everyone is enjoying.  Love it!  The restaurant is too dark and loud for my taste.",3.0

"Some of the best za in the city, bar none. The lady and I traveled far and wide for it since we'd heard such great things. It was a Friday night so the restaurant was predictably packed. There's not much in the form of a waiting area, which particularly sucked given how freezing the weather was, but we had a feeling the pie would be well worth the wait (plus we also got to watch a tipsy couple aggressively suck face up close and personal which was an unexpected but enjoyable twist).The vibe was cool, featuring low--lighting, a huge and beautiful custom brick oven, and trendy attractive people who's favorite bands you've never heard of.When we finally were seated I was stoked to see the menu offered a huge variety of pies with all sorts of niche toppings AND vegan options(I personally don't give two damns about veganism but they presented them in an unpretentious way so I was cool with it). We eventually decided to go with the Hell Boy and the Prokypineapple, both of which were amazing, and I'm looking forward to going back and further chowing my way down the menu.Go here.",5.0
"After a 2-hours wait on a weekend for a party of 2, we finally got a table at the renowned pizza shop in Brooklyn. After having one of the best pizzas of all time at Little Isabella located in Baltimore, I was on the mission to find its companion in NYC. Overhyped as we suspected, Paulie Gee had nothing on Little Isabella! Perhaps, it was the quirky blend of sweet and savory flavors, but with that 2-hour wait, we surely did not have a pleasing experience.We ordered two pies: HellBoy and Greenpointer. HellBoy: Fresh Mozzarella, Italian Tomatoes, Berkshire Sopressata Piccante, Parmigiano Reggiano and Mike's HOT HoneyGreenpointer:Fresh Mozzarella, Baby Arugula, Olive Oil, Fresh Lemon Juice and Shaved Parmigiano ReggianoWe didn't really enjoy the sweetness of the honey in the HellBoy or the sourness of the lemon juice in the Greenpointer. Fresh, as we saw them make each pie to order, I definitely thought the doughiness of the pizza wasn't anything spectacular. In terms of service, I think it was pretty solid. Our waiter was patient and helpful. As a surprise, Paulie Gee himself introduced himself to just about every table, making it feel quite personable. In all, I definitely wouldn't return back to this pizzeria, especially with that crazy wait. During that 2-hour wait and 1.5-hour dining time, I can drive down to Baltimore and get some Little Isabella for half the price and no wait!",3.0
"3.5 stars for this pizza joint hidden behind a HUGE wooden door all the way down Franklin streetCrust was good with a nice char on the hellboy but the crust of the greenpoint pizza seemed a bit underdone We were quoted a 1.5 hour wait at 8pm for 3 on a Saturday but we were lucky that people in front of us hadn't returned so we were seated right away! (so don't be discouraged)---hellboy: everything was good about this except that spicy honey! Should of gone with a more classic margherita style pizza instead---greenpoint: fresh arugula, with a bit too much lemon juice, so nothing special NOTE: they don't have pepper flakes, only chili oil",4.0
"If you want great pizza and the right atmosphere look no further than Paulie Gee's. We sat at the bar (luckily) and avoided a two hour wait.  The pizza choices are numerous, with some very creative options. There were three of us and we started with two pies. Would have been content but it was so good we ordered a third.The texture. The crust. The toppings. Hard pressed to mention anything I didn't like. I love pizza and this place is right up there with the best. That includes many pizzerias throughout Italy.Paulie stopped by for a chat and he has a fantastic personality. Great stories and it is obvious that he loves what he does and holds him team to very high standards.He was also kind enough to give me an official Paulie Gee's pin and a limoncello. A very nice touch!Make sure you check out the pizza oven in the back. It's a small,cozy place so don't pass this place up in you are in NY.",5.0
I take my pizza very seriously. The vegan pizza is so good here that if they didn't tell you it was vegan you would have no clue. I had the pie with vegan sausage and shared a few others with friends. It was all out of this world. I can't wait to go back again.,5.0
"There's a LOT of really great pizza in NYC, that's nothing new. But combine amazing pizza with friendly, caring service and a killer ambiance, and Paulie Gee's has a leg up on a lot of the other heavy hitters. The wait can be crazy, but we came in on a Tuesday night and it was half empty. I guess the key is to come when there's post-blizzard sludge everywhere and no one else wants to go out. Paulie Gee was there as I'm told he usually is, weaving around the space with his cup of coffee and stopping at literally every table. For us, he offered to curate our pizza order and who were we to argue? Read on for what Paulie Gee himself recommends:- The Greenpointer: according to Paulie, basically like eating a salad due to the piles of fresh baby arugula on top. - The Mo Cheeks: My personal favorite of the meal. The pickled onions on there are a nice surprise, and give a nice kick to the rest of the ingredients. - The Monte Cristo: OK, so this is probably something I would never think to order myself, but I'm glad it came out for us because it's actually super tasty. It comes with Canadian bacon and a drizzle of maple syrup, which I know sounds weird but trust me (or rather, trust Paulie). - I didn't catch the name of the last pizza, but it was one of the best and after peeking at the menu again I think it might have been the Hellboy. It was piled high with the tastiest Berkshire Sopressata, and it was perfect with the side of Mike's hot honey (which you haven't tried on pizza you must immediately). They asked if we wanted a dessert pizza but at that point we were stuffed to the gills. It was one of the best New York pizza experiences I've had so far, and the service is what really puts them above and beyond. I'm going to run for vice-president of the Paulie Gee fanclub soon!",5.0
"Came here a few days ago with my friend after work. Very dark inside, took some time for my eyeballs to adjust lol. We started off with some beers and then went with the Hellboy which was AMAZING. The hot honey makes a difference! Then we went with a vegan pie since neither one of us was particularly full. We ordered one with spinach, sea salt and garlic on it (sorry don't remember the name!) It was OK, not that memorable. The standout is by far Hellboy, the crust for both pizzas was SUPER THIN, firm and didn't fall apart on me. We both liked it. I took off a star for the spinach pie being nothing special and that it's a bit on the pricey side. Overall, I think I'll be back to try the other pizzas on the menu!",4.0
"Maybe we came on an off night, but we didn't care too much about the pizza and it was definitely not the best we've had. My friend wanted to celebrate her belated birthday at Paulie Gee's and so we did. We ordered 3 pies (Greenpointer, Ricotta Be Kidding Me, and The Hometown Brisket). I think the Hometown Brisket was our favorite only because of the BBQ sauce. Other than that, there wasn't much brisket pieces on the pizza. Ricotta Be Kidding Me was okay. The Greenpointer was all greens so that balanced our meal a little bit. I hear people waiting for hours to get a seat here and right now I'm just wondering where all the hype went? We came when they were opening, so thank goodness we didn't wait on line for this...cause it wouldn't have been worth it. FYI: There's no sign outside that says ""Paulie Gee's"". You just have to look by the address number ""60"" in order to find this place. I actually walked passed it while we were trying to find it. Also, use your flash on your phones to read the menu. I really liked the rustic interior but it was literally pitch black in there.",3.0
"Zagat rated the hellboy as the best pizza in NYC. Wow! Big call Zagat... We had to try! We would say it was delicious... But I would have to say Marta is equal of not just ahead. We got here at 6:40 and had to wait over an hr to sit at the bar. When getting here service was prompt and food was great! We ordered the hellboy and the hellified porkpie white and I have to say it was fresh, full of flavor and great value. My only critique would be more hot suppressa on the hellified and take numbers at the door! It's a little unreasonable to ask people to wait 90 mins and not offer to call when table it ready. Either way it was great but probably won't be crossing the river to wait another 90 mins.",4.0
"If there was ever a restaurant that inspires the need for #PiDay (3.14) to be everyday, it is Paulie Gee's. The pizza is a true art, and every bite is important, from the center to the crust crust.  PG is located in pizza heaven, or right near the water on Greenpoint Ave if you want a Google Map friendly address.Read it on my blog: highclasstohighlifes.com…As you'll see below I'm constantly on the proscuitt of happiness but this time we went for a different ham, Canadian bacon, and on the Monte Cristo. You bet it counted towards happiness. This pizza combines maple syrup drizzle and gouda with the ham. Yes, yes and more yes. Paulie asked if we had butter on the crust...sadly, no. SO MUCH REGRET....that I'll be back in no time to try it. You'll notice on the menu that they have a brisket pizza that features Hometown BBQ -- I love this local BK collaboration. You can get sauced the other way too with Greenpoint local brews!Anyway, I have nearly eaten my way through the entire menu (still need to do a bit of adventuring on the vegan side, every time I get close, I just want meat...) and I have been very pleased with every slice thus far. Therefore my advice to you is go with the pizza that's toppings are most appealing...or grab a handful of friends and share, then you can try multiple pizzas!The man, who is not a myth, but definitely a legend is often found inside checking in on tables, ensuring quality control and getting to know the patrons. He loved my last Instagram post that did a little play words...sharing that I was on the prosciutt of happiness with his King Henry Classic. He's always all smiles and usually wearing a great hat, he is Paulie Gee himself. Paulie Gee's - High Class to High Lifes If you really knead to get delivery or pickup, you'll have to look elsewhere for now though. The only way to leave Paulie Gee's with a to-go box is with leftovers. Rumor has it that a slice joint is opening up nearby though! I'm counting down the days, hours and minutes. Want to keep drooling? Read the menu!Pro Tip: Grab dinner at Paulie Gee's then walk straight out on the water in Greenpoint to Transmitter park or the outlook. Maybe even catch a sunset and BYO night cap!",5.0
"My old pal Carlos and I visited Paulie Gee's last night and had a great meal. I'm accustomed to going with the ol' vegan girlfriend and have a tradition where we split two pies from their extensive vegan selection, so we can try two different types of pies. The vegan and non-vegan selections are both extensive; each category has at least a half dozen kinds of pies, including oil bases, white slices, marinara, spinach-based, spicy honey and barbecue sauce foundations. The pies are aesthetically pleasing to every sense, well, every sense except sound. It's usually better when sound isn't a factor. At least when you're talking about food. When you're talking about music, sound is obviously a very important sense to talk about. I may go as far as to say that in a conversation about music, sound is the only sense that matters.I was excited to go with Carlos because I was going to get to eat their meat and actual cheese. The Paulie Gee's brisket is lean and delicious. Their pickled red onions possess a truly memorable tang and are worth spending a couple buck to add on to pretty much any pie. The ricotta dollops on the Ricky Ricotta feel more like bursts of a cream sauce than regular old cheese. Interestingly, the dairy and non-dairy ricotta cheeses are almost indecipherable in quality, which goes to show that Paulie Gee's knows what's up. Carlos and I were pleased to compliment the trad Italian flavors of the Ricky Ricotta with a tangy Barbecue Brisket pie. I'm psyched to go with a fellow omnivore again, because there are tons of other flavor combos I'm eager to try. New Yorkers, such as myself, are notorious for being dicks about the quality of pizza dough. It's the dough that invalidates the Chicago Deep Dish's false aspiration to pizza status. I can't stand Sicilian pizza either, which is a controversial take in Nueva York. Anyhow, no matter how well adorned a Paulie Gee's pie is, its base--the crust--is its most distinct and wonderful element. The crust is thin but springy, and always a little charred. It's pretty much naan bread, which is either a very luck coincidence or a visionary innovation. Naan bread, as you know, is lit, and, as it turns out, it is the perfect surface upon which various pizza ingredients should be placed and/or spread to mingle harmoniously.I've visited Paulie Gee's a number of times, and there's a bit of narrative that forms around my visits. The first time I tried to go, it was around noon, and my gf and I made the unpleasant discovery that Paulie Gee's does not open til 5 PM. The next time, we rolled up in a deep crew of six and had to wait about two to three hours for a table for six. If you find yourself in that position, you'll be okay though because there are plenty of bars around. There's also the water/skyline, mere yards away and a nice record store a block away.The gf and I have gone a few other times and it's always been great--except for the one time that a camera crew was shooting a special on Paulie Gee's vegan options. My girlfriend and I were in the shot all throughout our meal, and we were fighting (as subtly as possible) for the duration of our meal. I was taken aback and somewhat miffed when the producers of the show asked to do a talking head with us outside. The tension was palpable but they still insisted on interviewing us. I really do believe that you should foot the bill if you're going to interview someone for your television series or web series or gratuitously long Yelp review or whatever. At LEAST commission me to write a song for the soundtrack.In closing, I would like to offer a lil sum sum for the ladies. Are you interested in grandfatherly, charmingly blue collar, short men whose personalities closely resemble those of most Robert De Niro characters--but only in David O. Russel movies? If you do, and might want to be possibly hit on by a man of this caliber, you will love Paulie Gee's. At all times, Paulie Gee's eponymous Pizza Architect and Entrepreneur, Paulie Gee, stalks the narrow spaces between tables, checking in with customers--particularly of the reasonably attractive female demographic--and asks them how their food is, making small talk and thanking them for their patronage. I think this is cool. I would do the same if I were in his position, so don't take this the wrong way. Central to Paulie Gee's game is his ability to recommend a pizza place in seemingly every zip code on the planet and his inclination to tell you (the lady in question) the name of the dude who works there/owns the place, and to tell you (still the lady in question) to tell the dude (who owns the pizza place) to say that he (Paulie Gee) says hi. The Brotherhood of Pizza Mans is truly alive and well.",5.0

"I almost feel like it's blasphemy for not giving 5 stars. Finally made my way over here at Paulie Gees after way too long. Clearly this place is GPs staple so was excited to drop by on Wednesday night.There was no wait- very good. I had been worried about this so called 3x around 6:45pm to see how long it was before heading over. No one picked up and their answering service basically hangs up on you. I ordered the Daniela and he ordered the brisket pizza. Mine came out a good 7 minutes before his. I noticed immediately that about 40% of the crust was charred to the point of being inedible. To top that off, the spinach topping my pizza was the same. It was literally a black piece of ash and when I picked a leaf up or crumbled in my hands. The cheese blend was very good (mozzarella and Parmesan) but the pizza was just not good. To top it off, parts of the center were soggy and didn't hold the toppings when I grabbed a slice. When the brisket pizza came out a few minutes later I noticed immediately that it was cooked perfectly. The crust was edible and delicious. I was bummed that mine didn't come out this way especially since it seemed like a classic. All I can say is they probably put our orders in together and maybe his needed a little longer in the oven. Mine was most likely getting over cooked while his needed a few more minutes. Hence the gap in time between both of our orders coming out and the reason why mine was half done by the time his came out.I was really disappointed but the good thing to know is at least the brisket pizza was cooked well. I know there is a good meal at Paulie Gees but I feel like we were jipped.Also, great touch that Paulie himself came in to greet all the diners. He was super friendly and it brings a family quality to the place. This is maybe one of the main reasons I'd come back.",3.0

There's not much in the form of a waiting area, which particularly sucked given how freezing the weather was, but we had a feeling the pie would be well worth the wait (plus we also got to watch a tipsy couple aggressively suck face up close and personal which was an unexpected but enjoyable twist).The vibe was cool, featuring low--lighting, a huge and beautiful custom brick oven, and trendy attractive people who's favorite bands you've never heard of.When we finally were seated I was stoked to see the menu offered a huge variety of pies with all sorts of niche toppings AND vegan options(I personally don't give two damns about veganism but they presented them in an unpretentious way so I was cool with it). We eventually decided to go with the Hell Boy and the Prokypineapple, both of which were amazing, and I'm looking forward to going back and further chowing my way down the menu.Go here.",5.0
"After a 2-hours wait on a weekend for a party of 2, we finally got a table at the renowned pizza shop in Brooklyn. After having one of the best pizzas of all time at Little Isabella located in Baltimore, I was on the mission to find its companion in NYC. Overhyped as we suspected, Paulie Gee had nothing on Little Isabella! Perhaps, it was the quirky blend of sweet and savory flavors, but with that 2-hour wait, we surely did not have a pleasing experience.We ordered two pies: HellBoy and Greenpointer. HellBoy: Fresh Mozzarella, Italian Tomatoes, Berkshire Sopressata Piccante, Parmigiano Reggiano and Mike's HOT HoneyGreenpointer:Fresh Mozzarella, Baby Arugula, Olive Oil, Fresh Lemon Juice and Shaved Parmigiano ReggianoWe didn't really enjoy the sweetness of the honey in the HellBoy or the sourness of the lemon juice in the Greenpointer. Fresh, as we saw them make each pie to order, I definitely thought the doughiness of the pizza wasn't anything spectacular. In terms of service, I think it was pretty solid. Our waiter was patient and helpful. As a surprise, Paulie Gee himself introduced himself to just about every table, making it feel quite personable. In all, I definitely wouldn't return back to this pizzeria, especially with that crazy wait. During that 2-hour wait and 1.5-hour dining time, I can drive down to Baltimore and get some Little Isabella for half the price and no wait!",3.0
"3.5 stars for this pizza joint hidden behind a HUGE wooden door all the way down Franklin streetCrust was good with a nice char on the hellboy but the crust of the greenpoint pizza seemed a bit underdone We were quoted a 1.5 hour wait at 8pm for 3 on a Saturday but we were lucky that people in front of us hadn't returned so we were seated right away! (so don't be discouraged)---hellboy: everything was good about this except that spicy honey!

"If you want great pizza and the right atmosphere look no further than Paulie Gee's.

Would have been content but it was so good we ordered a third.The texture. The crust. The toppings. Hard pressed to mention anything I didn't like. I love pizza and this place is right up there with the best. That includes many pizzerias throughout Italy.Paulie stopped by for a chat and he has a fantastic personality. Great stories and it is obvious that he loves what he does and holds him team to very high standards.He was also kind enough to give me an official Paulie Gee's pin and a limoncello. A very nice touch!Make sure you check out the pizza oven in the back. It's a small,cozy place so don't pass this place up in you are in NY.",5.0
I take my pizza very seriously. The vegan pizza is so good here that if they didn't tell you it was vegan you would have no clue. I had the pie with vegan sausage and shared a few others with friends. It was all out of this world. I can't wait to go back again.,5.0
"There's a LOT of really great pizza in NYC, that's nothing new. But combine amazing pizza with friendly, caring service and a killer ambiance, and Paulie Gee's has a leg up on a lot of the other heavy hitters. The wait can be crazy, but we came in on a Tuesday night and it was half empty. I guess the key is to come when there's post-blizzard sludge everywhere and no one else wants to go out. Paulie Gee was there as I'm told he usually is, weaving around the space with his cup of coffee and stopping at literally every table. For us, he offered to curate our pizza order and who were we to argue? Read on for what Paulie Gee himself recommends:- The Greenpointer: according to Paulie, basically like eating a salad due to the piles of fresh baby arugula on top. - The Mo Cheeks: My personal favorite of the meal. The pickled onions on there are a nice surprise, and give a nice kick to the rest of the ingredients. - The Monte Cristo: OK, so this is probably something I would never think to order myself, but I'm glad it came out for us because it's actually super tasty. It comes with Canadian bacon and a drizzle of maple syrup, which I know sounds weird but trust me (or rather, trust Paulie). - I didn't catch the name of the last pizza, but it was one of the best and after peeking at the menu again I think it might have been the Hellboy. It was piled high with the tastiest Berkshire Sopressata, and it was perfect with the side of Mike's hot honey (which you haven't tried on pizza you must immediately). They asked if we wanted a dessert pizza but at that point we were stuffed to the gills. It was one of the best New York pizza experiences I've had so far, and the service is what really puts them above and beyond. I'm going to run for vice-president of the Paulie Gee fanclub soon!",5.0
"Came here a few days ago with my friend after work. Very dark inside, took some time for my eyeballs to adjust lol. We started off with some beers and then went with the Hellboy which was AMAZING. The hot honey makes a difference! Then we went with a vegan pie since neither one of us was particularly full. We ordered one with spinach, sea salt and garlic on it (sorry don't remember the name!) It was OK, not that memorable. The standout is by far Hellboy, the crust for both pizzas was SUPER THIN, firm and didn't fall apart on me. We both liked it. I took off a star for the spinach pie being nothing special and that it's a bit on the pricey side. Overall, I think I'll be back to try the other pizzas on the menu!",4.0
"Maybe we came on an off night, but we didn't care too much about the pizza and it was definitely not the best we've had. My friend wanted to celebrate her belated birthday at Paulie Gee's and so we did. We ordered 3 pies (Greenpointer, Ricotta Be Kidding Me, and The Hometown Brisket). I think the Hometown Brisket was our favorite only because of the BBQ sauce. Other than that, there wasn't much brisket pieces on the pizza. Ricotta Be Kidding Me was okay. The Greenpointer was all greens so that balanced our meal a little bit. I hear people waiting for hours to get a seat here and right now I'm just wondering where all the hype went? We came when they were opening, so thank goodness we didn't wait on line for this...cause it wouldn't have been worth it. FYI: There's no sign outside that says ""Paulie Gee's"". You just have to look by the address number ""60"" in order to find this place. I actually walked passed it while we were trying to find it. Also, use your flash on your phones to read the menu. I really liked the rustic interior but it was literally pitch black in there.",3.0
"Zagat rated the hellboy as the best pizza in NYC. Wow! Big call Zagat... We had to try! We would say it was delicious... But I would have to say Marta is equal of not just ahead. We got here at 6:40 and had to wait over an hr to sit at the bar. When getting here service was prompt and food was great! We ordered the hellboy and the hellified porkpie white and I have to say it was fresh, full of flavor and great value. My only critique would be more hot suppressa on the hellified and take numbers at the door! It's a little unreasonable to ask people to wait 90 mins and not offer to call when table it ready. Either way it was great but probably won't be crossing the river to wait another 90 mins.",4.0
"If there was ever a restaurant that inspires the need for #PiDay (3.14) to be everyday, it is Paulie Gee's. The pizza is a true art, and every bite is important, from the center to the crust crust.  PG is located in pizza heaven, or right near the water on Greenpoint Ave if you want a Google Map friendly address.Read it on my blog: highclasstohighlifes.com…As you'll see below I'm constantly on the proscuitt of happiness but this time we went for a different ham, Canadian bacon, and on the Monte Cristo. You bet it counted towards happiness. This pizza combines maple syrup drizzle and gouda with the ham. Yes, yes and more yes. Paulie asked if we had butter on the crust...sadly, no. SO MUCH REGRET....that I'll be back in no time to try it. You'll notice on the menu that they have a brisket pizza that features Hometown BBQ -- I love this local BK collaboration. You can get sauced the other way too with Greenpoint local brews!Anyway, I have nearly eaten my way through the entire menu (still need to do a bit of adventuring on the vegan side, every time I get close, I just want meat...) and I have been very pleased with every slice thus far. Therefore my advice to you is go with the pizza that's toppings are most appealing...or grab a handful of friends and share, then you can try multiple pizzas!The man, who is not a myth, but definitely a legend is often found inside checking in on tables, ensuring quality control and getting to know the patrons. He loved my last Instagram post that did a little play words...sharing that I was on the prosciutt of happiness with his King Henry Classic. He's always all smiles and usually wearing a great hat, he is Paulie Gee himself. Paulie Gee's - High Class to High Lifes If you really knead to get delivery or pickup, you'll have to look elsewhere for now though. The only way to leave Paulie Gee's with a to-go box is with leftovers. Rumor has it that a slice joint is opening up nearby though! I'm counting down the days, hours and minutes. Want to keep drooling? Read the menu!Pro Tip: Grab dinner at Paulie Gee's then walk straight out on the water in Greenpoint to Transmitter park or the outlook. Maybe even catch a sunset and BYO night cap!",5.0
"My old pal Carlos and I visited Paulie Gee's last night and had a great meal. I'm accustomed to going with the ol' vegan girlfriend and have a tradition where we split two pies from their extensive vegan selection, so we can try two different types of pies. The vegan and non-vegan selections are both extensive; each category has at least a half dozen kinds of pies, including oil bases, white slices, marinara, spinach-based, spicy honey and barbecue sauce foundations. The pies are aesthetically pleasing to every sense, well, every sense except sound. It's usually better when sound isn't a factor. At least when you're talking about food. When you're talking about music, sound is obviously a very important sense to talk about. I may go as far as to say that in a conversation about music, sound is the only sense that matters.I was excited to go with Carlos because I was going to get to eat their meat and actual cheese. The Paulie Gee's brisket is lean and delicious. Their pickled red onions possess a truly memorable tang and are worth spending a couple buck to add on to pretty much any pie. The ricotta dollops on the Ricky Ricotta feel more like bursts of a cream sauce than regular old cheese. Interestingly, the dairy and non-dairy ricotta cheeses are almost indecipherable in quality, which goes to show that Paulie Gee's knows what's up. Carlos and I were pleased to compliment the trad Italian flavors of the Ricky Ricotta with a tangy Barbecue Brisket pie. I'm psyched to go with a fellow omnivore again, because there are tons of other flavor combos I'm eager to try. New Yorkers, such as myself, are notorious for being dicks about the quality of pizza dough. It's the dough that invalidates the Chicago Deep Dish's false aspiration to pizza status. I can't stand Sicilian pizza either, which is a controversial take in Nueva York. Anyhow, no matter how well adorned a Paulie Gee's pie is, its base--the crust--is its most distinct and wonderful element. The crust is thin but springy, and always a little charred. It's pretty much naan bread, which is either a very luck coincidence or a visionary innovation. Naan bread, as you know, is lit, and, as it turns out, it is the perfect surface upon which various pizza ingredients should be placed and/or spread to mingle harmoniously.I've visited Paulie Gee's a number of times, and there's a bit of narrative that forms around my visits. The first time I tried to go, it was around noon, and my gf and I made the unpleasant discovery that Paulie Gee's does not open til 5 PM. The next time, we rolled up in a deep crew of six and had to wait about two to three hours for a table for six. If you find yourself in that position, you'll be okay though because there are plenty of bars around. There's also the water/skyline, mere yards away and a nice record store a block away.The gf and I have gone a few other times and it's always been great--except for the one time that a camera crew was shooting a special on Paulie Gee's vegan options. My girlfriend and I were in the shot all throughout our meal, and we were fighting (as subtly as possible) for the duration of our meal. I was taken aback and somewhat miffed when the producers of the show asked to do a talking head with us outside. The tension was palpable but they still insisted on interviewing us. I really do believe that you should foot the bill if you're going to interview someone for your television series or web series or gratuitously long Yelp review or whatever. At LEAST commission me to write a song for the soundtrack.In closing, I would like to offer a lil sum sum for the ladies. Are you interested in grandfatherly, charmingly blue collar, short men whose personalities closely resemble those of most Robert De Niro characters--but only in David O. Russel movies? If you do, and might want to be possibly hit on by a man of this caliber, you will love Paulie Gee's. At all times, Paulie Gee's eponymous Pizza Architect and Entrepreneur, Paulie Gee, stalks the narrow spaces between tables, checking in with customers--particularly of the reasonably attractive female demographic--and asks them how their food is, making small talk and thanking them for their patronage. I think this is cool. I would do the same if I were in his position, so don't take this the wrong way. Central to Paulie Gee's game is his ability to recommend a pizza place in seemingly every zip code on the planet and his inclination to tell you (the lady in question) the name of the dude who works there/owns the place, and to tell you (still the lady in question) to tell the dude (who owns the pizza place) to say that he (Paulie Gee) says hi. The Brotherhood of Pizza Mans is truly alive and well.",5.0

"I almost feel like it's blasphemy for not giving 5 stars. Finally made my way over here at Paulie Gees after way too long. Clearly this place is GPs staple so was excited to drop by on Wednesday night.There was no wait- very good. I had been worried about this so called 3x around 6:45pm to see how long it was before heading over. No one picked up and their answering service basically hangs up on you. I ordered the Daniela and he ordered the brisket pizza. Mine came out a good 7 minutes before his. I noticed immediately that about 40% of the crust was charred to the point of being inedible. To top that off, the spinach topping my pizza was the same. It was literally a black piece of ash and when I picked a leaf up or crumbled in my hands. The cheese blend was very good (mozzarella and Parmesan) but the pizza was just not good. To top it off, parts of the center were soggy and didn't hold the toppings when I grabbed a slice. When the brisket pizza came out a few minutes later I noticed immediately that it was cooked perfectly. The crust was edible and delicious. I was bummed that mine didn't come out this way especially since it seemed like a classic. All I can say is they probably put our orders in together and maybe his needed a little longer in the oven. Mine was most likely getting over cooked while his needed a few more minutes. Hence the gap in time between both of our orders coming out and the reason why mine was half done by the time his came out.I was really disappointed but the good thing to know is at least the brisket pizza was cooked well. I know there is a good meal at Paulie Gees but I feel like we were jipped.Also, great touch that Paulie himself came in to greet all the diners. He was super friendly and it brings a family quality to the place. This is maybe one of the main reasons I'd come back.",3.0
"Delicious!! Definitely made my top 3 favorite pizza  places (the others being robertas and best pizza). We've been meaning to come forever but the line is always so long. We were finally seated right away on a Friday night because we ran over as soon as they opened at 6pm. I would highly recommend this tactic to those of you who have been meaning to come and haven't been able to due to the wait -- the food will be worth it. We ordered the hellboy, ricotta be kidding me and the hot honey ice cream Sunday for dessert. The hellboy was our fave. It was basically a pepperoni pizza with hot honey lined under the cheese. I liked it more than the bees sting from Robertas but both are very good. All in all would highly recommend. As an extra plus Paulie Gee was hanging around today,though it seems like he does this quite often, going from table to table talking to the customers.",5.0
"My husband and I visited Paulie Gee's about two years ago and he still dreams of the Hellboy. This time we ordered the Hellboy and Cherry Jones.  The Hellboy was great but just a touch too sweet for me.  The hot honey adds a little kick but is definitely not too hot.  My husband will tell you it is the best pizza he has ever had (saying a lot since he was raised in the Bronx).  The Cherry Jones on the other hand was way too sweet for both of us.  I couldn't taste anything other then honey.  My husband embarrassed me by telling the waitress we didn't like it.  She offered us a replacement.  We ordered the Ricky Ricotta.  It was alright.  I was shocked because the ricotta was not warm.  The crust at Paulie Gee's is the perfect texture.  However, two of our three pizzas were too charred for my taste.  I must mention Paulie walks around all the tables to make sure everyone is enjoying.  Love it!  The restaurant is too dark and loud for my taste.",3.0
"Interesting decor, super dark inside and it was hard to read the menu. We were seated under one of the speakers, so I felt like an old person complaining about how loud the music was, but really, we came for the food. Split a salad and a Greenpointer pie, and neither disappointed. Both were served quickly, and the pie just exploded with flavor. The lemon kick was strong but not overwhelming, and the crust was perfection. Service was attentive, friendly, and efficient. Lots of menu choices for anything your palate is craving. Overall, a very good experience, and one I would look forward to enjoying again.",4.0
"New York probably takes its pizza more seriously than anywhere else in the world.  I'm sure there are 7 or 8 people reading this right now that would be willing to shiv a guy for saying something bad about their favorite slice.  With that in mind, Paulie Gee's is a pizza lover's pizza place.  They make Neapolitan style pizzas with an oven shipped in from Naples and lovingly reassembled by small, Italian elves.  From this oven, comes perfectly leopard-spotted pizzas with just the right amount of bouncy chewy dough.To top the pizza, there's a lovingly curated selection to choose from so don't you dare ask for substitutions.  Lucky for you whether you're a vegan, vegetarian, white/red pie lover, averse to spice, meat lover, or whatever!  There's at least one pie on the menu* that will make you say, ""hmmm..."".  My personal favorites are the Mo' Cheeks ($16, has guanciale and is perfect with the pickled onions) and Ricotta Be Kidding Me ($17, with tons of meat topped with adorable dollops of cottage cheese).  I've only ever had 1 pizza there that wasn't stellar and I won't tell you which one because you'll definitely judge me for choosing it in the first place.The atmosphere at Paulie Gee's is great.  It's quintessential Brooklyn.  Think dark unfinished wood walls with an eclectic collection of tables made from reclaimed wood, music consisting of a mixture of jazz, rock, and anything but top 40s.  What always makes my night is that the ACTUAL Paulie Gee walks around and talks to EVERYONE.  It doesn't matter if Keri Russell** is sitting right next to you, he will still come by and have a 5-20 minute conversation with you and your table.  My only complaint is how popular this place is.  They've stopped making pizzas to go and still, the wait is crazy.  I've never been able to get a table in less than 45 minutes unless it was late at night.  I guess that's not a bad problem to have.  I also kind of wish they would get a full liquor license and take that creative pizza combo creating mind into the cocktail realm.  I mean...Mike's Hot Honey + Whiskey?  Maybe?---------* If you can't find a pizza you like on the printed menu in the restaurant, whip out the smartphone and check out the ""secret"" menu on the website.** This actually happened.",4.0
"We've literally flown across the country to enjoy his pizza. It's that good! Walking in, the aroma of pizza cooking in a brick oven hits your nose.This is about time my stomach starts to growl. The vibe is flowing with positive energy, and the low lighting is flattering & sexy. The bar to the left is where you can order a beverage while you wait.  They have a decent beer selection. Wait times vary, but it's usually not as long as anticipated, and well worth the effort.Everyone, including the servers, seem happy to be there.Paulie Gee is the utmost host. He's always found time to come to our table with suggestions, stories, and the occasional limoncello, (his recipe of the celebratory cocktail).Talking with him, I've gathered that he makes the vegan pizza for the people, or demand for it, but he didn't seem interested in the cause.

"Absolutely delicious. Huge selection of pies - good for meatatarians, vegetarians, and even vegans. Wood fire oven delivers the signature light smoke and char. Dough is absolutely tender and springy. They even let the pizza rest afterwards so the cheese sets and you don't burn the crap out of your mouth.Hellboy- spicy pepperoni with hot honey. Absolute classic pizza. Hot honey perfectly blankets the spicy meat. Super simple, absolutely delicious. Get two, trust meRicotta/sausage pie - similar to one above, hot honey included. However ricotta and sausage are a welcome addition.

Someone sitting next to us saw our struggle and took us to try the  IN Ricotta Da Vegan so we did. AMAZING!!

"My old pal Carlos and I visited Paulie Gee's last night and had a great meal. I'm accustomed to going with the ol' vegan girlfriend and have a tradition where we split two pies from their extensive vegan selection, so we can try two different types of pies. The vegan and non-vegan selections are both extensive; each category has at least a half dozen kinds of pies, including oil bases, white slices, marinara, spinach-based, spicy honey and barbecue sauce foundations. The pies are aesthetically pleasing to every sense, well, every sense except sound. It's usually better when sound isn't a factor. At least when you're talking about food. When you're talking about music, sound is obviously a very important sense to talk about. I may go as far as to say that in a conversation about music, sound is the only sense that matters.I was excited to go with Carlos because I was going to get to eat their meat and actual cheese. The Paulie Gee's brisket is lean and delicious. Their pickled red onions possess a truly memorable tang and are worth spending a couple buck to add on to pretty much any pie. The ricotta dollops on the Ricky Ricotta feel more like bursts of a cream sauce than regular old cheese. Interestingly, the dairy and non-dairy ricotta cheeses are almost indecipherable in quality, which goes to show that Paulie Gee's knows what's up. Carlos and I were pleased to compliment the trad Italian flavors of the Ricky Ricotta with a tangy Barbecue Brisket pie. I'm psyched to go with a fellow omnivore again, because there are tons of other flavor combos I'm eager to try. New Yorkers, such as myself, are notorious for being dicks about the quality of pizza dough. It's the dough that invalidates the Chicago Deep Dish's false aspiration to pizza status. I can't stand Sicilian pizza either, which is a controversial take in Nueva York. Anyhow, no matter how well adorned a Paulie Gee's pie is, its base--the crust--is its most distinct and wonderful element. The crust is thin but springy, and always a little charred. It's pretty much naan bread, which is either a very luck coincidence or a visionary innovation. Naan bread, as you know, is lit, and, as it turns out, it is the perfect surface upon which various pizza ingredients should be placed and/or spread to mingle harmoniously.I've visited Paulie Gee's a number of times, and there's a bit of narrative that forms around my visits. The first time I tried to go, it was around noon, and my gf and I made the unpleasant discovery that Paulie Gee's does not open til 5 PM. The next time, we rolled up in a deep crew of six and had to wait about two to three hours for a table for six. If you find yourself in that position, you'll be okay though because there are plenty of bars around. There's also the water/skyline, mere yards away and a nice record store a block away.The gf and I have gone a few other times and it's always been great--except for the one time that a camera crew was shooting a special on Paulie Gee's vegan options. My girlfriend and I were in the shot all throughout our meal, and we were fighting (as subtly as possible) for the duration of our meal. I was taken aback and somewhat miffed when the producers of the show asked to do a talking head with us outside. The tension was palpable but they still insisted on interviewing us. I really do believe that you should foot the bill if you're going to interview someone for your television series or web series or gratuitously long Yelp review or whatever.

"I almost feel like it's blasphemy for not giving 5 stars. Finally made my way over here at Paulie Gees after way too long. Clearly this place is GPs staple so was excited to drop by on Wednesday night.There was no wait- very good. I had been worried about this so called 3x around 6:45pm to see how long it was before heading over. No one picked up and their answering service basically hangs up on you. I ordered the Daniela and he ordered the brisket pizza. Mine came out a good 7 minutes before his. I noticed immediately that about 40% of the crust was charred to the point of being inedible. To top that off, the spinach topping my pizza was the same. It was literally a black piece of ash and when I picked a leaf up or crumbled in my hands. The cheese blend was very good (mozzarella and Parmesan) but the pizza was just not good. To top it off, parts of the center were soggy and didn't hold the toppings when I grabbed a slice. When the brisket pizza came out a few minutes later I noticed immediately that it was cooked perfectly. The crust was edible and delicious. I was bummed that mine didn't come out this way especially since it seemed like a classic. All I can say is they probably put our orders in together and maybe his needed a little longer in the oven. Mine was most likely getting over cooked while his needed a few more minutes. Hence the gap in time between both of our orders coming out and the reason why mine was half done by the time his came out.I was really disappointed but the good thing to know is at least the brisket pizza was cooked well. I know there is a good meal at Paulie Gees but I feel like we were jipped.Also, great touch that Paulie himself came in to greet all the diners. He was super friendly and it brings a family quality to the place. This is maybe one of the main reasons I'd come back.",3.0
"Delicious!! Definitely made my top 3 favorite pizza  places (the others being robertas and best pizza). We've been meaning to come forever but the line is always so long. We were finally seated right away on a Friday night because we ran over as soon as they opened at 6pm. I would highly recommend this tactic to those of you who have been meaning to come and haven't been able to due to the wait -- the food will be worth it. We ordered the hellboy, ricotta be kidding me and the hot honey ice cream Sunday for dessert. The hellboy was our fave. It was basically a pepperoni pizza with hot honey lined under the cheese. I liked it more than the bees sting from Robertas but both are very good. All in all would highly recommend. As an extra plus Paulie Gee was hanging around today,though it seems like he does this quite often, going from table to table talking to the customers.",5.0
"My husband and I visited Paulie Gee's about two years ago and he still dreams of the Hellboy. This time we ordered the Hellboy and Cherry Jones.  The Hellboy was great but just a touch too sweet for me.  The hot honey adds a little kick but is definitely not too hot.  My husband will tell you it is the best pizza he has ever had (saying a lot since he was raised in the Bronx).  The Cherry Jones on the other hand was way too sweet for both of us.  I couldn't taste anything other then honey.  My husband embarrassed me by telling the waitress we didn't like it.  She offered us a replacement.  We ordered the Ricky Ricotta.  It was alright.  I was shocked because the ricotta was not warm.  The crust at Paulie Gee's is the perfect texture.  However, two of our three pizzas were too charred for my taste.  I must mention Paulie walks around all the tables to make sure everyone is enjoying.  Love it!  The restaurant is too dark and loud for my taste.",3.0
"Interesting decor, super dark inside and it was hard to read the menu. We were seated under one of the speakers, so I felt like an old person complaining about how loud the music was, but really, we came for the food. Split a salad and a Greenpointer pie, and neither disappointed. Both were served quickly, and the pie just exploded with flavor. The lemon kick was strong but not overwhelming, and the crust was perfection. Service was attentive, friendly, and efficient. Lots of menu choices for anything your palate is craving. Overall, a very good experience, and one I would look forward to enjoying again.",4.0
"New York probably takes its pizza more seriously than anywhere else in the world.  I'm sure there are 7 or 8 people reading this right now that would be willing to shiv a guy for saying something bad about their favorite slice.  With that in mind, Paulie Gee's is a pizza lover's pizza place.  They make Neapolitan style pizzas with an oven shipped in from Naples and lovingly reassembled by small, Italian elves.  From this oven, comes perfectly leopard-spotted pizzas with just the right amount of bouncy chewy dough.To top the pizza, there's a lovingly curated selection to choose from so don't you dare ask for substitutions.  Lucky for you whether you're a vegan, vegetarian, white/red pie lover, averse to spice, meat lover, or whatever!  There's at least one pie on the menu* that will make you say, ""hmmm..."".  My personal favorites are the Mo' Cheeks ($16, has guanciale and is perfect with the pickled onions) and Ricotta Be Kidding Me ($17, with tons of meat topped with adorable dollops of cottage cheese).  I've only ever had 1 pizza there that wasn't stellar and I won't tell you which one because you'll definitely judge me for choosing it in the first place.The atmosphere at Paulie Gee's is great.  It's quintessential Brooklyn.  Think dark unfinished wood walls with an eclectic collection of tables made from reclaimed wood, music consisting of a mixture of jazz, rock, and anything but top 40s.  What always makes my night is that the ACTUAL Paulie Gee walks around and talks to EVERYONE.  It doesn't matter if Keri Russell** is sitting right next to you, he will still come by and have a 5-20 minute conversation with you and your table.  My only complaint is how popular this place is.  They've stopped making pizzas to go and still, the wait is crazy.  I've never been able to get a table in less than 45 minutes unless it was late at night.  I guess that's not a bad problem to have.  I also kind of wish they would get a full liquor license and take that creative pizza combo creating mind into the cocktail realm.  I mean...Mike's Hot Honey + Whiskey?  Maybe?---------* If you can't find a pizza you like on the printed menu in the restaurant, whip out the smartphone and check out the ""secret"" menu on the website.** This actually happened.",4.0
"We've literally flown across the country to enjoy his pizza. It's that good! Walking in, the aroma of pizza cooking in a brick oven hits your nose.This is about time my stomach starts to growl. The vibe is flowing with positive energy, and the low lighting is flattering & sexy. The bar to the left is where you can order a beverage while you wait.  They have a decent beer selection. Wait times vary, but it's usually not as long as anticipated, and well worth the effort.Everyone, including the servers, seem happy to be there.Paulie Gee is the utmost host. He's always found time to come to our table with suggestions, stories, and the occasional limoncello, (his recipe of the celebratory cocktail).Talking with him, I've gathered that he makes the vegan pizza for the people, or demand for it, but he didn't seem interested in the cause. The funky bathrooms can be a challenge to use when you've had one too many! VEGAN Pies we LOVE Simply RedVegan Tomato Sauce with Tomatoes, Olive Oil.

"Absolutely delicious. Huge selection of pies - good for meatatarians, vegetarians, and even vegans. Wood fire oven delivers the signature light smoke and char. Dough is absolutely tender and springy. They even let the pizza rest afterwards so the cheese sets and you don't burn the crap out of your mouth.Hellboy- spicy pepperoni with hot honey. Absolute classic pizza. Hot honey perfectly blankets the spicy meat. Super simple, absolutely delicious. Get two, trust meRicotta/sausage pie - similar to one above, hot honey included. However ricotta and sausage are a welcome addition. While chunks of roasted garlic are an excellent accentSo many other pies, go try them for yourself.Big lines, put your name down and go drink at browerij lane.

"One of the challenges of  being vegan is getting your friends/family to be open to the idea of trying vegan food.I have never had Vegan Pizza before and I usually try to try a restaurant first before recommending to anyone especially a non vegan but I took a chance.When we first arrived we were having trouble picking something since everything was foreign to us. Someone sitting next to us saw our struggle and took us to try the  IN Ricotta Da Vegan so we did. AMAZING!! My non vegan date was impressed and I was so happy.Thanks Paulie Gee for making me looking good Whew! One pie (6 small slices) goes for 16 bucks . Its small, nice ambiance I would say its a little darkI would go again!Menu like here ------ pauliegee.com/greenpoint… xoxoC.",4.0
"Some of the best za in the city, bar none. The lady and I traveled far and wide for it since we'd heard such great things. It was a Friday night so the restaurant was predictably packed. There's not much in the form of a waiting area, which particularly sucked given how freezing the weather was, but we had a feeling the pie would be well worth the wait (plus we also got to watch a tipsy couple aggressively suck face up close and personal which was an unexpected but enjoyable twist).The vibe was cool, featuring low--lighting, a huge and beautiful custom brick oven, and trendy attractive people who's favorite bands you've never heard of.When we finally were seated I was stoked to see the menu offered a huge variety of pies with all sorts of niche toppings AND vegan options(I personally don't give two damns about veganism but they presented them in an unpretentious way so I was cool with it). We eventually decided to go with the Hell Boy and the Prokypineapple, both of which were amazing, and I'm looking forward to going back and further chowing my way down the menu.Go here.",5.0
"After a 2-hours wait on a weekend for a party of 2, we finally got a table at the renowned pizza shop in Brooklyn. After having one of the best pizzas of all time at Little Isabella located in Baltimore, I was on the mission to find its companion in NYC. Overhyped as we suspected, Paulie Gee had nothing on Little Isabella! Perhaps, it was the quirky blend of sweet and savory flavors, but with that 2-hour wait, we surely did not have a pleasing experience.We ordered two pies: HellBoy and Greenpointer. HellBoy: Fresh Mozzarella, Italian Tomatoes, Berkshire Sopressata Piccante, Parmigiano Reggiano and Mike's HOT HoneyGreenpointer:Fresh Mozzarella, Baby Arugula, Olive Oil, Fresh Lemon Juice and Shaved Parmigiano ReggianoWe didn't really enjoy the sweetness of the honey in the HellBoy or the sourness of the lemon juice in the Greenpointer. Fresh, as we saw them make each pie to order, I definitely thought the doughiness of the pizza wasn't anything spectacular. In terms of service, I think it was pretty solid. Our waiter was patient and helpful. As a surprise, Paulie Gee himself introduced himself to just about every table, making it feel quite personable. In all, I definitely wouldn't return back to this pizzeria, especially with that crazy wait. During that 2-hour wait and 1.5-hour dining time, I can drive down to Baltimore and get some Little Isabella for half the price and no wait!",3.0
"3.5 stars for this pizza joint hidden behind a HUGE wooden door all the way down Franklin streetCrust was good with a nice char on the hellboy but the crust of the greenpoint pizza seemed a bit underdone We were quoted a 1.5 hour wait at 8pm for 3 on a Saturday but we were lucky that people in front of us hadn't returned so we were seated right away! (so don't be discouraged)---hellboy: everything was good about this except that spicy honey! Should of gone with a more classic margherita style pizza instead---greenpoint: fresh arugula, with a bit too much lemon juice, so nothing special NOTE: they don't have pepper flakes, only chili oil",4.0
"If you want great pizza and the right atmosphere look no further than Paulie Gee's. We sat at the bar (luckily) and avoided a two hour wait.  The pizza choices are numerous, with some very creative options. There were three of us and we started with two pies. Would have been content but it was so good we ordered a third.The texture. The crust. The toppings. Hard pressed to mention anything I didn't like. I love pizza and this place is right up there with the best. That includes many pizzerias throughout Italy.Paulie stopped by for a chat and he has a fantastic personality. Great stories and it is obvious that he loves what he does and holds him team to very high standards.He was also kind enough to give me an official Paulie Gee's pin and a limoncello. A very nice touch!Make sure you check out the pizza oven in the back. It's a small,cozy place so don't pass this place up in you are in NY.",5.0
I take my pizza very seriously. The vegan pizza is so good here that if they didn't tell you it was vegan you would have no clue. I had the pie with vegan sausage and shared a few others with friends. It was all out of this world. I can't wait to go back again.,5.0
"There's a LOT of really great pizza in NYC, that's nothing new. But combine amazing pizza with friendly, caring service and a killer ambiance, and Paulie Gee's has a leg up on a lot of the other heavy hitters. The wait can be crazy, but we came in on a Tuesday night and it was half empty. I guess the key is to come when there's post-blizzard sludge everywhere and no one else wants to go out. Paulie Gee was there as I'm told he usually is, weaving around the space with his cup of coffee and stopping at literally every table. For us, he offered to curate our pizza order and who were we to argue? Read on for what Paulie Gee himself recommends:- The Greenpointer: according to Paulie, basically like eating a salad due to the piles of fresh baby arugula on top. - The Mo Cheeks: My personal favorite of the meal. The pickled onions on there are a nice surprise, and give a nice kick to the rest of the ingredients. - The Monte Cristo: OK, so this is probably something I would never think to order myself, but I'm glad it came out for us because it's actually super tasty. It comes with Canadian bacon and a drizzle of maple syrup, which I know sounds weird but trust me (or rather, trust Paulie). - I didn't catch the name of the last pizza, but it was one of the best and after peeking at the menu again I think it might have been the Hellboy. It was piled high with the tastiest Berkshire Sopressata, and it was perfect with the side of Mike's hot honey (which you haven't tried on pizza you must immediately). They asked if we wanted a dessert pizza but at that point we were stuffed to the gills. It was one of the best New York pizza experiences I've had so far, and the service is what really puts them above and beyond. I'm going to run for vice-president of the Paulie Gee fanclub soon!",5.0
"Came here a few days ago with my friend after work. Very dark inside, took some time for my eyeballs to adjust lol. We started off with some beers and then went with the Hellboy which was AMAZING. The hot honey makes a difference! Then we went with a vegan pie since neither one of us was particularly full. We ordered one with spinach, sea salt and garlic on it (sorry don't remember the name!) It was OK, not that memorable. The standout is by far Hellboy, the crust for both pizzas was SUPER THIN, firm and didn't fall apart on me. We both liked it. I took off a star for the spinach pie being nothing special and that it's a bit on the pricey side. Overall, I think I'll be back to try the other pizzas on the menu!",4.0
"Maybe we came on an off night, but we didn't care too much about the pizza and it was definitely not the best we've had. My friend wanted to celebrate her belated birthday at Paulie Gee's and so we did. We ordered 3 pies (Greenpointer, Ricotta Be Kidding Me, and The Hometown Brisket). I think the Hometown Brisket was our favorite only because of the BBQ sauce. Other than that, there wasn't much brisket pieces on the pizza. Ricotta Be Kidding Me was okay. The Greenpointer was all greens so that balanced our meal a little bit. I hear people waiting for hours to get a seat here and right now I'm just wondering where all the hype went? We came when they were opening, so thank goodness we didn't wait on line for this...cause it wouldn't have been worth it. FYI: There's no sign outside that says ""Paulie Gee's"".

"I almost feel like it's blasphemy for not giving 5 stars. Finally made my way over here at Paulie Gees after way too long. Clearly this place is GPs staple so was excited to drop by on Wednesday night.There was no wait- very good. I had been worried about this so called 3x around 6:45pm to see how long it was before heading over. No one picked up and their answering service basically hangs up on you. I ordered the Daniela and he ordered the brisket pizza. Mine came out a good 7 minutes before his. I noticed immediately that about 40% of the crust was charred to the point of being inedible. To top that off, the spinach topping my pizza was the same. It was literally a black piece of ash and when I picked a leaf up or crumbled in my hands. The cheese blend was very good (mozzarella and Parmesan) but the pizza was just not good. To top it off, parts of the center were soggy and didn't hold the toppings when I grabbed a slice. When the brisket pizza came out a few minutes later I noticed immediately that it was cooked perfectly. The crust was edible and delicious. I was bummed that mine didn't come out this way especially since it seemed like a classic. All I can say is they probably put our orders in together and maybe his needed a little longer in the oven. Mine was most likely getting over cooked while his needed a few more minutes. Hence the gap in time between both of our orders coming out and the reason why mine was half done by the time his came out.I was really disappointed but the good thing to know is at least the brisket pizza was cooked well. I know there is a good meal at Paulie Gees but I feel like we were jipped.Also, great touch that Paulie himself came in to greet all the diners. He was super friendly and it brings a family quality to the place. This is maybe one of the main reasons I'd come back.",3.0
"Delicious!! Definitely made my top 3 favorite pizza  places (the others being robertas and best pizza). We've been meaning to come forever but the line is always so long.

I would highly recommend this tactic to those of you who have been meaning to come and haven't been able to due to the wait -- the food will be worth it. We ordered the hellboy, ricotta be kidding me and the hot honey ice cream Sunday for dessert. The hellboy was our fave. It was basically a pepperoni pizza with hot honey lined under the cheese.

"My husband and I visited Paulie Gee's about two years ago and he still dreams of the Hellboy. This time we ordered the Hellboy and Cherry Jones.  The Hellboy was great but just a touch too sweet for me.  The hot honey adds a little kick but is definitely not too hot.  My husband will tell you it is the best pizza he has ever had (saying a lot since he was raised in the Bronx).  The Cherry Jones on the other hand was way too sweet for both of us.  I couldn't taste anything other then honey.  My husband embarrassed me by telling the waitress we didn't like it.  She offered us a replacement.  We ordered the Ricky Ricotta.  It was alright.  I was shocked because the ricotta was not warm.  The crust at Paulie Gee's is the perfect texture.  However, two of our three pizzas were too charred for my taste.  I must mention Paulie walks around all the tables to make sure everyone is enjoying.  Love it!  The restaurant is too dark and loud for my taste.",3.0

"Absolutely delicious. Huge selection of pies - good for meatatarians, vegetarians, and even vegans. Wood fire oven delivers the signature light smoke and char. Dough is absolutely tender and springy. They even let the pizza rest afterwards so the cheese sets and you don't burn the crap out of your mouth.Hellboy- spicy pepperoni with hot honey. Absolute classic pizza. Hot honey perfectly blankets the spicy meat. Super simple, absolutely delicious. Get two, trust meRicotta/sausage pie - similar to one above, hot honey included. However ricotta and sausage are a welcome addition.

"One of the challenges of  being vegan is getting your friends/family to be open to the idea of trying vegan food.I have never had Vegan Pizza before and I usually try to try a restaurant first before recommending to anyone especially a non vegan but I took a chance.When we first arrived we were having trouble picking something since everything was foreign to us. Someone sitting next to us saw our struggle and took us to try the  IN Ricotta Da Vegan so we did. AMAZING!! My non vegan date was impressed and I was so happy.Thanks Paulie Gee for making me looking good Whew! One pie (6 small slices) goes for 16 bucks . Its small, nice ambiance I would say its a little darkI would go again!Menu like here ------ pauliegee.com/greenpoint… xoxoC.",4.0
"Some of the best za in the city, bar none. The lady and I traveled far and wide for it since we'd heard such great things. It was a Friday night so the restaurant was predictably packed. There's not much in the form of a waiting area, which particularly sucked given how freezing the weather was, but we had a feeling the pie would be well worth the wait (plus we also got to watch a tipsy couple aggressively suck face up close and personal which was an unexpected but enjoyable twist).The vibe was cool, featuring low--lighting, a huge and beautiful custom brick oven, and trendy attractive people who's favorite bands you've never heard of.When we finally were seated I was stoked to see the menu offered a huge variety of pies with all sorts of niche toppings AND vegan options(I personally don't give two damns about veganism but they presented them in an unpretentious way so I was cool with it). We eventually decided to go with the Hell Boy and the Prokypineapple, both of which were amazing, and I'm looking forward to going back and further chowing my way down the menu.Go here.",5.0
"After a 2-hours wait on a weekend for a party of 2, we finally got a table at the renowned pizza shop in Brooklyn. After having one of the best pizzas of all time at Little Isabella located in Baltimore, I was on the mission to find its companion in NYC. Overhyped as we suspected, Paulie Gee had nothing on Little Isabella! Perhaps, it was the quirky blend of sweet and savory flavors, but with that 2-hour wait, we surely did not have a pleasing experience.We ordered two pies: HellBoy and Greenpointer. HellBoy: Fresh Mozzarella, Italian Tomatoes, Berkshire Sopressata Piccante, Parmigiano Reggiano and Mike's HOT HoneyGreenpointer:Fresh Mozzarella, Baby Arugula, Olive Oil, Fresh Lemon Juice and Shaved Parmigiano ReggianoWe didn't really enjoy the sweetness of the honey in the HellBoy or the sourness of the lemon juice in the Greenpointer. Fresh, as we saw them make each pie to order, I definitely thought the doughiness of the pizza wasn't anything spectacular. In terms of service, I think it was pretty solid. Our waiter was patient and helpful. As a surprise, Paulie Gee himself introduced himself to just about every table, making it feel quite personable. In all, I definitely wouldn't return back to this pizzeria, especially with that crazy wait. During that 2-hour wait and 1.5-hour dining time, I can drive down to Baltimore and get some Little Isabella for half the price and no wait!",3.0
"3.5 stars for this pizza joint hidden behind a HUGE wooden door all the way down Franklin streetCrust was good with a nice char on the hellboy but the crust of the greenpoint pizza seemed a bit underdone We were quoted a 1.5 hour wait at 8pm for 3 on a Saturday but we were lucky that people in front of us hadn't returned so we were seated right away! (so don't be discouraged)---hellboy: everything was good about this except that spicy honey! Should of gone with a more classic margherita style pizza instead---greenpoint: fresh arugula, with a bit too much lemon juice, so nothing special NOTE: they don't have pepper flakes, only chili oil",4.0
"If you want great pizza and the right atmosphere look no further than Paulie Gee's. We sat at the bar (luckily) and avoided a two hour wait.  The pizza choices are numerous, with some very creative options. There were three of us and we started with two pies. Would have been content but it was so good we ordered a third.The texture. The crust. The toppings. Hard pressed to mention anything I didn't like. I love pizza and this place is right up there with the best. That includes many pizzerias throughout Italy.Paulie stopped by for a chat and he has a fantastic personality. Great stories and it is obvious that he loves what he does and holds him team to very high standards.He was also kind enough to give me an official Paulie Gee's pin and a limoncello. A very nice touch!Make sure you check out the pizza oven in the back. It's a small,cozy place so don't pass this place up in you are in NY.",5.0
I take my pizza very seriously. The vegan pizza is so good here that if they didn't tell you it was vegan you would have no clue. I had the pie with vegan sausage and shared a few others with friends. It was all out of this world. I can't wait to go back again.,5.0
"There's a LOT of really great pizza in NYC, that's nothing new. But combine amazing pizza with friendly, caring service and a killer ambiance, and Paulie Gee's has a leg up on a lot of the other heavy hitters. The wait can be crazy, but we came in on a Tuesday night and it was half empty. I guess the key is to come when there's post-blizzard sludge everywhere and no one else wants to go out. Paulie Gee was there as I'm told he usually is, weaving around the space with his cup of coffee and stopping at literally every table. For us, he offered to curate our pizza order and who were we to argue? Read on for what Paulie Gee himself recommends:- The Greenpointer: according to Paulie, basically like eating a salad due to the piles of fresh baby arugula on top. - The Mo Cheeks: My personal favorite of the meal. The pickled onions on there are a nice surprise, and give a nice kick to the rest of the ingredients. - The Monte Cristo: OK, so this is probably something I would never think to order myself, but I'm glad it came out for us because it's actually super tasty. It comes with Canadian bacon and a drizzle of maple syrup, which I know sounds weird but trust me (or rather, trust Paulie). - I didn't catch the name of the last pizza, but it was one of the best and after peeking at the menu again I think it might have been the Hellboy. It was piled high with the tastiest Berkshire Sopressata, and it was perfect with the side of Mike's hot honey (which you haven't tried on pizza you must immediately). They asked if we wanted a dessert pizza but at that point we were stuffed to the gills. It was one of the best New York pizza experiences I've had so far, and the service is what really puts them above and beyond. I'm going to run for vice-president of the Paulie Gee fanclub soon!",5.0
"Came here a few days ago with my friend after work. Very dark inside, took some time for my eyeballs to adjust lol. We started off with some beers and then went with the Hellboy which was AMAZING. The hot honey makes a difference! Then we went with a vegan pie since neither one of us was particularly full. We ordered one with spinach, sea salt and garlic on it (sorry don't remember the name!) It was OK, not that memorable. The standout is by far Hellboy, the crust for both pizzas was SUPER THIN, firm and didn't fall apart on me. We both liked it. I took off a star for the spinach pie being nothing special and that it's a bit on the pricey side. Overall, I think I'll be back to try the other pizzas on the menu!",4.0
"Maybe we came on an off night, but we didn't care too much about the pizza and it was definitely not the best we've had. My friend wanted to celebrate her belated birthday at Paulie Gee's and so we did. We ordered 3 pies (Greenpointer, Ricotta Be Kidding Me, and The Hometown Brisket). I think the Hometown Brisket was our favorite only because of the BBQ sauce. Other than that, there wasn't much brisket pieces on the pizza. Ricotta Be Kidding Me was okay. The Greenpointer was all greens so that balanced our meal a little bit. I hear people waiting for hours to get a seat here and right now I'm just wondering where all the hype went? We came when they were opening, so thank goodness we didn't wait on line for this...cause it wouldn't have been worth it. FYI: There's no sign outside that says ""Paulie Gee's"". You just have to look by the address number ""60"" in order to find this place. I actually walked passed it while we were trying to find it. Also, use your flash on your phones to read the menu. I really liked the rustic interior but it was literally pitch black in there.",3.0
"Zagat rated the hellboy as the best pizza in NYC. Wow! Big call Zagat... We had to try! We would say it was delicious... But I would have to say Marta is equal of not just ahead. We got here at 6:40 and had to wait over an hr to sit at the bar. When getting here service was prompt and food was great! We ordered the hellboy and the hellified porkpie white and I have to say it was fresh, full of flavor and great value. My only critique would be more hot suppressa on the hellified and take numbers at the door! It's a little unreasonable to ask people to wait 90 mins and not offer to call when table it ready. Either way it was great but probably won't be crossing the river to wait another 90 mins.",4.0
"If there was ever a restaurant that inspires the need for #PiDay (3.14) to be everyday, it is Paulie Gee's. The pizza is a true art, and every bite is important, from the center to the crust crust.  PG is located in pizza heaven, or right near the water on Greenpoint Ave if you want a Google Map friendly address.Read it on my blog: highclasstohighlifes.com…As you'll see below I'm constantly on the proscuitt of happiness but this time we went for a different ham, Canadian bacon, and on the Monte Cristo. You bet it counted towards happiness. This pizza combines maple syrup drizzle and gouda with the ham. Yes, yes and more yes. Paulie asked if we had butter on the crust...sadly, no. SO MUCH REGRET....that I'll be back in no time to try it. You'll notice on the menu that they have a brisket pizza that features Hometown BBQ -- I love this local BK collaboration. You can get sauced the other way too with Greenpoint local brews!Anyway, I have nearly eaten my way through the entire menu (still need to do a bit of adventuring on the vegan side, every time I get close, I just want meat...) and I have been very pleased with every slice thus far. Therefore my advice to you is go with the pizza that's toppings are most appealing...or grab a handful of friends and share, then you can try multiple pizzas!The man, who is not a myth, but definitely a legend is often found inside checking in on tables, ensuring quality control and getting to know the patrons. He loved my last Instagram post that did a little play words...sharing that I was on the prosciutt of happiness with his King Henry Classic. He's always all smiles and usually wearing a great hat, he is Paulie Gee himself. Paulie Gee's - High Class to High Lifes If you really knead to get delivery or pickup, you'll have to look elsewhere for now though. The only way to leave Paulie Gee's with a to-go box is with leftovers. Rumor has it that a slice joint is opening up nearby though! I'm counting down the days, hours and minutes. Want to keep drooling? Read the menu!Pro Tip: Grab dinner at Paulie Gee's then walk straight out on the water in Greenpoint to Transmitter park or the outlook. Maybe even catch a sunset and BYO night cap!",5.0
"My old pal Carlos and I visited Paulie Gee's last night and had a great meal. I'm accustomed to going with the ol' vegan girlfriend and have a tradition where we split two pies from their extensive vegan selection, so we can try two different types of pies. The vegan and non-vegan selections are both extensive; each category has at least a half dozen kinds of pies, including oil bases, white slices, marinara, spinach-based, spicy honey and barbecue sauce foundations. The pies are aesthetically pleasing to every sense, well, every sense except sound. It's usually better when sound isn't a factor. At least when you're talking about food. When you're talking about music, sound is obviously a very important sense to talk about. I may go as far as to say that in a conversation about music, sound is the only sense that matters.I was excited to go with Carlos because I was going to get to eat their meat and actual cheese. The Paulie Gee's brisket is lean and delicious. Their pickled red onions possess a truly memorable tang and are worth spending a couple buck to add on to pretty much any pie. The ricotta dollops on the Ricky Ricotta feel more like bursts of a cream sauce than regular old cheese. Interestingly, the dairy and non-dairy ricotta cheeses are almost indecipherable in quality, which goes to show that Paulie Gee's knows what's up. Carlos and I were pleased to compliment the trad Italian flavors of the Ricky Ricotta with a tangy Barbecue Brisket pie. I'm psyched to go with a fellow omnivore again, because there are tons of other flavor combos I'm eager to try. New Yorkers, such as myself, are notorious for being dicks about the quality of pizza dough. It's the dough that invalidates the Chicago Deep Dish's false aspiration to pizza status. I can't stand Sicilian pizza either, which is a controversial take in Nueva York. Anyhow, no matter how well adorned a Paulie Gee's pie is, its base--the crust--is its most distinct and wonderful element. The crust is thin but springy, and always a little charred. It's pretty much naan bread, which is either a very luck coincidence or a visionary innovation. Naan bread, as you know, is lit, and, as it turns out, it is the perfect surface upon which various pizza ingredients should be placed and/or spread to mingle harmoniously.I've visited Paulie Gee's a number of times, and there's a bit of narrative that forms around my visits. The first time I tried to go, it was around noon, and my gf and I made the unpleasant discovery that Paulie Gee's does not open til 5 PM. The next time, we rolled up in a deep crew of six and had to wait about two to three hours for a table for six. If you find yourself in that position, you'll be okay though because there are plenty of bars around. There's also the water/skyline, mere yards away and a nice record store a block away.The gf and I have gone a few other times and it's always been great--except for the one time that a camera crew was shooting a special on Paulie Gee's vegan options. My girlfriend and I were in the shot all throughout our meal, and we were fighting (as subtly as possible) for the duration of our meal. I was taken aback and somewhat miffed when the producers of the show asked to do a talking head with us outside. The tension was palpable but they still insisted on interviewing us. I really do believe that you should foot the bill if you're going to interview someone for your television series or web series or gratuitously long Yelp review or whatever. At LEAST commission me to write a song for the soundtrack.In closing, I would like to offer a lil sum sum for the ladies. Are you interested in grandfatherly, charmingly blue collar, short men whose personalities closely resemble those of most Robert De Niro characters--but only in David O. Russel movies? If you do, and might want to be possibly hit on by a man of this caliber, you will love Paulie Gee's. At all times, Paulie Gee's eponymous Pizza Architect and Entrepreneur, Paulie Gee, stalks the narrow spaces between tables, checking in with customers--particularly of the reasonably attractive female demographic--and asks them how their food is, making small talk and thanking them for their patronage. I think this is cool. I would do the same if I were in his position, so don't take this the wrong way. Central to Paulie Gee's game is his ability to recommend a pizza place in seemingly every zip code on the planet and his inclination to tell you (the lady in question) the name of the dude who works there/owns the place, and to tell you (still the lady in question) to tell the dude (who owns the pizza place) to say that he (Paulie Gee) says hi.

"Some of the best za in the city, bar none. The lady and I traveled far and wide for it since we'd heard such great things. It was a Friday night so the restaurant was predictably packed. There's not much in the form of a waiting area, which particularly sucked given how freezing the weather was, but we had a feeling the pie would be well worth the wait (plus we also got to watch a tipsy couple aggressively suck face up close and personal which was an unexpected but enjoyable twist).The vibe was cool, featuring low--lighting, a huge and beautiful custom brick oven, and trendy attractive people who's favorite bands you've never heard of.When we finally were seated I was stoked to see the menu offered a huge variety of pies with all sorts of niche toppings AND vegan options(I personally don't give two damns about veganism but they presented them in an unpretentious way so I was cool with it).

"After a 2-hours wait on a weekend for a party of 2, we finally got a table at the renowned pizza shop in Brooklyn. After having one of the best pizzas of all time at Little Isabella located in Baltimore, I was on the mission to find its companion in NYC. Overhyped as we suspected, Paulie Gee had nothing on Little Isabella! Perhaps, it was the quirky blend of sweet and savory flavors, but with that 2-hour wait, we surely did not have a pleasing experience.We ordered two pies: HellBoy and Greenpointer. HellBoy: Fresh Mozzarella, Italian Tomatoes, Berkshire Sopressata Piccante, Parmigiano Reggiano and Mike's HOT HoneyGreenpointer:Fresh Mozzarella, Baby Arugula, Olive Oil, Fresh Lemon Juice and Shaved Parmigiano ReggianoWe didn't really enjoy the sweetness of the honey in the HellBoy or the sourness of the lemon juice in the Greenpointer. Fresh, as we saw them make each pie to order, I definitely thought the doughiness of the pizza wasn't anything spectacular. In terms of service, I think it was pretty solid. Our waiter was patient and helpful. As a surprise, Paulie Gee himself introduced himself to just about every table, making it feel quite personable. In all, I definitely wouldn't return back to this pizzeria, especially with that crazy wait. During that 2-hour wait and 1.5-hour dining time, I can drive down to Baltimore and get some Little Isabella for half the price and no wait!",3.0

I take my pizza very seriously. The vegan pizza is so good here that if they didn't tell you it was vegan you would have no clue. I had the pie with vegan sausage and shared a few others with friends. It was all out of this world. I can't wait to go back again.,5.0
"There's a LOT of really great pizza in NYC, that's nothing new. But combine amazing pizza with friendly, caring service and a killer ambiance, and Paulie Gee's has a leg up on a lot of the other heavy hitters. The wait can be crazy, but we came in on a Tuesday night and it was half empty. I guess the key is to come when there's post-blizzard sludge everywhere and no one else wants to go out. Paulie Gee was there as I'm told he usually is, weaving around the space with his cup of coffee and stopping at literally every table. For us, he offered to curate our pizza order and who were we to argue? Read on for what Paulie Gee himself recommends:- The Greenpointer: according to Paulie, basically like eating a salad due to the piles of fresh baby arugula on top. - The Mo Cheeks: My personal favorite of the meal. The pickled onions on there are a nice surprise, and give a nice kick to the rest of the ingredients. - The Monte Cristo: OK, so this is probably something I would never think to order myself, but I'm glad it came out for us because it's actually super tasty. It comes with Canadian bacon and a drizzle of maple syrup, which I know sounds weird but trust me (or rather, trust Paulie). - I didn't catch the name of the last pizza, but it was one of the best and after peeking at the menu again I think it might have been the Hellboy. It was piled high with the tastiest Berkshire Sopressata, and it was perfect with the side of Mike's hot honey (which you haven't tried on pizza you must immediately). They asked if we wanted a dessert pizza but at that point we were stuffed to the gills. It was one of the best New York pizza experiences I've had so far, and the service is what really puts them above and beyond. I'm going to run for vice-president of the Paulie Gee fanclub soon!",5.0
"Came here a few days ago with my friend after work. Very dark inside, took some time for my eyeballs to adjust lol. We started off with some beers and then went with the Hellboy which was AMAZING. The hot honey makes a difference! Then we went with a vegan pie since neither one of us was particularly full. We ordered one with spinach, sea salt and garlic on it (sorry don't remember the name!) It was OK, not that memorable. The standout is by far Hellboy, the crust for both pizzas was SUPER THIN, firm and didn't fall apart on me. We both liked it. I took off a star for the spinach pie being nothing special and that it's a bit on the pricey side. Overall, I think I'll be back to try the other pizzas on the menu!",4.0
"Maybe we came on an off night, but we didn't care too much about the pizza and it was definitely not the best we've had. My friend wanted to celebrate her belated birthday at Paulie Gee's and so we did. We ordered 3 pies (Greenpointer, Ricotta Be Kidding Me, and The Hometown Brisket). I think the Hometown Brisket was our favorite only because of the BBQ sauce. Other than that, there wasn't much brisket pieces on the pizza. Ricotta Be Kidding Me was okay. The Greenpointer was all greens so that balanced our meal a little bit. I hear people waiting for hours to get a seat here and right now I'm just wondering where all the hype went? We came when they were opening, so thank goodness we didn't wait on line for this...cause it wouldn't have been worth it. FYI: There's no sign outside that says ""Paulie Gee's"". You just have to look by the address number ""60"" in order to find this place. I actually walked passed it while we were trying to find it. Also, use your flash on your phones to read the menu. I really liked the rustic interior but it was literally pitch black in there.",3.0
"Zagat rated the hellboy as the best pizza in NYC. Wow! Big call Zagat... We had to try! We would say it was delicious... But I would have to say Marta is equal of not just ahead. We got here at 6:40 and had to wait over an hr to sit at the bar. When getting here service was prompt and food was great! We ordered the hellboy and the hellified porkpie white and I have to say it was fresh, full of flavor and great value. My only critique would be more hot suppressa on the hellified and take numbers at the door! It's a little unreasonable to ask people to wait 90 mins and not offer to call when table it ready. Either way it was great but probably won't be crossing the river to wait another 90 mins.",4.0
"If there was ever a restaurant that inspires the need for #PiDay (3.14) to be everyday, it is Paulie Gee's. The pizza is a true art, and every bite is important, from the center to the crust crust.  PG is located in pizza heaven, or right near the water on Greenpoint Ave if you want a Google Map friendly address.Read it on my blog: highclasstohighlifes.com…As you'll see below I'm constantly on the proscuitt of happiness but this time we went for a different ham, Canadian bacon, and on the Monte Cristo. You bet it counted towards happiness. This pizza combines maple syrup drizzle and gouda with the ham. Yes, yes and more yes. Paulie asked if we had butter on the crust...sadly, no. SO MUCH REGRET....that I'll be back in no time to try it. You'll notice on the menu that they have a brisket pizza that features Hometown BBQ -- I love this local BK collaboration. You can get sauced the other way too with Greenpoint local brews!Anyway, I have nearly eaten my way through the entire menu (still need to do a bit of adventuring on the vegan side, every time I get close, I just want meat...) and I have been very pleased with every slice thus far. Therefore my advice to you is go with the pizza that's toppings are most appealing...or grab a handful of friends and share, then you can try multiple pizzas!The man, who is not a myth, but definitely a legend is often found inside checking in on tables, ensuring quality control and getting to know the patrons. He loved my last Instagram post that did a little play words...sharing that I was on the prosciutt of happiness with his King Henry Classic. He's always all smiles and usually wearing a great hat, he is Paulie Gee himself. Paulie Gee's - High Class to High Lifes If you really knead to get delivery or pickup, you'll have to look elsewhere for now though. The only way to leave Paulie Gee's with a to-go box is with leftovers. Rumor has it that a slice joint is opening up nearby though! I'm counting down the days, hours and minutes. Want to keep drooling? Read the menu!Pro Tip: Grab dinner at Paulie Gee's then walk straight out on the water in Greenpoint to Transmitter park or the outlook. Maybe even catch a sunset and BYO night cap!",5.0
"My old pal Carlos and I visited Paulie Gee's last night and had a great meal. I'm accustomed to going with the ol' vegan girlfriend and have a tradition where we split two pies from their extensive vegan selection, so we can try two different types of pies. The vegan and non-vegan selections are both extensive; each category has at least a half dozen kinds of pies, including oil bases, white slices, marinara, spinach-based, spicy honey and barbecue sauce foundations. The pies are aesthetically pleasing to every sense, well, every sense except sound. It's usually better when sound isn't a factor. At least when you're talking about food. When you're talking about music, sound is obviously a very important sense to talk about. I may go as far as to say that in a conversation about music, sound is the only sense that matters.I was excited to go with Carlos because I was going to get to eat their meat and actual cheese. The Paulie Gee's brisket is lean and delicious. Their pickled red onions possess a truly memorable tang and are worth spending a couple buck to add on to pretty much any pie. The ricotta dollops on the Ricky Ricotta feel more like bursts of a cream sauce than regular old cheese. Interestingly, the dairy and non-dairy ricotta cheeses are almost indecipherable in quality, which goes to show that Paulie Gee's knows what's up. Carlos and I were pleased to compliment the trad Italian flavors of the Ricky Ricotta with a tangy Barbecue Brisket pie. I'm psyched to go with a fellow omnivore again, because there are tons of other flavor combos I'm eager to try. New Yorkers, such as myself, are notorious for being dicks about the quality of pizza dough. It's the dough that invalidates the Chicago Deep Dish's false aspiration to pizza status. I can't stand Sicilian pizza either, which is a controversial take in Nueva York. Anyhow, no matter how well adorned a Paulie Gee's pie is, its base--the crust--is its most distinct and wonderful element. The crust is thin but springy, and always a little charred. It's pretty much naan bread, which is either a very luck coincidence or a visionary innovation. Naan bread, as you know, is lit, and, as it turns out, it is the perfect surface upon which various pizza ingredients should be placed and/or spread to mingle harmoniously.I've visited Paulie Gee's a number of times, and there's a bit of narrative that forms around my visits. The first time I tried to go, it was around noon, and my gf and I made the unpleasant discovery that Paulie Gee's does not open til 5 PM. The next time, we rolled up in a deep crew of six and had to wait about two to three hours for a table for six. If you find yourself in that position, you'll be okay though because there are plenty of bars around. There's also the water/skyline, mere yards away and a nice record store a block away.The gf and I have gone a few other times and it's always been great--except for the one time that a camera crew was shooting a special on Paulie Gee's vegan options. My girlfriend and I were in the shot all throughout our meal, and we were fighting (as subtly as possible) for the duration of our meal. I was taken aback and somewhat miffed when the producers of the show asked to do a talking head with us outside. The tension was palpable but they still insisted on interviewing us. I really do believe that you should foot the bill if you're going to interview someone for your television series or web series or gratuitously long Yelp review or whatever. At LEAST commission me to write a song for the soundtrack.In closing, I would like to offer a lil sum sum for the ladies. Are you interested in grandfatherly, charmingly blue collar, short men whose personalities closely resemble those of most Robert De Niro characters--but only in David O. Russel movies? If you do, and might want to be possibly hit on by a man of this caliber, you will love Paulie Gee's. At all times, Paulie Gee's eponymous Pizza Architect and Entrepreneur, Paulie Gee, stalks the narrow spaces between tables, checking in with customers--particularly of the reasonably attractive female demographic--and asks them how their food is, making small talk and thanking them for their patronage. I think this is cool. I would do the same if I were in his position, so don't take this the wrong way. Central to Paulie Gee's game is his ability to recommend a pizza place in seemingly every zip code on the planet and his inclination to tell you (the lady in question) the name of the dude who works there/owns the place, and to tell you (still the lady in question) to tell the dude (who owns the pizza place) to say that he (Paulie Gee) says hi. The Brotherhood of Pizza Mans is truly alive and well.",5.0

"I almost feel like it's blasphemy for not giving 5 stars. Finally made my way over here at Paulie Gees after way too long. Clearly this place is GPs staple so was excited to drop by on Wednesday night.There was no wait- very good. I had been worried about this so called 3x around 6:45pm to see how long it was before heading over. No one picked up and their answering service basically hangs up on you. I ordered the Daniela and he ordered the brisket pizza. Mine came out a good 7 minutes before his. I noticed immediately that about 40% of the crust was charred to the point of being inedible. To top that off, the spinach topping my pizza was the same. It was literally a black piece of ash and when I picked a leaf up or crumbled in my hands. The cheese blend was very good (mozzarella and Parmesan) but the pizza was just not good. To top it off, parts of the center were soggy and didn't hold the toppings when I grabbed a slice. When the brisket pizza came out a few minutes later I noticed immediately that it was cooked perfectly. The crust was edible and delicious. I was bummed that mine didn't come out this way especially since it seemed like a classic. All I can say is they probably put our orders in together and maybe his needed a little longer in the oven. Mine was most likely getting over cooked while his needed a few more minutes. Hence the gap in time between both of our orders coming out and the reason why mine was half done by the time his came out.I was really disappointed but the good thing to know is at least the brisket pizza was cooked well. I know there is a good meal at Paulie Gees but I feel like we were jipped.Also, great touch that Paulie himself came in to greet all the diners. He was super friendly and it brings a family quality to the place. This is maybe one of the main reasons I'd come back.",3.0
"Delicious!! Definitely made my top 3 favorite pizza  places (the others being robertas and best pizza). We've been meaning to come forever but the line is always so long. We were finally seated right away on a Friday night because we ran over as soon as they opened at 6pm. I would highly recommend this tactic to those of you who have been meaning to come and haven't been able to due to the wait -- the food will be worth it. We ordered the hellboy, ricotta be kidding me and the hot honey ice cream Sunday for dessert. The hellboy was our fave. It was basically a pepperoni pizza with hot honey lined under the cheese. I liked it more than the bees sting from Robertas but both are very good. All in all would highly recommend. As an extra plus Paulie Gee was hanging around today,though it seems like he does this quite often, going from table to table talking to the customers.",5.0
"My husband and I visited Paulie Gee's about two years ago and he still dreams of the Hellboy. This time we ordered the Hellboy and Cherry Jones.  The Hellboy was great but just a touch too sweet for me.  The hot honey adds a little kick but is definitely not too hot.  My husband will tell you it is the best pizza he has ever had (saying a lot since he was raised in the Bronx).  The Cherry Jones on the other hand was way too sweet for both of us.  I couldn't taste anything other then honey.  My husband embarrassed me by telling the waitress we didn't like it.  She offered us a replacement.  We ordered the Ricky Ricotta.  It was alright.  I was shocked because the ricotta was not warm.  The crust at Paulie Gee's is the perfect texture.  However, two of our three pizzas were too charred for my taste.  I must mention Paulie walks around all the tables to make sure everyone is enjoying.  Love it!  The restaurant is too dark and loud for my taste.",3.0
"Interesting decor, super dark inside and it was hard to read the menu. We were seated under one of the speakers, so I felt like an old person complaining about how loud the music was, but really, we came for the food. Split a salad and a Greenpointer pie, and neither disappointed. Both were served quickly, and the pie just exploded with flavor. The lemon kick was strong but not overwhelming, and the crust was perfection. Service was attentive, friendly, and efficient. Lots of menu choices for anything your palate is craving. Overall, a very good experience, and one I would look forward to enjoying again.",4.0
"New York probably takes its pizza more seriously than anywhere else in the world.  I'm sure there are 7 or 8 people reading this right now that would be willing to shiv a guy for saying something bad about their favorite slice.  With that in mind, Paulie Gee's is a pizza lover's pizza place.  They make Neapolitan style pizzas with an oven shipped in from Naples and lovingly reassembled by small, Italian elves.  From this oven, comes perfectly leopard-spotted pizzas with just the right amount of bouncy chewy dough.To top the pizza, there's a lovingly curated selection to choose from so don't you dare ask for substitutions.  Lucky for you whether you're a vegan, vegetarian, white/red pie lover, averse to spice, meat lover, or whatever!  There's at least one pie on the menu* that will make you say, ""hmmm..."".  My personal favorites are the Mo' Cheeks ($16, has guanciale and is perfect with the pickled onions) and Ricotta Be Kidding Me ($17, with tons of meat topped with adorable dollops of cottage cheese).  I've only ever had 1 pizza there that wasn't stellar and I won't tell you which one because you'll definitely judge me for choosing it in the first place.The atmosphere at Paulie Gee's is great.  It's quintessential Brooklyn.  Think dark unfinished wood walls with an eclectic collection of tables made from reclaimed wood, music consisting of a mixture of jazz, rock, and anything but top 40s.  What always makes my night is that the ACTUAL Paulie Gee walks around and talks to EVERYONE.  It doesn't matter if Keri Russell** is sitting right next to you, he will still come by and have a 5-20 minute conversation with you and your table.  My only complaint is how popular this place is.  They've stopped making pizzas to go and still, the wait is crazy.  I've never been able to get a table in less than 45 minutes unless it was late at night.  I guess that's not a bad problem to have.  I also kind of wish they would get a full liquor license and take that creative pizza combo creating mind into the cocktail realm.  I mean...Mike's Hot Honey + Whiskey?  Maybe?---------* If you can't find a pizza you like on the printed menu in the restaurant, whip out the smartphone and check out the ""secret"" menu on the website.** This actually happened.",4.0

It was piled high with the tastiest Berkshire Sopressata, and it was perfect with the side of Mike's hot honey (which you haven't tried on pizza you must immediately). They asked if we wanted a dessert pizza but at that point we were stuffed to the gills. It was one of the best New York pizza experiences I've had so far, and the service is what really puts them above and beyond. I'm going to run for vice-president of the Paulie Gee fanclub soon!",5.0
"Came here a few days ago with my friend after work. Very dark inside, took some time for my eyeballs to adjust lol. We started off with some beers and then went with the Hellboy which was AMAZING. The hot honey makes a difference! Then we went with a vegan pie since neither one of us was particularly full. We ordered one with spinach, sea salt and garlic on it (sorry don't remember the name!) It was OK, not that memorable. The standout is by far Hellboy, the crust for both pizzas was SUPER THIN, firm and didn't fall apart on me. We both liked it.

"Maybe we came on an off night, but we didn't care too much about the pizza and it was definitely not the best we've had. My friend wanted to celebrate her belated birthday at Paulie Gee's and so we did. We ordered 3 pies (Greenpointer, Ricotta Be Kidding Me, and The Hometown Brisket). I think the Hometown Brisket was our favorite only because of the BBQ sauce. Other than that, there wasn't much brisket pieces on the pizza. Ricotta Be Kidding Me was okay. The Greenpointer was all greens so that balanced our meal a little bit. I hear people waiting for hours to get a seat here and right now I'm just wondering where all the hype went? We came when they were opening, so thank goodness we didn't wait on line for this...cause it wouldn't have been worth it. FYI: There's no sign outside that says ""Paulie Gee's"".

"My old pal Carlos and I visited Paulie Gee's last night and had a great meal. I'm accustomed to going with the ol' vegan girlfriend and have a tradition where we split two pies from their extensive vegan selection, so we can try two different types of pies. The vegan and non-vegan selections are both extensive; each category has at least a half dozen kinds of pies, including oil bases, white slices, marinara, spinach-based, spicy honey and barbecue sauce foundations. The pies are aesthetically pleasing to every sense, well, every sense except sound. It's usually better when sound isn't a factor. At least when you're talking about food. When you're talking about music, sound is obviously a very important sense to talk about. I may go as far as to say that in a conversation about music, sound is the only sense that matters.I was excited to go with Carlos because I was going to get to eat their meat and actual cheese. The Paulie Gee's brisket is lean and delicious. Their pickled red onions possess a truly memorable tang and are worth spending a couple buck to add on to pretty much any pie. The ricotta dollops on the Ricky Ricotta feel more like bursts of a cream sauce than regular old cheese. Interestingly, the dairy and non-dairy ricotta cheeses are almost indecipherable in quality, which goes to show that Paulie Gee's knows what's up. Carlos and I were pleased to compliment the trad Italian flavors of the Ricky Ricotta with a tangy Barbecue Brisket pie. I'm psyched to go with a fellow omnivore again, because there are tons of other flavor combos I'm eager to try. New Yorkers, such as myself, are notorious for being dicks about the quality of pizza dough. It's the dough that invalidates the Chicago Deep Dish's false aspiration to pizza status. I can't stand Sicilian pizza either, which is a controversial take in Nueva York. Anyhow, no matter how well adorned a Paulie Gee's pie is, its base--the crust--is its most distinct and wonderful element. The crust is thin but springy, and always a little charred. It's pretty much naan bread, which is either a very luck coincidence or a visionary innovation. Naan bread, as you know, is lit, and, as it turns out, it is the perfect surface upon which various pizza ingredients should be placed and/or spread to mingle harmoniously.I've visited Paulie Gee's a number of times, and there's a bit of narrative that forms around my visits. The first time I tried to go, it was around noon, and my gf and I made the unpleasant discovery that Paulie Gee's does not open til 5 PM. The next time, we rolled up in a deep crew of six and had to wait about two to three hours for a table for six. If you find yourself in that position, you'll be okay though because there are plenty of bars around. There's also the water/skyline, mere yards away and a nice record store a block away.The gf and I have gone a few other times and it's always been great--except for the one time that a camera crew was shooting a special on Paulie Gee's vegan options. My girlfriend and I were in the shot all throughout our meal, and we were fighting (as subtly as possible) for the duration of our meal. I was taken aback and somewhat miffed when the producers of the show asked to do a talking head with us outside. The tension was palpable but they still insisted on interviewing us. I really do believe that you should foot the bill if you're going to interview someone for your television series or web series or gratuitously long Yelp review or whatever. At LEAST commission me to write a song for the soundtrack.In closing, I would like to offer a lil sum sum for the ladies. Are you interested in grandfatherly, charmingly blue collar, short men whose personalities closely resemble those of most Robert De Niro characters--but only in David O. Russel movies? If you do, and might want to be possibly hit on by a man of this caliber, you will love Paulie Gee's. At all times, Paulie Gee's eponymous Pizza Architect and Entrepreneur, Paulie Gee, stalks the narrow spaces between tables, checking in with customers--particularly of the reasonably attractive female demographic--and asks them how their food is, making small talk and thanking them for their patronage. I think this is cool. I would do the same if I were in his position, so don't take this the wrong way. Central to Paulie Gee's game is his ability to recommend a pizza place in seemingly every zip code on the planet and his inclination to tell you (the lady in question) the name of the dude who works there/owns the place, and to tell you (still the lady in question) to tell the dude (who owns the pizza place) to say that he (Paulie Gee) says hi. The Brotherhood of Pizza Mans is truly alive and well.",5.0

"I almost feel like it's blasphemy for not giving 5 stars. Finally made my way over here at Paulie Gees after way too long. Clearly this place is GPs staple so was excited to drop by on Wednesday night.There was no wait- very good. I had been worried about this so called 3x around 6:45pm to see how long it was before heading over. No one picked up and their answering service basically hangs up on you. I ordered the Daniela and he ordered the brisket pizza. Mine came out a good 7 minutes before his. I noticed immediately that about 40% of the crust was charred to the point of being inedible. To top that off, the spinach topping my pizza was the same. It was literally a black piece of ash and when I picked a leaf up or crumbled in my hands. The cheese blend was very good (mozzarella and Parmesan) but the pizza was just not good. To top it off, parts of the center were soggy and didn't hold the toppings when I grabbed a slice. When the brisket pizza came out a few minutes later I noticed immediately that it was cooked perfectly. The crust was edible and delicious. I was bummed that mine didn't come out this way especially since it seemed like a classic. All I can say is they probably put our orders in together and maybe his needed a little longer in the oven. Mine was most likely getting over cooked while his needed a few more minutes. Hence the gap in time between both of our orders coming out and the reason why mine was half done by the time his came out.I was really disappointed but the good thing to know is at least the brisket pizza was cooked well. I know there is a good meal at Paulie Gees but I feel like we were jipped.Also, great touch that Paulie himself came in to greet all the diners. He was super friendly and it brings a family quality to the place. This is maybe one of the main reasons I'd come back.",3.0
"Delicious!! Definitely made my top 3 favorite pizza  places (the others being robertas and best pizza). We've been meaning to come forever but the line is always so long. We were finally seated right away on a Friday night because we ran over as soon as they opened at 6pm. I would highly recommend this tactic to those of you who have been meaning to come and haven't been able to due to the wait -- the food will be worth it. We ordered the hellboy, ricotta be kidding me and the hot honey ice cream Sunday for dessert. The hellboy was our fave. It was basically a pepperoni pizza with hot honey lined under the cheese. I liked it more than the bees sting from Robertas but both are very good. All in all would highly recommend. As an extra plus Paulie Gee was hanging around today,though it seems like he does this quite often, going from table to table talking to the customers.",5.0
"My husband and I visited Paulie Gee's about two years ago and he still dreams of the Hellboy. This time we ordered the Hellboy and Cherry Jones.  The Hellboy was great but just a touch too sweet for me.  The hot honey adds a little kick but is definitely not too hot.  My husband will tell you it is the best pizza he has ever had (saying a lot since he was raised in the Bronx).  The Cherry Jones on the other hand was way too sweet for both of us.  I couldn't taste anything other then honey.  My husband embarrassed me by telling the waitress we didn't like it.  She offered us a replacement.  We ordered the Ricky Ricotta.  It was alright.  I was shocked because the ricotta was not warm.  The crust at Paulie Gee's is the perfect texture.  However, two of our three pizzas were too charred for my taste.  I must mention Paulie walks around all the tables to make sure everyone is enjoying.  Love it!  The restaurant is too dark and loud for my taste.",3.0
"Interesting decor, super dark inside and it was hard to read the menu. We were seated under one of the speakers, so I felt like an old person complaining about how loud the music was, but really, we came for the food. Split a salad and a Greenpointer pie, and neither disappointed. Both were served quickly, and the pie just exploded with flavor. The lemon kick was strong but not overwhelming, and the crust was perfection. Service was attentive, friendly, and efficient. Lots of menu choices for anything your palate is craving. Overall, a very good experience, and one I would look forward to enjoying again.",4.0
"New York probably takes its pizza more seriously than anywhere else in the world.  I'm sure there are 7 or 8 people reading this right now that would be willing to shiv a guy for saying something bad about their favorite slice.  With that in mind, Paulie Gee's is a pizza lover's pizza place.  They make Neapolitan style pizzas with an oven shipped in from Naples and lovingly reassembled by small, Italian elves.  From this oven, comes perfectly leopard-spotted pizzas with just the right amount of bouncy chewy dough.To top the pizza, there's a lovingly curated selection to choose from so don't you dare ask for substitutions.  Lucky for you whether you're a vegan, vegetarian, white/red pie lover, averse to spice, meat lover, or whatever!  There's at least one pie on the menu* that will make you say, ""hmmm..."".  My personal favorites are the Mo' Cheeks ($16, has guanciale and is perfect with the pickled onions) and Ricotta Be Kidding Me ($17, with tons of meat topped with adorable dollops of cottage cheese).  I've only ever had 1 pizza there that wasn't stellar and I won't tell you which one because you'll definitely judge me for choosing it in the first place.The atmosphere at Paulie Gee's is great.  It's quintessential Brooklyn.  Think dark unfinished wood walls with an eclectic collection of tables made from reclaimed wood, music consisting of a mixture of jazz, rock, and anything but top 40s.  What always makes my night is that the ACTUAL Paulie Gee walks around and talks to EVERYONE.  It doesn't matter if Keri Russell** is sitting right next to you, he will still come by and have a 5-20 minute conversation with you and your table.  My only complaint is how popular this place is.  They've stopped making pizzas to go and still, the wait is crazy.  I've never been able to get a table in less than 45 minutes unless it was late at night.  I guess that's not a bad problem to have.  I also kind of wish they would get a full liquor license and take that creative pizza combo creating mind into the cocktail realm.  I mean...Mike's Hot Honey + Whiskey?  Maybe?---------* If you can't find a pizza you like on the printed menu in the restaurant, whip out the smartphone and check out the ""secret"" menu on the website.** This actually happened.",4.0
"We've literally flown across the country to enjoy his pizza. It's that good! Walking in, the aroma of pizza cooking in a brick oven hits your nose.This is about time my stomach starts to growl. The vibe is flowing with positive energy, and the low lighting is flattering & sexy. The bar to the left is where you can order a beverage while you wait.  They have a decent beer selection. Wait times vary, but it's usually not as long as anticipated, and well worth the effort.Everyone, including the servers, seem happy to be there.Paulie Gee is the utmost host. He's always found time to come to our table with suggestions, stories, and the occasional limoncello, (his recipe of the celebratory cocktail).Talking with him, I've gathered that he makes the vegan pizza for the people, or demand for it, but he didn't seem interested in the cause. The funky bathrooms can be a challenge to use when you've had one too many! VEGAN Pies we LOVE Simply RedVegan Tomato Sauce with Tomatoes, Olive Oil.

"Absolutely delicious. Huge selection of pies - good for meatatarians, vegetarians, and even vegans. Wood fire oven delivers the signature light smoke and char. Dough is absolutely tender and springy. They even let the pizza rest afterwards so the cheese sets and you don't burn the crap out of your mouth.Hellboy- spicy pepperoni with hot honey. Absolute classic pizza. Hot honey perfectly blankets the spicy meat. Super simple, absolutely delicious. Get two, trust meRicotta/sausage pie - similar to one above, hot honey included. However ricotta and sausage are a welcome addition.

"One of the challenges of  being vegan is getting your friends/family to be open to the idea of trying vegan food.I have never had Vegan Pizza before and I usually try to try a restaurant first before recommending to anyone especially a non vegan but I took a chance.When we first arrived we were having trouble picking something since everything was foreign to us. Someone sitting next to us saw our struggle and took us to try the  IN Ricotta Da Vegan so we did. AMAZING!! My non vegan date was impressed and I was so happy.Thanks Paulie Gee for making me looking good Whew! One pie (6 small slices) goes for 16 bucks . Its small, nice ambiance I would say its a little darkI would go again!Menu like here ------ pauliegee.com/greenpoint… xoxoC.",4.0
"Some of the best za in the city, bar none. The lady and I traveled far and wide for it since we'd heard such great things. It was a Friday night so the restaurant was predictably packed. There's not much in the form of a waiting area, which particularly sucked given how freezing the weather was, but we had a feeling the pie would be well worth the wait (plus we also got to watch a tipsy couple aggressively suck face up close and personal which was an unexpected but enjoyable twist).The vibe was cool, featuring low--lighting, a huge and beautiful custom brick oven, and trendy attractive people who's favorite bands you've never heard of.When we finally were seated I was stoked to see the menu offered a huge variety of pies with all sorts of niche toppings AND vegan options(I personally don't give two damns about veganism but they presented them in an unpretentious way so I was cool with it). We eventually decided to go with the Hell Boy and the Prokypineapple, both of which were amazing, and I'm looking forward to going back and further chowing my way down the menu.Go here.",5.0
"After a 2-hours wait on a weekend for a party of 2, we finally got a table at the renowned pizza shop in Brooklyn. After having one of the best pizzas of all time at Little Isabella located in Baltimore, I was on the mission to find its companion in NYC. Overhyped as we suspected, Paulie Gee had nothing on Little Isabella! Perhaps, it was the quirky blend of sweet and savory flavors, but with that 2-hour wait, we surely did not have a pleasing experience.We ordered two pies: HellBoy and Greenpointer. HellBoy: Fresh Mozzarella, Italian Tomatoes, Berkshire Sopressata Piccante, Parmigiano Reggiano and Mike's HOT HoneyGreenpointer:Fresh Mozzarella, Baby Arugula, Olive Oil, Fresh Lemon Juice and Shaved Parmigiano ReggianoWe didn't really enjoy the sweetness of the honey in the HellBoy or the sourness of the lemon juice in the Greenpointer. Fresh, as we saw them make each pie to order, I definitely thought the doughiness of the pizza wasn't anything spectacular. In terms of service, I think it was pretty solid. Our waiter was patient and helpful. As a surprise, Paulie Gee himself introduced himself to just about every table, making it feel quite personable. In all, I definitely wouldn't return back to this pizzeria, especially with that crazy wait. During that 2-hour wait and 1.5-hour dining time, I can drive down to Baltimore and get some Little Isabella for half the price and no wait!",3.0
"3.5 stars for this pizza joint hidden behind a HUGE wooden door all the way down Franklin streetCrust was good with a nice char on the hellboy but the crust of the greenpoint pizza seemed a bit underdone We were quoted a 1.5 hour wait at 8pm for 3 on a Saturday but we were lucky that people in front of us hadn't returned so we were seated right away! (so don't be discouraged)---hellboy: everything was good about this except that spicy honey! Should of gone with a more classic margherita style pizza instead---greenpoint: fresh arugula, with a bit too much lemon juice, so nothing special NOTE: they don't have pepper flakes, only chili oil",4.0
"If you want great pizza and the right atmosphere look no further than Paulie Gee's. We sat at the bar (luckily) and avoided a two hour wait.  The pizza choices are numerous, with some very creative options. There were three of us and we started with two pies. Would have been content but it was so good we ordered a third.The texture. The crust. The toppings. Hard pressed to mention anything I didn't like. I love pizza and this place is right up there with the best. That includes many pizzerias throughout Italy.Paulie stopped by for a chat and he has a fantastic personality. Great stories and it is obvious that he loves what he does and holds him team to very high standards.He was also kind enough to give me an official Paulie Gee's pin and a limoncello. A very nice touch!Make sure you check out the pizza oven in the back. It's a small,cozy place so don't pass this place up in you are in NY.",5.0
I take my pizza very seriously. The vegan pizza is so good here that if they didn't tell you it was vegan you would have no clue. I had the pie with vegan sausage and shared a few others with friends. It was all out of this world. I can't wait to go back again.,5.0
"There's a LOT of really great pizza in NYC, that's nothing new. But combine amazing pizza with friendly, caring service and a killer ambiance, and Paulie Gee's has a leg up on a lot of the other heavy hitters. The wait can be crazy, but we came in on a Tuesday night and it was half empty. I guess the key is to come when there's post-blizzard sludge everywhere and no one else wants to go out. Paulie Gee was there as I'm told he usually is, weaving around the space with his cup of coffee and stopping at literally every table. For us, he offered to curate our pizza order and who were we to argue? Read on for what Paulie Gee himself recommends:- The Greenpointer: according to Paulie, basically like eating a salad due to the piles of fresh baby arugula on top. - The Mo Cheeks: My personal favorite of the meal. The pickled onions on there are a nice surprise, and give a nice kick to the rest of the ingredients. - The Monte Cristo: OK, so this is probably something I would never think to order myself, but I'm glad it came out for us because it's actually super tasty.

The first time I tried to go, it was around noon, and my gf and I made the unpleasant discovery that Paulie Gee's does not open til 5 PM. The next time, we rolled up in a deep crew of six and had to wait about two to three hours for a table for six.

My girlfriend and I were in the shot all throughout our meal, and we were fighting (as subtly as possible) for the duration of our meal. I was taken aback and somewhat miffed when the producers of the show asked to do a talking head with us outside. The tension was palpable but they still insisted on interviewing us.

"I almost feel like it's blasphemy for not giving 5 stars. Finally made my way over here at Paulie Gees after way too long. Clearly this place is GPs staple so was excited to drop by on Wednesday night.There was no wait- very good. I had been worried about this so called 3x around 6:45pm to see how long it was before heading over. No one picked up and their answering service basically hangs up on you. I ordered the Daniela and he ordered the brisket pizza. Mine came out a good 7 minutes before his. I noticed immediately that about 40% of the crust was charred to the point of being inedible. To top that off, the spinach topping my pizza was the same. It was literally a black piece of ash and when I picked a leaf up or crumbled in my hands. The cheese blend was very good (mozzarella and Parmesan) but the pizza was just not good. To top it off, parts of the center were soggy and didn't hold the toppings when I grabbed a slice. When the brisket pizza came out a few minutes later I noticed immediately that it was cooked perfectly. The crust was edible and delicious. I was bummed that mine didn't come out this way especially since it seemed like a classic. All I can say is they probably put our orders in together and maybe his needed a little longer in the oven. Mine was most likely getting over cooked while his needed a few more minutes. Hence the gap in time between both of our orders coming out and the reason why mine was half done by the time his came out.I was really disappointed but the good thing to know is at least the brisket pizza was cooked well. I know there is a good meal at Paulie Gees but I feel like we were jipped.Also, great touch that Paulie himself came in to greet all the diners. He was super friendly and it brings a family quality to the place. This is maybe one of the main reasons I'd come back.",3.0

I would highly recommend this tactic to those of you who have been meaning to come and haven't been able to due to the wait -- the food will be worth it. We ordered the hellboy, ricotta be kidding me and the hot honey ice cream Sunday for dessert. The hellboy was our fave. It was basically a pepperoni pizza with hot honey lined under the cheese. I liked it more than the bees sting from Robertas but both are very good. All in all would highly recommend.

"My husband and I visited Paulie Gee's about two years ago and he still dreams of the Hellboy. This time we ordered the Hellboy and Cherry Jones.  The Hellboy was great but just a touch too sweet for me.  The hot honey adds a little kick but is definitely not too hot.  My husband will tell you it is the best pizza he has ever had (saying a lot since he was raised in the Bronx).  The Cherry Jones on the other hand was way too sweet for both of us.  I couldn't taste anything other then honey.  My husband embarrassed me by telling the waitress we didn't like it.  She offered us a replacement.  We ordered the Ricky Ricotta.  It was alright.  I was shocked because the ricotta was not warm.  The crust at Paulie Gee's is the perfect texture.  However, two of our three pizzas were too charred for my taste.  I must mention Paulie walks around all the tables to make sure everyone is enjoying.  Love it!  The restaurant is too dark and loud for my taste.",3.0

"New York probably takes its pizza more seriously than anywhere else in the world.  I'm sure there are 7 or 8 people reading this right now that would be willing to shiv a guy for saying something bad about their favorite slice.  With that in mind, Paulie Gee's is a pizza lover's pizza place.  They make Neapolitan style pizzas with an oven shipped in from Naples and lovingly reassembled by small, Italian elves.  From this oven, comes perfectly leopard-spotted pizzas with just the right amount of bouncy chewy dough.To top the pizza, there's a lovingly curated selection to choose from so don't you dare ask for substitutions.  Lucky for you whether you're a vegan, vegetarian, white/red pie lover, averse to spice, meat lover, or whatever!  There's at least one pie on the menu* that will make you say, ""hmmm..."".  My personal favorites are the Mo' Cheeks ($16, has guanciale and is perfect with the pickled onions) and Ricotta Be Kidding Me ($17, with tons of meat topped with adorable dollops of cottage cheese).  I've only ever had 1 pizza there that wasn't stellar and I won't tell you which one because you'll definitely judge me for choosing it in the first place.The atmosphere at Paulie Gee's is great.  It's quintessential Brooklyn.  Think dark unfinished wood walls with an eclectic collection of tables made from reclaimed wood, music consisting of a mixture of jazz, rock, and anything but top 40s.  What always makes my night is that the ACTUAL Paulie Gee walks around and talks to EVERYONE.  It doesn't matter if Keri Russell** is sitting right next to you, he will still come by and have a 5-20 minute conversation with you and your table.  My only complaint is how popular this place is.  They've stopped making pizzas to go and still, the wait is crazy.  I've never been able to get a table in less than 45 minutes unless it was late at night.  I guess that's not a bad problem to have.  I also kind of wish they would get a full liquor license and take that creative pizza combo creating mind into the cocktail realm.  I mean...Mike's Hot Honey + Whiskey?  Maybe?---------* If you can't find a pizza you like on the printed menu in the restaurant, whip out the smartphone and check out the ""secret"" menu on the website.** This actually happened.",4.0
"We've literally flown across the country to enjoy his pizza. It's that good! Walking in, the aroma of pizza cooking in a brick oven hits your nose.This is about time my stomach starts to growl. The vibe is flowing with positive energy, and the low lighting is flattering & sexy. The bar to the left is where you can order a beverage while you wait.  They have a decent beer selection. Wait times vary, but it's usually not as long as anticipated, and well worth the effort.Everyone, including the servers, seem happy to be there.Paulie Gee is the utmost host. He's always found time to come to our table with suggestions, stories, and the occasional limoncello, (his recipe of the celebratory cocktail).Talking with him, I've gathered that he makes the vegan pizza for the people, or demand for it, but he didn't seem interested in the cause. The funky bathrooms can be a challenge to use when you've had one too many! VEGAN Pies we LOVE Simply RedVegan Tomato Sauce with Tomatoes, Olive Oil. Vidalia Onions, Garlic, Basil, Salt and PepperVegan Daniela SpinaciBaby Spinach, Olive Oil, Fresh Sliced Garlic, Mild Aleppo Chili Oil and Sea SaltIn Ricotta Da VeganVegan Tomato Sauce, House Made Vegan Sausage, Post-oven House Made Cashew Ricotta Dollops, Baby Arugula and Extra Virgin Olive OilWith many return visits, we've yet to have a negative experience.There has been noise over the years of Paulie Giannone opening a Portland outpost, but it has yet to materialize. Meanwhile, I'll dream of his pizza.",5.0
"Absolutely delicious. Huge selection of pies - good for meatatarians, vegetarians, and even vegans. Wood fire oven delivers the signature light smoke and char. Dough is absolutely tender and springy. They even let the pizza rest afterwards so the cheese sets and you don't burn the crap out of your mouth.Hellboy- spicy pepperoni with hot honey. Absolute classic pizza. Hot honey perfectly blankets the spicy meat. Super simple, absolutely delicious. Get two, trust meRicotta/sausage pie - similar to one above, hot honey included. However ricotta and sausage are a welcome addition. While chunks of roasted garlic are an excellent accentSo many other pies, go try them for yourself.Big lines, put your name down and go drink at browerij lane.

"One of the challenges of  being vegan is getting your friends/family to be open to the idea of trying vegan food.I have never had Vegan Pizza before and I usually try to try a restaurant first before recommending to anyone especially a non vegan but I took a chance.When we first arrived we were having trouble picking something since everything was foreign to us. Someone sitting next to us saw our struggle and took us to try the  IN Ricotta Da Vegan so we did. AMAZING!! My non vegan date was impressed and I was so happy.Thanks Paulie Gee for making me looking good Whew! One pie (6 small slices) goes for 16 bucks . Its small, nice ambiance I would say its a little darkI would go again!Menu like here ------ pauliegee.com/greenpoint… xoxoC.",4.0
"Some of the best za in the city, bar none. The lady and I traveled far and wide for it since we'd heard such great things. It was a Friday night so the restaurant was predictably packed. There's not much in the form of a waiting area, which particularly sucked given how freezing the weather was, but we had a feeling the pie would be well worth the wait (plus we also got to watch a tipsy couple aggressively suck face up close and personal which was an unexpected but enjoyable twist).The vibe was cool, featuring low--lighting, a huge and beautiful custom brick oven, and trendy attractive people who's favorite bands you've never heard of.When we finally were seated I was stoked to see the menu offered a huge variety of pies with all sorts of niche toppings AND vegan options(I personally don't give two damns about veganism but they presented them in an unpretentious way so I was cool with it). We eventually decided to go with the Hell Boy and the Prokypineapple, both of which were amazing, and I'm looking forward to going back and further chowing my way down the menu.Go here.",5.0
"After a 2-hours wait on a weekend for a party of 2, we finally got a table at the renowned pizza shop in Brooklyn. After having one of the best pizzas of all time at Little Isabella located in Baltimore, I was on the mission to find its companion in NYC. Overhyped as we suspected, Paulie Gee had nothing on Little Isabella! Perhaps, it was the quirky blend of sweet and savory flavors, but with that 2-hour wait, we surely did not have a pleasing experience.We ordered two pies: HellBoy and Greenpointer. HellBoy: Fresh Mozzarella, Italian Tomatoes, Berkshire Sopressata Piccante, Parmigiano Reggiano and Mike's HOT HoneyGreenpointer:Fresh Mozzarella, Baby Arugula, Olive Oil, Fresh Lemon Juice and Shaved Parmigiano ReggianoWe didn't really enjoy the sweetness of the honey in the HellBoy or the sourness of the lemon juice in the Greenpointer. Fresh, as we saw them make each pie to order, I definitely thought the doughiness of the pizza wasn't anything spectacular. In terms of service, I think it was pretty solid. Our waiter was patient and helpful. As a surprise, Paulie Gee himself introduced himself to just about every table, making it feel quite personable. In all, I definitely wouldn't return back to this pizzeria, especially with that crazy wait. During that 2-hour wait and 1.5-hour dining time, I can drive down to Baltimore and get some Little Isabella for half the price and no wait!",3.0
"3.5 stars for this pizza joint hidden behind a HUGE wooden door all the way down Franklin streetCrust was good with a nice char on the hellboy but the crust of the greenpoint pizza seemed a bit underdone We were quoted a 1.5 hour wait at 8pm for 3 on a Saturday but we were lucky that people in front of us hadn't returned so we were seated right away! (so don't be discouraged)---hellboy: everything was good about this except that spicy honey! Should of gone with a more classic margherita style pizza instead---greenpoint: fresh arugula, with a bit too much lemon juice, so nothing special NOTE: they don't have pepper flakes, only chili oil",4.0
"If you want great pizza and the right atmosphere look no further than Paulie Gee's. We sat at the bar (luckily) and avoided a two hour wait.  The pizza choices are numerous, with some very creative options. There were three of us and we started with two pies. Would have been content but it was so good we ordered a third.The texture. The crust. The toppings. Hard pressed to mention anything I didn't like. I love pizza and this place is right up there with the best. That includes many pizzerias throughout Italy.Paulie stopped by for a chat and he has a fantastic personality. Great stories and it is obvious that he loves what he does and holds him team to very high standards.He was also kind enough to give me an official Paulie Gee's pin and a limoncello. A very nice touch!Make sure you check out the pizza oven in the back. It's a small,cozy place so don't pass this place up in you are in NY.",5.0
I take my pizza very seriously. The vegan pizza is so good here that if they didn't tell you it was vegan you would have no clue. I had the pie with vegan sausage and shared a few others with friends. It was all out of this world. I can't wait to go back again.,5.0
"There's a LOT of really great pizza in NYC, that's nothing new. But combine amazing pizza with friendly, caring service and a killer ambiance, and Paulie Gee's has a leg up on a lot of the other heavy hitters. The wait can be crazy, but we came in on a Tuesday night and it was half empty. I guess the key is to come when there's post-blizzard sludge everywhere and no one else wants to go out. Paulie Gee was there as I'm told he usually is, weaving around the space with his cup of coffee and stopping at literally every table. For us, he offered to curate our pizza order and who were we to argue? Read on for what Paulie Gee himself recommends:- The Greenpointer: according to Paulie, basically like eating a salad due to the piles of fresh baby arugula on top. - The Mo Cheeks: My personal favorite of the meal. The pickled onions on there are a nice surprise, and give a nice kick to the rest of the ingredients. - The Monte Cristo: OK, so this is probably something I would never think to order myself, but I'm glad it came out for us because it's actually super tasty. It comes with Canadian bacon and a drizzle of maple syrup, which I know sounds weird but trust me (or rather, trust Paulie). - I didn't catch the name of the last pizza, but it was one of the best and after peeking at the menu again I think it might have been the Hellboy. It was piled high with the tastiest Berkshire Sopressata, and it was perfect with the side of Mike's hot honey (which you haven't tried on pizza you must immediately). They asked if we wanted a dessert pizza but at that point we were stuffed to the gills. It was one of the best New York pizza experiences I've had so far, and the service is what really puts them above and beyond. I'm going to run for vice-president of the Paulie Gee fanclub soon!",5.0
"Came here a few days ago with my friend after work. Very dark inside, took some time for my eyeballs to adjust lol. We started off with some beers and then went with the Hellboy which was AMAZING. The hot honey makes a difference! Then we went with a vegan pie since neither one of us was particularly full. We ordered one with spinach, sea salt and garlic on it (sorry don't remember the name!) It was OK, not that memorable. The standout is by far Hellboy, the crust for both pizzas was SUPER THIN, firm and didn't fall apart on me. We both liked it. I took off a star for the spinach pie being nothing special and that it's a bit on the pricey side. Overall, I think I'll be back to try the other pizzas on the menu!",4.0
"Maybe we came on an off night, but we didn't care too much about the pizza and it was definitely not the best we've had. My friend wanted to celebrate her belated birthday at Paulie Gee's and so we did. We ordered 3 pies (Greenpointer, Ricotta Be Kidding Me, and The Hometown Brisket). I think the Hometown Brisket was our favorite only because of the BBQ sauce. Other than that, there wasn't much brisket pieces on the pizza. Ricotta Be Kidding Me was okay. The Greenpointer was all greens so that balanced our meal a little bit. I hear people waiting for hours to get a seat here and right now I'm just wondering where all the hype went? We came when they were opening, so thank goodness we didn't wait on line for this...cause it wouldn't have been worth it. FYI: There's no sign outside that says ""Paulie Gee's"". You just have to look by the address number ""60"" in order to find this place. I actually walked passed it while we were trying to find it. Also, use your flash on your phones to read the menu. I really liked the rustic interior but it was literally pitch black in there.",3.0
"Zagat rated the hellboy as the best pizza in NYC. Wow! Big call Zagat... We had to try! We would say it was delicious... But I would have to say Marta is equal of not just ahead. We got here at 6:40 and had to wait over an hr to sit at the bar. When getting here service was prompt and food was great! We ordered the hellboy and the hellified porkpie white and I have to say it was fresh, full of flavor and great value. My only critique would be more hot suppressa on the hellified and take numbers at the door! It's a little unreasonable to ask people to wait 90 mins and not offer to call when table it ready. Either way it was great but probably won't be crossing the river to wait another 90 mins.",4.0
"If there was ever a restaurant that inspires the need for #PiDay (3.14) to be everyday, it is Paulie Gee's. The pizza is a true art, and every bite is important, from the center to the crust crust.  PG is located in pizza heaven, or right near the water on Greenpoint Ave if you want a Google Map friendly address.Read it on my blog: highclasstohighlifes.com…As you'll see below I'm constantly on the proscuitt of happiness but this time we went for a different ham, Canadian bacon, and on the Monte Cristo. You bet it counted towards happiness. This pizza combines maple syrup drizzle and gouda with the ham. Yes, yes and more yes. Paulie asked if we had butter on the crust...sadly, no. SO MUCH REGRET....that I'll be back in no time to try it. You'll notice on the menu that they have a brisket pizza that features Hometown BBQ -- I love this local BK collaboration. You can get sauced the other way too with Greenpoint local brews!Anyway, I have nearly eaten my way through the entire menu (still need to do a bit of adventuring on the vegan side, every time I get close, I just want meat...) and I have been very pleased with every slice thus far. Therefore my advice to you is go with the pizza that's toppings are most appealing...or grab a handful of friends and share, then you can try multiple pizzas!The man, who is not a myth, but definitely a legend is often found inside checking in on tables, ensuring quality control and getting to know the patrons. He loved my last Instagram post that did a little play words...sharing that I was on the prosciutt of happiness with his King Henry Classic. He's always all smiles and usually wearing a great hat, he is Paulie Gee himself. Paulie Gee's - High Class to High Lifes If you really knead to get delivery or pickup, you'll have to look elsewhere for now though. The only way to leave Paulie Gee's with a to-go box is with leftovers. Rumor has it that a slice joint is opening up nearby though! I'm counting down the days, hours and minutes. Want to keep drooling? Read the menu!Pro Tip: Grab dinner at Paulie Gee's then walk straight out on the water in Greenpoint to Transmitter park or the outlook. Maybe even catch a sunset and BYO night cap!",5.0
"My old pal Carlos and I visited Paulie Gee's last night and had a great meal. I'm accustomed to going with the ol' vegan girlfriend and have a tradition where we split two pies from their extensive vegan selection, so we can try two different types of pies. The vegan and non-vegan selections are both extensive; each category has at least a half dozen kinds of pies, including oil bases, white slices, marinara, spinach-based, spicy honey and barbecue sauce foundations. The pies are aesthetically pleasing to every sense, well, every sense except sound. It's usually better when sound isn't a factor. At least when you're talking about food. When you're talking about music, sound is obviously a very important sense to talk about. I may go as far as to say that in a conversation about music, sound is the only sense that matters.I was excited to go with Carlos because I was going to get to eat their meat and actual cheese. The Paulie Gee's brisket is lean and delicious. Their pickled red onions possess a truly memorable tang and are worth spending a couple buck to add on to pretty much any pie. The ricotta dollops on the Ricky Ricotta feel more like bursts of a cream sauce than regular old cheese. Interestingly, the dairy and non-dairy ricotta cheeses are almost indecipherable in quality, which goes to show that Paulie Gee's knows what's up. Carlos and I were pleased to compliment the trad Italian flavors of the Ricky Ricotta with a tangy Barbecue Brisket pie. I'm psyched to go with a fellow omnivore again, because there are tons of other flavor combos I'm eager to try. New Yorkers, such as myself, are notorious for being dicks about the quality of pizza dough. It's the dough that invalidates the Chicago Deep Dish's false aspiration to pizza status. I can't stand Sicilian pizza either, which is a controversial take in Nueva York. Anyhow, no matter how well adorned a Paulie Gee's pie is, its base--the crust--is its most distinct and wonderful element. The crust is thin but springy, and always a little charred. It's pretty much naan bread, which is either a very luck coincidence or a visionary innovation. Naan bread, as you know, is lit, and, as it turns out, it is the perfect surface upon which various pizza ingredients should be placed and/or spread to mingle harmoniously.I've visited Paulie Gee's a number of times, and there's a bit of narrative that forms around my visits. The first time I tried to go, it was around noon, and my gf and I made the unpleasant discovery that Paulie Gee's does not open til 5 PM. The next time, we rolled up in a deep crew of six and had to wait about two to three hours for a table for six. If you find yourself in that position, you'll be okay though because there are plenty of bars around. There's also the water/skyline, mere yards away and a nice record store a block away.The gf and I have gone a few other times and it's always been great--except for the one time that a camera crew was shooting a special on Paulie Gee's vegan options.

"New York probably takes its pizza more seriously than anywhere else in the world.  I'm sure there are 7 or 8 people reading this right now that would be willing to shiv a guy for saying something bad about their favorite slice.  With that in mind, Paulie Gee's is a pizza lover's pizza place.  They make Neapolitan style pizzas with an oven shipped in from Naples and lovingly reassembled by small, Italian elves.  From this oven, comes perfectly leopard-spotted pizzas with just the right amount of bouncy chewy dough.To top the pizza, there's a lovingly curated selection to choose from so don't you dare ask for substitutions.  Lucky for you whether you're a vegan, vegetarian, white/red pie lover, averse to spice, meat lover, or whatever!  There's at least one pie on the menu* that will make you say, ""hmmm..."".  My personal favorites are the Mo' Cheeks ($16, has guanciale and is perfect with the pickled onions) and Ricotta Be Kidding Me ($17, with tons of meat topped with adorable dollops of cottage cheese).  I've only ever had 1 pizza there that wasn't stellar and I won't tell you which one because you'll definitely judge me for choosing it in the first place.The atmosphere at Paulie Gee's is great.  It's quintessential Brooklyn.  Think dark unfinished wood walls with an eclectic collection of tables made from reclaimed wood, music consisting of a mixture of jazz, rock, and anything but top 40s.  What always makes my night is that the ACTUAL Paulie Gee walks around and talks to EVERYONE.  It doesn't matter if Keri Russell** is sitting right next to you, he will still come by and have a 5-20 minute conversation with you and your table.  My only complaint is how popular this place is.  They've stopped making pizzas to go and still, the wait is crazy.  I've never been able to get a table in less than 45 minutes unless it was late at night.  I guess that's not a bad problem to have.  I also kind of wish they would get a full liquor license and take that creative pizza combo creating mind into the cocktail realm.  I mean...Mike's Hot Honey + Whiskey?  Maybe?---------* If you can't find a pizza you like on the printed menu in the restaurant, whip out the smartphone and check out the ""secret"" menu on the website.** This actually happened.",4.0

"Some of the best za in the city, bar none. The lady and I traveled far and wide for it since we'd heard such great things. It was a Friday night so the restaurant was predictably packed. There's not much in the form of a waiting area, which particularly sucked given how freezing the weather was, but we had a feeling the pie would be well worth the wait (plus we also got to watch a tipsy couple aggressively suck face up close and personal which was an unexpected but enjoyable twist).The vibe was cool, featuring low--lighting, a huge and beautiful custom brick oven, and trendy attractive people who's favorite bands you've never heard of.When we finally were seated I was stoked to see the menu offered a huge variety of pies with all sorts of niche toppings AND vegan options(I personally don't give two damns about veganism but they presented them in an unpretentious way so I was cool with it).

"After a 2-hours wait on a weekend for a party of 2, we finally got a table at the renowned pizza shop in Brooklyn. After having one of the best pizzas of all time at Little Isabella located in Baltimore, I was on the mission to find its companion in NYC. Overhyped as we suspected, Paulie Gee had nothing on Little Isabella! Perhaps, it was the quirky blend of sweet and savory flavors, but with that 2-hour wait, we surely did not have a pleasing experience.We ordered two pies: HellBoy and Greenpointer. HellBoy: Fresh Mozzarella, Italian Tomatoes, Berkshire Sopressata Piccante, Parmigiano Reggiano and Mike's HOT HoneyGreenpointer:Fresh Mozzarella, Baby Arugula, Olive Oil, Fresh Lemon Juice and Shaved Parmigiano ReggianoWe didn't really enjoy the sweetness of the honey in the HellBoy or the sourness of the lemon juice in the Greenpointer. Fresh, as we saw them make each pie to order, I definitely thought the doughiness of the pizza wasn't anything spectacular. In terms of service, I think it was pretty solid. Our waiter was patient and helpful. As a surprise, Paulie Gee himself introduced himself to just about every table, making it feel quite personable. In all, I definitely wouldn't return back to this pizzeria, especially with that crazy wait. During that 2-hour wait and 1.5-hour dining time, I can drive down to Baltimore and get some Little Isabella for half the price and no wait!",3.0
"3.5 stars for this pizza joint hidden behind a HUGE wooden door all the way down Franklin streetCrust was good with a nice char on the hellboy but the crust of the greenpoint pizza seemed a bit underdone We were quoted a 1.5 hour wait at 8pm for 3 on a Saturday but we were lucky that people in front of us hadn't returned so we were seated right away! (so don't be discouraged)---hellboy: everything was good about this except that spicy honey! Should of gone with a more classic margherita style pizza instead---greenpoint: fresh arugula, with a bit too much lemon juice, so nothing special NOTE: they don't have pepper flakes, only chili oil",4.0
"If you want great pizza and the right atmosphere look no further than Paulie Gee's. We sat at the bar (luckily) and avoided a two hour wait.  The pizza choices are numerous, with some very creative options. There were three of us and we started with two pies. Would have been content but it was so good we ordered a third.The texture. The crust. The toppings. Hard pressed to mention anything I didn't like. I love pizza and this place is right up there with the best. That includes many pizzerias throughout Italy.Paulie stopped by for a chat and he has a fantastic personality. Great stories and it is obvious that he loves what he does and holds him team to very high standards.He was also kind enough to give me an official Paulie Gee's pin and a limoncello. A very nice touch!Make sure you check out the pizza oven in the back. It's a small,cozy place so don't pass this place up in you are in NY.",5.0
I take my pizza very seriously. The vegan pizza is so good here that if they didn't tell you it was vegan you would have no clue. I had the pie with vegan sausage and shared a few others with friends. It was all out of this world. I can't wait to go back again.,5.0
"There's a LOT of really great pizza in NYC, that's nothing new. But combine amazing pizza with friendly, caring service and a killer ambiance, and Paulie Gee's has a leg up on a lot of the other heavy hitters. The wait can be crazy, but we came in on a Tuesday night and it was half empty. I guess the key is to come when there's post-blizzard sludge everywhere and no one else wants to go out. Paulie Gee was there as I'm told he usually is, weaving around the space with his cup of coffee and stopping at literally every table. For us, he offered to curate our pizza order and who were we to argue? Read on for what Paulie Gee himself recommends:- The Greenpointer: according to Paulie, basically like eating a salad due to the piles of fresh baby arugula on top. - The Mo Cheeks: My personal favorite of the meal. The pickled onions on there are a nice surprise, and give a nice kick to the rest of the ingredients. - The Monte Cristo: OK, so this is probably something I would never think to order myself, but I'm glad it came out for us because it's actually super tasty. It comes with Canadian bacon and a drizzle of maple syrup, which I know sounds weird but trust me (or rather, trust Paulie). - I didn't catch the name of the last pizza, but it was one of the best and after peeking at the menu again I think it might have been the Hellboy. It was piled high with the tastiest Berkshire Sopressata, and it was perfect with the side of Mike's hot honey (which you haven't tried on pizza you must immediately). They asked if we wanted a dessert pizza but at that point we were stuffed to the gills. It was one of the best New York pizza experiences I've had so far, and the service is what really puts them above and beyond. I'm going to run for vice-president of the Paulie Gee fanclub soon!",5.0
"Came here a few days ago with my friend after work. Very dark inside, took some time for my eyeballs to adjust lol. We started off with some beers and then went with the Hellboy which was AMAZING. The hot honey makes a difference! Then we went with a vegan pie since neither one of us was particularly full. We ordered one with spinach, sea salt and garlic on it (sorry don't remember the name!) It was OK, not that memorable. The standout is by far Hellboy, the crust for both pizzas was SUPER THIN, firm and didn't fall apart on me. We both liked it. I took off a star for the spinach pie being nothing special and that it's a bit on the pricey side. Overall, I think I'll be back to try the other pizzas on the menu!",4.0
"Maybe we came on an off night, but we didn't care too much about the pizza and it was definitely not the best we've had. My friend wanted to celebrate her belated birthday at Paulie Gee's and so we did. We ordered 3 pies (Greenpointer, Ricotta Be Kidding Me, and The Hometown Brisket). I think the Hometown Brisket was our favorite only because of the BBQ sauce. Other than that, there wasn't much brisket pieces on the pizza. Ricotta Be Kidding Me was okay. The Greenpointer was all greens so that balanced our meal a little bit. I hear people waiting for hours to get a seat here and right now I'm just wondering where all the hype went? We came when they were opening, so thank goodness we didn't wait on line for this...cause it wouldn't have been worth it. FYI: There's no sign outside that says ""Paulie Gee's"". You just have to look by the address number ""60"" in order to find this place. I actually walked passed it while we were trying to find it. Also, use your flash on your phones to read the menu. I really liked the rustic interior but it was literally pitch black in there.",3.0
"Zagat rated the hellboy as the best pizza in NYC. Wow! Big call Zagat... We had to try! We would say it was delicious... But I would have to say Marta is equal of not just ahead. We got here at 6:40 and had to wait over an hr to sit at the bar. When getting here service was prompt and food was great! We ordered the hellboy and the hellified porkpie white and I have to say it was fresh, full of flavor and great value. My only critique would be more hot suppressa on the hellified and take numbers at the door! It's a little unreasonable to ask people to wait 90 mins and not offer to call when table it ready. Either way it was great but probably won't be crossing the river to wait another 90 mins.",4.0
"If there was ever a restaurant that inspires the need for #PiDay (3.14) to be everyday, it is Paulie Gee's. The pizza is a true art, and every bite is important, from the center to the crust crust.  PG is located in pizza heaven, or right near the water on Greenpoint Ave if you want a Google Map friendly address.Read it on my blog: highclasstohighlifes.com…As you'll see below I'm constantly on the proscuitt of happiness but this time we went for a different ham, Canadian bacon, and on the Monte Cristo. You bet it counted towards happiness. This pizza combines maple syrup drizzle and gouda with the ham. Yes, yes and more yes. Paulie asked if we had butter on the crust...sadly, no. SO MUCH REGRET....that I'll be back in no time to try it. You'll notice on the menu that they have a brisket pizza that features Hometown BBQ -- I love this local BK collaboration. You can get sauced the other way too with Greenpoint local brews!Anyway, I have nearly eaten my way through the entire menu (still need to do a bit of adventuring on the vegan side, every time I get close, I just want meat...) and I have been very pleased with every slice thus far. Therefore my advice to you is go with the pizza that's toppings are most appealing...or grab a handful of friends and share, then you can try multiple pizzas!The man, who is not a myth, but definitely a legend is often found inside checking in on tables, ensuring quality control and getting to know the patrons. He loved my last Instagram post that did a little play words...sharing that I was on the prosciutt of happiness with his King Henry Classic. He's always all smiles and usually wearing a great hat, he is Paulie Gee himself. Paulie Gee's - High Class to High Lifes If you really knead to get delivery or pickup, you'll have to look elsewhere for now though. The only way to leave Paulie Gee's with a to-go box is with leftovers. Rumor has it that a slice joint is opening up nearby though! I'm counting down the days, hours and minutes. Want to keep drooling? Read the menu!Pro Tip: Grab dinner at Paulie Gee's then walk straight out on the water in Greenpoint to Transmitter park or the outlook. Maybe even catch a sunset and BYO night cap!",5.0
"My old pal Carlos and I visited Paulie Gee's last night and had a great meal. I'm accustomed to going with the ol' vegan girlfriend and have a tradition where we split two pies from their extensive vegan selection, so we can try two different types of pies. The vegan and non-vegan selections are both extensive; each category has at least a half dozen kinds of pies, including oil bases, white slices, marinara, spinach-based, spicy honey and barbecue sauce foundations. The pies are aesthetically pleasing to every sense, well, every sense except sound. It's usually better when sound isn't a factor. At least when you're talking about food. When you're talking about music, sound is obviously a very important sense to talk about. I may go as far as to say that in a conversation about music, sound is the only sense that matters.I was excited to go with Carlos because I was going to get to eat their meat and actual cheese. The Paulie Gee's brisket is lean and delicious. Their pickled red onions possess a truly memorable tang and are worth spending a couple buck to add on to pretty much any pie. The ricotta dollops on the Ricky Ricotta feel more like bursts of a cream sauce than regular old cheese. Interestingly, the dairy and non-dairy ricotta cheeses are almost indecipherable in quality, which goes to show that Paulie Gee's knows what's up. Carlos and I were pleased to compliment the trad Italian flavors of the Ricky Ricotta with a tangy Barbecue Brisket pie. I'm psyched to go with a fellow omnivore again, because there are tons of other flavor combos I'm eager to try. New Yorkers, such as myself, are notorious for being dicks about the quality of pizza dough. It's the dough that invalidates the Chicago Deep Dish's false aspiration to pizza status. I can't stand Sicilian pizza either, which is a controversial take in Nueva York. Anyhow, no matter how well adorned a Paulie Gee's pie is, its base--the crust--is its most distinct and wonderful element. The crust is thin but springy, and always a little charred. It's pretty much naan bread, which is either a very luck coincidence or a visionary innovation. Naan bread, as you know, is lit, and, as it turns out, it is the perfect surface upon which various pizza ingredients should be placed and/or spread to mingle harmoniously.I've visited Paulie Gee's a number of times, and there's a bit of narrative that forms around my visits. The first time I tried to go, it was around noon, and my gf and I made the unpleasant discovery that Paulie Gee's does not open til 5 PM. The next time, we rolled up in a deep crew of six and had to wait about two to three hours for a table for six. If you find yourself in that position, you'll be okay though because there are plenty of bars around. There's also the water/skyline, mere yards away and a nice record store a block away.The gf and I have gone a few other times and it's always been great--except for the one time that a camera crew was shooting a special on Paulie Gee's vegan options. My girlfriend and I were in the shot all throughout our meal, and we were fighting (as subtly as possible) for the duration of our meal. I was taken aback and somewhat miffed when the producers of the show asked to do a talking head with us outside. The tension was palpable but they still insisted on interviewing us. I really do believe that you should foot the bill if you're going to interview someone for your television series or web series or gratuitously long Yelp review or whatever. At LEAST commission me to write a song for the soundtrack.In closing, I would like to offer a lil sum sum for the ladies. Are you interested in grandfatherly, charmingly blue collar, short men whose personalities closely resemble those of most Robert De Niro characters--but only in David O. Russel movies? If you do, and might want to be possibly hit on by a man of this caliber, you will love Paulie Gee's. At all times, Paulie Gee's eponymous Pizza Architect and Entrepreneur, Paulie Gee, stalks the narrow spaces between tables, checking in with customers--particularly of the reasonably attractive female demographic--and asks them how their food is, making small talk and thanking them for their patronage. I think this is cool. I would do the same if I were in his position, so don't take this the wrong way. Central to Paulie Gee's game is his ability to recommend a pizza place in seemingly every zip code on the planet and his inclination to tell you (the lady in question) the name of the dude who works there/owns the place, and to tell you (still the lady in question) to tell the dude (who owns the pizza place) to say that he (Paulie Gee) says hi. The Brotherhood of Pizza Mans is truly alive and well.",5.0

"I almost feel like it's blasphemy for not giving 5 stars. Finally made my way over here at Paulie Gees after way too long. Clearly this place is GPs staple so was excited to drop by on Wednesday night.There was no wait- very good. I had been worried about this so called 3x around 6:45pm to see how long it was before heading over. No one picked up and their answering service basically hangs up on you. I ordered the Daniela and he ordered the brisket pizza. Mine came out a good 7 minutes before his. I noticed immediately that about 40% of the crust was charred to the point of being inedible. To top that off, the spinach topping my pizza was the same. It was literally a black piece of ash and when I picked a leaf up or crumbled in my hands. The cheese blend was very good (mozzarella and Parmesan) but the pizza was just not good. To top it off, parts of the center were soggy and didn't hold the toppings when I grabbed a slice. When the brisket pizza came out a few minutes later I noticed immediately that it was cooked perfectly. The crust was edible and delicious. I was bummed that mine didn't come out this way especially since it seemed like a classic. All I can say is they probably put our orders in together and maybe his needed a little longer in the oven. Mine was most likely getting over cooked while his needed a few more minutes. Hence the gap in time between both of our orders coming out and the reason why mine was half done by the time his came out.I was really disappointed but the good thing to know is at least the brisket pizza was cooked well. I know there is a good meal at Paulie Gees but I feel like we were jipped.Also, great touch that Paulie himself came in to greet all the diners. He was super friendly and it brings a family quality to the place. This is maybe one of the main reasons I'd come back.",3.0
"Delicious!! Definitely made my top 3 favorite pizza  places (the others being robertas and best pizza). We've been meaning to come forever but the line is always so long. We were finally seated right away on a Friday night because we ran over as soon as they opened at 6pm. I would highly recommend this tactic to those of you who have been meaning to come and haven't been able to due to the wait -- the food will be worth it. We ordered the hellboy, ricotta be kidding me and the hot honey ice cream Sunday for dessert. The hellboy was our fave. It was basically a pepperoni pizza with hot honey lined under the cheese. I liked it more than the bees sting from Robertas but both are very good. All in all would highly recommend. As an extra plus Paulie Gee was hanging around today,though it seems like he does this quite often, going from table to table talking to the customers.",5.0
"My husband and I visited Paulie Gee's about two years ago and he still dreams of the Hellboy. This time we ordered the Hellboy and Cherry Jones.  The Hellboy was great but just a touch too sweet for me.  The hot honey adds a little kick but is definitely not too hot.  My husband will tell you it is the best pizza he has ever had (saying a lot since he was raised in the Bronx).  The Cherry Jones on the other hand was way too sweet for both of us.  I couldn't taste anything other then honey.  My husband embarrassed me by telling the waitress we didn't like it.  She offered us a replacement.  We ordered the Ricky Ricotta.  It was alright.  I was shocked because the ricotta was not warm.  The crust at Paulie Gee's is the perfect texture.  However, two of our three pizzas were too charred for my taste.  I must mention Paulie walks around all the tables to make sure everyone is enjoying.  Love it!  The restaurant is too dark and loud for my taste.",3.0
"Interesting decor, super dark inside and it was hard to read the menu. We were seated under one of the speakers, so I felt like an old person complaining about how loud the music was, but really, we came for the food. Split a salad and a Greenpointer pie, and neither disappointed. Both were served quickly, and the pie just exploded with flavor. The lemon kick was strong but not overwhelming, and the crust was perfection. Service was attentive, friendly, and efficient. Lots of menu choices for anything your palate is craving. Overall, a very good experience, and one I would look forward to enjoying again.",4.0

I take my pizza very seriously. The vegan pizza is so good here that if they didn't tell you it was vegan you would have no clue. I had the pie with vegan sausage and shared a few others with friends. It was all out of this world. I can't wait to go back again.,5.0
"There's a LOT of really great pizza in NYC, that's nothing new. But combine amazing pizza with friendly, caring service and a killer ambiance, and Paulie Gee's has a leg up on a lot of the other heavy hitters. The wait can be crazy, but we came in on a Tuesday night and it was half empty. I guess the key is to come when there's post-blizzard sludge everywhere and no one else wants to go out. Paulie Gee was there as I'm told he usually is, weaving around the space with his cup of coffee and stopping at literally every table. For us, he offered to curate our pizza order and who were we to argue? Read on for what Paulie Gee himself recommends:- The Greenpointer: according to Paulie, basically like eating a salad due to the piles of fresh baby arugula on top. - The Mo Cheeks: My personal favorite of the meal. The pickled onions on there are a nice surprise, and give a nice kick to the rest of the ingredients. - The Monte Cristo: OK, so this is probably something I would never think to order myself, but I'm glad it came out for us because it's actually super tasty. It comes with Canadian bacon and a drizzle of maple syrup, which I know sounds weird but trust me (or rather, trust Paulie). - I didn't catch the name of the last pizza, but it was one of the best and after peeking at the menu again I think it might have been the Hellboy. It was piled high with the tastiest Berkshire Sopressata, and it was perfect with the side of Mike's hot honey (which you haven't tried on pizza you must immediately). They asked if we wanted a dessert pizza but at that point we were stuffed to the gills. It was one of the best New York pizza experiences I've had so far, and the service is what really puts them above and beyond. I'm going to run for vice-president of the Paulie Gee fanclub soon!",5.0

It was OK, not that memorable. The standout is by far Hellboy, the crust for both pizzas was SUPER THIN, firm and didn't fall apart on me. We both liked it.

My friend wanted to celebrate her belated birthday at Paulie Gee's and so we did. We ordered 3 pies (Greenpointer, Ricotta Be Kidding Me, and The Hometown Brisket). I think the Hometown Brisket was our favorite only because of the BBQ sauce. Other than that, there wasn't much brisket pieces on the pizza. Ricotta Be Kidding Me was okay. The Greenpointer was all greens so that balanced our meal a little bit. I hear people waiting for hours to get a seat here and right now I'm just wondering where all the hype went? We came when they were opening, so thank goodness we didn't wait on line for this...cause it wouldn't have been worth it. FYI: There's no sign outside that says ""Paulie Gee's"".

"My old pal Carlos and I visited Paulie Gee's last night and had a great meal. I'm accustomed to going with the ol' vegan girlfriend and have a tradition where we split two pies from their extensive vegan selection, so we can try two different types of pies. The vegan and non-vegan selections are both extensive; each category has at least a half dozen kinds of pies, including oil bases, white slices, marinara, spinach-based, spicy honey and barbecue sauce foundations. The pies are aesthetically pleasing to every sense, well, every sense except sound. It's usually better when sound isn't a factor. At least when you're talking about food. When you're talking about music, sound is obviously a very important sense to talk about. I may go as far as to say that in a conversation about music, sound is the only sense that matters.I was excited to go with Carlos because I was going to get to eat their meat and actual cheese. The Paulie Gee's brisket is lean and delicious. Their pickled red onions possess a truly memorable tang and are worth spending a couple buck to add on to pretty much any pie. The ricotta dollops on the Ricky Ricotta feel more like bursts of a cream sauce than regular old cheese. Interestingly, the dairy and non-dairy ricotta cheeses are almost indecipherable in quality, which goes to show that Paulie Gee's knows what's up. Carlos and I were pleased to compliment the trad Italian flavors of the Ricky Ricotta with a tangy Barbecue Brisket pie. I'm psyched to go with a fellow omnivore again, because there are tons of other flavor combos I'm eager to try. New Yorkers, such as myself, are notorious for being dicks about the quality of pizza dough. It's the dough that invalidates the Chicago Deep Dish's false aspiration to pizza status. I can't stand Sicilian pizza either, which is a controversial take in Nueva York. Anyhow, no matter how well adorned a Paulie Gee's pie is, its base--the crust--is its most distinct and wonderful element. The crust is thin but springy, and always a little charred. It's pretty much naan bread, which is either a very luck coincidence or a visionary innovation. Naan bread, as you know, is lit, and, as it turns out, it is the perfect surface upon which various pizza ingredients should be placed and/or spread to mingle harmoniously.I've visited Paulie Gee's a number of times, and there's a bit of narrative that forms around my visits. The first time I tried to go, it was around noon, and my gf and I made the unpleasant discovery that Paulie Gee's does not open til 5 PM. The next time, we rolled up in a deep crew of six and had to wait about two to three hours for a table for six. If you find yourself in that position, you'll be okay though because there are plenty of bars around. There's also the water/skyline, mere yards away and a nice record store a block away.The gf and I have gone a few other times and it's always been great--except for the one time that a camera crew was shooting a special on Paulie Gee's vegan options. My girlfriend and I were in the shot all throughout our meal, and we were fighting (as subtly as possible) for the duration of our meal. I was taken aback and somewhat miffed when the producers of the show asked to do a talking head with us outside. The tension was palpable but they still insisted on interviewing us. I really do believe that you should foot the bill if you're going to interview someone for your television series or web series or gratuitously long Yelp review or whatever. At LEAST commission me to write a song for the soundtrack.In closing, I would like to offer a lil sum sum for the ladies. Are you interested in grandfatherly, charmingly blue collar, short men whose personalities closely resemble those of most Robert De Niro characters--but only in David O. Russel movies? If you do, and might want to be possibly hit on by a man of this caliber, you will love Paulie Gee's. At all times, Paulie Gee's eponymous Pizza Architect and Entrepreneur, Paulie Gee, stalks the narrow spaces between tables, checking in with customers--particularly of the reasonably attractive female demographic--and asks them how their food is, making small talk and thanking them for their patronage. I think this is cool. I would do the same if I were in his position, so don't take this the wrong way. Central to Paulie Gee's game is his ability to recommend a pizza place in seemingly every zip code on the planet and his inclination to tell you (the lady in question) the name of the dude who works there/owns the place, and to tell you (still the lady in question) to tell the dude (who owns the pizza place) to say that he (Paulie Gee) says hi. The Brotherhood of Pizza Mans is truly alive and well.",5.0

"I almost feel like it's blasphemy for not giving 5 stars. Finally made my way over here at Paulie Gees after way too long. Clearly this place is GPs staple so was excited to drop by on Wednesday night.There was no wait- very good. I had been worried about this so called 3x around 6:45pm to see how long it was before heading over. No one picked up and their answering service basically hangs up on you. I ordered the Daniela and he ordered the brisket pizza. Mine came out a good 7 minutes before his. I noticed immediately that about 40% of the crust was charred to the point of being inedible. To top that off, the spinach topping my pizza was the same. It was literally a black piece of ash and when I picked a leaf up or crumbled in my hands. The cheese blend was very good (mozzarella and Parmesan) but the pizza was just not good. To top it off, parts of the center were soggy and didn't hold the toppings when I grabbed a slice. When the brisket pizza came out a few minutes later I noticed immediately that it was cooked perfectly. The crust was edible and delicious. I was bummed that mine didn't come out this way especially since it seemed like a classic. All I can say is they probably put our orders in together and maybe his needed a little longer in the oven. Mine was most likely getting over cooked while his needed a few more minutes. Hence the gap in time between both of our orders coming out and the reason why mine was half done by the time his came out.I was really disappointed but the good thing to know is at least the brisket pizza was cooked well. I know there is a good meal at Paulie Gees but I feel like we were jipped.Also, great touch that Paulie himself came in to greet all the diners. He was super friendly and it brings a family quality to the place. This is maybe one of the main reasons I'd come back.",3.0
"Delicious!! Definitely made my top 3 favorite pizza  places (the others being robertas and best pizza). We've been meaning to come forever but the line is always so long. We were finally seated right away on a Friday night because we ran over as soon as they opened at 6pm. I would highly recommend this tactic to those of you who have been meaning to come and haven't been able to due to the wait -- the food will be worth it. We ordered the hellboy, ricotta be kidding me and the hot honey ice cream Sunday for dessert. The hellboy was our fave. It was basically a pepperoni pizza with hot honey lined under the cheese. I liked it more than the bees sting from Robertas but both are very good. All in all would highly recommend. As an extra plus Paulie Gee was hanging around today,though it seems like he does this quite often, going from table to table talking to the customers.",5.0
"My husband and I visited Paulie Gee's about two years ago and he still dreams of the Hellboy. This time we ordered the Hellboy and Cherry Jones.  The Hellboy was great but just a touch too sweet for me.  The hot honey adds a little kick but is definitely not too hot.  My husband will tell you it is the best pizza he has ever had (saying a lot since he was raised in the Bronx).  The Cherry Jones on the other hand was way too sweet for both of us.  I couldn't taste anything other then honey.  My husband embarrassed me by telling the waitress we didn't like it.  She offered us a replacement.  We ordered the Ricky Ricotta.  It was alright.  I was shocked because the ricotta was not warm.  The crust at Paulie Gee's is the perfect texture.  However, two of our three pizzas were too charred for my taste.  I must mention Paulie walks around all the tables to make sure everyone is enjoying.  Love it!  The restaurant is too dark and loud for my taste.",3.0
"Interesting decor, super dark inside and it was hard to read the menu. We were seated under one of the speakers, so I felt like an old person complaining about how loud the music was, but really, we came for the food. Split a salad and a Greenpointer pie, and neither disappointed. Both were served quickly, and the pie just exploded with flavor. The lemon kick was strong but not overwhelming, and the crust was perfection. Service was attentive, friendly, and efficient. Lots of menu choices for anything your palate is craving. Overall, a very good experience, and one I would look forward to enjoying again.",4.0
"New York probably takes its pizza more seriously than anywhere else in the world.  I'm sure there are 7 or 8 people reading this right now that would be willing to shiv a guy for saying something bad about their favorite slice.  With that in mind, Paulie Gee's is a pizza lover's pizza place.  They make Neapolitan style pizzas with an oven shipped in from Naples and lovingly reassembled by small, Italian elves.  From this oven, comes perfectly leopard-spotted pizzas with just the right amount of bouncy chewy dough.To top the pizza, there's a lovingly curated selection to choose from so don't you dare ask for substitutions.  Lucky for you whether you're a vegan, vegetarian, white/red pie lover, averse to spice, meat lover, or whatever!  There's at least one pie on the menu* that will make you say, ""hmmm..."".  My personal favorites are the Mo' Cheeks ($16, has guanciale and is perfect with the pickled onions) and Ricotta Be Kidding Me ($17, with tons of meat topped with adorable dollops of cottage cheese).  I've only ever had 1 pizza there that wasn't stellar and I won't tell you which one because you'll definitely judge me for choosing it in the first place.The atmosphere at Paulie Gee's is great.  It's quintessential Brooklyn.  Think dark unfinished wood walls with an eclectic collection of tables made from reclaimed wood, music consisting of a mixture of jazz, rock, and anything but top 40s.  What always makes my night is that the ACTUAL Paulie Gee walks around and talks to EVERYONE.  It doesn't matter if Keri Russell** is sitting right next to you, he will still come by and have a 5-20 minute conversation with you and your table.  My only complaint is how popular this place is.  They've stopped making pizzas to go and still, the wait is crazy.  I've never been able to get a table in less than 45 minutes unless it was late at night.  I guess that's not a bad problem to have.  I also kind of wish they would get a full liquor license and take that creative pizza combo creating mind into the cocktail realm.  I mean...Mike's Hot Honey + Whiskey?  Maybe?---------* If you can't find a pizza you like on the printed menu in the restaurant, whip out the smartphone and check out the ""secret"" menu on the website.** This actually happened.",4.0
"We've literally flown across the country to enjoy his pizza. It's that good! Walking in, the aroma of pizza cooking in a brick oven hits your nose.This is about time my stomach starts to growl. The vibe is flowing with positive energy, and the low lighting is flattering & sexy. The bar to the left is where you can order a beverage while you wait.  They have a decent beer selection. Wait times vary, but it's usually not as long as anticipated, and well worth the effort.Everyone, including the servers, seem happy to be there.Paulie Gee is the utmost host. He's always found time to come to our table with suggestions, stories, and the occasional limoncello, (his recipe of the celebratory cocktail).Talking with him, I've gathered that he makes the vegan pizza for the people, or demand for it, but he didn't seem interested in the cause.

"Absolutely delicious. Huge selection of pies - good for meatatarians, vegetarians, and even vegans. Wood fire oven delivers the signature light smoke and char. Dough is absolutely tender and springy. They even let the pizza rest afterwards so the cheese sets and you don't burn the crap out of your mouth.Hellboy- spicy pepperoni with hot honey. Absolute classic pizza. Hot honey perfectly blankets the spicy meat. Super simple, absolutely delicious. Get two, trust meRicotta/sausage pie - similar to one above, hot honey included.

"One of the challenges of  being vegan is getting your friends/family to be open to the idea of trying vegan food.I have never had Vegan Pizza before and I usually try to try a restaurant first before recommending to anyone especially a non vegan but I took a chance.When we first arrived we were having trouble picking something since everything was foreign to us. Someone sitting next to us saw our struggle and took us to try the  IN Ricotta Da Vegan so we did. AMAZING!! My non vegan date was impressed and I was so happy.Thanks Paulie Gee for making me looking good Whew! One pie (6 small slices) goes for 16 bucks .

"Some of the best za in the city, bar none. The lady and I traveled far and wide for it since we'd heard such great things. It was a Friday night so the restaurant was predictably packed. There's not much in the form of a waiting area, which particularly sucked given how freezing the weather was, but we had a feeling the pie would be well worth the wait (plus we also got to watch a tipsy couple aggressively suck face up close and personal which was an unexpected but enjoyable twist).The vibe was cool, featuring low--lighting, a huge and beautiful custom brick oven, and trendy attractive people who's favorite bands you've never heard of.When we finally were seated I was stoked to see the menu offered a huge variety of pies with all sorts of niche toppings AND vegan options(I personally don't give two damns about veganism but they presented them in an unpretentious way so I was cool with it). We eventually decided to go with the Hell Boy and the Prokypineapple, both of which were amazing, and I'm looking forward to going back and further chowing my way down the menu.Go here.",5.0
"After a 2-hours wait on a weekend for a party of 2, we finally got a table at the renowned pizza shop in Brooklyn. After having one of the best pizzas of all time at Little Isabella located in Baltimore, I was on the mission to find its companion in NYC. Overhyped as we suspected, Paulie Gee had nothing on Little Isabella! Perhaps, it was the quirky blend of sweet and savory flavors, but with that 2-hour wait, we surely did not have a pleasing experience.We ordered two pies: HellBoy and Greenpointer. HellBoy: Fresh Mozzarella, Italian Tomatoes, Berkshire Sopressata Piccante, Parmigiano Reggiano and Mike's HOT HoneyGreenpointer:Fresh Mozzarella, Baby Arugula, Olive Oil, Fresh Lemon Juice and Shaved Parmigiano ReggianoWe didn't really enjoy the sweetness of the honey in the HellBoy or the sourness of the lemon juice in the Greenpointer. Fresh, as we saw them make each pie to order, I definitely thought the doughiness of the pizza wasn't anything spectacular. In terms of service, I think it was pretty solid. Our waiter was patient and helpful. As a surprise, Paulie Gee himself introduced himself to just about every table, making it feel quite personable. In all, I definitely wouldn't return back to this pizzeria, especially with that crazy wait.

"My old pal Carlos and I visited Paulie Gee's last night and had a great meal. I'm accustomed to going with the ol' vegan girlfriend and have a tradition where we split two pies from their extensive vegan selection, so we can try two different types of pies. The vegan and non-vegan selections are both extensive; each category has at least a half dozen kinds of pies, including oil bases, white slices, marinara, spinach-based, spicy honey and barbecue sauce foundations. The pies are aesthetically pleasing to every sense, well, every sense except sound. It's usually better when sound isn't a factor. At least when you're talking about food. When you're talking about music, sound is obviously a very important sense to talk about. I may go as far as to say that in a conversation about music, sound is the only sense that matters.I was excited to go with Carlos because I was going to get to eat their meat and actual cheese. The Paulie Gee's brisket is lean and delicious. Their pickled red onions possess a truly memorable tang and are worth spending a couple buck to add on to pretty much any pie. The ricotta dollops on the Ricky Ricotta feel more like bursts of a cream sauce than regular old cheese. Interestingly, the dairy and non-dairy ricotta cheeses are almost indecipherable in quality, which goes to show that Paulie Gee's knows what's up. Carlos and I were pleased to compliment the trad Italian flavors of the Ricky Ricotta with a tangy Barbecue Brisket pie. I'm psyched to go with a fellow omnivore again, because there are tons of other flavor combos I'm eager to try. New Yorkers, such as myself, are notorious for being dicks about the quality of pizza dough. It's the dough that invalidates the Chicago Deep Dish's false aspiration to pizza status. I can't stand Sicilian pizza either, which is a controversial take in Nueva York. Anyhow, no matter how well adorned a Paulie Gee's pie is, its base--the crust--is its most distinct and wonderful element. The crust is thin but springy, and always a little charred. It's pretty much naan bread, which is either a very luck coincidence or a visionary innovation. Naan bread, as you know, is lit, and, as it turns out, it is the perfect surface upon which various pizza ingredients should be placed and/or spread to mingle harmoniously.I've visited Paulie Gee's a number of times, and there's a bit of narrative that forms around my visits. The first time I tried to go, it was around noon, and my gf and I made the unpleasant discovery that Paulie Gee's does not open til 5 PM. The next time, we rolled up in a deep crew of six and had to wait about two to three hours for a table for six. If you find yourself in that position, you'll be okay though because there are plenty of bars around. There's also the water/skyline, mere yards away and a nice record store a block away.The gf and I have gone a few other times and it's always been great--except for the one time that a camera crew was shooting a special on Paulie Gee's vegan options. My girlfriend and I were in the shot all throughout our meal, and we were fighting (as subtly as possible) for the duration of our meal. I was taken aback and somewhat miffed when the producers of the show asked to do a talking head with us outside. The tension was palpable but they still insisted on interviewing us. I really do believe that you should foot the bill if you're going to interview someone for your television series or web series or gratuitously long Yelp review or whatever.

"I almost feel like it's blasphemy for not giving 5 stars. Finally made my way over here at Paulie Gees after way too long. Clearly this place is GPs staple so was excited to drop by on Wednesday night.There was no wait- very good. I had been worried about this so called 3x around 6:45pm to see how long it was before heading over. No one picked up and their answering service basically hangs up on you. I ordered the Daniela and he ordered the brisket pizza. Mine came out a good 7 minutes before his. I noticed immediately that about 40% of the crust was charred to the point of being inedible. To top that off, the spinach topping my pizza was the same. It was literally a black piece of ash and when I picked a leaf up or crumbled in my hands. The cheese blend was very good (mozzarella and Parmesan) but the pizza was just not good. To top it off, parts of the center were soggy and didn't hold the toppings when I grabbed a slice. When the brisket pizza came out a few minutes later I noticed immediately that it was cooked perfectly. The crust was edible and delicious. I was bummed that mine didn't come out this way especially since it seemed like a classic. All I can say is they probably put our orders in together and maybe his needed a little longer in the oven. Mine was most likely getting over cooked while his needed a few more minutes. Hence the gap in time between both of our orders coming out and the reason why mine was half done by the time his came out.I was really disappointed but the good thing to know is at least the brisket pizza was cooked well. I know there is a good meal at Paulie Gees but I feel like we were jipped.Also, great touch that Paulie himself came in to greet all the diners. He was super friendly and it brings a family quality to the place. This is maybe one of the main reasons I'd come back.",3.0
"Delicious!! Definitely made my top 3 favorite pizza  places (the others being robertas and best pizza). We've been meaning to come forever but the line is always so long. We were finally seated right away on a Friday night because we ran over as soon as they opened at 6pm. I would highly recommend this tactic to those of you who have been meaning to come and haven't been able to due to the wait -- the food will be worth it. We ordered the hellboy, ricotta be kidding me and the hot honey ice cream Sunday for dessert. The hellboy was our fave. It was basically a pepperoni pizza with hot honey lined under the cheese. I liked it more than the bees sting from Robertas but both are very good. All in all would highly recommend. As an extra plus Paulie Gee was hanging around today,though it seems like he does this quite often, going from table to table talking to the customers.",5.0
"My husband and I visited Paulie Gee's about two years ago and he still dreams of the Hellboy. This time we ordered the Hellboy and Cherry Jones.  The Hellboy was great but just a touch too sweet for me.  The hot honey adds a little kick but is definitely not too hot.  My husband will tell you it is the best pizza he has ever had (saying a lot since he was raised in the Bronx).  The Cherry Jones on the other hand was way too sweet for both of us.  I couldn't taste anything other then honey.  My husband embarrassed me by telling the waitress we didn't like it.  She offered us a replacement.  We ordered the Ricky Ricotta.  It was alright.  I was shocked because the ricotta was not warm.  The crust at Paulie Gee's is the perfect texture.  However, two of our three pizzas were too charred for my taste.  I must mention Paulie walks around all the tables to make sure everyone is enjoying.  Love it!  The restaurant is too dark and loud for my taste.",3.0
"Interesting decor, super dark inside and it was hard to read the menu. We were seated under one of the speakers, so I felt like an old person complaining about how loud the music was, but really, we came for the food. Split a salad and a Greenpointer pie, and neither disappointed. Both were served quickly, and the pie just exploded with flavor. The lemon kick was strong but not overwhelming, and the crust was perfection. Service was attentive, friendly, and efficient. Lots of menu choices for anything your palate is craving. Overall, a very good experience, and one I would look forward to enjoying again.",4.0
"New York probably takes its pizza more seriously than anywhere else in the world.  I'm sure there are 7 or 8 people reading this right now that would be willing to shiv a guy for saying something bad about their favorite slice.  With that in mind, Paulie Gee's is a pizza lover's pizza place.  They make Neapolitan style pizzas with an oven shipped in from Naples and lovingly reassembled by small, Italian elves.  From this oven, comes perfectly leopard-spotted pizzas with just the right amount of bouncy chewy dough.To top the pizza, there's a lovingly curated selection to choose from so don't you dare ask for substitutions.  Lucky for you whether you're a vegan, vegetarian, white/red pie lover, averse to spice, meat lover, or whatever!  There's at least one pie on the menu* that will make you say, ""hmmm..."".  My personal favorites are the Mo' Cheeks ($16, has guanciale and is perfect with the pickled onions) and Ricotta Be Kidding Me ($17, with tons of meat topped with adorable dollops of cottage cheese).  I've only ever had 1 pizza there that wasn't stellar and I won't tell you which one because you'll definitely judge me for choosing it in the first place.The atmosphere at Paulie Gee's is great.  It's quintessential Brooklyn.  Think dark unfinished wood walls with an eclectic collection of tables made from reclaimed wood, music consisting of a mixture of jazz, rock, and anything but top 40s.  What always makes my night is that the ACTUAL Paulie Gee walks around and talks to EVERYONE.  It doesn't matter if Keri Russell** is sitting right next to you, he will still come by and have a 5-20 minute conversation with you and your table.  My only complaint is how popular this place is.  They've stopped making pizzas to go and still, the wait is crazy.  I've never been able to get a table in less than 45 minutes unless it was late at night.  I guess that's not a bad problem to have.  I also kind of wish they would get a full liquor license and take that creative pizza combo creating mind into the cocktail realm.  I mean...Mike's Hot Honey + Whiskey?  Maybe?---------* If you can't find a pizza you like on the printed menu in the restaurant, whip out the smartphone and check out the ""secret"" menu on the website.** This actually happened.",4.0
"We've literally flown across the country to enjoy his pizza. It's that good! Walking in, the aroma of pizza cooking in a brick oven hits your nose.This is about time my stomach starts to growl. The vibe is flowing with positive energy, and the low lighting is flattering & sexy. The bar to the left is where you can order a beverage while you wait.  They have a decent beer selection. Wait times vary, but it's usually not as long as anticipated, and well worth the effort.Everyone, including the servers, seem happy to be there.Paulie Gee is the utmost host. He's always found time to come to our table with suggestions, stories, and the occasional limoncello, (his recipe of the celebratory cocktail).Talking with him, I've gathered that he makes the vegan pizza for the people, or demand for it, but he didn't seem interested in the cause. The funky bathrooms can be a challenge to use when you've had one too many! VEGAN Pies we LOVE Simply RedVegan Tomato Sauce with Tomatoes, Olive Oil. Vidalia Onions, Garlic, Basil, Salt and PepperVegan Daniela SpinaciBaby Spinach, Olive Oil, Fresh Sliced Garlic, Mild Aleppo Chili Oil and Sea SaltIn Ricotta Da VeganVegan Tomato Sauce, House Made Vegan Sausage, Post-oven House Made Cashew Ricotta Dollops, Baby Arugula and Extra Virgin Olive OilWith many return visits, we've yet to have a negative experience.There has been noise over the years of Paulie Giannone opening a Portland outpost, but it has yet to materialize. Meanwhile, I'll dream of his pizza.",5.0
"Absolutely delicious. Huge selection of pies - good for meatatarians, vegetarians, and even vegans. Wood fire oven delivers the signature light smoke and char. Dough is absolutely tender and springy. They even let the pizza rest afterwards so the cheese sets and you don't burn the crap out of your mouth.Hellboy- spicy pepperoni with hot honey. Absolute classic pizza. Hot honey perfectly blankets the spicy meat. Super simple, absolutely delicious. Get two, trust meRicotta/sausage pie - similar to one above, hot honey included. However ricotta and sausage are a welcome addition. While chunks of roasted garlic are an excellent accentSo many other pies, go try them for yourself.Big lines, put your name down and go drink at browerij lane.

"One of the challenges of  being vegan is getting your friends/family to be open to the idea of trying vegan food.I have never had Vegan Pizza before and I usually try to try a restaurant first before recommending to anyone especially a non vegan but I took a chance.When we first arrived we were having trouble picking something since everything was foreign to us. Someone sitting next to us saw our struggle and took us to try the  IN Ricotta Da Vegan so we did. AMAZING!! My non vegan date was impressed and I was so happy.Thanks Paulie Gee for making me looking good Whew! One pie (6 small slices) goes for 16 bucks . Its small, nice ambiance I would say its a little darkI would go again!Menu like here ------ pauliegee.com/greenpoint… xoxoC.",4.0
"Some of the best za in the city, bar none. The lady and I traveled far and wide for it since we'd heard such great things. It was a Friday night so the restaurant was predictably packed. There's not much in the form of a waiting area, which particularly sucked given how freezing the weather was, but we had a feeling the pie would be well worth the wait (plus we also got to watch a tipsy couple aggressively suck face up close and personal which was an unexpected but enjoyable twist).The vibe was cool, featuring low--lighting, a huge and beautiful custom brick oven, and trendy attractive people who's favorite bands you've never heard of.When we finally were seated I was stoked to see the menu offered a huge variety of pies with all sorts of niche toppings AND vegan options(I personally don't give two damns about veganism but they presented them in an unpretentious way so I was cool with it). We eventually decided to go with the Hell Boy and the Prokypineapple, both of which were amazing, and I'm looking forward to going back and further chowing my way down the menu.Go here.",5.0
"After a 2-hours wait on a weekend for a party of 2, we finally got a table at the renowned pizza shop in Brooklyn. After having one of the best pizzas of all time at Little Isabella located in Baltimore, I was on the mission to find its companion in NYC. Overhyped as we suspected, Paulie Gee had nothing on Little Isabella! Perhaps, it was the quirky blend of sweet and savory flavors, but with that 2-hour wait, we surely did not have a pleasing experience.We ordered two pies: HellBoy and Greenpointer. HellBoy: Fresh Mozzarella, Italian Tomatoes, Berkshire Sopressata Piccante, Parmigiano Reggiano and Mike's HOT HoneyGreenpointer:Fresh Mozzarella, Baby Arugula, Olive Oil, Fresh Lemon Juice and Shaved Parmigiano ReggianoWe didn't really enjoy the sweetness of the honey in the HellBoy or the sourness of the lemon juice in the Greenpointer. Fresh, as we saw them make each pie to order, I definitely thought the doughiness of the pizza wasn't anything spectacular. In terms of service, I think it was pretty solid. Our waiter was patient and helpful. As a surprise, Paulie Gee himself introduced himself to just about every table, making it feel quite personable. In all, I definitely wouldn't return back to this pizzeria, especially with that crazy wait. During that 2-hour wait and 1.5-hour dining time, I can drive down to Baltimore and get some Little Isabella for half the price and no wait!",3.0
"3.5 stars for this pizza joint hidden behind a HUGE wooden door all the way down Franklin streetCrust was good with a nice char on the hellboy but the crust of the greenpoint pizza seemed a bit underdone We were quoted a 1.5 hour wait at 8pm for 3 on a Saturday but we were lucky that people in front of us hadn't returned so we were seated right away! (so don't be discouraged)---hellboy: everything was good about this except that spicy honey! Should of gone with a more classic margherita style pizza instead---greenpoint: fresh arugula, with a bit too much lemon juice, so nothing special NOTE: they don't have pepper flakes, only chili oil",4.0
"If you want great pizza and the right atmosphere look no further than Paulie Gee's. We sat at the bar (luckily) and avoided a two hour wait.  The pizza choices are numerous, with some very creative options. There were three of us and we started with two pies. Would have been content but it was so good we ordered a third.The texture. The crust. The toppings. Hard pressed to mention anything I didn't like. I love pizza and this place is right up there with the best. That includes many pizzerias throughout Italy.Paulie stopped by for a chat and he has a fantastic personality. Great stories and it is obvious that he loves what he does and holds him team to very high standards.He was also kind enough to give me an official Paulie Gee's pin and a limoncello. A very nice touch!Make sure you check out the pizza oven in the back. It's a small,cozy place so don't pass this place up in you are in NY.",5.0
I take my pizza very seriously. The vegan pizza is so good here that if they didn't tell you it was vegan you would have no clue. I had the pie with vegan sausage and shared a few others with friends. It was all out of this world. I can't wait to go back again.,5.0
"There's a LOT of really great pizza in NYC, that's nothing new. But combine amazing pizza with friendly, caring service and a killer ambiance, and Paulie Gee's has a leg up on a lot of the other heavy hitters. The wait can be crazy, but we came in on a Tuesday night and it was half empty. I guess the key is to come when there's post-blizzard sludge everywhere and no one else wants to go out. Paulie Gee was there as I'm told he usually is, weaving around the space with his cup of coffee and stopping at literally every table. For us, he offered to curate our pizza order and who were we to argue? Read on for what Paulie Gee himself recommends:- The Greenpointer: according to Paulie, basically like eating a salad due to the piles of fresh baby arugula on top. - The Mo Cheeks: My personal favorite of the meal. The pickled onions on there are a nice surprise, and give a nice kick to the rest of the ingredients. - The Monte Cristo: OK, so this is probably something I would never think to order myself, but I'm glad it came out for us because it's actually super tasty. It comes with Canadian bacon and a drizzle of maple syrup, which I know sounds weird but trust me (or rather, trust Paulie). - I didn't catch the name of the last pizza, but it was one of the best and after peeking at the menu again I think it might have been the Hellboy. It was piled high with the tastiest Berkshire Sopressata, and it was perfect with the side of Mike's hot honey (which you haven't tried on pizza you must immediately). They asked if we wanted a dessert pizza but at that point we were stuffed to the gills. It was one of the best New York pizza experiences I've had so far, and the service is what really puts them above and beyond. I'm going to run for vice-president of the Paulie Gee fanclub soon!",5.0
"Came here a few days ago with my friend after work. Very dark inside, took some time for my eyeballs to adjust lol. We started off with some beers and then went with the Hellboy which was AMAZING. The hot honey makes a difference! Then we went with a vegan pie since neither one of us was particularly full. We ordered one with spinach, sea salt and garlic on it (sorry don't remember the name!) It was OK, not that memorable. The standout is by far Hellboy, the crust for both pizzas was SUPER THIN, firm and didn't fall apart on me. We both liked it. I took off a star for the spinach pie being nothing special and that it's a bit on the pricey side. Overall, I think I'll be back to try the other pizzas on the menu!",4.0
"Maybe we came on an off night, but we didn't care too much about the pizza and it was definitely not the best we've had. My friend wanted to celebrate her belated birthday at Paulie Gee's and so we did. We ordered 3 pies (Greenpointer, Ricotta Be Kidding Me, and The Hometown Brisket). I think the Hometown Brisket was our favorite only because of the BBQ sauce. Other than that, there wasn't much brisket pieces on the pizza. Ricotta Be Kidding Me was okay. The Greenpointer was all greens so that balanced our meal a little bit. I hear people waiting for hours to get a seat here and right now I'm just wondering where all the hype went? We came when they were opening, so thank goodness we didn't wait on line for this...cause it wouldn't have been worth it. FYI: There's no sign outside that says ""Paulie Gee's"". You just have to look by the address number ""60"" in order to find this place. I actually walked passed it while we were trying to find it. Also, use your flash on your phones to read the menu. I really liked the rustic interior but it was literally pitch black in there.",3.0
"Zagat rated the hellboy as the best pizza in NYC. Wow! Big call Zagat... We had to try! We would say it was delicious... But I would have to say Marta is equal of not just ahead. We got here at 6:40 and had to wait over an hr to sit at the bar. When getting here service was prompt and food was great! We ordered the hellboy and the hellified porkpie white and I have to say it was fresh, full of flavor and great value. My only critique would be more hot suppressa on the hellified and take numbers at the door! It's a little unreasonable to ask people to wait 90 mins and not offer to call when table it ready. Either way it was great but probably won't be crossing the river to wait another 90 mins.",4.0

I would highly recommend this tactic to those of you who have been meaning to come and haven't been able to due to the wait -- the food will be worth it. We ordered the hellboy, ricotta be kidding me and the hot honey ice cream Sunday for dessert. The hellboy was our fave. It was basically a pepperoni pizza with hot honey lined under the cheese.

"My husband and I visited Paulie Gee's about two years ago and he still dreams of the Hellboy. This time we ordered the Hellboy and Cherry Jones.  The Hellboy was great but just a touch too sweet for me.  The hot honey adds a little kick but is definitely not too hot.  My husband will tell you it is the best pizza he has ever had (saying a lot since he was raised in the Bronx).  The Cherry Jones on the other hand was way too sweet for both of us.  I couldn't taste anything other then honey.  My husband embarrassed me by telling the waitress we didn't like it.  She offered us a replacement.  We ordered the Ricky Ricotta.  It was alright.  I was shocked because the ricotta was not warm.  The crust at Paulie Gee's is the perfect texture.  However, two of our three pizzas were too charred for my taste.  I must mention Paulie walks around all the tables to make sure everyone is enjoying.  Love it!  The restaurant is too dark and loud for my taste.",3.0

"Some of the best za in the city, bar none. The lady and I traveled far and wide for it since we'd heard such great things. It was a Friday night so the restaurant was predictably packed. There's not much in the form of a waiting area, which particularly sucked given how freezing the weather was, but we had a feeling the pie would be well worth the wait (plus we also got to watch a tipsy couple aggressively suck face up close and personal which was an unexpected but enjoyable twist).The vibe was cool, featuring low--lighting, a huge and beautiful custom brick oven, and trendy attractive people who's favorite bands you've never heard of.When we finally were seated I was stoked to see the menu offered a huge variety of pies with all sorts of niche toppings AND vegan options(I personally don't give two damns about veganism but they presented them in an unpretentious way so I was cool with it). We eventually decided to go with the Hell Boy and the Prokypineapple, both of which were amazing, and I'm looking forward to going back and further chowing my way down the menu.Go here.",5.0
"After a 2-hours wait on a weekend for a party of 2, we finally got a table at the renowned pizza shop in Brooklyn. After having one of the best pizzas of all time at Little Isabella located in Baltimore, I was on the mission to find its companion in NYC. Overhyped as we suspected, Paulie Gee had nothing on Little Isabella! Perhaps, it was the quirky blend of sweet and savory flavors, but with that 2-hour wait, we surely did not have a pleasing experience.We ordered two pies: HellBoy and Greenpointer. HellBoy: Fresh Mozzarella, Italian Tomatoes, Berkshire Sopressata Piccante, Parmigiano Reggiano and Mike's HOT HoneyGreenpointer:Fresh Mozzarella, Baby Arugula, Olive Oil, Fresh Lemon Juice and Shaved Parmigiano ReggianoWe didn't really enjoy the sweetness of the honey in the HellBoy or the sourness of the lemon juice in the Greenpointer. Fresh, as we saw them make each pie to order, I definitely thought the doughiness of the pizza wasn't anything spectacular. In terms of service, I think it was pretty solid. Our waiter was patient and helpful. As a surprise, Paulie Gee himself introduced himself to just about every table, making it feel quite personable. In all, I definitely wouldn't return back to this pizzeria, especially with that crazy wait. During that 2-hour wait and 1.5-hour dining time, I can drive down to Baltimore and get some Little Isabella for half the price and no wait!",3.0
"3.5 stars for this pizza joint hidden behind a HUGE wooden door all the way down Franklin streetCrust was good with a nice char on the hellboy but the crust of the greenpoint pizza seemed a bit underdone We were quoted a 1.5 hour wait at 8pm for 3 on a Saturday but we were lucky that people in front of us hadn't returned so we were seated right away! (so don't be discouraged)---hellboy: everything was good about this except that spicy honey! Should of gone with a more classic margherita style pizza instead---greenpoint: fresh arugula, with a bit too much lemon juice, so nothing special NOTE: they don't have pepper flakes, only chili oil",4.0
"If you want great pizza and the right atmosphere look no further than Paulie Gee's. We sat at the bar (luckily) and avoided a two hour wait.  The pizza choices are numerous, with some very creative options. There were three of us and we started with two pies. Would have been content but it was so good we ordered a third.The texture. The crust. The toppings. Hard pressed to mention anything I didn't like. I love pizza and this place is right up there with the best. That includes many pizzerias throughout Italy.Paulie stopped by for a chat and he has a fantastic personality. Great stories and it is obvious that he loves what he does and holds him team to very high standards.He was also kind enough to give me an official Paulie Gee's pin and a limoncello. A very nice touch!Make sure you check out the pizza oven in the back. It's a small,cozy place so don't pass this place up in you are in NY.",5.0
I take my pizza very seriously. The vegan pizza is so good here that if they didn't tell you it was vegan you would have no clue. I had the pie with vegan sausage and shared a few others with friends. It was all out of this world. I can't wait to go back again.,5.0
"There's a LOT of really great pizza in NYC, that's nothing new. But combine amazing pizza with friendly, caring service and a killer ambiance, and Paulie Gee's has a leg up on a lot of the other heavy hitters. The wait can be crazy, but we came in on a Tuesday night and it was half empty. I guess the key is to come when there's post-blizzard sludge everywhere and no one else wants to go out. Paulie Gee was there as I'm told he usually is, weaving around the space with his cup of coffee and stopping at literally every table. For us, he offered to curate our pizza order and who were we to argue? Read on for what Paulie Gee himself recommends:- The Greenpointer: according to Paulie, basically like eating a salad due to the piles of fresh baby arugula on top. - The Mo Cheeks: My personal favorite of the meal. The pickled onions on there are a nice surprise, and give a nice kick to the rest of the ingredients. - The Monte Cristo: OK, so this is probably something I would never think to order myself, but I'm glad it came out for us because it's actually super tasty. It comes with Canadian bacon and a drizzle of maple syrup, which I know sounds weird but trust me (or rather, trust Paulie). - I didn't catch the name of the last pizza, but it was one of the best and after peeking at the menu again I think it might have been the Hellboy. It was piled high with the tastiest Berkshire Sopressata, and it was perfect with the side of Mike's hot honey (which you haven't tried on pizza you must immediately). They asked if we wanted a dessert pizza but at that point we were stuffed to the gills. It was one of the best New York pizza experiences I've had so far, and the service is what really puts them above and beyond. I'm going to run for vice-president of the Paulie Gee fanclub soon!",5.0
"Came here a few days ago with my friend after work. Very dark inside, took some time for my eyeballs to adjust lol. We started off with some beers and then went with the Hellboy which was AMAZING. The hot honey makes a difference! Then we went with a vegan pie since neither one of us was particularly full. We ordered one with spinach, sea salt and garlic on it (sorry don't remember the name!) It was OK, not that memorable. The standout is by far Hellboy, the crust for both pizzas was SUPER THIN, firm and didn't fall apart on me. We both liked it. I took off a star for the spinach pie being nothing special and that it's a bit on the pricey side. Overall, I think I'll be back to try the other pizzas on the menu!",4.0
"Maybe we came on an off night, but we didn't care too much about the pizza and it was definitely not the best we've had. My friend wanted to celebrate her belated birthday at Paulie Gee's and so we did. We ordered 3 pies (Greenpointer, Ricotta Be Kidding Me, and The Hometown Brisket). I think the Hometown Brisket was our favorite only because of the BBQ sauce. Other than that, there wasn't much brisket pieces on the pizza. Ricotta Be Kidding Me was okay. The Greenpointer was all greens so that balanced our meal a little bit. I hear people waiting for hours to get a seat here and right now I'm just wondering where all the hype went? We came when they were opening, so thank goodness we didn't wait on line for this...cause it wouldn't have been worth it. FYI: There's no sign outside that says ""Paulie Gee's"". You just have to look by the address number ""60"" in order to find this place. I actually walked passed it while we were trying to find it. Also, use your flash on your phones to read the menu. I really liked the rustic interior but it was literally pitch black in there.",3.0
"Zagat rated the hellboy as the best pizza in NYC. Wow! Big call Zagat... We had to try! We would say it was delicious... But I would have to say Marta is equal of not just ahead. We got here at 6:40 and had to wait over an hr to sit at the bar. When getting here service was prompt and food was great! We ordered the hellboy and the hellified porkpie white and I have to say it was fresh, full of flavor and great value. My only critique would be more hot suppressa on the hellified and take numbers at the door! It's a little unreasonable to ask people to wait 90 mins and not offer to call when table it ready. Either way it was great but probably won't be crossing the river to wait another 90 mins.",4.0
"If there was ever a restaurant that inspires the need for #PiDay (3.14) to be everyday, it is Paulie Gee's. The pizza is a true art, and every bite is important, from the center to the crust crust.  PG is located in pizza heaven, or right near the water on Greenpoint Ave if you want a Google Map friendly address.Read it on my blog: highclasstohighlifes.com…As you'll see below I'm constantly on the proscuitt of happiness but this time we went for a different ham, Canadian bacon, and on the Monte Cristo. You bet it counted towards happiness. This pizza combines maple syrup drizzle and gouda with the ham. Yes, yes and more yes. Paulie asked if we had butter on the crust...sadly, no. SO MUCH REGRET....that I'll be back in no time to try it. You'll notice on the menu that they have a brisket pizza that features Hometown BBQ -- I love this local BK collaboration. You can get sauced the other way too with Greenpoint local brews!Anyway, I have nearly eaten my way through the entire menu (still need to do a bit of adventuring on the vegan side, every time I get close, I just want meat...) and I have been very pleased with every slice thus far. Therefore my advice to you is go with the pizza that's toppings are most appealing...or grab a handful of friends and share, then you can try multiple pizzas!The man, who is not a myth, but definitely a legend is often found inside checking in on tables, ensuring quality control and getting to know the patrons. He loved my last Instagram post that did a little play words...sharing that I was on the prosciutt of happiness with his King Henry Classic. He's always all smiles and usually wearing a great hat, he is Paulie Gee himself. Paulie Gee's - High Class to High Lifes If you really knead to get delivery or pickup, you'll have to look elsewhere for now though. The only way to leave Paulie Gee's with a to-go box is with leftovers. Rumor has it that a slice joint is opening up nearby though! I'm counting down the days, hours and minutes. Want to keep drooling? Read the menu!Pro Tip: Grab dinner at Paulie Gee's then walk straight out on the water in Greenpoint to Transmitter park or the outlook. Maybe even catch a sunset and BYO night cap!",5.0
"My old pal Carlos and I visited Paulie Gee's last night and had a great meal. I'm accustomed to going with the ol' vegan girlfriend and have a tradition where we split two pies from their extensive vegan selection, so we can try two different types of pies. The vegan and non-vegan selections are both extensive; each category has at least a half dozen kinds of pies, including oil bases, white slices, marinara, spinach-based, spicy honey and barbecue sauce foundations. The pies are aesthetically pleasing to every sense, well, every sense except sound. It's usually better when sound isn't a factor. At least when you're talking about food. When you're talking about music, sound is obviously a very important sense to talk about. I may go as far as to say that in a conversation about music, sound is the only sense that matters.I was excited to go with Carlos because I was going to get to eat their meat and actual cheese. The Paulie Gee's brisket is lean and delicious. Their pickled red onions possess a truly memorable tang and are worth spending a couple buck to add on to pretty much any pie. The ricotta dollops on the Ricky Ricotta feel more like bursts of a cream sauce than regular old cheese. Interestingly, the dairy and non-dairy ricotta cheeses are almost indecipherable in quality, which goes to show that Paulie Gee's knows what's up. Carlos and I were pleased to compliment the trad Italian flavors of the Ricky Ricotta with a tangy Barbecue Brisket pie. I'm psyched to go with a fellow omnivore again, because there are tons of other flavor combos I'm eager to try. New Yorkers, such as myself, are notorious for being dicks about the quality of pizza dough. It's the dough that invalidates the Chicago Deep Dish's false aspiration to pizza status. I can't stand Sicilian pizza either, which is a controversial take in Nueva York. Anyhow, no matter how well adorned a Paulie Gee's pie is, its base--the crust--is its most distinct and wonderful element. The crust is thin but springy, and always a little charred. It's pretty much naan bread, which is either a very luck coincidence or a visionary innovation. Naan bread, as you know, is lit, and, as it turns out, it is the perfect surface upon which various pizza ingredients should be placed and/or spread to mingle harmoniously.I've visited Paulie Gee's a number of times, and there's a bit of narrative that forms around my visits. The first time I tried to go, it was around noon, and my gf and I made the unpleasant discovery that Paulie Gee's does not open til 5 PM. The next time, we rolled up in a deep crew of six and had to wait about two to three hours for a table for six. If you find yourself in that position, you'll be okay though because there are plenty of bars around. There's also the water/skyline, mere yards away and a nice record store a block away.The gf and I have gone a few other times and it's always been great--except for the one time that a camera crew was shooting a special on Paulie Gee's vegan options. My girlfriend and I were in the shot all throughout our meal, and we were fighting (as subtly as possible) for the duration of our meal. I was taken aback and somewhat miffed when the producers of the show asked to do a talking head with us outside. The tension was palpable but they still insisted on interviewing us. I really do believe that you should foot the bill if you're going to interview someone for your television series or web series or gratuitously long Yelp review or whatever. At LEAST commission me to write a song for the soundtrack.In closing, I would like to offer a lil sum sum for the ladies. Are you interested in grandfatherly, charmingly blue collar, short men whose personalities closely resemble those of most Robert De Niro characters--but only in David O. Russel movies? If you do, and might want to be possibly hit on by a man of this caliber, you will love Paulie Gee's. At all times, Paulie Gee's eponymous Pizza Architect and Entrepreneur, Paulie Gee, stalks the narrow spaces between tables, checking in with customers--particularly of the reasonably attractive female demographic--and asks them how their food is, making small talk and thanking them for their patronage. I think this is cool. I would do the same if I were in his position, so don't take this the wrong way. Central to Paulie Gee's game is his ability to recommend a pizza place in seemingly every zip code on the planet and his inclination to tell you (the lady in question) the name of the dude who works there/owns the place, and to tell you (still the lady in question) to tell the dude (who owns the pizza place) to say that he (Paulie Gee) says hi. The Brotherhood of Pizza Mans is truly alive and well.",5.0

"I almost feel like it's blasphemy for not giving 5 stars. Finally made my way over here at Paulie Gees after way too long. Clearly this place is GPs staple so was excited to drop by on Wednesday night.There was no wait- very good. I had been worried about this so called 3x around 6:45pm to see how long it was before heading over. No one picked up and their answering service basically hangs up on you. I ordered the Daniela and he ordered the brisket pizza. Mine came out a good 7 minutes before his. I noticed immediately that about 40% of the crust was charred to the point of being inedible. To top that off, the spinach topping my pizza was the same. It was literally a black piece of ash and when I picked a leaf up or crumbled in my hands. The cheese blend was very good (mozzarella and Parmesan) but the pizza was just not good. To top it off, parts of the center were soggy and didn't hold the toppings when I grabbed a slice. When the brisket pizza came out a few minutes later I noticed immediately that it was cooked perfectly. The crust was edible and delicious. I was bummed that mine didn't come out this way especially since it seemed like a classic. All I can say is they probably put our orders in together and maybe his needed a little longer in the oven. Mine was most likely getting over cooked while his needed a few more minutes. Hence the gap in time between both of our orders coming out and the reason why mine was half done by the time his came out.I was really disappointed but the good thing to know is at least the brisket pizza was cooked well. I know there is a good meal at Paulie Gees but I feel like we were jipped.Also, great touch that Paulie himself came in to greet all the diners. He was super friendly and it brings a family quality to the place. This is maybe one of the main reasons I'd come back.",3.0

There's not much in the form of a waiting area, which particularly sucked given how freezing the weather was, but we had a feeling the pie would be well worth the wait (plus we also got to watch a tipsy couple aggressively suck face up close and personal which was an unexpected but enjoyable twist).The vibe was cool, featuring low--lighting, a huge and beautiful custom brick oven, and trendy attractive people who's favorite bands you've never heard of.When we finally were seated I was stoked to see the menu offered a huge variety of pies with all sorts of niche toppings AND vegan options(I personally don't give two damns about veganism but they presented them in an unpretentious way so I was cool with it). We eventually decided to go with the Hell Boy and the Prokypineapple, both of which were amazing, and I'm looking forward to going back and further chowing my way down the menu.Go here.",5.0
"After a 2-hours wait on a weekend for a party of 2, we finally got a table at the renowned pizza shop in Brooklyn. After having one of the best pizzas of all time at Little Isabella located in Baltimore, I was on the mission to find its companion in NYC. Overhyped as we suspected, Paulie Gee had nothing on Little Isabella! Perhaps, it was the quirky blend of sweet and savory flavors, but with that 2-hour wait, we surely did not have a pleasing experience.We ordered two pies: HellBoy and Greenpointer. HellBoy: Fresh Mozzarella, Italian Tomatoes, Berkshire Sopressata Piccante, Parmigiano Reggiano and Mike's HOT HoneyGreenpointer:Fresh Mozzarella, Baby Arugula, Olive Oil, Fresh Lemon Juice and Shaved Parmigiano ReggianoWe didn't really enjoy the sweetness of the honey in the HellBoy or the sourness of the lemon juice in the Greenpointer. Fresh, as we saw them make each pie to order, I definitely thought the doughiness of the pizza wasn't anything spectacular. In terms of service, I think it was pretty solid. Our waiter was patient and helpful. As a surprise, Paulie Gee himself introduced himself to just about every table, making it feel quite personable. In all, I definitely wouldn't return back to this pizzeria, especially with that crazy wait. During that 2-hour wait and 1.5-hour dining time, I can drive down to Baltimore and get some Little Isabella for half the price and no wait!",3.0
"3.5 stars for this pizza joint hidden behind a HUGE wooden door all the way down Franklin streetCrust was good with a nice char on the hellboy but the crust of the greenpoint pizza seemed a bit underdone We were quoted a 1.5 hour wait at 8pm for 3 on a Saturday but we were lucky that people in front of us hadn't returned so we were seated right away! (so don't be discouraged)---hellboy: everything was good about this except that spicy honey!

"If you want great pizza and the right atmosphere look no further than Paulie Gee's.

Would have been content but it was so good we ordered a third.The texture. The crust. The toppings. Hard pressed to mention anything I didn't like. I love pizza and this place is right up there with the best. That includes many pizzerias throughout Italy.Paulie stopped by for a chat and he has a fantastic personality. Great stories and it is obvious that he loves what he does and holds him team to very high standards.He was also kind enough to give me an official Paulie Gee's pin and a limoncello. A very nice touch!Make sure you check out the pizza oven in the back. It's a small,cozy place so don't pass this place up in you are in NY.",5.0
I take my pizza very seriously. The vegan pizza is so good here that if they didn't tell you it was vegan you would have no clue. I had the pie with vegan sausage and shared a few others with friends. It was all out of this world. I can't wait to go back again.,5.0
"There's a LOT of really great pizza in NYC, that's nothing new. But combine amazing pizza with friendly, caring service and a killer ambiance, and Paulie Gee's has a leg up on a lot of the other heavy hitters. The wait can be crazy, but we came in on a Tuesday night and it was half empty. I guess the key is to come when there's post-blizzard sludge everywhere and no one else wants to go out. Paulie Gee was there as I'm told he usually is, weaving around the space with his cup of coffee and stopping at literally every table. For us, he offered to curate our pizza order and who were we to argue? Read on for what Paulie Gee himself recommends:- The Greenpointer: according to Paulie, basically like eating a salad due to the piles of fresh baby arugula on top. - The Mo Cheeks: My personal favorite of the meal. The pickled onions on there are a nice surprise, and give a nice kick to the rest of the ingredients. - The Monte Cristo: OK, so this is probably something I would never think to order myself, but I'm glad it came out for us because it's actually super tasty. It comes with Canadian bacon and a drizzle of maple syrup, which I know sounds weird but trust me (or rather, trust Paulie). - I didn't catch the name of the last pizza, but it was one of the best and after peeking at the menu again I think it might have been the Hellboy. It was piled high with the tastiest Berkshire Sopressata, and it was perfect with the side of Mike's hot honey (which you haven't tried on pizza you must immediately). They asked if we wanted a dessert pizza but at that point we were stuffed to the gills. It was one of the best New York pizza experiences I've had so far, and the service is what really puts them above and beyond. I'm going to run for vice-president of the Paulie Gee fanclub soon!",5.0
"Came here a few days ago with my friend after work. Very dark inside, took some time for my eyeballs to adjust lol. We started off with some beers and then went with the Hellboy which was AMAZING. The hot honey makes a difference! Then we went with a vegan pie since neither one of us was particularly full. We ordered one with spinach, sea salt and garlic on it (sorry don't remember the name!) It was OK, not that memorable. The standout is by far Hellboy, the crust for both pizzas was SUPER THIN, firm and didn't fall apart on me. We both liked it. I took off a star for the spinach pie being nothing special and that it's a bit on the pricey side. Overall, I think I'll be back to try the other pizzas on the menu!",4.0
"Maybe we came on an off night, but we didn't care too much about the pizza and it was definitely not the best we've had. My friend wanted to celebrate her belated birthday at Paulie Gee's and so we did. We ordered 3 pies (Greenpointer, Ricotta Be Kidding Me, and The Hometown Brisket). I think the Hometown Brisket was our favorite only because of the BBQ sauce. Other than that, there wasn't much brisket pieces on the pizza. Ricotta Be Kidding Me was okay. The Greenpointer was all greens so that balanced our meal a little bit. I hear people waiting for hours to get a seat here and right now I'm just wondering where all the hype went? We came when they were opening, so thank goodness we didn't wait on line for this...cause it wouldn't have been worth it. FYI: There's no sign outside that says ""Paulie Gee's"". You just have to look by the address number ""60"" in order to find this place. I actually walked passed it while we were trying to find it. Also, use your flash on your phones to read the menu. I really liked the rustic interior but it was literally pitch black in there.",3.0
"Zagat rated the hellboy as the best pizza in NYC. Wow! Big call Zagat... We had to try! We would say it was delicious... But I would have to say Marta is equal of not just ahead. We got here at 6:40 and had to wait over an hr to sit at the bar. When getting here service was prompt and food was great! We ordered the hellboy and the hellified porkpie white and I have to say it was fresh, full of flavor and great value. My only critique would be more hot suppressa on the hellified and take numbers at the door! It's a little unreasonable to ask people to wait 90 mins and not offer to call when table it ready. Either way it was great but probably won't be crossing the river to wait another 90 mins.",4.0
"If there was ever a restaurant that inspires the need for #PiDay (3.14) to be everyday, it is Paulie Gee's. The pizza is a true art, and every bite is important, from the center to the crust crust.  PG is located in pizza heaven, or right near the water on Greenpoint Ave if you want a Google Map friendly address.Read it on my blog: highclasstohighlifes.com…As you'll see below I'm constantly on the proscuitt of happiness but this time we went for a different ham, Canadian bacon, and on the Monte Cristo. You bet it counted towards happiness. This pizza combines maple syrup drizzle and gouda with the ham. Yes, yes and more yes. Paulie asked if we had butter on the crust...sadly, no. SO MUCH REGRET....that I'll be back in no time to try it. You'll notice on the menu that they have a brisket pizza that features Hometown BBQ -- I love this local BK collaboration. You can get sauced the other way too with Greenpoint local brews!Anyway, I have nearly eaten my way through the entire menu (still need to do a bit of adventuring on the vegan side, every time I get close, I just want meat...) and I have been very pleased with every slice thus far. Therefore my advice to you is go with the pizza that's toppings are most appealing...or grab a handful of friends and share, then you can try multiple pizzas!The man, who is not a myth, but definitely a legend is often found inside checking in on tables, ensuring quality control and getting to know the patrons. He loved my last Instagram post that did a little play words...sharing that I was on the prosciutt of happiness with his King Henry Classic. He's always all smiles and usually wearing a great hat, he is Paulie Gee himself. Paulie Gee's - High Class to High Lifes If you really knead to get delivery or pickup, you'll have to look elsewhere for now though. The only way to leave Paulie Gee's with a to-go box is with leftovers. Rumor has it that a slice joint is opening up nearby though! I'm counting down the days, hours and minutes. Want to keep drooling? Read the menu!Pro Tip: Grab dinner at Paulie Gee's then walk straight out on the water in Greenpoint to Transmitter park or the outlook. Maybe even catch a sunset and BYO night cap!",5.0
"My old pal Carlos and I visited Paulie Gee's last night and had a great meal. I'm accustomed to going with the ol' vegan girlfriend and have a tradition where we split two pies from their extensive vegan selection, so we can try two different types of pies. The vegan and non-vegan selections are both extensive; each category has at least a half dozen kinds of pies, including oil bases, white slices, marinara, spinach-based, spicy honey and barbecue sauce foundations. The pies are aesthetically pleasing to every sense, well, every sense except sound. It's usually better when sound isn't a factor. At least when you're talking about food. When you're talking about music, sound is obviously a very important sense to talk about. I may go as far as to say that in a conversation about music, sound is the only sense that matters.I was excited to go with Carlos because I was going to get to eat their meat and actual cheese. The Paulie Gee's brisket is lean and delicious. Their pickled red onions possess a truly memorable tang and are worth spending a couple buck to add on to pretty much any pie. The ricotta dollops on the Ricky Ricotta feel more like bursts of a cream sauce than regular old cheese. Interestingly, the dairy and non-dairy ricotta cheeses are almost indecipherable in quality, which goes to show that Paulie Gee's knows what's up. Carlos and I were pleased to compliment the trad Italian flavors of the Ricky Ricotta with a tangy Barbecue Brisket pie. I'm psyched to go with a fellow omnivore again, because there are tons of other flavor combos I'm eager to try. New Yorkers, such as myself, are notorious for being dicks about the quality of pizza dough. It's the dough that invalidates the Chicago Deep Dish's false aspiration to pizza status. I can't stand Sicilian pizza either, which is a controversial take in Nueva York. Anyhow, no matter how well adorned a Paulie Gee's pie is, its base--the crust--is its most distinct and wonderful element. The crust is thin but springy, and always a little charred. It's pretty much naan bread, which is either a very luck coincidence or a visionary innovation. Naan bread, as you know, is lit, and, as it turns out, it is the perfect surface upon which various pizza ingredients should be placed and/or spread to mingle harmoniously.I've visited Paulie Gee's a number of times, and there's a bit of narrative that forms around my visits. The first time I tried to go, it was around noon, and my gf and I made the unpleasant discovery that Paulie Gee's does not open til 5 PM. The next time, we rolled up in a deep crew of six and had to wait about two to three hours for a table for six. If you find yourself in that position, you'll be okay though because there are plenty of bars around. There's also the water/skyline, mere yards away and a nice record store a block away.The gf and I have gone a few other times and it's always been great--except for the one time that a camera crew was shooting a special on Paulie Gee's vegan options. My girlfriend and I were in the shot all throughout our meal, and we were fighting (as subtly as possible) for the duration of our meal. I was taken aback and somewhat miffed when the producers of the show asked to do a talking head with us outside. The tension was palpable but they still insisted on interviewing us. I really do believe that you should foot the bill if you're going to interview someone for your television series or web series or gratuitously long Yelp review or whatever. At LEAST commission me to write a song for the soundtrack.In closing, I would like to offer a lil sum sum for the ladies. Are you interested in grandfatherly, charmingly blue collar, short men whose personalities closely resemble those of most Robert De Niro characters--but only in David O. Russel movies? If you do, and might want to be possibly hit on by a man of this caliber, you will love Paulie Gee's. At all times, Paulie Gee's eponymous Pizza Architect and Entrepreneur, Paulie Gee, stalks the narrow spaces between tables, checking in with customers--particularly of the reasonably attractive female demographic--and asks them how their food is, making small talk and thanking them for their patronage. I think this is cool. I would do the same if I were in his position, so don't take this the wrong way. Central to Paulie Gee's game is his ability to recommend a pizza place in seemingly every zip code on the planet and his inclination to tell you (the lady in question) the name of the dude who works there/owns the place, and to tell you (still the lady in question) to tell the dude (who owns the pizza place) to say that he (Paulie Gee) says hi. The Brotherhood of Pizza Mans is truly alive and well.",5.0

"I almost feel like it's blasphemy for not giving 5 stars. Finally made my way over here at Paulie Gees after way too long. Clearly this place is GPs staple so was excited to drop by on Wednesday night.There was no wait- very good. I had been worried about this so called 3x around 6:45pm to see how long it was before heading over. No one picked up and their answering service basically hangs up on you. I ordered the Daniela and he ordered the brisket pizza. Mine came out a good 7 minutes before his. I noticed immediately that about 40% of the crust was charred to the point of being inedible. To top that off, the spinach topping my pizza was the same. It was literally a black piece of ash and when I picked a leaf up or crumbled in my hands. The cheese blend was very good (mozzarella and Parmesan) but the pizza was just not good. To top it off, parts of the center were soggy and didn't hold the toppings when I grabbed a slice. When the brisket pizza came out a few minutes later I noticed immediately that it was cooked perfectly. The crust was edible and delicious. I was bummed that mine didn't come out this way especially since it seemed like a classic. All I can say is they probably put our orders in together and maybe his needed a little longer in the oven. Mine was most likely getting over cooked while his needed a few more minutes. Hence the gap in time between both of our orders coming out and the reason why mine was half done by the time his came out.I was really disappointed but the good thing to know is at least the brisket pizza was cooked well. I know there is a good meal at Paulie Gees but I feel like we were jipped.Also, great touch that Paulie himself came in to greet all the diners. He was super friendly and it brings a family quality to the place. This is maybe one of the main reasons I'd come back.",3.0
"Delicious!! Definitely made my top 3 favorite pizza  places (the others being robertas and best pizza). We've been meaning to come forever but the line is always so long. We were finally seated right away on a Friday night because we ran over as soon as they opened at 6pm. I would highly recommend this tactic to those of you who have been meaning to come and haven't been able to due to the wait -- the food will be worth it. We ordered the hellboy, ricotta be kidding me and the hot honey ice cream Sunday for dessert. The hellboy was our fave. It was basically a pepperoni pizza with hot honey lined under the cheese. I liked it more than the bees sting from Robertas but both are very good. All in all would highly recommend. As an extra plus Paulie Gee was hanging around today,though it seems like he does this quite often, going from table to table talking to the customers.",5.0
"My husband and I visited Paulie Gee's about two years ago and he still dreams of the Hellboy. This time we ordered the Hellboy and Cherry Jones.  The Hellboy was great but just a touch too sweet for me.  The hot honey adds a little kick but is definitely not too hot.  My husband will tell you it is the best pizza he has ever had (saying a lot since he was raised in the Bronx).  The Cherry Jones on the other hand was way too sweet for both of us.  I couldn't taste anything other then honey.  My husband embarrassed me by telling the waitress we didn't like it.  She offered us a replacement.  We ordered the Ricky Ricotta.  It was alright.  I was shocked because the ricotta was not warm.  The crust at Paulie Gee's is the perfect texture.  However, two of our three pizzas were too charred for my taste.  I must mention Paulie walks around all the tables to make sure everyone is enjoying.  Love it!  The restaurant is too dark and loud for my taste.",3.0
"Interesting decor, super dark inside and it was hard to read the menu. We were seated under one of the speakers, so I felt like an old person complaining about how loud the music was, but really, we came for the food. Split a salad and a Greenpointer pie, and neither disappointed. Both were served quickly, and the pie just exploded with flavor. The lemon kick was strong but not overwhelming, and the crust was perfection. Service was attentive, friendly, and efficient. Lots of menu choices for anything your palate is craving. Overall, a very good experience, and one I would look forward to enjoying again.",4.0
"New York probably takes its pizza more seriously than anywhere else in the world.  I'm sure there are 7 or 8 people reading this right now that would be willing to shiv a guy for saying something bad about their favorite slice.  With that in mind, Paulie Gee's is a pizza lover's pizza place.  They make Neapolitan style pizzas with an oven shipped in from Naples and lovingly reassembled by small, Italian elves.  From this oven, comes perfectly leopard-spotted pizzas with just the right amount of bouncy chewy dough.To top the pizza, there's a lovingly curated selection to choose from so don't you dare ask for substitutions.  Lucky for you whether you're a vegan, vegetarian, white/red pie lover, averse to spice, meat lover, or whatever!  There's at least one pie on the menu* that will make you say, ""hmmm..."".  My personal favorites are the Mo' Cheeks ($16, has guanciale and is perfect with the pickled onions) and Ricotta Be Kidding Me ($17, with tons of meat topped with adorable dollops of cottage cheese).  I've only ever had 1 pizza there that wasn't stellar and I won't tell you which one because you'll definitely judge me for choosing it in the first place.The atmosphere at Paulie Gee's is great.  It's quintessential Brooklyn.  Think dark unfinished wood walls with an eclectic collection of tables made from reclaimed wood, music consisting of a mixture of jazz, rock, and anything but top 40s.  What always makes my night is that the ACTUAL Paulie Gee walks around and talks to EVERYONE.  It doesn't matter if Keri Russell** is sitting right next to you, he will still come by and have a 5-20 minute conversation with you and your table.  My only complaint is how popular this place is.  They've stopped making pizzas to go and still, the wait is crazy.  I've never been able to get a table in less than 45 minutes unless it was late at night.  I guess that's not a bad problem to have.  I also kind of wish they would get a full liquor license and take that creative pizza combo creating mind into the cocktail realm.  I mean...Mike's Hot Honey + Whiskey?  Maybe?---------* If you can't find a pizza you like on the printed menu in the restaurant, whip out the smartphone and check out the ""secret"" menu on the website.** This actually happened.",4.0
"We've literally flown across the country to enjoy his pizza. It's that good! Walking in, the aroma of pizza cooking in a brick oven hits your nose.This is about time my stomach starts to growl. The vibe is flowing with positive energy, and the low lighting is flattering & sexy. The bar to the left is where you can order a beverage while you wait.  They have a decent beer selection. Wait times vary, but it's usually not as long as anticipated, and well worth the effort.Everyone, including the servers, seem happy to be there.Paulie Gee is the utmost host. He's always found time to come to our table with suggestions, stories, and the occasional limoncello, (his recipe of the celebratory cocktail).Talking with him, I've gathered that he makes the vegan pizza for the people, or demand for it, but he didn't seem interested in the cause.

"Absolutely delicious. Huge selection of pies - good for meatatarians, vegetarians, and even vegans. Wood fire oven delivers the signature light smoke and char. Dough is absolutely tender and springy. They even let the pizza rest afterwards so the cheese sets and you don't burn the crap out of your mouth.Hellboy- spicy pepperoni with hot honey. Absolute classic pizza. Hot honey perfectly blankets the spicy meat. Super simple, absolutely delicious. Get two, trust meRicotta/sausage pie - similar to one above, hot honey included. However ricotta and sausage are a welcome addition.

Someone sitting next to us saw our struggle and took us to try the  IN Ricotta Da Vegan so we did. AMAZING!!

"My old pal Carlos and I visited Paulie Gee's last night and had a great meal. I'm accustomed to going with the ol' vegan girlfriend and have a tradition where we split two pies from their extensive vegan selection, so we can try two different types of pies. The vegan and non-vegan selections are both extensive; each category has at least a half dozen kinds of pies, including oil bases, white slices, marinara, spinach-based, spicy honey and barbecue sauce foundations. The pies are aesthetically pleasing to every sense, well, every sense except sound. It's usually better when sound isn't a factor. At least when you're talking about food. When you're talking about music, sound is obviously a very important sense to talk about. I may go as far as to say that in a conversation about music, sound is the only sense that matters.I was excited to go with Carlos because I was going to get to eat their meat and actual cheese. The Paulie Gee's brisket is lean and delicious. Their pickled red onions possess a truly memorable tang and are worth spending a couple buck to add on to pretty much any pie. The ricotta dollops on the Ricky Ricotta feel more like bursts of a cream sauce than regular old cheese. Interestingly, the dairy and non-dairy ricotta cheeses are almost indecipherable in quality, which goes to show that Paulie Gee's knows what's up. Carlos and I were pleased to compliment the trad Italian flavors of the Ricky Ricotta with a tangy Barbecue Brisket pie. I'm psyched to go with a fellow omnivore again, because there are tons of other flavor combos I'm eager to try. New Yorkers, such as myself, are notorious for being dicks about the quality of pizza dough. It's the dough that invalidates the Chicago Deep Dish's false aspiration to pizza status. I can't stand Sicilian pizza either, which is a controversial take in Nueva York. Anyhow, no matter how well adorned a Paulie Gee's pie is, its base--the crust--is its most distinct and wonderful element. The crust is thin but springy, and always a little charred. It's pretty much naan bread, which is either a very luck coincidence or a visionary innovation. Naan bread, as you know, is lit, and, as it turns out, it is the perfect surface upon which various pizza ingredients should be placed and/or spread to mingle harmoniously.I've visited Paulie Gee's a number of times, and there's a bit of narrative that forms around my visits. The first time I tried to go, it was around noon, and my gf and I made the unpleasant discovery that Paulie Gee's does not open til 5 PM. The next time, we rolled up in a deep crew of six and had to wait about two to three hours for a table for six. If you find yourself in that position, you'll be okay though because there are plenty of bars around. There's also the water/skyline, mere yards away and a nice record store a block away.The gf and I have gone a few other times and it's always been great--except for the one time that a camera crew was shooting a special on Paulie Gee's vegan options. My girlfriend and I were in the shot all throughout our meal, and we were fighting (as subtly as possible) for the duration of our meal. I was taken aback and somewhat miffed when the producers of the show asked to do a talking head with us outside. The tension was palpable but they still insisted on interviewing us. I really do believe that you should foot the bill if you're going to interview someone for your television series or web series or gratuitously long Yelp review or whatever.

"I almost feel like it's blasphemy for not giving 5 stars. Finally made my way over here at Paulie Gees after way too long. Clearly this place is GPs staple so was excited to drop by on Wednesday night.There was no wait- very good. I had been worried about this so called 3x around 6:45pm to see how long it was before heading over. No one picked up and their answering service basically hangs up on you. I ordered the Daniela and he ordered the brisket pizza. Mine came out a good 7 minutes before his. I noticed immediately that about 40% of the crust was charred to the point of being inedible. To top that off, the spinach topping my pizza was the same. It was literally a black piece of ash and when I picked a leaf up or crumbled in my hands. The cheese blend was very good (mozzarella and Parmesan) but the pizza was just not good. To top it off, parts of the center were soggy and didn't hold the toppings when I grabbed a slice. When the brisket pizza came out a few minutes later I noticed immediately that it was cooked perfectly. The crust was edible and delicious. I was bummed that mine didn't come out this way especially since it seemed like a classic. All I can say is they probably put our orders in together and maybe his needed a little longer in the oven. Mine was most likely getting over cooked while his needed a few more minutes. Hence the gap in time between both of our orders coming out and the reason why mine was half done by the time his came out.I was really disappointed but the good thing to know is at least the brisket pizza was cooked well. I know there is a good meal at Paulie Gees but I feel like we were jipped.Also, great touch that Paulie himself came in to greet all the diners. He was super friendly and it brings a family quality to the place. This is maybe one of the main reasons I'd come back.",3.0
"Delicious!! Definitely made my top 3 favorite pizza  places (the others being robertas and best pizza). We've been meaning to come forever but the line is always so long. We were finally seated right away on a Friday night because we ran over as soon as they opened at 6pm. I would highly recommend this tactic to those of you who have been meaning to come and haven't been able to due to the wait -- the food will be worth it. We ordered the hellboy, ricotta be kidding me and the hot honey ice cream Sunday for dessert. The hellboy was our fave. It was basically a pepperoni pizza with hot honey lined under the cheese. I liked it more than the bees sting from Robertas but both are very good. All in all would highly recommend. As an extra plus Paulie Gee was hanging around today,though it seems like he does this quite often, going from table to table talking to the customers.",5.0
"My husband and I visited Paulie Gee's about two years ago and he still dreams of the Hellboy. This time we ordered the Hellboy and Cherry Jones.  The Hellboy was great but just a touch too sweet for me.  The hot honey adds a little kick but is definitely not too hot.  My husband will tell you it is the best pizza he has ever had (saying a lot since he was raised in the Bronx).  The Cherry Jones on the other hand was way too sweet for both of us.  I couldn't taste anything other then honey.  My husband embarrassed me by telling the waitress we didn't like it.  She offered us a replacement.  We ordered the Ricky Ricotta.  It was alright.  I was shocked because the ricotta was not warm.  The crust at Paulie Gee's is the perfect texture.  However, two of our three pizzas were too charred for my taste.  I must mention Paulie walks around all the tables to make sure everyone is enjoying.  Love it!  The restaurant is too dark and loud for my taste.",3.0
"Interesting decor, super dark inside and it was hard to read the menu. We were seated under one of the speakers, so I felt like an old person complaining about how loud the music was, but really, we came for the food. Split a salad and a Greenpointer pie, and neither disappointed. Both were served quickly, and the pie just exploded with flavor. The lemon kick was strong but not overwhelming, and the crust was perfection. Service was attentive, friendly, and efficient. Lots of menu choices for anything your palate is craving. Overall, a very good experience, and one I would look forward to enjoying again.",4.0
"New York probably takes its pizza more seriously than anywhere else in the world.  I'm sure there are 7 or 8 people reading this right now that would be willing to shiv a guy for saying something bad about their favorite slice.  With that in mind, Paulie Gee's is a pizza lover's pizza place.  They make Neapolitan style pizzas with an oven shipped in from Naples and lovingly reassembled by small, Italian elves.  From this oven, comes perfectly leopard-spotted pizzas with just the right amount of bouncy chewy dough.To top the pizza, there's a lovingly curated selection to choose from so don't you dare ask for substitutions.  Lucky for you whether you're a vegan, vegetarian, white/red pie lover, averse to spice, meat lover, or whatever!  There's at least one pie on the menu* that will make you say, ""hmmm..."".  My personal favorites are the Mo' Cheeks ($16, has guanciale and is perfect with the pickled onions) and Ricotta Be Kidding Me ($17, with tons of meat topped with adorable dollops of cottage cheese).  I've only ever had 1 pizza there that wasn't stellar and I won't tell you which one because you'll definitely judge me for choosing it in the first place.The atmosphere at Paulie Gee's is great.  It's quintessential Brooklyn.  Think dark unfinished wood walls with an eclectic collection of tables made from reclaimed wood, music consisting of a mixture of jazz, rock, and anything but top 40s.  What always makes my night is that the ACTUAL Paulie Gee walks around and talks to EVERYONE.  It doesn't matter if Keri Russell** is sitting right next to you, he will still come by and have a 5-20 minute conversation with you and your table.  My only complaint is how popular this place is.  They've stopped making pizzas to go and still, the wait is crazy.  I've never been able to get a table in less than 45 minutes unless it was late at night.  I guess that's not a bad problem to have.  I also kind of wish they would get a full liquor license and take that creative pizza combo creating mind into the cocktail realm.  I mean...Mike's Hot Honey + Whiskey?  Maybe?---------* If you can't find a pizza you like on the printed menu in the restaurant, whip out the smartphone and check out the ""secret"" menu on the website.** This actually happened.",4.0
"We've literally flown across the country to enjoy his pizza. It's that good! Walking in, the aroma of pizza cooking in a brick oven hits your nose.This is about time my stomach starts to growl. The vibe is flowing with positive energy, and the low lighting is flattering & sexy. The bar to the left is where you can order a beverage while you wait.  They have a decent beer selection. Wait times vary, but it's usually not as long as anticipated, and well worth the effort.Everyone, including the servers, seem happy to be there.Paulie Gee is the utmost host. He's always found time to come to our table with suggestions, stories, and the occasional limoncello, (his recipe of the celebratory cocktail).Talking with him, I've gathered that he makes the vegan pizza for the people, or demand for it, but he didn't seem interested in the cause. The funky bathrooms can be a challenge to use when you've had one too many! VEGAN Pies we LOVE Simply RedVegan Tomato Sauce with Tomatoes, Olive Oil.

"Absolutely delicious. Huge selection of pies - good for meatatarians, vegetarians, and even vegans. Wood fire oven delivers the signature light smoke and char. Dough is absolutely tender and springy. They even let the pizza rest afterwards so the cheese sets and you don't burn the crap out of your mouth.Hellboy- spicy pepperoni with hot honey. Absolute classic pizza. Hot honey perfectly blankets the spicy meat. Super simple, absolutely delicious. Get two, trust meRicotta/sausage pie - similar to one above, hot honey included. However ricotta and sausage are a welcome addition. While chunks of roasted garlic are an excellent accentSo many other pies, go try them for yourself.Big lines, put your name down and go drink at browerij lane.

"One of the challenges of  being vegan is getting your friends/family to be open to the idea of trying vegan food.I have never had Vegan Pizza before and I usually try to try a restaurant first before recommending to anyone especially a non vegan but I took a chance.When we first arrived we were having trouble picking something since everything was foreign to us. Someone sitting next to us saw our struggle and took us to try the  IN Ricotta Da Vegan so we did. AMAZING!! My non vegan date was impressed and I was so happy.Thanks Paulie Gee for making me looking good Whew! One pie (6 small slices) goes for 16 bucks . Its small, nice ambiance I would say its a little darkI would go again!Menu like here ------ pauliegee.com/greenpoint… xoxoC.",4.0
"Some of the best za in the city, bar none. The lady and I traveled far and wide for it since we'd heard such great things. It was a Friday night so the restaurant was predictably packed. There's not much in the form of a waiting area, which particularly sucked given how freezing the weather was, but we had a feeling the pie would be well worth the wait (plus we also got to watch a tipsy couple aggressively suck face up close and personal which was an unexpected but enjoyable twist).The vibe was cool, featuring low--lighting, a huge and beautiful custom brick oven, and trendy attractive people who's favorite bands you've never heard of.When we finally were seated I was stoked to see the menu offered a huge variety of pies with all sorts of niche toppings AND vegan options(I personally don't give two damns about veganism but they presented them in an unpretentious way so I was cool with it). We eventually decided to go with the Hell Boy and the Prokypineapple, both of which were amazing, and I'm looking forward to going back and further chowing my way down the menu.Go here.",5.0
"After a 2-hours wait on a weekend for a party of 2, we finally got a table at the renowned pizza shop in Brooklyn. After having one of the best pizzas of all time at Little Isabella located in Baltimore, I was on the mission to find its companion in NYC. Overhyped as we suspected, Paulie Gee had nothing on Little Isabella! Perhaps, it was the quirky blend of sweet and savory flavors, but with that 2-hour wait, we surely did not have a pleasing experience.We ordered two pies: HellBoy and Greenpointer. HellBoy: Fresh Mozzarella, Italian Tomatoes, Berkshire Sopressata Piccante, Parmigiano Reggiano and Mike's HOT HoneyGreenpointer:Fresh Mozzarella, Baby Arugula, Olive Oil, Fresh Lemon Juice and Shaved Parmigiano ReggianoWe didn't really enjoy the sweetness of the honey in the HellBoy or the sourness of the lemon juice in the Greenpointer. Fresh, as we saw them make each pie to order, I definitely thought the doughiness of the pizza wasn't anything spectacular. In terms of service, I think it was pretty solid. Our waiter was patient and helpful. As a surprise, Paulie Gee himself introduced himself to just about every table, making it feel quite personable. In all, I definitely wouldn't return back to this pizzeria, especially with that crazy wait. During that 2-hour wait and 1.5-hour dining time, I can drive down to Baltimore and get some Little Isabella for half the price and no wait!",3.0
"3.5 stars for this pizza joint hidden behind a HUGE wooden door all the way down Franklin streetCrust was good with a nice char on the hellboy but the crust of the greenpoint pizza seemed a bit underdone We were quoted a 1.5 hour wait at 8pm for 3 on a Saturday but we were lucky that people in front of us hadn't returned so we were seated right away! (so don't be discouraged)---hellboy: everything was good about this except that spicy honey! Should of gone with a more classic margherita style pizza instead---greenpoint: fresh arugula, with a bit too much lemon juice, so nothing special NOTE: they don't have pepper flakes, only chili oil",4.0
"If you want great pizza and the right atmosphere look no further than Paulie Gee's. We sat at the bar (luckily) and avoided a two hour wait.  The pizza choices are numerous, with some very creative options. There were three of us and we started with two pies. Would have been content but it was so good we ordered a third.The texture. The crust. The toppings. Hard pressed to mention anything I didn't like. I love pizza and this place is right up there with the best. That includes many pizzerias throughout Italy.Paulie stopped by for a chat and he has a fantastic personality. Great stories and it is obvious that he loves what he does and holds him team to very high standards.He was also kind enough to give me an official Paulie Gee's pin and a limoncello. A very nice touch!Make sure you check out the pizza oven in the back. It's a small,cozy place so don't pass this place up in you are in NY.",5.0
I take my pizza very seriously. The vegan pizza is so good here that if they didn't tell you it was vegan you would have no clue. I had the pie with vegan sausage and shared a few others with friends. It was all out of this world. I can't wait to go back again.,5.0
"There's a LOT of really great pizza in NYC, that's nothing new. But combine amazing pizza with friendly, caring service and a killer ambiance, and Paulie Gee's has a leg up on a lot of the other heavy hitters. The wait can be crazy, but we came in on a Tuesday night and it was half empty. I guess the key is to come when there's post-blizzard sludge everywhere and no one else wants to go out. Paulie Gee was there as I'm told he usually is, weaving around the space with his cup of coffee and stopping at literally every table. For us, he offered to curate our pizza order and who were we to argue? Read on for what Paulie Gee himself recommends:- The Greenpointer: according to Paulie, basically like eating a salad due to the piles of fresh baby arugula on top. - The Mo Cheeks: My personal favorite of the meal. The pickled onions on there are a nice surprise, and give a nice kick to the rest of the ingredients. - The Monte Cristo: OK, so this is probably something I would never think to order myself, but I'm glad it came out for us because it's actually super tasty. It comes with Canadian bacon and a drizzle of maple syrup, which I know sounds weird but trust me (or rather, trust Paulie). - I didn't catch the name of the last pizza, but it was one of the best and after peeking at the menu again I think it might have been the Hellboy. It was piled high with the tastiest Berkshire Sopressata, and it was perfect with the side of Mike's hot honey (which you haven't tried on pizza you must immediately). They asked if we wanted a dessert pizza but at that point we were stuffed to the gills. It was one of the best New York pizza experiences I've had so far, and the service is what really puts them above and beyond. I'm going to run for vice-president of the Paulie Gee fanclub soon!",5.0
"Came here a few days ago with my friend after work. Very dark inside, took some time for my eyeballs to adjust lol. We started off with some beers and then went with the Hellboy which was AMAZING. The hot honey makes a difference! Then we went with a vegan pie since neither one of us was particularly full. We ordered one with spinach, sea salt and garlic on it (sorry don't remember the name!) It was OK, not that memorable. The standout is by far Hellboy, the crust for both pizzas was SUPER THIN, firm and didn't fall apart on me. We both liked it. I took off a star for the spinach pie being nothing special and that it's a bit on the pricey side. Overall, I think I'll be back to try the other pizzas on the menu!",4.0
"Maybe we came on an off night, but we didn't care too much about the pizza and it was definitely not the best we've had. My friend wanted to celebrate her belated birthday at Paulie Gee's and so we did. We ordered 3 pies (Greenpointer, Ricotta Be Kidding Me, and The Hometown Brisket). I think the Hometown Brisket was our favorite only because of the BBQ sauce. Other than that, there wasn't much brisket pieces on the pizza. Ricotta Be Kidding Me was okay. The Greenpointer was all greens so that balanced our meal a little bit. I hear people waiting for hours to get a seat here and right now I'm just wondering where all the hype went? We came when they were opening, so thank goodness we didn't wait on line for this...cause it wouldn't have been worth it. FYI: There's no sign outside that says ""Paulie Gee's"".

"I almost feel like it's blasphemy for not giving 5 stars. Finally made my way over here at Paulie Gees after way too long. Clearly this place is GPs staple so was excited to drop by on Wednesday night.There was no wait- very good. I had been worried about this so called 3x around 6:45pm to see how long it was before heading over. No one picked up and their answering service basically hangs up on you. I ordered the Daniela and he ordered the brisket pizza. Mine came out a good 7 minutes before his. I noticed immediately that about 40% of the crust was charred to the point of being inedible. To top that off, the spinach topping my pizza was the same. It was literally a black piece of ash and when I picked a leaf up or crumbled in my hands. The cheese blend was very good (mozzarella and Parmesan) but the pizza was just not good. To top it off, parts of the center were soggy and didn't hold the toppings when I grabbed a slice. When the brisket pizza came out a few minutes later I noticed immediately that it was cooked perfectly. The crust was edible and delicious. I was bummed that mine didn't come out this way especially since it seemed like a classic. All I can say is they probably put our orders in together and maybe his needed a little longer in the oven. Mine was most likely getting over cooked while his needed a few more minutes. Hence the gap in time between both of our orders coming out and the reason why mine was half done by the time his came out.I was really disappointed but the good thing to know is at least the brisket pizza was cooked well. I know there is a good meal at Paulie Gees but I feel like we were jipped.Also, great touch that Paulie himself came in to greet all the diners. He was super friendly and it brings a family quality to the place. This is maybe one of the main reasons I'd come back.",3.0
"Delicious!! Definitely made my top 3 favorite pizza  places (the others being robertas and best pizza). We've been meaning to come forever but the line is always so long.

I would highly recommend this tactic to those of you who have been meaning to come and haven't been able to due to the wait -- the food will be worth it. We ordered the hellboy, ricotta be kidding me and the hot honey ice cream Sunday for dessert. The hellboy was our fave. It was basically a pepperoni pizza with hot honey lined under the cheese.

"My husband and I visited Paulie Gee's about two years ago and he still dreams of the Hellboy. This time we ordered the Hellboy and Cherry Jones.  The Hellboy was great but just a touch too sweet for me.  The hot honey adds a little kick but is definitely not too hot.  My husband will tell you it is the best pizza he has ever had (saying a lot since he was raised in the Bronx).  The Cherry Jones on the other hand was way too sweet for both of us.  I couldn't taste anything other then honey.  My husband embarrassed me by telling the waitress we didn't like it.  She offered us a replacement.  We ordered the Ricky Ricotta.  It was alright.  I was shocked because the ricotta was not warm.  The crust at Paulie Gee's is the perfect texture.  However, two of our three pizzas were too charred for my taste.  I must mention Paulie walks around all the tables to make sure everyone is enjoying.  Love it!  The restaurant is too dark and loud for my taste.",3.0

"Absolutely delicious. Huge selection of pies - good for meatatarians, vegetarians, and even vegans. Wood fire oven delivers the signature light smoke and char. Dough is absolutely tender and springy. They even let the pizza rest afterwards so the cheese sets and you don't burn the crap out of your mouth.Hellboy- spicy pepperoni with hot honey. Absolute classic pizza. Hot honey perfectly blankets the spicy meat. Super simple, absolutely delicious. Get two, trust meRicotta/sausage pie - similar to one above, hot honey included. However ricotta and sausage are a welcome addition.

"One of the challenges of  being vegan is getting your friends/family to be open to the idea of trying vegan food.I have never had Vegan Pizza before and I usually try to try a restaurant first before recommending to anyone especially a non vegan but I took a chance.When we first arrived we were having trouble picking something since everything was foreign to us. Someone sitting next to us saw our struggle and took us to try the  IN Ricotta Da Vegan so we did. AMAZING!! My non vegan date was impressed and I was so happy.Thanks Paulie Gee for making me looking good Whew! One pie (6 small slices) goes for 16 bucks . Its small, nice ambiance I would say its a little darkI would go again!Menu like here ------ pauliegee.com/greenpoint… xoxoC.",4.0
"Some of the best za in the city, bar none. The lady and I traveled far and wide for it since we'd heard such great things. It was a Friday night so the restaurant was predictably packed. There's not much in the form of a waiting area, which particularly sucked given how freezing the weather was, but we had a feeling the pie would be well worth the wait (plus we also got to watch a tipsy couple aggressively suck face up close and personal which was an unexpected but enjoyable twist).The vibe was cool, featuring low--lighting, a huge and beautiful custom brick oven, and trendy attractive people who's favorite bands you've never heard of.When we finally were seated I was stoked to see the menu offered a huge variety of pies with all sorts of niche toppings AND vegan options(I personally don't give two damns about veganism but they presented them in an unpretentious way so I was cool with it). We eventually decided to go with the Hell Boy and the Prokypineapple, both of which were amazing, and I'm looking forward to going back and further chowing my way down the menu.Go here.",5.0
"After a 2-hours wait on a weekend for a party of 2, we finally got a table at the renowned pizza shop in Brooklyn. After having one of the best pizzas of all time at Little Isabella located in Baltimore, I was on the mission to find its companion in NYC. Overhyped as we suspected, Paulie Gee had nothing on Little Isabella! Perhaps, it was the quirky blend of sweet and savory flavors, but with that 2-hour wait, we surely did not have a pleasing experience.We ordered two pies: HellBoy and Greenpointer. HellBoy: Fresh Mozzarella, Italian Tomatoes, Berkshire Sopressata Piccante, Parmigiano Reggiano and Mike's HOT HoneyGreenpointer:Fresh Mozzarella, Baby Arugula, Olive Oil, Fresh Lemon Juice and Shaved Parmigiano ReggianoWe didn't really enjoy the sweetness of the honey in the HellBoy or the sourness of the lemon juice in the Greenpointer. Fresh, as we saw them make each pie to order, I definitely thought the doughiness of the pizza wasn't anything spectacular. In terms of service, I think it was pretty solid. Our waiter was patient and helpful. As a surprise, Paulie Gee himself introduced himself to just about every table, making it feel quite personable. In all, I definitely wouldn't return back to this pizzeria, especially with that crazy wait. During that 2-hour wait and 1.5-hour dining time, I can drive down to Baltimore and get some Little Isabella for half the price and no wait!",3.0
"3.5 stars for this pizza joint hidden behind a HUGE wooden door all the way down Franklin streetCrust was good with a nice char on the hellboy but the crust of the greenpoint pizza seemed a bit underdone We were quoted a 1.5 hour wait at 8pm for 3 on a Saturday but we were lucky that people in front of us hadn't returned so we were seated right away! (so don't be discouraged)---hellboy: everything was good about this except that spicy honey! Should of gone with a more classic margherita style pizza instead---greenpoint: fresh arugula, with a bit too much lemon juice, so nothing special NOTE: they don't have pepper flakes, only chili oil",4.0
"If you want great pizza and the right atmosphere look no further than Paulie Gee's. We sat at the bar (luckily) and avoided a two hour wait.  The pizza choices are numerous, with some very creative options. There were three of us and we started with two pies. Would have been content but it was so good we ordered a third.The texture. The crust. The toppings. Hard pressed to mention anything I didn't like. I love pizza and this place is right up there with the best. That includes many pizzerias throughout Italy.Paulie stopped by for a chat and he has a fantastic personality. Great stories and it is obvious that he loves what he does and holds him team to very high standards.He was also kind enough to give me an official Paulie Gee's pin and a limoncello. A very nice touch!Make sure you check out the pizza oven in the back. It's a small,cozy place so don't pass this place up in you are in NY.",5.0
I take my pizza very seriously. The vegan pizza is so good here that if they didn't tell you it was vegan you would have no clue. I had the pie with vegan sausage and shared a few others with friends. It was all out of this world. I can't wait to go back again.,5.0
"There's a LOT of really great pizza in NYC, that's nothing new. But combine amazing pizza with friendly, caring service and a killer ambiance, and Paulie Gee's has a leg up on a lot of the other heavy hitters. The wait can be crazy, but we came in on a Tuesday night and it was half empty. I guess the key is to come when there's post-blizzard sludge everywhere and no one else wants to go out. Paulie Gee was there as I'm told he usually is, weaving around the space with his cup of coffee and stopping at literally every table. For us, he offered to curate our pizza order and who were we to argue? Read on for what Paulie Gee himself recommends:- The Greenpointer: according to Paulie, basically like eating a salad due to the piles of fresh baby arugula on top. - The Mo Cheeks: My personal favorite of the meal. The pickled onions on there are a nice surprise, and give a nice kick to the rest of the ingredients. - The Monte Cristo: OK, so this is probably something I would never think to order myself, but I'm glad it came out for us because it's actually super tasty. It comes with Canadian bacon and a drizzle of maple syrup, which I know sounds weird but trust me (or rather, trust Paulie). - I didn't catch the name of the last pizza, but it was one of the best and after peeking at the menu again I think it might have been the Hellboy. It was piled high with the tastiest Berkshire Sopressata, and it was perfect with the side of Mike's hot honey (which you haven't tried on pizza you must immediately). They asked if we wanted a dessert pizza but at that point we were stuffed to the gills. It was one of the best New York pizza experiences I've had so far, and the service is what really puts them above and beyond. I'm going to run for vice-president of the Paulie Gee fanclub soon!",5.0
"Came here a few days ago with my friend after work. Very dark inside, took some time for my eyeballs to adjust lol. We started off with some beers and then went with the Hellboy which was AMAZING. The hot honey makes a difference! Then we went with a vegan pie since neither one of us was particularly full. We ordered one with spinach, sea salt and garlic on it (sorry don't remember the name!) It was OK, not that memorable. The standout is by far Hellboy, the crust for both pizzas was SUPER THIN, firm and didn't fall apart on me. We both liked it. I took off a star for the spinach pie being nothing special and that it's a bit on the pricey side. Overall, I think I'll be back to try the other pizzas on the menu!",4.0
"Maybe we came on an off night, but we didn't care too much about the pizza and it was definitely not the best we've had. My friend wanted to celebrate her belated birthday at Paulie Gee's and so we did. We ordered 3 pies (Greenpointer, Ricotta Be Kidding Me, and The Hometown Brisket). I think the Hometown Brisket was our favorite only because of the BBQ sauce. Other than that, there wasn't much brisket pieces on the pizza. Ricotta Be Kidding Me was okay. The Greenpointer was all greens so that balanced our meal a little bit. I hear people waiting for hours to get a seat here and right now I'm just wondering where all the hype went? We came when they were opening, so thank goodness we didn't wait on line for this...cause it wouldn't have been worth it. FYI: There's no sign outside that says ""Paulie Gee's"". You just have to look by the address number ""60"" in order to find this place. I actually walked passed it while we were trying to find it. Also, use your flash on your phones to read the menu. I really liked the rustic interior but it was literally pitch black in there.",3.0
"Zagat rated the hellboy as the best pizza in NYC. Wow! Big call Zagat... We had to try! We would say it was delicious... But I would have to say Marta is equal of not just ahead. We got here at 6:40 and had to wait over an hr to sit at the bar. When getting here service was prompt and food was great! We ordered the hellboy and the hellified porkpie white and I have to say it was fresh, full of flavor and great value. My only critique would be more hot suppressa on the hellified and take numbers at the door! It's a little unreasonable to ask people to wait 90 mins and not offer to call when table it ready. Either way it was great but probably won't be crossing the river to wait another 90 mins.",4.0
"If there was ever a restaurant that inspires the need for #PiDay (3.14) to be everyday, it is Paulie Gee's. The pizza is a true art, and every bite is important, from the center to the crust crust.  PG is located in pizza heaven, or right near the water on Greenpoint Ave if you want a Google Map friendly address.Read it on my blog: highclasstohighlifes.com…As you'll see below I'm constantly on the proscuitt of happiness but this time we went for a different ham, Canadian bacon, and on the Monte Cristo. You bet it counted towards happiness. This pizza combines maple syrup drizzle and gouda with the ham. Yes, yes and more yes. Paulie asked if we had butter on the crust...sadly, no. SO MUCH REGRET....that I'll be back in no time to try it. You'll notice on the menu that they have a brisket pizza that features Hometown BBQ -- I love this local BK collaboration. You can get sauced the other way too with Greenpoint local brews!Anyway, I have nearly eaten my way through the entire menu (still need to do a bit of adventuring on the vegan side, every time I get close, I just want meat...) and I have been very pleased with every slice thus far. Therefore my advice to you is go with the pizza that's toppings are most appealing...or grab a handful of friends and share, then you can try multiple pizzas!The man, who is not a myth, but definitely a legend is often found inside checking in on tables, ensuring quality control and getting to know the patrons. He loved my last Instagram post that did a little play words...sharing that I was on the prosciutt of happiness with his King Henry Classic. He's always all smiles and usually wearing a great hat, he is Paulie Gee himself. Paulie Gee's - High Class to High Lifes If you really knead to get delivery or pickup, you'll have to look elsewhere for now though. The only way to leave Paulie Gee's with a to-go box is with leftovers. Rumor has it that a slice joint is opening up nearby though! I'm counting down the days, hours and minutes. Want to keep drooling? Read the menu!Pro Tip: Grab dinner at Paulie Gee's then walk straight out on the water in Greenpoint to Transmitter park or the outlook. Maybe even catch a sunset and BYO night cap!",5.0
"My old pal Carlos and I visited Paulie Gee's last night and had a great meal. I'm accustomed to going with the ol' vegan girlfriend and have a tradition where we split two pies from their extensive vegan selection, so we can try two different types of pies. The vegan and non-vegan selections are both extensive; each category has at least a half dozen kinds of pies, including oil bases, white slices, marinara, spinach-based, spicy honey and barbecue sauce foundations. The pies are aesthetically pleasing to every sense, well, every sense except sound. It's usually better when sound isn't a factor. At least when you're talking about food. When you're talking about music, sound is obviously a very important sense to talk about. I may go as far as to say that in a conversation about music, sound is the only sense that matters.I was excited to go with Carlos because I was going to get to eat their meat and actual cheese. The Paulie Gee's brisket is lean and delicious. Their pickled red onions possess a truly memorable tang and are worth spending a couple buck to add on to pretty much any pie. The ricotta dollops on the Ricky Ricotta feel more like bursts of a cream sauce than regular old cheese. Interestingly, the dairy and non-dairy ricotta cheeses are almost indecipherable in quality, which goes to show that Paulie Gee's knows what's up. Carlos and I were pleased to compliment the trad Italian flavors of the Ricky Ricotta with a tangy Barbecue Brisket pie. I'm psyched to go with a fellow omnivore again, because there are tons of other flavor combos I'm eager to try. New Yorkers, such as myself, are notorious for being dicks about the quality of pizza dough. It's the dough that invalidates the Chicago Deep Dish's false aspiration to pizza status. I can't stand Sicilian pizza either, which is a controversial take in Nueva York. Anyhow, no matter how well adorned a Paulie Gee's pie is, its base--the crust--is its most distinct and wonderful element. The crust is thin but springy, and always a little charred. It's pretty much naan bread, which is either a very luck coincidence or a visionary innovation. Naan bread, as you know, is lit, and, as it turns out, it is the perfect surface upon which various pizza ingredients should be placed and/or spread to mingle harmoniously.I've visited Paulie Gee's a number of times, and there's a bit of narrative that forms around my visits. The first time I tried to go, it was around noon, and my gf and I made the unpleasant discovery that Paulie Gee's does not open til 5 PM. The next time, we rolled up in a deep crew of six and had to wait about two to three hours for a table for six. If you find yourself in that position, you'll be okay though because there are plenty of bars around. There's also the water/skyline, mere yards away and a nice record store a block away.The gf and I have gone a few other times and it's always been great--except for the one time that a camera crew was shooting a special on Paulie Gee's vegan options. My girlfriend and I were in the shot all throughout our meal, and we were fighting (as subtly as possible) for the duration of our meal. I was taken aback and somewhat miffed when the producers of the show asked to do a talking head with us outside. The tension was palpable but they still insisted on interviewing us. I really do believe that you should foot the bill if you're going to interview someone for your television series or web series or gratuitously long Yelp review or whatever. At LEAST commission me to write a song for the soundtrack.In closing, I would like to offer a lil sum sum for the ladies. Are you interested in grandfatherly, charmingly blue collar, short men whose personalities closely resemble those of most Robert De Niro characters--but only in David O. Russel movies? If you do, and might want to be possibly hit on by a man of this caliber, you will love Paulie Gee's. At all times, Paulie Gee's eponymous Pizza Architect and Entrepreneur, Paulie Gee, stalks the narrow spaces between tables, checking in with customers--particularly of the reasonably attractive female demographic--and asks them how their food is, making small talk and thanking them for their patronage. I think this is cool. I would do the same if I were in his position, so don't take this the wrong way. Central to Paulie Gee's game is his ability to recommend a pizza place in seemingly every zip code on the planet and his inclination to tell you (the lady in question) the name of the dude who works there/owns the place, and to tell you (still the lady in question) to tell the dude (who owns the pizza place) to say that he (Paulie Gee) says hi.

"Some of the best za in the city, bar none. The lady and I traveled far and wide for it since we'd heard such great things. It was a Friday night so the restaurant was predictably packed. There's not much in the form of a waiting area, which particularly sucked given how freezing the weather was, but we had a feeling the pie would be well worth the wait (plus we also got to watch a tipsy couple aggressively suck face up close and personal which was an unexpected but enjoyable twist).The vibe was cool, featuring low--lighting, a huge and beautiful custom brick oven, and trendy attractive people who's favorite bands you've never heard of.When we finally were seated I was stoked to see the menu offered a huge variety of pies with all sorts of niche toppings AND vegan options(I personally don't give two damns about veganism but they presented them in an unpretentious way so I was cool with it).

"After a 2-hours wait on a weekend for a party of 2, we finally got a table at the renowned pizza shop in Brooklyn. After having one of the best pizzas of all time at Little Isabella located in Baltimore, I was on the mission to find its companion in NYC. Overhyped as we suspected, Paulie Gee had nothing on Little Isabella! Perhaps, it was the quirky blend of sweet and savory flavors, but with that 2-hour wait, we surely did not have a pleasing experience.We ordered two pies: HellBoy and Greenpointer. HellBoy: Fresh Mozzarella, Italian Tomatoes, Berkshire Sopressata Piccante, Parmigiano Reggiano and Mike's HOT HoneyGreenpointer:Fresh Mozzarella, Baby Arugula, Olive Oil, Fresh Lemon Juice and Shaved Parmigiano ReggianoWe didn't really enjoy the sweetness of the honey in the HellBoy or the sourness of the lemon juice in the Greenpointer. Fresh, as we saw them make each pie to order, I definitely thought the doughiness of the pizza wasn't anything spectacular. In terms of service, I think it was pretty solid. Our waiter was patient and helpful. As a surprise, Paulie Gee himself introduced himself to just about every table, making it feel quite personable. In all, I definitely wouldn't return back to this pizzeria, especially with that crazy wait. During that 2-hour wait and 1.5-hour dining time, I can drive down to Baltimore and get some Little Isabella for half the price and no wait!",3.0

I take my pizza very seriously. The vegan pizza is so good here that if they didn't tell you it was vegan you would have no clue. I had the pie with vegan sausage and shared a few others with friends. It was all out of this world. I can't wait to go back again.,5.0
"There's a LOT of really great pizza in NYC, that's nothing new. But combine amazing pizza with friendly, caring service and a killer ambiance, and Paulie Gee's has a leg up on a lot of the other heavy hitters. The wait can be crazy, but we came in on a Tuesday night and it was half empty. I guess the key is to come when there's post-blizzard sludge everywhere and no one else wants to go out. Paulie Gee was there as I'm told he usually is, weaving around the space with his cup of coffee and stopping at literally every table. For us, he offered to curate our pizza order and who were we to argue? Read on for what Paulie Gee himself recommends:- The Greenpointer: according to Paulie, basically like eating a salad due to the piles of fresh baby arugula on top. - The Mo Cheeks: My personal favorite of the meal. The pickled onions on there are a nice surprise, and give a nice kick to the rest of the ingredients. - The Monte Cristo: OK, so this is probably something I would never think to order myself, but I'm glad it came out for us because it's actually super tasty. It comes with Canadian bacon and a drizzle of maple syrup, which I know sounds weird but trust me (or rather, trust Paulie). - I didn't catch the name of the last pizza, but it was one of the best and after peeking at the menu again I think it might have been the Hellboy. It was piled high with the tastiest Berkshire Sopressata, and it was perfect with the side of Mike's hot honey (which you haven't tried on pizza you must immediately). They asked if we wanted a dessert pizza but at that point we were stuffed to the gills. It was one of the best New York pizza experiences I've had so far, and the service is what really puts them above and beyond. I'm going to run for vice-president of the Paulie Gee fanclub soon!",5.0
"Came here a few days ago with my friend after work. Very dark inside, took some time for my eyeballs to adjust lol. We started off with some beers and then went with the Hellboy which was AMAZING. The hot honey makes a difference! Then we went with a vegan pie since neither one of us was particularly full. We ordered one with spinach, sea salt and garlic on it (sorry don't remember the name!) It was OK, not that memorable. The standout is by far Hellboy, the crust for both pizzas was SUPER THIN, firm and didn't fall apart on me. We both liked it. I took off a star for the spinach pie being nothing special and that it's a bit on the pricey side. Overall, I think I'll be back to try the other pizzas on the menu!",4.0
"Maybe we came on an off night, but we didn't care too much about the pizza and it was definitely not the best we've had. My friend wanted to celebrate her belated birthday at Paulie Gee's and so we did. We ordered 3 pies (Greenpointer, Ricotta Be Kidding Me, and The Hometown Brisket). I think the Hometown Brisket was our favorite only because of the BBQ sauce. Other than that, there wasn't much brisket pieces on the pizza. Ricotta Be Kidding Me was okay. The Greenpointer was all greens so that balanced our meal a little bit. I hear people waiting for hours to get a seat here and right now I'm just wondering where all the hype went? We came when they were opening, so thank goodness we didn't wait on line for this...cause it wouldn't have been worth it. FYI: There's no sign outside that says ""Paulie Gee's"". You just have to look by the address number ""60"" in order to find this place. I actually walked passed it while we were trying to find it. Also, use your flash on your phones to read the menu. I really liked the rustic interior but it was literally pitch black in there.",3.0
"Zagat rated the hellboy as the best pizza in NYC. Wow! Big call Zagat... We had to try! We would say it was delicious... But I would have to say Marta is equal of not just ahead. We got here at 6:40 and had to wait over an hr to sit at the bar. When getting here service was prompt and food was great! We ordered the hellboy and the hellified porkpie white and I have to say it was fresh, full of flavor and great value. My only critique would be more hot suppressa on the hellified and take numbers at the door! It's a little unreasonable to ask people to wait 90 mins and not offer to call when table it ready. Either way it was great but probably won't be crossing the river to wait another 90 mins.",4.0
"If there was ever a restaurant that inspires the need for #PiDay (3.14) to be everyday, it is Paulie Gee's. The pizza is a true art, and every bite is important, from the center to the crust crust.  PG is located in pizza heaven, or right near the water on Greenpoint Ave if you want a Google Map friendly address.Read it on my blog: highclasstohighlifes.com…As you'll see below I'm constantly on the proscuitt of happiness but this time we went for a different ham, Canadian bacon, and on the Monte Cristo. You bet it counted towards happiness. This pizza combines maple syrup drizzle and gouda with the ham. Yes, yes and more yes. Paulie asked if we had butter on the crust...sadly, no. SO MUCH REGRET....that I'll be back in no time to try it. You'll notice on the menu that they have a brisket pizza that features Hometown BBQ -- I love this local BK collaboration. You can get sauced the other way too with Greenpoint local brews!Anyway, I have nearly eaten my way through the entire menu (still need to do a bit of adventuring on the vegan side, every time I get close, I just want meat...) and I have been very pleased with every slice thus far. Therefore my advice to you is go with the pizza that's toppings are most appealing...or grab a handful of friends and share, then you can try multiple pizzas!The man, who is not a myth, but definitely a legend is often found inside checking in on tables, ensuring quality control and getting to know the patrons. He loved my last Instagram post that did a little play words...sharing that I was on the prosciutt of happiness with his King Henry Classic. He's always all smiles and usually wearing a great hat, he is Paulie Gee himself. Paulie Gee's - High Class to High Lifes If you really knead to get delivery or pickup, you'll have to look elsewhere for now though. The only way to leave Paulie Gee's with a to-go box is with leftovers. Rumor has it that a slice joint is opening up nearby though! I'm counting down the days, hours and minutes. Want to keep drooling? Read the menu!Pro Tip: Grab dinner at Paulie Gee's then walk straight out on the water in Greenpoint to Transmitter park or the outlook. Maybe even catch a sunset and BYO night cap!",5.0
"My old pal Carlos and I visited Paulie Gee's last night and had a great meal. I'm accustomed to going with the ol' vegan girlfriend and have a tradition where we split two pies from their extensive vegan selection, so we can try two different types of pies. The vegan and non-vegan selections are both extensive; each category has at least a half dozen kinds of pies, including oil bases, white slices, marinara, spinach-based, spicy honey and barbecue sauce foundations. The pies are aesthetically pleasing to every sense, well, every sense except sound. It's usually better when sound isn't a factor. At least when you're talking about food. When you're talking about music, sound is obviously a very important sense to talk about. I may go as far as to say that in a conversation about music, sound is the only sense that matters.I was excited to go with Carlos because I was going to get to eat their meat and actual cheese. The Paulie Gee's brisket is lean and delicious. Their pickled red onions possess a truly memorable tang and are worth spending a couple buck to add on to pretty much any pie. The ricotta dollops on the Ricky Ricotta feel more like bursts of a cream sauce than regular old cheese. Interestingly, the dairy and non-dairy ricotta cheeses are almost indecipherable in quality, which goes to show that Paulie Gee's knows what's up. Carlos and I were pleased to compliment the trad Italian flavors of the Ricky Ricotta with a tangy Barbecue Brisket pie. I'm psyched to go with a fellow omnivore again, because there are tons of other flavor combos I'm eager to try. New Yorkers, such as myself, are notorious for being dicks about the quality of pizza dough. It's the dough that invalidates the Chicago Deep Dish's false aspiration to pizza status. I can't stand Sicilian pizza either, which is a controversial take in Nueva York. Anyhow, no matter how well adorned a Paulie Gee's pie is, its base--the crust--is its most distinct and wonderful element. The crust is thin but springy, and always a little charred. It's pretty much naan bread, which is either a very luck coincidence or a visionary innovation. Naan bread, as you know, is lit, and, as it turns out, it is the perfect surface upon which various pizza ingredients should be placed and/or spread to mingle harmoniously.I've visited Paulie Gee's a number of times, and there's a bit of narrative that forms around my visits. The first time I tried to go, it was around noon, and my gf and I made the unpleasant discovery that Paulie Gee's does not open til 5 PM. The next time, we rolled up in a deep crew of six and had to wait about two to three hours for a table for six. If you find yourself in that position, you'll be okay though because there are plenty of bars around. There's also the water/skyline, mere yards away and a nice record store a block away.The gf and I have gone a few other times and it's always been great--except for the one time that a camera crew was shooting a special on Paulie Gee's vegan options. My girlfriend and I were in the shot all throughout our meal, and we were fighting (as subtly as possible) for the duration of our meal. I was taken aback and somewhat miffed when the producers of the show asked to do a talking head with us outside. The tension was palpable but they still insisted on interviewing us. I really do believe that you should foot the bill if you're going to interview someone for your television series or web series or gratuitously long Yelp review or whatever. At LEAST commission me to write a song for the soundtrack.In closing, I would like to offer a lil sum sum for the ladies. Are you interested in grandfatherly, charmingly blue collar, short men whose personalities closely resemble those of most Robert De Niro characters--but only in David O. Russel movies? If you do, and might want to be possibly hit on by a man of this caliber, you will love Paulie Gee's. At all times, Paulie Gee's eponymous Pizza Architect and Entrepreneur, Paulie Gee, stalks the narrow spaces between tables, checking in with customers--particularly of the reasonably attractive female demographic--and asks them how their food is, making small talk and thanking them for their patronage. I think this is cool. I would do the same if I were in his position, so don't take this the wrong way. Central to Paulie Gee's game is his ability to recommend a pizza place in seemingly every zip code on the planet and his inclination to tell you (the lady in question) the name of the dude who works there/owns the place, and to tell you (still the lady in question) to tell the dude (who owns the pizza place) to say that he (Paulie Gee) says hi. The Brotherhood of Pizza Mans is truly alive and well.",5.0

"I almost feel like it's blasphemy for not giving 5 stars. Finally made my way over here at Paulie Gees after way too long. Clearly this place is GPs staple so was excited to drop by on Wednesday night.There was no wait- very good. I had been worried about this so called 3x around 6:45pm to see how long it was before heading over. No one picked up and their answering service basically hangs up on you. I ordered the Daniela and he ordered the brisket pizza. Mine came out a good 7 minutes before his. I noticed immediately that about 40% of the crust was charred to the point of being inedible. To top that off, the spinach topping my pizza was the same. It was literally a black piece of ash and when I picked a leaf up or crumbled in my hands. The cheese blend was very good (mozzarella and Parmesan) but the pizza was just not good. To top it off, parts of the center were soggy and didn't hold the toppings when I grabbed a slice. When the brisket pizza came out a few minutes later I noticed immediately that it was cooked perfectly. The crust was edible and delicious. I was bummed that mine didn't come out this way especially since it seemed like a classic. All I can say is they probably put our orders in together and maybe his needed a little longer in the oven. Mine was most likely getting over cooked while his needed a few more minutes. Hence the gap in time between both of our orders coming out and the reason why mine was half done by the time his came out.I was really disappointed but the good thing to know is at least the brisket pizza was cooked well. I know there is a good meal at Paulie Gees but I feel like we were jipped.Also, great touch that Paulie himself came in to greet all the diners. He was super friendly and it brings a family quality to the place. This is maybe one of the main reasons I'd come back.",3.0
"Delicious!! Definitely made my top 3 favorite pizza  places (the others being robertas and best pizza). We've been meaning to come forever but the line is always so long. We were finally seated right away on a Friday night because we ran over as soon as they opened at 6pm. I would highly recommend this tactic to those of you who have been meaning to come and haven't been able to due to the wait -- the food will be worth it. We ordered the hellboy, ricotta be kidding me and the hot honey ice cream Sunday for dessert. The hellboy was our fave. It was basically a pepperoni pizza with hot honey lined under the cheese. I liked it more than the bees sting from Robertas but both are very good. All in all would highly recommend. As an extra plus Paulie Gee was hanging around today,though it seems like he does this quite often, going from table to table talking to the customers.",5.0
"My husband and I visited Paulie Gee's about two years ago and he still dreams of the Hellboy. This time we ordered the Hellboy and Cherry Jones.  The Hellboy was great but just a touch too sweet for me.  The hot honey adds a little kick but is definitely not too hot.  My husband will tell you it is the best pizza he has ever had (saying a lot since he was raised in the Bronx).  The Cherry Jones on the other hand was way too sweet for both of us.  I couldn't taste anything other then honey.  My husband embarrassed me by telling the waitress we didn't like it.  She offered us a replacement.  We ordered the Ricky Ricotta.  It was alright.  I was shocked because the ricotta was not warm.  The crust at Paulie Gee's is the perfect texture.  However, two of our three pizzas were too charred for my taste.  I must mention Paulie walks around all the tables to make sure everyone is enjoying.  Love it!  The restaurant is too dark and loud for my taste.",3.0
"Interesting decor, super dark inside and it was hard to read the menu. We were seated under one of the speakers, so I felt like an old person complaining about how loud the music was, but really, we came for the food. Split a salad and a Greenpointer pie, and neither disappointed. Both were served quickly, and the pie just exploded with flavor. The lemon kick was strong but not overwhelming, and the crust was perfection. Service was attentive, friendly, and efficient. Lots of menu choices for anything your palate is craving. Overall, a very good experience, and one I would look forward to enjoying again.",4.0
"New York probably takes its pizza more seriously than anywhere else in the world.  I'm sure there are 7 or 8 people reading this right now that would be willing to shiv a guy for saying something bad about their favorite slice.  With that in mind, Paulie Gee's is a pizza lover's pizza place.  They make Neapolitan style pizzas with an oven shipped in from Naples and lovingly reassembled by small, Italian elves.  From this oven, comes perfectly leopard-spotted pizzas with just the right amount of bouncy chewy dough.To top the pizza, there's a lovingly curated selection to choose from so don't you dare ask for substitutions.  Lucky for you whether you're a vegan, vegetarian, white/red pie lover, averse to spice, meat lover, or whatever!  There's at least one pie on the menu* that will make you say, ""hmmm..."".  My personal favorites are the Mo' Cheeks ($16, has guanciale and is perfect with the pickled onions) and Ricotta Be Kidding Me ($17, with tons of meat topped with adorable dollops of cottage cheese).  I've only ever had 1 pizza there that wasn't stellar and I won't tell you which one because you'll definitely judge me for choosing it in the first place.The atmosphere at Paulie Gee's is great.  It's quintessential Brooklyn.  Think dark unfinished wood walls with an eclectic collection of tables made from reclaimed wood, music consisting of a mixture of jazz, rock, and anything but top 40s.  What always makes my night is that the ACTUAL Paulie Gee walks around and talks to EVERYONE.  It doesn't matter if Keri Russell** is sitting right next to you, he will still come by and have a 5-20 minute conversation with you and your table.  My only complaint is how popular this place is.  They've stopped making pizzas to go and still, the wait is crazy.  I've never been able to get a table in less than 45 minutes unless it was late at night.  I guess that's not a bad problem to have.  I also kind of wish they would get a full liquor license and take that creative pizza combo creating mind into the cocktail realm.  I mean...Mike's Hot Honey + Whiskey?  Maybe?---------* If you can't find a pizza you like on the printed menu in the restaurant, whip out the smartphone and check out the ""secret"" menu on the website.** This actually happened.",4.0

It was piled high with the tastiest Berkshire Sopressata, and it was perfect with the side of Mike's hot honey (which you haven't tried on pizza you must immediately). They asked if we wanted a dessert pizza but at that point we were stuffed to the gills. It was one of the best New York pizza experiences I've had so far, and the service is what really puts them above and beyond. I'm going to run for vice-president of the Paulie Gee fanclub soon!",5.0
"Came here a few days ago with my friend after work. Very dark inside, took some time for my eyeballs to adjust lol. We started off with some beers and then went with the Hellboy which was AMAZING. The hot honey makes a difference! Then we went with a vegan pie since neither one of us was particularly full. We ordered one with spinach, sea salt and garlic on it (sorry don't remember the name!) It was OK, not that memorable. The standout is by far Hellboy, the crust for both pizzas was SUPER THIN, firm and didn't fall apart on me. We both liked it.

"Maybe we came on an off night, but we didn't care too much about the pizza and it was definitely not the best we've had. My friend wanted to celebrate her belated birthday at Paulie Gee's and so we did. We ordered 3 pies (Greenpointer, Ricotta Be Kidding Me, and The Hometown Brisket). I think the Hometown Brisket was our favorite only because of the BBQ sauce. Other than that, there wasn't much brisket pieces on the pizza. Ricotta Be Kidding Me was okay. The Greenpointer was all greens so that balanced our meal a little bit. I hear people waiting for hours to get a seat here and right now I'm just wondering where all the hype went? We came when they were opening, so thank goodness we didn't wait on line for this...cause it wouldn't have been worth it. FYI: There's no sign outside that says ""Paulie Gee's"".

"My old pal Carlos and I visited Paulie Gee's last night and had a great meal. I'm accustomed to going with the ol' vegan girlfriend and have a tradition where we split two pies from their extensive vegan selection, so we can try two different types of pies. The vegan and non-vegan selections are both extensive; each category has at least a half dozen kinds of pies, including oil bases, white slices, marinara, spinach-based, spicy honey and barbecue sauce foundations. The pies are aesthetically pleasing to every sense, well, every sense except sound. It's usually better when sound isn't a factor. At least when you're talking about food. When you're talking about music, sound is obviously a very important sense to talk about. I may go as far as to say that in a conversation about music, sound is the only sense that matters.I was excited to go with Carlos because I was going to get to eat their meat and actual cheese. The Paulie Gee's brisket is lean and delicious. Their pickled red onions possess a truly memorable tang and are worth spending a couple buck to add on to pretty much any pie. The ricotta dollops on the Ricky Ricotta feel more like bursts of a cream sauce than regular old cheese. Interestingly, the dairy and non-dairy ricotta cheeses are almost indecipherable in quality, which goes to show that Paulie Gee's knows what's up. Carlos and I were pleased to compliment the trad Italian flavors of the Ricky Ricotta with a tangy Barbecue Brisket pie. I'm psyched to go with a fellow omnivore again, because there are tons of other flavor combos I'm eager to try. New Yorkers, such as myself, are notorious for being dicks about the quality of pizza dough. It's the dough that invalidates the Chicago Deep Dish's false aspiration to pizza status. I can't stand Sicilian pizza either, which is a controversial take in Nueva York. Anyhow, no matter how well adorned a Paulie Gee's pie is, its base--the crust--is its most distinct and wonderful element. The crust is thin but springy, and always a little charred. It's pretty much naan bread, which is either a very luck coincidence or a visionary innovation. Naan bread, as you know, is lit, and, as it turns out, it is the perfect surface upon which various pizza ingredients should be placed and/or spread to mingle harmoniously.I've visited Paulie Gee's a number of times, and there's a bit of narrative that forms around my visits. The first time I tried to go, it was around noon, and my gf and I made the unpleasant discovery that Paulie Gee's does not open til 5 PM. The next time, we rolled up in a deep crew of six and had to wait about two to three hours for a table for six. If you find yourself in that position, you'll be okay though because there are plenty of bars around. There's also the water/skyline, mere yards away and a nice record store a block away.The gf and I have gone a few other times and it's always been great--except for the one time that a camera crew was shooting a special on Paulie Gee's vegan options. My girlfriend and I were in the shot all throughout our meal, and we were fighting (as subtly as possible) for the duration of our meal. I was taken aback and somewhat miffed when the producers of the show asked to do a talking head with us outside. The tension was palpable but they still insisted on interviewing us. I really do believe that you should foot the bill if you're going to interview someone for your television series or web series or gratuitously long Yelp review or whatever. At LEAST commission me to write a song for the soundtrack.In closing, I would like to offer a lil sum sum for the ladies. Are you interested in grandfatherly, charmingly blue collar, short men whose personalities closely resemble those of most Robert De Niro characters--but only in David O. Russel movies? If you do, and might want to be possibly hit on by a man of this caliber, you will love Paulie Gee's. At all times, Paulie Gee's eponymous Pizza Architect and Entrepreneur, Paulie Gee, stalks the narrow spaces between tables, checking in with customers--particularly of the reasonably attractive female demographic--and asks them how their food is, making small talk and thanking them for their patronage. I think this is cool. I would do the same if I were in his position, so don't take this the wrong way. Central to Paulie Gee's game is his ability to recommend a pizza place in seemingly every zip code on the planet and his inclination to tell you (the lady in question) the name of the dude who works there/owns the place, and to tell you (still the lady in question) to tell the dude (who owns the pizza place) to say that he (Paulie Gee) says hi. The Brotherhood of Pizza Mans is truly alive and well.",5.0

"I almost feel like it's blasphemy for not giving 5 stars. Finally made my way over here at Paulie Gees after way too long. Clearly this place is GPs staple so was excited to drop by on Wednesday night.There was no wait- very good. I had been worried about this so called 3x around 6:45pm to see how long it was before heading over. No one picked up and their answering service basically hangs up on you. I ordered the Daniela and he ordered the brisket pizza. Mine came out a good 7 minutes before his. I noticed immediately that about 40% of the crust was charred to the point of being inedible. To top that off, the spinach topping my pizza was the same. It was literally a black piece of ash and when I picked a leaf up or crumbled in my hands. The cheese blend was very good (mozzarella and Parmesan) but the pizza was just not good. To top it off, parts of the center were soggy and didn't hold the toppings when I grabbed a slice. When the brisket pizza came out a few minutes later I noticed immediately that it was cooked perfectly. The crust was edible and delicious. I was bummed that mine didn't come out this way especially since it seemed like a classic. All I can say is they probably put our orders in together and maybe his needed a little longer in the oven. Mine was most likely getting over cooked while his needed a few more minutes. Hence the gap in time between both of our orders coming out and the reason why mine was half done by the time his came out.I was really disappointed but the good thing to know is at least the brisket pizza was cooked well. I know there is a good meal at Paulie Gees but I feel like we were jipped.Also, great touch that Paulie himself came in to greet all the diners. He was super friendly and it brings a family quality to the place. This is maybe one of the main reasons I'd come back.",3.0
"Delicious!! Definitely made my top 3 favorite pizza  places (the others being robertas and best pizza). We've been meaning to come forever but the line is always so long. We were finally seated right away on a Friday night because we ran over as soon as they opened at 6pm. I would highly recommend this tactic to those of you who have been meaning to come and haven't been able to due to the wait -- the food will be worth it. We ordered the hellboy, ricotta be kidding me and the hot honey ice cream Sunday for dessert. The hellboy was our fave. It was basically a pepperoni pizza with hot honey lined under the cheese. I liked it more than the bees sting from Robertas but both are very good. All in all would highly recommend. As an extra plus Paulie Gee was hanging around today,though it seems like he does this quite often, going from table to table talking to the customers.",5.0
"My husband and I visited Paulie Gee's about two years ago and he still dreams of the Hellboy. This time we ordered the Hellboy and Cherry Jones.  The Hellboy was great but just a touch too sweet for me.  The hot honey adds a little kick but is definitely not too hot.  My husband will tell you it is the best pizza he has ever had (saying a lot since he was raised in the Bronx).  The Cherry Jones on the other hand was way too sweet for both of us.  I couldn't taste anything other then honey.  My husband embarrassed me by telling the waitress we didn't like it.  She offered us a replacement.  We ordered the Ricky Ricotta.  It was alright.  I was shocked because the ricotta was not warm.  The crust at Paulie Gee's is the perfect texture.  However, two of our three pizzas were too charred for my taste.  I must mention Paulie walks around all the tables to make sure everyone is enjoying.  Love it!  The restaurant is too dark and loud for my taste.",3.0
"Interesting decor, super dark inside and it was hard to read the menu. We were seated under one of the speakers, so I felt like an old person complaining about how loud the music was, but really, we came for the food. Split a salad and a Greenpointer pie, and neither disappointed. Both were served quickly, and the pie just exploded with flavor. The lemon kick was strong but not overwhelming, and the crust was perfection. Service was attentive, friendly, and efficient. Lots of menu choices for anything your palate is craving. Overall, a very good experience, and one I would look forward to enjoying again.",4.0
"New York probably takes its pizza more seriously than anywhere else in the world.  I'm sure there are 7 or 8 people reading this right now that would be willing to shiv a guy for saying something bad about their favorite slice.  With that in mind, Paulie Gee's is a pizza lover's pizza place.  They make Neapolitan style pizzas with an oven shipped in from Naples and lovingly reassembled by small, Italian elves.  From this oven, comes perfectly leopard-spotted pizzas with just the right amount of bouncy chewy dough.To top the pizza, there's a lovingly curated selection to choose from so don't you dare ask for substitutions.  Lucky for you whether you're a vegan, vegetarian, white/red pie lover, averse to spice, meat lover, or whatever!  There's at least one pie on the menu* that will make you say, ""hmmm..."".  My personal favorites are the Mo' Cheeks ($16, has guanciale and is perfect with the pickled onions) and Ricotta Be Kidding Me ($17, with tons of meat topped with adorable dollops of cottage cheese).  I've only ever had 1 pizza there that wasn't stellar and I won't tell you which one because you'll definitely judge me for choosing it in the first place.The atmosphere at Paulie Gee's is great.  It's quintessential Brooklyn.  Think dark unfinished wood walls with an eclectic collection of tables made from reclaimed wood, music consisting of a mixture of jazz, rock, and anything but top 40s.  What always makes my night is that the ACTUAL Paulie Gee walks around and talks to EVERYONE.  It doesn't matter if Keri Russell** is sitting right next to you, he will still come by and have a 5-20 minute conversation with you and your table.  My only complaint is how popular this place is.  They've stopped making pizzas to go and still, the wait is crazy.  I've never been able to get a table in less than 45 minutes unless it was late at night.  I guess that's not a bad problem to have.  I also kind of wish they would get a full liquor license and take that creative pizza combo creating mind into the cocktail realm.  I mean...Mike's Hot Honey + Whiskey?  Maybe?---------* If you can't find a pizza you like on the printed menu in the restaurant, whip out the smartphone and check out the ""secret"" menu on the website.** This actually happened.",4.0
"We've literally flown across the country to enjoy his pizza. It's that good! Walking in, the aroma of pizza cooking in a brick oven hits your nose.This is about time my stomach starts to growl. The vibe is flowing with positive energy, and the low lighting is flattering & sexy. The bar to the left is where you can order a beverage while you wait.  They have a decent beer selection. Wait times vary, but it's usually not as long as anticipated, and well worth the effort.Everyone, including the servers, seem happy to be there.Paulie Gee is the utmost host. He's always found time to come to our table with suggestions, stories, and the occasional limoncello, (his recipe of the celebratory cocktail).Talking with him, I've gathered that he makes the vegan pizza for the people, or demand for it, but he didn't seem interested in the cause. The funky bathrooms can be a challenge to use when you've had one too many! VEGAN Pies we LOVE Simply RedVegan Tomato Sauce with Tomatoes, Olive Oil.

"Absolutely delicious. Huge selection of pies - good for meatatarians, vegetarians, and even vegans. Wood fire oven delivers the signature light smoke and char. Dough is absolutely tender and springy. They even let the pizza rest afterwards so the cheese sets and you don't burn the crap out of your mouth.Hellboy- spicy pepperoni with hot honey. Absolute classic pizza. Hot honey perfectly blankets the spicy meat. Super simple, absolutely delicious. Get two, trust meRicotta/sausage pie - similar to one above, hot honey included. However ricotta and sausage are a welcome addition.

"One of the challenges of  being vegan is getting your friends/family to be open to the idea of trying vegan food.I have never had Vegan Pizza before and I usually try to try a restaurant first before recommending to anyone especially a non vegan but I took a chance.When we first arrived we were having trouble picking something since everything was foreign to us. Someone sitting next to us saw our struggle and took us to try the  IN Ricotta Da Vegan so we did. AMAZING!! My non vegan date was impressed and I was so happy.Thanks Paulie Gee for making me looking good Whew! One pie (6 small slices) goes for 16 bucks . Its small, nice ambiance I would say its a little darkI would go again!Menu like here ------ pauliegee.com/greenpoint… xoxoC.",4.0
"Some of the best za in the city, bar none. The lady and I traveled far and wide for it since we'd heard such great things. It was a Friday night so the restaurant was predictably packed. There's not much in the form of a waiting area, which particularly sucked given how freezing the weather was, but we had a feeling the pie would be well worth the wait (plus we also got to watch a tipsy couple aggressively suck face up close and personal which was an unexpected but enjoyable twist).The vibe was cool, featuring low--lighting, a huge and beautiful custom brick oven, and trendy attractive people who's favorite bands you've never heard of.When we finally were seated I was stoked to see the menu offered a huge variety of pies with all sorts of niche toppings AND vegan options(I personally don't give two damns about veganism but they presented them in an unpretentious way so I was cool with it). We eventually decided to go with the Hell Boy and the Prokypineapple, both of which were amazing, and I'm looking forward to going back and further chowing my way down the menu.Go here.",5.0
"After a 2-hours wait on a weekend for a party of 2, we finally got a table at the renowned pizza shop in Brooklyn. After having one of the best pizzas of all time at Little Isabella located in Baltimore, I was on the mission to find its companion in NYC. Overhyped as we suspected, Paulie Gee had nothing on Little Isabella! Perhaps, it was the quirky blend of sweet and savory flavors, but with that 2-hour wait, we surely did not have a pleasing experience.We ordered two pies: HellBoy and Greenpointer. HellBoy: Fresh Mozzarella, Italian Tomatoes, Berkshire Sopressata Piccante, Parmigiano Reggiano and Mike's HOT HoneyGreenpointer:Fresh Mozzarella, Baby Arugula, Olive Oil, Fresh Lemon Juice and Shaved Parmigiano ReggianoWe didn't really enjoy the sweetness of the honey in the HellBoy or the sourness of the lemon juice in the Greenpointer. Fresh, as we saw them make each pie to order, I definitely thought the doughiness of the pizza wasn't anything spectacular. In terms of service, I think it was pretty solid. Our waiter was patient and helpful. As a surprise, Paulie Gee himself introduced himself to just about every table, making it feel quite personable. In all, I definitely wouldn't return back to this pizzeria, especially with that crazy wait. During that 2-hour wait and 1.5-hour dining time, I can drive down to Baltimore and get some Little Isabella for half the price and no wait!",3.0
"3.5 stars for this pizza joint hidden behind a HUGE wooden door all the way down Franklin streetCrust was good with a nice char on the hellboy but the crust of the greenpoint pizza seemed a bit underdone We were quoted a 1.5 hour wait at 8pm for 3 on a Saturday but we were lucky that people in front of us hadn't returned so we were seated right away! (so don't be discouraged)---hellboy: everything was good about this except that spicy honey! Should of gone with a more classic margherita style pizza instead---greenpoint: fresh arugula, with a bit too much lemon juice, so nothing special NOTE: they don't have pepper flakes, only chili oil",4.0
"If you want great pizza and the right atmosphere look no further than Paulie Gee's. We sat at the bar (luckily) and avoided a two hour wait.  The pizza choices are numerous, with some very creative options. There were three of us and we started with two pies. Would have been content but it was so good we ordered a third.The texture. The crust. The toppings. Hard pressed to mention anything I didn't like. I love pizza and this place is right up there with the best. That includes many pizzerias throughout Italy.Paulie stopped by for a chat and he has a fantastic personality. Great stories and it is obvious that he loves what he does and holds him team to very high standards.He was also kind enough to give me an official Paulie Gee's pin and a limoncello. A very nice touch!Make sure you check out the pizza oven in the back. It's a small,cozy place so don't pass this place up in you are in NY.",5.0
I take my pizza very seriously. The vegan pizza is so good here that if they didn't tell you it was vegan you would have no clue. I had the pie with vegan sausage and shared a few others with friends. It was all out of this world. I can't wait to go back again.,5.0
"There's a LOT of really great pizza in NYC, that's nothing new. But combine amazing pizza with friendly, caring service and a killer ambiance, and Paulie Gee's has a leg up on a lot of the other heavy hitters. The wait can be crazy, but we came in on a Tuesday night and it was half empty. I guess the key is to come when there's post-blizzard sludge everywhere and no one else wants to go out. Paulie Gee was there as I'm told he usually is, weaving around the space with his cup of coffee and stopping at literally every table. For us, he offered to curate our pizza order and who were we to argue? Read on for what Paulie Gee himself recommends:- The Greenpointer: according to Paulie, basically like eating a salad due to the piles of fresh baby arugula on top. - The Mo Cheeks: My personal favorite of the meal. The pickled onions on there are a nice surprise, and give a nice kick to the rest of the ingredients. - The Monte Cristo: OK, so this is probably something I would never think to order myself, but I'm glad it came out for us because it's actually super tasty.

The first time I tried to go, it was around noon, and my gf and I made the unpleasant discovery that Paulie Gee's does not open til 5 PM. The next time, we rolled up in a deep crew of six and had to wait about two to three hours for a table for six.

My girlfriend and I were in the shot all throughout our meal, and we were fighting (as subtly as possible) for the duration of our meal. I was taken aback and somewhat miffed when the producers of the show asked to do a talking head with us outside. The tension was palpable but they still insisted on interviewing us.

"I almost feel like it's blasphemy for not giving 5 stars. Finally made my way over here at Paulie Gees after way too long. Clearly this place is GPs staple so was excited to drop by on Wednesday night.There was no wait- very good. I had been worried about this so called 3x around 6:45pm to see how long it was before heading over. No one picked up and their answering service basically hangs up on you. I ordered the Daniela and he ordered the brisket pizza. Mine came out a good 7 minutes before his. I noticed immediately that about 40% of the crust was charred to the point of being inedible. To top that off, the spinach topping my pizza was the same. It was literally a black piece of ash and when I picked a leaf up or crumbled in my hands. The cheese blend was very good (mozzarella and Parmesan) but the pizza was just not good. To top it off, parts of the center were soggy and didn't hold the toppings when I grabbed a slice. When the brisket pizza came out a few minutes later I noticed immediately that it was cooked perfectly. The crust was edible and delicious. I was bummed that mine didn't come out this way especially since it seemed like a classic. All I can say is they probably put our orders in together and maybe his needed a little longer in the oven. Mine was most likely getting over cooked while his needed a few more minutes. Hence the gap in time between both of our orders coming out and the reason why mine was half done by the time his came out.I was really disappointed but the good thing to know is at least the brisket pizza was cooked well. I know there is a good meal at Paulie Gees but I feel like we were jipped.Also, great touch that Paulie himself came in to greet all the diners. He was super friendly and it brings a family quality to the place. This is maybe one of the main reasons I'd come back.",3.0

I would highly recommend this tactic to those of you who have been meaning to come and haven't been able to due to the wait -- the food will be worth it. We ordered the hellboy, ricotta be kidding me and the hot honey ice cream Sunday for dessert. The hellboy was our fave. It was basically a pepperoni pizza with hot honey lined under the cheese. I liked it more than the bees sting from Robertas but both are very good. All in all would highly recommend.

"My husband and I visited Paulie Gee's about two years ago and he still dreams of the Hellboy. This time we ordered the Hellboy and Cherry Jones.  The Hellboy was great but just a touch too sweet for me.  The hot honey adds a little kick but is definitely not too hot.  My husband will tell you it is the best pizza he has ever had (saying a lot since he was raised in the Bronx).  The Cherry Jones on the other hand was way too sweet for both of us.  I couldn't taste anything other then honey.  My husband embarrassed me by telling the waitress we didn't like it.  She offered us a replacement.  We ordered the Ricky Ricotta.  It was alright.  I was shocked because the ricotta was not warm.  The crust at Paulie Gee's is the perfect texture.  However, two of our three pizzas were too charred for my taste.  I must mention Paulie walks around all the tables to make sure everyone is enjoying.  Love it!  The restaurant is too dark and loud for my taste.",3.0

"New York probably takes its pizza more seriously than anywhere else in the world.  I'm sure there are 7 or 8 people reading this right now that would be willing to shiv a guy for saying something bad about their favorite slice.  With that in mind, Paulie Gee's is a pizza lover's pizza place.  They make Neapolitan style pizzas with an oven shipped in from Naples and lovingly reassembled by small, Italian elves.  From this oven, comes perfectly leopard-spotted pizzas with just the right amount of bouncy chewy dough.To top the pizza, there's a lovingly curated selection to choose from so don't you dare ask for substitutions.  Lucky for you whether you're a vegan, vegetarian, white/red pie lover, averse to spice, meat lover, or whatever!  There's at least one pie on the menu* that will make you say, ""hmmm..."".  My personal favorites are the Mo' Cheeks ($16, has guanciale and is perfect with the pickled onions) and Ricotta Be Kidding Me ($17, with tons of meat topped with adorable dollops of cottage cheese).  I've only ever had 1 pizza there that wasn't stellar and I won't tell you which one because you'll definitely judge me for choosing it in the first place.The atmosphere at Paulie Gee's is great.  It's quintessential Brooklyn.  Think dark unfinished wood walls with an eclectic collection of tables made from reclaimed wood, music consisting of a mixture of jazz, rock, and anything but top 40s.  What always makes my night is that the ACTUAL Paulie Gee walks around and talks to EVERYONE.  It doesn't matter if Keri Russell** is sitting right next to you, he will still come by and have a 5-20 minute conversation with you and your table.  My only complaint is how popular this place is.  They've stopped making pizzas to go and still, the wait is crazy.  I've never been able to get a table in less than 45 minutes unless it was late at night.  I guess that's not a bad problem to have.  I also kind of wish they would get a full liquor license and take that creative pizza combo creating mind into the cocktail realm.  I mean...Mike's Hot Honey + Whiskey?  Maybe?---------* If you can't find a pizza you like on the printed menu in the restaurant, whip out the smartphone and check out the ""secret"" menu on the website.** This actually happened.",4.0
"We've literally flown across the country to enjoy his pizza. It's that good! Walking in, the aroma of pizza cooking in a brick oven hits your nose.This is about time my stomach starts to growl. The vibe is flowing with positive energy, and the low lighting is flattering & sexy. The bar to the left is where you can order a beverage while you wait.  They have a decent beer selection. Wait times vary, but it's usually not as long as anticipated, and well worth the effort.Everyone, including the servers, seem happy to be there.Paulie Gee is the utmost host. He's always found time to come to our table with suggestions, stories, and the occasional limoncello, (his recipe of the celebratory cocktail).Talking with him, I've gathered that he makes the vegan pizza for the people, or demand for it, but he didn't seem interested in the cause. The funky bathrooms can be a challenge to use when you've had one too many! VEGAN Pies we LOVE Simply RedVegan Tomato Sauce with Tomatoes, Olive Oil. Vidalia Onions, Garlic, Basil, Salt and PepperVegan Daniela SpinaciBaby Spinach, Olive Oil, Fresh Sliced Garlic, Mild Aleppo Chili Oil and Sea SaltIn Ricotta Da VeganVegan Tomato Sauce, House Made Vegan Sausage, Post-oven House Made Cashew Ricotta Dollops, Baby Arugula and Extra Virgin Olive OilWith many return visits, we've yet to have a negative experience.There has been noise over the years of Paulie Giannone opening a Portland outpost, but it has yet to materialize. Meanwhile, I'll dream of his pizza.",5.0
"Absolutely delicious. Huge selection of pies - good for meatatarians, vegetarians, and even vegans. Wood fire oven delivers the signature light smoke and char. Dough is absolutely tender and springy. They even let the pizza rest afterwards so the cheese sets and you don't burn the crap out of your mouth.Hellboy- spicy pepperoni with hot honey. Absolute classic pizza. Hot honey perfectly blankets the spicy meat. Super simple, absolutely delicious. Get two, trust meRicotta/sausage pie - similar to one above, hot honey included. However ricotta and sausage are a welcome addition. While chunks of roasted garlic are an excellent accentSo many other pies, go try them for yourself.Big lines, put your name down and go drink at browerij lane.

"One of the challenges of  being vegan is getting your friends/family to be open to the idea of trying vegan food.I have never had Vegan Pizza before and I usually try to try a restaurant first before recommending to anyone especially a non vegan but I took a chance.When we first arrived we were having trouble picking something since everything was foreign to us. Someone sitting next to us saw our struggle and took us to try the  IN Ricotta Da Vegan so we did. AMAZING!! My non vegan date was impressed and I was so happy.Thanks Paulie Gee for making me looking good Whew! One pie (6 small slices) goes for 16 bucks . Its small, nice ambiance I would say its a little darkI would go again!Menu like here ------ pauliegee.com/greenpoint… xoxoC.",4.0
"Some of the best za in the city, bar none. The lady and I traveled far and wide for it since we'd heard such great things. It was a Friday night so the restaurant was predictably packed. There's not much in the form of a waiting area, which particularly sucked given how freezing the weather was, but we had a feeling the pie would be well worth the wait (plus we also got to watch a tipsy couple aggressively suck face up close and personal which was an unexpected but enjoyable twist).The vibe was cool, featuring low--lighting, a huge and beautiful custom brick oven, and trendy attractive people who's favorite bands you've never heard of.When we finally were seated I was stoked to see the menu offered a huge variety of pies with all sorts of niche toppings AND vegan options(I personally don't give two damns about veganism but they presented them in an unpretentious way so I was cool with it). We eventually decided to go with the Hell Boy and the Prokypineapple, both of which were amazing, and I'm looking forward to going back and further chowing my way down the menu.Go here.",5.0
"After a 2-hours wait on a weekend for a party of 2, we finally got a table at the renowned pizza shop in Brooklyn. After having one of the best pizzas of all time at Little Isabella located in Baltimore, I was on the mission to find its companion in NYC. Overhyped as we suspected, Paulie Gee had nothing on Little Isabella! Perhaps, it was the quirky blend of sweet and savory flavors, but with that 2-hour wait, we surely did not have a pleasing experience.We ordered two pies: HellBoy and Greenpointer. HellBoy: Fresh Mozzarella, Italian Tomatoes, Berkshire Sopressata Piccante, Parmigiano Reggiano and Mike's HOT HoneyGreenpointer:Fresh Mozzarella, Baby Arugula, Olive Oil, Fresh Lemon Juice and Shaved Parmigiano ReggianoWe didn't really enjoy the sweetness of the honey in the HellBoy or the sourness of the lemon juice in the Greenpointer. Fresh, as we saw them make each pie to order, I definitely thought the doughiness of the pizza wasn't anything spectacular. In terms of service, I think it was pretty solid. Our waiter was patient and helpful. As a surprise, Paulie Gee himself introduced himself to just about every table, making it feel quite personable. In all, I definitely wouldn't return back to this pizzeria, especially with that crazy wait. During that 2-hour wait and 1.5-hour dining time, I can drive down to Baltimore and get some Little Isabella for half the price and no wait!",3.0
"3.5 stars for this pizza joint hidden behind a HUGE wooden door all the way down Franklin streetCrust was good with a nice char on the hellboy but the crust of the greenpoint pizza seemed a bit underdone We were quoted a 1.5 hour wait at 8pm for 3 on a Saturday but we were lucky that people in front of us hadn't returned so we were seated right away! (so don't be discouraged)---hellboy: everything was good about this except that spicy honey! Should of gone with a more classic margherita style pizza instead---greenpoint: fresh arugula, with a bit too much lemon juice, so nothing special NOTE: they don't have pepper flakes, only chili oil",4.0
"If you want great pizza and the right atmosphere look no further than Paulie Gee's. We sat at the bar (luckily) and avoided a two hour wait.  The pizza choices are numerous, with some very creative options. There were three of us and we started with two pies. Would have been content but it was so good we ordered a third.The texture. The crust. The toppings. Hard pressed to mention anything I didn't like. I love pizza and this place is right up there with the best. That includes many pizzerias throughout Italy.Paulie stopped by for a chat and he has a fantastic personality. Great stories and it is obvious that he loves what he does and holds him team to very high standards.He was also kind enough to give me an official Paulie Gee's pin and a limoncello. A very nice touch!Make sure you check out the pizza oven in the back. It's a small,cozy place so don't pass this place up in you are in NY.",5.0
I take my pizza very seriously. The vegan pizza is so good here that if they didn't tell you it was vegan you would have no clue. I had the pie with vegan sausage and shared a few others with friends. It was all out of this world. I can't wait to go back again.,5.0
"There's a LOT of really great pizza in NYC, that's nothing new. But combine amazing pizza with friendly, caring service and a killer ambiance, and Paulie Gee's has a leg up on a lot of the other heavy hitters. The wait can be crazy, but we came in on a Tuesday night and it was half empty. I guess the key is to come when there's post-blizzard sludge everywhere and no one else wants to go out. Paulie Gee was there as I'm told he usually is, weaving around the space with his cup of coffee and stopping at literally every table. For us, he offered to curate our pizza order and who were we to argue? Read on for what Paulie Gee himself recommends:- The Greenpointer: according to Paulie, basically like eating a salad due to the piles of fresh baby arugula on top. - The Mo Cheeks: My personal favorite of the meal. The pickled onions on there are a nice surprise, and give a nice kick to the rest of the ingredients. - The Monte Cristo: OK, so this is probably something I would never think to order myself, but I'm glad it came out for us because it's actually super tasty. It comes with Canadian bacon and a drizzle of maple syrup, which I know sounds weird but trust me (or rather, trust Paulie). - I didn't catch the name of the last pizza, but it was one of the best and after peeking at the menu again I think it might have been the Hellboy. It was piled high with the tastiest Berkshire Sopressata, and it was perfect with the side of Mike's hot honey (which you haven't tried on pizza you must immediately). They asked if we wanted a dessert pizza but at that point we were stuffed to the gills. It was one of the best New York pizza experiences I've had so far, and the service is what really puts them above and beyond. I'm going to run for vice-president of the Paulie Gee fanclub soon!",5.0
"Came here a few days ago with my friend after work. Very dark inside, took some time for my eyeballs to adjust lol. We started off with some beers and then went with the Hellboy which was AMAZING. The hot honey makes a difference! Then we went with a vegan pie since neither one of us was particularly full. We ordered one with spinach, sea salt and garlic on it (sorry don't remember the name!) It was OK, not that memorable. The standout is by far Hellboy, the crust for both pizzas was SUPER THIN, firm and didn't fall apart on me. We both liked it. I took off a star for the spinach pie being nothing special and that it's a bit on the pricey side. Overall, I think I'll be back to try the other pizzas on the menu!",4.0
"Maybe we came on an off night, but we didn't care too much about the pizza and it was definitely not the best we've had. My friend wanted to celebrate her belated birthday at Paulie Gee's and so we did. We ordered 3 pies (Greenpointer, Ricotta Be Kidding Me, and The Hometown Brisket). I think the Hometown Brisket was our favorite only because of the BBQ sauce. Other than that, there wasn't much brisket pieces on the pizza. Ricotta Be Kidding Me was okay. The Greenpointer was all greens so that balanced our meal a little bit. I hear people waiting for hours to get a seat here and right now I'm just wondering where all the hype went? We came when they were opening, so thank goodness we didn't wait on line for this...cause it wouldn't have been worth it. FYI: There's no sign outside that says ""Paulie Gee's"". You just have to look by the address number ""60"" in order to find this place. I actually walked passed it while we were trying to find it. Also, use your flash on your phones to read the menu. I really liked the rustic interior but it was literally pitch black in there.",3.0
"Zagat rated the hellboy as the best pizza in NYC. Wow! Big call Zagat... We had to try! We would say it was delicious... But I would have to say Marta is equal of not just ahead. We got here at 6:40 and had to wait over an hr to sit at the bar. When getting here service was prompt and food was great! We ordered the hellboy and the hellified porkpie white and I have to say it was fresh, full of flavor and great value. My only critique would be more hot suppressa on the hellified and take numbers at the door! It's a little unreasonable to ask people to wait 90 mins and not offer to call when table it ready. Either way it was great but probably won't be crossing the river to wait another 90 mins.",4.0
"If there was ever a restaurant that inspires the need for #PiDay (3.14) to be everyday, it is Paulie Gee's. The pizza is a true art, and every bite is important, from the center to the crust crust.  PG is located in pizza heaven, or right near the water on Greenpoint Ave if you want a Google Map friendly address.Read it on my blog: highclasstohighlifes.com…As you'll see below I'm constantly on the proscuitt of happiness but this time we went for a different ham, Canadian bacon, and on the Monte Cristo. You bet it counted towards happiness. This pizza combines maple syrup drizzle and gouda with the ham. Yes, yes and more yes. Paulie asked if we had butter on the crust...sadly, no. SO MUCH REGRET....that I'll be back in no time to try it. You'll notice on the menu that they have a brisket pizza that features Hometown BBQ -- I love this local BK collaboration. You can get sauced the other way too with Greenpoint local brews!Anyway, I have nearly eaten my way through the entire menu (still need to do a bit of adventuring on the vegan side, every time I get close, I just want meat...) and I have been very pleased with every slice thus far. Therefore my advice to you is go with the pizza that's toppings are most appealing...or grab a handful of friends and share, then you can try multiple pizzas!The man, who is not a myth, but definitely a legend is often found inside checking in on tables, ensuring quality control and getting to know the patrons. He loved my last Instagram post that did a little play words...sharing that I was on the prosciutt of happiness with his King Henry Classic. He's always all smiles and usually wearing a great hat, he is Paulie Gee himself. Paulie Gee's - High Class to High Lifes If you really knead to get delivery or pickup, you'll have to look elsewhere for now though. The only way to leave Paulie Gee's with a to-go box is with leftovers. Rumor has it that a slice joint is opening up nearby though! I'm counting down the days, hours and minutes. Want to keep drooling? Read the menu!Pro Tip: Grab dinner at Paulie Gee's then walk straight out on the water in Greenpoint to Transmitter park or the outlook. Maybe even catch a sunset and BYO night cap!",5.0
"My old pal Carlos and I visited Paulie Gee's last night and had a great meal. I'm accustomed to going with the ol' vegan girlfriend and have a tradition where we split two pies from their extensive vegan selection, so we can try two different types of pies. The vegan and non-vegan selections are both extensive; each category has at least a half dozen kinds of pies, including oil bases, white slices, marinara, spinach-based, spicy honey and barbecue sauce foundations. The pies are aesthetically pleasing to every sense, well, every sense except sound. It's usually better when sound isn't a factor. At least when you're talking about food. When you're talking about music, sound is obviously a very important sense to talk about. I may go as far as to say that in a conversation about music, sound is the only sense that matters.I was excited to go with Carlos because I was going to get to eat their meat and actual cheese. The Paulie Gee's brisket is lean and delicious. Their pickled red onions possess a truly memorable tang and are worth spending a couple buck to add on to pretty much any pie. The ricotta dollops on the Ricky Ricotta feel more like bursts of a cream sauce than regular old cheese. Interestingly, the dairy and non-dairy ricotta cheeses are almost indecipherable in quality, which goes to show that Paulie Gee's knows what's up. Carlos and I were pleased to compliment the trad Italian flavors of the Ricky Ricotta with a tangy Barbecue Brisket pie. I'm psyched to go with a fellow omnivore again, because there are tons of other flavor combos I'm eager to try. New Yorkers, such as myself, are notorious for being dicks about the quality of pizza dough. It's the dough that invalidates the Chicago Deep Dish's false aspiration to pizza status. I can't stand Sicilian pizza either, which is a controversial take in Nueva York. Anyhow, no matter how well adorned a Paulie Gee's pie is, its base--the crust--is its most distinct and wonderful element. The crust is thin but springy, and always a little charred. It's pretty much naan bread, which is either a very luck coincidence or a visionary innovation. Naan bread, as you know, is lit, and, as it turns out, it is the perfect surface upon which various pizza ingredients should be placed and/or spread to mingle harmoniously.I've visited Paulie Gee's a number of times, and there's a bit of narrative that forms around my visits. The first time I tried to go, it was around noon, and my gf and I made the unpleasant discovery that Paulie Gee's does not open til 5 PM. The next time, we rolled up in a deep crew of six and had to wait about two to three hours for a table for six. If you find yourself in that position, you'll be okay though because there are plenty of bars around. There's also the water/skyline, mere yards away and a nice record store a block away.The gf and I have gone a few other times and it's always been great--except for the one time that a camera crew was shooting a special on Paulie Gee's vegan options.

"New York probably takes its pizza more seriously than anywhere else in the world.  I'm sure there are 7 or 8 people reading this right now that would be willing to shiv a guy for saying something bad about their favorite slice.  With that in mind, Paulie Gee's is a pizza lover's pizza place.  They make Neapolitan style pizzas with an oven shipped in from Naples and lovingly reassembled by small, Italian elves.  From this oven, comes perfectly leopard-spotted pizzas with just the right amount of bouncy chewy dough.To top the pizza, there's a lovingly curated selection to choose from so don't you dare ask for substitutions.  Lucky for you whether you're a vegan, vegetarian, white/red pie lover, averse to spice, meat lover, or whatever!  There's at least one pie on the menu* that will make you say, ""hmmm..."".  My personal favorites are the Mo' Cheeks ($16, has guanciale and is perfect with the pickled onions) and Ricotta Be Kidding Me ($17, with tons of meat topped with adorable dollops of cottage cheese).  I've only ever had 1 pizza there that wasn't stellar and I won't tell you which one because you'll definitely judge me for choosing it in the first place.The atmosphere at Paulie Gee's is great.  It's quintessential Brooklyn.  Think dark unfinished wood walls with an eclectic collection of tables made from reclaimed wood, music consisting of a mixture of jazz, rock, and anything but top 40s.  What always makes my night is that the ACTUAL Paulie Gee walks around and talks to EVERYONE.  It doesn't matter if Keri Russell** is sitting right next to you, he will still come by and have a 5-20 minute conversation with you and your table.  My only complaint is how popular this place is.  They've stopped making pizzas to go and still, the wait is crazy.  I've never been able to get a table in less than 45 minutes unless it was late at night.  I guess that's not a bad problem to have.  I also kind of wish they would get a full liquor license and take that creative pizza combo creating mind into the cocktail realm.  I mean...Mike's Hot Honey + Whiskey?  Maybe?---------* If you can't find a pizza you like on the printed menu in the restaurant, whip out the smartphone and check out the ""secret"" menu on the website.** This actually happened.",4.0

"Some of the best za in the city, bar none. The lady and I traveled far and wide for it since we'd heard such great things. It was a Friday night so the restaurant was predictably packed. There's not much in the form of a waiting area, which particularly sucked given how freezing the weather was, but we had a feeling the pie would be well worth the wait (plus we also got to watch a tipsy couple aggressively suck face up close and personal which was an unexpected but enjoyable twist).The vibe was cool, featuring low--lighting, a huge and beautiful custom brick oven, and trendy attractive people who's favorite bands you've never heard of.When we finally were seated I was stoked to see the menu offered a huge variety of pies with all sorts of niche toppings AND vegan options(I personally don't give two damns about veganism but they presented them in an unpretentious way so I was cool with it).

"After a 2-hours wait on a weekend for a party of 2, we finally got a table at the renowned pizza shop in Brooklyn. After having one of the best pizzas of all time at Little Isabella located in Baltimore, I was on the mission to find its companion in NYC. Overhyped as we suspected, Paulie Gee had nothing on Little Isabella! Perhaps, it was the quirky blend of sweet and savory flavors, but with that 2-hour wait, we surely did not have a pleasing experience.We ordered two pies: HellBoy and Greenpointer. HellBoy: Fresh Mozzarella, Italian Tomatoes, Berkshire Sopressata Piccante, Parmigiano Reggiano and Mike's HOT HoneyGreenpointer:Fresh Mozzarella, Baby Arugula, Olive Oil, Fresh Lemon Juice and Shaved Parmigiano ReggianoWe didn't really enjoy the sweetness of the honey in the HellBoy or the sourness of the lemon juice in the Greenpointer. Fresh, as we saw them make each pie to order, I definitely thought the doughiness of the pizza wasn't anything spectacular. In terms of service, I think it was pretty solid. Our waiter was patient and helpful. As a surprise, Paulie Gee himself introduced himself to just about every table, making it feel quite personable. In all, I definitely wouldn't return back to this pizzeria, especially with that crazy wait. During that 2-hour wait and 1.5-hour dining time, I can drive down to Baltimore and get some Little Isabella for half the price and no wait!",3.0
"3.5 stars for this pizza joint hidden behind a HUGE wooden door all the way down Franklin streetCrust was good with a nice char on the hellboy but the crust of the greenpoint pizza seemed a bit underdone We were quoted a 1.5 hour wait at 8pm for 3 on a Saturday but we were lucky that people in front of us hadn't returned so we were seated right away! (so don't be discouraged)---hellboy: everything was good about this except that spicy honey! Should of gone with a more classic margherita style pizza instead---greenpoint: fresh arugula, with a bit too much lemon juice, so nothing special NOTE: they don't have pepper flakes, only chili oil",4.0
"If you want great pizza and the right atmosphere look no further than Paulie Gee's. We sat at the bar (luckily) and avoided a two hour wait.  The pizza choices are numerous, with some very creative options. There were three of us and we started with two pies. Would have been content but it was so good we ordered a third.The texture. The crust. The toppings. Hard pressed to mention anything I didn't like. I love pizza and this place is right up there with the best. That includes many pizzerias throughout Italy.Paulie stopped by for a chat and he has a fantastic personality. Great stories and it is obvious that he loves what he does and holds him team to very high standards.He was also kind enough to give me an official Paulie Gee's pin and a limoncello. A very nice touch!Make sure you check out the pizza oven in the back. It's a small,cozy place so don't pass this place up in you are in NY.",5.0
I take my pizza very seriously. The vegan pizza is so good here that if they didn't tell you it was vegan you would have no clue. I had the pie with vegan sausage and shared a few others with friends. It was all out of this world. I can't wait to go back again.,5.0
"There's a LOT of really great pizza in NYC, that's nothing new. But combine amazing pizza with friendly, caring service and a killer ambiance, and Paulie Gee's has a leg up on a lot of the other heavy hitters. The wait can be crazy, but we came in on a Tuesday night and it was half empty. I guess the key is to come when there's post-blizzard sludge everywhere and no one else wants to go out. Paulie Gee was there as I'm told he usually is, weaving around the space with his cup of coffee and stopping at literally every table. For us, he offered to curate our pizza order and who were we to argue? Read on for what Paulie Gee himself recommends:- The Greenpointer: according to Paulie, basically like eating a salad due to the piles of fresh baby arugula on top. - The Mo Cheeks: My personal favorite of the meal. The pickled onions on there are a nice surprise, and give a nice kick to the rest of the ingredients. - The Monte Cristo: OK, so this is probably something I would never think to order myself, but I'm glad it came out for us because it's actually super tasty. It comes with Canadian bacon and a drizzle of maple syrup, which I know sounds weird but trust me (or rather, trust Paulie). - I didn't catch the name of the last pizza, but it was one of the best and after peeking at the menu again I think it might have been the Hellboy. It was piled high with the tastiest Berkshire Sopressata, and it was perfect with the side of Mike's hot honey (which you haven't tried on pizza you must immediately). They asked if we wanted a dessert pizza but at that point we were stuffed to the gills. It was one of the best New York pizza experiences I've had so far, and the service is what really puts them above and beyond. I'm going to run for vice-president of the Paulie Gee fanclub soon!",5.0
"Came here a few days ago with my friend after work. Very dark inside, took some time for my eyeballs to adjust lol. We started off with some beers and then went with the Hellboy which was AMAZING. The hot honey makes a difference! Then we went with a vegan pie since neither one of us was particularly full. We ordered one with spinach, sea salt and garlic on it (sorry don't remember the name!) It was OK, not that memorable. The standout is by far Hellboy, the crust for both pizzas was SUPER THIN, firm and didn't fall apart on me. We both liked it. I took off a star for the spinach pie being nothing special and that it's a bit on the pricey side. Overall, I think I'll be back to try the other pizzas on the menu!",4.0
"Maybe we came on an off night, but we didn't care too much about the pizza and it was definitely not the best we've had. My friend wanted to celebrate her belated birthday at Paulie Gee's and so we did. We ordered 3 pies (Greenpointer, Ricotta Be Kidding Me, and The Hometown Brisket). I think the Hometown Brisket was our favorite only because of the BBQ sauce. Other than that, there wasn't much brisket pieces on the pizza. Ricotta Be Kidding Me was okay. The Greenpointer was all greens so that balanced our meal a little bit. I hear people waiting for hours to get a seat here and right now I'm just wondering where all the hype went? We came when they were opening, so thank goodness we didn't wait on line for this...cause it wouldn't have been worth it. FYI: There's no sign outside that says ""Paulie Gee's"". You just have to look by the address number ""60"" in order to find this place. I actually walked passed it while we were trying to find it. Also, use your flash on your phones to read the menu. I really liked the rustic interior but it was literally pitch black in there.",3.0
"Zagat rated the hellboy as the best pizza in NYC. Wow! Big call Zagat... We had to try! We would say it was delicious... But I would have to say Marta is equal of not just ahead. We got here at 6:40 and had to wait over an hr to sit at the bar. When getting here service was prompt and food was great! We ordered the hellboy and the hellified porkpie white and I have to say it was fresh, full of flavor and great value. My only critique would be more hot suppressa on the hellified and take numbers at the door! It's a little unreasonable to ask people to wait 90 mins and not offer to call when table it ready. Either way it was great but probably won't be crossing the river to wait another 90 mins.",4.0
"If there was ever a restaurant that inspires the need for #PiDay (3.14) to be everyday, it is Paulie Gee's. The pizza is a true art, and every bite is important, from the center to the crust crust.  PG is located in pizza heaven, or right near the water on Greenpoint Ave if you want a Google Map friendly address.Read it on my blog: highclasstohighlifes.com…As you'll see below I'm constantly on the proscuitt of happiness but this time we went for a different ham, Canadian bacon, and on the Monte Cristo. You bet it counted towards happiness. This pizza combines maple syrup drizzle and gouda with the ham. Yes, yes and more yes. Paulie asked if we had butter on the crust...sadly, no. SO MUCH REGRET....that I'll be back in no time to try it. You'll notice on the menu that they have a brisket pizza that features Hometown BBQ -- I love this local BK collaboration. You can get sauced the other way too with Greenpoint local brews!Anyway, I have nearly eaten my way through the entire menu (still need to do a bit of adventuring on the vegan side, every time I get close, I just want meat...) and I have been very pleased with every slice thus far. Therefore my advice to you is go with the pizza that's toppings are most appealing...or grab a handful of friends and share, then you can try multiple pizzas!The man, who is not a myth, but definitely a legend is often found inside checking in on tables, ensuring quality control and getting to know the patrons. He loved my last Instagram post that did a little play words...sharing that I was on the prosciutt of happiness with his King Henry Classic. He's always all smiles and usually wearing a great hat, he is Paulie Gee himself. Paulie Gee's - High Class to High Lifes If you really knead to get delivery or pickup, you'll have to look elsewhere for now though. The only way to leave Paulie Gee's with a to-go box is with leftovers. Rumor has it that a slice joint is opening up nearby though! I'm counting down the days, hours and minutes. Want to keep drooling? Read the menu!Pro Tip: Grab dinner at Paulie Gee's then walk straight out on the water in Greenpoint to Transmitter park or the outlook. Maybe even catch a sunset and BYO night cap!",5.0
"My old pal Carlos and I visited Paulie Gee's last night and had a great meal. I'm accustomed to going with the ol' vegan girlfriend and have a tradition where we split two pies from their extensive vegan selection, so we can try two different types of pies. The vegan and non-vegan selections are both extensive; each category has at least a half dozen kinds of pies, including oil bases, white slices, marinara, spinach-based, spicy honey and barbecue sauce foundations. The pies are aesthetically pleasing to every sense, well, every sense except sound. It's usually better when sound isn't a factor. At least when you're talking about food. When you're talking about music, sound is obviously a very important sense to talk about. I may go as far as to say that in a conversation about music, sound is the only sense that matters.I was excited to go with Carlos because I was going to get to eat their meat and actual cheese. The Paulie Gee's brisket is lean and delicious. Their pickled red onions possess a truly memorable tang and are worth spending a couple buck to add on to pretty much any pie. The ricotta dollops on the Ricky Ricotta feel more like bursts of a cream sauce than regular old cheese. Interestingly, the dairy and non-dairy ricotta cheeses are almost indecipherable in quality, which goes to show that Paulie Gee's knows what's up. Carlos and I were pleased to compliment the trad Italian flavors of the Ricky Ricotta with a tangy Barbecue Brisket pie. I'm psyched to go with a fellow omnivore again, because there are tons of other flavor combos I'm eager to try. New Yorkers, such as myself, are notorious for being dicks about the quality of pizza dough. It's the dough that invalidates the Chicago Deep Dish's false aspiration to pizza status. I can't stand Sicilian pizza either, which is a controversial take in Nueva York. Anyhow, no matter how well adorned a Paulie Gee's pie is, its base--the crust--is its most distinct and wonderful element. The crust is thin but springy, and always a little charred. It's pretty much naan bread, which is either a very luck coincidence or a visionary innovation. Naan bread, as you know, is lit, and, as it turns out, it is the perfect surface upon which various pizza ingredients should be placed and/or spread to mingle harmoniously.I've visited Paulie Gee's a number of times, and there's a bit of narrative that forms around my visits. The first time I tried to go, it was around noon, and my gf and I made the unpleasant discovery that Paulie Gee's does not open til 5 PM. The next time, we rolled up in a deep crew of six and had to wait about two to three hours for a table for six. If you find yourself in that position, you'll be okay though because there are plenty of bars around. There's also the water/skyline, mere yards away and a nice record store a block away.The gf and I have gone a few other times and it's always been great--except for the one time that a camera crew was shooting a special on Paulie Gee's vegan options. My girlfriend and I were in the shot all throughout our meal, and we were fighting (as subtly as possible) for the duration of our meal. I was taken aback and somewhat miffed when the producers of the show asked to do a talking head with us outside. The tension was palpable but they still insisted on interviewing us. I really do believe that you should foot the bill if you're going to interview someone for your television series or web series or gratuitously long Yelp review or whatever. At LEAST commission me to write a song for the soundtrack.In closing, I would like to offer a lil sum sum for the ladies. Are you interested in grandfatherly, charmingly blue collar, short men whose personalities closely resemble those of most Robert De Niro characters--but only in David O. Russel movies? If you do, and might want to be possibly hit on by a man of this caliber, you will love Paulie Gee's. At all times, Paulie Gee's eponymous Pizza Architect and Entrepreneur, Paulie Gee, stalks the narrow spaces between tables, checking in with customers--particularly of the reasonably attractive female demographic--and asks them how their food is, making small talk and thanking them for their patronage. I think this is cool. I would do the same if I were in his position, so don't take this the wrong way. Central to Paulie Gee's game is his ability to recommend a pizza place in seemingly every zip code on the planet and his inclination to tell you (the lady in question) the name of the dude who works there/owns the place, and to tell you (still the lady in question) to tell the dude (who owns the pizza place) to say that he (Paulie Gee) says hi. The Brotherhood of Pizza Mans is truly alive and well.",5.0

"I almost feel like it's blasphemy for not giving 5 stars. Finally made my way over here at Paulie Gees after way too long. Clearly this place is GPs staple so was excited to drop by on Wednesday night.There was no wait- very good. I had been worried about this so called 3x around 6:45pm to see how long it was before heading over. No one picked up and their answering service basically hangs up on you. I ordered the Daniela and he ordered the brisket pizza. Mine came out a good 7 minutes before his. I noticed immediately that about 40% of the crust was charred to the point of being inedible. To top that off, the spinach topping my pizza was the same. It was literally a black piece of ash and when I picked a leaf up or crumbled in my hands. The cheese blend was very good (mozzarella and Parmesan) but the pizza was just not good. To top it off, parts of the center were soggy and didn't hold the toppings when I grabbed a slice. When the brisket pizza came out a few minutes later I noticed immediately that it was cooked perfectly. The crust was edible and delicious. I was bummed that mine didn't come out this way especially since it seemed like a classic. All I can say is they probably put our orders in together and maybe his needed a little longer in the oven. Mine was most likely getting over cooked while his needed a few more minutes. Hence the gap in time between both of our orders coming out and the reason why mine was half done by the time his came out.I was really disappointed but the good thing to know is at least the brisket pizza was cooked well. I know there is a good meal at Paulie Gees but I feel like we were jipped.Also, great touch that Paulie himself came in to greet all the diners. He was super friendly and it brings a family quality to the place. This is maybe one of the main reasons I'd come back.",3.0
"Delicious!! Definitely made my top 3 favorite pizza  places (the others being robertas and best pizza). We've been meaning to come forever but the line is always so long. We were finally seated right away on a Friday night because we ran over as soon as they opened at 6pm. I would highly recommend this tactic to those of you who have been meaning to come and haven't been able to due to the wait -- the food will be worth it. We ordered the hellboy, ricotta be kidding me and the hot honey ice cream Sunday for dessert. The hellboy was our fave. It was basically a pepperoni pizza with hot honey lined under the cheese. I liked it more than the bees sting from Robertas but both are very good. All in all would highly recommend. As an extra plus Paulie Gee was hanging around today,though it seems like he does this quite often, going from table to table talking to the customers.",5.0
"My husband and I visited Paulie Gee's about two years ago and he still dreams of the Hellboy. This time we ordered the Hellboy and Cherry Jones.  The Hellboy was great but just a touch too sweet for me.  The hot honey adds a little kick but is definitely not too hot.  My husband will tell you it is the best pizza he has ever had (saying a lot since he was raised in the Bronx).  The Cherry Jones on the other hand was way too sweet for both of us.  I couldn't taste anything other then honey.  My husband embarrassed me by telling the waitress we didn't like it.  She offered us a replacement.  We ordered the Ricky Ricotta.  It was alright.  I was shocked because the ricotta was not warm.  The crust at Paulie Gee's is the perfect texture.  However, two of our three pizzas were too charred for my taste.  I must mention Paulie walks around all the tables to make sure everyone is enjoying.  Love it!  The restaurant is too dark and loud for my taste.",3.0
"Interesting decor, super dark inside and it was hard to read the menu. We were seated under one of the speakers, so I felt like an old person complaining about how loud the music was, but really, we came for the food. Split a salad and a Greenpointer pie, and neither disappointed. Both were served quickly, and the pie just exploded with flavor. The lemon kick was strong but not overwhelming, and the crust was perfection. Service was attentive, friendly, and efficient. Lots of menu choices for anything your palate is craving. Overall, a very good experience, and one I would look forward to enjoying again.",4.0

I take my pizza very seriously. The vegan pizza is so good here that if they didn't tell you it was vegan you would have no clue. I had the pie with vegan sausage and shared a few others with friends. It was all out of this world. I can't wait to go back again.,5.0
"There's a LOT of really great pizza in NYC, that's nothing new. But combine amazing pizza with friendly, caring service and a killer ambiance, and Paulie Gee's has a leg up on a lot of the other heavy hitters. The wait can be crazy, but we came in on a Tuesday night and it was half empty. I guess the key is to come when there's post-blizzard sludge everywhere and no one else wants to go out. Paulie Gee was there as I'm told he usually is, weaving around the space with his cup of coffee and stopping at literally every table. For us, he offered to curate our pizza order and who were we to argue? Read on for what Paulie Gee himself recommends:- The Greenpointer: according to Paulie, basically like eating a salad due to the piles of fresh baby arugula on top. - The Mo Cheeks: My personal favorite of the meal. The pickled onions on there are a nice surprise, and give a nice kick to the rest of the ingredients. - The Monte Cristo: OK, so this is probably something I would never think to order myself, but I'm glad it came out for us because it's actually super tasty. It comes with Canadian bacon and a drizzle of maple syrup, which I know sounds weird but trust me (or rather, trust Paulie). - I didn't catch the name of the last pizza, but it was one of the best and after peeking at the menu again I think it might have been the Hellboy. It was piled high with the tastiest Berkshire Sopressata, and it was perfect with the side of Mike's hot honey (which you haven't tried on pizza you must immediately). They asked if we wanted a dessert pizza but at that point we were stuffed to the gills. It was one of the best New York pizza experiences I've had so far, and the service is what really puts them above and beyond. I'm going to run for vice-president of the Paulie Gee fanclub soon!",5.0

It was OK, not that memorable. The standout is by far Hellboy, the crust for both pizzas was SUPER THIN, firm and didn't fall apart on me. We both liked it.

My friend wanted to celebrate her belated birthday at Paulie Gee's and so we did. We ordered 3 pies (Greenpointer, Ricotta Be Kidding Me, and The Hometown Brisket). I think the Hometown Brisket was our favorite only because of the BBQ sauce. Other than that, there wasn't much brisket pieces on the pizza. Ricotta Be Kidding Me was okay. The Greenpointer was all greens so that balanced our meal a little bit. I hear people waiting for hours to get a seat here and right now I'm just wondering where all the hype went? We came when they were opening, so thank goodness we didn't wait on line for this...cause it wouldn't have been worth it. FYI: There's no sign outside that says ""Paulie Gee's"".

"My old pal Carlos and I visited Paulie Gee's last night and had a great meal. I'm accustomed to going with the ol' vegan girlfriend and have a tradition where we split two pies from their extensive vegan selection, so we can try two different types of pies. The vegan and non-vegan selections are both extensive; each category has at least a half dozen kinds of pies, including oil bases, white slices, marinara, spinach-based, spicy honey and barbecue sauce foundations. The pies are aesthetically pleasing to every sense, well, every sense except sound. It's usually better when sound isn't a factor. At least when you're talking about food. When you're talking about music, sound is obviously a very important sense to talk about. I may go as far as to say that in a conversation about music, sound is the only sense that matters.I was excited to go with Carlos because I was going to get to eat their meat and actual cheese. The Paulie Gee's brisket is lean and delicious. Their pickled red onions possess a truly memorable tang and are worth spending a couple buck to add on to pretty much any pie. The ricotta dollops on the Ricky Ricotta feel more like bursts of a cream sauce than regular old cheese. Interestingly, the dairy and non-dairy ricotta cheeses are almost indecipherable in quality, which goes to show that Paulie Gee's knows what's up. Carlos and I were pleased to compliment the trad Italian flavors of the Ricky Ricotta with a tangy Barbecue Brisket pie. I'm psyched to go with a fellow omnivore again, because there are tons of other flavor combos I'm eager to try. New Yorkers, such as myself, are notorious for being dicks about the quality of pizza dough. It's the dough that invalidates the Chicago Deep Dish's false aspiration to pizza status. I can't stand Sicilian pizza either, which is a controversial take in Nueva York. Anyhow, no matter how well adorned a Paulie Gee's pie is, its base--the crust--is its most distinct and wonderful element. The crust is thin but springy, and always a little charred. It's pretty much naan bread, which is either a very luck coincidence or a visionary innovation. Naan bread, as you know, is lit, and, as it turns out, it is the perfect surface upon which various pizza ingredients should be placed and/or spread to mingle harmoniously.I've visited Paulie Gee's a number of times, and there's a bit of narrative that forms around my visits. The first time I tried to go, it was around noon, and my gf and I made the unpleasant discovery that Paulie Gee's does not open til 5 PM. The next time, we rolled up in a deep crew of six and had to wait about two to three hours for a table for six. If you find yourself in that position, you'll be okay though because there are plenty of bars around. There's also the water/skyline, mere yards away and a nice record store a block away.The gf and I have gone a few other times and it's always been great--except for the one time that a camera crew was shooting a special on Paulie Gee's vegan options. My girlfriend and I were in the shot all throughout our meal, and we were fighting (as subtly as possible) for the duration of our meal. I was taken aback and somewhat miffed when the producers of the show asked to do a talking head with us outside. The tension was palpable but they still insisted on interviewing us. I really do believe that you should foot the bill if you're going to interview someone for your television series or web series or gratuitously long Yelp review or whatever. At LEAST commission me to write a song for the soundtrack.In closing, I would like to offer a lil sum sum for the ladies. Are you interested in grandfatherly, charmingly blue collar, short men whose personalities closely resemble those of most Robert De Niro characters--but only in David O. Russel movies? If you do, and might want to be possibly hit on by a man of this caliber, you will love Paulie Gee's. At all times, Paulie Gee's eponymous Pizza Architect and Entrepreneur, Paulie Gee, stalks the narrow spaces between tables, checking in with customers--particularly of the reasonably attractive female demographic--and asks them how their food is, making small talk and thanking them for their patronage. I think this is cool. I would do the same if I were in his position, so don't take this the wrong way. Central to Paulie Gee's game is his ability to recommend a pizza place in seemingly every zip code on the planet and his inclination to tell you (the lady in question) the name of the dude who works there/owns the place, and to tell you (still the lady in question) to tell the dude (who owns the pizza place) to say that he (Paulie Gee) says hi. The Brotherhood of Pizza Mans is truly alive and well.",5.0

"I almost feel like it's blasphemy for not giving 5 stars. Finally made my way over here at Paulie Gees after way too long. Clearly this place is GPs staple so was excited to drop by on Wednesday night.There was no wait- very good. I had been worried about this so called 3x around 6:45pm to see how long it was before heading over. No one picked up and their answering service basically hangs up on you. I ordered the Daniela and he ordered the brisket pizza. Mine came out a good 7 minutes before his. I noticed immediately that about 40% of the crust was charred to the point of being inedible. To top that off, the spinach topping my pizza was the same. It was literally a black piece of ash and when I picked a leaf up or crumbled in my hands. The cheese blend was very good (mozzarella and Parmesan) but the pizza was just not good. To top it off, parts of the center were soggy and didn't hold the toppings when I grabbed a slice. When the brisket pizza came out a few minutes later I noticed immediately that it was cooked perfectly. The crust was edible and delicious. I was bummed that mine didn't come out this way especially since it seemed like a classic. All I can say is they probably put our orders in together and maybe his needed a little longer in the oven. Mine was most likely getting over cooked while his needed a few more minutes. Hence the gap in time between both of our orders coming out and the reason why mine was half done by the time his came out.I was really disappointed but the good thing to know is at least the brisket pizza was cooked well. I know there is a good meal at Paulie Gees but I feel like we were jipped.Also, great touch that Paulie himself came in to greet all the diners. He was super friendly and it brings a family quality to the place. This is maybe one of the main reasons I'd come back.",3.0
"Delicious!! Definitely made my top 3 favorite pizza  places (the others being robertas and best pizza). We've been meaning to come forever but the line is always so long. We were finally seated right away on a Friday night because we ran over as soon as they opened at 6pm. I would highly recommend this tactic to those of you who have been meaning to come and haven't been able to due to the wait -- the food will be worth it. We ordered the hellboy, ricotta be kidding me and the hot honey ice cream Sunday for dessert. The hellboy was our fave. It was basically a pepperoni pizza with hot honey lined under the cheese. I liked it more than the bees sting from Robertas but both are very good. All in all would highly recommend. As an extra plus Paulie Gee was hanging around today,though it seems like he does this quite often, going from table to table talking to the customers.",5.0
"My husband and I visited Paulie Gee's about two years ago and he still dreams of the Hellboy. This time we ordered the Hellboy and Cherry Jones.  The Hellboy was great but just a touch too sweet for me.  The hot honey adds a little kick but is definitely not too hot.  My husband will tell you it is the best pizza he has ever had (saying a lot since he was raised in the Bronx).  The Cherry Jones on the other hand was way too sweet for both of us.  I couldn't taste anything other then honey.  My husband embarrassed me by telling the waitress we didn't like it.  She offered us a replacement.  We ordered the Ricky Ricotta.  It was alright.  I was shocked because the ricotta was not warm.  The crust at Paulie Gee's is the perfect texture.  However, two of our three pizzas were too charred for my taste.  I must mention Paulie walks around all the tables to make sure everyone is enjoying.  Love it!  The restaurant is too dark and loud for my taste.",3.0
"Interesting decor, super dark inside and it was hard to read the menu. We were seated under one of the speakers, so I felt like an old person complaining about how loud the music was, but really, we came for the food. Split a salad and a Greenpointer pie, and neither disappointed. Both were served quickly, and the pie just exploded with flavor. The lemon kick was strong but not overwhelming, and the crust was perfection. Service was attentive, friendly, and efficient. Lots of menu choices for anything your palate is craving. Overall, a very good experience, and one I would look forward to enjoying again.",4.0
"New York probably takes its pizza more seriously than anywhere else in the world.  I'm sure there are 7 or 8 people reading this right now that would be willing to shiv a guy for saying something bad about their favorite slice.  With that in mind, Paulie Gee's is a pizza lover's pizza place.  They make Neapolitan style pizzas with an oven shipped in from Naples and lovingly reassembled by small, Italian elves.  From this oven, comes perfectly leopard-spotted pizzas with just the right amount of bouncy chewy dough.To top the pizza, there's a lovingly curated selection to choose from so don't you dare ask for substitutions.  Lucky for you whether you're a vegan, vegetarian, white/red pie lover, averse to spice, meat lover, or whatever!  There's at least one pie on the menu* that will make you say, ""hmmm..."".  My personal favorites are the Mo' Cheeks ($16, has guanciale and is perfect with the pickled onions) and Ricotta Be Kidding Me ($17, with tons of meat topped with adorable dollops of cottage cheese).  I've only ever had 1 pizza there that wasn't stellar and I won't tell you which one because you'll definitely judge me for choosing it in the first place.The atmosphere at Paulie Gee's is great.  It's quintessential Brooklyn.  Think dark unfinished wood walls with an eclectic collection of tables made from reclaimed wood, music consisting of a mixture of jazz, rock, and anything but top 40s.  What always makes my night is that the ACTUAL Paulie Gee walks around and talks to EVERYONE.  It doesn't matter if Keri Russell** is sitting right next to you, he will still come by and have a 5-20 minute conversation with you and your table.  My only complaint is how popular this place is.  They've stopped making pizzas to go and still, the wait is crazy.  I've never been able to get a table in less than 45 minutes unless it was late at night.  I guess that's not a bad problem to have.  I also kind of wish they would get a full liquor license and take that creative pizza combo creating mind into the cocktail realm.  I mean...Mike's Hot Honey + Whiskey?  Maybe?---------* If you can't find a pizza you like on the printed menu in the restaurant, whip out the smartphone and check out the ""secret"" menu on the website.** This actually happened.",4.0
"We've literally flown across the country to enjoy his pizza. It's that good! Walking in, the aroma of pizza cooking in a brick oven hits your nose.This is about time my stomach starts to growl. The vibe is flowing with positive energy, and the low lighting is flattering & sexy. The bar to the left is where you can order a beverage while you wait.  They have a decent beer selection. Wait times vary, but it's usually not as long as anticipated, and well worth the effort.Everyone, including the servers, seem happy to be there.Paulie Gee is the utmost host. He's always found time to come to our table with suggestions, stories, and the occasional limoncello, (his recipe of the celebratory cocktail).Talking with him, I've gathered that he makes the vegan pizza for the people, or demand for it, but he didn't seem interested in the cause.

"Absolutely delicious. Huge selection of pies - good for meatatarians, vegetarians, and even vegans. Wood fire oven delivers the signature light smoke and char. Dough is absolutely tender and springy. They even let the pizza rest afterwards so the cheese sets and you don't burn the crap out of your mouth.Hellboy- spicy pepperoni with hot honey. Absolute classic pizza. Hot honey perfectly blankets the spicy meat. Super simple, absolutely delicious. Get two, trust meRicotta/sausage pie - similar to one above, hot honey included.

"One of the challenges of  being vegan is getting your friends/family to be open to the idea of trying vegan food.I have never had Vegan Pizza before and I usually try to try a restaurant first before recommending to anyone especially a non vegan but I took a chance.When we first arrived we were having trouble picking something since everything was foreign to us. Someone sitting next to us saw our struggle and took us to try the  IN Ricotta Da Vegan so we did. AMAZING!! My non vegan date was impressed and I was so happy.Thanks Paulie Gee for making me looking good Whew! One pie (6 small slices) goes for 16 bucks .

"Some of the best za in the city, bar none. The lady and I traveled far and wide for it since we'd heard such great things. It was a Friday night so the restaurant was predictably packed. There's not much in the form of a waiting area, which particularly sucked given how freezing the weather was, but we had a feeling the pie would be well worth the wait (plus we also got to watch a tipsy couple aggressively suck face up close and personal which was an unexpected but enjoyable twist).The vibe was cool, featuring low--lighting, a huge and beautiful custom brick oven, and trendy attractive people who's favorite bands you've never heard of.When we finally were seated I was stoked to see the menu offered a huge variety of pies with all sorts of niche toppings AND vegan options(I personally don't give two damns about veganism but they presented them in an unpretentious way so I was cool with it). We eventually decided to go with the Hell Boy and the Prokypineapple, both of which were amazing, and I'm looking forward to going back and further chowing my way down the menu.Go here.",5.0
"After a 2-hours wait on a weekend for a party of 2, we finally got a table at the renowned pizza shop in Brooklyn. After having one of the best pizzas of all time at Little Isabella located in Baltimore, I was on the mission to find its companion in NYC. Overhyped as we suspected, Paulie Gee had nothing on Little Isabella! Perhaps, it was the quirky blend of sweet and savory flavors, but with that 2-hour wait, we surely did not have a pleasing experience.We ordered two pies: HellBoy and Greenpointer. HellBoy: Fresh Mozzarella, Italian Tomatoes, Berkshire Sopressata Piccante, Parmigiano Reggiano and Mike's HOT HoneyGreenpointer:Fresh Mozzarella, Baby Arugula, Olive Oil, Fresh Lemon Juice and Shaved Parmigiano ReggianoWe didn't really enjoy the sweetness of the honey in the HellBoy or the sourness of the lemon juice in the Greenpointer. Fresh, as we saw them make each pie to order, I definitely thought the doughiness of the pizza wasn't anything spectacular. In terms of service, I think it was pretty solid. Our waiter was patient and helpful. As a surprise, Paulie Gee himself introduced himself to just about every table, making it feel quite personable. In all, I definitely wouldn't return back to this pizzeria, especially with that crazy wait.

"My old pal Carlos and I visited Paulie Gee's last night and had a great meal. I'm accustomed to going with the ol' vegan girlfriend and have a tradition where we split two pies from their extensive vegan selection, so we can try two different types of pies. The vegan and non-vegan selections are both extensive; each category has at least a half dozen kinds of pies, including oil bases, white slices, marinara, spinach-based, spicy honey and barbecue sauce foundations. The pies are aesthetically pleasing to every sense, well, every sense except sound. It's usually better when sound isn't a factor. At least when you're talking about food. When you're talking about music, sound is obviously a very important sense to talk about. I may go as far as to say that in a conversation about music, sound is the only sense that matters.I was excited to go with Carlos because I was going to get to eat their meat and actual cheese. The Paulie Gee's brisket is lean and delicious. Their pickled red onions possess a truly memorable tang and are worth spending a couple buck to add on to pretty much any pie. The ricotta dollops on the Ricky Ricotta feel more like bursts of a cream sauce than regular old cheese. Interestingly, the dairy and non-dairy ricotta cheeses are almost indecipherable in quality, which goes to show that Paulie Gee's knows what's up. Carlos and I were pleased to compliment the trad Italian flavors of the Ricky Ricotta with a tangy Barbecue Brisket pie. I'm psyched to go with a fellow omnivore again, because there are tons of other flavor combos I'm eager to try. New Yorkers, such as myself, are notorious for being dicks about the quality of pizza dough. It's the dough that invalidates the Chicago Deep Dish's false aspiration to pizza status. I can't stand Sicilian pizza either, which is a controversial take in Nueva York. Anyhow, no matter how well adorned a Paulie Gee's pie is, its base--the crust--is its most distinct and wonderful element. The crust is thin but springy, and always a little charred. It's pretty much naan bread, which is either a very luck coincidence or a visionary innovation. Naan bread, as you know, is lit, and, as it turns out, it is the perfect surface upon which various pizza ingredients should be placed and/or spread to mingle harmoniously.I've visited Paulie Gee's a number of times, and there's a bit of narrative that forms around my visits. The first time I tried to go, it was around noon, and my gf and I made the unpleasant discovery that Paulie Gee's does not open til 5 PM. The next time, we rolled up in a deep crew of six and had to wait about two to three hours for a table for six. If you find yourself in that position, you'll be okay though because there are plenty of bars around. There's also the water/skyline, mere yards away and a nice record store a block away.The gf and I have gone a few other times and it's always been great--except for the one time that a camera crew was shooting a special on Paulie Gee's vegan options. My girlfriend and I were in the shot all throughout our meal, and we were fighting (as subtly as possible) for the duration of our meal. I was taken aback and somewhat miffed when the producers of the show asked to do a talking head with us outside. The tension was palpable but they still insisted on interviewing us. I really do believe that you should foot the bill if you're going to interview someone for your television series or web series or gratuitously long Yelp review or whatever.

"I almost feel like it's blasphemy for not giving 5 stars. Finally made my way over here at Paulie Gees after way too long. Clearly this place is GPs staple so was excited to drop by on Wednesday night.There was no wait- very good. I had been worried about this so called 3x around 6:45pm to see how long it was before heading over. No one picked up and their answering service basically hangs up on you. I ordered the Daniela and he ordered the brisket pizza. Mine came out a good 7 minutes before his. I noticed immediately that about 40% of the crust was charred to the point of being inedible. To top that off, the spinach topping my pizza was the same. It was literally a black piece of ash and when I picked a leaf up or crumbled in my hands. The cheese blend was very good (mozzarella and Parmesan) but the pizza was just not good. To top it off, parts of the center were soggy and didn't hold the toppings when I grabbed a slice. When the brisket pizza came out a few minutes later I noticed immediately that it was cooked perfectly. The crust was edible and delicious. I was bummed that mine didn't come out this way especially since it seemed like a classic. All I can say is they probably put our orders in together and maybe his needed a little longer in the oven. Mine was most likely getting over cooked while his needed a few more minutes. Hence the gap in time between both of our orders coming out and the reason why mine was half done by the time his came out.I was really disappointed but the good thing to know is at least the brisket pizza was cooked well. I know there is a good meal at Paulie Gees but I feel like we were jipped.Also, great touch that Paulie himself came in to greet all the diners. He was super friendly and it brings a family quality to the place. This is maybe one of the main reasons I'd come back.",3.0
"Delicious!! Definitely made my top 3 favorite pizza  places (the others being robertas and best pizza). We've been meaning to come forever but the line is always so long. We were finally seated right away on a Friday night because we ran over as soon as they opened at 6pm. I would highly recommend this tactic to those of you who have been meaning to come and haven't been able to due to the wait -- the food will be worth it. We ordered the hellboy, ricotta be kidding me and the hot honey ice cream Sunday for dessert. The hellboy was our fave. It was basically a pepperoni pizza with hot honey lined under the cheese. I liked it more than the bees sting from Robertas but both are very good. All in all would highly recommend. As an extra plus Paulie Gee was hanging around today,though it seems like he does this quite often, going from table to table talking to the customers.",5.0
"My husband and I visited Paulie Gee's about two years ago and he still dreams of the Hellboy. This time we ordered the Hellboy and Cherry Jones.  The Hellboy was great but just a touch too sweet for me.  The hot honey adds a little kick but is definitely not too hot.  My husband will tell you it is the best pizza he has ever had (saying a lot since he was raised in the Bronx).  The Cherry Jones on the other hand was way too sweet for both of us.  I couldn't taste anything other then honey.  My husband embarrassed me by telling the waitress we didn't like it.  She offered us a replacement.  We ordered the Ricky Ricotta.  It was alright.  I was shocked because the ricotta was not warm.  The crust at Paulie Gee's is the perfect texture.  However, two of our three pizzas were too charred for my taste.  I must mention Paulie walks around all the tables to make sure everyone is enjoying.  Love it!  The restaurant is too dark and loud for my taste.",3.0
"Interesting decor, super dark inside and it was hard to read the menu. We were seated under one of the speakers, so I felt like an old person complaining about how loud the music was, but really, we came for the food. Split a salad and a Greenpointer pie, and neither disappointed. Both were served quickly, and the pie just exploded with flavor. The lemon kick was strong but not overwhelming, and the crust was perfection. Service was attentive, friendly, and efficient. Lots of menu choices for anything your palate is craving. Overall, a very good experience, and one I would look forward to enjoying again.",4.0
"New York probably takes its pizza more seriously than anywhere else in the world.  I'm sure there are 7 or 8 people reading this right now that would be willing to shiv a guy for saying something bad about their favorite slice.  With that in mind, Paulie Gee's is a pizza lover's pizza place.  They make Neapolitan style pizzas with an oven shipped in from Naples and lovingly reassembled by small, Italian elves.  From this oven, comes perfectly leopard-spotted pizzas with just the right amount of bouncy chewy dough.To top the pizza, there's a lovingly curated selection to choose from so don't you dare ask for substitutions.  Lucky for you whether you're a vegan, vegetarian, white/red pie lover, averse to spice, meat lover, or whatever!  There's at least one pie on the menu* that will make you say, ""hmmm..."".  My personal favorites are the Mo' Cheeks ($16, has guanciale and is perfect with the pickled onions) and Ricotta Be Kidding Me ($17, with tons of meat topped with adorable dollops of cottage cheese).  I've only ever had 1 pizza there that wasn't stellar and I won't tell you which one because you'll definitely judge me for choosing it in the first place.The atmosphere at Paulie Gee's is great.  It's quintessential Brooklyn.  Think dark unfinished wood walls with an eclectic collection of tables made from reclaimed wood, music consisting of a mixture of jazz, rock, and anything but top 40s.  What always makes my night is that the ACTUAL Paulie Gee walks around and talks to EVERYONE.  It doesn't matter if Keri Russell** is sitting right next to you, he will still come by and have a 5-20 minute conversation with you and your table.  My only complaint is how popular this place is.  They've stopped making pizzas to go and still, the wait is crazy.  I've never been able to get a table in less than 45 minutes unless it was late at night.  I guess that's not a bad problem to have.  I also kind of wish they would get a full liquor license and take that creative pizza combo creating mind into the cocktail realm.  I mean...Mike's Hot Honey + Whiskey?  Maybe?---------* If you can't find a pizza you like on the printed menu in the restaurant, whip out the smartphone and check out the ""secret"" menu on the website.** This actually happened.",4.0
"We've literally flown across the country to enjoy his pizza. It's that good! Walking in, the aroma of pizza cooking in a brick oven hits your nose.This is about time my stomach starts to growl. The vibe is flowing with positive energy, and the low lighting is flattering & sexy. The bar to the left is where you can order a beverage while you wait.  They have a decent beer selection. Wait times vary, but it's usually not as long as anticipated, and well worth the effort.Everyone, including the servers, seem happy to be there.Paulie Gee is the utmost host. He's always found time to come to our table with suggestions, stories, and the occasional limoncello, (his recipe of the celebratory cocktail).Talking with him, I've gathered that he makes the vegan pizza for the people, or demand for it, but he didn't seem interested in the cause. The funky bathrooms can be a challenge to use when you've had one too many! VEGAN Pies we LOVE Simply RedVegan Tomato Sauce with Tomatoes, Olive Oil. Vidalia Onions, Garlic, Basil, Salt and PepperVegan Daniela SpinaciBaby Spinach, Olive Oil, Fresh Sliced Garlic, Mild Aleppo Chili Oil and Sea SaltIn Ricotta Da VeganVegan Tomato Sauce, House Made Vegan Sausage, Post-oven House Made Cashew Ricotta Dollops, Baby Arugula and Extra Virgin Olive OilWith many return visits, we've yet to have a negative experience.There has been noise over the years of Paulie Giannone opening a Portland outpost, but it has yet to materialize. Meanwhile, I'll dream of his pizza.",5.0
"Absolutely delicious. Huge selection of pies - good for meatatarians, vegetarians, and even vegans. Wood fire oven delivers the signature light smoke and char. Dough is absolutely tender and springy. They even let the pizza rest afterwards so the cheese sets and you don't burn the crap out of your mouth.Hellboy- spicy pepperoni with hot honey. Absolute classic pizza. Hot honey perfectly blankets the spicy meat. Super simple, absolutely delicious. Get two, trust meRicotta/sausage pie - similar to one above, hot honey included. However ricotta and sausage are a welcome addition. While chunks of roasted garlic are an excellent accentSo many other pies, go try them for yourself.Big lines, put your name down and go drink at browerij lane.

"One of the challenges of  being vegan is getting your friends/family to be open to the idea of trying vegan food.I have never had Vegan Pizza before and I usually try to try a restaurant first before recommending to anyone especially a non vegan but I took a chance.When we first arrived we were having trouble picking something since everything was foreign to us. Someone sitting next to us saw our struggle and took us to try the  IN Ricotta Da Vegan so we did. AMAZING!! My non vegan date was impressed and I was so happy.Thanks Paulie Gee for making me looking good Whew! One pie (6 small slices) goes for 16 bucks . Its small, nice ambiance I would say its a little darkI would go again!Menu like here ------ pauliegee.com/greenpoint… xoxoC.",4.0
"Some of the best za in the city, bar none. The lady and I traveled far and wide for it since we'd heard such great things. It was a Friday night so the restaurant was predictably packed. There's not much in the form of a waiting area, which particularly sucked given how freezing the weather was, but we had a feeling the pie would be well worth the wait (plus we also got to watch a tipsy couple aggressively suck face up close and personal which was an unexpected but enjoyable twist).The vibe was cool, featuring low--lighting, a huge and beautiful custom brick oven, and trendy attractive people who's favorite bands you've never heard of.When we finally were seated I was stoked to see the menu offered a huge variety of pies with all sorts of niche toppings AND vegan options(I personally don't give two damns about veganism but they presented them in an unpretentious way so I was cool with it). We eventually decided to go with the Hell Boy and the Prokypineapple, both of which were amazing, and I'm looking forward to going back and further chowing my way down the menu.Go here.",5.0
"After a 2-hours wait on a weekend for a party of 2, we finally got a table at the renowned pizza shop in Brooklyn. After having one of the best pizzas of all time at Little Isabella located in Baltimore, I was on the mission to find its companion in NYC. Overhyped as we suspected, Paulie Gee had nothing on Little Isabella! Perhaps, it was the quirky blend of sweet and savory flavors, but with that 2-hour wait, we surely did not have a pleasing experience.We ordered two pies: HellBoy and Greenpointer. HellBoy: Fresh Mozzarella, Italian Tomatoes, Berkshire Sopressata Piccante, Parmigiano Reggiano and Mike's HOT HoneyGreenpointer:Fresh Mozzarella, Baby Arugula, Olive Oil, Fresh Lemon Juice and Shaved Parmigiano ReggianoWe didn't really enjoy the sweetness of the honey in the HellBoy or the sourness of the lemon juice in the Greenpointer. Fresh, as we saw them make each pie to order, I definitely thought the doughiness of the pizza wasn't anything spectacular. In terms of service, I think it was pretty solid. Our waiter was patient and helpful. As a surprise, Paulie Gee himself introduced himself to just about every table, making it feel quite personable. In all, I definitely wouldn't return back to this pizzeria, especially with that crazy wait. During that 2-hour wait and 1.5-hour dining time, I can drive down to Baltimore and get some Little Isabella for half the price and no wait!",3.0
"3.5 stars for this pizza joint hidden behind a HUGE wooden door all the way down Franklin streetCrust was good with a nice char on the hellboy but the crust of the greenpoint pizza seemed a bit underdone We were quoted a 1.5 hour wait at 8pm for 3 on a Saturday but we were lucky that people in front of us hadn't returned so we were seated right away! (so don't be discouraged)---hellboy: everything was good about this except that spicy honey! Should of gone with a more classic margherita style pizza instead---greenpoint: fresh arugula, with a bit too much lemon juice, so nothing special NOTE: they don't have pepper flakes, only chili oil",4.0
"If you want great pizza and the right atmosphere look no further than Paulie Gee's. We sat at the bar (luckily) and avoided a two hour wait.  The pizza choices are numerous, with some very creative options. There were three of us and we started with two pies. Would have been content but it was so good we ordered a third.The texture. The crust. The toppings. Hard pressed to mention anything I didn't like. I love pizza and this place is right up there with the best. That includes many pizzerias throughout Italy.Paulie stopped by for a chat and he has a fantastic personality. Great stories and it is obvious that he loves what he does and holds him team to very high standards.He was also kind enough to give me an official Paulie Gee's pin and a limoncello. A very nice touch!Make sure you check out the pizza oven in the back. It's a small,cozy place so don't pass this place up in you are in NY.",5.0
I take my pizza very seriously. The vegan pizza is so good here that if they didn't tell you it was vegan you would have no clue. I had the pie with vegan sausage and shared a few others with friends. It was all out of this world. I can't wait to go back again.,5.0
"There's a LOT of really great pizza in NYC, that's nothing new. But combine amazing pizza with friendly, caring service and a killer ambiance, and Paulie Gee's has a leg up on a lot of the other heavy hitters. The wait can be crazy, but we came in on a Tuesday night and it was half empty. I guess the key is to come when there's post-blizzard sludge everywhere and no one else wants to go out. Paulie Gee was there as I'm told he usually is, weaving around the space with his cup of coffee and stopping at literally every table. For us, he offered to curate our pizza order and who were we to argue? Read on for what Paulie Gee himself recommends:- The Greenpointer: according to Paulie, basically like eating a salad due to the piles of fresh baby arugula on top. - The Mo Cheeks: My personal favorite of the meal. The pickled onions on there are a nice surprise, and give a nice kick to the rest of the ingredients. - The Monte Cristo: OK, so this is probably something I would never think to order myself, but I'm glad it came out for us because it's actually super tasty. It comes with Canadian bacon and a drizzle of maple syrup, which I know sounds weird but trust me (or rather, trust Paulie). - I didn't catch the name of the last pizza, but it was one of the best and after peeking at the menu again I think it might have been the Hellboy. It was piled high with the tastiest Berkshire Sopressata, and it was perfect with the side of Mike's hot honey (which you haven't tried on pizza you must immediately). They asked if we wanted a dessert pizza but at that point we were stuffed to the gills. It was one of the best New York pizza experiences I've had so far, and the service is what really puts them above and beyond. I'm going to run for vice-president of the Paulie Gee fanclub soon!",5.0
"Came here a few days ago with my friend after work. Very dark inside, took some time for my eyeballs to adjust lol. We started off with some beers and then went with the Hellboy which was AMAZING. The hot honey makes a difference! Then we went with a vegan pie since neither one of us was particularly full. We ordered one with spinach, sea salt and garlic on it (sorry don't remember the name!) It was OK, not that memorable. The standout is by far Hellboy, the crust for both pizzas was SUPER THIN, firm and didn't fall apart on me. We both liked it. I took off a star for the spinach pie being nothing special and that it's a bit on the pricey side. Overall, I think I'll be back to try the other pizzas on the menu!",4.0
"Maybe we came on an off night, but we didn't care too much about the pizza and it was definitely not the best we've had. My friend wanted to celebrate her belated birthday at Paulie Gee's and so we did. We ordered 3 pies (Greenpointer, Ricotta Be Kidding Me, and The Hometown Brisket). I think the Hometown Brisket was our favorite only because of the BBQ sauce. Other than that, there wasn't much brisket pieces on the pizza. Ricotta Be Kidding Me was okay. The Greenpointer was all greens so that balanced our meal a little bit. I hear people waiting for hours to get a seat here and right now I'm just wondering where all the hype went? We came when they were opening, so thank goodness we didn't wait on line for this...cause it wouldn't have been worth it. FYI: There's no sign outside that says ""Paulie Gee's"". You just have to look by the address number ""60"" in order to find this place. I actually walked passed it while we were trying to find it. Also, use your flash on your phones to read the menu. I really liked the rustic interior but it was literally pitch black in there.",3.0
"Zagat rated the hellboy as the best pizza in NYC. Wow! Big call Zagat... We had to try! We would say it was delicious... But I would have to say Marta is equal of not just ahead. We got here at 6:40 and had to wait over an hr to sit at the bar. When getting here service was prompt and food was great! We ordered the hellboy and the hellified porkpie white and I have to say it was fresh, full of flavor and great value. My only critique would be more hot suppressa on the hellified and take numbers at the door! It's a little unreasonable to ask people to wait 90 mins and not offer to call when table it ready. Either way it was great but probably won't be crossing the river to wait another 90 mins.",4.0

I would highly recommend this tactic to those of you who have been meaning to come and haven't been able to due to the wait -- the food will be worth it. We ordered the hellboy, ricotta be kidding me and the hot honey ice cream Sunday for dessert. The hellboy was our fave. It was basically a pepperoni pizza with hot honey lined under the cheese.

"My husband and I visited Paulie Gee's about two years ago and he still dreams of the Hellboy. This time we ordered the Hellboy and Cherry Jones.  The Hellboy was great but just a touch too sweet for me.  The hot honey adds a little kick but is definitely not too hot.  My husband will tell you it is the best pizza he has ever had (saying a lot since he was raised in the Bronx).  The Cherry Jones on the other hand was way too sweet for both of us.  I couldn't taste anything other then honey.  My husband embarrassed me by telling the waitress we didn't like it.  She offered us a replacement.  We ordered the Ricky Ricotta.  It was alright.  I was shocked because the ricotta was not warm.  The crust at Paulie Gee's is the perfect texture.  However, two of our three pizzas were too charred for my taste.  I must mention Paulie walks around all the tables to make sure everyone is enjoying.  Love it!  The restaurant is too dark and loud for my taste.",3.0

"Some of the best za in the city, bar none. The lady and I traveled far and wide for it since we'd heard such great things. It was a Friday night so the restaurant was predictably packed. There's not much in the form of a waiting area, which particularly sucked given how freezing the weather was, but we had a feeling the pie would be well worth the wait (plus we also got to watch a tipsy couple aggressively suck face up close and personal which was an unexpected but enjoyable twist).The vibe was cool, featuring low--lighting, a huge and beautiful custom brick oven, and trendy attractive people who's favorite bands you've never heard of.When we finally were seated I was stoked to see the menu offered a huge variety of pies with all sorts of niche toppings AND vegan options(I personally don't give two damns about veganism but they presented them in an unpretentious way so I was cool with it). We eventually decided to go with the Hell Boy and the Prokypineapple, both of which were amazing, and I'm looking forward to going back and further chowing my way down the menu.Go here.",5.0
"After a 2-hours wait on a weekend for a party of 2, we finally got a table at the renowned pizza shop in Brooklyn. After having one of the best pizzas of all time at Little Isabella located in Baltimore, I was on the mission to find its companion in NYC. Overhyped as we suspected, Paulie Gee had nothing on Little Isabella! Perhaps, it was the quirky blend of sweet and savory flavors, but with that 2-hour wait, we surely did not have a pleasing experience.We ordered two pies: HellBoy and Greenpointer. HellBoy: Fresh Mozzarella, Italian Tomatoes, Berkshire Sopressata Piccante, Parmigiano Reggiano and Mike's HOT HoneyGreenpointer:Fresh Mozzarella, Baby Arugula, Olive Oil, Fresh Lemon Juice and Shaved Parmigiano ReggianoWe didn't really enjoy the sweetness of the honey in the HellBoy or the sourness of the lemon juice in the Greenpointer. Fresh, as we saw them make each pie to order, I definitely thought the doughiness of the pizza wasn't anything spectacular. In terms of service, I think it was pretty solid. Our waiter was patient and helpful. As a surprise, Paulie Gee himself introduced himself to just about every table, making it feel quite personable. In all, I definitely wouldn't return back to this pizzeria, especially with that crazy wait. During that 2-hour wait and 1.5-hour dining time, I can drive down to Baltimore and get some Little Isabella for half the price and no wait!",3.0
"3.5 stars for this pizza joint hidden behind a HUGE wooden door all the way down Franklin streetCrust was good with a nice char on the hellboy but the crust of the greenpoint pizza seemed a bit underdone We were quoted a 1.5 hour wait at 8pm for 3 on a Saturday but we were lucky that people in front of us hadn't returned so we were seated right away! (so don't be discouraged)---hellboy: everything was good about this except that spicy honey! Should of gone with a more classic margherita style pizza instead---greenpoint: fresh arugula, with a bit too much lemon juice, so nothing special NOTE: they don't have pepper flakes, only chili oil",4.0
"If you want great pizza and the right atmosphere look no further than Paulie Gee's. We sat at the bar (luckily) and avoided a two hour wait.  The pizza choices are numerous, with some very creative options. There were three of us and we started with two pies. Would have been content but it was so good we ordered a third.The texture. The crust. The toppings. Hard pressed to mention anything I didn't like. I love pizza and this place is right up there with the best. That includes many pizzerias throughout Italy.Paulie stopped by for a chat and he has a fantastic personality. Great stories and it is obvious that he loves what he does and holds him team to very high standards.He was also kind enough to give me an official Paulie Gee's pin and a limoncello. A very nice touch!Make sure you check out the pizza oven in the back. It's a small,cozy place so don't pass this place up in you are in NY.",5.0
I take my pizza very seriously. The vegan pizza is so good here that if they didn't tell you it was vegan you would have no clue. I had the pie with vegan sausage and shared a few others with friends. It was all out of this world. I can't wait to go back again.,5.0
"There's a LOT of really great pizza in NYC, that's nothing new. But combine amazing pizza with friendly, caring service and a killer ambiance, and Paulie Gee's has a leg up on a lot of the other heavy hitters. The wait can be crazy, but we came in on a Tuesday night and it was half empty. I guess the key is to come when there's post-blizzard sludge everywhere and no one else wants to go out. Paulie Gee was there as I'm told he usually is, weaving around the space with his cup of coffee and stopping at literally every table. For us, he offered to curate our pizza order and who were we to argue? Read on for what Paulie Gee himself recommends:- The Greenpointer: according to Paulie, basically like eating a salad due to the piles of fresh baby arugula on top. - The Mo Cheeks: My personal favorite of the meal. The pickled onions on there are a nice surprise, and give a nice kick to the rest of the ingredients. - The Monte Cristo: OK, so this is probably something I would never think to order myself, but I'm glad it came out for us because it's actually super tasty. It comes with Canadian bacon and a drizzle of maple syrup, which I know sounds weird but trust me (or rather, trust Paulie). - I didn't catch the name of the last pizza, but it was one of the best and after peeking at the menu again I think it might have been the Hellboy. It was piled high with the tastiest Berkshire Sopressata, and it was perfect with the side of Mike's hot honey (which you haven't tried on pizza you must immediately). They asked if we wanted a dessert pizza but at that point we were stuffed to the gills. It was one of the best New York pizza experiences I've had so far, and the service is what really puts them above and beyond. I'm going to run for vice-president of the Paulie Gee fanclub soon!",5.0
"Came here a few days ago with my friend after work. Very dark inside, took some time for my eyeballs to adjust lol. We started off with some beers and then went with the Hellboy which was AMAZING. The hot honey makes a difference! Then we went with a vegan pie since neither one of us was particularly full. We ordered one with spinach, sea salt and garlic on it (sorry don't remember the name!) It was OK, not that memorable. The standout is by far Hellboy, the crust for both pizzas was SUPER THIN, firm and didn't fall apart on me. We both liked it. I took off a star for the spinach pie being nothing special and that it's a bit on the pricey side. Overall, I think I'll be back to try the other pizzas on the menu!",4.0
"Maybe we came on an off night, but we didn't care too much about the pizza and it was definitely not the best we've had. My friend wanted to celebrate her belated birthday at Paulie Gee's and so we did. We ordered 3 pies (Greenpointer, Ricotta Be Kidding Me, and The Hometown Brisket). I think the Hometown Brisket was our favorite only because of the BBQ sauce. Other than that, there wasn't much brisket pieces on the pizza. Ricotta Be Kidding Me was okay. The Greenpointer was all greens so that balanced our meal a little bit. I hear people waiting for hours to get a seat here and right now I'm just wondering where all the hype went? We came when they were opening, so thank goodness we didn't wait on line for this...cause it wouldn't have been worth it. FYI: There's no sign outside that says ""Paulie Gee's"". You just have to look by the address number ""60"" in order to find this place. I actually walked passed it while we were trying to find it. Also, use your flash on your phones to read the menu. I really liked the rustic interior but it was literally pitch black in there.",3.0
"Zagat rated the hellboy as the best pizza in NYC. Wow! Big call Zagat... We had to try! We would say it was delicious... But I would have to say Marta is equal of not just ahead. We got here at 6:40 and had to wait over an hr to sit at the bar. When getting here service was prompt and food was great! We ordered the hellboy and the hellified porkpie white and I have to say it was fresh, full of flavor and great value. My only critique would be more hot suppressa on the hellified and take numbers at the door! It's a little unreasonable to ask people to wait 90 mins and not offer to call when table it ready. Either way it was great but probably won't be crossing the river to wait another 90 mins.",4.0
"If there was ever a restaurant that inspires the need for #PiDay (3.14) to be everyday, it is Paulie Gee's. The pizza is a true art, and every bite is important, from the center to the crust crust.  PG is located in pizza heaven, or right near the water on Greenpoint Ave if you want a Google Map friendly address.Read it on my blog: highclasstohighlifes.com…As you'll see below I'm constantly on the proscuitt of happiness but this time we went for a different ham, Canadian bacon, and on the Monte Cristo. You bet it counted towards happiness. This pizza combines maple syrup drizzle and gouda with the ham. Yes, yes and more yes. Paulie asked if we had butter on the crust...sadly, no. SO MUCH REGRET....that I'll be back in no time to try it. You'll notice on the menu that they have a brisket pizza that features Hometown BBQ -- I love this local BK collaboration. You can get sauced the other way too with Greenpoint local brews!Anyway, I have nearly eaten my way through the entire menu (still need to do a bit of adventuring on the vegan side, every time I get close, I just want meat...) and I have been very pleased with every slice thus far. Therefore my advice to you is go with the pizza that's toppings are most appealing...or grab a handful of friends and share, then you can try multiple pizzas!The man, who is not a myth, but definitely a legend is often found inside checking in on tables, ensuring quality control and getting to know the patrons. He loved my last Instagram post that did a little play words...sharing that I was on the prosciutt of happiness with his King Henry Classic. He's always all smiles and usually wearing a great hat, he is Paulie Gee himself. Paulie Gee's - High Class to High Lifes If you really knead to get delivery or pickup, you'll have to look elsewhere for now though. The only way to leave Paulie Gee's with a to-go box is with leftovers. Rumor has it that a slice joint is opening up nearby though! I'm counting down the days, hours and minutes. Want to keep drooling? Read the menu!Pro Tip: Grab dinner at Paulie Gee's then walk straight out on the water in Greenpoint to Transmitter park or the outlook. Maybe even catch a sunset and BYO night cap!",5.0
"My old pal Carlos and I visited Paulie Gee's last night and had a great meal. I'm accustomed to going with the ol' vegan girlfriend and have a tradition where we split two pies from their extensive vegan selection, so we can try two different types of pies. The vegan and non-vegan selections are both extensive; each category has at least a half dozen kinds of pies, including oil bases, white slices, marinara, spinach-based, spicy honey and barbecue sauce foundations. The pies are aesthetically pleasing to every sense, well, every sense except sound. It's usually better when sound isn't a factor. At least when you're talking about food. When you're talking about music, sound is obviously a very important sense to talk about. I may go as far as to say that in a conversation about music, sound is the only sense that matters.I was excited to go with Carlos because I was going to get to eat their meat and actual cheese. The Paulie Gee's brisket is lean and delicious. Their pickled red onions possess a truly memorable tang and are worth spending a couple buck to add on to pretty much any pie. The ricotta dollops on the Ricky Ricotta feel more like bursts of a cream sauce than regular old cheese. Interestingly, the dairy and non-dairy ricotta cheeses are almost indecipherable in quality, which goes to show that Paulie Gee's knows what's up. Carlos and I were pleased to compliment the trad Italian flavors of the Ricky Ricotta with a tangy Barbecue Brisket pie. I'm psyched to go with a fellow omnivore again, because there are tons of other flavor combos I'm eager to try. New Yorkers, such as myself, are notorious for being dicks about the quality of pizza dough. It's the dough that invalidates the Chicago Deep Dish's false aspiration to pizza status. I can't stand Sicilian pizza either, which is a controversial take in Nueva York. Anyhow, no matter how well adorned a Paulie Gee's pie is, its base--the crust--is its most distinct and wonderful element. The crust is thin but springy, and always a little charred. It's pretty much naan bread, which is either a very luck coincidence or a visionary innovation. Naan bread, as you know, is lit, and, as it turns out, it is the perfect surface upon which various pizza ingredients should be placed and/or spread to mingle harmoniously.I've visited Paulie Gee's a number of times, and there's a bit of narrative that forms around my visits. The first time I tried to go, it was around noon, and my gf and I made the unpleasant discovery that Paulie Gee's does not open til 5 PM. The next time, we rolled up in a deep crew of six and had to wait about two to three hours for a table for six. If you find yourself in that position, you'll be okay though because there are plenty of bars around. There's also the water/skyline, mere yards away and a nice record store a block away.The gf and I have gone a few other times and it's always been great--except for the one time that a camera crew was shooting a special on Paulie Gee's vegan options. My girlfriend and I were in the shot all throughout our meal, and we were fighting (as subtly as possible) for the duration of our meal. I was taken aback and somewhat miffed when the producers of the show asked to do a talking head with us outside. The tension was palpable but they still insisted on interviewing us. I really do believe that you should foot the bill if you're going to interview someone for your television series or web series or gratuitously long Yelp review or whatever. At LEAST commission me to write a song for the soundtrack.In closing, I would like to offer a lil sum sum for the ladies. Are you interested in grandfatherly, charmingly blue collar, short men whose personalities closely resemble those of most Robert De Niro characters--but only in David O. Russel movies? If you do, and might want to be possibly hit on by a man of this caliber, you will love Paulie Gee's. At all times, Paulie Gee's eponymous Pizza Architect and Entrepreneur, Paulie Gee, stalks the narrow spaces between tables, checking in with customers--particularly of the reasonably attractive female demographic--and asks them how their food is, making small talk and thanking them for their patronage. I think this is cool. I would do the same if I were in his position, so don't take this the wrong way. Central to Paulie Gee's game is his ability to recommend a pizza place in seemingly every zip code on the planet and his inclination to tell you (the lady in question) the name of the dude who works there/owns the place, and to tell you (still the lady in question) to tell the dude (who owns the pizza place) to say that he (Paulie Gee) says hi. The Brotherhood of Pizza Mans is truly alive and well.",5.0

"I almost feel like it's blasphemy for not giving 5 stars. Finally made my way over here at Paulie Gees after way too long. Clearly this place is GPs staple so was excited to drop by on Wednesday night.There was no wait- very good. I had been worried about this so called 3x around 6:45pm to see how long it was before heading over. No one picked up and their answering service basically hangs up on you. I ordered the Daniela and he ordered the brisket pizza. Mine came out a good 7 minutes before his. I noticed immediately that about 40% of the crust was charred to the point of being inedible. To top that off, the spinach topping my pizza was the same. It was literally a black piece of ash and when I picked a leaf up or crumbled in my hands. The cheese blend was very good (mozzarella and Parmesan) but the pizza was just not good. To top it off, parts of the center were soggy and didn't hold the toppings when I grabbed a slice. When the brisket pizza came out a few minutes later I noticed immediately that it was cooked perfectly. The crust was edible and delicious. I was bummed that mine didn't come out this way especially since it seemed like a classic. All I can say is they probably put our orders in together and maybe his needed a little longer in the oven. Mine was most likely getting over cooked while his needed a few more minutes. Hence the gap in time between both of our orders coming out and the reason why mine was half done by the time his came out.I was really disappointed but the good thing to know is at least the brisket pizza was cooked well. I know there is a good meal at Paulie Gees but I feel like we were jipped.Also, great touch that Paulie himself came in to greet all the diners. He was super friendly and it brings a family quality to the place. This is maybe one of the main reasons I'd come back.",3.0

There's not much in the form of a waiting area, which particularly sucked given how freezing the weather was, but we had a feeling the pie would be well worth the wait (plus we also got to watch a tipsy couple aggressively suck face up close and personal which was an unexpected but enjoyable twist).The vibe was cool, featuring low--lighting, a huge and beautiful custom brick oven, and trendy attractive people who's favorite bands you've never heard of.When we finally were seated I was stoked to see the menu offered a huge variety of pies with all sorts of niche toppings AND vegan options(I personally don't give two damns about veganism but they presented them in an unpretentious way so I was cool with it). We eventually decided to go with the Hell Boy and the Prokypineapple, both of which were amazing, and I'm looking forward to going back and further chowing my way down the menu.Go here.",5.0
"After a 2-hours wait on a weekend for a party of 2, we finally got a table at the renowned pizza shop in Brooklyn. After having one of the best pizzas of all time at Little Isabella located in Baltimore, I was on the mission to find its companion in NYC. Overhyped as we suspected, Paulie Gee had nothing on Little Isabella! Perhaps, it was the quirky blend of sweet and savory flavors, but with that 2-hour wait, we surely did not have a pleasing experience.We ordered two pies: HellBoy and Greenpointer. HellBoy: Fresh Mozzarella, Italian Tomatoes, Berkshire Sopressata Piccante, Parmigiano Reggiano and Mike's HOT HoneyGreenpointer:Fresh Mozzarella, Baby Arugula, Olive Oil, Fresh Lemon Juice and Shaved Parmigiano ReggianoWe didn't really enjoy the sweetness of the honey in the HellBoy or the sourness of the lemon juice in the Greenpointer. Fresh, as we saw them make each pie to order, I definitely thought the doughiness of the pizza wasn't anything spectacular. In terms of service, I think it was pretty solid. Our waiter was patient and helpful. As a surprise, Paulie Gee himself introduced himself to just about every table, making it feel quite personable. In all, I definitely wouldn't return back to this pizzeria, especially with that crazy wait. During that 2-hour wait and 1.5-hour dining time, I can drive down to Baltimore and get some Little Isabella for half the price and no wait!",3.0
"3.5 stars for this pizza joint hidden behind a HUGE wooden door all the way down Franklin streetCrust was good with a nice char on the hellboy but the crust of the greenpoint pizza seemed a bit underdone We were quoted a 1.5 hour wait at 8pm for 3 on a Saturday but we were lucky that people in front of us hadn't returned so we were seated right away! (so don't be discouraged)---hellboy: everything was good about this except that spicy honey!

"If you want great pizza and the right atmosphere look no further than Paulie Gee's.

Would have been content but it was so good we ordered a third.The texture. The crust. The toppings. Hard pressed to mention anything I didn't like. I love pizza and this place is right up there with the best. That includes many pizzerias throughout Italy.Paulie stopped by for a chat and he has a fantastic personality. Great stories and it is obvious that he loves what he does and holds him team to very high standards.He was also kind enough to give me an official Paulie Gee's pin and a limoncello. A very nice touch!Make sure you check out the pizza oven in the back. It's a small,cozy place so don't pass this place up in you are in NY.",5.0
I take my pizza very seriously. The vegan pizza is so good here that if they didn't tell you it was vegan you would have no clue. I had the pie with vegan sausage and shared a few others with friends. It was all out of this world. I can't wait to go back again.,5.0
"There's a LOT of really great pizza in NYC, that's nothing new. But combine amazing pizza with friendly, caring service and a killer ambiance, and Paulie Gee's has a leg up on a lot of the other heavy hitters. The wait can be crazy, but we came in on a Tuesday night and it was half empty. I guess the key is to come when there's post-blizzard sludge everywhere and no one else wants to go out. Paulie Gee was there as I'm told he usually is, weaving around the space with his cup of coffee and stopping at literally every table. For us, he offered to curate our pizza order and who were we to argue? Read on for what Paulie Gee himself recommends:- The Greenpointer: according to Paulie, basically like eating a salad due to the piles of fresh baby arugula on top. - The Mo Cheeks: My personal favorite of the meal. The pickled onions on there are a nice surprise, and give a nice kick to the rest of the ingredients. - The Monte Cristo: OK, so this is probably something I would never think to order myself, but I'm glad it came out for us because it's actually super tasty. It comes with Canadian bacon and a drizzle of maple syrup, which I know sounds weird but trust me (or rather, trust Paulie). - I didn't catch the name of the last pizza, but it was one of the best and after peeking at the menu again I think it might have been the Hellboy. It was piled high with the tastiest Berkshire Sopressata, and it was perfect with the side of Mike's hot honey (which you haven't tried on pizza you must immediately). They asked if we wanted a dessert pizza but at that point we were stuffed to the gills. It was one of the best New York pizza experiences I've had so far, and the service is what really puts them above and beyond. I'm going to run for vice-president of the Paulie Gee fanclub soon!",5.0
"Came here a few days ago with my friend after work. Very dark inside, took some time for my eyeballs to adjust lol. We started off with some beers and then went with the Hellboy which was AMAZING. The hot honey makes a difference! Then we went with a vegan pie since neither one of us was particularly full. We ordered one with spinach, sea salt and garlic on it (sorry don't remember the name!) It was OK, not that memorable. The standout is by far Hellboy, the crust for both pizzas was SUPER THIN, firm and didn't fall apart on me. We both liked it. I took off a star for the spinach pie being nothing special and that it's a bit on the pricey side. Overall, I think I'll be back to try the other pizzas on the menu!",4.0
"Maybe we came on an off night, but we didn't care too much about the pizza and it was definitely not the best we've had. My friend wanted to celebrate her belated birthday at Paulie Gee's and so we did. We ordered 3 pies (Greenpointer, Ricotta Be Kidding Me, and The Hometown Brisket). I think the Hometown Brisket was our favorite only because of the BBQ sauce. Other than that, there wasn't much brisket pieces on the pizza. Ricotta Be Kidding Me was okay. The Greenpointer was all greens so that balanced our meal a little bit. I hear people waiting for hours to get a seat here and right now I'm just wondering where all the hype went? We came when they were opening, so thank goodness we didn't wait on line for this...cause it wouldn't have been worth it. FYI: There's no sign outside that says ""Paulie Gee's"". You just have to look by the address number ""60"" in order to find this place. I actually walked passed it while we were trying to find it. Also, use your flash on your phones to read the menu. I really liked the rustic interior but it was literally pitch black in there.",3.0
"Zagat rated the hellboy as the best pizza in NYC. Wow! Big call Zagat... We had to try! We would say it was delicious... But I would have to say Marta is equal of not just ahead. We got here at 6:40 and had to wait over an hr to sit at the bar. When getting here service was prompt and food was great! We ordered the hellboy and the hellified porkpie white and I have to say it was fresh, full of flavor and great value. My only critique would be more hot suppressa on the hellified and take numbers at the door! It's a little unreasonable to ask people to wait 90 mins and not offer to call when table it ready. Either way it was great but probably won't be crossing the river to wait another 90 mins.",4.0
"If there was ever a restaurant that inspires the need for #PiDay (3.14) to be everyday, it is Paulie Gee's. The pizza is a true art, and every bite is important, from the center to the crust crust.  PG is located in pizza heaven, or right near the water on Greenpoint Ave if you want a Google Map friendly address.Read it on my blog: highclasstohighlifes.com…As you'll see below I'm constantly on the proscuitt of happiness but this time we went for a different ham, Canadian bacon, and on the Monte Cristo. You bet it counted towards happiness. This pizza combines maple syrup drizzle and gouda with the ham. Yes, yes and more yes. Paulie asked if we had butter on the crust...sadly, no. SO MUCH REGRET....that I'll be back in no time to try it. You'll notice on the menu that they have a brisket pizza that features Hometown BBQ -- I love this local BK collaboration. You can get sauced the other way too with Greenpoint local brews!Anyway, I have nearly eaten my way through the entire menu (still need to do a bit of adventuring on the vegan side, every time I get close, I just want meat...) and I have been very pleased with every slice thus far. Therefore my advice to you is go with the pizza that's toppings are most appealing...or grab a handful of friends and share, then you can try multiple pizzas!The man, who is not a myth, but definitely a legend is often found inside checking in on tables, ensuring quality control and getting to know the patrons. He loved my last Instagram post that did a little play words...sharing that I was on the prosciutt of happiness with his King Henry Classic. He's always all smiles and usually wearing a great hat, he is Paulie Gee himself. Paulie Gee's - High Class to High Lifes If you really knead to get delivery or pickup, you'll have to look elsewhere for now though. The only way to leave Paulie Gee's with a to-go box is with leftovers. Rumor has it that a slice joint is opening up nearby though! I'm counting down the days, hours and minutes. Want to keep drooling? Read the menu!Pro Tip: Grab dinner at Paulie Gee's then walk straight out on the water in Greenpoint to Transmitter park or the outlook. Maybe even catch a sunset and BYO night cap!",5.0
"My old pal Carlos and I visited Paulie Gee's last night and had a great meal. I'm accustomed to going with the ol' vegan girlfriend and have a tradition where we split two pies from their extensive vegan selection, so we can try two different types of pies. The vegan and non-vegan selections are both extensive; each category has at least a half dozen kinds of pies, including oil bases, white slices, marinara, spinach-based, spicy honey and barbecue sauce foundations. The pies are aesthetically pleasing to every sense, well, every sense except sound. It's usually better when sound isn't a factor. At least when you're talking about food. When you're talking about music, sound is obviously a very important sense to talk about. I may go as far as to say that in a conversation about music, sound is the only sense that matters.I was excited to go with Carlos because I was going to get to eat their meat and actual cheese. The Paulie Gee's brisket is lean and delicious. Their pickled red onions possess a truly memorable tang and are worth spending a couple buck to add on to pretty much any pie. The ricotta dollops on the Ricky Ricotta feel more like bursts of a cream sauce than regular old cheese. Interestingly, the dairy and non-dairy ricotta cheeses are almost indecipherable in quality, which goes to show that Paulie Gee's knows what's up. Carlos and I were pleased to compliment the trad Italian flavors of the Ricky Ricotta with a tangy Barbecue Brisket pie. I'm psyched to go with a fellow omnivore again, because there are tons of other flavor combos I'm eager to try. New Yorkers, such as myself, are notorious for being dicks about the quality of pizza dough. It's the dough that invalidates the Chicago Deep Dish's false aspiration to pizza status. I can't stand Sicilian pizza either, which is a controversial take in Nueva York. Anyhow, no matter how well adorned a Paulie Gee's pie is, its base--the crust--is its most distinct and wonderful element. The crust is thin but springy, and always a little charred. It's pretty much naan bread, which is either a very luck coincidence or a visionary innovation. Naan bread, as you know, is lit, and, as it turns out, it is the perfect surface upon which various pizza ingredients should be placed and/or spread to mingle harmoniously.I've visited Paulie Gee's a number of times, and there's a bit of narrative that forms around my visits. The first time I tried to go, it was around noon, and my gf and I made the unpleasant discovery that Paulie Gee's does not open til 5 PM. The next time, we rolled up in a deep crew of six and had to wait about two to three hours for a table for six. If you find yourself in that position, you'll be okay though because there are plenty of bars around. There's also the water/skyline, mere yards away and a nice record store a block away.The gf and I have gone a few other times and it's always been great--except for the one time that a camera crew was shooting a special on Paulie Gee's vegan options. My girlfriend and I were in the shot all throughout our meal, and we were fighting (as subtly as possible) for the duration of our meal. I was taken aback and somewhat miffed when the producers of the show asked to do a talking head with us outside. The tension was palpable but they still insisted on interviewing us. I really do believe that you should foot the bill if you're going to interview someone for your television series or web series or gratuitously long Yelp review or whatever. At LEAST commission me to write a song for the soundtrack.In closing, I would like to offer a lil sum sum for the ladies. Are you interested in grandfatherly, charmingly blue collar, short men whose personalities closely resemble those of most Robert De Niro characters--but only in David O. Russel movies? If you do, and might want to be possibly hit on by a man of this caliber, you will love Paulie Gee's. At all times, Paulie Gee's eponymous Pizza Architect and Entrepreneur, Paulie Gee, stalks the narrow spaces between tables, checking in with customers--particularly of the reasonably attractive female demographic--and asks them how their food is, making small talk and thanking them for their patronage. I think this is cool. I would do the same if I were in his position, so don't take this the wrong way. Central to Paulie Gee's game is his ability to recommend a pizza place in seemingly every zip code on the planet and his inclination to tell you (the lady in question) the name of the dude who works there/owns the place, and to tell you (still the lady in question) to tell the dude (who owns the pizza place) to say that he (Paulie Gee) says hi. The Brotherhood of Pizza Mans is truly alive and well.",5.0

"I almost feel like it's blasphemy for not giving 5 stars. Finally made my way over here at Paulie Gees after way too long. Clearly this place is GPs staple so was excited to drop by on Wednesday night.There was no wait- very good. I had been worried about this so called 3x around 6:45pm to see how long it was before heading over. No one picked up and their answering service basically hangs up on you. I ordered the Daniela and he ordered the brisket pizza. Mine came out a good 7 minutes before his. I noticed immediately that about 40% of the crust was charred to the point of being inedible. To top that off, the spinach topping my pizza was the same. It was literally a black piece of ash and when I picked a leaf up or crumbled in my hands. The cheese blend was very good (mozzarella and Parmesan) but the pizza was just not good. To top it off, parts of the center were soggy and didn't hold the toppings when I grabbed a slice. When the brisket pizza came out a few minutes later I noticed immediately that it was cooked perfectly. The crust was edible and delicious. I was bummed that mine didn't come out this way especially since it seemed like a classic. All I can say is they probably put our orders in together and maybe his needed a little longer in the oven. Mine was most likely getting over cooked while his needed a few more minutes. Hence the gap in time between both of our orders coming out and the reason why mine was half done by the time his came out.I was really disappointed but the good thing to know is at least the brisket pizza was cooked well. I know there is a good meal at Paulie Gees but I feel like we were jipped.Also, great touch that Paulie himself came in to greet all the diners. He was super friendly and it brings a family quality to the place. This is maybe one of the main reasons I'd come back.",3.0
"Delicious!! Definitely made my top 3 favorite pizza  places (the others being robertas and best pizza). We've been meaning to come forever but the line is always so long. We were finally seated right away on a Friday night because we ran over as soon as they opened at 6pm. I would highly recommend this tactic to those of you who have been meaning to come and haven't been able to due to the wait -- the food will be worth it. We ordered the hellboy, ricotta be kidding me and the hot honey ice cream Sunday for dessert. The hellboy was our fave. It was basically a pepperoni pizza with hot honey lined under the cheese. I liked it more than the bees sting from Robertas but both are very good. All in all would highly recommend. As an extra plus Paulie Gee was hanging around today,though it seems like he does this quite often, going from table to table talking to the customers.",5.0
"My husband and I visited Paulie Gee's about two years ago and he still dreams of the Hellboy. This time we ordered the Hellboy and Cherry Jones.  The Hellboy was great but just a touch too sweet for me.  The hot honey adds a little kick but is definitely not too hot.  My husband will tell you it is the best pizza he has ever had (saying a lot since he was raised in the Bronx).  The Cherry Jones on the other hand was way too sweet for both of us.  I couldn't taste anything other then honey.  My husband embarrassed me by telling the waitress we didn't like it.  She offered us a replacement.  We ordered the Ricky Ricotta.  It was alright.  I was shocked because the ricotta was not warm.  The crust at Paulie Gee's is the perfect texture.  However, two of our three pizzas were too charred for my taste.  I must mention Paulie walks around all the tables to make sure everyone is enjoying.  Love it!  The restaurant is too dark and loud for my taste.",3.0
"Interesting decor, super dark inside and it was hard to read the menu. We were seated under one of the speakers, so I felt like an old person complaining about how loud the music was, but really, we came for the food. Split a salad and a Greenpointer pie, and neither disappointed. Both were served quickly, and the pie just exploded with flavor. The lemon kick was strong but not overwhelming, and the crust was perfection. Service was attentive, friendly, and efficient. Lots of menu choices for anything your palate is craving. Overall, a very good experience, and one I would look forward to enjoying again.",4.0
"New York probably takes its pizza more seriously than anywhere else in the world.  I'm sure there are 7 or 8 people reading this right now that would be willing to shiv a guy for saying something bad about their favorite slice.  With that in mind, Paulie Gee's is a pizza lover's pizza place.  They make Neapolitan style pizzas with an oven shipped in from Naples and lovingly reassembled by small, Italian elves.  From this oven, comes perfectly leopard-spotted pizzas with just the right amount of bouncy chewy dough.To top the pizza, there's a lovingly curated selection to choose from so don't you dare ask for substitutions.  Lucky for you whether you're a vegan, vegetarian, white/red pie lover, averse to spice, meat lover, or whatever!  There's at least one pie on the menu* that will make you say, ""hmmm..."".  My personal favorites are the Mo' Cheeks ($16, has guanciale and is perfect with the pickled onions) and Ricotta Be Kidding Me ($17, with tons of meat topped with adorable dollops of cottage cheese).  I've only ever had 1 pizza there that wasn't stellar and I won't tell you which one because you'll definitely judge me for choosing it in the first place.The atmosphere at Paulie Gee's is great.  It's quintessential Brooklyn.  Think dark unfinished wood walls with an eclectic collection of tables made from reclaimed wood, music consisting of a mixture of jazz, rock, and anything but top 40s.  What always makes my night is that the ACTUAL Paulie Gee walks around and talks to EVERYONE.  It doesn't matter if Keri Russell** is sitting right next to you, he will still come by and have a 5-20 minute conversation with you and your table.  My only complaint is how popular this place is.  They've stopped making pizzas to go and still, the wait is crazy.  I've never been able to get a table in less than 45 minutes unless it was late at night.  I guess that's not a bad problem to have.  I also kind of wish they would get a full liquor license and take that creative pizza combo creating mind into the cocktail realm.  I mean...Mike's Hot Honey + Whiskey?  Maybe?---------* If you can't find a pizza you like on the printed menu in the restaurant, whip out the smartphone and check out the ""secret"" menu on the website.** This actually happened.",4.0
"We've literally flown across the country to enjoy his pizza. It's that good! Walking in, the aroma of pizza cooking in a brick oven hits your nose.This is about time my stomach starts to growl. The vibe is flowing with positive energy, and the low lighting is flattering & sexy. The bar to the left is where you can order a beverage while you wait.  They have a decent beer selection. Wait times vary, but it's usually not as long as anticipated, and well worth the effort.Everyone, including the servers, seem happy to be there.Paulie Gee is the utmost host. He's always found time to come to our table with suggestions, stories, and the occasional limoncello, (his recipe of the celebratory cocktail).Talking with him, I've gathered that he makes the vegan pizza for the people, or demand for it, but he didn't seem interested in the cause.

"Absolutely delicious. Huge selection of pies - good for meatatarians, vegetarians, and even vegans. Wood fire oven delivers the signature light smoke and char. Dough is absolutely tender and springy. They even let the pizza rest afterwards so the cheese sets and you don't burn the crap out of your mouth.Hellboy- spicy pepperoni with hot honey. Absolute classic pizza. Hot honey perfectly blankets the spicy meat. Super simple, absolutely delicious. Get two, trust meRicotta/sausage pie - similar to one above, hot honey included. However ricotta and sausage are a welcome addition.

Someone sitting next to us saw our struggle and took us to try the  IN Ricotta Da Vegan so we did. AMAZING!!

"My old pal Carlos and I visited Paulie Gee's last night and had a great meal. I'm accustomed to going with the ol' vegan girlfriend and have a tradition where we split two pies from their extensive vegan selection, so we can try two different types of pies. The vegan and non-vegan selections are both extensive; each category has at least a half dozen kinds of pies, including oil bases, white slices, marinara, spinach-based, spicy honey and barbecue sauce foundations. The pies are aesthetically pleasing to every sense, well, every sense except sound. It's usually better when sound isn't a factor. At least when you're talking about food. When you're talking about music, sound is obviously a very important sense to talk about. I may go as far as to say that in a conversation about music, sound is the only sense that matters.I was excited to go with Carlos because I was going to get to eat their meat and actual cheese. The Paulie Gee's brisket is lean and delicious. Their pickled red onions possess a truly memorable tang and are worth spending a couple buck to add on to pretty much any pie. The ricotta dollops on the Ricky Ricotta feel more like bursts of a cream sauce than regular old cheese. Interestingly, the dairy and non-dairy ricotta cheeses are almost indecipherable in quality, which goes to show that Paulie Gee's knows what's up. Carlos and I were pleased to compliment the trad Italian flavors of the Ricky Ricotta with a tangy Barbecue Brisket pie. I'm psyched to go with a fellow omnivore again, because there are tons of other flavor combos I'm eager to try. New Yorkers, such as myself, are notorious for being dicks about the quality of pizza dough. It's the dough that invalidates the Chicago Deep Dish's false aspiration to pizza status. I can't stand Sicilian pizza either, which is a controversial take in Nueva York. Anyhow, no matter how well adorned a Paulie Gee's pie is, its base--the crust--is its most distinct and wonderful element. The crust is thin but springy, and always a little charred. It's pretty much naan bread, which is either a very luck coincidence or a visionary innovation. Naan bread, as you know, is lit, and, as it turns out, it is the perfect surface upon which various pizza ingredients should be placed and/or spread to mingle harmoniously.I've visited Paulie Gee's a number of times, and there's a bit of narrative that forms around my visits. The first time I tried to go, it was around noon, and my gf and I made the unpleasant discovery that Paulie Gee's does not open til 5 PM. The next time, we rolled up in a deep crew of six and had to wait about two to three hours for a table for six. If you find yourself in that position, you'll be okay though because there are plenty of bars around. There's also the water/skyline, mere yards away and a nice record store a block away.The gf and I have gone a few other times and it's always been great--except for the one time that a camera crew was shooting a special on Paulie Gee's vegan options. My girlfriend and I were in the shot all throughout our meal, and we were fighting (as subtly as possible) for the duration of our meal. I was taken aback and somewhat miffed when the producers of the show asked to do a talking head with us outside. The tension was palpable but they still insisted on interviewing us. I really do believe that you should foot the bill if you're going to interview someone for your television series or web series or gratuitously long Yelp review or whatever.

"I almost feel like it's blasphemy for not giving 5 stars. Finally made my way over here at Paulie Gees after way too long. Clearly this place is GPs staple so was excited to drop by on Wednesday night.There was no wait- very good. I had been worried about this so called 3x around 6:45pm to see how long it was before heading over. No one picked up and their answering service basically hangs up on you. I ordered the Daniela and he ordered the brisket pizza. Mine came out a good 7 minutes before his. I noticed immediately that about 40% of the crust was charred to the point of being inedible. To top that off, the spinach topping my pizza was the same. It was literally a black piece of ash and when I picked a leaf up or crumbled in my hands. The cheese blend was very good (mozzarella and Parmesan) but the pizza was just not good. To top it off, parts of the center were soggy and didn't hold the toppings when I grabbed a slice. When the brisket pizza came out a few minutes later I noticed immediately that it was cooked perfectly. The crust was edible and delicious. I was bummed that mine didn't come out this way especially since it seemed like a classic. All I can say is they probably put our orders in together and maybe his needed a little longer in the oven. Mine was most likely getting over cooked while his needed a few more minutes. Hence the gap in time between both of our orders coming out and the reason why mine was half done by the time his came out.I was really disappointed but the good thing to know is at least the brisket pizza was cooked well. I know there is a good meal at Paulie Gees but I feel like we were jipped.Also, great touch that Paulie himself came in to greet all the diners. He was super friendly and it brings a family quality to the place. This is maybe one of the main reasons I'd come back.",3.0
"Delicious!! Definitely made my top 3 favorite pizza  places (the others being robertas and best pizza). We've been meaning to come forever but the line is always so long. We were finally seated right away on a Friday night because we ran over as soon as they opened at 6pm. I would highly recommend this tactic to those of you who have been meaning to come and haven't been able to due to the wait -- the food will be worth it. We ordered the hellboy, ricotta be kidding me and the hot honey ice cream Sunday for dessert. The hellboy was our fave. It was basically a pepperoni pizza with hot honey lined under the cheese. I liked it more than the bees sting from Robertas but both are very good. All in all would highly recommend. As an extra plus Paulie Gee was hanging around today,though it seems like he does this quite often, going from table to table talking to the customers.",5.0
"My husband and I visited Paulie Gee's about two years ago and he still dreams of the Hellboy. This time we ordered the Hellboy and Cherry Jones.  The Hellboy was great but just a touch too sweet for me.  The hot honey adds a little kick but is definitely not too hot.  My husband will tell you it is the best pizza he has ever had (saying a lot since he was raised in the Bronx).  The Cherry Jones on the other hand was way too sweet for both of us.  I couldn't taste anything other then honey.  My husband embarrassed me by telling the waitress we didn't like it.  She offered us a replacement.  We ordered the Ricky Ricotta.  It was alright.  I was shocked because the ricotta was not warm.  The crust at Paulie Gee's is the perfect texture.  However, two of our three pizzas were too charred for my taste.  I must mention Paulie walks around all the tables to make sure everyone is enjoying.  Love it!  The restaurant is too dark and loud for my taste.",3.0
"Interesting decor, super dark inside and it was hard to read the menu. We were seated under one of the speakers, so I felt like an old person complaining about how loud the music was, but really, we came for the food. Split a salad and a Greenpointer pie, and neither disappointed. Both were served quickly, and the pie just exploded with flavor. The lemon kick was strong but not overwhelming, and the crust was perfection. Service was attentive, friendly, and efficient. Lots of menu choices for anything your palate is craving. Overall, a very good experience, and one I would look forward to enjoying again.",4.0
"New York probably takes its pizza more seriously than anywhere else in the world.  I'm sure there are 7 or 8 people reading this right now that would be willing to shiv a guy for saying something bad about their favorite slice.  With that in mind, Paulie Gee's is a pizza lover's pizza place.  They make Neapolitan style pizzas with an oven shipped in from Naples and lovingly reassembled by small, Italian elves.  From this oven, comes perfectly leopard-spotted pizzas with just the right amount of bouncy chewy dough.To top the pizza, there's a lovingly curated selection to choose from so don't you dare ask for substitutions.  Lucky for you whether you're a vegan, vegetarian, white/red pie lover, averse to spice, meat lover, or whatever!  There's at least one pie on the menu* that will make you say, ""hmmm..."".  My personal favorites are the Mo' Cheeks ($16, has guanciale and is perfect with the pickled onions) and Ricotta Be Kidding Me ($17, with tons of meat topped with adorable dollops of cottage cheese).  I've only ever had 1 pizza there that wasn't stellar and I won't tell you which one because you'll definitely judge me for choosing it in the first place.The atmosphere at Paulie Gee's is great.  It's quintessential Brooklyn.  Think dark unfinished wood walls with an eclectic collection of tables made from reclaimed wood, music consisting of a mixture of jazz, rock, and anything but top 40s.  What always makes my night is that the ACTUAL Paulie Gee walks around and talks to EVERYONE.  It doesn't matter if Keri Russell** is sitting right next to you, he will still come by and have a 5-20 minute conversation with you and your table.  My only complaint is how popular this place is.  They've stopped making pizzas to go and still, the wait is crazy.  I've never been able to get a table in less than 45 minutes unless it was late at night.  I guess that's not a bad problem to have.  I also kind of wish they would get a full liquor license and take that creative pizza combo creating mind into the cocktail realm.  I mean...Mike's Hot Honey + Whiskey?  Maybe?---------* If you can't find a pizza you like on the printed menu in the restaurant, whip out the smartphone and check out the ""secret"" menu on the website.** This actually happened.",4.0
"We've literally flown across the country to enjoy his pizza. It's that good! Walking in, the aroma of pizza cooking in a brick oven hits your nose.This is about time my stomach starts to growl. The vibe is flowing with positive energy, and the low lighting is flattering & sexy. The bar to the left is where you can order a beverage while you wait.  They have a decent beer selection. Wait times vary, but it's usually not as long as anticipated, and well worth the effort.Everyone, including the servers, seem happy to be there.Paulie Gee is the utmost host. He's always found time to come to our table with suggestions, stories, and the occasional limoncello, (his recipe of the celebratory cocktail).Talking with him, I've gathered that he makes the vegan pizza for the people, or demand for it, but he didn't seem interested in the cause. The funky bathrooms can be a challenge to use when you've had one too many! VEGAN Pies we LOVE Simply RedVegan Tomato Sauce with Tomatoes, Olive Oil.

"Absolutely delicious. Huge selection of pies - good for meatatarians, vegetarians, and even vegans. Wood fire oven delivers the signature light smoke and char. Dough is absolutely tender and springy. They even let the pizza rest afterwards so the cheese sets and you don't burn the crap out of your mouth.Hellboy- spicy pepperoni with hot honey. Absolute classic pizza. Hot honey perfectly blankets the spicy meat. Super simple, absolutely delicious. Get two, trust meRicotta/sausage pie - similar to one above, hot honey included. However ricotta and sausage are a welcome addition. While chunks of roasted garlic are an excellent accentSo many other pies, go try them for yourself.Big lines, put your name down and go drink at browerij lane.

"One of the challenges of  being vegan is getting your friends/family to be open to the idea of trying vegan food.I have never had Vegan Pizza before and I usually try to try a restaurant first before recommending to anyone especially a non vegan but I took a chance.When we first arrived we were having trouble picking something since everything was foreign to us. Someone sitting next to us saw our struggle and took us to try the  IN Ricotta Da Vegan so we did. AMAZING!! My non vegan date was impressed and I was so happy.Thanks Paulie Gee for making me looking good Whew! One pie (6 small slices) goes for 16 bucks . Its small, nice ambiance I would say its a little darkI would go again!Menu like here ------ pauliegee.com/greenpoint… xoxoC.",4.0
"Some of the best za in the city, bar none. The lady and I traveled far and wide for it since we'd heard such great things. It was a Friday night so the restaurant was predictably packed. There's not much in the form of a waiting area, which particularly sucked given how freezing the weather was, but we had a feeling the pie would be well worth the wait (plus we also got to watch a tipsy couple aggressively suck face up close and personal which was an unexpected but enjoyable twist).The vibe was cool, featuring low--lighting, a huge and beautiful custom brick oven, and trendy attractive people who's favorite bands you've never heard of.When we finally were seated I was stoked to see the menu offered a huge variety of pies with all sorts of niche toppings AND vegan options(I personally don't give two damns about veganism but they presented them in an unpretentious way so I was cool with it). We eventually decided to go with the Hell Boy and the Prokypineapple, both of which were amazing, and I'm looking forward to going back and further chowing my way down the menu.Go here.",5.0
"After a 2-hours wait on a weekend for a party of 2, we finally got a table at the renowned pizza shop in Brooklyn. After having one of the best pizzas of all time at Little Isabella located in Baltimore, I was on the mission to find its companion in NYC. Overhyped as we suspected, Paulie Gee had nothing on Little Isabella! Perhaps, it was the quirky blend of sweet and savory flavors, but with that 2-hour wait, we surely did not have a pleasing experience.We ordered two pies: HellBoy and Greenpointer. HellBoy: Fresh Mozzarella, Italian Tomatoes, Berkshire Sopressata Piccante, Parmigiano Reggiano and Mike's HOT HoneyGreenpointer:Fresh Mozzarella, Baby Arugula, Olive Oil, Fresh Lemon Juice and Shaved Parmigiano ReggianoWe didn't really enjoy the sweetness of the honey in the HellBoy or the sourness of the lemon juice in the Greenpointer. Fresh, as we saw them make each pie to order, I definitely thought the doughiness of the pizza wasn't anything spectacular. In terms of service, I think it was pretty solid. Our waiter was patient and helpful. As a surprise, Paulie Gee himself introduced himself to just about every table, making it feel quite personable. In all, I definitely wouldn't return back to this pizzeria, especially with that crazy wait. During that 2-hour wait and 1.5-hour dining time, I can drive down to Baltimore and get some Little Isabella for half the price and no wait!",3.0
"3.5 stars for this pizza joint hidden behind a HUGE wooden door all the way down Franklin streetCrust was good with a nice char on the hellboy but the crust of the greenpoint pizza seemed a bit underdone We were quoted a 1.5 hour wait at 8pm for 3 on a Saturday but we were lucky that people in front of us hadn't returned so we were seated right away! (so don't be discouraged)---hellboy: everything was good about this except that spicy honey! Should of gone with a more classic margherita style pizza instead---greenpoint: fresh arugula, with a bit too much lemon juice, so nothing special NOTE: they don't have pepper flakes, only chili oil",4.0
"If you want great pizza and the right atmosphere look no further than Paulie Gee's. We sat at the bar (luckily) and avoided a two hour wait.  The pizza choices are numerous, with some very creative options. There were three of us and we started with two pies. Would have been content but it was so good we ordered a third.The texture. The crust. The toppings. Hard pressed to mention anything I didn't like. I love pizza and this place is right up there with the best. That includes many pizzerias throughout Italy.Paulie stopped by for a chat and he has a fantastic personality. Great stories and it is obvious that he loves what he does and holds him team to very high standards.He was also kind enough to give me an official Paulie Gee's pin and a limoncello. A very nice touch!Make sure you check out the pizza oven in the back. It's a small,cozy place so don't pass this place up in you are in NY.",5.0
I take my pizza very seriously. The vegan pizza is so good here that if they didn't tell you it was vegan you would have no clue. I had the pie with vegan sausage and shared a few others with friends. It was all out of this world. I can't wait to go back again.,5.0
"There's a LOT of really great pizza in NYC, that's nothing new. But combine amazing pizza with friendly, caring service and a killer ambiance, and Paulie Gee's has a leg up on a lot of the other heavy hitters. The wait can be crazy, but we came in on a Tuesday night and it was half empty. I guess the key is to come when there's post-blizzard sludge everywhere and no one else wants to go out. Paulie Gee was there as I'm told he usually is, weaving around the space with his cup of coffee and stopping at literally every table. For us, he offered to curate our pizza order and who were we to argue? Read on for what Paulie Gee himself recommends:- The Greenpointer: according to Paulie, basically like eating a salad due to the piles of fresh baby arugula on top. - The Mo Cheeks: My personal favorite of the meal. The pickled onions on there are a nice surprise, and give a nice kick to the rest of the ingredients. - The Monte Cristo: OK, so this is probably something I would never think to order myself, but I'm glad it came out for us because it's actually super tasty. It comes with Canadian bacon and a drizzle of maple syrup, which I know sounds weird but trust me (or rather, trust Paulie). - I didn't catch the name of the last pizza, but it was one of the best and after peeking at the menu again I think it might have been the Hellboy. It was piled high with the tastiest Berkshire Sopressata, and it was perfect with the side of Mike's hot honey (which you haven't tried on pizza you must immediately). They asked if we wanted a dessert pizza but at that point we were stuffed to the gills. It was one of the best New York pizza experiences I've had so far, and the service is what really puts them above and beyond. I'm going to run for vice-president of the Paulie Gee fanclub soon!",5.0
"Came here a few days ago with my friend after work. Very dark inside, took some time for my eyeballs to adjust lol. We started off with some beers and then went with the Hellboy which was AMAZING. The hot honey makes a difference! Then we went with a vegan pie since neither one of us was particularly full. We ordered one with spinach, sea salt and garlic on it (sorry don't remember the name!) It was OK, not that memorable. The standout is by far Hellboy, the crust for both pizzas was SUPER THIN, firm and didn't fall apart on me. We both liked it. I took off a star for the spinach pie being nothing special and that it's a bit on the pricey side. Overall, I think I'll be back to try the other pizzas on the menu!",4.0
"Maybe we came on an off night, but we didn't care too much about the pizza and it was definitely not the best we've had. My friend wanted to celebrate her belated birthday at Paulie Gee's and so we did. We ordered 3 pies (Greenpointer, Ricotta Be Kidding Me, and The Hometown Brisket). I think the Hometown Brisket was our favorite only because of the BBQ sauce. Other than that, there wasn't much brisket pieces on the pizza. Ricotta Be Kidding Me was okay. The Greenpointer was all greens so that balanced our meal a little bit. I hear people waiting for hours to get a seat here and right now I'm just wondering where all the hype went? We came when they were opening, so thank goodness we didn't wait on line for this...cause it wouldn't have been worth it. FYI: There's no sign outside that says ""Paulie Gee's"".

"I almost feel like it's blasphemy for not giving 5 stars. Finally made my way over here at Paulie Gees after way too long. Clearly this place is GPs staple so was excited to drop by on Wednesday night.There was no wait- very good. I had been worried about this so called 3x around 6:45pm to see how long it was before heading over. No one picked up and their answering service basically hangs up on you. I ordered the Daniela and he ordered the brisket pizza. Mine came out a good 7 minutes before his. I noticed immediately that about 40% of the crust was charred to the point of being inedible. To top that off, the spinach topping my pizza was the same. It was literally a black piece of ash and when I picked a leaf up or crumbled in my hands. The cheese blend was very good (mozzarella and Parmesan) but the pizza was just not good. To top it off, parts of the center were soggy and didn't hold the toppings when I grabbed a slice. When the brisket pizza came out a few minutes later I noticed immediately that it was cooked perfectly. The crust was edible and delicious. I was bummed that mine didn't come out this way especially since it seemed like a classic. All I can say is they probably put our orders in together and maybe his needed a little longer in the oven. Mine was most likely getting over cooked while his needed a few more minutes. Hence the gap in time between both of our orders coming out and the reason why mine was half done by the time his came out.I was really disappointed but the good thing to know is at least the brisket pizza was cooked well. I know there is a good meal at Paulie Gees but I feel like we were jipped.Also, great touch that Paulie himself came in to greet all the diners. He was super friendly and it brings a family quality to the place. This is maybe one of the main reasons I'd come back.",3.0
"Delicious!! Definitely made my top 3 favorite pizza  places (the others being robertas and best pizza). We've been meaning to come forever but the line is always so long.

I would highly recommend this tactic to those of you who have been meaning to come and haven't been able to due to the wait -- the food will be worth it. We ordered the hellboy, ricotta be kidding me and the hot honey ice cream Sunday for dessert. The hellboy was our fave. It was basically a pepperoni pizza with hot honey lined under the cheese.

"My husband and I visited Paulie Gee's about two years ago and he still dreams of the Hellboy. This time we ordered the Hellboy and Cherry Jones.  The Hellboy was great but just a touch too sweet for me.  The hot honey adds a little kick but is definitely not too hot.  My husband will tell you it is the best pizza he has ever had (saying a lot since he was raised in the Bronx).  The Cherry Jones on the other hand was way too sweet for both of us.  I couldn't taste anything other then honey.  My husband embarrassed me by telling the waitress we didn't like it.  She offered us a replacement.  We ordered the Ricky Ricotta.  It was alright.  I was shocked because the ricotta was not warm.  The crust at Paulie Gee's is the perfect texture.  However, two of our three pizzas were too charred for my taste.  I must mention Paulie walks around all the tables to make sure everyone is enjoying.  Love it!  The restaurant is too dark and loud for my taste.",3.0

"Absolutely delicious. Huge selection of pies - good for meatatarians, vegetarians, and even vegans. Wood fire oven delivers the signature light smoke and char. Dough is absolutely tender and springy. They even let the pizza rest afterwards so the cheese sets and you don't burn the crap out of your mouth.Hellboy- spicy pepperoni with hot honey. Absolute classic pizza. Hot honey perfectly blankets the spicy meat. Super simple, absolutely delicious. Get two, trust meRicotta/sausage pie - similar to one above, hot honey included. However ricotta and sausage are a welcome addition.

"One of the challenges of  being vegan is getting your friends/family to be open to the idea of trying vegan food.I have never had Vegan Pizza before and I usually try to try a restaurant first before recommending to anyone especially a non vegan but I took a chance.When we first arrived we were having trouble picking something since everything was foreign to us. Someone sitting next to us saw our struggle and took us to try the  IN Ricotta Da Vegan so we did. AMAZING!! My non vegan date was impressed and I was so happy.Thanks Paulie Gee for making me looking good Whew! One pie (6 small slices) goes for 16 bucks . Its small, nice ambiance I would say its a little darkI would go again!Menu like here ------ pauliegee.com/greenpoint… xoxoC.",4.0
"Some of the best za in the city, bar none. The lady and I traveled far and wide for it since we'd heard such great things. It was a Friday night so the restaurant was predictably packed. There's not much in the form of a waiting area, which particularly sucked given how freezing the weather was, but we had a feeling the pie would be well worth the wait (plus we also got to watch a tipsy couple aggressively suck face up close and personal which was an unexpected but enjoyable twist).The vibe was cool, featuring low--lighting, a huge and beautiful custom brick oven, and trendy attractive people who's favorite bands you've never heard of.When we finally were seated I was stoked to see the menu offered a huge variety of pies with all sorts of niche toppings AND vegan options(I personally don't give two damns about veganism but they presented them in an unpretentious way so I was cool with it). We eventually decided to go with the Hell Boy and the Prokypineapple, both of which were amazing, and I'm looking forward to going back and further chowing my way down the menu.Go here.",5.0
"After a 2-hours wait on a weekend for a party of 2, we finally got a table at the renowned pizza shop in Brooklyn. After having one of the best pizzas of all time at Little Isabella located in Baltimore, I was on the mission to find its companion in NYC. Overhyped as we suspected, Paulie Gee had nothing on Little Isabella! Perhaps, it was the quirky blend of sweet and savory flavors, but with that 2-hour wait, we surely did not have a pleasing experience.We ordered two pies: HellBoy and Greenpointer. HellBoy: Fresh Mozzarella, Italian Tomatoes, Berkshire Sopressata Piccante, Parmigiano Reggiano and Mike's HOT HoneyGreenpointer:Fresh Mozzarella, Baby Arugula, Olive Oil, Fresh Lemon Juice and Shaved Parmigiano ReggianoWe didn't really enjoy the sweetness of the honey in the HellBoy or the sourness of the lemon juice in the Greenpointer. Fresh, as we saw them make each pie to order, I definitely thought the doughiness of the pizza wasn't anything spectacular. In terms of service, I think it was pretty solid. Our waiter was patient and helpful. As a surprise, Paulie Gee himself introduced himself to just about every table, making it feel quite personable. In all, I definitely wouldn't return back to this pizzeria, especially with that crazy wait. During that 2-hour wait and 1.5-hour dining time, I can drive down to Baltimore and get some Little Isabella for half the price and no wait!",3.0
"3.5 stars for this pizza joint hidden behind a HUGE wooden door all the way down Franklin streetCrust was good with a nice char on the hellboy but the crust of the greenpoint pizza seemed a bit underdone We were quoted a 1.5 hour wait at 8pm for 3 on a Saturday but we were lucky that people in front of us hadn't returned so we were seated right away! (so don't be discouraged)---hellboy: everything was good about this except that spicy honey! Should of gone with a more classic margherita style pizza instead---greenpoint: fresh arugula, with a bit too much lemon juice, so nothing special NOTE: they don't have pepper flakes, only chili oil",4.0
"If you want great pizza and the right atmosphere look no further than Paulie Gee's. We sat at the bar (luckily) and avoided a two hour wait.  The pizza choices are numerous, with some very creative options. There were three of us and we started with two pies. Would have been content but it was so good we ordered a third.The texture. The crust. The toppings. Hard pressed to mention anything I didn't like. I love pizza and this place is right up there with the best. That includes many pizzerias throughout Italy.Paulie stopped by for a chat and he has a fantastic personality. Great stories and it is obvious that he loves what he does and holds him team to very high standards.He was also kind enough to give me an official Paulie Gee's pin and a limoncello. A very nice touch!Make sure you check out the pizza oven in the back. It's a small,cozy place so don't pass this place up in you are in NY.",5.0
I take my pizza very seriously. The vegan pizza is so good here that if they didn't tell you it was vegan you would have no clue. I had the pie with vegan sausage and shared a few others with friends. It was all out of this world. I can't wait to go back again.,5.0
"There's a LOT of really great pizza in NYC, that's nothing new. But combine amazing pizza with friendly, caring service and a killer ambiance, and Paulie Gee's has a leg up on a lot of the other heavy hitters. The wait can be crazy, but we came in on a Tuesday night and it was half empty. I guess the key is to come when there's post-blizzard sludge everywhere and no one else wants to go out. Paulie Gee was there as I'm told he usually is, weaving around the space with his cup of coffee and stopping at literally every table. For us, he offered to curate our pizza order and who were we to argue? Read on for what Paulie Gee himself recommends:- The Greenpointer: according to Paulie, basically like eating a salad due to the piles of fresh baby arugula on top. - The Mo Cheeks: My personal favorite of the meal. The pickled onions on there are a nice surprise, and give a nice kick to the rest of the ingredients. - The Monte Cristo: OK, so this is probably something I would never think to order myself, but I'm glad it came out for us because it's actually super tasty. It comes with Canadian bacon and a drizzle of maple syrup, which I know sounds weird but trust me (or rather, trust Paulie). - I didn't catch the name of the last pizza, but it was one of the best and after peeking at the menu again I think it might have been the Hellboy. It was piled high with the tastiest Berkshire Sopressata, and it was perfect with the side of Mike's hot honey (which you haven't tried on pizza you must immediately). They asked if we wanted a dessert pizza but at that point we were stuffed to the gills. It was one of the best New York pizza experiences I've had so far, and the service is what really puts them above and beyond. I'm going to run for vice-president of the Paulie Gee fanclub soon!",5.0
"Came here a few days ago with my friend after work. Very dark inside, took some time for my eyeballs to adjust lol. We started off with some beers and then went with the Hellboy which was AMAZING. The hot honey makes a difference! Then we went with a vegan pie since neither one of us was particularly full. We ordered one with spinach, sea salt and garlic on it (sorry don't remember the name!) It was OK, not that memorable. The standout is by far Hellboy, the crust for both pizzas was SUPER THIN, firm and didn't fall apart on me. We both liked it. I took off a star for the spinach pie being nothing special and that it's a bit on the pricey side. Overall, I think I'll be back to try the other pizzas on the menu!",4.0
"Maybe we came on an off night, but we didn't care too much about the pizza and it was definitely not the best we've had. My friend wanted to celebrate her belated birthday at Paulie Gee's and so we did. We ordered 3 pies (Greenpointer, Ricotta Be Kidding Me, and The Hometown Brisket). I think the Hometown Brisket was our favorite only because of the BBQ sauce. Other than that, there wasn't much brisket pieces on the pizza. Ricotta Be Kidding Me was okay. The Greenpointer was all greens so that balanced our meal a little bit. I hear people waiting for hours to get a seat here and right now I'm just wondering where all the hype went? We came when they were opening, so thank goodness we didn't wait on line for this...cause it wouldn't have been worth it. FYI: There's no sign outside that says ""Paulie Gee's"". You just have to look by the address number ""60"" in order to find this place. I actually walked passed it while we were trying to find it. Also, use your flash on your phones to read the menu. I really liked the rustic interior but it was literally pitch black in there.",3.0
"Zagat rated the hellboy as the best pizza in NYC. Wow! Big call Zagat... We had to try! We would say it was delicious... But I would have to say Marta is equal of not just ahead. We got here at 6:40 and had to wait over an hr to sit at the bar. When getting here service was prompt and food was great! We ordered the hellboy and the hellified porkpie white and I have to say it was fresh, full of flavor and great value. My only critique would be more hot suppressa on the hellified and take numbers at the door! It's a little unreasonable to ask people to wait 90 mins and not offer to call when table it ready. Either way it was great but probably won't be crossing the river to wait another 90 mins.",4.0
"If there was ever a restaurant that inspires the need for #PiDay (3.14) to be everyday, it is Paulie Gee's. The pizza is a true art, and every bite is important, from the center to the crust crust.  PG is located in pizza heaven, or right near the water on Greenpoint Ave if you want a Google Map friendly address.Read it on my blog: highclasstohighlifes.com…As you'll see below I'm constantly on the proscuitt of happiness but this time we went for a different ham, Canadian bacon, and on the Monte Cristo. You bet it counted towards happiness. This pizza combines maple syrup drizzle and gouda with the ham. Yes, yes and more yes. Paulie asked if we had butter on the crust...sadly, no. SO MUCH REGRET....that I'll be back in no time to try it. You'll notice on the menu that they have a brisket pizza that features Hometown BBQ -- I love this local BK collaboration. You can get sauced the other way too with Greenpoint local brews!Anyway, I have nearly eaten my way through the entire menu (still need to do a bit of adventuring on the vegan side, every time I get close, I just want meat...) and I have been very pleased with every slice thus far. Therefore my advice to you is go with the pizza that's toppings are most appealing...or grab a handful of friends and share, then you can try multiple pizzas!The man, who is not a myth, but definitely a legend is often found inside checking in on tables, ensuring quality control and getting to know the patrons. He loved my last Instagram post that did a little play words...sharing that I was on the prosciutt of happiness with his King Henry Classic. He's always all smiles and usually wearing a great hat, he is Paulie Gee himself. Paulie Gee's - High Class to High Lifes If you really knead to get delivery or pickup, you'll have to look elsewhere for now though. The only way to leave Paulie Gee's with a to-go box is with leftovers. Rumor has it that a slice joint is opening up nearby though! I'm counting down the days, hours and minutes. Want to keep drooling? Read the menu!Pro Tip: Grab dinner at Paulie Gee's then walk straight out on the water in Greenpoint to Transmitter park or the outlook. Maybe even catch a sunset and BYO night cap!",5.0
"My old pal Carlos and I visited Paulie Gee's last night and had a great meal. I'm accustomed to going with the ol' vegan girlfriend and have a tradition where we split two pies from their extensive vegan selection, so we can try two different types of pies. The vegan and non-vegan selections are both extensive; each category has at least a half dozen kinds of pies, including oil bases, white slices, marinara, spinach-based, spicy honey and barbecue sauce foundations. The pies are aesthetically pleasing to every sense, well, every sense except sound. It's usually better when sound isn't a factor. At least when you're talking about food. When you're talking about music, sound is obviously a very important sense to talk about. I may go as far as to say that in a conversation about music, sound is the only sense that matters.I was excited to go with Carlos because I was going to get to eat their meat and actual cheese. The Paulie Gee's brisket is lean and delicious. Their pickled red onions possess a truly memorable tang and are worth spending a couple buck to add on to pretty much any pie. The ricotta dollops on the Ricky Ricotta feel more like bursts of a cream sauce than regular old cheese. Interestingly, the dairy and non-dairy ricotta cheeses are almost indecipherable in quality, which goes to show that Paulie Gee's knows what's up. Carlos and I were pleased to compliment the trad Italian flavors of the Ricky Ricotta with a tangy Barbecue Brisket pie. I'm psyched to go with a fellow omnivore again, because there are tons of other flavor combos I'm eager to try. New Yorkers, such as myself, are notorious for being dicks about the quality of pizza dough. It's the dough that invalidates the Chicago Deep Dish's false aspiration to pizza status. I can't stand Sicilian pizza either, which is a controversial take in Nueva York. Anyhow, no matter how well adorned a Paulie Gee's pie is, its base--the crust--is its most distinct and wonderful element. The crust is thin but springy, and always a little charred. It's pretty much naan bread, which is either a very luck coincidence or a visionary innovation. Naan bread, as you know, is lit, and, as it turns out, it is the perfect surface upon which various pizza ingredients should be placed and/or spread to mingle harmoniously.I've visited Paulie Gee's a number of times, and there's a bit of narrative that forms around my visits. The first time I tried to go, it was around noon, and my gf and I made the unpleasant discovery that Paulie Gee's does not open til 5 PM. The next time, we rolled up in a deep crew of six and had to wait about two to three hours for a table for six. If you find yourself in that position, you'll be okay though because there are plenty of bars around. There's also the water/skyline, mere yards away and a nice record store a block away.The gf and I have gone a few other times and it's always been great--except for the one time that a camera crew was shooting a special on Paulie Gee's vegan options. My girlfriend and I were in the shot all throughout our meal, and we were fighting (as subtly as possible) for the duration of our meal. I was taken aback and somewhat miffed when the producers of the show asked to do a talking head with us outside. The tension was palpable but they still insisted on interviewing us. I really do believe that you should foot the bill if you're going to interview someone for your television series or web series or gratuitously long Yelp review or whatever. At LEAST commission me to write a song for the soundtrack.In closing, I would like to offer a lil sum sum for the ladies. Are you interested in grandfatherly, charmingly blue collar, short men whose personalities closely resemble those of most Robert De Niro characters--but only in David O. Russel movies? If you do, and might want to be possibly hit on by a man of this caliber, you will love Paulie Gee's. At all times, Paulie Gee's eponymous Pizza Architect and Entrepreneur, Paulie Gee, stalks the narrow spaces between tables, checking in with customers--particularly of the reasonably attractive female demographic--and asks them how their food is, making small talk and thanking them for their patronage. I think this is cool. I would do the same if I were in his position, so don't take this the wrong way. Central to Paulie Gee's game is his ability to recommend a pizza place in seemingly every zip code on the planet and his inclination to tell you (the lady in question) the name of the dude who works there/owns the place, and to tell you (still the lady in question) to tell the dude (who owns the pizza place) to say that he (Paulie Gee) says hi.

"Some of the best za in the city, bar none. The lady and I traveled far and wide for it since we'd heard such great things. It was a Friday night so the restaurant was predictably packed. There's not much in the form of a waiting area, which particularly sucked given how freezing the weather was, but we had a feeling the pie would be well worth the wait (plus we also got to watch a tipsy couple aggressively suck face up close and personal which was an unexpected but enjoyable twist).The vibe was cool, featuring low--lighting, a huge and beautiful custom brick oven, and trendy attractive people who's favorite bands you've never heard of.When we finally were seated I was stoked to see the menu offered a huge variety of pies with all sorts of niche toppings AND vegan options(I personally don't give two damns about veganism but they presented them in an unpretentious way so I was cool with it).

"After a 2-hours wait on a weekend for a party of 2, we finally got a table at the renowned pizza shop in Brooklyn. After having one of the best pizzas of all time at Little Isabella located in Baltimore, I was on the mission to find its companion in NYC. Overhyped as we suspected, Paulie Gee had nothing on Little Isabella! Perhaps, it was the quirky blend of sweet and savory flavors, but with that 2-hour wait, we surely did not have a pleasing experience.We ordered two pies: HellBoy and Greenpointer. HellBoy: Fresh Mozzarella, Italian Tomatoes, Berkshire Sopressata Piccante, Parmigiano Reggiano and Mike's HOT HoneyGreenpointer:Fresh Mozzarella, Baby Arugula, Olive Oil, Fresh Lemon Juice and Shaved Parmigiano ReggianoWe didn't really enjoy the sweetness of the honey in the HellBoy or the sourness of the lemon juice in the Greenpointer. Fresh, as we saw them make each pie to order, I definitely thought the doughiness of the pizza wasn't anything spectacular. In terms of service, I think it was pretty solid. Our waiter was patient and helpful. As a surprise, Paulie Gee himself introduced himself to just about every table, making it feel quite personable. In all, I definitely wouldn't return back to this pizzeria, especially with that crazy wait. During that 2-hour wait and 1.5-hour dining time, I can drive down to Baltimore and get some Little Isabella for half the price and no wait!",3.0

I take my pizza very seriously. The vegan pizza is so good here that if they didn't tell you it was vegan you would have no clue. I had the pie with vegan sausage and shared a few others with friends. It was all out of this world. I can't wait to go back again.,5.0
"There's a LOT of really great pizza in NYC, that's nothing new. But combine amazing pizza with friendly, caring service and a killer ambiance, and Paulie Gee's has a leg up on a lot of the other heavy hitters. The wait can be crazy, but we came in on a Tuesday night and it was half empty. I guess the key is to come when there's post-blizzard sludge everywhere and no one else wants to go out. Paulie Gee was there as I'm told he usually is, weaving around the space with his cup of coffee and stopping at literally every table. For us, he offered to curate our pizza order and who were we to argue? Read on for what Paulie Gee himself recommends:- The Greenpointer: according to Paulie, basically like eating a salad due to the piles of fresh baby arugula on top. - The Mo Cheeks: My personal favorite of the meal. The pickled onions on there are a nice surprise, and give a nice kick to the rest of the ingredients. - The Monte Cristo: OK, so this is probably something I would never think to order myself, but I'm glad it came out for us because it's actually super tasty. It comes with Canadian bacon and a drizzle of maple syrup, which I know sounds weird but trust me (or rather, trust Paulie). - I didn't catch the name of the last pizza, but it was one of the best and after peeking at the menu again I think it might have been the Hellboy. It was piled high with the tastiest Berkshire Sopressata, and it was perfect with the side of Mike's hot honey (which you haven't tried on pizza you must immediately). They asked if we wanted a dessert pizza but at that point we were stuffed to the gills. It was one of the best New York pizza experiences I've had so far, and the service is what really puts them above and beyond. I'm going to run for vice-president of the Paulie Gee fanclub soon!",5.0
"Came here a few days ago with my friend after work. Very dark inside, took some time for my eyeballs to adjust lol. We started off with some beers and then went with the Hellboy which was AMAZING. The hot honey makes a difference! Then we went with a vegan pie since neither one of us was particularly full. We ordered one with spinach, sea salt and garlic on it (sorry don't remember the name!) It was OK, not that memorable. The standout is by far Hellboy, the crust for both pizzas was SUPER THIN, firm and didn't fall apart on me. We both liked it. I took off a star for the spinach pie being nothing special and that it's a bit on the pricey side. Overall, I think I'll be back to try the other pizzas on the menu!",4.0
"Maybe we came on an off night, but we didn't care too much about the pizza and it was definitely not the best we've had. My friend wanted to celebrate her belated birthday at Paulie Gee's and so we did. We ordered 3 pies (Greenpointer, Ricotta Be Kidding Me, and The Hometown Brisket). I think the Hometown Brisket was our favorite only because of the BBQ sauce. Other than that, there wasn't much brisket pieces on the pizza. Ricotta Be Kidding Me was okay. The Greenpointer was all greens so that balanced our meal a little bit. I hear people waiting for hours to get a seat here and right now I'm just wondering where all the hype went? We came when they were opening, so thank goodness we didn't wait on line for this...cause it wouldn't have been worth it. FYI: There's no sign outside that says ""Paulie Gee's"". You just have to look by the address number ""60"" in order to find this place. I actually walked passed it while we were trying to find it. Also, use your flash on your phones to read the menu. I really liked the rustic interior but it was literally pitch black in there.",3.0
"Zagat rated the hellboy as the best pizza in NYC. Wow! Big call Zagat... We had to try! We would say it was delicious... But I would have to say Marta is equal of not just ahead. We got here at 6:40 and had to wait over an hr to sit at the bar. When getting here service was prompt and food was great! We ordered the hellboy and the hellified porkpie white and I have to say it was fresh, full of flavor and great value. My only critique would be more hot suppressa on the hellified and take numbers at the door! It's a little unreasonable to ask people to wait 90 mins and not offer to call when table it ready. Either way it was great but probably won't be crossing the river to wait another 90 mins.",4.0
"If there was ever a restaurant that inspires the need for #PiDay (3.14) to be everyday, it is Paulie Gee's. The pizza is a true art, and every bite is important, from the center to the crust crust.  PG is located in pizza heaven, or right near the water on Greenpoint Ave if you want a Google Map friendly address.Read it on my blog: highclasstohighlifes.com…As you'll see below I'm constantly on the proscuitt of happiness but this time we went for a different ham, Canadian bacon, and on the Monte Cristo. You bet it counted towards happiness. This pizza combines maple syrup drizzle and gouda with the ham. Yes, yes and more yes. Paulie asked if we had butter on the crust...sadly, no. SO MUCH REGRET....that I'll be back in no time to try it. You'll notice on the menu that they have a brisket pizza that features Hometown BBQ -- I love this local BK collaboration. You can get sauced the other way too with Greenpoint local brews!Anyway, I have nearly eaten my way through the entire menu (still need to do a bit of adventuring on the vegan side, every time I get close, I just want meat...) and I have been very pleased with every slice thus far. Therefore my advice to you is go with the pizza that's toppings are most appealing...or grab a handful of friends and share, then you can try multiple pizzas!The man, who is not a myth, but definitely a legend is often found inside checking in on tables, ensuring quality control and getting to know the patrons. He loved my last Instagram post that did a little play words...sharing that I was on the prosciutt of happiness with his King Henry Classic. He's always all smiles and usually wearing a great hat, he is Paulie Gee himself. Paulie Gee's - High Class to High Lifes If you really knead to get delivery or pickup, you'll have to look elsewhere for now though. The only way to leave Paulie Gee's with a to-go box is with leftovers. Rumor has it that a slice joint is opening up nearby though! I'm counting down the days, hours and minutes. Want to keep drooling? Read the menu!Pro Tip: Grab dinner at Paulie Gee's then walk straight out on the water in Greenpoint to Transmitter park or the outlook. Maybe even catch a sunset and BYO night cap!",5.0
"My old pal Carlos and I visited Paulie Gee's last night and had a great meal. I'm accustomed to going with the ol' vegan girlfriend and have a tradition where we split two pies from their extensive vegan selection, so we can try two different types of pies. The vegan and non-vegan selections are both extensive; each category has at least a half dozen kinds of pies, including oil bases, white slices, marinara, spinach-based, spicy honey and barbecue sauce foundations. The pies are aesthetically pleasing to every sense, well, every sense except sound. It's usually better when sound isn't a factor. At least when you're talking about food. When you're talking about music, sound is obviously a very important sense to talk about. I may go as far as to say that in a conversation about music, sound is the only sense that matters.I was excited to go with Carlos because I was going to get to eat their meat and actual cheese. The Paulie Gee's brisket is lean and delicious. Their pickled red onions possess a truly memorable tang and are worth spending a couple buck to add on to pretty much any pie. The ricotta dollops on the Ricky Ricotta feel more like bursts of a cream sauce than regular old cheese. Interestingly, the dairy and non-dairy ricotta cheeses are almost indecipherable in quality, which goes to show that Paulie Gee's knows what's up. Carlos and I were pleased to compliment the trad Italian flavors of the Ricky Ricotta with a tangy Barbecue Brisket pie. I'm psyched to go with a fellow omnivore again, because there are tons of other flavor combos I'm eager to try. New Yorkers, such as myself, are notorious for being dicks about the quality of pizza dough. It's the dough that invalidates the Chicago Deep Dish's false aspiration to pizza status. I can't stand Sicilian pizza either, which is a controversial take in Nueva York. Anyhow, no matter how well adorned a Paulie Gee's pie is, its base--the crust--is its most distinct and wonderful element. The crust is thin but springy, and always a little charred. It's pretty much naan bread, which is either a very luck coincidence or a visionary innovation. Naan bread, as you know, is lit, and, as it turns out, it is the perfect surface upon which various pizza ingredients should be placed and/or spread to mingle harmoniously.I've visited Paulie Gee's a number of times, and there's a bit of narrative that forms around my visits. The first time I tried to go, it was around noon, and my gf and I made the unpleasant discovery that Paulie Gee's does not open til 5 PM. The next time, we rolled up in a deep crew of six and had to wait about two to three hours for a table for six. If you find yourself in that position, you'll be okay though because there are plenty of bars around. There's also the water/skyline, mere yards away and a nice record store a block away.The gf and I have gone a few other times and it's always been great--except for the one time that a camera crew was shooting a special on Paulie Gee's vegan options. My girlfriend and I were in the shot all throughout our meal, and we were fighting (as subtly as possible) for the duration of our meal. I was taken aback and somewhat miffed when the producers of the show asked to do a talking head with us outside. The tension was palpable but they still insisted on interviewing us. I really do believe that you should foot the bill if you're going to interview someone for your television series or web series or gratuitously long Yelp review or whatever. At LEAST commission me to write a song for the soundtrack.In closing, I would like to offer a lil sum sum for the ladies. Are you interested in grandfatherly, charmingly blue collar, short men whose personalities closely resemble those of most Robert De Niro characters--but only in David O. Russel movies? If you do, and might want to be possibly hit on by a man of this caliber, you will love Paulie Gee's. At all times, Paulie Gee's eponymous Pizza Architect and Entrepreneur, Paulie Gee, stalks the narrow spaces between tables, checking in with customers--particularly of the reasonably attractive female demographic--and asks them how their food is, making small talk and thanking them for their patronage. I think this is cool. I would do the same if I were in his position, so don't take this the wrong way. Central to Paulie Gee's game is his ability to recommend a pizza place in seemingly every zip code on the planet and his inclination to tell you (the lady in question) the name of the dude who works there/owns the place, and to tell you (still the lady in question) to tell the dude (who owns the pizza place) to say that he (Paulie Gee) says hi. The Brotherhood of Pizza Mans is truly alive and well.",5.0

"I almost feel like it's blasphemy for not giving 5 stars. Finally made my way over here at Paulie Gees after way too long. Clearly this place is GPs staple so was excited to drop by on Wednesday night.There was no wait- very good. I had been worried about this so called 3x around 6:45pm to see how long it was before heading over. No one picked up and their answering service basically hangs up on you. I ordered the Daniela and he ordered the brisket pizza. Mine came out a good 7 minutes before his. I noticed immediately that about 40% of the crust was charred to the point of being inedible. To top that off, the spinach topping my pizza was the same. It was literally a black piece of ash and when I picked a leaf up or crumbled in my hands. The cheese blend was very good (mozzarella and Parmesan) but the pizza was just not good. To top it off, parts of the center were soggy and didn't hold the toppings when I grabbed a slice. When the brisket pizza came out a few minutes later I noticed immediately that it was cooked perfectly. The crust was edible and delicious. I was bummed that mine didn't come out this way especially since it seemed like a classic. All I can say is they probably put our orders in together and maybe his needed a little longer in the oven. Mine was most likely getting over cooked while his needed a few more minutes. Hence the gap in time between both of our orders coming out and the reason why mine was half done by the time his came out.I was really disappointed but the good thing to know is at least the brisket pizza was cooked well. I know there is a good meal at Paulie Gees but I feel like we were jipped.Also, great touch that Paulie himself came in to greet all the diners. He was super friendly and it brings a family quality to the place. This is maybe one of the main reasons I'd come back.",3.0
"Delicious!! Definitely made my top 3 favorite pizza  places (the others being robertas and best pizza). We've been meaning to come forever but the line is always so long. We were finally seated right away on a Friday night because we ran over as soon as they opened at 6pm. I would highly recommend this tactic to those of you who have been meaning to come and haven't been able to due to the wait -- the food will be worth it. We ordered the hellboy, ricotta be kidding me and the hot honey ice cream Sunday for dessert. The hellboy was our fave. It was basically a pepperoni pizza with hot honey lined under the cheese. I liked it more than the bees sting from Robertas but both are very good. All in all would highly recommend. As an extra plus Paulie Gee was hanging around today,though it seems like he does this quite often, going from table to table talking to the customers.",5.0
"My husband and I visited Paulie Gee's about two years ago and he still dreams of the Hellboy. This time we ordered the Hellboy and Cherry Jones.  The Hellboy was great but just a touch too sweet for me.  The hot honey adds a little kick but is definitely not too hot.  My husband will tell you it is the best pizza he has ever had (saying a lot since he was raised in the Bronx).  The Cherry Jones on the other hand was way too sweet for both of us.  I couldn't taste anything other then honey.  My husband embarrassed me by telling the waitress we didn't like it.  She offered us a replacement.  We ordered the Ricky Ricotta.  It was alright.  I was shocked because the ricotta was not warm.  The crust at Paulie Gee's is the perfect texture.  However, two of our three pizzas were too charred for my taste.  I must mention Paulie walks around all the tables to make sure everyone is enjoying.  Love it!  The restaurant is too dark and loud for my taste.",3.0
"Interesting decor, super dark inside and it was hard to read the menu. We were seated under one of the speakers, so I felt like an old person complaining about how loud the music was, but really, we came for the food. Split a salad and a Greenpointer pie, and neither disappointed. Both were served quickly, and the pie just exploded with flavor. The lemon kick was strong but not overwhelming, and the crust was perfection. Service was attentive, friendly, and efficient. Lots of menu choices for anything your palate is craving. Overall, a very good experience, and one I would look forward to enjoying again.",4.0
"New York probably takes its pizza more seriously than anywhere else in the world.  I'm sure there are 7 or 8 people reading this right now that would be willing to shiv a guy for saying something bad about their favorite slice.  With that in mind, Paulie Gee's is a pizza lover's pizza place.  They make Neapolitan style pizzas with an oven shipped in from Naples and lovingly reassembled by small, Italian elves.  From this oven, comes perfectly leopard-spotted pizzas with just the right amount of bouncy chewy dough.To top the pizza, there's a lovingly curated selection to choose from so don't you dare ask for substitutions.  Lucky for you whether you're a vegan, vegetarian, white/red pie lover, averse to spice, meat lover, or whatever!  There's at least one pie on the menu* that will make you say, ""hmmm..."".  My personal favorites are the Mo' Cheeks ($16, has guanciale and is perfect with the pickled onions) and Ricotta Be Kidding Me ($17, with tons of meat topped with adorable dollops of cottage cheese).  I've only ever had 1 pizza there that wasn't stellar and I won't tell you which one because you'll definitely judge me for choosing it in the first place.The atmosphere at Paulie Gee's is great.  It's quintessential Brooklyn.  Think dark unfinished wood walls with an eclectic collection of tables made from reclaimed wood, music consisting of a mixture of jazz, rock, and anything but top 40s.  What always makes my night is that the ACTUAL Paulie Gee walks around and talks to EVERYONE.  It doesn't matter if Keri Russell** is sitting right next to you, he will still come by and have a 5-20 minute conversation with you and your table.  My only complaint is how popular this place is.  They've stopped making pizzas to go and still, the wait is crazy.  I've never been able to get a table in less than 45 minutes unless it was late at night.  I guess that's not a bad problem to have.  I also kind of wish they would get a full liquor license and take that creative pizza combo creating mind into the cocktail realm.  I mean...Mike's Hot Honey + Whiskey?  Maybe?---------* If you can't find a pizza you like on the printed menu in the restaurant, whip out the smartphone and check out the ""secret"" menu on the website.** This actually happened.",4.0

It was piled high with the tastiest Berkshire Sopressata, and it was perfect with the side of Mike's hot honey (which you haven't tried on pizza you must immediately). They asked if we wanted a dessert pizza but at that point we were stuffed to the gills. It was one of the best New York pizza experiences I've had so far, and the service is what really puts them above and beyond. I'm going to run for vice-president of the Paulie Gee fanclub soon!",5.0
"Came here a few days ago with my friend after work. Very dark inside, took some time for my eyeballs to adjust lol. We started off with some beers and then went with the Hellboy which was AMAZING. The hot honey makes a difference! Then we went with a vegan pie since neither one of us was particularly full. We ordered one with spinach, sea salt and garlic on it (sorry don't remember the name!) It was OK, not that memorable. The standout is by far Hellboy, the crust for both pizzas was SUPER THIN, firm and didn't fall apart on me. We both liked it.

"Maybe we came on an off night, but we didn't care too much about the pizza and it was definitely not the best we've had. My friend wanted to celebrate her belated birthday at Paulie Gee's and so we did. We ordered 3 pies (Greenpointer, Ricotta Be Kidding Me, and The Hometown Brisket). I think the Hometown Brisket was our favorite only because of the BBQ sauce. Other than that, there wasn't much brisket pieces on the pizza. Ricotta Be Kidding Me was okay. The Greenpointer was all greens so that balanced our meal a little bit. I hear people waiting for hours to get a seat here and right now I'm just wondering where all the hype went? We came when they were opening, so thank goodness we didn't wait on line for this...cause it wouldn't have been worth it. FYI: There's no sign outside that says ""Paulie Gee's"".

"My old pal Carlos and I visited Paulie Gee's last night and had a great meal. I'm accustomed to going with the ol' vegan girlfriend and have a tradition where we split two pies from their extensive vegan selection, so we can try two different types of pies. The vegan and non-vegan selections are both extensive; each category has at least a half dozen kinds of pies, including oil bases, white slices, marinara, spinach-based, spicy honey and barbecue sauce foundations. The pies are aesthetically pleasing to every sense, well, every sense except sound. It's usually better when sound isn't a factor. At least when you're talking about food. When you're talking about music, sound is obviously a very important sense to talk about. I may go as far as to say that in a conversation about music, sound is the only sense that matters.I was excited to go with Carlos because I was going to get to eat their meat and actual cheese. The Paulie Gee's brisket is lean and delicious. Their pickled red onions possess a truly memorable tang and are worth spending a couple buck to add on to pretty much any pie. The ricotta dollops on the Ricky Ricotta feel more like bursts of a cream sauce than regular old cheese. Interestingly, the dairy and non-dairy ricotta cheeses are almost indecipherable in quality, which goes to show that Paulie Gee's knows what's up. Carlos and I were pleased to compliment the trad Italian flavors of the Ricky Ricotta with a tangy Barbecue Brisket pie. I'm psyched to go with a fellow omnivore again, because there are tons of other flavor combos I'm eager to try. New Yorkers, such as myself, are notorious for being dicks about the quality of pizza dough. It's the dough that invalidates the Chicago Deep Dish's false aspiration to pizza status. I can't stand Sicilian pizza either, which is a controversial take in Nueva York. Anyhow, no matter how well adorned a Paulie Gee's pie is, its base--the crust--is its most distinct and wonderful element. The crust is thin but springy, and always a little charred. It's pretty much naan bread, which is either a very luck coincidence or a visionary innovation. Naan bread, as you know, is lit, and, as it turns out, it is the perfect surface upon which various pizza ingredients should be placed and/or spread to mingle harmoniously.I've visited Paulie Gee's a number of times, and there's a bit of narrative that forms around my visits. The first time I tried to go, it was around noon, and my gf and I made the unpleasant discovery that Paulie Gee's does not open til 5 PM. The next time, we rolled up in a deep crew of six and had to wait about two to three hours for a table for six. If you find yourself in that position, you'll be okay though because there are plenty of bars around. There's also the water/skyline, mere yards away and a nice record store a block away.The gf and I have gone a few other times and it's always been great--except for the one time that a camera crew was shooting a special on Paulie Gee's vegan options. My girlfriend and I were in the shot all throughout our meal, and we were fighting (as subtly as possible) for the duration of our meal. I was taken aback and somewhat miffed when the producers of the show asked to do a talking head with us outside. The tension was palpable but they still insisted on interviewing us. I really do believe that you should foot the bill if you're going to interview someone for your television series or web series or gratuitously long Yelp review or whatever. At LEAST commission me to write a song for the soundtrack.In closing, I would like to offer a lil sum sum for the ladies. Are you interested in grandfatherly, charmingly blue collar, short men whose personalities closely resemble those of most Robert De Niro characters--but only in David O. Russel movies? If you do, and might want to be possibly hit on by a man of this caliber, you will love Paulie Gee's. At all times, Paulie Gee's eponymous Pizza Architect and Entrepreneur, Paulie Gee, stalks the narrow spaces between tables, checking in with customers--particularly of the reasonably attractive female demographic--and asks them how their food is, making small talk and thanking them for their patronage. I think this is cool. I would do the same if I were in his position, so don't take this the wrong way. Central to Paulie Gee's game is his ability to recommend a pizza place in seemingly every zip code on the planet and his inclination to tell you (the lady in question) the name of the dude who works there/owns the place, and to tell you (still the lady in question) to tell the dude (who owns the pizza place) to say that he (Paulie Gee) says hi. The Brotherhood of Pizza Mans is truly alive and well.",5.0

"I almost feel like it's blasphemy for not giving 5 stars. Finally made my way over here at Paulie Gees after way too long. Clearly this place is GPs staple so was excited to drop by on Wednesday night.There was no wait- very good. I had been worried about this so called 3x around 6:45pm to see how long it was before heading over. No one picked up and their answering service basically hangs up on you. I ordered the Daniela and he ordered the brisket pizza. Mine came out a good 7 minutes before his. I noticed immediately that about 40% of the crust was charred to the point of being inedible. To top that off, the spinach topping my pizza was the same. It was literally a black piece of ash and when I picked a leaf up or crumbled in my hands. The cheese blend was very good (mozzarella and Parmesan) but the pizza was just not good. To top it off, parts of the center were soggy and didn't hold the toppings when I grabbed a slice. When the brisket pizza came out a few minutes later I noticed immediately that it was cooked perfectly. The crust was edible and delicious. I was bummed that mine didn't come out this way especially since it seemed like a classic. All I can say is they probably put our orders in together and maybe his needed a little longer in the oven. Mine was most likely getting over cooked while his needed a few more minutes. Hence the gap in time between both of our orders coming out and the reason why mine was half done by the time his came out.I was really disappointed but the good thing to know is at least the brisket pizza was cooked well. I know there is a good meal at Paulie Gees but I feel like we were jipped.Also, great touch that Paulie himself came in to greet all the diners. He was super friendly and it brings a family quality to the place. This is maybe one of the main reasons I'd come back.",3.0
"Delicious!! Definitely made my top 3 favorite pizza  places (the others being robertas and best pizza). We've been meaning to come forever but the line is always so long. We were finally seated right away on a Friday night because we ran over as soon as they opened at 6pm. I would highly recommend this tactic to those of you who have been meaning to come and haven't been able to due to the wait -- the food will be worth it. We ordered the hellboy, ricotta be kidding me and the hot honey ice cream Sunday for dessert. The hellboy was our fave. It was basically a pepperoni pizza with hot honey lined under the cheese. I liked it more than the bees sting from Robertas but both are very good. All in all would highly recommend. As an extra plus Paulie Gee was hanging around today,though it seems like he does this quite often, going from table to table talking to the customers.",5.0
"My husband and I visited Paulie Gee's about two years ago and he still dreams of the Hellboy. This time we ordered the Hellboy and Cherry Jones.  The Hellboy was great but just a touch too sweet for me.  The hot honey adds a little kick but is definitely not too hot.  My husband will tell you it is the best pizza he has ever had (saying a lot since he was raised in the Bronx).  The Cherry Jones on the other hand was way too sweet for both of us.  I couldn't taste anything other then honey.  My husband embarrassed me by telling the waitress we didn't like it.  She offered us a replacement.  We ordered the Ricky Ricotta.  It was alright.  I was shocked because the ricotta was not warm.  The crust at Paulie Gee's is the perfect texture.  However, two of our three pizzas were too charred for my taste.  I must mention Paulie walks around all the tables to make sure everyone is enjoying.  Love it!  The restaurant is too dark and loud for my taste.",3.0
"Interesting decor, super dark inside and it was hard to read the menu. We were seated under one of the speakers, so I felt like an old person complaining about how loud the music was, but really, we came for the food. Split a salad and a Greenpointer pie, and neither disappointed. Both were served quickly, and the pie just exploded with flavor. The lemon kick was strong but not overwhelming, and the crust was perfection. Service was attentive, friendly, and efficient. Lots of menu choices for anything your palate is craving. Overall, a very good experience, and one I would look forward to enjoying again.",4.0
"New York probably takes its pizza more seriously than anywhere else in the world.  I'm sure there are 7 or 8 people reading this right now that would be willing to shiv a guy for saying something bad about their favorite slice.  With that in mind, Paulie Gee's is a pizza lover's pizza place.  They make Neapolitan style pizzas with an oven shipped in from Naples and lovingly reassembled by small, Italian elves.  From this oven, comes perfectly leopard-spotted pizzas with just the right amount of bouncy chewy dough.To top the pizza, there's a lovingly curated selection to choose from so don't you dare ask for substitutions.  Lucky for you whether you're a vegan, vegetarian, white/red pie lover, averse to spice, meat lover, or whatever!  There's at least one pie on the menu* that will make you say, ""hmmm..."".  My personal favorites are the Mo' Cheeks ($16, has guanciale and is perfect with the pickled onions) and Ricotta Be Kidding Me ($17, with tons of meat topped with adorable dollops of cottage cheese).  I've only ever had 1 pizza there that wasn't stellar and I won't tell you which one because you'll definitely judge me for choosing it in the first place.The atmosphere at Paulie Gee's is great.  It's quintessential Brooklyn.  Think dark unfinished wood walls with an eclectic collection of tables made from reclaimed wood, music consisting of a mixture of jazz, rock, and anything but top 40s.  What always makes my night is that the ACTUAL Paulie Gee walks around and talks to EVERYONE.  It doesn't matter if Keri Russell** is sitting right next to you, he will still come by and have a 5-20 minute conversation with you and your table.  My only complaint is how popular this place is.  They've stopped making pizzas to go and still, the wait is crazy.  I've never been able to get a table in less than 45 minutes unless it was late at night.  I guess that's not a bad problem to have.  I also kind of wish they would get a full liquor license and take that creative pizza combo creating mind into the cocktail realm.  I mean...Mike's Hot Honey + Whiskey?  Maybe?---------* If you can't find a pizza you like on the printed menu in the restaurant, whip out the smartphone and check out the ""secret"" menu on the website.** This actually happened.",4.0
"We've literally flown across the country to enjoy his pizza. It's that good! Walking in, the aroma of pizza cooking in a brick oven hits your nose.This is about time my stomach starts to growl. The vibe is flowing with positive energy, and the low lighting is flattering & sexy. The bar to the left is where you can order a beverage while you wait.  They have a decent beer selection. Wait times vary, but it's usually not as long as anticipated, and well worth the effort.Everyone, including the servers, seem happy to be there.Paulie Gee is the utmost host. He's always found time to come to our table with suggestions, stories, and the occasional limoncello, (his recipe of the celebratory cocktail).Talking with him, I've gathered that he makes the vegan pizza for the people, or demand for it, but he didn't seem interested in the cause. The funky bathrooms can be a challenge to use when you've had one too many! VEGAN Pies we LOVE Simply RedVegan Tomato Sauce with Tomatoes, Olive Oil.

"Absolutely delicious. Huge selection of pies - good for meatatarians, vegetarians, and even vegans. Wood fire oven delivers the signature light smoke and char. Dough is absolutely tender and springy. They even let the pizza rest afterwards so the cheese sets and you don't burn the crap out of your mouth.Hellboy- spicy pepperoni with hot honey. Absolute classic pizza. Hot honey perfectly blankets the spicy meat. Super simple, absolutely delicious. Get two, trust meRicotta/sausage pie - similar to one above, hot honey included. However ricotta and sausage are a welcome addition.

"One of the challenges of  being vegan is getting your friends/family to be open to the idea of trying vegan food.I have never had Vegan Pizza before and I usually try to try a restaurant first before recommending to anyone especially a non vegan but I took a chance.When we first arrived we were having trouble picking something since everything was foreign to us. Someone sitting next to us saw our struggle and took us to try the  IN Ricotta Da Vegan so we did. AMAZING!! My non vegan date was impressed and I was so happy.Thanks Paulie Gee for making me looking good Whew! One pie (6 small slices) goes for 16 bucks . Its small, nice ambiance I would say its a little darkI would go again!Menu like here ------ pauliegee.com/greenpoint… xoxoC.",4.0
"Some of the best za in the city, bar none. The lady and I traveled far and wide for it since we'd heard such great things. It was a Friday night so the restaurant was predictably packed. There's not much in the form of a waiting area, which particularly sucked given how freezing the weather was, but we had a feeling the pie would be well worth the wait (plus we also got to watch a tipsy couple aggressively suck face up close and personal which was an unexpected but enjoyable twist).The vibe was cool, featuring low--lighting, a huge and beautiful custom brick oven, and trendy attractive people who's favorite bands you've never heard of.When we finally were seated I was stoked to see the menu offered a huge variety of pies with all sorts of niche toppings AND vegan options(I personally don't give two damns about veganism but they presented them in an unpretentious way so I was cool with it). We eventually decided to go with the Hell Boy and the Prokypineapple, both of which were amazing, and I'm looking forward to going back and further chowing my way down the menu.Go here.",5.0
"After a 2-hours wait on a weekend for a party of 2, we finally got a table at the renowned pizza shop in Brooklyn. After having one of the best pizzas of all time at Little Isabella located in Baltimore, I was on the mission to find its companion in NYC. Overhyped as we suspected, Paulie Gee had nothing on Little Isabella! Perhaps, it was the quirky blend of sweet and savory flavors, but with that 2-hour wait, we surely did not have a pleasing experience.We ordered two pies: HellBoy and Greenpointer. HellBoy: Fresh Mozzarella, Italian Tomatoes, Berkshire Sopressata Piccante, Parmigiano Reggiano and Mike's HOT HoneyGreenpointer:Fresh Mozzarella, Baby Arugula, Olive Oil, Fresh Lemon Juice and Shaved Parmigiano ReggianoWe didn't really enjoy the sweetness of the honey in the HellBoy or the sourness of the lemon juice in the Greenpointer. Fresh, as we saw them make each pie to order, I definitely thought the doughiness of the pizza wasn't anything spectacular. In terms of service, I think it was pretty solid. Our waiter was patient and helpful. As a surprise, Paulie Gee himself introduced himself to just about every table, making it feel quite personable. In all, I definitely wouldn't return back to this pizzeria, especially with that crazy wait. During that 2-hour wait and 1.5-hour dining time, I can drive down to Baltimore and get some Little Isabella for half the price and no wait!",3.0
"3.5 stars for this pizza joint hidden behind a HUGE wooden door all the way down Franklin streetCrust was good with a nice char on the hellboy but the crust of the greenpoint pizza seemed a bit underdone We were quoted a 1.5 hour wait at 8pm for 3 on a Saturday but we were lucky that people in front of us hadn't returned so we were seated right away! (so don't be discouraged)---hellboy: everything was good about this except that spicy honey! Should of gone with a more classic margherita style pizza instead---greenpoint: fresh arugula, with a bit too much lemon juice, so nothing special NOTE: they don't have pepper flakes, only chili oil",4.0
"If you want great pizza and the right atmosphere look no further than Paulie Gee's. We sat at the bar (luckily) and avoided a two hour wait.  The pizza choices are numerous, with some very creative options. There were three of us and we started with two pies. Would have been content but it was so good we ordered a third.The texture. The crust. The toppings. Hard pressed to mention anything I didn't like. I love pizza and this place is right up there with the best. That includes many pizzerias throughout Italy.Paulie stopped by for a chat and he has a fantastic personality. Great stories and it is obvious that he loves what he does and holds him team to very high standards.He was also kind enough to give me an official Paulie Gee's pin and a limoncello. A very nice touch!Make sure you check out the pizza oven in the back. It's a small,cozy place so don't pass this place up in you are in NY.",5.0
I take my pizza very seriously. The vegan pizza is so good here that if they didn't tell you it was vegan you would have no clue. I had the pie with vegan sausage and shared a few others with friends. It was all out of this world. I can't wait to go back again.,5.0
"There's a LOT of really great pizza in NYC, that's nothing new. But combine amazing pizza with friendly, caring service and a killer ambiance, and Paulie Gee's has a leg up on a lot of the other heavy hitters. The wait can be crazy, but we came in on a Tuesday night and it was half empty. I guess the key is to come when there's post-blizzard sludge everywhere and no one else wants to go out. Paulie Gee was there as I'm told he usually is, weaving around the space with his cup of coffee and stopping at literally every table. For us, he offered to curate our pizza order and who were we to argue? Read on for what Paulie Gee himself recommends:- The Greenpointer: according to Paulie, basically like eating a salad due to the piles of fresh baby arugula on top. - The Mo Cheeks: My personal favorite of the meal. The pickled onions on there are a nice surprise, and give a nice kick to the rest of the ingredients. - The Monte Cristo: OK, so this is probably something I would never think to order myself, but I'm glad it came out for us because it's actually super tasty.

The first time I tried to go, it was around noon, and my gf and I made the unpleasant discovery that Paulie Gee's does not open til 5 PM. The next time, we rolled up in a deep crew of six and had to wait about two to three hours for a table for six.

My girlfriend and I were in the shot all throughout our meal, and we were fighting (as subtly as possible) for the duration of our meal. I was taken aback and somewhat miffed when the producers of the show asked to do a talking head with us outside. The tension was palpable but they still insisted on interviewing us.

"I almost feel like it's blasphemy for not giving 5 stars. Finally made my way over here at Paulie Gees after way too long. Clearly this place is GPs staple so was excited to drop by on Wednesday night.There was no wait- very good. I had been worried about this so called 3x around 6:45pm to see how long it was before heading over. No one picked up and their answering service basically hangs up on you. I ordered the Daniela and he ordered the brisket pizza. Mine came out a good 7 minutes before his. I noticed immediately that about 40% of the crust was charred to the point of being inedible. To top that off, the spinach topping my pizza was the same. It was literally a black piece of ash and when I picked a leaf up or crumbled in my hands. The cheese blend was very good (mozzarella and Parmesan) but the pizza was just not good. To top it off, parts of the center were soggy and didn't hold the toppings when I grabbed a slice. When the brisket pizza came out a few minutes later I noticed immediately that it was cooked perfectly. The crust was edible and delicious. I was bummed that mine didn't come out this way especially since it seemed like a classic. All I can say is they probably put our orders in together and maybe his needed a little longer in the oven. Mine was most likely getting over cooked while his needed a few more minutes. Hence the gap in time between both of our orders coming out and the reason why mine was half done by the time his came out.I was really disappointed but the good thing to know is at least the brisket pizza was cooked well. I know there is a good meal at Paulie Gees but I feel like we were jipped.Also, great touch that Paulie himself came in to greet all the diners. He was super friendly and it brings a family quality to the place. This is maybe one of the main reasons I'd come back.",3.0

I would highly recommend this tactic to those of you who have been meaning to come and haven't been able to due to the wait -- the food will be worth it. We ordered the hellboy, ricotta be kidding me and the hot honey ice cream Sunday for dessert. The hellboy was our fave. It was basically a pepperoni pizza with hot honey lined under the cheese. I liked it more than the bees sting from Robertas but both are very good. All in all would highly recommend.

"My husband and I visited Paulie Gee's about two years ago and he still dreams of the Hellboy. This time we ordered the Hellboy and Cherry Jones.  The Hellboy was great but just a touch too sweet for me.  The hot honey adds a little kick but is definitely not too hot.  My husband will tell you it is the best pizza he has ever had (saying a lot since he was raised in the Bronx).  The Cherry Jones on the other hand was way too sweet for both of us.  I couldn't taste anything other then honey.  My husband embarrassed me by telling the waitress we didn't like it.  She offered us a replacement.  We ordered the Ricky Ricotta.  It was alright.  I was shocked because the ricotta was not warm.  The crust at Paulie Gee's is the perfect texture.  However, two of our three pizzas were too charred for my taste.  I must mention Paulie walks around all the tables to make sure everyone is enjoying.  Love it!  The restaurant is too dark and loud for my taste.",3.0

"New York probably takes its pizza more seriously than anywhere else in the world.  I'm sure there are 7 or 8 people reading this right now that would be willing to shiv a guy for saying something bad about their favorite slice.  With that in mind, Paulie Gee's is a pizza lover's pizza place.  They make Neapolitan style pizzas with an oven shipped in from Naples and lovingly reassembled by small, Italian elves.  From this oven, comes perfectly leopard-spotted pizzas with just the right amount of bouncy chewy dough.To top the pizza, there's a lovingly curated selection to choose from so don't you dare ask for substitutions.  Lucky for you whether you're a vegan, vegetarian, white/red pie lover, averse to spice, meat lover, or whatever!  There's at least one pie on the menu* that will make you say, ""hmmm..."".  My personal favorites are the Mo' Cheeks ($16, has guanciale and is perfect with the pickled onions) and Ricotta Be Kidding Me ($17, with tons of meat topped with adorable dollops of cottage cheese).  I've only ever had 1 pizza there that wasn't stellar and I won't tell you which one because you'll definitely judge me for choosing it in the first place.The atmosphere at Paulie Gee's is great.  It's quintessential Brooklyn.  Think dark unfinished wood walls with an eclectic collection of tables made from reclaimed wood, music consisting of a mixture of jazz, rock, and anything but top 40s.  What always makes my night is that the ACTUAL Paulie Gee walks around and talks to EVERYONE.  It doesn't matter if Keri Russell** is sitting right next to you, he will still come by and have a 5-20 minute conversation with you and your table.  My only complaint is how popular this place is.  They've stopped making pizzas to go and still, the wait is crazy.  I've never been able to get a table in less than 45 minutes unless it was late at night.  I guess that's not a bad problem to have.  I also kind of wish they would get a full liquor license and take that creative pizza combo creating mind into the cocktail realm.  I mean...Mike's Hot Honey + Whiskey?  Maybe?---------* If you can't find a pizza you like on the printed menu in the restaurant, whip out the smartphone and check out the ""secret"" menu on the website.** This actually happened.",4.0
"We've literally flown across the country to enjoy his pizza. It's that good! Walking in, the aroma of pizza cooking in a brick oven hits your nose.This is about time my stomach starts to growl. The vibe is flowing with positive energy, and the low lighting is flattering & sexy. The bar to the left is where you can order a beverage while you wait.  They have a decent beer selection. Wait times vary, but it's usually not as long as anticipated, and well worth the effort.Everyone, including the servers, seem happy to be there.Paulie Gee is the utmost host. He's always found time to come to our table with suggestions, stories, and the occasional limoncello, (his recipe of the celebratory cocktail).Talking with him, I've gathered that he makes the vegan pizza for the people, or demand for it, but he didn't seem interested in the cause. The funky bathrooms can be a challenge to use when you've had one too many! VEGAN Pies we LOVE Simply RedVegan Tomato Sauce with Tomatoes, Olive Oil. Vidalia Onions, Garlic, Basil, Salt and PepperVegan Daniela SpinaciBaby Spinach, Olive Oil, Fresh Sliced Garlic, Mild Aleppo Chili Oil and Sea SaltIn Ricotta Da VeganVegan Tomato Sauce, House Made Vegan Sausage, Post-oven House Made Cashew Ricotta Dollops, Baby Arugula and Extra Virgin Olive OilWith many return visits, we've yet to have a negative experience.There has been noise over the years of Paulie Giannone opening a Portland outpost, but it has yet to materialize. Meanwhile, I'll dream of his pizza.",5.0
"Absolutely delicious. Huge selection of pies - good for meatatarians, vegetarians, and even vegans. Wood fire oven delivers the signature light smoke and char. Dough is absolutely tender and springy. They even let the pizza rest afterwards so the cheese sets and you don't burn the crap out of your mouth.Hellboy- spicy pepperoni with hot honey. Absolute classic pizza. Hot honey perfectly blankets the spicy meat. Super simple, absolutely delicious. Get two, trust meRicotta/sausage pie - similar to one above, hot honey included. However ricotta and sausage are a welcome addition. While chunks of roasted garlic are an excellent accentSo many other pies, go try them for yourself.Big lines, put your name down and go drink at browerij lane.

"One of the challenges of  being vegan is getting your friends/family to be open to the idea of trying vegan food.I have never had Vegan Pizza before and I usually try to try a restaurant first before recommending to anyone especially a non vegan but I took a chance.When we first arrived we were having trouble picking something since everything was foreign to us. Someone sitting next to us saw our struggle and took us to try the  IN Ricotta Da Vegan so we did. AMAZING!! My non vegan date was impressed and I was so happy.Thanks Paulie Gee for making me looking good Whew! One pie (6 small slices) goes for 16 bucks . Its small, nice ambiance I would say its a little darkI would go again!Menu like here ------ pauliegee.com/greenpoint… xoxoC.",4.0
"Some of the best za in the city, bar none. The lady and I traveled far and wide for it since we'd heard such great things. It was a Friday night so the restaurant was predictably packed. There's not much in the form of a waiting area, which particularly sucked given how freezing the weather was, but we had a feeling the pie would be well worth the wait (plus we also got to watch a tipsy couple aggressively suck face up close and personal which was an unexpected but enjoyable twist).The vibe was cool, featuring low--lighting, a huge and beautiful custom brick oven, and trendy attractive people who's favorite bands you've never heard of.When we finally were seated I was stoked to see the menu offered a huge variety of pies with all sorts of niche toppings AND vegan options(I personally don't give two damns about veganism but they presented them in an unpretentious way so I was cool with it). We eventually decided to go with the Hell Boy and the Prokypineapple, both of which were amazing, and I'm looking forward to going back and further chowing my way down the menu.Go here.",5.0
"After a 2-hours wait on a weekend for a party of 2, we finally got a table at the renowned pizza shop in Brooklyn. After having one of the best pizzas of all time at Little Isabella located in Baltimore, I was on the mission to find its companion in NYC. Overhyped as we suspected, Paulie Gee had nothing on Little Isabella! Perhaps, it was the quirky blend of sweet and savory flavors, but with that 2-hour wait, we surely did not have a pleasing experience.We ordered two pies: HellBoy and Greenpointer. HellBoy: Fresh Mozzarella, Italian Tomatoes, Berkshire Sopressata Piccante, Parmigiano Reggiano and Mike's HOT HoneyGreenpointer:Fresh Mozzarella, Baby Arugula, Olive Oil, Fresh Lemon Juice and Shaved Parmigiano ReggianoWe didn't really enjoy the sweetness of the honey in the HellBoy or the sourness of the lemon juice in the Greenpointer. Fresh, as we saw them make each pie to order, I definitely thought the doughiness of the pizza wasn't anything spectacular. In terms of service, I think it was pretty solid. Our waiter was patient and helpful. As a surprise, Paulie Gee himself introduced himself to just about every table, making it feel quite personable. In all, I definitely wouldn't return back to this pizzeria, especially with that crazy wait. During that 2-hour wait and 1.5-hour dining time, I can drive down to Baltimore and get some Little Isabella for half the price and no wait!",3.0
"3.5 stars for this pizza joint hidden behind a HUGE wooden door all the way down Franklin streetCrust was good with a nice char on the hellboy but the crust of the greenpoint pizza seemed a bit underdone We were quoted a 1.5 hour wait at 8pm for 3 on a Saturday but we were lucky that people in front of us hadn't returned so we were seated right away! (so don't be discouraged)---hellboy: everything was good about this except that spicy honey! Should of gone with a more classic margherita style pizza instead---greenpoint: fresh arugula, with a bit too much lemon juice, so nothing special NOTE: they don't have pepper flakes, only chili oil",4.0
"If you want great pizza and the right atmosphere look no further than Paulie Gee's. We sat at the bar (luckily) and avoided a two hour wait.  The pizza choices are numerous, with some very creative options. There were three of us and we started with two pies. Would have been content but it was so good we ordered a third.The texture. The crust. The toppings. Hard pressed to mention anything I didn't like. I love pizza and this place is right up there with the best. That includes many pizzerias throughout Italy.Paulie stopped by for a chat and he has a fantastic personality. Great stories and it is obvious that he loves what he does and holds him team to very high standards.He was also kind enough to give me an official Paulie Gee's pin and a limoncello. A very nice touch!Make sure you check out the pizza oven in the back. It's a small,cozy place so don't pass this place up in you are in NY.",5.0
I take my pizza very seriously. The vegan pizza is so good here that if they didn't tell you it was vegan you would have no clue. I had the pie with vegan sausage and shared a few others with friends. It was all out of this world. I can't wait to go back again.,5.0
"There's a LOT of really great pizza in NYC, that's nothing new. But combine amazing pizza with friendly, caring service and a killer ambiance, and Paulie Gee's has a leg up on a lot of the other heavy hitters. The wait can be crazy, but we came in on a Tuesday night and it was half empty. I guess the key is to come when there's post-blizzard sludge everywhere and no one else wants to go out. Paulie Gee was there as I'm told he usually is, weaving around the space with his cup of coffee and stopping at literally every table. For us, he offered to curate our pizza order and who were we to argue? Read on for what Paulie Gee himself recommends:- The Greenpointer: according to Paulie, basically like eating a salad due to the piles of fresh baby arugula on top. - The Mo Cheeks: My personal favorite of the meal. The pickled onions on there are a nice surprise, and give a nice kick to the rest of the ingredients. - The Monte Cristo: OK, so this is probably something I would never think to order myself, but I'm glad it came out for us because it's actually super tasty. It comes with Canadian bacon and a drizzle of maple syrup, which I know sounds weird but trust me (or rather, trust Paulie). - I didn't catch the name of the last pizza, but it was one of the best and after peeking at the menu again I think it might have been the Hellboy. It was piled high with the tastiest Berkshire Sopressata, and it was perfect with the side of Mike's hot honey (which you haven't tried on pizza you must immediately). They asked if we wanted a dessert pizza but at that point we were stuffed to the gills. It was one of the best New York pizza experiences I've had so far, and the service is what really puts them above and beyond. I'm going to run for vice-president of the Paulie Gee fanclub soon!",5.0
"Came here a few days ago with my friend after work. Very dark inside, took some time for my eyeballs to adjust lol. We started off with some beers and then went with the Hellboy which was AMAZING. The hot honey makes a difference! Then we went with a vegan pie since neither one of us was particularly full. We ordered one with spinach, sea salt and garlic on it (sorry don't remember the name!) It was OK, not that memorable. The standout is by far Hellboy, the crust for both pizzas was SUPER THIN, firm and didn't fall apart on me. We both liked it. I took off a star for the spinach pie being nothing special and that it's a bit on the pricey side. Overall, I think I'll be back to try the other pizzas on the menu!",4.0
"Maybe we came on an off night, but we didn't care too much about the pizza and it was definitely not the best we've had. My friend wanted to celebrate her belated birthday at Paulie Gee's and so we did. We ordered 3 pies (Greenpointer, Ricotta Be Kidding Me, and The Hometown Brisket). I think the Hometown Brisket was our favorite only because of the BBQ sauce. Other than that, there wasn't much brisket pieces on the pizza. Ricotta Be Kidding Me was okay. The Greenpointer was all greens so that balanced our meal a little bit. I hear people waiting for hours to get a seat here and right now I'm just wondering where all the hype went? We came when they were opening, so thank goodness we didn't wait on line for this...cause it wouldn't have been worth it. FYI: There's no sign outside that says ""Paulie Gee's"". You just have to look by the address number ""60"" in order to find this place. I actually walked passed it while we were trying to find it. Also, use your flash on your phones to read the menu. I really liked the rustic interior but it was literally pitch black in there.",3.0
"Zagat rated the hellboy as the best pizza in NYC. Wow! Big call Zagat... We had to try! We would say it was delicious... But I would have to say Marta is equal of not just ahead. We got here at 6:40 and had to wait over an hr to sit at the bar. When getting here service was prompt and food was great! We ordered the hellboy and the hellified porkpie white and I have to say it was fresh, full of flavor and great value. My only critique would be more hot suppressa on the hellified and take numbers at the door! It's a little unreasonable to ask people to wait 90 mins and not offer to call when table it ready. Either way it was great but probably won't be crossing the river to wait another 90 mins.",4.0
"If there was ever a restaurant that inspires the need for #PiDay (3.14) to be everyday, it is Paulie Gee's. The pizza is a true art, and every bite is important, from the center to the crust crust.  PG is located in pizza heaven, or right near the water on Greenpoint Ave if you want a Google Map friendly address.Read it on my blog: highclasstohighlifes.com…As you'll see below I'm constantly on the proscuitt of happiness but this time we went for a different ham, Canadian bacon, and on the Monte Cristo. You bet it counted towards happiness. This pizza combines maple syrup drizzle and gouda with the ham. Yes, yes and more yes. Paulie asked if we had butter on the crust...sadly, no. SO MUCH REGRET....that I'll be back in no time to try it. You'll notice on the menu that they have a brisket pizza that features Hometown BBQ -- I love this local BK collaboration. You can get sauced the other way too with Greenpoint local brews!Anyway, I have nearly eaten my way through the entire menu (still need to do a bit of adventuring on the vegan side, every time I get close, I just want meat...) and I have been very pleased with every slice thus far. Therefore my advice to you is go with the pizza that's toppings are most appealing...or grab a handful of friends and share, then you can try multiple pizzas!The man, who is not a myth, but definitely a legend is often found inside checking in on tables, ensuring quality control and getting to know the patrons. He loved my last Instagram post that did a little play words...sharing that I was on the prosciutt of happiness with his King Henry Classic. He's always all smiles and usually wearing a great hat, he is Paulie Gee himself. Paulie Gee's - High Class to High Lifes If you really knead to get delivery or pickup, you'll have to look elsewhere for now though. The only way to leave Paulie Gee's with a to-go box is with leftovers. Rumor has it that a slice joint is opening up nearby though! I'm counting down the days, hours and minutes. Want to keep drooling? Read the menu!Pro Tip: Grab dinner at Paulie Gee's then walk straight out on the water in Greenpoint to Transmitter park or the outlook. Maybe even catch a sunset and BYO night cap!",5.0
"My old pal Carlos and I visited Paulie Gee's last night and had a great meal. I'm accustomed to going with the ol' vegan girlfriend and have a tradition where we split two pies from their extensive vegan selection, so we can try two different types of pies. The vegan and non-vegan selections are both extensive; each category has at least a half dozen kinds of pies, including oil bases, white slices, marinara, spinach-based, spicy honey and barbecue sauce foundations. The pies are aesthetically pleasing to every sense, well, every sense except sound. It's usually better when sound isn't a factor. At least when you're talking about food. When you're talking about music, sound is obviously a very important sense to talk about. I may go as far as to say that in a conversation about music, sound is the only sense that matters.I was excited to go with Carlos because I was going to get to eat their meat and actual cheese. The Paulie Gee's brisket is lean and delicious. Their pickled red onions possess a truly memorable tang and are worth spending a couple buck to add on to pretty much any pie. The ricotta dollops on the Ricky Ricotta feel more like bursts of a cream sauce than regular old cheese. Interestingly, the dairy and non-dairy ricotta cheeses are almost indecipherable in quality, which goes to show that Paulie Gee's knows what's up. Carlos and I were pleased to compliment the trad Italian flavors of the Ricky Ricotta with a tangy Barbecue Brisket pie. I'm psyched to go with a fellow omnivore again, because there are tons of other flavor combos I'm eager to try. New Yorkers, such as myself, are notorious for being dicks about the quality of pizza dough. It's the dough that invalidates the Chicago Deep Dish's false aspiration to pizza status. I can't stand Sicilian pizza either, which is a controversial take in Nueva York. Anyhow, no matter how well adorned a Paulie Gee's pie is, its base--the crust--is its most distinct and wonderful element. The crust is thin but springy, and always a little charred. It's pretty much naan bread, which is either a very luck coincidence or a visionary innovation. Naan bread, as you know, is lit, and, as it turns out, it is the perfect surface upon which various pizza ingredients should be placed and/or spread to mingle harmoniously.I've visited Paulie Gee's a number of times, and there's a bit of narrative that forms around my visits. The first time I tried to go, it was around noon, and my gf and I made the unpleasant discovery that Paulie Gee's does not open til 5 PM. The next time, we rolled up in a deep crew of six and had to wait about two to three hours for a table for six. If you find yourself in that position, you'll be okay though because there are plenty of bars around. There's also the water/skyline, mere yards away and a nice record store a block away.The gf and I have gone a few other times and it's always been great--except for the one time that a camera crew was shooting a special on Paulie Gee's vegan options.

"New York probably takes its pizza more seriously than anywhere else in the world.  I'm sure there are 7 or 8 people reading this right now that would be willing to shiv a guy for saying something bad about their favorite slice.  With that in mind, Paulie Gee's is a pizza lover's pizza place.  They make Neapolitan style pizzas with an oven shipped in from Naples and lovingly reassembled by small, Italian elves.  From this oven, comes perfectly leopard-spotted pizzas with just the right amount of bouncy chewy dough.To top the pizza, there's a lovingly curated selection to choose from so don't you dare ask for substitutions.  Lucky for you whether you're a vegan, vegetarian, white/red pie lover, averse to spice, meat lover, or whatever!  There's at least one pie on the menu* that will make you say, ""hmmm..."".  My personal favorites are the Mo' Cheeks ($16, has guanciale and is perfect with the pickled onions) and Ricotta Be Kidding Me ($17, with tons of meat topped with adorable dollops of cottage cheese).  I've only ever had 1 pizza there that wasn't stellar and I won't tell you which one because you'll definitely judge me for choosing it in the first place.The atmosphere at Paulie Gee's is great.  It's quintessential Brooklyn.  Think dark unfinished wood walls with an eclectic collection of tables made from reclaimed wood, music consisting of a mixture of jazz, rock, and anything but top 40s.  What always makes my night is that the ACTUAL Paulie Gee walks around and talks to EVERYONE.  It doesn't matter if Keri Russell** is sitting right next to you, he will still come by and have a 5-20 minute conversation with you and your table.  My only complaint is how popular this place is.  They've stopped making pizzas to go and still, the wait is crazy.  I've never been able to get a table in less than 45 minutes unless it was late at night.  I guess that's not a bad problem to have.  I also kind of wish they would get a full liquor license and take that creative pizza combo creating mind into the cocktail realm.  I mean...Mike's Hot Honey + Whiskey?  Maybe?---------* If you can't find a pizza you like on the printed menu in the restaurant, whip out the smartphone and check out the ""secret"" menu on the website.** This actually happened.",4.0

"Some of the best za in the city, bar none. The lady and I traveled far and wide for it since we'd heard such great things. It was a Friday night so the restaurant was predictably packed. There's not much in the form of a waiting area, which particularly sucked given how freezing the weather was, but we had a feeling the pie would be well worth the wait (plus we also got to watch a tipsy couple aggressively suck face up close and personal which was an unexpected but enjoyable twist).The vibe was cool, featuring low--lighting, a huge and beautiful custom brick oven, and trendy attractive people who's favorite bands you've never heard of.When we finally were seated I was stoked to see the menu offered a huge variety of pies with all sorts of niche toppings AND vegan options(I personally don't give two damns about veganism but they presented them in an unpretentious way so I was cool with it).

"After a 2-hours wait on a weekend for a party of 2, we finally got a table at the renowned pizza shop in Brooklyn. After having one of the best pizzas of all time at Little Isabella located in Baltimore, I was on the mission to find its companion in NYC. Overhyped as we suspected, Paulie Gee had nothing on Little Isabella! Perhaps, it was the quirky blend of sweet and savory flavors, but with that 2-hour wait, we surely did not have a pleasing experience.We ordered two pies: HellBoy and Greenpointer. HellBoy: Fresh Mozzarella, Italian Tomatoes, Berkshire Sopressata Piccante, Parmigiano Reggiano and Mike's HOT HoneyGreenpointer:Fresh Mozzarella, Baby Arugula, Olive Oil, Fresh Lemon Juice and Shaved Parmigiano ReggianoWe didn't really enjoy the sweetness of the honey in the HellBoy or the sourness of the lemon juice in the Greenpointer. Fresh, as we saw them make each pie to order, I definitely thought the doughiness of the pizza wasn't anything spectacular. In terms of service, I think it was pretty solid. Our waiter was patient and helpful. As a surprise, Paulie Gee himself introduced himself to just about every table, making it feel quite personable. In all, I definitely wouldn't return back to this pizzeria, especially with that crazy wait. During that 2-hour wait and 1.5-hour dining time, I can drive down to Baltimore and get some Little Isabella for half the price and no wait!",3.0
"3.5 stars for this pizza joint hidden behind a HUGE wooden door all the way down Franklin streetCrust was good with a nice char on the hellboy but the crust of the greenpoint pizza seemed a bit underdone We were quoted a 1.5 hour wait at 8pm for 3 on a Saturday but we were lucky that people in front of us hadn't returned so we were seated right away! (so don't be discouraged)---hellboy: everything was good about this except that spicy honey! Should of gone with a more classic margherita style pizza instead---greenpoint: fresh arugula, with a bit too much lemon juice, so nothing special NOTE: they don't have pepper flakes, only chili oil",4.0
"If you want great pizza and the right atmosphere look no further than Paulie Gee's. We sat at the bar (luckily) and avoided a two hour wait.  The pizza choices are numerous, with some very creative options. There were three of us and we started with two pies. Would have been content but it was so good we ordered a third.The texture. The crust. The toppings. Hard pressed to mention anything I didn't like. I love pizza and this place is right up there with the best. That includes many pizzerias throughout Italy.Paulie stopped by for a chat and he has a fantastic personality. Great stories and it is obvious that he loves what he does and holds him team to very high standards.He was also kind enough to give me an official Paulie Gee's pin and a limoncello. A very nice touch!Make sure you check out the pizza oven in the back. It's a small,cozy place so don't pass this place up in you are in NY.",5.0
I take my pizza very seriously. The vegan pizza is so good here that if they didn't tell you it was vegan you would have no clue. I had the pie with vegan sausage and shared a few others with friends. It was all out of this world. I can't wait to go back again.,5.0
"There's a LOT of really great pizza in NYC, that's nothing new. But combine amazing pizza with friendly, caring service and a killer ambiance, and Paulie Gee's has a leg up on a lot of the other heavy hitters. The wait can be crazy, but we came in on a Tuesday night and it was half empty. I guess the key is to come when there's post-blizzard sludge everywhere and no one else wants to go out. Paulie Gee was there as I'm told he usually is, weaving around the space with his cup of coffee and stopping at literally every table. For us, he offered to curate our pizza order and who were we to argue? Read on for what Paulie Gee himself recommends:- The Greenpointer: according to Paulie, basically like eating a salad due to the piles of fresh baby arugula on top. - The Mo Cheeks: My personal favorite of the meal. The pickled onions on there are a nice surprise, and give a nice kick to the rest of the ingredients. - The Monte Cristo: OK, so this is probably something I would never think to order myself, but I'm glad it came out for us because it's actually super tasty. It comes with Canadian bacon and a drizzle of maple syrup, which I know sounds weird but trust me (or rather, trust Paulie). - I didn't catch the name of the last pizza, but it was one of the best and after peeking at the menu again I think it might have been the Hellboy. It was piled high with the tastiest Berkshire Sopressata, and it was perfect with the side of Mike's hot honey (which you haven't tried on pizza you must immediately). They asked if we wanted a dessert pizza but at that point we were stuffed to the gills. It was one of the best New York pizza experiences I've had so far, and the service is what really puts them above and beyond. I'm going to run for vice-president of the Paulie Gee fanclub soon!",5.0
"Came here a few days ago with my friend after work. Very dark inside, took some time for my eyeballs to adjust lol. We started off with some beers and then went with the Hellboy which was AMAZING. The hot honey makes a difference! Then we went with a vegan pie since neither one of us was particularly full. We ordered one with spinach, sea salt and garlic on it (sorry don't remember the name!) It was OK, not that memorable. The standout is by far Hellboy, the crust for both pizzas was SUPER THIN, firm and didn't fall apart on me. We both liked it. I took off a star for the spinach pie being nothing special and that it's a bit on the pricey side. Overall, I think I'll be back to try the other pizzas on the menu!",4.0
"Maybe we came on an off night, but we didn't care too much about the pizza and it was definitely not the best we've had. My friend wanted to celebrate her belated birthday at Paulie Gee's and so we did. We ordered 3 pies (Greenpointer, Ricotta Be Kidding Me, and The Hometown Brisket). I think the Hometown Brisket was our favorite only because of the BBQ sauce. Other than that, there wasn't much brisket pieces on the pizza. Ricotta Be Kidding Me was okay. The Greenpointer was all greens so that balanced our meal a little bit. I hear people waiting for hours to get a seat here and right now I'm just wondering where all the hype went? We came when they were opening, so thank goodness we didn't wait on line for this...cause it wouldn't have been worth it. FYI: There's no sign outside that says ""Paulie Gee's"". You just have to look by the address number ""60"" in order to find this place. I actually walked passed it while we were trying to find it. Also, use your flash on your phones to read the menu. I really liked the rustic interior but it was literally pitch black in there.",3.0
"Zagat rated the hellboy as the best pizza in NYC. Wow! Big call Zagat... We had to try! We would say it was delicious... But I would have to say Marta is equal of not just ahead. We got here at 6:40 and had to wait over an hr to sit at the bar. When getting here service was prompt and food was great! We ordered the hellboy and the hellified porkpie white and I have to say it was fresh, full of flavor and great value. My only critique would be more hot suppressa on the hellified and take numbers at the door! It's a little unreasonable to ask people to wait 90 mins and not offer to call when table it ready. Either way it was great but probably won't be crossing the river to wait another 90 mins.",4.0
"If there was ever a restaurant that inspires the need for #PiDay (3.14) to be everyday, it is Paulie Gee's. The pizza is a true art, and every bite is important, from the center to the crust crust.  PG is located in pizza heaven, or right near the water on Greenpoint Ave if you want a Google Map friendly address.Read it on my blog: highclasstohighlifes.com…As you'll see below I'm constantly on the proscuitt of happiness but this time we went for a different ham, Canadian bacon, and on the Monte Cristo. You bet it counted towards happiness. This pizza combines maple syrup drizzle and gouda with the ham. Yes, yes and more yes. Paulie asked if we had butter on the crust...sadly, no. SO MUCH REGRET....that I'll be back in no time to try it. You'll notice on the menu that they have a brisket pizza that features Hometown BBQ -- I love this local BK collaboration. You can get sauced the other way too with Greenpoint local brews!Anyway, I have nearly eaten my way through the entire menu (still need to do a bit of adventuring on the vegan side, every time I get close, I just want meat...) and I have been very pleased with every slice thus far. Therefore my advice to you is go with the pizza that's toppings are most appealing...or grab a handful of friends and share, then you can try multiple pizzas!The man, who is not a myth, but definitely a legend is often found inside checking in on tables, ensuring quality control and getting to know the patrons. He loved my last Instagram post that did a little play words...sharing that I was on the prosciutt of happiness with his King Henry Classic. He's always all smiles and usually wearing a great hat, he is Paulie Gee himself. Paulie Gee's - High Class to High Lifes If you really knead to get delivery or pickup, you'll have to look elsewhere for now though. The only way to leave Paulie Gee's with a to-go box is with leftovers. Rumor has it that a slice joint is opening up nearby though! I'm counting down the days, hours and minutes. Want to keep drooling? Read the menu!Pro Tip: Grab dinner at Paulie Gee's then walk straight out on the water in Greenpoint to Transmitter park or the outlook. Maybe even catch a sunset and BYO night cap!",5.0
"My old pal Carlos and I visited Paulie Gee's last night and had a great meal. I'm accustomed to going with the ol' vegan girlfriend and have a tradition where we split two pies from their extensive vegan selection, so we can try two different types of pies. The vegan and non-vegan selections are both extensive; each category has at least a half dozen kinds of pies, including oil bases, white slices, marinara, spinach-based, spicy honey and barbecue sauce foundations. The pies are aesthetically pleasing to every sense, well, every sense except sound. It's usually better when sound isn't a factor. At least when you're talking about food. When you're talking about music, sound is obviously a very important sense to talk about. I may go as far as to say that in a conversation about music, sound is the only sense that matters.I was excited to go with Carlos because I was going to get to eat their meat and actual cheese. The Paulie Gee's brisket is lean and delicious. Their pickled red onions possess a truly memorable tang and are worth spending a couple buck to add on to pretty much any pie. The ricotta dollops on the Ricky Ricotta feel more like bursts of a cream sauce than regular old cheese. Interestingly, the dairy and non-dairy ricotta cheeses are almost indecipherable in quality, which goes to show that Paulie Gee's knows what's up. Carlos and I were pleased to compliment the trad Italian flavors of the Ricky Ricotta with a tangy Barbecue Brisket pie. I'm psyched to go with a fellow omnivore again, because there are tons of other flavor combos I'm eager to try. New Yorkers, such as myself, are notorious for being dicks about the quality of pizza dough. It's the dough that invalidates the Chicago Deep Dish's false aspiration to pizza status. I can't stand Sicilian pizza either, which is a controversial take in Nueva York. Anyhow, no matter how well adorned a Paulie Gee's pie is, its base--the crust--is its most distinct and wonderful element. The crust is thin but springy, and always a little charred. It's pretty much naan bread, which is either a very luck coincidence or a visionary innovation. Naan bread, as you know, is lit, and, as it turns out, it is the perfect surface upon which various pizza ingredients should be placed and/or spread to mingle harmoniously.I've visited Paulie Gee's a number of times, and there's a bit of narrative that forms around my visits. The first time I tried to go, it was around noon, and my gf and I made the unpleasant discovery that Paulie Gee's does not open til 5 PM. The next time, we rolled up in a deep crew of six and had to wait about two to three hours for a table for six. If you find yourself in that position, you'll be okay though because there are plenty of bars around. There's also the water/skyline, mere yards away and a nice record store a block away.The gf and I have gone a few other times and it's always been great--except for the one time that a camera crew was shooting a special on Paulie Gee's vegan options. My girlfriend and I were in the shot all throughout our meal, and we were fighting (as subtly as possible) for the duration of our meal. I was taken aback and somewhat miffed when the producers of the show asked to do a talking head with us outside. The tension was palpable but they still insisted on interviewing us. I really do believe that you should foot the bill if you're going to interview someone for your television series or web series or gratuitously long Yelp review or whatever. At LEAST commission me to write a song for the soundtrack.In closing, I would like to offer a lil sum sum for the ladies. Are you interested in grandfatherly, charmingly blue collar, short men whose personalities closely resemble those of most Robert De Niro characters--but only in David O. Russel movies? If you do, and might want to be possibly hit on by a man of this caliber, you will love Paulie Gee's. At all times, Paulie Gee's eponymous Pizza Architect and Entrepreneur, Paulie Gee, stalks the narrow spaces between tables, checking in with customers--particularly of the reasonably attractive female demographic--and asks them how their food is, making small talk and thanking them for their patronage. I think this is cool. I would do the same if I were in his position, so don't take this the wrong way. Central to Paulie Gee's game is his ability to recommend a pizza place in seemingly every zip code on the planet and his inclination to tell you (the lady in question) the name of the dude who works there/owns the place, and to tell you (still the lady in question) to tell the dude (who owns the pizza place) to say that he (Paulie Gee) says hi. The Brotherhood of Pizza Mans is truly alive and well.",5.0

"I almost feel like it's blasphemy for not giving 5 stars. Finally made my way over here at Paulie Gees after way too long. Clearly this place is GPs staple so was excited to drop by on Wednesday night.There was no wait- very good. I had been worried about this so called 3x around 6:45pm to see how long it was before heading over. No one picked up and their answering service basically hangs up on you. I ordered the Daniela and he ordered the brisket pizza. Mine came out a good 7 minutes before his. I noticed immediately that about 40% of the crust was charred to the point of being inedible. To top that off, the spinach topping my pizza was the same. It was literally a black piece of ash and when I picked a leaf up or crumbled in my hands. The cheese blend was very good (mozzarella and Parmesan) but the pizza was just not good. To top it off, parts of the center were soggy and didn't hold the toppings when I grabbed a slice. When the brisket pizza came out a few minutes later I noticed immediately that it was cooked perfectly. The crust was edible and delicious. I was bummed that mine didn't come out this way especially since it seemed like a classic. All I can say is they probably put our orders in together and maybe his needed a little longer in the oven. Mine was most likely getting over cooked while his needed a few more minutes. Hence the gap in time between both of our orders coming out and the reason why mine was half done by the time his came out.I was really disappointed but the good thing to know is at least the brisket pizza was cooked well. I know there is a good meal at Paulie Gees but I feel like we were jipped.Also, great touch that Paulie himself came in to greet all the diners. He was super friendly and it brings a family quality to the place. This is maybe one of the main reasons I'd come back.",3.0
"Delicious!! Definitely made my top 3 favorite pizza  places (the others being robertas and best pizza). We've been meaning to come forever but the line is always so long. We were finally seated right away on a Friday night because we ran over as soon as they opened at 6pm. I would highly recommend this tactic to those of you who have been meaning to come and haven't been able to due to the wait -- the food will be worth it. We ordered the hellboy, ricotta be kidding me and the hot honey ice cream Sunday for dessert. The hellboy was our fave. It was basically a pepperoni pizza with hot honey lined under the cheese. I liked it more than the bees sting from Robertas but both are very good. All in all would highly recommend. As an extra plus Paulie Gee was hanging around today,though it seems like he does this quite often, going from table to table talking to the customers.",5.0
"My husband and I visited Paulie Gee's about two years ago and he still dreams of the Hellboy. This time we ordered the Hellboy and Cherry Jones.  The Hellboy was great but just a touch too sweet for me.  The hot honey adds a little kick but is definitely not too hot.  My husband will tell you it is the best pizza he has ever had (saying a lot since he was raised in the Bronx).  The Cherry Jones on the other hand was way too sweet for both of us.  I couldn't taste anything other then honey.  My husband embarrassed me by telling the waitress we didn't like it.  She offered us a replacement.  We ordered the Ricky Ricotta.  It was alright.  I was shocked because the ricotta was not warm.  The crust at Paulie Gee's is the perfect texture.  However, two of our three pizzas were too charred for my taste.  I must mention Paulie walks around all the tables to make sure everyone is enjoying.  Love it!  The restaurant is too dark and loud for my taste.",3.0
"Interesting decor, super dark inside and it was hard to read the menu. We were seated under one of the speakers, so I felt like an old person complaining about how loud the music was, but really, we came for the food. Split a salad and a Greenpointer pie, and neither disappointed. Both were served quickly, and the pie just exploded with flavor. The lemon kick was strong but not overwhelming, and the crust was perfection. Service was attentive, friendly, and efficient. Lots of menu choices for anything your palate is craving. Overall, a very good experience, and one I would look forward to enjoying again.",4.0

I take my pizza very seriously. The vegan pizza is so good here that if they didn't tell you it was vegan you would have no clue. I had the pie with vegan sausage and shared a few others with friends. It was all out of this world. I can't wait to go back again.,5.0
"There's a LOT of really great pizza in NYC, that's nothing new. But combine amazing pizza with friendly, caring service and a killer ambiance, and Paulie Gee's has a leg up on a lot of the other heavy hitters. The wait can be crazy, but we came in on a Tuesday night and it was half empty. I guess the key is to come when there's post-blizzard sludge everywhere and no one else wants to go out. Paulie Gee was there as I'm told he usually is, weaving around the space with his cup of coffee and stopping at literally every table. For us, he offered to curate our pizza order and who were we to argue? Read on for what Paulie Gee himself recommends:- The Greenpointer: according to Paulie, basically like eating a salad due to the piles of fresh baby arugula on top. - The Mo Cheeks: My personal favorite of the meal. The pickled onions on there are a nice surprise, and give a nice kick to the rest of the ingredients. - The Monte Cristo: OK, so this is probably something I would never think to order myself, but I'm glad it came out for us because it's actually super tasty. It comes with Canadian bacon and a drizzle of maple syrup, which I know sounds weird but trust me (or rather, trust Paulie). - I didn't catch the name of the last pizza, but it was one of the best and after peeking at the menu again I think it might have been the Hellboy. It was piled high with the tastiest Berkshire Sopressata, and it was perfect with the side of Mike's hot honey (which you haven't tried on pizza you must immediately). They asked if we wanted a dessert pizza but at that point we were stuffed to the gills. It was one of the best New York pizza experiences I've had so far, and the service is what really puts them above and beyond. I'm going to run for vice-president of the Paulie Gee fanclub soon!",5.0

It was OK, not that memorable. The standout is by far Hellboy, the crust for both pizzas was SUPER THIN, firm and didn't fall apart on me. We both liked it.

My friend wanted to celebrate her belated birthday at Paulie Gee's and so we did. We ordered 3 pies (Greenpointer, Ricotta Be Kidding Me, and The Hometown Brisket). I think the Hometown Brisket was our favorite only because of the BBQ sauce. Other than that, there wasn't much brisket pieces on the pizza. Ricotta Be Kidding Me was okay. The Greenpointer was all greens so that balanced our meal a little bit. I hear people waiting for hours to get a seat here and right now I'm just wondering where all the hype went? We came when they were opening, so thank goodness we didn't wait on line for this...cause it wouldn't have been worth it. FYI: There's no sign outside that says ""Paulie Gee's"".

"My old pal Carlos and I visited Paulie Gee's last night and had a great meal. I'm accustomed to going with the ol' vegan girlfriend and have a tradition where we split two pies from their extensive vegan selection, so we can try two different types of pies. The vegan and non-vegan selections are both extensive; each category has at least a half dozen kinds of pies, including oil bases, white slices, marinara, spinach-based, spicy honey and barbecue sauce foundations. The pies are aesthetically pleasing to every sense, well, every sense except sound. It's usually better when sound isn't a factor. At least when you're talking about food. When you're talking about music, sound is obviously a very important sense to talk about. I may go as far as to say that in a conversation about music, sound is the only sense that matters.I was excited to go with Carlos because I was going to get to eat their meat and actual cheese. The Paulie Gee's brisket is lean and delicious. Their pickled red onions possess a truly memorable tang and are worth spending a couple buck to add on to pretty much any pie. The ricotta dollops on the Ricky Ricotta feel more like bursts of a cream sauce than regular old cheese. Interestingly, the dairy and non-dairy ricotta cheeses are almost indecipherable in quality, which goes to show that Paulie Gee's knows what's up. Carlos and I were pleased to compliment the trad Italian flavors of the Ricky Ricotta with a tangy Barbecue Brisket pie. I'm psyched to go with a fellow omnivore again, because there are tons of other flavor combos I'm eager to try. New Yorkers, such as myself, are notorious for being dicks about the quality of pizza dough. It's the dough that invalidates the Chicago Deep Dish's false aspiration to pizza status. I can't stand Sicilian pizza either, which is a controversial take in Nueva York. Anyhow, no matter how well adorned a Paulie Gee's pie is, its base--the crust--is its most distinct and wonderful element. The crust is thin but springy, and always a little charred. It's pretty much naan bread, which is either a very luck coincidence or a visionary innovation. Naan bread, as you know, is lit, and, as it turns out, it is the perfect surface upon which various pizza ingredients should be placed and/or spread to mingle harmoniously.I've visited Paulie Gee's a number of times, and there's a bit of narrative that forms around my visits. The first time I tried to go, it was around noon, and my gf and I made the unpleasant discovery that Paulie Gee's does not open til 5 PM. The next time, we rolled up in a deep crew of six and had to wait about two to three hours for a table for six. If you find yourself in that position, you'll be okay though because there are plenty of bars around. There's also the water/skyline, mere yards away and a nice record store a block away.The gf and I have gone a few other times and it's always been great--except for the one time that a camera crew was shooting a special on Paulie Gee's vegan options. My girlfriend and I were in the shot all throughout our meal, and we were fighting (as subtly as possible) for the duration of our meal. I was taken aback and somewhat miffed when the producers of the show asked to do a talking head with us outside. The tension was palpable but they still insisted on interviewing us. I really do believe that you should foot the bill if you're going to interview someone for your television series or web series or gratuitously long Yelp review or whatever. At LEAST commission me to write a song for the soundtrack.In closing, I would like to offer a lil sum sum for the ladies. Are you interested in grandfatherly, charmingly blue collar, short men whose personalities closely resemble those of most Robert De Niro characters--but only in David O. Russel movies? If you do, and might want to be possibly hit on by a man of this caliber, you will love Paulie Gee's. At all times, Paulie Gee's eponymous Pizza Architect and Entrepreneur, Paulie Gee, stalks the narrow spaces between tables, checking in with customers--particularly of the reasonably attractive female demographic--and asks them how their food is, making small talk and thanking them for their patronage. I think this is cool. I would do the same if I were in his position, so don't take this the wrong way. Central to Paulie Gee's game is his ability to recommend a pizza place in seemingly every zip code on the planet and his inclination to tell you (the lady in question) the name of the dude who works there/owns the place, and to tell you (still the lady in question) to tell the dude (who owns the pizza place) to say that he (Paulie Gee) says hi. The Brotherhood of Pizza Mans is truly alive and well.",5.0

"I almost feel like it's blasphemy for not giving 5 stars. Finally made my way over here at Paulie Gees after way too long. Clearly this place is GPs staple so was excited to drop by on Wednesday night.There was no wait- very good. I had been worried about this so called 3x around 6:45pm to see how long it was before heading over. No one picked up and their answering service basically hangs up on you. I ordered the Daniela and he ordered the brisket pizza. Mine came out a good 7 minutes before his. I noticed immediately that about 40% of the crust was charred to the point of being inedible. To top that off, the spinach topping my pizza was the same. It was literally a black piece of ash and when I picked a leaf up or crumbled in my hands. The cheese blend was very good (mozzarella and Parmesan) but the pizza was just not good. To top it off, parts of the center were soggy and didn't hold the toppings when I grabbed a slice. When the brisket pizza came out a few minutes later I noticed immediately that it was cooked perfectly. The crust was edible and delicious. I was bummed that mine didn't come out this way especially since it seemed like a classic. All I can say is they probably put our orders in together and maybe his needed a little longer in the oven. Mine was most likely getting over cooked while his needed a few more minutes. Hence the gap in time between both of our orders coming out and the reason why mine was half done by the time his came out.I was really disappointed but the good thing to know is at least the brisket pizza was cooked well. I know there is a good meal at Paulie Gees but I feel like we were jipped.Also, great touch that Paulie himself came in to greet all the diners. He was super friendly and it brings a family quality to the place. This is maybe one of the main reasons I'd come back.",3.0
"Delicious!! Definitely made my top 3 favorite pizza  places (the others being robertas and best pizza). We've been meaning to come forever but the line is always so long. We were finally seated right away on a Friday night because we ran over as soon as they opened at 6pm. I would highly recommend this tactic to those of you who have been meaning to come and haven't been able to due to the wait -- the food will be worth it. We ordered the hellboy, ricotta be kidding me and the hot honey ice cream Sunday for dessert. The hellboy was our fave. It was basically a pepperoni pizza with hot honey lined under the cheese. I liked it more than the bees sting from Robertas but both are very good. All in all would highly recommend. As an extra plus Paulie Gee was hanging around today,though it seems like he does this quite often, going from table to table talking to the customers.",5.0
"My husband and I visited Paulie Gee's about two years ago and he still dreams of the Hellboy. This time we ordered the Hellboy and Cherry Jones.  The Hellboy was great but just a touch too sweet for me.  The hot honey adds a little kick but is definitely not too hot.  My husband will tell you it is the best pizza he has ever had (saying a lot since he was raised in the Bronx).  The Cherry Jones on the other hand was way too sweet for both of us.  I couldn't taste anything other then honey.  My husband embarrassed me by telling the waitress we didn't like it.  She offered us a replacement.  We ordered the Ricky Ricotta.  It was alright.  I was shocked because the ricotta was not warm.  The crust at Paulie Gee's is the perfect texture.  However, two of our three pizzas were too charred for my taste.  I must mention Paulie walks around all the tables to make sure everyone is enjoying.  Love it!  The restaurant is too dark and loud for my taste.",3.0
"Interesting decor, super dark inside and it was hard to read the menu. We were seated under one of the speakers, so I felt like an old person complaining about how loud the music was, but really, we came for the food. Split a salad and a Greenpointer pie, and neither disappointed. Both were served quickly, and the pie just exploded with flavor. The lemon kick was strong but not overwhelming, and the crust was perfection. Service was attentive, friendly, and efficient. Lots of menu choices for anything your palate is craving. Overall, a very good experience, and one I would look forward to enjoying again.",4.0
"New York probably takes its pizza more seriously than anywhere else in the world.  I'm sure there are 7 or 8 people reading this right now that would be willing to shiv a guy for saying something bad about their favorite slice.  With that in mind, Paulie Gee's is a pizza lover's pizza place.  They make Neapolitan style pizzas with an oven shipped in from Naples and lovingly reassembled by small, Italian elves.  From this oven, comes perfectly leopard-spotted pizzas with just the right amount of bouncy chewy dough.To top the pizza, there's a lovingly curated selection to choose from so don't you dare ask for substitutions.  Lucky for you whether you're a vegan, vegetarian, white/red pie lover, averse to spice, meat lover, or whatever!  There's at least one pie on the menu* that will make you say, ""hmmm..."".  My personal favorites are the Mo' Cheeks ($16, has guanciale and is perfect with the pickled onions) and Ricotta Be Kidding Me ($17, with tons of meat topped with adorable dollops of cottage cheese).  I've only ever had 1 pizza there that wasn't stellar and I won't tell you which one because you'll definitely judge me for choosing it in the first place.The atmosphere at Paulie Gee's is great.  It's quintessential Brooklyn.  Think dark unfinished wood walls with an eclectic collection of tables made from reclaimed wood, music consisting of a mixture of jazz, rock, and anything but top 40s.  What always makes my night is that the ACTUAL Paulie Gee walks around and talks to EVERYONE.  It doesn't matter if Keri Russell** is sitting right next to you, he will still come by and have a 5-20 minute conversation with you and your table.  My only complaint is how popular this place is.  They've stopped making pizzas to go and still, the wait is crazy.  I've never been able to get a table in less than 45 minutes unless it was late at night.  I guess that's not a bad problem to have.  I also kind of wish they would get a full liquor license and take that creative pizza combo creating mind into the cocktail realm.  I mean...Mike's Hot Honey + Whiskey?  Maybe?---------* If you can't find a pizza you like on the printed menu in the restaurant, whip out the smartphone and check out the ""secret"" menu on the website.** This actually happened.",4.0
"We've literally flown across the country to enjoy his pizza. It's that good! Walking in, the aroma of pizza cooking in a brick oven hits your nose.This is about time my stomach starts to growl. The vibe is flowing with positive energy, and the low lighting is flattering & sexy. The bar to the left is where you can order a beverage while you wait.  They have a decent beer selection. Wait times vary, but it's usually not as long as anticipated, and well worth the effort.Everyone, including the servers, seem happy to be there.Paulie Gee is the utmost host. He's always found time to come to our table with suggestions, stories, and the occasional limoncello, (his recipe of the celebratory cocktail).Talking with him, I've gathered that he makes the vegan pizza for the people, or demand for it, but he didn't seem interested in the cause.

"Absolutely delicious. Huge selection of pies - good for meatatarians, vegetarians, and even vegans. Wood fire oven delivers the signature light smoke and char. Dough is absolutely tender and springy. They even let the pizza rest afterwards so the cheese sets and you don't burn the crap out of your mouth.Hellboy- spicy pepperoni with hot honey. Absolute classic pizza. Hot honey perfectly blankets the spicy meat. Super simple, absolutely delicious. Get two, trust meRicotta/sausage pie - similar to one above, hot honey included.

"One of the challenges of  being vegan is getting your friends/family to be open to the idea of trying vegan food.I have never had Vegan Pizza before and I usually try to try a restaurant first before recommending to anyone especially a non vegan but I took a chance.When we first arrived we were having trouble picking something since everything was foreign to us. Someone sitting next to us saw our struggle and took us to try the  IN Ricotta Da Vegan so we did. AMAZING!! My non vegan date was impressed and I was so happy.Thanks Paulie Gee for making me looking good Whew! One pie (6 small slices) goes for 16 bucks .

"Some of the best za in the city, bar none. The lady and I traveled far and wide for it since we'd heard such great things. It was a Friday night so the restaurant was predictably packed. There's not much in the form of a waiting area, which particularly sucked given how freezing the weather was, but we had a feeling the pie would be well worth the wait (plus we also got to watch a tipsy couple aggressively suck face up close and personal which was an unexpected but enjoyable twist).The vibe was cool, featuring low--lighting, a huge and beautiful custom brick oven, and trendy attractive people who's favorite bands you've never heard of.When we finally were seated I was stoked to see the menu offered a huge variety of pies with all sorts of niche toppings AND vegan options(I personally don't give two damns about veganism but they presented them in an unpretentious way so I was cool with it). We eventually decided to go with the Hell Boy and the Prokypineapple, both of which were amazing, and I'm looking forward to going back and further chowing my way down the menu.Go here.",5.0
"After a 2-hours wait on a weekend for a party of 2, we finally got a table at the renowned pizza shop in Brooklyn. After having one of the best pizzas of all time at Little Isabella located in Baltimore, I was on the mission to find its companion in NYC. Overhyped as we suspected, Paulie Gee had nothing on Little Isabella! Perhaps, it was the quirky blend of sweet and savory flavors, but with that 2-hour wait, we surely did not have a pleasing experience.We ordered two pies: HellBoy and Greenpointer. HellBoy: Fresh Mozzarella, Italian Tomatoes, Berkshire Sopressata Piccante, Parmigiano Reggiano and Mike's HOT HoneyGreenpointer:Fresh Mozzarella, Baby Arugula, Olive Oil, Fresh Lemon Juice and Shaved Parmigiano ReggianoWe didn't really enjoy the sweetness of the honey in the HellBoy or the sourness of the lemon juice in the Greenpointer. Fresh, as we saw them make each pie to order, I definitely thought the doughiness of the pizza wasn't anything spectacular. In terms of service, I think it was pretty solid. Our waiter was patient and helpful. As a surprise, Paulie Gee himself introduced himself to just about every table, making it feel quite personable. In all, I definitely wouldn't return back to this pizzeria, especially with that crazy wait.

"My old pal Carlos and I visited Paulie Gee's last night and had a great meal. I'm accustomed to going with the ol' vegan girlfriend and have a tradition where we split two pies from their extensive vegan selection, so we can try two different types of pies. The vegan and non-vegan selections are both extensive; each category has at least a half dozen kinds of pies, including oil bases, white slices, marinara, spinach-based, spicy honey and barbecue sauce foundations. The pies are aesthetically pleasing to every sense, well, every sense except sound. It's usually better when sound isn't a factor. At least when you're talking about food. When you're talking about music, sound is obviously a very important sense to talk about. I may go as far as to say that in a conversation about music, sound is the only sense that matters.I was excited to go with Carlos because I was going to get to eat their meat and actual cheese. The Paulie Gee's brisket is lean and delicious. Their pickled red onions possess a truly memorable tang and are worth spending a couple buck to add on to pretty much any pie. The ricotta dollops on the Ricky Ricotta feel more like bursts of a cream sauce than regular old cheese. Interestingly, the dairy and non-dairy ricotta cheeses are almost indecipherable in quality, which goes to show that Paulie Gee's knows what's up. Carlos and I were pleased to compliment the trad Italian flavors of the Ricky Ricotta with a tangy Barbecue Brisket pie. I'm psyched to go with a fellow omnivore again, because there are tons of other flavor combos I'm eager to try. New Yorkers, such as myself, are notorious for being dicks about the quality of pizza dough. It's the dough that invalidates the Chicago Deep Dish's false aspiration to pizza status. I can't stand Sicilian pizza either, which is a controversial take in Nueva York. Anyhow, no matter how well adorned a Paulie Gee's pie is, its base--the crust--is its most distinct and wonderful element. The crust is thin but springy, and always a little charred. It's pretty much naan bread, which is either a very luck coincidence or a visionary innovation. Naan bread, as you know, is lit, and, as it turns out, it is the perfect surface upon which various pizza ingredients should be placed and/or spread to mingle harmoniously.I've visited Paulie Gee's a number of times, and there's a bit of narrative that forms around my visits. The first time I tried to go, it was around noon, and my gf and I made the unpleasant discovery that Paulie Gee's does not open til 5 PM. The next time, we rolled up in a deep crew of six and had to wait about two to three hours for a table for six. If you find yourself in that position, you'll be okay though because there are plenty of bars around. There's also the water/skyline, mere yards away and a nice record store a block away.The gf and I have gone a few other times and it's always been great--except for the one time that a camera crew was shooting a special on Paulie Gee's vegan options. My girlfriend and I were in the shot all throughout our meal, and we were fighting (as subtly as possible) for the duration of our meal. I was taken aback and somewhat miffed when the producers of the show asked to do a talking head with us outside. The tension was palpable but they still insisted on interviewing us. I really do believe that you should foot the bill if you're going to interview someone for your television series or web series or gratuitously long Yelp review or whatever.

"I almost feel like it's blasphemy for not giving 5 stars. Finally made my way over here at Paulie Gees after way too long. Clearly this place is GPs staple so was excited to drop by on Wednesday night.There was no wait- very good. I had been worried about this so called 3x around 6:45pm to see how long it was before heading over. No one picked up and their answering service basically hangs up on you. I ordered the Daniela and he ordered the brisket pizza. Mine came out a good 7 minutes before his. I noticed immediately that about 40% of the crust was charred to the point of being inedible. To top that off, the spinach topping my pizza was the same. It was literally a black piece of ash and when I picked a leaf up or crumbled in my hands. The cheese blend was very good (mozzarella and Parmesan) but the pizza was just not good. To top it off, parts of the center were soggy and didn't hold the toppings when I grabbed a slice. When the brisket pizza came out a few minutes later I noticed immediately that it was cooked perfectly. The crust was edible and delicious. I was bummed that mine didn't come out this way especially since it seemed like a classic. All I can say is they probably put our orders in together and maybe his needed a little longer in the oven. Mine was most likely getting over cooked while his needed a few more minutes. Hence the gap in time between both of our orders coming out and the reason why mine was half done by the time his came out.I was really disappointed but the good thing to know is at least the brisket pizza was cooked well. I know there is a good meal at Paulie Gees but I feel like we were jipped.Also, great touch that Paulie himself came in to greet all the diners. He was super friendly and it brings a family quality to the place. This is maybe one of the main reasons I'd come back.",3.0
"Delicious!! Definitely made my top 3 favorite pizza  places (the others being robertas and best pizza). We've been meaning to come forever but the line is always so long. We were finally seated right away on a Friday night because we ran over as soon as they opened at 6pm. I would highly recommend this tactic to those of you who have been meaning to come and haven't been able to due to the wait -- the food will be worth it. We ordered the hellboy, ricotta be kidding me and the hot honey ice cream Sunday for dessert. The hellboy was our fave. It was basically a pepperoni pizza with hot honey lined under the cheese. I liked it more than the bees sting from Robertas but both are very good. All in all would highly recommend. As an extra plus Paulie Gee was hanging around today,though it seems like he does this quite often, going from table to table talking to the customers.",5.0
"My husband and I visited Paulie Gee's about two years ago and he still dreams of the Hellboy. This time we ordered the Hellboy and Cherry Jones.  The Hellboy was great but just a touch too sweet for me.  The hot honey adds a little kick but is definitely not too hot.  My husband will tell you it is the best pizza he has ever had (saying a lot since he was raised in the Bronx).  The Cherry Jones on the other hand was way too sweet for both of us.  I couldn't taste anything other then honey.  My husband embarrassed me by telling the waitress we didn't like it.  She offered us a replacement.  We ordered the Ricky Ricotta.  It was alright.  I was shocked because the ricotta was not warm.  The crust at Paulie Gee's is the perfect texture.  However, two of our three pizzas were too charred for my taste.  I must mention Paulie walks around all the tables to make sure everyone is enjoying.  Love it!  The restaurant is too dark and loud for my taste.",3.0
"Interesting decor, super dark inside and it was hard to read the menu. We were seated under one of the speakers, so I felt like an old person complaining about how loud the music was, but really, we came for the food. Split a salad and a Greenpointer pie, and neither disappointed. Both were served quickly, and the pie just exploded with flavor. The lemon kick was strong but not overwhelming, and the crust was perfection. Service was attentive, friendly, and efficient. Lots of menu choices for anything your palate is craving. Overall, a very good experience, and one I would look forward to enjoying again.",4.0
"New York probably takes its pizza more seriously than anywhere else in the world.  I'm sure there are 7 or 8 people reading this right now that would be willing to shiv a guy for saying something bad about their favorite slice.  With that in mind, Paulie Gee's is a pizza lover's pizza place.  They make Neapolitan style pizzas with an oven shipped in from Naples and lovingly reassembled by small, Italian elves.  From this oven, comes perfectly leopard-spotted pizzas with just the right amount of bouncy chewy dough.To top the pizza, there's a lovingly curated selection to choose from so don't you dare ask for substitutions.  Lucky for you whether you're a vegan, vegetarian, white/red pie lover, averse to spice, meat lover, or whatever!  There's at least one pie on the menu* that will make you say, ""hmmm..."".  My personal favorites are the Mo' Cheeks ($16, has guanciale and is perfect with the pickled onions) and Ricotta Be Kidding Me ($17, with tons of meat topped with adorable dollops of cottage cheese).  I've only ever had 1 pizza there that wasn't stellar and I won't tell you which one because you'll definitely judge me for choosing it in the first place.The atmosphere at Paulie Gee's is great.  It's quintessential Brooklyn.  Think dark unfinished wood walls with an eclectic collection of tables made from reclaimed wood, music consisting of a mixture of jazz, rock, and anything but top 40s.  What always makes my night is that the ACTUAL Paulie Gee walks around and talks to EVERYONE.  It doesn't matter if Keri Russell** is sitting right next to you, he will still come by and have a 5-20 minute conversation with you and your table.  My only complaint is how popular this place is.  They've stopped making pizzas to go and still, the wait is crazy.  I've never been able to get a table in less than 45 minutes unless it was late at night.  I guess that's not a bad problem to have.  I also kind of wish they would get a full liquor license and take that creative pizza combo creating mind into the cocktail realm.  I mean...Mike's Hot Honey + Whiskey?  Maybe?---------* If you can't find a pizza you like on the printed menu in the restaurant, whip out the smartphone and check out the ""secret"" menu on the website.** This actually happened.",4.0
"We've literally flown across the country to enjoy his pizza. It's that good! Walking in, the aroma of pizza cooking in a brick oven hits your nose.This is about time my stomach starts to growl. The vibe is flowing with positive energy, and the low lighting is flattering & sexy. The bar to the left is where you can order a beverage while you wait.  They have a decent beer selection. Wait times vary, but it's usually not as long as anticipated, and well worth the effort.Everyone, including the servers, seem happy to be there.Paulie Gee is the utmost host. He's always found time to come to our table with suggestions, stories, and the occasional limoncello, (his recipe of the celebratory cocktail).Talking with him, I've gathered that he makes the vegan pizza for the people, or demand for it, but he didn't seem interested in the cause. The funky bathrooms can be a challenge to use when you've had one too many! VEGAN Pies we LOVE Simply RedVegan Tomato Sauce with Tomatoes, Olive Oil. Vidalia Onions, Garlic, Basil, Salt and PepperVegan Daniela SpinaciBaby Spinach, Olive Oil, Fresh Sliced Garlic, Mild Aleppo Chili Oil and Sea SaltIn Ricotta Da VeganVegan Tomato Sauce, House Made Vegan Sausage, Post-oven House Made Cashew Ricotta Dollops, Baby Arugula and Extra Virgin Olive OilWith many return visits, we've yet to have a negative experience.There has been noise over the years of Paulie Giannone opening a Portland outpost, but it has yet to materialize. Meanwhile, I'll dream of his pizza.",5.0
"Absolutely delicious. Huge selection of pies - good for meatatarians, vegetarians, and even vegans. Wood fire oven delivers the signature light smoke and char. Dough is absolutely tender and springy. They even let the pizza rest afterwards so the cheese sets and you don't burn the crap out of your mouth.Hellboy- spicy pepperoni with hot honey. Absolute classic pizza. Hot honey perfectly blankets the spicy meat. Super simple, absolutely delicious. Get two, trust meRicotta/sausage pie - similar to one above, hot honey included. However ricotta and sausage are a welcome addition. While chunks of roasted garlic are an excellent accentSo many other pies, go try them for yourself.Big lines, put your name down and go drink at browerij lane.

"One of the challenges of  being vegan is getting your friends/family to be open to the idea of trying vegan food.I have never had Vegan Pizza before and I usually try to try a restaurant first before recommending to anyone especially a non vegan but I took a chance.When we first arrived we were having trouble picking something since everything was foreign to us. Someone sitting next to us saw our struggle and took us to try the  IN Ricotta Da Vegan so we did. AMAZING!! My non vegan date was impressed and I was so happy.Thanks Paulie Gee for making me looking good Whew! One pie (6 small slices) goes for 16 bucks . Its small, nice ambiance I would say its a little darkI would go again!Menu like here ------ pauliegee.com/greenpoint… xoxoC.",4.0
"Some of the best za in the city, bar none. The lady and I traveled far and wide for it since we'd heard such great things. It was a Friday night so the restaurant was predictably packed. There's not much in the form of a waiting area, which particularly sucked given how freezing the weather was, but we had a feeling the pie would be well worth the wait (plus we also got to watch a tipsy couple aggressively suck face up close and personal which was an unexpected but enjoyable twist).The vibe was cool, featuring low--lighting, a huge and beautiful custom brick oven, and trendy attractive people who's favorite bands you've never heard of.When we finally were seated I was stoked to see the menu offered a huge variety of pies with all sorts of niche toppings AND vegan options(I personally don't give two damns about veganism but they presented them in an unpretentious way so I was cool with it). We eventually decided to go with the Hell Boy and the Prokypineapple, both of which were amazing, and I'm looking forward to going back and further chowing my way down the menu.Go here.",5.0
"After a 2-hours wait on a weekend for a party of 2, we finally got a table at the renowned pizza shop in Brooklyn. After having one of the best pizzas of all time at Little Isabella located in Baltimore, I was on the mission to find its companion in NYC. Overhyped as we suspected, Paulie Gee had nothing on Little Isabella! Perhaps, it was the quirky blend of sweet and savory flavors, but with that 2-hour wait, we surely did not have a pleasing experience.We ordered two pies: HellBoy and Greenpointer. HellBoy: Fresh Mozzarella, Italian Tomatoes, Berkshire Sopressata Piccante, Parmigiano Reggiano and Mike's HOT HoneyGreenpointer:Fresh Mozzarella, Baby Arugula, Olive Oil, Fresh Lemon Juice and Shaved Parmigiano ReggianoWe didn't really enjoy the sweetness of the honey in the HellBoy or the sourness of the lemon juice in the Greenpointer. Fresh, as we saw them make each pie to order, I definitely thought the doughiness of the pizza wasn't anything spectacular. In terms of service, I think it was pretty solid. Our waiter was patient and helpful. As a surprise, Paulie Gee himself introduced himself to just about every table, making it feel quite personable. In all, I definitely wouldn't return back to this pizzeria, especially with that crazy wait. During that 2-hour wait and 1.5-hour dining time, I can drive down to Baltimore and get some Little Isabella for half the price and no wait!",3.0
"3.5 stars for this pizza joint hidden behind a HUGE wooden door all the way down Franklin streetCrust was good with a nice char on the hellboy but the crust of the greenpoint pizza seemed a bit underdone We were quoted a 1.5 hour wait at 8pm for 3 on a Saturday but we were lucky that people in front of us hadn't returned so we were seated right away! (so don't be discouraged)---hellboy: everything was good about this except that spicy honey! Should of gone with a more classic margherita style pizza instead---greenpoint: fresh arugula, with a bit too much lemon juice, so nothing special NOTE: they don't have pepper flakes, only chili oil",4.0
"If you want great pizza and the right atmosphere look no further than Paulie Gee's. We sat at the bar (luckily) and avoided a two hour wait.  The pizza choices are numerous, with some very creative options. There were three of us and we started with two pies. Would have been content but it was so good we ordered a third.The texture. The crust. The toppings. Hard pressed to mention anything I didn't like. I love pizza and this place is right up there with the best. That includes many pizzerias throughout Italy.Paulie stopped by for a chat and he has a fantastic personality. Great stories and it is obvious that he loves what he does and holds him team to very high standards.He was also kind enough to give me an official Paulie Gee's pin and a limoncello. A very nice touch!Make sure you check out the pizza oven in the back. It's a small,cozy place so don't pass this place up in you are in NY.",5.0
I take my pizza very seriously. The vegan pizza is so good here that if they didn't tell you it was vegan you would have no clue. I had the pie with vegan sausage and shared a few others with friends. It was all out of this world. I can't wait to go back again.,5.0
"There's a LOT of really great pizza in NYC, that's nothing new. But combine amazing pizza with friendly, caring service and a killer ambiance, and Paulie Gee's has a leg up on a lot of the other heavy hitters. The wait can be crazy, but we came in on a Tuesday night and it was half empty. I guess the key is to come when there's post-blizzard sludge everywhere and no one else wants to go out. Paulie Gee was there as I'm told he usually is, weaving around the space with his cup of coffee and stopping at literally every table. For us, he offered to curate our pizza order and who were we to argue? Read on for what Paulie Gee himself recommends:- The Greenpointer: according to Paulie, basically like eating a salad due to the piles of fresh baby arugula on top. - The Mo Cheeks: My personal favorite of the meal. The pickled onions on there are a nice surprise, and give a nice kick to the rest of the ingredients. - The Monte Cristo: OK, so this is probably something I would never think to order myself, but I'm glad it came out for us because it's actually super tasty. It comes with Canadian bacon and a drizzle of maple syrup, which I know sounds weird but trust me (or rather, trust Paulie). - I didn't catch the name of the last pizza, but it was one of the best and after peeking at the menu again I think it might have been the Hellboy. It was piled high with the tastiest Berkshire Sopressata, and it was perfect with the side of Mike's hot honey (which you haven't tried on pizza you must immediately). They asked if we wanted a dessert pizza but at that point we were stuffed to the gills. It was one of the best New York pizza experiences I've had so far, and the service is what really puts them above and beyond. I'm going to run for vice-president of the Paulie Gee fanclub soon!",5.0
"Came here a few days ago with my friend after work. Very dark inside, took some time for my eyeballs to adjust lol. We started off with some beers and then went with the Hellboy which was AMAZING. The hot honey makes a difference! Then we went with a vegan pie since neither one of us was particularly full. We ordered one with spinach, sea salt and garlic on it (sorry don't remember the name!) It was OK, not that memorable. The standout is by far Hellboy, the crust for both pizzas was SUPER THIN, firm and didn't fall apart on me. We both liked it. I took off a star for the spinach pie being nothing special and that it's a bit on the pricey side. Overall, I think I'll be back to try the other pizzas on the menu!",4.0
"Maybe we came on an off night, but we didn't care too much about the pizza and it was definitely not the best we've had. My friend wanted to celebrate her belated birthday at Paulie Gee's and so we did. We ordered 3 pies (Greenpointer, Ricotta Be Kidding Me, and The Hometown Brisket). I think the Hometown Brisket was our favorite only because of the BBQ sauce. Other than that, there wasn't much brisket pieces on the pizza. Ricotta Be Kidding Me was okay. The Greenpointer was all greens so that balanced our meal a little bit. I hear people waiting for hours to get a seat here and right now I'm just wondering where all the hype went? We came when they were opening, so thank goodness we didn't wait on line for this...cause it wouldn't have been worth it. FYI: There's no sign outside that says ""Paulie Gee's"". You just have to look by the address number ""60"" in order to find this place. I actually walked passed it while we were trying to find it. Also, use your flash on your phones to read the menu. I really liked the rustic interior but it was literally pitch black in there.",3.0
"Zagat rated the hellboy as the best pizza in NYC. Wow! Big call Zagat... We had to try! We would say it was delicious... But I would have to say Marta is equal of not just ahead. We got here at 6:40 and had to wait over an hr to sit at the bar. When getting here service was prompt and food was great! We ordered the hellboy and the hellified porkpie white and I have to say it was fresh, full of flavor and great value. My only critique would be more hot suppressa on the hellified and take numbers at the door! It's a little unreasonable to ask people to wait 90 mins and not offer to call when table it ready. Either way it was great but probably won't be crossing the river to wait another 90 mins.",4.0

I would highly recommend this tactic to those of you who have been meaning to come and haven't been able to due to the wait -- the food will be worth it. We ordered the hellboy, ricotta be kidding me and the hot honey ice cream Sunday for dessert. The hellboy was our fave. It was basically a pepperoni pizza with hot honey lined under the cheese.

"My husband and I visited Paulie Gee's about two years ago and he still dreams of the Hellboy. This time we ordered the Hellboy and Cherry Jones.  The Hellboy was great but just a touch too sweet for me.  The hot honey adds a little kick but is definitely not too hot.  My husband will tell you it is the best pizza he has ever had (saying a lot since he was raised in the Bronx).  The Cherry Jones on the other hand was way too sweet for both of us.  I couldn't taste anything other then honey.  My husband embarrassed me by telling the waitress we didn't like it.  She offered us a replacement.  We ordered the Ricky Ricotta.  It was alright.  I was shocked because the ricotta was not warm.  The crust at Paulie Gee's is the perfect texture.  However, two of our three pizzas were too charred for my taste.  I must mention Paulie walks around all the tables to make sure everyone is enjoying.  Love it!  The restaurant is too dark and loud for my taste.",3.0

"Some of the best za in the city, bar none. The lady and I traveled far and wide for it since we'd heard such great things. It was a Friday night so the restaurant was predictably packed. There's not much in the form of a waiting area, which particularly sucked given how freezing the weather was, but we had a feeling the pie would be well worth the wait (plus we also got to watch a tipsy couple aggressively suck face up close and personal which was an unexpected but enjoyable twist).The vibe was cool, featuring low--lighting, a huge and beautiful custom brick oven, and trendy attractive people who's favorite bands you've never heard of.When we finally were seated I was stoked to see the menu offered a huge variety of pies with all sorts of niche toppings AND vegan options(I personally don't give two damns about veganism but they presented them in an unpretentious way so I was cool with it). We eventually decided to go with the Hell Boy and the Prokypineapple, both of which were amazing, and I'm looking forward to going back and further chowing my way down the menu.Go here.",5.0
"After a 2-hours wait on a weekend for a party of 2, we finally got a table at the renowned pizza shop in Brooklyn. After having one of the best pizzas of all time at Little Isabella located in Baltimore, I was on the mission to find its companion in NYC. Overhyped as we suspected, Paulie Gee had nothing on Little Isabella! Perhaps, it was the quirky blend of sweet and savory flavors, but with that 2-hour wait, we surely did not have a pleasing experience.We ordered two pies: HellBoy and Greenpointer. HellBoy: Fresh Mozzarella, Italian Tomatoes, Berkshire Sopressata Piccante, Parmigiano Reggiano and Mike's HOT HoneyGreenpointer:Fresh Mozzarella, Baby Arugula, Olive Oil, Fresh Lemon Juice and Shaved Parmigiano ReggianoWe didn't really enjoy the sweetness of the honey in the HellBoy or the sourness of the lemon juice in the Greenpointer. Fresh, as we saw them make each pie to order, I definitely thought the doughiness of the pizza wasn't anything spectacular. In terms of service, I think it was pretty solid. Our waiter was patient and helpful. As a surprise, Paulie Gee himself introduced himself to just about every table, making it feel quite personable. In all, I definitely wouldn't return back to this pizzeria, especially with that crazy wait. During that 2-hour wait and 1.5-hour dining time, I can drive down to Baltimore and get some Little Isabella for half the price and no wait!",3.0
"3.5 stars for this pizza joint hidden behind a HUGE wooden door all the way down Franklin streetCrust was good with a nice char on the hellboy but the crust of the greenpoint pizza seemed a bit underdone We were quoted a 1.5 hour wait at 8pm for 3 on a Saturday but we were lucky that people in front of us hadn't returned so we were seated right away! (so don't be discouraged)---hellboy: everything was good about this except that spicy honey! Should of gone with a more classic margherita style pizza instead---greenpoint: fresh arugula, with a bit too much lemon juice, so nothing special NOTE: they don't have pepper flakes, only chili oil",4.0
"If you want great pizza and the right atmosphere look no further than Paulie Gee's. We sat at the bar (luckily) and avoided a two hour wait.  The pizza choices are numerous, with some very creative options. There were three of us and we started with two pies. Would have been content but it was so good we ordered a third.The texture. The crust. The toppings. Hard pressed to mention anything I didn't like. I love pizza and this place is right up there with the best. That includes many pizzerias throughout Italy.Paulie stopped by for a chat and he has a fantastic personality. Great stories and it is obvious that he loves what he does and holds him team to very high standards.He was also kind enough to give me an official Paulie Gee's pin and a limoncello. A very nice touch!Make sure you check out the pizza oven in the back. It's a small,cozy place so don't pass this place up in you are in NY.",5.0
I take my pizza very seriously. The vegan pizza is so good here that if they didn't tell you it was vegan you would have no clue. I had the pie with vegan sausage and shared a few others with friends. It was all out of this world. I can't wait to go back again.,5.0
"There's a LOT of really great pizza in NYC, that's nothing new. But combine amazing pizza with friendly, caring service and a killer ambiance, and Paulie Gee's has a leg up on a lot of the other heavy hitters. The wait can be crazy, but we came in on a Tuesday night and it was half empty. I guess the key is to come when there's post-blizzard sludge everywhere and no one else wants to go out. Paulie Gee was there as I'm told he usually is, weaving around the space with his cup of coffee and stopping at literally every table. For us, he offered to curate our pizza order and who were we to argue? Read on for what Paulie Gee himself recommends:- The Greenpointer: according to Paulie, basically like eating a salad due to the piles of fresh baby arugula on top. - The Mo Cheeks: My personal favorite of the meal. The pickled onions on there are a nice surprise, and give a nice kick to the rest of the ingredients. - The Monte Cristo: OK, so this is probably something I would never think to order myself, but I'm glad it came out for us because it's actually super tasty. It comes with Canadian bacon and a drizzle of maple syrup, which I know sounds weird but trust me (or rather, trust Paulie). - I didn't catch the name of the last pizza, but it was one of the best and after peeking at the menu again I think it might have been the Hellboy. It was piled high with the tastiest Berkshire Sopressata, and it was perfect with the side of Mike's hot honey (which you haven't tried on pizza you must immediately). They asked if we wanted a dessert pizza but at that point we were stuffed to the gills. It was one of the best New York pizza experiences I've had so far, and the service is what really puts them above and beyond. I'm going to run for vice-president of the Paulie Gee fanclub soon!",5.0
"Came here a few days ago with my friend after work. Very dark inside, took some time for my eyeballs to adjust lol. We started off with some beers and then went with the Hellboy which was AMAZING. The hot honey makes a difference! Then we went with a vegan pie since neither one of us was particularly full. We ordered one with spinach, sea salt and garlic on it (sorry don't remember the name!) It was OK, not that memorable. The standout is by far Hellboy, the crust for both pizzas was SUPER THIN, firm and didn't fall apart on me. We both liked it. I took off a star for the spinach pie being nothing special and that it's a bit on the pricey side. Overall, I think I'll be back to try the other pizzas on the menu!",4.0
"Maybe we came on an off night, but we didn't care too much about the pizza and it was definitely not the best we've had. My friend wanted to celebrate her belated birthday at Paulie Gee's and so we did. We ordered 3 pies (Greenpointer, Ricotta Be Kidding Me, and The Hometown Brisket). I think the Hometown Brisket was our favorite only because of the BBQ sauce. Other than that, there wasn't much brisket pieces on the pizza. Ricotta Be Kidding Me was okay. The Greenpointer was all greens so that balanced our meal a little bit. I hear people waiting for hours to get a seat here and right now I'm just wondering where all the hype went? We came when they were opening, so thank goodness we didn't wait on line for this...cause it wouldn't have been worth it. FYI: There's no sign outside that says ""Paulie Gee's"". You just have to look by the address number ""60"" in order to find this place. I actually walked passed it while we were trying to find it. Also, use your flash on your phones to read the menu. I really liked the rustic interior but it was literally pitch black in there.",3.0
"Zagat rated the hellboy as the best pizza in NYC. Wow! Big call Zagat... We had to try! We would say it was delicious... But I would have to say Marta is equal of not just ahead. We got here at 6:40 and had to wait over an hr to sit at the bar. When getting here service was prompt and food was great! We ordered the hellboy and the hellified porkpie white and I have to say it was fresh, full of flavor and great value. My only critique would be more hot suppressa on the hellified and take numbers at the door! It's a little unreasonable to ask people to wait 90 mins and not offer to call when table it ready. Either way it was great but probably won't be crossing the river to wait another 90 mins.",4.0
"If there was ever a restaurant that inspires the need for #PiDay (3.14) to be everyday, it is Paulie Gee's. The pizza is a true art, and every bite is important, from the center to the crust crust.  PG is located in pizza heaven, or right near the water on Greenpoint Ave if you want a Google Map friendly address.Read it on my blog: highclasstohighlifes.com…As you'll see below I'm constantly on the proscuitt of happiness but this time we went for a different ham, Canadian bacon, and on the Monte Cristo. You bet it counted towards happiness. This pizza combines maple syrup drizzle and gouda with the ham. Yes, yes and more yes. Paulie asked if we had butter on the crust...sadly, no. SO MUCH REGRET....that I'll be back in no time to try it. You'll notice on the menu that they have a brisket pizza that features Hometown BBQ -- I love this local BK collaboration. You can get sauced the other way too with Greenpoint local brews!Anyway, I have nearly eaten my way through the entire menu (still need to do a bit of adventuring on the vegan side, every time I get close, I just want meat...) and I have been very pleased with every slice thus far. Therefore my advice to you is go with the pizza that's toppings are most appealing...or grab a handful of friends and share, then you can try multiple pizzas!The man, who is not a myth, but definitely a legend is often found inside checking in on tables, ensuring quality control and getting to know the patrons. He loved my last Instagram post that did a little play words...sharing that I was on the prosciutt of happiness with his King Henry Classic. He's always all smiles and usually wearing a great hat, he is Paulie Gee himself. Paulie Gee's - High Class to High Lifes If you really knead to get delivery or pickup, you'll have to look elsewhere for now though. The only way to leave Paulie Gee's with a to-go box is with leftovers. Rumor has it that a slice joint is opening up nearby though! I'm counting down the days, hours and minutes. Want to keep drooling? Read the menu!Pro Tip: Grab dinner at Paulie Gee's then walk straight out on the water in Greenpoint to Transmitter park or the outlook. Maybe even catch a sunset and BYO night cap!",5.0
"My old pal Carlos and I visited Paulie Gee's last night and had a great meal. I'm accustomed to going with the ol' vegan girlfriend and have a tradition where we split two pies from their extensive vegan selection, so we can try two different types of pies. The vegan and non-vegan selections are both extensive; each category has at least a half dozen kinds of pies, including oil bases, white slices, marinara, spinach-based, spicy honey and barbecue sauce foundations. The pies are aesthetically pleasing to every sense, well, every sense except sound. It's usually better when sound isn't a factor. At least when you're talking about food. When you're talking about music, sound is obviously a very important sense to talk about. I may go as far as to say that in a conversation about music, sound is the only sense that matters.I was excited to go with Carlos because I was going to get to eat their meat and actual cheese. The Paulie Gee's brisket is lean and delicious. Their pickled red onions possess a truly memorable tang and are worth spending a couple buck to add on to pretty much any pie. The ricotta dollops on the Ricky Ricotta feel more like bursts of a cream sauce than regular old cheese. Interestingly, the dairy and non-dairy ricotta cheeses are almost indecipherable in quality, which goes to show that Paulie Gee's knows what's up. Carlos and I were pleased to compliment the trad Italian flavors of the Ricky Ricotta with a tangy Barbecue Brisket pie. I'm psyched to go with a fellow omnivore again, because there are tons of other flavor combos I'm eager to try. New Yorkers, such as myself, are notorious for being dicks about the quality of pizza dough. It's the dough that invalidates the Chicago Deep Dish's false aspiration to pizza status. I can't stand Sicilian pizza either, which is a controversial take in Nueva York. Anyhow, no matter how well adorned a Paulie Gee's pie is, its base--the crust--is its most distinct and wonderful element. The crust is thin but springy, and always a little charred. It's pretty much naan bread, which is either a very luck coincidence or a visionary innovation. Naan bread, as you know, is lit, and, as it turns out, it is the perfect surface upon which various pizza ingredients should be placed and/or spread to mingle harmoniously.I've visited Paulie Gee's a number of times, and there's a bit of narrative that forms around my visits. The first time I tried to go, it was around noon, and my gf and I made the unpleasant discovery that Paulie Gee's does not open til 5 PM. The next time, we rolled up in a deep crew of six and had to wait about two to three hours for a table for six. If you find yourself in that position, you'll be okay though because there are plenty of bars around. There's also the water/skyline, mere yards away and a nice record store a block away.The gf and I have gone a few other times and it's always been great--except for the one time that a camera crew was shooting a special on Paulie Gee's vegan options. My girlfriend and I were in the shot all throughout our meal, and we were fighting (as subtly as possible) for the duration of our meal. I was taken aback and somewhat miffed when the producers of the show asked to do a talking head with us outside. The tension was palpable but they still insisted on interviewing us. I really do believe that you should foot the bill if you're going to interview someone for your television series or web series or gratuitously long Yelp review or whatever. At LEAST commission me to write a song for the soundtrack.In closing, I would like to offer a lil sum sum for the ladies. Are you interested in grandfatherly, charmingly blue collar, short men whose personalities closely resemble those of most Robert De Niro characters--but only in David O. Russel movies? If you do, and might want to be possibly hit on by a man of this caliber, you will love Paulie Gee's. At all times, Paulie Gee's eponymous Pizza Architect and Entrepreneur, Paulie Gee, stalks the narrow spaces between tables, checking in with customers--particularly of the reasonably attractive female demographic--and asks them how their food is, making small talk and thanking them for their patronage. I think this is cool. I would do the same if I were in his position, so don't take this the wrong way. Central to Paulie Gee's game is his ability to recommend a pizza place in seemingly every zip code on the planet and his inclination to tell you (the lady in question) the name of the dude who works there/owns the place, and to tell you (still the lady in question) to tell the dude (who owns the pizza place) to say that he (Paulie Gee) says hi. The Brotherhood of Pizza Mans is truly alive and well.",5.0

"I almost feel like it's blasphemy for not giving 5 stars. Finally made my way over here at Paulie Gees after way too long. Clearly this place is GPs staple so was excited to drop by on Wednesday night.There was no wait- very good. I had been worried about this so called 3x around 6:45pm to see how long it was before heading over. No one picked up and their answering service basically hangs up on you. I ordered the Daniela and he ordered the brisket pizza. Mine came out a good 7 minutes before his. I noticed immediately that about 40% of the crust was charred to the point of being inedible. To top that off, the spinach topping my pizza was the same. It was literally a black piece of ash and when I picked a leaf up or crumbled in my hands. The cheese blend was very good (mozzarella and Parmesan) but the pizza was just not good. To top it off, parts of the center were soggy and didn't hold the toppings when I grabbed a slice. When the brisket pizza came out a few minutes later I noticed immediately that it was cooked perfectly. The crust was edible and delicious. I was bummed that mine didn't come out this way especially since it seemed like a classic. All I can say is they probably put our orders in together and maybe his needed a little longer in the oven. Mine was most likely getting over cooked while his needed a few more minutes. Hence the gap in time between both of our orders coming out and the reason why mine was half done by the time his came out.I was really disappointed but the good thing to know is at least the brisket pizza was cooked well. I know there is a good meal at Paulie Gees but I feel like we were jipped.Also, great touch that Paulie himself came in to greet all the diners. He was super friendly and it brings a family quality to the place. This is maybe one of the main reasons I'd come back.",3.0

There's not much in the form of a waiting area, which particularly sucked given how freezing the weather was, but we had a feeling the pie would be well worth the wait (plus we also got to watch a tipsy couple aggressively suck face up close and personal which was an unexpected but enjoyable twist).The vibe was cool, featuring low--lighting, a huge and beautiful custom brick oven, and trendy attractive people who's favorite bands you've never heard of.When we finally were seated I was stoked to see the menu offered a huge variety of pies with all sorts of niche toppings AND vegan options(I personally don't give two damns about veganism but they presented them in an unpretentious way so I was cool with it). We eventually decided to go with the Hell Boy and the Prokypineapple, both of which were amazing, and I'm looking forward to going back and further chowing my way down the menu.Go here.",5.0
"After a 2-hours wait on a weekend for a party of 2, we finally got a table at the renowned pizza shop in Brooklyn. After having one of the best pizzas of all time at Little Isabella located in Baltimore, I was on the mission to find its companion in NYC. Overhyped as we suspected, Paulie Gee had nothing on Little Isabella! Perhaps, it was the quirky blend of sweet and savory flavors, but with that 2-hour wait, we surely did not have a pleasing experience.We ordered two pies: HellBoy and Greenpointer. HellBoy: Fresh Mozzarella, Italian Tomatoes, Berkshire Sopressata Piccante, Parmigiano Reggiano and Mike's HOT HoneyGreenpointer:Fresh Mozzarella, Baby Arugula, Olive Oil, Fresh Lemon Juice and Shaved Parmigiano ReggianoWe didn't really enjoy the sweetness of the honey in the HellBoy or the sourness of the lemon juice in the Greenpointer. Fresh, as we saw them make each pie to order, I definitely thought the doughiness of the pizza wasn't anything spectacular. In terms of service, I think it was pretty solid. Our waiter was patient and helpful. As a surprise, Paulie Gee himself introduced himself to just about every table, making it feel quite personable. In all, I definitely wouldn't return back to this pizzeria, especially with that crazy wait. During that 2-hour wait and 1.5-hour dining time, I can drive down to Baltimore and get some Little Isabella for half the price and no wait!",3.0
"3.5 stars for this pizza joint hidden behind a HUGE wooden door all the way down Franklin streetCrust was good with a nice char on the hellboy but the crust of the greenpoint pizza seemed a bit underdone We were quoted a 1.5 hour wait at 8pm for 3 on a Saturday but we were lucky that people in front of us hadn't returned so we were seated right away! (so don't be discouraged)---hellboy: everything was good about this except that spicy honey! Should of gone with a more classic margherita style pizza instead---greenpoint: fresh arugula, with a bit too much lemon juice, so nothing special NOTE: they don't have pepper flakes, only chili oil",4.0
"If you want great pizza and the right atmosphere look no further than Paulie Gee's. We sat at the bar (luckily) and avoided a two hour wait.  The pizza choices are numerous, with some very creative options. There were three of us and we started with two pies. Would have been content but it was so good we ordered a third.The texture. The crust. The toppings. Hard pressed to mention anything I didn't like. I love pizza and this place is right up there with the best. That includes many pizzerias throughout Italy.Paulie stopped by for a chat and he has a fantastic personality. Great stories and it is obvious that he loves what he does and holds him team to very high standards.He was also kind enough to give me an official Paulie Gee's pin and a limoncello. A very nice touch!Make sure you check out the pizza oven in the back. It's a small,cozy place so don't pass this place up in you are in NY.",5.0
I take my pizza very seriously. The vegan pizza is so good here that if they didn't tell you it was vegan you would have no clue. I had the pie with vegan sausage and shared a few others with friends. It was all out of this world. I can't wait to go back again.,5.0
"There's a LOT of really great pizza in NYC, that's nothing new. But combine amazing pizza with friendly, caring service and a killer ambiance, and Paulie Gee's has a leg up on a lot of the other heavy hitters. The wait can be crazy, but we came in on a Tuesday night and it was half empty. I guess the key is to come when there's post-blizzard sludge everywhere and no one else wants to go out. Paulie Gee was there as I'm told he usually is, weaving around the space with his cup of coffee and stopping at literally every table. For us, he offered to curate our pizza order and who were we to argue? Read on for what Paulie Gee himself recommends:- The Greenpointer: according to Paulie, basically like eating a salad due to the piles of fresh baby arugula on top. - The Mo Cheeks: My personal favorite of the meal. The pickled onions on there are a nice surprise, and give a nice kick to the rest of the ingredients. - The Monte Cristo: OK, so this is probably something I would never think to order myself, but I'm glad it came out for us because it's actually super tasty. It comes with Canadian bacon and a drizzle of maple syrup, which I know sounds weird but trust me (or rather, trust Paulie). - I didn't catch the name of the last pizza, but it was one of the best and after peeking at the menu again I think it might have been the Hellboy. It was piled high with the tastiest Berkshire Sopressata, and it was perfect with the side of Mike's hot honey (which you haven't tried on pizza you must immediately). They asked if we wanted a dessert pizza but at that point we were stuffed to the gills. It was one of the best New York pizza experiences I've had so far, and the service is what really puts them above and beyond. I'm going to run for vice-president of the Paulie Gee fanclub soon!",5.0
"Came here a few days ago with my friend after work. Very dark inside, took some time for my eyeballs to adjust lol. We started off with some beers and then went with the Hellboy which was AMAZING. The hot honey makes a difference! Then we went with a vegan pie since neither one of us was particularly full. We ordered one with spinach, sea salt and garlic on it (sorry don't remember the name!) It was OK, not that memorable. The standout is by far Hellboy, the crust for both pizzas was SUPER THIN, firm and didn't fall apart on me. We both liked it. I took off a star for the spinach pie being nothing special and that it's a bit on the pricey side. Overall, I think I'll be back to try the other pizzas on the menu!",4.0
"Maybe we came on an off night, but we didn't care too much about the pizza and it was definitely not the best we've had. My friend wanted to celebrate her belated birthday at Paulie Gee's and so we did. We ordered 3 pies (Greenpointer, Ricotta Be Kidding Me, and The Hometown Brisket). I think the Hometown Brisket was our favorite only because of the BBQ sauce. Other than that, there wasn't much brisket pieces on the pizza. Ricotta Be Kidding Me was okay. The Greenpointer was all greens so that balanced our meal a little bit. I hear people waiting for hours to get a seat here and right now I'm just wondering where all the hype went? We came when they were opening, so thank goodness we didn't wait on line for this...cause it wouldn't have been worth it. FYI: There's no sign outside that says ""Paulie Gee's"". You just have to look by the address number ""60"" in order to find this place. I actually walked passed it while we were trying to find it. Also, use your flash on your phones to read the menu. I really liked the rustic interior but it was literally pitch black in there.",3.0
"Zagat rated the hellboy as the best pizza in NYC. Wow! Big call Zagat... We had to try! We would say it was delicious... But I would have to say Marta is equal of not just ahead. We got here at 6:40 and had to wait over an hr to sit at the bar. When getting here service was prompt and food was great! We ordered the hellboy and the hellified porkpie white and I have to say it was fresh, full of flavor and great value. My only critique would be more hot suppressa on the hellified and take numbers at the door! It's a little unreasonable to ask people to wait 90 mins and not offer to call when table it ready. Either way it was great but probably won't be crossing the river to wait another 90 mins.",4.0
"If there was ever a restaurant that inspires the need for #PiDay (3.14) to be everyday, it is Paulie Gee's. The pizza is a true art, and every bite is important, from the center to the crust crust.  PG is located in pizza heaven, or right near the water on Greenpoint Ave if you want a Google Map friendly address.Read it on my blog: highclasstohighlifes.com…As you'll see below I'm constantly on the proscuitt of happiness but this time we went for a different ham, Canadian bacon, and on the Monte Cristo. You bet it counted towards happiness. This pizza combines maple syrup drizzle and gouda with the ham. Yes, yes and more yes. Paulie asked if we had butter on the crust...sadly, no. SO MUCH REGRET....that I'll be back in no time to try it. You'll notice on the menu that they have a brisket pizza that features Hometown BBQ -- I love this local BK collaboration. You can get sauced the other way too with Greenpoint local brews!Anyway, I have nearly eaten my way through the entire menu (still need to do a bit of adventuring on the vegan side, every time I get close, I just want meat...) and I have been very pleased with every slice thus far. Therefore my advice to you is go with the pizza that's toppings are most appealing...or grab a handful of friends and share, then you can try multiple pizzas!The man, who is not a myth, but definitely a legend is often found inside checking in on tables, ensuring quality control and getting to know the patrons. He loved my last Instagram post that did a little play words...sharing that I was on the prosciutt of happiness with his King Henry Classic. He's always all smiles and usually wearing a great hat, he is Paulie Gee himself. Paulie Gee's - High Class to High Lifes If you really knead to get delivery or pickup, you'll have to look elsewhere for now though. The only way to leave Paulie Gee's with a to-go box is with leftovers. Rumor has it that a slice joint is opening up nearby though! I'm counting down the days, hours and minutes. Want to keep drooling? Read the menu!Pro Tip: Grab dinner at Paulie Gee's then walk straight out on the water in Greenpoint to Transmitter park or the outlook. Maybe even catch a sunset and BYO night cap!",5.0
"My old pal Carlos and I visited Paulie Gee's last night and had a great meal. I'm accustomed to going with the ol' vegan girlfriend and have a tradition where we split two pies from their extensive vegan selection, so we can try two different types of pies. The vegan and non-vegan selections are both extensive; each category has at least a half dozen kinds of pies, including oil bases, white slices, marinara, spinach-based, spicy honey and barbecue sauce foundations. The pies are aesthetically pleasing to every sense, well, every sense except sound. It's usually better when sound isn't a factor. At least when you're talking about food. When you're talking about music, sound is obviously a very important sense to talk about. I may go as far as to say that in a conversation about music, sound is the only sense that matters.I was excited to go with Carlos because I was going to get to eat their meat and actual cheese. The Paulie Gee's brisket is lean and delicious. Their pickled red onions possess a truly memorable tang and are worth spending a couple buck to add on to pretty much any pie. The ricotta dollops on the Ricky Ricotta feel more like bursts of a cream sauce than regular old cheese. Interestingly, the dairy and non-dairy ricotta cheeses are almost indecipherable in quality, which goes to show that Paulie Gee's knows what's up. Carlos and I were pleased to compliment the trad Italian flavors of the Ricky Ricotta with a tangy Barbecue Brisket pie. I'm psyched to go with a fellow omnivore again, because there are tons of other flavor combos I'm eager to try. New Yorkers, such as myself, are notorious for being dicks about the quality of pizza dough. It's the dough that invalidates the Chicago Deep Dish's false aspiration to pizza status. I can't stand Sicilian pizza either, which is a controversial take in Nueva York. Anyhow, no matter how well adorned a Paulie Gee's pie is, its base--the crust--is its most distinct and wonderful element. The crust is thin but springy, and always a little charred. It's pretty much naan bread, which is either a very luck coincidence or a visionary innovation. Naan bread, as you know, is lit, and, as it turns out, it is the perfect surface upon which various pizza ingredients should be placed and/or spread to mingle harmoniously.I've visited Paulie Gee's a number of times, and there's a bit of narrative that forms around my visits. The first time I tried to go, it was around noon, and my gf and I made the unpleasant discovery that Paulie Gee's does not open til 5 PM. The next time, we rolled up in a deep crew of six and had to wait about two to three hours for a table for six. If you find yourself in that position, you'll be okay though because there are plenty of bars around. There's also the water/skyline, mere yards away and a nice record store a block away.The gf and I have gone a few other times and it's always been great--except for the one time that a camera crew was shooting a special on Paulie Gee's vegan options. My girlfriend and I were in the shot all throughout our meal, and we were fighting (as subtly as possible) for the duration of our meal. I was taken aback and somewhat miffed when the producers of the show asked to do a talking head with us outside. The tension was palpable but they still insisted on interviewing us. I really do believe that you should foot the bill if you're going to interview someone for your television series or web series or gratuitously long Yelp review or whatever. At LEAST commission me to write a song for the soundtrack.In closing, I would like to offer a lil sum sum for the ladies. Are you interested in grandfatherly, charmingly blue collar, short men whose personalities closely resemble those of most Robert De Niro characters--but only in David O. Russel movies? If you do, and might want to be possibly hit on by a man of this caliber, you will love Paulie Gee's. At all times, Paulie Gee's eponymous Pizza Architect and Entrepreneur, Paulie Gee, stalks the narrow spaces between tables, checking in with customers--particularly of the reasonably attractive female demographic--and asks them how their food is, making small talk and thanking them for their patronage. I think this is cool. I would do the same if I were in his position, so don't take this the wrong way. Central to Paulie Gee's game is his ability to recommend a pizza place in seemingly every zip code on the planet and his inclination to tell you (the lady in question) the name of the dude who works there/owns the place, and to tell you (still the lady in question) to tell the dude (who owns the pizza place) to say that he (Paulie Gee) says hi. The Brotherhood of Pizza Mans is truly alive and well.",5.0
I would eat this pizza off a friggin bathroom floor..well only the vegan ones..,4.0
"I almost feel like it's blasphemy for not giving 5 stars. Finally made my way over here at Paulie Gees after way too long. Clearly this place is GPs staple so was excited to drop by on Wednesday night.There was no wait- very good. I had been worried about this so called 3x around 6:45pm to see how long it was before heading over. No one picked up and their answering service basically hangs up on you. I ordered the Daniela and he ordered the brisket pizza. Mine came out a good 7 minutes before his. I noticed immediately that about 40% of the crust was charred to the point of being inedible. To top that off, the spinach topping my pizza was the same. It was literally a black piece of ash and when I picked a leaf up or crumbled in my hands. The cheese blend was very good (mozzarella and Parmesan) but the pizza was just not good. To top it off, parts of the center were soggy and didn't hold the toppings when I grabbed a slice. When the brisket pizza came out a few minutes later I noticed immediately that it was cooked perfectly. The crust was edible and delicious. I was bummed that mine didn't come out this way especially since it seemed like a classic. All I can say is they probably put our orders in together and maybe his needed a little longer in the oven. Mine was most likely getting over cooked while his needed a few more minutes. Hence the gap in time between both of our orders coming out and the reason why mine was half done by the time his came out.I was really disappointed but the good thing to know is at least the brisket pizza was cooked well. I know there is a good meal at Paulie Gees but I feel like we were jipped.Also, great touch that Paulie himself came in to greet all the diners. He was super friendly and it brings a family quality to the place. This is maybe one of the main reasons I'd come back.",3.0
