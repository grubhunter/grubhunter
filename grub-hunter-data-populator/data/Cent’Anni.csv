I'd been here for dinner before and had a great time. The rigatoni with meatballs and sausage was very tasty as were our appetizers.We made note of amazing lunch and happy hour specials and decided to come back to try it out.$10.95 for a large selection of sandwiches and pasta with a glass of house wine or draft beer. That's insane.All cocktails are $5 from 4-7 in the bar area as well which is equally as insane.Delicious food. Nice outdoor seating area. Can get a little loud inside but if your having drinks you won't really care.,5.0
"Adore this place! Usually you can't go wrong with any pasta combination! I especially love the wild boar sauce. Last December I had the most amazing beet ravioli and let me tell you I may be obsessed with beets. So I know a good beet dish when I eat one. Reversely I had the beet gnocchi a bit ago and I didn't care for it. I think it was the chicken that was prepared weirdly, a little dry. In any case I come here pretty often, usually for celebratory occasions. Staff is very nice and attentive!",4.0
"Simply delicious! I loved everything I tried. We had the calamari as our appetizer. It was so well seasoned and delicious. The specials for the night included a spinach tagliatelle shrimp Alfredo so I tried that and literally licked the bowl. The homemade Alfredo sauce was some of the best I've ever tried. My date had the rigatoni which was also great!The next time I go back, I'm getting dessert!",5.0
"Dropped in for an impromptu Valentine's Day brunch* and had a nice server but some really forgettable food. We started with the french toast (which was good, albeit inconsistent with some parts burnt & not enough fruit), and wished we stopped there. We also ordered the wild boar ragu tagliatelle (but were given the mediocre pappardelle instead**), potatoes with herbs (simple & good, but no herbs), and a solid eggs benedict.*We called before walking over and were promised no wait, but folks who arrived 20 minutes later were definitely waiting for tables, and those already in created a restroom bottleneck right near our table, which was unfortunate as it was also near the kitchen/pass.**The $2 supplements are coded oddly on the dinner menu, which you need to request explicitly at brunch if you're not near a chalkboard sign on the wall.",3.0
"I wish I could eat unlimited pasta without gaining weight so I could eat here every night. The homemade pasta here is just amazing. I've been here for a few fancy date nights, Valentine's day, and have brought my parents when they're in town- it never disappoints. First off, this place knows how to make a cocktail. I've tried quite a few of them and have never been disappointed. They bring out olive oil and bread with kalamata olives (my fav) while you sip your drinks and wait for your appetizers. The crostini appetizers are really great- each plate only has one but they're big enough to split. Definitely order a few to share. The homemade pasta is really the main event here. You can mix and match your pasta and sauce and I don't think a bad combo is possible. I've also had the salmon and a frittata for brunch- always satisfied with the food here. Aside from the food, the service is always great (and friendly!) and the ambiance is perfect for a date. Dim lighting, good music, and plenty of wine :) Sidenote: once we had a person with dietary restrictions in our party and they were so accommodating. Very much appreciated!",5.0
"Went here for Sunday brunch; very good food, decent prices, good drinks, and a really great cup of coffee - friendly service & staff. Waited about 15 minutes for a table to open up, but had a Bloody Mary at the bar in the meantime. I ordered the Norwegian Benedict. Its eggs Benedict on lox instead of Canadian bacon. The hollandaise sauce was delicious and definitely homemade. Came with a side of greens and I ordered a side of bacon. Highly recommend if you're an eggs Benedict lover and want a different take on it. The only thing I wasn't crazy about the sourdough toast it came on. It was good, but there's no other option. They don't seem to have anything but sourdough toast or baguettes, and sometimes you just don't want to eat that much bread. The tartine with peanut butter and Nutella is bomb. It comes out all melty and tastes like a peanut butter cup.",4.0
"When we started looking at apartments in this area, I remember passing by this place several times and wondering what it was. It's only taken us seven months to come here--talk about missed dining opportunities all this time!In lieu of cooking for ourselves, we came here for an early Christmas dinner. We didn't make a reservation for the Monday evening, but we had no problem getting seated in the rear of the restaurant. It's such a cozy place with the dim lighting and the brick walls. Our server was the sweetest, making small talk with us without being over the top.We ordered meatballs and garlic bread, and I ordered the rigatoni (which comes with more meatballs and italian sausage). YUM. I still dream about those meatballs. The pasta was so fresh and perfectly chewy. I had enough leftovers to bring for my lunch the next day (which was still just as good). I'm actually not really a sauce person, but I could not get enough of theirs! To crown the meal, we had the most decadent and generous serving of tiramisu.Walking home with our bellies full, I could not think of a better winter meal. Love this place.",5.0
The food and the prices here are great. The spaghetti al limone is so simple but I'm addicted. Only down side is it is nuts charging two dollars for a tiny thing of grated cheese when it's free when you sit down. That bothers me.,4.0
"This place has such quality Italian food, every time I come I feel so comfortable and at home. The candlelight ambiance of the place is quasi-romantic and very intimate but it really feels like a cozy living room. On a cold night, the inside is wonderful, on a warm summer night, the outdoor space in the back is fantastic.Do yourself a favor and order the fresh pasta. The butter and sage sauce with the spinach gnocchi is a win, the fungi sauce with the potato gnocchi is fantastic, and all the meat ragus (lamb, Grandma, and wild boar) with tagliatelle and pappardelle are delicious too. Seriously the fresh pasta is phenomenal: order it.We tried the fried calamari tonight too. The thin strips of calamari were delicious as was the marinara sauce.I've never disliked anything I've ordered here. The cocktails are solid and the wine list is tasty. Go, eat, and enjoy!!",5.0
"The lemon spaghetti is one of the best things I've ever had. I feel kind of silly saying that, but it's true. It's worth every one of those ten dollars.PS I'm not vegetarian.",5.0

"This place holds a special spot in my heart for one reason: Is lunch special. I was roaming around Franklin Avenue one afternoon and I noticed a sign outside advertising their lunch special, but I didn't know it would be as fabulous as it turned out to be: A meal PLUS a beer, for $10 altogether. That. Is. Insane. Really. I'm from the suburbs of Chicago, so I'm used to lower prices than New York has to offer already, but this REALLY blew my mind.The portions for lunch weren't small either -- I took home some of my lunch! What a great deal at a truly lovely restaurant. I've also gone here later at night for dinner, and enjoyed their delicious Lemon Spaghetti (forgive me if that's not the exact proper name! I still love it so much!). I really enjoy this place and I do recommend it if you're looking for some unique pasta and other filling dishes!",5.0
Order takeout via grub hub during the weekend. I ordered the penne alla vodka as well is a Nother dish that had rigatoni sausage and meatballs. The food was delivered super fast I would like to say with in 20 minutes. Keeping in mind it's only maybe at the most two blocks away. The food was an OK portion I would expect a little bit more but for the price it was good. This seasoning of the food could have been better had to add salt and pepper. Wouldn't mind going back to at least have some cocktails and more pasta.,4.0
"Great Italian spot.. Has mix and match pasta types (gnocchi, cavatelli, etc) with sauces like pesto, butter and sage, pomadoro and meat sauces.  Also has other main dishes.. Salmon, rosemary chicken... Everything was great. Happy hour has half off house cocktails at the bar.. Not sure what time it ends though, would definitely recommend this place",5.0

"Had brunch here the other day and was pleasantly surprised.  When you hear Crown Heights you don't really think of fine Italian food, but the handmade pasta and the boar ragu was amazing.  Very authentic and a classy modern vibe.  Recommend the outdoor patio now that the weather is getting nicer.",4.0
"I love the duck liver pate crostini!! #Life I love the Fresh Arugula salad, with shaved prosciutto and Parmesan!! The rustic bread that comes to each table is great!

"For the most part, this place is delicious.  I've had brunch here, ordering one of the benedicts and it was great.  Dinner is good too - avocado crostini, mashed potatoes, penne vodka is delicious, pomodoro sauce is so good... but I have an issue with the sourdough bread provided with all of the pasta dishes... I grew up on homemade italian food, and we always had regular italian bread; I'm just not into that sour taste with tomato sauce, which is acidic.  I've also found some of the flavors/sauces to be inconsistent.  The funghi sauce has been excellent at times, but other times I've received pappardelle with sprinklings of mushroom and no flavor.Overall, their classic dishes are really, really good.  And I would definitely recommend to a friend.",4.0
"Great neighborhood restaurant offering great deals on food and drinks. They make fresh pasta in house. The food is great. Lunch special includes pastas or.

"This is the best Italian place that I've had in a long time. Everything was delicious from the cocktails, to the bread and olive oil, to the apps, to the entree, to the dessert. So good that I'm going back this week before I head home to L.A.I ordered calamari and the penne with tomato and basil. The calamari was cooked perfectly but was a small portion for two.

"Cent'Anni has great ideas but shaky execution. 1. House made pasta is excellent idea but on two occasions I had pasta over cooked. If you specialize in pasta this shouldn't happen.

While some are good (lamb ragu and mushroom sauce) some others (pesto and grandma's ragu) are bland. Sometimes fresh pepper or cheese would have helped but it's offered inconsistently. (Actually only once was fresh ground pepper offered).They also seem a bit too conservative with the salt.3.I love the crostini they offer. White bean, pecorino and garlic and caponata are my favorites.I do wish instead of one large piece of bread the offered 2 or 3 smaller pieces. It's easier to share and easier to eat.I think the prices are fair, the service has always been friendly and the atmosphere is nice(maybe a little too dark ).I like it, but would like to love it.",3.0

While some are good (lamb ragu and mushroom sauce) some others (pesto and grandma's ragu) are bland. Sometimes fresh pepper or cheese would have helped but it's offered inconsistently. (Actually only once was fresh ground pepper offered).They also seem a bit too conservative with the salt.3.I love the crostini they offer. White bean, pecorino and garlic and caponata are my favorites.I do wish instead of one large piece of bread the offered 2 or 3 smaller pieces. It's easier to share and easier to eat.I think the prices are fair, the service has always been friendly and the atmosphere is nice(maybe a little too dark ).I like it, but would like to love it.",3.0
"I've been here twice. It's mediocre. I'm not very impressed by the food, or the wine. Which has left me not wanting to go back. Too much great Italian nearby to settle.",2.0
"To be fair, I have not yet tried the food. I'm here to comment solely on the bar.I like any cocktails with cucumber AND a bartender that allows me to create me own drinks :) Plus this place serves Peroni. Great diversity and atmosphere. It's my Sunday afternoon chill-out. Did I mention the great music playing overhead?",4.0
"I'd like to give this place four stars but it just falls short in a couple of areas.  The food is definitely four stars.  But for me the vibe doesn't cut it.  It's a beautiful restaurant, but most of the time it's too crowded for my comfort.  And the cocktails are a letdown compared to the food.  Also the beer selection is not great, especially considering what can be found all over Brooklyn these days.I still enjoy going here, but if they just stepped up their bar it would compensate for the crowded feel of the place.",3.0
"Pasta is to die for. Home made sauces and pasta. The atmosphere is great. I would come again, the only caveat was our server being slow at giving and getting the check.",4.0
"Perhaps brunch isn't their strong suit, but it was incredibly mediocre. Smoked salmon was meh, sourdough was meh. Bacon was the highlight. . . which is a pretty low bar since when is that not delish? Will return to try the ragu which seems to be their thing. Bartender was cool and attentive given they were slammed. Ambiance was cozy and a bit rustic. In a few words: edible like middle of the road diner breakfast.",2.0
I ate here a few time in the summer and definitely enjoyed the food and service. It authentic and very tasty. The service was great and the drinks matched the food. It a great date spot for you lovers out there also a good place for a first date for you puppy loves.,4.0
I absolutely love this place. The food has always been spot on and delicious.  The brunch is great. If its nice out definitely enjoy the outside patio.,5.0

"Me and my girlfriend dined here one Sunday and it was great! We loved the atmosphere of the backyard and the intimate setting.The whole set up is classy! We started with fried calamari for me of course - I am just a fried food person. My girlfriend who is on a HEALTHY ROAD had grilled calamari - it was good.I ordered the grilled pork chops with wild mushrooms  wine sauce with grilled julienne vegetables - DELICIOUS!My girlfriend started out with a fish special - she did not like - so the restaurant immediately switched it for her with no problems for the Salmon, pan seared with lemon, capers, sage, split string beans & extra virgin olive oil - She loved it!I also had the BABY SPINACH with crispy bacon, chickpeas & goat cheese - That was so DELICIOUS!AAAANNNNNNNNNNNND - Yes I had to have desert - let me tell it was good and straight to the point - ORGANIC ALL THE WAY!Happy Eating!",4.0

"I will start by saying that this WAS one of my favorite places to go. While the service is usually not great they do have a good happy hour ( only in the bat area). Last night my husband and I went in for happy hour and dinner. I arrived first and was told I had to wait for my other person before b only seated. That is reasonable. I expected that. So I took a seat at the bar and ordered a glad of wine. When my husband arrived we asked if we could be seated at a bar table, again happy hour is only in the bar! There where 2 of the 3 tables available. The hostess told us that we could not sit at the bar table unless we had 3 people. As I looked at the table in the bar that was sat I realized it only had 2 people at it. When I pointed that out to the hostess she told me ""that was earlier. Now you have to have 3 people."" She followed that up with "" I can ask my manager but he will still say no."" At that time I told her that we didn't want to stay and we would take our business somewhere else. I would have totally understood if it was busy and there where limited tables but this was not the case. In addition don't have a happy hour that is only available in the bar area of you will not seat parties less than 3 in the bar! Will NOT BE GOING BACK!",1.0
"Heard good things about this place in our neighborhood and finally went to check it out.  Since this place's specialty is fresh pasta, i ordered a pappardelle with ""grandma's ragu"" after I found out it was made with meatballs and sausage.  My wife ordered the pork chop.  For appetizers we had the steamed mussels and caesar kale salad.  The steamed mussels were OK - broth was a little bland but mussels themselves were tender.  The kale caesar was very good - their dressing is perfect.  The big problem came with the entrees.  My wife's pork chop was dry and over-cooked and her julienne vegetables were flabby and watery.  To be honest, the pasta was OK.  The pasta itself was pretty good and the ragu was fine, but nothing to write home about.  But I would think that if your pasta is supposed to be the star item of the restaurant, then it  should be better than a slightly above average experience.Service was ok and staff was friendly.  Won't be going back though.  There are places with similar prices and better prices in the neighborhood.",2.0
"This place has such delicious, reasonably-priced, fresh-made pasta dishes and free crusty bread with olives & olive oil. The spaghetti al limone is such stuff as dreams are made on; the al limone sauce is literal crack and I've never been less in control of myself than when eating it. Friendly service, too- the waiter hand-wrote 'thanks' on the receipt. The space is dark and candle-lit; sultry but cute and cozy vibes. Also they have tasty baked eggs options for brunch!  Love this place.",5.0

"In full disclosure, I am one of those people who does not like to go to Italian restaurants because, ""I can cook my own pasta, thank you."" But this place was a really nice treat.

Probably off-season?Butternut squash gnocchi in a sage/butter sauce: So good. Pillowy soft goodness. I wish there'd been the option to add some more shaved cheese on top, but I am a glutton.Spaghetti Al Aliola: SO GOOD. THE STAR OF MY MOUTH.

"I wish I could give this place a better rating, but like many other yelp reviewers we had terrible service. We went on a Sunday evening and I guess they weren't expecting so many patrons as they were totally understaffed. We were seated outside in the back, and ordered a bottle of wine which didn't come out until we were almost finished with our appetizer. We were done with our entrees for at least 10 minutes before we could flag the waitress down and see the dessert menu. And then at least 15 minutes went by and we couldn't get someone's attention to order dessert or get the check so we had to go inside and pay.I can understand that a restaurant can expect a slow Sunday evening and then get a mob of people and that can make it rough on the servers. It would have gone a long way for me to have the waitress or the host or someone come by and say that they were sorry about the slow service and they were doing their best. But instead we were ignored, like we weren't even there, no one dared make eye contact with us. On our way out we mentioned to the host that we loved the food but the service made it tough for us to want to come back. No apology. I guess he hears it all the time and is numb to it.",2.0

"I started writing this review a year ago (just never bothered to post it until now) when the place had just opened. Haven't been back since. Unfortunately, I experienced a level of disappointment that makes me kind of sad about what's happening on Franklin Avenue.  I've been in the area for 10 years, when there weren't many selections.  I'm always happy when new places pop up.  But when a million places pop up and you find the food disappointing, that's not good.  The atmosphere here is nice- the place was packed.  I was lured in because it's Italian and the board outside shows homemade pasta.  The service was a bit spotty (didn't get my wine until after we finished the bread that was served, the wine arrived with the appetizers), but that wasn't my main concern; the staff was nice and it was crowded.  What's more important is the food.  I went in there for homemade pasta.  I guess I was supposed to ask about it, or remember what was on the board outside, but I guess after walking 100 feet to the backyard, I ordered off the menu (which I don't believe included the homemade pasta).....The fried calamari was good.  We weren't impressed with the mussels.  The dish had a strong odor and the muscles were small.  At the end of the meal, I could still smell the odor of the mussels on my hands.  I wasn't happy.We ordered the Lasagna (I could tell that was homemade; we asked for something baked and that's why we got it, I didn't see it on the menu and it was $18.  I don't know how they came up with that price) and it was good.Overall, the prices aren't bad, but for what I got, the penne a la vodka with procuitto, I was DISAPPOINTED.  I could have boiled some Ronzoni for fifty cents and it would have been the same.  I searched for the procuitto and found a few little cubes that were very tough. The owner came over and asked if we liked the food, and I told him I was disappointed. Here's the kicker-he told us instead of coming there to eat on a Friday or Saturday night, When they're busy and understaffed, we should come on a Tuesday. He seriously told us we should eat there on a Tuesday. That's just ridiculous.",2.0
The food was a 4 stars out of 5. Food came out on time but was missing potatoes when we attempted to correct a waiter they thought we were confused about what came with the meal and didn't even check the menu to make sure. Once they figured they were wrong and that we were missing potatoes they got us a batch. I found that the service wasn't as welcoming as I would have liked hence the 3 stars.,3.0
"Dirty.  Mussels had a giant chunk of meat in them.  Don't know what kind of meat, but it looked chewed up, so I didn't eat the mussels.  Black kale salad with anchovy croutons is just green kale with regular croutons.  Pasta was cold, had been sitting too long and noodles were stuck together. Disappointed in a wasted 40$. Don't really know about this place, there aren't too many restaurants in the hood, but I'm starting to question the cleanliness of this place, as I've also found a hair in my pasta in the past.  That should have been it for me.  After this meat incident I'm definitely done. Also, the pappardelle and tagliatelle noodles are the same, not sure why they are advertised differently.",2.0

"Dirty.  Mussels had a giant chunk of meat in them.  Don't know what kind of meat, but it looked chewed up, so I didn't eat the mussels.  Black kale salad with anchovy croutons is just green kale with regular croutons.  Pasta was cold, had been sitting too long and noodles were stuck together. Disappointed in a wasted 40$. Don't really know about this place, there aren't too many restaurants in the hood, but I'm starting to question the cleanliness of this place, as I've also found a hair in my pasta in the past.  That should have been it for me.  After this meat incident I'm definitely done. Also, the pappardelle and tagliatelle noodles are the same, not sure why they are advertised differently.",2.0
"I love that they list their vegan options right on the menu. It made me feel like I wasn't being a pain in the ass to inquire about what my options were. I absolutely loved the side of garlicky kale, love the bread, and really enjoyed my gin cocktail. I've had the marinara sauce before, which is excellent, and I should have stayed with that last night. I ordered the arugula-pistachio pesto and it was incredibly bland. I was also disappointed in the noodles, as they were extremely chewy. Anyway, despite my lackluster pasta, everything else was excellent and I will of course return.",4.0
"Strolling down Franklin Ave. after a beautiful Sunday at The Brooklyn Museum, my Rockstar and I were in need of something to make our walk home a little more wavy. Walked into Cent'Anni Italian Restaurant and parked ourselves at the bar. Four Jameson shots and a few glasses of Peroni beer in, we were fans. Cool bartender who didn't rush us as we lingered and loved over our drinks and a jolly good crowd. We tried in vain not to stare at other customer's delicious looking dishes of pasta and calamari while vibing to Curtis and Marvin. Too bad we were too full from all day munching to try any of it.

"One of my favorite restaurants in my neighborhood, I've come here dozens of times.  And usually, everything is great.  Some of their things, however, just fall flat - and the thing that I have found is that if you want to ""add"" something to one of their dishes, it doesn't work well.  For example, the homemade pasta selection - you can often add a meat; every time I've tried to make my own creation and add chicken, the chicken has been poorly cooked. Also, I had a lasagna special on my last time in that was very underwhelming.On the other hand, the anchovie/lemon/spaghetti dish is consistently satisfying and fresh, and the black linguini is always delicious.  I'd stick to their offerings, not try to create your own, and ask your server for advice.  Great service, btw.  Free bread and olives/olive oil, lovely candlelit atmosphere.  One thing that I hate, but that hasn't kept me from going back, is that Cent'Anni is a restaurant with impossibly small two-tops.  My advice is to sit at the bar so you can be a bit more comfortable if on a date, or come with a group.",4.0

Cent'anni Italian food not quite at its finest a little tasteless......... Not the restaurant but the food waiter was nice and profesional knowledgeable about the menu and brought food on a timely fashion.

"This was one of favorite places to frequent on Franklin Ave and I used to rave about this place to my visiting friends and family. Unfortunately, there must have been a change in customer service, because today I left feeling frustrated and disgusted.I am embarrassed to have spoken so highly of this restaurant in the past. The table service was terribly slow, and when the food came out- they had replaced my order with a completely different dish. When I said, ""I think you may have the wrong order, I asked for the special pumpkin ravioli- not the spinach."" They answered ""Oh, sorry we're all out.""  OK- but why didn't you tell me in the hour wait we had while waiting for our food? ""Oh- I thought someone already told you."" Because it was early in the evening, there were only three other tables in entire restaurant- so really no excuse for not stopping over and asking me if there was another dish I'd like.At this point, everyone else had their food- they offered to bring the menu for another dish- but it was the callous and inexperienced response of the waiter that has left a bad taste in my mouth. While the food was ok- the service is lacking here- and really, everyone in the dinner party was disappointed. Cent'Anni for future order mistakes, offer to comp the appetizer or some other gesture of apology. The dinner order is the reason people go out to eat- plenty of other places get this right- or fix the service problem, we'll be going elsewhere for our pasta and wine.

I had recommended this place to quite a few friends and organized many dinners here, birthdays, etc. Overall I was very pleased. Over the last 6 months I have seen a dramatic change. The service is now terrible. I get that you are busy but ignoring your guests is not a good tactic. I can even forgive bad service if the food is amazing. However, the food is unreliable.

"I keep thinking restaurants in Brooklyn will be cheaper than restaurants in NY, but that's totally not the case. Regardless, had a great experience here. We got the tomatoes and basil tostini and the white beans tostini - both were excellent. Had the penne a la vodka as my main - delicious and a good portion. Only slightly annoying because I don't eat meat and asked if I could swap out prosciutto for vegetables, but they said I had to pay extra to swap (from meat to veggies....). We also had cocktails - don't remember what I drank but they were good.Would I schlep all the way to Brooklyn to eat here and pay Manhattan prices? Honestly, probably not.

"Restaurants keep popping up on Franklin, but Cent'Anni has claimed the title of my recent favorite. I've come twice since they opened--once with my boyfriend and again with a friend. The first time we sat outside and I enjoyed the black ink pasta and he the pork chop. My pasta was amazing--great sauce, great texture, and a huge portion. The pork chop was juicy and well seasoned. They also offer a list of homemade pastas and sauces that you can mix and match. The outside space is crazy big and covered in hanging white lights--perfect for a summertime date.My second time I sat at the bar and had the spaghetti with lemon sauce and many glasses of red wine. You can tell the pasta is homemade--it tastes so fresh. I enjoyed this dish as much as the first and didn't leave any leftovers. The wine list is impressive and includes some well priced by the glass choices. Vibe from the staff is professional and friendly. Both times I visited there was a good amount of people dining and having a good time. I can see Cent'Anni becoming a neighborhood favorite--just the right mix of fancy and laidback.",4.0
"I visited Cent'Anni shortly after it opened. I like many others was excited to see a new restaurant being added to the lineup of Franklin Avenue. I entered on a Friday evening to be greeted by what may be the nicest hostess ever, told that we'd need to wait a few minutes to be seated as it was a packed rainy night (so the backyard wasn't being used). No problem, my friend and I hung out at the bar and ordered a drink before being shown to our seat. So far, so good, but that was the end of the honeymoon. Being seated is cool, unless you don't see a waitress for 20 minutes. Can I get some water maybe? Thinking that maybe it was us, we started chatting with the couple that was seated closely to us and had been waiting for 20 minutes to pay the bill. We must have been hungry or desperate or riding off the high of the bustling restaurant and great service before coming to the table. In retrospect, we should have left immediately. After having my eye contact avoided by several staff members and finally flagging down a waitress, our neighbors were able to pay their bill and we placed an order....no specials were read or effort made, but we placed an order. A this point I'd say 30 minutes had passed. In an attempt to redeem the situation, the waitress did offer us a drink, which was an appreciated step. The food finally arrives. I had gnocchi and lamb sauce. It was bland and lacked character. I was beyond disappointed. I was not offered pepper for my food though i saw the bottles lined up by the kitchen. The funny thing is while we were sitting there, the hostess approached a couple to let them know that their table was needed (I guess they were seemingly lingering)....the couple's response was priceless....we'd like to give up the table, but the waitress never gave us the check. The outdoor area looks nice, but I don't have plans to return anytime soon. There are just too many alternatives to pay to be ignored and to eat bland food.",2.0
"I've never been here for brunch but have come here for dinner several times. Their house made pasta is delicious and the service is always great.

"Mmm, tasty tasty.  Echoing the love for this place.  Had the ravioli with Grandma's Ragu sauce and guzzled it down like there was no tomorrow.  Lovely atmosphere, great service, and delicious food - what more could you ask for? Oh that's right - lemon ice, a cocktail with limoncello.  Divine stuff.Only downside is that it gets pretty crowded, but it's worth it, and the maitre d' was kind enough to come outside a few times to let us know she hadn't forgotten about us, which was a nice touch.  And sure enough, the meal was well worth the wait.  Even something simple like the bread and olives and oil before the meal tasted delicious - probably because the bread, like the pasta, was freshly made.They have a lovely patio area in the back that was unfortunately rented out for a private party, but we'll probably visit it this summer when we return to experience more of the menu - you can bet that we'll be back!",5.0

"Eating first with your eyes means that things like decor and plating matter.  Centanni scores big in those areas!  From the antique lights and open bar area in the front to the big strung up lights in the back yard, everything is super rustic and cute.  The food is classic Sicilian edited for the American pallet.  They have crustinis and salads and main dishes but I think the real draw of Centanni is the pasta.  All the noodles and sauces are made in-house!  They list the pastas and the sauces separately so you can mix-and-match to your heart's desire.  Last night, we tried the wild boar ragu with tagliatelle ($16).  Like a Campbell's commercial:  Mmm Mmm Good!Also ordered was the Burrata special which came on a bed of juicy beefsteak tomatoes drizzled with balsamic.  Kinda pricy at $16 but totally worth it because it was a big mofo burrata that's flown in from Italy.  Not available everyday so jump on it if you get the chance!Slightly less successful, though still super tasty, was the Branzino special ($22).  A huge dish with mussels, calimari, and salmon in a tomato sauce.  I just really hate when there are bones and scales (because I'm a lazy eater) but I understand it comes with the territory.  The service was very attentive, though slightly confusing since we had 2 waiters that both came over to read us the specials. The food also came out a bit slowly but totally understandable since they just opened 3 days ago so I'm cutting them some slack.Welcome to the neighborhood guys!  Can't wait to try that butternut squash gnocchi!",4.0
"We just finished brunch here for a friend's birthday. The food was great and the drinks were cheap. Our server was very sweet and trying hard but she seemed overwhelmed.

"I keep thinking restaurants in Brooklyn will be cheaper than restaurants in NY, but that's totally not the case. Regardless, had a great experience here. We got the tomatoes and basil tostini and the white beans tostini - both were excellent. Had the penne a la vodka as my main - delicious and a good portion. Only slightly annoying because I don't eat meat and asked if I could swap out prosciutto for vegetables, but they said I had to pay extra to swap (from meat to veggies....). We also had cocktails - don't remember what I drank but they were good.Would I schlep all the way to Brooklyn to eat here and pay Manhattan prices? Honestly, probably not. But if I'm ever in the area again (unlikely), then it's worth a visit.",4.0
"Restaurants keep popping up on Franklin, but Cent'Anni has claimed the title of my recent favorite. I've come twice since they opened--once with my boyfriend and again with a friend. The first time we sat outside and I enjoyed the black ink pasta and he the pork chop. My pasta was amazing--great sauce, great texture, and a huge portion. The pork chop was juicy and well seasoned. They also offer a list of homemade pastas and sauces that you can mix and match. The outside space is crazy big and covered in hanging white lights--perfect for a summertime date.My second time I sat at the bar and had the spaghetti with lemon sauce and many glasses of red wine. You can tell the pasta is homemade--it tastes so fresh. I enjoyed this dish as much as the first and didn't leave any leftovers. The wine list is impressive and includes some well priced by the glass choices. Vibe from the staff is professional and friendly. Both times I visited there was a good amount of people dining and having a good time. I can see Cent'Anni becoming a neighborhood favorite--just the right mix of fancy and laidback.",4.0
"I visited Cent'Anni shortly after it opened. I like many others was excited to see a new restaurant being added to the lineup of Franklin Avenue. I entered on a Friday evening to be greeted by what may be the nicest hostess ever, told that we'd need to wait a few minutes to be seated as it was a packed rainy night (so the backyard wasn't being used). No problem, my friend and I hung out at the bar and ordered a drink before being shown to our seat. So far, so good, but that was the end of the honeymoon. Being seated is cool, unless you don't see a waitress for 20 minutes. Can I get some water maybe? Thinking that maybe it was us, we started chatting with the couple that was seated closely to us and had been waiting for 20 minutes to pay the bill. We must have been hungry or desperate or riding off the high of the bustling restaurant and great service before coming to the table. In retrospect, we should have left immediately. After having my eye contact avoided by several staff members and finally flagging down a waitress, our neighbors were able to pay their bill and we placed an order....no specials were read or effort made, but we placed an order. A this point I'd say 30 minutes had passed. In an attempt to redeem the situation, the waitress did offer us a drink, which was an appreciated step. The food finally arrives. I had gnocchi and lamb sauce. It was bland and lacked character. I was beyond disappointed. I was not offered pepper for my food though i saw the bottles lined up by the kitchen. The funny thing is while we were sitting there, the hostess approached a couple to let them know that their table was needed (I guess they were seemingly lingering)....the couple's response was priceless....we'd like to give up the table, but the waitress never gave us the check. The outdoor area looks nice, but I don't have plans to return anytime soon. There are just too many alternatives to pay to be ignored and to eat bland food.",2.0
"I've never been here for brunch but have come here for dinner several times. Their house made pasta is delicious and the service is always great. Also, while they don't always have it, the chocolate covered strawberries with gelato are probably my most favorite dessert. If you come here for dinner and they happen to have them as their 'dessert of the day', you should definitely give them a try!",5.0
"Mmm, tasty tasty.  Echoing the love for this place.  Had the ravioli with Grandma's Ragu sauce and guzzled it down like there was no tomorrow.  Lovely atmosphere, great service, and delicious food - what more could you ask for? Oh that's right - lemon ice, a cocktail with limoncello.  Divine stuff.Only downside is that it gets pretty crowded, but it's worth it, and the maitre d' was kind enough to come outside a few times to let us know she hadn't forgotten about us, which was a nice touch.  And sure enough, the meal was well worth the wait.  Even something simple like the bread and olives and oil before the meal tasted delicious - probably because the bread, like the pasta, was freshly made.They have a lovely patio area in the back that was unfortunately rented out for a private party, but we'll probably visit it this summer when we return to experience more of the menu - you can bet that we'll be back!",5.0

"Eating first with your eyes means that things like decor and plating matter.  Centanni scores big in those areas!  From the antique lights and open bar area in the front to the big strung up lights in the back yard, everything is super rustic and cute.  The food is classic Sicilian edited for the American pallet.  They have crustinis and salads and main dishes but I think the real draw of Centanni is the pasta.  All the noodles and sauces are made in-house!  They list the pastas and the sauces separately so you can mix-and-match to your heart's desire.  Last night, we tried the wild boar ragu with tagliatelle ($16).  Like a Campbell's commercial:  Mmm Mmm Good!Also ordered was the Burrata special which came on a bed of juicy beefsteak tomatoes drizzled with balsamic.  Kinda pricy at $16 but totally worth it because it was a big mofo burrata that's flown in from Italy.  Not available everyday so jump on it if you get the chance!Slightly less successful, though still super tasty, was the Branzino special ($22).  A huge dish with mussels, calimari, and salmon in a tomato sauce.  I just really hate when there are bones and scales (because I'm a lazy eater) but I understand it comes with the territory.  The service was very attentive, though slightly confusing since we had 2 waiters that both came over to read us the specials. The food also came out a bit slowly but totally understandable since they just opened 3 days ago so I'm cutting them some slack.Welcome to the neighborhood guys!  Can't wait to try that butternut squash gnocchi!",4.0

"I have worked in the food industry for ten years. This is my first yelp review after years as an avid restaurant diner, hospitality employee and application user.

"If I could give 0 stars I would. I have been ordering/going here at least 2x a week for about a year. After receiving a cold meal to the point where the sauce was congealed, I called to ask for them to either send a hot dish or refund the dish. The manager I spoke with (Lisa?) told me that they just can't deliver a hot meal in the cold even 3 blocks away and to either come and pick up my food or recook it myself. When I order a meal and pay the same price I pay in the restaurant, I expect to receive at least a warm meal and the same treatment a customer should receive in the restaurant. As a customer, I do not expect to be told to recook my food or to be yelled at when a complaint is made.

I'm not even forming sentences. Franklin Ave has a few killer kale salads going for it, and the kale Caesar here is one of them. Sometimes overdressed, but the kale stands up to it. The slow cooked tomato based sauces here are delicious, but I tend to return for the butter/sage and the lemon sauce. Lip-smacking good. Finally, never underestimate a good tiramisu. I know it can be hard to save room for dessert (the portions are so generous here that I usually split my pasta), but it is cheap and huge and so well done. I know it won't be easy, but I have faith in you.",4.0
"In what universe is this restaurant deserving of four stars? Certainly not the one in which we find ourselves.This is yet another Franklin Avenue establishment that prepares mediocre food at unreasonably inflated prices and, by some miracle, manages to maintain a client base. Of course, such a scathing review needs to be grounded in a first-hand account and so that is what I will present to you, discerning Yelper.-Service: The service on the evening in question was lacking, to put it mildly. I am not certain whether the staff member was in a drug-addled state or whether she is generally clueless about customer service and Italian food, but this woman served one thing in abundance -- attitude. Everything came with an extra serving of ""huff and puff"", though she was kind enough to always stop by and ask whether the food was okay approximately three seconds after the plate was dropped. ""No, it's shit."" But before we could say anything, she was storming off in a most impressive fashion.-Food: Mediocre to bad. The calamari was rubbery. I had the ""fresh"" pasta with mushroom sauce which tasted like one of those microwavable dishes you buy from Trader Joe's, except this version cost four times the price. The best thing we ate was the fennel salad (very little to destroy in this dish).-Ambiance: An equal mix of plaid-laden natives and bros from god-knows-where. While this place has the, now overplayed, ""Brooklyn"" aesthetic that is typical of everywhere in the borough, there is nothing particularly charming about the place.Conclusion: If you are going to go out for pasta, places like Frankies 457 serve delicious pasta that you would be hard-pressed to replicate at home; such a place is worth the schlepp to charming Carroll Gardens. However, Cent'Anni produces lackluster fare that, regardless of whether the pasta is freshly made or not, is poorly executed. With my very limited cooking skills, I am still able to boil a box of pasta and have produced many superior meals at considerably less cost than this Italian place.",2.0

Perfect portions I can't explain how amazing it was I can't wait to come back and try more. This place is a gem. Backyard seating was so cute. An overall amazing experience! Our waiter with the man bun was great don't know his name .,5.0
"If I could give 0 stars I would. I have been ordering/going here at least 2x a week for about a year. After receiving a cold meal to the point where the sauce was congealed, I called to ask for them to either send a hot dish or refund the dish. The manager I spoke with (Lisa?) told me that they just can't deliver a hot meal in the cold even 3 blocks away and to either come and pick up my food or recook it myself. When I order a meal and pay the same price I pay in the restaurant, I expect to receive at least a warm meal and the same treatment a customer should receive in the restaurant. As a customer, I do not expect to be told to recook my food or to be yelled at when a complaint is made. This place used to be great, but obviously they cannot do delivery as the manager claimed and they do not value loyal customers. I can absolutely say I will not be ordering from Cent'Anni nor will I be eating in the restaurant. What a disappointment.",1.0
"I love this place. It is my go-to pasta joint, and not just in Crown Heights. Friendly, helpful service. Fresh pasta and sauce. Great for accommodating groups. Small but varied wine list. I'm not even forming sentences. Franklin Ave has a few killer kale salads going for it, and the kale Caesar here is one of them. Sometimes overdressed, but the kale stands up to it. The slow cooked tomato based sauces here are delicious, but I tend to return for the butter/sage and the lemon sauce. Lip-smacking good. Finally, never underestimate a good tiramisu. I know it can be hard to save room for dessert (the portions are so generous here that I usually split my pasta), but it is cheap and huge and so well done. I know it won't be easy, but I have faith in you.",4.0
"In what universe is this restaurant deserving of four stars? Certainly not the one in which we find ourselves.This is yet another Franklin Avenue establishment that prepares mediocre food at unreasonably inflated prices and, by some miracle, manages to maintain a client base. Of course, such a scathing review needs to be grounded in a first-hand account and so that is what I will present to you, discerning Yelper.-Service: The service on the evening in question was lacking, to put it mildly. I am not certain whether the staff member was in a drug-addled state or whether she is generally clueless about customer service and Italian food, but this woman served one thing in abundance -- attitude. Everything came with an extra serving of ""huff and puff"", though she was kind enough to always stop by and ask whether the food was okay approximately three seconds after the plate was dropped. ""No, it's shit."" But before we could say anything, she was storming off in a most impressive fashion.-Food: Mediocre to bad. The calamari was rubbery. I had the ""fresh"" pasta with mushroom sauce which tasted like one of those microwavable dishes you buy from Trader Joe's, except this version cost four times the price. The best thing we ate was the fennel salad (very little to destroy in this dish).-Ambiance: An equal mix of plaid-laden natives and bros from god-knows-where. While this place has the, now overplayed, ""Brooklyn"" aesthetic that is typical of everywhere in the borough, there is nothing particularly charming about the place.Conclusion: If you are going to go out for pasta, places like Frankies 457 serve delicious pasta that you would be hard-pressed to replicate at home; such a place is worth the schlepp to charming Carroll Gardens. However, Cent'Anni produces lackluster fare that, regardless of whether the pasta is freshly made or not, is poorly executed. With my very limited cooking skills, I am still able to boil a box of pasta and have produced many superior meals at considerably less cost than this Italian place.",2.0

"My bf and I walked past this place and ended up coming back when the bar/restaurant we wanted to go to was packed. We were promptly seated. The host (or manager?) explained to us about their large chalk board - specials on the bottom and a list on the 2nd half of the different types of pasta we can choose from (gnocchi, spinach gnocchi, etc) and the different sauces (grandma's ragu, etc). Bread and olive oil was dropped off at the table while we perused the menu. Grandma's ragu sounded really good and the sauce included mini meatballs and italian sausage. My bf ordered it with the taratolpappardellewhile I ordered it with gnocchi. When it came, we were really glad we didn't order appetizers since the portion was huge. My bf was surprised he was able to finish his while I had enough for lunch the very next day, which it was still really good the day after. We ordered dessert - we did have the choice among different gelatos, sorbets, tiramasu, panna cotta, and the chocolate cake. We ended up getting the chocolate cake with the molten middle with vanilla gelato topped with berries. It was really good and only $6. For our two pasta entrees, my bf's two beers and our dessert, it came out to $54 with tax which wasn't bad. Ambience was great, with candles everywhere and an open kitchen.",4.0
"Great addition to the new Franklin Ave phenomenon.  We were on our way to Chavela's for brunch but decided to give Cent'Anni a try last minute.  The brunch was delicious.  We both ordered the Eggs Ragu (for $9), which was simple and wonderful. Others in the party got Eggs Norwegian and French Toast.  They also thought the food tasted very good.  The portions aren't large, but given the single-digit price point, it is perfectly fair.  We followed the main dishes with Panna Cotta, Warm Chocolate Cake & Fruit Dish.  The chocolate cake, which came with vanilla gelato, was a 10 out of 10.  The only criticism I have is that there isn't drip, bottomless coffee to accompany the brunch.  For NYC brunch scene that's actually not very acceptable.... When we were there on a Saturday, our waitress seemed a little overwhelmed.  It looked like she was the only one working all the tables; the runner had to help out with her workload sometimes.  There was a hostess (?) with big hair who looked like she had a lot of time on her hands and could help out. But she only wondered around the restaurant, not doing much.  I don't blame the poor waitress, but I think the service could be quicker.We're very excited about this neighborhood Italian with homemade pasta.  Will definitely be back very soon to try dinner.",4.0
"This place is very charming; candlelit, chalkboards, lots of earthy tones and a very warm atmosphere that just begs lovers to huddle and cuddle over distressed wooden tables. I came here for an early dinner, at about 6pm on a Saturday and was seated right away, although there were plenty of people in the place.We were seated in what might be considered the worst table, kind of in the middle of the place, adjacent to the open kitchen, honestly I didn't mind it at all. My companion and I ordered a bottle of Lambrusco (I think $36) which was divine and came with the cork and taste presentation. The wine bottles were all pretty reasonable prices with a good selection around $35, and their cocktails were in the $10 range. We ordered the fried calamari, and although it was just a touch over cooked, the batter was very light and super pleasant. They also include the tentacles, which I LOVE, and a side of marinara which was delish. I got the handmade parpardelle with lamb ragu and it was very tasty, my companion had the penne a la vodka and wasn't complaining!EVERYTHING needed salt, however. I think this is what is causing other reviews to comment on lack of taste. I do appreciate them under-salting, however, since Italian food, and fried dishes can be heavy handed. So I liked being able to control the salinity of my dishes. But the salt shaker was itty bitty teeny tiny, about the size of a single die (as in, one of two dice) and I spent a lot of time shaking it trying to get it out. For desert, warm chocolate cake and a 5 star tiramisu rounded out our perfect tab.

I had the rigatoni and prosciutto salad.  The grandma's ragu is amazing and the tiramisu was epic! The back patio has a great atmosphere, perfect for a summer night.

"This is my go-to restaurant for friends visiting, and special occasions.  The food is SO GOOD.  The wild boar ragu is to die for.  The atmosphere is great, super romantic and cozy.  I only wish they would do lunch specials with smaller portions so I could eat there ALL the time!",5.0
Me and my girlfriend came here the other day and sat on the backyard patio. The server was very nice and sweet. We ordered the grilled calamari which was good and then ordered a salad each and the sauted kale and garlic side. The salads were going down nicely until I noticed a green caterpillar in my kale plate. They took the dish away and asked if I wanted anything else but I didn't order anything. They offered us a free dessert and we made our way out.,3.0
Sometimes there seems to be a lack of communication among the staff. Those who seem to be managers are unfriendly but most servers are nice. Happy hour only in bar area is a huge mistake on their part. Food is pretty good.,3.0

"Adorable little restaurant on Franklin with polite bartenders and quality ingredients. Perfect place for a date, as it is dark, cozy and intimate (by the bar, it's brighter in the dining area). My friend and I were roped in by either the manager or owner who was extremely nice and spoke quite passionately about the food and specials of the day.Prices are average and the portions are in line with the price.",5.0
Went here for the first time since it opened with a client.  I had the rigatoni with meatballs and italian sausage and my client had black linguini and shaved fennel salad.  Both dishes were great.  Front door guy was friendly and helpful (we had our food to go) and I will definitely be taking more clients here to eat.,5.0
"Brunch is yummy, outdoor area is wonderfully set up, and it was the perfect day for the combo.   I enjoyed the granola and yogurt.   The only issue that I had which caught me off guard was that you had to pay for each cup of coffee.  This is definitely not common amongst their category in the area.   This is not a deal breaker for me, as I should only be drinking so much, but I thought it was weird.",3.0
"Don't get me wrong - I appreciate what this place is trying to do - nice bar, cool, kinda hip atmosphere, but the food is sadly mediocre.Been twice and the salads were a bit overdressed, and the pasta was a touch overcooked.",3.0
Outdoor seating: very nice + comfy seats. App: Kale Salad was very good. Main:Roasted Rosemary Chicken was bland. The chicken was dry. Looked like it had been sitting around and started to harden.

"Tried Cent'Anni on a Wednesday night around 7:00.  The restaurant was delightfully buzzing.  We ordered the fried calamari (perfectly crisp) and some cockails.  I am getting used to paying $10 for a specialty cocktail, so no surprises there.  They weren't super crazy innovative, but very delicious.  We sampled the gin, the bourbon, and the jalapeño tequila cocktails.  Our entrees arrived very fast.  My husband and I split the squid ink pasta dish and the wild boar ragu.  I thought both sauces were above par, with slightly different flavor than other places, which I can appreciate.   I'm no expert in Silician soul food, so I cannot attest to its authenticity.

"Was quite disappointed after a great review from friends.  They were able to seat us right away, great.  We had a server quite quickly after we sat down, great.  She explained that we could customize a pasta if we wished, cool .  She came back to take our drink orders, and 10 minutes later we received, and ordered.  My fiance asked her opinion between two dishes and she explained that we should get the special because they never have it.  Not really a great recommendation since we've never been, but fine.  We went with the choice on the menu (gnocchi with lamb ragu).  We ordered a spinach salad (with goat cheese and chickpeas and bacon) and veal meatballs for appetizers.  They brought the meatballs out first - an interesting decision after waiting 20 more minutes - and then the salad five minutes later.  The meatballs were fine and plentiful, but the sauce was sweet and not as hearty as I am used to having with such a dish.  The salad was fine - generous amounts of goat cheese and bacon - but we were still confused why it took so long. The mains of gnocchi and salmon were just okay as well.  The gnocchi was not as 'melt in your mouth' as we've had in many local restaurants and the base of this sauce was very much like that of the veal - sweet and unsubstantial.  I had the salmon which was cooked nicely, but the side of string beans were drenched in the olive oil 'sauce' that accompanied it - a bit much.  The kicker for us was that we ordered another round of drinks between apps/mains and they never came.  Our waitress even came back after ten minutes of taking this drink order, still before we received our mains, to tell us the drinks would be right out.  We proceeded to eat our entire meal sans drinks.  She finally came with the tray of our drinks (wine and an open beer bottle) and I kindly gave her the ""I don't think we need those anymore"" line.  The worst part was, she didn't apologize and leave the drinks with us at no charge, she literally said ""oh I'm sorry"" and took them back to .... the drain???  I'm not sure I know of a waiter or waitress who wouldn't just give someone the drinks they already poured and will now be wasted after waiting for them for 30 minutes.  Huge serving faux pas. But alas, this wasn't our main qualm - it was just that the food was average.  Because of its proximity to Bar Corvo (where the food is 100% better) we will not be back.",2.0
"Delicious food! Honestly the pasta isn't the best part, even though it takes up such a large area of the menu. I would recommend the fennel as a starter for sure! Great place for a date, delicious food and super friendly owner.",4.0
"This place is relatively new to the neighborhood. Franklin Ave has been inundated with new restaurants over the last couple years. Cent Anni is a welcome addition. Great wine selection and really good food that has somewhat of home cooked quality. Between us we got the gnocchi with ragu sauce, penne with spinach and vodka sauce, and the white bean crustini with pecorino and garlic. Everything was very good. The Ragu sauce could've been a little more savory. I tried my partners penne and it was very good. It was supposed to come with prosciutto and he subbed it with spinach. It was very good. The service was great. Our server was friendly, quick, and informed which is always nice. I'm taking away a star for two reasons. The place was quite dark. The candles on the table were great but I was struggling to see the menu. The walls were kinda bare so maybe install some sconces to add just a little more light. Secondly outside was closed and we wanted to sit out back. These are minor gripes though. All in all. Great restaurant, great food. Will definitely be back.",4.0
"I was raised in a pizzeria. Being first generation Italian immigrants, my grandparents made a life in the states by opening up a restaurant and cooking food--more specifically, authentic, Italian cuisine. So from a young age, I made it a point to never purchase a plate of pasta or order meatballs from a restaurant--the same meal made by my grandmother would be free and significantly better. Yet one late night in Brooklyn, while trying to find a quaint, romantic spot to have dinner with my boyfriend, my countless Yelp searches and my indecisive hunger led me to Cent'Anni; a restaurant priding itself on its Italian dishes, its specialty being homemade pasta. I was apprehensive, and already kicking myself for not checking out the Mexican place down the street, when the hostess led us to a beautifully lit up garden, patterned with rows of wooden tables topped with tea candles. We looked over our small menus as our waitress announced specials. I overheard a description of butternut squash ravioli, a house favorite. It was pasta, but I love butternut squash, and it's rarely used by my grandmother, so ravioli it was. A lovely plate with perfectly sized pillows of freshly made dough and butternut squash puree was delivered promptly. They were bathing in a sauce made of butter, lemon zest, and sage. One bite of ravioli, dipped in the creamy sauce had more flavors than my taste buds could keep up with. The butter was light, a subtle tartness came from the zest, and a savory hint of sage balanced the array of flavors. Everything was fresh, including the actual pasta dough, and the squash revealed tastes and scents of autumn. Matched with a glass of Rosé, a perfect end-of-summer meal was accomplished. Nothing will ever compare to my grandmother's cooking, but now I know where to go when I'm feeling homesick and need the next best thing.",4.0

I really liked this place. The atmosphere and food were great. The waitress was very attentive although she seemed slightly overwhelmed. The boar ragu was to die for.

"I recently has dinner here with a good friend and had a really bad experience. The food is okay, but a good restaurant is not just about the food. The waitress was really bad and really unprofessional. This place just opened a few months ago, so I'm guessing they'd assume each person is a first time customer. I said I hadn't been here before and the waitress said ""Oh, really?"" I was surprised by her, well, surprise, but also by the unfriendliness of it. I think something like, ""Welcome,"" or ""Glad you're joining us tonight"" would have been more appropriate. I'm not glad we spent money at this restaurant. It seems this waitress and my friend have a mutual friend in common, from college, from 5 yrs ago, and the waitress couldn't stop bothering us. We were having an important talk, some catch-up, and time without a stranger interrupting. She wasn't exactly asking if the food was good (not bad, but nothing I couldn't make at home), and she couldn't remember the daily specials. But she could remember all the good time at Yale and blah blah blah. I hate to say it, but I felt ignored and disrespected. My body language and frowns indicated I wasn't happy and instead of asking open ended questions, she continued to bother my friend (who didn't have as much of a problem with her), and she continued to assume that her behavior was alright. I realize I could have said something that night, to her or to the manager. I'm a little uptight, I have high standards for customer service because I also work in customer service, and I work my ass off, and I treat my visitors with respect, and so I guess I decided not to say anything, and let it go. Not sure why I changed my mind, though I went back a few days later to share my concerns. I spoke with a supervisor, though when I asked to speak with a supervisor, she said, ""I guessed that'd be me,"" so I'm not sure what that means. She listened attentively and seemed to agree that my standards of customer service...ya know, wanting respect and courtesy etc etc, are valid and should be in place. I also think this neighborhood, that I'm proud to live in, has high standards and deserves restaurants that meet and exceed those standards. This matters. I'm not spending my money just anywhere...and neither should you. The curiosity for a new place on Franklin ave, isn't reason enough to have dinner there. I appreciate the supervisor's time although I would have liked to speak with a manager. She said he was out. She wrote down my email address and I spelled it out for her, and no one has contacted me. I don't really care, but then why ask for my email address for someone to contact me?There are many options for good places in the neighborhood. I'm sure you already know of them & can decide for yourself where to have dinner. Make a smart decision.",2.0
"Pasta is one of those plates that we can all make at home. Thus, if I am going to spend money on a plate of pasta-not to mention $16 for wild boar ragu on Franklin Ave.-it should leave me with a lasting impression. The wiid boar ragu was-to put it bluntly-outright boring. What steak is to a steak house, pasta is to an Italian restaurant. They really need to step up their game on the pasta front.",2.0
Yuck' wtf did I just spend $50 on! Y didn't y'all warn me? Damn u yuck ppl! The pasta was horrible and the sauce taste like it came from a came... I won't even start on that dry ass sausage and u know I love MEAT! I wouldn't even feed It to my dog.... The best part of the meal was the mark angelic bread that I bought from key foods n baked my damn self. SMH,1.0
"Stumbled upon this hidden gem earlier in the week. It was stifling summer heat outside but we had kids so we opted to sit in the adorable outside courtyard since there was a fan and the kids wouldn't disrupt the other diners. DESPITE the heat, it was a delicious meal with just a few preferential kinks. The waitress was adorable, friendly, helpful and welcoming. They were prepared and comfortable with serving kids which was a pleasant/unusual experience. They provided both a brunch and regular menu, (I would only advise for them to stick to one since it got so complicated trying to choose something). We ordered: arugula prosciutto salad with Romano- perfection, fresh, perfectly dressed, simple deliciousness, Shrimp blt- perfectly seasoned absolutely memorably yummy, Milanese sandwich- did not try but was told it was good, grilled vegetable platter- very simple, very good, and yummmmmm to grilled fennel, new favorite thing, polenta with arugula and gorgonzola- didn't like the huge condensed ball of Gorgonzola served on top but the polenta was perfect, Orrechiete with pesto- it was very good, pasta was perfectly cooked, the pesto was a tad salty, the green beans were a nice crispy fresh addition, i could have done without the red bliss potatoes (carb overload). It was way too hot to skip gelato so we opted for the vanilla bean and cappuccino crunch- INCREDIBLE, better than in some gelaterias in Italy. Very pleasantly surprised. We have been to Barboncino across the street and this was by far a much better dining experience.",5.0
"Been four times. Everything is good, some stuff is great, and it's all inexpensive compared to Park Slope, Williamsburg, or Manhattan price ranges. Service is attentive and knowledgeable. Handmade pasta is just a notch below ""excellent"", but the program is always a great option for dinner. Entrees are well portioned and well executed. Simple Italian hearth fare done really well without a lot of ego... that's what you'll find here.",5.0
"The service is always consistently great, now the food not so much! The burrata is a must, but please share since it's a lot of cheese. The fennel salad is always my favorite! Now the pasta. We had the spinach gnocchi which was to die for, potato porcini ravioli which equally good but the pesto tagliatelle was the biggest let down! The pesto sauce was extremely watery, not creamy or nutty at all. I had to put extra cheese to try to eat it. The fig gelato dessert, with caramelized pear in a port wine reduction was made to perfection, but the tiramisu was probably the worse I've eaten in my whole life. Very dry, no flavors at all. Tiramisu has to be moist with that coffee and rum....so, for dessert, just have gelatos and sobert!",4.0
"When I got my tiny serving of French toast, I understood why the brunch prices seemed so reasonable. It was tasty, but it was a single thick slice of bread, cut diagonally into two triangles. Well prepared and spiced, but paying $8 bucks for a single slice of bread (""Pullman"" or otherwise) dipped in egg, with a couple of strawberries on it is ridiculous. I basically had to eat lunch again an hour later. Maybe their other portions are more generous but that was pretty stingy.",2.0
"I'm writing this review while still at the table because we love it!  The bf and I came here on a whim as we walked by. They sat us immediately in their charming backyard. There are lights strung above your head with soft mood lighting and flower boxes on the wall... It all makes for a lovely atmosphere. Our waitress Faith, was super nice and very attentive. She answered all questions with a smile and knew the menu backwards and forwards. One of the owners came over to make sure all was well... Always a nice touch!

"I recently has dinner here with a good friend and had a really bad experience. The food is okay, but a good restaurant is not just about the food. The waitress was really bad and really unprofessional. This place just opened a few months ago, so I'm guessing they'd assume each person is a first time customer. I said I hadn't been here before and the waitress said ""Oh, really?"" I was surprised by her, well, surprise, but also by the unfriendliness of it. I think something like, ""Welcome,"" or ""Glad you're joining us tonight"" would have been more appropriate. I'm not glad we spent money at this restaurant. It seems this waitress and my friend have a mutual friend in common, from college, from 5 yrs ago, and the waitress couldn't stop bothering us. We were having an important talk, some catch-up, and time without a stranger interrupting. She wasn't exactly asking if the food was good (not bad, but nothing I couldn't make at home), and she couldn't remember the daily specials. But she could remember all the good time at Yale and blah blah blah. I hate to say it, but I felt ignored and disrespected. My body language and frowns indicated I wasn't happy and instead of asking open ended questions, she continued to bother my friend (who didn't have as much of a problem with her), and she continued to assume that her behavior was alright. I realize I could have said something that night, to her or to the manager. I'm a little uptight, I have high standards for customer service because I also work in customer service, and I work my ass off, and I treat my visitors with respect, and so I guess I decided not to say anything, and let it go. Not sure why I changed my mind, though I went back a few days later to share my concerns. I spoke with a supervisor, though when I asked to speak with a supervisor, she said, ""I guessed that'd be me,"" so I'm not sure what that means. She listened attentively and seemed to agree that my standards of customer service...ya know, wanting respect and courtesy etc etc, are valid and should be in place. I also think this neighborhood, that I'm proud to live in, has high standards and deserves restaurants that meet and exceed those standards. This matters. I'm not spending my money just anywhere...and neither should you. The curiosity for a new place on Franklin ave, isn't reason enough to have dinner there. I appreciate the supervisor's time although I would have liked to speak with a manager. She said he was out. She wrote down my email address and I spelled it out for her, and no one has contacted me. I don't really care, but then why ask for my email address for someone to contact me?There are many options for good places in the neighborhood. I'm sure you already know of them & can decide for yourself where to have dinner. Make a smart decision.",2.0
"Pasta is one of those plates that we can all make at home. Thus, if I am going to spend money on a plate of pasta-not to mention $16 for wild boar ragu on Franklin Ave.-it should leave me with a lasting impression. The wiid boar ragu was-to put it bluntly-outright boring. What steak is to a steak house, pasta is to an Italian restaurant. They really need to step up their game on the pasta front.",2.0
Yuck' wtf did I just spend $50 on! Y didn't y'all warn me? Damn u yuck ppl! The pasta was horrible and the sauce taste like it came from a came... I won't even start on that dry ass sausage and u know I love MEAT! I wouldn't even feed It to my dog.... The best part of the meal was the mark angelic bread that I bought from key foods n baked my damn self. SMH,1.0
"Stumbled upon this hidden gem earlier in the week. It was stifling summer heat outside but we had kids so we opted to sit in the adorable outside courtyard since there was a fan and the kids wouldn't disrupt the other diners. DESPITE the heat, it was a delicious meal with just a few preferential kinks. The waitress was adorable, friendly, helpful and welcoming. They were prepared and comfortable with serving kids which was a pleasant/unusual experience. They provided both a brunch and regular menu, (I would only advise for them to stick to one since it got so complicated trying to choose something). We ordered: arugula prosciutto salad with Romano- perfection, fresh, perfectly dressed, simple deliciousness, Shrimp blt- perfectly seasoned absolutely memorably yummy, Milanese sandwich- did not try but was told it was good, grilled vegetable platter- very simple, very good, and yummmmmm to grilled fennel, new favorite thing, polenta with arugula and gorgonzola- didn't like the huge condensed ball of Gorgonzola served on top but the polenta was perfect, Orrechiete with pesto- it was very good, pasta was perfectly cooked, the pesto was a tad salty, the green beans were a nice crispy fresh addition, i could have done without the red bliss potatoes (carb overload). It was way too hot to skip gelato so we opted for the vanilla bean and cappuccino crunch- INCREDIBLE, better than in some gelaterias in Italy. Very pleasantly surprised. We have been to Barboncino across the street and this was by far a much better dining experience.",5.0
"Been four times. Everything is good, some stuff is great, and it's all inexpensive compared to Park Slope, Williamsburg, or Manhattan price ranges. Service is attentive and knowledgeable. Handmade pasta is just a notch below ""excellent"", but the program is always a great option for dinner. Entrees are well portioned and well executed. Simple Italian hearth fare done really well without a lot of ego... that's what you'll find here.",5.0
"The service is always consistently great, now the food not so much! The burrata is a must, but please share since it's a lot of cheese. The fennel salad is always my favorite! Now the pasta. We had the spinach gnocchi which was to die for, potato porcini ravioli which equally good but the pesto tagliatelle was the biggest let down! The pesto sauce was extremely watery, not creamy or nutty at all. I had to put extra cheese to try to eat it. The fig gelato dessert, with caramelized pear in a port wine reduction was made to perfection, but the tiramisu was probably the worse I've eaten in my whole life. Very dry, no flavors at all. Tiramisu has to be moist with that coffee and rum....so, for dessert, just have gelatos and sobert!",4.0
"When I got my tiny serving of French toast, I understood why the brunch prices seemed so reasonable. It was tasty, but it was a single thick slice of bread, cut diagonally into two triangles. Well prepared and spiced, but paying $8 bucks for a single slice of bread (""Pullman"" or otherwise) dipped in egg, with a couple of strawberries on it is ridiculous. I basically had to eat lunch again an hour later. Maybe their other portions are more generous but that was pretty stingy.",2.0
"I'm writing this review while still at the table because we love it!  The bf and I came here on a whim as we walked by. They sat us immediately in their charming backyard. There are lights strung above your head with soft mood lighting and flower boxes on the wall... It all makes for a lovely atmosphere. Our waitress Faith, was super nice and very attentive. She answered all questions with a smile and knew the menu backwards and forwards. One of the owners came over to make sure all was well... Always a nice touch!

"My first meal a Centanni was truly wonderful.  The blank ink pasta with calamari and spicy tomato sauce was perfect...and seemed to never end. The pasta was the perfect al dente and the sauce was garlicky and flavorful.  The squid was perfectly cooked.  My friend had the orecchiette with pistachio pesto, potatoes, and green beans. The pasta was perfectly cooked, the sauce was delightful and light, and everything was wonderful. Our cocktails were unique and refreshing.  The portions were a great bang for your buck. We both had plenty of leftovers for lunch (though I couldn't wait and ate mine shortly after getting home) and the price was more than reasonable considering the quality and quantity. Centanni gets an A++ for decor. Service was great. I was also really impressed with the number of tables they could comfortably fit so hopefully we can avoid two hour waits before they get really popular (which will surely happen soon). I only wish they took credit cards. I would order much more food and booze if they did.I cant wait to go back and try more items from the menu.",4.0

"Trust me, I don't want to write this review. I want the restaurants in my neighborhood to be great. But last night my girlfriend and I went to Cent'Anni and just had a kinda terrible meal.To start, the service was pretty bad. We were seated by the manager in the outdoor patio (which is nice), but then we had no one approach us for many minutes. The manager approached us and literally said ""Am I lead to believe no one has come to your table yet?"" You are correct, sir. Even he seemed disappointed in the poor service. We tried the roasted pepper and ricotta salata and ""wild mushroom"" crostini. Both toppings were cold, like they were put on top of the untoasted bread right from the fridge. I also put wild mushroom in quotes because I kinda can't stand when restaurants describe dishes improperly to make us believe its something better than it is. That topping appeared to simply be sauteed button mushrooms, and again it was bizarrely really cold, and utterly tasteless. We also got the fresh pastas. The pappardelle with Grandma's ragu was just not good. The sauce was sweet and tasted as if they used a jar of Ragu and just threw in some mini-meatballs and a few slices of sausage. My girlfriend also agreed she wasn't sure how ""fresh"" the pasta was. The ravioli with butter and sage was passable, but since everything else left us with a bad taste in our mouth, it couldn't really save the day.I am upset that I had to write this, its just that I hate going out and spending $75 for a dinner I know I could make at home, and better. If you want to try it, be my guest, but I'd rather go to Barbancino or Bar Corvo where I've had consistently good meals.",1.0

The space is very nice with that industrial vibe with subway tiles, exposed wood and metal which seems to be de rigeur. There is also a lovely backyard which is where we ate on a hot summer night in late June. Our waitress was super friendly, helpful and attentive. The only good thing about the food was the yummy sauteed calamari. I shared plates with one of my dinner mates.The gluten free penne with lamb ragu was acidic and not well flavored. We also had the pork chop  which was not salty enough and was served with veggies which were kind of bland. For dessert one of my dinner mates ordered the poached pear with sorbet which was pretty tasty. Nobody was really happy with their food.

I love this place, I love all of the staff in here, service is great so I just hope they can keep the quality of the food up.

"Okay, I'm giving this place, really 4.5 stars. It's a really cute and well-done restaurant. Great decor and adorable outdoor back patio/garden area.

Oh, let me tell you about the specials! Well, I can't really tell you THAT much, because they have a LOT and they're all very different from what's on the menu and clearly very seasonal, which shows that they care about providing a unique menu and experience. I got a nice basic ragu rigatoni dish -- sauce was superb. And let's just say, I'm pretty sure they make it from fresh tomatoes, in house, that day. That's how good it was. A really nice balance and all super fresh (hopefully local?) ingredients, which really make this a spot worth going and worth supporting.

A really nice balance and all super fresh (hopefully local?) ingredients, which really make this a spot worth going and worth supporting. Sure, there's other restaurants, but that shouldn't stop you from nothing giving this one a visit!",4.0
"I have found myself married to a man who hates going out to dinner, so when I get a chance to drag him out for a candlelit date night, I have to make it count. Cent'anni, while a bit loud for romance, had really delicious food and a gently-priced wine list. By the end of our bottle of Lambrusco and huge square of homemade tiramisu, even my restaurant hating Mister seemed pretty happy and satisfied. The tagliatelle Alfredo was awesome!",4.0
"I thought the atmosphere was decent.  Seemed very busy tonight and our waitress seemed stressed with all of the tables.  Food was pretty good, but a little lacking in flavor.  We ate roasted beet salad, mushroom crostini, and the spinach and ricotta tortellini.  The salad was well dressed and delicious.  The crostini could have used more seasoning or flavor, though the mushrooms were fresh.  For the tortellini, the pasta filling was a little lacking but the sauce was excellent.  Overall, a good experience, but not the best Italian food I've ever had.",3.0
