"We came to NY with no real plans of where to eat. Glad we did that because we keep stumbling across gems. This being one! We were in the neighborhood at Other Half and starving. We yelped this place and it sounded amazing. I'm originally from Paraguay, so I'm very picky with my South American food, especially food from Argentina. The Empanadas were incredibly authentic! The dough is amazing and made in house (i asked). We had the ham and cheese, chicken, and beef. Not one disappointed.The boy and I shared the Milanesa a caballo for our entree. Noms! It was just the right portion for sure. He also decided to order mashed yucca. I'm so glad he did. It was the most delicious way to eat yucca ever!For dessert we had the dulce de leche crepes. It was the right amount of sweet after the yummy meal we had.The ambiance is cozy but not crowded and super clean. The staff is super friendly, inviting, and attentive. People love it so much that they had at least ten regulars walk in there while we were there. So glad we stumbled in here.",5.0
"""Nice and friendly""Randomly, I stopped by this restaurant for a quick bite to eat and was pleasantly surprised. The staff was very helpful in helping me pick out a couple of small plates. I went with the empanadas (I forget which ones), which were AMAZING, and a soup. The shell of the empanadas was so light and flaky and the filling was wonderful. The kitchen staff was accommodating with the soup. The soup of the day was something with pumpkin(yuck) but the kitchen staff whipped me up another soup with Argentine sausage and jumbo beans. All in all if I am in the Red Hook area then I will be back for dos más empanadas.",4.0
My new favorite restaurant in NYC! You walk in and pause in awe at how beautiful and unique it is and then the staff is amazingly personable and the drinks out of this world. This is THE spot to relax and be pampered.  I'll be bringing friends here from now on!,5.0
"I never give 6 stars & today is my first..1 for small clean inviting atmosphere, 2 for Hospitality, 3 for fresh moist & authentic Argentine BBQ, 4 Yucca mash mmmMm, 5 Blood sausage/Morcilla, and 6 STAR Empanadas!!! I am coming back to try to Milanesa brunch and cocktails!",5.0
"Favorite place in the neighborhood ! Fernando, Ariel, Claudia and the chef Edu treat us as if we were at home every time we go. Drinks are very good and their famous empanadas amazing.They will also prepare special vegetarian dishes for me if I ask for it.",5.0
"Hot steak, hotter waiter. The food was fabulous. So simple but so amazing. Took my friend who was considering becoming a vegetarian here and she realized what she'd be missing out on. Will definitely be returning soon especially for Fernando! Waiter was really interactive with us, knew the specials well, was there when needed. He definitely made the visit more memorable! Service was fabulous and the food was definitely worth it.",5.0
"I'm so impressed with this beautiful idea of a business in this amazing neighborhood. It is difficult to find a complete great customer experience in New York but El Mate exceeds everything that we look for in a restaurant.  I just tried their amazing sangria, maracuya mimosa, Bloody Mary and the amazing Backyard Chef Burger - it all makes me want to come back every weekend w\o excuse.",5.0
"As an Argentinian I guess I feel like some kind of authority on this topic. There aren't many Argentinian places in New York period, let alone authentic ones. Well, this one is. Genuine home cooking 100%. The empanadas were ridiculously delicious and Fernando the owner is a f**king gem of a man. I would recommend this place to anyone who misses Argentina and likes delicious food.",5.0
"Cool place, nice atmosphere. Bartender is really cool. Offers a pre fixe menu as well as a regular menu. Empanadas are great. Can't go wrong with any one of them. This is my second time there and I must say the first time was a better food experience. I'm a definite carnivore  and I love my meat (steak,sausage,ribs) the first time I went my steak was cooked to perfection and seasoned well. Second time hmm......definitely different. Food was missing that wow factor. It was still good but not as great as my first experience. I would still recommend you try them out. I want to check out their weekend brunch soon.",4.0

"Exceptional food and service!This place is new and a true find if you like Brazilian and Argentinian cuisine.  As traditional with both cuisines, there are lots of steak options which are prepared and cooked to perfection.   Everything here is home made, from the chimichurri sauce to the wide variety of empanadas to the delicious desserts.  There are vegetarian options as well (I highly recommend the cannelloni, sweet potato fries and kale salad, yum!)They also have a very nice selection of south american wines, which are very reasonably priced.  Great ambiance in the restaurant itself, and there's lots of room outside on the patio as well if you prefer to dine al fresca.  Very friendly staff from the waiters to the bartender to the owners, who are always around ensuring their customers are happy. It's a short ride from Manhattan and well worth it.  Reservations suggested.",5.0
"Lovely restaurant!  Louisa helped us and she is the nicest person, really helped with recommending items on the menu (which came out tasting great)! We tried the blood sausage and sweetbread, both of which are very tasty.  They brought spicy sauce to the table, which is very freshly made and delicious. For the sides, the mashed yucca and kale salads are great. Lovely atmosphere and great food, with the best service!",5.0
GREAT MEAL! GREAT OWERS/STAFF!Very mellow and rustic place. Perfect date spot. You're greeted warmly by the staff. Our server Luisa was exceptionally friendly and helpful.

"Went here last night with my family, and we all LOVED IT! I had told my parents that this place had opened, and it was Argentinian food. They're not unadventurous eaters, but I could tell that they weren't eager to go. We went to a place next door that we like, but it was closed for a party, so we went to El Mate.We had mixed empanadas (which were all excellent! I loved the picadillo the best.) For entrées, I had the salmon, which was also excellent. It comes with roasted kale and yucca purée. I'll be dreaming about the yucca for days, it was so delicious.My mother had the tilapia, my father had the chicken Milanesa Clasica, and a side of rice and beans. We all loved everything we had.The service was one of the best things at El Mate. They're family owned and operated, truly aim to please, and are truly passionate about sharing their culture with you. The owner gave us all a hug as we left, haha.Seriously, don't miss this place!",5.0

"Took my mom here for a birthday dinner on a Friday night and we were very impressed. The staff was very friendly and accommodating from beginning to end. Very helpful with the menu and they gave us great recommendations. The food was delicious!! Empanadas were amazing! We had mentioned that it was her birthday and when we were done with dinner, we asked for dessert and they brought a flan with candles and sang happy birthday to her, she loved it. Oh and by the way, the flan was amazingggg! All in all, we all loved this place. And the staff makes it such a friendly environment, very enjoyable. They also have an outdoor area for the nicer days! Definitely will be returning soon!!",5.0
"We really wanted to love this place as we live in the hood.  Unfortunately, it was an epic fail.  The outdoor space was cool and the kale caesar salad and mashed yucca was pretty good. However, I ordered the skirt steak (medium) and about 45 minutes later, I was presented with a rib eye steak very well done (super chewy and dry).  The waiter only told me as he placed the rib eye in front of me that they were out of the skirt steak! I would have liked to have had a choice especially since the rib eye totally sucked. The waiter ""tried to make good"" by offering to charge us the skirt steak price (a mere $3 less) and then proceeded to let us know how good the skirt steak tasted when he had it the night before. Thanks dude. We won't be back.",2.0
"Lovely decor and outside seating area, great for a romantic date or small group dinner. Unique (and that's hard to do in Brooklyn) drinks and appetizers.Friendly and attentive service.

"Just tried this place as it is newly opened. The staff, being very courteous and friendly set the tone for my pleasant evening. The decor, lots of exposed brick and wood tones, is very warm and inviting. I was very pleased with the empanadas, the spinach being my favorite, as they were very well prepared (baked not fried). Also had the passion fruit mousse for dessert. Great choice. Not being too savvy on wines myself owner Ariel recommended the Malbec. I really enjoyed it. Highly recommend El Mate and will be coming back to try more.",5.0

"Periodically I fixate on finding ""the perfect [insert food name here]"". Lately, I've been trying to find a devastatingly good empanada in my Brooklyn 'backyard'.  Well, El Mate probably doesn't make the holy grail of empanadas (where an angelic choir sounds on the first bite) BUT it is a solid contender and they deliver. Win-win!The family that owns the joint is focused on just a few items - a good sign in my opinion. They offer a few salads, a modest selection of entrees, and empanadas in a half dozen varieties. I'm used to seeing two or - if lucky - three varieties of empanada on a menu. Six is really a treat and speaks to their dedication.The empanadas come with a couple of different sauces to spice them up. Here's how I know the empanadas are really good... the sauces are unnecessary. After a couple bites, my wife and I pushed the sauces aside and they remained untouched. Normally, I shy away from beef empanadas. For some reason, it is painfully easy to ruin one - making it too dry, not spicy enough, or tough as shoe leather. But the folks at El Mate know what they are doing. I only got two of the beef empanadas but on reflection I should have upped my order. Which is another thing I like about El Mate. You can order empanadas as a two-pack, a six-pack, or get a full dozen. And they are at a price point that won't make your wallet groan.",4.0

"Tremendous add to the neighborhood. The food and the hosts make the walk down the hill more than worthwhile. Argentinian beef and Brazilian traditional dishes are done well, all boosted by warm service from owners who love what they do and have a genuine care for their customer. Ask for the cold mate drink and the Romeo and Juliet dessert.",4.0
Our group of four came without knowing what to expect. We were greeted by the charming host who explained the menu items in this Argentine/Brazilian newbie.We had very pretty empanadas of chicken and of spinach. They tasted just as good as they looked -- moist and succulent. We had Pollo Milanese with the house salad. The serving size was really large and we took home a good portion. The breading was crispy and the chicken juicy-- very winning . But the beef steals the show . The fillet mignon was seared and had a little  smokey charcoal flavor and the beef was so tender.  Argentines know beef! Our side dishes of manioca ( yuca) and the house salad held their own. The desserts are creative and delicate.  We are all eager to return. A perfect place for a romantic Valentine's Day dinner celebration.,5.0

"I can't say enough good things about El Mate - the food was amazing, the wine and drinks were amazing, the atmosphere was amazing, the staff was... helpful, friendly, knowledgeable, eager, attentive and all around amazing! I've been here a couple of times now and have tried about 80% of the menu and have yet to be disappointed. The empanada starters are delicious, the soup(s) of the day are whole heartedly bursting with flavor, all the entrees from the Chicken Roulade and Milanesa(s) were perfectly delicious - the sides like the pure de yucca and sauteed garlicky kale were delicious; and I always finish off my delicious meals with coffee and a dessert. :)",5.0
"Great service, cute place,and ambience is perfect for a date or dinner with friends. Empanadas are delicious along with their rib-eye!",5.0
"Love this place, the food is to die for :) the service is friendly and the wine is just perfect !!! Now is my new favorite place",5.0
I never take the time to write a review but this place deserves to be acknowledged for their great service and delicious food!! Went with my family for the first time on Sunday and it exceeded our expectations. Their drinks are great and empanadas are some of the best I've had in a long time. The staff was so accommodating to our party of 8 plus a 3 yr old! The steak was perfect...well everything we had was great so you can't go wrong. I highly recommend this place. So glad we tried it and we will definitely be back!!!,5.0
"Tremendous add to the neighborhood. The food and the hosts make the walk down the hill more than worthwhile. Argentinian beef and Brazilian traditional dishes are done well, all boosted by warm service from owners who love what they do and have a genuine care for their customer. Ask for the cold mate drink and the Romeo and Juliet dessert.",4.0
Our group of four came without knowing what to expect. We were greeted by the charming host who explained the menu items in this Argentine/Brazilian newbie.We had very pretty empanadas of chicken and of spinach. They tasted just as good as they looked -- moist and succulent. We had Pollo Milanese with the house salad. The serving size was really large and we took home a good portion. The breading was crispy and the chicken juicy-- very winning . But the beef steals the show . The fillet mignon was seared and had a little  smokey charcoal flavor and the beef was so tender.  Argentines know beef! Our side dishes of manioca ( yuca) and the house salad held their own. The desserts are creative and delicate.  We are all eager to return. A perfect place for a romantic Valentine's Day dinner celebration.,5.0
"My experience at El Mate couldn't be better. The food was delicious,drinks perfectly mixed and the ambiance was great. I recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for an intimate  setting with friends or a date.  I will definitely come back again!",5.0
"We love this place.  El Mate has amazing empanadas (beef, sausage and cheese, and chicken are yummy), the house Malbec is delicious, and the flan is to die for.My wife is from Argentina and has been waiting for a place like this to come to brooklyn.  And they deliver!It's a cozy atmosphere and friendly staff.  We're looking forward to having meals in their garden once the Spring arrives.",5.0
"I had the tilapia tonight and really enjoyed the tartness of the lemon with the seasoning of the fish, the spinach and even the yams (which surprised me).A genuine product, very worth supporting. This is not a super polished place but its got more genuine warmth than some of the perfectly conceived places. Also, the garden in the back is going to be a really nice place to hang out.",4.0
"Came here for a last minute Mother's Day dinner when many places in surrounding areas were full and no longer taking customers. I am so happy that we came here, it really saved the day. Firstly, I value customer service. The service was top notch, every person working came over to our table to make sure that we were having a good experience. We started our dinner with drinks and appetizers. Sangria, the Brazilian house cocktail, sweetbreads, empanadas... All wonderful. We ordered the meat sampler for two which could easily feed 3, the meats were all tender and seasoned perfectly so you could really enjoy the taste of the meat. It came with two sides, the yucca mash was awesome. For dessert, we had the flan and a dulce de leche crepe that was sent over on the house. I honestly can't say enough good things about this place. I would recommend anyone reading this review to check it out. Five stars, hands down.",5.0
"My family and I really enjoyed this Argentine/Brazilian restaurant.  Excellent steaks, truly pleasant service.  Not a light meal, but a good one.",4.0
El Mate is a great restaurant. I celebrated my birthday here with my wife. The restaurant was quiet and the service was great! We were given 2 free appetizers which were delicious... the best empanada's around! Both of our steaks were cooked perfectly and our sides accompanied very well. We washed the meal down with Malbec's to finish the Argentine evening. They even delivered a free dessert (and sang) for my birthday!,5.0
"Just discovered this place. Finally Brazilian food in Brooklyn! Very authentic and delicious. The owners came to greet us personally and welcome us. Also, there was terrific live music which was a mix of Brazilian bossa nova and American songs. Don't miss the empanadas, the Brazilian Flan desert and the Carioca cocktail. Highly recommended!!",5.0
"This place is so good! The food is superb-- some Argentinian, some Brazilian, ALL GOOD. I have tried the classic Argentine skirt steak and it was one of the best that I have had in the city. I would probably say the same about the empanadas-- I never knew that they could be so good. If you are interested in something besides meat, they have salads that are very fresh and also great. I have never written a review on Yelp before, but their food is so good and the owners are super nice so this place deserves it!",5.0
"My husband is from Buenos Aires and has by missing Argentine food terribly. Luckily, we found El Mate, which is across the corner from our home. My husband ordered a Milanesa Napolitana, one of his favorite dishes. I felt like there was a lot riding on it.. lest it be a disappointment and leave him even more homesick. Fernando brought the delivery over immediately - honestly, I think in 10 minutes or less. And it was absolutely Delicious!! Really, really good. My husband said (jokingly, I hope) that now that he found this place he can stay here in New York. We are looking forward to dining in the restaurant soon and trying more of their dishes.",5.0
"New place, and great add to the neighborhood. Really great authentic Argentinian/Brazilian food. It's like amazing home cooking taken up a notch! Great atmosphere and low key casual vibe. Cozy, and very friendly staff. I highly recommend!",5.0
"No words to describe the dishes that are served...not to mention the drinks that are made of yerba mate, unbelievable! They have a great service and very kind to customers.A good place to go with family and friends. I will be back for sure :)",5.0
"Never order here for delivery unless you're paying in cash. We live on the first floor next to the foyer where the mail is dropped off and doorbell is rung. Tonight our order was placed more than an hour before I contacted eat24 and then the restaurant told them 10-15 minutes... 30 minutes passed again and they are now confirming delivery. We live next to the door and the window is wide open! Whoever is confirming this! You should either card your delivery or stop lying! Eat24 will be canceling this order and lying and delivering to wrong people and having other people is bad business practice.  It's tough to not be harsh when the charge is $20 and no food shows up, but thanks to Eat24, no harm was done. Also, thank you Ariel for your response and explanation. I'm hesitant to order delivery, but your food ratings are good, and if I do try your food for the first time since the last time was unsuccessful, then I'll make sure to order delivery with cash only or to dine in.",1.0
