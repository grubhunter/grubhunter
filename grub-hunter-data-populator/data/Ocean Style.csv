"I stopped by for a quick early sushi dinner at around 5:30pm on a Thursday. As expected, the restaurant was completely empty since they were prepping for dinner. We ordered 7 rolls and although the restaurant was empty, it did take a bit of time for our order to come out. Luckily, we were seated right across from their lone TV and were entertained for that period by the news.As for the sushi, I had no complaints. The roll piece sizes were on par with many other restaurants and the taste was right on. These days I can't differentiate much between 50% off sushi restaurants, unless the flavor or size is really off, so with that said I give this place my blessing. In addition, the restaurant is pretty big in size, but I'm not sure if it ever gets crowded at night with the competition in Sheepshead Bay.",4.0
"This place is amazing. I looooooooove sushi and they sure know how to make it right.I have been here countless times, the service is exceptional, the food is delicious and I never had a complaint. My daughter, my best friend and I are even on their wall of pictures. Haha. Actually there's two pictures because we go there that often. I only live a few blocks away but delivery is so speedy. And the delivery man is so sweet! I love this place, and because of them I could probably eat sushi everyday of my life.",5.0
"Ocean Style is a great little local Japanese favorite right here in sleepy Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn. Don't worry if you come in here and the place is empty..........that's just how this part of Brookyln rolls! Most of their business are takeout orders, but don't fret the place is very clean and the bathroom is spacious and well lit. The sushi rolls here are great, I personally recommend the Dragon roll and Lobster roll from here. Also take a look at the appetizers, I ordered both the grilled chicken skewers and the Fried Oyster, both of which were sensational! Definitely give Ocean Style a visit!!",5.0
My buddy and I have been going here this past year from time to time after finding this gem randomly while driving by late at night and it was still open as oppose to the other neighborhood sushi spots that close at 10-11pm.A fat guy like me can crave sushi at any time and the fact that they were open that extra hour when I was driving by def suckered me into being a regular customer with these guys...They have a great menu and the fish is very fresh. Some of the pieces are even above average in size. Everything my buddy and I have tried so far has been on point. They even have a peking duck main course order that is def a must to order to share or eat dolo depending on the sharing situation amongst your group.This place feels like home even though Ive only been here 3-4 times as oppose to the 20-30 times in the other sheepshead bay rd sushi spot battle. One battle that at almost age 30 I am not looking to have. Part of the home feeling is that they have a picture of my friend and I on some Polaroid on their famous wall of customers is very exciting for guys like myself and my best bud. We are just simply appreciative fellas!,4.0
Every time I'm in the mood for sushi this is the place I order from. They have great quality sushi. I live in Manhattan and after having this sushi I find any excuse to come to my best friends house in Brooklyn so we can have a sushi night. Only thing I would change is the communication ordering on the phone. Sometimes they mess up my order but they fix it right away. Nothing too massive to stop giving them my business. If you're in the sheepshead Bay Area I would definitely recommend getting yourself to Ocean Style.,4.0
I'm giving this place a second chance let's see what happens. Only cause the food was awesome. The lady behind the phone-- not so much.,4.0
"Great place, nice staff and the sushi tastes like sushi. :D",5.0
"This place is almost always empty, but that's because most of their customers order out. The food is great, cheap but fresh. The place (including bathrooms, which is a good indication of their care) is kept clean. The atmosphere is nice but pretty dim in light so that sometimes seems isolated. Everything we ordered was great, and we come here very two, three weeks. The cons:I don't know if we have bad luck or something but their miso soup always seems cold, and so does their green tea.",5.0
The waitress was very sweet and friendly. Food was good.,4.0
Called here for delivery and asked them to make sure that there's no bones in our sushi this time and the lady was shocked and very apologetic about the whole situation. She gave us 2 extra pieces of salmon sushi to make up for our last experience. I look forward to trying their dine in and will definitely write an updated review for it.,4.0
"I have to admit the food wasn't bad it was pretty good and I love the fact that it's basically always empty here ,so it's good for a quiet lunch  the decor is nothing special and the workers are pleasant so I would go here again",4.0
"I really loveThis place, I usually end up here during lunch and it's never too busy, I believe mostOf their revenue is from deliveries. Nevertheless, it's cheap, it's fresh, and the staff are great, sooo much nicerThan any sushi spot on sheepshead bay road, where they don't give a crap. Also VERY CLEAN!!! Good vibes, good sushi vibes. Only reason I didn't give it a 5th star is because the Tom yum soup was made overly sour and wrong. ButI forgive them.",4.0
"This is our go to delivery spot for sushi in the neighborhood because 1) the food is consistently fresh, and 2) the main girl who works at the front/answers the phone is SUPER SWEET and personable.",5.0
they have the fastest service and best lunch special! i order from here every week and i reccommend the lucky roll if you like fresh fish with crunch and wasabi. I ordered twice this week was so so delicious.,5.0
"Great food, always fast delivery. I am officially addicted to their crispy duck chef special. Today with be my 6th time in a row ordering it, 10 stars. I also enjoy the Kani sale here. Everything I have had from these guys has been great, I encourage everyone to try this place and their crispy duck !",5.0
I've ordered from this place twice and I like this place. The sushi is yummy and I have no complaints about the quality of the fish they use but whenever I order their cooked items like their dumplings or udon dishes I don't like the fact that they come to my house cold. I know I'm ordering take out and it's not always going to be perfect each time but this happened twice to me. The first time I thought it was just me being picky but it happened again and it's rather annoying. I'm expecting my food to be hot or at least warm but it's coming cold as if it was sitting in the mans delivery van for awhile. The service is good and the food comes within a half an hour but in that time I expect my food to be hot not cold by the time it gets to my house. The udon dish is amazing but I don't want to have to microwave it the moment it gets here because it's already cold. But overall the food is good. I would totally order here again because I love their cute Thai Iced tea container and the cute little straw they give you. Also the sushi is pretty good especially for take out. I recommend it.,3.0
"My boyfriend and I order from here at least 5 times a month and it never disappoints! The dancing Kani roll is beyond fantastic and the chicken fried rice is so yummy. Also, plus for having great edamame and chicken teriyaki.",5.0
Great sushi-- so fresh and yummy. And the prices are unbeatable. The waitress yoyo goes out of her way to bring us everything and more. Favorite sushi spot in Brooklyn!,5.0
"Honestly I have no idea how these places survive. There are 5 more sushi places within 5 min waking distance. In fact I stumbled upon this place on my way to another one on the same block!!! Having said that - the rolls were very fresh and tasty. One plus one sake was a good deal and the interior is new and pretty stylish. As with any sushi place in this area you can expect servers that barely speak English, but they know the menu, which I guess is sufficient. Overall a surprisingly nice atmosphere and good sushi. Hope that they stay around for a while :)",5.0

"I didn't know they were there until I got a delivery menu on my doorstep. Tried it with my boyfriend on a Sunday night and we couldn't have been more pleased. The price was right, ambience cool and light, wait staff was attentive and helpful. The place was empty and there was a special on the special rolls - buy one, get one free. The waitress was very sweet & even gave us a free shot of saki. I'm heading there for New Years and plan to make this a favorite spot.It's almost a year later from the review I wrote above and this is still our go to place for great service & sushi.",5.0
"Really has become our go-to sushi place.  They remember to serve my husband full sodium soy sauce that he likes, and they turn off the volume on the TV the minute I walk in.  The sashimi slices are big and the special rolls delicious",5.0
"The waitress is a sweetheart, very attentive, & friendly.I order from here 2 times a week, & dine -in once or twice as well.Besides my likings for quality fresh fish, and sushi there is a reason I turn to ocean style; I'm satisfied every time. A new jem of the neighborhood .",5.0
Wow this place is just amazing. The waitress it extremely friendly and nice. We have been going here for a while but I keep forgetting to check in but now I remembered. This place is just like heaven. Their sushi is just amazing and they are very friendly to you and has an amazing environment.  This place also has amazing chicken teriyaki. I have seen dry chicken teriyaki too many times at other places but here it is very moist and just delicious. I 100% recommend this place an really hope it strives and successes. And I also recommend not just ordering online but coming in and staying also because the environment is amazing and the staff is just awesome who are very fun to get to know. This is one of the best sushi restaurants I have ever been to.,5.0
"Got a delivery via Seamless. Delivery time was good. Crab rangoons were a joke, I've had much better ones (with more filling and tastier pastry) in supermarkets, frozen. Soy sauce was horrible - tasted bitter and old. Fried calamari were meh.Sushi rolls tasted ok (except for yellow tail jalapeno, which a) had a BIG bone in one of the pieces and b) had regular pepper instead of jalapeno), but amount of filling was on the small side, there was more rice then what I'm used to, and pieces were irregular in shape and rather sloppily made.So, I don't know if there are any dishes which are excellent, but for sushi, Ocean Style, you definitely miss the mark.",3.0
