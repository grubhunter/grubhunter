"Russian food in Williamsburg, hello there beautiful.Had dinner here and ordered an assortment of some of my favorite russian dishes:-Pelmeni (dumpling with meat)-Borscht (red beet soup)-Chicken Liver Pate-Chicken Tabaka   These guys know what they are doing. All of the dishes were delicious and authentic. For drinks, they have a full bar and their infused vodkas. I tried the recommended, Horseradish infused vodka, but was not really impressed. Will be back when I need my Russian food fix and don't want to track to the Brighton Beach.",5.0
"Cute decorations of times gone by.  Service was quick and friendly.  The potato pancakes were deliciously fried, but the caviar was not very good.  The crepes were ok as well but nothing to write home about.  The fish soup tasted fresh and well seasoned, and while the little pirozhoks were good they were a little cold in the middle. Their vodkas are delicious though - that was really the highlight of the meal.Overall, if I'm in the neighborhood, I'd give them another go, but wouldn't make the trip just for this.",3.0
"Well, on the bright side, the borscht was good. On the other hand, they were out of ingredients for half the menu and also their signature cocktail; despite the fact that my friend and I were one of two tables in an otherwise empty restaurant, our entrees were delivered twenty minutes apart, the bread was served covered in chunks of barely-cooked garlic, the pierogi were frozen and poorly thawed, the service was surly, and we were double-charged on an item. I wanted to love it, but there wasn't much to love. This place has quite a few issues to work out.",1.0
"Came here awhile back when I happened to be in East Williamsburg for an art show my sister was participating in. I was with my ""I love everything and anything Russian"" friend Ingrid S. and while walking around looking for a place to help us get over the munchies we found Masha & Bear. I found it via the Yelp app and it turns out she already had it bookmarked - I was not surprised, lol. To be honest, I do enjoy Russian food (or anyone's food for the most part) so I was excited to get some Russian noms outside of Brighton Beach, lol.Masha and the Bear has a really cute look and feel. Very rustic and incredibly ""hipster Brooklyn""-esque...not a complaint, just an observation :). The guys at the bar were mostly Russian so I was excited for some (assumingly) authentic eats.We opted for an order of their Pelmeni, which are Siberian-style dumplings consisting of a filling wrapped in thin, unleavened dough. The options are beef, pork or chicken - not on their online menu, there is also an option for potato and that was the road we took...they were delicious and crispy. Great for a snack, not great for $10 given that they're also pretty small. We shared the Pelmeni and they weren't enough we also ordered a Pirozhok. Apparently the literal translation of ""Pirozhok"" is ""small pie"" and that's pretty much what this was. Our options were chicken or cheese and as much as I wish they would have just combined the two fillings, we went with cheese. This cheese Pirozhok was the clear MVP of the night. I could easily eat my weight in these. So light, fluffy and delicious - plus it was my first Pirozhok ever. I could seriously eat these all day. Masha and the Bear also has a full bar, a slightly decent beer selection (emphasis on *decent*) and infused vodka on tap. In case you didn't read that - THEY HAVE YUMY INFUSED VODKA ON TAP and a variety of traditional and non-traditional flavors - like horseradish (which isn't my thing, but hello fruity or nutty ones!). If yummy cheese things isn't enough of a reason for you to want to check this place out, then infused vodkas on tap outta do it :).",4.0
"I love brunch but on this particular morning I was not for the usual brunch suspects of toast, potatos and eggs. I wanted something different and yet still comforting. A little bird told me about Masha and the Bear. Russian breakfast, yes,  Russian style pierogies, lox and zucchini pancakes were more the breakfast agenda. The restaurant is small and lined in wood paneling floor and walls. It has the usual cabin feel that I always compare to the NW. The bartender, Jimmy was covered in tattoos and is a great conversationalist and told some funny stories. The owner and Jimmy were like watching a father and son duo. The owner was helpful and witty when explaining the menu was very cool to have a cultural lesson at brunch. I kept asking about items that were already sold out. I guess Russian champagne is not that great so I wasn't missing much. I was interested in the Dirty Borsch breakfast cocktail. It was described as a Beet flavored Bloody. I will have to get one next time. This time I wanted to keep it simple on the drinks. I just got a nice beer. I did sample a little bit of the horseradish vodka. It would clean up any cold sickness. he horseradish vodka is the perfect accompaniment to fried potato pierogis. When asked if the pierogies should be fried or steamed. The owner explained that we could either live to 80 years old or live up to a hundred. I guess 80 will do on this brunch day. I could see the chef in the back sharpening her knives real sharp.  I would definitely not mess with her and I think she doesn't hear too many complaints. It also helps that the food is spot on. There are no complaints to be given. The zucchini pancakes were delicious and crispy. I loved the refreshing veggie slaw on the side.  My favorite part of the dish is easily the in house made lox!! I love lox!! And these lox were incredible. I would recommend coming here just for the lox alone. The runny eggs mixed with a little slaw, some lox and a dip into the sour cream made the perfect brunch bite.I enjoyed having great company, conversation and equally enjoyable food. Can't wait to come back and try the Classie Russian Beet Spread, the savory mushroom blintzes, borscht and the different vodkas. I am super happy that they truly cater to meat eaters and their equally cool vegetarian/pescatarian friends! And even though it sounds super strange, the Herring in a Fur Coat sounds right up my alley. Definitely on my food to do list and I will report shortly after consumption.",4.0
"I've had this spot on my bookmark list since it pretty much opened. The name hails from an adorable little Russian cartoon and I have quite the fondness for both Russians and their food and alcoholic beverages. After a little art show that my friend Steph P.'s very talented little sister had held in a gallery a few blocks away a couple weeks ago we realized we were both hungry for a snack and that open bar of vodka cranberry mixers with twenty something year-olds that I kept referring to as teenagers just wasn't cutting it for us. ""Hey, I think there are pierogi near us. . . . do you wanna?"" Me: ""Is it Masha and the Bear?! YES! YES! YES!"" Ensues walking around finding a few other neat bars and craft beer stores while we got lost along the way and coming into an adorable little restaurant with cute drawings on the windows of alcoholic bears and little girls wearing red capes. SOLD. Also, hockey was on television and there were several men with beards drinking vodka. SOLD. I actually didn't drink upon my visit. Which is crazy. But I wasn't in the mood or feeling it. But this place, wait for it - HAS VODKA ON TAP. The different varieties of vodka infusions: Honey & Pepper, Wild Berry, Horseradish, Ginger, Hops & Honey, and Seasonal. I want them all. There was also a cocktail menu and a pretty decent craft beer selection with about ten or so beers on tap. I almost feel like organizing an adult field trip to come back here and try everything. For our late evening snacks we decided on both the Pelmeni and Pirozhok. The pelmeni are like mini dumplings which you can order either deep fried or boiled and stuffed with either beef, pork, chicken, potato, or cabbage. We went with the potato deep fried and it comes with sour cream and caramelized onions. Everything was good but we both wanted more. They are tiny dumplings and come in a pretty tiny pot. The Pirozhok was a winner. It's like a delicious flat CHEESE PIE. SO CHEESY! And throw some sour cream on that . . . . never leaving. Their potato pancakes, blintzes, and beef stroganoff also looked pretty good as I smelled and gazed longingly at other tables. Only complaints is that it is a bit pricey for the portions but I'd definitely be curious to come back and try their vodkas and other treats.",4.0

"It's nice to see a place that serves Russian food AND has a chalkboard list of craft beers (especially outside of brighton).They have infused vodkas as well.The idea of the place is great and I hope more like it open up soon. However, the execution could be far better. The food is decent. It's nothing like what I grew up with.. There is no love in it and the flavors are far too mild. The vodka is infused using the absolute cheapest vodka so I wouldn't drink too much of it, though I would still try the hops and honey vodka (cause that is just original).Overall it's a cool place and the food is just okay. I wouldn't go out of my way to visit but if I'm in the neighborhood I might stop by. If you are looking for authentic Russian food this is the mild, made for Americans version. So go elsewhere.",3.0
"A cozy space on the corner, the decor was minimal but hunting lodge-esque. The delicious and tender pelmeni (chicken, boiled) were a substantial appetizer that could easily have been a meal for one, served with sour cream and a fascinatingly spicy mustard-type sauce.  The beef stroganoff and mashed potatoes were rich and satisfying after a long day.  The chamomilla cocktail was likewise a unique and intriguing blend of tastes that complemented the meal quite well.  I highly recommend this spot for a quiet dinner alone, or a weeknight date night.",5.0

I also ordered this special app they had which was almost like a pita/lavash with meat filling served with a dill yogurt sauce, also very tasty. My friends got the beef stroganoff and pickled veggies which were good.

"As a 1st generation American I grew up with abundant flavors from the old country, but as I grew older and moved out I had fewer and fewer opportunities to indulge in authentic Russian cuisine. One day, while trying to find a last-minute restaurant to accommodate a group of 10 for my friend's 30th birthday, I stumbled upon Masha & the Bear on Yelp. What's this? Russian gastropub? Infused vodkas on tap? Good for groups? Takes reservations super last minute? Masha & Vitaliy? I'm sold.Friends, this was a magical experience from start to finish. Our group of 10 was served by Vitaliy (the owner) himself, and the impeccable service was accompanied by endless crude Russian jokes told by Vitaliy throughout the evening to keep us laughing (and cringing) for hours. ""How is Masha's cooking so good? I keep her husband in the basement."" Also, they have pumpkin infused vodka - oh yea.The food was a delicious blast from the past. They really do it right here, and the prices are totally reasonable. From the pelmeni (get them boiled, not fried) to the peroshki (meat pies) to the Russian beat spread served on peasant bread to the galuptsi (meat stuffed cabbage) everything was hearty, delicious, and prepared with love and care. I literally can't wait to come back here, and I'm so glad that Masha & the Bear is gracing the hipster depths of Williambsurg with its presence.",5.0

"Easily 4 stars and maybe 4.5.  The lamb shank was tender, flavorful and the sauce was full of delicate seasonings that added to the enjoyment of the meal.  My dining partner had the cabbage stuffed with beef and rice, with a dollop of sour cream.  It was gone in no time.  There are enough items in the menu to bring me back again.  It truly does feel like you are eating in someone's home!!The service was very cordial, and while they have a nice tap beer selection, I do hope they expand their wine choices in the future.",4.0
"This place is actually quite good. It is basically a bar with seating but the food is pretty top notch. Had the fish soup, blintzes, latkes, piroshky, and salad.  Infused horseradish vodka was well done.  This place, like other Russian spots, however, definitely is skimpy on the price to food quantity ratio.  Yes, things are well done and yes this is New York, but I think you can bump up the portions a little to make everyone happy.",5.0
The sweetest Russian owner ever. Very cultural experience to learn about the food. Food often uses vodka in cooking. Service 5 stars. Food 4 stars. Want a good time and cultural experience. Highly recommended.,5.0
"Ordered from Grub Hub and they called to say something was not available but I could switch it for anything else no matter the price:)Then they even added a free strudel!Food was Awesome, delicious! Friendly delivery guy who seemed like an owner? He was not young and was Russian...part of the family? Will definitely order again:)",5.0

"What an awesome bar/restaurant. The owner is super friendly and passionate, he infuses his own vodkas, Russian, and they are amazing. Try the ginger, super smooth and full of flavor. Very nice beer selection too. Great atmosphere, music selection is groovy and relaxing, not too loud. Worth the visit.",5.0
"Awesome!!! First off, this is the best Russian Food I've ever had (in a restaurant). I've eaten at many around Brooklyn and the city and hands down, it's just like Mommas cooking. We had a salad and borscht to start. DELICIOUS. I had the blini with mushroom and chicken. THAT SAUCE THO. Some places the sauce is way to salty, but this place is completely on point. I loved it. I didn't offer to share to anyone because I loved it so much. Grace was our server and even though she was swamped she was beyond sweet. Vitality (The owner and Russian wrestler) was very cool and helped serve in his own place. Obviously kind guy and very polite. I 100% will drive all the way here from Staten Island again and again. Thank you!!",5.0

"Fantastic. I ate here 2 weeks ago and me and my friend are still raving about this place. Very warm and personalized, gracious service. This was the first time ever that I had a vodka infused with horseradish (suggested by our server) paired excellently with our pelmeni dumplings. The food is stupid good... Like really stupid good.... Like it will slap you in the face, make you look away from your phone, and focus on the food and your company. I wish the best for this restaurant because they deserve to go far. Highly recommended this place :)",5.0
Excellent authentic Russian food.  Wonderful and friendly wait staff even when they were busy well beyond there normal capacity everyone was still friendly and the owner took the time to talk with us and explain the origin of two dishes.I highly recommend this restaurant but be patient and have a few shots of infused vodka.,5.0
"There's a lovely Russian couple, Masha and Vitaly, opening up hipster joints with Russian sensibility all over Williamsburg. First was Beer Boutique, my beer boutique of choice. Second was ""Masha and the Bear"", a beer bar/Russian restaurant on Grand Street. I went there today for the first time to find a completely hipster clientele, an ultra-tattooed bartender serving a wide selection of craft beers, a large blackboard drawing of deep-fried watermelons and cucumbers in the shape of a penis and scrotum (that comes from Russian sensibility, not hipster sensibility), and a short stout Russian lady in the kitchen serving up a pretty decent Russian food menu. There were some odd art pieces of woodsy landscapes hung crookedly on the walls, and an ironic neon ""Open"" sign in the back of the store where no one on the street could see it. While enjoying my Bronx Belgian Pale Ale, I heard a shrill voice behind me say ""isn't it great that the greatest existential threat to face our parents has now been reduced to a cute aesthetic choice???"" I had the immediate urge to go over there, splash my craft beer in his face, and respond with ""fuck you and your parents! America has been the greatest existential threat to everyone else and their parents for a long time and there's been no reduction of that!"" But then again, my parents had an ""if we can't beat 'em, join 'em"" mentality and we've been happier ever after. Still... fuck that guy.",5.0

"A must visit bar, love this place, one of the top 5 bar in Williamsburg. The food was great on top of that the customer service was just on point and the mimosa man I can't even describe.

"We were in the neighborhood for Then She Fell and my boyfriend picked this restaurant mostly based on the name, but we got excited when we saw the great reviews. As we approached, I was a little surprised by the non-existent decor. The wood paneling is nice, but beyond that, there's nothing to make it cozy or charming at all. It feels a bit unfinished and the chairs are awkwardly low in relation to the table (ok, nitpicky, but we both noticed it). To start we ordered the Single Cut Bon Pale Ale and Putin's Ganja (cocktail) and an order of boiled potato vareniki. The beer ended up being the highlight of the meal for my boyfriend, but I'm pretty sure the ""secret"" ingredient in my cocktail was Sprite. The vareniki were tasty and served with fresh dill. They were out of the golubtzi (stuffed cabbage) which was the only entree my boyfriend could eat as a vegetarian, so he got the shopska salad, which ended up being a bowl of cucumbers, tomatoes, onions, and feta in an inch of oil. As a guy at another table who made the same mistake put it, ""I could have made this."" I guess the question is, but did you make it and then sell it to people for $14? Nope, Masha and the Bear has got you beat on that. I had the beef stroganoff which was tough and tasted somehow gamey to me. The service, however, was quite friendly and fast, so it's got that going for it. Overall, I'd say most of the food is priced about $5 higher than it should be, but even at those lower prices, I definitely would not go back.",2.0
"The place looks inviting, mostly because of its wooden looks. A good amount of comedy also lightens up the place, so does the natural smell. The menu has everything I like about Russian food including blitzes, Potato pancakes, and dumplets(dumplings). It's a happy place :D",5.0
"I went to this place just by noticing it in the neighborhood, didn't read a NY times article so no preconceived notion, just excited for some Russian food nearby.  We had cold soups on a hot day that were so good and super authentic!  We also had the Chicken Tabaka also which was very good, could have been a bit crispier but we split it and so filling!  This place is definitely new, some things to work on.  But I am excited to go back and be a regular, I'm sure it will only get better with time!",5.0
I don't often write reviews but I was incredibly impressed with the food as well as the service.  I ordered delivery and everything was so tasty and I could tell the ingredients were fresh.  The owner is amazing and truly cares about his customers.  I will most certainly be ordering from here again.  A+++++,5.0

They are very reasonably priced and the service is world class.

I had the stuffed cabbage and the dumplings they were so good.  Can't wait to go back.  The owner introduced himself and fixed a wobble on the table.  I am of Polish and Ukrainian decent so the food is similar and reminded me so much of home cooking.  My friend had the stew I think he was impressed.  I had one of the special vodka drinks which was so good.  I will be back soon with my aunt I think she will feel she is back in the old country.",5.0

"I'm not a big Yelp reviewer, but want to second and third all the other 5 star reviews. Bf was skeptical about ""Russian gastropub"" but is now a big fan. Good vibes, good beer and of course vodka, and most important, everything we've tried has been super tasty, and a little different from anything else you can find in the area.",5.0
"Awesome small gem. Great food and service. And ummm vodka on tap. On. Tap. Recommend the tzar's fish soup, pirogues (boiled or fried), Cornish hen.",5.0
went for a lazy rainy late afternoon lunch. met the owner who was super pleasant and incredibly knowledgable about the history of each dish they offer. the food was deee'lish (and I am russian so I have a basis for comparison) but it was the overall experience that put the place over the top for me. can't wait to go back!,5.0
"The second I learned that there is a new Russian restaurant opened in the neighborhood I got super excited!! I went to try the place right away and Oh Myyyyyy!!! It is so so so so good!!I love Russian food so much and this place has the best menu with the most delicious food there is and their cooks make their food with so much love - it's incredible!I can't say what's better because everything I've tried so far was absolutely delicious. There is herring under the fur coat, golubtzi, sirniki, blinchiki, pelmeshki, all sorts of yummy stuff. They have great beer selection and infused vodkas, which Vitalij - the owner - infuses himself.""Masha and the Bear"" totally worth a visit! Whether you are Russian and missing home cooked food, or you are a food enthusiast, or you are just hungry and craving something fresh and delicious - go there!! And be ready to become obsessed (like I am :) and come beck there all the time.Na zdorovie!!",5.0
"I love this place! There aren't enough good Russian restaurants and I'm so glad that Masha & the Bear is walking distance from my place! First of all, I was dining with my wife who is from Siberia, where I have been several times, so we both know good Russian food. The pelmeni was homemade and very good. My wife had the beef stroganoff which was amazing. I'm getting that next time! I had the beer braised lamb shank, which was also delicious. I also recognized the owner, who owns Beer Boutique as well, which is why the beers on tap at Masha & the Bear are just amazing. Since he was there, I was able to get personal recommendations by an expert. I usually hate beer selections wherever I go, but last night... wow. I had the Mexican Cake, which is off the hook. I'm going to be a regular at this place just for the beer. And I didn't even mention the infused vodka on tap yet! It does more of a bar feel to it than a restaurant, so it's not a very fancy place. But that makes it even better. More of an excuse to have Russian food more often. I'm excited to go back soon.",5.0
"Great beer list that seems like it will be getting new and interesting stuff on draft pretty frequently! Had the Siberian pelmeni (dumplings!), potato pancakes and spinach borscht. All really delicious, great drinking food in this cold weather. Can't wait to come back and try an entree. Had a pepper and honey vodka too, on tap--cold and smooth!",5.0
"If you love cumin, flat beer, and New York Times hyped up quality. This is the place for you.",2.0
"I heard that this place was going to try to elevate casual Russian dining a bit, but I was skeptical. I was half expecting diner-level cooking (Brighton Beach) where quantity trumps quality, but I was happy to find that the food is fairly refined. I had the borscht on an earlier visit and found it to be really well done, very flavorful, authentic. Based on that good experience, my gal and I went to Masha for dinner. Russian Beet Spread: fresh, flavorful, great appetizer. Herring Suba: delicious layers of beets, potato, herring. Fish Soup: light, flavorful broth, with tasty chunks of fish. Mushroom Golubtzi stuffed cabbage: the most delicate version of this dish I've ever tasted. The Dirty Borscht cocktail (like a Bloody Mary) was fantastic, and I found it hard to stop ordering the Horseradish Vodka shots. They have a really good selection of craft (local) beer on draught, too. Not too pricey. I'll definitely return.",5.0
