"This restaurant really deserves the best ratings. Their service, staff, and food were very exceptional. My friends and I were in the area and I had my dog with me that day. Unfortunately dogs aren't allowed in restaurants and it was way way too cold to sit outside to eat. I went inside the restaurant and spoke with the waitress regarding my dog to see if there were any options. Unfortunately there wasn't much we can do but she spent a good 5 minutes with me trying to figure out what we could do. In the end, we tied her up right outside the restaurant by their huge window and she made sure to sit us right by the window so we can watch her. They even gave her water and kept her company here and there! The service was really amazing at Rabbithole. They were very attentive and made sure we were serviced correctly. The food was also really amazing. I ordered their white bean veggie burger- wow was that yummy! The bun was so fresh and the burger itself you can tell was made in-house. You can see all of the veggies in there. My friend got the stuffed French toast. It was made fresh fresh in-house brioche bread stuffed with strawberry marscapone. It tastes even better than it sounds; if that's even possible! My other friends got the sweet potato soup as well as the quinoa and wild rice salad. Both amazing options! The soup was a bit creamy so you couldn't finish it. But it still tastes amazing. In the end everyone gave me their leftovers ;)Can't wait to go back. Love this place!",5.0
"Breakfast sandwich was meh: tiny omelet with measly pieces of bacon, some cheese, and soft eggs.  tomato jam was a nice touch but overall, the sandwich was mushy all over and just not a good time.Burger: also meh. dry and just didn't pack the necessary flavor.Cute venue, wish I ordered better (or they just made better food).",2.0
"I'm always impressed by this spot - been here a good number of times now and haven't had a single poor experience. This is a tiny little spot located in lovely South Wililamsburg. They have a decent amount of seating within and at the bar -- and it extends further outside where you can seat a few parties in a garden area (definitely would opt for this, especially in our wonderful summer weather at the moment).The decor is very cool (Alice in Wonderland-y) and will ensnare your attention for a nice little chunk of time. Food is completely on the mark. I've been here a number of times now, up to seven or eight times total! As it is conveniently located near me in the wonderful South Williy area. I'm proud to say I've dabbled in 70%+ of the menu and have never had a bad experience ever! Everything is tasty and tastes exactly as it should, if not better. Drinks are totally on the money and will help your boozy brunch experiences. Definitely snatch a scone while you're here too!Great service too. They're all friendly -- all smiles and very attentive.",5.0
"Even after a year, I still think about this herbed biscuit. And it just pisses me off because I can't have it, but if you are in Brooklyn looking for brunch -- THIS BISCUIT COULD BE YOURS! We sat on the quaint, charming little patio on a nice fall day. Our server was hilarious and perfect in every way. We ordered up some coffee, and the steak and eggs to split (since we were culinary hopping that day). The steak was succulent and flavorful. And we enjoyed being surrounded by all the beautiful ivy in the back. After visiting 47 places in 3 days in NYC - this house made herbed biscuit was in my top 5 for best things I ate. Stop looking, and start eating.",5.0
"Really cute spot that you allllmost miss walking past, but (as my sister and I did) a second glance had us turned in our tracks and we're so glad we did! Rabbithole is dark, cute, dimly lit with candles. Exactly what we were looking for Thursday night. Not a minute's wait even! The service is very good. We didn't try their cocktails (we opted for a bottle of wine), but I will be sure to next time; it looks like that is what they specialize in. We had the octopus starter (devine!), sister had the lamb burger, and I had the salmon. We also tried the early grey creme brulee (so so good) for dessert. I would order everything we had again! Great gem!",4.0
"Totes a fan! Had a smashing brunch here. For starters, I love that they do not have a huge menu, so it's pretty easy to find exactly what you want to eat. That vibe though. Total hipster, Williamsburg, retro awesomeness. We ordered a couple of brunch items and everything was absolutely phenomenal. Especially the french toast. They put mascarpone in the middle like a sandwich! Total foodgasm right there. Drinks were absolute perfection too, and server was friendly, helpful and really nice. I can't wait to go back and have another smashing brunch.",4.0
"Where have you been all my life RabbitHole ?!  I've actually looked up this restaurant by the recommendation of a fellow yelper and have been meaning to give it a try-- today, my boyfriend and I just happened to be in the area and it couldn't be more perfect. The spot itself is adorable, on the small side (I can imagine it getting super crowed) but a really lovely intimate spot. I'm a huge sucker for their rustic decor. They also have a small outdoor area which I could imagine being lovely in the warm weather. Service is top notice! Really genuinely friendly staff that check up on you periodically without being annoying. Overall just very pleasant staff.I ordered the sweet potatoes soup (I believe was in the $7 range) and it was heaven !! Super creamy and filling. I also ordered the homemade herb biscuit which made an excellent pairing side to the soup. The biscuit was very fresh, fully and light hint of herb.My boyfriend ordered their super juicey burger which was oversalted but I'm willing to look past that. French fries were fresh and the burger was also served with a little side of pickled vegetables. We split the beet goat cheese salad and the only thing I regret about it is that I had to share it with my date. It was outstanding ! Cubes of fresh beets with a light blueberry dressing and mixed blueberries, topped with a few pieces of blue cheese. One of the best salads that I have ever had hands down. Overall, I could rave about the RabbitHole for hours. I can't wait to return.",5.0
"I ordered Rabbithole Florentine, it contained salad, potatoes, toast and eggs. But, its amount was so less, I think, considering its price.! It is not so cheap. It tasted soso.I think I should visit here again, and try other food. my mind can be changed after that.",3.0
"Great food and atmosphere but service sucked. Had the open pork belly sandwich and a lemon poppy seed scone which were divine. I really like the sandwich, I have never had an open face pork belly sandwich before and I would definitely recommend that.",3.0
"Came here for brunch before 12pm and we were lucky to be seated right away. The house made lemon poppyseed scone was just ok. The Egg Norwegian was ok - the eggs were a bit over cooked. The Egg White Frittata was pretty good, especially the crispy part at the bottom! It wasn't greasy nor plain. We noticed that the waiting line got longer after 12pm. So come early with smaller size of party since the restaurant is pretty small.",4.0

"I have a soft spot in my heart for Rabbithole because this is the first restaurant I ate at when I moved to Williamsburg a few years ago, and it's where my fiance (now husband) had brunch to celebrate our engagement. It's also where we had breakfast before heading to city hall for our civil ceremony. I love the decor inside, and when it's warm out, they have a back patio. It can get pretty crowded with the weekend brunch rush so we try to get there by 10.We had dinner the first time, and it was great, but for some reason we're always craving their brunch. Husband always gets the steak and eggs. Once he got the stuffed french toast which was amazingly delicious, but a little too rich for us. I usually get the egg sandwich (add the potatoes, they are SO good) or the yogurt with granola. The best thing on the menu that a lot of people probably overlook are the scones. They are the most amazing scones in the world. They are even more amazing when they are straight out of the oven. We always get the blueberry one, and they are so good that I sometimes pick them up for my aunt that lived in England for 15 yrs.",5.0
"Hard to say no to outdoor seating, bloody Mary's and eggs Benedict...Ok, first, as always, most important: the Benedict.  Came together nicely. Well poached eggs.  Bacon was tasty, Hollandaise was a little different - not as lemony as some - but still quite creamy and nice. Good biscuit.  Very good bloodies.Outdoor back patio with dappled light.  Need I say more?Not busy at all on a Wednesday morning around 11am.",4.0

"I came here for my best friend's birthday with our closest friend. Upon coming here, there was already a wait, with about 3 couples ahead of us. Luckily for us, the hostess told us our seats would be ready in 10-15 minutes. A group of three that came after us was told that their wait time was about 35-40 minutes. About 15 minutes later, we were seated all the way in the back, right in front of the kitchen, in the middle of the room. Personally, I found my area fairly cramped, as the place was pretty much a long hallway from the entrance. As the waitresses were walking, they continuously kept walking into my elbow which got a little irritating.I ordered the Eggs Norwegian, which included two poached eggs on top of a layer of lox salmon, and herbed biscuits with a side of seasoned diced potatoes and a mixed green salad. One of my best friends ordered the stuffed french toast which included two french toast slices stacked up with mascarpone filling in between, topped with two strawberries and decorated beautifully with powdered sugar and maple syrup. Lastly, since the birthday boy is a vegetarian he ordered the white bean burger which included a white bean patty, a slice of cucumber and zucchini with a side of mixed greens.My personal favorite was the seasoned diced potatoes which had the perfect texture and seasoning. There as an even amount of spices added as well as it had the perfect amount of salt. My second favorite was the stuffed french toast. My best friend and I had split our orders to diversify our palettes. The french toast was not too heavy even with the mascarpone. However, I did wish they added more syrup and berries.Food: overall the food was good (diced potatoes was AWESOME) though a bit pricey for the portionAppearance: pretty narrow, extremely crowded for a Sunday afternoon, hated getting hit in the elbow while I was eating though.Service: friendly service, waitress came around only when convenient (get water, serve food, clean off finished food)Price: pretty pricey for the portion ($15-$30)Initially, I thought this place would like one of the Alice's Tea Cup Chapters which had terrific food. Because of the comparison, I was sort of disappointed in the food  that it did not match up with my hype. Overall, I think it is an okay place to eat if you are ever in the Williamsburg area.",4.0

Was lucky enough to just beat the brunch crowd at 11:30. The wait was out the door by the time we were seated. My friends and I were seated inside but thank goodness it wasn't stuffy and hot. There was a fan going which kept the air circulating. I didn't get a chance to look at the outdoor seating in the back but my friend said it looked super cute. The service took a little long and we had to wait a bit to get our orders in and then a longer wait for our food. By the time we got our food we were all famished and hungry. All four of us ordered something different so that we can taste everything. I got the Rabbithole Florentine and okay so it may have been my fault since I did not read what this dish actually entails. lol The potatoes are on point! You will not be disappointed. The salad on the side was tasty and refreshing. The florentine itself was okay. It wasn't amazing i liked the spinach and the caramelized onions. The bread used was also not super heavy and easy to cut through. The egg however was over cooked. The yoke was fully cooked and unappetizing. I ended up leaving both egg yokes on the plate while finishing everything else.The stuffed french toast was BOMB! I was secretly jealous and wished that had been my dish instead. The mascarpone worked well and made the dish a little less sweet but the addition of powdered sugar and maple syrup appeals to anyone with a sweet tooth.,3.0

"We came here on a Busy Sunday day, Brunch. The line was ridiculous. But the nice hostess,my curiosity and hunger made me stay. Although the place was super packed, we got a table within 20 mins. The server was very professional, courteous, but short.. I get it she was extremely busy. Me and my  friend ordered The Hot Chocolate and Mimosas( Haha.. Weird) the Chocolate was delicious. Then we ordered the food. My friend had the Egg white frittata and I had the Steak and eggs. And Oh my, Great choice. The steak was tender, delicious and perfectly cooked. The chimichurri on the side was Top notch. The eggs were good and the Salad was fresh. My friend devoured the Frittata within 2 mins.

I was completely satisfied with the food and the really good service. My wife had the eggs benedict and enjoyed and my firend had the smoke salmon omlette and also enjoyed.For me not cheap and not expensive. $12 hamburger, $11 omlette, $11 eggs benedict and $3 lemonades.I recommend for brunch and will def be back to try other dishes.",4.0
"Arrived here for a brunch with three girlfriends on Sunday 11:30 am right before the brunch crowd started filling up the place. We decided on different brunch options so we can try multiple things together and share. They gave us more than enough time to decide, to the point we were getting a little impatient. When we were finally tended to, we ordered the Rabbithole Florentine, the Eggs Benedict, the Eggs Norwegian, and the Stuffed French Toast.The wait for food was also a little longer than we would have liked. But it was Sunday, so maybe I'll have a better experience another time. My Eggs Benedict came with a side of salad and potatoes. The salad was refreshing and I appreciate a salad that isn't drenched in dressing. The potatoes were also delicious, crispy on the outside, well seasoned, yum yum. The generous portion of spiced bacon had a wonderful hint of sweetness to it. However, I was not too happy with my eggs. I expected poached eggs and not well done eggs. I definitely think someone else also mentioned this in their review. They should pay attention to the timing of the eggs as it seems to be inconsistent.My friends also enjoyed their food and I had a bite of the Stuffed French Toast, which was heavenly!

I was there for brunch and shared the lamb burger and the marscapone stuffed french toast with my cousin. My other family had the pancakes and the lox baguette.

"It's worth the wait, which moved along quickly. They fit a lot of people in this railroad-style restaurant without inducing claustrophobia. There is seating in the front, plenty of stools at the bar, and seats in the back room. The staff are a breath of fresh air. The place is decorated really nicely, in a rustic, quaint sort of way. Now down to the important details: grab a hot chocolate, which can be modified with any milk. It's frothy and not too sweet; they mix their own powder. There are really unique breakfast beverages too.The pancakes were thick and more dense than fluffy; however, they were still moist and delicious. Adding to that factor was the flavored butter- can't go wrong there. Only problem was I thought I ordered the special pancake on the menu (spiced ginger, pears, and walnuts), but they tasted more lemony. That could have been a miscommunication. The egg white frittata was served in the cast iron skillet it was clearly cooked in, based on the scalding handle. The eggs are fluffy on the inside, crisp on the outside, and loaded with veggies. To moderate the healthiness, the frittata is topped with a nice gooey layer of cheese and a buttery-fried slice of thick, house-made brioche. Rabbithole has so many intriguing items in their menu; I just can't wait to return.",5.0
"This is a block away so the bf and I end up here pretty much every Sunday for brunch. Never had to wait more then 10 mins for a table even though it's always pretty crowded (although we usually do roll in around 4), and the back patio area is lovely. Good bloody marys, and I don't even like tomato juice. Hot chocolate was only ok. The BLT is actually great, as is the french dip, lentil soup, eggs benedict and stuffed french toast (minor complaint was too much filling so the ratio is off by end and it gets a little soggy). The Croque Madame is absurd, I want to marry one of these and have its babies and then eat them. I keep saying I'm going to order something else and then I almost never do. The fries it comes with are great too - ask for mayo with them.Only been to dinner here a couple times but the mussels were really good and so were the pasta and the roast chicken.",5.0

Rabbithole has so many intriguing items in their menu; I just can't wait to return.",5.0
"This is a block away so the bf and I end up here pretty much every Sunday for brunch. Never had to wait more then 10 mins for a table even though it's always pretty crowded (although we usually do roll in around 4), and the back patio area is lovely. Good bloody marys, and I don't even like tomato juice. Hot chocolate was only ok. The BLT is actually great, as is the french dip, lentil soup, eggs benedict and stuffed french toast (minor complaint was too much filling so the ratio is off by end and it gets a little soggy). The Croque Madame is absurd, I want to marry one of these and have its babies and then eat them. I keep saying I'm going to order something else and then I almost never do. The fries it comes with are great too - ask for mayo with them.Only been to dinner here a couple times but the mussels were really good and so were the pasta and the roast chicken.",5.0
"Saturday, 12:00pm, two people. Atmosphere: small place, but very cozy, and not too loud considering. My sister and I waited 15min for a table by the window. Food: The egg white frittata was LOADED with veggies. And to rave about toast sounds silly, but it was one of my favorite parts of the meal. The lemon pancakes themselves weren't anything special, but the lemon butter they were served with was to die for. The pancakes could've been fluffier and had more walnuts; there was about two walnuts per pancake (not that I counted...). The salted hot chocolate was perfect for the rainy day. And, if you ask, they can make it with almond, soy, or whole milk. Staff: our waitress was a delight. She was attentive but not overbearing and even wrapped my leftovers very well since I was traveling. Bathroom: very clean. Good soap :).",5.0
"Good brunch experience on a Sunday. We got here at 1:30, and the wait time was about 25minutes.Croquet madam:delicious, very filling and overall very good. I wish the ham was a little better, but that's me being picky. The bread was very good, and the sunny side egg was done well.Rabbit hole chai: I have very high expectations for chai, and it was decent. I think the chai spice was a little too overpowering, but pretty good compared to other places I've been to.We got the seat against the window-the restaurant is pretty small, and I wish we got to sit in the patio. There were people leaning against the window, actually pushing our table a bit so that was annoying. Next time I'll have to ask for a patio seat.",4.0
"This place is amazing. My husband and I went there a couple of months ago on a Saturday evening for dinner. It was still early in the evening so there were plenty of places to sit. We were sat in the perfect place at a window by the patio (it had rained earlier so everything was wet) and that alone made me look forward to what was coming next. The food was INCREDIBLE. I had the hanger steak - delicious. He had the striped bass.We were really pleased with the casual and cozy ambience and perfectly seasoned food. The service was slightly slow as the place got busier, but no real complaints on that!",5.0
The menu is fine. A lot of the dishes were salty. I'm not sure what the hype is all about. My friends got the Norwegian eggs and said that the dish was super salty. While some others who got the same thing said the bacon was very sweet. This place seems a little inconsistent. Everything is just over seasoned and the flavored aren't delicate enough really enjoy the dish,3.0
Really cool place... I loved coming for here for dinner with friends. The place is super cool and the service and food was excellent.

"Of all the places I went to eat at in my new York trip, Rabbit Hole was my favorite. Not only are you greeted with a warm smile but the service is great and associates are attentive, and as a tourist, we appreciate that! The burgers are cooked to perfection with juicy and crisp patties and what seems to be home made buns, and fresh lettuce! &  the fries were seasoned percently and were absolutely delicious. The waffles also look exquisite if I may add! Definitely would come back if I visit nyc again, hands down the best food I had out there! You would not regret eating here!Only downside is that there isn't many drink selections! ( ex: juice)",4.0
Had brunch here and was somewhat disappointed with their steak and eggs. The skirt stake was cooked perfectly but the taste was sour and a bit off. Coffee was great.,3.0
Overall quality of the food was very good but a bit on the salty side. I had the lamb burger and it was great. The omelette was great too!The reason I am giving three stars is because the waitress asked us to vacate the table only five minutes after finishing our meals (still having coffee in our mugs)! I am European but lived here for many years. This was not acceptable.I would recommend it to someone though.,3.0

"This place was ok for me.We came here on a whim and got a seat at the edge of a shared couch right before the entrance to the outside patio. The lighting was dim and romantic. We had the artichoke fritters as our appetizer and I thought they were pretty good. The bf was ok with them. For our entree, I ended up ordering the pan roasted cod and the bf had roasted chicken. He enjoyed his entree while I wasn't sure how I felt about the cod. The fish was good, but the mix of things on this plate actually upset my stomach (artichoke, yogurt, grape tomatoes and potatoes). We thought about dessert, but we were finishing up and noticed that they were almost closing so we didn't want to keep them.I wouldn't mind coming back to try the brunch, lunch or sandwiches and maybe change my view.",3.0
"Loved the rustic wonderland atmosphere. The staff was lovely. Highlight of this place was definitely their scones - moist and flavorful, not too sweet or dry. It seems all their baked goods are pretty special judging from the other reviews but I thought the apple cake was just alright (definitely go for the scones instead). I also got the eggs Benedict - hollandaise was too thick for my liking, the eggs over cooked and not runny, but the muffin was good. The side potatoes were seasoned and delicious. I would come to this place to eat scones and have a drink with friends, not so much as a place to have a full breakfast.",4.0
Came here for brunch. The Rabbithole is actually not as small as it sounds. It's a bit of a narrow space but sizable and can accommodate small grounds of 4 or 6.

"Fearing a long wait, a friend and I decided to come to Rabbithole at noon (which is like 6 a.m. for Williamsburg amiright?!). And sure enough we got a seat in the main dining room in less than 10 minutes. Whoop!We started off with drinks, trying the Gardener, Bloody Mary and Grandaddy's Lemonade. All get the Brooklyn brunch boozy stamp of approval, and are fairly priced at $8.Next up, we shared a scone. If you're getting a savory brunch item, I highly recommend this. I saw them the moment we entered the restaurant and couldn't stop thinking about their flakey dopeness until I had a bite. Worth it!As for the main course, I went with the highly recommended eggs Benedict. The potatoes were amazing, the side salad perfect. And the eggs? Awesome. Perfectly poached beauties sat atop a bed of bacon and herbed biscuit, drizzled with the finest hollandaise. I could eat it every day of my life.Overall, the service here made me feel like a VIP and I'd absolutely come back at noon or earlier.

I love brunch . And now I love this place . They have all day brunch and hands down the best Bloody Mary . It's a small little quaint place in Williamsburg so expect hipsters but the food is brilliant . We had the last blueberry scone and it was delightful . Very soft and had a tint of lime . I had the Rabbithole Florentine which had perfectly cooked eggs but the potatoes oh the potatoes !! My husband had the eggs Benedict and again the star of the show were the potatoes !

I was there for brunch. Their brunch menu was limited and didn't allow you to creat your own omlet since their ingredients were also limited. They didn't serve sausage even though they say their brunch menu was famous. I left the place saying I would come back for dinner since the waitres who came up to take my order was kind.,2.0
"I used to live around the corner many years ago and although many things have changed in the neighborhood, this place is still the same. I was very happy to see that they are still making those wonderful scones every morning! Many flavors such as poppy seed, chocolate, etc, but hands down the best is the apricot scone. Light fluffy crumbly goodness with chunky apricot jam mixed through it. I guess you could get a full breakfast, but new BBurg residents wishing to endear themselves to their roommates would be wise to bring some scones back for the house one morning.",5.0

I was there for brunch. Their brunch menu was limited and didn't allow you to creat your own omlet since their ingredients were also limited. They didn't serve sausage even though they say their brunch menu was famous. I left the place saying I would come back for dinner since the waitres who came up to take my order was kind.,2.0
"I used to live around the corner many years ago and although many things have changed in the neighborhood, this place is still the same. I was very happy to see that they are still making those wonderful scones every morning! Many flavors such as poppy seed, chocolate, etc, but hands down the best is the apricot scone. Light fluffy crumbly goodness with chunky apricot jam mixed through it. I guess you could get a full breakfast, but new BBurg residents wishing to endear themselves to their roommates would be wise to bring some scones back for the house one morning.",5.0
This might have been the best burger in Williamsburg. Pro tip: add red onion and the herb aioli.The service and ambiance are great and the wine was lovely.My only criticism was the cheese plate. It was good but not great.,5.0
Great great food - awesome eggs Benedict wether salmon or bacon- scones are the best I've ever had - so moist. If your in te area you have to try this place!!  Cute atmosphere with worn in rustic vibe.,5.0
"Great great Brunch. The egg white fritatta that comes in the skillet is a must. Be careful because it's pretty hot! The bread is also the star of the dish.Very nice place, hipster and with a beautiful garden.",4.0

"Yummmm can't go wrong with a brunch restaurant. I love the eggs florentine! The potatoes were a plus and the salad on the side hit the spot.

"Pretty standard brunch place.  I live around the corner and am not really clear why there is always a line during brunch, but it is still really good.  Cozy interior.  Service was good, but almost too fast as if they are trying to usher people through.  Solid Bloody Mary and good Norwegian Benedict.

My first taste in what will be my next neighborhood. 7/18 I started walking down Bedford opened the Yelp app and it was the closest place with four stars.  It was crowded.  I sat at the bar to avoid a wait.   I had a coffee (good coffee) and a lamb burger (very good).  It had a cucumber salad with it that was delicious.  The greeter Clint was very friendly.  The service was excellent.,4.0
"We came on a Monday night and were seated in a quiet corner in the back. We had the chicken, the steak, a boozy chai, and a spiked cider.

"I have never tasted such delicious eggs Benedict in my life. Where do they get their bacon from? I need it every day of my life. I split the eggs Benedict with my sister, neither of us can ever finish a meal. My sister didn't want to split a scone, so I got a scone all alone. When my lemon poppyseed scone came, she took a corner. Then she took the whole scone. Then she ordered a bag of scones to go. Yes the scones are that good.I've been going to the bagel place across the street for months, and I'm kicking myself for only going to Rabbithole 2 weeks before I move out of the city. Go here. Get bacon. Give it to me.",5.0
"I love cafes like this one. Simple, comfy, relaxing, with a vibe of a garden bistro. It was raining, so we could not go for backyard seating, but dining area is very cozy.Enjoying breeze from patio doors, light talk going on with few laughs - nothing can be better. This place is perfect for relaxing evening like that...Nicely done drinks with few daily specials. Black margarita was one of those - mezcal, hornitos, lemon and blackberry syrup - who can say no to good mezcal?Now, lets talk food.There is one thing that *must try* on menu (altho all food here is amazing). Lamb burger. It is freaking delicious! The burger itself cooked perfectly, topped with smooth, tangy and salty mix that is feta and yogurt based, on most perfect, slightly toasted house-made bun.

"Where has this eggs Benedict been my whole life??? Seriously, how does an eggs Benedict lover, such as myself, go about life, brunch after brunch, just getting a mediocre Benedict only to find the Benedict of my dreams in a hole in the wall restaurant in Brooklyn? Clearly the eggs Benedict gods were looking out for me and, with a little help from Yelp (ha!) I discovered Rabbithole. On our last day on a week long vacation in New York, my friend and I wanted to unwind with brunch in the classy, oh-so-hip Williamsburg neighborhood. Rabbithole had been listed as some of the best brunch in this neighborhood, and the menu and prices looked pretty appetizing, so we gave it a shot. The restaurant was extremely cute. A tad (or a lot) hipster, for sure, but still darling, with vintage fixtures and furniture, and a lovely patio out back to provide some greenery. As mentioned above, I clearly ordered the best eggs Benedict of my life. What made it so special? It started with a perfectly soft, buttery herbed biscuit. Not dried out whatsoever, it made the perfect bed for the Benedict toppings. Then there was a healthy layering of spiced bacon, a huge plus for me in terms of Benedict because a Benedict with bacon is infinitely better than any other kind. Plus, the bacon was perfectly crisp, salty, sweet and slightly spicy. Then there were some perfectly poached eggs. I can't tell you how many times I've gone out to brunch and have ordered eggs Benedict and have had either over or under poached eggs. It's absurd. Not these though, they were a vision. Lastly, the hollandaise. Oh, where do I begin? It was buttery, lemony, slightly tangy and there was a healthy ladle full on each biscuit. Nothing is worse than having a Benedict with too little of hollandaise. NOTHING. As if the Benedict wasn't perfect enough, it was served with a lovely, lightly dressed green salad for freshness and the crispiest, most perfectly seasoned breakfast potatoes. Considering it was my last meal in the Big Apple, it was absolutely divine. I couldn't have asked for a better sendoff.",5.0

"Came here for breakfast earlier today. I think we even walked in just as they were opening. The space itself it's set up like a bar/bistro. As I am not really one to judge a place on the aesthetic it doesn't matter too much. After sitting we had ordered coffee. Now as a caffeine junkie I always get upset when restaurants give me cups that are so small I'm done after two sips. Especially when they continue refilling it. Truthfully I think they refilled my cup at least 5 times while we were there. However, might be the only downside to the entire meal. I had ordered the Croque Madame. Which if you've never heard of it is a glorified grilled ham and cheese, but so much more. I am a sucker for anything with béchamel and Gruyere. The sandwich itself was amazing not too heavy and just the right amount of savory. Too many times you'll order this from a place and you can barely eat it because they load it up and you can't tastes the levels of flavor. My friend ordered the rabbit hole florintine and devoured it in minutes. At one point I caught the smell of their roasted potatoes was a bit upset I had fries instead. Still good though. For the table we ordered the stuffed french toasted. Extra thick cuts of brioche with strawberry mascarpone in the center. Definitely something to share for a bit of sweetness to a more savory brunch. I would suggest asking for a bit more mascarpone because we still had a bit of the brioche left but none of the stuffing. Also the bacon. They don't tell you on the menu but there is something wildly magical about the bacon. They coat it in a smokey mesquite bbq syrup. It isn't greasy like regular bacon but more sticky, delicious none the less. I would highly recommend coming here and the great thing is they serve these items everyday of the week. So no more waiting for weekend brunch to get your fix.",5.0

"I've been here in summer 2012 when there was a long line just after opening and the atmosphere was electric - what a weird word to use for brunch!

Maybe the same but I expect way too much from these places (Mogador and Lafayette in Manhattan come to mind).First of all - if you come with a few friends, make sure that everyone gets there at the same time. If you're 3 and the 4th person is on the way, you'll have to wait to be seated. For as long as it takes.The food we ordered was really quite good, nothing extraordinary with my Eggs on a baguette, but enjoyable. All other (vegetarian) items were tasty as well, with the frittata being served in the pan - which is cool. I wouldn't order the latte, the coffee was burnt and there are a few outstanding coffee shops nearby, so I'd stick with the food and enjoy the Brooklyn vibe.

"Rabbithole has a lot of mixed reviews here, and I can see why. If I could, I'd give them 3.5 stars, but overall it was a more positive than negative experience (and there seem to be a few very contentious reviews here) so I'll round up.The decor is great (albeit a bit dark). There's a backyard (a shame that it was too cold to dine out there when I went). They were playing indie hits from 2011 on the stereo.As a first course, we had the crispy pork belly. It was in a thin pumpkin seed/oil sauce. But there was so much of it, that it seemed like a soup or a puree. Except it was very bland and watery. Not sure what they were going for there, but they should either give you less sauce/thicken it up, or give it more texture and flavor. Maybe add some crushed walnuts or something. Anyway, the pork was good. Somehow still stayed crispy despite being covered in liquid.My first cocktail was one with chili infused whiskey and passionfruit. it wasn't very good. There was spice to it, sure, but no depth. Very bland. they should've added more whiskey, or thrown some Luxardo or Cointreau or something into it.My second cocktail was one with gin, cucumber, lemon and ginger. That one was a lot better (and also featured all of my favorite cocktail ingredients).For my entree, I had the pan seared striped bass was pretty good. Crispy skin, cooked perfectly. Came with a lot of quinoa and corn as a base. I also tried my friend's cod with fingerlings and yogurt sauce, and it was also pretty good.Where they earn 4 stars is with their banana cream pie. It's baked on premises, and it was amazing. Very flavorful, but airy enough for a shared dessert.

"This was by far the best brunch I've ever had in New York. The location is kind of inconvenient, but the look and the taste of the restaurant is amazing. It is very spacious, and brunch is offered daily. I had the French toast and it was AMAZING. I went with my boyfriend and he got a plate of eggs and we loved everything that came with it. I would highly recommend this place for a nice, relaxing, and tasty brunch.",5.0

"Best brunch that I've had in a very long time! Amazing eggs Benedict as well as the best pancakes in Brooklyn (walnuts, ginger and pear- some kind of amazingness)! Absolutely delicious!! I can't wait to come again!!",5.0
"What can I say about glorious Rabbithole? I come here practically every weekend for my afternoon mimosa fix. The service and the food are both incredible. I'm particularly fond of their scones (seriously, every flavor is amazing) and their French Toast. I've also had the frittata a few times and have never been disappointed. In the summer, there is a lovely little outdoor seating area in the back. It's super cozy and laid back. The perfect place to relax and sip on some gin and juice (coincidentally, their current specialty cocktail is the Springtime Spritzer which happens to contain gin and lemon juice)!",5.0
"New to the neighborhood and popped in Sunday for an early Brunch. Had a delightful time! Their Stuffed French Toast is an indulgent dessert for breakfast treat. And the charming staff were cordial and warm. Was treated to a free scone because Clint like my shirt! All in all, will definitely return.",5.0
Our favorite brunch spot in the neighborhood so far.  All the sides of your brunch dish is a star itself....especially the potatoes are actually the surprising star of your dish.  It's baked and seasoned well.  You can tell they put effort in making it and it's not just side dish filler.  We really like the lamb burger.  Perfect size and even the side salad comes with quality mixed greens.We didn't get usual brunch drinks but we ordered off the regular drink menu on the blackboard.  It's got a diverse selection of drinks.,5.0
So searched for an outdoor brunch spot and yelp recommended this. Rabbit hole will definitely get another visit. From the beer to the food everything was delightful. Outside seating was perfect with shade and a nice breeze. Ordered the steak and eggs which came out a perfect medium rare as I asked for. Everyone else's dishes were amazing as well. The side of bacon had a nice sweet tangy but spice. Service was great drinks took a little long but it is a little packed so maybe they can work on that. Besides that definitely a recommendation to my friends.,5.0
"If you're human and you eat food, this place is good. The breakfast menu is pretty cheap for what you get (potatoes be there on your plate as well) and the service is good. Go there for a cheeky Bloody Mary and an omelette just because you can. The environment would also but any sims mood up. You do you",4.0

"We were looking for a nearby place to eat and most restaurants were either closed or packed and with long lines. So glad to have found this quaint and quiet place. The food, to our surprise, was really very good!!! I had the short ribs and they're the most tender I've ever had. My 7year old nephew had the Housemade Tagliatelle and soon everyone was getting from his plate too. The staff were super friendly and next time I dine there, I'm eyeing for the garden seating. Too bad we didn't have time for desserts as we were rushing home for the 4th of July fireworks display. This place is really one of those great accidental discoveries.",4.0

"Came here for dinner and sat in the garden area. Super cute and atmospheric. The inside was dark with lots of candles, perfect for a date evening or just a nice evening with close friends. I had the veggie burger which was delicious and my husband had the salmon which he raved about. It came with beets and some other side vegetables which were delicious. Our waiter was attentive and sweet. They had a nice little bar inside as well that would be nice for a drink one evening. All in all it was a great little place and I would def. go back.",4.0
"Contacted them last minute about a reservation on Valentines Day. They said they were booked so I decided to try my luck somewhere else. Minutes later THE OWNER texts me saying that he will make the reservation work. We arrived and were seated right away.

As for my steak, the dish was prepared great but it was waaaay over cooked. Accidents happen. Well done steak isnt the worst thing in the world. Overall, the night was a complete success. The owner actually followed up and texted me mid dessert to confirm that we made it and to see if everything was alright. A+",4.0

"One happy mad hatter for going down the Rabbit Hole!Once again, a place that has become a regular for someone who doesn't usually have regulars. Love this place. The old wooden interior has a cozy rustic ambiance that combined with the relaxed attitude of the super friendly and efficient staff makes for a chilled evening. The beautiful summer garden is one of the nicest we've been to in NYC. A simple but interesting lunch/brunch menu is complimented by a small but carefully selected wine list, both at very reasonable prices. The steak salad and the delicious Greek style lamb burger are a prefect light lunch for carnivores while the BLT with avocado ideal for the non carnivores. They have a Wyatt Californian Cabernet that is great at a reasonable price or you can just have a beer at the less formal front bar and dining area. Be warned. Although it is a good distance form the hectic Bedford Ave spots, the weekend brunches get packed.UPDATE!!Ended up going for dinner before posting this review. So glad we did. Was our first dinner there and the food was sensational. Don't know how they do it for the low price. Everything so fresh and perfectly cooked. The marinade octopus tentacle (served warm) on a bed of pumpkin puree with a base of quinoa, corn and a green herb sauce, topped with thinly sliced fennel was original and a great combo of flavors. The fillet of perfectly cooked salmon served with diced beets, parsnip and green beans was equally wonderful. Everything was as good we've had at some of the best restaurants we've been to.The well informed waiter told us that he and the manager spend time carefully selecting their wines, and it showed. I veered from my regular Cali Cabernet and tried a glass of the Southern French red which was excellent. My friend said her Rose was also way better than most house Rose.So while lunch and brunch is pretty darn good comfort food, the dinner menu, though small in choice compared to most places (which is always better on several levels anyway) is a real treat.Also refreshing to go to a stylish place that doesn't blow your head off with crazy loud inappropriate music.Hats off!!UPDATE to the Update!Sorry to have to take a star off but consistency is important. Had some friends in from out of town so booked for the Friday night, two nights after our previous dinner there. We were six people. Didn't go as well as I'd have like. Hopefully just an off night. It was pretty busy but not full.After siting down it took about 20 mins just to get water. Another 20 after ordering to get a bottle of wine. 40 minutes without a drink. The kitchen was on the ball but the barman and our waiter couldn't seem to cope, particularly the waiter.  He walked by several times, obviously nothing at all on our table and didn't even acknowledge our presence? In the end the appetizers came the same time as the cocktails. That was nearly one hour after being seated. My guest had to go inside to order the drinks and because of this, for a short while the manager looked after us. But then we would be totally forgotten again. By this time most people had left but still our plates sat there for 30 minutes after finishing. Eventually I had to go inside to ask for dessert menus and for the table to be cleared from the three staff chatting at the bar.Thankfully the food was as sensational as always which averted disaster to just embarrassment. We were all surprised when the pork belly on a puree of pumpkin was actually a soup? The six of us shared two spoons to eat it (no one in sight to ask for more) but at least it was very tasty as was the rest of the meal though our mains sat so long at the pass our meals were lukewarm.

"The food here was really good we got the artichoke fritters, octopus, and the short ribs. The artichoke fritters could use a little more flavor though. The dipping sauce was bland as well. We also got the apple cake for dessert. It was more or less like a piece of apple bread which was really disappointing. I was craving a yummy piece of cake but this was more akin to banana bread. The atmosphere was really cozy and cute. I liked the decor and setup. It would be a great date spot. The service was super awkward.

It wasn't on a traditional English muffin; seemed to be on a dry biscuit.

"We got here around 11 or so and there was no wait, but it seemed busy after we finished, so be prepared to hang out on the sidewalk if you stumble in here at 12 after a long night out.We had the eggs Norwegian (lox instead of bacon) and stuffed French toast. They were both amazing - the hollandaise was yummy, the biscuit buttery and delicious. I'm not usually a fan of breakfast potatoes unless they're done right, and these were done right.

"First off they have a B rating, but never you mind. The backyard is too hot just sit by a window. My salmon omlete had an oddly smooth texture but it was scrumptious. The potatoes were excellent and so was my spicy bloody mary. The stuffed french toast wasn't too sweet and needed twice as many strawberry rations. I had a crunchy biscuit that went well with my omlete also. Don't order the chocolate cake. It was too unchocolatey if you know what I mean. Anyway I love it. Will be back for bloody Mary's and potatoes!",4.0
"Had a delicious bunch here today! Arrived around 11:30am on a Saturday and there was basically no wait. (By 12 there was a 40 minute wait) Service was a tiny bit slow, but it was busy and we were a party of 6. Everyone loves their food. I tried a cranberry orange scone and it was delicious. Perfect texture and flavor-not too dry. The lemonade was delicious and refreshing. Homemade ginger ale was another hit with the group. I Had the BLT and fries. Both of which were also very delicious and fresh. The French dip and the eggs benedict were other faves. The atmosphere was nice; kind of cozy but not overly crowded. Would definitely go back!",4.0

"Went here on good word from a friend for date night dinner. Pretty small hole-in-the-wall type place, so you're definitely squished right up against your neighbors. But the service was good, and the food was GREAT! Cocktails are very original and pretty strong (I had something with chili-infused tequila), food is awesome. I had the salmon and boyfriend had the steak, which he raved about. Looked like there was a pretty equal mix of couples + groups of friends in the restaurant. Will definitely go back, can't wait to try brunch!",4.0
"I was excited to bring my husband and sister-in-law here for brunch this weekend, but honestly wish that I would have gone with another of Brooklyn's many options. I had the Rabbithole/Egg Florentine and I enjoyed my plate. Unfortunately, my husband and his sister got the 2 different options of eggs Benedict and found it to be pretty dry and basic. It wasn't on a traditional English muffin; seemed to be on a dry biscuit.

Rabbithole is almost next door for us. We have been there once last year and had a bad experience because they were packed and under staffed. Several times we wanted to go back and give it a second chance but the crowd was putting it straight on the 2nd option list. However we went back this Memorial Day. We both wanted to be seated in a charming area either in the garden or close to the window. We did not wait and got seated at the window. Items were good and with flavor but not amazing.

We were seated in front of the bar and it was still warm outside so the glass doors were opened up to the outside. I had a white russian, or several...I don't remember how many. They must have been good. I had some sort of fried cheese puffs as an app. They were good, but a little too cheesy, and I love cheese. I wasn't too hungry, so I just had that and dessert. They brought out a huge banana cream pie, which was actually enough to feed the whole table! My friend reserved it ahead of time. Hands down best banana cream pie I have had in NYC.

"Mussels and tagliatelle were both well prepared and decent quality (mussels were very small, but chorizo was plentiful). However, despite the fact that the food was decent (albeit fairly standard for restaurants of this type), our experience was ruined by the rudeness of the staff and incredibly poor service. This is a shame because the ambience and design of the restaurant would otherwise have been pleasant.The food took nearly 45 minutes to arrive, and the waiter took over 30 minutes to process our payment. In fact, it took so long we were beginning to suspect illicit activities were taking place. It turns out their machine was not working, but they did not bother informing us for half an hour and had to wait for us to finally flag someone down. The waitress said that ""the restaurant was cash only as of 5 minute ago,"" and that if we don't have cash we should go and withdraw it from a local deli. What made it worse was that she did not seem the least bit apologetic about wasting so much of our time. In fact, she was very rude and said ""this kind of stuff happens all the time"" (not to my knowledge or experience...) and told us to deal with it. Wow.With this kind of poor level of service, I am confident that the poor dining experience they provide will prevent this place from ever taking off.

"We found this place based on its stellar reviews, and it did not disappoint. We came in with the Sunday afternoon brunch crowd, and because of this had to wait a bit for a table to open. The host was so great and apologetic about the wait - providing us with the most incredible scone of my life to appease our rumbling tummies. That itself would have been enough to earn this place 5 stars. I will dream of that scone for many moons to come. Finally we were seated on the patio, a pretty little space with vintage looking mental and flourishing vines on the fences. The service was alright, though a tad slow, again most likely due to the Sunday brunch crowd. We ordered several breakfast options, all of which were delicious, right up to the simple yet tasty side salad. Overall it was a pretty setting, a delicious meal, and great service. :)",5.0

"The two stars are for customer service, I love the food there but after the treatment I received from one of the bartenders, I would never go back there. I brought some friends with me like I always do, and we sat at the bar since we didn't have much time to eat because they had to catch a flight. We only ordered eggs and soups to make it faster, And told one of the bartenders that we were in a hurry. After 25mins of waiting for the food, we asked why the food was talking so long. The mean bartender told us that we 'Only waited 25mins that if we're in a hurry we should've gone to a fast food restaurant ' He was rude and never apologized, the staff didn't even know if we were waiting for food or for a table. We had to grab our own menus because after 8mins waiting in the bar, no one had offered us the menu or water. It's sad and disappointing to be treated the way we were treated by this bartender, specially after giving so much business to the place.",2.0
"Been here two times for brunch and I think the service is friendly but I really don't think the food is that good. We had Eggs Benedict two times and the hollandaise was bland on both occasion and the bacon oddly sweet and not salty. I'm guessing they fry it in syrup or something. We also tried the French toast which was good, and the Croque Monsieur, but it didn't taste much.",3.0
Went there last Sunday for brunch. I got seated at the backyard coolllll and I ordered Eggs Benedict with Bloody Mary. The food is so yummy. The waiter and Waitress always smile.  This is such a cool spot will def coming back to try their other menu.,5.0
"PMThis place is well worth it. From the decor to the service to the food, nothing shy of pure quality. Once you enter you're greeted with a friendly face. Once seated, we ordered coffee while looking over the menu. The staff did not rush but took the time to explain the food items thats sparked my interest. I asked our waiter what the Rabbithole is known for on the brunch menu. He gave a full explanation of the Eggs Benedict. I decided to order that. Within 10 minutes, the food was served up. Presentation was simple yet elegant. The combination of flavors were paired perfectly, leaving you to want just a little more after each bite. Everything from the earthy greens to the herbed biscuit, felt as if was created for that dish alone. Along with the endless house coffee another  item sparked my interest. The rasberry scone. Unfortunately  they only have them on the weekends, but again our waiter recomeneded the blueberry. It Had a nice light icing with a medium hard crust but a soft crumbly center.  Being made with fresh blueberries truly made this scone nothing short of amazing. I will return to try the other items on the menu. With the great ambiance, service and attention to quality rather than quantity, they deserve a 5 star rating. They have me wanting to come back for more...",5.0

The place was impeccable! Atmosphere was  right on point! The salmon was done to perfection. Had the octopus as well. It was great... Just not my thing! Would definitely come back and recommend it to my friends. The staff was really friendly and right on top of everything too! It's a must if your in Williamsburg Brooklyn!!!,5.0
Probably the value meal I've had in New York. Crispy leek and bacon salad is one of the best salad's I've ever had and my boyfriend loved his steak which his said was better than the Porterhouse. It was a quiet Sunday night when we went so quality *might* dip if it was busier but I hope not. Only thing preventing it getting 5 stars is that our server was a little grumpy.,4.0
"My friend and I ate here for dinner one night. The atmosphere was great and super cute! We sat in the back garden area. It was a little close for me in terms of having the strangers table a little less than arms length away. Service was good, can't complain. Little slow to refill the water but other than that pretty satisfactory. The food was DELICIOUS. I got the Madame croquette sand which and was so satisfied with my decision. My friend got the lamb burger and also enjoyed it a lot! The only thing I wish was that my sandwich came with a side!",4.0
Came here with a friend on our never ending quest for lamb burgers. They come with fries and a cucumber salad. The burger itself is moist and flavorful and the patty is really big. Wasnt expecting something that tastes like authentic medditeranean cooking from hipsterville but we were pleasantly surprised. Will definitely be back. Also the backyard garden is adorable so try to go when its nice out.,5.0
"fave spot and friendliest staff! we live right around the block and come here all the time- huge fan of the florentine, and the bloody Mary's are great. better to stop in on a weekday afternoon than a weekend as it can get pretty busy, but it's definitely worth the wait!",5.0

"Rabbithole is a beautiful dining experience, think abandoned French parlour. We'll definitely be coming back here whenever we're in the mood for romance or delicious desserts, but maybe not if we're starving. We came for dinner around 7pm on a Monday, which I suggest if you want some alone time because it was quite unpopulated. The patio was a little too dark, I could barely read the menu, but we enjoyed the romantic garden vibe. We had the roasted chicken and fish and chips plus a smokey $7 glass of Côtes du Rhône. Dinner was well done, but plan for European portions. While the entree was adequately sized, my fish and chips consisted of two lonely pieces of fish amongst a large plate of potato slices-not worth $13. Dessert was the best part by far: Earl Gray crème brulée and the apple cake with coffees. Both dreamy delights!

"They served me an uncooked burger. No exaggeration: it was not even warm. Oh, and they tried to charge me for it. How did this happen? I ordered the lamb burger rare, it arrives medium-well. I'm very polite in flagging this to the server who has brought my food - I really didn't want to complain but I don't like overcooked meat so i'm not going to eat it. It's worth mentioning that the server who delivered the food is not the person who took my order - that person has disappeared.The server who has delivered me the burger takes it away, and is kinda uppity about it. Ten minutes pass - my friends are done eating - before a new burger is put in front of me. Same server delivers me the burger. I take a bite and am immediately disgusted. It was barely seared - luke warm, soft, mushy, lamb mince. In between the patties you wouldn't notice, but looking at it with a bite mark missing, it was very clearly completely raw and uncooked on the inside. The server says ""oh sorry, is that TOO rare this time?"" as if I am being a demanding bitch rather than a polite customer who has not received what was ordered and who has just chewed on uncooked lamb meat. The server who initially took our order appears with the check after plates are cleared. It's worth underlining the fact that he did NOT check on us at any point in the meal, and the check still has the lamb burger on it. When I complained, he reprimanded me for not telling him there was a problem during the meal, as if he were at any point present and available for me to do that. NO-ONE APOLOGIZED or did anything to try to rectify the situation or make the situation better, and I wasn't even rude to them. Summary:- This is the single worst experience I've had in a restaurant ever, including the time a cockroach fell into my plate from the ceiling when I was in Poland.- No way that the burger looked cooked; the chef was being a total asshole sending it out like that.-  I waited TEN MINUTES for the new burger which is easily enough time to COOK a burger RARE. - Both servers were assholes. Needless to say, they lost a couple of repeat customers that day, but from the attitudes of their staff, I doubt the management gives a damn. A shame - great recipes.",1.0

"Rabbit Hole has impressed me with their cute outdoor seating and the food itself.

"Loved the cocktails!!! I have been here before for brunch (eggs benedict the best!) but never for dinner, until last Friday night.  Boyfriend and I were catching a movie at 7pm on the Williamsburg cinema and wanted to grab a bite before the film. Our eye catched Rabbithole on our way, so since I have had brunch there before I figured dinner should be as great (we were right!) we entered the restaurant a little before 6pm, kitchen is closed and reopens at 6pm, so the bartender started us off with a corona(him)  and a cocktail(me). It was delicious! Spicy and fruity!! As a starter we grabbed the grilled octopus, later he had a steak and I the sea bass. All three dishes so delicious. Skin on my sea bass was perfectly crispy and oh so good. I personally love the back garden, but since it was a bit chilly and had seats already at the bar we just stayed in. Loved the ambiance and our bartender was great, needless to say, we will be back.",5.0

I am always out looking for the perfect lamb burger.  The burger was very thick and juicy with the perfect meat to bun ratio. It tasted like it was from a Mediterranean restaurant. The burger comes with fresh tasty french fries and a cucumber salad. I have never tasted this type of salad before with cucumber shredding and some type of sour dressing, but it was very refreshing. I was very pleased with my meal and will definitely come back.",4.0
Came here for brunch and will definitely go back for more. Great menu choices and my poached eggs were cooked to perfection. My only reason for not making 5 stars is because the food took forever to come!!!! Otherwise avg service and typical ambience.  4 stars all goes to the most important thing...food!,4.0
"The French Toast with Brioche was the fluffiest, tastiest French toast I've ever had.  I would've paid significantly more than $11 for it.  The back porch is too cute and our waitress was very attentive and personable.  I couldn't get over the ambiance of the place, let alone the food. The drinks were a little pricey so I left them alone, but overall. A very worthwhile experience.",5.0
"One of the few remaining spots on bedford I'd not been to and wanted to try.It's amazing all these gorgeous spots, and one looks as great as the next.  We are truely spoiled here in NYC.As with many or most spots in wburg, you'll fine a gorgeous backyard with vines, and stone tables, quiet respite from the city, and major chill zone.",4.0

"Loved the cocktails!!! I have been here before for brunch (eggs benedict the best!) but never for dinner, until last Friday night.  Boyfriend and I were catching a movie at 7pm on the Williamsburg cinema and wanted to grab a bite before the film. Our eye catched Rabbithole on our way, so since I have had brunch there before I figured dinner should be as great (we were right!) we entered the restaurant a little before 6pm, kitchen is closed and reopens at 6pm, so the bartender started us off with a corona(him)  and a cocktail(me). It was delicious! Spicy and fruity!! As a starter we grabbed the grilled octopus, later he had a steak and I the sea bass. All three dishes so delicious. Skin on my sea bass was perfectly crispy and oh so good. I personally love the back garden, but since it was a bit chilly and had seats already at the bar we just stayed in. Loved the ambiance and our bartender was great, needless to say, we will be back.",5.0

"I came here on a hot Saturday morning while in Williamsburg and we decided to give this place a try.  This cafe is located in a slightly off location so there wasn't too much of a crowd (thank god).  Being as crazy as we were, we decided to sit outside in their garden during the 90+ degree heat.  Being the only ones outside, it was definitely a nice quiet brunch to get our morning started.  I ordered the poached eggs with bechamel sauce over a baguette that also came with a salad on the side.Poached eggs is definitely one of the easiest items to cook, yet so many short order cooks can't seem to get it right.  Thankfully the staff at Hungry Ghost pulled through and made two perfectly poached eggs, oozing that golden sunshine all over my bread and plate.  The portions were just enough to satiate my appetite although I do wish there was a bit more substance to the dish.  The kitchen was incredibly fast at getting our food out and the waitress was very good.  Although they have a B rating outside their door, I would come out here again for their food for their fair prices, quick service, and tasty food.",4.0

"Its amazing that a place can not care about service at all, as mentioned I used to frequent here for their average food (never a wait to eat there hence we kept coming back.......) The service has always been poor at Rabbithole (something you can pick up on from most reviews here). However I didn't let it deter me because but have since learnt its poor management that hasn't trained the staff.I apologize in faulting the servers when the owner seems to not know how to run a business. It seems that anyone who has given a negative review was in fact at fault and not the restaurant (Francine's/Axels reviews are proof and point). Even positive reviews will point out that its disorganized, the last two times we have had the incorrect food brought out, incorrect items on bills, food cooked incorrectly and never once had a server being polite not to mention waiting for extended periods for servers to come check on us. Its clear from the berating essay from the owner to my previous Yelp review that I was indeed at fault for these issues (and anyone else with a negative review). The owner has indeed lost the plot, the other review left 5 days before was indeed my girlfriends review of the restaurant and had nothing to do with me, just goes to prove how much he has lost the plot. I would care to point out a tip or gratuity is something that is added to the bill at the discretion of the customer when they feel service has been adequate or good, I chose not to tip as I felt the service was awful and beyond the already incredibly low standards I held your restaurant at.If you are in the area try out one of PT, Potlikker, Wild, Brisket Town, Bistro Petit, La Superior or ISA as they are all on the very same doorstep and cook your food to a higher standard and without the attitude. There's no point in giving your business to someone that doesn't want it; and will not be doing so in the future and would recommend you to try out any of the above restaurants as you will be catered for and served with a smile and attentive nature unlike here.Oh and please feel free to post another dissertation in response to my negative review it just helps point out how little you care about the customers and strengthens all of the points about poor customer satisfaction.",1.0
"I live freaky close to Rabbithole, and despite seeing their happy hour signs about food and drink at great prices, oh, every day... I'd actually never been in before yesterday. Do you ever forget to eat dinner? That happened to me Saturday night so when I awoke Sunday morning, it was in a frenzy of epic starvation. Not really, but I sure was hungry. After texting my two roommates what I thought was a clever combination of the pie Emoji and the fried chicken Emoji (yes... I wanted Pies & Thighs), the alternative suggestion of Rabbithole came my way. Apparently two friends swear by it and go for brunch all the time.I was shocked to enter such a big, busy restaurant. To be honest, the front of the restaurant was never really appealing, and for some reason it always gave the impression that it was so empty inside. I'd walked past it for two years and never thought to go inside. But, I kind of prefer that. I also walked past PT so many times before even thinking to look at the menu posted in the window, and now it's a favorite restaurant of mine. So, once you get past the front area, you enter what is actually a bright, bustling restaurant with pretty blue walls, lots of homey decorations, and a great garden area. (And, the 'hottest' trend of this summer... air conditioning!)So, onto the food and drink. I really enjoyed my mimosa, but everyone else hit the tequila early on. They got some other cocktails, which admittedly sounded really good, but I just didn't have the strength to proceed with such a bold decision that early in the day. For food, it was an easy decision of steak and eggs for me. All of the food looked good, a spinach florentine dish, eggs Benedict, and lots of sandwiches and more lunch-oriented fare. Steak and eggs was served with potatoes and a salad (both really satisfying), and was only $13. The steak was served with a big cup of chimichurri, the standard Argentinian kind that is not made with cilantro, but rather with parsley. I've always been a fan of the cilantro version, but this parsley version was actually so good, so I think a new recipe is going to be in order soon. The dinner menu looks pretty good too, and the service is very friendly, although I think our waitress was a little spacey; I think she forgot our order for a long time and then also brought us a check after we already paid the check. But we forgive her, because Rabbithole is a great restaurant.",5.0
"I found this place with Yelp's help and by strolling the neighborhoods of Greenpoint & Williamsburgh. Then decided to Yelp it for lunch.So I strolled in and loved the ambiance. Really takes you back (Rabbithole). I was eating alone so sat at the bar. Ordered a coke and they have the Mexican coke bottles which is always a plus.I got the Norweigen which is like an eggs benedict that substitutes salmon lox for the bacon. Price was $13. Biscuits I believe are made fresh. To me this meal was just ""ok"". Nothing special and I found the biscuits to be a bit dry.I also must say that when in Maryland I found this diner that had eggs benedict with a crabcake and I haven't found anywhere that has lived up to it since.....With that said it came with a side of greens and some stellar potatoes.

Its clear from the berating essay from the owner to my previous Yelp review that I was indeed at fault for these issues (and anyone else with a negative review). The owner has indeed lost the plot, the other review left 5 days before was indeed my girlfriends review of the restaurant and had nothing to do with me, just goes to prove how much he has lost the plot. I would care to point out a tip or gratuity is something that is added to the bill at the discretion of the customer when they feel service has been adequate or good, I chose not to tip as I felt the service was awful and beyond the already incredibly low standards I held your restaurant at.If you are in the area try out one of PT, Potlikker, Wild, Brisket Town, Bistro Petit, La Superior or ISA as they are all on the very same doorstep and cook your food to a higher standard and without the attitude. There's no point in giving your business to someone that doesn't want it; and will not be doing so in the future and would recommend you to try out any of the above restaurants as you will be catered for and served with a smile and attentive nature unlike here.Oh and please feel free to post another dissertation in response to my negative review it just helps point out how little you care about the customers and strengthens all of the points about poor customer satisfaction.",1.0
"I live freaky close to Rabbithole, and despite seeing their happy hour signs about food and drink at great prices, oh, every day... I'd actually never been in before yesterday. Do you ever forget to eat dinner? That happened to me Saturday night so when I awoke Sunday morning, it was in a frenzy of epic starvation. Not really, but I sure was hungry. After texting my two roommates what I thought was a clever combination of the pie Emoji and the fried chicken Emoji (yes... I wanted Pies & Thighs), the alternative suggestion of Rabbithole came my way. Apparently two friends swear by it and go for brunch all the time.I was shocked to enter such a big, busy restaurant. To be honest, the front of the restaurant was never really appealing, and for some reason it always gave the impression that it was so empty inside. I'd walked past it for two years and never thought to go inside. But, I kind of prefer that. I also walked past PT so many times before even thinking to look at the menu posted in the window, and now it's a favorite restaurant of mine. So, once you get past the front area, you enter what is actually a bright, bustling restaurant with pretty blue walls, lots of homey decorations, and a great garden area. (And, the 'hottest' trend of this summer... air conditioning!)So, onto the food and drink. I really enjoyed my mimosa, but everyone else hit the tequila early on. They got some other cocktails, which admittedly sounded really good, but I just didn't have the strength to proceed with such a bold decision that early in the day. For food, it was an easy decision of steak and eggs for me. All of the food looked good, a spinach florentine dish, eggs Benedict, and lots of sandwiches and more lunch-oriented fare. Steak and eggs was served with potatoes and a salad (both really satisfying), and was only $13. The steak was served with a big cup of chimichurri, the standard Argentinian kind that is not made with cilantro, but rather with parsley. I've always been a fan of the cilantro version, but this parsley version was actually so good, so I think a new recipe is going to be in order soon. The dinner menu looks pretty good too, and the service is very friendly, although I think our waitress was a little spacey; I think she forgot our order for a long time and then also brought us a check after we already paid the check. But we forgive her, because Rabbithole is a great restaurant.",5.0
"I found this place with Yelp's help and by strolling the neighborhoods of Greenpoint & Williamsburgh. Then decided to Yelp it for lunch.So I strolled in and loved the ambiance. Really takes you back (Rabbithole). I was eating alone so sat at the bar. Ordered a coke and they have the Mexican coke bottles which is always a plus.I got the Norweigen which is like an eggs benedict that substitutes salmon lox for the bacon. Price was $13. Biscuits I believe are made fresh. To me this meal was just ""ok"". Nothing special and I found the biscuits to be a bit dry.I also must say that when in Maryland I found this diner that had eggs benedict with a crabcake and I haven't found anywhere that has lived up to it since.....With that said it came with a side of greens and some stellar potatoes. These I loved!I'd go back, try something different. Ambiance is cool and I noticed they had a patio in back that looked nice. I came on a rainy day.",3.0

"Being in Brooklyn this place has a very laid-back, ""hipster"" vibe, somewhat of a pub/bar setting, the music selection was good. The music was good but it was super slow for brunch on Sunday!!!! Me and my friend waited an hour for our food to come out..... The eggs benedict were really good though, the only reason I give it a two star instead of one star rating.",2.0

"Me and my husband went here for brunch. It was sooooo depressing. The space is kind of cute, the music TOO mellow and nobody here exudes happiness. The guy behind the bar was morose and the Japanese waitress spoke so softly and without much understanding of English that  on top of everything else going on I started to feel like I was in a David Lynch movie. The food was ok. The coffee was good. The service sucked. And the egg white fritatta SUCKS! It is baked in a pan like a fritatta should be but they put so much cheese on it that if you aren't nauseaus by looking at it I am sure you would be ill if you ate it. We sent it back. The waiter guy or manager came over and said ""it's a fritatta"" my husband said ""dude, dont' tell me what a fritatta is."" hahah Neither of us have ever seen a fritatta that might cause a heart attack.Edit Remove",1.0
"My friend and I went here for Sunday brunch and while it certainly wasn't one of the better brunches that I have had, it was nonetheless decent.Excited to try the chili-infused vodka in a Bloody Mary, I was disappointed to discover that they were out of it. That said, once I took a sip of the Bloody Mary, I realized that it didn't matter- it tasted overwhelmingly of cheap cocktail sauce-- without the shrimp.To eat I ordered the sauteed Crimini, Morbier, and fresh thyme French-style soft omelette, that came with a side of breakfast potatoes and a small salad. The portions were refreshingly proportionate- something that is hard to find among the overindulgence in ""the land of inexhaustible plenty-"" and I enjoyed leaving the table without waste. And everything tasted fresh and well-seasoned, albeit unremarkable.",3.0
"Was pleasantly surprised for dinner, prices are reasonable good is good and cocktails are great. But the kitchen is right in the dining room, although it's boxed off behind glass it got SO HOT while we were eating. We had to ask them to open the door to the garden and mind you, it's January. Would have received 4 stars if not for the blistering heat and food smell radiating from the kitchen.",3.0
Found this place through yelp after a beautiful walk across the Williamsburg bridge. 5 minute wait on a Saturday at prime brunch time. Very cozy space. Overall the food was fantastic. We ordered a variety of things. The raspberry scone was packed with flavor. Steak And eggs was delicious and came with nice side of seasoned potatoes and salad. Egg frittata with asparagus was cheesy and oh so good. But I can say that the best thing we had was the side of bacon. Never have I had such mouth watering bacon before. Slightly sweet and literally melt in your mouth. Our waiter was awesome. Overall wonderful dining experience.,5.0

"It's a nice enough place but extremely slow and with cooking mistakes for both of us.My brunch date and I ordered benedicts.

The biscuits they were served on were also extremely dense and a bit dry, not fluffy or particularly flavorful.We had a scone that was delicious, the coffee was strong with free refills. But it took ages for the food to come, and to have it be poorly cooked was a bit frustrating. Also It's not cheap although it's comparable to others in the area.

"This review is solely for what I had experienced on that day.The pleasant breeze coming out from this restaurant invited us in. It was a beautiful Spring day.  It was perfect time and place for a break from all the walk we did in Williamsburg. It was late afternoon. See the photos. We found a nice table with a yellow pansy in a pot at the backyard garden. The garden was sparkled with the rays of warm and kind afternoon sun. It shined our faces and tables. Soon after the place made us a part of this sparkles. The people I see around us were mixed. Some dress like UES, Young and mature hipsters and some to me they were definitely tourist dressed as if they took a good shower and took time to dress. When they arrived, they were holding hands together. It was refreshing to see older couple holding hands together and enjoying each other and there were us from the village.  At the front, there were cute skinny Burgs were sitting on the bench.We had some homemade scones and a cake, The scones were very tasty. I liked blueberry. The berries created some softness and a hint of sea salt made me want for more. I was told to come in the morning if I want to indulge the fresh scones. I might do that get up early and take a train to come even from West Village.""Fantastical decor and backyard garden make this a great place to slip away from bedfod and relax.

"Rabbithole is a cute place with an equally cute backyard. They have a cool light fixture in the back room, and I like that you can kind of get a peek of the chefs cooking your food.- Good florentine, but not memorable- Too flavorful and salty roasted potatoes- The bloody mary actually comes with lettuce, and it packs a punch (if you get spiced vodka for an extra dollar) !- Bad service: the guy with big glasses didn't say a thing to us even though he came to our table to pour us water and take our plates away several times",3.0

"This restaurant is adorrrrable and cozy, I felt like I could have hung out there all day. It was hard to decide what to order because everything on the menu sounded good. I ended up getting a burger, which was perfect. I want to go for breakfast next time.",5.0
"Rabbithole is an excellent place to eat... I've been here many, many times... I love the lamb burger and the veggie burger.  The food is organic; all the best products and so delish! Fantastic place w/great service.  I def-ly recommend it.",4.0
"I was visiting my friend in Williamsburg and he suggested Rabbithole for a weekday brunch. It's hard to find weekday brunches, let alone one this delicious and in a cute, vintagey cafe like this one. The patio was closed, so we grabbed some bar stools instead. We ordered a round of chili-infused Bloody Marys, only to find that they really weren't very spicy or flavorful. I love Bloodys, and I found myself wanting to reach behind the counter and add things to it so that it could taste more than just ""drinkable."" Skip this and get a different cocktail. The others sound wonderful.Luckily, one small setback does not a bad review make. I ordered the Rabbithole Florentine, a perfect pair of poached eggs on top of wilted arugula, caramelized onions and sharp cheddar mornay sauce. It comes with some roasted potatoes too. After a day of airport food, this was just the kind of lighter meal I was craving. The service at the bar was also great---there-when-you-need-'em-style.Other than the sub-par Bloody Mary, my only other criticism is really the bathroom because this dark cave of a loo could really and truly use some new lighting. I could barely see my own reflection and almost put lipstick all over my eyeballs.",4.0
"Decent breakfast I quite enjoyed the mimosasI had the croquet Madame.. Unfortunately I wasn't as wowed with my food as I was when I made the selection from the menu.  It was basically a... Slightly dried out ham egg and cheese with the egg on top.  I gave it three stars because the ham was good but I'm not sure how the bread was prepared, maybe just lacking in a bit of butter.All I know is my friend was in LOVE with her brunch, I think she got the Benedict.  She's been back 4x since then so I'm sure it's just what I ordered, ill certainly give this place another try as other reviews are very positive.",3.0
"Great little Brunch place, busy, but never really crowed. Even on a Sunday.  The food was pretty good, the homemade biscuits  are amazing. The buttermilk pancakes are slightly perfect, fluffy and tasty. They might have been the highlight of the visit. No they aren't life changing, but not much about this place is. Its not BAD not Life Changing. Just decent brunch food, for decent prices. The service can be a little spotty.Well worth a visit, you won't be disappointed.",3.0
The Yelp Community has once again lead me to another stellar brunch spot! I was looking for a spot with outdoor seating with fresh/healthy options in Williamsburg. The decor is kitschy vintage with light oldschool/jazzy music playing. The garden area is nice and flooded with greenery. We came without a reservation on Saturday afternoon around 2:30pm wanting to sit outside in the garden and we just had to wait about 10 min (no wait for inside seating). We were all very happy with our meals but I'd say the stand out was the LAMB BURGER! melts in your mouth perfection. The quinoa salad was also great. I love the wealth of veggies on the menu. Delicious cookies and scones baked daily.  The service was just ok and that's why I don't give it 5 stars but I will definitely be back.,4.0
"Charming spot for brunch!My sister and I went here on a Saturday afternoon and had no trouble finding a table, although the place was clearly a hit with the other diners. (lots of laughing and food guzzling!)We both ordered the nova scotian benedict, which were 2 English muffins covered in smoked salmon, eggs and a delicious hollandaise sauce. A bright salad and assortment of crispy potatoes kept the eggs company on the plate. MMM mmm good.Curious to try other things on the menu -- I noticed others order the French toast and it looks good!",4.0
"I've been here several times since I moved back to NY. Every single time, I could not have been happier. I don't even know why I bother looking at the menu anymore, though, as I always order the same thing: the Beet, Avocado, & Goat Cheese sandwich with a side of Roasted Potatoes (don't be fooled by the ""roasted potatoes, bacon"" on the menu; they're two separate items).The potatoes are perfectly seasoned (gimme that rosemary!) & the sandwich is served with toasted bread and has the perfect amount of ingredients to complement one another without all falling out while you eat it.I always seem to have the same server, who is a kind, funny gentleman. And they have this lovely outdoors area in the back - perfect for a temperate, sunny day.Love it love it love it.FYI: No wi-fi, so leave your laptops at home.",5.0

Rabbithole gives the impression of no matter where you're sitting, you're in a secluded spot. It's a wonderful little romantic date spot.

"Home of one of my top 3 favorite bartenders, Rabbit Hole has great food and amazing drink. The Jar Fly is pretty much the only cocktail I will drink besides a Ginger Margarita. Gin and ginger with a twig of thyme floating in it. Follow that with a Croque Madame with ham, béchamel, gruyere and an egg on top. I devoured that sandwich with McGovern's Milk Stout, which they have on draft among many other top named local brews. I had just heard that the Earl Grey Creme Brûlée was a must have. I ended up ordering the Banana Cream Pie and life couldn't have gotten any better from this point. But then it did! Hayden came over with some espresso martini that tasted like the gods of coffee had pissed it themselves after a night of heavy drinking.Beyond the unforgettable dishes and the warm & friendly service, lies a great decor and ambience. It was very full when I first arrived but not loud.This is an ideal restaurant for a brunch date with friends or that romantically quiet candle lit dinner.

"had brunch at the cutest spot this morning. i'd passed by rabbit hole quite a few times but had never eaten there. my girlfriend gina recommended we give it a shot so we made our way over to the south side at noon today. from the street, you'd never guess that there's a full bar, adorably decorated vintage dining space and garden tucked inside. i saw tatoo'ed servers, lots of fun cursive graphics and fell in love : )the menu's french inspired so i went with an omelet with mushrooms, morbier cheese and fresh thyme. the omelet was good but what i really enjoyed were the crispy potatoes that went alongside. i'm a firm believer that fresh herbs can make a dish and these potatoes were loaded up with them. gina did a frittata with brioche toast and it looked equally as good. bubbly on the inside with a nice, crispy edge, the cast iron skillet made for quite a presentation.  the pastries here are supposed to be delicious as well and the dinner menu looks dangerously good. i'll definitely be making my way back to rabbit hole soon!",4.0

"My bf and I were in the Brooklyn area for a weekend away. It was 4:00 on a Saturday and we were trying to find a place to eat a late lunch. Most restaurants in the area were closed until they re-opened for dinner, except for this place, so we gave it a try. It was fantastic. I got the black bean burger. It was on a fresh roll, and the salad it came with was simple but had an amazing flavor, not sure what they put on it.Would definitely go back to this place if we're ever in the area again.",4.0
"Decided on Sunday brunch with my DH. Was recommended by a friend to check this place out. After reading some yelp reviews, I was quite excited for some delicious food to be had. As we entered, we were immediately greeted and seated. Disregarding the yelp reviews, DH ordered a bloody mary and I had a housemade ginger ale. We should've listened to the reviews. Bloody Mary was below sub par. Gingerale wasn't bad. Just a tad too sweet for my taste. Loss in stars was due to the fact that it took 35 mins to receive our food. It wasn't even packed. DH had a egg sandwich and I, the Rabbithole Florentine. I would say the food was pretty good overall but after waiting for over a half hour, I was just ready to leave.All in all, food is good if you have time and patience. Would I return? Likely not, with all the other establishments in the area.",3.0

"Wandering around Williamsburg armed with an iPhone and Yelp led us to Rabbithole. In short, the positive reviews are spot on. Rabbithole is fantastic, and is worthy of a serious critique and multiple visits.At first, I thought the decor was a little forced, a little too hipsterish for its own good (distressed coffee shop chic with random knick knacks arranged in little altar-like niches), but I warmed to the surroundings and to the choice of music (West Indian pop I think).  It was just the right volume to go along with brunch and not fight against it.The food was excellent. I had the Norwegian eggs benedict (fresh hollandaise, poached eggs, and cold-smoked salmon on a biscuit). It was a nice creation and the biscuit worked really well. I have to pause for a second here, as the hollandaise really deserves a moment of silence. It was so incredibly good, so much so that I think a tiny part of me died and went to heaven when I devoured it. This is saying a lot. I've been a really bad man. Really really bad. This hollandaise sauce more or less redeemed my very soul. The dish was accompanied by a fresh salad and home fries. The home fries were probably the best I have ever eaten (do NOT add ketchup, they are great the way the chef prepares them).  My date had eggs florentine (served on a baguette, which was surprisingly fresh, crunchy and soft all at once). We also had mimosas and coffee. The mimosas were fair enough, but the coffee was excellent.Not that it matters that much, but there were a couple of tiny technical errors. One egg on each dish was hard poached (not that we were asked how we wanted the eggs poached, so I'm assuming that they were supposed to be soft poached, perhaps asking how we want the eggs might be a good tip). The other error was in the eggs florentine. The onions were supposed to be caramelized, but were only about halfway there. It wasn't particularly busy at the time, but judging from the overall quality of the meal, I'm sure it was a one off.It's actually a testament to the Rabbithole's quality that I even noticed something minor flaws. Jeepers, I'm reasonably shocked whenever I see that someone has properly poached an egg or made a proper mornay or hollandaise. I will certainly be back. Quite possibly tomorrow.",4.0

"Love the outdoor garden seating in the back, very clean and romantic.  The food was hit or miss.Hit: very tasty arugula sweet potato ravioli dish- the lemon olive oil dressing on the arugula was very tasty and topped with shaving of parmesean cheeseMiss: black bean veggie burger - the only veggie sandwich option.  Although it was a house made black bean veggie burger, it was very bland.  It tasted like it was made of black beans and lots of starch/flour.Spinash sides - it looked lovely at first, but the chef was too heavy on the salt, to the point that the dish made your tongue numb.They have a great menu, just that the execution of the dishes are not always consistent.",3.0
"Amazing brunch. Not overly huge, but definitely generous portions.  My omlette with goat cheese, roasted tomatoes and caramelized onions (side salad and potatoes included) and a cup of endless refills coffee came out to $10 before tip.  My husband had a take on Eggs Benedict (Norwegian Eggs) with Lox for just $13.  The mimosas and other brunchy drinks were generous in portion as well.  You will not be disappointed in this place.  Anywhere with an outdoor patio and brunch for under $15 is a steal and worth the trip from the Island on the L Train.

"Come here about once a month. It tends to be the go-to spot for us when it's a Saturday or Sunday and prime time brunch for all of NYC. The reason? For some reason not many people know about it. There's never a wait longer then 15 minutes (Lodge: upwards of hour to hour and a half; Pies & Thighs: 2 hours. WHAT?) Anyway, that's automatically would give it 2 stars... but there's more!The atmosphere is great. It's fun meets quaint meets meets cute workers. Yeah, I said it. I mean, the guy with the giraffe tattoo gives it another star..hah. The service in general is solid. We're never left waiting around.Ok... ok... The food! The brunch is always delish! We've been there about 5 times in the past 2 months and not once were we disappointed. The fries are always a required side item, as they're so damn good. And they're good with substitutions. The prices are good. Food is better. And service is on point. All reasons to go for brunch to just give it a try if ya haven't yet.",5.0
"My bf and I were in the Brooklyn area for a weekend away. It was 4:00 on a Saturday and we were trying to find a place to eat a late lunch. Most restaurants in the area were closed until they re-opened for dinner, except for this place, so we gave it a try. It was fantastic. I got the black bean burger. It was on a fresh roll, and the salad it came with was simple but had an amazing flavor, not sure what they put on it.Would definitely go back to this place if we're ever in the area again.",4.0
"Decided on Sunday brunch with my DH. Was recommended by a friend to check this place out. After reading some yelp reviews, I was quite excited for some delicious food to be had. As we entered, we were immediately greeted and seated. Disregarding the yelp reviews, DH ordered a bloody mary and I had a housemade ginger ale. We should've listened to the reviews. Bloody Mary was below sub par. Gingerale wasn't bad. Just a tad too sweet for my taste. Loss in stars was due to the fact that it took 35 mins to receive our food. It wasn't even packed. DH had a egg sandwich and I, the Rabbithole Florentine. I would say the food was pretty good overall but after waiting for over a half hour, I was just ready to leave.All in all, food is good if you have time and patience. Would I return? Likely not, with all the other establishments in the area.",3.0

"Wandering around Williamsburg armed with an iPhone and Yelp led us to Rabbithole. In short, the positive reviews are spot on. Rabbithole is fantastic, and is worthy of a serious critique and multiple visits.At first, I thought the decor was a little forced, a little too hipsterish for its own good (distressed coffee shop chic with random knick knacks arranged in little altar-like niches), but I warmed to the surroundings and to the choice of music (West Indian pop I think).  It was just the right volume to go along with brunch and not fight against it.The food was excellent. I had the Norwegian eggs benedict (fresh hollandaise, poached eggs, and cold-smoked salmon on a biscuit). It was a nice creation and the biscuit worked really well. I have to pause for a second here, as the hollandaise really deserves a moment of silence. It was so incredibly good, so much so that I think a tiny part of me died and went to heaven when I devoured it. This is saying a lot. I've been a really bad man. Really really bad. This hollandaise sauce more or less redeemed my very soul. The dish was accompanied by a fresh salad and home fries. The home fries were probably the best I have ever eaten (do NOT add ketchup, they are great the way the chef prepares them).  My date had eggs florentine (served on a baguette, which was surprisingly fresh, crunchy and soft all at once). We also had mimosas and coffee. The mimosas were fair enough, but the coffee was excellent.Not that it matters that much, but there were a couple of tiny technical errors.

"Came here for brunch since it opens at 10 while many other places open at 11.  We ordered the French toast (meh...), the eggs Benedict and the salmon omelette accompanied by the herb biscuit, coffee and orange juice.  Food took a long time to come out (which I forgive as long as it arrives hot) and the coffee even longer. Another table sent back the French toast while we were there but we struggled through ours. Otherwise, most of the food was good (don't bother with the soggy tasteless French toast) the coffee was hot  and the orange juice fresh squeezed with no pulp.  The salmon omelette was lukewarm, but for me you can't get it piping hot without overcooking the salmon or egg so it was perfect.

"It is bizarre that it has taken me so long to venture down the Rabbithole, considering its proximity to my apartment however, stranger things have happened. Be that as it may, having encountered the tempting images presented to me on Yelp for many a week, I recently threw caution to the wind and slipped in for a quick breakfast. Breakfast, let me be the first to note, is an important feature for those of us who like to rise and dine before midday. The fact that Rabbithole commences eating-related activities sooner rather than later means that you have a good alternative to the many WIlliamsburg (and East Village) brunch hotspots, an alternative where you won't have to wait an hour for your beloved french toast. In many instances, the meal at Rabbithole is as good as - if not better than - said alternatives, for the difference between a good poached egg and ""the ideal"" poached egg seems to be trivial to my unsophisticated palate. In any event, the restaurant itself is utterly charming as is typical for this part of the world - a warm, laid back and rustic setting which is ideal for a gathering of friends. The service was efficient and friendly and the meal itself (the goat cheese omelet) was good but not memorable, with the goat cheese making only the occasional guest appearance. Though I was full, I recalled images of scones from the Yelp reviews and thus took one for the road, as I never pass on the opportunity to carbo load (New Year's resolution?). As far as blueberry scones go, this particular specimen was delicious.Conclusion: If you're in the market for an earlier version of brunch and couldn't be bothered to deal with the masses at the more popular spots (deserving of this excess patronage or not), Rabbithole is a very good option. I would not go out of my way to dine at Rabbithole but, as a neighborhood restaurant, it does a fine job.",3.0

"Pretty yummy brunch food. I had eggs benedict the first time there, and really enjoyed the dish. Second time I ordered the rabbithole benedict, which was the vegetarian version of eggs benedict. Instead of the ham, it was caramelized onion and spinach. Not so much a fan. They also over cooked one of my eggs, but they were nice enough to make me another poached egg. I think I'm going to stick with the regular eggs benedict from now on. We stayed till around 4pm, and they gave us a freshly made chocolate chip scone and a raspberry scone on the house as they were getting rid of them. They were very very tasty! I just wish they would have given them to us before I finished my coffee. I love the ambient of the restaurant, decorated with antiques, and they also have a courtyard in the back, perfect for a nice summer day. We barely had to wait the three times I've been there. An excellent spot for brunch! :)",4.0
"Been here twice, it's been smooth sailing. The eggs benedict with bacon is...amazing. Served with crisp, every so slghtly sweet, diced potatoes and a nice salad. The poached egg was at that perfect middle ground between runny and set, the biscuit with dense yet somewhat sweet and rich (you could cut it with your fork tender), the bacon was cooked to perfection and the hollandaise sauce was the cherry on top. The waiters are somewhat out of it, but it didn't hinder the overall experience. Got a bloody marry, somewhat bland, but still good.

The octopus was incredible. It had a great texture, grilled to the right touch. I had the poached tilapia for my main. Wow. Fresh, tender fish smothered in a delightful creamy leeks sauce. My friends had the homemade gnocci which they gave two thumbs up for. Tasty? I guess you could say that! We were close to licking our plates clean. The portions were ample and the prices not outrageous for ultra-trendy Williamsburg cuisine.The waiter was just as much of a highlight as the food was.

"I have come to really like this place! Been ehre a few times for Brunch/Lunch.  Its decorated very cute and the outside patio is even more adorable. The service is on par for most of Williamsburg, they dont ignore you but I could have used a LITTLE more attention. The iced coffee is DELICIOUS and you can order one to go if youd like (I did). Everything I have eaten here has been really fresh and tasty. No comaplaints really. Very chill, laid back atmosphere. The croque Madam is to die for.",4.0
"You know, there aren't very many options for brunch on Saturdays.  This is disappointing because I work Sundays and often miss brunch specials.  And mind you, I shouldn't have been at brunch because I was swamped with work to do and should have been studying instead, but I went anyway because studying things makes my head hurt and you can't study without something filling your tummy.  In fact, I should be studying now, and since I just had dinner and my tummy is full I have no excuse other than I want to procrastinate with a Yelp review. So early on a Saturday morning I yelped all brunch places nearby my boyfriend's job (he had been working that morning) and there weren't any places open before 11am.  It was neary 9:30 so we weren't about to wait around.  However, I did find this location, 6 miles and 15 minutes away from our current location and near my beloved Williamsburg.  The name was adorable, so using a scientific tried and true method of selecting places based on cute or silly names, I decided to check this one out.  Inside it was cute, we sat down immediately and the staff was attentive.  When we opened the menu, the first thing my partner said was ""oh you're definitely ordering the rosemary potatoes."" Well, silly me, I forgot! Luckily, they came with my omlete (with mushrooms, morbier cheese and fresh thyme) so I didn't have to ruminate over forgetting to order them. They definitely were my favorite part of the meal.  In fact, I would probably go there just to order the potatoes again.  We got cute little drinks, although I forgot what they were called.  Everything was nice, a-ok.  Nothing stupendous, but definitely ok.  The omlete was was good but not gobble you up within minutes good.  Honestly, I was most excited about finding an early Saturday am brunch spot.",3.0

"Came in around 1:30 on a Sunday afternoon. The wait was about 20 minutes as a walk-in -- M and I sat down at the bar to wait for a table, and I ordered a delicious mimosa. The bartender seems to be running around like a chicken with his head cut off, but he was still really attentive albeit extremely busy. The restaurant has a wonderful ambiance and would be even better once the weather warms up a bit.I tried both the the eggs benedict with lox and the lamb burger. The lamb burger was soooo good. Cooked just the right amount with the right seasonings, and the yogurt sauce on it was perfect. The hot chocolate was quite thick and rich, so it was a perfect accompaniment for a cold afternoon. The eggs benedict could have had more lox on it, but overall was pretty good. The server was quite friendly and attentive as well. I would return.",4.0

Both egg dishes looked incredible. One tasted incredible. One of the two cocktails i ordered came, although both were on the bill.Maybe i'll try it again sometime for lunch.

"This place is so chill and the backyard garden is a delight!I found myself one saturday walking down bedford when I was invited to join up with a group of friends who were having brunch at Rabbithole.  We walked up around 1:00 pm and asked if they had garden seating available.  They said that for a party of 4/5 one on the way its looking like a couple of mins... thats it...we hung outside in the nice air and caught up and soon enough we had our table in under 7 mins!  LovelyWe got very lucky as the only seating that could accommodate our big group was in my opinion the best seat in the house... or in the garden!Straight in the welcoming french doors from the street propped open by vintage wooden shoe mannequins... you can see the green garden down the hallway 'through the rabbithole!""  I gladly fell in.There at the other end of the rabbit hole in the back corner was the most coveted setting for a tea party..or blissful brunch.  A unique french country house aged and weathered table with a bench on one side and an eclectic assortment of chairs around the other sides.A few moments after being seated two large chilled carafes of water were set on our table.  Very much appreciated as it was a warm day.  Drink orders were taken and everyone was pleased with the coffee, orange juice, grapefruit juice and macchiatos ordered.  One of our group ordered the Big Bad Wolf Salad with avocados and it was a great big bowl and looked very filling as well as colorful and nutritious. Another friend had the steak and eggs and it was a lot of food!I shared the Eggs Benedict Norwegian ($13) with a friend as well as a side of the yummy fries ($4) with some sort of herbed mayo dipping sauce which was fantastic!We sat and had a leisurely brunch and never felt rushed to leave.  The staff was very friendly yet knew when to come and check on us and when to let us have our great conversations.  When 4 out of 5 people were there they gave us no hassle about the 5th person and did not hold up our orders.

"Don't mistake this place for a bar. Apparently the owner has decided he doesn't want people to treat it as such.So I was a regular here for 1.5 years. I went there tonight with my partner and a friend from out of town. We sat at the corner of the bar, we ate dinner and moved on to drinks - chatting quietly (no raucous laughter or yelling - I hate that in other people and I avoid that myself). I just got cut off by the 21 year-old barman. This has been my favorite 'go-to' place for so long, but I guess no more. Apparently the owner has implemented a ""5 drink maximum"" after ""an incident."" I was certainly beyond that but, frankly, my tolerance is extremely high and I was barely beyond sober. I guess I'll find someplace else to tip 20% for drinks and be a good customer.",1.0

"Don't mistake this place for a bar. Apparently the owner has decided he doesn't want people to treat it as such.So I was a regular here for 1.5 years. I went there tonight with my partner and a friend from out of town. We sat at the corner of the bar, we ate dinner and moved on to drinks - chatting quietly (no raucous laughter or yelling - I hate that in other people and I avoid that myself). I just got cut off by the 21 year-old barman. This has been my favorite 'go-to' place for so long, but I guess no more. Apparently the owner has implemented a ""5 drink maximum"" after ""an incident."" I was certainly beyond that but, frankly, my tolerance is extremely high and I was barely beyond sober. I guess I'll find someplace else to tip 20% for drinks and be a good customer.",1.0
"Service:Friendly, quick, accurate, attentive at just the right intensity.Atmosphere:Perfect balance of light and dark, the din of the room was such that we weren't under a microscope but also such that we blended in with everything. Perfect for conversation regarding your career or your choice of unintended sex toys.I also like the aesthetic and it has prompted me to dress up my collection of antique medical instruments a bit (this is misleading and furthermore not in any way related to the above comment).Food:Well-prepared and well-presented, flavorful, nice and good. I am not a fan of the brunch as I don't really care for French-style omelettes but that is beside the point.I seem to mostly be condemned to weeknights so that is the context of the above.Eat here.",4.0
"Went here for brunch today and had a lovely experience. We didn't have drinks, but they looked quite interesting, although a bit pricey. If you're looking for a boozy brunch on a budget, this is not the place for you. Two of us arrived at 1:00pm on a Sunday and were seated pretty much right away. My fear of going to brunch at that time was that we'd be in line forever, but I was quite happy to be seated so quickly. The ambiance is really beautiful and the food was quite good. A pretty decent value, although not a ton of food; I usually hate tons of food  b/c that means it's a ton of shitty food.

"It breaks my heart to say that rabbithole is no longer the badass place it used to be. It's mainly because I think they're trying to be a certain type of establishment, yet they don't have the manpower or organization to back it up. Service has increasingly become slower and more painful, and the fact that you can't just order a bagel and sit anywhere you want detracts from the whole experience.

Our steaks were cooked to perfection, by the way: wonderfully bloody on the inside and charred on the outside.

Ambiance was ideal from the sunlit back garden to the comfortable, spacious interior. I liked the monkey chandelier.

"~New discoveries~Lovely, intimate garden, perfect for catching up with old or new friends over a beer on summer evenings. AND...............THE BEST SCONE EVER MADE ON THE FACE OF THE EARTH! THIS RASPBERRY SCONE PACKS A FLAVORFUL PUNCH OF MOIST, NOT TOO CRUMBLY GOODNESS! GOD KNOWS I HATE SCONE EVIDENCE ON MY DESK! Rabbithole,  you just keep getting better.",4.0
Best black bean burger ever!!! Get it with cheddar and avocado and your world will change.,4.0
"Decor and ambiance adorbale. Service and food just so-so. Prices okay. We came here for brunch one Sunday afternoon and ordered egg white frittas. It was decent, not super tasty but filling. I wish it had come with something, though. They could have thrown in some hash browns or a salad like a lot of their other egg dishes.",3.0
"It breaks my heart to say that rabbithole is no longer the badass place it used to be. It's mainly because I think they're trying to be a certain type of establishment, yet they don't have the manpower or organization to back it up. Service has increasingly become slower and more painful, and the fact that you can't just order a bagel and sit anywhere you want detracts from the whole experience. Ultimately I would go here (if I still lived in New York) for only coffee and a scone. The meals take too long. But the ambience and environment is still awesome...it just makes me sad to have to update this review to reflect the new feel and experience of the place.",3.0
"Quick seating on a Sunday morning, gorgeous little patio, friendly service, and delicious food. I am going back as soon as possible.I had the half-baked egg, which was actually two poached eggs on a piece of toast piled with wilted greens and caramelized onions topped with a smooth, creamy sauce. Hell yes.",4.0
"I hadn't been here in a while, and I read that they had a new chef, so my husband, a friend, and I went here for a quick dinner before seeing a movie. I have to say, the place still has everything I love about a restaurant: quick service, great food, friendly staff, and an outdoor space for nice weather. Our steaks were cooked to perfection, by the way: wonderfully bloody on the inside and charred on the outside. We also had the mussels with chorizo, which were delicious, and their bourbon old fashioneds with homemade maraschino cherries were pretty awesome. I'll certainly come back here more often - you can't beat $17 steak frites.",4.0
"Cute place; great for brunch, dinner, dessert, a drink.I like the food, not the best, but......I LOVE THEIR BANANA CREAM PIE! I cannot get over it. I talk about it constantly, and this is from someone who doesn't even like bananas. So yes, I come here solely for their desserts & tea.",4.0

"I can't wait to go back to this place for dinner... and dessert.  We had no wait, showing up for Brunch at 11:30 and getting a table by the window overlooking the garden. I ordered the Salmon and Caper Omelette, my Mom had the strawberry stuffed brioche. Both were delicious. We weren't sure who our waiter specifically was but service was friendly and attentive. Ambiance was ideal from the sunlit back garden to the comfortable, spacious interior. I liked the monkey chandelier. It's amazing how not having your chair hit up against another person's chair lets you really enjoy your food and (private) conversation. Finally, a place to eat, drink, and relax.

"WOW!!!What a terrific local place for exceptional food! Was recommended to my girlfriend and I by a local musician and it did not disappoint.I am mainly a carnivore but went for the Big Bad Wolf salad (topped with delicious, lightly sweet bacon), as I had seen a picture of it on my friends Facebook page. Big bowl filled with fresh field greens and lightly splashed with a nice olive oil based dressing. The different greens tasted fantastic with the oil and bacon. I backed it up with a homemade herb biscuit w/butter. Again quite tasty. A filling lunch without feeling stuffed. And since it all is made fresh daily, very good for you too. The green tea infused with jasmine was a refreshing addition to the meal.The owner came over and asked our thoughts, and then asked if we had ""tried the homemade cookies""? We responded ""no"" and he said ""Dinner should always end with a cookie"" and gave us a fresh made oatmeal/cranberry cookie on the house.The staff was spot on with the service and willing to please.What a great experience.

"Very pretty space but I agree with the other reviewers - service can take close to forever, which is silly because it's never that busy in here. It has the same feel as Blackbird, further down Bedford and surprise surprise, the same animal-related name, conjuring up the whole rustic meets hipster meets bohemian vibe.

"I came here with my boyfriend at 11:30a on Saturday for brunch.  He ordered the lamb burger, which was wonderful.  It was the best lamb burger he's ever had and the combination of flavors on it were great.  Also, they actually cooked it to the medium rare that he asked for, unlike most places that overcook things.I ordered the mushroom, onion, and cheese soft omlette and really enjoyed it as well.  We shared a side of bacon that was slightly sweet and very good.  Also, we each ordered cocktails.  The bloody mary was fine, but nothing special.  I had a grapefruit champaign cocktail that I really loved.Service was good with an attentive staff.  We had no service issues and were served in an efficient way.  The place also has a vintage feel with lots of antiques and random finds.... much like the rest of Williamsburg.  The decor is cute, but will not surprise you given it's location.  Overall, we really enjoyed our meals and look forward to coming back to try other items.  Prices on drinks were a little high, but the food prices were fair.",4.0

"Rabbithole is by far my favorite place to eat brunch. Between my beau and I we've had everything on the breakfast menu. French Toast with fruit is damn good. The soft omelet so mouth watering. You have choices of steak and eggs, salmon and capers, caramelized onions; with the omelet you get home fries and a side salad. What more could you ask for. If you have room get a cranberry and blueberry scones........ delectable, take it home. You won't regret it. Service is friendly all the time. Try it, you'll see.",5.0

Haven't gone for dinner because my brunch experiences were so bad. Their brunch is really tasty and reasonably priced. But the service is AWFUL.

Keep in mind this is a pretty small place. One waitress completely forgot to enter our order into their system and then claimed it was ""lost"" in the computer.Obviously a lie. It took almost an hour for my sister to be served her panini, and it was the wrong order. The owner is really shy and awkward and obviously bad at managing his staff. He came to our table to apologize, but rather than taking responsibility he just sort of mumbled his way around it. We had to basically force him to cut our bill in half. It 's too bad  because the food is good and reasonably priced, the decor is cute but understated, and there is always a gorgeous poodle-y dog outside that I love to pet.

I guess it's their own choice - it was sad though how they started as a great place for working on computers with wifi for months, then the management was very rude about the transition to absolutely no computers on premises :(Still the food and vibe is great for those times when you don't need a computer and want to have a brunch with friends or something. YUMMY.",4.0
"I like this place.  Now the first time i came i was part of a party of five and it was, i believe, a sunday.  The place was packed.  We had to sit at the bar, and order our food there until a table freed up.  The bartender was nice enough, but not too friendly.  I don't blame him though, the place was busy and he looked preoccupied.The second time, however, was the charm.  I showed up late afternoon on Monday and the place was so empty i was afraid they might not be serving food (they serve ""brunch"" until 5 pm!).  Luckily they were.  I sat at the bar since i was alone and, desperately thirsty was IMMENSELY PLEASED to see that they offer ""cold-pressed iced coffee"" (most places just serve regular coffee poured over ice which is a travesty! no! no!).  I ordered two of those and a delicious omelet.  The vibe, unlike the first time i had come, was very laid back, calm and soothing.  The bartender was also very gracious and kind and didn't mind my hanging out there for almost two hours.  I will definitely go again, and definitely during the week when it is not ridiculously crazy.",4.0
"RabbitHole is listed as one of Time Out New York's best brunch places.  While, I am not sure I would agree with that, the food is pretty good. I love the beet, avacado and goat cheese sandwich.  The service is beyond slow, but I guess that's OK for a lazy Sunday brunch.",3.0
"We went for brunch. Atmosphere was cool, service was good, food was good, not great, but not bad either. The food just lacked a little something. The bloody Mary was excellent, but no brunch drink special. We would go back but maybe try dinner to see what else is on the menu.  The ""B"" rating in the window turned off my wife but it didn't seem dirty.",4.0

"Perfect stop after a dizzingly cold trek across the Williamsberg bridge from Manhattan.  Rye and cider never tasted so right.  However, the scallops never tasted so wrong.  you could smell the fishy smell in their preparation from the open kitchen, which translated into something alternately flavorless and chemically on the plate.  If the waitress had steered me away from these, this might have been a five star.  Fantastically whimsical decor - including a monkey chandelier.",3.0
"It was definitely not worth the experience for me. This place is cute and the garden in the back looks so quaint and romantic. I love the decor. I am giving one star for decor and one star because my husband liked his food. We came for brunch last Sunday and luckily there was no wait. Our waiter seemed uninterested and almost like he was in another world or recovering from a hangover himself. We ordered our drinks which were good..nothing worth going out of your way for. But even then our food took so long that we ordered another drink. Finally after waiting over 30 minutes, the food finally came. My french toast was soggy and the bacon was greasy. My husband liked his omelet with salmon. Cute place but nothing remotely special. Ive had better service and food even on a bad day. But try it for yourself!",2.0
"The service here was absurdly slow on a Saturday night at 9:30pm. It took an hour to get our food. The place was nowhere near full. I had the veggie burger. I asked if it was vegan and if it had dairy or eggs in it. They said no, but there was clearly butter and possibly eggs in the bun. Really? When I ask if the burger is vegan, do I have to ask if the bun is, too? It was also mostly a black bean mush patty. So mediocre. Also, it was clearly cooked on the same, unclean surface as meat. I guess that's what you get at a place with a ""B"" rating. And $2 extra for fries over a salad? Are you familiar with how cheap potatoes are?",2.0
"i've never been disappointed with any of the food here. service is very lax. nice quiet atmosphere. a great place for having a conversation with friends on a lazy evening when no one has anywhere else to go afterwards. the last time i had dinner there, the waitress sent us home with some free baked goods left over from the morning (which were still delicious the next day)if you ever come across the curry chicken salad sandwich as a special while you're visiting the rabbithole, i whole-heartedly recommend that you order it. it's possibly one of the best sandwiches i've ever had.",4.0
"This place is very cute, and there is no wait for weekend brunch, but the food is mediocre and the policy of only seating complete parties seems unreasonable when the place is empty and the person waiting is pregnant.  I got the stuffed french toast - and all the ingredients were good, but the ""stuffing"" was a single strawberry and about one tablespoon of mascarpone - just too stingy. We also had the mushroom omelette, which was not very good.  They do have free coffee refills, and were very attentive and friendly.  I completely understand really busy places not seating incomplete parties, but this place had 6 empty tables of two (and other empty tables for larger parties) while I waited in the doorway. If I was not pregnant that would be lame, but not a big deal, but since I've been pregnant even much busier places let me sit down.  It remained relatively empty for the duration of our meal (11am-12pm on a Sunday).  I would still recommend it if you don't care that much about food and are looking for a cute place without a wait in Williamsburg.",2.0
"My boyfriend and I had breakfast here last week. The service was fine, I didn't feel ignored which is always a plus in Williamsburg. Of course we sat the counter, so I don't know if that influences things. My omelet was delicious and the coffee was good. Boy had the soup and a salad. He really liked both. I agree that it's a very cute place with a European feel. I'll probably return one day with my laptop.",4.0
"I really like this place.  I like the space itself.  And I love the little garden in the back.  It's perfect when the weather is nice.  The salmon omelet is yummy.I can't tell if the waitresses are on prescription meds or self medicated, but something is strange.  Each time I have visited,  one of them will pass by without acknowledging us.  Eventually we chase them down and ask can we take a seat or wait for seating?  Each time the answer is the same, 'Oh we'll seat you in a minute.'  Then another unsuspecting costumer will walk into the seating area for a table.  I'm not sure who I get more irritated by: the waitress who sees us standing there and makes no effort to acknowledge us or the dumb ass who walks past us as though we're just standing there for our health.   If you see a line, jerk, then get in the back of it.  See, that's how things work.   But I really fault the servers or the management.  Someone should get organized.But then we sit down and the waitress is all smiles and sweet.  So I forget my irritation until the next time I visit.  Yes, I will continue my dysfunctional relationship with you, as long as you give me the yummy goods.",4.0
"What a delightful place with delightful decor.  It's got a great location - this block of Bedford had been lacking a place like this.  It's a solid joint to go and hang out in.  Their food is okay and the service is so-so, but I get the distinct feeling the staff are still trying to get into the swing of things, so I'm optimistic that it will improve.  Its bakery options are certainly not the most expansive in the neighborhood and neither are its brunch options, but I like it best for its tea or coffee on a weekday evening.  The soft lighting and 1930s decor is wonderfully mellow, and the music they play has been fitting.They also have a pretty nice little garden in the back, though it could use better shading on sunny days.  They could stand to improve the patio set a bit, but it's workable.It's an attractive, relaxing atmosphere that is, so far, not too crowded.  I also hope it doesn't become a haven for laptop users, like a few other joints in the 'hood.  I'd rather meet a friend here for tea or read the newspaper and drink coffee.",3.0
