"Though I wouldn't give everything I've tried from BeeHive a full five stars, the business as a whole definitely deserves it because (1) I know that there are plenty of things on the menu that I absolutely love and don't need to be a fan of every single dish, and (2) with the service and ambiance it's just the perfect neighborhood spot and I love them. On to the food...- Complimentary fresh veggies with buttermilk sauce they give you at the beginning of your meal. It's a tasty but light snack so you don't completely fill up before your food gets there. - Fried green tomatoes: such a perfect app to get in this sweet southern-themed spot! Freshly fried with delicious sauce on the side. Terrific!- Deviled eggs: They came two to a serving and were tasty enough though not super memorable. - The Moselle: I am so glad I went with this. The biscuit, fried egg, fried chicken, and hot sauce are a pretty fool-proof combo and totally worked as a sandwich. - The Charlotte: This is more like a soupy pot-pie filling type thing on top of biscuits. It personally wasn't my favorite but it certainly was hearty and comforting, great for a cold day. I just like to eat my biscuits drier, I guess. - Plum biscuit pudding (seasonal special): I love plum, I love biscuits, and I love bread pudding, so I thought this was a shoo-in, but alas I wasn't blown away... maybe it was too drenched in caramel and other sweetness? Maybe it was too soggy? Not sure. - I also recently received a jar of their pear vanilla spread as a gift and couldn't eat it because the vanilla smell was totally overwhelming to the point where it kind of tasted and smelled like medicine. The great definitely outweighs the not-so-great, and like I said the restaurant and the service is just so pleasant that I can't wait to go back again and again.",5.0
"Been wanting to hit this place up, since the Southerner in me definitely lives for white gravy and this place has it.E and I shared the following:We build our own biscuit with Fried Chicken, Pimento Cheese, Sausage Gravy and pickled vegetables. - Delicious!!!!Chicken Fried Steak with the white gravy....gosh this is everything. I have been looking high and low for some place that carries this stuff. I was so desperate I even went to DQ when they opened in NYC. It wasn't the same though, their version is on point. But as for the steak, I probably would come back and get the Chicken Fried Chicken rather than the steak.Service was good and they were very accommodating - super southern hospitality.I learned they're from Corpus Christi and San Antonio I believe.I definitely would come back here, my only complaint is I wish they had a liquor license, because I don't drink beer and wine is if I am in the mood.",4.0
"This place was cute, it was kinda like little Texas in the heart of Williamsburg. I really liked the decor, it felt homey, in a backyard, Southern way. The place is not that big and it's kinda hidden in a residential part of Brooklyn. I did enjoy my meal and the Texas biscuits were great but everything came off salty to me but I am usually sensitive to salt.The food:Frito Pie- It was my first ever Frito Pie and I liked it, it's basically chili on top of Frito chips and a fried egg. The egg was great because it added an extra sauce and I really liked the flavor of the chili but it came off salty. Overall, I would order this sucker again. The $13 price tag was kinda steep. yelp.com/user_local_phot…The Sandra- Open-faced biscuit with sausage gravy, a fried egg, and dressed greens. The sausage gravy was nice, I liked the consistency and it had a good pronounced sausage flavor. It worked well with the nice fluffy biscuit, the biscuit was flaky and crumbly. The gravy was salty but oddly, the salad was very salty. How is salad salty? lol yelp.com/user_local_phot…Humming Bird Cake- It was kinda like a carrotless, carrot cake and was good but the frosting was so sweet. It really had a look and feel of a carrot cake but the taste was a little different. yelp.com/user_local_phot…Fruit Biscuit Pudding- A warm biscuit bread pudding baked with seasonal fruit, served with a caramel glaze. The bread pudding was good but it was kinda one note, some kind of whipped cream or ice cream would have been a nice addition. yelp.com/user_local_phot…",4.0
"I know this place is all about the biscuits but I NEED to talk about the Pimento Four Cheese Mac and Cheese first.  Oh my gosh, uber creamy and poppin' w/ bell peppers this mac/cheese was so flippin' good!  I could have easily, and will likely next time, eat an entire dish by myself. *In addition to the mac, the little salad we also ordered was lovely.  Oo!  And the little dish of complimentary veggies w/ home made buttermilk dressing was spot on.  I usually avoid creamy heavy dressings like ranch and the like but this buttermilk dressing was so light and was really the perfect start to the meal.Now the biscuits, the stars of the show at the Beehive Oven, were a tiny bit disappointing for me.  Ugh.  I'm disappointed in the fact that I even had to write that.  Here's whats up though - the biscuits are delish.  Soft inside, slight crunch outside and all that buttery goodness baked throughout was awesome.... but.... they were a little small for me. I think for $3 a biscuit and upwards of $6 for a sandwich I was expecting a slightly huskier biscuit.  Ooo and in addition to that the little piece of fried chicken on my biscuit seemed to be move breading and crunch than actual chicken/meat.  Maybe I should have just had a biscuit and jam.**  But maybe this isn't an everyday occurrence.  I'm hoping that next time, and yes there will be a next time, my biscuit sandwich can be pumped up a bit.Besides all that food - the staff at BeeHive is the nicest.  Seriously, so sweet.  The owner wandered around the entire time we were there, chatting with customers and delivering plates.  He told us before we left that they were working on a recipe book for the restaurant and hoping to release it soon.  Hmmm... will that pimento mac/cheese dish be in the book!?Bonus points for the laid back classic country music being played in the background.  What could be better than a little George Straight while you wait on some good ol' southern comfort food?  Absolutely nothin'.* Note to BHOBC - maybe you can make the mac/cheese a little hotter next time?  Ours wasn't cold but it was not piping hot like we though it should be. ** So many yummy sounding jams on the board like vanilla pear and ginger plum.  I want to try them all!",4.0
"Service is exceptional. A small restaurant with positive vibes. I am so glad I came here for brunch on Sunday. The fried chicken was delicious, mashed potatoes superb. Collard greens were cooked well. Eggs were fresh, and cooked perfectly. Biscuit was buttery, moist and not dry at all. Mimosa's made with lemonade is a wonderful touch.",5.0
"As a former resident of Texas, but not a Texan (I could claim it if I want, but nah), I appreciated that this restaurant is Texasy, but not Dallasy. Really, it screams 'I was born and raised in Austin but moved to Brooklyn' with its charmingly shabby chic decor and Texas flag. I hit the nail on the head, the waitress told me the owners are from Austin. My biggest concern is where can I find these biscuits in Texas??? I lived in Dallas for 10 years without coming across anything close to a biscuit that'll make me spin my spurs and yell ""Yeee-haw!!"" The biscuit itself found the balance between flaky, buttery, battery and moist. The color can be compared to the desert sands of Texas (wait, common misconception of elementary schoolers across the U S of A, Texas is not a giant desert, thanks first grade class in GA). The chicken was fried to perfection and didn't need any other topping to up the flavor. I did add jelly out of sheer curiosity and enjoyed the slight sweetness it added to the biscuit. Also my waitress had that good ole southern (yes I'm pretending for a moment that Texas is considered the South, as if I actually were a Texan.) charm that was truly genuine and not characterized or over-killed. This experience made me consider crossing lines of enemy territory (burnt orange makes me puke exactly that), and make a trek to Austin in hopes to find what inspired this shop. Until then, I'll just relish in the memory of eating that tasty chicken sandwich under the Texas flag.",4.0
"You want to talk about an ideal way to ring in the Easter holiday? Kegs, eggs and biscuits! It's def the best holiday of the year. Defies all odds really. The GOAT JC, is coming back to life!  And if he's coming back, we gotta make sure he's greeted with the party of the century. I wouldn't want JC to come back and see all these dumb pastel bunnies and eggs layin' 'round. If you're comin' back from the dead, you better have a cold brewski waiting for you. Who wants gross jelly beans and goo-filled chocolate eggs? And peeps?f If I was JC, and I was resurrected and I was greeted by some snotty-nosed kid in his Sunday best holding a case of yellow peeps, I'd hightail it back to the underworld or heaven or whatever.  So I decided it'd be pretty chill to throw a rooftop get down just for JC. I felt if I could greet his almighty with some chill vibes, a handful of techno tunes, a couple cute babes, a never-ending supply of local Brooklyn adult bevys, some chips n dips, a few surprise guests and sponsored party favors to commemorate this once-in-a-life-time event, man would it be the Easter party of the century. I wasted no time in getting down to business. Figured I should first spread the word. What's a party without any people? Just a random dude hanging out with a lot of chips n beer. Depressing! I needed to make a lot of flyers. I decided to hand write all of them. Each one would be custom! People don't hand write ANYTHING anymore. Everything is done on the computer. PLUS, people love customized things. 100% original for 100% Brooklyn. Brooklyn is a place that doesn't tolerate imitators. Starbucks and McDonalds. Vomit.""Easter Funday: The Return of JC "" was a go. I made about 17 flyers and looked at the time. 5 hours had gone by like it was nothing! I was really in the zone. Master of my craft. Haven't busted out the construction paper and scented colored markers in years. Felt good to really put pen to paper again. With only hours left in the day, I figured I'd made enough flyers, and it was time to start posting. Things were going great. I hit each block in Williamsburg. One guy said, ""Drawings are cute. Your son has a lot of artistic talent."" Weird. He must have been super high. With the last flyers up, it was time to hit the liquor store for a couple of kegs! Man, I was in for a real surprise. Apparently, there were no kegs available on such short notice. I went to three stores too! Nothing! It's like the whole world was against JC! How else was I supposed to get the party rockin?? Figured I'd pick up a bunch of growlers. Growlers are def the Brooklyn way. A man and a giant jug of beer. What more could you ask for? It's exactly what JC would want for his triumphant return. I can see the smile on his face when I say, ""JC! My man, good to see you out. Got you a growler, bud.""I headed over to Beer Street. Grabbed as many growlers as I could carry, four to be exact, and headed over to my bud Yhoagie's rooftop. His rooftop isn't much and technically we aren't supposed to be up there but his landlord is in another country so it's chill. We polished off a growler each while setting up the chips n dips. We were feeling real good too. You never want to be 100% sober at your party, but you never want to be 100% a mess either. You want to be in that perfect zone where life comes at you real fast but you still have time to stop and say what's up. We cranked up the tunes. Yhoagie said we should put on that wiener Justen Beeber. I said I don't listen to kids music, but Yhoagie said it's the best way to start a party then transition into the ""harder"" stuff. Whatever that means. It was still early in the evening, and we had a couple hours to kill until the party so we figured we should eat. I'd been feeling all Southern since my trip to New Orleans so biscuits were just what I needed. We headed over to BeeHive. It's a neighborhood secret. Shh. We told the waitress our appetites were big; we were getting ready for ""Easter Funday: The Return of JC""! She hadn't heard about it, but she was def into it. Could tell by the twinkle in her eye. We looked up and next thing we know these two cute babes asked if they could join our table! They overheard us. They were going to Easter Funday! This calls for a round of drinks! Or 3 rounds!Dinner was a blur. We ended up back at the rooftop but the party had been ransacked! I said JC must have come, chilled and gotten pissed no one was there to party! Yhoagie said it was prob rats. Buzzkill. The girls said they had drinks back at their place a few blocks away. The rest of the details are not for you. Get your own life!Oh and by the way: We got the chicken fried chicken, shrimp n grits, the Moselle and a Cinna Biscuit! I'd died and gone to chicken heaven! Chicken perfectly fried. Biscuits so buttery. Cinna Biscuit puts the cinnabon to shame. Service was on point and John the owner makes you feel like you're home. It's a place to relax and eat. A real gem.",5.0
"Eh, I am kinda disappointed. Maybe it was me, I think I ordered the wrong thing... Obviously the New Orleans sandwich I ordered was delicious, hence the rating. Service was quick and friendly. The restaurant is small, of course. My cousin and I did not have trouble getting seated right away since we came around 4PM but I can see it being a problem earlier, or during more popular hour.The New Orleans sandwich was great, it looked small but was so filling. The sausage gravy is literally perfection! The jelly was a great compliment.",4.0
"Decent Southern food, but nothing particularly special.We arrived as a party of 6 on a Saturday at 11 AM and ended up having to wait about 45 minutes; it's a pretty small space and is probably not that bad of a wait for smaller parties, but very limited seating for larger groups.We ordered the picnic platter to start, which was nice; I enjoyed the deviled eggs and the biscuit bites. I ended up making my own biscuit for my meal--I had sausage gravy on fried chicken with cheese and some dressing. The fried chicken and the biscuit were solid, and the portion size a bit on the smaller end. I did sample some of my friend's jam for her biscuit, which was quite good.It was a nice meal overall, but it's a bit out of the way and tougher for larger groups. Wouldn't be a bad option for smaller parties if you're in the area.",3.0

May be it's the fact that most sweet tea flavor I have had was incorporated into some kind of cocktail with sweet tea vodka, but I felt like the lemonade tasted a bit alcoholic.Made my own biscuit with fried chicken and honey. Waitress was really nice and gave me extra honey without the extra charge. Wanted to try the fried green tomatoes but they were out. Shared the mac and cheese with my bf. Not the greatest, but much better than Atwoods ""best mac n cheese in NYC."" Boyfriend got the premade biscuit with fried chicken, fried egg, collard greens, and hot sauce. He wasn't blown away with his dish either, but we were both pleased with the whole experience. Fair prices. As for the biscuits themselves, I guess it depends what you like in your biscuit. I think my standard is Bob White's biscuit which is on the doughier, flakier side. These biscuits are very traditional as in the harder, more crumbly kind. Mine was a little overcooked :( boyfriend's was a bit better. I'd say it's not really all it's hyped up to be on yelp, but it's solid.",3.0
"Tried this place out with a friend.    Not in a bustling part of the town, not really easy to get to from the city.Ordered a custom sandwich - fried chicken with ""salad"" and sausage gravy with the sauces on the side.  Not cheap to build your own, around 13+.  More like  snack portion and to be honest,it was not memorable.  I dont remember what it was like.  I have to scroll back to my IG to remember what it was.The chicken was good, Ill say that,but the sauce was overwhelming and the greens...for $1...i got like a few spinach...really?  the sauces were off...did not go well with my sandwich..not impressed at all and im sad that i spend money here",3.0
When I tell you that the chicken pot pie was everything & more with a biscuit topping! Omg! And if I need a fix of fried green tomatoes - I'm taking a Bee line straight to this cozy & quaint spot! It felt like being in a Southern Country breakfast nook-I absolutely loved the setting & the 5 star service! The chocolate cake was the bomb.com-and pimento mac & cheese was really good!  I'll most definitely be back!,5.0
Sat at the counter with my buddy for a quick brunch before continuing on our Brooklyn adventure. Our waitress was super friendly and totally made the experience. The biscuits were exceptionally good and the fried chicken was made to perfection. We also had a cinnamon-biscuit dessert thing that was similar to a cinnamon roll but just better. Way better. I would definitely go out of the way to come here again when visiting NY.,5.0
"The atmosphere of this restaurant is darling and the service was prompt. We ordered the deviled eggs for an appetizer. I thought they were yummy - white different as they seem to be made with more vinegar than mayo, and thus has a bit of a tang to them. However, for those who are expecting a creamy, mayo-laden egg - you might be surprised by the dish.I ordered shrimp and grits for my entree. It was OK...nothing special. I prefer the shrimp and grist at Sweet Chick down the street.For desert, we ordered the plum bread pudding with caramel sauce - definitely the highlight of the meal. It was drizzled with homemade caramel sauce which puts all other sauces to shame.Overall, I thought that the food was overpriced for what it was. if I came back, I would have an all-dessert meal.",3.0
"When you come to this part of Brooklyn you must prepare yourself for lack of parking. Just know you'll be circling for at least 1/2 hr.Once we got inside we were to hungry to notice the decor. But we got stumped by the menu... everything sounded great. We got the deviled eggs...they were okay...nothing spectacular. The biscuit or bread you get when you come in is delicious!I elected to make my own chicken biscuit w/ and egg and a spread I can't pronounce. It was good.. but it was on the small side.. like a snack. My friend got the Sandra...which I pronounced different from our waiter and he seemed miffed that I did and corrected me...sorry my mom pronounces her name that way. Anywho., this place was good but I've had better. It's not worth the parking aggravation.",3.0
"I don't know where to start. lets just start by saying I really really enjoyed myself and literally dreamed about the food the next night. I had the Sandra which was and pen faces biscuit with sausage gravy on top and a fried egg. The texture was oooey gooey and the taste was phenomenal, i'm gonna cry just thinking about it. backtracking a bit here, we started with the fried green tomatoes and the complementary veggies and buttermilk ranch. both where very good. our Hostess/Waitress was super nice, she reminded me of an old friend and was very personable with us like we knew each other. I felt very comfortable with her and she did not hesitate to give us truthful recommendations about the food. You could tell that they where bringing that southern hospitality style service. we decided to get dessert, because I figured that it would be good, and boy was I right. We got the special, which was biscuit pudding, and it was heaven. The interior was designed super cute, and was sooo clean, you could probably eat off teh floor, but please don't. At the end of the night Jonathan introduced himself to us and made us feel very welcome to come back, which I will!!!!",5.0
"Wandered into Williamsburg with my sisters for dinner on a Saturday night without any reservations. All the places we were interested in were booked for the night or had an hour long wait. So we took to Yelp and came across this quaint biscuit cafe -- no wait!The 4 of us was seated in a corner booth seat. The metallic tables are on the smaller side so it can be cramped (my sister rested her knee on my thigh -.-) the decor is nice and reflects the restaurant's ties to Texas, where one of the owners hails from. There's a black chalkboard near the kitchen where they write their daily specials and some of the drinks they have available. We started off with veggies and buttermilk ranch dip on the house. It came with carrots, cherry tomatoes, and some greens. Then we moved on to the Picnic platter (~$12)-- bite sized biscuits, 2 halved deviled eggs, pimento cheese, ham, and some veggies. It comes with a small portion of any jam for the biscuits.For entrees we tried: Shrimp & Grits, Moselle biscuit sammie with fried chicken, and one of the specials the Frito pie. The shrimp & grits was good -- smaller portion than what I had anticipated based on my previous experience. It came with 5 shrimps and some bacon bits as well as a biscuit. I felt it could've been more flavorful, adding some spice to it would've given it a nice kick and cheese to make it more savory. At $18, it was also overpriced. I had a bigger portion with more shrimps and flavor for $14 the first time I tried Shrimps & Grits in SF. The Moselle biscuit sandwich ($9.75) was okay -- it came with collard greens, fried egg, and fried chicken that wasn't really crunchy served with a side of coleslaw. Frito pie ($13) was basically a deconstructed taco with a sunny side up egg. We tried the strawberry, peach (my favorite), and vanilla pear jams with our biscuits. The biscuits tasted just okay and are really overpriced at $3 a piece. Overall, the food was good, but not amazing. There's plenty of other places in the city that have better southern style food.Service was good -- there was only 1 waitress handling all the tables in the restaurant (maybe about 7 tables total in the restaurant). She was friendly and quick to refill our water. Dishes came out quickly too. We liked how she said ""ya'll"" when she was talking to us, it made it feel more authentically south. This is a nice alternative if you don't have reservations or don't wait an hour to have dinner. Also good to check out if you're really into biscuits. Afterall, biscuits make up half their menu and it's a biscuit cafe!",3.0
"Considering how hungry I was anything would have tasted good, right?  They gave me dry salad instead of apple slaw as advertised.  How does a restaurant with 4 stars on yelp give me dry lettuce salad mix with no dressing. who does that??the Charlotte is chicken stew that looks like water chicken noodle soup with no salt or any flavor. i could have eaten Campbells and it would be better than the bland soup i got.SO BLAND.  Biscuit was dry but I dunked it in the watery mess to get it a little softer.No thanks Beehive.",2.0

For you health conscious peeps, don't worry it's not THAT heavy, but okay, it IS a treat.  HANDS DOWN, the sausage gravy with fried chicken is the best I've ever had in my life. Do NOT skip out on the sausage gravy. After noticing all of their signage, they are an Austin based restaurant - and I must say, even in Austin it was not as good as BeeHive. We truly have it good here without traveling down south to get one of the many plates the South has to offer. It's a small restaurant, so make sure you plan ahead by blocking a chunk out of your schedule! You cannot call in to make reservations, so you have show up and hope for the best.

"This place is off the beaten path that's for sure, but well worth it.  It's an awesome hidden gem.  We were staying at midtown during this past Christmas Holiday and did have to travel to Brooklyn for this meal, but like I said it was well worth it.  The subway ride there was not bad at all, and then took a short cab ride to the restaurant.  I highly recommend making reservations first, because like most restaurants in New York, they are quite small.We were there during brunch so we had both breakfast and lunch items, but not that it mattered because they serve breakfast items all day.  I had the chicken fried steak on mashed potatoes with mushroom gravy.  My wife had The Nettie chicken biscuit; and our daughter had the Kick Start Breakfast.  It's best to get different dishes to experience all the wonderful tastes.The chicken fried steak was great.  It was not overly salty as most chicken fried steaks can be.  The mushroom gravy was a different touch, but still good and hearty.  The steak was tender as well.  I got to sample my wife's Nettie and that was also great.  The biscuit is one of the better biscuits I have eaten.  I also was able to taste the biscuit and sausage gravy off of our daughters Kick Start breakfast and it was also great.  The wife also ordered 2 deviled eggs, which were good too.  This place is worth the trip to Brooklyn if you don't already have business over in that area.I forgot to mention that the owners are transplanted Texans who opened this place up, so you will definitely see the Texas theme throughout.  Don't forget to do a check in on Yelp, and you will get a Lone Star beer for $3 or a Mimosa.  Though read the chalk board before you order your Lone Star beer because they might have another offer for the same price on a better beer.  Like I wish I would have read the board that day before I got my Lone Star because they had Stella's for the same price that day.",5.0

"I was so excited to try this place out and the raving reviews definitely had my hopes for high expectations. First off, do not attempt to drive in this area, it took us only an hour to find parking. Arrived around 1pm on a Sunday and expected wait was 45mins, but guess what? We were called within 5mins! Score? Seated promptly I decided to dig right in and order the main entree, Chicken Fried Chicken Steak with Mashed Potato and Mushroom Gravy. My husband decided to go with the Brunch special Chicken Fried Chicken Steak with Eggs, Grits and biscuit. Plated looked gorgeous, but sadly the food was mediocre at best. I was hugely disappointed and didn't know what the buzz was all about. My husband's platter only came with 2 small pieces of chicken. Mine on the other hand had a good portion of chicken. The chicken was not crispy and just tasted average. Potatoes and gravy was also average.Since this place is known for biscuits I ordered a side order of the biscuit which sadly was hard on the outside and not so great. Besides the food, the service and decor was pretty nice. Overall experience, I wouldn't wait 40mins in line or go out of my way to come out here again.",3.0

"I was so sad to see that Pies N Thighs was closed when I tried to go there, but it must have been a blessing in disguise because we found this place and decided to eat here instead! We came in around 4, and it was pretty empty. Right from when we walked in, I could tell that service was going to be great! This place has a very home-y feel to it. They welcomed us, let us choose our drinks and our sever got us started with waters and menus. She also informed us of their great happy hour deals! They started us off with some veggies and dip - a very nice touch. It gave us something fresh to contrast with the heavy meal we were about to have I made my own biscuit and got it with a chicken fried steak. So good! The coating was nice and crispy and the steak was flavorful. It was a little dry, but that's on me for not adding gravy. The biscuit had a fluffy inside and crunchy exterior, which I loved. Their mashed potatoes were also solid, but nothing too special. My boyfriend had deviled eggs (which he enjoyed) as well as the Nettie. I got to try a bite, and it was an excellent sandwich. Lastly, we had the hummingbird cake for dessert. It was huge! Definitely worth the $6. The buttercream frosting paired really nicely with the cake. The only con is that their portions may be a little smaller than expected. I'm a smaller than average person, and this was the perfect size for me. Otherwise, great job!",4.0
"Cutesy place, love the warm decor.Like most of BK hippest place I won't even touch on parking. Good luck.They were doing some building contraction above so it was hard to find this place. Not sure really what I was thinking when I wanted good ol' should food up in NYC but I gave it a shot.And it missed.Staff was nice. Menu was cute. Everything made me real hopefully, but it just seemed like this place was trying to be too Southern and not really understanding what it means. Just cause you have biscuits and grits that don't make you from the south.My deathbed meal is shrimp and grits. Therefore, I can be a harsh critic. The shrimp and grits here was super watery and had a tomatoey taste. Not a lot of flavor neither. The jam served however was the shit, I literally contemplating thieving some and taking it home with me. But...that might be illegal.The sampler plate was boring. The presentation was lacking and it didn't make me hunger, it looked like something at an old people's home.I had biscuits. And I hate them. Gave these a shot and they were the run of the mill regular betties. Coffee was okay.The best part was the mimosas. I had the elderberry and regular one. The elderberry was unique but wouldn't have it again. Definitely go for the reg. one. It was tasty.Overall? Mmm, this southern belle was not impressed.",2.0
"Wonderful new addition to the area! Homey vibe, welcoming individuals and tasty food. I adore the fried green tomatoes and the Nettie sandwich and red velvet cake.

"I love this place so much. There's nothing I will change. Me and friend went here and got the weekend special which was two eggs, Texas shaped waffle and some friend chicken for $16 and it was deliciousssss! I will come here again and again. Get the cinnamon biscuit!! YummyyyyThe wait time was about an hour we got there @ 1230 on a Sunday (it was a very small restaurant) so that's not too bad",5.0
"hate to give this place a bad review since the decor was nice and the service was good...however the portions were really tiny. The food was just okay, I had the biscuit with mushroom gravy and  sausage and bacon. i didn't find the biscuits to be amazing even though the name of the place is Biscuit Cafe.  Honestly the food is comparable to cracker barrel, except at cracker barrel you get a bigger portion for a cheaper price.",2.0
"This place is off the beaten path that's for sure, but well worth it.  It's an awesome hidden gem.  We were staying at midtown during this past Christmas Holiday and did have to travel to Brooklyn for this meal, but like I said it was well worth it.  The subway ride there was not bad at all, and then took a short cab ride to the restaurant.  I highly recommend making reservations first, because like most restaurants in New York, they are quite small.We were there during brunch so we had both breakfast and lunch items, but not that it mattered because they serve breakfast items all day.  I had the chicken fried steak on mashed potatoes with mushroom gravy.  My wife had The Nettie chicken biscuit; and our daughter had the Kick Start Breakfast.  It's best to get different dishes to experience all the wonderful tastes.The chicken fried steak was great.  It was not overly salty as most chicken fried steaks can be.  The mushroom gravy was a different touch, but still good and hearty.  The steak was tender as well.  I got to sample my wife's Nettie and that was also great.  The biscuit is one of the better biscuits I have eaten.  I also was able to taste the biscuit and sausage gravy off of our daughters Kick Start breakfast and it was also great.  The wife also ordered 2 deviled eggs, which were good too.  This place is worth the trip to Brooklyn if you don't already have business over in that area.I forgot to mention that the owners are transplanted Texans who opened this place up, so you will definitely see the Texas theme throughout.  Don't forget to do a check in on Yelp, and you will get a Lone Star beer for $3 or a Mimosa.  Though read the chalk board before you order your Lone Star beer because they might have another offer for the same price on a better beer.  Like I wish I would have read the board that day before I got my Lone Star because they had Stella's for the same price that day.",5.0
"The food was awesome. I went here on a weekday for brunch. They weren't too busy so our waitress was very attentive and nice. I had the devil eggs which was a delicious starter along with the chicken fried chicken. My meal was filling and delicious. the decor of the place is of a hip cafe with a chill, laid back vibe. I'll definitely be coming back.",5.0

"If you don't know much about Southern cooking, there's only two things you need to know - you're going to leave full, and you will receive the best service of your life. On both counts, BeeHive Oven fires on all cylinders.I originally came here for a Yelp Elite event (review here: yelp.com/biz/elite-event…), so I was able to sample a lot of their food before coming back properly. As soon as I walked in, I was greeted by the owner John, who remembered me from a few weeks back. Just the nicest guy ever. Incredibly gracious and humble.For some background, this place specializes in biscuits (did I blow your mind?). The place isn't huge, but it just adds to the charm. Speaking of size, the biscuit sandwiches aren't wide, but they are stacked HIGH. So it's a lot more food than you'd expect. I'd tried the Moselle before (fried chicken, collards, fried egg and hot sauce), and this time around went with the Nettie (fried chicken, iceberg, bacon and buttermilk dressing). Picking my favorite between the two would be like choosing my favorite nonexistent child. But I'm gonna go with the Nettie just because of the delicious crispy bacon (I'd make a questionable parent).Speaking of parents (or grandparents, rather), the reason they call their biscuit sandwiches Grandmother biscuits is because each one is named after the owners'/employees' grandmothers. They told us this story at the Yelp event and my heart just about melted.The side of the day was green beans with bacon. If you can't tell, I will never pass on an opportunity to eat more bacon. But there were greens in it, so they must've been somewhat healthy, right? Right?All in all, BeeHive definitely seems like a great brunch type of place, though you would leave equally full after dinner. Next time I come back with an emptier stomach, I'm going to have the shrimp and grits and the chicken fried steak again. I still have dreams about those...Funny story - the day after, I went to Smorgasburg at Brooklyn Bridge Park and didn't realize BeeHive had a stand there.

"Stopped in here on a whim after starting an early morning in Williamsburg, and had a strange calling for biscuits. I guess it's not THAT strange since biscuits are buttery pieces of manna. So anyway, it being a weekday, parking wasn't an issue, so I whipped over to BeeHive to finally check the place out. I went for the ""kickstarter"" (something like that) breakfast -- two biscuits in white sausage gravy, eggs, bacon, and fruit salad. Well, my biscuit craving was satisfied. A lot. Great way to start the day. The biscuits were fantastic and fresh, the bacon was hefty, and the eggs were done right and I felt like there were more than two on my plate. The fruit salad also gave some much-needed nutrition to my gluttony. My server was also very attentive and happy to top off my coffee a few times. I do think the prices are a touch high but hey, this is an independent eatery making food that takes skill and passion to pull off right. It's worth it, and what a great start to my day!",4.0

Texts and calls when your table is ready. Pretty cool and efficient. Fried okra and green tomatoes are good. The sauce that comes with it is amazing.Biscuits are ok, not the best.

"Patronized this establishment with my lady for dinner on a Saturday. I was surprised we didn't have to wait, I can see how this place would get packed. Its small, intimate decor, is a little tight, but room enough. Nothing wrong with getting cozy with someone you don't know. It was nice and clean (+). The service was top notch, though it seemed only one waitress was on duty. She was very attentive and gave sound recommendations. Good stuff. The food was the reason for the visit- heard about this place on Yelp. It did not disappoint. I ordered a custom made biscuit sandwich and it was frigging swell- fried chicken, fried green tomato and sausage gravy. I didn't think it would be enough, but it definitely was. My lady also enjoyed her meal immensely. The caramel apple biscuit pudding was the stuff of legend. Word of warning- the sauce comes out damn hot, hot enough to roast your tongue. Don't become a victim. You want all your taste buds to fully enjoy the deliciousness.  Great establishment- worth another visit. 5 Stars",5.0

"A tale of true love. A girl on a quest for biscuits and gravy wandered into a more-delicious-than-anticipated trap and it's not exactly a short story. Here we go:So, this show-stopper has been on my list to try for quite some time, and it's not far from a friend's apartment OK, it's three blocks away! But sometimes, you know, you just can't make it and DoorDash isn't working!!One of the greatest things at Beehive is the down home feel that radiates from the heart of this buzzing biscuit bakery. Outside is a screen door, resembling one on a front porch, so you literally feel like you're walking into someone's house down south (or at the very least a back porch in the suburbs). The feel inside is quaint, with booth seats lining the walls, and folding chairs on the other sides of the tables. Super casual, very warm and extremely friendly staff. Now, my first experience here happened to be, you guessed it- FISH FRY FRIDAY -- say that ten times fast!! And I must admit, it's not why I made my first trip here. I had a serious craving for biscuits and gravy. I hadn't gotten a fix in approximately 5 days and I was hurting pretty bad.So, when the hostess/waitress with short hair and tattoos immediately greeted me and started selling me the promotional ""Fish Fry Friday"", triple F, hot ticket item, I was first inclined to ignore anything she said that was not BISCUIT + GRAVY. However, she seemed really enthusiastic about it. Actually, so much so that her coworker behind the bar gave her an incredulous look that seemed to say, ""chill, you're pushing the wrong thing. She didn't even ask you for all that"". And in that moment, the man behind the bar was reading my mind. She was barking up the wrong tree. But I asked about the meal and what was included in it and she said a great many things that sounded good to me. She pushed the Fish Fry Friday HARD, so I gave it a chance because I felt a bit pressured, honestly. And here's where the game was changed...because it wasn't what I was craving. I didn't even know it existed at the time I arrived, and I am so thankful to this beautiful Beehive Beauty who made the suggestion. I loved it.FISH FRY FRIDAY ($18) includes 5 battered flounder strips; coleslaw; pinto beans; maque choux corn fritters; and a biscuit, of course! Fish Fry was take out and the flounder was fried perfectly in a flavorful cornmeal batter. There was zero excess oil, the fish was not overdone, not overly salty. It was JUST RIGHT! And my food was ready in about 8 minutes flat.I was seriously geeked about this meal, once I took my first bites of everything. The fish is paired with their sexy, savory remoulade that deserves its own honorable mention! Holy shit, lemon and cayenne and relish? And this condiment is all I need to die happy. Pinto beans weren't out of this world, but were pretty good. I would have preferred them with a hint of fresh hot peppers and would appreciate them being a tad warmer, but it's all good. And, I mean, realll good. Coleslaw was mayo-free, and seemed to have a pickled element along with some golden raisins and celery. Overall, acted like a bit of a palate cleanser between the various components of the meal. Then there was the biscuit--butter milky layers of heaven. I can only imagine how nice dem buns would be with any of their many amazing sounding jams!!! Haven't had a the opportunity yet to sample their assorted jams, but some day real soon, I'll slather up a biscuit and call myself 'elated'.Maque choux corn fritters--light, tasteful, bursts of whole sweet corn kernels in your mouth. These babies were beautifully fried, expertly seasoned, not at all oily and had a perfect cornmeal crisp coat! I'M IN LOVE! This is where the magic all happened. I am seriously hurt that these aren't a part of their normal menu, but maybe I can become an influencer of sorts...Anyway I was fearful to eat the last 1 of 3 because, you know, I want more than 3. Damn!Lemonade was delicious and not too sweet, and I took it home to spike it with Jameson--TGIF, girl!Second visit was a quickie solo snack. I can only fight off the gravy craving for so long, and while the fish was nice, I remained a woman on a respectable mission. So, I popped in for the illustrious chicken biscuit and topped it with sausage gravy. I was hesitant to stack a biscuit that was so heavy with chicken and gravy with anything else because this is about is perfect as it gets, but I'll try a ton of combinations in the future. This is the stuff dreams are made of. This gravy is worth going broke for. It's worth getting a personal assistant to pick up your dinner every night so that you can hide your shame of gravy addiction. It's OK, to admit that you are weaker than the buttermilk biscuit and gravy and the warm, tingling sensation that courses through your body with every bite. Damn you, Beehive. Damn you, Pants!!Gave the fried green tomatoes a try (mostly to get my hands on some remoulade)..love it here.",5.0
"A must!  My wife and I came here for brunch with high expectations based on everyones yep reviews.

"Really cute little breakfast place. We came for a late breakfast with a group of four on a Wednesday morning and there were plenty of tables. Service was speedy and our waitress was great about offering us a few suggestions.We did a share plate of the fried green tomatoes to start - they came out quickly and were delicious, the remoulade sauce was the perfect compliment to the dish. I had the hot cider lemonade to drink and it was full of flavor and not too sweet, also served as the perfect pick-me-up from the cold weather. We all ordered something from the grandmother biscuit section for our main dish, I had the Moselle which was outstanding.",5.0
"Love love love. They give you veggies with this ranch dressing stuff that is confusingly amazing. It's ranch - how can it be that good? And yet here we are.Get the deviled eggs (the big order). Get the wings with jezebel sauce. Get the French Quarter or the Pot Pie with an egg on top. Get some shrimp and grits. Then a biscuit sandwich. Or maybe just a biscuit with either the mushroom or sausage gravy. Then have dessert. Then go home and unzip your pants and lay on your couch for 3 hours, minimum. You won't regret it.",5.0
"Stopped in here on a whim after starting an early morning in Williamsburg, and had a strange calling for biscuits. I guess it's not THAT strange since biscuits are buttery pieces of manna. So anyway, it being a weekday, parking wasn't an issue, so I whipped over to BeeHive to finally check the place out. I went for the ""kickstarter"" (something like that) breakfast -- two biscuits in white sausage gravy, eggs, bacon, and fruit salad. Well, my biscuit craving was satisfied. A lot. Great way to start the day. The biscuits were fantastic and fresh, the bacon was hefty, and the eggs were done right and I felt like there were more than two on my plate. The fruit salad also gave some much-needed nutrition to my gluttony. My server was also very attentive and happy to top off my coffee a few times. I do think the prices are a touch high but hey, this is an independent eatery making food that takes skill and passion to pull off right. It's worth it, and what a great start to my day!",4.0
"This is what I've been looking for since I moved to NY.  Exactly what breakfast is supposed to be - the Boot Strap is a great way to get a day started. Their biscuits are fantastic, fluffy and just the right texture. But the real star to me is the homemade jams which come in a variety of flavors. Absolutely killer. It's also great for dinner - chicken fried steak & the pimiento Mac and cheese are so good it's scary.  Great service, great food, can't recommend it highly enough.",5.0

"Beehive Oven Biscuit Cafe had caught my eye a few months back, thanks to a healthy barrage of near-perfect reviews, all espousing about their biscuits and fried chicken. While Southern cuisine may not be at the forefront of my list of cuisines, I found myself in Williamsburg on a Saturday afternoon and Beehive was an easy choice. The space is low-key and welcoming, sporting a windowed front (perfect for catching the sunshine during brunch or an early dinner), thick wooden beams across the walls, and miscellaneous paintings and chalkboards to round out the décor.We were able to get seated immediately at a small two-top, and were immediately presented with a crudité plate as a welcoming bite. The vegetables were crisp and fresh, and the pairing with a creamy ranch dressing was foolproof. It was enough to whet our appetites as we went through the food menu, which includes Starters and Sides, as well as their famous Biscuit Sandwiches, available in pre-set or a make-your-own option.I opted to go for The Nettie, one of their sandwiches that featured chopped Iceburg Wedge, crisp Bacon, and a piece of Fried Chicken topped with buttermilk dressing and sandwiched between two biscuit halves. It was an impressive plate, especially given the sheer height of the sandwich - which required some disassembly in order to eat. The chicken had the perfect exterior, with plenty of breading and seasoning, while the interior white meat still retained its tenderness. It was perfectly paired with the savory bacon and the creamy dressing, and even more satisfying against the crisp-moist biscuit. Those biscuits though... I'm not sure how they do it, but I'm sure that the utilization of their beehive oven, a smaller iteration that's typically attached to the kitchen hearth, is part of the secret. With a side of crisp, sweet Apple Raisin Slaw, it made for a well-balanced and refreshing plate.I wish we'd had the opportunity to try more dishes at Beehive, but from the sampling that we did have, each component is given a great deal of care - from the seductive biscuits, to the addictive fried chicken, and even to their simple slaw. Service is welcoming and friendly and prices certainly won't break the bank - what more do you need?",4.0

The chicken had the perfect exterior, with plenty of breading and seasoning, while the interior white meat still retained its tenderness. It was perfectly paired with the savory bacon and the creamy dressing, and even more satisfying against the crisp-moist biscuit. Those biscuits though... I'm not sure how they do it, but I'm sure that the utilization of their beehive oven, a smaller iteration that's typically attached to the kitchen hearth, is part of the secret. With a side of crisp, sweet Apple Raisin Slaw, it made for a well-balanced and refreshing plate.I wish we'd had the opportunity to try more dishes at Beehive, but from the sampling that we did have, each component is given a great deal of care - from the seductive biscuits, to the addictive fried chicken, and even to their simple slaw. Service is welcoming and friendly and prices certainly won't break the bank - what more do you need?",4.0
"Took my bf here for a nice birthday breakfast before our day festivities began. The intimate warm ambiance was refreshing because it was a cold morning. We were welcomed by a sweet smile which to me matters.  The deviled eggs were good but that butternut squash soup......was when I was sold. But not necessarily for the soup (which was rich & tasty) but for the biscuits that came with it. O....M....G.... . My bf and I created our own biscuit breakfast sandwich and the freshness of the ingredients, the warmth & flakiness of the biscuit is why I'm writing this review. Amazeballllsssssss! Ended with a nice hot chocolate. Great great great hidden gem. Will be back next week",5.0
"Oh man. How do I even start. Craving some good southern comfort food? I mean, GOOD southern comfort food?? This place has build your own biscuits starting at 3 dollars and you have close to 15 add ons to pile up. I went with the classic fried chicken and mushroom gravy, which totalled was 8 dollars. The chicken was perfectly crisp and juicy, and the mushroom gravy overflowed off the biscuit onto the plate. My biscuit was soaked. There are other toppings to try like chicken fried steak, bacon, sausage, different vegetables and different creams and sauces. Beer selection is great as well, as most of their selection is from astoria/brooklyn/long island. Definitely coming back.",5.0
"Such a sweet little place! While the food was a little precious in the hipster way that many of the nearby places are these days in Williamsburg, but the ambience managed to be down to earth and friendly.

"Another week, another Brooklyn brunch.  I've been to brunch more times in the past month than I've been in the past two years (I like to sleep in on weekends I suppose).  But the team was in the mood for southern fixin's... and as the democratically appointed Yelper of the team, I selected the new kid on the block: Beehive Oven Biscuit Cafe.  Southern inspired cuisine???

"This place is really great. It's a cute, quaint cafe with a simple menu and absolutely delicious food. My friend and I tried pretty much everything on the menu: deviled eggs, pimento mac and cheese, fried green tomatoes, biscuits with fried chicken, biscuits with egg, mushroom gravy and collard greens, mashed potatoes, all different sauces and honeys, some drinks, etc. Everything was tasty and reasonably priced. The staff was fantastic, our waitress was attentive and super sweet, and we met the owner, John, who was fantastic and genuinely cared about his customers. 100% will definitely be going back and recommending BeeHive Oven.",5.0
"I felt full of joy walking in! The bar covered in poisenettas, little fairy lights hung about, brushed, brightly colored tables and the lights all diffused in what looks to be colanders - how I dream my own kitchen to be!Service was kind, but not over the top. Meals were served quickly, straight out of the kitchen. Fresh. Great biscuits! Coffee is good, and them fried green tomatoes... Holla!Will definitely be back. Perfect spot for a little weekend brunch :)",5.0
"A great place for a lazy afternoon. A friend and I walked in around 3 o'clock on a Sunday afternoon and had to wait for 30 mins. We weren't upset, so we decided to wait around. Also, we were told it was cash only so we took the wait to grab some money from the bank. But the wait was worth it. From the minute we sat down we were really satisfied. This is even taking into account that they ran out of chicken that day. Everyone was so nice and apologetic and we ordered the chicken fried steak and biscuits. They were simply delicious. And when we got the bill we weren't upset either. Quality food at a very reasonable price.And the vibe was really great. Simple and great haven right in Brooklyn. I am definitely coming back and trying the chicken but just from what I had, I definitely recommend trying this place out!",5.0
"Loved this little Texas joint in the middle of Williamsburg! I came here for brunch with a group of friends and left happy and longing for Texas.  This simple menu consists of build-your-own biscuits, chicken-fried steak , Fried Chicken Green Salad, Shrimp and Grits, Chicken Pot Pies, wings, and deviled eggs.  Everything was delicious.  If you are craving some Texas home-style cooking I definitely suggest you check this place out.  Also, they make splitting checks with groups easily as they can put each check on a separate tab.",5.0
"Beehive is a small and cozy spot, had a seat at the bar. Got the kick start breakfast, two eggs two slices of bacon and biscuit  with gravy. Eggs and bacon are just like anywhere else but the gravy biscuit was so soft and fluffy. It was nothing like the run of the mill fast food biscuit that I expected to have, I could order just the biscuit and nothing else.",4.0
"I had dinner here the other night. We walked right in - no reservation. It took FOREVER to get our food due to some miscommunication with the kitchen. This was difficult to swallow, but they tried to make it right with numerous apologies and a free order of deviled eggs which was nice. I had a biscuit sandwich with fried green tomato and shrimp and fried okra on the side. It was very good. My friend had a chicken pot pie. She really liked it. I had a nice glass (or two) of Lambrusco. Would love to return.",4.0

"I visited BeeHive Oven when I was in the area shopping - it had just opened not too long ago and PayPal was offering some credit, so I decided to try out a few of their items for takeout.  Based on my tastes, I really want to come back when I feel like trekking out to W'burg and try out their full-on entrees as well.Obviously it didn't taste as good since I brought it all the way from Williamsburg to Midtown Manhattan, but we'll discount that fact for now.  The bottom line is, these Grandmother chicken biscuits are good.  Better than Pies N Thighs good.  These people are legitimately from the South.4 stars -Naturally, I went for the Moselle, since I love spicy food.  Fried chicken, collard greens, a fried egg and hot sauce...come on now... any true Southern belle would go for this.  The chicken was flavorful, the batter was not too much, and the toppings were of course, delicious.  $9 for the biscuit though... that's a little steep.  I mean I could be satisfied with a Chick-fil-a biscuit for under $3....3 stars - I also had the homemade red velvet cake as well as the chocolate cake.  I wouldn't call home about either of them, but on a scale of 1-5, I'd say 3.5 stars - Great service and Southern hospitality.",4.0
"I came here because it was too late to go to Pies n Thighs, they were closed for brunch. I had the chicken sandwich with the jezebel sauce, which was not very good.

"Yesus piece!!!! If this place was anywhere close to me I would be a big fat sow!!! I came here after a spin class, I needed to reward myself. (Yeah, yeah, yeah I know)Anyway....... We spoke with the owner John while we waited for a table (quick turnaround) He was extreme friendly and exhibited that wonderful southern hospitality that we miss here in the concrete jungle! He gave us some direction of what was on the menu. The menu isn't extensive but has enough options so you wouldn't get bored. Charlie our server was also very helpful and helped us decide. We ordered The Nueces (fried shrimp poboy), it came with an order of Corn fritters (maque fritters). They remind me of hush puppies but much, much better!!! I ordered the bootstrap; eggs over easy, grits, bacon, and a biscuit.  I added the sausage gravy on the side. So happy I did... It was really good! Not as heavy as other places but went excellent with the biscuit. They also give you a choice of jams, I tried all three but prefer the ginger plum jam.

"Seriously, BeeHive comes close to one the best hidden gems in BK. I know that's saying a lot but sometimes when you go to a restaurant its not always about the food but more importantly the experience and that's what I love about this place. We decided to try this place because we saw how many reviews and stars this place had received and it was worth it. We walked in and were seated right away which is great! We checked in and received two free Prickly Pear Mimosas which were phenomenal. Shortly after, we ordered our entrees. I had the Chicken Biscuit with cheddar cheese and my wife ordered the Shrimp and Grits. Shortly after waiting for our food, we realized we were sitting next to the owner of the place (John/Treva) and we sparked great conversation and we got the history of how the restaurant came about. It's always great to hear the backstory. He told us what was in store, also mentioned the cooking classes, and what was for sale. He wasn't salesy about it at all! John and his wife are genuine folks that care about providing customers with great food and atmosphere. After our dinner, we ordered dessert and WHOA! Please save room. I really like this place because you get the ""homey"" feel, the food is good, the owner cares, and the customer service is awesome. We'll definitely be back soon!",5.0
Searching for a spot late Sunday afternoon for a place with grits and came across Bee Hive kitchen.  I live in Clinton Hill and this is a 7 minute drive.  It is cute and small and there was wait.  I usually hate waiting but decided to walk the neighborhood.  Glad I did as this shop was having this amazing sidewalk sale and I bought a sweater and 2 designer t-shirts...score! I missed my page but was still able to get our table.They ran out of the chicken biscuit as the guy next to me got the last one.  It was ridiculously beautiful piled high with chicken that smelled amazing.  So good that I ordered wings to go for dinner...good but would have been better fresh out of the fryer.  The coffee was good and the grits were perfectly cooked as only a southerner can do in my opinion.  My friend had the shrimp and grits and raved about it.  The biscuits - AWESOME with the homemade jam.  I also got the jam and biscuits to go and they were still goo after a few days. Great meal for a lazy Sunday.,5.0
The fried chicken biscuit sandwich was out of this world! I should have gotten one to go. And they prices were wonderful! Not what i was expecting at all. The wait staff was great. Very kind and willing to discuss the menu. They also make their own fruit spreads and jams. The peach vanilla was so good we had to buy a jar to bring home. They also had a fairly rare beer from a brewery in South Carolina that i have never had. That's what earned them the 5th star. Finding a beer i have never had is always a treat.,5.0
"Since I work in Williamsburg and love Southern food of course I had to try this place. Cute cozy spot. They have happy hour here so I want to try that. The biscuit with fried chicken, fried green tomato, bacon and ranch was the combo I got. The chicken was very good. The whole sandwich was good and filling. I also had their mac and cheese with the pimento cheese which was good except the bread crumbs were too big it overpowered the mac and cheese. But the whole idea was good I am going to try pimento cheese with my mac and cheese the next time I make it at home, minus the those bread crumbs though. My total was about $20.00. They do take credit cards so that is always a plus.",4.0

"Comfy,small ambiance,great customer service. Quick seating time for Sunday around 1ish.Servers are really nice and friendly!I had the Country Fried Steak with Mushroom sauce,grits,biscuit with strawberry jam and egg.The meal was very satisfying and well seasoned. Not salty but not bland either. I usually dont order white sauce dishes because theyre over creamy or buttery, this mushroom sauce was not! It was just right!The grits  and biscuit were ok. Nothing spectacular to me. I did also think the biscuit was a bit dry, but nothing you can't deal with. I think on one of the sandwiches the biscuit would have been great because they do tend to add some sort of sauce to the sandwich.Strawberry jam- fresh,but a little to sweet for my liking but then again it is jam.The Prickly Lemonade was also delicious, not super sugary a hint of club soda.In all, I would return again if Im craving some southern food.",4.0
"One of the best meals I've ever had. I first tried this place at Smorgasburg in Dec. 2013 and I am so happy they were able to open a stand alone restaurant.

I recommend the build-your-own-biscuit option (I tried the chicken fried steak, sausage gravy and egg option), but their biscuit sandwiches are also very good.  The hummingbird cake (aka Monkey cake outside the South) was good too.

It would maybe be nicer as a relish? just too much mayo to taste the flavor.Everyone gets a small complimentary veggie plate, which is cute and nice while you're waiting.

"Journeyed here with an actual Southerner and got the 411 that the food was pretty legit. We both had variations of the pre-made biscuit sandwiches. I got the Ruby--the creole sauce was dope, and he had the Sandra--sausage gravy was on point. Side of grits was whatever, but I usually feel that way about grits unless they have cheese in them. the Maque Choux--which I had no idea what it was--which is kind of like a hot corn salad was really good. The best part about this place was that they were open before noon! I will def be back.",4.0
"Really good food and great waitstaff. I had the egg salad with cheddar cheese and salad greens on a buttermilk biscuit.

I tried a few of my friend's hushpuppies which were really good, too. I would probably come back to try something with fried chicken since there was a lot of that on the menu.",4.0

I put my name to get a table for two! There was supposed to be a wait of 50miin but we got seated in 30min :-)Great service! Staff is so friendly and the food is amazingggggg! It's a must for a sunday brunch!,4.0
"Journeyed here with an actual Southerner and got the 411 that the food was pretty legit. We both had variations of the pre-made biscuit sandwiches. I got the Ruby--the creole sauce was dope, and he had the Sandra--sausage gravy was on point. Side of grits was whatever, but I usually feel that way about grits unless they have cheese in them. the Maque Choux--which I had no idea what it was--which is kind of like a hot corn salad was really good. The best part about this place was that they were open before noon! I will def be back.",4.0
"Really good food and great waitstaff. I had the egg salad with cheddar cheese and salad greens on a buttermilk biscuit. I never would have thought of this combo before coming to this place but it was really good. The only thing I wish is that the biscuits were a bit bigger because it made it kind of hard to eat. I tried a few of my friend's hushpuppies which were really good, too. I would probably come back to try something with fried chicken since there was a lot of that on the menu.",4.0
"Loved this place! Really quaint little spot slinging some dope southern/texas style grub.Our server was a really friendly kid who was super excited about the food, and I appreciate that in a server.I can see why he was excited: this sh!t was gooood! Had the jezabel wings and fried green tomatoes to start - both fantastic. The main event, of course, was the biscuits. I got mine with chicken, honey and hit sauce (mouthgasm) - while my lady got the chicken fried steak with sausage gravy and collards (good but not as good as mine).Overall I loved it and can't wait to pop one of those buttery, crumbly biscuits in my mouth again.",5.0
"Exactly what I wanted. Biscuits, gravy, toasted tomato and free refills on coffee. It was the perfect start to a fall day, and the server even gave us some helpful hints for finding cheap Broadway tickets while we were in town. Brunch doesn't get better than that! Go here, and your day will seem so much brighter and yummier.",5.0
The service can be a bit slow at times but the food is worthy of waiting. The deviled eggs are a really great starter. The biscuits are flaky and rather filling. I have never been here on the weekend but during the week for lunch getting a table has never been a problem.,5.0
"I'd been craving a chicken biscuit for days... and BeeHive really hit the spot. I had the Nettie and let me tell you, there's not much better than fried chicken, bacon, lettuce and buttermilk dressing, drenched in hot sauce on a flaky biscuit.Loved the plate of veggies brought for the table - nice touch. Great selections on the beer menu, as well - all around a solid spot.",4.0
"What a great first experience at the Biscuit Cafe! Charles was our server and even while waiting on 3 other tables, he was still super attentive and friendly during our meal. We ordered the chicken wings to start and they were HUGE. Very juicy and the buttermilk sauce it came with was so delicious. Then built my own biscuit sandwich with fried chicken, fried green tomato, and honey. It was just the right serving size and I left feeling perfectly full. The highlight of our meal definitely had to be talking to the owner John. We ended up staying an extra hour sharing stories with him. John, thanks for the great meal and talk!!",5.0
Finally a southern restaurant in NYC (Brooklyn) where I can taste the heart and soul put into the ingredients to prepare something magical for your taste buds. It's SO good! I even missed the food after I left- and that's a rarity. I can't even go into detail on how good this is cause I am speechless and still day dreaming about everything we ate!If you go... you can NOT leave without having the peach bread pudding or the dessert gods will haunt you for the rest of your life.

"What a delightful place for brunch! The staff here is extremely friendly and welcoming. This small spot serves up Texas style food with special emphasis on biscuits.

If you are looking for a cozy spot for brunch, this is the best place in town.",5.0

The refreshing Shandy, Bacon from heaven, Deviled Eggs and more. Such a cute and charming little place that always has amazing service and food. I have been telling everyone about it so they may have to build on soon! I have not even tried the cakes or any desserts yet. Thank you to the owners of this wonderful restaurant for always making my day. It is definitely drool worthy!",5.0
"This place is one of the best restaurants I've been to in New York, if not, the best restaurant I've ever been too. The service was excellent and we were seated just after walking in. Our server was attentive and easy to talk with and ask things about the menu. The food was absolutely off the charts. We started off with the fried green tomatoes, fried okra, and the deviled eggs. They were all incredible. The eggs were great and had a very well balanced sweetly and savory thing going on, the tomatoes were fried crispy and were piping hot and delicious, and the okra was some of the best I've had. It also came with a complimentary vegetable plate which was great. For dinner I was tempted to try the make your own biscuit, which I had. The biscuit I ordered with fried chicken, pimento cheese, collard greens, fried egg, and honey mustard. It was everything and more I had hoped for. The chicken was perfectly seasoned and cooked and the biscuit itself was buttery. All the flavors seemed to tie in well. Next time I go I'm going to try some of the already constructed biscuits as they seemed great as well. For dessert we ordered the hummingbird cake. This cake was so delicious it brought my girlfriend to tears because it reminded her of her grandmothers baking back where she grew up in Texas. The best part of the experience was John one of the owners coming out to greet us at various points during the evening. He was great to talk to and it's refreshing that in a city as busy and thriving as New York, an owner cares enough about the customers and their experience to take time to do that. We will definitely be back many many many more times.",5.0

"Living in Williamsburg for over 6yrs, it's hard to keep up with the restaurant boom and all the new places popping up. I'm glad we ventured out to this place because what a gem! It was a quaint and lovely restaurant.As someone who loves fried chicken, I decided to try new foods that I've never had before and I was glad that I did!Fried green tomato with remoulade sauce (which was unreal) was a great starter!My meal consisted of chicken fried steak with grits, 2 sunny side up eggs, biscuit, and strawberry jam. The problem with this meal is that it has now set the bar extremely high if I decide to have chicken fried steak somewhere else! Everything was so flavorful that we can't wait to go back and try everything else. Usually when you land on a dish you love, you end up getting it over and over, but with Beehive, it seems like every table ordered something different because it's the kind of place where you really can't go wrong. The owner was friendly and involved. I'm sure beehive will prosper because of such great cooking and customer service. We look forward to coming back many times and eventually making it to their delicious lookin desserts.",5.0
"As somebody actually from Texas, I was pretty disappointed, especially after expecting a 4 star meal. My chicken pot pie had a dry crust and the seasoning was bland.

"If you could love a place after being there just once, this would be that place! I love comfort food and this place is pretty darn good! I came in around 3 on a Friday and there was no wait to be seated and parking was easy to find. Our waiter was very kind, and the overall mood/feel of the restaurant was very cozy and kind. We even received a complimentary veggie plate. It was a nice snack to tide us over until our food arrived. I LOVE the fried chicken and the mash is good too! Definitely add some hot sauce to your chicken if you love something tangy. The hot sauce isn't hot or spicy but it has the perfect amount of tang! I'm salivating just thinking about it! I definitely want to come back to try their wings and the steak dish.",5.0

Beer cocktails were alright, this place is more about the food than the booze.

The friend I dined with ordered the fried chicken biscuit and her only question to the waiter was ""How do I even begin to eat this?""

"This place is great!  Amazing food, pleasant and attentive service!Waiter was courteous, always making sure we were comfortable.  He made some recommendations that were spot on.Really liked the decor.  It has a Southern feel (they're from Texas), but it's not gimmicky.  Just feels homey.  Not intimidating, low key but not low maintenance.Food:Chicken wings - tangy, sweet, and a tinge of spice.  It melted in our mouths.  Only regret is we got the small (3) instead of the large (6).  Would definitely get again.Moselle chicken sandwich - its a chicken sandwich with egg.  Loved it.  Prob my favorite dish.  Chicken was really tender, possibly the most tender chicken I've had in the city (and we've tried many a places).  The egg yolk made for a perfect complement.Nettie chicken sandwhich - wifey liked this one more.

"""Sometimes even the wrong train can take you to the right destination"" (The Lunchbox)""So, how did you hear about us?"" John, one of the owners, asked me. ""Yelp. I read about you on yelp. The reviews were all glowing"". I responded. To be completely truthful, our intended destination was the nearby, insanely popular, fried chicken restaurant whose name rhymes with: ""Cries and Sighs"" (involuntary reactions from prospective clients on being told the wait time), but after hearing that the wait would be one and a half hours, I resorted to Plan B... as I had seen gushing reviews for Beehive Oven nearby. We walked over, and the wait here was only ten minutes.""We're from Texas, and we're having fun with the concept"", said John to me when asked of the focus on being a ""Biscuit Café"". ""Biscuits are the vehicle, but we are introducing a number of variations that we think people will find interesting"". The Jezebel sauce was one such novelty for me. More like a Chutney than a sauce, the apple and pineapple preserves are given a slight kick by the horseradish sauce, but it's not pungent and helps one enjoy the chicken wings by not overpowering them.We got the Moselle (Fried Chicken, Collard Greens, Fried Egg, and Hot Sauce) and the Nettie (Fried Chicken, Iceberg wedge, buttermilk dressing, w/o bacon) sandwiches that both come with a side of Apple Raisin slaw. It would be fair to say that the sandwiches taste very good, but it's all about the biscuits... they are fantastic (5 stars). I don't think I've enjoyed any version of biscuits in NYC more than the one at Beehive Oven. Interestingly, there have been two (unintentionally) slightly different versions: one fluffier, while the other crispier but with an excellent bite... both tasted so good that you could eat them plain without the chicken and be ooh-ing and aah-ing...  As so happens ever too frequently in my food discoveries, I start focusing on a particular dish (lately Fried Chicken) and end up getting fascinated by something different... In this case: Biscuits... They are endlessly fascinating, for almost no two are alike! Some are cake-y, some are crumbly, some are fluffy, some crispy, some are like focaccia bread... it goes on and on, and one can't say that one version trumps others. But, Beehive exhibits a certain command and consistency in execution that deserves kudos and recognition. It's great to see a Smorgasburg alum graduate into the world of bricks and mortar, with distinction.There are a host of dessert options and we tried the Red Velvet cake (with Vanilla bean frosting) and the Texas Sheet Cake (with chocolate) that seemed less like a sheet cake and more like a fudgy brownie. The Sheet cake was marred by the sponge being uninteresting once one was done with the frosting... but the red velvet cake fared better in terms of frosting and cake, benefiting from the high turnover.""Are you hoping to benefit from the spillover crowd at the nearby restaurant when they hear the wait time there?"" I asked John. ""Not really"", he replied. ""If we even got half of the number of customers they do, we wouldn't be able to handle it"". I agree with that assertion. The fact that they are getting regular patrons is helpful, but Beehive is definitely benefiting from not having a mass of customers beating down the door. Our server, delightfully  personable and with an endearing smile, was nevertheless hassled and had to be reminded for (1) small plates; (2) knives; (3) water (our glasses were empty); (4) bacon in the Nettie (when I had asked for it to be excluded); (5) the bill... Did I say she was cute and had an endearing smile? I'll give her the benefit of the doubt, and hope she lives up to my faith in coming visits.Coming back to the million dollar question of a comparison with the nearby restaurant: there were no pies (only cakes and puddings), but the thighs here were definitely better than the ones I could see over there...

"Stumbled onto this place on a Sunday early afternoon, right after peak brunch time. Waited for about 2 min for a seat at the counter.This place is pleasantly busy but not frenetic. i hate those kind of brunch spots.

"Admittedly, when I first heard about this place, I was surprised to see (as of this review) a sold 5 stars out of 27 reviews. Come on now. That seems almost unreal! Well, seeing is believing! Or, I suppose, eating is believing. I am a believer and am happy to put in another 5 star review for this fine establishment! It's located on a quiet corner in Williamsburg in a cozy space, and the beau and I lucked out by getting one of the last tables before a 12:30 p.m. brunch rush suddenly took over. A scant five minute wait for us, but a 30+ minute wait for everyone else. (Hehe! Luck was on our side!) Though, I don't blame the rush or the people wanting (and willingly waiting) to eat a meal here. What they have to offer is extraordinary. To start, a bright pink glass of perfectly sweetened prickly pear lemonade wet my whistle. Though I easily settled on one of the special biscuit sandwiches, the Nettie, the beau opted to make his own. Starting at $3 for the biscuit, you can add whatever you want from well more than a dozen items. He went simple with scrambled eggs and cheddar cheese, and I had to jab him a little for not being a little more inventive. ;-) (He's my better half. Of course I need to tease him!) The Nettie, on the other hand, is a piece of heaven: Hot biscuits sandwiched iceberg lettuce, thick bacon, a piece of fried chicken, and house-made buttermilk ranch dressing. I was told that I didn't breath at all; I just ate as the beau watched in both slight horror and utter amusement. IT. WAS. SO. GOOD. After inhaling, errrr, eating my sandwich, we were greeted by Treva, one of the owners and the executive chef of this restaurant. We both had a lovely chat with her. Her kindness and warmth made me feel bubbly and exuberant while talking to her. You can tell that this restaurant is her baby and she is an extremely proud mother. Upon looking at their website when I got home, I saw she was trained at ICE and is an established chef, food consultant, and food stylist (YES!). When she asked if we would be back, we both told her yes, and we meant it. The vibes, food, and hospitality of this restaurant are amazing, simply put.",5.0

Refreshing and not overly sweet. Now on to the main course.

"I was really looking forward to coming and enjoying this new hot spot in South Williamsburg not only because of all the great reviews, but I used to live in the South and love love LOVE great biscuits.Unfortunately, my experience was sub-par. I came on NYE in the afternoon with a long time industry friend. We wanted to catch up and have some great food ( I had previously looked at the menu prior to coming.)When we got to the table, it took about 10 minutes for the waitress to come to the table. I was getting hungry, but was okay because the ambiance seemed nice and my friend was catching up with me. The waitress came to the table and brought a water bottle, but did not bring glasses. WE asked for coffee and ordered some appetizers immediately. She seemed perplexed and not happy to be in the cafe.The place was about half-full at this time, and the owner seemed to be there, but was only mildly helping. We had some veggies brought to the table as a welcome which was nice, but the veggies were all wilted and looked like they were rotting. We thought the color meant that they were pickled, but they definitely were not. The dip was very nice though. We had to ask for water glasses.The deviled eggs were awesome and different- which was nice. The fried green tomatoes were just blah, and the waitress gave us a suggestion to get a couple biscuits to share.I would not recommend sharing because when they came to the table the biscuits are really made for individuals and hard to cut. I ate the biscuits quickly because I was hungry, but they were not very good. I couldn't taste the ingredients in the biscuits. They also put like a grocery store mesculin mix on the biscuit which made it wilt and soggy. I hate when chefs put that on warm sandwiches- who thinks that tastes good?! Also, the food is prefaced that it is made by Texans, which is very different from Georgia, where I lived. The flavors are more savory and less sweet, salty, and spicy. I even did not like the honey mustard, and I love ALL mustard. The coleslaw that accompanied the meal was truly gross and tasteless. Very disappointing.When we were eating, the waitress had a couple come in, and she seemed mildly busy, but she was very intense with them saying something like, ""I'm busy right now. I'll be there in a second, okay?!"" She even made a party of three create their own table because the owner and waitress lacked communication to help set a table up for them. I'm not trying to get on the waitress, but it made the experience uncomfortable.Also, I despise having to pay with an iPad at the table. I have to give my tip there, and hand it right back to the waitress, and although I never give under 20% for service, I couldn't justify giving more than 17% today. Why do people in this industry think this is a good thing?

"I'm so glad the other southern BBQ place was closed because it gave us a chance to hop over to Beehive. Southern food can go so wrong, especially with anything fried.

"I was really looking forward to coming and enjoying this new hot spot in South Williamsburg not only because of all the great reviews, but I used to live in the South and love love LOVE great biscuits.Unfortunately, my experience was sub-par. I came on NYE in the afternoon with a long time industry friend. We wanted to catch up and have some great food ( I had previously looked at the menu prior to coming.)When we got to the table, it took about 10 minutes for the waitress to come to the table. I was getting hungry, but was okay because the ambiance seemed nice and my friend was catching up with me. The waitress came to the table and brought a water bottle, but did not bring glasses. WE asked for coffee and ordered some appetizers immediately. She seemed perplexed and not happy to be in the cafe.The place was about half-full at this time, and the owner seemed to be there, but was only mildly helping. We had some veggies brought to the table as a welcome which was nice, but the veggies were all wilted and looked like they were rotting. We thought the color meant that they were pickled, but they definitely were not. The dip was very nice though. We had to ask for water glasses.The deviled eggs were awesome and different- which was nice. The fried green tomatoes were just blah, and the waitress gave us a suggestion to get a couple biscuits to share.I would not recommend sharing because when they came to the table the biscuits are really made for individuals and hard to cut. I ate the biscuits quickly because I was hungry, but they were not very good. I couldn't taste the ingredients in the biscuits. They also put like a grocery store mesculin mix on the biscuit which made it wilt and soggy. I hate when chefs put that on warm sandwiches- who thinks that tastes good?! Also, the food is prefaced that it is made by Texans, which is very different from Georgia, where I lived. The flavors are more savory and less sweet, salty, and spicy. I even did not like the honey mustard, and I love ALL mustard. The coleslaw that accompanied the meal was truly gross and tasteless. Very disappointing.When we were eating, the waitress had a couple come in, and she seemed mildly busy, but she was very intense with them saying something like, ""I'm busy right now. I'll be there in a second, okay?!"" She even made a party of three create their own table because the owner and waitress lacked communication to help set a table up for them. I'm not trying to get on the waitress, but it made the experience uncomfortable.Also, I despise having to pay with an iPad at the table. I have to give my tip there, and hand it right back to the waitress, and although I never give under 20% for service, I couldn't justify giving more than 17% today. Why do people in this industry think this is a good thing?

I had the chicken fried steak with the mashed potatoes and mushroom gravy. Very filling and comforting.

The server (I'm sorry I forgot his name) was very friendly, and one of the owners John (who did some of the paintings inside the restaurant) was there and it was nice to chit chat with them both, just as you would if you were eating in a place back home.

"Uber was offering free rides to and from Crown Heights/Bedstuy this weekend, so I thought ""why not use this free ride to try somewhere new"". A couple of options came about, but I settled on Beehive simply because of it's name (Beyonce anyone? LoL). I caught my UberPool ride, and headed to Williamsburg. Small joint (probably sits about 30 at maximum capacity), and while there was a wait when I arrived, I mosey'd towards the bar (since this was a solo dolo brunch) and had my breakfast/lunch there. There's a big Texas flag on the ceiling, and the decor is very ""down home in the country""! I showed up knowing I wanted the Shrimp and Grits, but was a little taken aback by the $3 price difference (shows as $15 on the website, but was $18 in the restaurant). It's $3, and yes that could buy me a biscuit, but I went along with it anyhow.I ordered my shrimp and grits with a side of apple raisin slaw, and the pear lemonade. The pear lemonade was laced with sugar, but was pretty good nonetheless. How many times have you had pear in a drink, and could taste the pear? :-) I was served vegetables (cucumbers, cherry tomotoes, carrots) and dip as I waited for my meal, but it wasn't even necessary because the food arrived within 10 minutes of ordering(maybe less), and I was done within another 10 (maybe less) minutes. It was probably the quickest brunch meal I'd ever had!  5 stars for quick service! The shrimp in grits was okay, and just that. I feel like it was missing something (honestly, I want to say cheese in the grits), but worth eating again if you're in the neighborhood. However, I won't trek it that way specifically for it (which I do for Sweet Chick's shrimp and grits). It also wasn't very filling. I like a BOWL full of grits, and I hate when it's served in a plate, so that it appears as if it's a lot, but it's not. Maybe that's why it took me less than 10 minutes to finish my meal. I'd suggest they put it in a bowl, and add more grits (though on the contrary, the amount of shrimp was perfect). Otherwise, you'll definitely need the side dish to walk away slightly satisfied. The apple raisin slaw is definitely skip-able. While eating it I kept thinking ""I don't like it, but I don't hate it"", which isn't a good sign. I left wishing I'd tried the biscuits as a side instead.I ordered 2 build your own biscuits for my husband to go. He thought it was okay, and that he'd like to go back to try them in the restaurant. You'll definitely need more than one (to fill you up) so that's a little worrisome, but we'll see next time. Overall experience was... Ok (hence the stars), and maybe it'll get better once I go back. I'd be interested in trying the build your own biscuits next time, and would recommend the place to friends.",3.0
"My husband and I were looking to have breakfast and decided to drive to Brooklyn. On the way I found this place on yelp and after awesome ratings and comments we decided to check it out. After being a few minutes away we noticed they didn't open until 10a so we parked in front and waited 30 minutes for them to open. It was well worth the wait. The decor inside is beautiful, clean very much feels like Texas. The waitress was welcoming and very friendly. One of the owners Jon also greeted us at the end of meal and was very friendly. We started with their complimentary buttermilk ranch dressing and veggies and added deviled eggs. I ordered an egg & grits breakfast and my husband ordered a special eggs Benedict style breakfast with their home-made queso hollandaise sauce. To top it off we added their pumpkin biscuit with maple butter.

"Uber was offering free rides to and from Crown Heights/Bedstuy this weekend, so I thought ""why not use this free ride to try somewhere new"". A couple of options came about, but I settled on Beehive simply because of it's name (Beyonce anyone? LoL). I caught my UberPool ride, and headed to Williamsburg. Small joint (probably sits about 30 at maximum capacity), and while there was a wait when I arrived, I mosey'd towards the bar (since this was a solo dolo brunch) and had my breakfast/lunch there. There's a big Texas flag on the ceiling, and the decor is very ""down home in the country""! I showed up knowing I wanted the Shrimp and Grits, but was a little taken aback by the $3 price difference (shows as $15 on the website, but was $18 in the restaurant). It's $3, and yes that could buy me a biscuit, but I went along with it anyhow.I ordered my shrimp and grits with a side of apple raisin slaw, and the pear lemonade. The pear lemonade was laced with sugar, but was pretty good nonetheless. How many times have you had pear in a drink, and could taste the pear? :-) I was served vegetables (cucumbers, cherry tomotoes, carrots) and dip as I waited for my meal, but it wasn't even necessary because the food arrived within 10 minutes of ordering(maybe less), and I was done within another 10 (maybe less) minutes. It was probably the quickest brunch meal I'd ever had!  5 stars for quick service! The shrimp in grits was okay, and just that. I feel like it was missing something (honestly, I want to say cheese in the grits), but worth eating again if you're in the neighborhood. However, I won't trek it that way specifically for it (which I do for Sweet Chick's shrimp and grits). It also wasn't very filling. I like a BOWL full of grits, and I hate when it's served in a plate, so that it appears as if it's a lot, but it's not. Maybe that's why it took me less than 10 minutes to finish my meal. I'd suggest they put it in a bowl, and add more grits (though on the contrary, the amount of shrimp was perfect). Otherwise, you'll definitely need the side dish to walk away slightly satisfied. The apple raisin slaw is definitely skip-able. While eating it I kept thinking ""I don't like it, but I don't hate it"", which isn't a good sign. I left wishing I'd tried the biscuits as a side instead.I ordered 2 build your own biscuits for my husband to go. He thought it was okay, and that he'd like to go back to try them in the restaurant. You'll definitely need more than one (to fill you up) so that's a little worrisome, but we'll see next time. Overall experience was... Ok (hence the stars), and maybe it'll get better once I go back. I'd be interested in trying the build your own biscuits next time, and would recommend the place to friends.",3.0
"My husband and I were looking to have breakfast and decided to drive to Brooklyn. On the way I found this place on yelp and after awesome ratings and comments we decided to check it out. After being a few minutes away we noticed they didn't open until 10a so we parked in front and waited 30 minutes for them to open. It was well worth the wait. The decor inside is beautiful, clean very much feels like Texas. The waitress was welcoming and very friendly. One of the owners Jon also greeted us at the end of meal and was very friendly. We started with their complimentary buttermilk ranch dressing and veggies and added deviled eggs. I ordered an egg & grits breakfast and my husband ordered a special eggs Benedict style breakfast with their home-made queso hollandaise sauce. To top it off we added their pumpkin biscuit with maple butter. A must try while it's still available!The food was delicious, decor beautiful & clean, service friendly & attentive.  We can't wait to return with our kids!",5.0

"A near perfect experience. As a Southern expat, there's a lot of foods I miss living in NYC. (This city does NOT have queso - how is that?) Biscuits are hard to come by in the city, so when we saw this place was nearby a show we were going to later, we decided to check it out.I was impressed right away with the quirky Southern decor. It was charming without seeming cheesy - lots of colanders and wood. Our waiter was AWESOME. I think his name was Charlie? He was very attentive and friendly.The boy and I each got custom biscuit sandwiches with a side of mashed potatoes. He got fried chicken and honey, while I got bacon and pimento cheese. The biscuit was $7 and the mashed potatoes were $4. We split a piece of Chocolate Birthcake for about $6.Everything was really yummy. The pimento cheese was slathered on the way I like it, and the biscuit was the just the right amount of crumbly. The cake is rich, so definitely split it with someone else.My biggest complaint - and what keeps his place from getting 5 stars - is how teeny the biscuit sandwich was. Where I'm from (NC), our biscuit sandwiches are monstrous things that will fill you. This was smaller than the palm of my hand and could probably be eaten in two big bites. I felt a little cheated for $7. On the other hand, you get a nice portion of mashed potatoes for $4, so that helps.I'll definitely be back to the Beehive Biscuit Cafe, but not as much as if the biscuits were a few dollars cheaper or a little bit bigger.",4.0

It was delicious! i was afraid the sausage gravy with the chicken would compete with each other but it didn't - everything worked well together. The plate was heavy, but the portion was just about right so you can still walk out without feeling sick. Also, tried the prickly pear lemonade and it was refreshing.

"Excellent food, lovely decor and ambiance, but disappointed by the server's demeanor. From the moment we walked in she made us uncomfortable with her bad vibes and upset attitude. Otherwise, as all others have said, the biscuit sandwiches are unique in their execution and taste - you cannot get this food, so well crafted, anywhere else in NYC. I highly recommend the build your own biscuit sandwiches with bacon, pimento cheese, honey mustard, and scrambled egg. The prickly pear lemonade is also amazing. Will be returning soon!!",4.0
"Amazing. Stopped by tonight and John the owner took care of my group of 7. He was so helpful and welcoming. The atmosphere was great and the food was amazing. The entire group had different biscuit sandwiches, which we all loved, and couldn't stop talking about. I got the Nettie, the buttermilk dressing with the fried chicken was perfection. And for dessert everyone who comes here needs to have the hummingbird cake. You won't regret it.",5.0

"Beehive Oven is AMAZING.Went in for dinner last night and to schedule catering for breakfast for the morning after my wedding. Treva and everyone were so incredibly helpful in letting me taste different things to figure out what I wanted, quantity etc. Everyone was just so warm and extremely helpful!

"I love YELP for helping discover little gems like this place! My bf and I were in the area for the weekend.

John was friendly, asking us about ourselves and what brought us to the area, telling us about himself, and making sure we enjoyed our meal. We shared the fried green tomatoes served with remoulade sauce. It was delicious! I ordered the shrimp and grits--perfection.  Trust me...there aren't a lot of spots that get this dish right up here.  In fact, even though it's one of my favorite dishes when I'm down south, I've pretty much given up on ordering it when I'm anywhere else. But something about John's friendly banter made me feel like he wouldn't let me down.  It was awesome!As an added bonus, he gave us two delicious mimosas on the house because it was my bf's birthday weekend!We will most definitely be back during our next trip to NYC!",5.0
"This restaurant is a really great surprise for New York! Its totally southern from the food, drinks, music and atmosphere of it. They have really interesting choices to get and definitely recommend the make your own biscuit option. I definitely am a fan of this restaurant yet the only thing they need to remember is that just because they are a southern style restaurant, they are still in NYC and we expect SERVICE and FAST! That being said the service was TERRIBLE! the poor guy just was not meant to be in the restaurant business ever. He was nice but just could not get it right. He forgot our drinks, he didn't read us any of the specials and he messed up our check order which we had to ask for 3 times.

"Maybe I just ordered the wrong things?? I don't know, but one thing is for sure - the experience overall left me feeling like this place is not only overhyped, but overpriced to boot. I got the Chicken Pot Pie (with a side of the Corn Spoonbread) and my friend ordered The Nettie. At $15 I expected much more of the Chicken Pot Pie - the biscuit topping was tasty, but it was only on top - no bottom crust (chicken pot ""pies"" with just a covering of puff pastry or dough are a real pet peeve of mine - to me it's a far cry from a true pie). It was also a pretty small portion for that kind of price tag. Then, the Chicken Pot Pie is one of those entrees that comes with a side dish and I asked if I could have the Corn Spoonbread as the side dish (it was being advertised on their chalkboard). The waiter said there might be an additional $2 charge to do that (which seemed illogical to me since he had stated that it was side-dish sized when I inquired about it, but whatever) but he wasn't sure, so I just told him to go ahead anyway because I was interested in trying it. I kind of half (emphasis on ""half"" - I'm aware that it's Williamsburg, after all) expected/hoped that that $2 charge wouldn't be added since it's not like the spoonbread was the size of an entree. The extra $2 is even something I would've been willing to forgive if the spoonbread was actually any good - sadly it wasn't: it ended up being dry and flavorless. But enough about my mediocre food items, and on to my friend's Nettie. It looked good, but even she commented that it was surprisingly and disappointingly paltry in size - it looked more like a mini ""slider"" biscuit than an actual full-sized one (which, if you ask me, is what it should've been at $9). In an attempt to salvage our overpriced dining experience, we ordered the Fruit Biscuit Bread Pudding. The fruit selection is seasonal, so ours came with apples and caramel. It was surprisingly good and made me feel a tiny bit better, but it's surely not something I'll find myself craving and returning for.",2.0

Along with several prickly pear mimosas (thanks yelp check-in for one free one wooot!) and Texan iced mint tea the entire brunch was really outstanding.

Well, it ended up that I had to change the reservation to Sunday because of some schedule changes, so Saturday morning I called BeeHive and explained my situation and was told I would get a call back in a few hours. I received a call within the hour from John. Let me just tell you, from that moment on, my fiance and I and our group were well taken care of!

"I read about this place while planning a NYC weekend getaway and I was looking forward to it, but was so disappointed. I should note that this place is more like 3.5 stars, but since it's not an option, I'll go with 4.Service/Atmosphere: We got there around 1030 and were promptly seated. The place is small so we were seated thisclose to two other tables. But whatever, it's a neat place so I got over it quickly. The service was okay.Food: Starting with drinks...my husband had regular coffee and he did not like it at all. I had the warm apple cider lemonade and I thought it was delicious. Our meals were good. The biscuits that came with our order were actually pretty good, but the rest of the meal was just okay.Overall: The place is not bad... it's just not as good as I expected it to be based on the reviews. The highlight of my visit was the warm apple cider lemonade. I would recommend this place if you're in the area, but it's certainly not one to go out of your way for.",4.0

He made certain suggestions, and had a southern bond with 2 of the ladies in our party. The fried pickled squash app was unexpectedly delicious, as was the chicken fried chicken over the soft, tasty, mashed potatoes. The fried okra was fresh & well seasoned. I had a beer that I don't remember the name of, but it was one of their signature drinks, not a beer on tap. It was a mix of something with beer, and it was outstanding.

She was great at recommending dishes for us and overall had such a pleasant disposition. The food was great and there are so many more things we plan to try the next time we go back. If you have a sweet tooth, the hummingbird cake and biscuit bread pudding are a MUST!John, Treva and their staff are a huge part of what make this place so great. You clearly see their passion and investment into cooking great food and creating a welcoming environment for all their patrons. Please check out this place if you want a filling-feel-good time!",5.0
"Wonderful service, wonderful food. Have already had it twice this week and can't promise I won't have it a third. I'm from Georgia, so I was a little worried about a New York business, but they definitely pulled through! Amazing. Love the sausage and gravy biscuits the most!",5.0
Delicious food and some of the best service I've experienced in New York. Haven't met a group of staff that is nicer or more inviting in the city. The owner is as warm as he can be. You will leave feeling filled with comfort food and like you have found a new neighborhood spot.,5.0

"This place is amazing! Everyone is super nice and the food is great.  I got the Nettie and it was the most glorious combination of fried chicken, bacon, and biscuit I've ever eaten.",5.0
I am not an expert on grits but when my Mississippi born highly fussy vegetarian business partner exalts over them they must be good.The food is homey and real the staff so good and the biscuit well delicious.Down home time for these Texas and South Carolina transplants.  Well deserved.,5.0
"I read about this place while planning a NYC weekend getaway and I was looking forward to it, but was so disappointed. I should note that this place is more like 3.5 stars, but since it's not an option, I'll go with 4.Service/Atmosphere: We got there around 1030 and were promptly seated. The place is small so we were seated thisclose to two other tables. But whatever, it's a neat place so I got over it quickly. The service was okay.Food: Starting with drinks...my husband had regular coffee and he did not like it at all. I had the warm apple cider lemonade and I thought it was delicious. Our meals were good. The biscuits that came with our order were actually pretty good, but the rest of the meal was just okay.Overall: The place is not bad... it's just not as good as I expected it to be based on the reviews. The highlight of my visit was the warm apple cider lemonade. I would recommend this place if you're in the area, but it's certainly not one to go out of your way for.",4.0
"Great food - I only had a biscuit with bacon and fried chicken, but it was massively delicious.  Can't wait to try the red velvet cake.Wonderful atmosphere - Beautiful decor, fun, airy, colorful, with lots of beautiful wood.  Tables are wooden with bright, colorful, happiness-inducing washes, but not loud or garishly colorful.  Very skillfully handled.  Great benches too.  I thoroughly enjoyed soaking up all the furnishings.  Soft, luminous light when we were there around noon, I felt like I was in a food or architecture magazine.  Very comfortably spaced seating too, not cramped together like a lot of places in the area.  Affable owners -  John and Treva chatted us up from the bar for a good while about Texas, wildfire photography, and chicken fried steak.  Super friendly people, as was our waitress.  Just the kind of people I would want in a neighborhood restaurant.Really glad they're in the neighborhood!  It's a total day-brightener!",5.0
"We came here for my birthday after the wait for pies n thighs was ridiculous, and I looked on yelp for a suitable neighborhood alternative. Are you f'n serious???? That was a 6 out of 5 star dinner & drinks session. They opened a 4 top table for us upon arrival, and the waiter was personable, providing information about everything we asked, and doing it all with a smile. He made certain suggestions, and had a southern bond with 2 of the ladies in our party. The fried pickled squash app was unexpectedly delicious, as was the chicken fried chicken over the soft, tasty, mashed potatoes. The fried okra was fresh & well seasoned. I had a beer that I don't remember the name of, but it was one of their signature drinks, not a beer on tap. It was a mix of something with beer, and it was outstanding. I loved our first visit, and look forward, with anxious expectation, to the next time",5.0

"i went there last week. because my friend told me that they have pretty good food. yes food was ok, but service was really bad. my waiter was really rood, he was treating me like he was doing a favor to do his job, also it was really slow my food took around 40 minutes to arrive, and when they bring the food it was already cold... i am not going back for sure",2.0

Brunch for 4 people was $110.  It felt very overpriced. Maybe their dinner menu is better. But I am sorry to say I won't be giving it a chance.",2.0

"Came here today with super high expectations for two reasons- 1. Five stars on Yelp 2. The claim to have the best biscuits in NYC.  Well, I left underwhelmed and disappointed.  The biscuits are terrible. Dry, hard, tasteless  and butter-less. I'm not sure how or why these biscuits are considered delicious. I also left hungry. The chicken biscuit sandwich was way too small. There's nothing worse than leaving a restaurant still hungry after you finished your meal.  My date shared the same sentiments. He ordered a chicken biscuit and the open faced turkey sandwich. On the upside, I did enjoy the fried okra and the chicken on my biscuit was well seasoned and juicy. Also, our waiter and the young lady at the front of the house were welcoming and attentive. Unfortunately, I don't have any plans to return and most definitely not for the biscuits.",2.0

"We went to BeeHive on a Friday afternoon. The service and overall hospitality was fantastic and extremely refreshing. And the food!! When you first sit down, they give you a little plate with a bunch of fresh veggies and delicious buttermilk dressing. After that, we were so excited to order. We had the fried green tomatoes, biscuits w/jam, and 2 grandma biscuit sandwiches. The fried green tomatoes were crisp, fresh, and perfectly seasoned. The biscuits were some of the best I've had, not to mention the homemade strawberry jam. As for the sandwiches, The Nettie and The Charlotte, they were both divine. The owner of the restaurant told us a number of stories that afternoon, one of which where he explained that every grandma biscuit is named after a grandmother in their family. Well, Grandma Nettie and Grandma Charlotte must've been amazing, because that's exactly what those sandwiches were! To finish off our meal, we ordered the Hummingbird Cake and Chocolate Birthday Cake. Both sweet, dense but not too dense, and the perfect ends to our meal. Overall, BeeHive exceeded our expectations. We will definitely be returning - next week!",5.0

"5 stars for their amazing service- incredible waitstaff!!!! 1 star for their food. This was such a disappointment. When you walk in and get your seat, you look up above you and you see that ole' lone star flag hanging. Your hopes are high, you salivate thinking of the delicious biscuits ahead........ Sadly, expectations are simply not met here at BeeHive. My wife ordered a biscuit with collards and an egg. I ordered a biscuit with fried chicken, bacon, and cheddar. Both sound delicious right? They really weren't. The biscuits are so small. I've probably baked 2,000-3,000 biscuits in my life (Native Arkansan, half Texan) I've never baked such dried out discs that Beehive calls biscuits. Both of our biscuits were bone dry, almost dissolving in our hands when we picked up our biscuits, such a let down. The fried chicken was fine, not bad, but not great either. Both of us were hungry after our biscuits. We opted for a dessert, hoping it might salvage our experience. No bones there either. We ordered a chocolate layer cake. The problem- in between the chocolate cake were layers of cream cheese. Very weird, very weird. Their service is amazing, amongst the best I've had in Brooklyn. But, their food is an utter letdown, don't let any flags, catchy names, or anything else fool you. We won't be back, because I can bake better biscuits any day in my own oven.",3.0

Treva was clearly very passionate about cooking and good at explaining each step. We started with the biscuits and they were surprisingly easy to make. Next was shortbread, followed by the scones. The class ended with glasses of wine and a cozy little dinner with my fellow classmates. They had taken some biscuit dough and used it for chicken pot pie which was amazing. I left with so much food and my coworkers were really impressed the next day. I will be making the coconut scones again, definitely my favorite. Highly recommended!!",5.0

"We were originally headed to Pies 'n' Thighs which is couple of blocks away from Beehive Oven Biscuit Cafe but the wait there was over an hour long. We had just driven back from Lake Placid, NY and were starving and no one was willing to wait an hour plus for food. So we decided to walk around the neighborhood and see if we can find something else. Sure enough, couple of blocks away Beehive caught our eye, we looked at the menu for few minutes and decided to give it a go. There was no wait so we were seated right away. Place isn't too big but has a nice decor. Our waiter was very nice, we chatted for few minutes about the food and he gave us some recommendations. They have a variety of options when it comes to biscuits dressings which is awesome because I love biscuits any which way I can eat them. We ordered couple of chicken steaks along with few other entres. It took about 15 minutes for the food to come out but we could tell it was freshly prepared per our order. Everyone went to town on the food, we ate from each others plates and tried everything we could get our hands on. Everything is great, biscuits with jam yum, fried chicket steak was fantastic, and everything else was just as good. So I still haven't been to Pies 'n' Thighs but no regrets, this place is awesome and I will be going back.",5.0
"Took a friend from Florida to Williamsburg to show her around. Not many places were open since it is Christmas Eve. Fairly priced, this place got amazing mini-biscuits and really delicious and rich chicken potpie. The fried chicken steak has very special breadijg that adds a nice crunch. The vanilla pear marmalade is very impressive. Service was great - no complaints. Will come back here with others for sure.",5.0

I left with so much food and my coworkers were really impressed the next day. I will be making the coconut scones again, definitely my favorite. Highly recommended!!",5.0
Great choice! you wont regret if you're into traditional food just be aware that you will also be surprised with a little twist of new flavors you wouldn't imagine they could be together so delicious. Jalapeño jello? yes it was delicious!,5.0
Best shrimp n grits I've had in NYC. Haele was very knowledgeable and helpful. The chocolate cake with cookie butter was amazing.,5.0
"Boyfriend and I had dinner here on a Saturday night and we will definitely be back. Ambiance warm and welcoming; you get that Southern hospitality feel right off the bat. Food did not disappoint either. The Jezebel wings were delicious and The Nettie was worth every calorie. If you're lucky enough to have Nicholas as your server, your experience at Beehive will only be enhanced. I can't wait to go back and try their brunch!",5.0

"What a wonderful restaurant!  Down to Earth, welcoming and just damn tasty.  Anything involving fried chicken and biscuits should be delicious but this place takes it to another level.  We shared the fried green tomatoes and three fried chicken and biscuit sandwiches: nettie, moselle and the 'michelle' which had pimento cheese on it.  The owners brought us some jezebelle sauce to try which had an apple horseradish base and was delicious.  Highly recommended!!!",5.0
"This place is so great! Went for brunch, had the chicken fried steak and eggs. So delicious. The biscuits are really good too. Can't wait to go back for the chicken fried steak dinner :) The best thing about all of it is there was no obnoxious two hour wait to sit down. We walked right in. The staff was very friendly. Go to this place!!! You will be so happy.",5.0
"We were originally headed to Pies 'n' Thighs which is couple of blocks away from Beehive Oven Biscuit Cafe but the wait there was over an hour long. We had just driven back from Lake Placid, NY and were starving and no one was willing to wait an hour plus for food. So we decided to walk around the neighborhood and see if we can find something else. Sure enough, couple of blocks away Beehive caught our eye, we looked at the menu for few minutes and decided to give it a go. There was no wait so we were seated right away. Place isn't too big but has a nice decor. Our waiter was very nice, we chatted for few minutes about the food and he gave us some recommendations. They have a variety of options when it comes to biscuits dressings which is awesome because I love biscuits any which way I can eat them. We ordered couple of chicken steaks along with few other entres. It took about 15 minutes for the food to come out but we could tell it was freshly prepared per our order. Everyone went to town on the food, we ate from each others plates and tried everything we could get our hands on. Everything is great, biscuits with jam yum, fried chicket steak was fantastic, and everything else was just as good. So I still haven't been to Pies 'n' Thighs but no regrets, this place is awesome and I will be going back.",5.0
"Took a friend from Florida to Williamsburg to show her around. Not many places were open since it is Christmas Eve. Fairly priced, this place got amazing mini-biscuits and really delicious and rich chicken potpie. The fried chicken steak has very special breadijg that adds a nice crunch. The vanilla pear marmalade is very impressive. Service was great - no complaints. Will come back here with others for sure.",5.0

"Everything about this place is so special.  I like that it is intimate and cozy.  The staff, as others have mentioned is so kind and friendly, and not just the owners.  Though, they are too!  In particular, though, the food is amazing: every bite delicious- fried green tomatoes, deviled eggs, chicken fried steaks, grits  & shrimp... Yum, yum, yum, yum.  And don't get me started on the biscuits....One other note- they were extremely kind and easy-going about kids.  Our 5- yr old twins are restaurant pros, but it still nice when restaurants go out of their way to talk to them.  In this case, let them look in the kitchen and told them about bees, gave them temporary tattoos, and generally made them feel welcome.  We will def plan another visit soon!",5.0

"So my wife, daughter and I went here for breakfast for a fourth time.  In terms of the cuisine, it continues to be first rate.  I had a Special Dish which included pulled pork, a spicy corn cake, and corn queso.  My wife still raves about the Fried Green Tomatoes.  Each time we go, my daughter orders the same MAKE YOUR OWN BISCUIT.  In short (too late) the consistency at Bee Hive Oven is unmatched. To add to the story, the people are just amazing.  John, the owner, is one of the kindest proprietors you will ever meet.  Hoping to try them at Smorgasburg in Brooklyn Heights on Sunday in a few weeks.",5.0
Great food! Loved broccoli cheddar soup! Very friendly and helpful stuff. Nice atmosphere. :-),5.0
"Having grown up in the South for my entire life, I naturally know a thing or two about Southern dining. Here at BeeHive, the atmosphere manages to narrowly miss the mark... Maybe it was The Beatles playing in the background while the waiter pronounced their signature ""Sandra"" biscuit in the way that only a born-and-bred Northerner would pronounce it. Maybe it was the distinctly Mississippi-like decor paired with a Texas state flag on the ceiling. But I digress... That's not to say the food wasn't absolutely fantastic. I had the country fried steak with mashed potatoes and fried okra, all prepared exactly the same way my mama makes them: The steak was crunchy on the outside, but tender on the inside. The mashed potatoes had plenty of garlic gravy, and the okra was fried in cornmeal. And if you're only going to choose one (authentic atmosphere vs. authentic food), then I definitely think that the owners of BeeHive have made the right choice.",4.0

"This place is Brooklyn's hidden gem! Let me preface this by informing you that I normally can't eat out due to having a lot of food allergies. But on special occasions I will let myself have a treat. So when I do cheat knowing that I will be miserable the next few days it better be worth it! And trust me Ive been to a ton of hyped places that were not worth it. After looking at a lot of places I decided to come here for my birthday.I brought a group of friends and even though it was a Saturday night without reservations we were able to be seated immediately. The food was amazing! I have found that it is hard to find good southern food in NY. But Beehive is the real deal. I had the fried okra, fried green tomatoes and the shrimp and grits. Plus a biscuit on the side. (Hey, I only get to do this once in awhile!)The biscuit was noms, the fried tomatoes were a little too spicy for me but my boyfriend loved them. The okra was good (maybe a lil overcooked, but still yummy and authentic). But the thing that blew my mind and made write this was their shrimp and grits. If you get this you will not regret it. The grits were creamy and velvety and the shrimp and sauce on top was extremely similar to Shrimp Creole, which is my favorite southern dish of all time. It reminded me so much of my grandmothers recipe. The shrimp were cooked to perfection and exploded with flavor. I was only a little annoyed that my friends kept trying to talk to me while I was trying to savor these bites.My friends had the build your own biscuits and all were in love. One got the chicken fried steak. This is a dish normally done quite different in the north than it is in the south, but theirs was the real deal.On top of all this the place was cute and the owner came out and was extremely attentive. They had had a little trouble with a chef not being able to show that day. Being a man down in the kitchen I can't imagine how much better it is on a regular day.I will definitely be back here for my next cheat day!!!! And I want to try that hummingbird cake next time!",5.0

"Breakfast here was amazing. John, the owner, came to talk to us and had great advice on what to do in Brooklyn. The food was good and they let you make adjustments as you please. Furthermore, the look and feel of the place are great! Would love to come back for a beer.",5.0
"Come for the fluffy biscuits, stay for the fried green tomatoes, and order the picnic platter for the group. A cozy, friendly place with a great atmosphere.",5.0
"As a New Yorker from Texas, I can honestly say this food is real and good! Evidence the chicken fried steak.  The owners are genuinely nice, the place is clean, design is pleasing and the food is worth a trip from Manhattan.  I'll be back to try the red velvet cake and the chilequiles for brunch ASAP!",5.0
"Really cute place with good service. Really delicious free vegetable platter with their ranch sauce. Ordered fried green tomatoes, as good as tomatoes can be. Got their jezebel wings which were really bad. The sauce tasted good, but the wings were really rubbery which means that its not as crispy as it can be and it was a bit undercooked as well. It was really hard to pull the wings apart and the meat was pink in certain areas. I fried over 10000 wings in my life being that my parents had a restaurant that specialized in wings so I think I have some credentials with wings. The waitress told me that they check the temperature which I believe but with wings the joint area always take longer and if the skin is rubbery, you must fry it for longer. A good wing is good enough to bite on the bones and suck the marrow out which would have been raw with these wings. Really great biscuits. Shrimp and grits were okay, basic tomato sauce and really small shrimps so its not worth the $15. These are frozen small shrimps that doesnt come with the tail so it's probably been pre peeled which are not good quality. At least they took the vein out, but as far as getting your moneys worth, it is not a dish you want to order. Besides the undercooked/under cripsy wings, and the poor shrimp quality, this is a good place.",3.0
"Warm, low-key atmosphere. Best southern food in the neighborhood. Came here with a group of 7 girls on a busy Friday night and the service was still top notch.",5.0
"I made a reservation because I am a Southerner who loves a good biscuit. However, I am shocked at how many good reviews there are. Service was friendly and the ambiance is nice, but the biscuits were bone dry. I felt like this was an upscale version of Chick Fil A.",2.0
This place is done right! Such goood foooood! Not the most options for veggie eaters but what they do have is out of this world! Give this little gem a try!,5.0
"This place is Brooklyn's hidden gem! Let me preface this by informing you that I normally can't eat out due to having a lot of food allergies. But on special occasions I will let myself have a treat. So when I do cheat knowing that I will be miserable the next few days it better be worth it! And trust me Ive been to a ton of hyped places that were not worth it. After looking at a lot of places I decided to come here for my birthday.I brought a group of friends and even though it was a Saturday night without reservations we were able to be seated immediately. The food was amazing! I have found that it is hard to find good southern food in NY. But Beehive is the real deal. I had the fried okra, fried green tomatoes and the shrimp and grits. Plus a biscuit on the side. (Hey, I only get to do this once in awhile!)The biscuit was noms, the fried tomatoes were a little too spicy for me but my boyfriend loved them. The okra was good (maybe a lil overcooked, but still yummy and authentic). But the thing that blew my mind and made write this was their shrimp and grits. If you get this you will not regret it. The grits were creamy and velvety and the shrimp and sauce on top was extremely similar to Shrimp Creole, which is my favorite southern dish of all time. It reminded me so much of my grandmothers recipe. The shrimp were cooked to perfection and exploded with flavor. I was only a little annoyed that my friends kept trying to talk to me while I was trying to savor these bites.My friends had the build your own biscuits and all were in love. One got the chicken fried steak. This is a dish normally done quite different in the north than it is in the south, but theirs was the real deal.On top of all this the place was cute and the owner came out and was extremely attentive. They had had a little trouble with a chef not being able to show that day. Being a man down in the kitchen I can't imagine how much better it is on a regular day.I will definitely be back here for my next cheat day!!!! And I want to try that hummingbird cake next time!",5.0

"Easily one of my favorite brunches this summer. This Texan family makes their own biscuits and jams in house and the result is delicious. I had their version of a croque madame on a bicuit with mushroom gravy, which was creamy but not too heavy. My meal was so satisfying. They serve great coffee and the staff and owners are extremely friendly and attentive. I'll probably go back for some fried chicken tomorrow!",5.0
"If you are looking for legit Southern home-cooking, you've hit the jackpot here. I'm sure this place will make Adam Platts NY ""Where to Eat"" list within the first year they will be open. You know it's real Southern food when you don't have to add suger to your tea or salt to your grits. We ordered about 7 dishes and I was tempted to lick my plate. This place is incredible.",5.0

"Beehive Oven is a lovely addition to the neighborhood. A charming and authentic experience with THE most delicious food. We had the Ruby, a gloriously divine culinary treat. The corn was a lovely sweet and savory side that should not be missed! The beer and wine selection should make this place everyone's local watering hole: beverages, biscuits and jezebel sauce, pure joy. Not to mention the lovely and genuine staff and owners. A truly personal dining experience. Go for breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks, stay for the at-home feeling and fantastic food.",5.0
I almost don't want to give them a good review so they don't have 1.5 hour wait times like some other places but they deserve success.  We wandered in here last week and could not be more thrilled with how delicious everything was.  The chicken was crispy and moist.  The biscuits are so fluffy and buttery.  The jezebel sauce - YUM!  And then there is the buttermilk dressing.  Oh make sure to get the Prickly Pear Lemonade!!  Our server was attentive and friendly without being overbearing or annoying.,5.0
"Whoah. This place is amazing. I walked to pies n thighs for dinner last night but it was packed, on my walk home I decided to try this place. I ordered a fried chicken and bacon biscuit sandwich plus the fried green tomatoes. Both were amazing. I think that was the best biscuit I have ever eaten, the fried green tomatoes were also probably the best I've ever had.  They also have good beer. I am going to be coming back often to sample the rest of the menu.",5.0
