"I moved into this neighborhood on June 1, and wasn't exactly sure where I would find my place as a ""regular.""  I found Le Paddock just a few weeks later.  It is not just a place I like because it is close to home; all of their food is great, and I feel so at home when I am there.First of all, they have a small bar that always seems to have at least one seat, and I am always made to feel welcome by either of the bartenders or owners.  I also sit outside often, because I often walk my dog in the area - where, in the summer months, someone comes out with water for Rosie, my dog, as well.Every week, on Tuesday, they have a ""muscle"" night.  In actuality, they have specials on Mondays through Thursdays, where they charge only $15.00 for a dinner, glass of wine and salad.  I particularly like the muscles, though, because it comes with either a cream sauce, red wince sauce, another sauce with chorizo - and even another sauce that I can't even remember.I have also had several different dinners.  When I want to be healthy, and order a salad, they give lots of veggies with either their ""Le Pddock"" salad (which is served with duck confit), and otherwise, which is served with some type of goat cheese, almonds, or some other ingredients that might combine both.  They have great dinners - including their crusted salmon, lamb dishes, chicken, and other.  They have great brunches - including, this morning, a quiche with salmon.  I have had Eggs Benedict, with lamb sausage - but also so many other great dishes.my law office held its Christmas party here - as one of the partners, I wanted to show off both Brooklyn and my neighborhood generally.  Many of my guests ate their oysters (which I have had often), as well as escargot, .pizza, and several other items which were particularly French.  They too were enamored both by the ambiance, and the way the food was prepared.I strongly recommend this place, and suggest that it will be referred to ffavorably for years to come by critics!",5.0
"Ended up here on a whim for New Year's Eve dinner after other plans fell through. We strolled in without a reservation at 6:30PM and were promptly seated at the bar, and it was a fantastic experience beginning to end. My boyfriend and I both ordered the Modern Cocktail, which was delicious; we split the crabcake as an app. His pork loin was tender and delicious, and my roast free-range chicken was to DIE for - the portions were quite large, and the accompanying vegetables (brussels sprouts for me and cauliflower for him) were cooked to perfection.Service at the bar was excellent and the bartender was attentive and on the ball, even on such a crazy night for food service. Props to him.We'll definitely be back, considering that we're right in the neighborhood.",4.0
"Tried to get a table for 4 outside but were informed they don't move tables. We all had breakfast on a pretty steady Sunday morning yet our drinks took 15 min and breakfast another 45 before we received it. Our waitress never came by once to see how our food was, which to say, only one egg out of three dishes had a poached egg while everything else was well done. The service and the food are nothing to rave about and considering our neighborhood is growing, its sad to see this restaurant getting sloppier the longer they're here.",2.0
My favorite neighborhood restaurant. The drinks are AWESOME.  Greggy never gets annoyed by my million and one questions.  He's the best,5.0
This place makes us happy.  The food is consistently good and fresh.  The drinks are yummy. But best of all it feels like a neighborhood place and the owners keep it that way.  We went early on a Friday and watched as the place filled up and when people came they tried to find room for them all in such a family way.  They are also very welcoming to kids as long as you don't let your kids be crazy.,5.0
I went there tonight with my boyfriend and it was our first time. The menu is small but you get there nearly everything from Burger to Pizza to Mussles..etc what else do you need?I recommend the crab cake mhmm it's soo delicious! A great place a great owner and also the staff is really friendly. I highly recommend this place!!,5.0
"This was my second time at Le Paddock, and I'm happy to say that this one redeemed all of the disappointment of the first. I was here for a birthday in October, and got a pizza margherita, and it was terrible. The thin pizza crust was soft as soaked pita bread and the cheese wasn't great; you know there's a problem when the best part of a pizza is the sauce.Fast forward to another friend's birthday party this past Saturday - a completely different experience. I usually use the pizza margherita as my standard to assess a place's pizza quality, but there are so many good reviews for their pizzas that I decided to ignore my reservations and try the Mediterranean pizza; some places do a much better job on pizzas with toppings than without. And happily, Le Paddock is one of them! This pizza was much better than that of my first visit; the roasted tomatoes and goat cheese were delicious and they didn't go too heavy on the caramelized onions. The crust was still softer than it should have been, and the olives were the canned, pitted kind, but it was still very tasty overall. Also, this time I got to try a few of the appetizers, and the standout was definitely the Flash-Fried Brussels Sprouts. The Smoked Eggplant puree was all right, though a bit bland, and the Salmorejo dip and the La Padduck were both popular with the rest of the party, though I didn't try it myself. On the wine, I got their house Cote du Rhone; I've never seen one as a house wine, so I figured it might not be a great one, but a Cote du Rhone is a Cote du Rhone, right? It actually tasted a lot more like a jammy Merlot. Though the food can be a little hit or miss (more hit than miss it seems), I really gave Le Paddock the fourth star for the service. The staff was extremely friendly, helpful and accommodating for both birthday parties, and both were on Saturday nights too, so I have to give them props for that. If you're having a party for 10-14 and are looking for a nice but casual restaurant with good food, reasonable prices and a candle-lit ambiance, this is a great option.",4.0
"Me and the wife drove around looking for a good place to have brunch, until we stumbled upon this nice and cozy place on Prospect Avenue. We went in and we were seated immediately and greeted by a welcoming staff. I ordered the Eggs Norwegian which come with poached eggs, but I am not a fan of poached eggs so I asked if they can substitute the poached eggs for some over easy eggs. This was no problem for them as they accommodated my request. Upon arrival of the food I was impressed with the presentation. The food was delicious and for the price it was a very big portion. I usually eat a lot and when I left I was very full. I would definatly be going back again and bringing some friends along for the amazing brunch experience.",5.0
"Delicious French food in a real rustic restaurant atmosphere - we had the mussels, deviled eggs, kale salad and cheese board.The restaurant is romantic and quiet during lunch.

"One of the best burgers in Brooklyn (and I have a very high standard). I like that they are served with generous portions of both fries and salad. My wife loves the lamb burger.  The cocktails are delicious and not watered down. I don't eat shellfish, but a lot of people there seem to love the oysters, which are a good price. Nice atmosphere as well. Some reviews said the waiters were rude, we've been there several times and never had a bad experience. They are French, so it adds to the charm.  The prices are a little high, but it's worth it for the quality of the experience. People going on and on about cash only. Ok, it's a pain, but so are a million other places , there is an ATM by the door that works fine. We'll be back on the regular.",5.0

"I couldn't wait to come here. I dont really eat French much so when i heard of this place i was super excited to come down to try it. I called and said they dont take reservations so I was hoping there wasnt a long wait. It was super packed when we arrived but Luckily we only waited about 10 minutes for a seat.  The place is some what small. Its a corner restaurant with a small bar to the back. Big beautiful rounded windows, wood floors, the ambience transports you to a different place. Its just amazing. We checked out the menu and decided on the tapas we ordered the grilled artichokes, hummus, and deviled eggs all were delicious. Artichoke perfectly prepared not chewy very tender. Hummus was tasty and the bread was nice and warm. Deviled eggs were great nice and creamy and delicious.!Except i think they should have had one more on each plate. For dinner i had the skirt steak and he had the scallops with risotto. The steak was delicious perfectly prepared the potatoes were unbelievable, creamy like a scalloped potato, string beans very tender. The scallops were cooked perfectly and risotto was seasoned and cooked great but the big complaint there was practically nothing on the dish. There was four small scallops and a small portion of risotto no bueno!! Not for the price your charging..  Very disappointing!! We ordered a banana tartin with whip cream which was the best dessert i have eaten in a while just delicious.   No overly sweet or mushy just perfect it was wrapped in Filo dough. This place is just amazing but It needs to give out bigger portions on certain plates for the price they are charging.",4.0

"Le Paddock was a casual recommendation from a friend. I was searching last minute for a relaxed environment where I could gather a group of 15, friends and their SO, to quietly ring in hitting the big 30. Most places require a contract, rental fee, and pre fixe menus. When I called Le Paddock they were very open and welcoming. I spoke with Sylvie on the phone several times but was still worried about how things would go day-of. My worries were unfounded. On a rainy night Le Paddock was a cozy place to gather, friends tell me my table was clear and reserved at least a half hour before I arrived. Although two separate tables were set up we decided to be ambitious and cram 15 of us into the 11 seater. I forgot to warn the restaurant that I would be bringing cake and it was refrigerated and then presented with no questions asked. A few hours prior to our 9pm dinner I called and ordered appetizers for the table, they came out as soon as about half of us arrived; La Padduck salad, grilled manchego, eggplant dip, and Brussel sprouts. Everything was delicious. A server was always available to take drinks orders from us and answer any questions. They were really very gracious. It was not a long wait at all for main dishes to be ordered and come out, furthermore everything came out well timed so we all ate together. I had the chicken, and just had the rest of the leftovers for a dinner for 2 (BIG). My SO had the lamb burger which he was very happy with. I noticed a few other orders included the mussels and a pizza (which they make in a wood fired oven). Everyone cleaned their plates. I was really happy with my time at Le Paddock, I'll be happy to return for a casual date night.",4.0
Came here today for brunch expecting a long wait but was pleasantly surprised to get seated right away! Portions are perfect and it was delicious! Had the Eggs Florentine this time since last time I had the steak and fries. Both times I've been satisfied and will definitely come back! Parking isn't so bad either as there are parking spots in the neighborhoods near this restaurant.,5.0
"it's ok, but it is not as great as people write. unless i'm missing something. The service is definitely something they should work on. We went 3 times, so people cannot say that we didnt try...once the server was just clueless, the second time we had the owner waiting on us, which was ok, although he kept saying he didnt like French people...???? the last time we went, since we wont be going back the waitress was nice and helpful. the food is so so. i mean, it's not bad, but it's meh. we had the steak, the pizza, the pasta, the gratin, cheese and charcuterie...basic, not great. there are many other places around where i;m sure we can feel more welcomed",3.0
"Wanted to like this place, but at the end of our meal, our group gets the big ""cash only"" nonsense. Only a couple ppl have cash ...and there's no ATM nearby. Now we're all trying to figure who is borrowing cash and who owes who what. Come on guys, it's 2015, get a Square account. Stop screwing customers so you can dodge your books.",2.0

"I actually found the food to be quite good and menu diverse. But echoing many sentiments in these reviews, the credit card issue is a deal-breaker. It's 2015, folks. And the dishonesty surrounding it: they don't post it anywhere, it's not on their menu, and as soon as you get your bill, they gleefully point to their ATM which they collect a large service charge on....is absurd and poor business. This isn't 1975 and they're not a low-priced diner! I was so excited to go back for dinner, but I will refrain until they start accepting cards and come into the 21st century. Good riddance.",2.0
"I couldn't wait to come here. I dont really eat French much so when i heard of this place i was super excited to come down to try it. I called and said they dont take reservations so I was hoping there wasnt a long wait. It was super packed when we arrived but Luckily we only waited about 10 minutes for a seat.  The place is some what small. Its a corner restaurant with a small bar to the back. Big beautiful rounded windows, wood floors, the ambience transports you to a different place. Its just amazing. We checked out the menu and decided on the tapas we ordered the grilled artichokes, hummus, and deviled eggs all were delicious. Artichoke perfectly prepared not chewy very tender. Hummus was tasty and the bread was nice and warm. Deviled eggs were great nice and creamy and delicious.!Except i think they should have had one more on each plate. For dinner i had the skirt steak and he had the scallops with risotto. The steak was delicious perfectly prepared the potatoes were unbelievable, creamy like a scalloped potato, string beans very tender. The scallops were cooked perfectly and risotto was seasoned and cooked great but the big complaint there was practically nothing on the dish. There was four small scallops and a small portion of risotto no bueno!! Not for the price your charging..  Very disappointing!! We ordered a banana tartin with whip cream which was the best dessert i have eaten in a while just delicious.   No overly sweet or mushy just perfect it was wrapped in Filo dough. This place is just amazing but It needs to give out bigger portions on certain plates for the price they are charging.",4.0

"Le Paddock was a casual recommendation from a friend. I was searching last minute for a relaxed environment where I could gather a group of 15, friends and their SO, to quietly ring in hitting the big 30. Most places require a contract, rental fee, and pre fixe menus. When I called Le Paddock they were very open and welcoming. I spoke with Sylvie on the phone several times but was still worried about how things would go day-of. My worries were unfounded. On a rainy night Le Paddock was a cozy place to gather, friends tell me my table was clear and reserved at least a half hour before I arrived. Although two separate tables were set up we decided to be ambitious and cram 15 of us into the 11 seater. I forgot to warn the restaurant that I would be bringing cake and it was refrigerated and then presented with no questions asked.

"Stopped in here after a beautiful afternoon walk in the park and was glad we found this neighborhood favorite. Ordered the Shishito peppers, Escargot, Fries with Parmesan to start. Dishes were perfectly sized and all were very good. Shishito peppers had a kind of red, but not hot sauce on them. They don't need it, but were tasty nonetheless. I haven't had escargot in some time and this was one of the more well prepared dishes I've had. Not too oily or over garlicky, just right. Fries with Parmesan were perfect, delicious, crispy and tasty. Shared the Flammenkeuch bacon & leek pizza. Crust was great, crispy but soft, toppings were abundant and an excellent combination. Will definitely try again.",5.0
"Visited my daughter in Brooklyn last weekend and came here for a cozy dinner. It delivered a friendly, comfy bistro experience. The decor was warm and rustic (check out the antler chandelier in the center of the room). Since the weather had been cold (it snowed two days earlier) and my California bones were getting frozen, the potato leek soup was perfect for me--no cream or milk, but smooth and deliciously balanced flavors. Followed it with the Le Padduck salad, which was an adventurous combination of roasted duck, nuts, blue chees, fresh greens and I-can't-remember but again a good choice. My daughter's choice--mussels--came with pommes frites which were EXCELLET.As others have noted, the downside is that it is a cash only establishment, and has been said before, who carries cash anymore?But for friendly bistro dining--I'm looking forward to visiting again when I'm in New York.",4.0

"Everything about this Windsor Terrace joint is just right! Wonderful local atmosphere that's cozy and unpretentious. From the hyper-value lunch prix-fixe (12.50-15.00) to their delicious selection of charcuterie and cheeses; from the excellent lamb burger to super-tasty Boeuf Bourguignon, you can't go wrong with any of the food here. Let's hope they bring back their Ratatouille! If you're one for pizza's, then damn they're ALL delicious! Not your standard pizza joint - my faves are the Flammekueche, Le Windsor and Forrestiere, though they do make an extremely simply delicious Margherita! They also come up with ""special"" pizza's one should look out for. All their delicious cocktails (try their superb version of an Old Fashioned) and their absolutely well-thought out wine list that showcases wines from what looks like mostly small producers. Le Paddock has slowly and surely maintained their craft and is always seeking to make your meal relaxed and fulfilling. I've been coming here from my home on Long Island on and off for almost four years now and must say I'm not surprised at the positive progress day-in and day-out!

Every course was stellar (with no gluten reactions this time-yay!). I had fresh juicy oysters with a nice hot sauce and bright vinegar- delicious and fresh..followed by the perfectly seasoned Monkfish over butternut squash risotto. The Risotto was swimming in butter, and I was just fine with that. It had a nice little crunch in there too. The texture, flavor and presentation of the main course were all spot on. I finished with a ginger crème brulee which was glorious and not too sweet, with a gentle ginger flavor and subtle fresh coconut! The staff was charming as ever- hitting a rare balance of charm and authenticity that lacks in pretense you'd normally fear in places like this, the environment just as sexy as the first time I went in for the incredible Mussels/Wine and fry for $15.

To be fair, he was one of two waiters and the other one was new and really slow. After a significant amount of stare downs, the owner came up to us and took our order. We were not informed of the specials, just that they were out of scones. Drinks: the coffee was just OK, slightly burnt, the mimosas and orange juice were pretty good. Food: I ordered the Ranchero Pizza and the bf ordered baked eggs. My pizza was visually very appealing but super bland and dry. There were more mushrooms than chorizo and it lacked any kind of salt or sauce. I had to bathe it in hot sauce to make it enjoyable. The baked eggs were also bland, I kind of liked the sauce but the Feta was nowhere to be found. If you me promise cheese it better be there. Price: At about 14 bucks a person it wasn't very pricy, but I wouldn't mind paying a little more to get better food.  Despite having a solid menu, we won't be returning for more.",2.0
"My boyfriend brought me to this awesome restaurant and we had a great time  The service was outstanding.  Our waiter Gregory was great.  The manager also checked on us as well, which I like.  The crab cakes were AMAZING.  Seriously AMAZING.  We also had the mussels and the deviled eggs were a hit as well. Plenty of portions and a great vibe on a rad street. I look forward to returning.",5.0
"Time and time again they continue to impress us with their fresh ingredients, great flavors and friendly service. The escargot, deviled eggs and seafood pizza were real standouts on our last visit. They have great wines by the glass and by the bottle but they don't mind if you bring your own. There's a reason this place is always packed. Go and be happy!",5.0
"Everything about this Windsor Terrace joint is just right! Wonderful local atmosphere that's cozy and unpretentious. From the hyper-value lunch prix-fixe (12.50-15.00) to their delicious selection of charcuterie and cheeses; from the excellent lamb burger to super-tasty Boeuf Bourguignon, you can't go wrong with any of the food here. Let's hope they bring back their Ratatouille! If you're one for pizza's, then damn they're ALL delicious! Not your standard pizza joint - my faves are the Flammekueche, Le Windsor and Forrestiere, though they do make an extremely simply delicious Margherita! They also come up with ""special"" pizza's one should look out for. All their delicious cocktails (try their superb version of an Old Fashioned) and their absolutely well-thought out wine list that showcases wines from what looks like mostly small producers. Le Paddock has slowly and surely maintained their craft and is always seeking to make your meal relaxed and fulfilling. I've been coming here from my home on Long Island on and off for almost four years now and must say I'm not surprised at the positive progress day-in and day-out! Oh and the pizza's are better than ever!!! Hats off to Sylvie, Gregory and their superb staff for keeping this WT institution alive and well!",5.0
"The brunch menu is wide-ranging with many tempting choices. The prix fix choice of eggs, salad, potatoes  and bacon was well prepared and satisfying.  There was no wait on Sunday around 2:00 p.m.",4.0
"It's a nice place, don't take me wrong. It's just... they have that French attitude I really don't care about. Get over it! Food is good, specially the pizzas. Brunches are yummi! The lamb burger could be better. I think mixing good meat like lamb with cheese is not good idea. Lamb is amazing meat by itself. Ah! and they don't have the more commercial beers like... I don't know... Peroni, Stella, Corona, you get the idea.",4.0
"We ate outside, had a combination of appetizers and small plates - all were delicious, in particular the whole roasted garlic.The staff were nice and present, never overbearing, and came around at seemingly the right time for everything.Definitely a place we're planning on a return visit.",4.0
"The baked Oysters & Carrot soup was really good, loved the horse theme.friendly service, everyone working there seemed to be French which made it authentic, cash only menu. Only had to wait 10 min for a table on a Friday night!",4.0
"A second go around and I must honor this spot with an extra Star. Went here for the New Years Eve Prix Fixe Dinner and tried a variety of their offerings. Every course was stellar (with no gluten reactions this time-yay!). I had fresh juicy oysters with a nice hot sauce and bright vinegar- delicious and fresh..followed by the perfectly seasoned Monkfish over butternut squash risotto. The Risotto was swimming in butter, and I was just fine with that. It had a nice little crunch in there too. The texture, flavor and presentation of the main course were all spot on. I finished with a ginger crème brulee which was glorious and not too sweet, with a gentle ginger flavor and subtle fresh coconut! The staff was charming as ever- hitting a rare balance of charm and authenticity that lacks in pretense you'd normally fear in places like this, the environment just as sexy as the first time I went in for the incredible Mussels/Wine and fry for $15. Stepping into Le Paddock you feel transported. This is officially one of my favorite restaurants.",5.0
"My friend and I walked here on a Saturday night for dinner, and the place was almost empty. Got seated right away and ordered our food which didn't take a ton to come out.I got the cauliflower dish as an app, my friend got the salad trio; both were good although my friend said the salad wasn't too special. For entrees I got the mussles and she got the chicken dish which was huge and which she seemed to enjoy.Would come back if I'm in the area. Cash only though.... There's an ATM right there if you don't have any.",4.0

"Stopped in for brunch with friends on a brisk Saturday. This place is adorable. Toasty warm, great for families with small kids, solid menu for a neighborhood spot. I had the eggs florentine, which came with tossed greens and seasoned roasted potatoes. Cleaned my plate. My husband had the burger, medium rare, which was thick, juicy, cooked perfectly to order and appointed with pickles, bacon, cheese and some crisp fries. Orange juice was freshly squeezed. Bloody Mary was on point. Stuck around for dessert, and the chocolate mousse was fluffy and not too sweet; the slice of almond cake was immense -- definitely sharable -- and came slathered in apricot compote, a dusting of sugar, and a generous dollop of fresh cream. We were very happy with our meal and will definitely be back to this cozy neighborhood staple.",4.0

"Brunch places are always tricky once you have your solid staples but hubbs and i decided to venture out in the world and although i had this place bookmarked for dinner - their brunch did NOT disappoint at all. he had the Norwegian (eggs benedict with salmon), i had some eggs on the side of a kale salad, and we split an order of the french toast. amazing. all of it. the portions were perfect size, potatoes and salad on the side were cooked and seasoned well, the salad was perfectly massaged (a big deal for kale..) and seasoned with a bit of a spicy anchovy style dressing...and the shredded egg they add to the salad was also very genius in taste. coffee was fresh and tasty.if you can grab a seat outside on a nice day it's very enjoyable because the street isn't too busy - slow enough for you to enjoy your company, but busy enough to people watchwill be back for dinner for sure! especially for their $1 oyster happy hour on Thursdays!the only minor complaint would be the service (a bit slow, although fully attentive once they came over) - but i give slow brunch service a break because it's the weekend and well, it's brunch - everyone deserves a break. also - CASH only but they have an ATM inside.",4.0

"Went back months later to try dinner. Even worse than lunch! The dinner menu, judging by my plate and others at the table, is not healthy, well presented or tasty. Lots of bland, overcooked, fried food and white flour. The noise level was beyond jet-engine levels--staff regularly slamming down bussed dishes and silverware helped by the screaming children and large number of loud-talking inebriated people, which perhaps helps explain why this substandard place has so many good reviews.

"I remember Laura's, the Italian spot which had closed long ago that Le Paddock renovated into farmhousey Brooklyn heaven. Does every new restaurant have a wood fired oven these days?  There is much to love about Le Paddock starting with the menu.........it is extensive, and has alot of value........a winner!..For dinner..start off with house baked bread and butter.......I was looking at the dark spots on the bread and inquired if the hearth oven bakes the bread indeed it does.  Chewey with a liitle salt- it is phenomenal.Ate:Wood fired salmon with ratttatoule $16Potatoes Daphinois- $5The presentation of food here is plain and unremarkable, but the food speaks volumes.  The salmon comes skin side up.....so tender from the wood oven and the rattatouile is sooooo authentically flavored.  Potatoes are classic, thin sliced and cheesey.  My one mistake was an overdose of delicious bread so no room for dessert.",4.0
"Thanks, roomie, for letting me know about the opening of this adorable new restaurant.  You can tell the owners really took some real care in all aspects of the restaurant.  From the handcrafted lights made out of metal steamers to the carefully selected meats and cheeses in the charcuterie section (you have to try the Chicken Liver Mousse and the Pipe Dream Buche Ash!).The restaurant used to be an Italian restaurant and has a wood burning oven.  They take good advantage of this by offering a variety of pizzas.  In addition to the pizza, they make fresh baked bread that made me pity those people on low-carb diets -- crusty and a little salty on the outside and oh-so-fluffy and sweet on the inside.  This bread in addition to the Moules Frites (mouclade style -- owner's recipe with curry, cream, white wine...and do I detect some saffron?) is nomnomnom-enducing.Dessert was the Tarte Tatin which was also baked in the oven and had a lovely caramely smokey taste.  Eaten a la mode and even my already exploding insides couldn't complain.

You know how some places are not that chill and say, ""oh we can't seat you until your party has arrived..."" not this place. :) Also there is an entire horse theme going on with all of the decorations.

I almost always go for the skirt steak, it comes with this yummy herb butter on top, just great flavor and texture.  The staff is always, friendly, precise and welcoming.  I have a dietary restrictions and they are very accommodating. This place is great for a date, dinner with friends or the whole family.  The only thing to look out for is that they are cash only, but they keep an ATM in their vestibule if you forget.  Enjoy le paddock!",4.0
"Knew I'd be back to give this place at least one more shot. And I was. For dinner. Great food. I was thoroughly satisfied with our meal. Bread for the table is accompanied by a very clean tasting, natural butter... For appetizers, we ordered the roasted garlic, mussels, fries, and the arugula salad with yellow beats - all recommended. The table ordered both the skirt steak and the chicken... Both delicious! Creme brûlée for dessert... 4/5. I will be back for dinner. Without a doubt!",4.0
"Great food, service & ambience. Felt like rustic restaurants we've been to in France! You can even get a half carafe of wine like in France, & the manager (owner?) provided bien accueil. We hated the escargot in basil, & I got the duck salad--delicious!",5.0
I love Le Paddock. This is my favorite restaurant in New York. We eat there about twice a month and are never disappointed. The atmosphere is very comfortable and I love their pizzas!,5.0
"I've only ever had the fish salad, but it was really good. I also loved the watermelon drink-- whatever it was called. Prices are definitely steep, but for this neighborhood, it's one of the only decent restaurants around. Wish they had more veggie options but I guess that won't happen being a French restaurant. Very nice ambiance if you're sitting outside, but super loud inside. I personally can't even sit in there.",4.0
"This may be my new favorite neighborhood spot! My roommate and I went here the other night after debating going all the way to W-burg for French food and I am so glad I did. First off, it was mussels night. $15 mussels (your way), fries, and a generous glass of wine was fantastic! I got the asiatique and it was soooooooo good. Fries were delicious as well. We started off with the escargots and I've never enjoyed escargots so much as I did that night -- and I lived in in Paris! A very generous serving of escargots over potatoes; my mouth is already watering. The bread was also very fresh and crusty, just as French bread should be.The ambiance is definitely what got me. It really felt European to me; like France or Germany. It felt so good in there.. a vibe I haven't had since I was in Berlin or Normandy. The decor is super fun and the antler chandelier is to die for. Overall, one of the best dining experiences I've had in BK.",5.0

He repeatedly took my wine glass without bothering to ask me if I wanted any more wine (the first time I stopped him, but after that I let him have it). He would disappear for LONG stretches of time. He was ready to bring our check, forcing us to say ""um, is there a dessert menu? Can we SEE it?"". There was also large group in the middle of the restaurant making a TREMENDOUS amount of noise...at some points we could barely hear each other. When we mentioned that to him, he was like ""well, they are celebrating a birthday!""...really? me too! Did the stack of presents in front of me not give that away? (High point: when a women at the table starting drunkenly singing, REALLY loudly).The service was SO bad and the ambience completely destroyed by the drunken folk next to us, it made it hard to appreciate the food-- which was actually REALLY good. The owner could tell we were underwhelmed (when I had to go over to the kitchen to request our check, since our waiter was hanging out in there) and he tried to address it by sending over a few glasses of complimentary champagne, which was nice.

The wait staff has always been perfectly polite and attentive. It's usually empty and quiet on weekdays. They have wi-fi. It's open and spacious.Lastly, the food is excellent and simple.

The portion of fish was generous and cooked to perfection.  They always have good fries, so it was an excellent combination.  We've been here for quite a few dinners, and I've never been disappointed.Sunday brunch I had a breakfast pizza for the second time.  I shied away from the breakfast pizzas for the first few months, because I just couldn't embrace eggs on pizza.  A couple weeks ago I took the leap and had the Ranchera pizza (chorizo, mushroom, fromage blanc, jalapeno, tomatoes, cilantro).  I know!  It doesn't sound so great, does it?  But it's delicious!  It was great!  They use fresh jalapenos, not pickled, so they are not as hot but still provide some spicy heat.  This week I had the Flammenkuech pizza (leeks, ham, gruyere).  Very tasty, and a dish I would recommend and order again.  I did salt it and I wished it included grilled white onions, but neither of those things prevented me from eating and enjoying the entire pie.  The brunch special is a good deal:  coffee, drink or juice, and entree for $12.95.  They are licensed for beer and wine, so the Bloody Mary is made with saki. My wife always has it with brunch and says it's very good.  I always have the fresh-squeezed OJ and it never disappoints.  The coffee has improved!  It's rich and flavorful.  The staff are friendly and efficient.   The cash-only policy can be a drag; but, they have an ATM machine in the vestibule.  We've adjusted to it.  They are probably doing us a favor by making us use cash!The room is full, but not over-crowded.  There are a lot of windows which makes for a nice feel.They play music that runs the gamut, they've played The Four Tops and (I think) Georges Brassens.  I've never been irritated by the music, and they manage to adjust it as the room fills-up and empties out.  They know what they are doing with the music, which isn't always the case in Brooklyn restaurants.This morning, I opened the door, and stepped in to the opening strains of ""Five Years"" from the David Bowie ""Ziggy Stardust"" record.  It was a nice treat that made me smile.  THEN, ""Soul Love"" played and I realized it was the entire CD (with the bonus tracks).  I arrived for ""Five Years"" and left to ""Velvet Goldmine"" (and I was not the only person singing along with my meal!Go!  Enjoy!",5.0

"We tried Le Paddock tonight and were happy we did. The owner has made the restaurant warm and inviting. Likewise both he and our server were friendly and accommodating. We began with some delicious bread that the restaurant partially bakes on the premises. It really is exceptional.  Next I had a grass fed hamburger with crispy bacon and a double order of salad because I decided to pass on the fries and save the calories. Something I do not do often enough. My medium rare burger was cooked to perfection and the roll it came on was fresh and tasty. My girlfriend opted for the margarita pizza. The crust and the cheese were excellent but she did not like the consistency of the tomato sauce and I felt the sauce was a bit bland. Because portions are generous and it was a work night, we passed on the desserts but will be back to try the warm chocolate cake with a cup of decaf!So in short, this is a restaurant to which we will soon return to explore the rest of the menu!Do note that as of this writing you can leave home without it because it is cash only!",4.0
"Big fan of this place. The ambiance is delightful, the waitstaff attentive and the food was great. We had the brussel sprout appetizer, flash fried sprouts, and it was amazing.

In short, we thought the prices fairly reflected the quality and quantity which can certainly be a rarity in this fine city of ours.

"We tried Le Paddock tonight and were happy we did. The owner has made the restaurant warm and inviting. Likewise both he and our server were friendly and accommodating. We began with some delicious bread that the restaurant partially bakes on the premises. It really is exceptional.  Next I had a grass fed hamburger with crispy bacon and a double order of salad because I decided to pass on the fries and save the calories. Something I do not do often enough. My medium rare burger was cooked to perfection and the roll it came on was fresh and tasty. My girlfriend opted for the margarita pizza. The crust and the cheese were excellent but she did not like the consistency of the tomato sauce and I felt the sauce was a bit bland. Because portions are generous and it was a work night, we passed on the desserts but will be back to try the warm chocolate cake with a cup of decaf!So in short, this is a restaurant to which we will soon return to explore the rest of the menu!Do note that as of this writing you can leave home without it because it is cash only!",4.0

"My friends who live in the area have been trying to get me to Le Paddock since it opened. They raved about it after their first dining experience there and continued to rave after the second. I finally made it last night, high expectations in hand. It was around 8:45pm when we arrived and being a large(ish) group in a small(ish) restaurant left us hanging at the bar for about 20 minutes as we waited for a table for 5 (plus child). The understated decor, dimly lit dining room, delicious smells emerging from the wood oven, and constant background chatter of the patrons make for a warm relaxed environment. The owners nailed the art of creating a space that will make you think a second bottle of wine is the best idea ever.I was pleased to see that while they don't really have a draft selection at the bar, they do offer a very modest but varied bottle selection. On an unrelated note, I was unimpressed with the cleanliness levels. For a new establishment everything looked less than...fresh.After we were seated and told the specials of the evening by a personable and attentive waiter, we ordered two roasted garlic appetizers, a basque pizza, a forrestiere pizza, mussels in white wine sauce, and one duck breast special. The service was a bit slow but I generally don't see a problem with waiting for food for up to 30 minutes. The food was mostly worth waiting for. Their regular old bread/butter is AMAZING. I wonder if they bake that bread in the wood oven...* The roasted garlic with flatbread was divine; the garlic caramelized into gooey deliciousness, the bread was seasoned with salt & pepper, and the olive oil drizzled onto the plate was quality. * The mussels were overcooked. The outer layer was a tad rubbery and some of the smaller ones shrunk into little chewy disks. However, the garlicky white wine sauce they came in was excellent. I wanted to dip everything on the table into it! The french fries that came with the dish were pretty good as well.* The duck breast was well cooked although it would have greatly benefited from a crispier skin. The mashed potatoes were delicious and the ""asparagus"" turned out to be green beans which were unremarkable. The peppercorn aioli accompanying the dish was tasty. My biggest complaint here was the size of the duck breast. It was more of a duckling breast, really. $24 for a child sized portion? in Windsor Terrace? * I tried a bite of both pizzas. The forrestiere was all woodsy and perfectly oily and absolutely addictive. The basque however was just as unremarkable as the green beans.After we finished eating, we ordered another bottle of wine (see above!). At this point we were the only ones left in the restaurant and the owner came by with two desserts on the house and a bit of conversation. The desserts, creme brulee and caramel flan, were a nice gesture. The creme brulee was excellent but the caramel flan was killer! I'd come back just to have that with a cup of coffee.",4.0
"Although I haven't lived in the neighborhood long, (6 months), I do know we're lacking some quality classy-casual sit down eateries. Wanting to venture out for a nice meal without getting on the train, I stumbled across Le Paddock.What they lack in service they make up for 10-fold in the quality of the food. First visit, we had the steak entree and salmon with ratatouille. The wood-fired oven did amazing things to the salmon, and the steak was cooked to perfection. We had such a great meal, we returned again later the next week. Service was really terrible on our return visit, but our long wait was remedied by some drinks on the house care of the friendly and caring female owner (i think?). The food was out of this world, deviled eggs with horseradish appetizer, chicken croquettes with a lemony aioli, and two beef burgers with gruyere (yes, gruyere!) and crispy fries. Everything cooked to perfection.Prices are somewhat high, but reasonable for the quality and the ambiance. If you don't have drinks you can get away with a really reasonably priced, amazing meal. Ambiance is stellar also--warm wood and classy decor.Will be back (soon!) to try wood fired pizzas and desserts!",4.0
"My wife and I had dinner at Le Paddock  for the fourth time. This was the first time we went on a week night, though. Understandably, it was not packed on a Monday night. What was impressive is that they appreciate the business. Upon entering we were made to feel very welcome. The chef sent out an amuse bouche from the kitchen. We shared the escargot as an appetizer which is tasty and not killed with garlic. We then each had a Margherita Pizza, pictured below, which is baked in their wood-fired brick oven. As usual, we enjoyed very much. All the while, the hostess and staff were attentive, happy to serve and not overbearing. After the meal, we were treated to a glass of a French dessert wine they are introducing. I've been to restaurants on slow weeknights. Sometimes the wait staff or kitchen staff almost make you feel like your an imposition. At Le Paddock, we were made to feel like valued guests. This place is a gem that we need to make sure sticks around for quite a long time. A great addition to the neighborhood.",5.0

"I've been there twice so far, and will definitely return. The restaurant is a little dark, but the staff welcomed me as if into their own home. It's a small place, but has a very warm feel to it.My first visit, the place was packed, and being alone, I didn't mind sitting at the bar. I chose to start with the requisite French Onion Soup. It wasn't requisite, it was exquisite. For the first time, I had a French Onion soup that didn't require a gallon of water to overcome the salt. It was perfected seasoned and allowed the sweetness of the onions to shine through.Sitting at the bar, I had the perfect view of the brick oven, so I chose, for my second course, the Pissaladiere, which is a flat bread 'pizza' with onions and anchovies. The crust was perfect and the toppings played off each other wonderfully.To finish, I had the pumpkin ice cream, as it was the beginning of the holiday season. I don't know where the ice cream came from, but I sure need to find out. On my return, this time I CHOSE to sit at the bar, as the bartender, Denis, was quite friendly, and distracted me from the fact I was dining alone.On a recommendation, I started with the deviled eggs. At first bite, I thought, yeah, that's a deviled egg.  And?  But after I swallowed, the flavor lingered on my palate. I simply must find the mustard they use. The radish in it also adds a certain spiciness to the dish.For my main, I chose the lamb burger, rare. And it was served exactly as I requested. Again, perfect seasoning on a delicious, juicy burger. What really adds to the dish are the perfectly cooked fries. I usually try to avoid all the starches, but I couldn't help but finish these crispy wonders.For dessert, I let Denis surprise me and he came through. I had a chocolate mousse with salted caramel, which I was never the biggest fan of. They sure changed my mind. The mousse was light and fluffy and very sweet. The salted caramel tempered that perfectly. The only drawback to this dessert was that I could have say, eating them, all night.In conclusion, Le Paddock is the perfect dinner spot when you want delicious French food without having to get all dolled up and schlep into the city. It's good, rustic French food, not pretentious at all. I will return again and again. (Now I sound like the old commercials for 'Cats.')Up next is to try their brunch...",5.0
"Who says French is boring?                     ***""Don't you know I am French? We're rude and snobbish!"" says the Owner, Gregore.Quite the contrary. I had recently stopped by to Chris Scott's Brooklyn Commune for dinner (check out the review for Brooklyn Commune) and decided on walking up the block for a lone nightcap. Rather than any old bar, I stepped in to this little gem for a drink. I was glad I did. I sat at the bar (this is usually how I operate - faster service, courteous servers/ bartenders/ etc, talkative customers) and ordered a Sav. Blanc. I wanted a Sancere, but they didn't have it. It was a standard Sav. Blanc and just what I needed. There was a woman with a kind smile sitting next to me and two men at the end of the bar.Bread. That was how the conversation started between all of us. I overheard a conversation between the woman (a dancer) sitting next to me and the owner about how magnificent the bread was. The owner/ bartender was going on about the type of dough they used. Now, although I try to keep away from carbs, i know my breads. I had to ask. Gregore (Gregory) was explaining that they bought a particular type of dough and baked their bread fresh in house. I started talking about Pain D'Avignon and how they have some fantastic olive strewn baguettes. The conversation then veered from baguettes to pizza to smoked salmon to caviar to Sunnyside eateries (Salt and Fat). I stayed for hours chatting with everyone. Apparently the two men sitting at the end of the bar were also ""foodies"" and they knew all about Pizza. Gregore offered me a fourth glass of wine and that was when I knew that I just had to come back. The very next night, I walked in with an old chum for a semi social business meeting. We ordered drinks (Sav. Blanc for myself and a tasting for the lager draft that they had on tap) and the lager for him. For dinner, it was the La Windsor Pizza from their amazing brick oven - Prosciutto, fromage blanc, blue cheese, fig jam, arugula, and the Special of the Night, which was Duck Confit with an amazing side of lentils/brussel sprouts. The meal was decadent, savory and delicious. We chatted all night and the owner finally mentioned a food reference that I was not aware of (ironically, it was one of the most common French brands around - hint -pate) and I was stumped. They all teased me and I teased them back. As it turns out, Denis (Pronounced De-knee), an older gentleman on staff at Le Paddock, had the exact same palette as I did - Liver, Pate, Gamey Meats, Caviar, Carpaccio, Cow Tongue, Ostrich, Venison, Tripe, Fish Cheeks (I prefer the Fish Eyes), Red Meat (Bloody), Pig Snout, et al; whereas Gregore couldn't stand the intensity of the those types of foods and concurred with my friend, James, on pastas, pizzas and french fare. We ate. We drank. We laughed. We food bonded.Quite honestly, it wasn't just the food that I back came for - which is delicious (the fact that I enjoyed their pizza after working at Lombardi's - a decade ago - says a lot). It was the conversation, the ambiance, the intimacy and the warmth that this spot exuded, that made it worthwhile to come back for. I was really happy that I came here and so was my friend (who drove us here all the way from Waay Uptown). Overall, two great experiences. I will definitely come back for more. I suggest you do as well.",5.0
"I've lived in Windsor Terrace for over 7 years now and have watched what used to be a sad, sorry stretch of a street where a sketchy, run-down video store used to be next to the Fort Hamilton Pkwy F stop turn into a palatable, almost quaint affair consisting of a coffee shop that becomes an afterhours wine bar (Nanny Goat Hill), a wine & liquor store (Juicebox) and a locavore's haven (Brooklyn Commune).The most recent addition, Le Paddock, is at first glance so very promising: The decor is wisely understated but eclectic -- dimly lit and warm with wood furnishings and odd but charming decorative touches like the carousel horse on the ceiling in the corner. It strikes just the right balance between cosy home and friendly local neighborhood joint...I do disagree with the reviewer that stated Le Paddock is ""dingy"", by the way.However, my feelings shifted dramatically the moment I sat down. This was around 6 pm on a Friday night -- hardly busy. In fact there were two tables seated and the rest of the place was empty. Nonetheless I waited for a good 15 minutes before the server even presented me with a menu. Luckily I had time to kill so I wasn't too ruffled, but still...For starters, I ordered the spicy lamb meatballs in tagine sauce with mint yogurt and the soupe a l'oignon gratinee. The meatballs (there were 3) were the size of a half-dollar and as dry as cardboard. The onion soup, on the other hand, was one of the best French onion soups I've ever had -- the broth was savory and complex yet surprisingly not salty, the onions caramelized to perfection, the cheese bubbling and oozing over the sides of the bowl like molten gold.On to the entree course, I decided on the wood fire roasted salmon with pesto and ratatouille. And yes, the server did ask me how I wanted the salmon prepared -- which I left at the chef's discretion. And while the cut of salmon was generous, it arrived overdone (big no-no for salmon) and over salted, which was not helped by the fact that the pesto was quite salty. I actually couldn't finish the dish (despite the tastiness of the ratatouille, which I pretty much ""ate around"" everything else).After all that salt I needed something sweet and citrusy to cleanse my palate, so I ordered the lemon Pot de Creme, which comes topped with strawberries in a rather large flat bowl. Delicious, creamy and silky with just the right touch of tartness -- but way too big a bowl for a dessert course unless you're Adam Richman from Man Vs. Food.All told, I wasn't terribly impressed with the food itself. Perhaps I need to return and try their brunch menu or pizzas or burgers or moules frites, but for dinner my selections did not pan out. Except, that is, for the soupe a l'oignon gratinee. I definitely will come back for that again -- should I get a  hankering for French onion soup.",2.0
"First of all, the horse decor is so lovely. The staff is kind, fun and attentive. And the food- SO GOOD! I highly recommend the grassfed burger, the calamari and any of their pizza's. They also have a red wine called Pic San Loup that is truly one of the best I've ever tasted. Oh and they are very reasonably priced.",5.0
"I've been there twice now....both times for brunch and I've enjoyed myself. The first time was eggs benedict which were nothing phenomenal but this time around, I got the croque-madame and I loved it! The cheese covered the ham and I got a poached egg to top it off. For $9.95, it was just the right amount. My friend got the burger and he finished it off quick. Had to ask for ketchup on the side though. Service was good, I think they import their waiters from France too! I may be biased but they will be my go-to brunch place in my hood. :)Tip-bits:Cash onlyHigh-chairs are available for the little onesI think you can call to reserve, I heard the lady boss setting up the tables cause the group called in advance.",4.0
"It was a freezing cold, rainy December  night and we chose to try Le Paddock to warm up and have dinner at. It was an amazing choice; warm, welcoming and cozy atmosphere with great soul music and even better food! We ended up choosing the Arugula Salad, Capicola Pizza and Beef Burger. Can't go wrong with any of those choices, they nailed both the burger and the pizza spot on! Can't believe having lived in South Slope and only now been here.",5.0
"My friends who live in the area have been trying to get me to Le Paddock since it opened. They raved about it after their first dining experience there and continued to rave after the second. I finally made it last night, high expectations in hand. It was around 8:45pm when we arrived and being a large(ish) group in a small(ish) restaurant left us hanging at the bar for about 20 minutes as we waited for a table for 5 (plus child). The understated decor, dimly lit dining room, delicious smells emerging from the wood oven, and constant background chatter of the patrons make for a warm relaxed environment. The owners nailed the art of creating a space that will make you think a second bottle of wine is the best idea ever.I was pleased to see that while they don't really have a draft selection at the bar, they do offer a very modest but varied bottle selection. On an unrelated note, I was unimpressed with the cleanliness levels. For a new establishment everything looked less than...fresh.After we were seated and told the specials of the evening by a personable and attentive waiter, we ordered two roasted garlic appetizers, a basque pizza, a forrestiere pizza, mussels in white wine sauce, and one duck breast special. The service was a bit slow but I generally don't see a problem with waiting for food for up to 30 minutes. The food was mostly worth waiting for. Their regular old bread/butter is AMAZING. I wonder if they bake that bread in the wood oven...* The roasted garlic with flatbread was divine; the garlic caramelized into gooey deliciousness, the bread was seasoned with salt & pepper, and the olive oil drizzled onto the plate was quality. * The mussels were overcooked. The outer layer was a tad rubbery and some of the smaller ones shrunk into little chewy disks. However, the garlicky white wine sauce they came in was excellent. I wanted to dip everything on the table into it! The french fries that came with the dish were pretty good as well.* The duck breast was well cooked although it would have greatly benefited from a crispier skin. The mashed potatoes were delicious and the ""asparagus"" turned out to be green beans which were unremarkable. The peppercorn aioli accompanying the dish was tasty. My biggest complaint here was the size of the duck breast. It was more of a duckling breast, really. $24 for a child sized portion? in Windsor Terrace? * I tried a bite of both pizzas. The forrestiere was all woodsy and perfectly oily and absolutely addictive. The basque however was just as unremarkable as the green beans.After we finished eating, we ordered another bottle of wine (see above!). At this point we were the only ones left in the restaurant and the owner came by with two desserts on the house and a bit of conversation. The desserts, creme brulee and caramel flan, were a nice gesture. The creme brulee was excellent but the caramel flan was killer! I'd come back just to have that with a cup of coffee.",4.0
"Although I haven't lived in the neighborhood long, (6 months), I do know we're lacking some quality classy-casual sit down eateries. Wanting to venture out for a nice meal without getting on the train, I stumbled across Le Paddock.What they lack in service they make up for 10-fold in the quality of the food. First visit, we had the steak entree and salmon with ratatouille. The wood-fired oven did amazing things to the salmon, and the steak was cooked to perfection. We had such a great meal, we returned again later the next week. Service was really terrible on our return visit, but our long wait was remedied by some drinks on the house care of the friendly and caring female owner (i think?). The food was out of this world, deviled eggs with horseradish appetizer, chicken croquettes with a lemony aioli, and two beef burgers with gruyere (yes, gruyere!) and crispy fries. Everything cooked to perfection.Prices are somewhat high, but reasonable for the quality and the ambiance. If you don't have drinks you can get away with a really reasonably priced, amazing meal. Ambiance is stellar also--warm wood and classy decor.Will be back (soon!) to try wood fired pizzas and desserts!",4.0
"My wife and I had dinner at Le Paddock  for the fourth time. This was the first time we went on a week night, though. Understandably, it was not packed on a Monday night. What was impressive is that they appreciate the business. Upon entering we were made to feel very welcome. The chef sent out an amuse bouche from the kitchen. We shared the escargot as an appetizer which is tasty and not killed with garlic. We then each had a Margherita Pizza, pictured below, which is baked in their wood-fired brick oven. As usual, we enjoyed very much. All the while, the hostess and staff were attentive, happy to serve and not overbearing. After the meal, we were treated to a glass of a French dessert wine they are introducing. I've been to restaurants on slow weeknights. Sometimes the wait staff or kitchen staff almost make you feel like your an imposition. At Le Paddock, we were made to feel like valued guests. This place is a gem that we need to make sure sticks around for quite a long time. A great addition to the neighborhood.",5.0

"I've been there twice so far, and will definitely return. The restaurant is a little dark, but the staff welcomed me as if into their own home. It's a small place, but has a very warm feel to it.My first visit, the place was packed, and being alone, I didn't mind sitting at the bar. I chose to start with the requisite French Onion Soup. It wasn't requisite, it was exquisite. For the first time, I had a French Onion soup that didn't require a gallon of water to overcome the salt. It was perfected seasoned and allowed the sweetness of the onions to shine through.Sitting at the bar, I had the perfect view of the brick oven, so I chose, for my second course, the Pissaladiere, which is a flat bread 'pizza' with onions and anchovies. The crust was perfect and the toppings played off each other wonderfully.To finish, I had the pumpkin ice cream, as it was the beginning of the holiday season. I don't know where the ice cream came from, but I sure need to find out. On my return, this time I CHOSE to sit at the bar, as the bartender, Denis, was quite friendly, and distracted me from the fact I was dining alone.On a recommendation, I started with the deviled eggs. At first bite, I thought, yeah, that's a deviled egg.  And?  But after I swallowed, the flavor lingered on my palate. I simply must find the mustard they use. The radish in it also adds a certain spiciness to the dish.For my main, I chose the lamb burger, rare. And it was served exactly as I requested. Again, perfect seasoning on a delicious, juicy burger. What really adds to the dish are the perfectly cooked fries. I usually try to avoid all the starches, but I couldn't help but finish these crispy wonders.For dessert, I let Denis surprise me and he came through. I had a chocolate mousse with salted caramel, which I was never the biggest fan of. They sure changed my mind. The mousse was light and fluffy and very sweet. The salted caramel tempered that perfectly. The only drawback to this dessert was that I could have say, eating them, all night.In conclusion, Le Paddock is the perfect dinner spot when you want delicious French food without having to get all dolled up and schlep into the city. It's good, rustic French food, not pretentious at all. I will return again and again. (Now I sound like the old commercials for 'Cats.')Up next is to try their brunch...",5.0
"Who says French is boring?                     ***""Don't you know I am French? We're rude and snobbish!"" says the Owner, Gregore.Quite the contrary. I had recently stopped by to Chris Scott's Brooklyn Commune for dinner (check out the review for Brooklyn Commune) and decided on walking up the block for a lone nightcap. Rather than any old bar, I stepped in to this little gem for a drink. I was glad I did. I sat at the bar (this is usually how I operate - faster service, courteous servers/ bartenders/ etc, talkative customers) and ordered a Sav. Blanc. I wanted a Sancere, but they didn't have it. It was a standard Sav. Blanc and just what I needed. There was a woman with a kind smile sitting next to me and two men at the end of the bar.Bread. That was how the conversation started between all of us. I overheard a conversation between the woman (a dancer) sitting next to me and the owner about how magnificent the bread was. The owner/ bartender was going on about the type of dough they used. Now, although I try to keep away from carbs, i know my breads. I had to ask. Gregore (Gregory) was explaining that they bought a particular type of dough and baked their bread fresh in house. I started talking about Pain D'Avignon and how they have some fantastic olive strewn baguettes. The conversation then veered from baguettes to pizza to smoked salmon to caviar to Sunnyside eateries (Salt and Fat). I stayed for hours chatting with everyone. Apparently the two men sitting at the end of the bar were also ""foodies"" and they knew all about Pizza. Gregore offered me a fourth glass of wine and that was when I knew that I just had to come back. The very next night, I walked in with an old chum for a semi social business meeting. We ordered drinks (Sav. Blanc for myself and a tasting for the lager draft that they had on tap) and the lager for him. For dinner, it was the La Windsor Pizza from their amazing brick oven - Prosciutto, fromage blanc, blue cheese, fig jam, arugula, and the Special of the Night, which was Duck Confit with an amazing side of lentils/brussel sprouts. The meal was decadent, savory and delicious. We chatted all night and the owner finally mentioned a food reference that I was not aware of (ironically, it was one of the most common French brands around - hint -pate) and I was stumped. They all teased me and I teased them back. As it turns out, Denis (Pronounced De-knee), an older gentleman on staff at Le Paddock, had the exact same palette as I did - Liver, Pate, Gamey Meats, Caviar, Carpaccio, Cow Tongue, Ostrich, Venison, Tripe, Fish Cheeks (I prefer the Fish Eyes), Red Meat (Bloody), Pig Snout, et al; whereas Gregore couldn't stand the intensity of the those types of foods and concurred with my friend, James, on pastas, pizzas and french fare. We ate. We drank. We laughed. We food bonded.Quite honestly, it wasn't just the food that I back came for - which is delicious (the fact that I enjoyed their pizza after working at Lombardi's - a decade ago - says a lot). It was the conversation, the ambiance, the intimacy and the warmth that this spot exuded, that made it worthwhile to come back for. I was really happy that I came here and so was my friend (who drove us here all the way from Waay Uptown). Overall, two great experiences. I will definitely come back for more. I suggest you do as well.",5.0
"I've lived in Windsor Terrace for over 7 years now and have watched what used to be a sad, sorry stretch of a street where a sketchy, run-down video store used to be next to the Fort Hamilton Pkwy F stop turn into a palatable, almost quaint affair consisting of a coffee shop that becomes an afterhours wine bar (Nanny Goat Hill), a wine & liquor store (Juicebox) and a locavore's haven (Brooklyn Commune).The most recent addition, Le Paddock, is at first glance so very promising: The decor is wisely understated but eclectic -- dimly lit and warm with wood furnishings and odd but charming decorative touches like the carousel horse on the ceiling in the corner. It strikes just the right balance between cosy home and friendly local neighborhood joint...I do disagree with the reviewer that stated Le Paddock is ""dingy"", by the way.However, my feelings shifted dramatically the moment I sat down. This was around 6 pm on a Friday night -- hardly busy. In fact there were two tables seated and the rest of the place was empty. Nonetheless I waited for a good 15 minutes before the server even presented me with a menu. Luckily I had time to kill so I wasn't too ruffled, but still...For starters, I ordered the spicy lamb meatballs in tagine sauce with mint yogurt and the soupe a l'oignon gratinee. The meatballs (there were 3) were the size of a half-dollar and as dry as cardboard. The onion soup, on the other hand, was one of the best French onion soups I've ever had -- the broth was savory and complex yet surprisingly not salty, the onions caramelized to perfection, the cheese bubbling and oozing over the sides of the bowl like molten gold.On to the entree course, I decided on the wood fire roasted salmon with pesto and ratatouille. And yes, the server did ask me how I wanted the salmon prepared -- which I left at the chef's discretion. And while the cut of salmon was generous, it arrived overdone (big no-no for salmon) and over salted, which was not helped by the fact that the pesto was quite salty. I actually couldn't finish the dish (despite the tastiness of the ratatouille, which I pretty much ""ate around"" everything else).After all that salt I needed something sweet and citrusy to cleanse my palate, so I ordered the lemon Pot de Creme, which comes topped with strawberries in a rather large flat bowl.

"Firstly, I'm immensely excited to have this place in the neighborhood. SO needed and very much appreciated!I'm going to preface this review with saying that my friends and I arrived an hour before closing on a Saturday night. The decor: amazing. The music was great. The owners really did a wonderful job creating a great atmosphere that is miles different from the previous restaurant, which made the block pretty lame and boring. It's nice to actually see a busy establishment running!The waitstaff: Very polite. However, one of my friend's drinks was forgotten about, for which we were comped-- which was nice. Additionally, it took around 18-20 mins for us to get our entrees. I'm hoping this is just a new restaurant hiccup - or perhaps the fact we arrived late. I did at least appreciate the fact that I didn't feel rushed even though it was on the later-end.The food: Good. I got the salmon with ratatouille, which was very delicious! I will say, however, that as someone who doesn't eat red meat, there wasn't much else for me to pick. I kind of understand this, given it is French cuisine. It would just be nice to have another fish, chicken or veggie dish than what's already on the menu. I'm stoked they serve brunch (the 'hood is in dire need of a brunch spot), however, I have an egg allergy, which leaves me with not much to eat. Most brunch spots I've been to offer at least 1-2 non-egg items I can nosh on.Overall, it was a good experience and I would definitely go again to see how they hold up and if any changes are made. I would love to see more diversity in the menu options. I am totally rooting for this place to do well!! I hope to update this with another star or 2 soon!!",3.0

"My boyfriend and I live right around the corner from this place, so I think we are 'regulars' here.  Not only because the food is tasty, but because Windsor Terrace doesn't have a lot to offer in the way of food/restaurants.  The staff- super friendly and attentive.  We have never had an issue with the service here.  It has never been slow, no one has ever been rude. The food- the first few times, it is amazing.  Unfortunately, it is limited and after 3-4 times eating here, I found myself getting a little bored with the menu.  We always have dinner here, and they have amazing specials but between the two of us, my boyfriend and I have definitely run out of new menu items to order.  We just stopped in for brunch last weekend and I had amazing eggs benedict.  We came in with a few friends who all ordered different things and everyone was very pleased with their meal.  When the bill came we were all a little confused - Le Paddock offers a brunch special- when you order a meal + a drink, you get something like $2 off.  When we asked the server why we didn't all have the special price, he explained that you only get it when you order a drink AND a coffee.  We didn't understand... had we all had an additional beverage, it would have cost less??... just didn't make sense. Oh! And occasionally, we get a complimentary glass of dessert champagne at the end of our meal. Talk about a nice surprise!  The few times we have ordered dessert, it was amazing. Seriously, if you're bored- go here for a glass of wine and dessert, you won't be disappointed!The specials!- Every Tuesday night, Le Paddock offers a meal of Mussels (there are usually 2-3 options) and fries with a glass of chardonnay for $15.  I love mussels, so this is PERFECT for me!  Every Thursday night is dollar oyster night. You can't hate that ;).The atmosphere- I am a fan of the atmosphere.  Its not Burger King casual, but it definitely feels like a comfortable, friendly place.  Dimly lit, and usually no kids- my kind of place!  I understand that Windsor Terrace is a family-oriented neighborhood, but I don't think Le Paddock is suitable for young children.  This isn't only because I am not a fan of kids! I swear!  There isn't much space at all and I've never seen a small child sit still at a sit down restaurant.  Also, the menu doesn't appeal to any kid I've ever known.  They have the choice of a gourmet burger or fancy pizza.  I don't think many will opt for the escargot.  THE NEGATIVES- The oven makes the food phenomenal, sure.  However, I don't like leaving smelling like a campfire.  It isn't so bad during the warmer months when the door is left open. Two words I hate seeing together - CASH ONLY!  The ATM located at the door is helpful, sure.  But everyone hates the inconvenience, service charge that comes w/ an ATM.That being said, I would definitely suggest Le Paddock to anyone.",4.0

"We're very happy that a nice restaurant opened in the neighborhood.  I would give LePaddock 5 stars if their menu was more varied and a bit less expensive.  Otherwise, the food is good and we've never had a problem with the service.",4.0
"Just enjoyed a great evening at Le Paddock. While it was cold and rainy outside, it was warm and cozy inside. The entire experience was relaxed, unhurried, and friendly. The food was great: simple, well-made, unpretentious. The menu is not overly wide but has a lot of variety, and reasonably priced, even for the budget conscious. We will be back.",4.0
"Besides having the best roasted zucchini soup in my life, I just loved how the owner takes so much pride of her hard work, that you can feel it in the taste of the food and the restaurant's atmosphere.She will personally ask you how was the taste, what do you think of the dishes and make wine pairing suggestions.Amazing!",5.0
"Firstly, I'm immensely excited to have this place in the neighborhood. SO needed and very much appreciated!I'm going to preface this review with saying that my friends and I arrived an hour before closing on a Saturday night. The decor: amazing. The music was great. The owners really did a wonderful job creating a great atmosphere that is miles different from the previous restaurant, which made the block pretty lame and boring. It's nice to actually see a busy establishment running!The waitstaff: Very polite. However, one of my friend's drinks was forgotten about, for which we were comped-- which was nice. Additionally, it took around 18-20 mins for us to get our entrees. I'm hoping this is just a new restaurant hiccup - or perhaps the fact we arrived late. I did at least appreciate the fact that I didn't feel rushed even though it was on the later-end.The food: Good. I got the salmon with ratatouille, which was very delicious! I will say, however, that as someone who doesn't eat red meat, there wasn't much else for me to pick. I kind of understand this, given it is French cuisine. It would just be nice to have another fish, chicken or veggie dish than what's already on the menu. I'm stoked they serve brunch (the 'hood is in dire need of a brunch spot), however, I have an egg allergy, which leaves me with not much to eat. Most brunch spots I've been to offer at least 1-2 non-egg items I can nosh on.Overall, it was a good experience and I would definitely go again to see how they hold up and if any changes are made. I would love to see more diversity in the menu options. I am totally rooting for this place to do well!! I hope to update this with another star or 2 soon!!",3.0
"Bon  voyage/birthday dinner last night:: oysters (hell yes!), lamb meat balls, wine, pork loin, seared tuna, paella, deserts.  Will I be back?  Are you kidding?  Cannot believe my good luck to have this place walking  distance from home.  My only teeny  quarrel is that the pace between courses is a bit slow (maybe that is true only in NY).",4.0
"My boyfriend and I live right around the corner from this place, so I think we are 'regulars' here.  Not only because the food is tasty, but because Windsor Terrace doesn't have a lot to offer in the way of food/restaurants.  The staff- super friendly and attentive.  We have never had an issue with the service here.  It has never been slow, no one has ever been rude. The food- the first few times, it is amazing.  Unfortunately, it is limited and after 3-4 times eating here, I found myself getting a little bored with the menu.  We always have dinner here, and they have amazing specials but between the two of us, my boyfriend and I have definitely run out of new menu items to order.  We just stopped in for brunch last weekend and I had amazing eggs benedict.  We came in with a few friends who all ordered different things and everyone was very pleased with their meal.  When the bill came we were all a little confused - Le Paddock offers a brunch special- when you order a meal + a drink, you get something like $2 off.  When we asked the server why we didn't all have the special price, he explained that you only get it when you order a drink AND a coffee.  We didn't understand... had we all had an additional beverage, it would have cost less??... just didn't make sense. Oh! And occasionally, we get a complimentary glass of dessert champagne at the end of our meal. Talk about a nice surprise!  The few times we have ordered dessert, it was amazing. Seriously, if you're bored- go here for a glass of wine and dessert, you won't be disappointed!The specials!- Every Tuesday night, Le Paddock offers a meal of Mussels (there are usually 2-3 options) and fries with a glass of chardonnay for $15.  I love mussels, so this is PERFECT for me!  Every Thursday night is dollar oyster night. You can't hate that ;).The atmosphere- I am a fan of the atmosphere.  Its not Burger King casual, but it definitely feels like a comfortable, friendly place.  Dimly lit, and usually no kids- my kind of place!  I understand that Windsor Terrace is a family-oriented neighborhood, but I don't think Le Paddock is suitable for young children.  This isn't only because I am not a fan of kids! I swear!  There isn't much space at all and I've never seen a small child sit still at a sit down restaurant.  Also, the menu doesn't appeal to any kid I've ever known.  They have the choice of a gourmet burger or fancy pizza.  I don't think many will opt for the escargot.  THE NEGATIVES- The oven makes the food phenomenal, sure.  However, I don't like leaving smelling like a campfire.  It isn't so bad during the warmer months when the door is left open. Two words I hate seeing together - CASH ONLY!  The ATM located at the door is helpful, sure.  But everyone hates the inconvenience, service charge that comes w/ an ATM.That being said, I would definitely suggest Le Paddock to anyone.",4.0
"We stopped in for wine and a picnic plate.  Could not have been happier.  Great atmosphere, delicious food!",5.0
"I live close to this resto and decided to pop in for dinner with my sister. The atmosphere is very cozy and the food is pretty delicious. Prices are not outrageous but definitely on the high end for this area. The staff accepted my preference for goat cheese over blue cheese on the fig and prosciutto pizza (La Windsor), which I appreciated. The potato gratin that came with the steak my sister ordered was amazing.The place definitely had a neighborhood vibe going on at the bar, people chatting and hanging out. I will definitely go back to check out their specials.",4.0
"I can't think of one thing that was not great. Starting with toasted garlic pizza as a starter, to the abundant rucola and goat cheese salad to our entrees: coque ou vin (perfect!); the steak (delicious and cooked perfectly). Someone at the table also ordered the muscles and while I didn't get a chance to ask how he liked it, it was all finished by the end of the meal. Charming ambiance, especially with the aroma coming from the brick firewood oven. Great new addition to the neighborhood.",5.0
"I really really enjoy this place. The food has been consistently delicious. In my opinion, the pizza is some of the best that I have had.

"This was to be our third visit to Le Paddock this past Sunday evening (3/9).  We were looking forward to a nice meal since we did enjoy our previous experiences-food was fine but the rustic ambiance was the key factor for our enjoyment of the meal.  However, apparently this was not meant to be this time around.  Upon arriving, we entered the restaurant aroud 7:30 and we told there would be a ten to fifteen minute wait.  We graciously acccepted the information from the waiter (whom we belive to have a French accent and a beard) and told him we would wait outside.  There was a party of three also waiting to be seated.  As expected, after the fifiteen minute wait multiple patrons (7-8 by our count) proceeded to leave the establishment.  The party ahead of us were seated and when we went in to find out if we were to be accomodated we were told there would now be a ""thrity"" minute wait--what happened to the fifteen minutes-especially when there were multiple tables for two empty??  Other patrons looked at the (same) waiter a little puzzled as did we.  It was distinctly uncomfortable since we were the only African American couple present-the impression given by the staff person was ""go wait outside and we'll get to you -maybe"".   Since we were both apporpriately attired and working professionals-one a decorated NY Police officer this was really upsetting and not a little embarassing.  Needless to say we took our hard earned money elsewhere and since we live in the neighborhood have decided not to return to Le Paddock.  I really do hope that the owner does see this review and takes note of the staff member on duty last night 3/09/14 and reminds him that customers shoukd be treated well and that word of mouth in a small neighborhood does matter-you never know who you turn off or away at the door.  By the way we went to Hamilton's across the expressway on Fort Hamilton Pkwy and had a wonderful meal and service-funny how they were just as crowded but their staff found a way to treat us well.",2.0
"My boyfriend and I WERE regulars to this restaurant. Very convenient and delicious food a few blocks away from home. My complaint and limit of patience reached its limit today with the poor service we received at Le Paddock. We got there at 8pm ordered two burgers and it was pass 9pm and we were still waiting. We decided to pay for one beer which glass was empty by 8:30pm and no one even bothered to asked if we needed another one, glasses of water emptied since 8:15pm and the tiny bucket of bread empty. When we realized that everyone in the restaurant and people that arrived after us got their food except us then we asked for the check to leave. The waiter seems surprised and said: you never got your burger? All I Wanted to say was no dumb ass, maybe you forgot to put our orders in. Seriously, how long does it take to cook a medium burger?This restaurant has no sense of urgency and service is really really slow. They have been open for over a year and they have not seemed to figure this out yet. I will spend more time on Hamilton which is only a few blocks away.",1.0
"I have to say the brunch is the ""Bomb"" in this neighborhood.  The food and service was good; the ambiance has a rustic french restaurant feel; like a small inn on the road between Normandy and Paris.  I order the omelet special (a country cheese), nice, rustic cut ham, and small salad.  The Coffee was so french, dark, woody, roasting.  It was clearly and dangerously delicious.  Too much Coffee will keep me up; but I had to have several cups.  In the end, I have to give this place 4 - stars!  The owners are  new in the area; Silvi is the one usually behind the counter. she is very friendly and talkative when the place is not too busy.  Her male partner, will generally open the door for you on busy days; a warm greeter.   These are small, friendly gestures, like the ones I received at a country inn on the road between Normandy and Paris............",4.0

The food was great, we started with the Chicken Croquettas with herb-lemon aioli...I think I'd order 2 orders of these every time I return, they where crisp on the outside and moist and flavorful inside. addictive and yummy. We also had the olives which where as they should be, delicious. we split the Beef burger with roasted tomato, slab bacon, aioli and fries and the Grilled steak with gratin dauphinois and sauteed spinach. BOTH where superb. I'm not just in the honeymoon phase here, the steak was cooked perfectly with a herb butter that was melted exquisitely over the entire lean piece of meat. The burger from brioche top through wonderfully seasoned beef  made you think about the next time you go. The fries could have been a bit crisper but I'm letting that slide as they where still delicious. I'm looking forward to returning to get into the rest of the menu, the lamb burger is next. One criticism would be to lose the paper napkins or upgrade the quality. Annoyingly thin and not very useful.",4.0
"I had become somewhat of a ""regular"" here over the summer, as my girlfriend lives around the corner and I became quite a fan of their weekly mussels special. The pesto and cream mussels were especially good. My server was nice enough to let me substitute a beer instead of the Chardonnay that is supposed to come with the special mussels deal. She was friendly but professional and actually did enhance my dining experience, which is not something i typically say about restaurant service. I was flattered that she remembered me and my drink order, I guess one of the perks about neighborhood spots such as this. However, my experience at Le Paddock for a Saturday night dinner recently could not have been more different. After waiting for a table (when there appeared to be a few unoccupied), it took 15 minutes or so for our waiter to even come over and acknowledge us. He rushed through telling us the specials and was not particularly welcoming; his attitude was bored and annoyed, and  it seemed like we were a burden to him. A total 180 from the service before. The artichoke was tough and only about half edible, and the fish special I ordered was way overpriced for both the size and quality My girlfriend's steak was overcooked and very tendon-y and tough.. She is a pretty slow eater, and as she was finishing her steak, it seemed like someone came by every 30 seconds to try to clear the plate. I guess they were just trying to be attentive, but we felt rushed, so eventually she let them take it and we asked for the check. After waiting for 10 minutes, and asking for it twice, I walked back to the bar area and saw out waiter playing with his phone, when we had been waiting, and there were a bunch of people standing at the doorway. Overall, mediocre food and rude and slow service. Maybe I will give it another shot for Mussles night (different & better floor staff, and what seems like different/better cooks too) but on the weekend never again.",1.0

"I am very excited to have a new place in an area in desperate need of solid dining options. We arrived on a Friday night and it was packed - a good sign. We waited for about 10-15 minutes and were seated. This place is so new you can smell the sawdust from the wood paneling near the entrance. The menu looks very exciting and I can't wait to try more items.BF ordered the chardonay - a crisp french chard which resembled more a pinot grigio than the buttery California chards he is used to but it was very good nonetheless. I had the draft beer, the name escapes me, which was really delicious.For appetizer, we had the chicken croquettes, which were to die for and our only complaint was that they only serve three of them, which made it difficult for us to share that last one (1-2-3-4 I declare a thumb war). For dinner, BF had the lamb burger, I had the 4 cheese pizza. Here was the one negative of the evening. BF was served his burger, and we waited and waited and waited for my pie. After I ate half of his french fries, which were amazing by the way, we got the attention of our waiter who promptly resolved the issue. The pizza was really good - you can taste the top notch ingredients. For dessert we had the salted caramel chocolate mousse. It was an amazing chocolate mousse in it's own right but the lack of salted caramel flavor was a bit disappointing. Still, I attribute these blips to growing pains of being a new restaurant and based on how attentive they were when we brought it to their attention, I'd say that these quirks will be worked out and this place has a bright future.  I can't wait to go back a few more times and hopefully add another star.",3.0

"Le Paddock is just what every neighborhood needs -- a solid, dependable, reliable stand-by restaurant that does yeoman's work serving basic brunches and dinners.  We've been coming here regularly since it opened.  We've always loved the food.  While, at first, the service had some glitches to work out, we've found the service to have become considerably smoother.   All in all, the place reminds me a lot of the no-nonsense, non-famous, workmanlike mom & pop bistros that you find in Paris -- comfortable restaurants that you're just glad to have in the neighborhood as your regular.Thus far, I've mostly had pizzas, which I cannot resist because they are so good.  But I have also really enjoyed the charcuterie plate and the coq au vin.  I'm not a particular fan of risotto, but I took a walk on the wild side recently and ordered a shrimp risotto, which was dynamite.  I also recommend the pork loin on a bed of lentils, which pops up periodically on the specials menu from time to time.  The lemon custard dessert is also outstanding.Le Paddock has also pitched the restaurant perfectly for the neighborhood.  It needed both a restaurant appropriate for adults and one where you can take the kids.  Because of the pizzas, they manage to pull off both, which is quite a trick.  It's kid-friendly without going over entirely into kiddy land.  You can have really good quality French food while feeding (really great) pizza to the rugrats.Another thing to note is that Le Paddock also has a bar.  On the forgotten end of Windsor Terrace, there is now a place you can actually sit down and have a beer or a glass of wine on the way home from work.  Such a needed amenity, especially since the untimely demise of the wonderful Nanny Goat Hill.",4.0

"I have been to Le Paddock twice since it opened and am thrilled that Windsor Terrace finally has a destination restaurant.  On my first visit (four days after it opened), the food was delicious but the timing was way off and the service was uneven.  A few weeks later, things have vastly improved.  I went with a group of 9 last night and Le Paddock has 9 new devoted fans. Sylvie could not have been nicer or her staff more attentive.  Food and drink items were all delicious, so I won't recommend anything in particular.  Just go and try whatever strikes you.Update:  I have returned to Le Paddock many many times since my initial review.  The food and ambiance are consistently great and the service is unfailingly friendly.  Creative menu changes and specials make every visit a new experience.",5.0

"Hi again.  I'm on a roll with new finds.  First of all, who knew something like this was hiding in a nook sandwiched between the Prospect Expressway, and a bunch of overpasses with one way in and one way out!!  I love easy-going French bistro style food and these guys are in the perfect niche for me.  Classic dishes at affordable prices, nice people -- Gregory, Aldo -- extremely accommodating and what a surprisingly friendly wine list.  Good job guys.  Can't wait to go back.",4.0
"Unpretentious, delicious, delightful spot. Got the $10.95 weekday lunch special--what a deal. First up, the app: fried cauliflower, made with some hot pepper with a squeeze of lemon to balance it out beautifully. The main: ample portion of plump mussels, crispy frites tasty enough to eat on their own, and extra crusty bread on request to sop up the white wine broth.  A walk home through charming Windsor Terrace completed the perfect afternoon.",4.0
"I am very excited to have a new place in an area in desperate need of solid dining options. We arrived on a Friday night and it was packed - a good sign. We waited for about 10-15 minutes and were seated. This place is so new you can smell the sawdust from the wood paneling near the entrance. The menu looks very exciting and I can't wait to try more items.BF ordered the chardonay - a crisp french chard which resembled more a pinot grigio than the buttery California chards he is used to but it was very good nonetheless. I had the draft beer, the name escapes me, which was really delicious.For appetizer, we had the chicken croquettes, which were to die for and our only complaint was that they only serve three of them, which made it difficult for us to share that last one (1-2-3-4 I declare a thumb war). For dinner, BF had the lamb burger, I had the 4 cheese pizza. Here was the one negative of the evening. BF was served his burger, and we waited and waited and waited for my pie. After I ate half of his french fries, which were amazing by the way, we got the attention of our waiter who promptly resolved the issue. The pizza was really good - you can taste the top notch ingredients. For dessert we had the salted caramel chocolate mousse. It was an amazing chocolate mousse in it's own right but the lack of salted caramel flavor was a bit disappointing. Still, I attribute these blips to growing pains of being a new restaurant and based on how attentive they were when we brought it to their attention, I'd say that these quirks will be worked out and this place has a bright future.  I can't wait to go back a few more times and hopefully add another star.",3.0
"Love, love, love!! This is my favorite restaurant! Always great service, food, and prices. Everyone is always so nice! I've had the lamb burger and the mussels.. De-licious. Fried brussel sprouts are too good to be true. All the food is great.",5.0
"One of my favorite go-to restaurants in Brooklyn for dinner and brunch.  Quality, homey French food that is always spot-on.  The staff is nice and courteous and they have great dinner deals Mon-Thur.  Dollar oysters (Thur) and mussels, fries and a glass of wine for $15 (Tues) are my faves.  Amazing desserts too!",5.0
"Le Paddock is just what every neighborhood needs -- a solid, dependable, reliable stand-by restaurant that does yeoman's work serving basic brunches and dinners.  We've been coming here regularly since it opened.  We've always loved the food.  While, at first, the service had some glitches to work out, we've found the service to have become considerably smoother.   All in all, the place reminds me a lot of the no-nonsense, non-famous, workmanlike mom & pop bistros that you find in Paris -- comfortable restaurants that you're just glad to have in the neighborhood as your regular.Thus far, I've mostly had pizzas, which I cannot resist because they are so good.  But I have also really enjoyed the charcuterie plate and the coq au vin.  I'm not a particular fan of risotto, but I took a walk on the wild side recently and ordered a shrimp risotto, which was dynamite.  I also recommend the pork loin on a bed of lentils, which pops up periodically on the specials menu from time to time.  The lemon custard dessert is also outstanding.Le Paddock has also pitched the restaurant perfectly for the neighborhood.  It needed both a restaurant appropriate for adults and one where you can take the kids.  Because of the pizzas, they manage to pull off both, which is quite a trick.  It's kid-friendly without going over entirely into kiddy land.  You can have really good quality French food while feeding (really great) pizza to the rugrats.Another thing to note is that Le Paddock also has a bar.  On the forgotten end of Windsor Terrace, there is now a place you can actually sit down and have a beer or a glass of wine on the way home from work.  Such a needed amenity, especially since the untimely demise of the wonderful Nanny Goat Hill.",4.0
"This is my favorite restaurant in New York. Every time I come the food is amazing, the atmosphere and service are awesome, and the prices are incredibly reasonable for New York.  The ratatouille and the lamb burger are to die for!!! I love coming here and can't wait to go again!",5.0
"GGGRRrrrr. This place annoyed me. This review is on service, not food. Mostly because I ended up leaving and never eating. Weekday night, not busy, 45 min and no food is not acceptable. Ended up leaving without eating as it was seemingly never coming out. The only positive thing I can think of is all the men running around with their french accents. If you have ALL the time in the world and are not hungry, then try it out!",1.0
"I have been to Le Paddock twice since it opened and am thrilled that Windsor Terrace finally has a destination restaurant.  On my first visit (four days after it opened), the food was delicious but the timing was way off and the service was uneven.  A few weeks later, things have vastly improved.  I went with a group of 9 last night and Le Paddock has 9 new devoted fans. Sylvie could not have been nicer or her staff more attentive.  Food and drink items were all delicious, so I won't recommend anything in particular.  Just go and try whatever strikes you.Update:  I have returned to Le Paddock many many times since my initial review.  The food and ambiance are consistently great and the service is unfailingly friendly.  Creative menu changes and specials make every visit a new experience.",5.0

"My husband and I ate here tonight and although we live in the neighborhood, we hadn't been yet so we were excited to try it. The ambiance was adorable (warm and dark with a nice, simple aesthetic). We ordered the arugula salad and sauteed kale to start and split the lamb burger and bacon/leek/gruyere pizza. Everything was delicious! The service was great even though it was a bit busy when we went. Short story: GO.",5.0
"I hate to do this but I have to share my latest experience at Le Paddock.  Wanted to bring it up a star but there doesn't seem to be any improvement now that the place has ""settled in"".  Service: still disjointed.  The staff is friendly enough but they need to define their roles.Food first the good then the AWFUL:Great: Pizza-deserves all the raves yelpers are giving it.  Creative, fresh, fantastic crust and reasonably priced.  Will return just for this.Run Away: Oysters at 2bucks a pop?  Sounds too good to be true...and is.  Being oyster devotees we ordered two dozen for the four of us, and while they are extremely fresh they were served to us COVERED in sand. Not being one to use the silly fork oysters come with, we dove in and found each briny chilled bite brought a mouthful of sand as whoever prepared them didn't clean the outside of the shell.YUCK.  Ruined the entire experience.Overall attention to detail is what was lacking.  No detail in the service, no detail in preparation of the oysters....I have big hopes that this will improve but with most experiences it just gets worse....I will still keep going, just like a bad relationship....you go back and back til you just cant take it.",3.0
"I was so happy when this cute and cozy restaurant opened only a few blocks from my apartment, and after four visits for both dinner and brunch, I can honestly say that I continue to be impressed. As mentioned before, the space is charming and has a great cozy vibe. The food is excellent--from the pizza to the mussels and eggs (for brunch), and the prices are very reasonable. Service can be a tad slow at times (hence the four stars instead of five) and it's cash only (unless that's changed recently), but overall definitely worth a visit, or a trip to the Terrace!",4.0
"A group of six of us had dinner here and had a great time. Our omnivorous, not-picky table had calamari, tr-colored salad, burgers, mussels, charcuterie, pizza, pasta, escargot. Excellent coffee after. Our waiter was friendly and we all appreciated the tasteful, warm decor. If you don't live in Windsor Terrace, you can make a nice afternoon or evening of walking around the park and enjoying a good meal, or vice-versa, and feel far away from the frazzle of Manhattan.",4.0
