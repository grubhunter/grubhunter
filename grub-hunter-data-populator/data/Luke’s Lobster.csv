"Oh how I wish we had this in San Diego!  My family and I bookmarked a bunch of foodie spots before heading to New York.  This was one of the places that we did not want to miss.  We headed towards the Brooklyn Bridge that day and took a bunch of photos at the Brooklyn Bridge Park.  After our ""photo shoot,"" we looked for Luke's Lobster.  It's kind of tucked away behind the ice cream shop.  If you can't find it, go past the ice cream shop towards Water St facing Shake Shack, look to your left and you should see a brick building.  This is Luke's Lobster.SERVICEThe guys at the register were friendly and patient with us as we tried to decide on what to order because everything looked so good!  We ordered our food and anxiously waited. FOOD is BOMBDIGGITTY!-  Lobster Grilled Cheese Combo ($13 + $3):  I shared this with my Mom.  This included the Lobster Grilled Cheese, a pickle slice, coleslaw (or chips), and your choice of drink.  Every bite was savory and had big chunks of lobster in it.  You can tell that the lobster is fresh fresh fresh!  The cheese didn't overpower the lobster which I really liked.-  Lobster Roll ($16):  Small in size, but big on flavor.  This was my first time ever having a lobster roll so any other place I try now will have some stiff competition.  OVERALLDefinitely give this spot a try!  Order your food and hang out at the Brooklyn Bridge Park and enjoy the scenery!  And afterwards, stop by the ice cream shop on the pier.  Overall, this was a great visit.  I highly recommend!",5.0
"Ultra fresh & all the sources/purveyors are listed on the boards. Limited menu. Cape Cod chips & Dr. brown's soda round out the experience.Not the biggest rolls we've had BUT the quality is excellent & proportion is fair for the average price around $14.We had the Jacob's crab claw appetizer, two crab rolls & 1 lobster roll.Beautifully buttery grilled split top rolls compliment the tender fresh seafood slathered in clarified butter & a sprinkling of celery salt.Outdoor seating almost under the Manhattan Bridge along the Hudson. A great stop for lunch if you dig seafood & dining outdoors.",4.0
I had the taste of Maine and I really enjoyed it. Crab Claws- small but good. Crab roll- very good. Crab was freshShrimp roll- Wonderfully seasoned and good. Lobster Roll- Legit. Good portion of lobster nice buttery finish. As with all Lobster roll joints it's always a bit pricey. But definitely worth it to try every now and again.,4.0
"Luke's at Brooklyn Bridge Park is closed for the season. It's a small hut, very shack-like. They take orders at the window that faces the Brooklyn Bridge.The rolls are all Maine-style - served chilled on a buttered, toasted New England style split-top bun with a little mayo, lemon butter & spicesThe last time I was here, we ordered the:Taste of Maine ($21) - half shrimp roll, half lobster roll, half crab roll. It comes with a drink, chips or slaw, and a pickle. - The lobster was no doubt the best one of the trio. Delightful claw meat, sweet & tender. - The crab was nice and chunky, not too shredded up. - The shrimp was okay. All three were dressed well, not swimming heavily in mayo. The buttery buns had a light crunch to them. Even though the half rolls are small, I appreciate that they try to stuff the bread with lots of filling. Small cup of New England Clam Chowder ($6) - includes oyster crackers. It was a windy day, so the hot soup felt necessary, especially with 3 cold, but delicious sandwiches. It was nice to chomp on a snack and watch the sunset over the bridges.I like their rather simple menu, mainly just rolls and sides. I found the prices reasonable since seafood tends to be on the more expensive side. There are no seats at this location, except for a couple of standing tables. This makes it a little difficult to drink soup, but it's not a big deal since rolls are eaten with your hands.Oh, and the story of how Luke started Luke's Lobster is pretty interesting too.",4.0
"I don't know Luke, but he manages to make what is likely the best lobster roll in the city. The Connecticut style rolls (warm with butter) aren't huge, but are packed with delicious and tender lobster meat. The bun can make or break a lobster roll and happily these are made on a crispy roll which handles the lobster well. As much as I like the roll, I think the grilled cheese served only during the winter is even better. The bread isn't quite as good as the roll, though still good. However, the gooey mixture of cheese and sublime lobster meat is heavenly. Inside is very tight with only about 6 bar seats, so be prepared to take it to go.",5.0
"My first time trying a lobster roll, crab roll and a shrimp roll all at once. The portion is small for the price you pay but it's so worth it. The seafood tastes fresh and they put it inbetween a buttery roll. I wouldn't recommend the shrimp roll though. Overall a great first time experience.",5.0
"*REVIEW 1500*$20 bucks gets you at Luke's Lobster:(1) Lob-sta roll(1) choice of soda(1) choice of chipsThis is straight from Luke's Website:Each morning lobstermen haul traps from the open seas, and they're taken from the dock to Luke's seafood company, where we steam them, pick them, and pack the meat in protective bags, then send them south to Luke's Lobster. The reason why I'm adding this little footnote? I was with a HATER of Lukes! He said the best he's ever had was in Boston. Big Shmeal I say. I like Luke's, I like the price point and the lobster taste fresh. Its not drowning in mayo, its a tasty lobster treat.Also, this place is actually a stand and not a sit down restaurant. I can never understand why people would wait in line for Grimaldis. For hours!! Pass on that stupid azz line, get a lobster roll and enjoy the Brooklyn Waterfront. (Trust me, if you want OG pizza then go to Patsy's in Harlem with no line)Enjoy your life. Don't be a line waiter and don't be a hater of any fresh lobster!",4.0
"The location of this Luke's Lobster is so random to me. If there was not a sign then it would not exist to me. You have to go around the building to see it. I got the taste of Maine. It comes with half of a crab roll, half of a lobster roll, and half of a shrimp roll. It also comes with side of slaw or chips, pickles, and soda. I wish I didn't see the sign though because I was a little disappointed with my rolls. It basically lacked taste and flavor to me. I never got my slaw. They forgot to give it to me when I took it on the go. I like the rolls better in the city.",2.0
Best thing ever!!! Lobster grilled cheese and lobster roll was amazing! The best I've ever had!!! Everything tasted so fresh and the bread went well with it. It's a pretty small portion so everyone should order their own sandwiches. We also got clam chowder. It just tasted normal so nothing special about it. This place is a must-go!! I'll be back to them lobster roll (:,5.0
"What's there not to love? I can eat lobster rolls all day everyday any damn day! Prices are pretty much basic and across the board. There isnt much to expect with the portions. I've tried other decently portioned rolls but do not taste as good as Luke's.  One of the distinct differences that's worthy mentioning though is the perfectly tossed buttery buns they use for the rolls. Overall, Luke's is always a good idea.",5.0

"I love lobster rolls but I hate paying $15+ for a scoop of lobster-studded mayo on a cold hot dog bun. So I breathed a sigh of hangry relief when I finally tried Luke's and saw the healthy heap of fresh lobster lightly coated with mayo on a thick, golden, buttery roll that resembles Texas toast more than hot dog bun. It's the best lobster roll I've tried in NY (2nd place goes to Ed's Lobster Bar, 3rd to Red Hook). The shrimp roll is pretty good too, and half the price of lobster. I wasn't a fan of the crab roll which I found tasteless, but I'm not a fan of crab in general. This location is tucked away, which I like, and the employees are nice. Many of the low star reviews are gripes about the size of the rolls. Obviously it's not a Subway footlong but I think the saying ""it's not the size of the wave, it's the motion of the ocean"" applies here. The lobster and the bread are both so rich and buttery, a couple of bites will fill you up pretty good. If you want a big sandwich, go to Seven Subs on the other side. If you want a lobster roll, come here and try not to be stingy about it.",4.0
"Had to do the tourist thing and visit Luke's Lobster. Of course I got the lobster roll $15 and of course it was delicious. The bun was so soft, the lobster was fresh like it just got off the boat, and the butter was flowing like the East River.  If I could have this several times a week I would, but the portions are small, like most lobster rolls, and I need to keep my weight under control.",4.0
"In my opinion, luke's lobster is as good as it gets. Their lobster roll comes with mayo butter and seasoning, pretty standard, good flavor and you can count on heaping chunks of meat. Guarantee that you wouldn't be complaining about a bun to lobster ratio that exists so many places elsewhere. And don't just stick to lobster. The crab roll is also amazing.

"I was in the area for a interview, and decided to try this place after seeing all of the good reviews. I tried a lobster roll with a pickle on the side. It was amazing!

$18 for a lobster roll with chips pickle and a water.... A joke right ? Ive been wanting to come since last summer... And i finally made it and boy am I disappointed ! First off its so hidden.

And i brought my great grandparents and they had the Noah's ark. I know its half rolls but geesh they were small. They seemed to like it tho. My grandma said the coleslaw wasnt good. I wont be back. Im heartbroken. Seriously a bust !,1.0
"Got the Taste of Maine which gives you 1/2 a roll of each of their specialty (shrimp, crab and lobster) for $20, which also includes a drink and a coleslaw/bag of chips. It's a good deal when you want a taste/bite of something, plus you can go elsewhere to continue on with your grub fest. I enjoyed the shrimp roll the most! It was fresh, moist and flavorful.

"If you breathlessly read every single word I write (as I can only assume you do), you already know that I'm an enormous fan of Luke's Lobster.Well, if you take their wonderfully fresh seafood (with the simple, impeccable preparation they are justifiably known for) and you move it into the middle of a beautiful park, my opinion is not likely to change. Even if some old lady decides she doesn't have to follow the basic laws of society, and can cut anyone she wants on a whim because her time on earth is coming to an end.*This is the same delicious lobster or shrimp roll you are used to getting from Luke and his lovely staff, but in the location they were always meant to have._____________*Not because I'm going to kill her over a shrimp roll, but because she's so old.

"I still cannot believe I paid $42 before tip for the MOST TINY piece of ""roll' ever!! I literally laughed when they handed me my order of the Noah's Ark (sample of 2 half rolls of each). First of all, my issue here with Luke's does not simply rely on the hidden location and service which ill get into soon but the fact that they have the audacity to have the word ROLLS on their menu just baffles me! With the cost you are charging, you can at least save us the agony of serving cheap hot dog buns and ripping them in half with the nerve to call them 'half rolls' then charging so much for them. I get that the cost of seafood can be high but the lobster which is the most important part was not even that great. Ive had better. The seasoning was good which is what saved me from going back to the counter and demanding a refund lol.....Either way its safe to say I wont be returning and its a shame since I spend so much time over in bk bridge park. But the main reason is because there is a young guy there with glasses who had the nerve to shoo me away while he was texting on his phone one time because I knocked on the window to ask the operating hours, which apparently I had missed that day. Im like dude its fine if your closed I dont bite, I just want to know what your hours are... Rude! (Its 11a-4p btw) ...Then he opens the door and claims he didnt hear me because hes sick- like that makes any sense.Anyway, NOT WORTH YOUR TIME OR MONEY. Maybe in the summer if they ever decide to change their fake hot dog buns into real rolls and serve even a slightly larger portion Ill reconsider.",1.0
"There is nothing on a hot hot hot NYC day and the reward of a cool, tasty seafood roll (especially if you have just done a death march across the Brooklyn Bridge at noon time in peak sun... not sure who's brilliant idea that was... but whoever thought of Luke's after is a HERO!)It's right by the Brooklyn Ice Cream Factory and River Cafe. It's a cute little stand-alone building (No 7 Subs are in front) and Luke's is in the back. We got the taste of Maine (half shrimp, crab and lobster) and the plain ole Lobster Roll, and another whole crab after the taste of Maine.The bread is perfectly warm, buttery and toastedThe inside filing is perfectly cool, tasty, and seasoned and REFRESHING. You get large chunks of lobster/shrimp/crab.So the union is perfect in your mouth- warm bread, cool seafood, with a buttery after taste (it's heaven!)Mayo- don't need mayo. And you won't find any in the sandwiches. This is the most lobster you can get, with the least amount of work (no shelling required) and it's worth every penny.

"Just want to throw in a glowing review for Luke's.  I've only been to the DUMBO outpost, and both times it was on our way to Shmorgasburg -- only to find ourselves choosing to avoid the lines and heat.  My 3.5 year old son and I opted for the Taste of Maine, which is three half-rolls:  a shrimp, a lobster, and a crab, plus a pickle, drink, and bag of chips.  The price ain't cheap, but it turned out to be plenty of food for the two of us.  He loved the shrimp (easy to eat with a fork) while I preferred the tasty crab and lobster, both mixed with the right amount of mayo and seasoning.  There's not much seating, but at least what little there is is in the SHADE.One note about Luke's:  you won't see it from the street.  For whatever reason, Luke's gave the street side to its counterpart, No. 7 Sub (which I'm also determined to try), so you'll have to sneak around back to find some of the best seafood in Brooklyn.",4.0

"Before getting serious with someone ask them those magical words, Do u like Lukes? And really understand the importance of this question. LL is the best lobster roll you will possibly find in New York. How can you possibly be with someone that doesn't recognize great lobster or appreciate seafood drenched in butter? I know you may want to try the other items available on the menu, don't bother, it's all about the lobster roll (no sharing please, don't insult the seafood gods).People always say this is a hard spot to find, but it's literally at the end of the park. So go through one of the most beautiful parks, enjoy the best view of Manhattan, people watch, roll around the field with someone you love, and then walk until ur at the very end where you will smell the butter and see some nautical items to direct you. The service is friendly. You may find it pricey but it's well worth it. Seats are hard to come by when the weather is warmer but sit on a ledge, or walk to the nearest park bench, or walk by and laugh at those people in line at Grimaldi's while u savor ecstasy...",4.0
"RUN - do not walk, to this truly Down-East lobster shack, which sits amidst the unfortunate and almost exclusively-tourist-populated, soon to be Pedestrian-Mega-Mall known as ""DUMBo."" For far longer than I care to think about, I have made my home here, in this glacially-paced, hovel of gentrification - packed with entitled Super-Moms who will run you off the sidewalk (how dare you occupy the same space uninvited?!) to make way for their 3x-wide Super Strollers (which cost roughly as much as a year and a half of my rent...) I digress. IF you end up here, (which, as a New Yorker, you probably never will, excepting, maybe the badass park,) GO HERE! The lobster is more fresh and delicious and perfect than ANY place I have sampled up and down the eastern seaboard - better than Mass, better than NH, and, dare I say it, better than Maine! And guess what: It's totally reasonably priced. Unlike EVERYTHING else in DUMBo, the owner has decided that a 1500% mark-up is downright disgusting and has priced his beyond-memorable lobster rolls at like, $15. There are lattes in DUMBo which cost that much. And I have had lobster rolls in Manhattan that weren't half as good for over $30. If you are TRULY obsessed with the IDEAL lobster roll (perfectly toasted/buttered bun, REAL tail/claw/leg combo of FRESH meat, JUST the right amount of mayo with a dash of proprietary spices,) this is your spot! There is nothing more to say. But even if you're not an obsessive connoisseur, it's still the best and the cheapest in the city, so it's a win-win-win all around. Just remember, once you're in price-gougey, ""We wish we were Westchester"" DUMBo, even the ice cream next door will probably cost more than this lobster roll... and still leave you wanting. Because DUMBo is just like a girl from Suburban Connecticut - it looks lovely when you just check it out from down the street - it has an aura of historical significance and a seeming gravitas, linked somehow to American history. But once you get up close and investigate, it turns out to be just another nasty, WASPy Manhattanite who only left the island to afford the 3rd bedroom for her illegal migrant nanny. But she still pretends to be progressive, inclusive and forward-thinking...

"It was fresh, tasty and hit the spot, it said it had a certain portion of lobster meat but we thought it did not have as much meat as it claimed. We went on a Wednesday at noon. We discovered one opened in Park Slope and we are heading there next time because its closer.  Be ye ready Park Slope!!!We also tried the Noah's Ark, worth trying if you like seafood variety and my wife loved it.",4.0
"I still cannot believe I paid $42 before tip for the MOST TINY piece of ""roll' ever!! I literally laughed when they handed me my order of the Noah's Ark (sample of 2 half rolls of each). First of all, my issue here with Luke's does not simply rely on the hidden location and service which ill get into soon but the fact that they have the audacity to have the word ROLLS on their menu just baffles me! With the cost you are charging, you can at least save us the agony of serving cheap hot dog buns and ripping them in half with the nerve to call them 'half rolls' then charging so much for them. I get that the cost of seafood can be high but the lobster which is the most important part was not even that great. Ive had better. The seasoning was good which is what saved me from going back to the counter and demanding a refund lol.....Either way its safe to say I wont be returning and its a shame since I spend so much time over in bk bridge park. But the main reason is because there is a young guy there with glasses who had the nerve to shoo me away while he was texting on his phone one time because I knocked on the window to ask the operating hours, which apparently I had missed that day. Im like dude its fine if your closed I dont bite, I just want to know what your hours are... Rude! (Its 11a-4p btw) ...Then he opens the door and claims he didnt hear me because hes sick- like that makes any sense.Anyway, NOT WORTH YOUR TIME OR MONEY. Maybe in the summer if they ever decide to change their fake hot dog buns into real rolls and serve even a slightly larger portion Ill reconsider.",1.0
"There is nothing on a hot hot hot NYC day and the reward of a cool, tasty seafood roll (especially if you have just done a death march across the Brooklyn Bridge at noon time in peak sun... not sure who's brilliant idea that was... but whoever thought of Luke's after is a HERO!)It's right by the Brooklyn Ice Cream Factory and River Cafe. It's a cute little stand-alone building (No 7 Subs are in front) and Luke's is in the back. We got the taste of Maine (half shrimp, crab and lobster) and the plain ole Lobster Roll, and another whole crab after the taste of Maine.The bread is perfectly warm, buttery and toastedThe inside filing is perfectly cool, tasty, and seasoned and REFRESHING. You get large chunks of lobster/shrimp/crab.So the union is perfect in your mouth- warm bread, cool seafood, with a buttery after taste (it's heaven!)Mayo- don't need mayo. And you won't find any in the sandwiches. This is the most lobster you can get, with the least amount of work (no shelling required) and it's worth every penny. Cape Cod chips yum, Shade is perfect (you go back out front by No. 7 Subs and share tables). Just kick your feet up and enjoy the viewBathroom is right up water street on the left (and the bathrooms are air conditioned and have running water!)",5.0

"Lobster rolls and sun by the water.  Life is wonderful when then little things in life just come together in harmony.  Firstly, the lobster roll and crab roll are simply amazing and appropriately sized to satisfy your taste buds without making you feel like a glutton.  You really taste the fresh lobster with very little mayo in a lightly buttered roll.  The crab roll was also delicious but may have suffered slightly from being eaten second.  Secondly or firstly 1A, the woman at the window was so nice and thoughtful that she made the experience better than table service in an air conditioned restaurant.  There are a few tables to stand and eat which is fine.  For a more enjoyable dining experience, walk a few feet to find a seat by the water to enjoy the water breeze, the sun, and the view with your meal.",4.0
"Just want to throw in a glowing review for Luke's.  I've only been to the DUMBO outpost, and both times it was on our way to Shmorgasburg -- only to find ourselves choosing to avoid the lines and heat.  My 3.5 year old son and I opted for the Taste of Maine, which is three half-rolls:  a shrimp, a lobster, and a crab, plus a pickle, drink, and bag of chips.  The price ain't cheap, but it turned out to be plenty of food for the two of us.  He loved the shrimp (easy to eat with a fork) while I preferred the tasty crab and lobster, both mixed with the right amount of mayo and seasoning.  There's not much seating, but at least what little there is is in the SHADE.One note about Luke's:  you won't see it from the street.  For whatever reason, Luke's gave the street side to its counterpart, No. 7 Sub (which I'm also determined to try), so you'll have to sneak around back to find some of the best seafood in Brooklyn.",4.0

"Before getting serious with someone ask them those magical words, Do u like Lukes? And really understand the importance of this question. LL is the best lobster roll you will possibly find in New York. How can you possibly be with someone that doesn't recognize great lobster or appreciate seafood drenched in butter? I know you may want to try the other items available on the menu, don't bother, it's all about the lobster roll (no sharing please, don't insult the seafood gods).People always say this is a hard spot to find, but it's literally at the end of the park. So go through one of the most beautiful parks, enjoy the best view of Manhattan, people watch, roll around the field with someone you love, and then walk until ur at the very end where you will smell the butter and see some nautical items to direct you. The service is friendly. You may find it pricey but it's well worth it. Seats are hard to come by when the weather is warmer but sit on a ledge, or walk to the nearest park bench, or walk by and laugh at those people in line at Grimaldi's while u savor ecstasy...",4.0
"RUN - do not walk, to this truly Down-East lobster shack, which sits amidst the unfortunate and almost exclusively-tourist-populated, soon to be Pedestrian-Mega-Mall known as ""DUMBo."" For far longer than I care to think about, I have made my home here, in this glacially-paced, hovel of gentrification - packed with entitled Super-Moms who will run you off the sidewalk (how dare you occupy the same space uninvited?!) to make way for their 3x-wide Super Strollers (which cost roughly as much as a year and a half of my rent...) I digress. IF you end up here, (which, as a New Yorker, you probably never will, excepting, maybe the badass park,) GO HERE! The lobster is more fresh and delicious and perfect than ANY place I have sampled up and down the eastern seaboard - better than Mass, better than NH, and, dare I say it, better than Maine! And guess what: It's totally reasonably priced. Unlike EVERYTHING else in DUMBo, the owner has decided that a 1500% mark-up is downright disgusting and has priced his beyond-memorable lobster rolls at like, $15. There are lattes in DUMBo which cost that much. And I have had lobster rolls in Manhattan that weren't half as good for over $30. If you are TRULY obsessed with the IDEAL lobster roll (perfectly toasted/buttered bun, REAL tail/claw/leg combo of FRESH meat, JUST the right amount of mayo with a dash of proprietary spices,) this is your spot! There is nothing more to say. But even if you're not an obsessive connoisseur, it's still the best and the cheapest in the city, so it's a win-win-win all around. Just remember, once you're in price-gougey, ""We wish we were Westchester"" DUMBo, even the ice cream next door will probably cost more than this lobster roll... and still leave you wanting. Because DUMBo is just like a girl from Suburban Connecticut - it looks lovely when you just check it out from down the street - it has an aura of historical significance and a seeming gravitas, linked somehow to American history.

We took our food to-go and ate on the grassy fields of the park, which provided a great view. The food itself was good. The seafood was fresh and delicious and the portions were nicely sized, though I think there should have been a little more food considering that lunch total cost us around $42. To be honest, you could probably make this food at home. The seasoning is simple enough, and toasting the roll is basic. However, I am still rather impressed by their ability to get fresh seafood into and throughout NYC and though a little pricey, it was still a good, filling lunch.",4.0
"LOVE LUKE'S LOBSTER!  the rolls are nothing short of delicious, and the buns don't disappoint, either.  In such a great setting down underneath the Brooklyn Bridge, I wish the area directly behind the stand was opened up more.  I'm not sure if it's in their plans or not.  It looks like fixing it up is in a later phase of the BBPark from what I researched.  Great to hit up on an afternoon or evening adventure to DUMBO and the park.",4.0

"What awful service! I went today, stood in line for a bit during my lunch break for work, and was dismayed that the toaster broke! Do they not have a backup plan? And to add, the worker abruptly told the customers this with an attitude! I gave this place a chance when they first opened and were serving flat fountain soda. But I'll be sure never to go there again (which becomes a weekly routine) and I'll make sure anyone I know doesn't deal with this nonsense again!",1.0
I am big fan of lobster rolls and I must say this place did not disappoint and for 15 dollars per roll!!! they give you a lot! Delicious! Shrimp rolls were just as tasty perfectly seasoned without being drowned in mayo. Too bad they were out of chowder I guess I will have to try it next time. There are a few small tables on the side but you can always take your food and find another place to enjoy your meal with a wonderful view of the city.,5.0
