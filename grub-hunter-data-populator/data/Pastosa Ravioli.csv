"I was hanging out in South Brooklyn on Saturday, and I decided to make a stop in Bensonhurst for some Sunday night family dinner goods. I checked out Italian food stores on Yelp, and Pastosa ravioli came up. My mouth began watering. Visions of fluffy ricotta filled pillows of pasta and savory Sunday night sauce danced in my head. I took the D train a few stops up, walked 2 blocks, and then saw the old school painted storefront of Pastosa Ravioli.There were plenty of Italian goodies inside the store: lots of ravioli of course, olive oil, imported real deal Nutella, sopressata, cheeses, pizza dough (2 for a dollar!), house made sauces, prepared stuffed peppers and mozzarella sticks, the works. I grabbed some spinach ravioli for my Sunday night meal, and headed back to my apartment. In hindsight, I should have grabbed a few packages for my freezer.I made the ravioli Sunday night with some red sauce, and they were absolutely fantastic.. definitely some of the best tasting store-made ravioli I have encountered. The spinach flavor was abundant, and the filling was creamy and perfect. The pasta itself maintained its chewiness, even after being frozen. This is an easy pit stop on the way home from Spumoni Gardens that I will make every single time in the future.",5.0
"The very best in Bensonhurst,The flavor here reminds me of the original Sbarro,on 65 Street & 17 Avenue back in the days.I can not think of any item here that I do not like,My favorite are the prosciutto croquettes/ balls,Actually I like all the cooked foods mostly, They also have a excellent cold cuts section as well.Of course they have a Raviolis,Which the meat ones are my favorite.35 years ago till now, Same fantastic flavor.The homemade smoked mozzarella is the best.   Best Regards,Jimmy WongVIP AUTO NYC",5.0
"Excellent place for all your Italian cuisine needs. I absolutely love everything they have to offer particularly the ravioli and cappicola. The staff are awesome, and very helpful. Authentic italian deli you can't go wrong with this place. Prices are fair for the quality food you are getting and well worth it. The store is a good size, and they have quite a variety to choose from which is a bonus. I've been going here for a few years, and I will definitely continue to shop here!",5.0
"I've always passed by this place wondering what goodies were being sold, but I've never had the audacity to go into this store until today! I wanted to make an easy/quick dinner for my boyfriend and I so I decided to check out Pastosa Ravioli. As soon as I entered I noticed how small the store/aisle looked compared to the outside, but that really wasn't an issue. I had an idea of what I wanted to make (penne w/ vodka sauce) luckily, all the ingredients were extremely easy to find!! Thankfully, I didn't have to make several trips else where, because everything I needed was at the palm of my hand. (Meats, pasta, sauce, etc) *Premade Vodka Sauce (pretty tasty, w/out extra ingredients added) *Lobster ravioli (definitely fulfilling and full of flavors)*Fresh pounded chicken cutlet *Bruschetta w/ tomato  & basil, this was my snack while I prepped dinner. Simply amazing, for about $1!I am rating this place 5 stars because it is affordable, quality/quantity is sufficient , & hands down CUSTOMER SERVICE IS PHENOMENAL, the lady behind the register was extremely helpful and delightful!!!I will definitely RETURN!!!",5.0
"I adore this place.... There are a few things that I come for consistently. The stuffed rigatoni in their freezer section is aaaaaaaaaamaaaaazzzzzing..... I like to top it off with my own homemade ground beef sauce, so delicious! They also have pizza dough (2 for $1) that I use to make homemade pizzas and a canned pizza sauce called Don Pepe that I've found to be the cheapest price around. They have a round focaccia bread in baskets just when you walk in that's pretty tasty as well. I purchased cold cuts from them once and they were good, Boars Head. There are some things I would never purchase from there, like their fresh mozzarella, and that's just because it's overpriced compared to what I can get it for close by in the neighborhood. Lines are always short because the customer service is great!",5.0
"This place is a brooklyn institution and has been pumping out fresh pasta, manicotti and ravioli forever.  They are probably best known for the awesome fresh raviolis but they sell so any other  delicious foods and Italian products. Just a fantastic store that is very well run. Starving just thinking about it.",5.0
"They make a wide variety of pastas, including gluten free.  Great Marinara Sauce, good Italian groceries for a small store.  They also have a Deli counter, for both cold cuts and prepared items, as well as butcher meats.  Pastosa has a website for people out of state, but shipping fresh food is expensive by mail.",4.0
The Absolute BEST Ravioli!! They prepared food in the deli is also Amazing! I'm not one to buy premade food but the chicken rollatine was amazing. We live in the DC area and went back three times to bring home ravoli and chicken rollatine. The olive salads were also amazing.,5.0

"Queenie R needs to get a life   First of all you can see somethings up when they write a review that's so long.  All I had to do was scan the first few lines and/or paragraphs and I know something's up.  If people are emailing her, it's obvious that many cannot understand how she can even say such harsh things about a place where people are waiting on lines even around the corner during holidays for over 40 years.She calls Bensonhurst  ""a dump?""  The prices of homes in this area are through the roof and people pay a high price to live in this area.  It has gone through changes through the years, but is still a very good area.I cannot trust her judgement as her review is so lengthy and boring and most important inconsistent with what everyone else is saying.  We all shop at Pastosa for our food with patience as their quality is worth waiting for.",5.0

"Nothing better than Pastosa for italian delicacies. Anyone who doesnt like this place and considers themselves well traveled or well versed in cuisine but complains about this place simply can not be taken seriously. $16.00 for a good olive oil is not expensive at all and the raviolis havent gone up much in price in the past few years. I hardly consider them overpriced for thirty six raviolis. Best riceballs and potato croquettes, not like when a supermarket tries to make them. Great dough for pizza.

Deep in Bensonhurst, there exists a shop with every type of ravioli you could ever want, from spinach to mushroom to pesto to lobster to crab to broccoli rabe to truffle to chicken to beef...and they're all so good.

"Italian food is all about the quality of the ingredients. If you want to do it right you need good ingredients. You won't do terribly well if you're at the mercy of the supermarket, and specialty shops can be outrageously expensive. The ideal solution would be a neighborhood Italian American shop that imports their own ingredients from Italy, makes fresh pasta and sauces and even has a butcher. Good luck finding that - unless you happen to be in Bensonhurst.I've never had better Italian sausages than those I buy here. I thought the house made examples from Sauce were excellent, but these are substantially better (for about half the price).  The fennel sausage is outrageously meaty. If that was all they sold this would be a five star review. But the sausages are just the tip of the iceberg.Of course there's all manner of top flight fresh pasta and ravioli. Even the house brand dried pasta is excellent, and two bucks for a one pound bag of excellent orecchiette is a deal. I haven't tried any of the prepared foods they sell, but everything looked fresh and delicious - on par with what you'd expect to see at an Italian American wedding where no expense was spared. They also sell olive oil, tomatoes, imported cheese and dried sausages. Everything you'd expect to find in a good old school Italian specialty store.I don't care where you live, this place is worth a trip.",5.0

"Rethink Italian food.I stood perplexed clutching my box of raviolis piled high with an 8 inch round focaccia bread and a container of marinara sauce. The line was moving fast and there I was chatting away with the workers and my neighbors in line all while silently debating in my head whether or not to buy the big, medium, or small rice balls. No, the answer was no. There was no way two people could eat all this and more if I didn't stop here.  A visit to Pastosa is overwhelming. It's a small grocery full of freshly made pastas and Italian specialties from eggplant cutlets and prosciutto to arancini and sausages. I learned a lot during my short visit. That most, if not all, of the people there shopping grew up on Pastosa. I envied their past meals, future ones, and associations of home and family they made with Pastosa. Pastosa is the stuff lineages were built on.Mini thin squares of ravioli is what I am used to. The raviolis at Pastosa are large, plump, round and filling. A box has 12 pieces. Four pieces are an ample serving per person. They are good and they don't explode or leak when you boil them. We went with the squid ink filled with crab. Quite an adventurous pick in my opinion although I guarantee any flavor of ravioli you pick from Pastosa will be divine. I have my eye on the butternut squash and a container of squid ink linguini for my next visit. What can I say, I am obsessed with the squid ink pasta.I don't mind cooking at home, especially when I am cooking with Pastosa. Dinner becomes heavenly. I savor every bite. Slowly.

Ok. I'm not going to deny this but this as old school Brooklyn Italian as it gets. The place although a bit 3rd world like and a bit stuck in time..

The namesake ravioli are the freshest, most tender & delicate & generally amazing ravioli you can buy. I've had Vareniki at Glechniks that came close.

They make them fresh everyday.  Also can buy many other types such as lobster ravioli, squash raviolis, ect.  But the plain large ones are the best.  Meat and deli counter all excellent.  Fresh seafood salad awesome.  I also buy pastosa olive oil here for 15.99$ extra virgin for a gallon.  What a deal.  So glad that this holdout is left in area.",5.0
"I really like it here. The ppl are nice, the Italian dry goods not bad. I would return to it for sure!",4.0
"I have been coming here for years... everything is freshly made. Located on the corner of Bay Ridge Parkway and New Utrecht Ave, it is very convenient for me to drop by any time I need something.The food here is always fresh and always delicious.  I come here for the ravioli's and pick up a couple of boxes every so often. The large round kind are to die for. They have many different flavors as well bu the cheese raviolis are what I come here for. They have a wide variety of different pastas as well and all are made fresh on site. Plus you can pick up cheese, sauce and fresh cold cuts as well. If you want fresh pasta of all kinds... come to Pastosa and you will have the best!",5.0
"I've been in love with Pastosa since I was very young.  The ravioli is excellent, their mozzerella is the best but my favorite has to be their stuffed artichoke hearts.  I get them everytime I go!",5.0
"This place is amazing! I'm so happy to live 2 blocks away. My whole family loves to have dinner from pastosa. Even my kids gobble up the food. The ravioli melts in your mouth, and my husband is especially crazy for the prosciutto balls.I love the homemade sauces. Also, it makes such a difference that all the staff are SO nice. It's like they care about each person, and really want you to have the best experience possible. We're still waiting to try the garlic bread because it's always sold out when I get there :( but the round focaccia bread makes up for it. Simply delicious.",5.0
"Memories. I love this place. it's hardcore old school Bensonhurst. I would stay away from canned and dried goods here (in favor of coluccio on 60th which is far cheaper) but for prepared foods, and in particular their fresh Pasta & Ravioli (of which variety are legion) are in their own category. The namesake ravioli are the freshest, most tender & delicate & generally amazing ravioli you can buy. I've had Vareniki at Glechniks that came close. But still a runner-up.  I spend a lot of time upstate, and when I do I only eat ravioli if my housemate makes them. From scratch. By hand. I will not buy Wegmans brand ravioli. It's not the same.",5.0
"Bought chicken cutlets and roasted peppers today. Cutlets were hard, dry and tasted like liver ! Roasted peppers tasted like from a jar !!.  If this is what Pastosa has turned into, turn away ! Staten Island store on Forest Ave 100% better.",2.0
"Oh Pastosa...  You are part of the reason why I am proud to come from Bensonhurst, Brooklyn.  I mean there are a lot of reasons why I am NOT proud to come from Bensonhurst, so you actually make up for a lot of those.I'll move on to the review though... The food here is simply out of this world.  The ravioli selection is SICK, the sauces are incredible, the cheeses are to die for.  Writing this is making me salivate at 6:46 AM! If I lived across the street from Pastosa, I'd be the biggest chick you've ever seen.In short, this place is the epitome of Brooklyn-Italian (yes, there IS a difference) specialty foods.",5.0
"I have been having these guys cater my holiday dinner at my school for 2 years now...I grew up eating Pastosa food seeing as though my parents are from Bensonhurst.  It is amazing......the rice balls!!!  The ravioli....in that box!You have not eaten great prepared Italian good until you eat here!  Great staff as well.  It might be a little out of the way for some, but it is worth it.....trust me.",5.0

"If you are used to eating frozen pasta at the supermarket you are really missing out on the true Italian pasta experience. Just thinking of the blue and white striped box gets my mouth watering! Imagine the richest, creamiest, perfectly seasoned melt in your mouth ricotta, inside a perfectly wrapped pasta and you have experienced Pastosa's manicotti. To say it's perfect is an understatement!The ravioli and stuffed shells are also unmatched, the one thing you have to NOT do is freeze these babies! Buy them fresh and cook the same day, or leave in the refrigerator and cook within a couple of days and you will get the most taste out of them this way. They do sell frozen specialty ravioli which is great, but the real cream of the crop are the fresh rounds and mini squares...just trust me on this!The store itself is an Italian haven, red white and green are draped all over the outside and inside. Imported products are lined up everywhere inside and the lines are usually long on weekend mornings. Get some rice balls, hot sopressata and some fresh mozzarella along with the pasta and invite me over because you are making my favorite Sunday dinner!You really can't make a wrong purchase at Pastosa because just about everything they sell is of the highest quality, if you live near one of these great stores you need to treat yourself to the ultimate Italian experience!",5.0

"I discovered Pastosa by winning a give away at a Brooklyn Cyclones baseball game.  They close at 6:30 pm during the week, so it takes a little effort to go there after work by the D train.It is now my favorite place to pick up ravioli, self labeled canned tomatoes and cheese. They have fresh pasta including squid ink and whole wheat, tortellini too. I noticed 3 twelve inch pizza crusts for $2.99, I'll try that when the weather cools off. There is a large variety of frozen ravioli in many flavors including goat cheese, lobster, pumpkin, crab with squid ink, spinach, beef, szechuan shrimp, pancetta potato leek, and more! I have gotten the basil pesto ravioli before, but the fresh cheese ravioli is so good. I get the large round and 3 or 4 makes a good serving. The sell ready made Italian dishes and sauces. I often get the basil pesto and marinara. They also carry puttanesca, red or white clam sauce, fra diavolo, marscapone, scampi, alfredo and vodka sauces and sundried tomato pesto and walnut pesto.The service is rather friendly, and at the door is an order sheet you can pick up and write your cold cut order, and a listing of all of the homemade pasta choices.",5.0

"I absolutely love Pastosa's products; I've been a frequent customer for over 25 years.  I can't find a better salumeria than Pastosa although Trunzo on 18th Avenue has recently become my favorite.  The clerks in Pastosa aren't very personable; seem to want to hurry and are abrupt in their taking care of your order.  One thing that will probably deter me from Pastosa is that, although they have 3 cash registers, they are all hidden from the customers' sight.  That same practice holds true for their scales. You are not able to see what they are doing and when they announce the price, you just go along with it, whether it's correct or not.  I believe it's against the law to hide the cash registers.  I'm going to check with the BBB.  Please Pastosa start showing your cash registers and not have them hiding behind jars of food!!!!!!!  At Trunzo and also A&S in Bay Ridge (another great purveyor of Italian goods/specialties) their registers and scales are in full view.",4.0

"This place is right near where one of my clients lives-on the New Utrecht/ Bensonhurst border-and I have to thank Diana for opening my eyes to it. Because of her recommendation, I bought some fresh mozzarella, some fresh pasta and some delicious imported sheep's cheese from Sardinia today. I spent about an hour looking around at every item they sell, and marveling at the items that reminded me of some things I saw on a trip I took to Southern Italy years ago. When I left Pastosa's today, I felt lucky ---like I have just been turned-on to a neighborhood best-kept-secret-kind-of-place that has probably been a Brooklyn Italian-American institution for many years. I have officially added them to my vast mental card catalog of best places to shop for fresh, great food. They  carry both fresh, quality, in-store prepared traditional Italian-American dishes, meats, cheeses, and imported items and brands from all over Italy. Places like this are a dying breed, so I hope Pastosa's stays around for many years to come!I got all nostalgic today, so I will now turn my review of Pastosa's into a blog about Old World NYC food institutions... One of the things I have a deep appreciation for are relics of yesteryear - pieces of history that transport you to a different era or place. That can apply to just about anything, but in New York, one of my favorites are old-world institutions - places that haven't yet been wiped out by the Disney Worldization and/or mass cookie-cutter cheap, mass building development trend that we've lived through before the recession. I consider authentic, family-owned ethnic specialty food stores that have survived for generations to be a sub category of New York cultural institutions. Afterall, a lot of what makes up institutions - especially in New York- is culture and food...wait, I guess food is culture(?) I'm talking about the kind that give people both within and outside a particular culture a healthy dose of what it means to eat traditional foods from their country(ies) - especially when the presentation is nice, the service is good, they carry fresh and imported items, and you can see that there's a loyal following. Pastosa's is definitely in this category.",4.0
