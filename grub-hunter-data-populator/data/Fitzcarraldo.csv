"In the movie Fitzcarraldo, an idealistic Irishman seeks to finance the construction of an opera house in the Amazonian city of Iquitos through a wild, desperate scheme to farm on a distant rubber source. He doesn't succeed. The movie celebrates the nobility of his effort with a wonderful final scene, where Fitzcarraldo stands on the deck of his now ruined boat, serenading the town with what will be just one shipboard performance. This elegant parable stuck with me long after the first I saw it at a Harvard Square movie house. I even journeyed to Iquitos and sailed down the Amazon myself, visiting places from the actual production of the movie. A couple times I've asked the waiters and managers of Fitzcarraldo what this northern Italian restaurant has to do with a tale of ambition and failure in the jungle, but none seems to have much of an answer. Certainly this restaurant is no failure. It operated straight through the disaster at the co-working/studio space attached. The pastas, small plates and drinks are simply top notch.I've come for drinks, I've come for a snack, I've come for full meals and always been satisfied. I suspect the out of the way location - it's hidden between a couple of warehouses are the only reason this isn't more known. I'm fine with walking a little bit for this cuisine. It certainly beats dragging a boat over a mountain, a reference, of course Mr. Herzog's wonderful movie.",5.0
"Candle-lit ambiance, European-style tile floors and lovely hanging plants!  Good service, but overall not what I expected for an Italian restaurant. Not many Italian wines by the glass. The scallop entree was good but not great. In the dim light I couldn't tell the round cut parsnips from the scallops and I felt obligated to eat them for some reason! The pistachio dusting also seemed unnecessary (and I later turned down dessert when 1 of the 2 options also had pistachios in it). I would have preferred a more classic scallop dish, but it's good to try new things. The other dish we ordered was monkfish that came in a stew dominated by fennel and red peppers. That dish was disappointing; the flavors just didn't come together in our opinion. This isn't your typical Italian restaurant, but it's worth a try for a date night.",4.0
"After having car problems in the middle of nowhere, my bf and I decided to go to this cute little place we saw on our way while we waited for triple A and it was a pretty good idea, especially because we were starving. The place is carefully decorated with sustainable, but gorgeous pieces all over, which I personally appreciate. We started out with the antipasti, which included 2 cheeses, 2 meats, honey, tiny olives and of course, bread. Really good. Don't really remember the name of ANYTHING we had, but I'll use my great descriptive skills to guide anyone who needs guidance. I ordered an apple jack drink with aperol, it was yummy. For the entrees, I ordered the hanger steak which came with a really good and creamy polenta and shreds of mushroom. (I think there was also some truffle oil on it.) My boyfriend ordered the branzino with clams, and that was also pretty good. The skin of the branzino was nice and crispy even with the broth underneath it. Portions weren't huge, they were actually a great size. Perfect enough to leave you full, but not dying of fullness (you know what I mean.) And yes, after all the goodness we decided to be crazy and get dessert. We ordered the caramelized white pudding and it was the bomb.com. It came with salted walnuts on top and tasted like arequipe, a Colombian soft caramel. Our server was very pleasant and we enjoyed our experience. PS. We also had a really nice window table which is always a plus !",4.0
"Love love love! Always shocked to have a meal come out to under $100. Two apps, two entrees and bottle of wine included! Definitely recommend trying their farinata (a sort of small pizza dish, but gluten free!). For pasta ya gotta go with the Cacio e pepe. Their spaghetti with clams was kinda bland once you got past the tasty clams.Overall great, adorable spot and nice for dates!",4.0
"I had no idea this was at the 3rd Ward space, so it was a bit bittersweet walking in. As with most restaurants in BK, it was freezing. Don't sit by the windows - word of advice.hoooweeevverr, the food was awesome. Get the farinata. Throw in my wild boar for fun - it's got a bit of funk to it, but is tasty. And definetly get your own bowl of the cacio e pepe. Pasta for days. Yum. The chef's menu sounded awesome. They don't normally do this on a Sunday but if you ask, the chef will generally accommodate.",4.0
"This restaurant is a really great place to host a quiet and intimate dinner. We came here for a friend's wedding and had an awesome time. The food wad delicious. We had a meat and cheese platter as an appetizer and pasta, fish, and steak for dinner. The white chocolate mousse pudding for dessert was awesome! I think the service was the best part. The bartenders, staff, and manager are really cool and friendly. I would definitely come back here. They are open 2 nights a week as a bar and have dinner Friday and Saturday nights. Worth the trip to Brooklyn.",5.0
"First off the atmosphere is absolutely beautiful.  You immediately forget you are in an industrial neighborhood.The service was unreal for Bushwick. Seated immediately, beautiful wine list, fast good service. I've never heard of a few things on the menu so naturally we tried those. I believe this is one of those places where no matter what you pick you won't be disappointed. We started with the rosemary sea salt Farinata. I had no idea what a Fairnata was but its now a favorite thing to eat. Served in a skillet hot, tasty, fresh. Seriously, it was delicious. I had the steak which was cooked like a steak should be. The veggies were fresh crisp tasty. Orechiette   was devine. Simple great taste. Finished with the strawberry rhubarb. Can't wait to go back.",5.0
"Very cool place.  The food was amazing and very reasonably priced (~$50 for a very filling 5 course tasting menu).  I especially liked the deep retro Brazilian soundtrack (not your usually greatest hits of Bossa Nova), which I'm guessing was curated by the Brazilian chef.  The location might seem a bit ""out there"" to some folks, but it's really quite easy to get to: we drove and found parking on the block no problem, but it's only a few blocks from the L/G stop.  Personal favorites: albacore crudo with basil foam, cacio e pepe.This would be a great place for a high quality group dinner: there is sufficient space for a medium-large group, the quality is high, and the prices are very good.  Will definitely be back.",5.0
Only stopped by for some cocktails.  Great selection of wines and crafted cocktails.  Beautiful interior.  We stayed in the side alley outside.  It's a bit less romantic than the inside due to air conditioner drips from above windows.  But we did enjoy the opportunity to sit outdoors and catch the sunset.  Will be back to try the food!,4.0
"Love trying new places and this was one of them. Tucked away in an office building in bushwick is an amazing place with great food. They have a cool outdoor courtyard for big groups. Their menu had just changed and we tried the anchovy crostini, basil pesto trofie and shared the chuleta grande. The crostini was a balanced mix of buttery and salty goodness! The trofie pasta was just the right amount of pesto done to al dente heaven. The chuleta grande for two was absolutely amazing. An amazing bone in pork rib cut grilled to perfection with fried garlic and lime bits  that gave it that extra je NE sais quois!  Service was on point. See you soon fitzy!!!",4.0
"Found this little gem of a spot in nowheresville Bushwick after attending a small art opening across the street. They have beautiful giant windows at the front, looks like the space was maybe an old factory once.Getting in is a bit odd, there's no door off the street to the restaurant, you have to go into this weird apparently semi-vacant building and go through unmarked doors to the right. It's hard to tell if you're using the right door, and if it weren't for the massive picture windows out front you wouldn't know it was there.In any event, it's a great intimate space. We only had cocktails, which are average Manhattan prices, about $12- $15/each, but expertly crafted. They have a nice by the glass wine selection, not too large, but given the menu it seems pretty good for their food options. The bartenders are friendly without being overbearing which is a great thing to have.Overall, we really liked the space. Not sure we'd make the trek all the way out there again from Queens, but if we lived closer I'm sure we'd visit more often. It's a nice out of the way spot that has a great intimate, quiet vibe. Not always easy to find in NY.",4.0
"Simply fantastic. We got there for a nice early dinner, around 5:30, and it was basically empty - which I love!

The cocktails were equally good, and they have an excellent wine and beer selection with helpful staff. There's a really cute little outdoor area to sit and eat/drink, too, if the weather is nice.

We had brunch there last Sunday and recently followed it up with dinner and there staff couldn't have been sweeter.

"The restaurant is located on a desolate stretch of Morgan Avenue but it's well worth the trek in every way. The space is small and quaint and has the typical dark wood low-light, Brooklyn feel. There is a small bar and probably around 15 to 20 seats in the restaurant. The menu is even smaller, but if you go just plan on getting the awesome pre-fixe. The staff were especially accommodating and one in particular, named Carissa, made sure we were taken care of the whole time.  First we tried some kind of amazing anchovy cheese bread. I'm normally not anchovy person at all but this was really tasty. Then we had a ridiculously awesome risotto with a chickpea cheese pizza bread type thing. The description does not do it justice, you just need to try it. In my two friends' minds, the star of the night was the raw scallop with smoked peppers, olive oil and lemon. Next we had a braised rabbit pasta dish which was creamy and delicious. That was followed by a seafood pasta dish that was delish as well. We ended the night with a chocolate mousse and something called Foccatta. I'm not sure what it was but I'd go back just for this desert. Even though there's not a lot close by this place, it definitely deserves a shot by any discerning foodie.",5.0

"I have to confess that I was partially drawn to ""Fitzcarraldo"" as a fan of German film giant Werner Herzog and his 1982 production of the same name. And perhaps like the eponymous film, Fitzcarraldo the restaurant represents a powerful vision of defiance, to set up shop where warehouses and factories are abundant and still functional, pioneers in a land ripe for development. Settling and thriving in his section of industrial Williamsburg may be as bold an idea as moving a steamboat over a hill in pursuit of rubber.The search for Fitzcarraldo had us exploring the concrete jungle turned frozen tundra thanks to the well packed and unshoveled snow of the nearby sidewalks. Having parked a block away, we made it to Morgan and saw no sign of this establishment until I spotted a spray-painted sign with an arrow. (In retrospect, if you are approaching from south of 195 Morgan you'll see a much better and clearer sign)But where would this arrow lead? Through an alleyway to the back of a building with two doors, one that read 3rd Ward, site of the former arts center. You'll want to choose the door on the left, past the curtains and greeted by high windows and an elevated view of the avenue. (The same height as a steamboat?)Enter Fitzcarraldo, a space that immediately welcomes, rich in wood, open and airy, with plants nestled atop the windows defying the harshness of winter.There are five choices for brunch, including yogurt, savory chickpea pancake, soft scrambled eggs, french toast and a country breakfast. Prices range from $6 to $11.The country breakfast was the kind of dish that has me trying my best to eliminate every last morsel on the plate. Two fried eggs, once punctured, sensually oozed out onto the plate, meeting up with the spicy potatoes and reaching the barrier of thick country bread. All three elements joined together, my fork breaking off a piece of spicy potato to dip into the runny yolk, with a morsel of bread serving as a base. Did I mention that resting atop the bread was salumi, several slices of salami vastly superior to the typical sausage link or bacon?Here was a breakfast plate that tasted homemade, made with love and artfully crafted for friends and family. Modest in size yet bold in flavor, this country breakfast should issue passports so full citizenship is within reach.My wife's french toast was equally delicious as I stole a few bites. Once again, the use of a sturdy, hearty bread makes all the difference. For about $12 per person, inclusive of warm beverage, we had a brunch that exceeded in all categories and only reinforced my opinion that other establishments are tired, pedestrian and flatly too expensive for average quality eats. Fitzcarraldo is a triumph, one that I hope people discover and visit as often as possible.Now if only they played some Caruso...",5.0

We started with the anchovie crostini, it was a bit small but it was really good, worth trying. i had the pesto trufie and it was good as well, nothing super amazing, but a very solid pasta dish cooked perfectly and beautifully seasoned.

"Ok, first this is a 3 star review, this means some things went well. And actually quite important things: the chef is doing a really good job at cooking. Foodwise, all things were globally very good, subtle, delicate. We had the prix fix. We had burata, raw scallops, tuna, sea bass and a rice desert. The wine was also really interesting. Kudos for that.Now the things why only 3 stars:1st of, there is something about italian food that is very important when you want to do it right: it has to be fulfilling your stomach. I can say that as a good half of my family was raised there. And I don't mean it has to be to the extreme of loving grand mothers who are literally killing you with food OD. But it is clear that italian food, to be right, needs to at the very least give you this feeling that you don't need anything else in your stomach... and truth to be said, we went for a last byte somewhere else after Fitzcaraldo. Please add more side pasta or rizotto, or just go a bit crazy with Focacia, or may be bring some Cantuci...2nd thing is, and this is very personal, about the soundtrack. In case you are allergic to post 70s reggae inspired music, you might want to be careful. We had 2 hours of a soundtrack that was really not our taste... and it did not help to make us happy (though it did make us laugh at some points... and god knows that we love many things, but focusing on this 90s reggae was not to please us...). If you don't want to piss some customers, either introduce more diversity or chose for things which are more likely to please a broad spectrum of customers.3rd thing and this is not at all to blame any one during the service. The outdoor which is actually looking and feeling great at first is also apparently the basecamp of a very tenacious mosquito tribe. My unkles and caff muscles will remember this for a few weeks... no idea if it is because of the proximity of the Newton creek water but this was tough. Honestly not helping to be totally happy about the experience.I surely will go back, may be in the inside, and not taking the prix fixe...",3.0

We only had a cheese plate and cocktails so I can't speak to the full menu, but the service was incredibly warm and welcoming.

"New York City is ever transforming itself. The latest hot area comprises  comprises Bushwick and the highly industrialized area around Morgan Avenue. We were invited to an art opening in that area. The artist recommended this restaurant very close by to the gallery. At one time I represented most of these businesses around Morgan Avenue and was I surprised to find that now there are a number of art galleries, studios, restaurants, and young people moving there. Now onto this restaurant. It is hidden away on Morgan Avenue. The atmosphere  is fine and what one would expect. I asked the manager where does he get his customers and he told me people come from Manhattan and surrounding areas.Well - you have to be crazy to come here from Manhattan and if I was from the surrounding areas I'd find another restaurant.It has an extremely limited menu. My starter - Salumi  was good. The faro and  bibb  salads-  bad/Trofie  with pesto sauce was to Ala Dente  and the sauce was strange and too sweet. Seared scallops- overdone(I  Specifically asked them not to be overcome) and the accompanied lentils, cauliflower and pickled raisins were very strange. The Orechiette   were just okay. We did not stay for the  desert and were happy to leave.Alas - all was not lost on the way home I stopped at Katz's delicatessen on Houston Street for a fabulous hot dog.",2.0

I can say that as a good half of my family was raised there. And I don't mean it has to be to the extreme of loving grand mothers who are literally killing you with food OD. But it is clear that italian food, to be right, needs to at the very least give you this feeling that you don't need anything else in your stomach... and truth to be said, we went for a last byte somewhere else after Fitzcaraldo. Please add more side pasta or rizotto, or just go a bit crazy with Focacia, or may be bring some Cantuci...2nd thing is, and this is very personal, about the soundtrack. In case you are allergic to post 70s reggae inspired music, you might want to be careful. We had 2 hours of a soundtrack that was really not our taste... and it did not help to make us happy (though it did make us laugh at some points... and god knows that we love many things, but focusing on this 90s reggae was not to please us...). If you don't want to piss some customers, either introduce more diversity or chose for things which are more likely to please a broad spectrum of customers.3rd thing and this is not at all to blame any one during the service. The outdoor which is actually looking and feeling great at first is also apparently the basecamp of a very tenacious mosquito tribe. My unkles and caff muscles will remember this for a few weeks... no idea if it is because of the proximity of the Newton creek water but this was tough. Honestly not helping to be totally happy about the experience.I surely will go back, may be in the inside, and not taking the prix fixe...",3.0
"Seriously lovely gem tucked in the relative wilderness of industrial Bushwick. We only had a cheese plate and cocktails so I can't speak to the full menu, but the service was incredibly warm and welcoming. We sat at the bar facing the kitchen, and the chefs chatted to us a bit about the offerings. Nice enough to take your parents when they're visiting, but reasonable enough for a date night dinner anytime.",4.0
"New York City is ever transforming itself. The latest hot area comprises  comprises Bushwick and the highly industrialized area around Morgan Avenue. We were invited to an art opening in that area. The artist recommended this restaurant very close by to the gallery. At one time I represented most of these businesses around Morgan Avenue and was I surprised to find that now there are a number of art galleries, studios, restaurants, and young people moving there. Now onto this restaurant. It is hidden away on Morgan Avenue. The atmosphere  is fine and what one would expect. I asked the manager where does he get his customers and he told me people come from Manhattan and surrounding areas.Well - you have to be crazy to come here from Manhattan and if I was from the surrounding areas I'd find another restaurant.It has an extremely limited menu. My starter - Salumi  was good. The faro and  bibb  salads-  bad/Trofie  with pesto sauce was to Ala Dente  and the sauce was strange and too sweet. Seared scallops- overdone(I  Specifically asked them not to be overcome) and the accompanied lentils, cauliflower and pickled raisins were very strange. The Orechiette   were just okay. We did not stay for the  desert and were happy to leave.Alas - all was not lost on the way home I stopped at Katz's delicatessen on Houston Street for a fabulous hot dog.",2.0
"This is one of my favorite spots in all five boroughs. The relaxed but civil environment, open kitchen, rotating menu, quality of ingredients, friendliness of the very Brooklyn waitstaff, and--of course--flavor of the food all combine to make this a great spot for a casual dinner or date night. The price for the quality also cannot be beat. Definitely deserves one Michelin star at least--it's actually better than some two star restaurants I've been to.",5.0
Went here on my last trip to Brooklyn. The inside and patio of the place was really well done. Kind of hard to find as there was really no sign outside. The food was well done and tasty although it took quite a while to get to the table. Considering there was only two tables I found that a bit odd but not a huge deal. Beers and drink options were very good too. I would definitely recommend checking this out if you are in the area.,4.0
"Great addition to the neighborhood. Beautiful space, good food and great value. We'll be back.",4.0
"I just had such a nice brunch here. It's like walking into old world Europe . It's a quiet, relaxed, gourmet by your boot straps kind of place. A lot of Bushwick is overwrought with it desire to be over sophisticated against the stark contest of the industrial landscape. But this place is crusty bread, simple service, chalk menus and quiet reality. Good job guys.",5.0
"Great location on a desolate stretch of Morgan Av. Take the walk or get a car its worth it. One of the best restos in the neighborhood and fantastic value unlike some other spots nearby. Brunch, dinner, drinks, come alone, on a date or with friends. The interior is beautiful and the food just keeps getting better. Prices are very reasonable. Cocktails are delicious. Food is very good.",5.0
"I really wanted to like it more. The room is lovely, the music was good and so was the wine.  We got the tasting menu for the three of us but it was weird. We never got three plates. It was either portioned as two or one but we were charged for three people.  The food was good but not outstanding. I'll try brunch next time.",3.0
"After coming here 5-7 times for brunch and dinner, trying most of the menu, I honestly cannot say enough positive things about Fitzcarraldo. Though the menu is smaller than most, the attention paid to each dish is outstanding and never disappoints. The food is always delicious and more than reasonably priced, the drinks are strong and the wines selection well matched to the food, and the service/staff are truly exceptional.I cannot recommend Fitz, as I've come to call it, highly enough.",5.0
"I celebrated an anniversary here and it was great! We shared the farinata with tomato sauce, pesto, and pecorino. This was SO GOOD: I could have eaten two orders myself. The chickpea pancake was soft and the edges were crispy. The pesto was fresh and the pecorino was excellent quality. For my entree, I had the roasted lamb with farik (greenwheat freekeh), yogurt sauce, and radishes. My farik had just the right bite to it and was pleasantly nutty tasting. It was a great accompaniment to the beautifully seasoned and tender lamb. A yogurt sauce and some parsley added brightness to what could've been a heavy meal. My boyfriend had the bar steak with parsnips, pickled onions, and salsa verde. His steak was cooked and seasoned perfectly. He ate all the vegetables before I could try them, so I am pretty sure they were excellent. The food is soulful and comforting; I felt like I was in someone's home. The decor was charming, and I love the wood barrel ceiling. The music was great too. I'm used to larger plates, but I think Fitzcarraldo serves portions that we should be eating. Highly recommended!",5.0
"I told my boyfriend there was nowhere new to eat nearby [the Jefferson stop] and he said that there have to be some hidden gems off Montrose and he was right!! we had a window seat overlooking the industrial landscape of Morgan Ave, a charming juxtaposition.You won't have to worry about a wait on a Saturday night (at least for a while) and the service is thoughtful and gracious.I love the way the cocktail menu is organized by type (sour, bubbly, etc) and the Greenpoint was a nice complement to the apps. I do think it would be fair to disclose on the chalkboard menu that the beers on draft aren't full pints.We ordered from the a la carte menu, and had the farinata and pecorino romano to start. So much cheese value! Normally you get the tiniest of slabs but theirs was abundant. The farinata was great but perhaps it was unwise pairing it with the salty cheese since it was topped by anchovies. My boyfriend was ""lulled into a butter coma"" with the cheese orchiette, also made with the best cooked pasta we've had in a while. I got the peekytoe crab salad with egg... it was immaculate, but I wish the menu had been a bit broader since crab isn't really my jam (please add one more entree under $20)!.The space has gorgeous tiled floors and a unique take on the exposed wood motif. Really, my only complaint is the limited menu, which can pose problems to near vegetarians like us. I'm sure it changes often since it is so small and seasonal, so I'll just wait another month before our next try...or maybe we'll do brunch.",4.0

"Went last night for the first time to Fitzcarraldo, I knew it would be a good experience having always enjoyed the food at Rucola; but their newest restaurant went above and beyond my expectations.Ambience- relaxing, comfortable, well designed without being over designed Service- impeccable, the server was friendly and nice without being too pushy or chatty Food-outstandingWe had a little bit of everything to share between the group.   With delicious and fresh ingredients the simplicity of the food was really able to come through.  Perfectly seasoned dishes and great portions  to share between people made our dinging experience, dare I say, PHENOMENAL.  I'm usually pretty picky having worked for years in the restaurant industry, but honestly, can't think of one bad thing to say.  I mean, it's off the beaten path, but the walk back to the train was great and helped me digest the heavenly meal :)oh, and you MUST try the Panzanella",5.0

"Wow! Dinner at Fitzcarraldo last Saturday night. Could it be any cuter or more charming? We had the chef's tasting menu and each course was totally perfect. The chicken livers over polenta were especially memorable, as well as the beautiful carpaccio with fried capers. And the wine pairings were perfect. The bartender, Gaba is so sweet and knowledgeable. The chef, Vinnie came out personally to deliver the dishes several times. It's an open kitchen so you can interact with the chefs, which is fun. I would make it my regular spot if I lived in Bushwick. The combination of intimacy and an innovative, market-based menu is so unique.",5.0
