"One of our favorite new steakhouses took their ribeye off their menu causing me to scramble, do some research and fill our ribeye and red meat void.We found it in spades at St Anselm. Our new go to spot for red meat. Hands down the best steak we have eaten in the past two years. We have made four visits since we discovered the place and everything was the same quality each time from the starters to grand finally ribeye. Excellent!Be warned because some people won't go to hipster neighborhoods. This place doesn't get any hipster. We were the only people on our four visits to actually have been from Brooklyn. The place is nothing fancy. No suits and ties in a five mile radius. Just cool hip people cranking out the BEST ribeye ever!!! Very friendly and knowledgeable staff explained the care and resting process of the meat. Which may or may not be the reason for the deliciousness I don't know I'm no cook, I make reservations. If you can get past the plaid shirts with suspenders and moo moo dresses crowd I promise you one of the best ribeyes.  And like anyplace that is great at something your going to wait for a table or our favorite place here a seat at the bar so you can watch your steak from start to finish. Must get the pan fried mashed potatoes. The scallions and the Piedmontese Axe Handle Rib Eye (for Two)If your brave like we were one visit get the hanger steak as an appetizer. Looking forward to my next check in.",5.0
"St. Anselm is perfect for your dining needs, but be warned: Sides aren't included with proteins, which means the bill adds up fast. But the food is perfection.Service was slow, even though we were the first people to place our orders shortly after the restaurant opened at 5 p.m., but it was worth the wait. We got our food around 5:47. Also, the wait for a table can be long, so it's best to get here early. They were packed by 6 p.m. I recommend the following:-Hanger steak (very good and not tough)-Grilled cauliflower w/balsamic (I never knew cauliflower could be so divine)-Pan-fried mashed potatoes (very full garlic-rosemary flavor; delicious)-Rum sticky toffee cake with ice cream (so good it will make you want to slap your mama) -Fingerling potatoes (a bit too firm; a fine side dish, but it didn't wow me)The decor is warm and inviting. The server was fine. She didn't come over much, even when few people were there, but she was polite.This is a great date spot. And even though this is a steakhouse, a vegetarian can find excellent sides here, but be sure to tell the server that you're a vegetarian because some sides are made with lard.",5.0
"excellent steakhouse with a nice vibe, friendly service, and super tasty food. that being said, the downsides here are the long waits (no reservations and unless you get a table right when they open the waits can be hours) and the space is very small so the tables can feel cramped and sometime very hot without a lot of air circulation.",4.0
"This is the type of bucket list restaurant. Where you need to go at least once but not necessarily visit again. Almost everything is artfully grilled. Wait times can be a long time but luckily there are bars around to kill time. If not, go you the Milk bar and grab a coffee. We started with the clams and they were great. Garlic oil and lemon. Simple but delicious. The sardines were a little underwhelming. The grilled artichoke with aioli were really good. The butcher steak was good and given the cut of meat, they managed to make it incredibly tender like a filet. However, the char on the outside was a bit strong. The coconut cream cake with toasted coconut was excellent. Oddly, my favorite part of the meal.",4.0
"St. Anselm seriously rocks. If it was located in my neighborhood, I'd easily eat there at least once a week. Since they don't take reservations, we knew we'd be in for a wait, but it was well worth it. We put our name down and ended up roaming around Billyburg for about an hour before they called us.The restaurant is small, but mighty, and they're known for meat, so I was basically in heaven. It's cool that you can order cuts by the ounce, which makes for reasonable sharing. On the menu:grilled halloumifresh sardinesbutcher's steak (steal of a deal for $19.50)lamb saddle (~16oz)whole mackerelspinach gratinpan-fried mashed potatoesgrilled cauliflowerchocolate pot de cremeBoth the steak and saddle were cooked a perfect medium rare, and the sides really rounded out our meal. It was sort of a ridiculous amount of food, but we managed to polish it all off. A+ for us.Exposed brick, dim lights, amazing food and service, and one really awkward table partially in a nook (ours) made for a spectacular dinner.",5.0
"This place is so hyped so I had high expectations. The wait for two was 35- 45 minutes (but actually an hour) so I had high expectations. They were not met. Burrata - had better. Also had worse. But definitely had better. Fried mashed potatoes - tasted like the fake boxed kind. I'm guessing the truffle oil is to mask that?Mushrooms - honestly, I was most excited for these because mushrooms are my most favorite. Unfortunately, these were salted beyond recognition. Veal with chimichurri - actually super great and a surprisingly generous portion. Bar steak - also very good, but slightly smaller portion and pre-cut (I am capable of using a knife). The meats were fine, but everything else disappointed. I'd probably give 3 stars if it weren't for the hype and wait. I definitely won't return.",2.0
"This place never dissapoints. The tomahawk melts in your mouth and I'd highly recommend the potato pancake.  The only downside to this place is the difficulty in getting a table since they don't take reservations, but I appreciate them wanting to keep it a local place.  My only beef is that for us locals, we can't get a table!",5.0
"Long wait for a table but we'll worth it. Pop your name on the list, head nearby for a drink then come back.We got a spot by the bar which is my favourite. Service was great. We ordered the hanger steak, NY strip steak and the following sides: radishes, spinach, cauliflower. Highly recommend the hanger steak and the spinach and cauliflower dishesCan't wait to come back?!!",5.0
"Ambience is super upscale. Cool wood ceilings. Awesome brick walls. Chill staff. Dope open kitchen for watching the chefs in action. Most importantly, the food was amazing! Medium-rare *Butchers Steak* ($19.50) was to die for. Crazy juicy and crazy flavorful, I loved it. The *Grilled Cauliflower* ($9.50), *Grilled Berkshire Bacon* ($9), and the *Pan-Fried Mashed Potatoes* ($9.50) are must-get side dishes! Can't wait to try the 45+ oz. Axe Handle Rib Eye~",5.0
"Had brunch at St. Anselm in early January 2016. The spot is very interestingly decorated. The staff was helpful. The food was stellar. Everyone loved what they ordered. Structured steakhouse style - order protein and sides separately. I ordered chicken, which was absolutely amazing and looked really cool. Excited to go back.",4.0
"We were worried about the long wait, but were only quoted a 15 minute wait around 7pm on a Tuesday. While we waited to get texted for an opening, we got drinks right next door at Spuyten Duyvil. In fact, the two places share a back patio, so we ordered drinks and carried them from the back entrance when a spot opened up. Seats at the bar aren't too cramped--you certainly don't need to be seated at a table to order a few plates. It's a casual dining space, but the details on the ceiling and bar area exude 'Brooklyn cool.' Servers are friendly and easy to converse with. But the food, right?We ordered three appetizers and a main dish each. The tomato and burrata (is there a finer combination?) was solid, and the three eggplant dish was delicious: Thai, Japanese, and Italian eggplant pieces were served with a sweet balsamic glaze and fried goat cheese. I only wish there were more slices of each eggplant. The Thai eggplant had the best combination of earthiness and sweetness, but there was only one very small slice on the plate. The pan fried mashed potatoes had a crust on the top, but was a creamy, truffle-y mash on the bottom. The Butcher's Steak was a tad salty, but was a fantastic deal for $15. It was a sizable amount that was heavy on the garlic, rich, and tender. It had a nice char, and was very easy to gobble up. I was also surprised with my pork chop. Brined in bourbon, the outside had a very thin crispy layer and a soft center. I appreciated the fact that St. Anselm served simple food with a great deal of technique and care--I'd take that over any foo foo foam place any day.

My friend and I made a valiant effort, but could not take down the beast of a steak. We probably didn't need the sides or apps (get the shisito peppers and the octopus), but once you are being ridiculous you may as well just keep going.

"One star off because, as many reviews have mentioned, they are extremely heavy handed with the salt. Not just on the meat, but everything. The chef is either a smoker or REALLY likes salt. If you don't typically like salt, I do not recommend this place. My husband enjoys salty food and he even commented on it. (It was just short of the line of being unpalatable for me) I would recommend wine a good wine pairing to level it out (maybe that's their intention). Aside from the above, everything was great. Their pricing ranges also, so you can find something reasonable for most budgets. Butchers cut was delicious with a side of mashed potatoes and green beans. The potatoes came ""pancake"" style hot with a perfectly crunchy grilled crust. I highly recommend the toffee rum cake--- so good! Additionally they have an amazing wine selection!",4.0
"With everything in life, the golden rule rings true. Treat people the way you wish to be treated. Especially in the hospitality industry. And if you have no finesse in it, you are in the wrong business. Good food can turn ugly when the wrong person is careless and rude for no reason.I took good friends of mine that are in the food business here based on the reviews. I was the first to arrive and was told that I could wait right where I stood or go next door to their bar and wait since they do not seat incomplete parties. Fair enough. I went next door for a glass of wine and last time I checked, a proper pour ends where the wine glass starts to round. My pour was below but no big deal. Then it just got worse. My friends arrive and we are a party of three now at about 6:15 pm. We go back to get a table and were told that it would be a 30 mins wait and would we like to eat at the bar instead? We're hungry so yes we are sat at the empty bar where there are about 10-12 empty seats at the bar. Then we notice the table directly behind us about 3 feet away were paying their check. We politely asked if we could move to that table being that we hadn't ordered anything yet, had not been approached for service at all. A friendly guy with light colored hair says yes! No problem! After all, clearing a table with a couple glasses on it should take no more than a few minutes. No big deal right?The same lady with dark colored short hair that originally greeted me then comes to us and says that if we would like to sit at that table we would have to go up to the front and wait or go next door...There's no one waiting for the bar tables at all. If someone wanted to sit right where we were of course we would move...But we could have waited right where we were for a few minutes and sat down to enjoy what we were hoping would be a great experience.Instead the discourteous and unrefined woman made something so simple and easy into an unfortunate episode. After we went to the front to stand, she comes and says to get out of her way as we're not in a good spot. No kidding? The spot we were at before was just fine but she moved us. Her voice just got louder and louder telling us we need to move and hands start to fly. My friend in disbelief throws his hands up in the air flustered and she yells ""get your hands out of my face!"" Whoa. We should have asked to speak to a manager but felt so badly treated and horrible energy, we couldn't wait to get out of there.Poor attitude. Unfortunate representation. She had no idea or savvy in the art of hospitality. What a shameful experience. Maybe something personal led her to act this way, but not professional in the least bit. So disappointed.",1.0
"Saw an article on eater giving this place a great review and made the trek out to Williamsburg to try it. We got there a little after nine on a rainy sat and was told it would be a 1-1.5 hr wait for a table for two. Since we already made it out there we figured we'd wait it out for some good steak.  we ended up getting the butcher steak, the NY strip steak (both medium rare), iceberg lettuce salad, grilled cauliflower and two glasses of red wine. I have to say the butcher steak was pretty decent (well seasoned, overall pretty tender) for $18.50 but was definitely on the small side. The NY strip was no good, didn't have the flavor of aged beef, lots of gristle, not charred enough on the outside and really really lean. The pour on the wine was stingy for $12-$15 a glass and the cauliflower was a little undercooked ( though I liked the tangy flavor). Overall I would've given a 4 star if I only got the butcher steak but the NY strip steak really brought the rating down.",3.0
"Went here expecting a wait (even midweek) so I stopped in and put my name down. Got a text about a half hour later. Worked out good since my girl and I got a beer next door while we waited. We were seated all the way in the back away from everyone else and I thought it was the best spot in there. Secluded and right next to the radiator on a freezing night. Customer service was awesome. Host was very sweet and our waiter was very professional and friendly. We had the hangar steak, which was good but a little tough. We had the clams and artichoke which were delicious, but were tiny portions for the prices. And then shared the mashed potatoes and spinach gratin which were so good and good portions for a couple to split. This place was worth the wait, but I won't be a frequent flyer here bc it's an expensive night.  In my opinion, if you want a good night out with your significant other and you're in north BK, you should check this spot out, but definitely go ahead of time and put your name down on their wait list.",4.0
"First off: this place does NOT do reservations. Secondly, Yummy yum yum. Boyfriend and I came on a Friday night around 7pm. We were told we had to wait 30mins to an hour for seating at the bar and 2-3 hours for a table. Funny thing is that we saw two tables open. Around 7:40 or so we were seated and still saw those two tables open. There is no possible way that people could have been in and out in only 40 minutes. The music was sort of blaring, it was quite difficult to speak. Lighting was dark, sort of romantic (only because they placed a small candle next to the water). When we ordered we were told it would take a good 30-40 mins. My boyfriend was surprised when they didn't have a section for appetizers. Anyways, we ordered the steaks for 17 each. He got it rare and I, medium rare. We also got the spinach gratin and the fried mashed potatoes. Wonderful. The spinach gratin could have a bit more taste to it but it paired deliciously with our steak. The only thing that was irritating was the music. Was a bit too loud for our taste but the steak was amazing. Maybe it's also because I haven't had a steak since May. But it was worth the wait!",4.0
"Nice spot! We had heard from friends that this was worth checking out, and put our names on the list for what turned out to be a 2 hour wait around 7:00 (this was on a Saturday, for what it's worth). We both got the $19.50 hanger steak, which got better and better the more I had of it. It definitely wasn't a porterhouse, but it had a nice char, was actually cooked rare as ordered, and had great seasoning throughout. We also had the eggplant (the friend goat cheese was incredible!), the mashed potatoes (kind of forgettable), and one of the specials, which was a pesto-laden flatbread. All were executed reasonably well, and when combined with thorough (and not pretentious) service, made for a great time out.",4.0
"Let me start by saying the reason this place is getting one star is not because the food was terrible.  My girlfriend and I actually thought the food was GREAT and was not upset until we recieved the bill. And let me tell you why...We came in at about 10pm. My girlfriend and I go out for steak quite often. It is one of our favorite dinner dates, so we knew we had to try this place that people rave about in Williamsburg. We always order the Ribeye for 2. When we sat down, we asked for that, and the waitress says, ""unfortunately we only have our bigger cuts left about 60oz(bone about 10oz-14oz)"", that we usually do for 4 people. Of course we say, ""that fine.""We can always take leftovers home. No big deal!Food comes, look great. They sit the steak down and walk away. And immediately my girlfriend and I look at each other like oh...LOOKS LIKE THEY MIGHT OF FOUND A SMALLER CUT, PERFECT! I can tell you it looked like it was like about 30oz MAX (with the bone). Im being seriously generous. I know you lose about 25% with cook loss. NO WAY THIS WAS FOR FOUR PEOPLE. We ate the WHOLE THING. Not even stuffed or anything.We ask for the bill. Before it even came back. I lean over to my girlfriend, and say, ""watch these ass holes try to bill us for a 60oz steak."" AND SURE ENOUGH...bill comes the steak ALONE was $156.60(total was $200). Unlike most places they weight the steak and charge $2.70/lb, instead of a set price. Which is actually good business sense. I couldn't stop laughing. Of course we paid , left a 20% tip, and didn't complain. We just aren't those kind of people and what would really been resolved. BUT WE WILL PROBABLY NEVER GO BACK! Just wasn't worth the money and they played us. Just to give you reference, we tried Wolfgang's like 2 weeks before, and got the roughly the same size steak(the alledged 58oz-60oz) for $100....AND we both had enough for lunch the next day! Nice try St. Anslem. You lost a potential faithful customer. We'll stick to Peter Lugers.",1.0
"Sadly, does not live up to the hype. Steak was over salted and nothing to write home about. Mashed potatoes and clams were awesome but I'd really have liked to leave this place excited about the meats. Wait staff was very good and the place has a great relaxed vibe. Maybe I was just expecting too much from the steak?",3.0
Always wanted to go here and finally went the other night. Was extremely pleased with the quality of the food and it most certainly lived up to hype.I would definitely go again. I would advise going into the night knowing that there would be a wait so plan on checking in and either going to the sister bar next door or go bar hop around the neighborhood.,5.0
I was in the area for work and googled great places to eat. This place popped up and I decided to give it a try. I am so happy that I did!  Now I just need to find more reasons to be in the area lol.The Salmon was just the best! And the side of pea greens with Halloumi  cheese were perfect!,5.0
"One star off because, as many reviews have mentioned, they are extremely heavy handed with the salt. Not just on the meat, but everything. The chef is either a smoker or REALLY likes salt. If you don't typically like salt, I do not recommend this place. My husband enjoys salty food and he even commented on it. (It was just short of the line of being unpalatable for me) I would recommend wine a good wine pairing to level it out (maybe that's their intention). Aside from the above, everything was great. Their pricing ranges also, so you can find something reasonable for most budgets. Butchers cut was delicious with a side of mashed potatoes and green beans. The potatoes came ""pancake"" style hot with a perfectly crunchy grilled crust. I highly recommend the toffee rum cake--- so good! Additionally they have an amazing wine selection!",4.0
"With everything in life, the golden rule rings true. Treat people the way you wish to be treated. Especially in the hospitality industry. And if you have no finesse in it, you are in the wrong business. Good food can turn ugly when the wrong person is careless and rude for no reason.I took good friends of mine that are in the food business here based on the reviews. I was the first to arrive and was told that I could wait right where I stood or go next door to their bar and wait since they do not seat incomplete parties. Fair enough. I went next door for a glass of wine and last time I checked, a proper pour ends where the wine glass starts to round. My pour was below but no big deal. Then it just got worse. My friends arrive and we are a party of three now at about 6:15 pm. We go back to get a table and were told that it would be a 30 mins wait and would we like to eat at the bar instead? We're hungry so yes we are sat at the empty bar where there are about 10-12 empty seats at the bar. Then we notice the table directly behind us about 3 feet away were paying their check. We politely asked if we could move to that table being that we hadn't ordered anything yet, had not been approached for service at all. A friendly guy with light colored hair says yes! No problem! After all, clearing a table with a couple glasses on it should take no more than a few minutes. No big deal right?The same lady with dark colored short hair that originally greeted me then comes to us and says that if we would like to sit at that table we would have to go up to the front and wait or go next door...There's no one waiting for the bar tables at all. If someone wanted to sit right where we were of course we would move...But we could have waited right where we were for a few minutes and sat down to enjoy what we were hoping would be a great experience.Instead the discourteous and unrefined woman made something so simple and easy into an unfortunate episode. After we went to the front to stand, she comes and says to get out of her way as we're not in a good spot. No kidding? The spot we were at before was just fine but she moved us. Her voice just got louder and louder telling us we need to move and hands start to fly. My friend in disbelief throws his hands up in the air flustered and she yells ""get your hands out of my face!"" Whoa. We should have asked to speak to a manager but felt so badly treated and horrible energy, we couldn't wait to get out of there.Poor attitude. Unfortunate representation. She had no idea or savvy in the art of hospitality. What a shameful experience. Maybe something personal led her to act this way, but not professional in the least bit. So disappointed.",1.0
"Saw an article on eater giving this place a great review and made the trek out to Williamsburg to try it. We got there a little after nine on a rainy sat and was told it would be a 1-1.5 hr wait for a table for two. Since we already made it out there we figured we'd wait it out for some good steak.  we ended up getting the butcher steak, the NY strip steak (both medium rare), iceberg lettuce salad, grilled cauliflower and two glasses of red wine. I have to say the butcher steak was pretty decent (well seasoned, overall pretty tender) for $18.50 but was definitely on the small side. The NY strip was no good, didn't have the flavor of aged beef, lots of gristle, not charred enough on the outside and really really lean. The pour on the wine was stingy for $12-$15 a glass and the cauliflower was a little undercooked ( though I liked the tangy flavor). Overall I would've given a 4 star if I only got the butcher steak but the NY strip steak really brought the rating down.",3.0
"Went here expecting a wait (even midweek) so I stopped in and put my name down. Got a text about a half hour later. Worked out good since my girl and I got a beer next door while we waited. We were seated all the way in the back away from everyone else and I thought it was the best spot in there. Secluded and right next to the radiator on a freezing night. Customer service was awesome. Host was very sweet and our waiter was very professional and friendly. We had the hangar steak, which was good but a little tough. We had the clams and artichoke which were delicious, but were tiny portions for the prices. And then shared the mashed potatoes and spinach gratin which were so good and good portions for a couple to split. This place was worth the wait, but I won't be a frequent flyer here bc it's an expensive night.  In my opinion, if you want a good night out with your significant other and you're in north BK, you should check this spot out, but definitely go ahead of time and put your name down on their wait list.",4.0
"First off: this place does NOT do reservations. Secondly, Yummy yum yum. Boyfriend and I came on a Friday night around 7pm. We were told we had to wait 30mins to an hour for seating at the bar and 2-3 hours for a table. Funny thing is that we saw two tables open. Around 7:40 or so we were seated and still saw those two tables open. There is no possible way that people could have been in and out in only 40 minutes. The music was sort of blaring, it was quite difficult to speak. Lighting was dark, sort of romantic (only because they placed a small candle next to the water). When we ordered we were told it would take a good 30-40 mins. My boyfriend was surprised when they didn't have a section for appetizers. Anyways, we ordered the steaks for 17 each. He got it rare and I, medium rare. We also got the spinach gratin and the fried mashed potatoes. Wonderful. The spinach gratin could have a bit more taste to it but it paired deliciously with our steak. The only thing that was irritating was the music. Was a bit too loud for our taste but the steak was amazing. Maybe it's also because I haven't had a steak since May. But it was worth the wait!",4.0
"Nice spot! We had heard from friends that this was worth checking out, and put our names on the list for what turned out to be a 2 hour wait around 7:00 (this was on a Saturday, for what it's worth). We both got the $19.50 hanger steak, which got better and better the more I had of it. It definitely wasn't a porterhouse, but it had a nice char, was actually cooked rare as ordered, and had great seasoning throughout. We also had the eggplant (the friend goat cheese was incredible!), the mashed potatoes (kind of forgettable), and one of the specials, which was a pesto-laden flatbread. All were executed reasonably well, and when combined with thorough (and not pretentious) service, made for a great time out.",4.0
"Let me start by saying the reason this place is getting one star is not because the food was terrible.  My girlfriend and I actually thought the food was GREAT and was not upset until we recieved the bill. And let me tell you why...We came in at about 10pm. My girlfriend and I go out for steak quite often. It is one of our favorite dinner dates, so we knew we had to try this place that people rave about in Williamsburg. We always order the Ribeye for 2.

"Delicious steak and sides. What more do you want? My steak was cooked to perfection (medium rare), nice and moist .

Only downside is that they don't accept reservations so get there early!",4.0
"I've been meaning to come try out this place for the past two years but finally made it to try it this weekend. There's always a really long wait considering it's a small place that fits about 50 people, including the bar and tables. The first time I came here I had to wait more than 2 hours but this visit, I only had to wait about an hour since I went super early. I started with some appetizers and everything was going well even though I know I had to wait at least 45 minutes for my steak to grill and rest. My favorite appetizer was the grilled clams. They don't taste grilled but they were cooked with some garlic butter and served with bread. The server mentioned that they were little neck clams but they seem more like top necks. I hesitated before ordering it because I'm more of a raw clam fan but these clams were juicy and so fresh you can almost taste the sea. My steak came about 45 oz. and that's $2.70 per oz. The Ax Handle Ribeye was juicy and tender but it came out colder than I expected. It almost feels as if it was sitting at the counter for awhile before hitting my table. Although the delicious flavor made up for the temperature of the steak, I still wished it'd been near perfect considering the price I'm paying. I shared the steak with my significant other and he got full from the huge portion but it was so good I couldn't stop. I wish there was more  than 3 pieces of bacon in one order. You can never have enough bacon. One piece of my bacon wasn't grilled crispy and that was just upsetting. The fried mashed potato went really well with the steak. It's nice and crispy on the outside and soft and hot on the inside. The truffle flavor was not strong enough but it was still worthy. The shishito peppers and cauliflower was a huge disappointment. I'm sure I just had a bad batch but it tasted crunchy. It was moderately done and not the way cauliflower and shishito peppers supposed to be. I ended the meal with the salted caramel chocolate pot de creme. It was really good but could've used some more salt. At the end of the night, let's just say I wish I was drunk enough to overlook how expensive the bill was.",4.0
"Beer, wine, steak, chicken. Come for these things, ignore any other thoughts in your head like, for instance, ""this place is awfully plain looking for such expensive prices""I got the dodo bird looking chicken and the butcher steak, with spinach and Brussels sprouts.

The scallops did not impress.   For main we had the strip, the pork and the chicken.   The chicken was perfect, with a lacquer glaze outside and fall off the bone tender.  The pork also was excellent with a unique taste.

We ordered a Pinot Noir for $46 that was really delicious and ended up pairing nicely with the food. We ordered the clams special (6 clams for $7) and the burrata for our appetizers, both were simple and delicious. As it was our first time, we both got the Butcher's Steak for our mains, both medium rare, although mine came out slightly more rare than his. I ended up loving my slightly more rare cook and inhaled the steak, it was seriously SO good, a perfect portion for one person, and just unbelievably cooked. Cannot believe it's just $17.For sides we got the truffled mashed potatoes and shishito peppers, both very good as well although we preferred the mashed potatoes. For dessert we got the pot de creme that was chocolate/salted caramel flavored - delicious.The entire meal was lovely and majorly enjoyable, and made even better by the short wait time.

Wow to that 50 Oz axe handle steak. It's seriously huge! And watching them lift it up with one hand and slam it into the grill is such euphoric in its own way.

Then came the steak and potatos. A beautiful, juicy, perfectly cooked steak. My goodness it was great - and for only $15! The potatoes were amazing as well, but our waiter mentioned that the secret ingredient was lard.....so there's that. We split the blackberry sorbet for dessert - not enough room for anything else!

"Overly priced hipster joint. The food is pretty good - I got the lamb steak which was very well cooked, and the sides were tasty. However, the service is subpar (including the rude hostess), and the wines are unreasonably priced for their quality. I would go back only if the prices were half of what they actually are. I would rather recommend DeStefano for excellent meat, ambiance and outstanding service (at comparable prices).",2.0
"I wanted to bc I heard about all the hype but I was pretty disappointed. First off they don't take rezzies. So plan on waiting for an hour and a half to get in. If I have to wait that long it better be good. The food better taste like a mouth orgasm. We ordered several apps including the eggplant, scallops, and burrata. All were delicious. Not mind blowing but good. Now I know this is a steak place but I prefer seafood so I ordered the salmon. Regardless of the fact they're known for their steak their other food should be good too. Obviously. The salmon however was disgusting. It was slathered in butter and huge bones that has not been removed. There's nothing more unappealing that giant fish bones stabbing you as you eat. I couldn't even finish it because I was so grossed out.",3.0
"This is becoming one of my favorite places for dinner. White it does come with a long line, is worth the wait. I suggest heading next door for a great selection of wine, beer, and other spirits. Everything on the menu has been absolute mouth watering.",5.0
"Great dining experience. The staff is so friendly and they offer great recommendations - you can really tell that they love what they do and value their workplace.I love the open kitchen concept. I sat by the counters so I had so much fun watching the chefs prepare and plate my food.My favorite dishes1. Strip steak for $17. What a steal especially in NY. Normally, I drench my meat with steak sauce but not here - so well seasoned! (My friend mentioned that it might have a bit too salty but I have a saltier palette so I did not mind at all)2. Pan-fried mashed potatoes. A MUST!3. Creamed spinach",5.0
"Our server was so awesome!!!' She was so patient, genuine and not pretentious at all!  So down to earth....reminds me of old Willamsburg!  I wish I had her name.....I use to live in Williamsburg back in the 90's and I get to see my dear friend once a year and this place was so perfect to eat, drink and catch up!",4.0
