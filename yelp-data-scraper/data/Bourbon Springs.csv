"THIS PLACE IS DARN CUTE.Came here on a late night with my friend, it's small and intimate. The bar area could probably seat up to less than 10 people?Had a delicious lemon drink, completely forgot the name. The bartender was really friendly, giving us advice to where to head off to next.Stop by here next time if you're in the area for a bite or before a big night!",5.0
I stopped in late on a Saturday afternoon.  Place was busy but not full - I had a seat at the bar.   I had not realized that they open for brunch on weekends.  Brunch menu is Southern style - but I will have to go back - one order of shrimp and grits was enough for one day. Bartender was engaging. I chatted with the owner for a while - nice fellow - was kind enough to share comments on the spirits industry.  I had a bourbon Old Fashions which was good but not special.  Very much a local bar.  Maybe a dozen seats at the bar and several tables.  I don't recall any flat-screens. Worth a try if you are in the neighborhood.  I will go back for the brunch menu.,4.0
"I highly recommend trying Bourbon Springs if you're in the area, or even if you're not (don't worry the L's running now). BS delivered on its promise of refreshing libations and notable Southern dishes. I have zero affiliation to the South so I can't comment on the authenticity of the meals but I have had many a burger in the city and the Bourbon Burger ranks amongst the top. In terms of our dinner: - Fried Oysters: The meat was very scrumptious and hearty while the crust was still light and very flavorful. The horseradish aioli was also a great complement.  - Pickle Plate: On the smaller side with a variety of veggies including beets, turnips, cucs, carrots, brussels sprouts. - Bourbon Burger: Decadent burger overall but luckily we split it. The meat was cooked chef's preference and he did not disappoint. I always love me some carmelized onions. The garlic flavor from the chips did not really break through for me but they did provide a great texture element.  Overall, I found the staff to be considerate and attending, especially for a 930pm Saturday night dinner.",5.0
"Bourbon SpringsNY BK Williamsburg 5pm Thursday 4th February 2016Three StarsBourbon Springs is a hipster-esque bar/restaurant with white walls, pale wood furnishings, homemade pickle jars, every bitter elixir on earth. They were also batching Markers 46 with toasted Bark. It was completely empty except for myself on this early Thursday evening. I used my whiskey passport to enjoy a Taconic Whiskey on the Rocks. They serve ""vevo"" sparkling water with a $2 up-charge (stated on the menu but not by the server)I enjoyed some complimentary boiled peanuts which has a bit of slime, sweetness, and viscosity to them. They are definitely inferior the crunch of its roasted cousin. While waiting for my food, I heard a microwave beep which definitely makes me question the freshness of my meal. The Gumbo had a distinct oceanic taste. The oysters had a nice meatiness to them. The Okra made the broth thick and comforting. The shrimp as expected were thickness overcooked. The quenelle of jasmine rice was unique touch. The server was nice but seemed new.They did finish the meal with some delicious Chocolate Bourbon Balls with Pecans inside.",3.0
"I loved my meal at Bourbon Springs! My waiter was extremely attentive and helpful. I'm disappointed that I can't remember which cocktails my friend and I had, because they were both fantastic and affordable during happy hour. We were able to order a large bottle of cider for the happy hour price and save it for when we finished our first drinks, which was very accommodating! The local cider was excellent. It was nicely decorated, with succulents on each table and plenty of seating. I loved the relish plate, which we split. The crudites were fantastic, it came with some sort of marinated cauliflower, pickles, olives, celery, carrots, homemade ranch and pimento cheese, which was so good I ate it with a fork. My friend really liked the boudin balls, which were a generous portion. The roast broccoli was good, but not nearly as good as the crudites. We split the tomato sandwich as well and it was the perfect amount of food. Our waiter checked in on us many times, offering recommendations and giving us complimentary bourbon at the end! I do wish they had had the ricotta and grilled peaches while I was there, since I've heard good things. My only other recommendation would be to incorporate fried green tomatoes into the everyday menu. I liked the tomato sandwich and maybe it was just taking advantage of the last of the seasonally available fresh tomatoes, but I would have loved fried green tomatoes as well! I will absolutely be back.",5.0

"These are famously nice people and a very cool local spot. The entire place smelled like biscuits (which they gave us one for free, very very good) which I of course had no complaints about and they hooked us up with a nice little shot of bourbon for our first time there. Go check it out, have some boiled peanuts!!!!",5.0
"Went with husband and 14 yr old daughter. Picked it because our daughter loved the food, especially the crawfish, when we were in Louisiana and this place had 4.5 stars. Ordered the crawfish étouffée, gumbo, honey cajun wings, boudin balls, fried oysters and whiskey sours. Cuisine is clearly no where near authentic. The cajun honey wings, had a really strong disturbing smell and tasted just like it. There was also nothing cajun about those wings. Both the étouffée and the gumbo were a pale brown, clearly not enough time given to the base. The staff was friendly and competent. There was strange background music that added nothing to a Louisiana themed restaurant. The whisky sours were ok although they were missing some sour for my taste. Will not be returning for the crawfish boil on Sunday.",3.0
"Simply amazing.  Stopped in on what I think was the opening weekend and I was floored.The Good:Where do I start?  Seriously great food.  We ordered a small assortment of dishes including:   -- The Relish Plate (an assortment of veggies and spreads)   -- Boudin Balls (incredibly delicious balls that seemed kind of similar to arancini, but with a cajun flair)   -- Deviled Eggs (amazing presentation -- seriously gorgeous with creme fraiche, trout roe, and garden fresh dill)   -- Marinated Peaches with Ricotta (by far my favorite, marinated peaches were grilled, I think, then paired with a wonderfully creamy, rich, and seasoned ricotta cheese. I would kick a bee's nest for another plate right now!)They also had a nice mix of cocktails and drinks available at a well stocked bar.  Service was outstanding, too.  Normally you'd expect some hiccups from a new place, but they were flawless. Not only efficient, they were very personable and the chef/owner even came out to say hi.  The decor was pleasant and seating was well organized, with options to sit at the bar, at a table.The Bad:I forgot to take pictures. Ok, so it's my bad.  Not theirs.  I've got nothing else.The Ugly:When we stopped in, they didn't have a sign.  I hope they get one soon.  While I don't go into Brooklyn very often, I will definitely come back here.  Really excellent.",5.0

We got the old fashioned b/c we were in the mood for cocktails but will definitely return to sample their whiskey and bourbon flights.Food:Too many delicious appetizers to sample in one trip! We got the deviled eggs which were perfection and the ham biscuits which were fluffy and buttery with a flavorful slice of cured ham, aged cheese and a really delicious compote. We felt great about our choices but can't wait to come back and try the boudin balls and gumbo.Since we went hard on appetizers we opted for sandwiches for our mains. He got the Bourbon Burger and I got the Oyster Po'Boy. Both extremely happy with our choices. The Oyster Po'Boy in particular was one of the best I've ever had - perfectly fried with great fixings.I live near Brooklyn Star which is another great southern restaurant in the area but will be making the walk over to Bourbon Springs on the regular. They bring something very different, more New Orleans inspired to the table. I am seriously looking forward to sampling everything on the menu.",5.0
"We stopped in at this spot in Williamsburg because it's relatively new, we'd never been, and the promise of a bar that specializes in whiskey is a big draw for us.Just as we were getting seated at the bar, we were recognized by the restaurant's General Manager, Ben Zorn. We knew Ben from his stint behind the bar at Tooker Alley. He designed Bourbon Springs' cocktail program. We had the house Sazerac, The Appellate Court, The Country Club, and finally a Remember The Maine. All were very good -- we would drink them again, for sure.As for the food, we had eaten lunch only a couple hours before coming here, but we made room for a couple appetizers. The relish tray includes both pickled vegetables (brussel's sprouts, beets, etc.) and fresh root vegetables, the latter are great for dipping into the pimento cheese and spicy ranch dressing. The deviled eggs tasted of mustard and herbs, which is the way I like them. The fish roe they're topped with give a pleasant, salty finish.Overall, a great experience, made better by running into a familiar face.",5.0

"My husband and I stopped in here on a whim after a long night of holiday shopping at Toys-R-Us, and needless to say we needed a drink and then some. The atmosphere is simple and unassuming and we decided to sit at the bar. Since the place has a New Orleans flair, my husband ordered a sazerac and I ordered a maple pecan beer from a Louisiana brewery. I loved my bev as it was everything I hope for in a beer: dark, flavorful, sweet, and not bitter at all. My husband thought his sazerac was a little too sweet but still drinkable. The menu is on the small side and we both ordered sandwiches- I had the fried green tomato sandwich and my husband had the muffuletta, with a pickle plate to share. My sandwich was solid but I thought it lacked flavor, it could have used a zestier sauce or perhaps just more sauce in general. However, the pickle plate made up for it in flavor and was the best pickle plate I've ever had (and I have pickle plates every chance I get!). My husband said that his muffuletta was good, much better than other NYC versions he's had, though he thought the crust of the bread was a little too hard and crispy.The service was attentive and though a ten top had just come in we still received our food in a very timely fashion. It's definitely a place worth checking out and we'll be in for drinks again soon!",3.0

Deviled eggs were the best I've had in 13 years of living here.  People always raved about deviled eggs at spotted pig (which I didn't understand), but these are far far better: flavorful and smooth, not over seasoned or overcooked.  Egg Sardou was simply delicious, especially for an artichoke fan like me.  I wish all brunch places offer Eggs Benedict on artichoke bottoms.  Eggs were cooked perfectly runny. Banana french toast was succulent and you can't go wrong with caramel and caramelized bananas.  I would be happy to eat all these things again but will skip the coffee. Coffee wasn't strong and portion was tiny for the price.  FYI, filtered water is unlimited at $2/head, full table participation.  And how cute that they have a washlet toilet.",5.0

"So happy that really delicious innovative food is in Williamsburg/Greenpoint! And so happy I wore elastic pants to dinner at Bourbon Springs - - I ate way more than I should have, but couldn't have been happier about it. I visited 9/10/15 and there was a limited menu: small dishes and the special for the night was the hamburger. We ended up each getting a hamburger and a bunch of small plates to munch on as appetizers. You can easily get full on the small plates alone as they are all hearty portions. Here's the rundown on what we ate: *Deviled Eggs with Trout Roe - simple, but a nice touch of the roe added some nice texture and a subtle extra boost of taste*Ham Biscuits - beyond delicious. The chutney used was peach and the addition of currents really made this taste like a dessert. The biscuit ... one of the best I've tasted, even comparing that to biscuits in the south. My only regret was not placing an order of these biscuits for breakfast the next day...*Boudin Balls - I could eat these every single day. They were to die for. The mustard remoulade added a nice flavor, but I liked the balls plain on their own. *Green Tomato Sandwich - special of the night and a very fulfilling bite of goodness. Just the thing on a warm sticky night - refreshing and delicious. And then for the main: the hamburger with tobacco onions and some sort of white sauce that I forgot to ask what it was, but wow, did my world stop when I took a bite. Possibly the best hamburger I have had. The meat was delicious, the toppings were delicious, the bun was unassuming... I've been dreaming of this burger for the past week. There was no room left for dessert. Elastic will stretch only so much. Already planning the next trip back for the dessert! I did have a cocktail though and keeping with the theme of bourbon. I tried The Country Club (bourbon, egg white, burlesque bitters, sour cherry, and lemon) - - my new favorite drink. Pleasantly light without the punch bourbon likes to always give. Can't wait for the full menu to debut, but will happily return for that burger and all the small bites in the meantime. Cannot recommend this new gem enough! Enjoy!",5.0
"Finally a great new restaurant in my neighborhood!  Since living off the Graham stop the choices for restaurants have been slim pickings.  I love Mesa Coyocoan but not much else is worth going out for, Id rather cook.  In the past couple of weeks since Bourbon Springs has been open Ive already gone back 3 times. The service is excellent and the food is obviously fantastic!  I already know Ill be frequenting this spot this winter. What to eat: Ive had the burger every time, the meat is grass fed which is important to me.  The garlic chips and house made pickles add a perfect accompaniment to the meat.  I think that Diner, Reynards and Roebling Tea Room have the perfect burger but this is now one of my favorites.  It doesn't even need cheese, the herbed mayo they make is really all it needs. The fried oysters are delicious and the tomato salad with Mozzarella is also really great!  I think they are still working on the menu to see what works. Suggestions:  1. I would love to see more vegetable dishes on the menu.  2. I know a lot of people don't know about your restaurant yet and because its so dark inside I think its hard to tell you are open/ it still looks like Fanny.  I think putting candles in the front window would add a nice warmth to the spot and let people know you are new and open for business! Also, maybe a more noticeable sign outside would help.",5.0

"Fantastic! I was randomly in the neighborhood and happened upon this gem. I was looking for a quiet Sunday dinner on my way home; I got that and so much more! My experience began with a welcoming staff member inviting me to a seat of my choice. The quaint ambience and mellow music put me at ease. I was handed the unassuming, straightforward menu and informed that the special was a cream of mushroom soup. I immediately ordered the soup and considered the entrees. After discussing the Chicken Jezebel and the Hoppin' Jon, I had never heard of the latter, I selected the fried catfish. The soup was flavorful and accompanied by perfectly toasted garlic bread. I asked about their non-alcoholic beverages which included house-made and bottled soda. The Abita Rootbeer was a great compliment to the food. The tender meat of the fish had a beautifully crisp coating, was served with a tartar sauce that did not overpower the dish and was expertly paired with seared blue potatoes and a carrot salad. The carrot salad was spicy when eaten by itself but added just the right amount of heat to a bite that contained each element of the dish. I was tempted by the banana fosters dessert but thought it would be best to end with just a cup of coffee. My Louisiana-style coffee was delightfully unique and accompanied by a bourbon ball and the combination served as the perfect ending to a wonderful meal. I remained at my table for a while after I was finished eating to catch up on some writing and never felt rushed by the accommodating staff.

They came out soggy and greasy, not crispy and buttery. The ham on the biscuit was thick cut and had the texture and taste of a very very salty corned beef. The plum compote had a funny flavor that was not as sweet as I had hoped and added nothing to the sandwich. Also, the beers I ordered for myself and my guest came in two different sizes glasses; one was small and the other was smaller. I really wanted my meal to be good. Maybe they had an off lunch.The gumbo was pretty good, that's why the review is 3 stars. Nice big chunks of veggies. Waiter was very nice as well.",3.0

I had a gin gimlet and we split the deviled eggs, boudin balls, and po boy - everything was delicious. I was really impressed by the staff as well. They were super friendly and helpful. The cherry on top was that they have one of those toilet seat bidets in the bathroom. What more could a girl want!?",5.0
Great local spot.    Ive been a few times now. The drinks and wine are good.  The chicken and hanger steak are VERY good.   This is a very nice place.   I am a fan.,4.0
"Fantastic! I was randomly in the neighborhood and happened upon this gem. I was looking for a quiet Sunday dinner on my way home; I got that and so much more! My experience began with a welcoming staff member inviting me to a seat of my choice. The quaint ambience and mellow music put me at ease. I was handed the unassuming, straightforward menu and informed that the special was a cream of mushroom soup. I immediately ordered the soup and considered the entrees. After discussing the Chicken Jezebel and the Hoppin' Jon, I had never heard of the latter, I selected the fried catfish. The soup was flavorful and accompanied by perfectly toasted garlic bread. I asked about their non-alcoholic beverages which included house-made and bottled soda. The Abita Rootbeer was a great compliment to the food. The tender meat of the fish had a beautifully crisp coating, was served with a tartar sauce that did not overpower the dish and was expertly paired with seared blue potatoes and a carrot salad. The carrot salad was spicy when eaten by itself but added just the right amount of heat to a bite that contained each element of the dish. I was tempted by the banana fosters dessert but thought it would be best to end with just a cup of coffee. My Louisiana-style coffee was delightfully unique and accompanied by a bourbon ball and the combination served as the perfect ending to a wonderful meal. I remained at my table for a while after I was finished eating to catch up on some writing and never felt rushed by the accommodating staff. This restaurant gives me cause to visit this neighborhood more often. I am excited to return and try more food!",5.0
The biscuits and conversation with the owners and staff were great A++.,5.0
"Went for lunch today and was extremely disappointed. I ordered the ham biscuits because the picture looked amazing, but the anticipation of greatness dissipated after I saw the waiter place them in the microwave before serving. They came out soggy and greasy, not crispy and buttery. The ham on the biscuit was thick cut and had the texture and taste of a very very salty corned beef. The plum compote had a funny flavor that was not as sweet as I had hoped and added nothing to the sandwich. Also, the beers I ordered for myself and my guest came in two different sizes glasses; one was small and the other was smaller. I really wanted my meal to be good. Maybe they had an off lunch.The gumbo was pretty good, that's why the review is 3 stars. Nice big chunks of veggies. Waiter was very nice as well.",3.0

"I had the oyster po boy- made with 4 giant oysters. It was... pretty good, I suppose. My friends had the pulled pork- they said its hard to go wrong with pulled pork.They were out of the boudin balls, but we had some excellent chicken liver mousse for an appetizer.The cocktails were tasty, but about the same as you'd see in any other hipster bar/restaurant. If you can't tell, the general tone of this review is ""good, but not amazing."" While everything tasted good, I'm having a hard time trying to think of something that would make me go, ""Hey, you NEED to try this place out!""",3.0
"Bourbon Springs is fantastic. Drinks: Phenomenal cocktail menu. Interesting, well thought out and so delicious. I had the Hickory Old Fashioned (a great twist on a traditional old fashioned) and the My Heart Is A Blue Ridge Mountain (so flavorful, not overly sweet and beautiful). Food: The boudin balls are awesome- full of flavor with a little bit of spice. The deviled eggs are seriously perfect - silky texture and so much flavor. I also got a taste of the relish plate with the house made pimento cheese - so good! Atmosphere: The space is beautiful. Simple, wood everything, with a cosy yet elegant feel. I sat at the bar which was perfect, but the tables looked nice and there's even a patio with a few tables out back. The service was great. The bartender was so nice and friendly! So were the manager and the chef, who came out and introduced herself. No pretension here.I can't wait to come back here and try more things! This will definitely be my go to spot for the fall and winter.",5.0
"Great gumbo chef, great service!",4.0
I went here Saturday with my good friend and we will both be back.  We had the boudin (spelling?) balls and the cucumber and onion salad and the burger. I had some grapefruit vodka cocktail was very good.  The burger was something out of this world.  The place is clean the service is good and you should check it out ....the toilet warms your tush.  Who would not like that.  I will be back for sure.,5.0
"As someone living in the neighborhood going on their 3rd year, it's always exciting to get a new restaurant. While there have been some nice additions such as AWOL and Zona Rosa, none have really struck me as regular eating spots or anything special.Thankfully I can say that Bourbon Springs is one of those places. It's got a nice atmosphere (not obnoxiously hip, and you don't feel like you are catching typhoid going to the bathroom). I'll keep this short and sweet, staying in line with the ethos of this restaurant. Do you want super simple, super tasty food that rivals some of the ""famous"" restaurants in the south? Go here, order everything, and embrace the food coma. And get hammered on some cocktails while you're at it.There is also rumors of limited run fried chicken nights. Chef claims hers will be the best in the city. I can't wait.",5.0
"Great spot.  We ate in the garden on a beautiful October afternoon - filtered water was cute, Benjamin our server - also cute.  We started with deviled eggs and the biscuits (both delish!) and then my honey had the trout salad (loved it) and I had the muffalata (a Brooklyn version, but still yummy and filling.)  Desserts were great too - bananas foster and the bread pudding were excellent.  Cute spot - great cocktails too.  And got a bourbon shot on the house.  Wonderful people ~ we will definitely be back!",5.0
"Best gumbo I've had in New York, and better than some I've had in New Orleans.  The pickles are homemade, and spot-on.  Ham biscuit is a must, with beautiful country ham and sweet plum chutney.  Deviled eggs are great also.  When that's done, eat more gumbo.  Definitely order a couple drinks from the cocktail menu, which is very sophisticated and perfectly executed.  Also the price points on the menu and drink items is perfect.  I am very excited and hopeful for the long-term future of this place.  First restaurant I've been excited about in a while.  I wish I lived closer, I would come here all the time.  It's so awesome to find a chef who's opened a southern-style restaurant and not trying to cram fried chicken down your throat.  One taste of that gumbo and you understand that you are in the warm company of people who truly love southern flavors, and more importantly, who understand the art of hospitality.",5.0
"Live in the neighborhood and went here recently for dinner - great, great spot w/excellent food and drinks and friendly service. A new favorite. I had the steak and am still thinking about it days later it was so good....salad & small plates were also excellent. We sat down for a long dinner but I would also come back just to sit at the bar & have a few drinks. The vibe is mellow and relaxed, and the toilet seat is heated. 'nuff said.",5.0
A-MA-zing new place! Everything is SO good. The Relish Plate is the perfect way to kick things off alongside one of their yummy cocktails (Flatbush Buck my fave). Best burger in the neighborhood hands down. Oyster Po'Boy is incredible. Finish it off with a Bananas Foster and voila----!,5.0

"My husband and I were in NYC over Thanksgiving and came across this very sweet, smallish restaurant on one of the main streets in Williamsburg. We enjoyed it so much we returned a couple more times before returning back home.  We got to try out a number of menu items.  Especially good were the fried oysters - v. highly recommended - which are lightly breaded in very fine cornmeal making them a nicely crunchy and tender but not heavy on the fried breading. The curried squash soup was luscious; apparently it is a family recipe from the chef's Virginia family. Would definitely have that again. My husband loved the burger with the house special topping of three alliums: onions, leeks, garlic. He also had the juicy pork chop and would have that again another time. The relish plate was nice and fresh with some playful elements. I also had the gumbo which was shrimp that evening not the usual one on the menu.    I thought it was as tasty as anything I had in New Orleans.  As I am not a drinker, I did not order a bourbon drink, but I really enjoyed the ginger lime soda made at the bar from their own ginger syrup, way better than standard ginger ale. If there was a bit of a weak spot for me, it was the green tomato sandwich which needed a sauce or something to spice it up. The restaurant is doing very well in its preparations and service especially for being open only three months.  Undoubtedly, it will keep improving over time, but it is excellent as it is.",5.0
