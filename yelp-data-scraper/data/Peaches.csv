"Great!. I had a few friends here from out of town, and went to Peaches twice in a few days.Parking was easy - there is a lot of street parking on Lewis, and the streets opposite.Both times I had little to no wait. The staff are warm and friendly and very helpful.We ordered many of the appetizers amongst us. The quality of the food is fantastic - not only did it look great, everything tasted wonderful! This will definitely be a regular for me.",4.0
"I live in the neighborhood and stop in from time to time. The food is pretty good but the service is horrible. I've been meaning to write a review about this place for a while but stopping in for lunch today certainly motivated me to do so. You always wait here, no matter what. You wait 20 mins for the waiter to bring your drinks no matter what you order. From a Bloody Mary to a soda, you wait. You wait for the food, sometimes 20-30 mins. Never ever come here in a rush. Last, you wait for your check. You can be finished eating and wait 30 mins for the check, even if you ask for it. Today I stopped it alone to grab a bite to eat at the bar. There were 4 bar stools available on a Friday afternoon and 3 tables. There was no hostess so I sat myself down. I was told by the female waitress they were ""not ready yet"" and they would be with me in a minute. So I walked back up front and yup! You guessed it...Waited! I waited there for 5 more mins while I stared at the empty stools and tables. The waitress then walks back up to me and tells me it will be 5-10 mins because they have some things to do. To be seated???? Are you fucking kidding me? This place is a joke. I'm writing this review from Saraghina around the block while I eat my lunch. Pathetic. Fire 80% of your staff and start over. It's a shit show",2.0
"A friend of mine told me about this place a couple of years ago, and when I found out my other friend Liz was staying in Brooklyn, we naturally had to go....and I'm so glad we did!  Warm friendly greeting when walked in, and though the place was full and there were some people waiting, it was only about 15 minutes wait time.  Jordan took great care of us and we spent a good three hours there!  Felt like we were at someone's house!  I ordered the delicious turkey meatloaf with the tastiest mashed potatoes.  Normally I ask for extra gravy to smother them in, but these were so good!  I also had the kale salad to start which came with this yummy peanut dressing!  Liz and Rob ordered a bunch of their sides, and we all kind of shared.  The baked macaroni and cheese was pure heaven!  The grits were creamy and the collard greens were sooo good!  Loved their cornbread!  We also had the decadent brownie and the delicious peach melba!  We enjoyed it so much, we all met up for breakfast a couple days later because two of the workers told us that breakfast was just as good!  I ordered the turkey sausage omelette which came with these wonderful crispy potatoes.  Liz shared her granola crusted french toast which was delicious!!!  It was a great meal to start the day...even though it was already noon!  Kira took really good care of us and I seriously was thinking of selling everything I owned to move out here!I can't wait to come back to New York and visit this wonderful slice of heavenly deliciousness!",5.0
Food great as always.Hostess was really sweet. Our server today was meh! He forgot my some of my order.,3.0
Came here for lunch one day from work and was pleasantly surprised at how cute this restaurant was! Very welcoming environment and the service was excellent. I ordered the turkey meatloaf sandwich with sweet potato fries and I was very satisfied. We ordered the wings as well which I probably wouldn't get again since they weren't very meaty and seemed a bit over cooked. But over all it was a great experience!,4.0
"Some of the best breakfast I've had in awhile and I can't wait to get back to Brooklyn and try it again!  The customer service was excellent, plus the music and vibe dope",5.0
"New champ for best chicken wings in Brooklyn!Cool, causal crowd. As with all the restaurants in this group, seating is tight so if a nice quiet romantic dinner is what you have in mind, this place isn't for you. Our server, Jordon was on his game and personable and that more than made up for occasional bumps as people walked by. While the food was pretty darn good. I had the ribs which were pretty good with mashed potatoes which if you've been to The Hot House is exactly the same. My girl had the salmon which she enjoyed as well.Overall, it is definitely a place I will revisit, even if it is just for those oh so tasty wings!",4.0
"Love this little gem in Brooklyn. Enjoyed the vibe and loved the food. Was seated right away and had my brunch of omelette, grits, coffee and some toast. I was a fan of the grits here because it was too buttery for me but my BF loved it. The spot is small so your very close to the next table. So I felt a little cramped but I would definitely come here again!",4.0
"Loved the vibe in here! Greasy music, not too loud, just right for date night. Cute little find with a cool but casual crowd. Full service bar, great menu selection. Go here if you're ready for some awesome soul food!I had the crab cakes which were so good and larger than usual. I was only able to finish one and shared the other. Shoe string fries were perfect and spicy sauce was a deliciosos way to bring it all together. My date had the salmon with lemon pepper sauce. It was perfectly cooked! This place knows sauces!!! Get the brownie dessert! Warm and fudgy! Can't go wrong!",5.0
"Definitely enjoyed peaches!I can see that most of the negative reviews are in regards to the service and not the food. So that is understandable. Thankfully when I came here the service was quick and attentive. App:Ordered the spicy wings. The chicken was cooked perfectly and very flavorful.Entree:Went with the special of the evening which was lobster & crab raviolis covered in pesto sauce topped with shrimp and broccoli. This dish was delicious. The pesto sauce was perfect and the raviolis were stuffed. I loved every bit of it.Drink: I ordered if I remember the name correctly the Brooklyn Punch which consisted of both dark & lite rum with a tons of sugar! The first one was good but by the time I got to the second one I just couldn't finish it because it was so sweet!The vibe here is super chill and relaxing, they play your good ole' R&B classics. Great Brooklyn crowd. Will definitely be returning!",4.0
"I don't love it, but sometimes I've had a long day at work and don't feel like cooking but it's Monday so a lot of places I'd rather eat at are closed and so Peaches it is. It's not my first choice, but I guess it isn't my last either. Everything is fine, but I somehow leave feeling disappointed.",3.0
"My bestfriend treated me to a late lunch here and im soooo happy she did. The service was good our waiter was great, our food came quick and it was super tasty. Our drinks were amazinggggggg. You know most of the time you get a drink and its full of ice so it gets watered down and lose taste NO these drinks were perfectly made (we had 3 a piece) from the first to last sip. Kudos to the tall lightskin guy behind the bar I wish I knew his name. Overall great place and will most definitely come back.",5.0
Good food. The wings and fries mmmmm even though I recently stopped eating meat.  Great drinks.  The Brownstone is my favorite. AJ (the empress bartender) is the Best. Headed there tonight maybe. Just sit by the bar if you are in for a lil convo or cone by with a friend or two and sit at a table. The tunes are good and after a few specialty cocktails you'd be bobbing your head in no time.,5.0
"Cute and cozy restaurant located in a great area of bed-stuy Brooklyn. I came here the day after my birthday for some brunch and it was amazing. My waitress was very friendly and attentive, and the music they were playing made the mood more enjoyable.The serving sizes were large and filling, especially for the price.It didn't take us long to get seated, I'd say about 20+ minutes for a table of 5 which wasn't bad at all. I'd definitely come here again to try some of the other options they have for breakfast/brunch, and I most certainly would love to try out the lunch and dinner menu. Will definitely recommend this place to anyone I know looking for some great food for great prices.",4.0
"Peaches not Peachy Food Vs Service. ""The Peaches way"" I was torn on this one. Please don't think I'm unrealistic about busy restaurant. Busy wasn't the issue, the waiter saying ""there are other people in the restaurant still eating"" after one person in the party gets their food 35 minutes after everyone else. This was a hard review because the Shrimp Po Boy, Brooklyn Wings and Salmon were stars on a menu balanced with Soul Food hits and all American favorites.  This neighborhood restaurant has the food we all liked growing up  but felt like a second class citizen today in a place I grew up. The manager comped the dinner for the two ladies at our table but dinner be ware maybe we should have called the manager when the waiter took the order a second time.",1.0
What an amazing find!!! I just happened to come across this restaurant while searching for another restaurant in the same area via the internet.The funny thing is we ate at the bar. We didn't realize the main restaurant was next door. The service was great though. Our waiter/bartender gave us great recommendations and the music was perfect.The food though... How can I put this....it was INSANE!!!!!! Plus they have a great beer selection.I cannot wait to come back here. My goal is to try everything on the menu. Happy eating!!!,5.0
Came here by accident looking for Hothouse.  My daughter and I shared the chicken.  It was okay.  They have no fried chicken at this location.  Drinks were alright.  Our table was super wobbly and the staff was mediocre.,3.0
"I had heard good things about the place, so when it was suggested for a friend's birthday, I was happy to go. I'm glad it was nice outside, because waiting for two hours to sit down to eat would have been rather unpleasant last week. Then the host told us 30 minutes. Then 45 minutes later it was another 30 minutes.And so on, until about 40 minutes before they close for the switch from brunch to dinner, we were told our table would be ready shortly. Shortly = 20 more minutes.After some complaining, our drinks (Arnold Palmers, which they call 'Tiger Woods' which is epic), an order of wings, and the birthday turtle were comped. The wings would have been delicious if it had been a 20 minute wait. As the shrimp and grits (which I scarfed down in record time because I was famished) would have been pretty delicious too. Instead it turned out to be a mediocre meal that took far too long and really wasn't worth the wait.The waitress was very nice, as was the manager, and I'm sure under other circumstances I would be more complementary-but that wait made sure I will never eat there again. Don't go here if you have any other plans.",3.0
"Love this place. It's one of my family favorites for brunch. My favorite is their Jim Cade Breakfast. It has everything you need to hit EVERY spot. Eggs made to your liking, applewood bacon, grits (which can be substituted) for their potatoes that are so AWESOME. They are seasoned with herbs are fried so they have a perfect crunch. Along with this items is their granola crusted French toast.   This meal leaves you full and satisfied. But of course brunch isn't complete with a good drink to accompany it. My favorite is he Brownstone Punch, it never disappoints as it has the perfect ""punch"" to it and is very refreshing. If looking for a nearby brunch spot give them a try! Sunday/Saturday mornings are VERY busy so take caution and expect 1+ hour wait. It's worth it!",5.0
"With breakfast being my favorite meal of the day I am quite bias on this review since the brunch here was slamming! First score was beating the crowd even during midday. The staff was very nice but our food took foooorever, granted I was extremely famished but I think we waited at least 45 mins for French toast. I will say it was soo worth the wait. Everything was delicious! My bellini (peach schnapps, champizzle complimented with a cherry) and the soulful tunes from the live band were a welcomed distraction from the wait from the kitchen. Surprisingly the dining guest were very engaged with the band; we were clapping and tipping like we were on the subway and it was ""Showtime folks"".  They opened the side patio for outdoor dining. Enjoy your eats indoors or outdoors here at Peaches!",5.0

Scrambled eggs with Cheese (that is if you want cheese)2. Bacon - not no stringy bacon - this is the real juicy thick bacon3. French Toast with Fruit.... French toast was delicious.... the only thing is it was served more to the warm to cold while everything was nice and hot - I would have loved for my French toast to have been served Hot to warm - then I would have given Peached 5 stars...4. Grits or home fries or truffle fries or a side of fruit....What more does any one want from one item from the menu.............. GLORY!We also tried the wings..... SOmebody could have slapped us twice..... LOL! that is how good it was..........DELICIOUS...The Salmon Croquettes were also delicious..... Peaches is more spacious than their sister store Peaches Hot House.... and I enjoyed Peaches 150% more than Peaches Hot House..... Peaches Hot House is Meh compared to Peaches Restaurant...... just my opinion..I loved the atmosphere as well as the play list.

The only reason why I didn't give these guys 5 stars is because they told us a 45 min wait which ended up being a 75 minute wait. Other than that the best grits I've ever had and really friendly staff. I recommend going before church lets out on Sunday to avoid a long wait.,4.0

"I had the opportunity to eat at Peaches this weekend for brunch.  The food was great!  The wait was quoted about 30-40 minutes for a party of two, which was expected. The waitress was pleasant and attentive.  We ordered the ""Jim Cade Breakfast"" (French toast, turkey bacon, scrambled eggs, and brunch potatoes), Shrimp and Grits, and the Roasted Beet Salad.  I have absolutely no complaints.  The granola crusted French toast was served with fresh berries, the grits were extra creamy, the shrimp was cooked just right in a nice cream sauce and the salad had a great vinaigrette. I cannot say the same for desert.  Unfortunately, the brownie with ice cream was dry.  Which is the only reason I took off 1 star.",4.0
"I came here a few days ago for brunch and has the Jim Cade with potatoes instead of bacon and grits. I had French toast with berries, scrambled eggs and potatoes. The French toast was wonderful and not like any that I've had. It reminded me of coffee cake and left a lasting impression. The eggs were good and the potatoes were alright. All in all I enjoyed my meal. Now onto the service. Because they were short staffed, out waitress would sometimes forget out drinks or take a little long. But that is understandable since the place was packed. Just be ready to wait a while for some great food. Or if you get there when there are few customers, get ready for quicker service.",3.0
"Been a fan of peaches for years now. But it has completely fallen off. When you spend 20+ dollars for breakfast and get served coffee in paper cups?  All the peaches affiliated spots are suffering from terrible management (the smoke joint, Marietta, hothouse, and the now closed cafe and little brother BBQ). Also things like music changes (which signal for whom they are there to serve), servers who are unprepared, etc are just sad. Not worth the wait. Find another spot.",1.0
The only reason why I didn't give these guys 5 stars is because they told us a 45 min wait which ended up being a 75 minute wait. Other than that the best grits I've ever had and really friendly staff. I recommend going before church lets out on Sunday to avoid a long wait.,4.0
"I love this place! I took my mom here for brunch and she loved it! That's saying a lot since my mom is very picky. We had the John Cade breakfast (I think that's what it's called). We had waffles, fruit, eggs, and cheese grits  which was amazing!!! We washed it down with a few mimosas and we were good to go. The service was good nothing to complain about. I will be returning to try the catfish, I can't wait.",5.0

"Pros:Peaches food is G R E A T!!!!Cons: The waitress Jazz took our order and NEVER came to check on us. We wanted ketchup and syrup. Never got that :(  Also the utensils were dirty.

"I finally got to experience brunch at the infamous Peaches in Brooklyn this weekend. It's pretty hard for anything to go wrong on a sunny beautiful summer Saturday in Brooklyn. When we entered we were greeted genuinely and enthusiastically by two different people. I was happy as I walkways appreciate warm greetings that come from a genuine place. We sat outside in the outdoor seating area to catch some vitamin D. Our waitress was Angela and she was great! She shared a bit about her journey and even hooked us up with some recommendations for places to go after our meal to have drinks. I had the Sausage Omelette with potatoes and toast. It was pretty good and tasted delicious. The only critique I had was some of the potatoes were a little under-cooked. There were a few bites where I bit into very raw potatoes. It was a minor distraction, however, and the rest of the meal was fantastic.Will definitely be coming back and loved the vibe and energy there.

"This is such a great spot. The first thing I loved about this place was that it was blasting Beyonce for about the first 30 minutes.

I ordered a cocktail and the shrimp and grits. My guest ordered a ginger ale and ribs with collard greens. The service, though pleasant, was extremely slow. Our food came out way before our drinks. We should've received both at the same time or the drinks first. It shouldn't take 35 minutes to pour a glass of ginger or make a cocktail.The food was just ""ok"". The shrimp in my dish were extremely small - think fried baby shrimp that you get from the Chinese spot. And the portion was super small. My guests ribs were well cooked on the outside but not enough on the inside.Our waitress barely checked on us. And we had to flag her down for our check.This place needs some training in customer service and food prep.

"The service here was sooooooo slooooooow. My daughter ordered the wings that were on the starter menu. I ordered the burger. I got my Burger long before her wings came out.

I had been to Peaches a couple of times before, but it was always for brunch. This was my first dinner experience.  My burger was pretty good, as were my daughters wings and Mac and cheese.All in all, I think this is a better brunch spot. Don't think I'd come back for dinner.

Anyway she was really sweet and gave me her personal opinion on what I should try being my first time eating here. She was very warm and welcoming. I appreciated her honest opinion based on the things I like to eat. I chose the blackened cat fish with cheese grits and it was amazing !!!!!! I must say I enjoyed it from beginning to end. The bellini actually had me me feeling a little buzzed to but in a good way !! The atmosphere is really nice. The music is soothing , as well as the location being in the bedstuy Brooklyn. I will be back next Friday lol for brunch again but getting something different !! Hands down a really great brunch experience!",4.0
Very friendly staff! The food was great too. We had the Jim cade breakfast which was very filling. French toast wasn't too sweet; bread was crunchy on the outside and soft inside so very well made. They ask you exactly how you like your bacon and they cooked mine exactly to my liking(crispy but not burnt). I'd definitely go back!,4.0
"Food is absolutely delicious!! Comes out hot and fresh. Drinks are fantastic and well-made. However... I am going to need them to invest in a better reservation system. A girl with a clipboard, and you spend nearly $200 on brunch? No. Opentable.com shouldn't be that expensive. Please do something about this immediately. Also, they've crammed so many tables in the space that you can literally can hear someone belching at the next table.",4.0
"I guess from the other reviews it can get crowded but I was there on a weekday afternoon and had no problems. Everything on the table was good and we got a variety of things ie French Toast, smoked salmon, fried fish, cream of spinach. The servers were very nice and the music was the perfect neo soul mix, loud enough to hear and sing along but not so loud that you're yelling across the table. Ambience is perfect for brunch or a laid back date. Only negative is that I can't comment on the drinks bc they never brought them smh and by the time food came out we were no longer interested.",4.0

Food was room temperature,  and not tasty at all,.  had the fried fish which was a VERY THIN piece of fish coated in HEAVY CORNMEAL BATTER so all you tasted was CORNMEAL, and my side was an OUNCE of grits, give me a break GRITS are INEXPENSIVE. Left there unsatified and HUNGRY and BROKE, very over PRICED. Will not return again nor would I recommend.",1.0
"So delicious! I had the salmon which is served on a sauce that's..amazing. My boyfriend had the gumbo was very tasty and we split the wings.Awesome food.The one drawback is the line and the rush of people at lunch hour, but hey, that's the price of a good restaurant, right?",4.0
"This is such a great spot. Came here very quickly on a Friday evening. The music, ambiance, and service was great. I would definitely recommend the wings, and the Mac and cheese was some of the besssssssssst Mac n Cheese I've ever had, hands down! Would love to come back here again.",5.0
"The food is good, the catfish is excellent and worth the other aggravations, namely service, which is hit or miss (mostly miss). Usually we come for dinner, as we tried out the Jazz brunch and found it much too loud, making it difficult to have a relaxing morning conversation with my dining companions.",3.0

"We had our Saturday Brunch at Peaches and the service we received from (young guy with handle bar mustache) was great. He was very attentive and made personal recommendations. My lady ordered the Salmon Omelette with cheese grits while I had a platter (name?) that had French toast, bacon, fresh fruit and cheese grits. We both ""liked"" our meals but it didn't bowl us over. The server also recommended their signature brunch cocktail and again we weren't impressed. I drank mine while she only drank a 1/4 of hers. We liked the ambiance of the place and we recognize that it was our first time there....there may be other meals on the menu that give us the ""oh hell yeah"" feeling we were looking for. I really don't anything bad to say about our visit other then our first time wasn't impressive. However we will be back to try them for lunch or dinner.",2.0
"I've been here 3 years ago, and the only thing consistent is the bad service! I really want to give them a five but it's seriously ridiculous. Good food doesn't compensate for bad service. You shouldn't  have to wait 10 minutes to order, when it's not busy.",1.0
"I've been to Peaches about 3 times at this point and I find it to be just okay. During my first visit, I got wings, spinach dip, and the gumbo. I remember the gumbo being pretty delicious but was not very impressed with the wings and spinach dip.More recently, I tried the turkey loaf burger and substituted my fries for the Mac and Cheese. The burger was okay and Lettye filling. The Mac and cheese was extremely delicious. It was the highlight of my meal. Our server was very friendly and took care of us. My one complain was with the bill. After our server rang us up, I noticed that he'd split the bill the way we asked but charged both amounts to my card. I showed it to him and he told me it was a mistake and he canceled the second payment and I shouldn't have received that receipts.  A few days after my visit, I was charged two separate amounts for my meal. I had to call my bank to have one of the charges removed. Please pay attention to your receipt when you go her and any other restaurant.As a Bed Stuy native, I will continue to support Peaches but I will be bringing cash in the future",3.0
The French toast was tasty but my omelette had onions and tomatoes that the menu didn't mention.so it sucked having to eat around the onions my server was nice we tipped 20% the drinks were very good will I get out of bed to come here NO but if I was strolling by and wanted food I would stop by again. I wish the food was better and I didn't care for the gumbo I've had better,4.0
"Every time my buddy flys in from Dallas one thing he always says is ""let's go to peaches"". The place is great and so is the ambiance. However tonight I went and they were having an event. They encouraged us to go to the restaurant next door which was an annex. We sat and waited for at least 7mins without as much as an acknowledgement of our arrival. There was another family at another table which were giving their menus back and walking out. Then we waited another 4 mins for the waiter to drop the menus off at our table and walk off. I'm a huge supporter of Peaches but you guys are loosing money with that staff 12/10/2015",1.0
So went here with my daughter for dinner one night.  Saw some pretty good reviews so decided to stop by.  In general the place was pretty middle of the road.  Loves the music selection as well as staff being friendly.  Décor was nice and the food was pretty good.  I had the turkey meatloaf (good but not great) and my daughter had the burger (again good but not great). Would come back for a meal and drinks but nothing I would be excited about.,3.0

"My favorite local restaurant in Bed-Stuy, but on Saturday they superseded the expectation.Saturday my colleagues and I had an early morning photo shoot.

She was willing to put as at the bar. The bar ended up being unavailable so we left to go to another restaurant.The other restaurants wait wasn't worth it. I called Peaches and spoke to Diane and she said if I got back in the next 10 minutes she can have us seated. This was less than 15 minutes after I left. We got to the restaurant and in 5 minutes we were seated and enjoyed the music from the brunch band. PS: they only had 3 servers working when I was there, but I couldn't tell, the food came out quick and we had a great meal.I bring clients here, my wife and I if we want to have a local date night, we end up here, and I bring friends here who want an intimate setting with a great atmosphere of music, food, and drinks.

The wait time was accurate and the hostess kept us updated while we waited. The ambience is calm and cozy, but the spacing is tight. The prices are extremely reasonable. I ordered the white cheddar grits, eggs, bacon, potatoes, and cornbread. I usually don't put cheese on my grits so they were a bit overwhelming, but they were still good. No complaints about the eggs and bacon. The potatoes were tasty but I just felt like they didn't put any love into them; they just fried whole red potatoes with a little seasoning and put them on the plate. I love cornbread but it was corny. I should have ordered toast.The server could have been much better. She was sweet and friendly but she gave us the drink which was only a soda way after we got our meals.

The dense French toast was spiced like a coffee cake (without being overly sweet) and had a light crunch to the outside. The bacon was hearty and crisp and the grits were rich and creamy. My boyfriend had the oven-baked grits with pulled pork and they were out of this world. I also recommend the Brownstone Punch and the Local if you're having a boozy brunch. The live jazz made for a great ambience and the wait for 2 was nothing compared to what you'd deal with at a brunch spot in Williamsburg.

And I also told him I was not going to eat such a horrid salad and I don't know why in the world he would bring something out that looked like it had been thrown around and placed on a plate! So he took my food back and 10 minutes later, another woman who was not my waiter explained to me that my chicken had dropped on the ground, and the chef was unwilling to remake my salad, so she had to make it over for me.

Wow! Great place!!!We were greeted warmly at the door and seated immediately. The restaurant is not that large but the spacing of the sits makes it comfortable. The prices are very good for the portions and QUALITY of the food. I can't stress enough how amazing everything tasted. My babe and I could have easily split a plate but this was our first time and the greed took over. Lol. We got the ribeye. That comes with French fries and a small fancy roughage. We also got the short ribs (wipes drool) with collard greens and mash potatoes. And a side of Mac and cheese.If I had to do it all again I would have come sooner with more people! The food was so so so good. The portions are generous and the price point is correct. Love it! Definitely coming back!,5.0

I would visit again to sample something else on the menu (had the shrimp po' boy, the first go 'round and it was good).

"So my rating is really more like 3.5 stars. This place popped up on my radar when I read about Dine In Brooklyn (Brooklyn's own version of Restaurant Week), and apparently, Peaches was one of the recommended restaurants.

With prices more or less the same, my boyfriend and I decided to order items off that menu and their regular menu. Really liked my grits with shrimp, mushroom, and scallion, as well as the chicken and sausage gumbo (although my boyfriend pointed out: no okra??). The chicken dumplings and rigatoni with smoked sausage were less memorable, and both were off the restaurant week menu.Overall, service and atmosphere were great, really warm and friendly, and food was good, but nothing about our experience really jumped out at us.

"Brunch Brunch BrunchI've tried this restaurant several times and brunch on the weekends seem to be the best thing about this restaurant.

There is good parking but I've noticed most people live close because it's in the middle of the neighborhood which is perfect! They also have a live band sometimes and offer outdoor seating when it's nice.So why a 4 star because there isn't anything bad about his place. Great service, and okay food.",4.0
"The burger was delicious. Medium-well, just as I asked. The fries portion was generous and just right. The Cajun seasoning is a must-request. My friend had the catfish sandwich. He seemed to like it. My other friend had the shrimp po boy. He seemed to enjoy that as well.",5.0

The bartender was busy and didn't great us initially. It took too long to place an order and for our drinks to be made. It was frustrating. The food took more than an hour and I only ordered shrimp and grits. Truly unreasonable. The drinks were good but the service was terrible.",2.0
This place is absolutely amazing. Homemade lemonade and sweet tea. Chilled water. Amazing menu and great atmosphere. I really loved this venue.,5.0
Wow! Great place!!!We were greeted warmly at the door and seated immediately. The restaurant is not that large but the spacing of the sits makes it comfortable. The prices are very good for the portions and QUALITY of the food. I can't stress enough how amazing everything tasted. My babe and I could have easily split a plate but this was our first time and the greed took over. Lol. We got the ribeye. That comes with French fries and a small fancy roughage. We also got the short ribs (wipes drool) with collard greens and mash potatoes. And a side of Mac and cheese.If I had to do it all again I would have come sooner with more people! The food was so so so good. The portions are generous and the price point is correct. Love it! Definitely coming back!,5.0

"Saturday Brunch you'll find: Wonderful live music, bustling lively ambiance, beautiful people, and tasty food! Only draw back is no bottomless mimosas & the mimosas I did order were 1/4 glass filled (side eye). Other than that, no complaints. This is one of the coziest busiest restaurants in bedstuy.

Peaches has been a neighborhood staple since the days of Akwaaba for a weekend brunch. The table ordered the Jim Cade breakfast with granola crusted french toast fresh fruit crispy red potatoes and applewoood bacon and scrambled eggs with cheddar cheese and it seriously hit the spot leaving us all full and content. Brunch wouldnt be complete with a cocktail so rounds of Brooklyn Brownstones were ordered. There had to be a new bartender mixing the batch as the cocktail was off this week-it was too bitter and not refreshing. The bartender just added more simple syrup and it made it tolerable but erased the idea of ordering a secind round. This is not a negative towards a great brunch option in Bed-Stuy as we will brunch again!,4.0
The food here is like no other! The Jim Cade breakfast comes with this potatoes that have a hint of lemon zest! Super yummy! The French toast is a must and don't forget the Brooklyn brownstone cocktail to wash it all down! Very cool people and a nice vibe. Music selection just adds to it!,5.0

"First I would like to say the food is amazing here but the service I received on the night of May 15th was terrible. I was visiting from out of town and my friend couldn't stop talking about how much he loved it there. He eats there every week. We got there around 9:45 and waited to be seated. There was no host upon putting our names on the board But we did recognize the two parties ahead of us. There was no room on one side of the board so we wrote on opposite sides. Upon checking on tables and the wait finally a blonde hair woman with glasses comes out and reminds that they will be closing at 11pm. We still are waiting at this moment and it's around 10:30 when I check the board after 1 party goes in. She comes out to erase names and write names Higher. I tell her that my guest and I were after another party. She tells me she doesn't know that and ""Not to call you a liar"". I told her she could ask the party in front of us. They told her we were after them but she asked the party after Us if they arrived before or after. So we are still waiting outside for a table and she comes back out and says she has two openings at the bar and invited the party after my group to find in. Ive never known a restaurant to seat a party that was after another before them. What really made me upset is that we got in and was seated at a two seater and there was three of us. Not to mention some of our dishes were cold and were sent back to the kitchen to be heated. It took them awhile to bring back the plates that were being heated. Upon the restaurant closing we were still eating and the waiter comes over and cuts on the lights to the restaurant. The host comes out to the bar with her laptop and starts working on ""closing"" I believe. At this point my friend is appalled because the ambiance of the restaurant is gone and the waiter reached over him to turn on the lights. I've never been treated as if I wasn't welcomed and my first experience at this establishment wasn't up to my friends expectations. I've called several times to speak to the owner. I wanted to speak to him directly to let him know before I wrote this review but I was sent in a wild goose chase.

"I love this place except for the weekends when you have to wait a million years. If you want to eat, get there before the church crowd with the rest of us heathens and just pray over your brunch so that your soul will be saved. The gumbo, wings, and oh my God great shrimp and grits are too amazing to miss. The service is hit or miss at times because newer servers tend to not be as observant to cues like waving arms or people dropping dead from hunger. Don't be nervous little waiter, we won't bite you unless you actually taste like bbq. The bartender is this cute little brunette woman and her cocktails are on point, she deserves five stars.",4.0
Peaches has been a neighborhood staple since the days of Akwaaba for a weekend brunch. The table ordered the Jim Cade breakfast with granola crusted french toast fresh fruit crispy red potatoes and applewoood bacon and scrambled eggs with cheddar cheese and it seriously hit the spot leaving us all full and content. Brunch wouldnt be complete with a cocktail so rounds of Brooklyn Brownstones were ordered. There had to be a new bartender mixing the batch as the cocktail was off this week-it was too bitter and not refreshing. The bartender just added more simple syrup and it made it tolerable but erased the idea of ordering a secind round. This is not a negative towards a great brunch option in Bed-Stuy as we will brunch again!,4.0
The food here is like no other! The Jim Cade breakfast comes with this potatoes that have a hint of lemon zest! Super yummy! The French toast is a must and don't forget the Brooklyn brownstone cocktail to wash it all down! Very cool people and a nice vibe. Music selection just adds to it!,5.0
Disgusting dry salad that cost me $14.50 not to mention the girl that took my order had no knowledge as to what they serve...anyway won't be coming back,1.0

"First I would like to say the food is amazing here but the service I received on the night of May 15th was terrible. I was visiting from out of town and my friend couldn't stop talking about how much he loved it there. He eats there every week. We got there around 9:45 and waited to be seated. There was no host upon putting our names on the board But we did recognize the two parties ahead of us. There was no room on one side of the board so we wrote on opposite sides. Upon checking on tables and the wait finally a blonde hair woman with glasses comes out and reminds that they will be closing at 11pm. We still are waiting at this moment and it's around 10:30 when I check the board after 1 party goes in. She comes out to erase names and write names Higher. I tell her that my guest and I were after another party. She tells me she doesn't know that and ""Not to call you a liar"". I told her she could ask the party in front of us. They told her we were after them but she asked the party after Us if they arrived before or after. So we are still waiting outside for a table and she comes back out and says she has two openings at the bar and invited the party after my group to find in. Ive never known a restaurant to seat a party that was after another before them. What really made me upset is that we got in and was seated at a two seater and there was three of us.

"I came up to Brooklyn to visit some friends last weekend. Got there before they got off of work so decided to grab a drink and wait for them, I was in the mood for southern food and saw that this place had good reviews and was near me so I decide to check it out. Came in and it was not that packed. i sat down at the bar. A bartender with glasses and a short hair cut came over and took my drink order and gave me a food menu. When I had made up my mind on food I had to wait for a while before she came back over to check in on me. I ordered the burger but within two minutes after placing my order I read reviews online saying that it was garbage so I tired to get the bartender attention but she was busy talking to a customer so I called her over and asked if it was too late to change me order. The waitress said no so I changed it to the catfish. I did not have to wait too long for my food but was disappointed when I got it. The fish was bland and mushy. Either way I ordered about two more drinks until my friend arrived. He ordered two drinks as well before we left. Unfortunately the bartender barely paid attention to us and we had to wait long times after finishing each drink. We often had to get another employee to get her attention for us. After waiting a longtime after finishing our last drink we called her over for the check.When the bartender brought over the bill she had an attitude. She said that she did not appreciate that we yelled to get her attention. I was shocked. We went back and fourth for a while before I took the high rode and said I was sorry she felt that way. A coworker of next to her gave us the look that he was sorry. We paid the bill and unfortunately still left her a tip of 20%, (only because it is a black owned business). I will definitely never be returning to this establishment because of this bartender and her nasty attitude.",2.0
It was my first time there and I was thrilled with the cozy and homey feel of the place.  The salmon was the best served on a bed of sauteed spinach with a side of fried grits.  I have never had fried grits and to say it was delicious is an understatement.  The shrimp and grits were great as well.  The serving was just enough to get full and feel satisfied.  It was a great dish.  To top it off we had french toast with ice cream and cooked peaches!  It was spectacular!  I loved everything about this place and the music was an added touch.,5.0
"Lovely decor, not too loud music, outdoor seating and the neighborhood are the draw of this place. Just don't come in with an appetite. The food isn't anything to write home about.

The decor, the waitstaff and the ambiance indulges anyone who is more into haute couture than denim & tees.Come in a group or with one friend or with both sets of grandparents and all the family in between.

Well they would of gotten 5 stars because my  Brownstone Punch was awesome well when the first bartender made it. I ordered the kale chicken salad which is light for me. When my salad finally came out my chicken were cube like shape which was cool but now when i took a bit my chicken was frozen. Wtf!!! They put freezer chicken in my salad. Where do they do that at?  Well i got another salad with grill chicken in it this time. That should of been the case in the 1st place.

I went for lunch today with a friend. I have been hearing about this spot from friends for about 7 years now. Finally I tried it. It was ok. For reasons I thought. No healthy choice apart from salads. I tried the salmon chowder which taste good. But it smelled raw. Also I tried the Crab cakes and they look like falafel and or hush puppies. But they need to have more healthy choices.,2.0

"Brunch at Peaches is always awesome but had dinner here for the first time yesterday. I had the Spice Seared Salmon and it did not disappoint. The flavors started a party in my mouth! The salmon was prepared perfectly and the black bean and corn salad that came with it put the dish over the top! For dessert I had the Peach Melba. It made me smack my lips and do the cabbage patch (my happy dance) in my head! The staff was friendly, acommodating and knowledgeable. I will continue to go for brunch but I'm happy I found out how special dinner is here also!",5.0

"Finally made it here and I have to say I was disappointed. I'm not sure if the restaurant has heat but the evening I went it was cold outside and inside. My boyfriend ordered the brick chicken (which was good). However, my pasta, mac and cheese and cornbread was not the best. Seating can be better. I'm a slim girl but the seating seemed tight. I swear some of the chairs look like they were sized for kids only. I know their connected to Peaches Hot House and the Smoke Joint but I prefer the Smoke Joint out of the three.

"Awesome brunch. Memorable. The layout was amazing. I almost forgot I was in Brooklyn. Waitress was efficient and attentive. They had a live band ( consisted of a Bass, Drum and Sax I think) I got the Jack Cade breakfast. French toast, eggs, bacon and potatoes.

"I finally made it to this place on a Saturday morning at opening hour and tere was already a line. Once seated, the place filled up quickly. The tables are really close to each other. Mine was constantly being bumped either by waiters passing by, or  neighboring patrons, or literally blown by the wind from outside.I ordered the Portobello sandwich with BBQ fries and cornbread and was less than impressed. The sandwich itself was pretty good and flavorful. The cornbread was really dry and tasteless. The fries were just okay, not sure what the ""bbq"" part is about though. Mine really weren't any better than the fries without the BBQ and they were not particularly well-seasoned. The service was intermittent at best. I was initially seated at the bar but asked to be seated at a table because they decided to open the door/window to the middle of the restaurant on a chilly morning. I was moved to a table, just in time for them to permanently open the patio door next to it. Dude, didn't I say I was cold??? Finally, after seeing me and other customers don  coats and scarves just to eat, they remembered to close the door they sat me next to. Despite having the host re-seat me, it seems I was forgotten about once I left the bar. No one checked on me, but I did finally flag down a friendly face for a take out box. He must've tried to find out who my waiter was at that point because shortly after, the bartender came along asking if I was ready for my check (which I certainly was). Got the check, paid, and bid the bartender farewell. He looked me dead in the eye and took the check...no response. He didn't respond until he had gotten a chance to look at the check and the tip amount. He suddenly became very friendly. Yelling out a goodbye after I was at the front door. Really though?? It was an interesting morning. I decided to be optimistic and think that this less-than-pleasant experience was a fluke. So, at some point I'll give them another shot in the hope that my experience is better then.Pluses: huge portion sizes certainly a bang for your buck. Food is prepared quickly. The portobello sandwich was quite good, but I'd tame my expectations for the fries and cornbread. Live jazz music-- I found the music quite entertaining actually until the drummer went on tangent, abusing her drums during what was either supposed to be a solo or faux-intermission. Minuses: service (at least for me) was hit or miss. The place gets seriously crowded really quickly, you could either be ran over or forgotten by your waiter. Elbow room is a premium, so say hello to your neighbor before you accidentally elbow them in the rib. Might make it go over a bit better.",3.0
I went for lunch today with a friend. I have been hearing about this spot from friends for about 7 years now. Finally I tried it. It was ok. For reasons I thought. No healthy choice apart from salads. I tried the salmon chowder which taste good. But it smelled raw. Also I tried the Crab cakes and they look like falafel and or hush puppies. But they need to have more healthy choices.,2.0

Yesterday I went to peaches for brunch and I had an awesome time. The food was scrumptious and the waitstaff was extremely attentive. It was also a really refreshing experience because it happened to be a jazz brunch so there was a live jazz band setting the mood for great ambience within the cafeteria. I had the farmers omelette with toast and grits on the side. My wife had the shrimp and grits. We also had an order of French toast that came along with both of those orders. The one reason why I would give peaches four stars instead of five is it took a little bit long for the food to arrive and I did feel as though I was waiting longer than I cared to wait. But once the food came out it was delicious and I was very happy with it.The main thing that I really appreciated about going to Peaches this time was that the service was so on point. I felt like the waitstaff was very accessible yet not overbearing. I felt like they were really on top of their game. It was a very crowded morning brunch but whenever I needed something they were on it. As soon as I finished a plate of food somebody whisked it away. If I needed another napkin or my fork fell on the floor somebody was right there to take care of that as well. I would totally go back again for brunch especially since they're only a few minutes away from my house. I'm glad I found a good brunch spot just minutes from my house.,4.0
"By the time we arrived to Peaches we were cold, because it was snowing, and very hungry. So after a quick glance over the menu, everyone one quickly chose their dished and waited it great anticipation for the cease that was on the way. Fortunately, we were distracted from our great hunger by the amazing live band. After a few minutes of serenading   our starters arrived. Among them, was a delicious Kale salad, that included crunchy chickpeas, peppers, golden raisins topped with a tangy vinaigrette. The combination of sweet, crunchy, spicy and sour made for a well balanced and tasty salad, one of the best I've ever had. After having such a great salad, the anticipation for the meals was really building. So much so that the drinks ordered, I got a Brooklyn girl which was absolutely delicious, were barely noticed.More of my review can be found at FashionAccordingtotheMen…",5.0
"Peaches was not at all what I had expected. The wait was ridiculously long. I would assume after such a long wait it would be a much well worth the wait experience. Unfortunately, this was not the case. Service was HORRIBLE. Our waitress was Amanda. She was by far the most inattentive server working there. She came to our table TWICE and that was because WE FLAGGED her down to stop. She got our order wrong and because she never followed up to see how the food was or if everything was okay we ate the wrong order anyways. There was no point in trying to find our mystery waitress. Our entree came and we were still waiting on the cornbread we had asked to have in the very beginning. At this point we flagged down our waitress since we FINALLY see her and she says it is the kitchen's fault for the hold up. About 20 minutes later I flag her down AGAIN asking about the cornbread she says ""Oh! Kitchen is all done with the cornbread sorry"" so we ask for the check. Less than 5 minutes later we see another waiter with 3 plates of cornbread. We stop him and ask and he says there is cornbread. He so nicely offered to bring us out some. The waitress brought back our check and charged us for the cornbread after she already gave us the initial check. I am happily to pay for exactly what I ate but I expect a revised check with the EXACT amount I am anticipating on paying. I never got a revised check with my add on cornbread that SHE failed to even get us. Instead I get the check with this random amount that does not look like the initial check she gave us. Absolutely ridiculous service. Peaches, you guys need to get better staff. Food - is decent. But not worth the long wait and HORRIBLE service.",1.0
"I have been here twice in the last month on both sides of the restaurant (it's a little confusing because it sort of looks like two separate restaurants but it's all of the same place right next to each other). I really like the live music on the larger side that was there when we went this past Saturday for brunch. The wait wasn't too long at all for two people but we still chose to sit at the bar. On arrival the hostess told us as a disclaimer that it may be too loud and if we are the kind of people who would be bothered by loud live music it's recommended to sit outside or on the other side because once fetid we will not be able to request to be moved. We would be placed back on the waitlist. Anyway, long story short, both times the food was very mediocre (collectively, I had the wings, turkey sausage omelet, and something else I can't even recall at this point) and almost disappointed because it looks so good in the pictures. The service itself is horrible, horrible, horrible. The start of a family but everything takes forever. A friend of mine that went to southside to her. Both bars, the bartenders or servers were very friendly - they just took a long time to do absolutely everything. Perhaps they are overwhelmed but that is not our fault. On Saturday I saw what seemed like the manager come over often to check if the bartender was OK but didn't do anything to help her. She clearly needed help. The waitstaff who brought our food but forgot our cutlery apologize to sleep and were very kind. But again it shouldn't take this long to serve food, check out, etc.  I'm not sure why this place is so popular. I think it's perhaps just the trendy spot to go. Their service doesn't support their popularity though. Neither does the food.  The drinks however were their only strong positive. SUPER STRONG positive lol. Highly recommend for their drinks.",3.0
"I love this place. It's a wonderful family and neighborhood restaurant with a great staff and clients . The food is yummy although I will say that they don't have very many healthy options on the menu, but what they do have is yummy. I arrived at about 7 PM and there were  a dozen empty tables, within 15 minutes every single table was full. When people are here, you see them enjoying themselves, laughing, breaking bread. I love this place. Peaches hothouse on Tompkins is also super great.",5.0
"Peaches was amazing! From the professionalism & personability of the staff to the delicious food, this is the place to be. My partner and I went here for Sunday brunch and though he had been before, we were both in awe at the experience. He had the egg white scramble and I had the sausage omelette, both which were cooked to perfection. The mere fact they they serve turkey sausage was a winner for me because many places don't and those that do, usually charge extra. In sum, the food was great, the staff friendly & welcoming, and the overall decor was perfect for anyone (friends, family, couples, and everyone in between). The grits are a must-try...they're guaranteed to be the best you've ever had.",5.0

The food here is absolutely amazing alongside the pleasant diverse Brooklyn atmosphere. This establishment has by far the best macaroni and cheese in Brooklyn (wayyyy better than it's often juxtaposed Resturant The Smoke Joint).  Their famous sweet tea is delicious and is very unique from any other sweet tea. Overall their lunch and dinner is totally out of this world. If you're planning on dinning here on a Saturday I suggest you call and make reservations because it gets really crowded and the wait can go up to two hours.,5.0

I am happily to pay for exactly what I ate but I expect a revised check with the EXACT amount I am anticipating on paying. I never got a revised check with my add on cornbread that SHE failed to even get us. Instead I get the check with this random amount that does not look like the initial check she gave us. Absolutely ridiculous service. Peaches, you guys need to get better staff. Food - is decent. But not worth the long wait and HORRIBLE service.",1.0
"I have been here twice in the last month on both sides of the restaurant (it's a little confusing because it sort of looks like two separate restaurants but it's all of the same place right next to each other). I really like the live music on the larger side that was there when we went this past Saturday for brunch. The wait wasn't too long at all for two people but we still chose to sit at the bar. On arrival the hostess told us as a disclaimer that it may be too loud and if we are the kind of people who would be bothered by loud live music it's recommended to sit outside or on the other side because once fetid we will not be able to request to be moved. We would be placed back on the waitlist. Anyway, long story short, both times the food was very mediocre (collectively, I had the wings, turkey sausage omelet, and something else I can't even recall at this point) and almost disappointed because it looks so good in the pictures. The service itself is horrible, horrible, horrible. The start of a family but everything takes forever. A friend of mine that went to southside to her. Both bars, the bartenders or servers were very friendly - they just took a long time to do absolutely everything. Perhaps they are overwhelmed but that is not our fault. On Saturday I saw what seemed like the manager come over often to check if the bartender was OK but didn't do anything to help her. She clearly needed help. The waitstaff who brought our food but forgot our cutlery apologize to sleep and were very kind. But again it shouldn't take this long to serve food, check out, etc.  I'm not sure why this place is so popular. I think it's perhaps just the trendy spot to go. Their service doesn't support their popularity though. Neither does the food.  The drinks however were their only strong positive. SUPER STRONG positive lol. Highly recommend for their drinks.",3.0
"I love this place. It's a wonderful family and neighborhood restaurant with a great staff and clients . The food is yummy although I will say that they don't have very many healthy options on the menu, but what they do have is yummy. I arrived at about 7 PM and there were  a dozen empty tables, within 15 minutes every single table was full. When people are here, you see them enjoying themselves, laughing, breaking bread. I love this place. Peaches hothouse on Tompkins is also super great.",5.0
"Peaches was amazing! From the professionalism & personability of the staff to the delicious food, this is the place to be. My partner and I went here for Sunday brunch and though he had been before, we were both in awe at the experience. He had the egg white scramble and I had the sausage omelette, both which were cooked to perfection. The mere fact they they serve turkey sausage was a winner for me because many places don't and those that do, usually charge extra. In sum, the food was great, the staff friendly & welcoming, and the overall decor was perfect for anyone (friends, family, couples, and everyone in between). The grits are a must-try...they're guaranteed to be the best you've ever had.",5.0

"My boyfriend and I came here for brunch and we were not disappointed!  I had the blackened catfish with grits and he had 2 eggs scrambled with cheese and grits. Awesome! Big pieces of cornbread, enough to share if you're not too hungry. Next time I'll try the Brownstone punch!",4.0
The food here is absolutely amazing alongside the pleasant diverse Brooklyn atmosphere. This establishment has by far the best macaroni and cheese in Brooklyn (wayyyy better than it's often juxtaposed Resturant The Smoke Joint).  Their famous sweet tea is delicious and is very unique from any other sweet tea. Overall their lunch and dinner is totally out of this world. If you're planning on dinning here on a Saturday I suggest you call and make reservations because it gets really crowded and the wait can go up to two hours.,5.0

Such great food! Siri always recommend this place for brunch but we always chose other spots. Today we decided to give this place a try and OMG! Why did we wait so long?!

"(THIS REVIEW IS BASED SOLELY ON THE FOOD, NOT THE AMBIENCE OR SERVICE.)A friend and I visited this place a few weeks back, I've always heard about this restaurant so i was excited to go. The setup was nice and we were seated right away. Our waiter was nice and very knowledgeable about the menu. I started off with the gumbo and my main course was the meatloaf, my friend had the spinach dip. The Gumbo was absolutely forgettable.

It was dry, the flavor was just weird....I could barely eat it so I asked for it to go. I ordered the mashed potatoes and collard greens on the side and that was just ehhhhh. I was so disappointed because the I heard so much about this restaurant. Maybe I  just ordered the wrong things on the menu, but meatloaf is pretty basic.

To start off I was not sure if I should give it a 2 or a 4 I am very mixed up about this review.

"Peaches is like the pretty girl you fall for immediately. Until you get to know her.She's a quaint little restaurant with picnic tables set up outside, a hearty Southern menu that beckons to my belly,  groups of eclectic, attractive people inside. But then, as you spend more time with her, you realize things aren't so swell. You're still super into Peaches, you want it to work so badly, but you find yourself thinking, ""IF ONLY she were...."" THEN you two could live happily ever after, but alas, that's not the case.""IF ONLY the ambiance here didn't try so hard..."" Came here for brunch and the music was at nightclub decibels. It wasn't even crowded but I had to yell to be heard.""IF ONLY the ambiance here tried a little harder..."" Ice machine was leaking dirty water on the ground. Bathroom had no soap. Ews.""IF ONLY the service here was competent..."" There were an abundant 4-5 waiters for a tiny space of only ~15 diners. While I never saw a single waiter slacking off, they were actually always running around, the product of their 'hard work' was oddly missing: our food took 45 minutes to arrive. At one point, I pathetically walked up to a waiter to beg him to check on our order, and he looked at me, ""Wait, did you order yet?"" Umm. The table next to us asked 6, six! times for water. Another table had no silverware, even after their food came. They would seat parties and then kick them out because they forgot someone else had been patiently waiting for that table already. Oh, we ordered a bottle of champagne but was told they were out, and then I see the bartender pouring a glass for another patron! I mean, come on, offer me a glass if it's available!And most importantly, ""IF ONLY the food was more tasty..."" Listen, by the time our food arrived I was so hungry I was gnawing on my own arm. I thought I would've eaten anything and been thrilled, and yet... My crabcake sandwich (waiter recommended) was, just, not good. The crabcake alone was great: fresh, little filler; but it was too bland to hold up in sandwich form. I threw most of the bread away. The fries were simultaneously over spiced with paprika and undersalted. The coleslaw was super watery, and because they just slapped it on my plate next to everything else, it made the sandwich & the fries soggy. The other, more sad, disappointment was the collard greens. I *heart* collard greens because they're always packed with so much flavor, but not so here. Is there something more bland than water? Cause that's what they cooked my collard greens in. To sum up, I was sadly disappointed with Peaches. The service was inexcusably chaotic & disorganized, if not holy incompetent in light of the waiter-to-diner ratio. The food was SO close yet SO far, the execution was just not thought-through.

I guess that bridge was easily crossed but with no help. We got the 2 of the pound cakes with berries and an order of the brownie. The pound cake could have used more berries, if it weren't for the ice cream we ordered on top of all our desserts the pound cake would have been less substantial. The brownie, even though I'm not a chocoholic I enjoyed the taste of it, probably the better of the desserts.

"So I'm going to review three different visits I've had to peaches. First of all! I LOVE PEACHES! The food is so amazing, and the service for the most part is great. At one visit I went to peaches to host a surprise birthday dinner for my boyfriend. Yes, because is NOT the biggest of restaurants. So it was so amazing how the staff was so willing to accommodate (10 people) and help us. The day before I went and got to speak to Reggie (the manager) so I could make sure everything was going to go great. (Mind you I had the dinner on a Saturday night) It was flawless. The staff was so amazing even with helping get the cake cut. The dinner was amazing. The ribs are different I will admit. Mostly because they are more of a sweet sauce than am extreme BBQ sauce. Everyone in the group seemed really pleased about their food! And the Brooklyn girl was amazing this night!So of-course I decided to go again! For my birthday this time. Ehhhhhh. It wasn't as great. This is a Saturday morning brunch (10 people with me). There was a hostess with a southern accent who was way more into talking than actually helping and actually ended up giving our table away to the wrong party of 10.... Yea. So yea. I also ended up having a Brooklyn girl this time again and I was pretty disappointed. It just seemed like the juice and jack wasn't blended properly. The service wasn't as great everyone seemed pretty rushed and our order was butchered. And they seemed really annoyed when it came to correcting it. Now for my friends birthday brunch we had a waiter who seemed a little new... He was really nervous. But I'm the end he did a great job and gave us a birthday pound cake and offered to take pics for us. I had the brownstone punch, actually I had 3. And yes, go ahead and indulge. BEST DRINK EVER. Peaches is a great dinning place and I love it especially the neighborhood. P.S they do not add tips to the bill so PLEASE be sure to tip your server!!!!!!!!!",4.0
"Trying again. We haven't had the best of luck here, but since we live in the neighborhood now, decided to give them another chance. So far, I'm hovering around two stars for this visit.Food was meh. The only positive thing I can say about the service is that we eventually got our food and our check. I'm a notorious over-tipper, but this is one of those times when I calculated exactly 15 percent and left that grudgingly. My previous review still stands.",2.0

"I had a good time.  Our wait was about 30 min during Sunday brunch.  I ordered the Brooklyn Girl drink, granola french toast (amazing), bacon, eggs, and grits.  We also ordered wings and cornbread.  Being the first time that I ever ate grits,  I was not impressed.  I don't want to dissuade you but they were not my cup of tea.  The cornbread was dry as the desert.  I had to drink a cup of water to get it down my throat. The French Toast is a must try.   The wings were tasty but nothing to throw a parade over.   The service was pretty decent.  We had a waitress who was bashed in another post.  She must have been having a good day today because I was satisfied with her.  Overall good music and a bus boy that will bust a dance on cue..lol. If he is reading this ""Poison"" is now our song...lol. I had a good time. Looking forward to going back for dinner soon.",3.0
"This place is so cute and sweet, it reminds me of being down south having brunch with my family anyway the grits with cheese were amazing!!! So was my blackened catfish and if you really want a nice buzz in the after noon.....Get the Brownstone Punch!!!Me and my friend were smacked after just 2 lol, But we had a good time there. The staff was very attentive and friendly as well. I'll be back again!!",5.0
Great food eggs with salmon was delicious the blackened fish and grits was perfect and the trench toast was the best I ever tasted ... If you doin brunch or lunch this is the spot,5.0
Food was good but I had a crab cake for $13.00  and a dip for 8.00 and mimosa  and tip and all I paid $35.00 ... Food was ok and the prices are to high..... I'm still in shock with the price of a small crab cake ...service was not good also ... We wanted a both to sit in and because it was 3 of us they would not accommodate us at all .. Poor service it was empty and they still refuse to sit us where we wanted ....,3.0
"I REALLY wanted to like this place. I honestly did. I visit the sister restaurant, Peaches Hothouse, all the time so I was excited to try this place. So I came here on a Sunday around 12 pm so I figured it would be a lil packed. I went to the hostess and she told me the wait would be 30 mins but advised me that I could go to the location next door. So me and my bf went to the next door location and got a seat right away. Our waiter came and gave us our menu, we ordered. I ordered the FARMERS OMELETTE, which had no meat in it and a side of bacon. Then we played the waiting game. Now I didn't mind waiting because the game was on but we waited close to one hour for our food but I didn't complain because I know it can get busy.Then the food comes and I am excited because at this point I'm starving! My bf gets his food, he ordered the Jim Cade, but when the waiter hands me my plate I noticed my eggs had no spinach in it, some round meat in it, and no side of bacon. I look inside and it's the Sausage Omelette. So I flag my waiter down and tell him it's the wrong item. She takes the food back and tells me it will be out soon. So I want and 30 mins go by then another 10. Then another waiter said it would be out soon but by this time in ready to go and I tell him to take it off the bill. By this time me and my bf are mad because he finished his food and I didn't even get my food yet. Then the waiter comes back with a plate of food And asked me if I wanted it. Initially, I was going to take the food to go but something told me to look and it and LI and behold it's another sausage omelette. It's now after two o clock and I still haven't eaten. I was thoroughly upset because I was seriously hungry and waited two hours for nothing. The waiter took the food off the bill but both my boyfriend and I were upset over the experience. Our waiter got  an .83 cent tip and we left. I wasted my time here Nd will never come here again. Maybe if the waiters paid less attention to the music and more attention to the customers I would have a better review. 0 stars!!!!",1.0
"Brunch over the weekend was a mixed bag. On one hand, the atmosphere, food, and live music made it a really ideal place. On the other hand, the service was lackluster at best, and my drink was absolutely horrendous. I'm sure the other drinks are alright, but my bloody mary tasted like a fifth grader had mixed it (more olive juice than horseradish, tomato juice, and vodka---what?). When my boyfriend asked for a spoon to eat his gumbo with, the busser looked at us like he had sprouted an extra head. It took 3 separate asks and almost a half hour for our coffees to arrive at our table  (totally unacceptable, even for a busy brunch time--especially after waiting over a half hour for a table to begin with). Peaches has the foundations of a good restaurant, even a great one. With so many other options nearby, the service needs a serious overhaul/attitude adjustment to regain my confidence and future business.",2.0

"So I'm going to review three different visits I've had to peaches. First of all! I LOVE PEACHES! The food is so amazing, and the service for the most part is great. At one visit I went to peaches to host a surprise birthday dinner for my boyfriend. Yes, because is NOT the biggest of restaurants. So it was so amazing how the staff was so willing to accommodate (10 people) and help us. The day before I went and got to speak to Reggie (the manager) so I could make sure everything was going to go great. (Mind you I had the dinner on a Saturday night) It was flawless. The staff was so amazing even with helping get the cake cut. The dinner was amazing. The ribs are different I will admit. Mostly because they are more of a sweet sauce than am extreme BBQ sauce. Everyone in the group seemed really pleased about their food! And the Brooklyn girl was amazing this night!So of-course I decided to go again! For my birthday this time. Ehhhhhh. It wasn't as great. This is a Saturday morning brunch (10 people with me). There was a hostess with a southern accent who was way more into talking than actually helping and actually ended up giving our table away to the wrong party of 10.... Yea. So yea. I also ended up having a Brooklyn girl this time again and I was pretty disappointed. It just seemed like the juice and jack wasn't blended properly. The service wasn't as great everyone seemed pretty rushed and our order was butchered. And they seemed really annoyed when it came to correcting it. Now for my friends birthday brunch we had a waiter who seemed a little new... He was really nervous. But I'm the end he did a great job and gave us a birthday pound cake and offered to take pics for us. I had the brownstone punch, actually I had 3. And yes, go ahead and indulge. BEST DRINK EVER. Peaches is a great dinning place and I love it especially the neighborhood. P.S they do not add tips to the bill so PLEASE be sure to tip your server!!!!!!!!!",4.0
"Trying again. We haven't had the best of luck here, but since we live in the neighborhood now, decided to give them another chance. So far, I'm hovering around two stars for this visit.Food was meh. The only positive thing I can say about the service is that we eventually got our food and our check. I'm a notorious over-tipper, but this is one of those times when I calculated exactly 15 percent and left that grudgingly. My previous review still stands.",2.0

"Ok, i went here with my girlfriend on a monday, figure that would be a nice slow day to have a quiet dinner and since its my one night off and its close to home, why not. We arrive and were promptly seated. The server was nice and attentive.  We placed an  order for wine and it came quickly, tho the second and third did not. Anyways. Im giving this 2 stars because i ordered the half chicken. I never order chicken in a restaurant unless it is in manhattan and in a place that has a michelin star or at least a star from the new york times. So i got my half chicken. I swear there is a dehydrator in the kitchen because this was sooo dry i could feel it sucking the moisture out of my skin. I even said that same ""explanation"" to the server. I told her to tell the chef how bad it was. I ate probably 3 bites. And after telling her that she smiled as if i was joking! Really?! Well needless to say she didnt take it off the bill and still charged me for it. I dont ever complain. I paid the bill and we left. Needless to say i wanted to like this place. Will never return.

The food on all of my visits has been pretty stellar, pepper-y and well-seasoned as it comes hot out of the kitchen.

When I came here for lunch/ dinner, I did not like the wings because it was pink and the barbecue fries were not all that!

"1 star is far too much for this review but it is what it is since 0 stars is not an option.  Tonight I decided to order takeout for myself and my family and it turned out to be quite a regretful experience, one which made me wish i'd cooked which is usually the norm in my house on Sunday's.  To make matters worse I had guests over and I bragged about Peaches food which I've had twice before although on both occasions I dined in.  First of all the portions were incredibly and insultingly small. You'd think they were feeding kids.  The mashed potatoes could have been eaten in one mouthful and the Mac and cheese could have very well been the leftovers that remained from the regular servings. The caesar salad was dry and was sans the thinly sliced cheese.  The ribs were also next to nothing considering how much the cost of ribs are but you get the picture.  Anyway I decided to contact Peaches to voice my dissatisfaction  about the portions and Instead of the young lady on the phone offering a mea culpa her response was ""There is no rhyme or reason to our portions as it can change from week to week"". Really? This is your response to someone who is making a complaint. Clearly she needs a lesson in basic customer service.  I then asked to speak with the manager (Nicole if I'm to believe that's her) and was told she wasn't available. All this dialogue provided enough time for her to offer me a simple apology and that would  have been the end of our conversation and most likely not the beginning of this review. Needless to say tonight will be the last time I dine in OR out at Peaches.",1.0
"The first time I went it was amazing. The atmosphere was great and the music was perfect.Me and my boyfriend had an amazing waiter who had a voice of a Greek God and he made sure to take care of us. I had the St. Louis Ribs and they were divine. The mash potatoes were silky and buttery to perfection, and the collard greens were just right. My boyfriend had the burger with shrimp (I don't remember the name) and it tasted amazing.Great speedy and amazing service.However, the second time we went it was like we were at a complete different restaurant. The service was horrible and the food tasted completely different (it was like 6 on a scale of 1-10). The waitress took forever to get our drinks, the food wasn't that great and the vibe was rather horrible.This place clearly lacks consistency.

"My boyfriend and I stopped in for a late lunch a week or so ago. We ordered gumbo and cornbread to start. The cornbread was quite tasty, and the gumbo was fine, but not super flavorful. I ordered the shrimp and grits, first asking if the grits were the cheddar grits mentioned in the Sides section - they were, so I went for it, not wanting to have to eat bland grits(the worst), but alas, they were bland, even with the alleged cheddar. The shrimp weren't seasoned. They hung out in a white wine gravy which was probably the only flavor in the dish, and even being so, was pretty bland. The mushrooms in the dish were tasty enough. But overall, the dish was disappointing. My boyfriend was disappointed in the crabcake sandwich, saying that there was an overpowering lime flavor in the patty, which I agreed on after tasting. At the beginning of the meal, I was hoping they had some peach cobbler or pie for dessert.  But after the disappointing meal, I didn't want to satisfy my recent peach cobbler craving with a  flop, so I abstained.

"A friend of mine took me here for brunch last Saturday while visiting BK. It was pretty packed. The main side with the live band had a 45 minute wait so we decided to eat on the other side. Definitely a nice environment. Whoever was playing the music in the back had all the jams going. We were promptly seated. Our waiter was kind and welcoming the whole time.

"1 star is far too much for this review but it is what it is since 0 stars is not an option.  Tonight I decided to order takeout for myself and my family and it turned out to be quite a regretful experience, one which made me wish i'd cooked which is usually the norm in my house on Sunday's.  To make matters worse I had guests over and I bragged about Peaches food which I've had twice before although on both occasions I dined in.  First of all the portions were incredibly and insultingly small. You'd think they were feeding kids.  The mashed potatoes could have been eaten in one mouthful and the Mac and cheese could have very well been the leftovers that remained from the regular servings. The caesar salad was dry and was sans the thinly sliced cheese.  The ribs were also next to nothing considering how much the cost of ribs are but you get the picture.  Anyway I decided to contact Peaches to voice my dissatisfaction  about the portions and Instead of the young lady on the phone offering a mea culpa her response was ""There is no rhyme or reason to our portions as it can change from week to week"". Really? This is your response to someone who is making a complaint. Clearly she needs a lesson in basic customer service.  I then asked to speak with the manager (Nicole if I'm to believe that's her) and was told she wasn't available. All this dialogue provided enough time for her to offer me a simple apology and that would  have been the end of our conversation and most likely not the beginning of this review. Needless to say tonight will be the last time I dine in OR out at Peaches.",1.0
"The first time I went it was amazing. The atmosphere was great and the music was perfect.Me and my boyfriend had an amazing waiter who had a voice of a Greek God and he made sure to take care of us. I had the St. Louis Ribs and they were divine. The mash potatoes were silky and buttery to perfection, and the collard greens were just right. My boyfriend had the burger with shrimp (I don't remember the name) and it tasted amazing.Great speedy and amazing service.However, the second time we went it was like we were at a complete different restaurant. The service was horrible and the food tasted completely different (it was like 6 on a scale of 1-10). The waitress took forever to get our drinks, the food wasn't that great and the vibe was rather horrible.This place clearly lacks consistency. I wish it was like the first time I went everytime I went.3 stars for an amazing for an first time.",3.0
"My boyfriend and I stopped in for a late lunch a week or so ago. We ordered gumbo and cornbread to start. The cornbread was quite tasty, and the gumbo was fine, but not super flavorful. I ordered the shrimp and grits, first asking if the grits were the cheddar grits mentioned in the Sides section - they were, so I went for it, not wanting to have to eat bland grits(the worst), but alas, they were bland, even with the alleged cheddar. The shrimp weren't seasoned. They hung out in a white wine gravy which was probably the only flavor in the dish, and even being so, was pretty bland. The mushrooms in the dish were tasty enough. But overall, the dish was disappointing. My boyfriend was disappointed in the crabcake sandwich, saying that there was an overpowering lime flavor in the patty, which I agreed on after tasting. At the beginning of the meal, I was hoping they had some peach cobbler or pie for dessert.  But after the disappointing meal, I didn't want to satisfy my recent peach cobbler craving with a  flop, so I abstained. The server was nice and fairly attentive.  We didn't order anything from the bar. It was comfortable inside and felt like a real neighborhood joint. More flavor though, please!! :)",2.0

Ask them to make it medium well though or else the fish will be too dry. I love the Brooklyn wings (smoky and sweet) and the Caesar salad. The spinach dip is good but the chips have unnecessary BBQ seasoning on it. It can do without that addition. I've ordered takeout a few times because I get the craving for their decent red velvet cake sans the berry sauce (they should drizzle chocolate sauce).

""A bottle of wine or a glass"". Now I have to repeat myself, I asked for a bottle of wine, not a glass she had the Audacity to reply ""so you want that with one glass or four""If I want to come in for my friends birthday celebration and have a bottle of damn wine to myself I have that right as a damn consumer, I told her to bring four glasses as that was my original intent.  Disgusting.The wine finally comes to my table twenty minutes later she has the audacity to tell me, oh you're only having wine, so since you're only having wine an pours only in my glass after setting all four up to attempt to embarrass me.My girlfriend gets a meatloaf sandwich specifies NO CHEESEshe tells the waitress, what do they do?

"5+ years and countless meals later, I still agree with my review from 2009. If anything, Peaches has improved with age. The menu has stuck to the solid options (pry the turkey meatloaf from my cold dead hands) and has updated frequently enough to stay fresh.  Brunch, lunch and dinner are all excellent. Keep in mind, the neighborhood is still working on building up more options and Peaches has a solid reputation, so you'll probably have a wait. Sunday brunch as church lets out? Forget about it.

I understand customer service is important but don't ignore/deny how delicious the food coming out of the kitchen is! We had turkey meatloaf, blackened fish, shrimp/mushroom grits, and pulled pork. It was all delicious and awesome. Our server (I think her name was Monique) was so friendly and funny. I do agree that the tables are pretty close together so you will hear the conversation from others.  It has a very small bar which is unfortunate because I like its layout.

The drinks weren't bad either; strong enough for me to get a buzz (though, let's face it. It doesn't take much for me)",3.0
"Let me first start off saying I'm 29, I never say my age but I most certainly don't look like a teenager.My waitress was SOY and I found her demeanor to be disgusting, in fact if I come back here I will specifically ask to NOT be seated in her area.I was asked for my ID and was ready to eagerly comply however I realized it wasn't in my wallet, I told her I was a grown woman, as I look and behave and I am one, and she asked me what I wanted after the rest of my party ordered their drink.  She asked me what I would like and I responded a bottle of wineShe looks at me and is automatically judgmental. ""A bottle of wine or a glass"". Now I have to repeat myself, I asked for a bottle of wine, not a glass she had the Audacity to reply ""so you want that with one glass or four""If I want to come in for my friends birthday celebration and have a bottle of damn wine to myself I have that right as a damn consumer, I told her to bring four glasses as that was my original intent.  Disgusting.The wine finally comes to my table twenty minutes later she has the audacity to tell me, oh you're only having wine, so since you're only having wine an pours only in my glass after setting all four up to attempt to embarrass me.My girlfriend gets a meatloaf sandwich specifies NO CHEESEshe tells the waitress, what do they do? Cut the top off!!! This is actually unbelievable.On a high noteCollard greens: goodShrimp and grits: EXCELLENTServer: DEAD HORRIBLE... Awful, awful, awfulAND FOR THIS I MUST GO TWO STARS",2.0
"5+ years and countless meals later, I still agree with my review from 2009. If anything, Peaches has improved with age. The menu has stuck to the solid options (pry the turkey meatloaf from my cold dead hands) and has updated frequently enough to stay fresh.  Brunch, lunch and dinner are all excellent. Keep in mind, the neighborhood is still working on building up more options and Peaches has a solid reputation, so you'll probably have a wait. Sunday brunch as church lets out? Forget about it. If you are a party of one or two, try to grab a spot at the gorgeous bar.",5.0
"We were visiting a friend of mine in Brooklyn and this was actually the 3rd option due to crowds and wait times for 6 people. Let me tell you now, I am HAPPY it happened. We read some reviews on Yelp and a lot of people were griping about service issues. I understand customer service is important but don't ignore/deny how delicious the food coming out of the kitchen is! We had turkey meatloaf, blackened fish, shrimp/mushroom grits, and pulled pork. It was all delicious and awesome. Our server (I think her name was Monique) was so friendly and funny. I do agree that the tables are pretty close together so you will hear the conversation from others.  It has a very small bar which is unfortunate because I like its layout. It's a personable and intimate bar. if you don't want to sit close, get take-out. There were a LOT of people picking up food to go.",4.0
"When I'm dining I look at four things:Atmosphere (decor, cleanliness, vibe)Attentiveness/customer service (greeting, time from ordering to receiving food)Taste (seasoning, flavors...basically, is there's a party in my mouth)Pricing (Is the cost worth what's been plated?) I've heard mixed reviews about Peaches, and I wanted to check it out on my own.   I came here for lunch, and there were people dining when I arrived and about six people standing in front of me waiting to be seated. However, it wasn't overly crowded as I spied several open tables and tables that needed to be cleared.  On arrival it took a bit of time before we were greeted and seated.  When we finally were led to our seats, we found ourselves in the back next to the door that leads to the backyard.  Because of an ant army leading its troops into the restaurant through the door, we felt we might as well sit outside since the outside was coming in so to speak. There was a bit of confusion with our waitress who seemed a bit thrown off when we requested to be seated outside. And when we finally moved, it took an additional 10 minutes before we received menus or water.  Then a different waitress finally came to ask us if we placed our order. She looked surprised and exasperated when we told her we hadn't even gotten menus.  She informed us that she was the only one at that time waiting tables (OMG!); she returned shortly with our menus.We waited another 15 minutes before we were able to place our orders and then we waited some more before our food finally arrived.  After waiting for so long for our food to arrive when it did it looked pretty good. Unfortunately it wasn't love at first bite: *The wings packed a little bit of heat, but lacked flavor*Crab cake sandwich also lacked flavor *Sweet potato fries were good...but really is it possible to mess those up*Mac & cheese - the ultimate comfort food for me...sigh...I've definitely had betterThe only reason I'm not giving this place 1-star is because another diner (who confessed to coming here all the time in the beginning) mentioned that there was staff turnover, which may have been the problem: slow waitstaff who were still learning the system and quite possibly a cook still trying to handle the menu. Although these reasons might indicate that Peaches may have the potential to be better than what I've experienced, it'll be some time before I even consider revisiting.",2.0
Amazing food & staff!   One of my neighborhood favorites.  Love the live music and cocktails while we waited on our food.,5.0
"I don't know what you guys are talking about in regards to the service. Friendly, efficient, and genuine. But the food was obviously the star. We got the fried chicken (regular...I don't do heat) catfish, Mac n cheese, and collards. Fried chicken was perfectly seasoned and crisp. Catfish was a decent portion and moist. Both the sides tasted like your grandma cooked it,  Both entrees came with the most delicious cornbread! Overall, I loved the place. Will definitely be returning...maybe even this week!",5.0
I end up in this spot quite often for brunch with the girls.  Yes you will have to wait for a table since they don't take reservations but it is worth it. My fav item is the granola crusted  French Toast and their omlettes. Its so popular that they expanded to the store right next to them. The pretty much take up the entire block now.,4.0
Love peaches! Food is amazing & service is great. Not a long wait if you know what time to come. Great neighborhood spot to enjoy some outside lunch.,5.0
Went for Saturday brunch. Small but nice atmosphere. Food was delicious and service was great. They had a live singer with a sweet sultry voice. They don't have a children's menu so we ordered side dishes for my daughter plus the portions were large enough I was able to share with her. The only draw back is its tightly packed. Besides that I'll be returning to try their lunch or dinner menu.,5.0
Everything was delicious!  I had the shrimp and grits.. my sister had the salmon and spinach..my daughter had the flounder.  Everyone's food was great. The chicken wings are very flavorful.,4.0
"You lost me at ""no fried chicken."" Maybe I'M confused, but when one thinks of soul food the first thing that comes to mind is fried chicken. I don't want to walk 15 minutes to your other location to get what is arguably THE classic soul food dish.BBQ Wings: Tasty if you ignored their burnt and cold qualities. Mac and cheese: Tasty and cold.Grits: Flavorless and cold.Ambience: Pretty but filled with flies for some reason. We were seated inside??!!!??Cornbread: Untouched, since flies quickly landed on it.Flounder: Mushy and flavorless, but hot.Fries: Flavorless and cold. Like seriously, if you force people to get fries as the side make them edible.Drinks: Not too tasty, and also not too much bang for your buck, got no buzz!Service: Great waitress, but the kitchen left much to be desired.Flies: Bountiful!!If your plan is to take this food home and use the microwave then you may be happy.",2.0
I definitely like the atmosphere.  Our server Rachel was very friendly and told us a little bit about each item on the menu as well as happy hour specials. Very unique how they recycled old wine bottles to use as water bottles that is brought out to each table as you are seated.  The flounder fish is good!!!,5.0
"So I went to Peaches for brunch with my bff and i can honestly say that the food was excellent. We got there around 2:30 and put our name on the list. Note to those going for the first time they don't have a big sign outside just on the wall in smaller writing. Brunch is up to 3:30 on Sunday's also. So the wait wasn't to long about a half hour. The decor is pretty nice as well good for a date or just to catch up with friends and family. We ordered the special which includes two granola french toast which was yummy in my tummy even without syrup. I also had eggs with swiss cheese and the eggs were perfect and i had turkey bacon which was on point as well and potatoes which were ok. I ordered a side of corn bread but it was dry and was breaking up from the slightest touch, the cornbread at BBQ'S out does the one here. I ordered a cocktail which was tasty it was the first pick on the back of the menu. All in all this is a good spot and I highly recommend it for brunch, I plan on going back for dinner soon.",4.0

"Peaches... a wonderful escape from the stresses of life!The food is almost always on point.It's located down the block and around the corner from me!The staff is awesome! They make you feel happy to be there even when you're waiting forever to be seated on the weekend.My faves are.... -blackened catfish sandwich w bbq fries-shrimp and grits-shrimp po'boy w bbq fries-meatloaf sandwich w bbq fries-ribeye steak w bbq fries - mac and cheese (thick n creamy)-gumbo (all time fave)-brownies-homemade bread pudding a la mode-grilled asparagus-grilled brussel sprouts-creamed spinach-broccoli-brooklyn wings-the lewis-most of the saladsThe bad part is the wait time.  Now that everyone and their great granny knows Peaches exists, wait times can get ridiculous (esp on weekends). But it's almost always worth it. I've only had two bad experiences here food-wise.  The first was ordering the meatloaf sandwich which is usually tres delish.  I guess they had a rough day and it was a softer consistency than I cared for. The other was ordering brooklyn wings to go... I have vowed never to do it again. I think they try to get rid of the older wings via takeout and I'm not with it. They're not bad but you can tell the difference when you have had them fresh on numerous occasions.This is my go to in the neighborhood!",4.0

I did have a slice of the cornbread as well, which came out piping hot and fresh. The perfect sweet and salty ratio. I was wishing I had more. I also shared some Mac and cheese with my friend and that too was rich and creamy delicious. Lastly- try one of their cocktails! I'm not a big drinker so one cocktail had me a bit tipsy and it was so so good. (The Rosie P) I can't recommend this place highly enough and I can't wait to go back.

My friends and I came here a few weeks ago to celebrate a birthday.  The food was SOOOO good.  Everyone seemed to really enjoy what they ordered.  Their Brownstone Punch is great!  We got The Lewis Spinach and Artichoke Dip.  It was delicious with a nice kick to it.  I ordered the blackened catfish sandwich which came with fries and I just HAD to order the mac and cheese which tasted just like home made!  I'd love to go back.,4.0
"The first time I dined here wasn't a good experience.. My 2nd visit last night was extremely different.

So this review is solely on the bar portion of peaches. When I get the time to actually sit down and eat ill write another review..So my boyfriend and I live in the neighborhood and wanted a drink. Had to be about 11:30 close to 12. So we go to peaches and automatically when we walk in the bartender ignores us (short black girl with a short hair cut) so we're siting at the bar for like 20 minutes until someone serves us ! Unacceptable ! Mind you it was just us and 1 other person at the bar.The rum and cokes she made us were good but not $8 good. Hmph I usually pay $5! And then she kept repeating WE'RE ABOUT TO CLOSE WE ARE CLOSING SOON. She was so fucking rude ! And what bar closes at 12?!?!,2.0
"So it was my first dining experience. I loved the decor and atmosphere of the restaurant. It's the perfect setting for a date or drinks with some friends.

"I visited Peaches for the first time for dinner after hearing wonderful reviews from friends. I can honestly say I was impressed with the service of the staff, the ambiance of the establishment and most importantly how good the food was.

My cousins had the Turkey Meatloaf and the Ribs and both were pleased with the meal. By the time desert came we were stuffed but thoroughly enjoyed the brownies with ice cream. It was sinfully delicious just melting in your mouth. Simply I highly recommend going here for dinner and I can't wait to go back for brunch.",5.0

Headed to the spot bc I love the ambiance& prices but it was CLOSED. Boo. So the 6 of us in my crew headed to peaches for brunch 1/3/15 and by this time we were famished.  They don't take ahead reservations but our wait was about 20 minutes. It was a BIG plus that the live band was playing while we waited which i didnt even know about. Loved seeing a fully chocolate restaurant of staff and patrons who were all good looking. Felt good real talk. Got seated and I ordered the shrimp & grits which were perfect. And a side of fried eggs which came with pickled onions which I am now obsessed with. I do believe the shrimp & grits or most entrees are meant to be ordered with a side bc the portion size was just right for me. Not big enough for leftovers or a grown man tho. Also ordered french toast  (I split it with a friend no judgment) which was battered with granola and came with FRESH not soggy fruit on top! I'm trying really hard to think of any french toast I ever had that was better in my 27 years of life. Can't do it. My drank doe. I ordered the 1st one on the menu, can't remember the name, it had something brownstone related in the name.  Boy do I love a tall drink! I only needed one, that Thang played no games whatsoever. Tried everyone else's food like the kale salad, sweet potatoes fries,  tilapia and it was unanimous that the food was amazing.  Lastly SERVICE.  I admit I kept bugging the hostess when we would be seated and she never caught an attitude just remained cool the entire time. Our waitress was amazing.  Extremely attentive and friendly & knowledgeable about the food. All in all I paid for one entree, a side of eggs and a drank for $37 including 19% tip.

SO bomb! (it had a funky name, totally forgot it, oops). So worth five stars. If I rated the restaurant on this dish alone, it would totally receive five, just FYI. My friend got blackened catfish and grits, and she said the day we went they never tasted better out of all the times she has gone before (and she goes a lot!). Maybe they have a new/better cook as compared to other reviewers experiences, but either way, I enjoyed my food. She enjoyed hers (I didn't enjoy hers tho, I just can't stand catfish, but it wasn't terrible). She also ordered peach cobbler. I didn't really want it, but I had some. The peaches were good (small but good) but it didn't have that thick heavy hearty milky peach goodness underneath the crust. Nor did it have that yummy thick bready crunchy top. Instead it was like runny and watery under a thin nutty crumb-like top. So not peach cobbler. So not very good. I can make it so much better from scratch (which is probably why I'm being so critical). It was not melty in your mouth gimme some more, like it should be (my opinion) she liked it though.Overall, everything I ordered was awesome and I recommend you try it. Wicked good!! For realsies!!So I want to give it five stars for very attentive service and cool staff...but that damn dessert just pissed me off a little. It killed it for me. I can't. Fix it Peaches!

"I really want to love Peaches,  I really, really do! The problem is each experience is never totally bad or totally great its always in the middle. You can have horrible service but great food one day and then not so good food and great service the next! For quite some time service really sucked although the wait staff was pleasant anywhoo, I decided to finally write a review based on my experience last night. We had an awesome waitress by the name of Emma Lou, she was personable, funny, attentive and an overall pleasure! We have absolutely NO complaints regarding our service but I need to talk about the food! We both ordered the split pea soup which is absolutely phenomenal (though it may have been just a little salty); what kills me about their soups is that they serve it in extra large bowls but your actual serving may only fill 1/3 of that bowl- so are we actually paying for the soup or the bowl rental because the serving you get can be no more than that of a regular sized can of Campbell's soup! Call me greedy, say what you want but if I see a large bowl come out the kitchen I'm expecting a good amount of soup to be IN that bowl. Here's a thought: sell an appetizer sized soup AND an entree sized soup - this way you can fill up that bowl a little more.My friend had the shrimp and grits entree and it was very good, the grits (this time) were not so runny that you had to eat it with a spoon. This time you could actually eat the grits with your fork which I personally love! The problem was with my simple Caesar Salad with shrimp; I have NEVER eaten a Caesar Salad made with regular iceberg lettuce and what's worse is they used more of the core than the outer green parts of the lettuce which gives you more of the white and sometimes yellow lettuce that doesn't really taste good. To make matters worse they piled on the Parmesan which totally overwhelmed the dish. I added shrimp and they were the best part of the salad but I must say its totally annoying that they come on a stick. How does one go about ruining a salad? Well folks, all of the above!I've been here countless times and I've had some not so great experiences on both the service side and the food side but I've also had some pretty good experiences as well... Funny thing is I was never compelled to write about those experiences until ""simple simply sucked""!  The Caesar Salad may be one of the simplest items on the menu which raises my question, how and why do you mess up simple? This is a restaurant in my neighborhood and I sincerely want it to be better! I will continue to support and pray for more hits than misses! I just hope someone in management is really reading reviews and taking notes. You have to do better, you have to want to do better because your customers deserve better.",2.0

"I agree with all the regulars.  Peaches used to be a neighborhood gem. Great food, great service, great vibe.

Why give me the WHOLE ENORMOUS CUTLET ON TOP OF THE SALAD? That's not always how it came, so why the change?  Because they're ""too busy"" to cut it now. That's why.  Well, guess what --  I'm too busy to cut my own chicken when I pay $20 for a salad.  The waitress brought it to me that way, but looked embarassed as the set the plate down and immediately asked me if I wanted her to have them cut it.  Thanks, girl. I do.  But I really have to wonder why they would even serve it that way.  And the chef must have changed since 2010 and early 2011, because some of their delicious staples (like the mac and cheese) are decidedly less delicious.   And to add insult to injury, things keep getting more and more expensive.  I hate to say that because I LOVED that a local business that was owned and operated by ""local people"" (Bed Stuy natives know what I mean by that) and doing well.

Peaches is a one of a kind place in a neighborhood that is light on sit down restaurants.  That is changing, Peaches.  Clean up your act.  It's too late for me - my friends and I never go to Peaches anymore and I never take my family there (whereas we used to patronize them for every celebratory event) but you may have a shot with other regulars.Don't let your success ruin you.",2.0

"I really want to love Peaches,  I really, really do! The problem is each experience is never totally bad or totally great its always in the middle. You can have horrible service but great food one day and then not so good food and great service the next! For quite some time service really sucked although the wait staff was pleasant anywhoo, I decided to finally write a review based on my experience last night. We had an awesome waitress by the name of Emma Lou, she was personable, funny, attentive and an overall pleasure! We have absolutely NO complaints regarding our service but I need to talk about the food! We both ordered the split pea soup which is absolutely phenomenal (though it may have been just a little salty); what kills me about their soups is that they serve it in extra large bowls but your actual serving may only fill 1/3 of that bowl- so are we actually paying for the soup or the bowl rental because the serving you get can be no more than that of a regular sized can of Campbell's soup! Call me greedy, say what you want but if I see a large bowl come out the kitchen I'm expecting a good amount of soup to be IN that bowl. Here's a thought: sell an appetizer sized soup AND an entree sized soup - this way you can fill up that bowl a little more.My friend had the shrimp and grits entree and it was very good, the grits (this time) were not so runny that you had to eat it with a spoon. This time you could actually eat the grits with your fork which I personally love! The problem was with my simple Caesar Salad with shrimp; I have NEVER eaten a Caesar Salad made with regular iceberg lettuce and what's worse is they used more of the core than the outer green parts of the lettuce which gives you more of the white and sometimes yellow lettuce that doesn't really taste good. To make matters worse they piled on the Parmesan which totally overwhelmed the dish. I added shrimp and they were the best part of the salad but I must say its totally annoying that they come on a stick. How does one go about ruining a salad? Well folks, all of the above!I've been here countless times and I've had some not so great experiences on both the service side and the food side but I've also had some pretty good experiences as well... Funny thing is I was never compelled to write about those experiences until ""simple simply sucked""!  The Caesar Salad may be one of the simplest items on the menu which raises my question, how and why do you mess up simple? This is a restaurant in my neighborhood and I sincerely want it to be better! I will continue to support and pray for more hits than misses! I just hope someone in management is really reading reviews and taking notes. You have to do better, you have to want to do better because your customers deserve better.",2.0

"My new go to place for brunch, simply because its close to my church and I'm able to beat the crowd. I see a lot of reviewers complaining about the service and food.

"Okay I traveled all the way from Long Island to Peaches.   Well, I ordered the shrimp and grits and the grits were served rather watery.  I told my server and she told me her manager said ""well that's how they came out today and there is nothing they can do about it... would I like a side order""  really?  Thats your response. .. horrible!  So I am not one to cause a scene but trust me I will never patronize their establishment again.  I knew I should have gone to SoCo.",2.0

It was cute that they had water already at the table but I would have liked if we had ice. I ordered the salmon with a side of grits and my friend ordered the chicken. Our food was delayed but we were offered a complimentary drink. Our food was nothing to brag about but I'm from the South so I might have high expectations. The grits were bland. I probably wouldn't go to this restaurant again for dinner but maybe I would try the brunch.,2.0
"The food and drinks were really, really good but you have to go through HELL to get it. H-E-L-L. All caps necessary. We were a party of 6 and 5 of us were there while the other was literally 4 stops away from us. Someone needs to do something about that hostess (tall, light-skinned, curly hair) cause she swears she owns that estblishment. The hostess RUDELY replied ""We only seat full parties."" and abruptly turned around and walked away. GIRL! So once our last friend came we still waited 20 minutes even though we were the *only* people waiting and a few tables were clear. Oh my god. We're finally sat down and the waiter takes forever to greet and get us drinks. Then we wait forever for those drinks to come out. *deep sigh*  I ordered the Bed Stuy love Affair, it was fantastic. Then we finally ordered our food and THAT took forever. The waiter did not even think to check our drinks/water/upsell and see how we were overall doing. i also felt as though he thought we were stupid cause his tone of voice and looks on his face were not so pleasant.Why did appetizers and entrees come out together?! There was no room on the damn table for all of our dishes. I mean, what? I had the salmon with succotash and edamame and it was perfect. Cooked well, right amount of seasoning, perfect portion, just fantastic. We obviously opted out of dessert cause by the time that came out, it would be breakfast.It wasn't by choice that my friends and I were the last people to leave the restaurant.My friend had a simliar experience as well with a different server who didn't seem to want to help her table of girls at all. At all! The waitress was definitely paying attention to a table of guys though. She jokingly said to me ""Next time I'll just write a dick on the tip line of the check. Bitch."" LOL!I won't be coming back.",2.0
"A reliable standard in the neighborhood. The grits dishes, BBQ or fried fish are delicious. Last time we visited, we loved the Simple Salad. It can get crowded at times and they seem to still struggle with serving customers when that happens. They can't seem to keep the better waiters and waitresses. I hope that changes, since I think it is why we now go there less than we once did.",3.0
"I always order the grits & shrimp whenever I go to this place. Sometimes it's great. Sometimes it's bad. Do not get the gumbo. It is pretty bland. I do, however, love their Brownstone punch.",3.0
"Went here on Saturday afternoon and was underwhelmed.  The service is truly lacking.  There is no reason one has to repeatedly ask for water, silverware or plastic bags.  The food was ok no complaints but nothing to write to write home about either.  The appetizers came out in a decent time but the entrees took long and the server didn't seem to acknowledge that.  I find that lackluster service tends to be prevalent in popular neighborhood eateries.  As a result, I don't see any reason to recommend or return.",2.0
"As a native of Bed Stuy, Brooklyn I have always tried to support local business and the fact that Peaches is right up the block from where I grew up I'm surprised it took me this long! I've been a few times (3) and honestly I don't really have any thing to complain about... The staff is pleasant, the drinks are on point & the food is pretty good! Brunch or early dinner is my favorite... The ambiance definitely is date night ready or girls night chic!This is not the Bed-Stuy Do-or-Die of my childhood it's evolved into Bedford Stuyvesant and Peaches is surely a fine example of that change!",3.0
"This used to be my go to spot for years but now I just don't love it anymore. The food and atmosphere used to be great but the last few times I have visited I wasn't satisfied with the food. My favorite used to be the catfish and cheese grits and short ribs. Also, I went to the restroom and one was out of order and the other someone had vomited all over the place. I let a staff member know and no one bothered to clean it up. They are going to lose a lot of business if they don't get it together.",3.0
"The service is okay. Not extra friendly but efficient. I would recommend the chicken wings, nicely flavored and tasty. I also frequent the bar next door that's an extension to peaches and they serve $5 beer and shots which is cool for a quick chat with a friend or if you watch sports, their flat screen is there. Not extremely spacious so there should be long waits in a tight space so plan ahead and go early:)",3.0
"Since last review, I have been back.  Different bartender and she was awesome.  Second time I meatloaf and mashed potatoes and loved it.First time  I had the wings which were good price but not Spivey enough for me.  Their happy hour is good because you can get a Jamaican lager for $3.  Where else can you do that?",5.0
I love this place its 2 blocks from my house and does not deliver but id rather go there and get take out then any other place on seemless or grubhub. i love the gumbo. Well everything taste great.,5.0
This spot is super cute. I've gone both in the summer when i've eaten outside in the patio and in the winter seated indoors. The service is a toss up...the second time I went our waitress was inattentive and seemed like she had an attitude. The food is good...but honestly i've had better soul/southern food in BK. The drinks are really good...and made perfectly. Overall the crowed is mixed...as well as the music which was nice. It's a cute date spot especially if you're seated outside under the lanterns/christmas lights.,3.0
"I went to Peaches for the first (and most likely the last time) yesterday for dinner and had the WORSE experience ever. Once seated, our waitress (Christina) took  over drinks. Waited a while for drinks and she then took our food order. A whole hour later, we're still waiting on our food. Why? It seems our waitress forgot to put in the order and gave us some lame excuse about the kitchen staff. That would make sense if the other tables that were occupied after us were not getting their food either, but that was clearly not the case. To make matters worse, as we're leaving someone shots to the kitchen to cancel the order to our table, obviously because they just received it before we decided to leave. HORRIBLE service, I'd love to comment on the food if we actually received any.",1.0
"The service was good. The food was okay. Long story short, I'd give it another shot.",3.0

"Long story short, the drinks took 40 minutes even though I was seated at the bar. People ordered food next to me who came in after me.  I had the worst Bloody Mary I ever had (pepper sauce? EEK! did i ask for that?). I ordered the Caesar salad appetizer which had so much cheese you could not taste anything else. I love cheese but dayummmmm! Even though I did not eat it, I still was made to pay for it. Not to mention, the appetizer came out at the same time as the shrimp & grits entree so now i have two big plates of food in front of me. I had every intention on taking home the salad once they arrived together. Once I got a taste of the salad, It became garbage. The shrimp & grits were good. Although, they were definitely not the best thing I ever ate or even close. $56 later for a caesar salad I did not eat, a bloody mary that I did not drink, a mimosa that I did not want, a heineken, & two shots of cuervo for my happy friend who got the best deal out of us both. The thing that bothers me more then anything, I knew the girl behind the bar!! I realize it was busy but that Brooklyn in me is seriously questioning whether I should take it personal. At any rate, I will never go here again on a sunday. I doubt I will ever go here again period if i'm paying. No. I did not leave a tip. I always tip but dammit a tip is not a hand out. It should be earned & when I left there feeling like I did the only tip I have is ""next time treat me like a stranger"".",1.0
"WOW! All I can say is I wish Bay Ridge had a place like this! I was in the area and someone recommended Peaches. I'm glad I listened. This place has a great atmosphere, super friendly service and one of the best Kale salads I've had. I also love the décor. Very clean",5.0
"So sad and disappointed! The wait was so extreme and long we started to get the shakes!!!! My stomach was growling so loud u could literally hear it over the music!

"GAWD! Where do I begin...hmmmm okay so I went to Peaches with several people over the weekend...MISTAKE! I had been to Peaches 1 time before and It wasn't very memorable, but I didn't remember it being gawd awful so I thought ""why not?""So guess what? Their service is the PITTS of life! My fiance and I joined 2 friends and the waitress ignored our existence for at least 7 minutes. No, it wasn't busy at all, and yes, I was dying of thirst and feeling very annoyed. Even if she was busy all she had to do was simply stop by and say ""be right with you guys."" So she finally strolled up 10 minutes later, no greeting for us...just a ""are you guys ready to order""...ummm yes fool, we have had a century to look at the menu so of course we are ready to order! In other news, we did receive our food pretty fast which I appreciated. But our waitress failed to come back and ask us if we needed anything so of course we had to call this amateur over for drinks and condiments. I took it upon myself to politely inform her that checking back with your table is a part of service and very important. She said okay and smiled.....whatever. The food:I had a cheese burger and sweet potato fries. The fries were mediocre but the honey I dipped them in was good. The burger was simply okay. Nothing to write home about.My fiance had the catfish sandwich and BBQ seasoned fries. She said the sandwich was good and I tried the BBQ fries and they were GREAT! I really loved the seasoning.One of my friends had the BBQ ribs. They were very dry. I would have sent them back but she, for some unknown reason, ate them anyways. My other friend had the shrimp and grits but substituted the grits for mashed potatoes. She loved it! I tasted the potatoes. They were pretty good.Dessert:Brownie with ice cream: the brownie was DRY!!! My friend ate it anyways. Apple pie and ice cream: womp. Not sweet, seemed like it was made 2 days ago. The moral of this story: Do NOT go to Peaches. Ever. unless you want the BBQ seasoned fries, but I really don't think it's worth the trouble. Beyond annoyed that I wasted 1 hour and 1/2  of my life in there. I am not sure why the managers have not trained their wait staff on the basics of service!!! Hello, it's not rocket science, Greet your table, tell the you will be with them shortly if you are busy, check on them soon after the food is delivered to make sure they have what they need, follow up a 2nd time to make sure they are okay and don't want more to drink, follow up a last time to ask about dessert and deliver the check. Wow,  that seems simple!p.s. I am generally a good tipper, meaning 20% or more for great service. I did not give 20% but my friends did.

"Ok so like the other reviewers said...Peaches is pretty much hit or miss.  Came here today with my family and it was packed. After about a 15min wait we were seated and 1 of the 1st thing I noticed were the MASSIVE amount of flies in the establishment. No seriously. Like everywhere. On the banquets on the light fixtures...omg. I sort of wanted to leave but everyone else was starving blah blah.But alas, the food was good just the CONSTANT swatting of the flies was annoying and distracting. I asked our server (who was nice) why there were more flies inside than outside and she replied they like to keep the door open for fresh air-_-Sorry Peaches, I like ya, maybe I'll come back in the winter when the flies die off...smh",3.0
Not very good but it's edible so I won't complain much. The mac and cheese was burning hot (quite good when it cooled down) while the shrimp po'boy was barely lukewarm. I ate a burger which I don't know if it was that I was starving by the time my food arrived (the mac and shrimp came out for my guest first) but that was one delicious burger:). I had a drink to accompany my meal which is what I give two stars to and one to the food. I might return here only to have a drink... I suggest if you're in the area try and go somewhere else but definitely return here for some spirits.,3.0

"Went here for brunch yesterday and it was GREAT! We walked in around 11:30 and were seated right away... I'm pretty sure we beat the crowd because by the time we were leaving the inside and patio were packed. The food is really tasty, went with a party of four and we all shared entrees. The list is as follows: asparagus and mini crab cakes for starters, Jim Cade breakfast (French toast, eggs, grits, bacon), eggs Benedict, crab cake sandwich. Over all it was a good experience the entree portions are huge, there was a live jazz band, they have outdoor seating, and the staff is really friendly. I gave it a four because they do not allow substitutions AT ALL if you want something different you have to order it as a side which is like 4/5 bucks... I don't know that really bugged me. Also their drink menu isn't that appealing and what's brunch without a nice cocktail?",4.0
"Brunch was great! I ordered something toward the bottom of the menu that came with almond crusted French toast, bacon, eggs, cheesy grits, and fruit. The service was wonderful and they didn't even charge my friend extra for turkey bacon-- the way so many restaurants tend to. The space was a bit congested; the shoes were really close... so close that we could heard everything the people on either side were discussing. But it was overall a good experience.",4.0
"My boyfriend and I had brunch here two Sundays ago for the second time. We liked Peaches enough the first time to come back many months later. For starters, the menu was more expensive than we remembered. And there was no price fix menu as there was last time.I had the sausage omelet.  It was not very good. It had turkey sausage, caramelized onions, cheddar cheese, red peppers and absolutely no flavor. The home fries were terrible. They were severely under-salted. The salad was good, but really just a couple leaves really for garnish. My boyfriend had the farmers omelet.  He thought it was okay.  He had the grits instead of the homefries.  I tried them, delicious!!!The atmosphere is really cute. I like the idea of Peaches, but for the quality and price, I might as well go to a diner. I don't know that I'll be back.",2.0

"Ok so like the other reviewers said...Peaches is pretty much hit or miss.  Came here today with my family and it was packed. After about a 15min wait we were seated and 1 of the 1st thing I noticed were the MASSIVE amount of flies in the establishment. No seriously. Like everywhere. On the banquets on the light fixtures...omg. I sort of wanted to leave but everyone else was starving blah blah.But alas, the food was good just the CONSTANT swatting of the flies was annoying and distracting. I asked our server (who was nice) why there were more flies inside than outside and she replied they like to keep the door open for fresh air-_-Sorry Peaches, I like ya, maybe I'll come back in the winter when the flies die off...smh",3.0
Not very good but it's edible so I won't complain much. The mac and cheese was burning hot (quite good when it cooled down) while the shrimp po'boy was barely lukewarm. I ate a burger which I don't know if it was that I was starving by the time my food arrived (the mac and shrimp came out for my guest first) but that was one delicious burger:). I had a drink to accompany my meal which is what I give two stars to and one to the food. I might return here only to have a drink... I suggest if you're in the area try and go somewhere else but definitely return here for some spirits.,3.0

"Went here for brunch yesterday and it was GREAT! We walked in around 11:30 and were seated right away... I'm pretty sure we beat the crowd because by the time we were leaving the inside and patio were packed. The food is really tasty, went with a party of four and we all shared entrees. The list is as follows: asparagus and mini crab cakes for starters, Jim Cade breakfast (French toast, eggs, grits, bacon), eggs Benedict, crab cake sandwich. Over all it was a good experience the entree portions are huge, there was a live jazz band, they have outdoor seating, and the staff is really friendly. I gave it a four because they do not allow substitutions AT ALL if you want something different you have to order it as a side which is like 4/5 bucks... I don't know that really bugged me. Also their drink menu isn't that appealing and what's brunch without a nice cocktail?",4.0
"Brunch was great! I ordered something toward the bottom of the menu that came with almond crusted French toast, bacon, eggs, cheesy grits, and fruit. The service was wonderful and they didn't even charge my friend extra for turkey bacon-- the way so many restaurants tend to. The space was a bit congested; the shoes were really close... so close that we could heard everything the people on either side were discussing. But it was overall a good experience.",4.0
"My boyfriend and I had brunch here two Sundays ago for the second time. We liked Peaches enough the first time to come back many months later. For starters, the menu was more expensive than we remembered. And there was no price fix menu as there was last time.I had the sausage omelet.  It was not very good. It had turkey sausage, caramelized onions, cheddar cheese, red peppers and absolutely no flavor. The home fries were terrible. They were severely under-salted. The salad was good, but really just a couple leaves really for garnish. My boyfriend had the farmers omelet.  He thought it was okay.  He had the grits instead of the homefries.  I tried them, delicious!!!The atmosphere is really cute. I like the idea of Peaches, but for the quality and price, I might as well go to a diner. I don't know that I'll be back.",2.0
"You know... I've been here so many times but this time I finally decided to write a review. I went to Peaches this past weekend with a friend from out of town. I go in early Saturday afternoon during brunch hours. I knew it would be packed but was actually seated as soon as we walk in. I always hear people complain about the service but I had no complaints. My server was always available, was able to give me a run down of the desserts off hand, and checked on me often. I ordered the blackened salmon with grits and salsa. Amaze!! I had this same dish some years ago but this time, I felt like I was somewhere down in the Delta. The sweet tea even taste like sweet tea! My friend ordered the platter and if I can say one thing about the french toast...it would be that they made me never want to leave. Peaches got me this time. Officially a real fan...",5.0

"Hidden gem in Bed-Stuy, is this Brunch restaurant.  I often host and participate in a girl's brunch about every other week on average.  I have my local favorites in Bayside, Queens when brunching with my bbf.  But I also try different places all over Queens, Astoria (yes, I do not consider Astoria part of queens in my opinion), the city and Brooklyn.  I always order my favorites either eggs benedict, steak & eggs or brunch burgers.  Occasionally, I try a slight variation of my favorite dishes to critique the restaurant's style.  At peaches, I ordered a peaches benedict.  There are no peaches in this dish despite the name.  It's regular benedict over smoked salmon on brioche served with cheddar grits.  I was very happy with my meal and so were all my gfs with their orders of the usual breakfast items with sides of sweet potato fries, collard greens and others that I don't recall.  1 gf had a crabcake burger.  I think we was a little disappointed but for very forgivable reasons.  You'll never find a maryland lump crapcake for this price outside of Maryland or Capecod, or any seafood specialty joint.  I've been to Maryland and had to try their crabcakes and the cheapest crabcake I could find was $12 and boy was it amazing!  Same concept as trying to find a comparable New England Clam Chowder in NYC for the same price you would pay in Boston...good luck.  However, once and a while you do find these treasures and that would be the Cheese Grits here.  I was in New Orleans last year and had the best Shrimp and Grits at the Court of Two Sisters.  No where else in NOLA or NYC can match that.  Of course, I've also had some average grits in NOLA and Peaches' grits does match up well.  *Show up early, like 11am.  You'll get a seat with no wait.  12pm and after, you'll see the crowd and they stay there for a few hours.*Trendy place but out of the way unless you live in the area.*Price is average like any other Manhattan brunch.  PrixFixe specials or drink inclusions that I'm used to in Bayside.*Oh forgot to mention, I was there an hour early so I was sitting up at the bar.  Ordered a well drink (screw driver) and their fried potatoes.  Potates were overall good but could've stayed in the over a bit longer for a fluffier center.  Screwdriver was a well drink, if I knew I was going to be charge $9 for that, I would've ordered a signature drink instead.  I think one of the gfs wasn't too satisfied with her peach snapps based drink.  Her taste was for something stronger.  That would've been perfect for me tho.  She should've swapped with my screwdriver.",4.0

"How did I stumble upon Peaches? I was looking for a good Sunday Brunch. I usually go to Brunch looking to drink unlimited mimosas or sangria with my Breakfast/lunch but this time I opted to go to a place that serves great food instead especially since my cousin was visiting from Florida. I went to Peaches after being referred to it by 4 other people after posting the question on Facebook.The food was amazing! Best Brunch food I've had to date. I ordered the LowCountry Omelette which was a crab omelette, (a first for me) & I was pleasantly surprised. I also had a drink called The Brownstone punch, I believe (don't quote me), but one or two of those are all you need for a good Buzz! The Service was Great and efficient. Nice ambiance. Great place to go for brunch on a Sunday! Very Beautiful restaurant in Bedstuy. My cousin absolutely loved it as well. All in all, I'd definitely go again.",4.0
"My family and I recently went to Peaches for dinner on a Thursday evening.  We were a group of 7 (5 adults, 2 kids) and realizing we were a large party we tried to make reservations.  When we called, they said they don't take reservations.  Ok.So we show up and and are told it will be ""about a 15 minute wait.""

"How did I stumble upon Peaches? I was looking for a good Sunday Brunch. I usually go to Brunch looking to drink unlimited mimosas or sangria with my Breakfast/lunch but this time I opted to go to a place that serves great food instead especially since my cousin was visiting from Florida. I went to Peaches after being referred to it by 4 other people after posting the question on Facebook.The food was amazing! Best Brunch food I've had to date. I ordered the LowCountry Omelette which was a crab omelette, (a first for me) & I was pleasantly surprised. I also had a drink called The Brownstone punch, I believe (don't quote me), but one or two of those are all you need for a good Buzz! The Service was Great and efficient. Nice ambiance. Great place to go for brunch on a Sunday! Very Beautiful restaurant in Bedstuy. My cousin absolutely loved it as well. All in all, I'd definitely go again.",4.0

"Peaches is a hit or a miss: One day you can go and thoroughly enjoy your meal there, and another day, you'll leave vowing to never return. A lot of this has to do with the service. There are times that I've gone where I felt an air of 'tude permeated the establishment (from the hostess on down to the other diners--indeed, sometimes I've felt ""shade"" from some of the other patrons). I'll admit that I've only been to Peaches for brunch, which, because of its popularity in the neighborhood (I can't determine if this is due to it being one of the few brunch spots in the nabe) can get crowded easily and fast. I walk past Peaches every day on my way home from work (after 7p) and I always notice a nice dinner crowd. One day I will try to have dinner at Peaches during the week to check out the scene. In regards to the food: I've never disliked any of my meals at Peaches, however, I've also never been blown away either. One thing I'd like to note, is that their drinks are strong...and in a good way.

"where to start? I've been meaning to go to peaches since like 09. This evening I finally got a chance to go with a good friend of mine. The ambiance was great, the music just as good. We ordered drinks and a starter plate right away. My friend got his wine and starter plate but 15-20 minutes in, no cocktail for moi. Finally we got our main dish and I just canceled the drink. They give me the drink for free citing that the bartender is new. The food was on point, not gonna lie. I ordered the pulled pork, cole slaw and mashed potatoes. My friend also liked his meatloaf dish.We decided to get some tea and coffee and were told it was gonna be 15 minutes for the coffee. We say cool. Tea comes, still no coffee. 20 minutes pass, I finish my tea and we ask for the check. After all, we got things to do. Getting the check took an additional 15 minutes or so. Luckily for us, the tea was on the house. We paid and bounced up out of there. Little miss waitress was nice but frazzled.  They are clearly understaffed. Having even one more person would have made a world of difference in my opinion. Will I be back? Perhaps, if someone else is treating. will not be going out of my way to go. This was on a thursday. Imagine a weekend evening or brunch service.",2.0
"My fiance and I had a lovely dinner at Peaches last Friday. We ordered the trout w/cabbage, turkey meatloaf w/mashed potatoes and collard greens served in a white wine sauce w/sundried tomatoes and white beans. And we took home the rice pudding - simply lovely! They took the time to brulee the top and garnish with roasted glazed peaches. OMG... to die for. The absolute best meatloaf I've ever had. And my Granny made some good damn meatloaf. The only issue was the loong wait and waiting in a crowded doorway which blocked the bathrooms. If only that area were organized better people would know where to go for pick-up and where to go while waiting for a table.

"I live fairly close to  Peaches and it's a definite go-to spot especially if you are a Bed-Stuy resident.  First off, the ambiance is pretty cute and reminds me of someone's living room.  The host staff, although  not super friendly, are nice enough and even when its crowded you can get seated fairly quickly.  They also play a mix of old and new soul music which is pretty relaxing after a long day.  As far as the food is concerned, its definitely tasty and they have a decent variety at reasonable prices.  Drinks are made with love and can vary in potency depending on who the bartender is.  Wait staff can also be hit or miss as they sometimes forget orders or leave your food out until it gets cold.  (They need to work on that).  Despite a few service issues, I'm a Peaches fan as its a great place for a date, dinner with girlfriends or even if you want to dine alone.   I'll definitely be returning",3.0
"I used to go exclusively to get the fish and grits. I've tried other things on the menue, and they were all mediocre at best.

They said they were backed up with orders.That's seriously enough for me to never go back ever again.Save your damn money. This joint only gets business because there isn't much competition in the area yet. They are also trying to monopolize the neighborhood with their ish. Not cute.",2.0

"Delicious comfort food, shrimp and grits were amazing. We also had Mac and cheese and corn bread both outstanding. Also they have very interesting drinks and beer. Cute little restaurant in Brooklyn, a little out of the way, but worth the trip.",5.0
"Yum, yum, yum!!! I really enjoyed this place. The ambiance is cool, always great music playing and great lighting. The wait time can be a bit annoying if you come on the weekend as this place can be popular. I advise anyone going to get the shrimp and grits- regardless of if you go for brunch, lunch or dinner. It's always on the menu and always delicious. Be sure if you have plans to meet friends there that you guys clarify in advance if you are going to the Peaches on Lewis or on Tompkins (with a slightly different name, but still called Peaches). The menu is slightly different between the two, but fear not- The shrimp and grits is available at both:-)",4.0

"Peaches is a hit or a miss: One day you can go and thoroughly enjoy your meal there, and another day, you'll leave vowing to never return. A lot of this has to do with the service. There are times that I've gone where I felt an air of 'tude permeated the establishment (from the hostess on down to the other diners--indeed, sometimes I've felt ""shade"" from some of the other patrons). I'll admit that I've only been to Peaches for brunch, which, because of its popularity in the neighborhood (I can't determine if this is due to it being one of the few brunch spots in the nabe) can get crowded easily and fast. I walk past Peaches every day on my way home from work (after 7p) and I always notice a nice dinner crowd. One day I will try to have dinner at Peaches during the week to check out the scene. In regards to the food: I've never disliked any of my meals at Peaches, however, I've also never been blown away either. One thing I'd like to note, is that their drinks are strong...and in a good way. Kudos to their bartenders (as well as ""The Bar at Peaches"" where I've had the chance to enjoy a few drinks this past summer).",3.0
Food is good but service SUCKS! kristen is nice however we keep going back because the boyfriend and i enjoy the food and we keep hoping the service would be good but each and every time its awful! the service there gives bad a good name.if they only had good service i'd even add another star and did we mention how bad the service is ...?bad...bad..bad..,2.0
"where to start? I've been meaning to go to peaches since like 09. This evening I finally got a chance to go with a good friend of mine. The ambiance was great, the music just as good. We ordered drinks and a starter plate right away. My friend got his wine and starter plate but 15-20 minutes in, no cocktail for moi. Finally we got our main dish and I just canceled the drink. They give me the drink for free citing that the bartender is new. The food was on point, not gonna lie. I ordered the pulled pork, cole slaw and mashed potatoes. My friend also liked his meatloaf dish.We decided to get some tea and coffee and were told it was gonna be 15 minutes for the coffee. We say cool. Tea comes, still no coffee. 20 minutes pass, I finish my tea and we ask for the check. After all, we got things to do. Getting the check took an additional 15 minutes or so. Luckily for us, the tea was on the house. We paid and bounced up out of there. Little miss waitress was nice but frazzled.  They are clearly understaffed. Having even one more person would have made a world of difference in my opinion. Will I be back? Perhaps, if someone else is treating. will not be going out of my way to go. This was on a thursday. Imagine a weekend evening or brunch service.",2.0
"My fiance and I had a lovely dinner at Peaches last Friday. We ordered the trout w/cabbage, turkey meatloaf w/mashed potatoes and collard greens served in a white wine sauce w/sundried tomatoes and white beans. And we took home the rice pudding - simply lovely! They took the time to brulee the top and garnish with roasted glazed peaches. OMG... to die for. The absolute best meatloaf I've ever had. And my Granny made some good damn meatloaf. The only issue was the loong wait and waiting in a crowded doorway which blocked the bathrooms. If only that area were organized better people would know where to go for pick-up and where to go while waiting for a table. We were far enough away from the door to avoid having coated people standing next to our table while waiting. Can't wait to try the brunch!!",4.0

"*sigh* after the dismal experience I had at Hothouse I told myself I'd never wander into any establishment with the name Peaches or owned by the same people (that goes for the smoke joint, and whatever else they own), but alas....it was raining, we didn't have an umbrella and my friend was concerned about her wig getting wet. We peered in, the bar was empty and grabbed two seats.I ordered a Honey Jack Daniels straight. Now, the first time I had ever had this was the night before and it had a very distinct smooth and sweet warming sensation....that didn't stop until I finished.....THIS drink however, did not have the same distinct flavor I was expecting, to which I could say one of two things:1. maybe jack daniels had an off day and this particular batch wasn't as good as the rest OR and mostly likely,2. it was watered down.I say most likely because the VERY FIRST THING I noticed when I got the drink was that the color was off. So color AND taste....hmmmm..... It really takes a lot for me to make such an accusation, that's how STRANGE this was, and I watched the bartender pour it from the bottle....to buy a little more time, I, like damn fool, ordered the Mac and Cheese....Now, Mac and Cheese is hit or miss at any establishment....if its a miss it's completely my fault b/c I truly know better......but not only did they horribly miss, but it was insulting that they bought it out, ICE COLD! Whenever they made this mac and cheese... 2 or 3 days ago, they couldn't pop it in the microwave for 60 seconds??

So despite all that, I decided to give Peaches another go two days ago. Big mistake! Do not order the arugula salad. They put rancid blue cheese on it. When I complained, the owner questioned my palate and said that it was supposed to taste that way. I've had my fair share of strong and stinky cheese, and I've never had anything taste that terrible.

I ordered it as an entree and it was an inexpensive and well portioned dish.Shrimp and grits $14 - one of the menu standouts. creamy, classic grits have their ante upped by shrimp in a white wine sauce with mushrooms. mmm.

"Peaches brunch is incredible. I live around the corner, so I invited some  friends, downed a couple of the massive mixed drinks (they're served in those same large water cups), and floated on with the then harmonious bed stuy vibe thanks to a diverse crowd and a sweet live jazz band that played.Their menu is best characterized by taking a gourmet look at 'low brow' southern favorites. Some of my menu favorites: Pulled pork and sweet potato hash $7 - wow. innovative, decadent, and delicious take on southern cuisine. I ordered it as an entree and it was an inexpensive and well portioned dish.Shrimp and grits $14 - one of the menu standouts. creamy, classic grits have their ante upped by shrimp in a white wine sauce with mushrooms. mmm. Fruit and yogurt plate $6 - seems simple but is fantastically executed and is a nice healthy thing to share",5.0

"I can definitely understand the bad reviews. In the restaurant business it is a flip of the coin. I went to this restaurant when it first opened and would have gave it about 2.5 stars for service and for food maybe 3 stars. Since then I have went back with different groups of people at different times and different days of the week. All who I took here enjoyed their meal and drinks and the service. Each visit with one exception I had my small child and we were accommodated. Keep in my mind the visits were with men, women, older, younger, black, white and from different parts of NYC. I did the Happy Hour last time I visited and was waited on by a guy that did a great job making the drinks, prompt service, no issues with the bill and he was humorous. he did spill some alcohol but no bartender is perfect all the time and he didn't spill my cup. I have sampled various meals and have my faves. One thing I always do is try a new dish or stick to a fave. When they have a new dish it is always good. As for drinks they never disappoint. If you have problems with the wait get a menu before seated and order as you are being seated. it also helps to tell the waiter/waitress you want appetizers at that very moment. I have been to many places and always wait a long time to be served or had horrible service. Peaches is still one of my fave neighborhood spot.",4.0

"I live down the block so I want this place to succeed, be all it can etc. They have had service problems since day 1 and on repeated visits its never improved.  Food is slow to come out.  Staff is slow to respond to needs.  Slow to fill a glass of water.  Slow to take the money.  Slow.The food is better, they've always made a good trout, and their affiliation with the BBQ place means they have ok BBQ.  But there's a lot of it that just greasy and fatty.   The drinks have been hit or miss, sometimes they are proper stout cocktails with actual liquor in them and sometimes you wonder if they put ny at all.

"My friend invited me to Peaches for her birthday dinner and I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the food. Despite having to wait 1 hour to be seated (get there before 7), I enjoyed my time here. The waiters were very attentive, making sure all of our needs were met. We sat in the patio area since it was warm out and It was the perfect time to catch up with old friends. I do not remember what entree I had but  the grilled asparagus, wings, and mashed potatoes were all very good. I also went for brunch and lunch which were both great!  If you are in the neighborhood, give it a try! To avoid the crowd, skip dinner and go for lunch.",4.0

"Best $21 rib eye steak ever. The shrimp and grits could have been a little better.

The artichoke dip has one layer of cheese on the top and the rest is artichoke, spinach, and garlic.  I'm going back to try the steak and something else again, but I hope its not a 1 for 3'er again.

I live around the corner and literally every time i go there there's new staffing and they get less and less personable. And that's including the main manager.

We had the sweet and spicy wings for appetizer... mmmmmmm, sooo good, not too spicy, just purrrrrfect, yes I'm purring. For dinner I had the pulled pork sandwich and sweet potato fries. Oh My God, the SWEET POTATO FRIES!!! Delicious! Soft but not mushy, crispy but not hard. Best sweet potato fries I've ever had.

"I decided to take a friend to brunch for her birthday yesterday. Big mistake!!

After being seated we waited 10- 15 minutes before anyone even came to the table.  our server Tiara took the adjacent tables order before ours, we were clearly sat before them. At this point i just wanted to eat and leave.

After telling Tiara we didn't want the drinks we just wanted to pay and leave...there were no apologies for the mistake just more waiting as we waited another 10-15 for the bill and for her to process it... at this point i was just annoyed and frustrated and had to stand outside. Three times a charm for me. The only positive thing about this experience was the food but if I wanted only good food i would stay home and cook...Management needs to step up the quality of service and quick.

"Peaches serves a version of ""southern"" food, not soul food, but the expected fare that one would find in the south in your average cafe or neighborhood restaurant. The food ranges from adequate to good for selected dishes (try the gumbo or the  pulled pork hash (brunch)). Service is spotty at best. There are times when it is a guessing game as to who is your actual server. It seems the staff and management are more impressed with working there than considering the customers needs. Actually, this attitude carries over to their other locations as well.One word of warning: If you are interested in having an early dinner (say between 5 and 6 p.m.) better call first. My wife and I made the mistake twice in the past month of stopping by after getting off of the A train at Utica around 5:30 p.m. Both times there was a message taped to the door saying they would be opening around 7 p.m. There was no apologies for the inconvenience, much less an explanation.

"OK- so  normally i would give 5 stars- i love peaches, particularly for brunch and my friends and I go faithfully every week- however, it lost 2 stars because now that its summer, i have to say, it kills me that as much as I love the food there (I am addicted to the sweet potatoe fries) I literally melted in there today! I mean, its 98 degrees outside, and it felt even worse in there. All of my butter was melted before I could even put it on my toast (im not kidding) and I asked for more but the waitress showed me that all the other little packets of butter were melted too, I half ate my food in a mad rush as the sweat dripped down my shirt, and wanted to run to my car just to get some AC, (but i gave my debit card to the waitress who took about 15-20 mins to return with it)- It was so uncomfortable I simply couldnt enjoy my food.Im so disappointed but it was so bad (the heat) that Im thinking we may have to find a new spot for summer brunch and maybe do Peaches in fall and winter :/ok-7/24/11- they have redeemed themselves so i added back one star- they seemed to have taken care of the air, and it was very cool in there today - we ate and enjoyed the buffalo wings and of course sweet potato fries! now i can have my Peaches all summer yayyy",4.0
I went here months ago and have been wanting to go back ever since. I had the cod fish..

The food was absolutely scrumptious!  I started out with the Smoked Chicken and Sausage Gumbo.  I asked the server if I could share it and she actually brought it back in 2 smaller bowls.  The smaller bowl was just enough for me.  The gumbo was perfectly seasoned and it had just enough heat (not too spicy).  I ordered the Shrimp Po Boy and it was delicious!  The bread was perfectly grilled and there was plenty of shrimp with remoulade on the sandwich.  The restaurant is small but it has a great ambiance and the prices are very reasonable.   I will make sure that I visit again and when I return to New York.,4.0
I really want Peaches to win but the service here is the worst. I've been here three times and they have messed up my order all three times. The wait to be served at a table is ridiculous. I dine out frequently and this is by far the worst restaurant I've been to in Brooklyn. But I do want it to win because I actually like management and the location. I'm crossing my fingers.,2.0
"TEN DOLLAR BLOODY MARYS DURING BRUNCH HOURS, ON A WEEKEND.come on.  i dont care how many zagat's stickers you can post on the door, those are some Tavern on the Green prices .. you really have to question the audacity of a Bed-Stuy restaurant that is going to charge ten dollars for a bacon, egg, and cheese sandwich on a roll.  im not ready to drop big dollars for a decent meal in a ""restaurant"" with mediocre decorum and ambiance.  Price should equate to quality, something Peaches fails to recognize.  Do I sense a false sense of entitlement?our waiter was too busy orbiting Jupiter to have any clue what was happening .. Completely aloof, never present when needed ... but who could blame him?  considering the exorbitant prices for brunch, he'd be making a killing on the tip ... fantastic when another waiter had to take our credit card after our waiter was nowhere to be found .. he rang the card up but didn't bring the check to the table.  he noted calmly, ""sorry, but i'm not on the clock yet ..."" gfy pal.",1.0

I asked what time did they go into the dinner menu and was told 5pm. I then asked what time it was and the waiter did not know and the young lady at the ""computer"" ignored my question. So I asked HER again and she replied 4:45. Ok...so now everyone stands around looking lost. I suggest to the waiter that WE (My friend & I) be seated and perhaps mull over the menu and order drinks///that should cover the 15mins. *ingenious I know!We then get seated and proceeded to wait another 20min before putting in a drink order. Our waiter bailed on us somewhere during our meal which was totally fine because he seemed a bit lost. Oh a few drinks were unavailable (why are they on the menu) and the food was mediocre.",2.0
"Decent farm to table fair, though a little pricey for what you get. Excellent, balanced cocktails. Service was efficient and attentive without being intrusive. There was something off about the balsamic dressing of my salad, so snacked on two sides of kale instead, which was excellent, but $4 for two tablespoons of sauteed kale was a bit much.",2.0
"OK- so  normally i would give 5 stars- i love peaches, particularly for brunch and my friends and I go faithfully every week- however, it lost 2 stars because now that its summer, i have to say, it kills me that as much as I love the food there (I am addicted to the sweet potatoe fries) I literally melted in there today! I mean, its 98 degrees outside, and it felt even worse in there. All of my butter was melted before I could even put it on my toast (im not kidding) and I asked for more but the waitress showed me that all the other little packets of butter were melted too, I half ate my food in a mad rush as the sweat dripped down my shirt, and wanted to run to my car just to get some AC, (but i gave my debit card to the waitress who took about 15-20 mins to return with it)- It was so uncomfortable I simply couldnt enjoy my food.Im so disappointed but it was so bad (the heat) that Im thinking we may have to find a new spot for summer brunch and maybe do Peaches in fall and winter :/ok-7/24/11- they have redeemed themselves so i added back one star- they seemed to have taken care of the air, and it was very cool in there today - we ate and enjoyed the buffalo wings and of course sweet potato fries! now i can have my Peaches all summer yayyy",4.0
I went here months ago and have been wanting to go back ever since. I had the cod fish.. Scrumptious..We were a large group amd there were.smiles from every person at our table. the music was great..throw backs from the 90s. My only complaints were the long wait for our food and its kinda small but other than that..it was great,4.0
The food was absolutely scrumptious!  I started out with the Smoked Chicken and Sausage Gumbo.  I asked the server if I could share it and she actually brought it back in 2 smaller bowls.  The smaller bowl was just enough for me.  The gumbo was perfectly seasoned and it had just enough heat (not too spicy).  I ordered the Shrimp Po Boy and it was delicious!  The bread was perfectly grilled and there was plenty of shrimp with remoulade on the sandwich.  The restaurant is small but it has a great ambiance and the prices are very reasonable.   I will make sure that I visit again and when I return to New York.,4.0
I really want Peaches to win but the service here is the worst. I've been here three times and they have messed up my order all three times. The wait to be served at a table is ridiculous. I dine out frequently and this is by far the worst restaurant I've been to in Brooklyn. But I do want it to win because I actually like management and the location. I'm crossing my fingers.,2.0
"TEN DOLLAR BLOODY MARYS DURING BRUNCH HOURS, ON A WEEKEND.come on.  i dont care how many zagat's stickers you can post on the door, those are some Tavern on the Green prices .. you really have to question the audacity of a Bed-Stuy restaurant that is going to charge ten dollars for a bacon, egg, and cheese sandwich on a roll.  im not ready to drop big dollars for a decent meal in a ""restaurant"" with mediocre decorum and ambiance.  Price should equate to quality, something Peaches fails to recognize.  Do I sense a false sense of entitlement?our waiter was too busy orbiting Jupiter to have any clue what was happening .. Completely aloof, never present when needed ... but who could blame him?  considering the exorbitant prices for brunch, he'd be making a killing on the tip ... fantastic when another waiter had to take our credit card after our waiter was nowhere to be found .. he rang the card up but didn't bring the check to the table.  he noted calmly, ""sorry, but i'm not on the clock yet ..."" gfy pal.",1.0
"I'm not a huge fan of Soul food but I can make an exception for Peaches. I love the vibe of this BedStuy restaurant. I came there for Sunday brunch with my friends and all I have to say is thank god this place is right in my neighborhood and that we were smart to come early. The food and drinks were good, I enjoyed the catfish sandwich with my bubbly. Next time I'll come back for the french toast with the berries.",5.0
My wife and I were displaced by Sandy and  found temp housing almost right above Peaches.We have been going almost every night and I have made it through almost the complete menu and have loved it.The staff is so friendly and nice.

"Okay so I didn't what to go here but thank god I did. The Shrimp Po'Boy sandwich was great and I love love love the side sauce. It goes great with sweet potatoes.

"Food was okay, but service was slow and they were out of half the menu items.  We were there for almost 2 hours, but they gave us a discount as a result.  I suspect our order was lost or forgotten.  French toast had good flavor, but was very chewy, not sure if it was stale or overcooked.  Coffee was good and Shrimp and grits decent.  Having grown up in the south, I'm a bit picky with southern food, so I maybe biased.",3.0
"I was waffling briefly between three and four stars, because I tend to put more weight on food quality and less on service, but it was hard to ignore 1) the poor service and 2) the poor drinks. The bartender seemed to be quite frazzled. I was one of only three people at the bar, and they were just beginning to seat dinner service (slightly before 5) yet I waited for nearly 20 minutes for my drink! Only to find it was not very good. She didn't seem like she knew how to mix drinks well, and she was out of most common juices to mix with. It also took her about 25 minutes to get my order in because someone was doing something with the bar register. Luckily I was not in a rush. However, it seemed to me with all of the newly seated tables ordering and eating before my order even went in, that there must be a functioning register somewhere that their orders were going into - and couldn't she have gone there? The grits with broccoli, mushrooms and garlic were fantastic. The crab cakes were fine, nothing great and a bit overpriced for the size of the portion.",3.0

"Peaches is my go-to place for a reliable, always on point, delicious Sunday brunch!  I have never been disappointed by anything on the menu. . .the potato fries tasty, the shrimp po-boy and the catfish sandwiches have never disappointed.  Last Sunday my friend ordered the French toast and declared it the best she ever tasted. I've never sat at a table, preferring instead to sit at the bar.  The brownstone punch is a must drink with brunch!  Overall, my experience at Peaches has been wonderfully consistent and it is on my list as one of my favourite brunch spots in NYC.  Yes, it's crowded and you will have to wait for a table on a Sunday afternoon but it is worth the wait!  And really, if you are not waiting for a table at a brunch spot in Brooklyn on a nice Sunday afternoon you're probably not a brunch spot worth waiting for.",4.0
"Being a Southerner and living a few blocks from this place I occasionally go when I'm feeling really exhausted to cook better food than theirs. It's supposed to be Southern/Soul food but to me it just doesn't come anywhere close to my expectations and standards of Southern fare. Staples such as pork chops, collards, and fried chicken are either always under or over cooked. The beer list is minimal, with the liquor selection much better (they seem to prefer you be drinking the heavy stuff!). The sweet tea tastes like a powdered version, and that's disappointing, and the desserts feel more like New American than anything Southern I've ever had back home. The one saving grace is actually it's oddity- their custom brewed teas are amazing, but as I said really odd because custom teas aren't really the thing back South.

For a while it was my go to for neighborhood dates and out of town visitors, even having enjoyed a great New Year's Eve meal there. But more recently, the visits have been utterly disappointing -- One time ending with me and my two friends eating something that made all three of us violently ill and another time having a miscommunication with our server which lead to my food being plated with something that was not gluten-free (the fries, which I thought I had made clear I was not trying to have with my burger, having asked for mashed potatoes instead). They remade my food, but when my burger came back, minus the fries, it was over cooked and the mushrooms cold, plus they charged me for the mashed potatoes, which was ridiculous. Don't waste your time going to Peaches, there are other better options in the neighborhood -- Soul Food Kitchen and Saraghina being two great places to start.",2.0

And here I assumed any salad on the menu would be a ""filler"" (you know those restaurants that have a salad on the menu, just to have one?).  Thank you Peaches, for having a pretty diverse menu and for perfecting the artery-clogging meets ruffage balance in a meal that I so long for!",4.0

"I'm torn between giving them 2 or 3 stars -- had I written this last year it would have been 4 stars. For a while it was my go to for neighborhood dates and out of town visitors, even having enjoyed a great New Year's Eve meal there. But more recently, the visits have been utterly disappointing -- One time ending with me and my two friends eating something that made all three of us violently ill and another time having a miscommunication with our server which lead to my food being plated with something that was not gluten-free (the fries, which I thought I had made clear I was not trying to have with my burger, having asked for mashed potatoes instead). They remade my food, but when my burger came back, minus the fries, it was over cooked and the mushrooms cold, plus they charged me for the mashed potatoes, which was ridiculous. Don't waste your time going to Peaches, there are other better options in the neighborhood -- Soul Food Kitchen and Saraghina being two great places to start.",2.0
The manager is very rude I would never come back here don't care how the food is.The food was horrible the waiters were sweet i would never go backn there my sister had hair in her omlette and our wait was a hour and a half for bad food the omlettes was tiny and the poataoes was tasteless...,1.0
"This place is PHENOMENAL!!! The food, the staff and the ambience is great! Full of culture and great vibes!!

Im telling you , they will not disappoint because theyre ON POINT!",4.0
"Thank heavens I don't live any closer to this place!!! I've never had a bad experience at this place.  Service is always impeccable and timed well, the food is a consistent yum and they're always playing fabulous Motown tunes.  Not to mention, i'm always pleasantly surprised by there salad selection.  It's like nouveau-Southern cuisine -  I expected the menu to be mostly (if not totally) filled with fried food.  I love food, but I enjoy and appreciate a good salad.  Imagine my surprise when our waitress brought out the gorgeous tomato salad! And here I assumed any salad on the menu would be a ""filler"" (you know those restaurants that have a salad on the menu, just to have one?).  Thank you Peaches, for having a pretty diverse menu and for perfecting the artery-clogging meets ruffage balance in a meal that I so long for!",4.0

"I've been to Peaches Market in Stuy Heights 3 times now. The first was to satisfy a 9pm craving for coffee and dessert. Muonja and I loved the coffee, but didn't like the brownie that we shared. Although it was huge and came with ice cream, within a few minutes it was completely hard and impossible to cut with the knife. Better a steak knife, perhaps! Not to be deterred, we came back for dinner and really enjoyed it. We had the shrimp po' boy and some other fish, I believe it was catfish. Very tasty indeed. Olivino was closed, so we got two cans of Fosters and made like Aussies. And again, the coffee was excee. Third time was brunch, where we had the catfish po' boy, cheddar eggs with grits and a side of encrusted French toast.....ummmmm, very good.Now the problem all three times was the terrible service!!!!! It was bad. Not bad meaning good, but bad meaning horrid. Super slow, no explaining the dishes and giving us mouth watering descriptions. No coming back around to see if we wanted dessert. No waiter period for twenty minutes while we waited to order and I knawed off my pinky toe from hunger.....and the restaurant was rather empty. As we watched her prep tables instead of taking our order. The manager, who is sharp, saw this and gave us an extra scoop of ice cream for free as a mea culpa :)I wasn't even going to write the bad stuff, but on our last visit for brunch, the waiter brought back the change and took it upon himself to round-up our change. The change was supposed to be $8.82 and he brought back $8. I brought it to his attention and he replied ""oh, I must have dropped it""!

"The food at Peaches is amazing.  I'm admittedly a Yankee but the taste is really down-home.  Everything on their brunch menu, in particular, is superb.  I enjoy the catfish, the cheesy grits, and the granola-crusted french toast.  Also order their fries with any meal you can.  Order them with dessert.  They're that good.The cons are small but notable- the food is often too salty across the board, and there is a distinct lack of vegetarian options (yes, I know it's a Southern place, but I must at least note this).  And the service is usually slow-ish-- slow enough that it's nice if you've got time for a leisurely meal, but if you are stopping for a meal before going elsewhere, or if you're very hungry, just know you're going to wait.  A lot. I've never not-waited a LONG time for service.  The food is worth the wait, but they always make you say ""this food had better be worth this wait,"" you know?

"Like other residents in this area, the arrival of Peaches Market was a blessing from God. And for the first few dinners I enjoyed there, I eagerly prayed at the alter of delicious sauteed kale, chicken, cat fish, seasonal watermelon salad, and pulled pork sandwiches. The food was great (not alarmingly so), but the service was sweet, affable, and quick - a luxury in these parts. Back in the BYOB salad days....And then...and then! A dark shadow was cast upon that sunny terrace, winter came, and with it, the arrival of one of the smarmiest, least personable waiters I've ever encountered this side of France (cliche!). Not even, this guy is just a dick. I hate to be so crass, but he's ruined or nearly ruined the last three meals I've had at Peaches. AND I AM NOT ALONE - I conferred with another two neighbors who also pass through Peaches with regularity and they've expressed the same frustrations.To top it all off, the last time I ate at Peaches, I got a mild case of food poisoning - the shrimp must've been a bit off. Mind you, this is not a huge deterrent; I'm willing to chalk that up to a one-off and give it another go, but that waiter's crappy attitude and condescending air will have me yelping for culinary destinations outside of my own neighborhood for the foreseeable future.:(.",3.0

"I have been here twice, once for a private event. My cousins rented this restaurant out for an anniversary party on a Sat night and I must say that I was impressed with the food and service. We had shrimp with grits, a nice salad with salsa like tomatoes on it. There was also baked chicken and honestly I cannot remember anything that I didn't like that day. The desserts were small but very tasty, there was a band there rocking old school R&B...loved that! The only thing is that the place is rather small but nothing you can do about that. We were squeezed in there really tight but I loved the atmosphere. I vowed to come back on another day just me and my mom and we did so yesterday, Easter Sunday. We came around 3pm. I thought there would be a long wait, we were told 30 mins but it turned out to be only 20. My waitress was a very lovely young lady who was very attentive & it was obvious that she knows what she was doing. Very tall black girl with a beautiful accent. I ordered the catfish & grits with that same salsa kind of salad & I enjoyed it. I thought the catfish was prepared well & was tasty but I did not like the cheese grits. I thought they were extremely runny. I like grits when they are kind of thick. Personal choice but I think if you want them thick, you may have to ask for it that way. My mother had that breakfast with the french toast w/fruit, eggs, bacon, & grits. She liked her grits runny, the bacon was really good quality and cooked to perfection. But the 5 stars go to that french toast. I will return and will definitely order that next time, it was really fresh & so was the fruit & it had some sort of almond crust on it. I don't think you even need syrup when eating this french toast, that it definitely a winner for this place. Anyhoo, the food came quickly & we were surprisingly in and out of there on Easter Sunday which I thought was going to be a nightmare. There is parking in the area on the residential streets where you shouldn't have to walk that far so that was never a problem for me. But I'll tell you what was a problem for me...the bus boy!!! I am an Event Planner & I am very picky about all around service. I think the bus boy needs more training, he first came over to our table & didn't ask if he could take our plates, he simply reached over the table, took a small plate in front of my mother which had her spoon for her hot tea on it, he takes the spoon in his hand & then puts it back right on the table in front of my mother. I was mortified and I THINK even after he did it, he realized that it was disgusting, he should have gotten another spoon but we were almost done so I let it go. Not to mention that fact that he didn't say excuse me or ask if we were done so he could remove plates. My mother still had almost a whole plate of food in front of her & he reached over as if he was going to take it because she wasn't eating it at the moment. I shut him down and told him that she wasn't finished & then he walked away. He came back, minutes later & then asked her if she was done, after she says yes, he puts all the other plates he has on his tray on top of her plate of food right in front of her face so he can lift them all up at the same time & put them back on his tray....WTF??? Sorry but I don't want to see the scrap left on the plates of others right in front of my face when I just got done eating. If I was thinking of dessert, I'm not now!! I hope their establishment checks these reviews because that was really inappropriate. I would come back there but they need to tighten up on that part of their service. I've even thought about having a small gathering there...but don't put that bus boy on my event!!",4.0
Peaches has improved their abysmal service. They must have had a few staff meetings lol. The last few times I was there they seemed to care about their work and and paid more attention to the details. Much improved experience. Way to go peaches!,4.0
We went for brunch on a Sunday and were seated immediatelyI requested fresh juice and the waiter said there's only troPicana.The juice glass was filled with ice. Why?? The fruit plate was fabuloso..  My eggs Benedict were perfectoWhy was the coffee $3.00?  And the waiter said. We do not serve Half and half no sugar on the table too got sugar from another table  SURPRISE. Next day at my ATM I fond an extra debit of $40 dollars. I called peaches we told they would call back. Had to call the next afternoon. Told nicely that our waiter hadade the error but never said a word when I had used my debit card. And we left him a ten dollar cash tip ie 22% tip. I was told not to worry it was not peaches error. Bank eventually credited the extra $41,3.0
I went to Peaches twice and I love it. The first time I went was during the snow storm. After being in the house for a few days straight I was dying to get out regardless of the snow. I was happy when I called Peaches and they were open. So I put my snow boots on and walked through the snow for some good food and a drink with my cousin. The first time I went I had the hanger steak special and it was delicious. The second time I had a burger and it was good also. I love the atmosphere and the workers are very friendly. I definitely plan on going back.,4.0
"this is a great restaurant to bring out of town guests or to chat up with friends just don't go on a sunday! the wait for brunch is ridiculous. service is nothing to brag about but i go for the food which you can expect a wait, in the end it's always worth it. my favorite dishes are: burgers and roasted chicken!",4.0

"Like other residents in this area, the arrival of Peaches Market was a blessing from God. And for the first few dinners I enjoyed there, I eagerly prayed at the alter of delicious sauteed kale, chicken, cat fish, seasonal watermelon salad, and pulled pork sandwiches. The food was great (not alarmingly so), but the service was sweet, affable, and quick - a luxury in these parts. Back in the BYOB salad days....And then...and then! A dark shadow was cast upon that sunny terrace, winter came, and with it, the arrival of one of the smarmiest, least personable waiters I've ever encountered this side of France (cliche!). Not even, this guy is just a dick. I hate to be so crass, but he's ruined or nearly ruined the last three meals I've had at Peaches. AND I AM NOT ALONE - I conferred with another two neighbors who also pass through Peaches with regularity and they've expressed the same frustrations.To top it all off, the last time I ate at Peaches, I got a mild case of food poisoning - the shrimp must've been a bit off. Mind you, this is not a huge deterrent; I'm willing to chalk that up to a one-off and give it another go, but that waiter's crappy attitude and condescending air will have me yelping for culinary destinations outside of my own neighborhood for the foreseeable future.:(.",3.0

So i dont understand why i had to wait for 15mins for my order to be taken.  It ran me late on my lunch time.  Another couple came in 5 minutes before they finally took my order and their food arrived at the same time mines did.  My drink arrived 5 mins after my food.  Restaurants with better management at least come and take your drink order and dont make you feel so ignored as Peaches did.  Dont think i will take the chance again on my lunch time.,3.0
"Great food and ambience, but awful service! Tearfully slow, aloof, and uninterested. Our waiter acted like he was working, but he never offered a 2nd round of drinks and we had to beg beg BEG for water.I wish that Management would read their Yelp reviews so they could improve the service. It's not impossible to turn the place around, but it's been YEARS since they opened and it has only gotten worse. Why patronize a place that won't listen to its diners? Shame on you, Peaches. This is NYC. We know when something sucks.",1.0
"Peaches, peaches, peaches.  My boyfriend and I went to this restaurant this past Saturday.  There were no tables available so we were told we could sit at the bar.  The bartender was ok.  She forgot to give us silverware but made us really great drinks from their limited  drink menu.  We had the wings. delicious.  The sausage chicken gumbo...delicious.  The blackened cat fish sandwich...delicious, the barbeque fries...delicious and the chips and spinach dip....not so great.  A live band was performing as we came in but were packing up shortly after we sat down at about 2:30pm.  I wish we could've gotten there early so that I could've heard more of the band.  As we were leaving the waiter was telling arriving guests that they could only order from the appetizer menu from 4 to 5pm as they transitioned to the dinner menu from 5pm on so if you're going to visit Peaches go well before 4 or after 5pm.  Overall I really enjoyed the experience and will be returning soon.  Peaches is truly a gem in the heart of Bed-Stuy.",4.0

"Well, we found out about Peaches by default. (I didn't know it was called ""Peaches Market"" so you'll find this same review under ""Peaches"")  We were reading the reviews of one of their competitors where the reviewers were constantly referring to Peaches as a better BRUNCH alternative. So, we fell in there yesterday. From the moment we walked in until the time we left, we received only the most professional and attentive service, EXCELLENT food (cornmeal crusted catfish with grits and the smoked chicken & sausage gumbo) - LORD HAVE MERCY! The catfish was fried to perfection (two med. sized pieces) and resting on a pool of the most deliciously viscous, buttery grits I've had. I believe they mix in some coarse yellow corn meal because it had a great texture and the buttery corn flavor was right on the money. The catfish was meaty, flaky and crisp. I was compelled to order an appetizer of the smoked chicken & sausage gumbo...savory, smokey and deliciously lethal! I could have had an entree sized bowl of that alone with some corn bread on the side and been good to go! (just a hint to the restaurant owners!) The waitress that took care of us was professional,attentive and represented the business well. Loved the bright, open airy atmosphere w/light pouring in from two sides, clusters of Japanese paper lantern globes dotting the ceiling. Althought the place was full, we didn't feel crowded or overwhelmed by noise. It really was a wonderful meeting place that, from my observation, was a wonderful cross-section folks of all ages/backgrounds who had a level of sophistication about themselves and their friends. We even ran into a couple of our ParlorJazz guests/friends!...and that is always an extra added treat!I know that, in most things, timing is everything. We were there about 1:30pm on a Sunday afternoon. The place was full, but we got a table promptly and I have absolutely nothing but good things to say about our maiden voyage into Peaches that day. We've found a new brunch spot! I look forward to sampling the rest of the menu!I have a suggestion!  Please upgrade the smoked chicken & sausage gumbo to an ENTREE and serve it w/cornbread and side salad.!  That gumbo is sooo good, it makes ya wanna hurt yo'self!!  The bomb!! :-)",4.0

We went to celebrate a friends birthday on Friday. We had a large party of 12 and it took over a hour to accommodate us. Since this place is small for large groups we had to be broken up in groups. They did accommodate us when 4 more people showed up.  We were spread out amongst 4 tables with our table being the biggest of 8. We had two waitresses one for our table and another for other three.  Quick observations were this place is more suited for couples 2 or more max. The other tables in our party received their food and drinks in decent amount of time. Ours on the other hand took a long time to receive drinks. When we did inquire about them they informed us to be patient they were out of glassware. It eventually took 30 min to receive 2 mixed drinks. Overall the food was good and they were nice size portions.  I would eat here again but only if I went out with a party of 4 or less.,3.0
"After moving to this neighborhood seven months ago, it was time to finally try this place. On a busy Saturday night, we went there with a party of four, but we were seated right away. There was a huge table of 20-somethings having a party near us -- and the noise level got a bit much. Still, the atmosphere seemed very warm and cozy. The patronage appeared to be a mixed bag ... mostly the three B's: beautiful, black, bohemian. Nice crowd. The service was cordial but unbelievably slow. If you're absorbed in a conversation and not dying of hunger, then this isn't a big deal. If you have blood sugar issues, then you'd better hit the Uncle Vinnie's Pizza a couple of blocks away.Personally, I thought the food was well worth waiting for. The turkey meatloaf? FABULOUS! The mashed potatoes? HOT DAMN! Even the brussels sprouts were a knockout. They don't have a wine list, although they do serve some respectable house wines. Just ask for the varietal -- merlot, cabernet, shiraz -- whatever. Everybody at our table was happy with what they ordered. The catfish sandwich and barbecue fries were a big hit. We're definitely planning to go back for brunch.

The restaurant's interior design is pleasant, with ball lanterns hanging from the ceiling, a nice roof, and comfortable seating.  I also noticed a projector and screen attached to the roof.  I liked the photography on the walls and the clientele included at least a few locals.  The waiters let me work for a few hours without bother; though the later I stayed, the noisier it got.  Overall, it's a great place.  I'm definitely coming back.",5.0

Yes it is; you should try some too. I ordered the Smoke Joint BBQ (chicken), and commandeered one, okay...two pieces of French toast from the plates of friends, and it was incredible. The BBQ tasted smoky and authentic. Their sweet potato fries have my full endorsement, if you enjoy sweet potato fries, you definitely do not want to leave NYC without eating these!

"I've been here 3 times and unfortunately for Peaches I didn't write a review the first two times.  It has gotten progressively worse.  The food isn't anything to scream about but it is a pretty cool spot so that's why I kept going, unfortunately this time will be the last.  I went for my birthday for brunch and after we ordered a different waitress came and brought some type of chips and dip to the table.  We all commented to each other saying ""wow I guess they've decided to take the whole free bread thing to another level"".  After we began eating we realized it may have belonged to another table to we asked our waiter who said yes she brought it to the wrong table.  We apologized and said it would be okay if they placed it on our bill.  The waiter said no problem at all they wouldn't charge us for it because it was their mistake (he was extremely nice).  The other waitress who MADE the error in the first place began talking loudly (it's not a big place) saying they should have said something, they knew it wasn't theirs, I hate people like that etc etc.  Initially we let her continue to talk, but then she got louder and it was at that point that the other table realized she made an error and gave their food to us, then the other table became upset and started yelling at their waiter (same guy as us...poor guy).  Anyway the other waitress...the one who made the mistake KEPT talking...it was at that point we insisted that the chips & dip be placed on our bill to shut her up because we thought it rude that she continue to talk about patrons of the restaurant she worked in directly in their face and the waiter apologized again and said something to her.  She then turned around and stared us down for a few seconds...real mature.  If not for our waiters kindness she could have ruined his tip due to the overall experience.  She has been there since the first time I visited Peaches which was many years ago and she is average height, dark skin, and very heavyset in case you are wondering.  I was so disappointed and most likely will not return.  SOCO has brunch also so I guess if I'm looking for brunch in the neighborhood I will head there.",1.0
"We ate at Peaches for the first time this weekend and had a pleasant experience. Considering how limited the Bed-Stuy restaurant scene is, Peaches is a welcome addition to the neighborhood. The atmosphere is warm and welcoming, and the staff genuinely tries to serve their customers well. The mood at the bar is particularly inviting, not merely because people imbibe there, but because locals are clearly happy to have a comfortable dining and bar setting in which to relax, treat themselves, and even socialize with strangers if they wish. All this makes for a pleasant addition to the neighborhood for us 40+ year olds, in particular. Very nice vibe, I'm pleased to say, without having to drive downtown. The food side of Peaches is good. But this is Southern comfort food. If you're looking for refined cuisine, or comfort food does not appeal to you, then don't trash Peaches. The mac-n-cheese is tasty, the brussle spouts with bacon are very well prepared, and the wings and crab cake appetizers were good, too. The beet salad with goat cheese and mico greens and tangerine was very good. We shared an entree -- baked salmon with collard greens and sun dried tomatoes in a winy broth -- which was also very good. The food and overall experience was good enough to motivate us to order out po'boys -- catfish and shrimp -- the following day, and they, too, were OK, though at $13, the shrimp po'boy is vastly overpriced. Not sure if they ran out of a good bread, but the one they used for the shrimp po'boy is about the same quality one can get at the deli section of associated on Fulton nearby. For $13, the bread has got to be better than that.... Overall, the food is good, not fantastic, but then again, it's southern comfort food. If you're the type who turns your nose up to American comfort food, Peaches will not appeal to you. For the rest of us, even those of us who enjoy refined healthier choices most of the time, Peaches menu is a welcome addition to the Bed-Stuy restaurant scene, which is oddly thin for such a densely populated area.  My main concern about Peaches lies in the bar. The bartender on Friday night was openly watering down drinks -- specialty martinis! --with club soda. When one pays downtown Brooklyn and Manhattan prices for cocktails, especially martinis, there is no justification for watering down drinks. Even when drinks are discounted for happy hour (until 7pm), priced at $6 as opposed to $10 plus, there is no justification to watering down martinis and cocktails. As a former bartender, waiter, and restaurant manager, this practice is downright unacceptable. When asked why the bartender was watering down drinks, even the server, who handled the question diplomatically, acknowledged that the practice is not cool. Hopefully this is not a regular practice at Peaches, because savvy customers will eventually be turned off by it. Hopefully I'll not be one of them, because it would be unwise for the management to do anything short of providing their customers, especially the heavier spending drinking crowd, with downtown quality drinks at downtown prices. Let's call a spade a spade, the practice of watering down drinks to lower liquor costs and expand profit margins is a very uncool, if not unethical, business practice. All in all, though, we're glad that Peaches is part of the slowly-emerging Bed-Study restaurant scene, and, based on older reviews, that it's been working at improving other aspects of its dining experience. We hope Peaches continues to improve not just because the community deserves a quality dining experience at a reasonable price, but because from the looks of the crowds Peaches, the place is a gold mine in the making.",3.0
"Went to brunch here about a week ago and I regret to say it was not my favorite. While the atmosphere was nice and I love the fact that they have outdoor seating I think the service was off and the food was just ok. I got the egg sandwich and my friend got the crab omelet both were uninspired and just ok which was a huge disappointment because the menu sounded so good and we were very excited for our meal. The omelet had hardly any crab in it and the grits were also just ok and kind of boring...but perhaps that's because I like cheese in my grits. The egg sandwich was your typical egg sandwich you could get from the deli, the bacon was nice and thick cut although not cooked enough for my liking. Also our server took a really long time with our drinks and taking our order. Luckily after our order was placed everything went smoothly. Lastly the drinks were way off base, I think they need to hired a new mixologist. My sweet peach tea was so sugary I couldn't drink it, and my friends mint julep had no sugar at all and was basically straight up white lightning with mint flecks. All in all it is a cute place but it just didn't seem like a great meal for the money in my opinion.",2.0

"I've been here 3 times and unfortunately for Peaches I didn't write a review the first two times.  It has gotten progressively worse.  The food isn't anything to scream about but it is a pretty cool spot so that's why I kept going, unfortunately this time will be the last.  I went for my birthday for brunch and after we ordered a different waitress came and brought some type of chips and dip to the table.  We all commented to each other saying ""wow I guess they've decided to take the whole free bread thing to another level"".  After we began eating we realized it may have belonged to another table to we asked our waiter who said yes she brought it to the wrong table.  We apologized and said it would be okay if they placed it on our bill.  The waiter said no problem at all they wouldn't charge us for it because it was their mistake (he was extremely nice).  The other waitress who MADE the error in the first place began talking loudly (it's not a big place) saying they should have said something, they knew it wasn't theirs, I hate people like that etc etc.  Initially we let her continue to talk, but then she got louder and it was at that point that the other table realized she made an error and gave their food to us, then the other table became upset and started yelling at their waiter (same guy as us...poor guy).  Anyway the other waitress...the one who made the mistake KEPT talking...it was at that point we insisted that the chips & dip be placed on our bill to shut her up because we thought it rude that she continue to talk about patrons of the restaurant she worked in directly in their face and the waiter apologized again and said something to her.  She then turned around and stared us down for a few seconds...real mature.  If not for our waiters kindness she could have ruined his tip due to the overall experience.  She has been there since the first time I visited Peaches which was many years ago and she is average height, dark skin, and very heavyset in case you are wondering.  I was so disappointed and most likely will not return.  SOCO has brunch also so I guess if I'm looking for brunch in the neighborhood I will head there.",1.0
"We ate at Peaches for the first time this weekend and had a pleasant experience. Considering how limited the Bed-Stuy restaurant scene is, Peaches is a welcome addition to the neighborhood. The atmosphere is warm and welcoming, and the staff genuinely tries to serve their customers well. The mood at the bar is particularly inviting, not merely because people imbibe there, but because locals are clearly happy to have a comfortable dining and bar setting in which to relax, treat themselves, and even socialize with strangers if they wish. All this makes for a pleasant addition to the neighborhood for us 40+ year olds, in particular. Very nice vibe, I'm pleased to say, without having to drive downtown. The food side of Peaches is good. But this is Southern comfort food. If you're looking for refined cuisine, or comfort food does not appeal to you, then don't trash Peaches. The mac-n-cheese is tasty, the brussle spouts with bacon are very well prepared, and the wings and crab cake appetizers were good, too. The beet salad with goat cheese and mico greens and tangerine was very good. We shared an entree -- baked salmon with collard greens and sun dried tomatoes in a winy broth -- which was also very good. The food and overall experience was good enough to motivate us to order out po'boys -- catfish and shrimp -- the following day, and they, too, were OK, though at $13, the shrimp po'boy is vastly overpriced. Not sure if they ran out of a good bread, but the one they used for the shrimp po'boy is about the same quality one can get at the deli section of associated on Fulton nearby. For $13, the bread has got to be better than that.... Overall, the food is good, not fantastic, but then again, it's southern comfort food. If you're the type who turns your nose up to American comfort food, Peaches will not appeal to you. For the rest of us, even those of us who enjoy refined healthier choices most of the time, Peaches menu is a welcome addition to the Bed-Stuy restaurant scene, which is oddly thin for such a densely populated area.  My main concern about Peaches lies in the bar. The bartender on Friday night was openly watering down drinks -- specialty martinis! --with club soda. When one pays downtown Brooklyn and Manhattan prices for cocktails, especially martinis, there is no justification for watering down drinks. Even when drinks are discounted for happy hour (until 7pm), priced at $6 as opposed to $10 plus, there is no justification to watering down martinis and cocktails. As a former bartender, waiter, and restaurant manager, this practice is downright unacceptable. When asked why the bartender was watering down drinks, even the server, who handled the question diplomatically, acknowledged that the practice is not cool. Hopefully this is not a regular practice at Peaches, because savvy customers will eventually be turned off by it. Hopefully I'll not be one of them, because it would be unwise for the management to do anything short of providing their customers, especially the heavier spending drinking crowd, with downtown quality drinks at downtown prices. Let's call a spade a spade, the practice of watering down drinks to lower liquor costs and expand profit margins is a very uncool, if not unethical, business practice. All in all, though, we're glad that Peaches is part of the slowly-emerging Bed-Study restaurant scene, and, based on older reviews, that it's been working at improving other aspects of its dining experience. We hope Peaches continues to improve not just because the community deserves a quality dining experience at a reasonable price, but because from the looks of the crowds Peaches, the place is a gold mine in the making.",3.0
"Went to brunch here about a week ago and I regret to say it was not my favorite. While the atmosphere was nice and I love the fact that they have outdoor seating I think the service was off and the food was just ok. I got the egg sandwich and my friend got the crab omelet both were uninspired and just ok which was a huge disappointment because the menu sounded so good and we were very excited for our meal. The omelet had hardly any crab in it and the grits were also just ok and kind of boring...but perhaps that's because I like cheese in my grits.
