"Honestly, I've never had such a nice and pleasant experience at a restaurant in New York. The waiters were pleasant and friendly, and the atmosphere is really lovely. I ordered two veggie rolls (quite small portions), the tofu and avocado salad, and the soy pudding with ginger sauce. Everything tasted amazing. It was such a perfect, well-balanced meal. They offer hot tea, which gets re-filled every so often and the staff are really attentive. I highly recommend this place.",5.0
The staff was very friendly and the decor was nice.I loved everything that came from the sushi area.  The fish was fresh.  The rice was warm and not tightly packed and had just the right amount of vinegar.  Delicious!The kitchen food wasn't as good.  The miso wings were a bit overcooked and the soft shell crab tempura had too much batter for my taste.  Miso soup and edamame were good though.We also got a 5% discount thorough Yelp.,4.0
"A new hidden gem. Although, might be a bit hard to find. Came here during the first week of opening. It is very well decorated and clean. The service and waiters were very friendly and attentive. I came here for lunch and the lunch specials were so worth it with different fish specials everyday. On top of that, they had a 10% promotion if we check in on yelp. I would definitely come back again.",4.0
Cons:Teriyaki chicken lunch set was basically chicken dipped in soy sauce.Service was too slow.,3.0
"Is Jun Shokudo a welcomed addition to this awkward part of BK that can't even be associated with a neighborhood due to its placement next to the BQE entrance? Yas.I live across the street, so I obviously had to stop by for dinner at some point. We now have four restaurants in my part of the 'hood since I first moved here two years ago. (Starbucks just opened this year, so you know that hints at what's happening... rent increase for me, ugh lordy).Anyway, we ordered--Futomaki roll: ended up ordering two bc we were still hungry and it was good. *recommendSalmon Hakozushi (pressed sushi): aka a roll pressed into a rectangular box aka great for your Instagram, but not impressive in flavor or uniqueness. We preferred the good ole roll.Chirashi Don: normal chirashi dishMiso Glazed Wings: I thought it was too salty for my taste, but everyone adored them. It is seriously crispy, reminiscent of the style of Korean chicken wings I love so much. *recommendIt's a small, cozy space that I think deserves its hype for this area. That being said, it's A-OK because there are other areas with better food/prices. I recognize this was just for one dinner service when they first opened, so don't take it too seriously. I think I would go back/will update if I do, but it's been over two months since I first visited.",3.0
"This is definitely a nice, small cozy restaurant. It is perfect for a date night which you can actually have a conversation. The service was good. We got the five chef selection, braised pork, salmon fried rice and salmon avocado roll. The five was delicious. It was fresh. I love the salmon avocado roll. I like how they put mint leaf on it which gave it a refreshing kick. The braised pork is a must get. The soup base was delicious. The pork was fat and juicy. The salmon fried rice was different than what I had in mind. It was special of the day. When I took a bit, it reminded me of rice cake. The rice is fried in a square and top w salmon. This dish was ok. Overall, I enjoyed every last bite in this restaurant.",5.0
"Came here based on recommendation from a fellow Yelper. Since this place is new, I got a bunch of my coworkers to visit tonight. This is a small cozy place. The staff greeted us warmly and was patient in answering any questions we had. We got a variety of things from fried shrimp to soups to fish cakes to a variety of rolls to bigger plates to desserts. I will highlight a few that stood out. Kimchi Salmon Roll was surprisingly not that spicy. This is the closest to ""spicy salmon roll"" that I would get from a low end Japanese place. I was concerned that kimchi would be too spicy, but this was just the right kick. I would totally order this again. Spicy Scallop Roll was not as spicy as I had thought and the scallop pieces were soft and tender. This is a must get if you also want to come for their lunch roll special. Grilled Miso Black Cod was the single thing that I was looking forward to. It was buttery tender and generally made well. I wish it was marinated in miso a little bit more so that the miso flavor would be stronger, but this is definitely not bad at all. There are a quite a bit of bones in the two pieces of filet so you should be careful in eating it. Even though I didn't try it, the grilled miso salmon looked equally as appetizing as the black cod. Matcha Mousse was simple but a nice end to a great meal. It caught my eye as soon as I looked at the menu and this didn't disappoint. It's on the sweeter side, so if you don't like your dessert overly sweet, then don't get this one. I'm looking forward to coming here for lunch and trying their chirashi don! This is a solid hidden gem that I hope it is here to stay!",5.0
"Pretty good rolls, but overpriced. You don't get nearly the amount of fish you'd get at Ani or Iron Chef House. Quality is on par but nothing special. Service was slow.Overpriced and pretty good, but nothing to write home about. Check out other sushi places in the area instead.",3.0
"I am so thrilled that Jun Shokudo has opened in downtown Brooklyn. The space is small but inviting and cozy, and the waitstaff and sushi chef were all friendly and attentive. Above all, though, it is the food that makes this new restaurant really shine. Highlights of the evening:Niku jaga: braised root vegetables and beef. At 6 dollars, this hearty bowl of comfort food was filling and inexpensive and the taste was superb. Chawan mushi: this steamed egg custard was the perfect texture and had a wonderful savory flavor.Sushi rolls: both the salmon kimchi roll and the spicy scallop roll were out-of-this-world. The flavors were unique and the plump pieces of scallop were so fresh and soft that it melted in your mouth. Highly recommend both!I will most certainly be making Jun Shokudo my new neighborhood Japanese joint and I am happy that they also deliver and have lunch specials!",5.0
"The sushi was fresh and the rolls were presented nicely.   The sake list is quite extensive but wildly overpriced.  Staff was friendly and efficient.    If I found myself in this neighborhood again I'd likely eat here again, but I wouldn't make a great effort to do so.",3.0
"I really want to love this place. It reminds me of my favorite Japanese drama shinya shyokudo. The ambiance is good, like a traditional family izakaya. But the food is just not so good. I've tried the gyo don (beef over rice), too plain, not even as good as the pre-cooked ajinomoto Gyodon. The chicken wings, too much flavor. Kinpila, well, it shouldn't be called kinpila if there is no 牛蒡inside. And I can make better potato beef stew than they do. Anyway, I have high expectations with this place but I'm so disappointed.",2.0
The best Japanese restaurant in Downtown Brooklyn. I want to say thank you to the owner of this restaurant because we hadn't had enough restaurants around this area until this restaurant opened. I strongly recommend their lunch. It's delicious and reasonable.,5.0
Is this the best sushi I've ever had? No. Is it one if not the best in the area. Absolutely. I order from Jun Shokudo at least once a week - their lunch special is an incredible deal. The fish is always fresh and the salad of mixed greens is a step up from the romaine you usually get from other places.  Leafy and crisp. I can't wait to try dinner there,4.0
"Here comes real Japanese food in downtown Brooklyn....  As for me, Japanese food isn't just sushi and sashimi.  I miss all of homemade style Japanese food.  This is the place my wish came true. ... Jun the chef is awesome. She is so talented. Kakuni , Kinpira, Nikujaga ....etc etc. I could eat them everyday. It was the taste of nostalgic..... I felt like I was home back in Japan.I do have to go back to try every single thing on menu tho .... Place is new and clean. Very convenient location. Stuff is friendly and kind.  I will defiantly recommend to everyone who wants to try more then just sushi.",5.0
"I made it to this restaurant on opening night and  expectations were blown away. We arrived before 6pm and the space looked great (like something you would imagine in Tokyo but without the Asian music at least this time) was busy and seemed to be running perfectly. We tried the black cod, which was very moist and had a very nice miso glaze. We also had miso glazed chicken wings, which were very juicy and tasty, some sushi rolls and tuna and salmon Hakozushi. I've eaten at a lot of Japanese restaurants but have never heard of the Hakozushi sushi. It's a square sushi piece with other ingredients and it was very very tasty!It's great to have an awesome Japanese restaurant in DoBro to round off the wide range of cuisine -amazing Peruvian, Italian, French, American, and Mexican restaurants!",5.0
NICE FIND!!! We were hoping that a legitimate japanese restaurant came to downtown brooklyn (especially since a lot of japanese restaurants around here are either not very good or are more asian-american fusion types with teriyaki bs) My husband and I went there for lunch and were surprised to find lunch sets that were like home cooked meals made in a japanese household. They were delicious!! The service was superb and the price was beyond reasonable. They have a good sake selection as well. Gotta come back for dinner!,5.0
"Jun Shokudo is a great addition to Downtown Brooklyn, and I think everyone agrees. Jun Shokudo specializes in traditional home style cooking. They have a chalk board of daily specials which seem to sell out often. I've had the chance of trying their sake marinated sea trout w/ home made tofu special, which was out of this world! All the small plates are intriguing and so reasonably priced that you can't help but to try them all. Everything was so fresh from the greens to the fish. Highly recommended if you find yourself in the area!",5.0
"YES!!! Downtown Brooklyn just scored a great sushi spot, something it was definitely missing. Caught a lunch special here the other day. We arrived at maybe 1pm and were greeted promptly and seated immediately. The young lady that served us was very knowledgeable about the menu and was able to suggest some items for us. I ordered a very reasonably priced 2-roll combo. The rolls were pretty simple, which allowed me to really taste the fish, which was super fresh and tasty. My colleague enjoyed a hot lunch special, which I was super jealous of because it was the best crispy skinned salmon I've tasted in a while. Anyway, if you live or work in Downtown Brooklyn, Jun Shokudo is the lunch spot you have been waiting for. Great decor, clean restaurant, excellent service, and delicious food. Will definitely be back.",5.0
"Jun Shokudo is a great little Japanese restaurant that opened recently on the somewhat deserted Gold St in DUMBO. The service was excellent and my cup of green tea was constantly being refilled by the waiter. My friend and I enjoyed their lunch specials which are a great deal at around $12 for a set that includes a protein, miso soup, a heaping bowl of rice and cold/pickled veggies. I think they only offer two lunch specials a day which varies day by day. I had the salted mackerel, which was perfectly seasoned and cooked, and my friend had the pork katsu, which was also very good and had a hint of jalapeno. If you're craving sushi, you can also get three rolls off their a la carte menu for only $13. I will definitely come back here if I'm ever in the area!",5.0
"The best lunch spot in brooklyn! Great deal. This is the best Japanese in Brooklyn for sure.However there are somethings I didn't care for:1. For dinner, big plate item dish, it didn't come with rice. $2 extra2. Really loved spicy scallop rolls last time. I ordered it again  this time and had too much mayo. 3. No regular sushi option!! Just box pressed sushi. 4.  They brought my dinner along with appetizer.Overall I am pleased to have this great Japanese spot in the neighborhood.",4.0

"New restaurant in the neighborhood and it's a must go! Really good food and love the interior design of this place. Came here with my family and we tried a little bit of everything. Their appetizers really good. Had the marinated mackerel, braised pork belly, steamed egg custard, pickled vegetables, shrimp tempura roll, tempura appetizer, miso black cod and some of ""Today's smaller plates and little things"" which is really good.  -Shrimp tempura is really good here. I don't usually order shrimp tempura roll when I go to a Japanese restaurant, but since my brother did I tasted a piece of it. It was really good, it didn't taste heavy or oily at all. It tasted fluffy and light. -Tempura appetizer: ordered it because the shrimp tempura was good. It was just as good, fluffy and light. The tempura sauce was really good and it went perfect with the tempura appetizer. -Pickles vegetables good to eat as you eat through out your meal.-Steamed egg custards tasted very light and silky, perfect for a light appetizer. It also comes in a really cute cup and baby spoon.  -Braised Pork Belly is my favorite! I love pork belly, but not a lot of places can make the perfect sauce for pork belly. The sauce that they have also have goji berries in them and it goes perfect with the pork belly. It's a must try! -Marinated mackerel, I love eating mackerel raw and never had it cooked before so I decided to give it a try and it was good! It's a little sour, but not over dressed. Opens up your appetite a little! -Miso black cod was also one of my favorite dish, they cooked it perfectly and it tasted amazing. It doesn't have any sauce to go with it, but you don't even need any sauces and it's tastes really good.  -Today's smaller plates and little things: one of the little things we had was tofu with different types of mushroom and soup in it. The soup was really good and it went perfectly with the mushroom and tofu.I will def come back with family and friends to try out other things on the menu.",5.0

I tried this place for the first time last week and I was really impressed with the quality of the sushi. It wasn't like typical sushi places and Wally gave you quality portions of the fish.

"Excellent food! I had their buta got lunch. Spicy and flavorful. These guys are genuine!Lunch was a total of about 10 dollars. That included miso soup, salad and the main dish. This kind of food could easily be a lot more!Ambience of the place is nice and has a lounging atmosphere. There is a Starbucks right across the street and cops are around which makes it safe. Definitely coming back every time I am in the area",5.0
"I hate writing reviews, because it's a pain in the butt. This place, however, is just too good not to review. My girlfriend and I have eaten dinner here twice and been impressed each time. In fact, we've ordered 11 dishes and all 11 have been excellent. I could single out the cod, for example, because it was excellent, but so were both the mackerel dishes we had. The quality of the food and care in its preparation remind me of being in Japan. Couldn't recommend a restaurant more highly.",5.0
My girlfriend and I stumbled upon this spot by chance. What a great coincidence! The food is absolutely amazing.Definitely try the miso blac cod whenever you're in the area!,5.0
"My boyfriend and I were told of this new spot that just opened up in brooklyn, they are still in the soft opening stages but the food is amazing. Great vibes, wonderful staff, and the manager is very helpful and attentive. We had a variety of dishes from pickled vegetables, box sushi, grilled miso black cod, delicious chicken, tuna etc, my compliments to the chef, you are amazing! If you have trouble picking a dish im sure the staff would be more than happy to recommend a few. I am pretty sure i will stop by again i loved the ambiance as much as i enjoyed the food, you can never have too much traditional japanese style home cooking with a glass of sake especially when the sake cups come in different shapes and sizes!",5.0
Food was great! Don't miss the black cod big plate!  Sashimi was wonderful. The fish was soo fresh. This place is a great new addition to the neighborhood!,5.0
"Very limited lunch menu.  But, service was good, food was decent and prices were right where they should be. $27 for two lunch specials and non alcoholic drinks.",3.0
"They're still in the soft opening phase but had a surprisingly decent menu selection. The place has a nice vibe and it's small. Service was excellent. The staff was friendly and I never really had to wave anyone down. I had a few pieces of sashimi and the fish was very fresh. The reason for the four stars instead of five is that I felt the miso black cod could of had a bit more flavor, although it was still very good. The miso salmon was super yummy. Dessert wise the matcha mousse was super good.Definitely worth another visit next time I'm in the area.  Oh and they brought over steamed shelled peanuts which I felt was a nice touch.",4.0
It is a small cozy place. And it surprises me with the rarely seen Hakosushi in NYC. They provide homemade style Japanese foods which you do not see such authenticity amongst most Japanese restaurants. Worth to try !,5.0
Stopped in for a late dinner and was very pleased. I ordered one of the specialty rolls and miso salmon. The sushi was great and I'll be craving the salmon until I get a chance to come back and have it again.,5.0

"I live NYC for 20 years. Luckily I still love this city and This type of restaurant in your neighborhood make you love your city more. As if you found the place you could hide. As I am Japanese, I really miss home food, it's not only sushi or ramen or tempura, I do miss home food like your mom makes. JYUN SHOKUDO provide that. It's REAL Japanese food. Certain items here is beyond describable. Their NUTA salad is showing example how refine Japanese food is. every item in there is such simple ingredients but Chef Jyun, she orchestrated and give harmony within. Simple MISO soup & homemade pickle is far away from what you have those in Sunrise market. Price point is generous in my opinion. Spot on all the way from appetizer to main course then desert. Especially feeling you have after the meal...Smile all over my face. This is the restaurant I definitely would go back. and Again I love brooklyn because of that!!",5.0

Fabulous just ordered for pick up to test. I leave just across the street. The food was just really wonderfull. I love sushi and I am always afraid to try new places but you can tell that is really high level. I am sure they will get very successful. So happy and will be back for sure.,5.0

"I must say, I've been to Jun Shokudo a few times and I have enjoyed myself every single time.  The food is of great quality as well as the service. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable. My server, I think his name was Ken, explained their options available for sake as well as gave a colorful tour of their dishes available for the day. The spicy tuna roll is superb and their pressed sushi are a great addition to the menu. The sushi chef is friendly and they actually seem to care about the quality of their food.

"Local Sushi joint newly added to the small array of eateries in DT Brooklyn. It's a must go to when you need a little sushi, great warm soup for the cold days and the sake for another level of joy. The  fried Ebi, miso cod, the array of sushi rolls (yellowtail jalapeño scallion, spicy scallop, spicy tuna, salmon and avocado and the special 5 flavor sashimi.

"This is not your typical sushi format Japanese restaurant (though they do serve sushi that I am quite sure will not be typical as well).  So if you are looking for your americanized dragon or ninja rolls, you can probably randomly pick from a list of other places and be happy.Jun Shokudo serves what can best be categorized as obanzai, which are a mix of home style (much more refined the way they do it) Japanese dishes, a format that is rather rarely done at this level here in NYC.  For our first visit we deliberately stayed away from the sushi menu and are happy to report that EVERY dish was excellent - from the simple fermented rice bran cured pickled cucumber, to the 'nanban' mackerel, raw tuna cubes served in this sweetish floral sauce that I was tempted to lick the bowl to finish, to the delectable desserts, there was not a single thing or detail that was not thought through in each dish.  All well constructed, perfectly balanced, nothing that was not supposed to be on the plate, nothing that could be subtracted.   The menu is concise and very well designed.  It looks like they might change the menu with the seasons which I prefer with kitchens of this level of quality.Finally, a proper proper Japanese restaurant in Brooklyn, and so close to home, what a blessing.  This is quite possibly the best Japanese restaurant I've been to in Brooklyn (w'burg included), and even when you expand the scope to Manhattan this place is pretty high up there.  Strongly recommended!  Try everything on the Obanzai menu.  Will definitely be back again (and again).",5.0
"Great new addition to the neighborhood!! Authentic Japanese cuisine in downtown Brooklyn. Went there for a friend's birthday and was pleasantly surprised the variety and quality of the food. Everything was delicious - miso soup, egg custard, miso black cod, fried shrimp, sardine roll, and too many others. Be raw sardine I have ever had!! Sake selection was great as well. Ended up having 3 bottles amongst 4 of us- was a great night with exceptional service all around!! Will definitely be back soon.",5.0

Wasn't impressed much.  Just an OK Japanese restaurant.  Miso soup had no dashi flavor.  White rice was soft cooked and wasn't that fresh.  They also don't know how to place rice (left) and soup (right) on a tray.  They don't have fundamental right.,3.0

This is a unique style of Japanese food for New Yorkers, but a traditional type for a Japanese grandmother back home. Many special dishes, very reasonably priced. Please try the nuta, unforgettable.",5.0

"Unique Japanese comfort food with tapas style appetizers that are delicious and not what you expect from a sushi restaurant.  Braised vegetables with beef was a bowl of comfort with perfectly cooked and season root vegetables and beef bits as more of a condiment than an overpowering element in the dish.  The greens were tasty and fresh--broccoli rabbi with miso, which balanced the bitterness of the green with a little sweetness. The sushi wasn't overly impressive, but fresh and well presented.  And the staff was top notch in terms of being welcoming and attentive.  The server pointed out a great sake for me to try, which I appreciated being a sake novice.  I'd like to come back here, especially for those tapas style dishes.",4.0
