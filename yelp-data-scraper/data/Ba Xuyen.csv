Great crusty French Baguette with very tasty meats and perfectly pickled veggies. This is the quintessential hole in the wall offering classic Vietnamese sandwiches and great iced coffee. Prices are reasonable. Food is fresh and good. This is my go-to place for Vietnamese sammiches.,5.0
"I've been to Ba Xuyen a few times now. They serve tasty food at great prices, which is the majority of what I want in a restaurant. However, I haven't always gotten a consistent experience.It's a little place in Brooklyn Chinatown with a few tables, but they mostly do take out service. I've gotten a couple of the sandwich options, including the #1, which has been my favorite. All the ingredients taste fresh and the flavors in the sandwich complement each other nicely. There was one time though, in which I got the #1 but there was clearly some meat missing from the sandwich. Everything was good, but I identified that there was no ground pork in my sandwich. I was eating at home when I realized, so I'm unsure if this was a simple mistake or if they were making me the sandwich after they had run out of the pork for the day, but either way, they sold me an incomplete sandwich. My only other gripe is that I walked in one time about 15-20 minutes before they close and the employee was sitting at a table in the front, looking ready to leave, and asked what I was getting. When I told her I'd like a sandwich, she was hesitant to get up and make it until I told her I also wanted a shake at which point she made it seem like selling the two items was worth her time, so she got up and made it. Speaking of shakes, their avocado shake is really incredible. I was skeptical at first, but it's very refreshing and delicious. I also got a lychee shake one time, but it was wayyyy too sweet as a result of the lychee itself being incredibly sweet even without the added sugar. They use fresh fruits in their shakes with milk, condensed milk, and sugar. Despite my two isolated gripes, this place is fantastic! A sandwiches is just $5 and a good-sized shake is only $3.25-3.50. Value like that is hard to find, so I plan to make repeat visits for as long as I can.",4.0
"The best Banh mi shop in Brooklyn! I always order the #1-Classic Banh mi sandwich whenever i come here. Their french baguette is toasted to perfection, flaky and crispy on the outside but also nice and soft on the inside! Just amazing for only $5! They layer generous amounts of marinated meat, viet ham, and picked vegetables. The pate is not to salty and adds a nice flavor to the sandwich. I highly recommend this place for new comers! You should also try the avocado shake, very unique, super creamy and delicious! You will not regret it!Review: youtube.com/watch?v=Fuev…",5.0
"It's easy to be swayed by all the exotic banh mi flavors offered elsewhere.  Ba Xuyen blows them all out of the water.  With a traditional take like the fan favorite #1, they handle these sandwiches wonderfully.  The ratio of meat to veggie fixings(cilantro, cucumber, pickled carrots/daikon) to bread is spot on.  And the bread is lightly toasted, but won't cut a few layers of your mouth out.  Though the bread is not hollowed out, you get distinct bites of pork meat & headcheese.  I love a place that doesn't skimp on ingredients.  Honorable mention: avocado shake.  I was rather skeptical of this creamy and lightly sweetened concoction.  However, it was surpisingly refreshing and helped to cut the saltiness of my sandwich.",5.0
"Best banh mi I've ever had. How to review the perfect such? The bread is awesomely flaky and tasty with the right combo of time in oven, salt, and bread-y-ness. The meat is marinated perfectly with cilantro in the right amounts to accent it. The pate is thin but present, perfectly creaming between the ingredients. The freshness just makes everything that much more satisfying.Staff are friendly, speak Mandarin, Viet, Cantonese, and English all well. Speed is very fast. There's the often cited and ill-located jeweler in the waiting area. The waiting area is huge with a tv tuned to Vietnamese live streaming tv. Everything's very clean and 1 can see the whole kitchen area which increases confidence and happiness. It truly is the best hero sandwich in the city as voted in the ""Village Voice"".",5.0
"The Best Vietnamese Sandwich in NY. Highly recommended. Clean and affordable. A decent sized Vietnamese hoagie. Quite tasty and hits the spot. I hidden gem in Brooklyn.  Average price is $5. I also recommend there Avocado shake, quite yummy. Thank you for a taste Vietnam without the headaches of traveling, lol. Psst: Order #6, #8. Get it Spicy, shh. Don't tell no one. It's Absolutely delicious.",5.0
"The banh mi nem nuong was what I ordered. This sandwich costs $5 and I honestly don't see the hype for these sandwiches. Yes, they're huge in size...maybe that's all that's good about it...I mean, the em nuong was softer than other places I've been to, but it wasn't out of this world. The sandwiches are decent here and a good option for a filling lunch.",4.0

"Good God this was just what the Dr. odered. Loved it.

"Best banh mi sandwiches in NYC? Not sure but it probably comes close! So I came here before work to pick up the #1 for dinner after reading the countless number of yelp reviews that rave Ba Xuyen as having the best banh mi sandwiches. Note: Even though this place is located on 8th Ave, it is NOT located anywhere near the 8th Ave Chinatown that most people think of! It's actually closer to the D train 9th Ave stop but even then it took me like 10 mins just to walk here from the train station. So basically it's in the middle of nowhere lol. To me, it looked like a legit Viet restaurant, but that's until I overheard the ladies working there speaking Cantonese haha. What I like about this place is that they make your banh mi's to order, unlike Banh Mi Saigon in Chinatown where they premake it (yuck!).The #1 is probably their most popular sandwich and I thought it tasted great! The typical banh mi vegetables are all there and were tasty. The meats, when combined together, might sound very salty but I did not find them to be too salty at all. What really got me was the mayo!! So good! Definitely elevated the banh mi to a whole new level!This is definitely the best banh mi sandwich I've had so far. And it's cheap too! The #1 is $5 and left me completely satiated! Never again will I pay $9 for a banh mi sandwich in Manhattan (AHEM VIETNAAM). Again, I'm not sure if I would consider this the best banh mi place in NYC since ""best"" is a bold statement. But it definitely is up there!",4.0

"Sometimes the best things come at small price points.Enter Ba Xuyen, a tiny, no-frills eatery in Sunset Park. It's long been lauded as one of the best banh mi spots in the city, and one I had put off visiting for years until I found a few friends willing to make the slightly arduous trek with me [1]. The venue has only a handful of outdated tables and mismatched chairs, which are usually taken up by a few of the neighborhood locals, so it handles a steady takeout business. In addition to their banh mi, Ba Xuyen also serves up several appetizers, bun (noodle) dishes, and beverages on the side.But we're here to talk about the Banh Mi. This sandwich is a shining example of what happens when the mixing of two (or more) culinary cultures merge to create a superb final product. At least in this case, the introduction of the baguette and butter to Vietnam intertwined with the ingredients and flavor profiles indigenous to the country, and led to the creation of the now popular Banh Mi. Ba Xuyen serves up just shy of ten iterations, all at a mere $5. My friend was willing to share, so we opted to get one of each of their most popular orders.The Banh Mi Pâté Thit Nguoi is probably the most classic version on the menu, labeled as the #1. The filling is comprised of sliced ham, head cheese (a terrine of sorts made from a variety of cuts usually from the head of the pig), pork roll, BBQ Pork, and the default vegetables (carrots, cucumber, cilantro), as well as a few dabs of pâté, butter, and mayonnaise. It has the most variation in flavors and textures, a crunchy, savory, lightly acidic amalgamation that smartly contrasts the lightly toasted bread with the various proteins and vegetables. The Banh Mi Nem Nuong (#5) is a simpler version of the first, but utilizes the crunchy-chewy BBQ as the main protein in the sandwich. Both are sizable and well-balanced, with a near-perfect ratio of ingredients and spreads sandwiched between a toasted baguette.I'll have to say that Ba Xuyen has served the best banh mi that I've yet to find in the city... and surprisingly, also one of the least expensive. What other reason do you need to make a trip here?--[1] This is when you know that you have good friends.",4.0
"Ba Xuyen is one of my favorite bahn mi places. I can only speak for the sandwiches but they are great tasting, fresh, flavorful, well portioned. My favorite is the #3 Shredded Pork as they do a good job shredding the pork into thin strings while maintaining the taste. If you want your sandwich spicy, please tell them beforehand. For $5, its a delicious bahn mi and highly recommend one come here. Only negative is that they close relatively early at 6:30pm daily",5.0
"Stumbled into this sandwich shop because I read about all the Yelp love and it didn't disappoint. Located on a strip of Asian eateries, the neighborhood lends a strong measure of credibility to this shop, and walking in I was greeted by the friendly counter people who were patient with my lack of real knowledge of Vietnamese food. The sandwiches are really inexpensive - about $5 for a solid bahn mi - and the smoothies are about $3 each. I opted for the #1 and Lychee and they were both spot on. I also noticed another patron eating soup (pho?) but didn't see it on the menu - something to ask about next time I visit.  Note that this isn't fancy by any measure - in fact, the walls are pretty bare and there are just a couple of cafeteria style tables, encouraging takeout - but the price and sandwich quality really stand out.",4.0
"Still got a couple of days before the paycheck comes, what to do? Break that piggy bank and take out the five bucks you saved up the last two years and spend it on something well worth, like a banh mi from Ba Xuyen! I've had their #1 a handful of times and decided to try other sandwiches today and so opted for the #5, Banh Mi Nem Nuong, (bbq with pate & butter). It must of been an off day because it did not taste so good. The meat was bland and had a weird fatty texture. Either way, their #1, Banh Mi Pate Thit Nguoi, (slices of ham, head cheese, pork roll, pork teriyaki & bbq with pate & butter) would still be my go-to! Baguette toasted perfectly--crispy outside, soft inside, slathered in butter and pate, loaded with pickled carrots, cucumber and cilatro, then stuffed with layers of meats, just delicious. Sinh To Bo, which is the avocado shake, also a must have. Made with fresh ripe avocado, creamy and sweet, just what you need to flush down the sandwich you just choked down in a heartbeat.",4.0
"According to my friend, Ba Xuyen has the best banh mi in NYC. So of course I had to try it out and brought my Vietnamese friend from Hanoi to be a judge of its tastiness. Our entire group vouched for the deliciousness of the sandwich and believed it was well worth the trek to Sunset Park. At only $5 for a 10"" sandwich, Ba Xuyen probably offers the best quality and quantity of ingredients to price ratio for banh mi. I tried the #1 (Pate Thit Nuong) and #5 (Nem Nuong - BBQ Pork). Both sandwiches were very similar, but I enjoyed the #1 sightly better because of the more variation in taste and texture. I normally don't like mayo, but the ingredients of the sandwich were so fresh that the mayo became irrelevant. The pickled carrots, daikon radish, and cucumber were also very fresh and crunchy. The best part is definitely the bread. Without it, the sandwich probably wouldn't have as stellar reviews. Not sure where they get their bread or if they make it themselves, but it's so crispy and buttery on the outside and soft on the inside.I didn't get a chance to try their cha gio (fried egg rolls), but they looked delicious and cheap at $0.75 a roll. They also serve other Vietnamese desserts including Bánh da ln, which I had only once. It is steamed layer cake made from tapioca starch, rice flour, mashed mung beans, taro, coconut milk etc.The place is more like an order and go establishment, but on weekends you'll find a group of Vietnamese men regulars at the tables chatting away.I saw a sign on their wall that they were voted the best heroes a while back. Maybe it's not the best sandwich I had ever had, but it's up there for banh mi. It is a little out of the way for me all the way in Sunset Park in Brooklyn, but I think it's worth traveling to at least once.",4.0
"I had the spicy grilled pork bahn mi and shrimp spring rolls. The grilled pork had a nice flavor, but not at all spicy. The roll was soft in the inside and crusty on the outside, just how I like it. The spring rolls were inexpertly wrapped (it looked like I tried to make them). Luckily the ingredients weren't falling out of the gaping holes. The spring rolls were very good and I really liked the bit of pork they put in it. The prices of the banh mi sandwiches have gone up to $5. Cash only. Good place for lunch if you're local, but it's not worth making a trip out here.",3.0
"Hands down one of the best traditional Banh Mi i've had in Brooklyn and for the most part, NYC.  They lose a quarter star for raising prices to $5 a sandwich and not doing anything new.  I picked up cha gio (spring rolls) and fortunately they are still only 50 cents a piece.  Both are very good.  All the other packaged stuff though are suspect. I've picked up a #1, which is the typical grilled pork (thit nuong) and a bbq pork patties (nem nuong) and finished them both without blinking an eye....  slathered in patè, butter, pickled daikon & carrots, cilantro, jalapeños and the meat, so yum.I washed it all down with a cup of ca phe sua nong (vietnamese hot coffee with condensed milk). Yes. They don't skimp out on this area as they are also purveyors and brewers of Café Du Monde's French coffee grounds.Oh, the spring rolls?

What other reason do you need to make a trip here?--[1] This is when you know that you have good friends.",4.0
"Ba Xuyen is one of my favorite bahn mi places. I can only speak for the sandwiches but they are great tasting, fresh, flavorful, well portioned. My favorite is the #3 Shredded Pork as they do a good job shredding the pork into thin strings while maintaining the taste. If you want your sandwich spicy, please tell them beforehand. For $5, its a delicious bahn mi and highly recommend one come here. Only negative is that they close relatively early at 6:30pm daily",5.0
"Stumbled into this sandwich shop because I read about all the Yelp love and it didn't disappoint. Located on a strip of Asian eateries, the neighborhood lends a strong measure of credibility to this shop, and walking in I was greeted by the friendly counter people who were patient with my lack of real knowledge of Vietnamese food. The sandwiches are really inexpensive - about $5 for a solid bahn mi - and the smoothies are about $3 each. I opted for the #1 and Lychee and they were both spot on. I also noticed another patron eating soup (pho?) but didn't see it on the menu - something to ask about next time I visit.  Note that this isn't fancy by any measure - in fact, the walls are pretty bare and there are just a couple of cafeteria style tables, encouraging takeout - but the price and sandwich quality really stand out.",4.0
"Still got a couple of days before the paycheck comes, what to do? Break that piggy bank and take out the five bucks you saved up the last two years and spend it on something well worth, like a banh mi from Ba Xuyen! I've had their #1 a handful of times and decided to try other sandwiches today and so opted for the #5, Banh Mi Nem Nuong, (bbq with pate & butter). It must of been an off day because it did not taste so good. The meat was bland and had a weird fatty texture. Either way, their #1, Banh Mi Pate Thit Nguoi, (slices of ham, head cheese, pork roll, pork teriyaki & bbq with pate & butter) would still be my go-to! Baguette toasted perfectly--crispy outside, soft inside, slathered in butter and pate, loaded with pickled carrots, cucumber and cilatro, then stuffed with layers of meats, just delicious. Sinh To Bo, which is the avocado shake, also a must have. Made with fresh ripe avocado, creamy and sweet, just what you need to flush down the sandwich you just choked down in a heartbeat.",4.0
"According to my friend, Ba Xuyen has the best banh mi in NYC. So of course I had to try it out and brought my Vietnamese friend from Hanoi to be a judge of its tastiness. Our entire group vouched for the deliciousness of the sandwich and believed it was well worth the trek to Sunset Park. At only $5 for a 10"" sandwich, Ba Xuyen probably offers the best quality and quantity of ingredients to price ratio for banh mi. I tried the #1 (Pate Thit Nuong) and #5 (Nem Nuong - BBQ Pork). Both sandwiches were very similar, but I enjoyed the #1 sightly better because of the more variation in taste and texture. I normally don't like mayo, but the ingredients of the sandwich were so fresh that the mayo became irrelevant. The pickled carrots, daikon radish, and cucumber were also very fresh and crunchy. The best part is definitely the bread. Without it, the sandwich probably wouldn't have as stellar reviews. Not sure where they get their bread or if they make it themselves, but it's so crispy and buttery on the outside and soft on the inside.I didn't get a chance to try their cha gio (fried egg rolls), but they looked delicious and cheap at $0.75 a roll. They also serve other Vietnamese desserts including Bánh da ln, which I had only once. It is steamed layer cake made from tapioca starch, rice flour, mashed mung beans, taro, coconut milk etc.The place is more like an order and go establishment, but on weekends you'll find a group of Vietnamese men regulars at the tables chatting away.I saw a sign on their wall that they were voted the best heroes a while back. Maybe it's not the best sandwich I had ever had, but it's up there for banh mi. It is a little out of the way for me all the way in Sunset Park in Brooklyn, but I think it's worth traveling to at least once.",4.0
"I had the spicy grilled pork bahn mi and shrimp spring rolls. The grilled pork had a nice flavor, but not at all spicy. The roll was soft in the inside and crusty on the outside, just how I like it. The spring rolls were inexpertly wrapped (it looked like I tried to make them). Luckily the ingredients weren't falling out of the gaping holes. The spring rolls were very good and I really liked the bit of pork they put in it. The prices of the banh mi sandwiches have gone up to $5. Cash only. Good place for lunch if you're local, but it's not worth making a trip out here.",3.0
"Hands down one of the best traditional Banh Mi i've had in Brooklyn and for the most part, NYC.  They lose a quarter star for raising prices to $5 a sandwich and not doing anything new.  I picked up cha gio (spring rolls) and fortunately they are still only 50 cents a piece.  Both are very good.  All the other packaged stuff though are suspect. I've picked up a #1, which is the typical grilled pork (thit nuong) and a bbq pork patties (nem nuong) and finished them both without blinking an eye....  slathered in patè, butter, pickled daikon & carrots, cilantro, jalapeños and the meat, so yum.I washed it all down with a cup of ca phe sua nong (vietnamese hot coffee with condensed milk). Yes. They don't skimp out on this area as they are also purveyors and brewers of Café Du Monde's French coffee grounds.Oh, the spring rolls? That part is self serve so go grab a set of tongs, wrapper, and go to town. Definitely a must-try if you're heading this direction.",5.0
"Ba Xuyen is like when you're on a game show and your prize is a Pub. Complete with beer on tap and a rowdy Friday night crowd. Now that's what I call a ""Bar Win.""I think the Bahn Mi here is pretty good, but when you're comparing it to the best of the best (which for me so far is one in San Francisco, and even more so, Nam Nam of Brooklyn), you're going to end up disappointed by comparison.Still, this is tasty, it's on nice crusty bread, it's well done. I think it's the meat that doesn't come close to Nam Nam, or maybe it's just everything put together. I can't tell.So, in conclusion... a perfectly passable Bahn Mi. Good, but not great. 4 star, but not 5. Try it, but absolutely do not miss Nam Nam because I think you might come to the same conclusion as I did.And if you want to sing while you crunch your way through the Bahn Mi, just sing ""Ba Ba black sheep, have you any Xuyen?""",4.0
bamh mi for $5. what else do you need to know? oh yeah this place is not a palace. youre here to eat for five bucks. fresh ingredients and fast service even when they are very busy. i dream about the day miami gets more vietnamese restaurants that are this affordable and delicious.,5.0
Excellent Vietnamese Sandwich! Their spring rolls were large and delicious. The fish sauce that goes with them was perfect. They say you haven't tried Vietnamese sandwiches until you have tried this place and now I know why.  WOW!!,4.0
"I'd been meaning to come here for years now! Saturday afternoon, I finally decided to go out of my way just to try a bahn mi from here! I got the #1 sandwich and it came out to be $5. It wasn't too crowded, and I only waited less than 5 minutes for it to be ready. The sandwich was huge! I only ate half for lunch and saved the rest for dinner. It was filled with a variety of meats and sure was tasty! I'm no expert on bahn mi, and the only one I can compare it too is Saigon--but I can say this place is worth visiting! Great price, great sandwich!",4.0
The sandwich was hearty and filled with banh mi goodness. I had the #1 BBQ pork. The bread was excellent but I wished they actually spiced the pork instead of squirting BBQ sauce in. Minus a star for that cheap trick. Everything else about the sandwich was on point.,4.0
"Love this place, doesn't look like much from the outside and decor but it's all about the food. Cheap prices on a properly made Viet sandwich. It's always consistent too - food is what I expect it to be every time. A really nice balance between meats, pate, daikon, carrots, cilantro, etc. Add spicy for a nice little kick. I usually go with their shake or just iced Viet coffee, which is way stronger than your every day Starbucks. The coffee uses the famous Cafe Du Monde coffee with condensed milk, surely will wake you up. They are rarely ever super busy and sandwiches get to you within a few minutes.",5.0

"Probably the best banh mi in nyc.   Though there have been many others in the past 15 years, nothing what comes close to this pave, imho.  The bread is always just crispy enough to be delicious without tearing up your mouth.   The meats (pork, beef, chicken, pate, ham, etc) are all generously applied with just the right amount of veggies.   The staff is very nice and can speak as many languages as there are sandwich options.   The coffee could use a bit less ice, I believe.   Overall, there is no other banh mi pave for me in nyc.",5.0

"Besides the fact that Ba Xuyen has been around in forever since they first open on 61st Street on 7th Avenue, their food is amazingly authentic and hard to have it just one time.

They have a wide selection of many  Banh mi to choose from or their specialty homemade noodles soup. Don't forget about their grill chicken over rice also. I like small family places like this because you know for a fact that they put their time into each dish they served. Unlike huge franchise restaurant who aim to make money off of you and lack of quality.

my mother always comes here (over thanh da) whenever the fam is craving for a good banh mi sandwich. there's just something about their sandwiches that makes it taste great. they give the right amount of meat and the bread is crispy. we usually get the regular banh mi. it's much better compared to the other banh mi sandwich shops in brooklyn + manhattan.,5.0
"Their chicken and pork rice dished are amazing. Call ahead to put your order in, they run out quick.Their spring rolls, sandwiches, and fresh shrimp chips are good too. Definitely a place worth going to if you are in the area!!Spring rolls are crispy, sandwich bread of perfect soft on the inside, crispy on the outside, and the shrimp chips are better than the ones they give out in Chinese banquet dinners which are often very stale.",4.0
"Perhaps I wouldn't have been so disappointed by Ba Xuyen if not for all the hype. That being said, def bottom of the barrel Bahn Mi's in my book. The redeeming factor is that the sandwiches are HUUGE, like a mini torpedo haha. If your criteria for a good sammie is size, this is the place to go. I had the #1 - it was stuffed to the brim with tons of thick, chewy, fatty, greasy meat. Yes, ironically, this was not a good thing :PSome pros - pleasant staff, great bread with perfect ratio of crunch/crackly crust even late in the day, cheap prices, great desserts.",2.0

"By far the best banh mi I've had. For 5 dollars you get the deliciousness loaded in a French baguette. Easily accessible via the B70 bus stop which takes you a block or two away from the restaurant. Fast and efficient service. I've been coming here since my middle school days when we used to live in the neighborhood. Definitely recommend their avocado smoothie, made with real avocados. It's suppose to be a drink native to Vietnam. Trust me I was really reluctant on trying it at first, but it doesn't have any taste of the gooey oily taste that I was expecting. It's quite refreshing actually. I would definitely do the #1 and the avocado shake as recommended by many many of the reviews for this place. With at least 10 years of history in Sunset Park, given their food quality and consistency it doesn't surprise me that this location has yet to be evicted by the influx of high rent and gentrification hitting Sunset Park like a storm these past few years",5.0

The Advocado Shake sounds unappetizing, but we tried it and it was great shake! Rich, slightly sweet, and tasted of the fresh scooped green fruit. The other amazing thing about this hole in the wall is its a melting pot for the neighborhood locals. We went in on a Saturday morning and there were all these neighborhood elderly men, hanging out with their one cup of coffee, speaking Mandarin, Cantonese, Toisanese, English and Spanish.

"Lived up to every positive review it has on Yelp! I ordered 2 different (spicy) Banh Mi's for $5 each, the #1 (with sliced ham) and #3 (with shredded pork). First, I just want to get this small knock out of the way and that is the spicy Banh Mi's were really not spicy at all. If I didn't know they were supposed to be spicy, I would've assumed they were just the regular non-spicy ones.As for which Banh Mi I preferred, I was a bigger fan of the #3 because I loved the flavors from the shredded pork, however both Banh Mi's were excellent in flavor still! The bread on the Banh Mi's were toasted and very crispy when I bit into them. The bread wasn't too soft, but wasn't hard either. The generous amout of ingredients (cilantro, raddish and carrots) was absolutely a welcome sight. Also, Ba Xuyen doesn't hold back as they make some of the largest Banh Mi's I've ever seen, length-wise. I didn't know if I was eating a $5 footlong or an actual Banh Mi, that's how big the sandwich was! One sandwich will definitely fill a person up and is the equivalent of a full meal. I do want to mention a few side notes too regarding the restaurant and service. When I ordered, the woman making the Banh Mi's was very engaging and friendly. The cashier was also equally as nice as she informed me of which Banh Mi's were spicy that I ordered and which ones weren't. Ba Xuyen has a few tables inside and I highly doubt they ever get crowded, so if you ever want to sit inside and eat, it probably isn't an issue.",5.0

"Traveled far and long...but i found you.Was recommended to me by another Yelper as well as the boyfriend.Sandwiches ranges from $4 and up.  I was also told the milk tea was amazing.  so knowing me...i had to try...and i was bored that day.Got me a #1 (which is the classic i guess) and a milk tea...$7 flat.The place isn't super fancy and it aint all pretty.  I didn't see any hot sauce laying on the tables and wasnt too sure where they would be so i didnt bother.The banh mi was definitely different than any that i had in manhattan, the meat is a little different.  And this is not saying it is bad, its interesting and i liked it kinda way.  I have a feeling they used chinese bbq pork? maybe?  but for sure, its not the same as Banh Mi Saigon or Saigon Shack.  It is also a bit messier than any i had here in NYC, the sauce is applied thickly so you get it in your bite but it tends to ooze out as well.  The bread is very well buttered and you can smell it.  The milk tea is not like the ones you get at boba place...it is literally tea and slightly sweeten milk.  If you want milk tea but not so heavily sugar, this is a place for you.  I kinda liked it because it was more crisp and clean instead of the crapload of sugar and unknown things in most boba place.Will love to come here again",4.0

"In the most random of areas, in what I'd like to think in one of the smallest and most quaint Asian neighborhoods, stands a precarious restaurant which most passersby wouldn't even glance at. But if you happen to be in the area, I beg you to stop and take note of what you're about to miss out on. Ba Xuyen sells the best Banh Mi in the New York metropolitan area that I've had so far.The interior looks like your typical Chinese take out, except there's no visible kitchen within eye's view. It's simply a counter, with the menu plastered above, and two very friendly Asian women with big smiles. I opted for their #1 which is Banh Mi Pate Thit Nguoi ($5.00) and asked for it Spicy. Included in the sandwich are slices of Ham, Head Cheese, Pork Roll, Pork Teriyaki, & BBQ with Pate and Butter. Vegetables are also served in it, consisting of Cucumber, pickled carrots and daikon, Cilantro, and Green Pepper. In a few minutes, my sandwich was served and I was on my way into a blissful state of deliciousness.To begin with, the french baguette was of the utmost quality. Fresh, airy, with an excellent crispy exterior crust. It was far from overly flaky, that some Vietnamese banh mi's make the mistake of doing. Then came the meats and vegetables, all complimenting each other harmoniously. No one ingredient overwhelmed the next, something I'm much too accustomed of having too much pickled carrots and cucumber at one too many Vietnamese establishments. The fatty BBQ pork took it to new levels as well as the pate. Flavors of savory, sweetness, saltiness, sourness from the pickled vegetables. Textures of crispness, crunchy, gelatinous from the BBQ pork. Putting that all together equates to one very complex and superior banh mi that reigns supreme. There was nothing to really complain about, but everything to compliment about. But if there was ONE thing I could have critiqued, it was that the spicy version of the sandwich had only a hint of spiciness. Most casual spice eaters would not even notice. For those more enthused spice eaters, you may be let down. That crown goes to Nhu Lan's Dac Biet, which is in Chicago, Illinois. But don't let that get your hopes up. The #1 Banh Mi Pate Thit Nguoi is one fantastic sandwich that I will be back for, as well as to try their other banh mi's.If you're on a quest for the best banh mi, I highly recommend you make your way out to Ba Xuyen and give them a try.

"Everyone has a favorite Banh Mi place.  Right?  This is our favorite.  They use butter rather than mayo.  What is better than fresh bread, crisp on the outside but soft in the middle, warm, with butter, a variety of meats topped with pickled vegetables and cilantro.  By the way, order by number to make the process go more smoothly.",4.0
wasn't all it was cracked up to be.,2.0
"I must not lead a very exciting life, because today, my life was altered by a banh mi.  Due to certain dietary restrictions, I've never been able to fully experience the banh mi (or so I've been told... ""Oh well you HAVE to have the pork"" or ""Well no you have to it with pate"", are the usual excuses I hear).  But no longer.  Today, I had the Chicken Fu from Ba Xuyen... and it was exquisite.  They nailed everything about the sandwich... from the perfectly toasted bread, to the loads of veggies, to the perfectly shredded and seasoned chicken.  I might have liked it a bit spicier, but I'm not complaining.  At $5, this huge sandwich is a steal.Added bonus points for really good milk teas.",4.0
"Banh Mi sandwichs are legit here. They also have a durian shake that is nice to wash down with. Not too expensive, about 5 dollars each and many different types available. Favorite one is the #1.",5.0
Great food and friendly staff. I highly recommend the avocado shake to go with any of the sandwiches. Their noodle soup is also very tasty.,5.0
"This is as good is gets for Banh Mi: $4.50 in a no-frills little place with people serving you that speak no English and barely look at you.Add an Avocado Shake for $3.50 to one of the best Banh Mi you could ever ask for, and you have an incredibly satisfying meal for just $8.I got the Chicken one, which was more flavorful than any other Chicken Banh Mi I've ever had. It was nice and hot, with really crusty and chewy bread, and very neatly packed and composed with all of the great ingredients you would expect.If only this weren't all the way in Borough Park, I would come way more often to try some more of the great-looking sandwiches on the menu.",5.0

"When I was 12, I was in an extracurricular program called Prep for Prep, taught by fancy Manhattan private school teachers. The Latin teacher was one of my favorites - a bald, squat British guy who knew we were all completely charmed by his accent.

Belliiiissimus is a supuhhhhlative.""That story was just an excuse to say that Ba Xuyen's banh mi are supuhhhhhhhlative.These delicious Vietnamese sandwiches are big, always fresh, unfailingly delicious, and $5. The baguette is crisp and soft without being too flaky or spongy. The classic (#1) includes BBQ pork, but not the crumbled crap! It's real, thick slices of BBQ pork, which I've rarely ever seen.I always ask for spicy, but the spice is mild, just a touch of Sriracha mixed into the mayo. That's okay, though. They give you plenty of cilantro and just the right amount of pickled vegetables. Just the right amount of everything, really: pate, cha lua. It's a sandwich that couldn't be any better unless it were laced with cocaine.*On weekend mornings, groups of middle-aged Vietnamese men just chill out drinking coffee at the limited table seating. But Ba Xuyen is a must-visit for all banh mi lovers who find themselves in Brooklyn at all. They close every day at an unforgivable 6:30pm, so get in there quick.*For my fellow psycholinguistics enthusiasts: Here's a recent linguistic analysis study out of Stanford, showing that Yelp reviewers tend to use drug metaphors in positive reviews of $ restaurants, and sex metaphors in positive reviews of $$$$ restaurants. 1-star reviews used the language of victimization and trauma with reference to crappy service.

"Was in the mood for a good banh mi, and yelp led my boyfriend and I here. Good job yelp! I got a #5 (BBQ pork) and he got a #4 (meatball). We both really liked our choices- both were spicy too. Mine from jalapeño peppers and his from spicy pickles. Fresh veggies and cilantro, not skimping on the meat, good size (I ate half of my sandwich there and am now eating the other half as a midnight snack) a very solid pick if you want a good banh mi.

Very yummy! My favorite place to go while on break from the hospital :). The bread could be softer however.. It doesn't taste fresh. The pate is very flavorful and the cilantro is fresh. The iced coffee is a little bitter but I like that it's not too sweet like some of the other standard Vietnamese coffees in the area. Overall I would highly recommend trying this place.,4.0

"Okay Ba Xuyen beats out everyone for Vietnamese Sandwiches including my former favorite place on Grand Street. Sorry I got a new favorite now and it's in Brooklyn.I wish it was closer to me!I have tried the #1, #4, and $8. All three are great. You'll see what it is when you get there. I highly recommend #1 and #8 first to try. And follow it next time with something different like I did #4. the meatball. It is not what you think it will be.The sandwiches are filling.If you go with someone, you guys can trade halves so you can try a variety. All are great that I have tried.Geez, I am having a serious craving for Ba Xuyen Vietnamese Sandwiches right now. The only problem, for me only, is that it went up 50 cents...13% increase. Yes, that saddens me since I am on a very very very very tight budget. $4.50 for a sandwich is getting pricey, again only probably for me. I grew up where $4.50 feeds you all day.FYI, no gratuity needed here because there is no table service.",4.0
"I felt like a life goal was accomplished. Long long time ago, ba xuyen used to be on 7th Ave between 60th & 61st Streets. My ma would pick this up and wait for us at home. Me and my brother loved it! Crunchy, meaty and spicy! But over the years prices went up, the competitor opened across the street and ba xuyen closed. Apparently my ma knew where they went, but never told me. *insert sad face.So on a Monday weeknight, I made a call, placed an order and picked up my viet bread a little after 6PM. Holding the warm bag, I went home and shared the # 1 (both spicy & not spicy), #8 (pork) and #9 (chicken). Okay, maybe 5 sandwiches was too much for 4 people. But, it was so good! I already want more!The #1 spicy and no spicy were no different. I actually felt that the spicy had more sauce on the bread, but in level of spiciness, there was no difference. the pork was made up of minced pork, very flavorful. Boy didn't enjoy the unique taste in it. My favorite was the chicken; tender, saucy and spicy! Boy was shocked by the kick of spicy, but I felt like the spicy #1 should have been this spicy too. Jalapenos were def present in the chicken sandwich. m m good!!! Can't wait to have more!",5.0

"Came here for brunch Saturday this past weekend after reading rave Yelp reviews. The first thing I noticed was this place got a ""B"" for its sanitation letter grade. My immediate thought was Dep't of Health got it wrong because this place looks well kept and tidy. I was wrong. When I went up to the counter to order my bahn mi sandwiches, I noticed there were a couple of flies behind the counter where they were making the sandwiches. Because I am grossed out by flies, I decided I wasn't going to eat here. The flies, however, did not deter my girlfriend from eating here, and we ordered one sandwich just for her. I was a bit annoyed at my girlfriend for wanting to eat here, considering it was just her eating while I had to sit and watch her eat. There were plenty of other places we could've gone together for bahn mi sandwiches in Brooklyn. The whole time she kept rubbing it in my face too about how good the sandwich was.

"When I came back from Haiti after 3.5 months of no banh mi whatsoever, the single food item that I craved most was a banh mi. From Ba Xuyen. I dragged my boyfriend here (all the way from Hamilton Heights, so you know it's good) and ordered two banh mi & an avocado shake. He shook my world when he very reasonably asked if we were getting two different ones to split. It's never occurred to me to deviate from the absolute perfection that is #1; any other banh mi couldn't possibly be better. I reluctantly agreed to get #8 (the grilled pork), which also looked pretty good. The prices have gone up ($5 now), but I found to my immense pleasure that it is still totally worth it. We started with the grilled pork, which was surprisingly delicious, albeit in a very different way. I was startled by the distinct hint of lemongrass, and the meat was quite reminiscent of the grilled pork that comes with vermicelli. It was tasty, but I was continually startled by the lemongrass flavor (nope, somehow didn't acclimate to it) and eagerly awaiting my half of the #1 (which I couldn't even finish, tragically, because I can eat at most 3/4 of a banh mi). The avocado shake was everything that I thought an avocado shake should be - not powdery and artificial-tasting, but not tasting solely like avocadoes through a blender. I didn't catch what she did - I assume she added sugar - but it was smooth, delicious and refreshing. I would definitely get it again. My mom surprised me with a #1 half last night and I just lit up completely and wolfed it down. I love food, but there are few foods that I adore as much as Ba Xuyen's #1. Always in my heart.",5.0
"In a weekend filled with ups and downs, Ba Xuyen was a highlight. After bookmarking this place over a year ago, I finally made it here full of expectation and hope. I wasn't let down. I got the no.1 (classic). The pate was very savory and besides the obligatory mayo I think there was another condiment in there that I couldn't put my finger on. The pickled carrots, radish and cucumber were crisp and fresh.  I had gotten mine spicy so there was some jalapeno in there too but they didn't have much kick to them, which is fine by me cuz I don't need my banh mi to be super spicy. The flavors were nicely rounded out with some fresh cilantro.  I also noticed much of the bread crumb was dug out so that mostly the crunchy, crusty part held all the ingredients together. In short, this banh mi was up there with some of the best ones I've tasted in LA and Houston - two cities with much better Vietnamese food than NY.After I finished my sandwich, I was hit with the sad realization that I don't come to this part of Brooklyn that often and it maybe some time before I get to taste these delicious sandwiches again. I patted down my belly. Could I do it? Yes I could. It was time to:RELEASE THE HEIFER!I went back up to the counter and got a no. 8 (grilled pork). The lady gave me a coy smile. This was also good and pretty much made the same way as the classic except they used grilled pork instead of ham and added some crushed peanuts.  I liked the classic more cuz I thought overall the flavors worked better together in that one. Either that or the law of diminishing marginal returns was starting to set in.I washed down both sandwiches with their excellent avocado shake which I recommend trying.  I was also eyeing the delicious looking mini egg rolls in a jar but decided against buying them since I had this vision of myself finishing the whole jar in one sitting. Sometimes I disgust myself.Worth the trek? Most definitely!",5.0

I got the no.1 (classic). The pate was very savory and besides the obligatory mayo I think there was another condiment in there that I couldn't put my finger on. The pickled carrots, radish and cucumber were crisp and fresh.  I had gotten mine spicy so there was some jalapeno in there too but they didn't have much kick to them, which is fine by me cuz I don't need my banh mi to be super spicy. The flavors were nicely rounded out with some fresh cilantro.  I also noticed much of the bread crumb was dug out so that mostly the crunchy, crusty part held all the ingredients together. In short, this banh mi was up there with some of the best ones I've tasted in LA and Houston - two cities with much better Vietnamese food than NY.After I finished my sandwich, I was hit with the sad realization that I don't come to this part of Brooklyn that often and it maybe some time before I get to taste these delicious sandwiches again. I patted down my belly. Could I do it? Yes I could. It was time to:RELEASE THE HEIFER!I went back up to the counter and got a no. 8 (grilled pork). The lady gave me a coy smile. This was also good and pretty much made the same way as the classic except they used grilled pork instead of ham and added some crushed peanuts.  I liked the classic more cuz I thought overall the flavors worked better together in that one. Either that or the law of diminishing marginal returns was starting to set in.I washed down both sandwiches with their excellent avocado shake which I recommend trying.  I was also eyeing the delicious looking mini egg rolls in a jar but decided against buying them since I had this vision of myself finishing the whole jar in one sitting. Sometimes I disgust myself.Worth the trek? Most definitely!",5.0
Been here several times for their pork bbq vietnamese sandwich. It's my favorite place in the neighborhood for banh mi!!,5.0
Out of the way (for me) but really great and also seriously cheap...Worth the drive if you find you have afternoon free. Don't expect much though in terms of appearance... Basic at best.,4.0
All prices are going up by 50 cents on all items including sandwiches. Still the best Banh Mi for the money $$$$$ anywhere in New York City. Gees a sign of the times but they don't skimp on any of the fillings. Same size not like most places that charge more and give less. Awesome!!!!!,5.0
"Venturing into Brooklyn can sometimes be a hassle for me because it's like traveling from one end of the city to the other. But sometimes it pays off if you are a fan of cheap prices and good food. If you find yourself in Borough Park Brooklyn one such place is Ba Xuyen. This place came up on my radar because nearby Bensonhurst is chock full of chinese restaurants but Ba Xuyen serves vietnamese food which is a tasty alternative. Although they serve Vietnamese food they also speak Cantonese Chinese and English which makes ordering a bit easier. I wouldn't consider this place a restaurant though there are about 3 tables you can sit at it looks more like a chinese food takeout cum bakery cum convenience store minus the lottery tickets and cigarettes but they do sell a lot of snacks like potato chips and even pop tarts.  Hanging right near their rack of chips are freshly fried shrimp chips. These giant, white, round, crispy orbs with their satisfying crunch and signature shrimp flavor is something that I usually eat during Chinese New Years but way better than any bag of Lays. A decent size bag can be had for $1.25!My friends and I decided to eat here since we had a big breakfast and wanted a light lunch. After a morning in Coney Island we stumbled into this place and ordered some Vietnamese sammies and such and had a quick lunch. We were able to try the banh mi sandiwch with pate and BBQ Pork, the grilled pork sandwich and a lunch box rice with pork and shredded pork. They also had a sardine sandwich I noticed but was not adventurous enough to try that but maybe next time.The banh mi sandwiches we ordered were pretty big and my friends went halfisies on one of them while another just ate half and decided to save the rest for dinner. They gave us everything on disposable plates and these sammies were definitely stuffed full with a good portion of meat and pickled veggies and if you prefer a spicy sandwich they will throw in some slices of jalapenos for you. The acidity of the pickled veggies cuts the saltiness of the meat. The bread was slightly chewy with a little crisp  you gotta put your teeth into it. A decent sandwich but you cannot beat the price very cheap for $4.50. I was deciding if I wanted to try their meatball banh mi but ordered the rice box lunch with grilled pork instead because I love to eat rice with everything and sometimes am too lazy to chew bread and although it was not the conventional 2 big pork chops, I can only describe them as pork nuggets fried in a special sauce with sesame seeds and other seasonings. When the lady put it on the counter I saw it and was like ooh what's that. Turns out it was my food! Awesome. It came in a clear plastic container with chilled pickled veggies like radish, carrot, cucumbers and jalapenos, a mound of rice covered in the pork nuggets and topped liberally with chopped cilantro and accompanied by a chilled side of shredded pork and vermicelli noodles. It came with a dressing of their fish sauce which I poured over everything along with a small container of their hot sauce cuz I like things spicy. Their fish sauce is a bit more darker than other places I have been to and a little more concentrated. The meat was a little on the salty side but the cold pickled veggies refreshed my mouth after each bite. Still everything was good and I was full about halfway through and left some room to munch on a few of my shrimp chips. We noticed they also serve noodle soup and spring rolls and a few other vietnamese dishes if you are not a sandwich person but it looks like that is what they specialize in.They also serve vietnamese iced coffee here if you want a nice cool drink before you leave and if you poke around in their fridge area there are some special vietnamese desserts and other desserts laid out in their baked items section.The ladies were very helpful and food came out very quickly and they even take out time to try and clean the few tables they have in the place. They even gave me a plastic bag to take my leftovers home and smiles all around at the counter.Come here if you want a cheap and quick lunch. Don't be put off by the look of the store because that's what it is not a sit down restaurant by any means but a good place if you want a viet fix because why eat Subways everyday when you can have a banh mi. Overall:3 stars for the ambience and the grocery store vibe3.5 stars for the food satisfying but I have had better5 stars for friendly service- the ladies were really nice and efficient5 stars for the price- dirt cheap",4.0
"Love this place.  I've been going for 10 years, now, and I've never really had a banh mi that measured up anywhere else.  I think the key is the bread, which is always crispy and delicious, and the emphasis on the veggies which makes a for a refreshing, stimulating treat.This is my absolute #1 street food item.",5.0

"So finally after many years of saying I would, I finally made my way over to Ba Xuyen.

It's a little out of the way to get there as it's not really close to anything or anywhere that I go to. But oh man was it ever worth the trip. Hands down the best banh mi I have had so far.I didn't want to make the trip alone so I convinced my coworker to come with me for lunch today. I ordered the #1: Banh Mi Pate Thit Nguoi (the regular pork banh mi at most places) while my coworker had the #9: Banh Mi Ga Nuong (grilled chicken). My sandwich came stuffed to the brim with huge amounts of delicious meat and pickled vegetables. Ordering it spicy came with just the perfect amount of jalapenos and sriracha so that it wasn't overpowering at all. The bread was so good too. Just the perfect amount of crustiness on the outside and a soft chewy center. Yum!I didn't try the grilled chicken but my coworker kept making sounds of pleasure and claiming it was the best he's ever had. Now to complete the picture, imaging that he was sticking copious amounts of meat in his mouth. Oh baby!The space is fairly large and has a good amounts of seats to eat in. There's also a bunch of other foods that they make as well so those are worth giving a shot. The ladies are very nice and they seem to be fluent in Chinese, Vietnamese, and English.

I had their grilled chicken sandwich and I must say it is the best one I've had. I am absolutely obsessed with Vietnamese sandwiches and I would say this place makes it perfectly.

"Let me preface this by saying that I hail from LA, so I'm really picky about my Vietnamese food because I've been spoiled rotten for years. I've been going to Bahn Mi Saigon ever since I moved to the city only because of its convenient location in chinatown, but it isn't really anything to write home about. Then I came to Ba Xuyen yesterday and now I'm still thinking about the #1 combo. I couldn't stop talking about it while I was eating it and I kept bringing it up for the rest of the day. The bread was insane - they dug out some of the innards to fit in more filling, and the bread was toasted perfectly. I might just have to take that 1.5 hour commute to Brooklyn more often just to sink my teeth into this sandwich.",5.0
"Yeah, I mean... nowhere else in Brooklyn can beat it. Best bread, fillings, phos, etc. I thought for a long time Tranh Da was really great. I just didn't realize there was better. So much better, and nearby too.PS- they make a mean ""Iced Lemon."" It's basically lemonade made to order and takes them a long time, but man is it refreshing.",5.0
"Ok the banh mi is too good to be true. Since I started eating here, I have not once went back to the other banh mi shops because they just dont taste right. The baguette they use is fresh, warm, and toasty. The pickled carrots are tangy and the cucumbers are very crispy- they brine them too!! The stalks of cilantro are fresh and green.The head cheese taste great as well as the cha lua in there. There is roast pork in here too! I can actually see and taste the pate which is so rare because most places skim on this or they do not put it in banh mi. The ratio of the filling and the baguette is just right. I love the fast service here. I have a favorite lady making my banh mi. It's the lady with the pony tail in a hat. She is about 5'6 and slim built. She makes them the best there. The shorter guy makes great avocado shakes. I watched how he made it. He used half an avocado, condensed milk, regular milk, and then he blends it all together with crushed ice. It is creamy and refreshing. Not too sweet. This cost $3.50 and it is a simple drink and I make it at home.Everyone here speaks Vietnamese. Even the customers. Most of them are hanging out and talking. The decor is very old but dont that fool you. Because this is the best place I found in NYC for banh mi. It's only $5 but every so often they raise the price- not just here but at other banh mi places too.",5.0
"i've been trying to visit this place for half a year now. but by the time i grab dinner they're already closed for the day. i finally managed to visit this past weekend for lunch and was not disappointed! is it the best viet sandwich i've ever had? no. but it is up there. we had the #1 and #5 and also tried the avocado shake as recommended. firstly, the place does look dinky from outside, and there actually is a slight stench. i cant pinpoint what the stench is .. one would think its fish sauce but no its a little off putting like something rotting. we decided to eat there anyway because it was too darn cold and we were starving. the tables and chairs all feel slightly gross too but whatever. the #1 sandwich which has all the variety of meats and the pate, was delishhhhhh. it was so satisfying. the #5 however was a little more underwhelming. it wasn't bad so it was a good choice to try it out. next time, will try out the other bbq sandwiches and rice dishes as well. the avocado shake was very satisfying - too bad it was so cold so we slowly slurped it. otherwise if it was a hot summer day it would be gone in no time.",4.0

"I'm all for hyperbole but this is not hyperbole at all:Ba Xuyen IS the best banh mi place in NYC. I absolutely love banh mi so this is a lofty statement for me to make.

I had their grilled chicken sandwich and I must say it is the best one I've had. I am absolutely obsessed with Vietnamese sandwiches and I would say this place makes it perfectly. The crunch on the bread when you take your first bite makes you want to quickly eat the entire sandwich but you realize you want to savor the yummy taste. Definitely need to try this place if you haven't already!,4.0
"Let me preface this by saying that I hail from LA, so I'm really picky about my Vietnamese food because I've been spoiled rotten for years. I've been going to Bahn Mi Saigon ever since I moved to the city only because of its convenient location in chinatown, but it isn't really anything to write home about. Then I came to Ba Xuyen yesterday and now I'm still thinking about the #1 combo. I couldn't stop talking about it while I was eating it and I kept bringing it up for the rest of the day. The bread was insane - they dug out some of the innards to fit in more filling, and the bread was toasted perfectly. I might just have to take that 1.5 hour commute to Brooklyn more often just to sink my teeth into this sandwich.",5.0
"Yeah, I mean... nowhere else in Brooklyn can beat it. Best bread, fillings, phos, etc. I thought for a long time Tranh Da was really great. I just didn't realize there was better. So much better, and nearby too.PS- they make a mean ""Iced Lemon."" It's basically lemonade made to order and takes them a long time, but man is it refreshing.",5.0
"Ok the banh mi is too good to be true. Since I started eating here, I have not once went back to the other banh mi shops because they just dont taste right. The baguette they use is fresh, warm, and toasty. The pickled carrots are tangy and the cucumbers are very crispy- they brine them too!! The stalks of cilantro are fresh and green.The head cheese taste great as well as the cha lua in there. There is roast pork in here too! I can actually see and taste the pate which is so rare because most places skim on this or they do not put it in banh mi. The ratio of the filling and the baguette is just right. I love the fast service here. I have a favorite lady making my banh mi. It's the lady with the pony tail in a hat. She is about 5'6 and slim built. She makes them the best there. The shorter guy makes great avocado shakes. I watched how he made it. He used half an avocado, condensed milk, regular milk, and then he blends it all together with crushed ice. It is creamy and refreshing. Not too sweet. This cost $3.50 and it is a simple drink and I make it at home.Everyone here speaks Vietnamese. Even the customers. Most of them are hanging out and talking. The decor is very old but dont that fool you. Because this is the best place I found in NYC for banh mi. It's only $5 but every so often they raise the price- not just here but at other banh mi places too.",5.0
"i've been trying to visit this place for half a year now. but by the time i grab dinner they're already closed for the day. i finally managed to visit this past weekend for lunch and was not disappointed! is it the best viet sandwich i've ever had? no. but it is up there. we had the #1 and #5 and also tried the avocado shake as recommended. firstly, the place does look dinky from outside, and there actually is a slight stench. i cant pinpoint what the stench is .. one would think its fish sauce but no its a little off putting like something rotting. we decided to eat there anyway because it was too darn cold and we were starving. the tables and chairs all feel slightly gross too but whatever. the #1 sandwich which has all the variety of meats and the pate, was delishhhhhh. it was so satisfying. the #5 however was a little more underwhelming. it wasn't bad so it was a good choice to try it out. next time, will try out the other bbq sandwiches and rice dishes as well. the avocado shake was very satisfying - too bad it was so cold so we slowly slurped it. otherwise if it was a hot summer day it would be gone in no time.",4.0

Wow great sandwich (less the ""crunchy cloud ears"" I get in Queens). On Sunday I had to get two sandwiches, #1 and #3, cause I got my wife hooked. I voted for the #1 and she voted for the #3. We also got the #1 (avocado) and #3 (papaya) smoothie; unique favorite and both are fantastically different for the standard smoothies we were use to.Brooklyn foodies are so lucky to have this place and you can't beat the prices!(But no cloud ears! Yo, What's with that????)",4.0
"Banh mi might just be the perfect sandwich. When done right, it strikes a flawless balance between savory meat and fresh vegetables, it is texturally intriguing thanks to a slightly crunchy yet still soft baguette, and the crisp carrots and daikon that are pickled enough to balance out every bite with acid. Add a touch of cilantro to brighten it up and a bit of hot sauce to add heat, and you're there. Ba Xuyen, if not the best banh mi I've had in NYC, is tied for the crown. Every element of their sandwich is excellent, with the layers of flavors combining to create delicious, delicious harmony. The classic is always a winner, but I'm actually partial to the grilled pork option, as the huge flavors of the marinated meat get me every time. It seems they've hiked their prices over $4 apiece, but this sizable sandwich is still a steal.Go get yourself one of these sandwiches. Find yourself a seat among the jabbering and occasionally screaming Vietnamese of the neighborhood, and enjoy.",5.0
"Like all the other reviews have mentioned, this is a great Vietnamese sandwich shop. I used to go here for years before I read all the reviews on Yelp and realized how popular it is. Usually never a wait except in the early mornings and it's a very no frills shop. There are a few tables for seating near the front of the store. I usually get the #1 or the chicken one, haven't ventured to the other items on the menu in all these years. The chicken sandwich is different in that the meat is shredded into a type of beef jerky texture, which I like. The #1 is great and has all the classic ingredients and you can tell they aren't skimping out on anything. They also have fresh spring rolls and fried rolls as well as a strong iced coffee. They do close kind of early, around 6pm so make sure to stop by before then.",5.0

"This is the best banh mi I've had in New York. It's on par with those from San Jose or Westminster. The bread is crusty and warm, the vegetables are nicely pickled (not too sour and overwhelming), and the portion of cold cuts in the dac biet is pretty generous. I've spent a long time wandering around NYC trying to find good banh mi and this is really the only one so far that reminds me of home. The guy across from me looked like he was enjoying his rice plate too - although I was too busy scarfing my sandwich to pay much attention. Next time I'll try the non-banh-mi entrees. Still, the quality of the banh mi here is worth the trip out to sunset park.",5.0
Great Banh Mi!!!It's probably the best I've had in NYC.,5.0
"Over the past 2-3 years I've tried a fair number of banh mi places around the city, and I have to say Ba Xuyen serves up the best classic banh mi (#1 on the menu) I've ever had. The bread is perfectly toasted and chewy, the veggies and cilantro fresh and crisp, and the meat plentiful. I come here semi-regularly (probably 1-2 times a month) and the quality's never waned, so you really can't go wrong. Just know that the ladies here generally won't make your sandwich spicy unless you request it - so be sure to specify when your order!Also, I almost always get the #1, but the meatball banh mi is also quite tasty. There are only two reasons this isn't a perfect 5-star review:- Some of the sandwiches are way too fatty, like the chicken leg sandwich (not on the main menu board - look for it on a paper menu) which is slathered in mayo (and maybe some butter?) and contains a bunch of chicken fat and skin. Too much.- I'm really not a fan of the tapioca they use for their bubble tea. It's almost grainy the way it falls apart. It lacks the delightful chewiness that makes drinking bubble tea so enjoyable. As a final note to all those complaining about prices going up from $4 to $4.50: really? You're really complaining about a $0.50 markup that still makes this a freakin cheap banh mi place? Come on.",4.0
"The Banh Mi place to go to!--best in NYC. Subways has nothing on these guys...for $5.00, I can eat these all week long, each day a different flavor. My favorite is the meatball. Pair it with a couple of egg rolls and a drink, all for under $10 and I walk away happy :-)",5.0

Also they spoke to me in Vietnamese. Each banh mi restaurant uses their own secret sauce and this one got me coming back,5.0
"After reading so many great reviews like Deanna W. and Samatha P. and drooling over Yvonne W.'s picture of the Ba Xuyen sandwich I had to try this place especially since I practically drive through this neighbor every weekend to visit family in Sunset Park.On Saturday I was timid, I tried the #1. Wow great sandwich (less the ""crunchy cloud ears"" I get in Queens). On Sunday I had to get two sandwiches, #1 and #3, cause I got my wife hooked. I voted for the #1 and she voted for the #3. We also got the #1 (avocado) and #3 (papaya) smoothie; unique favorite and both are fantastically different for the standard smoothies we were use to.Brooklyn foodies are so lucky to have this place and you can't beat the prices!(But no cloud ears! Yo, What's with that????)",4.0
"Banh mi might just be the perfect sandwich. When done right, it strikes a flawless balance between savory meat and fresh vegetables, it is texturally intriguing thanks to a slightly crunchy yet still soft baguette, and the crisp carrots and daikon that are pickled enough to balance out every bite with acid. Add a touch of cilantro to brighten it up and a bit of hot sauce to add heat, and you're there. Ba Xuyen, if not the best banh mi I've had in NYC, is tied for the crown. Every element of their sandwich is excellent, with the layers of flavors combining to create delicious, delicious harmony. The classic is always a winner, but I'm actually partial to the grilled pork option, as the huge flavors of the marinated meat get me every time. It seems they've hiked their prices over $4 apiece, but this sizable sandwich is still a steal.Go get yourself one of these sandwiches. Find yourself a seat among the jabbering and occasionally screaming Vietnamese of the neighborhood, and enjoy.",5.0
"Like all the other reviews have mentioned, this is a great Vietnamese sandwich shop. I used to go here for years before I read all the reviews on Yelp and realized how popular it is. Usually never a wait except in the early mornings and it's a very no frills shop. There are a few tables for seating near the front of the store. I usually get the #1 or the chicken one, haven't ventured to the other items on the menu in all these years. The chicken sandwich is different in that the meat is shredded into a type of beef jerky texture, which I like. The #1 is great and has all the classic ingredients and you can tell they aren't skimping out on anything. They also have fresh spring rolls and fried rolls as well as a strong iced coffee. They do close kind of early, around 6pm so make sure to stop by before then.",5.0

"No real complaints here. Got the #1, it was tasty.  $4.50.  Nice crispy bread. Super large sandwich. Kind of wish there was more cilantro in mine... (So I stole it out of my friends sandwich).  Whatever that mushy stuff was, it was banging. Probably the best #1 I've had.",5.0
"This is the best banh mi I've had in New York. It's on par with those from San Jose or Westminster. The bread is crusty and warm, the vegetables are nicely pickled (not too sour and overwhelming), and the portion of cold cuts in the dac biet is pretty generous. I've spent a long time wandering around NYC trying to find good banh mi and this is really the only one so far that reminds me of home. The guy across from me looked like he was enjoying his rice plate too - although I was too busy scarfing my sandwich to pay much attention. Next time I'll try the non-banh-mi entrees. Still, the quality of the banh mi here is worth the trip out to sunset park.",5.0
Great Banh Mi!!!It's probably the best I've had in NYC.,5.0
"Over the past 2-3 years I've tried a fair number of banh mi places around the city, and I have to say Ba Xuyen serves up the best classic banh mi (#1 on the menu) I've ever had. The bread is perfectly toasted and chewy, the veggies and cilantro fresh and crisp, and the meat plentiful. I come here semi-regularly (probably 1-2 times a month) and the quality's never waned, so you really can't go wrong. Just know that the ladies here generally won't make your sandwich spicy unless you request it - so be sure to specify when your order!Also, I almost always get the #1, but the meatball banh mi is also quite tasty. There are only two reasons this isn't a perfect 5-star review:- Some of the sandwiches are way too fatty, like the chicken leg sandwich (not on the main menu board - look for it on a paper menu) which is slathered in mayo (and maybe some butter?) and contains a bunch of chicken fat and skin. Too much.- I'm really not a fan of the tapioca they use for their bubble tea. It's almost grainy the way it falls apart. It lacks the delightful chewiness that makes drinking bubble tea so enjoyable. As a final note to all those complaining about prices going up from $4 to $4.50: really? You're really complaining about a $0.50 markup that still makes this a freakin cheap banh mi place? Come on.",4.0

"I traveled from Manhattan to 8th Ave for this famous sandwich place. It is clean, simple and sends off aromatic fragrance of Vietnamese cuisine. I am here to seek their Banh Mi and my mission was complete with satisfaction. The banh mi is $4.5 each, which is about as much as that in the city. We got the number 1, which is the pate with ham and pickles sandwich. The baguette is toasted to just crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The spicy sauce is creamy and hot. The combined sensation of spiciness, warmth and juiciness and freshness all at once. The bread is definitely better than Banh Mi Saigon because they still grill your sandwiches when you order instead of mass producing them and keep them on the stand-by. I just wish it is right by my house! I could eat this all day long with that aromatic Vietnamese coffee!",5.0

"I always go to Thanh Da for Banh Mi because it's much closer and their Banh Mi is really good. But since I've heard so much about Ba Xuyen I had to try it out. So on a beautiful spring day, I walked 14 blocks to Ba Xuyen to try out their Banh Mi. Yes I actually walked 14 blocks, go me! Once I arrived, I ordered the #1 sandwich and I was impressed. Compared to Thanh Da it's slightly better just slightly. But I don't think I'll make another trip any time soon since Thanh Da's make almost equally amazing Banh Mi. The sandwich run under $5 and it made me wonder why I ever paid up to $10 for a lousy sandwich in the city. For those who live near Ba Xuyen lucky you guys! You can always order a Banh Mi in the morning and eat it for lunch. That's lunch for under $5!!",4.0

Am I missing something here?  So many of my yelp friends gave it 4-5 stars and my experience with the pork Vietnamese sandwich was nowhere close to that.  My sandwich was average and it had this pate paste on the bread which I somehow tasted just as much as the pork.  There wasn't enough vegetables on it and it didn't have that spicy kick that I am used to when eating a sandwich like this.  The bread was average and no different from any other spot I've been to.  Did I even get any cilantro on my sandwich?  The only thing that saved this from being a 1 star for me was the price.  $4.50 for lunch is an amazing deal.  Im going to have to say that you should check this spot out for yourself since there are so many more positive reviews here.  I just do not agree with them.,2.0

This place definitely lives up to its billing. I had the classic #1 spicy, and I also couldn't resist buying a pack of summer rolls with peanut dipping sauce. The ladies behind the counter are pros.

I know it's tough justifying coming all the way here for one sandwich, but the good thing is, there are so many cool stores and eateries on this block to check out that it's definitely worth the trip.

"On a gorgeous sunny day such as today, I like to bust open my piggy bank and hop on the D train out to Sunset Park. True, the area harbors an impressive array of taquerias where one can put their greenbacks to good use but it is also home to one of the better bánh mi shops in nyc. No lie. As with most fine sandwiches, it starts off with excellent bread. A light, crusty baguette is freshly toasted and sets the foundation for the nine inches or so of greatness that follow. Not too flaky, not too soft or dense, but goldilocks right. My usual order is their house special #1 or ""Bánh Mì Paté Tht Ngui, a delightful assortment of pork cold cuts. There's a healthy schmear of pate, some buttery mayo and  various layers of pork. Inoffensive pork roll, Vietnamese ham, sliced roast pork, caramelized BBQ sausage and headcheese with cartilage bits. To balance this  abundance of pork, there's a good handful of crunchy daikon and carrot which have been pickled long enough to reveal a sweet tang with the obligatory spear of cucumber. Fresh, generous sprigs cilantro round out the toppings. A dash of black pepper, a few squirts of maggi laced fish sauce, and you're good to go. If you like extra heat, ask for spicy and you'll get a few slivers of jalapeno and some sriracha to amp up this lovely sandwich.Your typical House #1 banh mi? Sure, maybe. Except that the bread is just right, the innards are tasty, aplenty and assembled in perfect fashion so that each bite is akin to a romp in a playground of flavors and textures.

"I'll never forget my adventure getting to Ba Xuyen. On this fine day, the internet connection on my blackberry decided to break down on me. As I traipsed across Brooklyn, from wrong subway to wrong subway, I FINALLY remembered seeing that Ba Xuyen was near a cemetery and I ended up at the 9th Ave Station. Having resurfaced onto land, my usually crisp memory could not remember the exact address of Ba Xuyen. Out of desperation I called my kid sister, who happens to live in California and finished school last Friday (it'd be 1:00 PT), and literally had her navigate me to Ba Xuyen. Finally at Ba Xuyen's doorstep, I ordered the #1 and waffled between the two jellos in the fridge. I asked the guy at the counter what they were and how much they were and he told me they were only $1.50 each, so I promptly bought both coffee and coconut flavors.The food: Oh my gosh, maybe my 2-hour long ordeal to get here made me really hungry, but the banh mi was incredible! The bread was nearly a foot long, perfectly toasted, and the texture of the meat and pate was delicious! The mayo and the fish sauce complemented the pork wonderfully, and I savored the crunch from the carrots and daikon.And the staff was so friendly. The guy at the counter, whom I assume is the owner, asked me which jello I preferred. He seemed to take much pride in his establishment, and I wonder if he's aware how many good reviews he's gotten on Yelp. Anyway, I preferred the coconut jello over the coffee one, and it made for a cool, refreshing dessert. Next time I have a craving for banh mi, Ba Xuyen will be at the top of my list to fulfill it. And I know how to get there now.",5.0
This place makes me feel like I'm in San Jose or Milpitas again. I do believe the Vietnamese food is better on the West Coast (you can challenge me on this if you have substantial evidence).Ba Xuyen does however make one yelplicious banh mi for the price and quality. Plus the ladies behind the counter are usually quite nice and thoroughly entertained by my Chenglish. The bread is toasted and there is a selection of other goodies if you choose not to go the sandwich route.Two friends actually just went on a romantic getaway to Vietnam...the food must be phenomenal.,3.0
"Visiting from Boston, this was my first chance to try a real good vietnamese sub with fresh bread and all the legit fillings.  Had #1 and an avocado shake, 7$.  AMAZING.  I shared some of the avocado shake with my fiance and this combo still had me soo full.  For lunch you could easily split this meal, but it is so good you will want to eat it all.  Went non-spicy and it still had great flavor.  I am getting hungry just thinking about it.  I need to get back to NYC soon to visit Ba Xuyen.  This time I won't wait until my last day there to go.  I'll be there everyday.",5.0

I always get their BBQ pork and avocado shake. They do not disappoint. They have the best banh mi sandwiches I ever had.

"It's true. This is the best banh mi I've had in NYC. Actually, ever. After reading in the Daily News that Thanh da on 7th ave was notable in BK, a friend and I decided the only way to determine the best was to try both places. So we did. And even though I had Ba Xuyen second, already full, it was so good that you simply must make room for it. The meat is much more flavorful and the bread is perfectly toasted (Thanh da's bread was overly toasted so that it was flaking all over the plate).If I were a judge on a Sunset Park throwdown challenge, I vote Ba Xuyen as the winner.P.S. they have enough tables to sit down for a bit and enjoy the deliciousness.",5.0
"Ba Xuyen definitely serves the best Bahn Mi! The trek through the shady streets of Sunset Park is worth it.I had an early break at work and surprisingly found out they were open at 7am on a Saturday morning!!! I was even more surprised to find out they serve Bahn Mi at that time. I am not a big fan of breakfast foods so guess what I ordered?! I ordered the #1 which is Pate and BBQ pork. It was served on a fresh toasted hero. It was soooo good! I also had a 75 cent veggie and pork roll. It was pretty good though a little slightly over crispy. As another reviewer said, the sandwiches are pretty filling. Order a iced milk tea for a nice caffeinated boost.",4.0
"Ah, the banh mi destination of Brooklyn (perhaps NYC?). Enough lauding has been bestowed upon the establishment's banh mi sandwiches that I will just keep it short and sweet. I really love that when you ask for spicy, you actually find slices of chili peppers along with a healthy dosage of Sriracha. Aside from its famed sandwiches, this place also makes an excellent grilled chicken thigh over rice lunch box. The chicken is full of lemongrass flavor and served over rice with pickled radish and carrot on the side.",4.0
"Fantastic BBQ bahn mi! The bread is fresh and toasty, which is really the highlight of the sandwich. I also got an iced milk tea with it, and that was also really good. Staff is super friendly, and the store was empty so I got to sit and enjoy my sandwich - which is huge and filling.",4.0
They raised the prices to 5 dollar for each banh mi ;(. The grilled pork sandwich tastes different now with peanuts in it and they put too much ice in the iced coffee.

Anyway, I preferred the coconut jello over the coffee one, and it made for a cool, refreshing dessert. Next time I have a craving for banh mi, Ba Xuyen will be at the top of my list to fulfill it. And I know how to get there now.",5.0
This place makes me feel like I'm in San Jose or Milpitas again. I do believe the Vietnamese food is better on the West Coast (you can challenge me on this if you have substantial evidence).Ba Xuyen does however make one yelplicious banh mi for the price and quality. Plus the ladies behind the counter are usually quite nice and thoroughly entertained by my Chenglish. The bread is toasted and there is a selection of other goodies if you choose not to go the sandwich route.Two friends actually just went on a romantic getaway to Vietnam...the food must be phenomenal.,3.0
"Visiting from Boston, this was my first chance to try a real good vietnamese sub with fresh bread and all the legit fillings.  Had #1 and an avocado shake, 7$.  AMAZING.  I shared some of the avocado shake with my fiance and this combo still had me soo full.  For lunch you could easily split this meal, but it is so good you will want to eat it all.  Went non-spicy and it still had great flavor.  I am getting hungry just thinking about it.  I need to get back to NYC soon to visit Ba Xuyen.  This time I won't wait until my last day there to go.  I'll be there everyday.",5.0
Great bahn mi but i thought it was on the smaller side.  I could've probably eaten 2!,4.0
I always get their BBQ pork and avocado shake. They do not disappoint. They have the best banh mi sandwiches I ever had. Thank god this is in Brooklyn but I wish they weren't located so far down from the mini Chinatown in 8th ave.I haven't at this in a while and am currently craving for it. Ugh. :(,5.0
"It's true. This is the best banh mi I've had in NYC. Actually, ever. After reading in the Daily News that Thanh da on 7th ave was notable in BK, a friend and I decided the only way to determine the best was to try both places. So we did. And even though I had Ba Xuyen second, already full, it was so good that you simply must make room for it. The meat is much more flavorful and the bread is perfectly toasted (Thanh da's bread was overly toasted so that it was flaking all over the plate).If I were a judge on a Sunset Park throwdown challenge, I vote Ba Xuyen as the winner.P.S. they have enough tables to sit down for a bit and enjoy the deliciousness.",5.0
"Ba Xuyen definitely serves the best Bahn Mi! The trek through the shady streets of Sunset Park is worth it.I had an early break at work and surprisingly found out they were open at 7am on a Saturday morning!!! I was even more surprised to find out they serve Bahn Mi at that time. I am not a big fan of breakfast foods so guess what I ordered?! I ordered the #1 which is Pate and BBQ pork. It was served on a fresh toasted hero. It was soooo good! I also had a 75 cent veggie and pork roll. It was pretty good though a little slightly over crispy. As another reviewer said, the sandwiches are pretty filling. Order a iced milk tea for a nice caffeinated boost.",4.0
"Ah, the banh mi destination of Brooklyn (perhaps NYC?). Enough lauding has been bestowed upon the establishment's banh mi sandwiches that I will just keep it short and sweet. I really love that when you ask for spicy, you actually find slices of chili peppers along with a healthy dosage of Sriracha. Aside from its famed sandwiches, this place also makes an excellent grilled chicken thigh over rice lunch box. The chicken is full of lemongrass flavor and served over rice with pickled radish and carrot on the side.",4.0
"Fantastic BBQ bahn mi! The bread is fresh and toasty, which is really the highlight of the sandwich. I also got an iced milk tea with it, and that was also really good. Staff is super friendly, and the store was empty so I got to sit and enjoy my sandwich - which is huge and filling.",4.0
They raised the prices to 5 dollar for each banh mi ;(. The grilled pork sandwich tastes different now with peanuts in it and they put too much ice in the iced coffee. I was disappointed but im willing to give it another try if i come to the neighborhood again. Hopefully their meatball banh mi is still as good.,2.0
"Awesome bánh mì!!!!!! I usually have the grilled pork -- the bánh mì (buns) are always crunchy, the pork is delicious. Best place in the city for sure.",5.0
"Will you believe me if I tell you that I walked more than 20 blocks on a hot summer day right after work just to get a sandwich here? Yep, I did. The plan was to get a Vietnamese sandwich at Thanh Da on 7th ave and 61st St. But after looking at the reviews via Yelp blackberry app, my friends and I decided to walk here instead. They both get great reviews but I didn't know why we decided to go to the further one when we were right in front of Thanh Da already.I was tired and hungry, so without much thinking, I knew what I wanted to get and I ordered immediately. Me: ""Hi, Can I get 2 #1, please?"" The lady behind the counter: ""Spicy?""Me: ""One spicy, and can I get the peppers on the side for the other one?""lady: ""Sure""Me: ""Thanks""--- went to wash my hands then waited for a bit more ---lady: ""$7.50""Me and my friend: *give the lady the money*That $7.50 is for 2 AMAZING foot-long Vietnamese sandwiches. At $3.75 each, this place is a bargain! This place owns Subway's famous $5 foot-long! Fresh ingredients, tasty fillings, I seriously could not ask for more. It was that good. The bread, oh the bread! Perfectly toasted that it's crunchy on the outside, soft and moist on the inside. Oh Em Gee.. Bread crumbs everywhere! Because it was so crunchy.. I don't know if crunchy is the right word to describe it, but you get the idea. My friend and I split the sandwich because it's huge! And I took the other one home for my mom. The half sandwich filled me up but was not enough to satisfy my big appetite, so my friends and I planned to go to Thanh Da right after eating here to do a comparison. But that did not happen when we decided to try Ba Xuyen's avocado and jackfruit shakes. The shakes will fill you up quickly so I recommend to share it with a friend. I liked my jackfruit shake; it was sweet, creamy and refreshing! My friend's avocado shake on the other hand, I had some problems with. I don't know if it was just me or it's the shake, but I could not taste anything but cream!If you want a cheap, delicious and fresh meal, come here!If you are ""watching your figure"", don't get the shake! because I honestly believe it has close to 1000 calories.If you are too lazy to come try this place, well it's your loss! I'm so happy to find this place since I'm currently obsessed with Vietnamese sandwiches. Definitely coming back !Note: #1 sandwich consists of pate, bbq pork, ham, pork roll and pickled veggies.",5.0
"#5 bbq and #1 are good. I haven't had any other Vietnamese sandwiches, but these are so good.Why is this bread so good? And why are these carrots in my sandwich? Is this meat cooked all the way? These are some things you might be asking yourself. It's an experience, and its delish.",4.0
"The best part of any sandwiches is the bread. The bread at this place has the right texture, not too soft and not to hard and when it is toasted, it's just right.

"I love Vietnamese street sandwiches and consumed tons of them while in Vietnam and around my neighborhood in LES-- I heard a lot about this place so I thought I would try it. I wasn't in the mood to have pork, so they left me with two options: a vegetable banh mi or one with chicken. Normally Vietnamese places offer you a ""chay"" version, essentially vegetarian with tofu. Their meatless version didn't even include tofu. I ordered the chicken which sucked. Chicken was disgustingly salty, their peppers weren't spicy, and they added tons of mayo. I don't even remember the sandwiches in Vietnam having mayo. The staff were nice, but they were Chinese and told me they had never been to Vietnam. Fnally I asked for a Vietnamese coffee, which normally comes strong and thick, which turned out to be too sweet and with milk (not even condensed milk which they normally use). There are so many better options around my neighborhood (LES/Chinatown) so I don't think I'll be heading back...",2.0
"Over Rated.This is coming from a Westminster, Orange County Banh Mi Professional.We live around the corner from the best one in town.The meat is just ok - they mixed a couple of chinese/vietnamese flavors together, which made it not so authentic tastingPickled veggies were goodHad a avocado shake as well. Wasn't super impressed. Begin to think that the food here can't match Little Saigon.",3.0
"Delicious, cheap, and fast! They don't have any veggie or vegan offerings like Lotus, but for carnivores, this is the place for Viet sandwiches. They also have milk teas, smoothies, and spring rolls. Definitely stop by for a hearty homemade lunch for about $8.",5.0
"This is definitely the best of this style of food you're going to get in ANY of these fine boroughs we call NYC.

Having come back from living overseas for the past two years, I couldn't wait to get back to CA and have some Banh mi. I was pleasantly surprised when I found this place and realized I wouldn't have to wait. Everything is legit here, from the sandwiches to the shakes to the snacks. The only thing missing is some pate chaud. That and maybe that the menu is a little toned down. I didn't see any offering some of the more ""special"" parts, but I may have just not noticed. The other reviews are spot on about getting the number 1. But all of the choices here are really good.",4.0

To my surprise, they stuck the meatballs in a microwave to heat it up. Now I don't expect them to cook it to order, but couldn't they at least use a mini oven? Needless to say, the meatballs came out rather spongy, and tasted like . . . well, like if it was microwaved. Luckily, the rest of the sandwich was actually pretty darn good. Brownie points for the tangy sauce. There's no question that it would've tasted much better if it wasn't heated in a microwave, but since it was, I'll have to settle with a 3 rating.",3.0

But pair it with a dash of their special sauce (vinegar?) and take into account the crisp veggies, it's a perfect combo.You also must have the avocado milk shake. There is one particular lady who makes it better than the rest. It's kind of hard to describe her but she's one of the older ones there.

"Hands down the best banh mi...ever!  :D  I usually order either #4 (meatball) or #5 (BBQ).  I'm never disappointed. And I always have an extra half to bring back home.  To drink, its always a Iced Coffee or the Ice Lemon Tea.  Both taste great.  I tend to order the coffee a lot more, because I'm a coffee lover and it's just so frikken good!  The coffee is made the right way, strong!  Its not overly sweet, so you won't cringe with each sip. Bread is baked fresh daily.  Perfect crunch every time!  They don't skimp on the fillings either.  You can customize it if you want it spicy or not.  I was introduced to this place in 2006, and I've been coming back ever since.  The prices have since then increased a bit, but the flavor and the quality has remained the same!  My friends and I venture out from Queens just to get these bad boys. Its definitely worth the trip. Your stomach will love you! Mine always does. :)",5.0
"This place is pretty good. I got the number 1, pork and pate. The bread is amazing, one of the best baguettes you can get anywhere.The sandwich itself is good but not as good at the pate sandwich at nam son in chinatown and thai son in jackson heights. The daikon and carrots are not pickled enough, very very mild, and the pate really is not present in the sandwich, you barely taste it.

"This is the best Banh Mi place I've experienced in NYC. I live a few blocks and an avenue away and I come here about once a week if I can help it. And every time I do I am reminded why Brooklyn is such a great place to live: unmatched quality in authentic ethnic foods and low prices!It is inexpensive and they have the best Vietnamese sandwiches in the city. I've tried other places in Brooklyn that were good, too, but this place really tops them all with their authentic flavors, [tasty] variations on the traditional banh mi, and their unmatchable baguettes!It has been mentioned before: the baguettes that they use for the sandwiches are amazing. They are perfectly crunchy, flaky, fluffy, and always fresh. I don't know where they get them, but the man who works there once announced 'you don't get this bread in grocery store!'Which is true.The atmosphere is very casual, take-out style. The ladies who work there are very nice and welcoming. Always a plus. Oh, and they have good egg rolls, too.Now let's talk about the milkshakes. They make an avocado milkshake here that is smooth, creamy, and refreshing. I was so curious at first, and now I don't know why I was ever skeptical. I love the subtletly of the flavor. I've also tried their jackfruit, lychee, and strawberry milkshakes: the strawberry was pretty ordinary, though still very good; the lychee and jackfruit were very sweet, so if you want a more sugary yum yum flavor, those two are for you.I love vietnamese iced coffee as well, and theirs is top notch.Credentials: I'm from Seattle, which has a large Vietnamese population and large amount of very authentic and very good Vietnamese food. My roommate is first gen Vietnamese (and also from Seattle).

"Many of the great Banh Mi sandwich shops around New York each bring something different to the table.

I can tell you that none seem to disappoint.Walking in, you really don't get the impression that your in for a really great sandwich.

Its best if you order using their number system and letting the staff know your spice preference.A few moments later, your Banh Mi comes out and is ready to consume. The bread is traditional baguette and while not extraordinary, is still quite good and toasty. Each sandwich is filled with a wonderful balance if meats, spices, sweet picked veggies and Cilantro.

The bread is the softest french baguette around and the meat is authentically Vietnamese. There is no way to describe how fresh this banh mi tastes.

"Good, but it won't change your life.I headed down to Sunset Park to finally try the ""real deal"" banh mi. I ordered the #1, which is the pate banh mi.The good - bread was seriously good. Dense on the inside, crispy and airy on the outside. The aroma of freshly baked bread permeated every bite, which is what made Ba Xuyen unique. Meat was of seriously good quality, consisting of rich salty ham and savory pate. Mayo and butter acted as complements, not too overpowering for the sandwich. Veggies of daikon, cucumber, shredded carrot, and cilantro were super crisp and liberally added, which was nice.The not so good - I didn't love the hot sauce. It was red, tomato-y, and tangy -- tasting more like reduced gazpacho or clamato (I am not kidding!) than your typical Asian hot sauce. The sauce actually kind of ruined things for me, as I couldn't get over the taste. The overall taste profile of the sandwhich was more or less savory, and less sweet and tangy as what you'd get in Manhattan's Chinatown. I don't know, I chalk it up to personal preference, but I am always lured by the lightly pickled vegetables + sweet pork + creamy mayo combo of Chinatown banh mi's. Ba Xuyen, in contrast, put more emphasis on the bread + cold cut meats + cold cut (read: raw) veggies + the wretched hot sauce. It was good, but not my favorite.",3.0

"I've been on a quest to find really good banh mi in NYC.  What qualifies as REALLY GOOD?  Well, as far as the classic or combo goes...1) The meat and veggies to bread ratio, they can't be stingy.2) The texture of the toasted baguette, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.3) The taste of everything while I'm chewing.  I have to be able to taste the pate (and it can't be too gamey), pickled carrots and daikon, cilantro, cucumber and all of the various cuts of meats.Best banh mi I've had so far in NYC!  It's also the closest tasting banh mi to how it's made in San Francisco.  VERY FLAVORFUL and great portions.  The bread was also nicely toasted.  Love their #1.  Definitely a fan and I can't wait until I come back to eat another.",5.0
"Ba Xuyen has the look/ feel of a shop that was reminiscent of my favorite banh mi shop, lee's sandwiches on the west coast...an assortment of banh mis, frozen drinks, coffees, and other snacks that could inspire hours of eating.  However the number 8 banh mi was a little disappointing considering the trek getting to sunset park to try it.  While the $4 price tag on the number 8 grilled pork banh mi was definitely nice, the actual sandwich didn't live up to the (probably unreachable) lofty expectations.  The bread was crisp on the outside and soft and chewy just like any great banh mi bread, but the inside of the sandwich tasted a lot more like mayo than it did the grilled pork and pickled vegetables that you'd expect.  The little pork that was in the sandwich didn't have the grill/bbq flavor that you'd usually get out of a ""grilled pork"" banh mi and while the pickled carrots/cucumbers were good, there just wasn't enough to overtake the mayo. On the positive side, Ba Xuyen's vietnamese coffee was thick, rich, and strong, and my friend's iced ovaltine drink took him back to his childhood. There's also seating so that we were able to seek warmth and eat our sandwiches comfortably. Is it worth the trip to Sunset Park? If you're already there for Yun Nan snack or for dim sum at pacificana, sure why not. But I wouldn't make it the focal point of your trip.",3.0

"Ba Xuyen has the look/ feel of a shop that was reminiscent of my favorite banh mi shop, lee's sandwiches on the west coast...an assortment of banh mis, frozen drinks, coffees, and other snacks that could inspire hours of eating.  However the number 8 banh mi was a little disappointing considering the trek getting to sunset park to try it.  While the $4 price tag on the number 8 grilled pork banh mi was definitely nice, the actual sandwich didn't live up to the (probably unreachable) lofty expectations.  The bread was crisp on the outside and soft and chewy just like any great banh mi bread, but the inside of the sandwich tasted a lot more like mayo than it did the grilled pork and pickled vegetables that you'd expect.  The little pork that was in the sandwich didn't have the grill/bbq flavor that you'd usually get out of a ""grilled pork"" banh mi and while the pickled carrots/cucumbers were good, there just wasn't enough to overtake the mayo. On the positive side, Ba Xuyen's vietnamese coffee was thick, rich, and strong, and my friend's iced ovaltine drink took him back to his childhood. There's also seating so that we were able to seek warmth and eat our sandwiches comfortably. Is it worth the trip to Sunset Park? If you're already there for Yun Nan snack or for dim sum at pacificana, sure why not. But I wouldn't make it the focal point of your trip.",3.0
"I've only been here once so far, but I'll certainly be back. I got the traditional banh mi--it was my first. The baguette was perfect--crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside. The vegetables were fresh and crunchy and a perfect complement to the meat and the hot sauce. And I have to comment on the size--almost a foot long for only $3.75. Those stupid Subway ads for $5 footlongs mean nothing to me anymore. The women at the counter were friendly and the place has a comfortable hole-in-the-wall atmosphere while still seeming very clean.

Cool cucumber, spicy sauce, warm bread and warm chicken.  It is worth the trip from Manhattan. Only a few blocks from the D train 39 street Station, this gem offers great food.  Coffee is fantastic. The French influence shines in the bread and the coffee. The fusion: amazing sandwiches.  The fish soup is really tasty. Clear. Not spicy. A great choice for a winter day.  Don't forget the steamed spring rolls. Hurry if you want the rolls. They sell out in a blink of an eye.  The shop has great cookies: peanut ones are not over sweet. Good combo with a coffee.  Love their elephant ears mini size when they have them. You cannot go wrong with the food. Ba Xuyen also offers plates. I believe their grade is ""A"" now.",5.0

"After trying different banh mi all over NYC/Brooklyn, I say with no hesitation that Ba Xuyen has the best vietnamese sandwiches in the area.  A fact only made sweeter by the price point here, $3.75 a sandwich.Although slightly inconsistent, their inconsistency only goes so far as to make ""one of the best damned sandwiches you'll ever eat"" into ""an amazingly great sandwich.""I have taken everyone I can to Ba Xuyen, and even those who have initially been hesitant had to admit once they bitten through that warm crusty french baguette into the juicy contents within that the sandwiches here are seriously good.There are 8 sandwich variations on the menu including the classic banh mi.  I once ate at Ba Xuyen four times in one week.  It's that good (although, for the record, as good as it is, I don't recommend the all banh mi diet).  I usually opt for the classic (#1 on the menu), but the ""Grilled Pork"" (#8) is also an excellent choice.   I don''t care for the sardine version, although I do like sardines.  It was just too salty, and the sardines really overpowered the rest of the ingredients of the sandwich.  The balance between the ingredients in a good banh mi is really something wonderful, and I just don't think the sardine version here at Banh Mi lives up to the high standard the rest of the sandwiches have set here.Half the sandwich will usually leave me nicely satisfied, although it's easy to pack away the whole thing now and then.  If you want to save half, they're great later in the day or even tomorrow.  Put it in the fridge, and take it out like 15 mins before you want to eat it so the sandwich wont be all cold and hard.They do not offer a legitimate vegetarian option (no tofu sandwich), but will happily make one of all veggies for you if you ask.  Personally though, I have no idea why you would want this, I'd say you should give up on the whole vegetarianism thing to try a bite of heaven.  If you really want it, there are some noodle/rice dishes available in the cooler normally...As far as those other options go (like the noodles in the cooler), I'd personally tell you to just skip them unless something really speaks to you.  This place is all about the Banh Mi.They also offer bubble teas, vietnamese coffee (condensed milk galore) and shake-type drinks.  I got an avocado shake once and it was surprisingly pleasant, with a very refreshingly cool taste.There's limited seating inside when there are rushes, but if the weather's nice out you can just go sit on the stoop outside, or take your sandwich to the park (I usually find myself unable to wait that long).oh!!  as a post script, you've got two options with the sandwiches here.  ""Spicy"" (jalapeños & sriracha) or ""No Spicy.""  It's not worth trying to explain that you want only sriracha for instance.  If you want a milder version, I recommend asking for ""no spicy,"" and when you get your sandwich requesting a small cup of sriracha so you can heat it up yourself.",5.0

"About a year ago I spent two weeks in the motherland (specifically, Quy Nhon and Ho Chi Minh City), and there are very few places (about 2) in the U.S. that have produced banh mi that have lived up to the ones I ate while I was back in Vietnam. Some key criteria: 1) Right combination and pickled-ness of the radish and carrot. The sourness that these bring is very important to creating the overall banh mi experience. 2) Cuts of meat -- if you are in Vietnam and you get a banh mi off the street (this is how most locals get their banh mi), it will almost always come with a combination of cuts of meat -- that usually includes head cheese, cha lua, shredded pork, thin cuts of ham, among others. 3) Pate -- must have pate, and not just any pate -- really porky, livery pate. Also, there tends to be a mix of mayonnaise and some sort of bbq sauce.4) Hot peppers - they always have hot peppers (I'm a bit of a wimp, though, so I tend to take them out).  5) BREAD -- this might be the most important component if you ask many Vietnamese people. The French roll cannot just be any roll; it must be crisp on the outside, but airy and light on the inside and overall. A heavy roll is a big mistake. ""Airy"" is the word of the day for banh mi-suitable bread. Few places I have been to in the U.S. that make banh mi have that airy quality in the bread roll, perhaps because it's pretty hard to replicate. But Ba Xuyen succeeds -- the bread is so light and airy that it's almost like it has less carbs in it because it seems barely there! The #1 banh mi combination option hits all of the above criteria. MAN is that pate good, and all the different components together create perfect harmony for the ideal banh mi. This place is also great because they serve a good variety of other authentic Vietnamese dishes/snacks, like banh beo and mung bean sweets. I cry and cry thinking that it's taken me 9 months to find this place since moving to New York, but now I know where to get my banh mi fix.. Even if it takes an hour from my apartment to here, this banh mi is more than worth it.***Side note: the avocado shake is AMAZING - creamy, perfect amount of sweetness, great subtle avocado taste (yes, they put real avocado in this), with great ice cream.

"Ba Xuyen has the best banh mis!  The #1 banh mi (with traditional sliced vietnamese ham, headcheese), #8 grilled pork (with peanut satay - yum ) & #9 grilled chicken (with garlicky spread & fried garlic chips) are all delicious.  I also tried the #5 bbq, but it's not barbequed at all, the texture resembles more of a spam-like piece of meat, but tasier, sweeter & more tender.  The #5 is good, but it' s not bbq as its name stated.  Their banh mis are great and I think the secret to their delicious banh mis is the bread.  It's toasty on the outside & soft on the inside.  Delicious!",5.0

"This is probably the best banh mi in ny. The bread is perfect - like a French baguette except not hard and perfectly toasted and warm. Their banh mi (#1) has a more traditional flavor than Baoguette's, and everything tastes fresh and executed perfectly. Their grilled pork (#8) was also amazing - some secret sauce or veggie or flavoring in there, SO good. Not sure which I liked more. The shredded pork (#3) was pretty bad (all vermicelli inside and weirdness, no meat hardly) - we more or less threw it away (not a big deal at 4.50 a sandwich - I know I know (baller). I wouldn't come here regularly bc it's sort of far, unless u couple it with an exploration of the nearby Brooklyn Chinatown.

"I grew up not far from here on the ""Latin"" side of Sunset Park. I wish I still lived there so I can came back anytime I want. This place is no-frills, cheap, yummy goodness. My sister introduced me to this place after we went on a nice hike upstate and boy did this ever hit the spot. She had the meatball, I had the chicken. She got the avocado shake, me the lychee. Everything was a huge hit. It was served with care, they don't rush and they ask how much spice you want to be sure your order is exactly to your liking. My sandwich was really delicious. Like really, really delicious. Did I mention it was delicious? We walked in not super hungry, thinking we'd eat half and take the rest home. Nope, we ate them all and licked the crumbs off the table (well not really, that would be unsanitary).The lychee shake was delicately sweet, the avocado shake was super duper thick but yummy (we called it an avocado frosty).

The #1 BBQ Pork is always a solid choice -- it has never failed to satisfy my banh mi cravings.Now, if you manage to satisfy your Banh Mi craving, try the Fish Ball Noodle Soup or the Congee. Those are the items written in Chinese next to the cash register.If you're not terribly hungry but have room for a quick snack, they have a variety of non-banh mi items such as eggrolls, yucca cake, bubble tea & a cold case stocked with American and SE Asian beverages.",4.0
"#1 + spring rolls is the best things here. I come here 2-3 times a month and love it every time.  I must say the only thing I dislike about the sandwich is it fatty pieces of meat.. I just usually take it out, but aside from that everything is good to go. My family also likes the Vietnamese congee here, If you like the fish sauce you'll probably like this congee also, it has various intestine meat and meat with beans sprouts. This I would have to say, is very interesting.",4.0

We also had the beef noodle, cold spring roll and also the ice coffee. It was his first time trying V Coffee, he thought it was a bit too strong, but i thought it was just perfect.

"After reading an article in The Village Voice regarding banh mi in Brooklyn's Chinatown, my BF and I ventured over to 8th Ave to try out Ba Xuyen. Yes, this place closes at 6:30PM so get there early! Sunset Park is just around the corner and these sandwiches make for a great picnic lunch.Also, although vegetarian versions of the sandwich are not shown on the menu, the staff were more than happy to make a veggies-only creation for me. I highly recommend getting it spicy too. My BF got a tuna sandwich and the tuna was super fresh--definitely not like the kind you'd find in a can at the grocery store.In all we got two sandwiches, mocha bubble tea, a papaya fruit smoothie, and two homemade dessert pastries for only $13! Cheap AND delicious! We'll definitely be going back here on weekend afternoons for an inexpensive meal.",4.0

So I just strolled the neighborhood with a big grin on my face and a bubble tea in my hand.While you're there, try their taro or red bean cakes and a bubble tea or durian shake (if you dare). You won't be disappointed. A truly perfect lunch experience.Oh, did I mention your Banh Mi will cost you a measly $3.75!! Subway can go stuff it with their $5 subs.",5.0
"I've been introducing my boyfriend to new foods. He's a pizza & burger kind of guy so Banh Mi was an adventurous choice. His initial reaction was ""ZOMG [unintelligible mumbling due to food in mouth] THIS IS SO GOOD."" Well there you go. Ba Xuyen is pretty darn tasty.I've basically tried everything on & off the menu. The #1 BBQ Pork is always a solid choice -- it has never failed to satisfy my banh mi cravings.Now, if you manage to satisfy your Banh Mi craving, try the Fish Ball Noodle Soup or the Congee. Those are the items written in Chinese next to the cash register.If you're not terribly hungry but have room for a quick snack, they have a variety of non-banh mi items such as eggrolls, yucca cake, bubble tea & a cold case stocked with American and SE Asian beverages.",4.0
"#1 + spring rolls is the best things here. I come here 2-3 times a month and love it every time.  I must say the only thing I dislike about the sandwich is it fatty pieces of meat.. I just usually take it out, but aside from that everything is good to go. My family also likes the Vietnamese congee here, If you like the fish sauce you'll probably like this congee also, it has various intestine meat and meat with beans sprouts. This I would have to say, is very interesting.",4.0

Easily the best Banh Mi I've had in NY by far.  I have it as a personal mission to go to every Banh Mi place I can and so far this place tops all the others.  Some of the other places I've been to is Banh Mi Saigon in Chinatown which is rated very high.  Ba Xuyen blows them out of the water.  I've also compared them to Nicky's sandwich shop in Brooklyn and NY as well as Banh Mi So 1 and there is no comparison.I love the fact that they use actual Nem Nuong in their #1 house special sandwich.  It makes a huge difference in the taste.  Even the drippings from the juice of the sandwich gets sopped up by my last piece of bread.  This place has become my guilty pleasure and I have found unreasonable reasons to go to Brooklyn from Queens to get these sandwiches.  I'm afraid I have become a Ba Xuyen fanboy.,5.0
The Vietnamese sandwich is really delicious! I have tried many vietnamese sandwiches from chinatown and brooklyn. This is probably the best! Extremely crunchy and meaty! Best believe it!,4.0
"ahhhhhhhhh!i have been here like 46 times and haven't written a review? what is wrong with me? for shame, molly c., for shame.so. yes. i stay with the traditional or the roast pork. yum yum. great bread, perfect ratio of fillings to bread.can't be beat.",4.0
"Bar none, the best banh mi i've had. it's cheap & delicious. The bubble tea is very good too! My fav is the taro slushy (make sure to tell them slushy, otherwise they'll make it into an iced tea) with tapioca balls. The balls are $.50 extra, but worth it.",5.0
"Delicious banh mi sandwiches right in my neighborhood. The classic #1 is great, but I love the meatball one best. Very affordable. Smallish seating area, kind of dive-y.",4.0

went to ba xuyen for the first time. i really like the #1 which me and two other people ordered. it was delicious and nothing to complain about (food wise). i also ordered a jackfruit shake (not sure what jackfruit is but it tastes great!). this place would have gotten a 5 star if we didn't see a cockroach crawling on the wall.,4.0

The banh mi is as authentic as you're gonna get in the 5 boroughs. The veggies are crisp and crunchy and have that great sweet/tangy taste.
