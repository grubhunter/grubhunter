"One of my favorite spots in Williamsburg and here's why:Great space - equally suitable for a night out with the guys or an intimate date, nice ambianceMy current favorite Burger in Williamsburg, and it's reasonably priced. Comes with hand cut fries or a side salad which is exceptional. Pickled Daikon is quite simply amazing. So their food is most definitely on-point. Cast iron skillet chicken is great as well...Proper cocktails, great beer selection, decent wines by the glassStaff are knowledgeable and welcoming (especially the bartenders), but coming during peak hours (Friday or Sat night, brunch) is a bit of a crapshoot. Luckily I live walking distance and show up at random times for a great experience =]",5.0
"I love this place. Each time we have been to Lighthouse we've gotten both drinks and dinner, and not once have we been disappointed.  Every cocktail we've had (my husband and I always trade so we can try each other's) has been really, really delicious, and the food is always just as good.  Even on a slammed Saturday night we still got seats at the bar and were plenty entertained with drinks while we waited for a table.  Service has always been super friendly and efficient.  Great place for hanging out with friends, a date, or even just a cozy solo drink.",5.0
Food is always great. Service is always great. I've always had a good experience eating or drinking here.,5.0
"Great place. I have been coming there for the past five years, its always great, the food, the music the atmosphere. The owners Assaf and his sister Neama, knows how to make you feel comfortable, at home. They care about the food they serve, where it sourced from. And they always update the menu with seasonal food. You should also try their brunch its amazing!!Assaf is also an amazing bartender, they make great drinks there, you'll never be disappointed !!",5.0
Literally across the street from my friend's apartment. Nice spot for a glass of wine. Didn't order any food but it smelled good. French music was playing in the background.,4.0
"*This is a review based on food I tried from TASTE Williamsburg Greenpoint*Freekeh Bowl from LighthouseThis healthy and hearty plate of grains mixed in with colorful and fresh tomatoes, grilled corn, scallion, and cilantro with a side of creamy eggplant yogurt was so delicious that I kept coming back for more. The chef told me that this particular item is not on the restaurant's menu, but I strongly suggest that they make this their signature dish!",5.0
"Everything is solid about this place but the service, which was nuts the night we were there.  They appear to be doing some sort of free for all style of service, which resulted in a ton of confusion.  A while after we had ordered, around the time we were starting to wonder about apps, the server came over and said they were out of an entree we had ordered.  (Actually, they said they were out of chicken, because we ordered a chicken sandwich, and Melanie was pissed when the table next to us got roasted chicken like an hour later.  I knew what they meant, but she has a point.)I digress.  So we ordered something else, to replace the entree, and it came out immediately, well before our apps.  Then, our server came over and asked if we had decided what we wanted to replace the sandwich with.  I was like, ""yeah, we're eating the replacement right now"" and ""where is the rest of the food we ordered?"".  She went away, someone else came back and asked what else we ordered, a third person brought it to us shortly after--which was nice that they got it to us quickly.  Server B came by and asked us how it was, then seriously 30 seconds later, server A came by and asked the same thing.I won't even get started on my experience asking for a description of one beer.  Ok, I will: it was like asking what a pepsi tastes like and having the person very clearly describe a sprite.  How do you say, ""I know what you are telling me is incorrect"" when you are the one asking the question!Good place though.  I'll go back.  I'll manage my server more closely though.  And I'll be very sad if they take away the broccolini.",2.0
"Beautiful space, friendly service, no wait for brunch on Sunday at 12. Really wanted to like it! However, my shakshuka turned up lukewarm and very bland. It was essentially a can of crushed tomatoes and a couple of undercooked poached eggs topped with giant parsley sprigs. Trout looked more promising, as did the burger.",2.0

"I frequently stop in for a quick cocktail... or two, during the week. I am a big Old Fashion fan and every bartender I have had here makes it perfectly. Not just that but once I've had my fix, but want to stay in the whiskey/bourbon area, the bartenders make something of their own creation and I have yet to not enjoy one. The owner as well is extremely nice and really knows his business. The food I am not as well versed on but can comment on the oysters, salad, and roasted peppers app. Oysters are fresh and they have multiple regions to choose from and for a few bucks its a good deal to me to get a few. The salad we had was just a mixed greens but well made with a tasty dressing, two of us shared it. The peppers were good, not my favorite, but good and actually when paired with a bite of the salad they were amazing.",5.0

"Good cheeseburger! Best I've had in a while and good ambiance.  The worst service I've ever had... We didn't get seated even though it was late and there were 2 tables open and no one ahead of us, no water or napkins given to us until we asked, drinks were slow, and our food was sitting and waiting under the heaters for a long time, and we had to stand up and go up to our waitress to ask for the check as she was sitting and hanging out at the bar. The other people there were helpful, but our waitress was the pits.",2.0
"We came as part of the LOADed Cocktail passport. The bar is in the middle of the intersection which is pretty cool. It's very cosmopolitan and with dark wood and large windows! We went around midnight, and there wasn't much of a crowd. And as a result, our bartender was a little busy flirting with a customer - so service was slow. Unfortunately, the drinks were only average. We got Laird's Applejack and Perry's Tot Gin based cocktails. The drinks were okay, but not as good as Donna and Randolph Brooklyn. But good atmosphere and great reviews on the food - unfortunately the kitchen was closed so I can't really address that aspect!",3.0
"Tonight, First visit with mom and girlfriend. Warm welcome at the door by a staff member (maybe owner?). Then seated right away. Server friendly without overtly trying to friend us. Started with a nice selection of Lager Beers, followed by Masabacha and Shishito Peppers appetizers... Y-u-m-m-y! Simple yet so tasty. Good conversation was accompanied by delicious steak salad and not too loud music. Generous on the greens, nicely topped with a simple vinaigrette and the steak. Wish it had a bit more steak though.Food was so good we finished off with another appetizer! Fennel with manchego. Hmm. Hmmm. Off to sleep.",5.0
"This is corner resturant you should visit when in Brooklyn. The eclectic menu offers a variety of fresh oysters (a must try) small plates and dinners. Experienced the heirloom tomato salad that was earthy and delicious. Also had the baked chicken with Israeli couscous/potatoes with tomato (this dish takes sometime to cook but well worth it).

"The food here was amazing. There are flavor a that we could not put our finger on but had such depth. We had the ribs, shishito peppers, big salad, chickpea dish, and fries.

"Alright - this place is beautiful - we noted that immediately. The cocktail ""Dark & Stormy"" was perfectly gingered for a super cold, windy night. Now, we had a terrible experience with our waiter. My roommate and I wanted to go to a cool place just for a drink and maybe a side on a Friday night (Around 9:50). Our waiter at Lighthouse was first easygoing & friendly, then solicitous and then just openly passive aggressive! He disliked us immediately when he realized we were not going to order food - just drinks and a shared dessert. We just never had such an experience anywhere else with any wait staff person. He didn't bother concealing that he was pissed!

"I've spent two great nights here. One was with a good friend and her mom, the other with a good guy.

The second time, I sat at the bar. The bartender was amazing.

"I have only been here for the dinner and will come back to try brunch ( there is still some hope left there). The service and ambiance  were great-- they let our large party hang out well after we paid and kept refilling our waters (very European, not typical for NYC). The food was disappointing-- we ordered a bunch of the veggie plates and they were not seasoned well. The sauces were underwhelming, but the saving grace was the fennel for me. My friends ordered the chicken and they were very happy with it, so if you are a meat eater, check this place out. The drinks were solid and they had a lot of options.",3.0

Underwhelming and Overpriced.  Lighthouse is yet another example of a soulless Williamsburg bar/restaurant.  The menu is not cohesive and there was not one thing on it that I wanted.  I got a 14 dollar salad that was somehow overdressed but yet had no flavor.  The service (except for guy who brought my food) was not good.

"Came here Saturday night with some guy I met on OK Cupid. I was hesitant about the guy in the first place, then when he said let's go to Lighthouse I was like ok whatever. Never been.Be prepared to be hit over the head with a hipster 2X4 the minute you walk in.My date (who turned out to be a conservative) ordered a cocktail called the Good and Plenty. I was like Really? Dude, you think I'm gonna be impressed? I ordered a martini, asked for a double and they declined. What's worse - they served it with a twist not an olive. Pure muck and too much vermouth.I watched my date sip his insipid cocktail while telling me about the social app he's developing. ""Uh huh"".Then the food came. I showed up starving and completely empty. I ordered the pickles but the portions were so small I was afraid to eat them knowing they'd be gone in a flash. I think a piece of cauliflower disappeared on it's way from the plate to my beckoning mouth. (Why should pickles be such a hot item? My grandmother made them all the time. All you do is put vegetables in a jar, fill it with vinegar and bay leaves, then put it in a dark place and wait....).Chicken was so-so, soggy and I wanted crisp. Ordered oysters and they never came (that's one of my favorite things in life - oysters with a cold martini, such a sensual combination for a first date and always puts me in the mood to take the next step.... sorry future Mark Zuckerberg, you chose the place). The wait for my first martini was so long that I ordered another when the server arrived. He actually gave me a miffed look and I wanted to kick him in the ass. After my first bite of chicken, I decided in order for this to taste good I'd need to order the most expensive bottle of wine on the menu. A lovely italian red -  $150/bottle - no idea what it was called.I looked around, utterly yucked out, and told the guy I needed to use the restroom.

"Came here Saturday night with some guy I met on OK Cupid. I was hesitant about the guy in the first place, then when he said let's go to Lighthouse I was like ok whatever. Never been.Be prepared to be hit over the head with a hipster 2X4 the minute you walk in.My date (who turned out to be a conservative) ordered a cocktail called the Good and Plenty. I was like Really? Dude, you think I'm gonna be impressed? I ordered a martini, asked for a double and they declined. What's worse - they served it with a twist not an olive. Pure muck and too much vermouth.I watched my date sip his insipid cocktail while telling me about the social app he's developing. ""Uh huh"".Then the food came. I showed up starving and completely empty. I ordered the pickles but the portions were so small I was afraid to eat them knowing they'd be gone in a flash. I think a piece of cauliflower disappeared on it's way from the plate to my beckoning mouth. (Why should pickles be such a hot item? My grandmother made them all the time. All you do is put vegetables in a jar, fill it with vinegar and bay leaves, then put it in a dark place and wait....).Chicken was so-so, soggy and I wanted crisp. Ordered oysters and they never came (that's one of my favorite things in life - oysters with a cold martini, such a sensual combination for a first date and always puts me in the mood to take the next step.... sorry future Mark Zuckerberg, you chose the place). The wait for my first martini was so long that I ordered another when the server arrived. He actually gave me a miffed look and I wanted to kick him in the ass. After my first bite of chicken, I decided in order for this to taste good I'd need to order the most expensive bottle of wine on the menu. A lovely italian red -  $150/bottle - no idea what it was called.I looked around, utterly yucked out, and told the guy I needed to use the restroom.

Dark lighting and assorted dark, aged wood tables of all sizes complete a casual and warm atmosphere that give way to the real reason you've come.

"Came here for Sunday brunch. The service was laughably bad. For half the meal, I thought we were actually being pranked.Drinks took 20 minutes to arrive, and only after we again prompted the waiter. The food took much longer: 1 hour from order to arrival. The kitchen and serving staff were confused and unprofessional. There might've been some computer error with the order, but they never updated us and never apologized for the long wait. It was insulting. The table next to us arrived, ate, paid, and left before our chilequiles arrived. It's a shame, since they were delicious. If major service errors happen, you should apologize to the patrons. Most people will be understanding about it, as we would have been had we gotten some explanation along the way. However, we only received an apology after we complained to them at the end of the meal. Though I'll never return, I should say that the space itself is cool -- triangle-shaped and very bright.",1.0
"Great brunch spot in Williamsburg. I got a cappuchino and steak and eggs and both were delicious. I considered the chilaquiles but had my doubts since we were in NYC (what can I say, I'm a California boy where we have the best Mexican food in the country). My boyfriend ended up getting them and from the one bite I took/the one bite he would let me take, I thought they were fantastic! They looked like throw up half-way into the meal, but I was still impressed.The service can be pretty slow--we were a party of six and it took 30 minutes to get our food, 20 minutes to get our check after all of our plates were cleared from the table. But hey, if you're in good company like I was, it isn't that big of a deal.",4.0

"I have never been so delighted with a go-to neighborhood brunch spot. Why, you ask?*1) At noon, at 1, at 2:30, on a Saturday or a Sunday, doesn't matter - I've never had to wait for a table, even with a party of four.2) Everything is delicious. There is very little of that ""Oh, yours is much better than mine, I hope you go to the bathroom so I can steal more of your delicious food and stop staring sadly at this mediocrity in front of me."" The menu is neither overwhelming nor skimpy and it's all moderately priced.3) The booze. Case in point: my boof likes Manly Alcohol (see: whisky, scotch, bourbon) and coffee, and what does Lighthouse offer him? The Highlander, a coffee alkie milkshake topped with whipped cream. I bring everyone here - boof, roommate, parents, nana, boof's roommate, random people on the street.

"Solid brunch spot.My soy latte was delicious and barely needed sugar. Our group started out with a sampling of pickled veggies. I hate pickles. So i figured I wouldn't really like it. So wrong. Amazing... pickled cabbage, beets, carrots, peppers, cucumbers, mushrooms etc. All fantastic. And the toasted bread was ridiculous. We kept asking for more. For my entree, I has a green omelette (literally green!) with veggies and homefries. Whatever's in the homefries was sooo good. The seasoning they use is bomb. Great flavor. My only gripe is that they were out of/didn't have oysters!! Boo!! I also don't like sitting on benches with no backs. Not comfy. And they could use another server or two on the floor. But good food and coffee! Will have to come back for oysters and dinner.",4.0
"We had a really great meal here. We started with the pickle assortment, which was fun and exceeded expectations (although not all are true pickles). Despite the many healthy salad type options- I went for the cheeseburger, which was really delicious. My girlfriend got the big salad which was also excellent. Great ambiance and service, perfect for a casual drink or dinner. I'll be back!",5.0
"This is our local hang out and we love it. Brother/sister owners, who are always sweet and pleasant. This place has gone from strength-to-strength and is getting better-and-better as time goes by.

"Inviting and Homey. Lighthouse is a gastro bar with an interesting long triangle layout as it widens away from an intersection. Dark lighting and assorted dark, aged wood tables of all sizes complete a casual and warm atmosphere that give way to the real reason you've come. A solid (and concise) menu of new american cuisine shines, and the supporting cocktail list is nothing to sneeze at either. Add in the friendly service and the desire to linger here awhile, and you have a place worth repeat visits.",4.0
"Came here for Sunday brunch. The service was laughably bad. For half the meal, I thought we were actually being pranked.Drinks took 20 minutes to arrive, and only after we again prompted the waiter. The food took much longer: 1 hour from order to arrival. The kitchen and serving staff were confused and unprofessional. There might've been some computer error with the order, but they never updated us and never apologized for the long wait. It was insulting. The table next to us arrived, ate, paid, and left before our chilequiles arrived. It's a shame, since they were delicious. If major service errors happen, you should apologize to the patrons. Most people will be understanding about it, as we would have been had we gotten some explanation along the way. However, we only received an apology after we complained to them at the end of the meal. Though I'll never return, I should say that the space itself is cool -- triangle-shaped and very bright.",1.0
"Great brunch spot in Williamsburg. I got a cappuchino and steak and eggs and both were delicious. I considered the chilaquiles but had my doubts since we were in NYC (what can I say, I'm a California boy where we have the best Mexican food in the country). My boyfriend ended up getting them and from the one bite I took/the one bite he would let me take, I thought they were fantastic! They looked like throw up half-way into the meal, but I was still impressed.The service can be pretty slow--we were a party of six and it took 30 minutes to get our food, 20 minutes to get our check after all of our plates were cleared from the table. But hey, if you're in good company like I was, it isn't that big of a deal.",4.0
"Adorable, cute place in a great neighborhood. The chicken with the couscous is AMAAAZING. And the pecan pie is to die for. The broccolini rocks too. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone. The bar area is nice and the place is just overall cozy with great food.",5.0
"I have never been so delighted with a go-to neighborhood brunch spot. Why, you ask?*1) At noon, at 1, at 2:30, on a Saturday or a Sunday, doesn't matter - I've never had to wait for a table, even with a party of four.2) Everything is delicious. There is very little of that ""Oh, yours is much better than mine, I hope you go to the bathroom so I can steal more of your delicious food and stop staring sadly at this mediocrity in front of me."" The menu is neither overwhelming nor skimpy and it's all moderately priced.3) The booze. Case in point: my boof likes Manly Alcohol (see: whisky, scotch, bourbon) and coffee, and what does Lighthouse offer him? The Highlander, a coffee alkie milkshake topped with whipped cream. I bring everyone here - boof, roommate, parents, nana, boof's roommate, random people on the street.

"Following a similar playbook to St. Anselm - foods grilled simply and packed with massive flavor - Lighthouse is likely to go the route of that other Williamsburg destination soon enough.  Meaning, I can't believe I even got a table on a Friday night.The abbreviated menu has all you need for a great meal -  raw oysters, fresh, daring salads, several types of pickles, four delicious sides (the brussels sprouts, tinged with bleu cheese, and the cauliflower, were both excellent), and, of course, the meat.  There's a whole fish, lamb, a sirloin, and a pork.  The grass-fed sirloin was lean and flavorful; the lamb less lean but even more flavorful. For dessert, a chocolate torte, not oversweet, totally delicious.Overall I would rank everything but the meat dishes of Lighthouse above St. Anselm, which isn't to say the meat isn't quite good - it's just not quite on the level of St. Anselm.  However, it also seems a bit healthier.  There is a solid list of cocktails and a well-edited, and reasonably priced, wine list that focuses mostly on Europe, as it should to keep the value strong.I'm hoping that this being on the ""other"" side of the BQE means it can remain a local favorite for awhile, before Manhattan's hordes get to it!",5.0

"So this the low down of this place...The food is really good. I mean I am still thinking about their brussel sprouts right now, every minute. In saying that.. this place is expensive and not expensive in a weird way. Let me explain: All the sides are 5-6 bucks and the steak/chicken skewers are 5 bucks. The sides are large and shareable along with the skewers. So when I usually go there with friend/friends we order sides (big!!) with some skewers for each of us which comes with a yogurt sauce to die for. For some reason, the entrees jump to 28-30 dollars. Nothing in between.But in all honesty, the sides are amazing and so tasty. The wine is 8-11$ glass and the beer around 6$.The space is beautiful and I really like the music (they play mostly vinyl).So all in all, I will come back. I do not know if I will order their entrees any time soon but I def willl go for their generous portions of their gorgeous sides.",4.0

It was a 95-degree night and the place isn't air-conditioned, but the massive fans overhead and the shutters open to the sidewalk kept us cool. The music was interesting.The only downside was that we didn't realize quite how much we were eating. When we got up we were so full that we had to walk all the way across the Williamsburg bridge back to Greenwich Village... not too much fun on one of the hottest nights in history.So... order carefully because everything is so delicious that you'll probably finish it!",5.0

We have brought friends, parents, co-workers and neighbors to the Lighthouse and always had wonderful experiences. Both dinner and brunch are excellent. Lighthouse is one of the few places in neighborhood to have really great drinks  and amazing food. I can highly recommend the big salad and the chicken, the specials are always really good too. (Full disclosure) Over time we have become good friends with the owners (brother and sister, Asaf & Naama) and their staff. Nick the head chef is so talented, I could eat his food everyday of the week. The whole team is here is so welcoming and warm, Naama is literally one of the nicest people I have ever met and the most gracious host. My only hesitation is writing this review is that the Lighthouse will become too popular and we won't be able to get a table!",5.0
"So this the low down of this place...The food is really good. I mean I am still thinking about their brussel sprouts right now, every minute. In saying that.. this place is expensive and not expensive in a weird way. Let me explain: All the sides are 5-6 bucks and the steak/chicken skewers are 5 bucks. The sides are large and shareable along with the skewers. So when I usually go there with friend/friends we order sides (big!!) with some skewers for each of us which comes with a yogurt sauce to die for. For some reason, the entrees jump to 28-30 dollars. Nothing in between.But in all honesty, the sides are amazing and so tasty. The wine is 8-11$ glass and the beer around 6$.The space is beautiful and I really like the music (they play mostly vinyl).So all in all, I will come back. I do not know if I will order their entrees any time soon but I def willl go for their generous portions of their gorgeous sides.",4.0
"We had lamb, whole fish, interesting fresh cocktails, brussels sprouts, pickled rutabaga, and great service (informal and friendly, but very efficient; water glasses were refilled within moments of becoming empty). It was a 95-degree night and the place isn't air-conditioned, but the massive fans overhead and the shutters open to the sidewalk kept us cool. The music was interesting.The only downside was that we didn't realize quite how much we were eating. When we got up we were so full that we had to walk all the way across the Williamsburg bridge back to Greenwich Village... not too much fun on one of the hottest nights in history.So... order carefully because everything is so delicious that you'll probably finish it!",5.0
"I came here the other day after a Yelp search for ""oysters"" in my area...when Lighthouse came up, I jumped at the chance to visit because [full disclosure] I knew the owner/chef Nick and had been meaning to visit for ages. I can honestly say, I think this is the best restaurant experience I've had in years.I brought a couple friends + the boyfriend, and we started off with a bottle of wine and some oysters. I have minimal oyster knowledge, but my favorites are ""kumamotos"" and they made up half of our dozen - delicious! I especially loved their Abuela sauce, which is sortof a spicy version of cocktail sauce. I confess, I spooned up the rest of the sauce just to eat by itself once the oysters were gone. They also make a kind of Mexican bloody mary with the Abuela sauce, which my friend had and it was also delicious.Nick was kind enough to send us out some tuna tartare, which came in small tasty chunks with lovely texture, and full of black sesame seeds and other goodies. Yum!The bf and I split a Green salad, a flank steak skewer, and the mujadarra - absolutely amazing. Steak was perfectly done and had that lovely wood-fire taste to it, and came with a yogurt dip and some sort of cabbage salad. The mujadarra: I didn't know rice and lentils could be so delightful. I think it was the caramelized onions + yogurt that did the trick...The bf also had a Manhattan, which came well-boozed and with some sort of lovely, liquor-soaked preserved cherries - NOT those awful maraschinos. I don't love Manhattans, but I made him let me try it and I could tell it was probably delicious to him.My friend had the fish of the day, which I think was a Bronzini of some sort. It came whole on top of sauteed/roasted/somethingorother savory vegetables like onions and fennel. I was staring at it the whole time with jealousy, but I didn't end up getting a taste. Next time!The place was lovely, which I think added to our falling-in-love with it. The tables have benches (something I always love), and the space is wide open with huge floor-to-ceiling windows. I know the owners themselves were doing the renovations of the place for months, and worked really hard basically tearing the place apart and re-doing it -- it shows. I'd recommend it as a great easy-going date spot, super-great to take friends, absolutely delicious food, and don't miss the drinks -- bartenders got skillz!",5.0
"This is definitely one of those spaces you walk by constantly, reminding yourself you need to go check it out.Well, I'm telling you now. Go there.Group of four including myself, the annoying vegan, attended dinner on a Friday night. There were people but by no means was it noisy or crowded. I am quite partial to its location and that is one of the reasons; you couldn't get a quiet table for 4 at 9pm on a Friday on Bedford and N. Blahblahblah.We all ordered the brussels sprouts unintentionally- they just sounded that good. And they tasted DAMN good. The man enjoyed his meat-something, (I really can't remember what he got.. too busy drinking fruity delicious cocktails and raving about the veggies) and my friends liked their chicken. The portions aren't overwhelming, just enough to like what you're eating and be able to finish it. The drink selection is interesting, including a Sri Lankan beer and some girly concoctions that I was quite partial to, including one with peach and ginger. :D If you want nice ambience, great food, and pleasant service do yourself a favor and head east of the BQE.",5.0
"This place is impressive. Everything about it is charming; it's positioned on a fork in the road, it's cased by floor to ceiling windows that open up and create a bright and airy atmosphere, the bar and kitchen set-up feels very European and a bit cottagey while the distressed wood tables are so Brooklyn-esque... it's perfect. I've been to Lighthouse for brunch twice and tried the Shakshuka and the Quinoa Salad, both were terrific. They also have a fantastic drink menu, the Pimm s Cup is my favorite. I can't wait to go back and try more of their menu!",4.0
"OVERLY EXPENSIVE (more so than the Five Leaves) for such a basic menu with little flair.  I found the salad underwhelming and the broccoli rabe downright inedible. For a place that's more expensive than most in Williamsburg, the waitress didn't know much about the food on the menu - i.e. where the $3/a piece oysters were from or what their flavor qualities were.  The pro is that it was nearly empty on a Friday night at prime-time - 8pm.",2.0
Nice chill spot with a mixologist on deck that knows how to make some great tasting drinks. They have a food menu as well but we didn't have any on this day. You can bring your laptop and just chill while have a drink or some coffee. If you love in the area def check this place out.,5.0
A beautiful restaurant! Always fresh and the food is incredibly delicious. Green omelet and pickles are a must. Brother sister duo nailed this one-also ambience is perfect.,5.0
"This is definitely our new regular place. When my husband and I think about dinner this is the first place that comes to mind, no matter what is the size of our appetite or the type of your diet requirement. I came over with out-of-town vegetarian (fish eating) friends recently and we left bursting at the seams. With a selection of their exquisite pickles plate, the incredible daily ceviche and our most favorite fish plate, to some ""small dishes"" - brussels sprouts, roasted cauliflowers and the aioli roasted potatoes. We added the whole fish to that and their incredible signature ""big salad"" (which I always order) and that was a good enough tall order for 3 healthy eaters (and with no drinks it was less than $120).What we so love about the menu is the flexibility to build a meal for any budget, apetite, and diet. But even more and most important is the smiles and the company of the server and bartender sister - brother owners - duo that are most always present that makes the entire experience feel as if you are coming into their personal kitchen, they are so friendly and knowledgeable and makes eating there so much more pleasurable.",5.0
Extremely welcoming and warm environment that is complimented perfectly by the quality of the menu and cocktails.,5.0
"Naama and Assaf are an amazing brother sister duo that have created a warm, inviting environment with an incredible menu. From the homemade pickles (a family recipe) to the vegetable sides, and the the dessert, everything tastes fresh and balanced. None of the flavors seemed overpowering, even in the roasted sides; the spices were apparent but let the true flavor of the food stand out. As for the proprietors themselves, they could not be more kind. Assaf makes a mean manhattan, as well as many other well-crafted cocktails, and Naama truly wants to see you enjoy your food and is more than willing to make suggestions or answer any questions you might have.",5.0
"Lighthouse is a classy yet low-key affair with beautiful wooden communal tables and candlelight, allowing for an intimate dining experience with friends or loved ones.  Chef Nick Cox of La Esquina has just opened this new place, which oozes with his heart and soul; each small plate, each fish and meat is given his sweet lovin'.  I came with my boyfriend, his friend, and my cousin, all people I adore, and we were given a lot of attention, the service was thorough and impeccable!  The waitress was very knowledgeable and gave great suggestions for drinks, appetizers and the entrees.  We especially enjoyed the plate with pickled herring and smoked trout mousse, and anchovies that came with toasted pumpernickel bread, the fluke ceviche, the juicy ribeye with jalepenos (better than a Peter Luger steak or any steakhouse steak), and the loup de mer, which is fire grilled and flavored with garlic, olive oil, and salt and just falls off in huge fluffy chunks.  The fish was actually the best fish I've ever had, which is saying a lot, I know.    Lastly, we had the apple cinnamon cake and the chocolate cake that came with a hazelnut mousse, both were rich and dreamy with flavors.  Since they just opened, it was easy to get a table, but the word of mouth will get out soon.  The flavors, service, and dining experience at this restaurant is incredible.  Go before there's a line out the door!",5.0

"Am really excited to have a new place in the burg! I've been here for brunch and once for dinner and it is solid, with just a few missteps. The space is airy and filled with light in the day which is great. Staff seems friendly, there's a great DJ at brunch - general atmosphere is great. LOVE the big salad. Last night for dinner, had a great special ceviche and some nice oysters. Entrees left something to be desired. First of all, not many options here - would've liked to see some pasta, fish besides the special or maybe a burger or sandwich on the menu. Had the lamp chops which were cooked well but a little tough. Excellent ribs though! But generally felt the mains were too heavy for mid-May. Chops and potatoes? Sounds like winter fare to me! Also broccoli rabe was too smothered in sauce. Good flavors, but overwhelming.Also there was a weird double-waitress thing happening. Every time one would come over, like clockwork the other would come about 2 minutes later asking us the same question...I think this place will improve with time though.

"Sorry to be a buzzkill, but if I was a hungry ship in the night, I think I'd look for the next lighthouse.What's with the hype about the burger? I don't just not get it, I like really REALLY don't get it. It was like a fast food burger, super thin patty, grocery store sesame bun, shaved not melted manchego, tasteless cold crispy onions (i think?) piled on top. impossible to cook to any temperature but well done. If the server (who was extremely friendly) had just told me it was such a skinny patty and a med rare wasn't an option, I would've happily ordered something else. Instead I had to send back my first super dry burger cause it was just really dry and tough. The second was mildly less dry, and I was hungry, so I ate it. If it was an In-n-Out burger I'd be stoked, but it was a $10 burger that the server told me was, in his opinion, ""the best burger in Wiliamsburg."" He celebrated the beautiful grass fed, organic beef and said I had to order it when I was wavering between the burger and the skirt steak skewers.  Looking back at the burger I received, I have to laugh.  We also got a vegetable app that was a special, and the charred jalapenos, both of which were really tasty.  My friend loved her fish skewers. But the highlight of my meal was the burger, and I love burgers, so it's hard for me to look past it and give Lighthouse even three stars.  The wine was mediocre.  But the design, that was cool.Even if you find yourself dining at Lighthouse, save yourself a little slice of heartbreak and don't get the burger unless you're wasted.

After waiting 2 hours for a table when quoted 45 minutes, we waited an additional 15 minutes before our server showed his face. We waited an additional 45 minutes for our food. Our server never checked in with us to see how our food was or if we wanted additional drinks. We had to make extra side orders at the kitchen ourselves because no one was coming by to ask! Worst of all, after very politely complaining, the smarmy manager came to our table. He explained that although he is the restaurant's manager, his domain is really ""just the bar."" He proceeded to just stand there awkwardly for about 5 minutes making us very uncomfortable while asking us to just have drinks with us after. After we refused and said that after three hours we just wanted to get out of there- he finally walked away, but not before grazing my shoulders with his hand. Completely inappropriate. Definitely never coming back.",1.0
We just ate here on the opening week and we had such a wonderful experience. We stumbled upon it haphazardly and I have to see to we're glad we did. They emphasize local food with a focus on what's in season. The restaurant has a very open feel with communal tables and high ceilings.This is a wonderful alternative to some of the other foodie hotspots that fill up quick like Rye or Walter Foods.

"Came here last weekend and had a GREAT time.  Their food is truly exceptional and the sister brother run team, in conjunction with the picnic/communal tables and incredibly well made drinks made their place a really great find.  All the reviews on here are accurate to a tee.

"Lighthouse is the type of place that's charging gourmet prices but is not delivering a gourmet experience.  Some of our food was good, the rest was just decent.  The cocktails are an exception--they're quite above average--but, of course, you pay top dollar for them, and expensive good drinks are not rare or difficult to find in New York City.  The ambiance is really what I found detracting at Lighthouse.  Communal seating just should not come at so high a price tag.  They have plenty of space for personal tables, particularly if they make their ginormous bar smaller (I mean the space behind, not the space for patrons to sit).  This would only solve one aspect of the problem though.  Our service was pretty spotty and probably stems from the fact that the staff is entirely hipsters, who I can only surmise are fairly disinterested.  Neither this nor the layout are bad per se, but when you pay this much money you expect more.",2.0

"I've never written about any of my eating experiences until now. I'm not a food critic, nor am I a foodie, but I do know what tastes good and I do dabble in amateur cooking. One ingredient I recently discovered was Israeli Couscous and made numerous variations of it, including stuffing with figs and baking in Empire Apples. So when I read in L-Magazine that a new local restaurant opening in Brooklyn would be serving Israeli Couscous and lamb chops (another of my favorite meats) I couldn't wait. Unfortunately,  the experience was far from satisfying  and not only was it less than stellar but the most expensive eating experience I ever had that I'm compelled to write about. When we arrived the place was darkly lit and we were seated at a park table with benches. I had to use my Blackberry flashlight to read the menu, which was small offering  assorted raw oyster specials, fish, chicken and lamb. Since I was interest in the Couscous and lamb I thought I was going to try this combination but they didn't serve lamb with couscous and you cannot buy a side order of it. So I had to resort to the baked half chicken that came with couscous. Strike One. My girlfriend ordered the fish. We had a very long wait for the food and the din of the place with the park style bench and tables weren't meant for a romantic or discrete dining experience because we were joined by hipsters at our shared table.  Strike Two.  The half chicken and couscous was delivered in a cast-iron skillet together. I was excited but soon found the eating experience to be both disgusting and disappointing. The couscous was gloriously burnt and the chicken didn't have any noteworthy flavors.  I informed the waitress that the couscous was burnt and she stated that was how their customers liked it. I told her that the burnt couscous was very difficult to eat and I couldn't even chew it and she offered me a side order of couscous. I was relieved when she came back with a new plate of couscous and thought that this unbaked version was going to redeem the dining experience but to no avail. It didn't have any taste or flavors and was a pathetic rendition from even my amateur version.While I'm not discouraging anyone from going to this restaurant I hope this would prevent you from order the dish that was most disappointing to me. I would like to hear others customers responses. I hope the owners could take notice and address this problem.  This is also my fault for taking dining advice from L-Magazine, who seem to have a knack for hyping a place, only to be disappointed on numerous occasions and  now leading me to think that the restaurants are compensating them for making favorable recommendations.",1.0

"holy crap this place has good food.  i've been there 3 times now - the first i was tentative - had a couple oysters, a salad and a couple drinks - all good.  the second i was a bit more daring - had the broccolini - very unique and delicious but you have to be into peanut sauce to appreciate it so it might not fit everyone's tast - also had the gambas with garlic (can't remember the exact name - but it was shrimp in olive oil and lots of crispy garlic) - soooo good (but you must love garlic to truly enjoy it).  i tried my friend's steak which was perfect.  so on my third visit i went all out - got the half chicken with israeli couscous because it had looked so amazing on other people's plates - and it was delicious.  the couscous was crisped on top and bottom which i loved!  also had some oysters and the broccolini again along with a delicious cocktail.  they comped us 2 desserts - the chocolate cake with pistachio cream and pa pie (a great take on what seems similar to a pecan pie). even though i usually avoid dessert i couldn't stop taking bites of these two - they were amazing.  their food and drinks are inventive and very well executed and this is reflected in the price.  definitely not a cheap place, but on par with other restaurants of this quality.  and the service is great - super friendly - you will likely get to meet the owners who often serve you - and decor is simple, cute and comfortable. i will go and spend my money there again!",5.0
"Nice, clean, simple atmosphere, the waitress is nice and not overwhelming. Water served in old wine bottles is a cute touch. Food is simple, portions are small/medium. Coffee served in a French press. The southside drink is really good.",5.0
"Beautiful place with an amazing atmosphere.  Mushroom salad was delicious.  The owners ..Asaf, was gracious and adorable, as well as his sister who was very sweet.  How could you leave without giving her a hug goodbye?Happy ending with a yummy piece of pie and a Roberta Black Best Hits record playing.I will return... armed with friends.",5.0
"My husband and I were in town visiting from Portland, OR, and stumbled onto this place on our way to coffee on a Sunday afternoon. We loved it. We sat at the bar, and chatted with the owner/bartender who made one of the best Old Fashioneds my husband had ever had. The food is unpretentious, with the focus on great flavors and quality of ingredients. I could eat the Shashuka, two poached eggs on a tomato chile stew, every day.  For us, used to Portland prices, it was perhaps a bit on the high side, but far, far less than what we've paid for similar quality food and drinks in Manhattan.We only have a few days more in town but have already planned to go back for dinner.--------We made it back to Lighthouse for dinner not just once, but twice that week. So good!",5.0
"If i could eat here everyday I would. The food is always amazing, the wine I have ordered always good too, though it is a little spendy I find it a fair trade considering the hack jobs in the neigh. Get it. Also, the lady waitress is a mind blowing dollface, we love going there just to see her. Thanks",5.0
"Although the food was GREAT, the food was really overpriced and the service was slow. They only had one waitress at one point for the entire restaurant and it took her at least 10 minutes to get us a menu. The ambiance was nice but it's not something I'll pay for again.",3.0
"best food, best service. just go!!!the big salad is one of the best salads ive ever had and the brunch is my favorite in the hood.There is so much love put into everyhting they do- and it shows.",5.0
"Awful - Food portions were so small the main dish was like an appetizer.  I ordered the ""ribs"" and was literally brought 2 ribs.  The portion size was laughable and ridiculous.  Never going back ever.",1.0
