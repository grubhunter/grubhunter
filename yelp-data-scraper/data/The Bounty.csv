"Cool decor,  feels like your on a giant boat under a sail.  The bar looks like a frozen-in-time scene from the Titanic when the boat starts to go under and all of the cupboards and furniture hang on for dear life.  Had the burger with fries,  was super thick and cooked perfectly.  Poor selection of beers with only one ipa being offered and unfortunately  it's Goose island owned by Anheuser Busch (Budweiser). Ended up getting the bloody Mary,  a little too much tomato  juice without any other noticeable flavors other than pepper corns, not the best.    Very well trained and attentive server, plenty of great suggestions and was extremely friendly.  Would definitely  go back for the food,  not for a beer.",5.0
"The Bounty is cozy and atmospheric, like you stowed away in the  captain 's dining room of a schooner on a storm tossed sea. It seems humble but the cooking is inspired. Our party of four had quite a few items from it' s compact but diverse menu. Oysters  excellent Pierogis  nicely served with pickled mushrooms Roasted CARROTS, BEETS AND GREENS outstanding. The bounty specializes in fish. We had the lip smacking Mackerel. And the chicken rolada was a little gem. Panne cotta dessert delish. The prices are quite moderate per dish but everything is so good that you end up dropping quite a few bucks. The waitress Chevonne was excellent. Definitely a great subtle dining and nautical trip.",5.0
"3.8 on the food richter, but a 4 star still emerges. Came for a nice romantic dinner with my Valentine. The ambiance was nice with a spacious table arrangement given the room's size. The decor was fresh and charming and the kitchen can be seen through it's large service window.  They had numerous whole fish specials including trout, Bronzino, porgy etc plus a monkfish special; all a nice effort to bring some extra culinary muscle on the special day. We opted to kick things off with happy hour oysters and the truffle agnolotti, a more than well thought out dish executed with less than thoughtful seasoning. Super salty blanching water and final seasoning go a long way.The oysters were tasty - served with a house shallot malt vinegar that was reapplied again and again. Wish we ordered more. Pro tip: get in before 7pm to snag them at a $1 each. The Atlantic salmon was just average. It's slightly overcooked execution was the culprit along with the undercooked Brussels. Perhaps the cautious chef had a pesky customer earlier in the night who got rare salmon and farty Brussels, but for me, the salmon needs to be delivered with more attention to detail. The Fresno marmalade was actually the most interesting cog in the machine and was stolen to lend flavor to the roast chicken. Speaking of the devil, the bird was a yin yang dish for me. With its crispy skin and succulent flesh, it was mirrored by the bland spinach stuffing. It was not much of a stuffing at all but rather a bed of tight greens I found underneath the deboned dark meat section. Paired with a loose, slightly warm & under seasoned risotto, one would wish that they used salted butter and more Parm.All aside, it really was a good meal, and I can imagine what it would be like if all of the stars aligned for each dish. Valentine's is a mess in general for a kitchen. I know that they really had a well thought out vision but perhaps less time to devote to each table. It happens. Thank you for the Bounty!",4.0
"They have oyster happy hour every day, but from 5-7, no matter how many times you whine about it and ask them to give you oysters at 4. But that just means you can drink more and fill up on apps like bacon and fries (separate dishes).They attract a brunch crowd on weekends, and make a mean Bloody Mary. A bit steep for $8 (considering it's a small glass), but yummy. Just the right amount of kick.Also had one of their signature vodka cocktails, which was pretty good, but not great. When we first sat down, the owner told us he couldn't mix drinks, so we had to wait until the bartender showed up. Luckily, they also have a handful of beers on tap.Finally got to 5pm and we had two dozen at $1 apiece. They rotate daily offerings, and we had Moonshoals from MA and East Beach Blondes from RI. Both were good, but I preferred the EBB's for their smoothness.All in all, had a good time at the bar. It was in between lunch and dinner so the bartender was able to entertain us with tales about her childhood. Hope to come back to try the food!",5.0
"The Bounty is a lovely place for dinner in Greenpoint, especially with the killer oyster special. EVERYDAY from 5-7pm they have $1 oysters. Sweet! Cocktails and drinks are a little pricey ($6 for just a Narragansett, oof), but the service is friendly and attentive, and unlike most NYC restaurants, the space does not feel cramped. (Bonus points for that compelling Rothko-style painting on the right wall.) Needless to say, the oysters were tasty and cheap, the mains were hearty and filling. I ordered their burger, which featured a home-baked bun and a tomato jam along with cheddar, mayo, onion, and a perfectly cooked medium-done patty. The burger was delicious, but I'm not sure if I'm ready to say if it's the best in BK per se. The fries were also oddly limp, albeit well-seasoned. (I'm crispy fry guy myself.)The roast chicken, however, was across the board excellent. The skin/crust was perfectly crispy, and the risotto with accents of spinach and mushroom made for a perfect complement. Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed my meal at the Bounty and look forward to my return. Great for drinks, dates, or just a place to stay away from the cold.",4.0
"I really enjoyed my meal at The Bounty--from the service to the food and drinks, everything was spot on and wonderful. Came in with a friend on a Wednesday evening during the winter--no reservations were needed and my friend was sat before I arrived (always a plus in my book). You should be able to tell from the name and decor that this is a seafood joint. The menu, while small, had some great items. We both got the clam strips and the salmon burger, and some cocktails. The clam stripes were crisp and I liked the dipping sauces--a good dish to split. The salmon burger was one of the best I've ever had--very fresh and the bread was made in-house. The cocktails were also good and I could see coming here solely for oysters and a drink earlier on.",5.0
"Stopped in for a few drinks. That is all that I can speak to, not the food, but the drinks were great. Modest, yet wonderful beer selection and their mixed cocktails do no disappoint being spirit forward in a good way! Both of the guys behind the bar were great, interactive, attentive and very informative of the establishment and surrounding area. Would love to make this a go to bar joint for a great drink at the end of the day.",4.0
"Glad I finally checked out the Bounty for Friday night date night. It has a comfortable yet interesting vibe with some unique decor (check out the vintage desk built into the ceiling above the bar). Good ambiance for a date or getting a group together as they take reservations, and super easy location right off Greenpoint Ave G. Service was on par. Our waitress told us everything is made to order hence the wait on the food, but it did take quite a while longer than I would have expected. I appreciate that everything is so fresh and that probably explains the prices, but they could consider a bread bowl to make the time go by, especially considering they bake their own bread. The pan seared chicken I ordered was delicious and served very uniquely. The sunchokes were a welcome addition and the sauce was heavenly. I felt the chicken was slightly dry on the inside so if they hadn't skimped on sauce it would have made a big difference. The portion was also quite large but at $22 I would hope they would give a decent size. My husband ordered the lobster pappardelle which I believe was a special. The pasta is incredibly delicious and we could easily tell it was homemade. The portion however was teeny tiny and I felt bad for my beau who finished off his meal while I still had half leftover. He said there was a decent amount of lobster in there though. I will be back because I adore these cute places in the hood and I certainly had a pleasant experience, but with the prices I might save it for a celebration.",3.0
"Went here for a quick dinner with the boy after picking up half-marathon race packets at the Brooklyn Convention Center, and overall the experience was good.  The service wasn't the friendliest -- when we sat at the bar and ordered a main and a side to share, san drinks due to aforementioned half-marathon, we got quite the eye-roll from the bartender.  Relax bro, I'm still going to tip!I had the butternut squash with maple butter and it was ohhhh man heavenly and autumnal as all get out.  It was perfectly cooked with a crisp outside and creamy inside.  The portion looked small for $6, but it was actually quite a bit of squash.The boy had fish and chips, which were satisfying but nothing to write home about.  The fish was super fresh and again, well cooked, but the seasoning was a bit bland and lacking any interesting flavors.  The interior was super cute with lovely lighting; would be a good place for a first date.  The drinks looked fantastic, also, so hopefully we'll make it back on a more drink-y oriented night to try 'em out!",4.0
"Went here for brunch on Easter with my boyfriend and mom who was in town. Super cute place and will definitely be back to try dinner. The steak and eggs were good but nothing special. They also didn't have milk or Kahlua to do a White Russian, which to me for brunch on Easter Sunday seems a little silly. Overall the food was good, not great but I would love to try some other items on the menu. The service was great as well.",3.0

$1 oysters during happy hour? You know I'm there!Have been to The Bounty a few times for after work drinks and dinner and have ordered probably over 100 oysters across those visits. They're consistently great.They've also got this awesome whole-fish dish on the menu that Rus and I usually share. It comes with roasted veggies (but beware of the dripping fish oil -- they serve this on a wooden plank) and is more than enough food for two people. They make a pretty good whiskey sour but I'm all about the rosé.Service is good and they have outdoor seating. Factor in the $1 oysters and that makes The Bounty your new summer haunt. You're welcome. ;),5.0

"I fear I miss out because I am not an oyster fan, but I do appreciate seafood so I came here with my parents. I had a few cocktails at the bar that were good - not great - and kind of pricey. We sat for dinner and split the smoked fish balls and the croquettes. The former were rather good but the croquettes were extremely tough and seemingly overcooked. They had pork belly on top that was so overcooked it was not possible to really eat.For mains I had the fish and chips. It was okay. The fish was two rather large pieces of whitefish and not smaller chunks like you would usually get it. As with the appetizers it was somewhat overdone. The tartar sauce was watery and not very flavorful. My father had the burger which he was was fine and my mother had the lobster roe pasta that was alright but really somewhat bland, especially for the price tag. The desert was really the best part of the night. The goat cheese cheesecake with kumquats was outstanding. The space itself is charming with a very unique barback. The service was good, but I had this feeling like I was being judged the whole time and the waitress was a little snooty. Overall it wasn't a horrible experience and some of the food was decent, but for $250 you can do better almost anywhere else.",2.0

They passed with flying colors.The gravy--And I wish could've had their's over their biscuits (I'm gluten free)--was the decor; ship wreck nautical theme with wooden barrel tables, sea glass, and antique cabinets behind the bar referencing the captain's quarters.Loved it--have no complaints and only high praise: will be back for more.",5.0

"BRAVO! I found The Bounty on yelp, ironically enough, and decided to give it a try with a few friends. I haven't written a review on yelp in a while, yet I am compelled to do so after my wonderful experience last night. It was a relatively slow night (understandably so at 8:30-9pm on a weeknight), which made the ambience nice and quiet, comfortable, and relaxed. I was immediately impressed by their indoor layout - beautiful, simple, and not over-the-top. Very Brooklyn, if you know what I mean. I was kindly greeted by our server, who was very knowledgable of the menu and made excellent recommendations. I decided I was in the mood to try one of their seasonal gin cocktails, despite their selection of classic cocktails that were equally as compelling. The cocktail was good; however, its tartness made me switch to a simple gin martini afterwards. My friend truly enjoyed her two cocktails, particularly the corpse reviver. She eventually switched to a glass of the vermentino recommended by our server, and that was truly excellent. Their draft beer selection was minimal, but my boyfriend who is extremely selective with his brew was impressed. We ordered a series of starters and took our time. Their oysters were fresh (we will definitely be going back for the $1 oysters during happy hour), the fish balls were my favorite, and the New England clam chowder was hearty and perfect for the cold weather. The ricotta cheese spread was also a delight. As an entree, my boyfriend ordered the burger, which was outstanding! This is a MUST-TRY. My friend and I shared the fish of the day, which was the dorade, and it was one of the best meals I've had in a while. It came with three fantastic side dishes - brussel sprouts, parsnip (possibly my new favorite vegetable!), and some greens. The most notable moment was when the owner, Lance, personally came over and showed us how to filet our fish when we were awkwardly staring at it, not knowing where to begin. Now that is great service!Overall, the service was even better than the food. I would go back just to be served again by our genuine server, Jeannette. She was fantastic - caring, helpful, patient, and friendly. She promoted their brunch so well that I am already looking forward to it this weekend. We ended up having such a great time that we closed the place. The bartender Brian was super nice and patient with us and let us stay until the very end without any pressure to leave.Highly recommended!",5.0

"BRAVO! I found The Bounty on yelp, ironically enough, and decided to give it a try with a few friends. I haven't written a review on yelp in a while, yet I am compelled to do so after my wonderful experience last night. It was a relatively slow night (understandably so at 8:30-9pm on a weeknight), which made the ambience nice and quiet, comfortable, and relaxed. I was immediately impressed by their indoor layout - beautiful, simple, and not over-the-top. Very Brooklyn, if you know what I mean.

"2.5 Stars.I'll start off by saying that the food here was pretty good. I got the burger, which was decent and my family and I also got to try the squid ink spaghetti, roasted chicken, kale salad, and cauliflower steak, which were all executed pretty well. They also brought out a butternut squash crostini, compliments of the chef, which had a sweet and savory, crunchy taste.That being said, the restaurant in itself lacked some pretty basic amenities. The windows, while closed, did not have proper insulation and a pretty cold breeze kept being drawn in, which was pretty uncomfortable since our table was right by the windows. Also, while the decor was pretty nice and rustic in the restaurant, the bathrooms were only lit with dim candles. There's a bit of charm that comes with dimly lit candles, but in the case of bathrooms, I think I prefer light bulbs. You know, since electricity exists this generation.Additionally, the waitstaff sort of just drifts around the restaurant. They were pretty attentive with refilling water, but failed to check up on us otherwise. As a result, we ended up waiting about 45 minutes for our food after placing our orders. We informed the waiter of this, and he gave a pretty superficial apology and went to ""check on it"" and we ended up waiting about 10 more minutes for our food. We're generally patient people, but I think it's unacceptable to wait nearly an hour for your food. It's understandable when mistakes happen, but the half-baked attitude doesn't help when working in a restaurant. Overall, food is pretty good, but I can't really  think of a reason to come back here, as there are dozens of other restaurants in Greenpoint that not only have good food, but good service, basic lighting, and climate control too.",2.0

"Based on the reviews here and elsewhere, I was expecting to be blown away when my boyfriend and I came here for dinner recently. Sadly, that was not the case.While the space is very charming and the music (great oldies) was lovely, the food left something to be desired. Things started off well with the delicious beet salad that I had for an appetizer, but my entree--fettuccine with clams--was pretty disappointing. The clams tasted alright but were very tough. I realize the menu specified that the dish had a white wine butter sauce, but I honestly felt like I ate two sticks of butter and I barely ate half of the dish. Also, it seemed to me that there was an awful lot of lemon juice or something of that nature in there. A little goes a long way with that. Overall, I felt like the entree was lacking. I probably should have ordered a fish or meat dish since that seems to be the thrust here, but when you only have six entrees on the menu, I feel like all of them should be pretty stellar.My boyfriend had the burger, which he thought was quite good. The fries were good also (I sampled some).I had the petit chocolate pot de creme (like a thick chocolate mousse) for dessert, which was great. My boyfriend had the other option, a sour cherry cake. I tried the cake and thought it was oddly bland.Because my appetizer and dessert were both good, I would come back here and try something else for an entree, but I would not get pasta here again.",3.0
"Came here because we had a Brokelyn Beer Book coupon for a free beer. When we got here it was WAY fancier than most of the other beer book locations. More of a dinner spot. We checked the beer selection out and were terribly disappointed. 4 beers on tap, three bottled beers, and none were very exciting, at least for Beer Book aficionados. All the servers seemed not to know what to make of us or our beer book coupons.Luckily two of the three of us were quite hungry and I had a hankering for a piece of chocolate cake, which they had on the menu! We ordered the sautéed kale, which was spectacular, the review on the burger was that it was good and cooked to order. The chocolate cake was dense and rich and exactly what I wanted. The back patio is light and lovely (despite the mosquitos that plagued us).So, all in all, it worked out. We're still just very confused why this place chose to advertise in the Brokelyn beer book when they are kind of spendy and don't have much beer. But if you come here for dinner, you will be pleased.",3.0

Arugula and rice that come with it could be a dinner alone.The chicken is cooked right, moist and crisp.Chocolate cake - just perfect. Chocolatey, not too sweet, served with raspberries.Good service.Def coming back",5.0
"I went there for brunch for a friend's birthday yesterday. It is a very charming little place, with good service, and the food is exceptional. I had the friend egg on rice and beans. I generally consider rice to be a filler ingredient, but The Bounty takes rice to a completely different place. The rice has kimchee cooked into it! It tastes like salsa on crack.",5.0
"Amazing good, great ambience, excellent service. We went there as a group of 6 and my 1 month baby so we had a stroller. We called ahead to make sure it was ok to bring the stroller and the staff was so accommodating and nice. Everything on the menu was delicious and I had the whiskey sour which was just perfect! This will be my go to spot. Really a great overall dining experience. Love it! Also the best chicken I ever had.",5.0
"Based on the reviews here and elsewhere, I was expecting to be blown away when my boyfriend and I came here for dinner recently. Sadly, that was not the case.While the space is very charming and the music (great oldies) was lovely, the food left something to be desired. Things started off well with the delicious beet salad that I had for an appetizer, but my entree--fettuccine with clams--was pretty disappointing. The clams tasted alright but were very tough. I realize the menu specified that the dish had a white wine butter sauce, but I honestly felt like I ate two sticks of butter and I barely ate half of the dish. Also, it seemed to me that there was an awful lot of lemon juice or something of that nature in there. A little goes a long way with that. Overall, I felt like the entree was lacking. I probably should have ordered a fish or meat dish since that seems to be the thrust here, but when you only have six entrees on the menu, I feel like all of them should be pretty stellar.My boyfriend had the burger, which he thought was quite good. The fries were good also (I sampled some).I had the petit chocolate pot de creme (like a thick chocolate mousse) for dessert, which was great. My boyfriend had the other option, a sour cherry cake. I tried the cake and thought it was oddly bland.Because my appetizer and dessert were both good, I would come back here and try something else for an entree, but I would not get pasta here again.",3.0
"Came here because we had a Brokelyn Beer Book coupon for a free beer. When we got here it was WAY fancier than most of the other beer book locations. More of a dinner spot. We checked the beer selection out and were terribly disappointed. 4 beers on tap, three bottled beers, and none were very exciting, at least for Beer Book aficionados. All the servers seemed not to know what to make of us or our beer book coupons.Luckily two of the three of us were quite hungry and I had a hankering for a piece of chocolate cake, which they had on the menu! We ordered the sautéed kale, which was spectacular, the review on the burger was that it was good and cooked to order. The chocolate cake was dense and rich and exactly what I wanted. The back patio is light and lovely (despite the mosquitos that plagued us).So, all in all, it worked out. We're still just very confused why this place chose to advertise in the Brokelyn beer book when they are kind of spendy and don't have much beer. But if you come here for dinner, you will be pleased.",3.0
"This place is amazing! AWESOME- wine, food & service! I come here all the time and its always spot on! Best burger in Greenpoint IMO... Thanks The Bounty!!",5.0
"Everyone keeps talking about this place and for good reason. My husband and I ventured here on Friday night, figuring it would be less busy since it was the holiday weekend.  We showed at 8pm and discovered a rather busy restaurant.  There were a few 4 top and one 2 top tables available, but the host explained that the 2 top was reserved for 8pm.  If the reservation didn't show in 15 minutes we would get the table.  So we sat at the bar and ordered drinks.The decor is lovely and unique.  The Bounty utilized vintage furniture for the bar that literally crawls up the ceiling.  It reminds me of Alice falling down the rabbit hole, it's so unique and draws your attention to the ceiling which has a giant sail.  There is plenty of seating, so definitely book a reservation if possible.The drink menu was very good with lots of cocktail options, decent beer offerings and plenty of wine to choose from.  There is literally something for everyone.  I enjoyed the Bee's Knees and the Grapefruit Gimlet, both were strong and delicious.  The bartender was super friendly and perfectly attentive.We were finally seats at the empty table at 8:20pm.  I would have preferred being seated earlier, but I guess it's nice they wait so long for the reservation to show up.  Most places would have given the table away much sooner, especially since people were starting to crowd the bar. The menu isn't extensive, but what they do have is inventive and fresh.  Most people were opting for the grilled fish special, which was a beautiful dorado, which smelled amazing.  We started with the corn soup, which was out of this world.  I can't eat cream-based soups, but did take a taste.  It was out of this world delicious.  It wasn't very hot, but it was definitely warm enough to enjoy.  It had a hint of curry, so if this is something you might like definitely try it.  My husband practically liked the bowl clean, it was that amazing.  I could see this being a light dinner with some hearty bread. I ordered the linguini with clams, which was so good. The clams are de-shelled, which made this dish easier to eat and helped incorporate the flavor of the clams throughout the sauce.  The lemon butter was succulent and the pasta perfectly cooked.  This dish literally melts in your mouth.  It was a nice portion too, not too large that you need to take home left overs, but enough to eat your fill and share a few bites.  My husband had the black bass entree, which was equally delicious.  A nice sized perfectly sautéed filet with that incredible crispy skin that makes every bite mouthwatering on top of summer veggies like peas and corn.  The sauce was reminiscent of the corn soup, so fresh and sweet.  He savored every bite.  Overall, the food was fabulous and worth coming back again and again.  I enjoyed the atmosphere and thought the staff was extremely helpful and attentive.  Food came out in a timely fashion.  It seems every dish is cooked to order, so if you have to wait 20/30 minutes for your food, it's probably because they're filleting a fresh fish just for you (I saw them doing just that on my way to the restroom).  I would love to see this place over for brunch and offering happy hour specials.  It's affordable for a nice dinner and I'm glad to see they're doing really well based on the turn out on a Friday night.  Word to the wise, dinner slowed down at about 8:45pm, so head there after the rush to be seated right away.",4.0
"I would give this place a 4.5 stars if I could! The food is soooo good and the ambiance is really nice and cozy. My fav main is the chicken - it is truly awesome and is so different than the way most other restaurants prepare a roasted chicken. They take the white and dark meat and mince it all tog, roll it in to a cylinder and wrap the chicken skin around, roast and slice it into perfection. The brussels sprouts are also top notch. Overall one of my favorite neighborhood spots!",4.0
"Can't get enough of this place - A corpse reviver #2 and tuna tartare are fantastic.  Also, try the ricotta it's amazing.  They bake their own bread here as well and it shows.  Bartenders are great, owner is awesome guy and have chatted w/him on several occasions as he'll often be working behind the bar or will hang out after a shift in the kitchen.  Atmosphere is casual, can come in dressed up or shorts and t-shirt, doesn't matter.  I've never had bad food or a bad experience here, and I love eating at the bar every time!",5.0

"We had read about this resto over a year ago and kept it in mind for when we were in Brooklyn next looking for a good dinner spot. It lived up to our long standing expectations. The decor of the bar is very cool with furniture mounted up on the wall to the ceiling which doubles as the bar.  Hard to describe so you should check it out yourself.The menu had a variety to choose from, veterinarian, fish, meat, seasonal or timeless.  I ended up ordering two specials that were both spectacular (heirloom tomato, watermelon and ricotta salad and a duck breast entree) and Ryan also enjoyed his meal (an incredible gazpacho ((vegan)) and had a clam fettuccine for his main) There was a great red wine on the menu -cotes du rhone and Ryan got an IPA from the Peekskill brewery.Also a yummy dessert - (GF)The waitresses were all very personable and helpful.  There is an outdoor garden area but we ate inside since it was hot on Sunday :)Anywhoo - Try it and lemme know what you think -- We really dug it.",5.0

Was going to go to CoCo but it was closed so after passing by Bounty on the street it looked interesting so decided to try it.  What a pleasant surprise.  The staff couldn't have been more accomodating for our group of 5 as a walk in.  Service was fast and friendly .  The menu is well crafted and the food was wonderful.  It is fresh locally sourced fare and cooked to perfection.  The prices are reasonable and the atmosphere is hip and modern.  If you're in Greenpoint make this a destination.,4.0
"This please is downright delicious.  We had an appetizer with soft ricotta cheese served with grilled bread, which was amazing, followed by the best burger I ever had (couldn't figure out why it was so good but it was).  My husband had a pasta dish that he devoured and wonderful oysters.  It would be an equally good place to take our 6-year old on a weeknight or for a weekend date.  Great place, wish it was in my own neighborhood.",5.0

But mostly I was impressed because there were a few minutes between the time they delivered my husband's meal and mine, and rather than simply apologize, they offered us a round of drinks and a dessert to make it up to us.

"Wow! This was one of the best meals ever.We came here for dinner and had oysters to start. They were perfectly shucked with not even a tiny chip of shell in any of them, and were super fresh.We then had the white gazpacho, the garden salad, and the smoked trout spread. The soup was a perfect way to start, cool and refreshing garnished with fine brunoise cucumber and crushed almonds; the salad was one of, if not the, best salad we had ever eaten: baby kale in fennel seed vinaigrette, just cooked radish and carrot peeking out of a crunchy nut 'soil', a veritable symphony of flavors and textures; and I would include the smoked trout spread in my last meal on this earth. It was absolutely perfect! not too smokey, a little lemony, unctuous with olive oil, and lively with chives.We then had the flank steak. Oh, my, goodness! Firstly, it was expertly cooked. The meat itself was dry-aged to buttery perfection, the broccolini was beautifully charred yet still had a nice bite, the sauce was superb, and the onions and the celery root puree added a lovely smoky sweetness. The pinot noir we drank was juicy and acidic, and perfectly complimented the spice in the peppercorn steak sauce.For dessert, we had the chocolate mousse and the panna cotta. The mouse was deeply chocolatey and not too sweet with puddles of slightly salty hazelnut butter, crushed hazelnuts, and pieces of fine dark chocolate. The panna cotta had fresh blueberries, crunchy granola, dots of honey, and impossibly thin honey toffee 'chips'. Both were clearly the work of a very skilled pastry chef, and an excellent note on which to end the meal.All of the food was presented beautifully and cooked with care and attention.Service was equally attentive, not overbearing and suited the nice neighborhood vibe.We cannot wait to come back and try the brunch menu!",5.0

Loved the tomato jam.Our group also loved the vibe. Rustic yet modern, nautical touches, and an amazing bar that you kind of just have to see for yourself. The Bounty is understated cool. It was the perfect place to celebrate a birthday--sophisticated but not fussy. Definitely will be back next time I'm in the area!",5.0
"I know this place just opened, but the menu was pretty bland and pedestrian for the prices and the portions.   Yet another eatery done up in the quintessential Williamsburg salvag-chic style...  We ordered the mussels for an appetizer for eight dollars and got eight mussels lined up with no bread.  They were good enough, but can't compare to the 5 Leaves.   Muscles are notoriously inexpensive. So eight mussels for eight dollars better be high concept.    We had noodles with clams for dinner, one of four entrée options. Again, it was nothing to write home about and overpriced.    I won't say this place is bad. It's fun it's a good atmosphere, but there are so so so so so many better places to eat in a half-mile radius....",2.0

"I've been a longtime yelp user but only a place like The Bounty could actually compel me to leave my first review... it was AMAZING.  My friend and I stumbled upon it one night after being turned away by a 1 hour 45 minute estimated wait time at Paulie Gee's.  We walked down Greenpoint Avenue, peering into the various storefronts until we were drawn into The Bounty by an inviting menu and a super cute ambiance.  Once seated, we asked a question about one of the menu items and the waiter (owner?) explained that all the bread in the restaurant is made in-house by an Asian guy who was standing behind the bar, who also happened to be a craft bartender as well.  With that kind of a skill set, we thought, how could we go wrong?  We both ordered the catfish sandwich and a pair of seasonal drinks and were floored by how delicious our meal was.  The catfish was perfectly breaded, and the bread was soft, buttery and kind of melted in your mouth.  The drinks were really unique and incredibly smooth.  We shared a plate of oysters as well, and in truth, they were okay but not great so we'll probably skip them next time.  Needless to say, we are both dying to go back as soon as possible.  This place is an absolute gem in Greenpoint!",5.0
"this place is fine, i live in the neighborhood and want to like it.  some suggestions:  your eggs benedict, the hollandaise needs to be more tart, its basically just egg and butter sauce on eggs.  I like the idea of pork belly underneath but its lacking a brightness of flavor that you get from traditional cured meat underneath an eggs benedict.  this all makes the dish a little flat... otherwise pleasant place, will try more.",3.0
"The Bounty is a welcome addition to Greenpoint, one among many new spots that is raising the bar in the area with excellent food, drink, and ambiance.The menu is a bit small, but provides a variety of tantalizing options, both from the bar and the kitchen alike. The cocktail list is a mix of old and new classics, myself having had an above average old fashioned. And to start we had a great mixed cheese plate that, for once, wasn't so expensive that I had to give my arm, leg, or rights to my first born child.For entrees we ordered the Cobia filet, and the burger, in spite of the fact that most of the menu was seafood (as it is a nautically themed joint). Both were excellent. The Cobia was served with a warm melange of green and white beans, with a lemon puree. The burger, probably the best that I've had in Greenpoint, was perfectly cooked and served on their house baked brioche. The decor and ambiance was classy but relaxed and not douchey. The music was a mix of chill crooners (Nat King Cole makes everything better). The staff were attentive, informative and friendly.Do yourself a favor, and try The Bounty, ASAP!",5.0

"We came to the Bounty with a group to celebrate a birthday. The staff were friendly & attentive from the moment we stepped in the door to the minute we left. We enjoyed the expertly crafted cocktails and thoughtful wine list. Our food came out quickly and was made to absolute perfection. I had the burger medium rare--it was delicious. Loved the tomato jam.Our group also loved the vibe. Rustic yet modern, nautical touches, and an amazing bar that you kind of just have to see for yourself. The Bounty is understated cool. It was the perfect place to celebrate a birthday--sophisticated but not fussy. Definitely will be back next time I'm in the area!",5.0
"I know this place just opened, but the menu was pretty bland and pedestrian for the prices and the portions.   Yet another eatery done up in the quintessential Williamsburg salvag-chic style...  We ordered the mussels for an appetizer for eight dollars and got eight mussels lined up with no bread.  They were good enough, but can't compare to the 5 Leaves.   Muscles are notoriously inexpensive. So eight mussels for eight dollars better be high concept.    We had noodles with clams for dinner, one of four entrée options. Again, it was nothing to write home about and overpriced.    I won't say this place is bad. It's fun it's a good atmosphere, but there are so so so so so many better places to eat in a half-mile radius....",2.0

"A restaurant that is willing to host a party of 6 on a Saturday is as rare as the illusive in-unit washer and dryer combo in this city. Thankfully, The Bounty, and more specifically the fantastic staff, was more than willing to host my party and was overly accommodating. Lance was quick to respond and extremely kind; he even remembered my name when I returned for dinner on a different evening (or maybe we were just so obnoxious he just couldn't forget us....hopefully not the latter). Our waitress, Amy, was equally as knowledgable and patient and couldn't have been sweeter. Now for the important food-review stuff: It's all amazing. Everything I've tried, from the grilled watermelon salad, to the oysters, to the cocktails (one of the partners hails from The Drink ), and all of the main dishes I have tried are executed perfectly. Upon ordering the whole-roasted fish, we were shown how to properly de-bone it without looking like a bunch of inexperienced idiots poking around at our dish. A friend who works at Gramercy Tavern said the burger was so good that it was up there (if not exceeding) the quality of the Gramercy Burger (!!!) and the hand-cut fries were perfectly crispy and just salty enough. I recently tried a beet salad, which was honestly one of the best I've ever had (ricotta salata people!). The seared duck breast with cherry sauce, kale, and roasted fingerling potatoes was well crafted and combined the best earthy flavors of fall without overpowering the richness of the duck-breast. Overall, you really can't go wrong here. Take extra note of the cleverly-constructed ""shipwreck"" bar and the sail lining the ceiling. Though the space is the standard size of most Brooklyn restaurants, I love that they have left ample room so that you're not brushing elbows with your neighbors.

She said ""Well we have QUITE a few reservations but we'll SEE what we can do."" Um don't do us no favors, young lady! This isn't The French Laundry. It's January and it was pouring rain, and we were soaked even with our umbrellas after a cool Patrick Wilson sighting at Brooklyn Industries down the block. Hostess came back and pointed to the two tables directly in front of the door. It's January. It's cold. We're wet. Just a classic obnoxious restaurant thing to do to offer us the two worst tables in the restaurant. We offered to sit at the bar but the bartender seemed overwhelmed, spritzing seltzer into several drinks in increments over a few minutes. We peaced out and walked over to Mrs. Kim's who knocked it out of the park with sick fried chicken and these rice cakes that were a delight. Go to Mrs. Kim's everyone! Next to Vamos on Franklin. Very chill environment over there and excellent Korean fusion.",1.0
"the husband and i decided to have a friday date night at the bounty. and we're so glad we chose this place.the ambiance - we loved the steady and relaxed vibe. the bar looked awesome and it wasn't too packed which was perfect.the service - friendly people. excellent service.the food - we got the oysters to start which were fresh and yummy. we both ordered the burger which was actually one of the best i've had in nyc. such a great surprise. so juicy and tasty. it went perfectly with the toasted brioche it was in. even the fries that went with the burger were excellent, crisp and well seasoned. we will definitely go back even just for that burger. oh and the dark and stormy was excellent too!",4.0
"This place is pretty amazing. Very small menu so far for food, but I've been here about 4 times and everything I've eaten  so far has been great, and that includes one of the best burgers I know of. Really carefully made cocktails that are boozy and aren't overpriced for what they are. If they did take out, I'd probably eat here 3 days a week.",5.0
"Great experience. The whole grilled fish was well-seasoned and juicy, swiss chard was tender, and the chocolate dessert also excellent. The menu is short, but each dish we had was prepared just right. Casual atmosphere and good music.",5.0
"Food was excellent. I highly recommend the Salsa Verde Asparagus, it was hands down the best asparagus dish I've ever had. I had the burger and my girlfriend had the whole fish. Both were perfect. This place is a perfect addition to North Greenpoint, and we'll be coming here quite often after this great first experience.",5.0
"I had such a pleasant first experience at the Bounty, I decided to have my wedding dinner here. Now, bringing in 12 people for dinner can be a dicey prospect, and there's bound to be a snag or two with such a big crowd. But dang, the folks at the Bounty went out of their way to make us all feel welcome and comfortable (even though we were late), put up with many demanding voices and food allergies with grace and care, filled us all to the brim with delicious food and drink, and made no move to rush us despite how much space we were taking on a busy night. It was such a nice cozy atmosphere to top off a whirlwind day, and everyone in our group loved every minute of it. There are few restaurants I can think of that could pull off a 12 for 12 approval rating. They're just downright nice people, and they've created a lovely neighborhood space with perfectly yummy food and drink. I can't thank them enough for being so accommodating and helping to make our day some of the best fun we've ever had.",5.0
"Menu, quality of preparation, atmosphere and service was excellent!  Wine pour a tad bit skimpy...nearly 4 ounces.",5.0
"Bravo! We had a great time last night at The Bounty. It was my Sister In Law's 50th Birthday  and we had a ball. The staff made us feel right at home. We ate, drank and was merry. The ambiance was fabulous, like the food. The only con was the night had to end. Thanks for making our night a memorable one....",5.0
We showed up on a Saturday night without reservations and the staff accommodated us. The dishes are simple and delicious. The drinks were decently priced and nothing to complain about.,4.0
"We have certain expectations for friendly service. Those expectations were not met. We'd heard this place had a decent burger. We came in, 6pm empty restaurant, asked for table for 2, the hostess just wasn't friendly, in need of attitude adjustment for service business. She said ""Well we have QUITE a few reservations but we'll SEE what we can do."" Um don't do us no favors, young lady! This isn't The French Laundry. It's January and it was pouring rain, and we were soaked even with our umbrellas after a cool Patrick Wilson sighting at Brooklyn Industries down the block. Hostess came back and pointed to the two tables directly in front of the door. It's January. It's cold. We're wet. Just a classic obnoxious restaurant thing to do to offer us the two worst tables in the restaurant. We offered to sit at the bar but the bartender seemed overwhelmed, spritzing seltzer into several drinks in increments over a few minutes. We peaced out and walked over to Mrs. Kim's who knocked it out of the park with sick fried chicken and these rice cakes that were a delight. Go to Mrs. Kim's everyone! Next to Vamos on Franklin.
