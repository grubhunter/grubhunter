"So this place is pretty much Brooklyn's best kept secret. You can feed a ravenous party of 2 with a hefty order of dumplings, wontons, hot and sour soup, pan fried buns, and a sesame pancake, all for a jaw-dropping $7. They are super quick (in and out in minutes) and the girl (and her male counterpart) that work the front are great and know exactly what they're doing.",5.0
"This might not be the best looking place to eat, ok it's also not very comfortable or clean.... but have you seen the food you get for crazy low prices!?You can tell it's delicious once you smell the air in this place. The dough on the dumplings are chewy and springy. The crust on the scallion pancakes are crunchy and flavorful. They cooked them on these mesmerizingly large flat woks (I need one in my life). If you can overlook some sanity issues, then give this place a shot. It's one of the most authentic Chinese street food places you'll ever visit in Brooklyn.",4.0
"dumplings on FLEEK... or should i say on LEEK? (sorry, bad jokes)But yes, if you want some good cheap late night chinese food such as dumplings or noodle soup check this place out. dumplings are 4 for $1 and they are packed with juicy flavor. make sure you still put on some sriracha for some heat.The beef stew noodle soup is very tasty too. if you want some warm broth, it's a good choice. Just don't drink the whole thing because it can get salty.bring CASH",4.0
"$1 for 4 cheap and tasty dumplings. Dumplings are constantly being made so expect them to be fresh. I usually get the pork and chive dumplings. They're crispy on the outside and flavorful on the inside. I seldom dine in here. I've used the restroom years back and it was not a friendly sight. You're better off taking your order to go.If you're taking your order to go, the take-out boxes will make your dumplings slightly soggy from the moisture/steam.",3.0
"stopped in for a quick dinner after reading such good reviews. the place is small- 4 tables. the wait time for food was unbelievably quick, and like everyone else mentioned - unbelievably cheap. we had the dumplings which were decent, the beef stew noodles soup - which for the price, cant complain although ive had better. tried the spring roll which was a disappointment but again for the price - cant complain. and also had the wonton soup which was half canto style- half fj style? wasnt as big as the canto wontons but wasnt as small as a fj wonton soup. decent but not too flavorful. the meal for 2 was $9. cant complain.",3.0
I gave it a 5 stars before but the magic went away after seeing a family of roaches just happened to cross the counter and into the little crack...which was the barrier between people waiting for their orders and the food itself in the kitchen. Normally for me it's if it's out of sight it's out of mind. Now it kinda bothers me so I guess I'll take a break eating from here...But food is still cheap and yummy.

"This no-frills place is the real deal. Dirt cheap prices for delectable and juicy fried comfort food. We were the only non-Chinese people here and indeed the place seems quite popular with the locals. My party was actually all vegetarian and we found several things to order - scallion pancake, sesame pancake, spring rolls and steamed vegetarian dumplings. The bill was 11.75 for multiple helpings for three people. The meat offerings looked mighty tasty as well. You can even get a bag of 25 frozen dumplings to go for just 5 dollars to take home with you!",4.0
"My favorite go to dumpling spot in Brooklyn! I've been coming to this place for about 7-8 years now. I remember the good old times when they sold their dumplings at 5 for $1. As a poor starving teenager, I had some of the best meals here in the good old days.Walking into this place, it certainly does not feel clean or comfortable at all but when you start ordering a whole bunch of things and realized your bill is still under $10 .. you probably wouldn't mind sitting down to eat. There's a main sitting area then a larger seating area in the back of their restaurant. It's weird but that's their setup and they've been doing it for years. I generally order their dumplings, pan fried pork buns, scallion pancakes, wontons, and beef stew noodle soup. The dumplings are now 4 for $1 and I like to ask for more sauces when I get things to go because one of each is just not enough. I switch around from the scallion pancakes or beef pan cakes depending on my mood. I prefer the flat noodles instead of the rice noodles and I'll have my ten wontons as it is without noodles.",4.0
"I am disappointed in both service and food provided here. I ordered a beef stew noodle, $2 pot stickers, a large hot and sour soup, and spring rolls. The cashier asked me 5 times to repeat my order. Each time she ask me she didn't write it down. She didn't tell me they ran out of hot and sour soup ( but she did ask everyone else If they want to wait for the soup) and I already paid her for everything. I waited about 10 minutes for the soup and when I got home I found a long strip of plastic in my soup. The beef stew used to be so good, it melts in your mouth; but today there was only ONE piece of beef in there with pork.The pork was so hard I couldn't even chew it apart.",2.0
"$1 dumplings make the world a better place.  They are so good!  Quick and easy lunch or snack.  The scallion pancake is also pretty good, but greasier than others I've had.  I had the beef soup with thick noodles (I don't know what they're called).  I didn't like this as much, but it was filling and cheap, and the noodles were yummy.  This place is just down the street from me.  I will be a frequent visitor.",4.0
"Despite looking dingy, this is quite the popular place with some pretty damn good dumplings, or so they say.I ordered the dumpling noodle soup after pondering for a long time.Dumpling Noodle Soup: Disappointing. It doesn't kill to put a little flavor in the soup. The noodles seem undercooked. It didn't have the desirable chewy consistency. Instead, it was hard and rather unappetizing. The dumplings, on the other hand, was absolutely delicious and full of flavor. There are two parts to the restaurant. One side is full of seats but there is no ac. The other side has less seating but the ac is on full blast. The best thing about this restaurant is that everything is cheap and affordable. Where can you get a full bowl of noodles for $4? Or 8 dumplings for less than $3? Should definitely come here to get a full meal if you're on a tight budget!The next time I come here, I'm just going to order off the dumpling menu.

OMFG the best dumpling spot in the world! I found this hole in the wall a few years back and as far as the food it's amazing and cheap I would pay double even triple for the dumplings there soo good and addicting I swear even the pork buns 3 for a $1 can't beat it.

I would like to see them renovate the setting one day but just one look gives you a neighborhood, familiar feel- you won't feel intimidated by this place.This dumpling house is best for those who are nearby and hungry or on a budget. When you're eating inside you can see students, nurses, and cops stopping by and realize that this is a local favorite.

The first time I came, I had the pork with leek dumplings and the scallion pancake. The dumplings were huge and juicy and I could not finish them all. The scallion pancake was a bit greasy but also delicious. For $4 it was very filling. I was a bit disappointed the second time when I got soup because the dumplings were a little too salty and the broth had no flavor to it and was very watered down. The first time I went the tables seemed dirty, but the second time it was much cleaner which made me question the cleanliness like other yelpers.

I opted for the standard pork/leek dumplings steamed, my go-to at all dumpling spots. I was quoted 10 minutes and waited exactly that.I was underwhelmed by these dumplings! So spoiled by the yummy, meaty ones at Lam Zhou and Super Taste. These dumplings are too thick-skinned, doughy, and with a skimpy filling. These were also some of the blandest dumplings I've ever had. I don't think they seasoned them whatsoever -- it literally tasted like boiled pork. I couldn't even taste the leek! I came back the next day to give this spot another chance -- I ordered the chicken/mushroom dumplings and was once again underwhelmed. The skins on these were even thicker, and the filling was also more bland than the pork/leek. Booo. I may come back to try some of their other offerings but will be passing on the dumplings.",2.0
"YESSS! This is the first place that ever made me fall in love with pan fried dumplings.They'd consistently had me going back for those stuffed and pop in your mouth juicy delicious dumplings (some days you might get the broken ones, or unjuicy ones though!) for a dollar!I am alsooo a fan of their wontons, anddd their pan fried pork buns.Their soy milk isnt bad either so feel free to try a carton when you wanna have something light to drink.The main chef there remembers me by now, and also two of their cashiers, and they always give me a smile. Thank you! :)I will always be back when in the area and craving some dumplings :)",5.0
"The food is good.  The four fried dumplings are good.  The wonton are good.  The sesame pancake is good.  The hot and sour soup is good.  For a total $4.25 and a very full stomach, where can you get such good food for price anywhere else.  Inflation, for the last couple of months on food price is hitting at another high.  But their price remain the same.  Unbelievable!!!  And yet still have good food.",5.0
"Good ole cheap dumpling house.  Only pork and chive dumplings are pan fried (4 x $1.00) and worth every penny.  The have a variety of typical quick Chinese dishes ( scallion pancakes, hot and sour soup, pork buns).  Everything is pretty greasy but it's what you'd expect for a place like this.Definitely does the trick if you're in the mood for cheap potstickers!",4.0
"This is the best Asian market that I have been to in quite some time.  Yes there's a lot of pushing and people on purposefully just bumping into you pushing past you screaming at each other but that's the normal way they talk.  It's a convenient location not too far from the N train, the bus stops about a block away. There are various Asian food items ingredients that are usually hard to find that you can find here with ease and a very large variety. The most exceptional thing about this place is the fish department you can get fish salmon for about five dollars a pound any octopus turtle frog they even have duck & rabbit all different delicacies that are excellent. You can imagine the ramen noodle  and tea section goes on for days they even have the industrial size pocky  the only thing missing is the bubble tea. They have a very good kimchi",5.0

"This is my fav spot for dumplings!!!! Fried dumplings, steamed dumplings and beef stew noodle soup! They are my all time fav and i must have 2 out of the 3 everytime i come here. Theres minimal seatings and gets crowded at times. They have sauces at the table, watered down hot sauce, vinegar and soy sauce.

I love coming here cos i can get a good meal without spending over $10 becos the food is so so cheap!!!",5.0
"AWESOME FOOD! The only reason this place gets only 4 stars is because it's a hole-in-the-wall, but it's an excellent hole-in-the-wall!

"$1 dumplings! Hands down the best dumplings in New York. Oh and they make the best hot and sour soups too. I've tried many but this is probably the only store which I like. They make the best and cheapest beef stew noodles. Something about their soup base that's really addicting. They used to be $3 a bowl before their renovated the place but now it's $4 and everything else, except for their dumplings increased by 25 cents to $1. It's still really cheap compared to other Chinese restaurants though. It's literally a hidden gem in Sunset Park.",5.0

"I decided to make the trip up here in order to get frozen dumplings for us for dinner. But it was also lunchtime and I hadn't eaten yet- and kinda wanted to know what I'd be serving for dinner, too. I got pork fried buns and the pork and leek dumplings, along with the frozen dumplings. Both were amazing- I'm pretty sure it was the same filling in both, just a different wrapper. The dumplings had the crispy part that I love about pan fried dumplings, and there was a good balance of dough to filling. Same for the fried buns- just that these were the fried/steamed bun dough as opposed to dumpling. I've never had a huge appetite, but the dumplings and fried buns filled me up! Not bad at all for $2.25 (fried buns are 3/$1.25, price changed since last reviews mentioning price. But still worth it.)",5.0

"On the surface, Kai Feng's interior and exterior decor might leave a lot left to be desired; look past its surface however and inside you'll find a very economical and delicious bargain of a meal in an otherwise already bargain-filled area.As others reviewers here have stated, this is first and foremost a dumpling haven. There are a wide variety of different dumplings, with steamed and fried options available. The steamed ones vary in the protein included (non-steamed ones are limited to pork-based selections only), and the steamed ones include shrimp, chicken, etc. There is a 10 minute wait on the steamed selections however, so be wary of that.Beyond their dumpling offerings, there are a wreath of different noodle and soup-based selections too; your typical wonton, hot & sour soups are readily made throughout the day. Price wise, everything is under 2-3 dollars and unless you opt to take some back home, 8-10 dollars is more than enough to sustain one self during a stop here.A note to those wondering about tipping if sitting down and dinning in; it is not customary or necessary to tip in a semi-self serve location such as this.

"A loong time ago, there was probably one dumpling place around the 8th avenue area and now they're everywhere! So before they started popping up everywhere along 8th avenue, this was one of the first! Their dumplings aren't amazing, but they're pretty good! The wrapping isn't thick, which is usually the problem with a lot of places specializing in dumplings. I agree with other yelpers, great for a quick snack! I find that I'm usually full with just one order of them. You absolutely have to try their scallion pancake, one of the best! Chewy, crispy and tasty!

I usually order the pork dumplings (4 for $1) that are already cooking in front of you, and a small wonton soup ($1). I never really order the more obscure and special types of dumplings on the menu since those haven't been cooked yet and you'll end up having to wait about 10 minutes for them.Their beef soup is very simple--just beef pieces, noodles (flat rice or udon) and some pieces of vegetables. it's $3.50 so it's expected to be without the frills but it's a large helping so I'd say it's worth the money if you're hungry.Finally, keep in mind this is very much a hole-in-the-wall type of dumpling shop. there's a small eating area and a larger (but dingy and sort of a storage room deal) eating area next door. If you're not picky about decor, I'd recommend eating your food there because the dumplings won't be crispy and juicy if you wait too long to eat it (hence some reviewers here complaining that the dumplings were soggy).Enjoy!!PS if you're having trouble finding it, it's because the address is a bit misleading.

"First I would say for the price wise its very cheap for what you would get. I think it was $1 for 4 or $2.5 for 8. The dumplings were very crisp and the fillings were nice too.

"It's not a store you'd easily find, even on the most known Brooklyn Asian street. It's located right off the corner of 48th street and 8th Ave and is the best dumpling house I know there so far. Other dumpling houses generally serves food by the waves or batches, but this place - it chucks out fresh dumplings by the HORDES. They have 3 wok pan-frying stations. Dumplings here have the best skin consistency - it's thin, yet just enough to fill you. At one dollar per four dumplings, this place is heaven. If you've even been to Vanessa's, Prosperity's or T-Spot dumpling houses in Manhattan, this place is comparable to those, if not sometimes better (depends on how fresh off the wok it is). If you order $5 or more, they sometimes throw an extra 4-6 dumplings in there for the heck of it. Neat, huh? Besides dumplings, this place also has amazing noodles (northern Chinese style - the thick white kind, not the more southern, skinny yellow egg noodles), scallion pancakes, and wonton soups. Scallion pancakes here are also amazing and one of my favorites. The Wonton soup here is also quite delicious (albeit simplistic) with a strong taste of black pepper in the hot soup - perfect for cold weather. Almost everything is a dollar or two on the menu and it's guaranteed to fill you up for cheap. My only complaint with the place is that it isn't the cleanest. Granted, all dumpling houses aren't clean if you think about it - you're wrapping grounded meat inside a dough wrapping by hand, which are then frozen, only to be defrosted and fried for you to eat. This place also looks quite run-down. Bathroom sucks, drink selection is rather bad, but this is Yelp - and we review food, not restaurant looks (although I do hope this place gets a make-over soon).One more last thing I like about this place - They provide separate bottles of soy sauce, vinegar, and sriracha sauce. Most place mix together certain sauces to be cheap, but you get to customize the vinegar level to tailor your own taste. Customizability is a plus on my book.",5.0
"I use to go to the middle school near this place and my friend suggested that i try the dumplings here and i fell in love with them. I try to eat the dumplings as often as i could back then. Later on i tried the hot and sour soup there and now i always get those two items. This place has the best hot and sour soup,i have tried it from other places and i hated it.Now every time i go back and visit my old neighborhood i would stop by and get  the dumplings and hot & sour soup. I have also tried the beef noodle soup and it's excellent. The portions are great and i get very full from just eating that. So i strongly suggest everyone to stop by once awhile and try all theses things. I'm sure the other food are great too but i don't like trying new things.",5.0
"I came back here again and was astounded by their quickness and efficiency. This place was packed when I went for lunch with family. The prices haven't went up since I last reviewed. Everything is so cheap that competitors can't complete for. This place is hidden behind graffiti, off 8th Ave. The food came out in under five minutes, out of the kitchen that is visible to diners and people waiting for their food. We had ordered pork and leek dumplings, which were juicy and inexpensive. We had ordered a pan fried bun, which were moist, not the most authentic, but still one of the best tasting I have tasted. Their scallion pancakes are greasy and wonderful. Their sesame pancakes are thick and worth the money. We tried their spring rolls, which were crispy and had lots of filling. We tried a dumpling noodle soup, which was a decent portion. The noodles absorbed all of the flavor from the broth and the dumplings were amazing. The beef noodle soup was incredible, a generous portion of tender beef, noodles, and a very dark, tasty broth. And this was all for under $15.",5.0

Scallion pancakes here are also amazing and one of my favorites. The Wonton soup here is also quite delicious (albeit simplistic) with a strong taste of black pepper in the hot soup - perfect for cold weather. Almost everything is a dollar or two on the menu and it's guaranteed to fill you up for cheap. My only complaint with the place is that it isn't the cleanest. Granted, all dumpling houses aren't clean if you think about it - you're wrapping grounded meat inside a dough wrapping by hand, which are then frozen, only to be defrosted and fried for you to eat. This place also looks quite run-down. Bathroom sucks, drink selection is rather bad, but this is Yelp - and we review food, not restaurant looks (although I do hope this place gets a make-over soon).One more last thing I like about this place - They provide separate bottles of soy sauce, vinegar, and sriracha sauce. Most place mix together certain sauces to be cheap, but you get to customize the vinegar level to tailor your own taste. Customizability is a plus on my book.",5.0
"I use to go to the middle school near this place and my friend suggested that i try the dumplings here and i fell in love with them. I try to eat the dumplings as often as i could back then. Later on i tried the hot and sour soup there and now i always get those two items. This place has the best hot and sour soup,i have tried it from other places and i hated it.Now every time i go back and visit my old neighborhood i would stop by and get  the dumplings and hot & sour soup. I have also tried the beef noodle soup and it's excellent. The portions are great and i get very full from just eating that. So i strongly suggest everyone to stop by once awhile and try all theses things. I'm sure the other food are great too but i don't like trying new things.",5.0
"I came back here again and was astounded by their quickness and efficiency. This place was packed when I went for lunch with family. The prices haven't went up since I last reviewed. Everything is so cheap that competitors can't complete for. This place is hidden behind graffiti, off 8th Ave. The food came out in under five minutes, out of the kitchen that is visible to diners and people waiting for their food. We had ordered pork and leek dumplings, which were juicy and inexpensive. We had ordered a pan fried bun, which were moist, not the most authentic, but still one of the best tasting I have tasted. Their scallion pancakes are greasy and wonderful. Their sesame pancakes are thick and worth the money. We tried their spring rolls, which were crispy and had lots of filling. We tried a dumpling noodle soup, which was a decent portion. The noodles absorbed all of the flavor from the broth and the dumplings were amazing. The beef noodle soup was incredible, a generous portion of tender beef, noodles, and a very dark, tasty broth. And this was all for under $15.",5.0

"Been a loyal customer for over 3yrs. It is a good cheap place to fill up an empty stomach. The pan fried dumplings are still the best, with the juice trapped inside each dumpling. I cannot rave about the wonton soup though, the wontons are so small, with very little filling. But then its only a buck, what more can you ask for. The scallion pancake doesn't taste as good as before. If the front gets full of people theres a dimly lit back room for additional seating. Food here isn't bad, just the quantity shrunk.",3.0

"So I have been coming here since its opening in the early 2000s. Back in the those days, 5 dumplings were 1 and the noodle soups were 2.50. Pretty sure it switched owners at some point and the dumpling quality decreased slightly but still the best I've had in the US. The standard potstickers with pork and leek (4 for $1) is thinskinned and juicy. Don't come here looking for dumplings with half inch thick skin with a tiny lump of overly soysauced meat. (I know there's a great number of you who prefer thicker doughier skin but this is the northern style dumpling so the skin is thinner) The wonton (6 for $1) tastes like cloud and pillows on your tongue. Add some vinegar, splash of soy sauce and hot sauce and those leftover dumpling juice in the broth of the wonton soup and you get some amazing taste-bud kicking flavors. Got leftover broth? Get a fresh sesame pancake (75cents) and dip that fragrant soft on the inside and crispy on the outside goodness into the broth. Best $2.75 meal ever. The noodles are good too. My dad always get their beef stew noodle soup. Their soy milk, mung bean soup and ice tea (a bit too sweet) is made in the house as well. Overall it's a great place to grab food. The service is quick and friendly. No tip required.Sometimes I wonder with the amount of money they made over the years why they didn't expand or clean up/renovate the place a little.

"$1 Scallion pancake -- how can I pass up such an opportunity?  Pulled from a pre-cooked stack of pancakes, hastily chopped into quarters with scissors, and then served up on a styrofoam plate just too small for it (and definitely too small for condiments anywhere put splat in the middle of the pancake.)  The first bites -- the first quarter -- I would rate as superb.  A little greasy, pretty salty, and certainly too chewy, it was a fantastic explosion of taste.  The second quarter, I started to feel nauseous from the grease, but the memories of the first quarter (and the wait for the dumplings) kept me digging in.  By the end of the third quarter, I was really feeling quite unhappy.The $2 plate of steamed dumplings -- I ordered the pork & celery -- were okay.  Freshly steamed to order.  Pretty devoid of flavor, really.  A lot of dough.  It could have been the fault of the pancake -- maybe my mouth and stomach were so lined with grease that I'd have tasted nothing at all.Not bad for a very filling $3 meal, but I probably won't be back.  Atmosphere was great.",2.0

"Definitely the best dumpling store in Brooklyn.  Their fried pork and chive dumplings not only taste great but also is beautifully fried.  The meat is juicy and the bottom of the dumpling has a nice crunch to it.  Their hot sauce isnt as watered down as the other dumpling stores around the area and is a perfect addition to the dumplings.  The hot & sout soup is amazing here, the vegies to soup ratio is perfect and their soup is flavorful.  This place could get quite crowded at times, but they have fast service and have a decent amount of seats in the front and the back, if you do eat there.  It might not be the most eye pleasing interior, but it's suitable for a quick bite.",5.0

"Greasy. That is all I can say. 4 dumplings for $1 is a good deal. However, I wouldn't like to be a regular in this place because their dumplings are too oily, greasy, and small.",3.0

"Great dumpling place. This place has been there a long time. Cheap and tasty dumplings, buns,wonton soups, noodle soups, sesame pancakes, and lots of other items. Everything is very tasty. 3 dollars is usually enough to fill my stomach from empty to full.",5.0
"Since the last time I visited this place (which was only about a month and a half ago) The prices have been raised by 20%. The dumplings here are still worth getting if you are in the area, but not a 5 star deal anymore.",4.0
"The fried dumplings, though a quarter less for 4 ($1 for four here) than most places in Flushing and Elmhurst, are not as fresh as they should be. The bottoms weren't as crisp, nor were the pork/chive fillings as chivey as I'd like. We also had the sesame pancake/bread, which was moist and tasty. The sheng jian bao (little buns encasing pork filling) are good, too. Service is very friendly, though.",3.0
"$1 Scallion pancake -- how can I pass up such an opportunity?  Pulled from a pre-cooked stack of pancakes, hastily chopped into quarters with scissors, and then served up on a styrofoam plate just too small for it (and definitely too small for condiments anywhere put splat in the middle of the pancake.)  The first bites -- the first quarter -- I would rate as superb.  A little greasy, pretty salty, and certainly too chewy, it was a fantastic explosion of taste.  The second quarter, I started to feel nauseous from the grease, but the memories of the first quarter (and the wait for the dumplings) kept me digging in.  By the end of the third quarter, I was really feeling quite unhappy.The $2 plate of steamed dumplings -- I ordered the pork & celery -- were okay.  Freshly steamed to order.  Pretty devoid of flavor, really.  A lot of dough.  It could have been the fault of the pancake -- maybe my mouth and stomach were so lined with grease that I'd have tasted nothing at all.Not bad for a very filling $3 meal, but I probably won't be back.  Atmosphere was great.",2.0
"My friends keep raving about this place, and we finally paid a visit! The dumplings are 4 for $1 and it was not bad...3.5 most..but i'll bump it up.The pot sticks were flavorful and good...but one thing about it is that its a little too moist...and it breaks apart easily..which i dont like much...but other then that...no compliants!",4.0
"I've been a customer for about 4 years.  This place is great (and cheap) for fried dumplings..$1 for five.  The scallion pancake is also $1/peice.  Their soup wonton is very very nice for cold winters.  They also have various noodles, but I've had better noodles in other places (Please seach for Yun Nan Snack restaurant, which is only 1 minute walking distance from this place)The place was originally operated by northen Chinese people (FYI: Dumplings are mastered by the Northen part of China).  The quality of the food went down a little after it was handed to Fujianese (That's why I gave it a 3 star opposed to the 4 star this place originally deserves)Don't expect service....You order by the counter and pick up your food there when the kitchen staff yell out your order.  During peak time, it is very hard to find sitting spots, and you often have to share the table with others.",3.0
"Definitely the best dumpling store in Brooklyn.  Their fried pork and chive dumplings not only taste great but also is beautifully fried.  The meat is juicy and the bottom of the dumpling has a nice crunch to it.  Their hot sauce isnt as watered down as the other dumpling stores around the area and is a perfect addition to the dumplings.  The hot & sout soup is amazing here, the vegies to soup ratio is perfect and their soup is flavorful.  This place could get quite crowded at times, but they have fast service and have a decent amount of seats in the front and the back, if you do eat there.  It might not be the most eye pleasing interior, but it's suitable for a quick bite.",5.0
"Best pan fried dumplings ever!! 1 dollar for 4! Seriously you will not regret eating here. Just eat it on the spot and not take out; IMO they only taste good fresh out the wok, not 20 mins later.
