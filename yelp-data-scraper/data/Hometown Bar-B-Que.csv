"This was one of the best BBQ places around NYC. Everything we had there was amazing and the ambiance at the restaurant was also pretty cool. It could accommodate families and couples. It had 2 rooms with communal seats and some tables. The wait to order food was not that bad and we were in line for about 10 minutes. I wish I could have gone there with more people, so that I could have tried more things on the menu. The only down side is that this place was hard to get to, even with car. Parking was not that difficult to get (since it was a Sunday) but there are no subways nearby. Jerk spare ribs- SO GOOD! One of the best ribs I've had. It was cooked to perfection. When you bite into it, you can see the different balanced layers of meat and fat. It was not too overly fatty but the fat just enhanced the flavor. It was cooked medium so that I meat tender but not chewy, hard or dry. The rub was more on the smokey side and it was not too spicy or overpowering. Pulled pork sandwich- I have never tasted a more moist, tender and juicy pulled pork. I always hated bbq sauce on pulled pork and this one was just marinated in the pork's juices (but it was not oily or fatty). Â The sandwich came on a simple, toasted fresh bun with some cole slaw. Sticky wings- the flavoring was great. Once again not that spicy or too sweet. It had a great sesame taste. I wish the wings were more crisp but I always liked my wings well done. Beans- I personally did not like this but my boyfriend loved it. I guess it depends on how you like the sauce that the beans are cooked in. The sauce was very thick, dense and cooked down...sort of like a mush. It was heavy on the burned taste (it had burnt ends). I personally like my beans to not have a heavy sauce. Mac and cheese- I love it because it had this awesome queso sauce that pour on top of the mac and cheese. Why didn't someone think of this before!!Corn bread- Decent. Not the best or worst.",5.0
"Pretty good BBQ overall. Located in hipster Brooklyn, this is great area to come for food, by-the-water gazing and taking a trip to Ikea nearby. Came here for Sunday food, but even coming relatively early on a Sunday still ended up with a 45 minute wait. Don't worry though, the line is a bit deceiving (as in we thought it was shorter than it really was!) The place itself looks really really cool (all dark wood) with cafeteria bench style seating. There is a main area where you can order food, a separate bar area and a general seating space. There is also a second area where there is another bar area and seating. I would recommend Hometown BBQ start venting the air in the main room - it smells too smokey to the point my lungs know it may hurt to breathe. Just a thought... Now to the food: Brisket - Delicious though not the best I've ever had. Great flavor, slightly dry in certain spots but overall I really liked it. Lamb belly - Holy crap this is deliciously decadent. The best part of the meal - amazing at first bite and oh so decadently fatty by the end. You need a beer in hand while eating this. Do not miss getting lamb belly. Mac and Cheese - Tasty but not the best I've ever had. They have a wonderful selection of beer so make sure to get some beer when eating delicious BBQ food. Pretty good BBQ that is cheaper than some of the places in the city. Worth it to come and try their food.",4.0
"Love the BBQ here. The space is huge with two large rooms (each with it's own bar) and a bunch of communal tables. My first time was a little awkward since there is no host to greet/seat you and it's completely self serve. You walk up to the counter (if there's no line) and order your meats and sides. There's a rack around the side with utensils, plates, napkins, and the all important sauces. Then just grab an open seat and get to business.I went with 3 friends and we ordered 1lb of brisket, 1lb of pulled pork, vietnamese wings, mac and cheese, baked beans, and some corn bread. Everything was great but the stand outs were def the brisket and mac and cheese. Also a big fan of the hot and sweet sauce.I'm not a big drinker but they have a ton of beers on tap too.",4.0
"If there's anything that I crave regularly, it's BBQ, and when I have a BBQ craving, there's nowhere I long to go more than Hometown Bar-B-Que. It's a special occasion due to its location in Red Hook, but that almost makes it more special -- you've come all this way, and you might as well make it count. There's no denying that the line is LONG -- our compatriots took one for the team and waited in the hour-plus long line while us ladies held down a couple spots at the bar and ordered the bloody mary's (which our man-friends were able to drink in said line -- I'd definitely suggest going in a group so you can score a spot, or at least have someone on eagle eye duty. We didn't have trouble finding a place to sit, and I wonder if it's because it was FREEZING that day. I digress, you're here to hear about the food. To start, the bloody mary is delicious, but unusual. It's a bit sweet and not too spicy, like the candied bacon that garnishes it. It's right up my alley, but if you're generally not a sweet pickle/relish fan you probably won't be into it, that's the vibe. We got brisket, pulled pork, and a MASSIVE beef rib, and it was more than enough for the four of us. My favorite thing was the rib, but due to the price it's more of a shareable bite than an order for yourself item. The brisket is super solid, very peppery, and super juicy, and the pulled pork is everything pulled pork should be. There are two kinds of sauce, and I like to mix 'em together. Sides wise, I haven't tried the beans, but the queso mac and cheese is TO DIE FOR and the collards are also top notch. I wish sauce wise they had a slightly less sweet option and a slightly less spicy one -- maybe something vinegar based? The two they have are on the extreme ends of the spectrum in both directions and it's a bit overpowering. You want to be able to taste this meat, but it does benefit from a bit of a saucing.",4.0
Good Q. Side street parking. Brisket and ribs are sure fire. Cornbread great. Eat here.,4.0
"If Hometown was anywhere else in the city or Williamsburg, you'll never be able to find a seat. This bbq joint is designed as a southern style where everyone orders from the counter and then you find your own seat. There are many seats here with two separate rooms and two separate bars. You can be on benches in the louder area or you can go to the more family friendly separate room with regular tables. The food here is easily one of the best in New York. They have all the usual pulled pork, brisket, ribs, chicken, and even bacon. The sides can be beans, Mac and cheese, okra, etc. The bar is full and beers are craft. This is a hipster and foodie dream place!We had the pastrami bacon to start, followed by jerk ribs some pulled pork, some beans, Mac n cheese, and brisket. Knowing us, we had small portions of everything to try. Only complaint is the bacon is just too fatty and salty. That'll take some beers and water to wash down for sure. Everything else we had was delicious and filling. You'll be surprised how quickly a quarter pound of meat will fill you up. Thankfully, we slowly but surely chipped away at the meat mounds. This is worth a drive from anywhere to eat!",5.0
"Went on a Saturday night around 6pm and the line wasn't so bad...however, it does move very slowly! The menu isn't very extensive and drinks are sold separately at the bar. Here's the breakdown:-brisket: a bit on the chewier (read: dry) side. meh, i've had better-lamb belly: pretty darn good. fatty, a little gamey. so yum! my fave of the meats.-chicken: a-okay. interestingly, it has a ginger/scallion sauce on the side that is very reminiscent of a Chinese ""white cut chicken.""-jamaican jerk ribs: pretty standard ribs. i liked them, would probably order again-sausage: you can definitely taste that they're homemade and very fresh (not smokey, and not over-seasoned with salt/nitrates). -mac and cheese: bleh. way too salty and cheese is overwhelming. pass. -potato salad: my fave side. just perfect. -coleslaw: it's alright, just had to order some vegetables, because everything is fatty meat or carbs. The bar had a nice variety of beers on tap. Got my six point sweet action and this mild cider that tastes like carbonated apple juice my brother really liked. :P",4.0
"I'm from South Carolina, so I have high standards for bbq. Hometown hit the spot. Good bbq is SO hard to find in NYC, so after this place kept popping up on foodie blogs and such, I put it on my list of places to try. My boyfriend and I were planning a trip to Ikea today, so it was the perfect time to go to Hometown for lunch! It's a very spacious restaurant, with two large seating areas, two bars, and a stage for live music in one of them. The line moves super quickly. You give the first person your meat order, and the second person serves up the sides and rings you up. Both of the people we interacted with were friendly and efficient. Our total was about $40 for the pulled pork sandwich, brisket sandwich, medium side of mac and cheese, and medium side of collard greens. Both of the sandwiches had excellent flavor! They were super juicy and the meat was very tender. I liked the pulled pork better because it had ""hometown slaw"" on it and a bolder flavor. They really didn't need any extra sauce or anything though. They have two types of sauce-one is a bit spicy and the other is sweet. The bread on each was great too, and the meat didn't make it soggy. The sides were amazing. The mac and cheese had roasted chiles in it and a distinct, delicious flavor. The texture was perfect-not overly saturated with melted cheese, but not hard and dry either. The collard greens were so full of flavor! They had smoked pork shoulder bits in them. I've eaten a lot of mac and cheese and collard greens, and these were definitely some of the best I've had. Don't let the trip to Red Hook deter you-it's an easy walk from the F and G trains, and lots of other great bars and restaurants in the area!",5.0
"Damn good BBQ and service. There's not much else in the area but well worth the trek. We caught the M61 from Borough hall which dropped us off right across the street. We came for lunch on a Saturday and there was no wait. The place is huge - one bar area and another area for BBQ. It's all self serve - you order and seat yourself. All the utensils, water and take out boxes are by the counter.Brisket (1/4 lb) - juicy and flavorful. The outside looks charred but it's actually the rub they use that makes it look that way. The Â guy cutting the meat even gave several of us in line a sample. Beef ribs (1 lb) - very tender and came right off the bone. Minimum order is one poundJerk ribs (1/2 lb) - goodMac & cheese - so bad but so good, they even had bacon or ham bits in itCollard greens - standard greens to offset all the fatty goodnessExcellent service as well, my husband loves BBQ so he tends to over order. We originally ordered a half pound of brisket in addition to all the meat above and the guy told us it was Â too much and recommended a quarter pound. We were so glad we took his suggestion because we still had leftovers to take home!",5.0
"This BBQ joint dishes out one to the most tastiest BBQ in Brooklyn, NY. The place resembles that of a barn, open, wide, with high ceilings, which has been decorated wtih string lights, that is made to look like you are eating under the stars. The seating are very informal, typical backyard like furnitures, that goes well with the team of backyard BBQ. Â There's are communal tables for those who don't want to appear to be eating alone and likes the company of strangers. They have a bar that appears to be well stocked with bourbon, whiskey, and other quintessential spirits that goes well with smoked meat.Now on the the star, the BBQ. Â I tried the following:Jerk BBQ ribsBrisketVietnamese hot wingsSticky Asian RibsPulled pork tacosSmoked ChickenCorn breadCollard greensMac & CheeseCole SlawSo what's the verdict?My favorite had to be the Brisket. Â It was smokey, with good seasoning, and the right amount of fat that melted in your mouth as you devour it. Â Add on their house special sauces (the ""stick"" and the ""hot and sweet"") and you got yourself a killer brisket. Â the brisket was tender, juicy, and just plan delicious. Â Been her twice and order brisket both times.The second favorite is the Vietnamese hot wings. This thing is tangy, sweet, and spicy all in one. Â How can you go wrong with that? It came with blue cheese dipping sauce which I didn't care for much, but the hubby like it. Â So I guess some will like it and some will be happy without it (like me)This is followed very closely by the Sticky Asian Ribs (the reason why I came back the second time because I didn't get to try this one and I was disappointed with the jerk bbw ribs, but more on this later). Â Similar to the Vietnamese hot wings, the right balance of hot, sweet, and tangy. Â Only reason this thing came second is that I found the meat on the dyer side. Â It's still moist, but I would have like ti to be more moist and less dry. Â The pulled port tacos were also very good, but not memorable enough to even crave for more on my next visit. Â I think they can certainly elevate this more but adding more flavor profile when building the taco itself. Â I know what you are thinking, you say you want to pork to be the star of the dish, why add more stuff? Â Well, if you just want to pulled pork, then order just the pulled pork and not the taco. Â If you crave taco, then you want that additional condiments that go with a good taco, like onions, cilantro, pico de gallo, etc. Smoked chicken was also good. Moist and flavorful. .... ammm I have nothing else.Jerk BBQ ribs - maybe I am not a fan of any jerked type of meat (lol, silly thoughts). Meaning I also don't like jerk chicken. This may be why this was my least favorite. Â It just found it dry, overcooked even, and just blah. Â Never ordering this again. The sides....loved the corn bread. Â They brushed them with watered down honey. Â Each bite is a surprise. Â The sweetness if not overwhelming, but just the right amount. Â The gritty texture makes it takes more authentic. Â Loved these.Mac & Cheese was my husband's favorite side. Â I am okay with it. Â I think it could me more creamier and smooth. But still not bad at all. For the rest, they are just okay.I do like this joint a lot. Â Hoping to bring more friends next time I visit.",4.0
"Let's get straight to the meat. I shared the brisket and the lamb belly. The brisket was moist and tender. It didn't quite fall apart, yet it cut apart very easily. The burnt ends were balanced; that is, they added flavor but didn't overwhelm the interior. The lamb belly was a unique option I haven't seen else where. The meat retained the unique flavor of lamb and was served pulled. I was overwhelmed by how greasy it was. Nonetheless, it was a unique option that I'd suggest trying.The sides were outstanding! I would recommend any of the sides I tried which included the collard greens, baked beans, and mac'n'cheese. The collard greens had pork mixed in with it which added a degree of savory I haven't tasted before in collard greens. The baked beans had burnt ends mixed in and were some of the most flavorful barbecue beans that I've ever tried. They were both tangy and smokey. I'd highly recommend the beans. The mac'n'cheese was made with a queso dip like cheese which was an interesting take on the dish.Hometown has about eight draft beers on tap with a majority being craft options. The self service style made the experience convenient after you picked up your food, but the wait for food was pretty long.",5.0
"Came here saturday night and waited like an hour to get seats. This place was sooo packed, and the line for food was ridiculously long. They have limited seats and you gotta turn your inner savage mode on to get seats. Anyways we (3) got brisket, beef rib, pulled pork, jerk baby ribs and pork belly. They were all sooo soft and delishh. My personal faves were brisket and pork belly. They literally melt in your mouth. It was full of fat so that's prob why it tasted so good but still it's worth it! I love their sauce too. Spicy house sauce was really spicy so dont try if you can't handle. For sides, we got corn breads, mac and cheese, beans, slaw and sour pickles. Besides soup pickles and corn breads, i was not impressed. Pickles are pickles so you can't go wrong with it but it mashes well in your mouth with meat. I dont really like corn breads but my friend bought like 6 and said he doesnt regret buying so many. Next time I come here i wanna try lamb meat! Portions are big when it comes to bbq and ended up taking some home. Def try to avoid weekends!",4.0
"This review is coming after my second visit to the place and the verdict still stands- great BBQ! The only difference between my first and second visit was the line, and boy was it a big difference. If you're coming in for dinner, especially a weekend dinner, be prepared to wait upwards of an hour! Grabbing seats is probably the only thing worse than waiting on line. With a line like that people it's basically a professional game of musical chairs. But with that all being said, going for lunch I didn't have any of these problems and was able to thoroughly enjoy the food, so eat wisely!As for the food, like many of the reviews below have said- so so good. My favorites among the BBQ were the brisket and sausage; I think they're a must-get when you're eating here. Unfortunately they were out of the lamb belly and spare ribs by the time ordered so I can't speak on that. I found the Jamaican jerk and beef ribs to be a little dry, but nothing that their BBQ sauce couldn't fix.The sides that stood out were the collard greens and corn bread. I prefer my Mac and cheese on the creamier side so this didn't wow me, but my friends really enjoyed this side. The disappointment was definitely the beans. They did not taste good. The slaw was nothing special just regular slaw, which is fine because I NEED slaw with my BBQ. Drinks are very fairly priced and they have a good variety of draft and bottled beers. I didn't get to try the dessert but I'm not worried because I will be back!",4.0
"My first run-in with Hometown BBQ came when I attended Meatopia, a meat lover's paradise that takes place on the piers over in Hell's Kitchen. There, I met some of the people and pit masters behind Hometown, and I was thoroughly impressed with everything they presented that day, especially the beef rib.Needless to say, I made it a priority to get over there and try more.Hometown is a mix of Texas and Carolina styles - serving up a healthy smattering of both beef and pork, dry and sauced - but it has a heavy NYC influence to the flavor profiles, and the pit masters take lots of free license concerning BBQ fusion ideas.As I mentioned in my Guide to Regional BBQ Styles, I believe that NYC is emerging as its own distinctly amazing BBQ style, especially given the varied immigrant communities that touch on the lives of all in this great city.Hometown takes advantage of that diverse cuisine-culture, as all of the ownership, management and pit masters come from either New York, Brooklyn or elsewhere in the five boroughs. As a result you have menu items like (1) Jamaican jerk baby back ribs, (2) Italian sausage, (3) Chinese sticky ribs, (4) Vietnamese lamb belly banh mi sandwiches and chicken wings, (5) Jewish pastrami-spiced bacon (sinful!), and (6) Oaxacan marinated wood fired chicken and tacos.As you can see, the menu is quite varied. And the pit masters will grab anything that comes their way and spin it into a great BBQ fusion dish, whether it's beef tongue, duck, or whatever, on any given day. Turkey and chicken make a solid presence here. My only regret is that I was too full to try the turkey, wood fired chicken, and Vietnamese chicken wings.So here's what we had:(1) Lamb Belly: this was actually our least favorite of all the meats, but that is by no means an indictment of quality. Think of it this way: You can choose five pounds of gold, or ten pounds of gold. Which do you choose? Ten, of course, but five is still awesome. This meat had all the great soft, yet sticky-crisp flavors that you associate with belly meat, but with the fat flavor of lamb. I can definitely see how this might go well on a banh mi sandwich, as per the menu offering.(2) Pulled Pork: This was delicious, especially when adding a little bit of the spicy (bright red) BBQ sauce to it. The meat itself wasn't over sauced at the outset, of which I was highly appreciative, and it had both a nice sweetness and pickle-pop to it that didn't overpower.(3) Brisket: This was probably my favorite. It was very juicy and had tons of smokey flavor. If you're a smoke fiend, then add a touch of the smokey BBQ sauce (darker colored container), and you're instantly transported to wood-fired heaven.(4) Italian Sausage: I loved this Brooklyn spin on the classic BBQ joint sausage link. While I do love me some Texas hot links and classic Bavarian sausage, this was a welcome change of pace. It was cleverly served with a light tomato sauce, though it didn't taste exactly like a traditional parsley and cheese Italian link. The pungent smoke, fire roasted peppers and aged provolone added a whole different dynamic to the meat that truly made it Italian BBQ fusion.(5) Jamaican Jerk Baby Back Ribs: Wow. These were really interesting. The jerk spice and sauce create a nice thin bark on the outside, but the smoke causes the flavors to permeate through the entirety of the meat. This was a unique execution of baby back ribs.(6) Pastrami Bacon: Pastrami and bacon are two words that perhaps don't belong together in the NYC Jewish community, as it is straight up not Kosher for Passover, but this was pure heaven as far as sinful eating goes. Crispy, fatty, meaty and all around perfectly cooked, this grill-kissed slab bacon came with a velvety honey mustard sauce that actually paired great with all of the meats we tried.We didn't get down on any sides. Next time. We were so focused on the meat that we lost sight of the other goodies on the menu. I wish we ordered some whiskey sour pickles. My eyes were so dazzled by the meat selections that I completely missed them when I was reading the menu. BBQ + Pickles = Heaven. I am ashamed...The bars here are great, too, by the way: one in the front, one in the back. They have a Texas vibe, and the drinks are somewhat reasonably priced for the city. My Tecate and neat Jameson came to $13: $4 for the beer and $9 for the whisky.The atmosphere here is awesome. It feels like you're in a warehouse barn that has several fires burning. The smells are invigorating, warm and inviting. This was a perfect refuge from the downpour and cold weather that was happening the day I came here.That's the back room. In the front (through the door to the right of the bar), there's another big bar room with more tables and a small stage for live music performances. This is the counter where you order your food:REVIEW CUT FOR LENGTH",5.0

"Driving around Red Hook with no particular destination in mind, we turned a corner. Â ""I smell barbecue, are we near Hometown?!"" Â Low and behold we were, we parked right in front and noticed no one standing around - it was a sign that we should eat. Â It was 4:40 on Saturday afternoon, but hey why not. Â Once inside we found a line of about 20 people, not bad. Â Even with that short of a line, it took about 30 minutes. Â Approaching the front of the line, with 3 people ahead of me the unthinkable happened - they ran out of spare ribs AND baby backs; I was crushed. Â Luckily there was lots more to choose form and since we were there we felt the need to try as many items as we could and ordered quite a bit.Beef Rib - huge and I think the best thing I tasted. It was incredibly tender, fall off the bone, with a great beefy flavor. Â Excellent.Brisket - juicy and slightly fatty with a nice bark. Â Melt in your mouth delicious.Pulled Pork - was good, even better when the BBQ sauce was added to each bite.Lamb Belly - kind of amazing, succulent with a great lamb flavor without being gamy or greasy. Â Not your typical BBQ, but worth a try if you like lamb.Hot Wings - I never thought I'd go to a BBQ place and order hot wings, but after hearing about how good they were I couldn't pass them up. Â They were divine. Â Fried perfectly without being heavy and covered with a sriracha honey sauce - they were sweet and spicy and delectable. Â The ranch dressing served on the side is awesome.As if that wasn't enough, we tried some sides as well.Collard greens, potato salad, coleslaw and pickles. Â All were good and went well with the meat; were they purely original and amazing? No but they did the job and enhanced the meal.Nice beer selection at the bar.I enjoyed the vibe of the place; energetic, some great music playing, string lights adorning the ceiling. Â It was a lovely evening. Â We may have eaten dinner super early, but being able to enjoy the Hometown experience made it all worth it. Â Don't be afraid to over order - there are takeout containers with the utensils so you can take leftovers home.",4.0
"Very spacious and chill restaurant. It's a place where you order your food, pay, they give you a stand with a number, you find an available place to sit, and when your food is already, someone will bring you your food. You order drinks at the bar, both alcoholic and non-alcoholic. The menu is on the wall. You get your own forks and napkins at the condiment area. In the same area there are also to-go boxes and bags that you can get yourself if you didn't finish your food. And free self serve water. We ended up sitting at the bar, since the tables were pretty much all occupied. Sitting at the bar is a good option. The counter was spacious and there are hooks under to hang your coat and bag. We had:1. Jamacian jerk baby back ribs, a half rack for ($17). It wasn't spicy. Ribs were pretty good, well smoked, and the sauces that they have makes the meat taste even better. 2. Brisket tacos, topped with salsa verde, pickled red onion, sour cream, and cilantro. 3 for ($12). This was not that memorable. Just okay and for the price it should've been bomb. 3. Collard greens with smoked pork shoulder, small size for ($4). Needed some greens to go along with the meats and the pork made the greens taste a lot better.4. Hometown slaw, small size for ($4). I don't think they put mayonnaise. It was missing that. 5. Arnold palmer, which is mix ice tea and lemonade drink ($3). Between the 2 of us, it was the right portion and we were full. This is a good spot to hang out. Group friendly.",4.0
"To get to Hometown Bar-B-Que from my apartment in Manhattan, I hop on the A train for ~20 minutes then switch over to the B61 bus for another 15-20 minutes, and the trek is absolutely worth it. Â The vibes are perfect are in this barn-style BBQ joint, and the smoky, delicious aromas overtake you as soon as you approach the entrance. Â The food tastes as good as it smells, and it stands up to BBQ I've eaten in Texas. Â The pulled pork was tender and moist, complemented by Hometown's sauces and the sweet but not too creamy coleslaw. Â The cornbread wasn't spectacular, but the meal itself was finger-licking good. Â I need to go back and try the brisket and ribs, and just about everything else on the menu.",5.0
"This has consistently been the best BBQ I've had in the Northeast (even after many visits to Dinosaur BBQ in Syracuse, NY). The brisket is always smoked to perfection, the collard greens are just PERFECT, and the mac & cheese is ooey gooey goodness.

"The lamb-belly, beef-rib, and beef-brisket are phenomenally & sensationally cooked, but, unfortunately, get boring after a few bites. It's very succulent, overwhelming meat, and it needs something to cut the fat, maybe some lemon-lime-grapefruit-orange zest and/or juice, but the two sauces they provide really don't do it for me, at all. The sauces are tasty on their own, but they are too thick and too sugary for the meat, and don't actually enhance the experience, but, rather, are conflicting & actually disguise the meaty-meatiness. So maybe next time I'll just order these meats in sandwich form, which is a shame, but I'm sure they will be delicious. Jamaican Spare-ribs and Sriracha Chicken-wings are definitely a winner, and absolutely crowdpleasers, as are the amazing beans with brisket. The potato salad is hit or miss, one time it was way too raw-vinegary, caustic and acrid, but last night it was bangin' spot-on terrific. And I really just do not like their mac and cheese or their cornbread. Awesome location, secluded and spacious. Helpful, friendly staff. Nice atmosphere, warm ambiance.",4.0

The slaw was nothing special just regular slaw, which is fine because I NEED slaw with my BBQ. Drinks are very fairly priced and they have a good variety of draft and bottled beers. I didn't get to try the dessert but I'm not worried because I will be back!",4.0
"My first run-in with Hometown BBQ came when I attended Meatopia, a meat lover's paradise that takes place on the piers over in Hell's Kitchen. There, I met some of the people and pit masters behind Hometown, and I was thoroughly impressed with everything they presented that day, especially the beef rib.Needless to say, I made it a priority to get over there and try more.Hometown is a mix of Texas and Carolina styles - serving up a healthy smattering of both beef and pork, dry and sauced - but it has a heavy NYC influence to the flavor profiles, and the pit masters take lots of free license concerning BBQ fusion ideas.As I mentioned in my Guide to Regional BBQ Styles, I believe that NYC is emerging as its own distinctly amazing BBQ style, especially given the varied immigrant communities that touch on the lives of all in this great city.Hometown takes advantage of that diverse cuisine-culture, as all of the ownership, management and pit masters come from either New York, Brooklyn or elsewhere in the five boroughs. As a result you have menu items like (1) Jamaican jerk baby back ribs, (2) Italian sausage, (3) Chinese sticky ribs, (4) Vietnamese lamb belly banh mi sandwiches and chicken wings, (5) Jewish pastrami-spiced bacon (sinful!), and (6) Oaxacan marinated wood fired chicken and tacos.As you can see, the menu is quite varied. And the pit masters will grab anything that comes their way and spin it into a great BBQ fusion dish, whether it's beef tongue, duck, or whatever, on any given day. Turkey and chicken make a solid presence here. My only regret is that I was too full to try the turkey, wood fired chicken, and Vietnamese chicken wings.So here's what we had:(1) Lamb Belly: this was actually our least favorite of all the meats, but that is by no means an indictment of quality. Think of it this way: You can choose five pounds of gold, or ten pounds of gold. Which do you choose? Ten, of course, but five is still awesome. This meat had all the great soft, yet sticky-crisp flavors that you associate with belly meat, but with the fat flavor of lamb. I can definitely see how this might go well on a banh mi sandwich, as per the menu offering.(2) Pulled Pork: This was delicious, especially when adding a little bit of the spicy (bright red) BBQ sauce to it. The meat itself wasn't over sauced at the outset, of which I was highly appreciative, and it had both a nice sweetness and pickle-pop to it that didn't overpower.(3) Brisket: This was probably my favorite. It was very juicy and had tons of smokey flavor. If you're a smoke fiend, then add a touch of the smokey BBQ sauce (darker colored container), and you're instantly transported to wood-fired heaven.(4) Italian Sausage: I loved this Brooklyn spin on the classic BBQ joint sausage link. While I do love me some Texas hot links and classic Bavarian sausage, this was a welcome change of pace. It was cleverly served with a light tomato sauce, though it didn't taste exactly like a traditional parsley and cheese Italian link. The pungent smoke, fire roasted peppers and aged provolone added a whole different dynamic to the meat that truly made it Italian BBQ fusion.(5) Jamaican Jerk Baby Back Ribs: Wow. These were really interesting. The jerk spice and sauce create a nice thin bark on the outside, but the smoke causes the flavors to permeate through the entirety of the meat. This was a unique execution of baby back ribs.(6) Pastrami Bacon: Pastrami and bacon are two words that perhaps don't belong together in the NYC Jewish community, as it is straight up not Kosher for Passover, but this was pure heaven as far as sinful eating goes. Crispy, fatty, meaty and all around perfectly cooked, this grill-kissed slab bacon came with a velvety honey mustard sauce that actually paired great with all of the meats we tried.We didn't get down on any sides. Next time. We were so focused on the meat that we lost sight of the other goodies on the menu. I wish we ordered some whiskey sour pickles. My eyes were so dazzled by the meat selections that I completely missed them when I was reading the menu. BBQ + Pickles = Heaven. I am ashamed...The bars here are great, too, by the way: one in the front, one in the back. They have a Texas vibe, and the drinks are somewhat reasonably priced for the city. My Tecate and neat Jameson came to $13: $4 for the beer and $9 for the whisky.The atmosphere here is awesome. It feels like you're in a warehouse barn that has several fires burning. The smells are invigorating, warm and inviting. This was a perfect refuge from the downpour and cold weather that was happening the day I came here.That's the back room. In the front (through the door to the right of the bar), there's another big bar room with more tables and a small stage for live music performances. This is the counter where you order your food:REVIEW CUT FOR LENGTH",5.0
"mmmmmm, what a gem this is in bklyn! I loveeee how soft their brisket is here. Their pork tacos are to die for, their different variety of ribs and lastly, their lamb is not gamey at all. Super wallet friendly for the amount they give you. I highly recommend this spot- after eating here, you can definitely walk over for Steve's key lime pies.",4.0
"Driving around Red Hook with no particular destination in mind, we turned a corner. Â ""I smell barbecue, are we near Hometown?!"" Â Low and behold we were, we parked right in front and noticed no one standing around - it was a sign that we should eat. Â It was 4:40 on Saturday afternoon, but hey why not. Â Once inside we found a line of about 20 people, not bad. Â Even with that short of a line, it took about 30 minutes. Â Approaching the front of the line, with 3 people ahead of me the unthinkable happened - they ran out of spare ribs AND baby backs; I was crushed. Â Luckily there was lots more to choose form and since we were there we felt the need to try as many items as we could and ordered quite a bit.Beef Rib - huge and I think the best thing I tasted. It was incredibly tender, fall off the bone, with a great beefy flavor. Â Excellent.Brisket - juicy and slightly fatty with a nice bark. Â Melt in your mouth delicious.Pulled Pork - was good, even better when the BBQ sauce was added to each bite.Lamb Belly - kind of amazing, succulent with a great lamb flavor without being gamy or greasy. Â Not your typical BBQ, but worth a try if you like lamb.Hot Wings - I never thought I'd go to a BBQ place and order hot wings, but after hearing about how good they were I couldn't pass them up. Â They were divine. Â Fried perfectly without being heavy and covered with a sriracha honey sauce - they were sweet and spicy and delectable. Â The ranch dressing served on the side is awesome.As if that wasn't enough, we tried some sides as well.Collard greens, potato salad, coleslaw and pickles. Â All were good and went well with the meat; were they purely original and amazing? No but they did the job and enhanced the meal.Nice beer selection at the bar.I enjoyed the vibe of the place; energetic, some great music playing, string lights adorning the ceiling. Â It was a lovely evening. Â We may have eaten dinner super early, but being able to enjoy the Hometown experience made it all worth it. Â Don't be afraid to over order - there are takeout containers with the utensils so you can take leftovers home.",4.0
"Very spacious and chill restaurant. It's a place where you order your food, pay, they give you a stand with a number, you find an available place to sit, and when your food is already, someone will bring you your food. You order drinks at the bar, both alcoholic and non-alcoholic. The menu is on the wall. You get your own forks and napkins at the condiment area. In the same area there are also to-go boxes and bags that you can get yourself if you didn't finish your food. And free self serve water. We ended up sitting at the bar, since the tables were pretty much all occupied. Sitting at the bar is a good option. The counter was spacious and there are hooks under to hang your coat and bag. We had:1. Jamacian jerk baby back ribs, a half rack for ($17). It wasn't spicy. Ribs were pretty good, well smoked, and the sauces that they have makes the meat taste even better. 2. Brisket tacos, topped with salsa verde, pickled red onion, sour cream, and cilantro. 3 for ($12). This was not that memorable. Just okay and for the price it should've been bomb. 3. Collard greens with smoked pork shoulder, small size for ($4). Needed some greens to go along with the meats and the pork made the greens taste a lot better.4. Hometown slaw, small size for ($4). I don't think they put mayonnaise. It was missing that. 5. Arnold palmer, which is mix ice tea and lemonade drink ($3). Between the 2 of us, it was the right portion and we were full. This is a good spot to hang out. Group friendly.",4.0
"To get to Hometown Bar-B-Que from my apartment in Manhattan, I hop on the A train for ~20 minutes then switch over to the B61 bus for another 15-20 minutes, and the trek is absolutely worth it. Â The vibes are perfect are in this barn-style BBQ joint, and the smoky, delicious aromas overtake you as soon as you approach the entrance. Â The food tastes as good as it smells, and it stands up to BBQ I've eaten in Texas. Â The pulled pork was tender and moist, complemented by Hometown's sauces and the sweet but not too creamy coleslaw. Â The cornbread wasn't spectacular, but the meal itself was finger-licking good. Â I need to go back and try the brisket and ribs, and just about everything else on the menu.",5.0
"This has consistently been the best BBQ I've had in the Northeast (even after many visits to Dinosaur BBQ in Syracuse, NY). The brisket is always smoked to perfection, the collard greens are just PERFECT, and the mac & cheese is ooey gooey goodness. The vibe of the restaurant is great, the playlist is usually on point, and the bartenders always attentive.Can't ask for much more in a BBQ joint!",5.0
"The lamb-belly, beef-rib, and beef-brisket are phenomenally & sensationally cooked, but, unfortunately, get boring after a few bites. It's very succulent, overwhelming meat, and it needs something to cut the fat, maybe some lemon-lime-grapefruit-orange zest and/or juice, but the two sauces they provide really don't do it for me, at all. The sauces are tasty on their own, but they are too thick and too sugary for the meat, and don't actually enhance the experience, but, rather, are conflicting & actually disguise the meaty-meatiness. So maybe next time I'll just order these meats in sandwich form, which is a shame, but I'm sure they will be delicious. Jamaican Spare-ribs and Sriracha Chicken-wings are definitely a winner, and absolutely crowdpleasers, as are the amazing beans with brisket. The potato salad is hit or miss, one time it was way too raw-vinegary, caustic and acrid, but last night it was bangin' spot-on terrific. And I really just do not like their mac and cheese or their cornbread. Awesome location, secluded and spacious. Helpful, friendly staff. Nice atmosphere, warm ambiance.",4.0

What can I even say. Overpriced but delicious. You must eat everything hot and right away because once the food gets cold it's no longer good. Probably the best pulled pork I've ever had. So juicy and flavorful. The brisket was great hot but once it gets cooler it's dry and not as good. The Mac and cheese was EXTRA cheesy. Great and flavorful but only hot. Like I said the colder it gets the worse it gets. The wings were delicious but a little too spicy for my taste. The cornbread was amazing. Usually cornbread is dry but this one has a honey butter glaze and it's the perfect side. Spent about $53 on this meal to share with a friend. A little too much food but wanted to try everything.

Walk past the picnic style tables and jump on the line! The menu is an amazing array of Bbq meats you really cant go wrong with any selection. If Im not mistaken I think they will give you a sample if you ask for it. Considering the fact that there is no actual table service this place is pricey but its worth it. If you are not getting a sandwich they weigh the meat by the pound.I ordered the pulled pork sandwich with cole slaw and the queso mac n' cheese. The pulled pork was delicious on a yummy soft bun. Cole slaw can truly be a hit or miss but even that was delish. The mac n' cheese was amazing. The blend of cheese whatever that was was so good! It had a bit of a spicy kick that I loved!

Didn't even need a knife to cut it. Pulled Pork. It was good, but probably my least favorite. A bit fatty for me. Sausage - spot on. They have their own take and it was excellent. Chicken - excellent. All of the sides were great. I've never been a potato salad guy by they really did it well. My only regret was not getting a beef rib. Will definitely be back.

"One of the closest Texas experiences you can get up here in Brooklyn! Came here with a fellow Texas transplant a couple weeks ago, and we were both thoroughly impressed. The place has counter service. Lines can build up during peak hours, but moves pretty quick. We got a pound of moist brisket, a beef rib, jalapeno sausage, cole slaw, and mac&cheese. Everything was superb. Brisket was ultra-moist and fatty, snap apart tender, no knife needed - it just melts in your mouth! Good without the sauce if you're a purist, but the two sauces supplied at the table side were both delicious - one a more traditional/sweet one, and another tasting slightly spicy (almost like Sriracha infused). Beef rib was great - meat was super tender with a beautiful bark. Jalapeno sausage was good too. No disappointments on anything we ordered.Love the vibe of the place too. Wooden tables, strung out lights, live blue-grass band playing, Shiner on tap. Seriously, there were times I forgot I was in NY and thought I was back home in Texas. Â Billy Durney has a real winner here...although not surprising at all given that his craft has been honed with the likes of Wayne Mueller (a real Texas BBQ legend and class act). Make no mistake, if Hometown BBQ set up shop in Texas it could hold its own. This place is definitely worth the trek to Red Hook for any BBQ lovers out there.",5.0
"Our friends that we are visiting recommended this restaurant, bragging about how it has won national awards for BBQ. As it should! We ordered brisket, spare ribs, sriracha wings, potato salad, BBQ beans and the Texas style Mac and cheese. The meats were delicious, tender and no knife needed. But I could have made a meal just of the sides. The potato salad was the best I have ever had. Loaded with dill, it killed me to share it. The BBQ beans had huge chunks of burnt end brisket in it. Incredible, meaty flavor. Not spicy.The Mac and cheese was awesome. We got sauce on side, as it is spicy and the daughter was eating it. I recommend always asking for sauce on side because it is incredible and you will get more sauce. The wings were okay, but not worth ordering over anything else.",5.0
"A winning combination of nitrates, twang and alcohol. With a couple of guys in flannel plucking out some country tunes on a small stage in the back, three of us valiantly tried to consume several pounds of protein-based food, with a solitary side of cucumbers thrown in for good measure. We failed, of course, but not without stretching the lining of our stomaches or ensuring that we would not need to eat again until sometime the next afternoon.

"Hands down best BBQ in Brooklyn!!!Finally made it over here after seeing and hearing great things about this place. The location is a bit inconvenient Â as Redhook is on the edge of nowhere, nowhere meaning minimal transportation but its totally worth it!You can smell the BBQ from outside before you even walk in. Walk past the picnic style tables and jump on the line! The menu is an amazing array of Bbq meats you really cant go wrong with any selection. If Im not mistaken I think they will give you a sample if you ask for it. Considering the fact that there is no actual table service this place is pricey but its worth it. If you are not getting a sandwich they weigh the meat by the pound.I ordered the pulled pork sandwich with cole slaw and the queso mac n' cheese. The pulled pork was delicious on a yummy soft bun. Cole slaw can truly be a hit or miss but even that was delish. The mac n' cheese was amazing. The blend of cheese whatever that was was so good! It had a bit of a spicy kick that I loved! I will indeed be returning here to try other things on the menu perhaps maybe the brisket next time!",5.0
Great bbq + a cool space + live music + great beer and whiskey selection = five stars.,5.0
Vietnamese wings... I have never tasted wings this amazing/ brined smoked and fried - leaves you with you licking your fingers because the glaze is beyond amazing - matched with the Pear Margarita !!!! Speechless - love the smell and atmosphere !!!,5.0
"Their sticky ribs are a bit overpriced but very flavorful and yummy. The pastrami bacon was juicy n fatty. Spare ribs can be better, tips were a bit dry. But their sauces are very good for this purpose. One of the things i learned this meal was to never order chicken when there's a table of meat. As good as siracha wings are, they will not beat the beef. I didnt have a big enough party, so i need to come back for the brisket. Sadly, sides are no good so that part of the meal was very lacking.",3.0
"Stellar BBQ. I travel to Texas so I'm always on the lookout for good Q. We were there on Sunday afternoon and the line was totally manageable. I had the brisket, pulled pork, chicken and sausage. Sides were Mac n cheese, corn bread, beans and potato salad. Brisket - they knocked the brisket out of the park. I had a solid end cut and the bark was perfect. Great smoke ring. Didn't even need a knife to cut it. Pulled Pork. It was good, but probably my least favorite. A bit fatty for me. Sausage - spot on. They have their own take and it was excellent. Chicken - excellent. All of the sides were great. I've never been a potato salad guy by they really did it well. My only regret was not getting a beef rib. Will definitely be back. Â For you fellow jersey folks, the area was easy to get to and parking not a problem. A fairly kid friendly area and good walking to be had.",5.0
"Wow! I will never understand the hype about this place? Â Just because they charge you $16 for a half a pound of brisket, and $8 for some pickles doesn't mean it's the best brisket you have ever had! Â  And don't worry I have had my fare share of mouthwatering amazing BBQ's all over the country! Â This ain't one of them...There meat was below average, both in taste, and Â texture, Â it wasn't smoked enough, you felt it in the dryness of the meat..so yes when I confronted them they refunded my brisket, but I don't believe poeple should be fooled... Â Bottom line: Â this should be an example of how to make money, there business plan is amazing! Â The decor, the location, and the way they serve you is perfect.",1.0

"If you love BBQ then head over to Redhook, Brooklyn & check out Hometown BBQ. As soon as I stepped my foot in the door, I was slapped in the face with the smell of delicious smoky meat. This huge barn style restaurant is filled with tables, two big bars (one in the front room & the other in the back room), & a stage for live music (check out the board for event dates). If you like brisket, order the ""fatty"" version so you can get a moist piece since the lean meat is sorta on the dry side. The brisket pairs well with Hometown's ""Sticky"" sauce. When I saw the pastrami bacon, I was so disappointed that I didn't order a pound because I did not want to share it. It was a quarter pound of beauty. It was so juicy & flavorful that I ate it alone: no sauce, no side, just the meat. I was left wanting more. Both the brisket & the pastrami bacon had a memorable crusty bark that was well seasoned & added some sweetness to the meat, which I loved. I am not a fan of lamb but I like to explore new things so I got the lamb belly. The flavor was musky & it wasn't as gamy as I expected it to be but I added some of the ""Sweet & Spicy"" sauce to fix that. Then to end my meat journey, I ended with the Korean Sticky Ribs, which are smoked & fried. The meat is tender & glazed with sticky sauce.There are so many BBQ joints in NYC & Hometown BBQ is by far one of the best so add them to your list.",5.0
"I really wanted to like this place as it was recommended by a good friend.The menu is packed with standard Barbecue fare, we chose brisket, the Chinese sticky ribs, collard greens, potato salad and cornbread. The brisket was good, but it was a little dry, and not warm enough.The potato salad was more like a potato spread, it confused me. A simple mayo and yellow mustard based potato salad would have been great.The cornbread was topped with what I think was simple syrup before being served, making it just too sweet.The Chinese sticky ribs were great, very nice.The collard greens were perfect, just perfect.I've been cooking this type of food most of my adult life, my standards are high.What I know is that if you keep things simple the food is better.

"Suddenly, New York is a BBQ heavyweight. Thanks in large part to places like Hometown Bar-B-Que.Being in Red Hook, they have a sprawling outpost just north of the Erie Basin. But even with a huge bar, dining room, and bandstand area, this place gets packed. Like, if-you-don't-get-there-by-2:00pm-on-a-Saturday-you're-screwed sort of packed. For good reason - the BBQ'ed lamb belly itself is worth the long subway trek from the city.Besides that unique menu item (I've never seen lamb belly on a BBQ menu), they do the prerequisite brisket that's become ubiquitous around these parts. They also feature a giant beef rib that's almost a meal all by itself. Price wise, it's about what you'd expect to see at fellow charred meats juggernaut, Fette Sau. It's all sold by the pound, but beware of the sticker shock with the rib. It's $25/pound and our rib weighed close to 1.75 pounds. That equates to almost $50 tacked onto the check. I thought there was an error on the bill until we realized what was happening. Keep that in mind when your eyes become bigger than your stomach during the ordering process.From an ambiance and quality perspective, this is as close as I've come to feeling like I'm in Austin. It's the kind of place you could spend several hours at. You'll be broke from hanging for said hours, but it'll be worth it.",4.0
"So to be fair, I was deathly ill when my friends and I waited an hour+ in the longest line for BBQ I've ever see in my life. I mean DEATHLY ill. I shouldn't have been out, mama would not have been proud, and my fever/flu/cough/cold was preventing me from smelling ANYTHING. And I mean ANYTHING....which is how I suppose I lasted an hour+ waiting for food after trekking downtown and across the ferry (from East Village) on an empty stomach. My friends were dying over the smell, growing hungrier by the second and salivating with every step we took closer to the cashier. But not me, I have no idea what Hometown smells like. That's a pretty amazing feat, to be sitting in a BBQ pit for 2 hours basically and not even know it. I win. So though my nose couldn't advise, I guessed this was going to be pretty good- given the massive line that snaked all the way through one room to another in the warehouse sized space. Two bars, strong bloodies, sprawling wood tables, live music, and chicken wing samples make the wait pretty bearable, especially in good company :) I will say, if the line get this insane (can't imagine what it's like in Summer ugh) and the space is THIS huge, how is there not a 2ND CASHIER?!??? One person takes orders and money while another serves the food up... behind a counter that takes up approximately 1/1000th of the building space.... why not expand, make two lines, get things moving faster?? There is AMPLE room. Truly I'm perplexed by this. Though I definitely wasn't tasting food at full capacity, my belly knew well enough this is finger-licking goodass BBQ. The ribs, SAUCE, mac & cheese, and baked beans were a comfort to my cold, but the cornbread was just OK- lacked moistness. Mighty Quinn's has better. And speaking of Mighty Quinn's, my only complaint about Hometown is that it's quite pricy for BBQ. A $40 dinner might be normal at a restaurant (where I don't stand waiting for over an hour sipping bloddy mary's) but seems a bit high for meat and 3 sides? Pretty certain last time I ate Mighty Quinn's and got the same meal I paid $12-15 less, so not sure who's valuing the market price of beans and pasta noodles at Hometown but I think they might be overcharging on the sides a bit. Other than that, PLACE IS ACE!!",4.0

The place is indeed beautiful and spacious (especially if you're not trying to get here during prime weekend times) but the food just isn't that good. It's not necessarily ""bad"" perse but I wouldn't rate it as above average. My girlfriend and I tried the cornbread ($3/slice), lamb belly ($12/.5lb), pulled pork ($11/.5lb), siracha wings ($8/6), whiskey sour pickles ($4/sm side), and burnt end beans ($6/med side). The way it works is that you order everything you want per weight (there are minimum weight requirements depending on the meat) at the counter followed by sides, and then you pay and find a seat. They then bring you the food when it's ready. There is a full bar on the side you can order from as well.The good:-The cornbread was moist and flavorful. -The lamb belly (don't think fatty pork belly, it's basically like pulled pork with lamb meat). This was super tender and had a good flavor to it. -Service was friendly-Space is quite beautiful in an industrial kind of wayThe not so good:-The pulled pork was nearly flavorless. There was no smokey flavor to it, no seasonings, and though it was tender, it needed one of their two BBQ sauces on it to give it any real flavor. -The whiskey sour pickles weren't anything special and mind as well come from a vlassic jar. -Prices for everything was a bit steep-Beers weren't that cold-The location is not easy to get to via train/subway but wasn't an issue for me as it was a quick 2 mile bike ride. The bad:-The burnt end beans had a good amount of meat in them but not only was there no smoke flavor or real seasonings but it just tasted overwhelmingly like jarred tomato sauce. -The siracha wings were more gristly than most wings I've had and despite me not liking spicy things (the wings were for my girlfriend) I was actually able to have one of the wings without experiencing any real heat (really defeating the purpose of a siracha hot wing).Even in some of the glowing reviews of the place reviewers have been a bit disappointed with their ribs so that's why I skipped that. The banana pudding is supposedly amazing so if I ever come back for more of the lamb belly and cornbread (unlikely) I'll have to check that out. If you're in the city and want excellent BBQ check out Mighty Quinns or Dinosaur BBQ (in that order). By all means skip HomeTown if you're in the mood for classic well done BBQ.",3.0

"This place was awesome! Â The ribs were perfectly smoked and their BBQ sauce is amazing. Â Their mac & cheese had the perfect amount of cheese, cheesy but not overly cheesy. Â Their baked beans were very hearty. Â The pieces of brisket gave them a nice touch. Â The coleslaw was very fresh but I wasn't too much of a fan. Â The potato salad was creamy and tangy which was pleasantly different. Â I tasted the brisket which was great! Â The chipotle chicken also had a nice smoke flavor to it. Â The salsa verde and pickled onions on top were a great touch. Â I ordered a quarter chicken and they were considerate enough to ask if I preferred white or dark meat.What did it for me though was the sriracha hot wings. Â These wings were by far the best wings I've ever tasted. Â Hands down. Â If you're a sriracha fan (I'm obsessed) these are a must-have! Â They're crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside, right amount of spice and just overall great flavor. *Note: I tend to have a higher spice tolerance. Â The cilantro ranch sauce that came with the wings was thick and tasted homemade.Side note: I waited 45 minutes but you're able to have drinks while you wait in line which makes it more tolerable. Â The staff was very friendly and attentive. Â They have a station where they keep their plates, utensils, napkins, etc. Â It was very convenient to package your own food and go.

Look, I grew up just north of Memphis (in Baltimore) so I know good barbecue when I see it. And everything here is the best I've ever eaten. The pulled pork, pulled brisket, pulled everything earns a gold medal. The Mac and cheese was top notch, and I don't even like beans but they were probably the best I've ever had.Definitely come here if you like barbecue. If you don't like barbecue, why are you even reading this? Go away.",5.0
"When it comes to BBQ, people wouldn't shut up about this place. It felt like a trip worth taking to subway-less Red Hook, and while we enjoyed our time in the amazing space, I wouldn't be super eager to return. My party tried a variety of things: brisket, mac and cheese, collards, pulled pork, etc. and while it was all very tasty, none of it was as good as food publications or The Times boasted. Just your typical, bbq fare (and the brisket was pretty dry).Lest you think I'm a snob, the actual space of the restaurant is amazing. There's tons of room, great beer selection and a great use of light. And the cornbread? Amazing. Just not worth the trek to Valentino Pier.",3.0
"Our friends said this place had great BBQ, but they were wrong. This place has awesome BBQ.We ordered the sriracha wings (the only disappointment, but a minor one), ribs, brisket (melt in your mouth deliciousness), dill potato salad (the dill makes it), the burnt end beans (best BBQ beans ever) and the oh so good mac n cheese. Just give me a vat of the cheese sauce and I'd be happy. The service is counter service. It's a bit inefficient, but tolerable. To order drinks you have to go to thd bar.The prices are a bit high, but worth it given the quality of the food.",5.0
"Legitimately the best beans I have ever had.It's not just good Brooklyn BBQ, it's good BBQ period.Make the trek to Red Hook and check this place out. Clear your schedule for the day, though. You'll be so painfully full you won't want to do anything else afterwards.",5.0

"I like to think that as I get older, I'm learning to control my unrelenting urge to eat everything in sight. And for the most part, I am. But every once in a while, I'll end up in a situation where we've ordered entirely too much meat* that tastes entirely too good, and I'll be forced to hurt myself.Hometown is that kind of place.We ordered it all.** Brisket, pork belly tacos, pastrami bacon, pulled pork, sriracha wings (these might've actually been one of my favorite bites, oddly enough), jerk baby back ribs, mac and cheese, slaw, collards, beans...and it was good. All of it. The best though? The sticky ribs. Don't leave without putting one of these in your mouth.A few notes:1. I know the wait can be a drag, but even on a Friday night, I found it to be the perfect length of time for one drink (I'd recommend the Rocking Rye Fashioned, or a beer), and a nice guy came around and served us on line. And even if you're more of a lush than I am (unlikely), there's nothing wrong with having two before you indulge in some excellent smoked meats.2. The band that was playing rocked. I don't know who it was, but they were led by some sort of inappropriate Santa Claus that used the word ""ejaculate"" more times than my wife cared to hear as she ate.

Sure, it's one of the pricier one but I don't waste my time with chicken. The brisket was very good here. It had a little bit of fattiness that helped with the moisture. I also ordered a side of potato salad and corn bread. I thought the best part of the meal was actually the corn bread. It had a nice crisp top and a light sweetness to the taste. Potato salad was ok. Something I noticed is that if you eat there, they'll fill the side dishes a little fuller but when you order to go they can't do that since they've got to be able to cap it.

"Hometown has recently earned a reputation for being the best BBQ in the city, and it is pretty immediately obvious why. It is incredibly authentic to Texas BBQ standards, particularly Austin or Hill Country bbq markets, with lots of wood and a pervasive haze of meat smoke that fills the air. The space is pretty huge, taking up a fairly large warehouse, though there isn't as much seating as you'd expect, so be prepared for a wait. The bar is big and has a nice selection of Texas beer and some craft choices, but nothing goes better with bbq than a Shiner. The food is decadently wonderful and incredibly succulent. The sriracha wings are a must order for anyone who likes spice. They have a perfect crispness to the skin and the sriracha is perfectly glazed on, not just globbed on top after cooking. The white sauce (is it ranch, or bleu cheese, or yogurt?) is perfect with these to take out some heat as well. The wings nudged out even the amazing brisket (get the moist, not the lean) for favorite dish at our table. The brisket is clearly cooked for eons with love and attention and has an incredible ""bark"", or skin surrounding it that is packed with texture and flavor. Slather on some of the delicious ""sticky"" and hot sauces from the table too as these together create a delicious potion of flavor and heat. The jerk baby back ribs were also solid, but they didn't compare as well to the other delicious items. These had the same sauce as the wings, though weren't nearly as heat packed. The skin and seasoning was perfect on them, but I could have used a little more heat or jerk flavor. Still delicious though and I'll never get sick of tearing ribs apart with my hands like a caveman. Too bad it's so hard to get here to Red Hook for what is arguably the best bbq in New York. It isn't far from the Fairway, so the ferry is probably the best option.",4.0
"IN SHORT: When you finally decide to start exploring the limits of the city beyond Manhattan, Hometown Bar-B-Que in Red Hook should be one of the first stops. With a festive, vibrant atmosphere and a ton of meat for a carnivorous party, it is the perfect restaurant for those looking for a little adventure. But yes, it's okay if you take an Uber to get there.THE STORY: Sometimes, it can be hard to love New York. It can be hard to love the sweltering heat of the subway in the summer, the mountains of black sludgy snow in the winter, the feeling of getting hip checked by Elmo in Times Square, the claustrophobia of the dank, underground corridors of Penn Station. It can be hard to love a city where there is always someone in the room with more money or more power, where a 50-year old walk-up apartment can sell for $1,000 per square foot, and where a 1-mile cab trip can cost $20 in traffic.Yes, New York can be really hard to love. But if there is just one lovable thing to take away from the city, it is that New York has an uncanny ability to be everything to everyone all at once, and that itself is a little magical.Deep in the post-industrial neighborhood of Red Hook at Hometown Bar-B-Que, New York can be Texas, Kansas City, an old barnyard, or your grandfather's garage. Here, with barbecue that upholds the essence of that local culinary culture, New York can fulfill your Southern fantasies and satisfy your nostalgia for country, all while providing pounds of juicy, tender ribbons of meat.Indeed, led by New York-raised Bill Durney who trained with some of the great pitmasters from around the country, Hometown Bar-B-Que has created the barbecue of the city.The Beef Ribs are the unanimous star, with lightly smoked meat coated with a thick layer of dark, cracked peppercorns that falls apart under its own tender weight, though the Brisket, also cooked roughly Texas-style, is a close second. The beef brisket has a classic layer of thick ""bark,"" the crunchy, sweet, caramelized crust that seems to bind all the juices of the meat together while it is smoked. The effect of the smoke is subtle, just one flavor of the complex, beefy experience, but it marries perfectly with the house ""Sticky"" sauce, whose tomato-based Kansas City influences are evident.While the cow is the most beloved animal on the menu in this massive, 4,500 square foot space, the Jerk Chicken is also a casual success - soft, slightly spicy, and not the least bit dull. Most people won't write home about the sides, but at a recent work dinner in one of the two spacious dining rooms, the coleslaw was praised for its freshness and crunch, and the dense, moist cornbread was finished ravenously.Because of its size, Hometown Bar-B-Que has become a great place for groups, particularly large parties of 15 or more people who can be served family style with a pre-selected menu. For just an ordinary night with friends, however, regular service is at the counter through the bar and pit area. Here an American flag mural covers a large wall, string lights decorate the wood beam ceiling, and live music plays on Friday and Saturday nights for a charming and authentic effect that makes every guest from Bushwick to the Bronx feel that they are suddenly down home in New York.With such gorgeously prepared meat, Hometown Bar-B-Que would be a good restaurant even if it was in the heart of the barbecue belt. But because of the way it has occupied New York's conscious, it is now a great restaurant. It is barbecue for New York, whatever we want that to mean.It may be easy to hate New York, but Hometown Bar-B-Que will make anyone fall in love with it, if only for a night.More on onehungryblonde.com",4.0

The pulled pork sandwich was served with cole slaw on the sandwich, and you can add their sticky sweet BBQ sauce or their hot and spicy. Both are very good.

Â And, when we reached out to them, we discovered that they are also INCREDIBLE caterers. Â They took care of everything (including vegetarian options - and OMG - soo good!). Â We had never planned any event before and hadn't even thought of everything we needed. Â Hometown walked us through the whole process and made sure that everything was taken care of.

"I've been here twice and both times waited at least 45 minuets to get food. The system they have to queue people up, chop up the meats and ring them up is wildly inefficient. With that out of the way, they make some god damned good BBQ with real wood. If you sit in the front of the restaurant, you can actually smell burning wood embers smoking throughout the place. The brisket here is fat and delicious. Ribs were nice and tender with a tremendous peppery bark. The jerk ribs were gone by 7:15 pm when we got here on a Sunday.

"""Get on your bikes and ride!"" Hometown Bar-B-Que is an excellent destination for Manhattanites to plot into their weekend cycle tour of the boroughs; my friends and I rolled in, locked up our rides, and ordered just about everything on the menu between the six of us.As a longtime Mighty Quinn's brisket fan, I came ready for a fight. Can't say Hometown was able to beat the ""champ"" as I saw it, but there were those with me who had a more difficult time saying so.All that brisket business aside though, the undisputed Heavyweight Champion of Brooklyn is no doubt the Beef Rib. This behemoth cannot be ignored - the crusting on it was incredible, rich and complex, and the meat inside was more moist and juicy than the finest filet mignon.Throw a belt on this one, no one is going to dethrone him.Just for fun, get yourself a quarter pound of the Lamb Belly, too. It's different than a lot of other NYC BBQ offerings, and plays nicely with the sauce.",4.0
"Tuck away in Red Hook, this place is a gem. Space? Decor reminds me of some of the great eateries in Austin, TX with lights, wood furniture everywhere, music and happy voices all over.

Â There is also a lively bar with a nice selection on tap. Food? I loved the smoked meats and all of the delicious sides. Â Enjoyed the brisket, spare ribs, sausages, and pastrami bacon. The mac and cheese has a nice spice to it, collard greens and potato salad is on point, and the beans were eaten up by our party. Â And you must try the dessert: banana creme and chocolate pudding.

Will come again just to experience good food and great vibes.",5.0

But the good it's like a BBQ indoors. The food is really good. I had the macaroni and cheese, collard greens, cornbread, potatoe salad and chipotle chicken all costing $34 without drinks. The staff is friendly and they had a band playing in the other room. I'll definitely come back just not on a weekend.",4.0

The wait was a little agonizing- the line moved soooo slowly. 10 ppl in front of us and we waited 30 min. I was eyeing everyone else's food... growing hungrier by the minute. When it was finally our turn, we ordered ambitiously: pulled pork sandwich, 1/2 lb brisket, korean sticky ribs, pastrami bacon, pickles, and slaw. (this was for 2 ppl, don't judge because you will regret not doing the same). The korean sticky ribs and pastrami bacon were definitely interesting and definitely delicious, highly recommend trying.

"This place was advertised to me as ""the best BBQ in NYC"", a lofty claim for an establishment of any kind. Â But I had read it over and over again.

Â The space was very cool, and the sides were actually great, but the main event was nothing special in the slightest. Â I have had better brisket from many places in the city, and they didn't require 2 subways and 2 buses to get there. Â It seems that the more and more I follow the claims of ""best whatever in the city"", the more and more I find them to be....not that.

"I have never been more surprised at such glowing reviews for a restaurant I would never return to. I have so much to say about this placeSet-UpThis is one of the strangest set-ups I've ever seen. Â There is one menu displayed against the wall where you order food. Â One guy takes your meat order and then the other guy takes your ""sides"" order and then totals you up and you pay. Â I looked around to see why he didn't ask for my beverage order then realized I have to go to the bar.The BarI ordered two diet cokes. Â The bartender filled up my two glasses with 3/4 Â ice. Â When I mentioned to her ""not so much ice"", she said ""there are free refills"" however too much ice had nothing to do with me being too cheap to buy another diet coke; I just don't like a lot of ice. Â The ""bartendress"" should not have made assumptions. Â All she had to do was dump 1/2 the ice out and fill my diet cokes from the tap but instead she choose to dump the entire ice contents with attitude and force. Â (I would not want to meet up with her in an alley). Â They should have a separate station for soft drinks. Â Of course, this is just my opinion but it was a nuisance to have finally gotten your food and then have to go to a bar to get your soda. Â It wasn't busy when I went but what if it was? Does that mean my food gets cold while waiting to get my soda?The AtmosphereIt had a nice homey atmosphere with a main room where you order the food and can sit in that area go to the back room where you sit family style with long benches. Â Against the wall is comfy seating but if you sit in a chair, you have to be a child or kind of thin to be comfortable. This was my first (and last) time here but it seemed like there were little kids everywhere running around. Â Fine, I get it that this isn't a place you dress in tuxes and evening gowns but I did find all the kids annoying (and yes I know this is the result of parents not controlling their kids and not the restaurant's fault). Â  And maybe it was just my bad luck but they were playing awful music and was too loud.The FoodAll complaints could be forgiven if the food were better. Â One of us got 1/2 rack of the baby back ribs. Â She almost never complains but she said it was inedible. Â It was very fatty and tough. Â She wound up bringing it back and they were courteous and replaced it with something else. Â I had the brisket sandwich which was good but nothing spectacular (and needed help from the sauces on the table). Â  The corn bread was also good. Â The mac and cheese was flavorless, had a weird consistency and was left over; no one wanted it (did you ever hear of anyone passing up mac and cheese?). Â  Surprisingly, the best thing were the beans which were sweet and meaty with big chunks of brisket. Â The StaffThe two guys who handled the meat and sides were sweethearts and patient with all of us who were here for the first time but the bartender with an attitude kind of erased my good feelings.Last WordI guess for a neighborhood place, it's okay. When we went it was only about 6:30 but 1/2 hour later there was a long line. Â I respect that they obviously have something here that people want and are willing to put up with long lines and inconvenience. Â  I might have enjoyed some other options; the problem is there isn't a compelling reason for me to return.",2.0
"Believe the hype. I think I have a new favorite BBQ place. Usually, when I go out for BBQ (or what we call BBQ in New York), places usually excel at one thing and the rest is just okay. Not so with Hometown. They do everything well or extraordinarily well. And I should know, I went with 3 drunk friends, and we basically tried everything on the menu. Note to self: don't ever do that again.A breakdown of our meal:-Brisket: nice and fatty, with one of the thickest smoke rings I've ever seen. Moist and cut thick.-Pulled pork: good, but not great. Add some of the delicious sticky sauce to it.-Jerk baby back ribs: jerk flavor wasn't overpowering, but they were nice and smoky. Also great with the sticky sauce.-Sriracha hot wings: yum.

As fatty and as juicy as you'd expect.-Collard greens: because vegetables are healthy, right?Yes, Hometown is a bit out of the way, but it's definitely worth the journey.

"I wish I could give more than 5 stars. Â This place is AMAZING. Â Best there is. Â So great, that when my (now) husband proposed, the only thing we knew we wanted for our wedding was to have Hometown cater it. Â Because we LOVE the food. Â Believe the hype. Â And, when we reached out to them, we discovered that they are also INCREDIBLE caterers. Â They took care of everything (including vegetarian options - and OMG - soo good!). Â We had never planned any event before and hadn't even thought of everything we needed. Â Hometown walked us through the whole process and made sure that everything was taken care of. Â If there were any issues during our wedding, I had no idea, because they just took care of it all. Â I cannot say enough good things. Â GO!!!",5.0
"Ample seating. Â Live country music. Â Great food. Â Easy parking. Â What more could you ask for?Had the brisket, lamb belly, ribs, pulled pork, corn bread, tacos, wings, mac and cheese and potato salad. Â Best things were obviously all the BBQ foods and the tacos. Â The brisket, lamb belly, ribs and pulled pork were perfectly smokey and flavorful. Â Then there's the tacos. Â These were fresh and really just delicious in addition to all the BBQ. Â Sriracha wings were delicious and some were really spicy while others were not. Â Not recommended are the corn bread which was dry and the potato salad which tasted like mashed potato salad. Â Otherwise, really loved the BBQ. Â  We had 9 people and paid $160 total so expect to put out some money for medium-sized but very filling portions.",4.0
"I've been here twice and both times waited at least 45 minuets to get food. The system they have to queue people up, chop up the meats and ring them up is wildly inefficient. With that out of the way, they make some god damned good BBQ with real wood. If you sit in the front of the restaurant, you can actually smell burning wood embers smoking throughout the place. The brisket here is fat and delicious. Ribs were nice and tender with a tremendous peppery bark. The jerk ribs were gone by 7:15 pm when we got here on a Sunday. In summart: damn good food, in the middle of nowhere with a long wait.",4.0
"""Get on your bikes and ride!"" Hometown Bar-B-Que is an excellent destination for Manhattanites to plot into their weekend cycle tour of the boroughs; my friends and I rolled in, locked up our rides, and ordered just about everything on the menu between the six of us.As a longtime Mighty Quinn's brisket fan, I came ready for a fight. Can't say Hometown was able to beat the ""champ"" as I saw it, but there were those with me who had a more difficult time saying so.All that brisket business aside though, the undisputed Heavyweight Champion of Brooklyn is no doubt the Beef Rib. This behemoth cannot be ignored - the crusting on it was incredible, rich and complex, and the meat inside was more moist and juicy than the finest filet mignon.Throw a belt on this one, no one is going to dethrone him.Just for fun, get yourself a quarter pound of the Lamb Belly, too. It's different than a lot of other NYC BBQ offerings, and plays nicely with the sauce.",4.0
"Tuck away in Red Hook, this place is a gem. Space? Decor reminds me of some of the great eateries in Austin, TX with lights, wood furniture everywhere, music and happy voices all over. Â There was a live band when we went on a Saturday and it made the vibe perfect. Â The owner and the staff are the utmost hospitable folks around and made sure everyone had a good time. Â There is also a lively bar with a nice selection on tap. Food? I loved the smoked meats and all of the delicious sides. Â Enjoyed the brisket, spare ribs, sausages, and pastrami bacon. The mac and cheese has a nice spice to it, collard greens and potato salad is on point, and the beans were eaten up by our party. Â And you must try the dessert: banana creme and chocolate pudding. Â Tip: you'll have to wait in line, but there is ample seating by the time you order. Â And you can take your leftovers and they'll be just as good the next day. Will come again just to experience good food and great vibes.",5.0
"I wanted to give this place 5 stars so bad but the wait time is ridiculous. We stood online for an hour on a Sunday evening around 7. It was packed! Maybe they need to add more employees. But the good it's like a BBQ indoors. The food is really good. I had the macaroni and cheese, collard greens, cornbread, potatoe salad and chipotle chicken all costing $34 without drinks. The staff is friendly and they had a band playing in the other room. I'll definitely come back just not on a weekend.",4.0
"It was a bit of a journey to get here, if you have a car (or grab a friend with a car), I recommend driving. Looks like an oldschool barn, and has two spacious rooms with plenty of seating. The wait was a little agonizing- the line moved soooo slowly. 10 ppl in front of us and we waited 30 min. I was eyeing everyone else's food... growing hungrier by the minute. When it was finally our turn, we ordered ambitiously: pulled pork sandwich, 1/2 lb brisket, korean sticky ribs, pastrami bacon, pickles, and slaw. (this was for 2 ppl, don't judge because you will regret not doing the same). The korean sticky ribs and pastrami bacon were definitely interesting and definitely delicious, highly recommend trying. We ordered those sides specifically to cut through the heaviness/fattiness of so much meat. Love the casual country vibe, and ate so much food that I could barely walk outta there.",4.0
"This place was advertised to me as ""the best BBQ in NYC"", a lofty claim for an establishment of any kind. Â But I had read it over and over again. Â So, when my friend told me she was making the pilgrimage out to Red Hook to try it, I decided to tag along as her support system for the long journey and to try the best brisket in town myself.Womp womp wooooomp. Â Brisket was dryer than a piece of burnt toast! Â I'm sure this was just an off day, but c'mon! Â The space was very cool, and the sides were actually great, but the main event was nothing special in the slightest. Â I have had better brisket from many places in the city, and they didn't require 2 subways and 2 buses to get there. Â It seems that the more and more I follow the claims of ""best whatever in the city"", the more and more I find them to be....not that. Â Maybe I'm in the wrong here, and I hope I just went of the wrong (freezing ass cold) day. Â But, regardless, I do not see myself venturing back out to see if these guys will prove me wrong.",2.0
"I have never been more surprised at such glowing reviews for a restaurant I would never return to. I have so much to say about this placeSet-UpThis is one of the strangest set-ups I've ever seen. Â There is one menu displayed against the wall where you order food. Â One guy takes your meat order and then the other guy takes your ""sides"" order and then totals you up and you pay. Â I looked around to see why he didn't ask for my beverage order then realized I have to go to the bar.The BarI ordered two diet cokes. Â The bartender filled up my two glasses with 3/4 Â ice. Â When I mentioned to her ""not so much ice"", she said ""there are free refills"" however too much ice had nothing to do with me being too cheap to buy another diet coke; I just don't like a lot of ice. Â The ""bartendress"" should not have made assumptions. Â All she had to do was dump 1/2 the ice out and fill my diet cokes from the tap but instead she choose to dump the entire ice contents with attitude and force. Â (I would not want to meet up with her in an alley). Â They should have a separate station for soft drinks. Â Of course, this is just my opinion but it was a nuisance to have finally gotten your food and then have to go to a bar to get your soda. Â It wasn't busy when I went but what if it was? Does that mean my food gets cold while waiting to get my soda?The AtmosphereIt had a nice homey atmosphere with a main room where you order the food and can sit in that area go to the back room where you sit family style with long benches. Â Against the wall is comfy seating but if you sit in a chair, you have to be a child or kind of thin to be comfortable. This was my first (and last) time here but it seemed like there were little kids everywhere running around. Â Fine, I get it that this isn't a place you dress in tuxes and evening gowns but I did find all the kids annoying (and yes I know this is the result of parents not controlling their kids and not the restaurant's fault). Â  And maybe it was just my bad luck but they were playing awful music and was too loud.The FoodAll complaints could be forgiven if the food were better. Â One of us got 1/2 rack of the baby back ribs. Â She almost never complains but she said it was inedible. Â It was very fatty and tough. Â She wound up bringing it back and they were courteous and replaced it with something else. Â I had the brisket sandwich which was good but nothing spectacular (and needed help from the sauces on the table). Â  The corn bread was also good. Â The mac and cheese was flavorless, had a weird consistency and was left over; no one wanted it (did you ever hear of anyone passing up mac and cheese?). Â  Surprisingly, the best thing were the beans which were sweet and meaty with big chunks of brisket. Â The StaffThe two guys who handled the meat and sides were sweethearts and patient with all of us who were here for the first time but the bartender with an attitude kind of erased my good feelings.Last WordI guess for a neighborhood place, it's okay. When we went it was only about 6:30 but 1/2 hour later there was a long line. Â I respect that they obviously have something here that people want and are willing to put up with long lines and inconvenience. Â  I might have enjoyed some other options; the problem is there isn't a compelling reason for me to return.",2.0
"Believe the hype. I think I have a new favorite BBQ place. Usually, when I go out for BBQ (or what we call BBQ in New York), places usually excel at one thing and the rest is just okay. Not so with Hometown. They do everything well or extraordinarily well. And I should know, I went with 3 drunk friends, and we basically tried everything on the menu. Note to self: don't ever do that again.A breakdown of our meal:-Brisket: nice and fatty, with one of the thickest smoke rings I've ever seen. Moist and cut thick.-Pulled pork: good, but not great.

Â Almost everything outside of meat and side service is self service. Â From the utensils, to the to go containers, to ordering drinks, self self self. Â Honestly the pastrami bacon made everything worthwhile, best thing I've eaten in a while. Â Highlights: the beef rib, pastrami bacon (all bacon should be made this way), whiskey sour pickles and the cornbread. The food service and bartenders were cool.

"I've seen Hometown BBQ pop up on many ""Best of..."" lists as of late. I've been to many BBQ places in NYC, some better than others. Hometown BBQ is absolutely deserving of being on any of these lists. It's an adventure and an experience.My trip to get BBQ was also my first trip to Red Hook, so I got to take in some of the scenery of new areas of Brooklyn as the beau and I cruised down Columbia and Van Brunt Streets on the B61. The bus drops you off one block away, and the smell of smoking wood hits your nose immediately. Upon entering the lofty meat warehouse, I was pleased to see a relatively short line and tons of meat being sliced up in the far left corner. The menu provides many meaty options, from meats served by the half pound to sandwiches, wings, and tacos. Many traditionally BBQ-y sides are for sale as well, such as corn bread, collard greens, and mac & cheese. As much as I wanted a $25 piece of rib (and I'm not being facetious), the beau and I opted for sandwiches. I went the pulled pork route, while he opted for the brisket. We also split corn bread and mac & cheese.The food is just as wonderful as everyone claims it to be. The pork was so tender and melted in my mouth, and it was not bogged down by tons of sauces, truly letting the flavor of the pork and smoke come through. The brisket was delightfully tender as well, and it had a small bite to it. The mac and cheese, served with creamy queso, was so good, I had to stop myself from getting another order. (The food baby was already big enough from the sandwich.) The beau made a very lofty claim that the cornbread was some of the best he's EVER had. It was cake-like yet had that good cornmeal grain to it, along with a sweet honey-soaked top crust. After eating, we just sat there for about 15 minutes. We did not have the power to rise from our seats as our bodies did their best to start the digestion process.

"This is such an amazing place. Open seating arrangement is perfect for any size group. The smell of smoked meet is inviting. The food is freakin' delicious. The drinks are there if you wish so.

Some of the best pulled pork and brisket anywhere. I like the relaxed environment because you know the food is awesome if the seating and serving aren't the best. Worth it though. Good sides with delicious baked beans and corn bread. And the beer selection isn't bad,5.0
One of the best places for bbq in the city. Brisket is great. Spare ribs are bangin'. The lamb belly is amazing. It's all great.,5.0
I sampled the brisket here. It's pretty well cooked and moist. The outside crumbly and peppery which is awesome. I wish they could have fresh sauce make with meat juices.,4.0

"cool little hot spot. I just moved back to Brooklyn from Austin Texas. This little bbq joint is has a relaxing atmosphere and its family friendly too. The bbq here is not as good as Texas bbq but still pretty good, especially if you need a bbq fix. I really liked the macaroni and cheese and I am not a Mac and cheese person. It's so cheesy and I like the red peppers in it too. I loved the corn bread it was so good and moist. The brisket was ok and pulled pork was very good. I will came back again with my little family.

"Four visits: an absolutely spectacular place. Newly opened when first visited, the brisket and ribs are unlike any other bbq north of the mason Dixon line. We met Bill at the smoker - a giant wood fired operation inside a couple of shipping containers around the corner from the joint itself. We sniffed it out, literally. Bill explained his process while poking a couple of fatty briskets and pork shoulders.Crusted in true Texas style, heavy pepper rub with little else.The full spare ribs are nearly the size of my forearm. Crusty and exploding with juices. Specked with pepper flakes and salt chunks. Pink almost all the way to the bone. The meat tears away easily from the bone. The fat is rendered into the meat and the cartiledge is almost melted away.Lamb bahn mi - crusty baguette - juicy lamb belly. Smoke flavoring throughout. Bark mixed well with the tender meat. Pickled onions, carrots and cilantro make it Vietnamese.Pulled pork tacos: juicy and firm. Served with pickled onions, cilantro, jalapeÃ±os, and a cream drizzle. Absolutely perfect. A thick but soft taco wraps the whole thing together. Chipotle baby backs were thick, meaty and trimmed to a nice fat level. Crusty and flavorful, almost sweet with a salty rub. Pink goes all the way through. Honey butter corn bread is moist and sweet. The best I've ever had and better with the honey butter spooned on top.Brisket is almost slurp worthy. Full of beef flavor with a crisp, succulent crust of black pepper chunks. Smoke wafts from the juicy meat. To use a cliche, the meat cuts like butter with a fork. Beef ribs (dinosaur bone) are prepared similarly to the brisket with heavy pepper rub. Juices flow easily down the meat into a pool. This is a bone worth searching out: it is smoked to juice like texture. Fat and beef fibers mix interchangeably together.Sausage is snappy and explosively juicy. Slightly spicy.The chicken wings are the only weak link - smoked but small and a little dry.Slightly pricey but the best bbq in NYC.",5.0
Best BBQ I've had in a very long time. This place makes the best BBQ beef ribs that I've had in New York. This place also does mostly dry rubs which I prefer because I don't like getting messy. Some dishes have a wet rub like the siracha wings which is nice if you wanna get messy. Â Mac and cheese is pretty good. The cornbread is great. The potato salad is a little weird because it's mashed potatoes but tastes exactly like potato salad. I'd definitely come here again and this place easily becomes my #1 spot for BBQ in New York.,5.0
"All I can say is that visiting hometown today changed my life. I never knew what brisket was til today..... What in the hell was I waiting so long for.????

"A bit overrated.The meats were quite good - the brisket, the pastrami bacon, and the pulled pork. Â The jerk ribs, however, were inconsistent even across the half-rack and were fine, but nothing to write home about.The sides were rather disappointing. Â The potato salad had too much vinegar, the collard greens were rather flavorless other than having too much heat to them. Â The beans were the highlight from among the sides, but were on par with what they should have been...nothing special.Live music started a bit too late, but the band was good. Â Of course, getting a table in the room in which the music was being played was quite a feat.The ridiculous and bothersome aspects of this restaurant are as follow:1. Â The line on a Saturday evening (not even prime time) wraps around the place and will easily take an hour to navigate. Â The limited staff do nothing to aid with coordinating seating, don't do anything to move the process along or make sure that anyone is comfortable whatsoever. Â Also, while you may agree that it feels wrong to lock up a table for the hour that you'll be in line, you really need to do so, otherwise you'll have bought your food and spend a long time waiting for a table to free up, by which time your food will likely be cold.2. Â The prices are a bit high across the board for what you're getting. Â I get that this is a hot-spot for the time being, but you would think it was conveniently located in a prime area of Manhattan the way they charge. Â The sides are actually quite a ripoff. Â I also think that there is something wrong with a place that doesn't show you the ultimate weight of the food you ordered and just presents you with a dollar amount at the end. Â I am accustomed to either seeing the scale weight register in a place visible to the customer or getting an itemized receipt. Â It generates an uncomfortable feeling. Â Their business model is great, in theory, because they have a skeletal staff that is not available to you for anything that you'd find in a customary restaurant.3. Â I find it odd that a BBQ place does not give you slices of white bread with which to make a sandwich, mop up sauces, etc. Â Pretty hard to understand, since that's always been a part of the offerings at BBQ restaurants near and far. Â Given the pricing and general attitude toward the customer, the experience, and the value, it is probably the nominal cost of ""free"" white bread that is a factor here, but I highly recommend that the owners revisit the subject and consider a change in policy.All in all, I enjoyed most of the food, but the experience was lacking. Â I am unlikely to return to Hometown and, judging from the way we were handled, Hometown is riding too high on its buzz and that of Red Hook overall to care.

"Seriously delicious, seriously pricey, but seriously worth it. Since first trying Hometown back in April, I have since been back on a monthly basis. It's just about whenever I get a hankering for some BBQ, Hometown has quickly become my go to spot. I like the vibe inside, there's always parking outside and the food is right.The last time I was here it was Fathers Day. And let me tell you what a shit show Fathers Day was in a neighborhood that is stroller central. There was a line wrapping around the room out the door! If you've ever been to Hometown, you know that room is big too, so that line was really freaking long!I waited on that line for about an hour. We grabbed drinks, chatted with other guests and waited very patiently. Right when we got to the counter, the man ahead of us ordered the very last of the lamb belly and I was visibly upset. But the counter guy cut me off a little sliver to taste. It was delicious and super nice of him.As always, the beef ribs are amazing. Two people can share one because they are HUGE! I also love the pulled pork. The brisket is good, but there is better brisket out there (looking at you Fette Sau!) As for sides, the cornbread is some of the best I've ever had. For $3 a piece, it is expensive, but SO GOOD still. And the Mac and cheese with queso topping is delicious. The counter guys are so cool, they'll layer the queso topping for you.Service and food are top notch here! Prices are steep, but I'm still coming back. My wallets not mad and neither is my tummy. :)",4.0

Took the free ikea ferry from manhattan and came across this wonderful location! My bf and I were gonna visit Brooklyn crab but since the delay was too long we're so happy we came here. Baby back ribs were amazing! The dark meat chicken was a bit raw but the ribs were great as well as the relaxed vibe Is relaxing after a pleasant day working on oyster reef restoration on Governor's island. Would be amazing when they are able to get a ferry which goes from gov isle to redhook. At 7 pm on a Friday we got food as well as a seat and no probs - cant wait to return in the wintertime and listen to the bluegrass concerts,4.0
"So I got a Pork Rib, Beef Rib, a slice of the moist version of the Brisket, and the Cornbread. The total of the bill was $55. Ouch. Main culprit was obviously the Beef rib, so let's talk about that first:Beef rib - Moist, lots of bark (I usually don't mind bark but this was a bit much), not particularly special, just decent. Definitely not worth the space on my tray nor the hole in my wallet. Pork rib - Only one word can describe this: Dank. It was moist, tender, juicy, you name it. Add either (or both) of their amazing sauces and you can go to town on this baby.Brisket - Pretty good. The moist version was solid. Didn't try the lean because what's the point?Cornbread - Really good. I've had some crappy corn breads in my life time and this is not one of them. Solid side. I heeded the advice of others and didn't get any other sides.Sauces - The Original BBQ was really good, so was the hot version. No complaints here. Â I would come back here next time I go to ikea, just for the brisket/pork rib/cornbread/sauces. Solid 4 outta 5. This ain't Texas cowboy, you can't have too high of standards.",4.0

Definitely not worth the space on my tray nor the hole in my wallet. Pork rib - Only one word can describe this: Dank. It was moist, tender, juicy, you name it. Add either (or both) of their amazing sauces and you can go to town on this baby.Brisket - Pretty good. The moist version was solid. Didn't try the lean because what's the point?Cornbread - Really good. I've had some crappy corn breads in my life time and this is not one of them. Solid side. I heeded the advice of others and didn't get any other sides.Sauces - The Original BBQ was really good, so was the hot version. No complaints here. Â I would come back here next time I go to ikea, just for the brisket/pork rib/cornbread/sauces. Solid 4 outta 5. This ain't Texas cowboy, you can't have too high of standards.",4.0
"Beef rib on a bone as big as my forearm (THE BESTEST)!! Spicy sriracha wings topped with a wonderful heavy hand of cilantro paired with a delicate creamy cheesey dip. Sticky ribs. Mac and cheese, with velvetta cheese no doubt. Tangy coleslaw. And health it up with a side of collard greens. Beers on tap. Live music. A projector. The American flag boldly painted on a red brick wall. And stacks of wood waiting to be tickled with fiery flames! Picnic tables encourage large groups and sharing. I think this just may be the best bbq in NYC. The only thing I could've done to top it off was wear a plaid shirt! The only con is that this place is pretty far from the subway. We were so far away that even Uber couldn't get us. But I'm going to make the trek and get back here again someday. I promise!",5.0
"Absolutely delicious. Â In my opinion, it's the best BBQ in NYC.

Â The total for the food only was a whopping $104 for two people. And while we did take home two spare and two jerk ribs, we polished off the rest.

"Never refusing a chance to eat BBQ, some close friends from NYC called me and wanted to meet for dinner.

Â Really? Â It was only 7:50PM, the restaurant was only 40% full, and I would think they would have stock for the dinner crowd.

Â Overall I think the brisket may have been sitting a little long in the heating tray.- The pork belly was served pulled which was fine, but I prefer the Fette Sau style of sliced pork belly where you can see the nice gradient of bark, fat, and meat.- The Jerk baby back ribs were disappointing. Â The jerk and smoke flavor were very muted jerk and just didn't assert itself.- Side dishes I found to be very tasty, as I really liked the potato salad with it's nice tangy vinegar seasoning and creamy mac & cheese (which I believe uses a nice subtle white cheddar).At the end of the meal we all agreed Fette Sau, while being a little more expensive, was clearly better tasting BBQ all around.I think Hometown BBQ would be a great food experience for those who have yet to try real BBQ (real slow wood smoked style meat), but having tried several BBQ restaurants both locally and in Texas; Hometown BBQ ranks just OK in my BBQ book.",3.0
"The day nearly started in disaster! Â We made the trek from NJ to Redhook, only to find the restaurant closed due to an unforeseen power outage... Â Ryan, the head man for the day, assured us that the problem was being worked on, but that without power they could not serve us due to potential health code violations. Â However, sure enough, public works were on the scene taking care of the problem. Â It was a beautiful day, so we opted to wait. Â About 20 minutes later, I'm glad we did.We were the only ones to hang around initially, so we were the first up to be served upon the day's opening--being that it's cafeteria style, first come, first serve. Â Seating was clearly not a problem. Â So much delicious BBQ!!! Â Meats:Beef Rib: Seasoned with only salt and course pepper, the top quality meat shines on it's own. Â Far and away the highlight, this is beef ribs being done right. Â The pepper crust makes for a spectacular bark. Â The meat was moist and delicious, properly rendered, with just the right consistency and pull from the bone. Â It cuts perfectly with a plastic knife. Â While all of the BBQ was quite good, this beef rib is reason enough to come here.Spare Rib: Moist, meaty and delicious, these large ribs are on the money. Â Once again, only a simple salt and pepper rub is used, allowing the meat to shine on its own. Â I appreciate the simplicity, but I'll admit I used just a touch of the sweet BBQ sauce as I like the balance it gives to the natural sweet pork flavor.Brisket: Seasoned much like the beef rib, making for a nice salt/pepper crust. Â The fat is rendered perfectly, leaving moist, delicious and tender meat with a phenomenal bark. Â He sliced us a version incorporating parts from both the point and flat--best of both worlds, Â A little bit of excess fat for sure, but hey, that's brisket! Â Just a top notch version.Pork Belly: A very good version. Â Not quite on the level of Fette Sau which may be the best version I've sampled, but definitely on the level. Â This version was chopped, giving it more Â similarities with pulled pork, than giving it its own identity. Â I'm not sure it justifies the price difference vs. the pulled pork.Lamb Belly: Â A very interesting option. Â Liked it, but didn't love it. Â However, for this order, it offered a perfect counter flavor to the other meats. Â A little gamey, with that distinct lamb flavor, it definitely stood out. Â If I only had this, I would have said the restaurant was pretty good, but it simply wasn't my favorite--and I truly enjoy lamb. Â There wasn't anything wrong with it, but the flavor was a little too much for me personally. Â Sides:Burnt End Baked Beans: Wow! Â A unique version. Â The way this was seasoned reminded me of a chilli base--not too spicy, but with that flavor profile, in a tomato base. Â Nice texture to the beans, with a generous portion of burnt ends.Collared Greens: Decent version. Â Not over the top with the vinegar which I appreciate, with just a touch of some tasty pulled pork in the mix. Â Not sure why, but I'd have appreciated a touch more bitterness to them.Whiskey Sour Pickles: Â Simply not my thing. Â Way too sour for me, but this is a matter of personal preference. Â I prefer a pickle with just a touch of vinegar that's just past being a cucumber.Corn Bread: Â Nice consistency, with a sweet glaze on the outside without being too sweet on the inside. Â I'd have preferred a bit of corn chunks on the inside for flavor and texture. Â A decent sized portion for the $3.The staff was very nice. Â Many went out of their way to ask us how we were enjoying our meal.The establishment was clean--I would hope so considering they had just opened for the day!Parking is a little tough.

Some places have good meats, some have good sides, but Hometown is fantastic for both. Best collards and cornbread I have ever had. Sure people can boast about their fav place back home, down South blah blah blah - go write reviews for those spots and shutup.

"Took my friend here on a random Thursday,showing him a bit of where I am from and decided we should check this place out. When I asked him how he would rate this place, he said 9/10 he was so happy with the food and the experience. He thinks he is a BBQ connoisseur !! We had the jalepeno sausage, and the tacos as our meats. We also had the cole slaw, beans and corn bread. He had a smutty nose beer and I had a diet coke :) still on the booze free lifestyle! Unfortunately they were out of the collard greens and the key lime pie... Key lime is my favorite!!! That's okay, I didn't need the empty calories! Our meal came out to be just under 36 dollars not including the drinkies! You go up to the counter to order, and the line goes to the left! One gentleman takes your meat order and the other takes your sides.. If you order the tacos they bring them over to your table. The beans had bits or chunks of meat in them and they were delicious!!! The coleslaw was very average, but it's coleslaw what do I expect ! The cornbread was tasty and moist it was really flavorful and definitely didn't taste as though it was from a box!I will totally be coming back, loved the relaxed atmosphere here!",5.0
"Went here yesterday after an event nearby as they were open late. Â Ordered the brisket, collard greens, and Sriracha wings. Â Brisket was flavorful and moist. Â It went well with with either the sticky sauce or the sweet and spicy sauce (tastes like a sweeter version of Sriracha, but the spiciness, does not linger). Â Collard greens were also cooked well as it had a good balance of collard green flavor and pork flavor. Â Sriracha wings were one of the best I've had. Â They had a thin crispy layer of Sriracha covering the wing itself that was not dry. Â Meat was tender. Â It had the same level of spiciness as the sauce itself as the spice lingers after you finish eating. Â Service was average. Â You order and bring the food to your table. Â Items that take longer are brought to you. Â It is slightly expensive, but well worth it.",5.0
"Wowwie wow wow. Â Sooo yummy! Â Such juicy well seasoned pulled pork.

Â But that's not necessarily a bad thing, lol. Â Mac and cheese was delicious, but didn't need the extra heaping of ""queso"" sauce, a little overkill. Â Cornbread was a little dry for my taste, potato salad and slaw weren't great, and heard bad things about the collard greens. Â Great addition to the hip little neighborhood of Red Hook where some of my family has lived for decades. Â Need great places like this to keep on coming - and looking like they will! Â Thank goodness we got there in the nick of time: five minutes after we ordered there was a slow moving line going out the door.",4.0

"Okay, so I did not know there was a lot of hype around this restaurant but I can understand now. I had to wait in like for a little over an hour but I didn't mind. Time seemed to pass quickly while my friends and I contemplated on what we were going to eat. We decided to order the cornbread, slaw, pulled pork, beef ribs, and the beef brisket. I was disappointed by the pulled pork because it didn't have the sweet flavor to it like other placed. It was just bland. However, the beef rib and beef brisket made up for it. The meat on the ribs just fall right off and it is so juicy. The meat of the brisket is also very tender and not dry. The slaw helped with the digestion of the meat. I also liked that there were many beer options at the bar. I would definitely come back here when I am craving barbecue. There are still so many things to try on the menu. My recommendation is if you don't want to wait, try to come for early dinner or late late dinner because it is packed during peak dinner hours.",4.0
"I honestly don't remember the last time I was here, maybe over the summer? BUT I do remember the beef ribs were so good! The line was ridiculous, an hour+, but I'm pretty sure we consumed everything in less time than that. Ordered a bunch of things: beef ribs, brisket, sausage, cole slaw and beans. I regret not getting the cornbread though, what was I thinking?! Anyway, I absolutely loved the beef ribs, texture and flavor. Must try! My sister actually preferred the brisket more, but I felt it was just a tad dry, still good though! Cole slaw, yum! Beans, yum! Sausage, eh (nothing special). Their bbq is great and I think it's great to have a joint like this in Brooklyn. It can get on the pricey side, not an option to come often as it would put a dent in my wallet! Inside is spacious and casual, great amount of sunlight let in, don't know how winter will go down though. The location is definitely out of the way and unless you live nearby, you most likely have to drive. Parking isn't easy, but not impossible. On the bright side, after eating all that delicious bbq, there's a Fairway steps away, so walk it off with some grocery shopping!",4.0
"Being partial to Texas BBQ, I use caution when going to a BBQ spot outside of Texas, especially Austin, TX. Believe me, I found Hometown BBQ to be quite awesome and it most certainly got my approval. I felt quite at home with the rustic dÃ©cor and the full bar was an added plus. Before ordering, I had a couple of gin and tonic to clear the ol' palate. I ordered lamb belly, pork spare ribs, brisket (lean and moist), collard greens and Texas style queso mac and cheese. The meats were well seasoned and smoked to perfection. The collard greens with house cured bacon and the mac and cheese were absolutely awesome. By the time I got to the counter to order, the housemade jalapeÃ±o cheddar sausages were sold out. My fellow foodies had ordered a couple of items that I was able to sample. Smoked pit beans with brisket burnt ends, baby back pork ribs and pastrami bacon. The pit beans were magnificent!! The baby back ribs were very although I prefer the regular pork spare ribs. The pastrami bacon was different and didn't have me singing songs of praises. I will definitely be back on my next visit to the Big Apple as I want to try the Â housemade jalapeÃ±o cheddar sausages plus the jerk chicken which I missed seeing on the menu.",5.0

"THE BEST BBQ!! Da brisket is astounding. Can't even think about it without getting hungry. I crave it now as I write. All the sides are great. Some places have good meats, some have good sides, but Hometown is fantastic for both. Best collards and cornbread I have ever had. Sure people can boast about their fav place back home, down South blah blah blah - go write reviews for those spots and shutup. If you live in or are visiting NYC or the NorthEast you will not find better! Great space, live music, Jill is the greatest bartender on Earth and thank you Hometown!!",5.0
"Took my friend here on a random Thursday,showing him a bit of where I am from and decided we should check this place out. When I asked him how he would rate this place, he said 9/10 he was so happy with the food and the experience. He thinks he is a BBQ connoisseur !! We had the jalepeno sausage, and the tacos as our meats. We also had the cole slaw, beans and corn bread. He had a smutty nose beer and I had a diet coke :) still on the booze free lifestyle! Unfortunately they were out of the collard greens and the key lime pie... Key lime is my favorite!!! That's okay, I didn't need the empty calories! Our meal came out to be just under 36 dollars not including the drinkies! You go up to the counter to order, and the line goes to the left! One gentleman takes your meat order and the other takes your sides.. If you order the tacos they bring them over to your table. The beans had bits or chunks of meat in them and they were delicious!!! The coleslaw was very average, but it's coleslaw what do I expect ! The cornbread was tasty and moist it was really flavorful and definitely didn't taste as though it was from a box!I will totally be coming back, loved the relaxed atmosphere here!",5.0
"Went here yesterday after an event nearby as they were open late. Â Ordered the brisket, collard greens, and Sriracha wings. Â Brisket was flavorful and moist. Â It went well with with either the sticky sauce or the sweet and spicy sauce (tastes like a sweeter version of Sriracha, but the spiciness, does not linger). Â Collard greens were also cooked well as it had a good balance of collard green flavor and pork flavor. Â Sriracha wings were one of the best I've had. Â They had a thin crispy layer of Sriracha covering the wing itself that was not dry. Â Meat was tender. Â It had the same level of spiciness as the sauce itself as the spice lingers after you finish eating. Â Service was average. Â You order and bring the food to your table. Â Items that take longer are brought to you. Â It is slightly expensive, but well worth it.",5.0
"Wowwie wow wow. Â Sooo yummy! Â Such juicy well seasoned pulled pork. Â Smoked pit beans with crispy brisket ends were maybe the best thing I'd had as a side dish in a while, until I ate the whole small side and my mouth was unexpectedly on fire! Â But that's not necessarily a bad thing, lol. Â Mac and cheese was delicious, but didn't need the extra heaping of ""queso"" sauce, a little overkill. Â Cornbread was a little dry for my taste, potato salad and slaw weren't great, and heard bad things about the collard greens. Â Great addition to the hip little neighborhood of Red Hook where some of my family has lived for decades. Â Need great places like this to keep on coming - and looking like they will! Â Thank goodness we got there in the nick of time: five minutes after we ordered there was a slow moving line going out the door.",4.0
"How can you be a rib joint and run out of ribs??!!We came at 4:30 p.m. on a Friday. Food spicy, just spicy for no reason. Ordering was fairly easy. No personality from counter people.",2.0
"Okay, so I did not know there was a lot of hype around this restaurant but I can understand now. I had to wait in like for a little over an hour but I didn't mind. Time seemed to pass quickly while my friends and I contemplated on what we were going to eat. We decided to order the cornbread, slaw, pulled pork, beef ribs, and the beef brisket. I was disappointed by the pulled pork because it didn't have the sweet flavor to it like other placed. It was just bland. However, the beef rib and beef brisket made up for it. The meat on the ribs just fall right off and it is so juicy. The meat of the brisket is also very tender and not dry. The slaw helped with the digestion of the meat. I also liked that there were many beer options at the bar. I would definitely come back here when I am craving barbecue. There are still so many things to try on the menu. My recommendation is if you don't want to wait, try to come for early dinner or late late dinner because it is packed during peak dinner hours.",4.0
"I honestly don't remember the last time I was here, maybe over the summer? BUT I do remember the beef ribs were so good! The line was ridiculous, an hour+, but I'm pretty sure we consumed everything in less time than that. Ordered a bunch of things: beef ribs, brisket, sausage, cole slaw and beans. I regret not getting the cornbread though, what was I thinking?! Anyway, I absolutely loved the beef ribs, texture and flavor. Must try! My sister actually preferred the brisket more, but I felt it was just a tad dry, still good though! Cole slaw, yum! Beans, yum! Sausage, eh (nothing special). Their bbq is great and I think it's great to have a joint like this in Brooklyn. It can get on the pricey side, not an option to come often as it would put a dent in my wallet! Inside is spacious and casual, great amount of sunlight let in, don't know how winter will go down though. The location is definitely out of the way and unless you live nearby, you most likely have to drive. Parking isn't easy, but not impossible. On the bright side, after eating all that delicious bbq, there's a Fairway steps away, so walk it off with some grocery shopping!",4.0
"Being partial to Texas BBQ, I use caution when going to a BBQ spot outside of Texas, especially Austin, TX. Believe me, I found Hometown BBQ to be quite awesome and it most certainly got my approval. I felt quite at home with the rustic dÃ©cor and the full bar was an added plus. Before ordering, I had a couple of gin and tonic to clear the ol' palate. I ordered lamb belly, pork spare ribs, brisket (lean and moist), collard greens and Texas style queso mac and cheese. The meats were well seasoned and smoked to perfection. The collard greens with house cured bacon and the mac and cheese were absolutely awesome. By the time I got to the counter to order, the housemade jalapeÃ±o cheddar sausages were sold out. My fellow foodies had ordered a couple of items that I was able to sample. Smoked pit beans with brisket burnt ends, baby back pork ribs and pastrami bacon. The pit beans were magnificent!! The baby back ribs were very although I prefer the regular pork spare ribs. The pastrami bacon was different and didn't have me singing songs of praises. I will definitely be back on my next visit to the Big Apple as I want to try the Â housemade jalapeÃ±o cheddar sausages plus the jerk chicken which I missed seeing on the menu.",5.0

Beef rib: Be ready to spend some money because these are beasts and cost way more than you're going to expect. $40+ but it fed 6 of us and we had some left over. Best beef rib I've ever had. Juicy and tender. Just perfect. Queso mac and cheese: I saw pictures and wasn't expecting much but it was decedent and just awesome. Cornbread: Moist with a crispy exterior. Burnt ends and beans: My favorite of the sides. Delicious and smokey and the beans were sturdy and held up against the smoke and sauce. Potato salad: I honestly didn't enjoy this one bit. It was unrecognizable. No chunks of potatoes rather just mashed up oniony mess. Pass.Banana pudding: Heaven in a cup. Obsessed. Crispy nilla wafers with creamy pudding and thick whipped cream.

For as long as I've known my father-in-law he's been talking about wanting to come here and after eating here, I understand why.We arrived early and I suggest anyone wanting to try everything, do the same. They run out pretty quickly and the place was consistently packed. We tried so many things so here's the rundown:Brisket: Tender, perfectly fatty, and juicy. Lamb belly: Epic. Pork belly, take a seat, there's a new reigning belly champ and it's lamb. Heaven. Cheddar and jalapeÃ±o sausage: Just devine. Cheesy and not too spicy. Beef rib: Be ready to spend some money because these are beasts and cost way more than you're going to expect. $40+ but it fed 6 of us and we had some left over. Best beef rib I've ever had. Juicy and tender. Just perfect. Queso mac and cheese: I saw pictures and wasn't expecting much but it was decedent and just awesome. Cornbread: Moist with a crispy exterior. Burnt ends and beans: My favorite of the sides. Delicious and smokey and the beans were sturdy and held up against the smoke and sauce. Potato salad: I honestly didn't enjoy this one bit. It was unrecognizable. No chunks of potatoes rather just mashed up oniony mess. Pass.Banana pudding: Heaven in a cup. Obsessed. Crispy nilla wafers with creamy pudding and thick whipped cream. Obviously it was delicious. I intend to come back and take on a beef rib all by my lonesome.",5.0
"2 words: banana pudding!!!!What!!!!Awesome space, great food, good lemonade. Good for groups.",5.0
"Best brisket in New York. Moist, tender and all the other pseudo sexual adjectives. Ribs were tasty if a bit tough. Lamb belly--something I've never seen on a BBQ menu--was decent. Had that gamey taste that was more like mutton than lamb. Well worth the trip.",4.0
"Both food & atmosphere are great. Menu highlights: Korean sticky ribs, Pork tacos, Brisket, Queso mac & cheese. Awesome!",4.0
"Tends to be pricey and you dont get a lot for your money, but it is filling and true smoked. Â We had a sampler of lamb belly, brisket, chicken, pulled pork and corn bread as well as the mac and cheese. Â 90$. Â I can think of other local joints including my back yard where i can get better. Did like the lamb though , you cant get that everywhere. Â Big place i didnt see any waiters. Â Can imagine waiting a long time for food later in the evening. Â We showed up at 5 it was empty. Â Dont think i'll be back though. Â Just a little too hipster for me.",3.0
i can not even begin to explain the great tasting pulled pork i just had. i will be back before the week is over just to eat it again. OMG OMG. first off its in Red Hook which is such a cute little area. the place is open huge and spacious great lighting i can't ask for more. I was lost when i first got in but i quickly saw it was very simple alcohol to the right.. food to the left. I was acknowledged as soon as i went up to order. the man preparing my sandwich and the lady taking my money were both very friendly and nice. after ordering i sat down waited about 5 minutes and then the best thing in my life happened i ate by far the best pulled pork sandwich i have had in my life I'm 33 yrs old and a huge pork lover. I have been to other bbq places in nyc and so far this is the best. I'm so happy and excited to have found this place... and it opens at 12 so i can totally go there on my days off with friends and just enjoy a great meal.. the area is so cute too so its great for a date and being alone Again i can't stop thinking about that sandwich and what it did to me. I will be back for another sandwich and ill be trying something amazing.,5.0
"I'm in LOVE with the 'Que!! Hometown BBQ came on my foodie grid map since the Big Apple BBQ, Summer of 2014 and I solely ventured out today in the rain to sample their brontosaurus beef rib. But once I saw the menu, how could you go here and not order everything? Well, as a party of ONE--don't judge me--I practically did. I ordered the beef rib, half a rack of the jerk baby back ribs and the pastrami bacon (the switched from the pork belly which is seasonal) with a side of their Texas-style Queso mac and cheese. The beef rib was a little fatty yet perfectly seasoned. If you don't like black pepper, avoid this but it's oh so worth every pull of the bone. The jerk ribs were tender and the pastrami bacon was different good too. Â I LOVED everything I sampled and would reorder agin. I couldn't eat it all so needless to say I have a week's (or two days) worth of food to finish polishing off.",5.0
"The BBQ here is legit!! My go-to options are brisket (best in NY) and the dry-rub spare ribs. Both are so tender and full of flavor. The sauces are delicious but I barely use them cause the meat is so good on its own. Side options are okay. Coleslaw is good, mac and cheese is okay (liquid queso), and corn bread is hit or miss.Service is cafeteria style. Lines for food can get pretty long but the bar is always quick. Tons of tables, great for big groups.There are bunch of big screen TVs that are good for sports and the back room has a stage so check their calendar for live bands.",4.0
"Ok full disclosure, I have met the owner of this place and I have tremendous respect for him and what he is doing for NYC BBQ.We were in NYC to cook at the Big Apple Block Party and I have always wanted to try this place out. We made the trek to Red Hook and lets just say we blew up the menu.We ate Brisket, Beef Ribs, Jamaican Ribs, Korean Ribs, Tacos, Mac and Cheese, Potato salad, and pretty much anything they sent our way.First the brisket, it was very good Texas style brisket and despite being later in the day still moist with mostly salt and pepper being the flavour with the beef. Beef Ribs, oh I how I adore thee. I have been a late bloomer to the beef rib thing most likely because as a child I had some and really did not like them. Turns out I do like them A LOT! THese have some voodoo magic that makes them like the best brisket and the best prime rib got together for a magical night and produced the flavours of the gods. Smokey, Salty, peppery, and above all BEEFY. Tender and moist thee are must have for your visit. If you don't like beef ribs order some and then send them to me, I'll eat your share.The Jamaican ribs had good jerk flavour, I found they were my least favourite but that does not mean I did not like them because I did. They had good spice and were tender and moist.Next up Asian Spare Ribs, OK these I like very much. So much I commented to the owner that I would murder someone I actually liked to get them, The flavours were perfectly balanced. You had the sweet, sour, spices and pork. And they all sang together in a chorus of angelic meatiness that I'm pretty sure someone made a deal with the devil to develop.The tacos were straight ahead pork and brisket tacos but everything was fresh and bright and were the perfect size.THe Mac and cheese is unique because it is noodles and queso which is very creamy and has some kick not hot just kick.The potato salad is like potato salad and mashed potatoes had a crash up as my 5 year old would say. It has a nice smooth texture but with the salad flavours.To sum up, I know Brooklyn is the new darling of NYC food and this place is no different but you pluck this out of NYC and put it in the south or Texas and it would be just as successful.go here, now, really go!",5.0
"After several more visits, Hometown hits the mark. Brisket is great; a bit lean. Lamb belly was underwhelming, extremely fatty (obviously) but not my cup of tea. Sides are delicious. Atmosphere is homey. Definitely a go-to spot in the Hook. One of the best 'Q joints in town.",4.0
"Yesterday was probably my fifth time or so to hometown. Every time its the same. Great flavorful food. Great ambiance and vibe. Bar is great, I like that beers are served in jars now, it's the little things that always matter! The brisket sandwich now has pickles and onions in it which in my opinion make it 10x better. The mac and cheese delicious as always. They even had the Seahawks/Panthers game which even though at the time seemed like a blowout added to the vibe of the bar/dining area. The owner (i presume he is the owner) even came up to a buddy and me asking if we were OK or needing anything else, I was battling a food coma so i was speechless to respond.

"I agree with a fellow reviewer in that the worst part of coming to Hometown BBQ is waiting in what can be quite a lengthy line. That and the large picnic tables where you have to try your luck at finding a seat make the experience, to me, only 4 stars instead of 5.Away from those two things, this place serves phenomenal food. The casual atmosphere, the extensive beer options at the bar (and likely bourbon, too, but I'm a BBQ and beer kind of person) and a user friendly self serve water/plate/silverware station make it an easy choice when in the mood for BBQ. When I ate here recently, for a belated birthday dinner, I was happily impressed with the variety of meats on offer as well as some interesting combinations (pork belly tacos!).We were a party of 4 and waited for about 25 minutes on a late Saturday afternoon/early evening in line to order our food. We managed to secure the end of one long picnic table just before ordering (a miracle) and had: beef brisket, beef rib (which looks like something out of the Flinstones it is so huge), pork belly, lamb belly and pork belly tacos. We also shared some collard greens and cornbread.The brisket was the best I have had city wide, I think. The pork belly was tremendous. The lamb belly we were served was more skin than meat therefore I don't feel like I can honestly comment on it. The pork tacos were really a treat, 3 served in an order with jalapenos on the side. The home run was the beef rib. I tend to be a pork rib girl, but my friend who had eaten here before said we had to do the beef rib because it was so amazing. It is - she didn't steer us wrong. It was devoured. We even had one of the group try to pick it up to gnaw off of which is quite a feat given its giant nature. The meat practically fell off the bone and was succulent beyond what I could imagine. The collards were good and the cornbread a solid 8 out of 10. All in all, if you can handle the wait for a seat and for the food (which is served by the lb) and manage to drag yourself to Red Hook (IKEA!), I would recommend this joint for some tasty, finger-liking BBQ.",4.0
Great food. Wished there was more seats. The sauces that they had were awesome. Would definitely give this place a try if you haven't.,4.0
Best bbq food I've ever had. I can believe how good the Mac and cheese is. It's spicey and cheesey but delicious at the same time. The collard greens are fantastic. I always go with the pulled pork over the brisket but I've tasted the brisket and all I have to say is WOW! Definitely give this place a chance!,5.0
"I've been to Hometown probably 6 times. Same staff I've noticed, and every time it does not disappoint. Everytime my sister's friends in town we go here, and they will only go right at opening time. I thought they were exaggerating about the line because when we went early it was kinda empty. Then I came a few nights on a Saturday and realized how insane the line can get. You will find yourself surrounded by lots of people and waiting for a while, but the food is worth it! They also were super courteous about people in line with the bartenders bringing you drinks while you wait, as well as food samples sometimes! Prices can add up so if trying to save, I recommend thinking about sizes when sharing so you don't go too crazy.Here's why I finally decided to write a review. Last weekend my boyfriend's family was in town from Fl. They aren't used to long lines and crowds so I was a bit worried they would be overwhelmed when we walked into a line that almost went out the building. Also, out of courtesy to not hold a table for 45mins when we didn't have food yet (SO many groups were doing this, and someone could eat in that time!) we waited till closer to the end to try and find a table. Didn't have luck. They we were, with our trays trying to find seating for 4 with other groups hovering over tables. While thinking we would have to take it to go, a gentlemen in the back table got up with his group and offered up his seats. Come to find out he was the owner/pitmaster (his arm was in a sling). He kept coming by to check on us and asked if we wanted to try anything. Even offered to make us drinks while we waited for the bartender. Awesome hospitality that you don't see much these days. Thank you for making their evening so comfortable!Anyways - the things I have tried;+Brisket - so tender and delicious!! +Turkey - pretty good, good choice for people who don't want red meat but was slightly dry+Pulled pork - very juicy and good+Sriracha garlic wings - very yummy and had a good amount of heat (MUCH better than Dinos way too thick wings)+Ribs - good as well, can't remember which ones we got though+Corn bread - SO so good+Mac n cheese - deliciously dangerous +Collard greens - good! +Whiskey sour pickles - LOVE these, refreshing bite after heavy loads of meat+Coleslaw - not the best I have had, but liked that it wasn't too mayo-y+Pit beans - a bit dry, didn't eat after one bite++Sticky sauce = gold!**Bonus for making a mean bloody mary. Could do the whole candied bacon stick as opposed to half :)Love the ambience as well! Fits the hipster BK yet southern rustic vibe right on the head.",5.0
"Spice does not mean it is good BBQ! I have been waiting to try this and now I can check it off the list. With BBQ you are supposed to be able to taste the food. But here they want you to taste the spices it seems. The brisket was smoked well, but with the pepper crust, you could not taste the meat. Ribs were coated with Sriracha and again you could not taste the meat. Baked beans with so much pepper that your mouth burned when taking bites were not so great either. The one meat that was good was the turkey as it was smoked and not covered with heat. The mac and cheese was cheesy and not too bad. My wife loves collard greens and she could not eat them as they added hot spices to those as well. Tone it down and more people will enjoy it.I have been a BBQ judge for 5 years and this would certainly not win any contest that it was entered into and would actually get lower than average scores.",2.0
Everything tastes so great. The place has a cool feeling to it. Maybe on the pricier end but well worth it.,5.0
"Not bad. Most of the food could use a little salt. Mac and cheese was a bit flavorless. BBQ Brisket sandwich was pretty good albeit, not terribly warm. Beers were good. Didn't really like the wait or all the smoke in this place. And finding a place to sit down can be a bit dicey. Good enough considering there isn't much else within walking distance. But, certainly not the destination that others might think it is.",3.0
This place is a hit or miss! If you want ribs get there when t opens or else u won't get any! The first time I went here I had the pork tacos and they were excellent the second time it almost tasted like the pork was marinated in mayo. The brisket was ok and the cornbread is Delish!

"No lines on a snowy weekday for lunch! (duh)The baby back ribs were very good. Greens were OK, mac and cheese was junky but good. Â Nice bloodys too.Worth it if you're in the area.",4.0
"I agree with a fellow reviewer in that the worst part of coming to Hometown BBQ is waiting in what can be quite a lengthy line. That and the large picnic tables where you have to try your luck at finding a seat make the experience, to me, only 4 stars instead of 5.Away from those two things, this place serves phenomenal food. The casual atmosphere, the extensive beer options at the bar (and likely bourbon, too, but I'm a BBQ and beer kind of person) and a user friendly self serve water/plate/silverware station make it an easy choice when in the mood for BBQ. When I ate here recently, for a belated birthday dinner, I was happily impressed with the variety of meats on offer as well as some interesting combinations (pork belly tacos!).We were a party of 4 and waited for about 25 minutes on a late Saturday afternoon/early evening in line to order our food. We managed to secure the end of one long picnic table just before ordering (a miracle) and had: beef brisket, beef rib (which looks like something out of the Flinstones it is so huge), pork belly, lamb belly and pork belly tacos. We also shared some collard greens and cornbread.The brisket was the best I have had city wide, I think. The pork belly was tremendous. The lamb belly we were served was more skin than meat therefore I don't feel like I can honestly comment on it. The pork tacos were really a treat, 3 served in an order with jalapenos on the side. The home run was the beef rib. I tend to be a pork rib girl, but my friend who had eaten here before said we had to do the beef rib because it was so amazing. It is - she didn't steer us wrong. It was devoured. We even had one of the group try to pick it up to gnaw off of which is quite a feat given its giant nature. The meat practically fell off the bone and was succulent beyond what I could imagine. The collards were good and the cornbread a solid 8 out of 10. All in all, if you can handle the wait for a seat and for the food (which is served by the lb) and manage to drag yourself to Red Hook (IKEA!), I would recommend this joint for some tasty, finger-liking BBQ.",4.0
Great food. Wished there was more seats. The sauces that they had were awesome. Would definitely give this place a try if you haven't.,4.0
Best bbq food I've ever had. I can believe how good the Mac and cheese is. It's spicey and cheesey but delicious at the same time. The collard greens are fantastic. I always go with the pulled pork over the brisket but I've tasted the brisket and all I have to say is WOW! Definitely give this place a chance!,5.0
"I've been to Hometown probably 6 times. Same staff I've noticed, and every time it does not disappoint. Everytime my sister's friends in town we go here, and they will only go right at opening time. I thought they were exaggerating about the line because when we went early it was kinda empty. Then I came a few nights on a Saturday and realized how insane the line can get. You will find yourself surrounded by lots of people and waiting for a while, but the food is worth it! They also were super courteous about people in line with the bartenders bringing you drinks while you wait, as well as food samples sometimes! Prices can add up so if trying to save, I recommend thinking about sizes when sharing so you don't go too crazy.Here's why I finally decided to write a review. Last weekend my boyfriend's family was in town from Fl. They aren't used to long lines and crowds so I was a bit worried they would be overwhelmed when we walked into a line that almost went out the building. Also, out of courtesy to not hold a table for 45mins when we didn't have food yet (SO many groups were doing this, and someone could eat in that time!) we waited till closer to the end to try and find a table. Didn't have luck. They we were, with our trays trying to find seating for 4 with other groups hovering over tables. While thinking we would have to take it to go, a gentlemen in the back table got up with his group and offered up his seats. Come to find out he was the owner/pitmaster (his arm was in a sling). He kept coming by to check on us and asked if we wanted to try anything. Even offered to make us drinks while we waited for the bartender. Awesome hospitality that you don't see much these days. Thank you for making their evening so comfortable!Anyways - the things I have tried;+Brisket - so tender and delicious!! +Turkey - pretty good, good choice for people who don't want red meat but was slightly dry+Pulled pork - very juicy and good+Sriracha garlic wings - very yummy and had a good amount of heat (MUCH better than Dinos way too thick wings)+Ribs - good as well, can't remember which ones we got though+Corn bread - SO so good+Mac n cheese - deliciously dangerous +Collard greens - good! +Whiskey sour pickles - LOVE these, refreshing bite after heavy loads of meat+Coleslaw - not the best I have had, but liked that it wasn't too mayo-y+Pit beans - a bit dry, didn't eat after one bite++Sticky sauce = gold!**Bonus for making a mean bloody mary. Could do the whole candied bacon stick as opposed to half :)Love the ambience as well! Fits the hipster BK yet southern rustic vibe right on the head.",5.0
"Spice does not mean it is good BBQ! I have been waiting to try this and now I can check it off the list. With BBQ you are supposed to be able to taste the food. But here they want you to taste the spices it seems. The brisket was smoked well, but with the pepper crust, you could not taste the meat. Ribs were coated with Sriracha and again you could not taste the meat. Baked beans with so much pepper that your mouth burned when taking bites were not so great either. The one meat that was good was the turkey as it was smoked and not covered with heat. The mac and cheese was cheesy and not too bad. My wife loves collard greens and she could not eat them as they added hot spices to those as well. Tone it down and more people will enjoy it.I have been a BBQ judge for 5 years and this would certainly not win any contest that it was entered into and would actually get lower than average scores.",2.0
Everything tastes so great. The place has a cool feeling to it. Maybe on the pricier end but well worth it.,5.0
"Not bad. Most of the food could use a little salt. Mac and cheese was a bit flavorless. BBQ Brisket sandwich was pretty good albeit, not terribly warm. Beers were good. Didn't really like the wait or all the smoke in this place. And finding a place to sit down can be a bit dicey. Good enough considering there isn't much else within walking distance. But, certainly not the destination that others might think it is.",3.0
This place is a hit or miss! If you want ribs get there when t opens or else u won't get any! The first time I went here I had the pork tacos and they were excellent the second time it almost tasted like the pork was marinated in mayo. The brisket was ok and the cornbread is Delish! But I've had way better!,3.0
"Place is ok, but we've had better. Â Flavors seemed just a touch subdued. Â The sriracha wings does not taste like sriracha, basically just their hot and sweet sauce. Â The jalapeÃ±o cheddar sausage did not taste like jalapeÃ±o or cheddar. Â The jerk ribs did not taste of jerk sauce, and the beans with burnt ends at Mighty Quinn's are better. Â We also tried the Korean sticky wings, which did not taste like any Korean flavor we are aware of. Â Overall, the food was not bad, but none of them tasted like how they were described or named.

"This place runs like many a BBQ joint - pop in line (bring a fully charged phone or a friend for the wait), order your meat by the 1/2 pound or a sandwich, move on to the next gent for your sides and desserts, and head to the bar to get your drinks.

Â For sides I went for mac 'n cheese and the BBQ beans. Didn't care for the beans, but I LOVED the mac and would just do a larger side of that next time.

Came Saturday night but the 90 minute wait was too much so had a do-over Monday and we were first on line. Brisket was tops but the ribs and pulled pork were also very good. The corn bread was fantastic. Mac and cheese solid. Only the slaw was eh. Plus a few Michter's American whiskeys. Place is great. The owner/pitmaster was working the register.

4 stars for the brisket alone. Yes beef is the way here. The brisket was thick slices and a perfect moist/firm texture. A pretty straightforward black pepper rub was flavorful but not overpowering. Just great. I didn't have room for the beef rib too unfortunately. They are popular. It is also a casual red hook hipster honkytonk vibe with families and old folks from the neighbors alongside the hip bbq dudes. Feels like Chicago hip or Seattle hip rather than NYC hip. Service was fine from intelligent but bored servers. I also tried the pork spareribs which were dry. Lightly smoke and thickly coated in a black pepper rub.And also the lamb belly was good but so rich I would share it.Coal slaw was watery and bland. The pickles were also bland. The sauces are called sticky and hot & sticky. Good names. Not my cup of tea but I respect them.

"This place doesn't have enough going for it to justify the amount you get for the price they charge. Had we been given more than a mere fistful of food, we would have had a great time. My boyfriend's brisket was excellent, but my lamb belly was bland and fatty. And the potato salad we shared was NOT potato salad- it was mashed potatoes mixed with pepper and vinegar. The place itself is bare and lacks personality. It's obvious that not much has been invested into the decor, layout, or presentation (food is served on cheap aluminum pans with plastic utensils), so there's no room for disappointment when it comes to the food. Any place that takes so little pride in its appearance and skimps on portions clearly doesn't care much about a customer's experience. Will not be returning.",2.0
"After a hungry drive up to NY, this place hit the spot. Stood in line for a while, but it was worth it. Brisket, pulled pork, mac n cheese, and cornbread were all on point. If I could recommend one thing though, it would definitely be the lamb belly. Get the lamb belly, no matter what.",5.0

"I wish I could say this is the best BBQ in town, especially since that's what we'd heard from friends, but my fiancÃ© (a Texas boy) and I were disappointed given all of the talk and great reviews. The brisket was room temp/cold. I've never had brisket that wasn't warm!! We weren't asked if we wanted lean or not. Our piece was kinda dry on one end and not all that flavorful. We had the Vietnamese wings, which were tasty and left a bit of heat in the back of our throats. The queso Mac and cheese was good, but that's kinda hard to mess up. The collards were ok, I didn't love them. The potato salad (it's mashed, FYI) was tasty. We had the sausage, which was ""Italian-style"" and studded with provolone. It was good, but I wish they dis Texas style sausages. All in all, I'd hoped to have some real TX brisket, but I would hit up Hill Country or Blue Smoke instead, especially given the line (we magically got there when it wasn't too long, it grew twice the size as we were in it).

"I trekked all the way from Westchester, NY to Red Hook, Brooklyn for this place since Eater had announced it The Best BBQ in town. It took about 15 minutes for a friend and I to find parking on an early Saturday afternoon and another half an hour wait in line, which left us ample time deciding what to get (We literally wanted to try everything). We decided to order half a pound each of brisket, baby back jerk ribs, lamb belly and a side of corn bread and macaroni and cheese. Half a pound of three types of meat and two sides was actually enough for two people and anymore would've ended up with leftovers. The meat is served Texan-style on a tissue paper. The lamb belly and brisket were both weighed from the butcher and we waited at our table for the baby back ribs. The brisket worth the hype. Hands down best brisket in all of NYC. That smokey center seasoned with simply salt and pepper and that sweet black ring around the tender and elastic texture of the inside was everything. The lamb belly was also seasoned the right amount despite others saying it might need a little more salt. The lamb taste was rich, but not too gamey. The baby back ribs had a fall-off-the-bone texture inside and suberb smokey flavor. The mac and cheese had bit of a kick to it but cheese sauce was overpowering. The corn bread I thought was average, but I guess a palate cleanser from all that meat. The sweet sauce complimented the brisket the most. The decor was Texan with its rustic and spacious feel, but the atmosphere was very Brooklyn and hipster. There's definitely a charm to this place in addition to amazing and mouthwatering BBQ meat.",5.0

"When you're craving for some good BBQ meat, this is the place to go to. Recently, I have been having this craving for southern food and most importantly, I wanted meat and more of it. Let's just say after the meal we had from hometown BBQ, I went home feeling above and beyond satisfied! For the meats, we ordered the pulled pork, brisket, whole rack, and pastrami bacon. For the sides, we ordered corn breads, pickle, and Cole slaw. I got to say, the corn bread was amazing. I'm usually skeptical about getting corn bread due to the fact that other places I've been to, the corn bread was terrible, but hometownbbq really hit the spot with the corn bread! Ok, enough praising on the corn bread. The real verdict is the meat!I loved the brisket! If I could, I would eat it all day. The rack was dry but it was delicious. The pastrami bacon was amazing. The pulled pork was my least favorite of the night but it wasnt terrible so its still a winner. Overall, the meats at this place were amazing and well worth the visit to Red Hook to try.

"On business trips across the U.S. I always made it a point to try local BBQ joints. With 75 or so destinations under my belt I was challenged to find a go-to place after moving to Brooklyn. I've been through the ringer of Fette Sau, Mighty Quinn's, Dinosaur, Hill Country and the like. None of these (or anywhere else across the country) compared to my experience at Hometown...Brisket:By far the best I've ever had. Fatty, juicy, mouth watering deliciousness with the perfect smoke flavor and well seasoned crust. IMHO the only way to judge a BBQ joint is the quality of their brisket. Nailed it 10/10.Beef Rib: This was a massive portion of outstandingly executed meat. Definitely on par with the brisket, I was completely amazed at its texture and overall flavor profile. 9.5/10Pork Ribs: The pork ribs were the less desirable of the bunch. Very tender but overpowered by a heavy rub, I believe it's the same rub that was used on the brisket. Pork being a lighter meat is a bit more sensitive and would be better off being more subtle in flavor/texture. 7/10Sides: I'm usually not big on sides, why ""waste calories"" when you have a delicious carnivorous feast in front of you.

"When you're craving for some good BBQ meat, this is the place to go to. Recently, I have been having this craving for southern food and most importantly, I wanted meat and more of it. Let's just say after the meal we had from hometown BBQ, I went home feeling above and beyond satisfied! For the meats, we ordered the pulled pork, brisket, whole rack, and pastrami bacon. For the sides, we ordered corn breads, pickle, and Cole slaw. I got to say, the corn bread was amazing. I'm usually skeptical about getting corn bread due to the fact that other places I've been to, the corn bread was terrible, but hometownbbq really hit the spot with the corn bread! Ok, enough praising on the corn bread. The real verdict is the meat!I loved the brisket! If I could, I would eat it all day. The rack was dry but it was delicious. The pastrami bacon was amazing. The pulled pork was my least favorite of the night but it wasnt terrible so its still a winner. Overall, the meats at this place were amazing and well worth the visit to Red Hook to try. A bonus is there is a fairway market across the street so you can pick up some awesome organic produce on your way home.",5.0

I ordered for 3- husband and his mom were with me. I ordered 1/2 lb each of pulled pork, brisket and pork belly.Meats- Pulled pork was really my favorite. Brisket was stringy- I think they didn't cut it correctly and I would have expected it to be juicier. The Pork Belly was a little too fatty for me personally, but my husband loved it. It did have very good flavor. Sides- Mac and cheese is just ok. I overheard one of the employees say their secret is Velvetta and Rotel tomatoes. Home made pickles are EXCELLENT. They should open a pickle shop! Coleslaw and beans are also good. Would order again.",4.0
"My husband & I just finished eating here. After reading all the good reviews, and BBQ being one of my favorite food, we had to drive down to Red Hook, and check it out. When we first walked in, we were both a little confused on the ordering system, one of the owners came right over, and explained everything to us, he was extremely nice, giving us a brief disruption, showing us the place, and making small talk. I am all about customer service! And this place has it! You can tell right off the bat that they care about their restaurant, and the customers, this you don't see so often anymore. Especially in such a large establishment. Ok on to the food....the ordering system is basically standing on line, ordering your meat first (we had the pulled pork, brisket & wings) they cut the meat right in front of you, give you the amount appropriate for you, and weight it. Then you order the sides (we got macaroni & cheese, potato salad, and baked beans) after that you pay, get your utensils, and sit down. Basically cafeteria style, reminded me of high school. The drinks even soda you have to order from the bar. I've been to other places with this style of ordering, it doesn't bother me, except the fact I had to go to the bar for soda, and keep getting up for drinks. It would have been nice if someone would at least take drink orders. But other then that which isn't much, doesn't make me dislike the place. The pulled pork was delicious, so was the brisket, the macaroni & cheese had a good kick to it, I don't know what was in it, but it was a little spicy. Would I order it again? Hell yes! So was the potato salad! While eating another owner came over and asked how the food went, great guy! Funny personality, explained that the wood on one of the walls came from a hundred year old barn that was destroyed after hurricane sandy, thought it was nice to speak to us, and many of the other people eating. I've ate at a lot of BBQ places in Brooklyn, and this one is one of the BEST! It has a unique taste, but a very delicious one! Can't wait for a nice warm night to go on a Friday night when they have a live band, enjoy some BBQ food and beers. Thanks for the GREAT hospitality! Keep it up! Thanks for a great dinner! Keep smoking that delicious meat!",5.0
"Docking a star for the surly bartender but if it weren't for her 'tude this would be an easy 5-star review. Â I don't even like barbecue and I also don't really enjoy the trek out to Red Hook on a Tuesday night but my friends were having a goodbye party which I refused to miss. Â I only wish I'd changed into spandex before! Â We ordered all the meats on the menu but I think I only had the brisket and the pulled pork. Â I honestly don't know which was better; they were both melt in your mouth explosions of flavor and in my (novice) opinion perfectly cooked. Â My main focus was on the protein but sidewise I really liked the slaw and the corn bread. Â Mac and cheese was less appealing, you can skip this and not miss much. Â The collard greens were also really tasty (note that they come with thick bacon slices so not healthy or vegetarian!). Â I wish I'd left room for dessert--they lineup from Robicelli's looks spot-on. Â I can't wait to return (and then walk the several miles home to walk off the meat sweats).",4.0
"For a NY BBQ joint, it will do, but after spending most of my adult life in Texas, Hometown doesn't even come close to Texas BBQ. The brisket is over seasoned with pepper (more like Pastrami).

"A great spot to escape the city and feel like part of America again. Hometown is hard to get to but worth the effort. Their Pulled pork is easily on par with Dinosaur, the ribs rival Mighty Quinn's, and the brisket is the best in the city.Come for the brisket, try the beef ribs and don't miss the solid lineup of sides.

"How is this place rated one of the best BBQ places in the city? The beef ribs are really unctuous and tender, but are underseasoned and lack smoke/flavor. Brisket is average. Sides are good, but don't compensate for the ribs. And I really wanted to like this place...",2.0
"Like others that have left comments I was disappointed that they ran out of ribs on a Saturday evening at 6;00pm. Really?!? I had the pulled pork. It was okay nothing to write home about. I also had the roasted turkey, pastrami sandwich it was okay. The pastrami was very fatty. The line wasn't long as many other wrote about and we got a table right away. They have a bar and it's pretty reasonable. When I first walked in and smelled the wood burning and that BBQ smell I was thought this was the place I was looking for. Once I had began to eat it changed and I liked the smell of the place better than the food. I almost forgot to mention the sides. I had collard greens. Those were amazing and went well with the corn bread. The meat was missing seasonings. I am not sure if they don't season the meat on purpose but I didn't want to use the BBQ sauce. A great piece of meat needs no sauce. The quest continues to find the best BBQ in Brooklyn.",3.0

I ordered for 3- husband and his mom were with me. I ordered 1/2 lb each of pulled pork, brisket and pork belly.Meats- Pulled pork was really my favorite. Brisket was stringy- I think they didn't cut it correctly and I would have expected it to be juicier. The Pork Belly was a little too fatty for me personally, but my husband loved it. It did have very good flavor. Sides- Mac and cheese is just ok. I overheard one of the employees say their secret is Velvetta and Rotel tomatoes. Home made pickles are EXCELLENT. They should open a pickle shop! Coleslaw and beans are also good. Would order again.",4.0
"My husband & I just finished eating here. After reading all the good reviews, and BBQ being one of my favorite food, we had to drive down to Red Hook, and check it out. When we first walked in, we were both a little confused on the ordering system, one of the owners came right over, and explained everything to us, he was extremely nice, giving us a brief disruption, showing us the place, and making small talk. I am all about customer service! And this place has it! You can tell right off the bat that they care about their restaurant, and the customers, this you don't see so often anymore. Especially in such a large establishment. Ok on to the food....the ordering system is basically standing on line, ordering your meat first (we had the pulled pork, brisket & wings) they cut the meat right in front of you, give you the amount appropriate for you, and weight it. Then you order the sides (we got macaroni & cheese, potato salad, and baked beans) after that you pay, get your utensils, and sit down. Basically cafeteria style, reminded me of high school. The drinks even soda you have to order from the bar. I've been to other places with this style of ordering, it doesn't bother me, except the fact I had to go to the bar for soda, and keep getting up for drinks. It would have been nice if someone would at least take drink orders. But other then that which isn't much, doesn't make me dislike the place. The pulled pork was delicious, so was the brisket, the macaroni & cheese had a good kick to it, I don't know what was in it, but it was a little spicy. Would I order it again? Hell yes! So was the potato salad! While eating another owner came over and asked how the food went, great guy! Funny personality, explained that the wood on one of the walls came from a hundred year old barn that was destroyed after hurricane sandy, thought it was nice to speak to us, and many of the other people eating. I've ate at a lot of BBQ places in Brooklyn, and this one is one of the BEST! It has a unique taste, but a very delicious one! Can't wait for a nice warm night to go on a Friday night when they have a live band, enjoy some BBQ food and beers. Thanks for the GREAT hospitality! Keep it up! Thanks for a great dinner! Keep smoking that delicious meat!",5.0
"Docking a star for the surly bartender but if it weren't for her 'tude this would be an easy 5-star review. Â I don't even like barbecue and I also don't really enjoy the trek out to Red Hook on a Tuesday night but my friends were having a goodbye party which I refused to miss. Â I only wish I'd changed into spandex before! Â We ordered all the meats on the menu but I think I only had the brisket and the pulled pork. Â I honestly don't know which was better; they were both melt in your mouth explosions of flavor and in my (novice) opinion perfectly cooked. Â My main focus was on the protein but sidewise I really liked the slaw and the corn bread. Â Mac and cheese was less appealing, you can skip this and not miss much. Â The collard greens were also really tasty (note that they come with thick bacon slices so not healthy or vegetarian!). Â I wish I'd left room for dessert--they lineup from Robicelli's looks spot-on. Â I can't wait to return (and then walk the several miles home to walk off the meat sweats).",4.0
"For a NY BBQ joint, it will do, but after spending most of my adult life in Texas, Hometown doesn't even come close to Texas BBQ. The brisket is over seasoned with pepper (more like Pastrami). The beans were too sweet and the backyard potato salad was more like mashed potatoes that someone spilled pickle juice in.",2.0
"A great spot to escape the city and feel like part of America again. Hometown is hard to get to but worth the effort. Their Pulled pork is easily on par with Dinosaur, the ribs rival Mighty Quinn's, and the brisket is the best in the city.Come for the brisket, try the beef ribs and don't miss the solid lineup of sides. Collard greens better than any I found in Tennessee.I wouldn't avoid anything, but i was a little less impressed with the spare ribs, the beans, and the potato salad.",5.0
"How is this place rated one of the best BBQ places in the city? The beef ribs are really unctuous and tender, but are underseasoned and lack smoke/flavor. Brisket is average. Sides are good, but don't compensate for the ribs. And I really wanted to like this place...",2.0
"Like others that have left comments I was disappointed that they ran out of ribs on a Saturday evening at 6;00pm. Really?!? I had the pulled pork. It was okay nothing to write home about. I also had the roasted turkey, pastrami sandwich it was okay. The pastrami was very fatty. The line wasn't long as many other wrote about and we got a table right away. They have a bar and it's pretty reasonable. When I first walked in and smelled the wood burning and that BBQ smell I was thought this was the place I was looking for. Once I had began to eat it changed and I liked the smell of the place better than the food. I almost forgot to mention the sides. I had collard greens. Those were amazing and went well with the corn bread. The meat was missing seasonings. I am not sure if they don't season the meat on purpose but I didn't want to use the BBQ sauce. A great piece of meat needs no sauce. The quest continues to find the best BBQ in Brooklyn.",3.0
"Wow. Â This might be my new favorite BBQ place in New York City Limits, surpassing the storied Fete Sau. Â Hometown came highly recommended from my sister who doesn't eat four-legged animals so I was skeptical to say the least. Â Thankfully, she was right and I had an epic meal with leftovers for the next night.This place is another reason to come to Redhook, in the bowels of Brooklyn. Â I would definitely live here if it weren't so freakin far from a subway. Â I guess that's what makes it even cooler. Â Pretty standard counter service BBQ layout here. Â Very open floor not too crowded with tables. Â Nice long bar Â with a couple ladies tending your needs. Â You can smell the faint aroma of smoked meats as you walk down the street but as soon as you step inside, your nostrils are engulfed with olfactory hues that will make you drool. Â  Tuck that lip in, boy, you got some work to do. Â Not crowded on a Thursday night, we have a drink at the bar and discuss our game plan before heading to the counter. Â We thought we had it figured out but chaos ensued when we find out that they are all out of beef rib, lamb belly & pork belly. Â From yelp reviews, the beef rib and lamb belly are supposed to be the two best things here and pork belly is pretty much my most favorite thing in the world so needless to say, I am a little disappointed. Â The pitmaster talks me off the ledge by handing me a bit of fatty brisket and I put my game face back on. Â Plenty of other items to indulge on tonight. Â We opt for every other meat on the menu: brisket, pulled pork, sausage, spare ribs, baby back ribs & chicken. Â Chicken is for the birds (British word for women) so I didn't care to waste any precious stomach space with that. Â I tend to find that BBQ restaurants do one thing really well and everything else just ok (Dinosaur: Wings, Hill Country: Brisket, Daisy Mays: Ribs, Mighty Quinn's: Burnt Ends). Â That wasn't the case here. Â Everything we ate was excellent. Â The standouts definitely being the brisket and spare ribs. Â I will probably skip the baby backs next time and just get another spare rib or two instead. Â Besides the brisket rivaling Hill Country, these spare ribs were some of the best I've ever had and could take the cake over Daisy May's. Â A heavy rub gives them a nice bite and just a gentle clench of the teeth will leave you with a mouth full of heaven. Â As for the sides, they do those well too. Â I think this place is now the hometown (pun intended) of my favorite baked beans and cornbread. Â Off the hizzy for shizzy. Â I didn't try the mac n' cheese but I hear it's nothing special.

"If you like BBQ with a kick of spice, this place is for you. The spare ribs had a good amount of char along with tender/moist/meat with just the right amount of flavorful fat.

"Amber and I were going to New York City for our fifth wedding anniversary and also to see my sister who lives there. The only time I have been to NYC was when I was eight or so with my family. My wife and I went on a ""diet"" before the trip so I was limited to how much barbecue I can eat. When we travel, I put a lot of focus on food so we knew our waistline was going to increase. Traveling out of town with me is not easy. I try to hit up as many BBQ joints as I can. I know my wife gets annoyed with how much barbecue we eat so we decided on one stop on this trip. Hometown Bar-B-Que located in the Brooklyn was my choice.Lately, it seems like New York City is a hotbed for barbecue. You would think the two would not go together. A Yankee smoking meat? Where would the smokers go? Texas Monthly BBQ editor Daniel Vaughn caused a stir when he said ""The brisket I've had in NYC lately is better than a lot of places Texas"" in this article. I find some truth in that statement. Some of the places I have been to in Texas do not put their heart and passion into the 'cue and it shows. Hometown Bar-B-Que is owned by Billy Durney. Check out an interview of him here. Hometown just celebrated its one year anniversary. It would have been opened for business earlier, but Hurricane Sandy had other ideas.The first thing you will notice on the menu is the price of the meats. This is New York so it is definitely not cheap. Brisket is 28 bucks per pound. Franklin is charging $20 per pound right now which is the most I have paid. We ordered a quarter pound of moist brisket and pork belly, a link of jalapeÃ±o-cheddar sausage, and a half rack of jerk baby back pork ribs. I wanted a beef rib too, but I did not want to break the bank. We also got a side of Texas-style queso macaroni and cheese. The brisket was outstanding. It was very comparable with the stuff you would find at good places in Texas. There was a nice smoke flavor, and the meat was tender. The influence of Wayne Mueller of Louie Mueller showed with the peppery bark. I wish I had ordered more. When I bit into the brisket, I regretted not getting the beef rib. I knew it would have been great.The flavor of the pork belly was superb. The sweet rub played well with the smoke. I have seen pork belly sliced but not pulled before. Every bite was rich and savory. I was disappointed in the house-made jalapeÃ±o-cheddar sausage. The grit and pop were on point, but I did not like anything else about it. There was something off about the flavor profile. I expected more heat and to taste more cheese. I gave up after a few bites. Hometown also serves a beef link but was not available today. I normally go with spareribs but went with the baby back ribs instead. It was recommended to me so I could not pass it up. The half rack of the jerk baby back ribs was delicious. The unique Caribbean inspired jerk rub packed a ton of flavor. The spices were not overwhelming and made a great duo with the sweet undertones. The meat was juicy and smoky. We ate every single one. The macaroni and cheese was very cheesy but good. It was essentially macaroni and cheese with queso poured over it.It was worth the hour long subway and bus ride. Daniel Vaughn might be on to something. If Hometown Bar-B-Que was located in Texas, it would absolutely do well. Brisket is king here in Texas, and Billy can smoke a mean one. The highlights of the noteworthy menu included Sriracha hot wings, pork belly tacos, and lamb belly banh mi. I want it all. Maybe next time when I go back. I am thinking of hitting up Delaney Barbecue too. Maybe I should start a crowdfunding so I can do a NYC BBQ tour?",5.0

"It's probably for the best that Hometown is so damned far out in Red Hook, because otherwise a) I'd be here every durned day eating the best brisket end beans in the city and b) I'd be hella fat by eating said beans. Truthfully, you'd be better biking out here and making it a solid destination point with a group of friends, like we decided to do last weekend.As many folks have mentioned before, the service is comically slow -- my bf and I split up, me in the food line and him at the bar, and either way it ended absurdly long. While his bartender was just working alone and at a snail's pace, the barbecue line is just inefficiently laid out. Perhaps it's deliberate so folks can actually find seats at the many communal tables in the restaurant?While I wasn't overly impressed by the spare ribs, the highlight of the meal was the brisket. Tender, fatty, juicy, the brisket made my life change, especially paired with the trio of barbecue sauces at the tables. I've already harped about the beans, but the potato salad is also excellent, wonderfully flecked with dill and not overloaded with mayo.The prices aren't terribly expensive (I've seen worse in other hipster places) and the taste is outstanding, absolutely worth the trek out to Red Hook for this level of smoky meat.",4.0
"Lines are way to long for just average bbq food. After getting my food and waiting i couldn't even eat i was exhausted from waiting over 2 hours on line. Food was cold and not that great. Â We had ribs, cornbread ,mac n cheese, collards. It's just ok. I've had way better bbq else where. Â You have to wait at the bar for any drink. Not enough seating and parking is crazy in this area. Will not go back the wait is not work it.",2.0
"Best ribs ever.quality is really good. Not accessible by train as it is in Red Hook.You order at the counter and bus your own table. the brisket has too much pepper on it for my taste;it is the most expensive barbeque place I've been to.You will be shocked by the prices.It was shown on the food channel Â and it was good;$74 great for a meal though, it wasn't.",4.0
"I didn't think it would be possible to find that great BBQ taste like I've had at Salt Lick in TX until I came to Hometown. The place is a stretch to get to but luckily I have a car and was able to bring some of my friends for a friends birthday to try this place. Once you walk you will smell the smokey bbq smell that can probably be Â your clothes.Lets get to it. Best brisket I've had while living in NJ/NY area. It was so soft, moist, rich, and decadent that it was probably the best feeling I've had since my parents watched me graduate get my college diploma. Not only was the brisket delicious but also tried the beef ribs, smoked jalepeno & cheddar sausage, pork belly taco's, baby back ribs, and shredded pork belly. Everything pretty much was super super freakin delicious. It's a little more pricier than I would like it to be but it seriously was worth every penny. We also got the cornbread, mac and cheese, and potato salad as sides. They all were outstanding in their own way and complimented the meats perfectly. They have 3 sauces (Sticky, Hot and Sweet, and Regular) which you can put on your plate, kind of like Chipotle style where you can grab the bottle squeezer and bring it to your table.The best was Sticky as it was sweet and tangy but the hot and sweet wasn't bad either. They also have live music in the other room but no one was playing when we went. I recommend this place for sure. I can not wait till I go back.",5.0
This place is located in red hook where I am not often traveling to but after finding this place I may have too. I have had a few brisket in my life time but wow. Their brisket is something else.

"The food was pretty good, but I've definitely had better. Â Very tender ribs, pretty good sides. Â The problem is the service. Â The two arrogant, angry and bored hipster dudes serving the food were horrible. Â I will save the details but just say they were probably two of the rudest food service workers I've experienced in a really long time. Â It was as if we were bothering them and they even had the balls to talk sh*t about another customer right in front of us. Â A customer that had a legitimate concern about being served her sides 15 minutes before her made to order dish was finished. Â The customer wasn't even remotely rude to them, yet they proceeded to lambast her in front of everyone. Â I honestly wanted to jump over the counter and take both of their heads and knock them together. Â And I'm not talking about two kids. Â They were two 'grown' men. Â With two or three local BBQ joints with better food, the horrible service was enough to put this on my list of where not to eat again.",2.0
"$$$ The BBQ is very very good. The decor, bar, space is fantastic and like a bbq dream. The only turnoff is that it's a bit overpriced. I get that it's Brooklyn, even Red Hook, but It loses its love when the portions for 2 ppl to go comes to $60. I'm used to NY prices, I get what they are doing here, I've eaten at Blue Smoke, Dino, Hill, etc. Two meats (1/2 lb) and three sides. Brisket, lamb belly, Mac and cheese, collards, beans. Again, the meats and sides were delicious. And we are full at the end. Some of the charm of bbq is the plate special where you order your meats and sides are included. I get it, They charge by the lb and side sizes (most people would probably want medium-large $8/each). I do not regret ordering this food to go for mid-week dinner, it was delicious, just feel a little short sided for the buck. You should go eat and drink here! Just know that you will be paying premium price for premium bbq and you will pay for that side of corn bread. Not that there's anything wrong with that.",4.0

"Ill get to the point: Sandwiches vs meat: Ditch the sandwich option and go for the plain meat instead. You will get more meat for your money. Also, they drown the sandwiches In sauce, and me personally, Id rather put sauce on my sandwich myself. Ask for a roll on the side. (See below). Brisket: On par with some of the best Ive had. Good crust. Good texture, Good smoke flavor. Just the right amount of fat. Not too much, and not too little. Not earth shattering, but outside of Texas, pretty damn good. Pork belly: Wow. This is like pulled pork on steroids. Really really good. The temperature needs to be just right to get the fat to the right consistency. Ribs: Wow! the spareribs are to me the show stealer. The texture is amazing The rub is what is key. A coarse pepper based rub, sweet and tangy at the same time. There is an addictive taste quality about this that I cant describe. Sides: OK. not the best, but not the worst. I had the beans and slaw. Cornbread: Wow again. Sweet, crusty, crumbly. Perfect for sopping up the grease from the meats. One gripe is that they should give some plain cheap white bread (i.e Wonder) to go with the meats. This is a custom at BBQ joints across the south. I did however ask for a roll on the side and they obliged. All in all I think this is some of the best Ive had outside of the Midwest/south. The spareribs in Â my opinion was the star. I think if you read through these reviews, you will find differing opinions, but I don't think you will have a bad meal if you go here. It is expensive, but its New York. I would come here again for sure.",4.0

"It's probably for the best that Hometown is so damned far out in Red Hook, because otherwise a) I'd be here every durned day eating the best brisket end beans in the city and b) I'd be hella fat by eating said beans. Truthfully, you'd be better biking out here and making it a solid destination point with a group of friends, like we decided to do last weekend.As many folks have mentioned before, the service is comically slow -- my bf and I split up, me in the food line and him at the bar, and either way it ended absurdly long. While his bartender was just working alone and at a snail's pace, the barbecue line is just inefficiently laid out. Perhaps it's deliberate so folks can actually find seats at the many communal tables in the restaurant?While I wasn't overly impressed by the spare ribs, the highlight of the meal was the brisket. Tender, fatty, juicy, the brisket made my life change, especially paired with the trio of barbecue sauces at the tables. I've already harped about the beans, but the potato salad is also excellent, wonderfully flecked with dill and not overloaded with mayo.The prices aren't terribly expensive (I've seen worse in other hipster places) and the taste is outstanding, absolutely worth the trek out to Red Hook for this level of smoky meat.",4.0
"Lines are way to long for just average bbq food. After getting my food and waiting i couldn't even eat i was exhausted from waiting over 2 hours on line. Food was cold and not that great. Â We had ribs, cornbread ,mac n cheese, collards. It's just ok. I've had way better bbq else where. Â You have to wait at the bar for any drink. Not enough seating and parking is crazy in this area. Will not go back the wait is not work it.",2.0
"Best ribs ever.quality is really good. Not accessible by train as it is in Red Hook.You order at the counter and bus your own table. the brisket has too much pepper on it for my taste;it is the most expensive barbeque place I've been to.You will be shocked by the prices.It was shown on the food channel Â and it was good;$74 great for a meal though, it wasn't.",4.0
"I didn't think it would be possible to find that great BBQ taste like I've had at Salt Lick in TX until I came to Hometown. The place is a stretch to get to but luckily I have a car and was able to bring some of my friends for a friends birthday to try this place. Once you walk you will smell the smokey bbq smell that can probably be Â your clothes.Lets get to it. Best brisket I've had while living in NJ/NY area. It was so soft, moist, rich, and decadent that it was probably the best feeling I've had since my parents watched me graduate get my college diploma. Not only was the brisket delicious but also tried the beef ribs, smoked jalepeno & cheddar sausage, pork belly taco's, baby back ribs, and shredded pork belly. Everything pretty much was super super freakin delicious. It's a little more pricier than I would like it to be but it seriously was worth every penny. We also got the cornbread, mac and cheese, and potato salad as sides. They all were outstanding in their own way and complimented the meats perfectly. They have 3 sauces (Sticky, Hot and Sweet, and Regular) which you can put on your plate, kind of like Chipotle style where you can grab the bottle squeezer and bring it to your table.The best was Sticky as it was sweet and tangy but the hot and sweet wasn't bad either. They also have live music in the other room but no one was playing when we went. I recommend this place for sure. I can not wait till I go back.",5.0
This place is located in red hook where I am not often traveling to but after finding this place I may have too. I have had a few brisket in my life time but wow. Their brisket is something else. I would say best in Brooklyn if not all of New York. Lines are a bit long but what do you expect great food here,5.0
"The food was pretty good, but I've definitely had better. Â Very tender ribs, pretty good sides. Â The problem is the service. Â The two arrogant, angry and bored hipster dudes serving the food were horrible. Â I will save the details but just say they were probably two of the rudest food service workers I've experienced in a really long time. Â It was as if we were bothering them and they even had the balls to talk sh*t about another customer right in front of us. Â A customer that had a legitimate concern about being served her sides 15 minutes before her made to order dish was finished. Â The customer wasn't even remotely rude to them, yet they proceeded to lambast her in front of everyone. Â I honestly wanted to jump over the counter and take both of their heads and knock them together. Â And I'm not talking about two kids. Â They were two 'grown' men. Â With two or three local BBQ joints with better food, the horrible service was enough to put this on my list of where not to eat again.",2.0
"$$$ The BBQ is very very good. The decor, bar, space is fantastic and like a bbq dream. The only turnoff is that it's a bit overpriced. I get that it's Brooklyn, even Red Hook, but It loses its love when the portions for 2 ppl to go comes to $60. I'm used to NY prices, I get what they are doing here, I've eaten at Blue Smoke, Dino, Hill, etc. Two meats (1/2 lb) and three sides. Brisket, lamb belly, Mac and cheese, collards, beans.

"Great find. It's definitely a bit of a hike to get here, but it's a wonderful spot nonetheless.Went here for a friend's birthday celebration in the afternoon. Large, open space that had a pretty good-sized crowd. Our group was already comfortably spread out on one of the large tables. It's a simple process. Drinks at the bar, Food at the counter. If you have a really large order, they'll give you a number and bring it out to you.I wasn't that hungry so I was looking for something a little smaller. I ordered the smoked sausage sandwich with jalapenos and cheddar and a side of cornbread. Wow, delicious! The sausage was served on a baguette with pickles and spicy mustard. I could tell it was good quality since there was none of those little chewy fat bits that you usually find in sausage. I hate those. This sausage was meaty, spicy, and just a hint cheesy. Really hit the spot. The cornbread was excellent. Some of the best I've had, and went really well with the hot sauce.Also enjoyed the Bloody Mary.

The wait on the line is one of the reasons I gave it a 4 star review since, logistically, the restaurant has the potential to be much better in that department.

Basically, the majority of the food choices (Jerk Baby Back Ribs, Sausages, etc) were already out by the time I ordered and this was during dinner on a Saturday night. Again, logistical problems were at play. Though, the food that I got to order and taste were the main highlights of this establishment. Flavors from the brisket and pulled pork really made a difference and the side dishes of potato salad and Mac and cheese were comforting. A minor inconvenience was price to portion ratio but if you're willing to ignore that then I recommend coming here at least once to try.

"2nd visit. Brisket here still wins over any other brisket. Great bark which makes it very tasty. 2nd time they ran out of turkey by 5PM. This time, tried the Spare Ribs. Again great bark. But not very smoky in taste and meat (although not tough) wasn't falling off the bone. Not bad, but not great either. Also tried the Chipotle Chicken. A bit overdone and very plain tasting - not even a hint of Chilpotle or spice. Queso Mac and cheese was very good and this time I tried the cornbread, which was good - moist and tasty - but could have been a touch sweeter. But the most memorable thing about the visit ... unfortunately ... was the wait. An hour and ten minutes from the back of the line (which was at the entrance). This place needs help in moving things along at the counter - lots of help. There are only two counter people who cut the meat, serve you, and collect the money. And it seems like people just take their sweet old time about ordering. Each ""party"" takes a good 5 minutes. The line couldn't have had more than 25 people on it, yet it took 1 hour 10 minutes and I arrived at 3:45PM on a Sunday. Honestly, even if this place was exceptional, I would not go back unless I heard that they improved their speed. There is really no excuse for a line of that many people to take that long.",3.0

"So if you want to talk about BBQ in NYC and don't mention Hometown, you clearly don't know what you're talking about. Â I first came across Hometown at the Big Apple BBQ last year and absolutely fell in love with their BBQ since. Â Finally made it to their location in Red Hook about a year ago and can't stay away from the place. Â Every single thing I have ever ordered from them has been top notch and amazing. Â In fact I loved this place so much I even had my wedding reception here. Â I first met the owners Lianna and BIlly a few months back when we started to think how cool it would be to have a wedding reception at Hometown. Â From the moment I met the two of them, my now wife and I knew this was the place for us. Â Granted I would imagine not too many people have had their wedding reception there, you would never know that from the perfection they executed the event with. Â Billy and Lianna both sat down with my wife and I and discussed what we wanted on the menu. Â Having tried most everything on their menu and been overly satisfied with it all it actually made for a difficult decision. Â We went with the Beef Rib, Brisket, Chipolte Chicken and a WHOLE HOG for the main course with the Siracha Wings and the Lamb Belly Banh Mi for the apps. Â When I tell you everything came out amazing is an understatement. Â Lianna (who is more of the logistical expert) was SO COOL when explaining everything and planning our big day down to every last detail. Â The rest of the staff who was present at the reception were also equally as awesome and made us feel really awesome and stress free. Â I know having a wedding reception at a BBQ spot may be too outside of the box and out of the Â question for some people but for us it was perfect. Â Aside from our awesome experience lets talk about the food and location. Â The location is in the now really trendy area of Red Hook at the end of Van Brunt St. right across from the Fairway. Â The building itself is pretty huge with two separate rooms and two separate bars. Â The main room is also shared by the service counter with a very attentive staff there to answer any of your questions about any of the meats served. Â The menu is up on the wall and having been a frequent customer for a while now I understand that the menu changes slightly from time to time so to have a traditional paper menu is not practical. Â You basically order the meat by the pound and the service folks will prepare it right in front of you. Â Once you have your food you can move over to the bar to grab one of the craft beers or whatever. Â There is a ton of seating in either room so its pretty cool. Â Now to the food..... Â Like I've said probably 20 times in this review the food is AMAZING. Â This is not only my opinion but the opinion of many local and even national food critics. Â Billy (the owner/ pit master) has participated and competed in BBQ contests throughout the country. Â I was actually bummed to find out he wouldn't be there for my reception but Lianna informed us he was actually in Memphis for Memphis in May (for you that don't know what that is, it's one of the largest BBQ competitions in the country). Â Pretty good excuse to not be around. Â Either way, the food, regardless of what you order is phenomenal. Â My personal favorite is the Beef Rib. Â Costing around 35 bucks for a whole beef rib may seem expensive, but when you see the size of it your concerns will be dispelled. Â They are absolutely gigantic! Â The only way I can describe the way it tastes is imagine eating the best porterhouse steak you have ever had and couple that with the texture and tenderness of Filet Mignon. Â It is out of this world. Â Hometown is also know for their brisket (having won the brisket category in the Kingsford invitational this year) and it is really really good. Â I have eaten brisket at all the big brisket places in NYC (Fette Sau, Blue Smoke, Dinosaur, etc) and Hometown's can't even be compared. Â A really cool aspect of NYC BBQ is that there is not a set standard so BIlly and the other pit guys at Hometown can really play with different ideas for their BBQ and take some of the influence from the different areas of the country and make it their own. Â Moving on the the other menu items, the other ribs are awesome (the even have jerk baby backs which being in Brooklyn is a cool shoutout to the Caribbean population) and the spare ribs are fall off the bone. Â The other menu item that you are committing a sin if you don't order on every visit it the siracha wings. Â Blended with the perfect smoke taste and tang from the sauce, these are the best wings I have ever had in my life. Overall, Hometown is one of, if not my favorite restaurant in NYC. Â Not only are the staff and owners amazing people, they really hit the BBQ genre of food on the head. Â I can't say enough good things about this place. Â AND if anyone out there ever had the idea of have a wedding reception in a fun out of the box way, this place is a great place to check out.",5.0
"What I love about this place is that you can step inside on an early summer evening and grab a beer by the bar and listen to a blue-grassy band and nosh on BBQ and feel like a world away from New York. Maybe it's the air off the bay nearby, but really it feels like a glorious getaway. It feels like a homecoming; you can let your hair down.Don't come a prime time and expect speedy grub: the line can be long. Good things take time.

"2nd visit. Brisket here still wins over any other brisket. Great bark which makes it very tasty. 2nd time they ran out of turkey by 5PM. This time, tried the Spare Ribs. Again great bark. But not very smoky in taste and meat (although not tough) wasn't falling off the bone. Not bad, but not great either. Also tried the Chipotle Chicken. A bit overdone and very plain tasting - not even a hint of Chilpotle or spice. Queso Mac and cheese was very good and this time I tried the cornbread, which was good - moist and tasty - but could have been a touch sweeter. But the most memorable thing about the visit ... unfortunately ... was the wait. An hour and ten minutes from the back of the line (which was at the entrance). This place needs help in moving things along at the counter - lots of help. There are only two counter people who cut the meat, serve you, and collect the money. And it seems like people just take their sweet old time about ordering. Each ""party"" takes a good 5 minutes. The line couldn't have had more than 25 people on it, yet it took 1 hour 10 minutes and I arrived at 3:45PM on a Sunday. Honestly, even if this place was exceptional, I would not go back unless I heard that they improved their speed. There is really no excuse for a line of that many people to take that long.",3.0
"This is the best BBQ! I usually order the ribs and brisket or the brisket sandwich. Mac n Cheese and pickles. You can't beat the flavors here! On a busy day tho, be prepared to wait in line for a while as there is no table service. Also this is not cheap bbq but it's well worth the $$$$$. Get ready for a party in your mouth!",5.0
"So if you want to talk about BBQ in NYC and don't mention Hometown, you clearly don't know what you're talking about. Â I first came across Hometown at the Big Apple BBQ last year and absolutely fell in love with their BBQ since. Â Finally made it to their location in Red Hook about a year ago and can't stay away from the place. Â Every single thing I have ever ordered from them has been top notch and amazing. Â In fact I loved this place so much I even had my wedding reception here. Â I first met the owners Lianna and BIlly a few months back when we started to think how cool it would be to have a wedding reception at Hometown. Â From the moment I met the two of them, my now wife and I knew this was the place for us. Â Granted I would imagine not too many people have had their wedding reception there, you would never know that from the perfection they executed the event with. Â Billy and Lianna both sat down with my wife and I and discussed what we wanted on the menu. Â Having tried most everything on their menu and been overly satisfied with it all it actually made for a difficult decision. Â We went with the Beef Rib, Brisket, Chipolte Chicken and a WHOLE HOG for the main course with the Siracha Wings and the Lamb Belly Banh Mi for the apps. Â When I tell you everything came out amazing is an understatement. Â Lianna (who is more of the logistical expert) was SO COOL when explaining everything and planning our big day down to every last detail. Â The rest of the staff who was present at the reception were also equally as awesome and made us feel really awesome and stress free. Â I know having a wedding reception at a BBQ spot may be too outside of the box and out of the Â question for some people but for us it was perfect. Â Aside from our awesome experience lets talk about the food and location. Â The location is in the now really trendy area of Red Hook at the end of Van Brunt St. right across from the Fairway. Â The building itself is pretty huge with two separate rooms and two separate bars. Â The main room is also shared by the service counter with a very attentive staff there to answer any of your questions about any of the meats served. Â The menu is up on the wall and having been a frequent customer for a while now I understand that the menu changes slightly from time to time so to have a traditional paper menu is not practical. Â You basically order the meat by the pound and the service folks will prepare it right in front of you. Â Once you have your food you can move over to the bar to grab one of the craft beers or whatever. Â There is a ton of seating in either room so its pretty cool. Â Now to the food..... Â Like I've said probably 20 times in this review the food is AMAZING. Â This is not only my opinion but the opinion of many local and even national food critics. Â Billy (the owner/ pit master) has participated and competed in BBQ contests throughout the country. Â I was actually bummed to find out he wouldn't be there for my reception but Lianna informed us he was actually in Memphis for Memphis in May (for you that don't know what that is, it's one of the largest BBQ competitions in the country). Â Pretty good excuse to not be around. Â Either way, the food, regardless of what you order is phenomenal. Â My personal favorite is the Beef Rib. Â Costing around 35 bucks for a whole beef rib may seem expensive, but when you see the size of it your concerns will be dispelled. Â They are absolutely gigantic! Â The only way I can describe the way it tastes is imagine eating the best porterhouse steak you have ever had and couple that with the texture and tenderness of Filet Mignon. Â It is out of this world. Â Hometown is also know for their brisket (having won the brisket category in the Kingsford invitational this year) and it is really really good. Â I have eaten brisket at all the big brisket places in NYC (Fette Sau, Blue Smoke, Dinosaur, etc) and Hometown's can't even be compared. Â A really cool aspect of NYC BBQ is that there is not a set standard so BIlly and the other pit guys at Hometown can really play with different ideas for their BBQ and take some of the influence from the different areas of the country and make it their own. Â Moving on the the other menu items, the other ribs are awesome (the even have jerk baby backs which being in Brooklyn is a cool shoutout to the Caribbean population) and the spare ribs are fall off the bone. Â The other menu item that you are committing a sin if you don't order on every visit it the siracha wings. Â Blended with the perfect smoke taste and tang from the sauce, these are the best wings I have ever had in my life. Overall, Hometown is one of, if not my favorite restaurant in NYC. Â Not only are the staff and owners amazing people, they really hit the BBQ genre of food on the head. Â I can't say enough good things about this place. Â AND if anyone out there ever had the idea of have a wedding reception in a fun out of the box way, this place is a great place to check out.",5.0

"Came on a Saturday night. Live music by JD Patch was great. Place was lively a lot of people having a good time drinking and eating. This place is a little off the beaten path, but it's probably a blessing in disguide because if this place was closer to the masses it would be too busy and crowded to have a good time. Parking also was a lot easier given the proximity. Â  Â  Down to the food. I cannot say enough good things about quality control here. The owner was constantly checking on the meat to make sure it was served to his liking. Barbecue is a cuisine that is easy to get wrong. Everything has to be smoked perfectly. Too much or too little and it is not right. The line moves a little slowly as they have everyone going to one station to get their meat and sides, but it wasn't too bad. It took me about 15 minutes to get to the front of the line. I am sure during non-peak times it is a lot faster. Bartenders waited on my quickly. Â  Â  We tried to get a little bit of everything because I am huge fan of the food and have travelled to various parts of the country to eat it. We had, brisket, spare ribs, jerk ribs, pastrami bacon, and jalapeno sausage. The brisket was perfectly smoked. It has the perfect amount of fat and the seasoning was really good. Very juicy. Spare ribs just had salt and pepper and were also done well. The jerk ribs had a nice flavor and the patrami bacon was very good too. The sausages which are made on premesis were one of my favorite parts of the meal. Â  Â  Side orders were also very good. Some barbecue places don't pay as much attention to the sides as they worry more about meat. This is not the case here. The mac and cheese is really good. Burnet end baked beans had I nice sweet flavor and big chunks of burnt ends. We also had slaw and potato salad which were solid. Great selection of alcohol and beer as well. Â  Â  I had a great time at hometown and will come back again soon. I am glad the owner goes through great lengths to make sure his product is superb because real barbecue fans can be unforgiving. They are doing barbecue justice. Good job.",5.0
"I'll start by saying we drove from Staten Island to Red Hook Brooklyn to try this place, and I'll end by repeating it was worth every mile and maybe 20 more.You order by the pound here, and while you discuss your options Billy (the owner) is handing you samples to get the BEST idea of what you'd like. We had the half hog, brisket, and beef run with a side of corn bread, cole slaw and beans.Every item can be cut with a fork and downed with a perfect beer pairing.hooray for authentic family owned wonders like Billy and Hometown BBQ",5.0

"In Brooklyn's fair city Where the girls are so prettyI met a nice woman named Molly MaloneWe talked about 'cue andWe'd both tried a few andShe sent me to Home Town to try the brisket.""Oh try, oh try-oOh try, oh try-o,It's melty! and smoky! so try, oh try-o.""She was right -- the brisket was exceptional. Also very good: jerk baby back ribs. Lamb belly was smoky & tasty; pork belly was tender but not exciting. As others have reported, the kitchen was out of beef ribs before the dinner rush had even begun, and I wish they'd resolve that issue. Molly Malone had told me the sides were...just fine, and for the most part I found them unexceptional, though I liked the vinegary cole slaw a lot, and the whiskey pickles were good too. The corn bread's sort of cakelike -- sweet and dense. But really, it's the brisket that wins the show -- so wherever you are, Molly Malone, thank you for the tip.",4.0
"Absolutely amazing brisket! Â I went to a party catered by Hometown BBQ a couple weeks ago and after several portions of brisket, jerk baby back ribs, mac and cheese later i was a believer. Â My wife and i went out to Red Hook today to fill ourselves with everything we could related to BBQ. Â Empty stomachs prepped for the challenge we ordered brisket, full rack of jerk baby backs, 9 pork and brisket tacos(what a treat), mac + cheese, smoked pit beans, collard greens, Hometown slaw, Whiskey sour pickles. Â Yeah that was just for two of us :). Â Shiner Bock, IPA, pilsner, couple of Evan Williams with pickle back shots later and we had a few ribs to take home for later. Â  These guys know what they are doing. Â It is only a matter of time before you see trophies and banners lining the walls with wins at BBQ competitions. Â I spend a lot of time in BBQ places around the country and can say without hesitation the brisket is the best i have had. Â The tacos were a surprise and refreshing break between bites of pure brisket heaven. Â Oh thats right half of them were brisket tacos :).

"Craving some real good beef brisket for the last few days, i yelped this place out since i was in nearby Dumbo. Having had spectacular brisket from a food truck a few weeks before, my bar was set high.Out of several in-a-row mediocre eating experiences, i was really hoping this Red Hook hipster eatery would get my thumbs up, unfortunately i was again disappointed. The few quick reviews i read (very positive) didn't prepare me for the huge Saturday evening line out the door to the order window (about a 45 minute wait) , or the lack of table service. It took us about 5 minutes to get oriented, and figure out how this weird place worked (just get on line like cattle to slaughter).While waiting on line, one nervously looks around the establishment trying to eyeball a seat, there were four of us, and the long beer festival hall tables didn't make the task easy. Once at the order ""window"" the ""butcher"" asks you what you want, and cuts off pieces of it, and weighs it right on the spot. The meat prices average $25-$30 a pound. Some things were cheaper, like the sausage, which they ran out of .The beef ribs are $25 a pound, bone and all (are you f*cking kidding me?!?) were too rich for my blood to even try. Though I suspect if its like everything else I tried, good thing I didn't waste my money.So we ordered we ordered the beef brisket, dark Chipotle chicken, lamb & pork belly, and a side of Mac n Cheese ($8 for large). Out of all those things, the cheesy mac was the best tasting, garnering a 7/10 on my subjective taste scale.The Brisket was just ok, at a 6/10. Not even close to the cheaper and much better brisket I had from the food truck. I hate myself for not remembering what it was called.The lamb belly was very dry, and had no taste (though it had a spicy rub) 3/10The pork belly was dry and tasteless too 2/10The chipotle chicken was spicy and decent tasting, but super dry 3/10My friends pulled pork had no taste, and a weird mushy consistency 2/10Their potato salad (is that what it was??) had a weird tangy-mixed with coleslaw type formula. I kinda liked it, but it was weird nonetheless 4/10Other notes...The cashier didnt say thank you when I was done ordering and gave this kidults their due tip.The banjo playing band from Flyoverlandia, sucked.Parking took a little time to find (Saturday night, and lots of other establishments in the area).On the plus side, the beer was good.All in all I spent close to a C note and was very disappointed.Though I've never had Dallas BBQ's brisket, their Beef ribs are AWESOME, and you get a huge rack (like 3-4 pounds) for 15 bucks, with a bunch of sides. How these hometown a-holes can charge $25 a pound (thats like 1-2 ribs) for beef, is beyond me.Tommy says skip it.",1.0

"Wanted to love this place based on reviews but this place nor food comes near a five star. Firstly, waiting one hour in line to place an order is unacceptable.

"On Sunday, August 31 at roughly 12:30pm, we had a nice first time lunch at Hometown BBQ. It took 15 minutes wait time, which according to many of the lower-starred-reviews here, is pretty quick. When we arrived, there happened to be a lull in the line, so we were fourth walking in. Soon thereafter the line wrapped around the American flagged brick wall to the outside door, and luckily remained inside, as it was almost as hot outside as inside the BBQ cooker. Rows of dining tables were implausibly empty in a two-roomed restaurant which serves at least 100.I can see why ""the wait,"" and I wouldn't want to chance a return for a Thursday to Saturday night dinner to wait an hour to eat: there is only one station on the left for cutting up the meat, and the right side of the counter serves the sides and collects the money. With a second station, Hometown could easily be selling twice as fast and as much, and satisfying that many more devotees, who have trekked from their hometown to the very ends of Red Hook. Why frustrate them? Perhaps they need to ration the precious portions of meat carefully smoked the night before...In the most time consuming part of the serving process, the cutter carefully weighs all of the portions in front of you, although you don't get to see the scale weight. I guess they want to avoid controversy.And once arriving at the serving counter, you better know exactly everything you want to order, because you won't be coming back for seconds or dessert until the next time you dine here. Â Of course you've had plenty of time to think about and prepare your order: the menu is written on the butcher paper hung on the wall next to where you are standing.The counter service is friendly and efficient enough. There was room for a tip on the invoice, in addition to the cash tip cup, which I guess like at Katz's Deli, is a tradition for the cutters. Â With waiting on line, bringing my tray to the table, and cleaning up, I thought I deserved a tip too. They took my debit card, I signed on the dotted line, but I did not receive a receipt (I forgot to ask as I salivated over my tray.)I ordered the BBQ basics for two: Â 1/2 pound brisket, 4 spare ribs, 2 corn breads, the Texan creamy mac 'n cheese, and the Hometown (cole) slaw, for just under $50. We were not disappointed. Everything, including the free cold water, was fresh, tasty and excellently prepared and flavored. If we two had alcohol, the bill would have easily been $70+, which is far from outrageous for lunch, let alone dinner, in NYC. The paper-lined-aluminum-sheet-pan looked appropriately filled with food, but my wife wondered how we would finish it all, while I wondered whether it would really be enough. It was just about right. We will return...",4.0

"Is sort of given up on NYC BBQ (including waiting in line for salt lick once a year in Madison square park). But this place solves all my problems. Red hook is the perfect spot for this place that looks like a cross between an old warehouse, firehouse, smokehouse. Whatever it is, the brisket is so dope. Go here then take a walk to the pier. Or don't, and go to Sunnys to drink instead.",5.0
The food is good but the line to make an order and actually get your food is crazy. And if you want something more you should stay in line again . Like in McDonald. It is not cheap place . They should have waiters service.,3.0
"Cornbread is my weakness, and good cornbread will make up for everything else that's lacking - but that's not to say that there's anything lacking at Hometown, because there isn't. That IS to say that Hometown's cornbread is thus far my favorite cornbread in NYC. John Brown is a close second. If you know of better, tell me now.Hometown operates by counter service. You wait in line, and unfortunately, the line is often long and slow, but once you reach the counter, you order your food, and right away, they start loading up your tray. Watch them slice your brisket real nice, slap a tangled juicy mess of pulled pork, throw on a few ribs, a few sides, and don't forget that slice of cornbread. Before you know it, there's a mountain of food in front of you, and you're salivating as you head back to your seat.So what should your mountain look like? Get that moist brisket, because you want it juicy. You're at a BBQ joint. If you were concerned about dieting, you wouldn't be here in the first place.. Â While you're at it, get the pulled pork as well, which is just as tender, juicy and smoky as the brisket. Personally, as a general matter, I prefer pulled pork over brisket, so the pork was the winner for me. The ribs are a solid choice as well - falls right off the bone, flavorful, and juicy. Not much else you can ask for. AND DON'T FORGET THE CORN BREAD.I didn't think the jerk chicken was that memorable. It was dry and underwhelming in comparison to the rest of the meats. That being said, I'm actually not a big chicken fan when it comes to barbecue, and it's often the last thing on the tray that I eat, mainly because it requires more effort, and if I'm at a barbecue joint, I'm hungry, and ain't nobody got time for that! Nonetheless, I seem to order it time and time again, if not just to try it; but because it's the last thing I eat, I'm oftentimes full, and maybe I don't enjoy it as much as I could have, had I started my meal with it, so take my assessment of it for what you will.",5.0
"OMG that lamb belly!!! I went here once and it felt reasonably priced. I went here again and it felt super expensive. I can't tell how I feel about the pricing. But the lamb belly is amazing -- if it's available (which it seems like it only is sometimes) GET IT! And Hometown, a request -- make it available all the time!! My girlfriend and I have talked about it many times since we had it. It's amazing.The sides were pretty lackluster, with the exception of the cornbread and the queso mac n' cheese. It's like a mix between mac n cheese and texas style queso, and I really enjoyed it.All the meat was delicious. I liked everything I tried. I don't really think the gigantic beef ribs are really worth the cost though, I'd stick with the pulled pork, brisket, and that amazing lamb belly!Oh I almost forgot, my biggest complaint was the slow pace of the line. They only have one person cutting meat and one person ringing people up, and it's just kind of slow. Not sure what they could do to fix that but they should make it a priority, maybe take a hint from Mighty Quinn's which has a similar setup but somehow manages to make it snappy?",5.0

"I read many of the reviews after my first visit. Â For those that complain about the trek, it's not that bad, especially when you consider that to get BBQ as authentic as this Texas style BBQ you will be traveling to Louie Muellers in Taylor, TX. You are all very lucky to have this within a 25 mile radius. Â Being from Buffalo this is definitely closer than Texas and one of the main reasons I came to NY this New Years.Where to start. Â I went to Hill Country, Delaney BBQ and Hometown while I was here in NYC. Â Hometown was by far the best in terms of quality and representation of what Texas BBQ is. Â I've spent weeks in and around Austin, TX traveling and eating BBQ. Â I mean it when I say that this place scratches that itch you get from central Texas BBQ withdraw.Brisket (both fatty and lean), pulled pork, sausage and beef rib, oh the beef rib, were all superb. Â The brisket had an amazing smoky flavor that is next to impossible to find outside of Texas. Â Oak and beef go together like peanut butter and jelly or wine and chocolate. Â The fat was rendered amazingly on all the meats. Â The bark was spot on, well formed, not dry. Â The beef rib, which has been catching on in popularity in the last year outside of central Texas, was nothing short of a must have. Â If you have never had one, just order it. Â It never ceases to amaze when it's plopped on your butcher paper. Â It's like a brontosaurus rib or as I like to refer to it, steak on a stick. Â Seriously though, this meat takes well to slow cooking. When eating a beef rib it's better to just pick it apart with your fingers rather than try to eat it off the bone. Â The meat is juicy, succulent and velvety with interlaced fat. Â If rendered correctly, in only a way that slow cooking in a smoker can, you will be rewarded with fat that melts like butter in your mouth. Â And since fat absorbs aromas it will carry all of that luscious smoke right to your brain. Â This makes it on my death row meal list.The atmosphere is great and does a service to the BBQ joint of Texas. Â Although it is impossible to recreate the years of history and culture of the Texas meat market turned BBQ joints it is possible to pay homage to them. Â Hometown does this well but still in a way that New Yorkers can connect with. Â Red Hook is alive here.Staff was friendly and knowledgeable. Â They knew what I was looking for when rambling off the cuts I wanted. Â Served an au gratis piece of fatty brisket as a way to sample the pit mans skill and sacrifice is a way for them to say ""It's good and you will think so too"". I've been to Fette Sau and other Brooklyn BBQ joints in the past. Â They are good especially compared to what's offered in Buffalo. Â However, in my opinion this is the holy smoke of Brooklyn central Texas style BBQ. Â Make the trip, get out of your neighborhood and see what Red Hook has to offer. Â You won't be disappointed.",5.0

The mac and cheese is delish but thats about it in terms of sides. 5 stars for the bar though!",3.0
Great food. Informal atmosphere. Brisket is melt in ur mouth good.,4.0
"Is sort of given up on NYC BBQ (including waiting in line for salt lick once a year in Madison square park). But this place solves all my problems. Red hook is the perfect spot for this place that looks like a cross between an old warehouse, firehouse, smokehouse. Whatever it is, the brisket is so dope. Go here then take a walk to the pier. Or don't, and go to Sunnys to drink instead.",5.0
The food is good but the line to make an order and actually get your food is crazy. And if you want something more you should stay in line again . Like in McDonald. It is not cheap place . They should have waiters service.,3.0
"Cornbread is my weakness, and good cornbread will make up for everything else that's lacking - but that's not to say that there's anything lacking at Hometown, because there isn't. That IS to say that Hometown's cornbread is thus far my favorite cornbread in NYC. John Brown is a close second. If you know of better, tell me now.Hometown operates by counter service. You wait in line, and unfortunately, the line is often long and slow, but once you reach the counter, you order your food, and right away, they start loading up your tray. Watch them slice your brisket real nice, slap a tangled juicy mess of pulled pork, throw on a few ribs, a few sides, and don't forget that slice of cornbread. Before you know it, there's a mountain of food in front of you, and you're salivating as you head back to your seat.So what should your mountain look like? Get that moist brisket, because you want it juicy. You're at a BBQ joint. If you were concerned about dieting, you wouldn't be here in the first place.. Â While you're at it, get the pulled pork as well, which is just as tender, juicy and smoky as the brisket. Personally, as a general matter, I prefer pulled pork over brisket, so the pork was the winner for me. The ribs are a solid choice as well - falls right off the bone, flavorful, and juicy. Not much else you can ask for. AND DON'T FORGET THE CORN BREAD.I didn't think the jerk chicken was that memorable. It was dry and underwhelming in comparison to the rest of the meats. That being said, I'm actually not a big chicken fan when it comes to barbecue, and it's often the last thing on the tray that I eat, mainly because it requires more effort, and if I'm at a barbecue joint, I'm hungry, and ain't nobody got time for that! Nonetheless, I seem to order it time and time again, if not just to try it; but because it's the last thing I eat, I'm oftentimes full, and maybe I don't enjoy it as much as I could have, had I started my meal with it, so take my assessment of it for what you will.",5.0
"OMG that lamb belly!!! I went here once and it felt reasonably priced. I went here again and it felt super expensive. I can't tell how I feel about the pricing. But the lamb belly is amazing -- if it's available (which it seems like it only is sometimes) GET IT! And Hometown, a request -- make it available all the time!! My girlfriend and I have talked about it many times since we had it. It's amazing.The sides were pretty lackluster, with the exception of the cornbread and the queso mac n' cheese. It's like a mix between mac n cheese and texas style queso, and I really enjoyed it.All the meat was delicious. I liked everything I tried. I don't really think the gigantic beef ribs are really worth the cost though, I'd stick with the pulled pork, brisket, and that amazing lamb belly!Oh I almost forgot, my biggest complaint was the slow pace of the line. They only have one person cutting meat and one person ringing people up, and it's just kind of slow. Not sure what they could do to fix that but they should make it a priority, maybe take a hint from Mighty Quinn's which has a similar setup but somehow manages to make it snappy?",5.0
Didn't like to get in line for food and then another line for beverage.. Â Food is comparable to any other good bbq around but this one is overpriced if you take in the travel time in consideration... I can get better service closer to home...,3.0
"I read many of the reviews after my first visit. Â For those that complain about the trek, it's not that bad, especially when you consider that to get BBQ as authentic as this Texas style BBQ you will be traveling to Louie Muellers in Taylor, TX. You are all very lucky to have this within a 25 mile radius. Â Being from Buffalo this is definitely closer than Texas and one of the main reasons I came to NY this New Years.Where to start. Â I went to Hill Country, Delaney BBQ and Hometown while I was here in NYC. Â Hometown was by far the best in terms of quality and representation of what Texas BBQ is. Â I've spent weeks in and around Austin, TX traveling and eating BBQ. Â I mean it when I say that this place scratches that itch you get from central Texas BBQ withdraw.Brisket (both fatty and lean), pulled pork, sausage and beef rib, oh the beef rib, were all superb. Â The brisket had an amazing smoky flavor that is next to impossible to find outside of Texas. Â Oak and beef go together like peanut butter and jelly or wine and chocolate. Â The fat was rendered amazingly on all the meats. Â The bark was spot on, well formed, not dry. Â The beef rib, which has been catching on in popularity in the last year outside of central Texas, was nothing short of a must have. Â If you have never had one, just order it. Â It never ceases to amaze when it's plopped on your butcher paper. Â It's like a brontosaurus rib or as I like to refer to it, steak on a stick. Â Seriously though, this meat takes well to slow cooking. When eating a beef rib it's better to just pick it apart with your fingers rather than try to eat it off the bone. Â The meat is juicy, succulent and velvety with interlaced fat. Â If rendered correctly, in only a way that slow cooking in a smoker can, you will be rewarded with fat that melts like butter in your mouth. Â And since fat absorbs aromas it will carry all of that luscious smoke right to your brain. Â This makes it on my death row meal list.The atmosphere is great and does a service to the BBQ joint of Texas. Â Although it is impossible to recreate the years of history and culture of the Texas meat market turned BBQ joints it is possible to pay homage to them. Â Hometown does this well but still in a way that New Yorkers can connect with. Â Red Hook is alive here.Staff was friendly and knowledgeable. Â They knew what I was looking for when rambling off the cuts I wanted. Â Served an au gratis piece of fatty brisket as a way to sample the pit mans skill and sacrifice is a way for them to say ""It's good and you will think so too"". I've been to Fette Sau and other Brooklyn BBQ joints in the past. Â They are good especially compared to what's offered in Buffalo. Â However, in my opinion this is the holy smoke of Brooklyn central Texas style BBQ. Â Make the trip, get out of your neighborhood and see what Red Hook has to offer. Â You won't be disappointed.",5.0

"Hello meat lovers! This place is the bomb!!! Was recommended to me by a friend after an exiting trip to ikea which is only a few minutes away by car. First of all, the place is huge!

The menu is very small and could be written on your hand :) I had the lamb sandwich, they made a Vietnamese version of it with daikon and cilantro, super greesy but oh so heavenly. My husband got the pulled jerked chicken, so flavorful, light but rich. We had a side of fantastic beans. So fantastic we bought a large cup to go. Can't wait for my next visit.

"Two out of the three meats we sampled rate five stars, hence Â the rating. Brisket lovingly trimmed and fondled for moistness was as good as I've come across.

Cole slaw was fresh and not overly sauced, just not as spectacular as the greens and beans. Drinks from the bar were good if service could have been friendlier. No such problem at the meat counter.It would be nice if there was some white bread to make sandwiches out of the brisket or pork in true Southern fashion. You can have the bbq as a pre-made sandwich but that strikes me as a bit inauthentic.

"I came here just under a month ago. I think it might just have made me a BBQ addict because I've been chasing the deliciousness high going to way too many BBQ spots in the last few weeks. None have compared thus far.I went with a big group and it's my favorite way to enjoy BBQ sicne it helps you keep costs down (sort of) while still getting a chance to try as much as you'd like. At Hometown, we tried almost everything. Brisket - we started with the moist brisket and it was just about the best thing I've ever tasted. Juciy, meaty flavor on the inside with a perfect coating of smokyness and seasoning. I went up the second time and they had run out of the moist brisket so I begrudingly ordered the lean. It was amazing! I normally dislike lean brisket and I thoroughly enjoyed this one which means they're doing something right in their seasoning/smoking.Pulled Pork - this is usually my go to for BBQ. It's my control for the experiment of how good a place is. Hometown passed with flying colors. Moist and well soaked but still has that meatiness you go to BBQ for. Jerk Ribs - I love jerk seasoning on basically everything and I was glad this was an option. Thing is, it's still BBQ which was a pleasant surprise. They didn't try and force the seasoning and just let it mix well with the smokiness. I say you must get some if you're here.Lamb - Holy Lamb of God! This was amazing. I like lamb so I might be a bit biased but this was unlike anything I've ever tasted. Absolutely tender like lamb usually is and perfectly smoked. I think you can see a pattern here.Sides - We got a bunch of sides and they were all pretty great or amazing. Mac and Cheese was okay. I've had better but still a very delicious side. The real winners in my opinion were the pickles which weren't too pickled, the coleslaw which I'm usually picky about, and the #1 side was the beans. Those beans were an explosion of flavour that complimented the meat perfectly. Now, for some negatives. I doubt their ability optimize their menu. We went on a Thursday evening at about 7pm. It was empty and we luckily didn't have to wait at all. As soon as we started eating the line grew but it never got too crazy. Still, when I went up to order the second time, they had run out of nearly everything and the place was never really packed. This would make me question taking the trip out to Red Hook.For that reason, I questioned not giving a 5 star rating. The reason I settled on a 4 is because I've never had BBQ in Texas or the Deep South so I'm guessing those might still be better. I'm keeping my ability to call those a 5 open. If not for that small hope, this place would get a 5 without a question.The people are great. I met the manager and he was just about the coolest guy ever. I'll head back once I've finished my New York City BBQ quest. So far, this is the clear winner.",4.0
"Bumping up to a 4-star. The beans are superb, so my experience with the sides here has been very positive. Also had the pulled pork this time (good but not memorably so) and the lamb belly (really unique and flavorful, though I wouldn't do more than 1/4 lb per person of it).,",4.0

"If you like long reviews, read on. If not: CORNBREAD CORNBREAD CORNBREAD. Everything else? Eh. Collard greens notably bad. With that said, here's the rest: If you're at all familiar with brisket don't expect too much from Hometown. The fatty brisket (the very enthusiastic and helpful man often behind the counter will help) is the variety to try. Unfortunately, the brisket just lacks flavor--one is compelled, one MUST put the sauce on, or it won't be worth the horrific journey to Red Hook. Luckily the various sauces available are of high quality--find the one that's right for you and you'll be happy. Avoid the jerk chicken which is dry and generally just not very good, even bland, like the attempt of an Illinois housewife or househusband to ""spice things up!""; obviously for jerk you're much better off making a trip to Crown Heights or Jamaica. Let's discuss the sides. They do a weird number where you order meat, then sides--it's just confusing, an unsound method. The collard greens, otherwise one of the delights of life, are to be avoided. They are bitter, almost sour--the taste is totally bizarre and just not the way greens are supposed to taste, full of the languid flavor of summer. The greens were also undercooked. The baked beans were unhappy in their own unique ways, as was the mac n cheese--disappointing. I note this because Hometown isn't particularly cheap, and these sides are simply not worth ordering. What is worth ordering, however, is the CORNBREAD. Wow. One of the five best cornbreads I've eaten, up there with Nashville, TN, Atlanta, Birmingham, and Memphis--real cornbread country. Honestly it would be worth the trip down to Red Hook just for the cornbread. And you could order enough for the week. Now there's an idea...In general, Hometown is kind of overpriced and not very good. But it has redeeming qualities, like the very friendly people behind the counter (they'll convince you to order more than you need, beware), the bbq sauces, and the cornbread. If you find yourself in Red Hook (????) it's not to be missed.",3.0

The reason I settled on a 4 is because I've never had BBQ in Texas or the Deep South so I'm guessing those might still be better. I'm keeping my ability to call those a 5 open. If not for that small hope, this place would get a 5 without a question.The people are great. I met the manager and he was just about the coolest guy ever. I'll head back once I've finished my New York City BBQ quest. So far, this is the clear winner.",4.0
"Bumping up to a 4-star. The beans are superb, so my experience with the sides here has been very positive. Also had the pulled pork this time (good but not memorably so) and the lamb belly (really unique and flavorful, though I wouldn't do more than 1/4 lb per person of it).,",4.0
"Not only was the food AMAZING!!! Â Brisket was incredible, perfectly smoked and moist, Cornbread-Great, slaw, and Mac and cheese, excellent...There's so much more about the owner, Billy. What INTEGRITY!!!!!I was planning a Holiday dinner party on the other side of Brooklyn. Â I placed my order and wanted the food delivered at around 5 for dining at 6:30. Â I offered to send car service. NOT only did he refuse, He PERSONALLY brought the food and demonstrated the right way to slice Brisket along with his adorable daughter and associate.This personal touch and actual CARING about how and when I served his food which was the BEST dinner party I've ever had has made me a total Hometown Devotee!I didn't think this happened anymore.GO THERE!!!!!!!!!! Eat, ENJOY!!!!!!!!!!!!",5.0
"If you like long reviews, read on. If not: CORNBREAD CORNBREAD CORNBREAD. Everything else? Eh. Collard greens notably bad. With that said, here's the rest: If you're at all familiar with brisket don't expect too much from Hometown. The fatty brisket (the very enthusiastic and helpful man often behind the counter will help) is the variety to try. Unfortunately, the brisket just lacks flavor--one is compelled, one MUST put the sauce on, or it won't be worth the horrific journey to Red Hook. Luckily the various sauces available are of high quality--find the one that's right for you and you'll be happy. Avoid the jerk chicken which is dry and generally just not very good, even bland, like the attempt of an Illinois housewife or househusband to ""spice things up!""; obviously for jerk you're much better off making a trip to Crown Heights or Jamaica. Let's discuss the sides. They do a weird number where you order meat, then sides--it's just confusing, an unsound method. The collard greens, otherwise one of the delights of life, are to be avoided. They are bitter, almost sour--the taste is totally bizarre and just not the way greens are supposed to taste, full of the languid flavor of summer. The greens were also undercooked. The baked beans were unhappy in their own unique ways, as was the mac n cheese--disappointing. I note this because Hometown isn't particularly cheap, and these sides are simply not worth ordering. What is worth ordering, however, is the CORNBREAD. Wow. One of the five best cornbreads I've eaten, up there with Nashville, TN, Atlanta, Birmingham, and Memphis--real cornbread country. Honestly it would be worth the trip down to Red Hook just for the cornbread. And you could order enough for the week. Now there's an idea...In general, Hometown is kind of overpriced and not very good. But it has redeeming qualities, like the very friendly people behind the counter (they'll convince you to order more than you need, beware), the bbq sauces, and the cornbread. If you find yourself in Red Hook (????) it's not to be missed.",3.0
"Planned to go to ikea, ended up getting bbq. Got 1/2 pound of lamb belly, brisket sandwich, small coleslaw, and cornbread to share between two people and it was more than enough.

"I live in Red Hook and I think I'm in love. I'm from the South and am a big BBQ fan. I got to hometown tonight grumpy and begrudging the restaurant's ordering process (you order from a pit and can only order meat from one guy and sides from one girl... also they didn't serve pulled pork sandwiches, which dang near took this review down a star) and life in general. I left feeling really happy and friendly. The food is really good. I cut through the brisket with the side of my plastic fork. And the people are nice, even when you're a curmudgeon.

Â Nice beer selection, served in a large mason jar, of course. The just OK:Good cornbread, but I've had better. Â The collards are also tasty.The less than ok:The other sides were quite a let down.

The pickles are meh.This is really a 3.5 star food review rounded to 4 stars due to the sh!t-kicking decor, friendly management, Â outdoor smoker, and live country band.There's a potential for greatness here if they served much better sides.

"delish and completely satisfied my bbq craving. Three very hungry bellies ordered the lamb belly, quarter chicken, spare ribs (3), brisket, mac and cheese, pickles and cornbread (2). The cornbread had this obscene honey glaze baked in. It was rich and dense, not grainy like most cornbreads, almost like a dessert. The highlight of the order though was clearly the brisket. We got 1/2 lb of brisket - came out to a slice of fatty brisket and a slice of lean. Both were melt in your mouth but the fatty brisket won out by a long shot. The lamb belly was incredibly flavorful, not at all gamey but had a little too much grizzle for my taste. Spare ribs didn't even need sauce but weren't quite falloff the bone. Mac was good.

The collard greens were subpar--not much flavor, kind of one-dimensional even with the added pork. We got a small in both and we didn't finish either of these. The cornbread was bland, although the honey on top was a nice touch. I'm knocking off a lot of stars though because the SERVICE WAS BAD. They were unfortunately out of brisket, and there was someone in line that asked the server when the brisket would be ready. The server said he didnt know, that it could be as quick as ""5 minutes"" or as long as ""45 minutes."" The customer then inquired if the server could ask someone in the back for a more accurate timeframe as he was interested in getting some brisket to-go after dining in. The server, visibly annoyed by the customer's further inquiry, didnt even bother to ask the pitmaster and implied that asking would be pointless/a hassle because the pitmaster would have to weigh the meat or something. He didn't sound apologetic or sympathetic to the customer.First of all, if the wait could potentially be as quick as ""5 minutes,"" you should get your hiney to the back and ask. What's the harm? The customer wants to buy more food, and REFUSING to SIMPLY CHECK how long til the next batch of brisket comes out is a SLAP IN THE FACE to that customer.

Seriously, train your middle-aged hipster-wannabe servers correctly with some proper restaurant manners. As for my own order, I think they charged me an extra $13 or so. We got the beef rib ($25), 1/2 lb pulled pork ($11), 2 small sides ($8) and 1 cornbread ($3). The total was a little less than $65. That doesn't add up. Unfortunately, we didn't realize this until we drove off, so we weren't able to bring it up. I guess 13 bucks is no big deal in the end, but considering the aforementioned incident, it annoyed me.

Believe me, one pound of meat could easily mean 3/4 lbs of FAT. Â Come on, I know brisket has some fat, but what I got was RIDICULOUS. The story would have been different If I would have eaten there.

"Hometown is an awesome BBQ place. Better than Fette Sau, Blue Smoke and Dinosaur, although the first two are also great. Dinosaur comes in a distant third. Hometown had the best beef ribs (dry rub) I've ever eaten. One enormous(!) rib could easily feed three people. It was beautifully seasoned, perfectly cooked, nice and crusty with spices on the outside, and tender and juicy inside. Then there was my single favorite dish ever: Â lamb belly. I'd never had it before and now I can't imagine visiting Hometown without ordering it. The minimum order is half a pound, which is enough for two people, because it's so rich. Â However, I've learned to go slow, eat no carbs with it -- who needs cornbread anyway? -- and voila, I've consumed my entire portion and feel absolutely fantastic. Â My body likes meat, what can I say? Â First time around my companion ordered the pork spare ribs, which I sampled, and they get high marks, juicy and sweet with just the right amount of heat. Â Second visit she had the lean brisket, which was too dry. Â Go for the fatty variety instead. Â Fat is good for you.Portions are large and sometimes there are large minimum amounts you have to order. But they provide supplies to wrap up and take home your leftovers. Â Two days later I'm still eating that leftover beef rib and have one more portion before it's all gone.Here's a tip: Â come with a few hungry friends and order several things as a group. Taste everything! You will not need to order as much as you think you do, because of the richness of this food.Oh yes, the collard greens are awesome, the perfect complement to that lamb belly. Â Did I mention the lamb belly?Hometown is very casual and laid-back, with lots of room to park yourself at long wooden tables and pig out. It's got a family vibe, an after-work vibe, a night out with friends vibe, and a date vibe all in one. The guys you order from are enthusiastic and knowledgeable about the food. The place gets very busy and you have to wait on line awhile, so if you can, come on the early side and avoid the crowds. Also I figure It's better to eat early when you eat this food, because you won't want to go to sleep on a full stomach after eating the richest food this side of Texas. 10 stars!",5.0

If I wanted fat, I could of stayed home and eaten a BOX of LARD for 99 cents. I honestly felt ROBBED. We all work hard for the MONEY!THE MEAT CUTTER IS A JERK! Â I know he knows what he was doing. He sold me the fattest portion of the brisket. Â I guess nothing goes to waste HUH? That's how you Â run a Â successful business Â these days folks. Get them for all you can. Meaning us the customers. You have to be fair and serve what the customer pays for. You don't do that to people. You wouldn't want that to happen to you. I'm not stupid, I worked in the food business. He did pull a fast one on me. Warning, if you place an order out to go, check you order before you leave and make sure it's not all fat. Believe me, one pound of meat could easily mean 3/4 lbs of FAT. Â Come on, I know brisket has some fat, but what I got was RIDICULOUS. The story would have been different If I would have eaten there. That mostly FAT brisket order would of went right back to him. Â I would have told him, You Eat IT. He wouldn't have gotten away with that if I eat there. Â Lesson learned. I would say this though, the little meat that I did have was really tasty and delicious. I just wish the meat cutter, Â who ever he is, would have given me what I paid for. If that was the case Â this review would have been much different. I still say the place is a must if you like BBQ, despite my experience.",1.0
Too long a queue for cue (slower than fette sau actually). Brisket was good. Sausages are decent. Ribs not so much. On a lazy slow Saturday it's worth checking out. Otherwise pass.,2.0
"This place serves up some really good BBQ that rivals most of the top places in NYC. Â The brisket is particularly yummy and juicy. Â The ribs are also very moist and flavorful. And their sriracha wings are divine. Â Their sides are pretty yummy too. Â I really like their Cornbread and their Collard Greens. Â Although surprisingly I'm not a huge fan of their mac n cheese, and I love all mac n cheese. Â I think the Texas queso style is not really my style.The service is great too, very friendly! Â One time I was there, my ribs order took a very long time to come out as they had misplaced my ticket. Â The owner was very nice about it and took it off my bill and offered to buy me some drinks.It's a large space with plenty of seating. Â The location is not very convenient, but it's right across from the Fairway in Red Hook and right by the Ikea, so it is still accessible. Â All in all, this is a great BBQ place I definitely recommend you trying!",5.0

Hands down the best BBQ in brooklyn. Smokey and carefully prepared. Awesome seasonings. True love in every bite.,5.0
"OK, the BBQ tour heads to Brooklyn and a nice evening out with the guys. Â Here is the lowdown.... the brisket was well prepared but not smokey, the ribs were babyback and offered in multiple varieties; people including me like the jerk variety better. The St Louis cut ribs were not the real thing. The sides were reasonably well done. Â Nice spot and ambience for a variety of purposes: date, guys night out, etc. All of that said - good. Â A bartender who ignores her customers and is a Â snotty, ""too good to get you a beer"" type should not be in a place like this. Â You bring the place down - and the rating.",3.0
"Hometown is an awesome BBQ place. Better than Fette Sau, Blue Smoke and Dinosaur, although the first two are also great. Dinosaur comes in a distant third. Hometown had the best beef ribs (dry rub) I've ever eaten. One enormous(!) rib could easily feed three people. It was beautifully seasoned, perfectly cooked, nice and crusty with spices on the outside, and tender and juicy inside. Then there was my single favorite dish ever: Â lamb belly. I'd never had it before and now I can't imagine visiting Hometown without ordering it. The minimum order is half a pound, which is enough for two people, because it's so rich. Â However, I've learned to go slow, eat no carbs with it -- who needs cornbread anyway? -- and voila, I've consumed my entire portion and feel absolutely fantastic. Â My body likes meat, what can I say? Â First time around my companion ordered the pork spare ribs, which I sampled, and they get high marks, juicy and sweet with just the right amount of heat. Â Second visit she had the lean brisket, which was too dry. Â Go for the fatty variety instead. Â Fat is good for you.Portions are large and sometimes there are large minimum amounts you have to order. But they provide supplies to wrap up and take home your leftovers. Â Two days later I'm still eating that leftover beef rib and have one more portion before it's all gone.Here's a tip: Â come with a few hungry friends and order several things as a group. Taste everything! You will not need to order as much as you think you do, because of the richness of this food.Oh yes, the collard greens are awesome, the perfect complement to that lamb belly. Â Did I mention the lamb belly?Hometown is very casual and laid-back, with lots of room to park yourself at long wooden tables and pig out. It's got a family vibe, an after-work vibe, a night out with friends vibe, and a date vibe all in one. The guys you order from are enthusiastic and knowledgeable about the food. The place gets very busy and you have to wait on line awhile, so if you can, come on the early side and avoid the crowds. Also I figure It's better to eat early when you eat this food, because you won't want to go to sleep on a full stomach after eating the richest food this side of Texas. 10 stars!",5.0
"This is a great place for barbecue. We had ribs, pulled pork, pulled chicken, sausage, beans. Macaroni salad, coleslaw, and whisky sour pickles. Everything was great. A big open room where you walk up to the counter and order. Â It was not like a cafeteria. It was just a cool atmosphere. They have a bunch of rustic type tables and bar. There was a separate room with a private party going on with a band. Â It seemed like a kids party. I really like barbecue so this place was great for me. If you are not into smoked barbecue it might not be your place. Â They also seemed to be a pretty good beer selection but I didn't sample any. The area alone is worth the trip.

"I attended a private catered event here, but was lucky enough to be served some menu (and not menu) items. The restaurant doesn't open for a couple of weeks, but the food was so freaking fantastic, I had to write a review.The pork belly was tender and mouthwatering with just the right amount of tang added in the sauce. Was it lime? Was it vinegar? It doesn't matter. I was weeping. It was perfect.Chicken breast was moist with a fantastic smoke on the skin. Lots of people at the event were frankly going chicken crazy, prosthelytizing about how mouth-watering and perfect it was. You would think God was in the chicken. It was that good. The beef rib (which is not on the regular menu, I am told) was so delectable and had a really satisfying bark. I really hope Billy, the owner/chef Â offers this as a special, because, damn....DAMN. I'll be dreaming about it. Sides were mac and cheese and baked beans. The mac and cheese was rich, salty, satisfying and sprinkled with bacon. I think you can opt out of the bacon, but why would you? The beans were AMAZING. They were pretty spicy and at least 50% butterbeans. I thought that was a nice twist on a classic side that I don't usually care that much about. The atmosphere Â was really fun and casual. Long tables and chairs give the room a picnic feel. There is a back room, possibly for events and private parties. Perfect for live music, which I hope happens often. Seriously, I can't recommend this place enough. Great place for a group of friends to grab some beers or a plate of bbq.

"I live in Red Hook and have been waiting for this place to open for months. My boyfriend tried the jalapeno and cheese sausage at Red Hook Flicks over the summer and swore we'd be there on opening night, and we were! We braved a thunderstorm, and it was well worth it. I don't eat red meat, so I was very happy to see that they have jerk chicken and a few meatless sides on the menu. The chicken was amazing. Sweet and very spicy. Based on the prices, I went ahead and ordered a half instead of a quarter and it was so much meat that I took a whole quarter home. My boyfriend got the half hog and another sausage (because he said it was too good to not get again), and he said they were both fantastic. My mac n' cheese was super yummy as well. Very reasonable prices for the quality. And they have a full bar with a decent beer selection. The ordering system for food at the counter and drinks from the bar is a bit odd. You order food and pay at one side of the room, and then drinks can either be ordered at the bar or brought to you by waitstaff and paid for there. I think they might need to figure out a clearer system in the days to come, but as for opening-night hiccups there were few in sight. Really friendly service and delicious BBQ.

However there were plenty of ice and fruit bits that. If I had been thirsty or eating I would have not been able to put a dent in my thirst. I want to say that Bill the owner is very nice and accommodated me with my disability. Â I will be back .... Â During the afternoon weekdays tues-thurs when it a little quieter. .",5.0
"I had a recent lunch there. The interior looks rustic and industrial given the area. It's a large space that's been converted into a restaurant/bar with minimal effort. Ambience is okay but nothing to write home about. The line to order is slow and pedantic as if they plan on having only a handful of customers at any given time. Â The food was unique but also overpriced. They give a half pound of meat but no bread. The quality and taste of the pulled pork was average. The Jalapeno sausage tasted more like a spicy meatloaf. The cornbread was dry. The 3"" pie was 6.50. Drinks have to be purchased separately from the bar. The line pretty much killed the place. Should have spent the time I wasted in line to walk to dinosaur bbq.",2.0
"I almost don't want to write this review because I want to keep this place all to myself but I simply have to do it. HOMETOWN is by far, without a doubt, the best BBQ in NYC. No exaggeration here - the best. We had the Brisket and the Baby Backs and I have never had anything this good in NYC. The closest I have tasted to this was Blacks and Salt Lick both in Texas and honestly, I think Hometown was better. (we also had the cornbread and Collard Greens which were equally amazing.)To put it plainly, Hometown is what you imagine bbq should taste like and more.Now my only fear is that it will get to crowded and I wont be able to eat there as often as I want.",5.0
"Was there last Sunday and the brisket was so succulent and delicious I had to bring a group there this evening to see what I was raving about.The brisket was dry. It came out of a tight plastic bag like from some deli meat counter, the spare ribs were very dry too. the lighting was so bad at the counter couldn't see it being cut. All I know Is we tasted was nothing like what I had on Sunday. Everyone was so disappointed no one is going back :(Consistency is so important. Also don't go before 7 pm unless u have toddlers because it is kiddy city. Lots of kids whining and running amok. If the food was good wouldn't have cared. Â I so wanted to rave about this place :((",1.0
"I tried the brisket and the pork ribs tonight. These were a little drier than I expected. You have to eat it with the BBQ sauce and hot sauce for it to be enjoyable. However, the mac n cheese and corn bread were delicious. It's worth checking out, but not worth the cost. Maybe they will get better in time.",3.0
"There is a first time for everything and if you're going to try brisket for the first time, Hometown Bar-B-Que is the place to do it. Billy, the owner might be working the pit and serve you personally. Don't be afraid of his tattooed, 6'3"" presence, since he's one of the most personable restaurant owners in the business. The warehouse-style, rustic decor fits perfectly with the Red Hook up-and-coming neighborhood. Note that the entrance is on Reed street.The bartenders were a bit overwhelmed, but hopefully they'll get the swing of things by the Grand Opening in September 12th.",5.0
"I'm looking at some of the reviews below and I would probably say that my two stars are the result of bad timing. Â Unfortunate, but these things happen.A bit of a trek, for sure, but we were hanging out with friends who live in Carroll Garden and had a car so it was no big deal.The setup is not unlike Hill Country, in that it's cafeteria style (you go get your vittles from the guy behind the counter, etc.) and there's a room with a stage for live music.It was a Saturday and we got there at 8:30ish and maybe got on the food line at 8:45. Â By the time we got to the front, they had run out of half the items on the menu. Â This is somewhat of a problem if your menu only has like five items on it.They were out of the pulled pork and the baby back ribs when we got to the front. Â Additionally, I believe we snagged the last of the jalapeno sausages. Â On top of that, the beef ribs we got were extremely fatty. Â The brisket was not bad.On the plus side, the drinks were great. Â They have a good selection of booze and suds and the bartenders were fun.So, while I won't be going back there anytime soon, if you're going to check it out, my suggestion would be to go early.",2.0
"I live in Red Hook and have been waiting for this place to open for months. My boyfriend tried the jalapeno and cheese sausage at Red Hook Flicks over the summer and swore we'd be there on opening night, and we were! We braved a thunderstorm, and it was well worth it. I don't eat red meat, so I was very happy to see that they have jerk chicken and a few meatless sides on the menu. The chicken was amazing. Sweet and very spicy. Based on the prices, I went ahead and ordered a half instead of a quarter and it was so much meat that I took a whole quarter home. My boyfriend got the half hog and another sausage (because he said it was too good to not get again), and he said they were both fantastic. My mac n' cheese was super yummy as well. Very reasonable prices for the quality. And they have a full bar with a decent beer selection. The ordering system for food at the counter and drinks from the bar is a bit odd. You order food and pay at one side of the room, and then drinks can either be ordered at the bar or brought to you by waitstaff and paid for there. I think they might need to figure out a clearer system in the days to come, but as for opening-night hiccups there were few in sight. Really friendly service and delicious BBQ. Welcome to the neighborhood, Hometown!",5.0
Favorite BBQ in the entirety of NYC. It's perfection. Staff and owner are super nice and truly seem to care about providing the best possible food and atmosphere.I only wish they served lunch. And dessert. And that the subway were closer.,5.0
"Very disappointed with this place the fact that they weigh the meat should indicate something, my husband had the 1/2 pound pork belly which was more fat than meat and I had the 1/2 pound brisket, taste wise it was pretty good but the portions are to small for the price. The fact that you go to the counter and order your own food and they have paper plates and you seat yourself they could do a little better on the servings. In our opinion not worth it and won't be going back.",2.0
"Pros:Chocolate pudding cakeKey lime pieMac and cheeseCons:Waited 45 minutes on line to hear that they were SOLD OUT of beef ribs, beans, collard greens and root beer.

"This place is FANTASTIC. We got there late and the owner spoke to us for a bit. It was too late to seat us but he gave us a free sample. The sample was a full meal and it was by far the best BBQ I've had in the northeast. The brisket was thick, well rubbed, and moist. The sausage was mouth-watering. By far the best thing was the BBQ baked beans. The sauce was meaty, thick, and so tangy. I was left craving more. I liked the mac and cheese, but the only thing I would improve is make the mac and cheese a bit sharper. But that's just me. My friend really liked the mac and cheese as it was.I cannot wait to go back. This will be a place I crave.",5.0

"Here's what I tried & what my impressions were:MEAT:1) BRISKET- I had the moist, or fatty brisket..I must say, this was the superstar of the group..Perfectly moist, and smoked to perfection, with the right flavoring. Â Another 2 times that I went though, the brisket was dry. Â There may be a consistency issue here. Â At $28 a pound for inconsistent brisket? Â I'm not taking any chances by ordering this.2) LAMB BELLY- moist, but otherwise uneventful.3) BABY BACK RIBS- Dry & bland..Lacked big-time in the flavoring department. They need to go back to the drawing board on these. Â 4) BEEF RIBS- Flavorful like the beef brisket, but not as enjoyable because the skin was a bit too tough & the meat under it was a bit rough in certain sections & unflavorful. Â This indicates that either the meat was overcooked, or cooked a while ago & kept warm, to the point where it dried out.They also sell you like a 1/2 pound bone with the meat, & the portions are usually at least 2 pounds..So at 25-30 dollars a pound, (or whatever exactly they're charging for it -don't quite remember) it's totally not worth it to shell out at least $50 for a piece of meat with a Flintstones-sized bone attached to it.SIDES:1) MAC & Cheese- Â Creamy & enjoyable, although one time I tried it, the cheddar cheese was watery because they ran out & were rushing it out of the kitchen.2) Backyard potato salad- Â Very uneventful..Tasted as if it were store-bought.3) Baked cornbread- Delicious but reminded me of something in Greek cuisine which is considered a dessert, Â instead of real baked cornbread. Â As a point of comparison, I use ""John Brown Smokehouse"" 's cornbread-casserole as the gold-star measuring point for what real cornbread should taste like.

From my other experiences @ quality bbq joints, the ballpark figure for food for 2 should be around $40-50 (not including drinks) Another thing that irked me was the cheap quality plastic utensils..I understand if your theme is on-the-go bbq on a paper sheet, & metal tray .. but the cheapie knives they provide don't cut into the meat very easily.. The forks also make you feel like Â you should be eating Â kindergarten food instead of bbq. Â They could have at least upgraded to heavier duty plastic utensils..SUGGESTIONS:To save you a lot of aggravation & money, in these tough economic times, if you're going here for the first time & are reading these Yelp comments for suggestions, as I usually do, you are probably hungry. Â Grab a couple of slices of the moist brisket (hopefully, it's moist that day), a large mac & cheese & a cornbread..This should hit the spot & do the trick , while keeping your wallet intact.Honestly, with so many other quality BBQ joints out there, I would altogether skip this place, unless you happen to be in Red Hook..On average, I spend about $45 for food for 2 at a quality place like ""John Brown's"" Â but somehow end up spending $70+ here..Either this place is overpriced, or the guy weighing the meat or the other guy behind the register are applying fughazy math when tallying things up.",2.0

"Memorial Day Monday. I'm in Coney Island and hubby is craving BBQ. Yelp leads me to this place. The line was sick and we actually waited over 45 minutes. Our hunger totally got the best of us, so we ordered the brisket, spare ribs, potato salad, mac & cheese and cornbread. Â Overall I wasn't super impressed. I was waiting for this amazing flavor explosion and I didn't get it. The brisket was soft but I added sauce for some more flavor. The spare rib was okay. The potato salad had way too much vinegar in it and it was too smooth (I like to have chunks of potato in mine). The mac & cheese was nothing spectacular, it has some hot pepper which was a nice addition, but my mom's mac is wayyy better. The best part of the meal was the cornbread. Super buttery, sweet and cakey but not too sweet. It was a huge slice and I wanted more. Overall the meal was kind of a let down since we did wait over 45 mins, which for us is unheard of. Â The beer was good though, I had a pale ale and hubby was excited because they had ole smokey moonshine. I might come back here on a slow night to try the chicken or the brisket sandwich.",3.0

Â Beer selection is good but either service (one person manning the line who screwed up my order) and price could use improvement.",3.0
Waited in line. The guy comes back 5 min after telling they re closed for the next 10 minutes. Make up your mind when you wanna take a cigarette break. Don't waste people s time. Your service sucks ass.,1.0
"Was in the neighborhood helping some friends move and they suggested we stop here for dinner! Wow! I will be back! The meat was succulent and flavorful! My mouth is watering as we speak! We tried the Brisket, pulled pork, and the pork belly tacos as well as many of the sides. Seating is on long wooden tables, cafeteria style. Very cool atmosphere. We all left stuffed and satisfied! Can't wait to go back! The neighborhood was cool to walk around in as well. Near the water and the water taxi to manhattan was right behind Fairway grocery store- which is an adventure all its own. Go check it out! You will not be disappointed.",5.0
What can I say? Food is great come on down to Brooklyn to experience BBQ meat at it's finest. The Mac and cheese as well as the coleslaw are amazing. Perfect for groups and kid friendly my son loved it!! Other parents come and enjoy food and drinks here so I felt at home with my 18 month old!!!,5.0
"Memorial Day Monday. I'm in Coney Island and hubby is craving BBQ. Yelp leads me to this place. The line was sick and we actually waited over 45 minutes. Our hunger totally got the best of us, so we ordered the brisket, spare ribs, potato salad, mac & cheese and cornbread. Â Overall I wasn't super impressed. I was waiting for this amazing flavor explosion and I didn't get it. The brisket was soft but I added sauce for some more flavor. The spare rib was okay. The potato salad had way too much vinegar in it and it was too smooth (I like to have chunks of potato in mine). The mac & cheese was nothing spectacular, it has some hot pepper which was a nice addition, but my mom's mac is wayyy better. The best part of the meal was the cornbread. Super buttery, sweet and cakey but not too sweet. It was a huge slice and I wanted more. Overall the meal was kind of a let down since we did wait over 45 mins, which for us is unheard of. Â The beer was good though, I had a pale ale and hubby was excited because they had ole smokey moonshine. I might come back here on a slow night to try the chicken or the brisket sandwich.",3.0
"This is seriously good BBQ! Brisket and pulled pork sandwiches were great. Mac and cheese was cheesy and spicy, very good. The sticky sauce is outstanding, really compliments the brisket. This place a little off the beaten place but definitely worth the trip!",4.0
"Hometown BBQ is a welcome addition to Red Hook and the increasingly vibrant New York barbecue circuit. The brisket is excellent - fatty and flavorful with a nice bark. I haven't ventured much beyond this on the menu, but I have tried the smoked chicken and thought it very good. Be sure to grab a beer from the bar for the wait in line.",4.0

"Very fun and cool atmosphere. Went on a Saturday night with friends. Was pretty busy, long line for counter service, but worth the wait!! The brisket was so moist and tender. The baby back ribs were a little fatty but very tasty. The pulled pork was so juicy. Cornbread was amazing best cornbread I ever had. It seems all the meats are made with a dry rub, so it's not dripping with BBQ sauce. They have a selection of BBQ sauces you can put on yourself. Mac and cheese tasted a little strange to me it wasn't the traditional cheesy style. The baked beans tasted bitter to me, I didn't care for them. Loved the coleslaw!! Great selection of draft beers, had the pumpkin beer, loved it!! Definitely worth the trip to Red Hook, Brooklyn.",4.0
Tried the weekend lunch sandwiches and they are amazing. Â Biggest disappointment is the high price. Â Sandwiches on the rolls run about $11-12 without any sides.

I was excited to try a different BBQ place in Brooklyn. Despite having exceptional brisket everything else was overly peppery and underwhelming. The most awful baked beans and macaroni and cheese. The potato salad was too vinegary. Although there is plenty of room to sit inside and enjoy a show the food must be good. And this left me with a bad taste in my mouth. Plus it was far too pricey for mediocre bbq. Sticking with Fette Sau.,1.0
"Great BBQ; bad service. It was a quiet Sunday afternoon and there were 5 people ahead of us in line. It took over 20 minutes to place our order! I can't imagine going on a weekend night. They have one person slowly cutting meat and chatting and another person who has to get all the sides and ring you up. It's painful to watch. They might want to check out Mighty Quinn's to see how it's done. Both the lamb belly and spare ribs were excellent, as was the vinegary cole slaw and pickles. I'm a fan of MQ's but liked this better, especially the crusty black pepper on the ribs. The lamb is very fatty so a smaller portion goes a long way.

"I'll make this short: food was good. I had the pulled pork sandwich but for some reason they throw a dainty amount on a thick hard roll.

Also, as others reviews state, service ain't too good. And, their ordering system straight sucks. Hey owners! Do something about it! Having one line with annoyed workers isn't good. By the time you get your food you already have a bad taste in your mouth. Are two lines and a little speed in service too much to ask for? I also had the Mac and cheese which was good.

"I went there a few days ago, having spent a few weeks in anticipation of its opening, and I was very impressed. I've been to the other big New York BBQ places - Fette Sau, Dinosaur (Harlem and Gowanus), Fort Reno - and this place stacks up with the best of them. There were a few obvious growing pains (the self-serve sauce wasn't labeled and the Pit Master kept apologizing for it, no big deal) but everything at the place has been well-considered, from the menu to the design to the service. The service was great, with a really appreciative, enthusiastic and level-headed staff. Nobody was blowing smoke, and nobody was disdainful either. The nuts and bolts of the operation are apparent all over the place - I sat underneath the stack of wood used to smoke the meat, and the Pit Master had to pick up a few logs and toss them into the smoker while I ate, which was great to see. The polite crew was really working at producing the food, like you would expect at a rural BBQ shack. The ambiance was great, with a good deal of woodwork coming from the Gowanus Furniture company, a woodworker I am familiar with (beautiful, beautiful chopping blocks and shelving throughout). After eating I explored a bit to find another bar closer to the Van Brunt St. side of the restaurant, which felt less family-oriented and more like a gastro-pub, but perfectly paired with the main floor of the restaurant.As for the food - I had the beef rib (one HUGE rib, wet and oily, falling off the bone) recommended to me by the Pit Master and his assistant. It was amazing. The cornbread, which we ate fresh out of the oven, was very impactful - at first I thought it was too rich and oily, but after the first bite through the top layer it was the best cornbread I've had in a long time, and it was the perfect desert after a meal of heavy meat, collard greens and baked pit beans. In total I dropped just short of $30, but I didn't have any beer. It's par for the course, however, when you get a ton of prime meat at a top notch BBQ place in the city. It was well worth it, and the location of the place makes for a much better night out than its competitors.I shall return!",5.0

In total I dropped just short of $30, but I didn't have any beer. It's par for the course, however, when you get a ton of prime meat at a top notch BBQ place in the city. It was well worth it, and the location of the place makes for a much better night out than its competitors.I shall return!",5.0
love this place. exceeds all expectations. delicious food. nice ambiance. nice crowd and nice staff. they absolutely hands down know their BBQ. finger licking good,5.0
"Two meals here. It's going in the rotation. You arrive, one person gets in line, which last night (Saturday of a holiday weekend) took an hour, the other gets a drink from the big bar w excellent whisky, bourbob, rye etc selections as well as beer on tap and in cans/bottles. If there are more members of your party, go grab a table and relax. There are two big rooms, plenty so space, we ate w a baby and there were high chairs and plenty of space. Service is non-existent besides the bar and meat cutters. Now, for the important part, the meat: brisket iscamazing, lamb belly good in small portions, very fatty. Chicken was pretty special. I didn't eat the pork ribs, but am told they were peppery and delicious. Sides invlude beans w burnt ends (not as good as Fetters Sau), a great vinegary potato salad, queso mac and cheese, etc. Beef ribs are tasty, but are rediculously expensive at 25 per lb. In general, only reason they don't get 4 stars is the length of the wait for food and the cost.",4.0

"I almost don't want to write this review because I don't want you all to come here and make it too crowded, but it's due. Hometown is the sh*t! All the meats I've had so far in a dozen or so trips have been moist, well cooked and well seasoned. Standouts are the brisket (amazing crust) and baby back ribs. The chicken is legit too. The sides are not simply an afterthought. Beans and collards are perfect, as are the sour pickles. Good beers, decent whiskey selection, live music a few nights a week, what else can you want? Billy, the owner, is usually around and paying attention which says a lot. This isn't just some money hungry operation (like around the corner seems to be) trying to cash in on Brooklyn. It's a quality experience worth the cost, which is very reasonable. Yeah, Fette Sau in Wburg is pretty good, but it's too expensive and it's in Wburg Â crawling with ""Brooklyners"". If you love ""everything"" about Fette Sau, please, please don't come here.",5.0
Took the free ikea ferry from manhattan and came across this great place! My bf and I were gonna go to Brooklyn crab but since the wait was too long we are so glad we came here. Baby back ribs were amazing! The dark meat chicken was a little raw but the ribs were great and the chill vibe Is relaxing after a nice day working on oyster reef restoration on Governor's island. Would be great if they can get a ferry that goes from gov island to redhook. At 7 pm on a Friday we got food and a seat and no probs - cant wait to come back in the wintertime and listen to the bluegrass concerts,5.0
"Brisket and pulled pork were *amazing*. Â SO good. Staff was VERY friendly, especially the guy bringing drinks. Â We went at 7, line was not too long.Best side was the collards. Pickles were also very good. Â Beans were ok, mac and cheese was sub-par - skip it.Definitely will be back!",4.0
"Whoa. This place has an awkward period where the staff turns over the kitchen in the late afternoon. No food is available during this time. The staff & owner go out of their way to accommodate the people who wait around. When Hometown does serve food, expect to be blown away. I typically find brisket dry and tasteless, but the Hometown brisket is a flavor-filled taste sensation. The short ribs, sausages and sides are worth the wait as well. I recommend everyone visit here before the secret gets out and this place becomes mobbed.",5.0
Went to Hometown on a Friday night (no wait to order the food as others have mentioned) and we had a wonderful time! Â The owner Billy came over and introduced himself. Â Asked if it was our first time and made recommendations for our meal as well as ordered the chicken wings on the house for us to try because he heard us speaking about them. Â  We had 1/2lb brisket which is 2 slices of extremely tender (no knife needed) thick Texas style brisket (no sauce on it). Â The smoke was fantastic. Â The Wings in their homemade sriracha sauce were tender and spiced perfectly with just the right amount of heat. Â  We had collard greens and beans as sides. Â The collards were tasty but the beans in a tomato base and brisket ends were unbelievable. Â  The bartender (Jill I believe) was so friendly and welcoming. Â  I am a fan and will be back.,5.0

"Hello my fellow BBQ aficionado!!! I'm here to talk about Hometown Bar-B-Que. I usually shop across the street at the fairway market, awesome place. Today after Â I finished doing my shopping, I decided to try the new BBQ store on the corner. I'm a guy who doesn't mind the price of a meal as long as I enjoy it.

"Awesome BBQ place, I love the venue and the staff/owner/ambiance/food were all exceptional. It's rare in Brooklyn to find a place that is this good without a major attitude. We went last night for a big group birthday dinner, the place was pretty quiet so we had no trouble taking a giant table for 20 people. Everyone lines up and gets their own food and drinks so there is no fussing over a split tab. The bartender was very friendly and let us taste their special blend red wine- it was light and fruity, a perfect foil for rich BBQ. The Q-master was extremely helpful and steered my girlfriend and I away from the dry brisket (they had run out of wet by this time) toward the most succulent beef rib we had ever tasted, it was meltingly luscious and rich with a seasoned bark, yummy with or without sauce, we also had the pork ribs which I was a little less wowed by but they were still delicious, the sriracha chicken wings which were a dream come true (made to order and delivered separately to the table with a sprinkle of green onion and cilantro and a sweet spicy sriracha glaze), the collard greens which were just lightly vinegar-ed and cooked to a perfect tenderness, and the whiskey pickles which disappeared very quickly. We definitely ordered way too much food but I was happy to taste so many things and take home some leftovers. The friendly owner asked many of our guests if they were having a good time and if they liked the food- and they were and they LOVED the food! He also asked his staff to wrap up the beef rib bone in foil so I could take it home for my dog. Thank you guys for working to bring what is clearly a labor of love to Red Hook- this place is fantastic and I'll definitely be back with my husband!",5.0
"I hate to say it because this place is going to get insanely crowded but this is the best BBQ I have had in NYC. Â First off the owner was there behind the bar the night I went and not only is he one of the nicest people I have met he actually was cool enough to tell me exactly which items my son (who is celiac) should steer clear of (BBQ sauce, hot sauce and mac and cheese). Â The beer list is top notch, the service super friendly, the live music kick ass and most importantly the BBQ is just damn good -- end of story. Â I had the brisket, jerk chicken, ribs, and pulled pork along with every side on offer. Â I don't care about the sides--though the beans were a little too sweet for my taste, but the brisket was life changing--i cried onto the brown paper tray, the ribs were heart stopping-ly good and the jerk chicken made me feel like I was on cloud nine. Â It is obviously all smoked for the correct amount of time with the best ingredients and you can taste it in every bite. Â Lastly, the family friendly environment, great decor and awesome staff just makes this place fun to hang out in with my family.

When we arrived there was a long line that was barely moving so we went to Fairway to do some grocery shopping. We decided to give Hometown another shot so we went back after. Â There was still a slow moving line but we stuck it out this time. Â The staff is very friendly and helpful. When we finally did place our order it was expedited quickly. The food was a little disappointing, it pains me to say. There was nothing special about the ribs or any of the sides. Hopefully they are still fine tuning the recipes. Maybe more spice on the babybacks? Â  The things we DID love were the chicken and the Hometown sauce. Â So so good!Advice for the (awesome) staff-- be more consistent and speed things up a bit!We'll definitely be coming back soon!!!",4.0
"They now have hot sauce, but you have to ask for it. Â It is great. Â Not sure why they don't have several bottles of it out at the sauce counter like the other sauces though, a bit weird. Â Also, they should have a more classic KC BBQ sauce IMO.",5.0
"Awesome BBQ place, I love the venue and the staff/owner/ambiance/food were all exceptional. It's rare in Brooklyn to find a place that is this good without a major attitude. We went last night for a big group birthday dinner, the place was pretty quiet so we had no trouble taking a giant table for 20 people. Everyone lines up and gets their own food and drinks so there is no fussing over a split tab. The bartender was very friendly and let us taste their special blend red wine- it was light and fruity, a perfect foil for rich BBQ. The Q-master was extremely helpful and steered my girlfriend and I away from the dry brisket (they had run out of wet by this time) toward the most succulent beef rib we had ever tasted, it was meltingly luscious and rich with a seasoned bark, yummy with or without sauce, we also had the pork ribs which I was a little less wowed by but they were still delicious, the sriracha chicken wings which were a dream come true (made to order and delivered separately to the table with a sprinkle of green onion and cilantro and a sweet spicy sriracha glaze), the collard greens which were just lightly vinegar-ed and cooked to a perfect tenderness, and the whiskey pickles which disappeared very quickly. We definitely ordered way too much food but I was happy to taste so many things and take home some leftovers. The friendly owner asked many of our guests if they were having a good time and if they liked the food- and they were and they LOVED the food! He also asked his staff to wrap up the beef rib bone in foil so I could take it home for my dog. Thank you guys for working to bring what is clearly a labor of love to Red Hook- this place is fantastic and I'll definitely be back with my husband!",5.0
"I hate to say it because this place is going to get insanely crowded but this is the best BBQ I have had in NYC. Â First off the owner was there behind the bar the night I went and not only is he one of the nicest people I have met he actually was cool enough to tell me exactly which items my son (who is celiac) should steer clear of (BBQ sauce, hot sauce and mac and cheese). Â The beer list is top notch, the service super friendly, the live music kick ass and most importantly the BBQ is just damn good -- end of story. Â I had the brisket, jerk chicken, ribs, and pulled pork along with every side on offer. Â I don't care about the sides--though the beans were a little too sweet for my taste, but the brisket was life changing--i cried onto the brown paper tray, the ribs were heart stopping-ly good and the jerk chicken made me feel like I was on cloud nine. Â It is obviously all smoked for the correct amount of time with the best ingredients and you can taste it in every bite. Â Lastly, the family friendly environment, great decor and awesome staff just makes this place fun to hang out in with my family. Â I hope it doesn't get too crowded, but honestly these guys deserve all the success in the world, because they hit it out of the park.",5.0
