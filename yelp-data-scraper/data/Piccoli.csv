Ordered takeout once so I don't have too much to say but the food was very good and fresh and it was delivered quickly.  Gluten free options are a plus. Risotto done right.,5.0
The tiramisu is the same creamy deliciousness but the food food is not as good as their trattoria.  However they do deliver to my location so thats a plus.,4.0
"Some background: Windsor Terrace has maybe 4 restaurants all told, and this is one of the two with take-out options. The food here is okay, if on the small portions side. I used to stop here occasionally when I wanted a quick dinner takeout. Unfortunately, the young woman who took my order the other night is so rude I won't be going back there. Like, exceptionally beyond ""this is just New York"" rude. First, she ignored me standing at the window while she texted on her phone for 2 minutes. Then, after I attempted to engage her with a friendly ""hi, how are you?"", she sat expressionless, staring at me, while I ordered. When I went to pay with a credit card, she stated ""no credit cards"" in an abrupt flat tone.  So,  I asked if she knew of any ATM machines around. In response, she rolled her eyes and said ""I don't know--do you want the order or not?"" After I paused there for a second- a bit surprised  by her ultimatum, she re-rolled her eyes at me and shut the screen window in my face. Maybe she was just having a really bad day, but there was no excuse for this complete, inexcusable rudeness. I don't care if this was the only restaurant in Windsor Terrace- I'd rather order from Seamless or even the corner deli--  not going back.",2.0
"I love this place with all of my heart. I'm pescatarian again and this place always hits the spot!!!! We get the eggplant norma, the polenta with mushrooms, but what we love more than anything? THE BUTTERNUT SQUASH RISOTTO!!!! It is just the best thing ever and melts in your mouth. Other things we've tried that we really enjoy: the squid ink pasta with spicy shrimp: has a real nice spicy kink and the black pasta makes you feel adventurous, paninis: we've had one with spicy sausage and broccoli rabe which was killer for $6 and another one we enjoyed was the prosciutto with fig jam! we order delivery from here at like once every 10 days. it's SO reasonably priced and its fast!!!!tip: this place is cash only if you call in, but they are also on seamless if you're out of cash!!!!",5.0
"I'm hooked on their risotto - both the fungi and the Della Nona are fabulous. My friends who ordered the butternut squash risotto, eggplant pasta and salmon/spinach/mashed potatoes were all very happy with their food too. Beyond their great menu and skilled chefs, there's not much to praise here as they are strictly a take out place lacking basic things. Examples:- When my friend asked for a cup and ice for her soda, they said they had neither.- On our next trip there, the same friend was given a room temperature soda. Knowing they had no ice, she took it back to the window and swapped it for a cold one. Seems odd to serve warm drinks when cold ones are available. - We asked for butter for our bread and were told that that have to butter. Kinda hard to believe since that delicious risotto sure tastes like it is made with a lot of butter. Also, just fyi, there's no bathroom, so you have to go to the neighboring pizza or coffee shop, Elk, if nature calls or you just like to wash your hands before you eat. I now buy my drinks at the lovely coffee shop, Elk, to go with my risotto since I appreciate them having a bathroom.",4.0
"Really love this place. Haven't had a bad dish. Some summer days we order a panini and walk to the park, but then the risotto and pasta are so good that it's fine some days to just stay in and order delivery. They are delivery only, but the space they share with Louie G's can act as a dining area. The only problem is the food can take a while. Just make sure to plan ahead and order a little early.",4.0
"Let me start by saying the food here is awesome. I order from here from time to time, once a month I would say. In the warmer months I usually walk with my dogs to pick up the food because I find the delivery isn't super quick. I get it though, the food is being made and its not fast food. Totally level minded consumer here. Tonight I ordered on seamless a soup, a risotto, and a lasagna. They confirmed the order about 5 min later. About 1.5 hours into my wait I decide to call to see where my food is. The girl who answered the phone was really nice. She said it would be going out in 5 min. Well just short of 2 hours I received my order. As is.. I don't expect handouts ever but at least toss in a cannoli..!TL;DR- Order took 2 hours. Not even a cannoli tossed in.",2.0

"There's only 2 reasons to dislike this place. Either 1) you dislike food or 2) you enjoy complaining about ridiculous shit. Either way, you are insane if you don't enjoy this place. They obviously care about the food they make and they always deliver faster than promised over the phone. I wish only the best for these people. Also, if you're complaining about the portion sizes being too small, you might be morbidly obese and need to see a doctor.",5.0
"I should start by saying that I've been coming here for years and have been generally  pleased, so I am surprised and disappointed to find myself driven to write a review like this.  However, the other night, I made what was apparently a grave mistake and decided to order the polenta appetizer...never in my life can I remember receiving (and paying for) something this rancid from a restaurant.  The polenta was a rock hard rectangle covered in a very suspect grey ""cheese and mushroom"" sauce...I'm not exaggerating when I say that this was something I wouldn't even feel comfortable feeding to a stray animal.  It was absolutely foul, one of the worst things I've ever put in my mouth.  The polenta seemed very likely to have come straight out of the freezer and to have been in there for a while...my mistake for not bringing it right back after discovering what it was when I got it home.  Other things I've had from this place have been good, but this was just not okay.",2.0

"first let me start with, NO ONE SHOULD ORDER TAKE OUT FROM THEM. the portion of the food was so small, that I couldn't believe i paid over 20$ for two salads that came in a plastic container. The lasagna was o k a y. The sauces seemed to be concentrated. Did not like it at all. Second, who ever takes the orders/ and answers the phone does not communicate the english language very well. I tried to explain what I wanted, and wanted to know how some of the orders are made and she could not understand me. Not a happy customer at all. I also did not receive any napkins or utensils.

"I read something about risotto somewhere and could not stop craving it. When I yelped places near work that had it, Piccoli got great reviews so I decided to get takeout from them.

The food was wonderful. It was so easy to order online and even though they said 35 minutes, it was ready earlier.The parmesan risotto is just fabulous. My father hates Italian food (and basically all food that's not Guyanese/Jamaican). When he tried the risotto from Piccoli he loved it, to both our surprise. It's a high compliment indeed when my old Guyanese father will eat a dish that is not Caribbean in origin and then say how good it is. The pesto with asparagus was also fantastic (couldn't get him to try that one though) and their tiramisu gives me life. No kidding.

"Wow. AMAZING food for a really fair price! We ordered from their website, and delivery was speedy and polite.I had a tasty salads of mixed greens, roasted peppers, artichoke hearts and mozzarella. The cheese was so fresh and wonderful. The salad greens were as promised on their site, a nice blend of greens. I'm always reticent to get a salad from a delivery place as so often, it's old iceberg lettuce and bland tomatoes. This was neither. Well worth taking a chance on.We also ordered the lasagna, which was heavenly. For dessert, a giant slice of sinful tiramisu was enough to satisfy two people with some leftover for midnight snacking.Piccolo got it right down to the delicious bag of sliced bread sent along, which had fresh parmesan for us to sprinkle on both dishes, and a bit of garlicky vinegary oil, which may have been salad dressing but which I greedily dipped the bread into. Every detail was just... right. I felt like we had a restaurant meal at home. Not delivery restaurant food, that's all condensation and leaks and missing elements that you love when you sit down but sacrifice when you take out. None of that. I can't wait to try them again!",5.0
"Tonight after months of saying we should, we tried Piccoli for dinner. The bottom line is that these guys can cook! It might be takeout only, but it definitely is gourmet quality takeout!We ordered online which was fast and easy. We had chicken Parmigiana, the Mela salad which had arugula, Gorgonzola, toasted hazelnuts and apples and Tiramisu for dessert. All were amazing. The chicken was moist, the salad fresh, the dressing delicious and the Tiramisu out of this world. Also the pasta that came with the chicken was cooked just right. Likewise the people who run Piccoli are friendly and really want you to enjoy your meal.Only a few minor suggestions... With food of this quality it was disappointing that the bread tasted like supermarket bread...especially with so many decent to exceptional bakeries in Brooklyn and the chicken could have used a bit more sauce. Prices are a bit high for takeout and it is cash only. Yes, very minor points but ones that in my opinion would help Piccoli get from a well deserved 4.5 stars to 5.",4.0

Love this place. Great risotto. The mushroom and chicken is unreal. Very very consistent. Fast delivery. Can get expensive though and is cash only.,5.0

"The risotto was so delicious! It came quickly and was still hot. We got the one with the mushrooms and the one with the chickpeas; both excellent!We also ordered a salad which had delicious mozzarella in it!May not be the best think for eating healthy in the new year, but will definitely be ordering from here again.Wish they took credit cards, but I know that can be tough for small business.",5.0
Surprisingly really good for a little delivery/take-out place.  Had one of the seafood risottos.  It was cooked to perfection and I know how difficult it is to get risotto right.  Also had one of the pasta dishes that was good.  Would definitely order again and next time will get the tiramisu everyone has been raving about.,5.0
"We ordered and ate outside tonight. It was OK. I ordered the tilapia with shrimp, and I am almost certain the shrimp were frozen and not fresh. If I am going to pay good money then I expect fresh food, especially since they claim to make ""homemade"" food. We will try it again though, give it another shot.",3.0
"Ordered delivery at least 6-7 from here so far, and keep trying different food. All the risottos are great, and as another reviewer wrote they always arrive hot (which is great, as you can take your time getting ready without worried that your food will get cold). I don't think the prices are too high like someone else said, they are fair. I don't really have a favorite, just go for what you like. Also, the gnoccis are delicious. All of them. Always ask for the specials, as sometimes they have some gems. Don't sleep on the tiramisu..it wasn't until my 5th order when I discovered what I was missing. I also love their salads (beet one w chicken added). ONLY constructive feedback I have is regarding their grilled pollenta and calamari...as they both tasted as though they were grilled on a gas grill, so I would suggest grilling them on a cast iron ribbed skillet instead (note for owners). Still deserves 5 stars. Keep it up. Curious to see if the menu changes in the spring/summer as I'm not sure how into eating hot risotto I'll be when in the warmer months...",5.0
Loved everything we ordered - especially the risotto Nero. Take out or delivery only.,5.0
