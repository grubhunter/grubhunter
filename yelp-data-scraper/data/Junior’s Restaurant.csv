"A gem of a restaurant. Excellent location in the heart of downtown Brooklyn. I really enjoyed the 1950's atmosphere and decor. The service was very polite and friendly. My food came out quickly. I highly recommend the Matzoh ball soup and the original cheesecake. This is the best cheesecake I've ever had; it literally melts in your mouth. My burger and fries were outstanding, as well. If you're visiting NYC and you want to try Junior's, make sure to visit this flagship location in Brooklyn. (The locations in Manhattan won't give you as authentic of an experience.)",5.0
Only had cheesecake as had heard it's a must at this iconic restaurant. I must say it was awesome and definitely the best I have had! Service was great and the place looks 70's cool... love it!,5.0
"Went here for lunch after seeing this restaurant on food network,  hearing the cheesecake was to die for.  Started with a chicken salad sandwich which tasted like it came straight out of my grandmothers kitchen, for only 10.99. Finished with the Devils cheesecake,  probably one of the best cheesecakes Ive ever had! Wish I got some to go.",5.0
"Our hosts had recommended us to try the legendary cheesecake and so we came here for breakfast. The cheesecake was truly delicious, both the classic one and the one with raspberry swirls. The service was very friendly and attentive and we barely had to wait. For our German stomachs, one piece of cheesecake was enough for a whole day of sightseeing. We didn't get hungry for hours and so our next meal was dinner ;-)",5.0
"Junior's cheesecake really holds a special place in my heart.  I get excited whenever I have an opportunity to come here.  Both my Grandmas loved this place, my parents grew up eating here, and I too have eaten many of their cheesecake slices since I was a little boy.  Over the years I've had the Devil's Food, the Red Velvet, the Carrot Cake, the Chocolate Mousse, and my favorite, plain with strawberries and glaze on top; I love that the strawberries they use are huge and fresh all year around.In addition to their desserts I've recently also had the pleasure of experiencing a Turkey BLT and a Brisket Burger from their food menu.  Both were delicious and served in generous portions, just like their cheesecake.Service was also really good.  Every time I've been here with my family we were served with nothing but kindness, and I really appreciate that ... Until next time Junior's.",4.0

"The last time I wrote a review was back in 2012. It was my 30th birthday and I was in a dark place...ready to trade my two year old for a crack-cake. Fast forward to Spring Break 2016 and she's almost six. We're both addicts now. She's been to the one in Times Square and Grand Central, but I told her that we had to go back to Cheesecake Mecca. They didn't disappoint. What can I say that I haven't already said? Same ingredients: sugar, cream cheese, crack. We argued over which cheesecake to get. I won because I have a job and keys to the car. We sat in complete silence and let our eyes gloss over. Then we left. The sugar rush is real. Giving cheesecake to a five year old is like giving cocaine to a gremlin. She ran across the Brooklyn Bridge all the way to the WTC...then asked if we could get another slice from the one in Times Square. That's why I love her...codependent and enabling.",5.0
Junior's is a classic Brooklyn restaurant.  Most notably known for their cheesecake.  It is by far the BEST Cheesecake in the WORLD!  I have tried just about all the types of cheesecakes they have and they are all great.  My personal favorite is the pineapple topping cheesecake.I went to junior's yesterday and for the first time I had the food and it was just as amazing as the cheesecake.   I can not believe that it took me so long to try it but I am glad I did. Just great!  If you want authentic Brooklyn food Junior's  got you covered.,4.0
"Superb, moist and reasonably priced New York Iconic dessert. Pls don't change!Used to just buy take-out cakes, and mousses from here. Finally tried to have a sit down session with a friend and update my review for a fuller experience. They have a number of locations but my favorite is the one at Flatbush Av because it's at par with the old Downtown Brooklyn vibe. We were greeted by uniformed servers. That's one thing dying in dining experiences. Aside from 5star restaurants, servers usually wear casual attires nowadays.I got the the chocolate mousse with an earl grey tea. My friend got a strawberry cheesecake with a glass of merlot. Most people eat there diner style but we were just there for a quick dessert.",4.0

"Dude, what the hell man?!?!? I am a sucker for NYC tradition and Junior's is an icon in New York. Junior's has been around for 65 years and in that time they should have gotten better as time goes by, not worse. I have had Juniors's several times over the years and I used to really like it. I really liked the smooth texture of the cheesecake and the not too intense sweetness of the filling. That is long gone. I went there the other day with some friends and we got a slice to go that we split amongst the three of us, oh thank heavens we didn't get one each. The food:Strawberry Cheesecake- So we ordered a slice of strawberry cheesecake, since I have enjoyed it in the past, and on this trip, it was so damn sweet and so damn chalky! The chalkiness was really weird like it was undercooked flour and it was very apparent. I was really kinda shocked and disappointed that the slice was bad. I also felt like a butthole since I took a friend who has never been and she was left with disappointment *sad face* And to throw pie in my face, the damn slice was $7.50, with tax it came out to $8.16, were these supposed to be magic cheesecakes?",2.0
Disgusting. Cashier didn't wear gloves when putting the cheesecake in the box. Then handled cash. Then she touched my cheesecakes with her bare hands when placing it in the box. Disgusting.,1.0
"This Junior's restaurant is centrally located in downtown Brooklyn, near the subway and Flatbush. We were staying nearby so it was within perfect walking distance for breakfast. The dining room is extensive, but it wasn't too busy when we were seated. Food came out quickly and we also enjoyed the complimentary pastries. The menu is classic with favorable choices. We ordered Hot Cakes plate w/bacon and Eggs plate that came with bacon, potatoes, and toast. The portions were large, especially the pancakes. My dining companion loved that there was a lot of maple syrup available to douse the cakes (and bacon) with. Speaking of bacon, it was plentiful. That's the way all diners & restaurants should serve bacon--stacked and crisp. And their home fries were probably some of the best breakfast potatoes we've ever had. For our whole order, prices were decent for what we got. The staff was nice and attentive, especially when refilling drinks. Unfortunately we were so full from our meals that we couldn't handle cheesecake, but everything from the bakery near the entrance looked delicious. Junior's is a nice place to eat not only for visitors, but also for locals, as we saw a few of them being served while we dined.",4.0
"I want to thank Juniors for being open on Christmas Day. Christmas isn't like it was when I was a kid; now its pretty much just me and my Dad. I took him to see Star Wars early in the afternoon (""I don't want to wear those red and green glasses""), then we needed a place to eat. Not a lot of options on Christmas Day (even Shake Shack is closed), but he suggested Juniors. Sure enough, they were open, serving, with a fairly decent crowd. Walking in the side door really kind of transports you back a few decades. It felt surprisingly homey and comfortable. I'd been there before, but I never realized they had a full bar. I ordered a beer, Dad order a bloody mary (his drink of choice). Dad didn't like his drink; apparently I make a better bloody mary. We ordered mozzarella sticks, which were fine, but pricey for only five. Ah, but then came the sandwiches. He ordered the pastrami/corn beef combo, I ordered the brisket. They're big; normal people would get two meals from each sandwich. I must've been hungry or sentimental or both, because I basically inhaled mine. It was delicious. Oh, and I destroyed the fries as well. My father took half his sandwich home for another day.It may be sacrilege, but we both passed on cheesecake.I really hope this place lasts forever. I thank them again.",4.0
"Good cheesecake, but not the best in New York.I have respect for this place because it is a New York establishment that has not yet been bought out or forced out by the yuppie/hipster crew. They are not the best cheesecake people because they serve cakes that are not fresh. Make em fresh and you shall have better reviews!",3.0
"The food is not that great here and is pricey for a diner. I went in to ask to use the bathroom after having ate there many times. I walked in said ""Hello may I use the bathroom?"" The woman who I asked, behind the bakery, gave me a hard time because I didn't open my question with ""Good Morning"" I was nice,polite said hello. Her misery ruined my entire day.",1.0
"Deservedly renowned for the cheesecake. I've tried a couple of different flavours - all delicious, but the original is best!Other favourites include matzoh ball soup (the broth is savoury, chicken-y and so, so satisfying), egg salad on toasted challah and chopped liver (on it's own or added to any sandwich). The portions are huge ... perfect for a sit-down lunch and a take-away dinner.Decent coffee and good service complete the package.",5.0
"So this place is kind of a tourist trap, but it's also kinda awesome.  Not only does Junior's have a storied history, it looks like it has a storied history.  The place looks straight out of an early Quentin Tarantino movie, i.e., unchanged from the 60's and 70's.   I had split pea soup.  It was good.  Not amazing, but good.  Surprisingly, they have a pretty good selection of local craft brews, too.   Junior's main claim to fame is their cheese cake.   I can't it's unjustified.  I'm not a huge fan of the cake ""crust"" (as opposed to a hard crust), but the body of the cheesecake was so smooth and airy.   It wasn't too sweet and wasn't too sharp.   Really good.",4.0
This is a great casual spot to get a hearty meal for a reasonable price.Pros:-massive portions-wide selection of food-everything you want in a diner-reasonable price-friendly staffCons:-only thing that wasn't on the menu was grits! (My favorite brunch side),5.0
"I have been to Juniors many times as I am a Brooklynite. First, the cheesecake is wonderful. I would recommend that first and foremost.In terms of the food, I am a fan but I wouldn't come here mainly for that. I would recommend that you try the Jerk Chicken. Spicy! Also, the portions are huge.",4.0

It easily beat out one of my favorite restaurants. I am writing this review because I tried the the chocolate mousse cheesecake today... It's difficult for me to describe how mouthwateringly delectable this cheesecake is without stringing curse words together and throwing DELICIOUS at the end! With my first bite, I closed my eyes and put my hands to the heavens because no one but Jesus could have touched this chocolate mousse cheesecake and made it the best dessert i've ever tasted.  I now understand why P.

Both slices were $7.50 and will likely take me another day to finish because they are verry rich.",5.0
"Junior's have always been one of those stables of the downtown Fulton area. It's one of those places where I enjoy walking by as a landmark, but cringe when I have to go in there.First off, the front door of the restaurant is ridiculously out of this world heavy. It's like at least 80 lbs, and I almost died trying to open it to go inside. (Juniors, why you make your door so heavy? It's heavy enough to keep me out. Almost.) The cheese cake here is phenomenal, and everyone knows it. I work in the neighborhood, so every time the company have a celebration or birthday, Juniors is place to go to. And again, every time if Im the cake buyer, I cringe coming here. But the cakes are just so darn good! The reason why I decided to give Juniors a one star, despite the alter mater of cheese cake that is serve here is because of the service. While I cannot say for their restaurant staffs because I never dined in here, the take out crew is poorly managed and coordinated. There is really only one individual working, and that's the man that's always managing the left cashier of the take out section. Once you get through to the heavy door that makes your eyes widen at the incredible weight, you walk through the mini lobby into the take out section. The take out section is separated between the left and right, the left is for food take out, and on the right there is a cake counter displaying all the cheesecake galore. I always get confuse on which counter to go order the cake from, BECAUSE THE CHEESE CAKE COUNTER IS ALWAYS EMPTY! Meaning, there's no staff to serve you. There's staffs behind the counter that's within the opening of the bakery take out and the restaurant, and they see individuals walking up to the cheesecakes examining which pieces to choose but they do not greet you. They wait till the victims, oops I mean costumers walk naively over to the food take out and wait on the line while others are actually ordering food to go. When it is finally their turn, they happily ask for the cheese cake that they have their heart set on. Only, finally to be pointed to go back to the other side.Now, mind you, I am sure the staff that was suppose to be managing the cheesecake counter sees this whole interaction from when the customer walks through the door and look at the cheesecake because the customer clearly recognize the staff that did not serve you, and when you walk back begrudging to the cheese cake counter the staff sees you walking over and laughs and keep talking with their restaurant wait staffs. Even when you're at the cashier, the staff decides to keep laughing and talking with their colleagues for a good two minutes before taking your order. All in all, this is poor management and I dislike coming to this location every time. Hopefully downtown Fulton will have a good bakery / cake catering shop opening soon to save the residents and locals from the misery of the incompetent take out staff here.",1.0

The slices from my experience taste better than buying the entire cake.  Not sure why but my taste buds can see a different between the two.  Whenever I have family gatherings I buy a cake and this time I got the Mix Fruit Cheesecake.  Cherry, pineapple and blueberry topping!

Their breakfast I must say is superior in Brooklyn, and a little pricy too. They make their own corned beef hash which is the best i ever tasted.

Skip the coffee unless you like yours watery. Don't understand the knocks on the servers. I find them all to be very pleasant. One note to the ladies: if you use the restroom, there are photos in the stalls. It's a bit disconcerting to pee with Spike Lee staring down at you.",4.0
"Had breakfast with Ethan Hawke this morning! Was in the booth right behind me. Didn't want to bother him doing the family breakfast thing. On to the review:Juniors has been a staple in the downtown Brooklyn area since only God knows. Known for their cheescake, which I never had,  their menu is pretty vast. Their breakfast I must say is superior in Brooklyn, and a little pricy too. They make their own corned beef hash which is the best i ever tasted. Sundays are always packed with the church goers having breakfast, dinner. Ample seating. I usually sit in the back in the window by the bar. Before all the Applebee's, and Pizza, and food chains that came and gone. Junior's is still standing on the corner. And their food has always compared better. The picture of the waitress on the wall was a lady I remember from coming as a kid. If you never been to Juniors, it's worth a sit down, you will be pleased.",4.0
Really really sad. I love a legendary entry. We came here for breakfast. I ordered corn beef hash two eggs tomato slices. They messed up my order once. I corrected the waiter on the hash part and my eggs... he bought out another wrong plate by now my whole party was almost done eating. I asked if I could have discount because it was truly an inconvenience. He looked at me like was crazy so I just cancelled my order completely. Then he came back and told he was going to take it off my bill as if he was doing me a favor. My family all order breakfast the French toast coffee and bacon were all winners. Everything else blah blah... I didn't get cheesecake because I'm done with this place. Really dissapointed. They even messed up my family's orders. Uhhhhhhhhhh,2.0
"Love Juniors, Been coming for YEARS... Everytime I go no matter what time I get there I seem to get a spot right on Flatbush, right out front. The place is huge on the inside, never a wait am always seated right away. Love the pickle plate they bring. LOVE LOVE LOVE the pickles. Have tried soo many things here, great sandwiches. Cheesecake is good, but Im from Boston I love Cheesecake Factory better - Jrs Cheesecake is soo Rich & Cream Cheesy almost too heavy for me.  But def take a stop when you are in the city, Totally worth the little out of the way trip to Brooklyn!",4.0
"I loved my experience at Junior's! I came here for breakfast, and I sat at the bar, which was really nice. I got prompt service and a nice chat with the bartender. I love the little pastries that came with my breakfast, and I was blown away from the amount of food that I got - really good value. I had grits with bacon, eggs, bread...all very good, all very solid! and I didn't even have the cheese cake!!I also liked the fresh coffee, and I certainly will come back. I loved the relaxed Brooklyn vibe with good Jazz music, casual people, and good food!",5.0
2 stars for the actual cheesecake. Definitely pass on the cafeteria-style food. Came by for a work meeting and wanted to see what all the rave reviews were about. It's one name away from diner food. The service was terrible and they stack plates on top of each other when bringing the food. They put a plate of meat on top of my salad and I'm vegetarian. Needless to say I didn't touch my soggy salad. The pea soup was so thick and cold it could have easily come out of a freezer bag. Just come for dessert because the food will be a huge disappointment unless diner food is your kind of thing.,2.0
"My group walked in hungry for actual food so we decided to give the infamous Junior's a try as an ""American diner"" according to Yelp. There was a small line of people waiting outside by the cheesecake display but only a few tables filled for dining. The host greeted us, led us through a maze-like interior (poor choice of design and decor) and sat us down to our booth right next to another party who was celebrating a birthday. It was after 8pm on a Thursday night and of all the numerous tables you had available, you just HAD to sit us down right next to the loud group all the way in the back? Service here was unlike any other I've ever experienced. The waiter looked annoyed when we had to flag him down twice to take our orders and when he did finally walk over, he gave no intro or recommendations, not even a smile. What was more surprising to me was that when my friend started to tell him of our lengthy list of food, he did not reach into for his pen and pad. Yup, he just stood there and nodded as my friend continued while the rest of us wondered who was brave enough to ask this man if he had super memory skills. Unfortunately, none of us spoke up so we made a bet on whether or not if our orders would get messed up.Before our order came out, we were given generous amounts of pickles and bread. Be careful not to fill yourselves up on bread though. The cornbread was very dry and rolls were slightly warm. It didn't take long before our massive plates of food came--and I mean MASSIVE. Way bigger than we expected. My friend's pasta dish was heaping with linguini and giant chicken parm while my other friend's burger was a huge steak between a small bun hidden under the thick onion rings and fries. My Chicken-on-a-Bun wasn't even on a bun...it was an enormous grilled chicken steak sandwiched between two thick slices of toasted buttery baguette. As for the bet, our order was indeed messed up. He forgot our side dishes of baked potato and mac n cheese (something I was reallyyyyy looking forward to from an American diner) and switched my sweet potato fries with my friend's regular steak-cut fries. Unfortunately for me it's always about quality over quantity. The flavors was missing. Everything was bland. My grilled chicken was not seasoned at all; friend took one bite from the chicken parm dish and said the sauce was blah and reached for the ketchup bottle and S&P shakers available on our table. When we called for a check my friend waved for the same waiter who was too cool for a pen and pad. He was literally standing a few feet behind us but his eyes was glued to the sports game on the TV. Well sir, there goes your chance of a nice tip. Highly disappointing considering it was quite expensive. Next time I will ONLY come here for their namesake--cheesecakes.",1.0
Review for Cheesecake Only:PROS:- Strawberry Cheesecake [3 STARS] $7.50 a slice + tax = $8.17. This one is not as good because the strawberries are drenched in strawberry puree sauce and tons of sugar like the ones you would find on Costco cakes.- Apple Pie Cheesecake [4 STARS] - My favorite one so far. Creamy delicious cheesecake.CONS:- Kind of expensive for a slice of cheesecake.,4.0
This review is just for the red velvet cupcake.   I am a red velvet fanatic so I try them all over and since I couldn't get to my regular spot I figured I may as well try theirs.   The price of the red velvet cupcakes was about normal at 3.50. It was moist and the frosting had the perfect amount of sweetness.  I won't be rushing back for one but it is a good second or third choice.,4.0
"Perfect diner experience -- easy, delicious, and friendly.  Having only been to the Grand Central outpost, a friend and I walked over from the hotel we were staying at in Fort Greene.  That was a wonderful decision.  We were seated quickly and greeted by a friendly and attentive waitress.  I loved staring out from my comfy vinyl booth seat onto signed pictures hanging on the wall of Mary Tyler Moore and Tony Danza.  I ordered the challah grilled cheese with a side of fries and bacon.  Mmmm.  Seriously perfect diner grilled cheese!  My friend ordered challah french toast which came with a delicious assortment of danish and sweet breads.  Again, perfect diner french toast and pastries.  The price tag was a little higher than it would be in say Colorado, but, as NYC food goes, it was on the cheap.  On our way out, we both grabbed some cheesecake to go and rainbow cookies.  Life was very good later that day when we tried that!",5.0

"Ok, so I wanted to come here because Puffy made Da Band walk 12 miles to get him a cheesecake and I just had to see for myself if it was just that good!!! I walked the Brooklyn Bridge over from Manhattan and. Although it wasn't 12 miles I will say that Juniors' cheesecake was totally and completely worth the walk!!! So...the Devil's Food was the most amazing cheesecake I've ever had...no lie...not exaggerating...it is incredible!!! OMG!!! It is a mixture of cake and cheesecake and it is just incredible! I did not want it to end.  Also tasted a bite of the red velvet cheesecake and meh...that was alright but not nearly as good as the Devil's Food! I would have it shipped it is so good!!!",4.0

"Went to the original Junior's after loving the food and cheesecake from the location in Times Square. I was thoroughly disappointed. we ordered a variety of items and everything tasted dry and old.

"Hard to write a fair review when we only got the cheesecake.   As famous as it's supposed to be, the cheesecake fell short of expectations.   Maybe we hyped it up too much, or maybe we gave it more credit than we should've, but the cake was underwhelming.",3.0
"My husband and I and our two kids went tonight for the first time and we were pleasently surprised! My husband order the ribs and fried chicken and couldn't finish it. He said it was delicious..& being a southern man that's a huge compliment! I had a garden salad, steak, mixed veggies a baked potato and lobster tail and some red wine. It was so good. I love good steak I like mine dark on the outside but nice & juicy on the inside lol. It was juicy with every bite!! We ordered linguine for the kids and they loved it. After we ordered two slices of the cheesecake. I had the chocolate moose and my husband had the apple crumb. We sampled each others and I just took his. The kids & I tore that apple crumb cheesecake up..my husband said do you want to get one to go? I said heck no..Addictions are too hard to quit..and I'm not pregnant so I won't have an excuse!! Now that everyone's sleeping I'm regretting that decision though...",4.0

"Junior's is a Brooklyn institution synonymous with cheesecake.However, having stomped around this borough for the better part of a decade I've never been inside the restaurant. This all changed this past Sunday, where after a movie, friends and I decided to make the trek for a bite [NB: 15-20 min. walk from 106 Court st - so not exactly next door from the cinema]. One of our party had been to Junior's before so explained that it was diner-ish so that set our expectations. It was so very diner-ish.The space itself is huge. Huge, huge. The front end of the restaurant may have had twenty something tables by itself; the back end past the bar (weirdly situated in the middle of the place) may have had twenty something more plus booth seating. Our waiter, for some reason, decided that we would walk by many of the empty tables upfront and take us to the back. While making our way there we had a good look at many of the other patrons on that Sunday night dinner service. It was a very mixed crowd; from your families to your college kids to your having a drinks with friends. All different shapes, sizes, colors. Nice to see that lived diversity and a shared space across the spectrum [cause, quite frankly most places don't].Now as far as the food, well, the menu is quite eclectic and having watched way too many reality tv shows based on restaurant rescues; this would be the point where the celebrity chef would complain about how the menu is too broad in scope and they need to have a tighter focus. I, however, am no celebrity chef. I simply took note that under ""Sides"" you could get  bagel/cream cheese as well as linguine marinara. You can also find a red snapper, and broiled lobster on top of regular diner fare (your burgers, fried chicken, chicken tenders,  breakfast any hour, etc). So - yes - quite extensive.I ordered the fried chicken dinner. I was warned that it could take some time but it came out piping hot and in no time at all. It came with two sides which you got to pick some kind of vegetable side (collards, coleslaw) and your choice of potato (french fries, mashed potatoes, baked potatoes). Portion size was jumbo! Three pieces of meaty fried chicken basically half a chicken. Taste was not bad but at 21 bucks for the dinner; a bit price-y.My friends were very satisfied with the mac and cheese; the chicken tenders were actual chicken - not frozen bits thrown in a deep fryer; the bacon cheese burger was big enough for two hands and a question on how to eat it.Overall, Junior's will scratch that diner-itch. Food is quite decent. Service is quick and snappy. And of course, the legendary cheesecake.",4.0
"This review is for the black-and-white cookie of which I have enjoyed thoroughly. In the last six months I have gone to at least six different bakeries for black-and-white cookies. This time, got a black n white chocolate cupcake too. So far, Juniors has my favorite Black and white cookie. I haven't eaten here so I can't speak on anything else. This beautiful cake cookie has a delicious fondant icing over a vanilla cake moist cookie. It's gorgeous to look at and The one time they didn't look so beautiful the guy pulled out a box with fresh black-and-white cookies. The cupcake was to die for. Totally moist and chocolatey! Now I love juniors even more. Approximately $10 for two black-and-white cookies and one chocolate cupcake but looks like one of those Hostess cupcakes that you got in a plastic bag at 7-Eleven except this cupcake is much larger looks more homemade and tastes a lot better.",4.0
"OMGEEE. First of all, this was such a surprise to see Junior's literally down the block from our hotel. We came up for a girl's weekend and this was the FIRST thing we ate. The wait was 0 minutes.

The 3 of us ordered, I had the BBQ Shrimp & Chicken with collards and Carrot Cake Cheesecake. The food was perfectly cooked. The cake was to die for. Also, this place SERVES APPLETON RUM, which might not seem like much to NYC natives, but it's a HARD FIND in bars/restaurants in DC (my hometown).All in all, I will be back. This is a MUST do when in NYC.",5.0
"We came twice!The first day we came- we had a GREAT SERVER who ensured we sat in the window seats and gave us time to look over their extensive menu of food. He was patient and suggested many things that sound appetizing. I opted for a burger, cooked perfectly. My friends both enjoyed their meals, one having jerk chicken the other a BBQ chicken entree. The prices were comparable to other establishments in the area - not too overpriced. The drinks and food quality were awesome...the service was definitely the added cherry on top.The second visit the next day was due to guilt - like who comes to Juniors and not have cheesecake?! We can in for a morning cocktail and ordered the red velvet, carrot and strawberry cheesecake all which were huge portions but also VERY good.The historic business is classic in appearance on both the outside and the inside. You can tell the era it was built and how things haven't much changed.....I think its the charm. I would definitely recommend for a morning or early lunch.",4.0
"Gosh!  I remember going to this restaurant with my family during the '80s.  Their menu has not changed much.  Their setting has not changed at all.  Even the pictures in the men's room look like they've been there for decades.Of course, they're famous for their cheesecakes which are weight-gaining delicious (and priced high for a slice, I might add).  But I have to say that I am not much of a fan of their all-American menu.  Their portions are generous, so you don't have to worry about getting teased with artsy food.  (I hate going to those foofoo restaurants.)  I do, however, enjoy their pickles.  They're pretty tasty.  What can I say?  I know you're going to go there because it's a Brooklyn treasure that managed to stay there while all of these condo buildings are showing up in the area.  So I hope my review was, at the least, entertaining.Enjoy your time at Juniors, you tourist!!",4.0
"Tourist Trap! For the past five years a friend has raved about this place! They informed me it's the number one place in the countryfor cheesecake. I BEG to differ!

"I been here a couple of times before but most recently I came last week with Lapin for brunch. When we arrived there wasn't much of a wait and we were seated rather quickly. Except, we got squished into a corner seat right near the cart where they put used dishes and glasses. Every time, they made a new deposit into that germ-ladden container our conversation would get cut off by a loud clank or food/water sprayed on us. Oh, why yes, I would love garbage with my meal...Lapin ordered a coffee and our waiter who was sick and coughed several times without covering her mouth was efficient in the beginning but towards the end --- she forgot we were even there. We waited 35 minutes after asking for our bill four times. Lapin remarked that they were trying to keep us as prisoners. Lapin got the Old Fashioned French Toast with sausage and I got two scrambled eggs with fries.  The food was okay but for the price I thought it would have been a bit tastier. I feel like for the price and the quality, you could get similar food at a diner for a lot cheaper. Perhaps, it was just what we ordered and should have gone for lunch oriented menu items like we have done in the past.

My mom sent her food back and I covered mine in ketchup and gave the rest to a homeless lady. Later we found out from people we met in Brooklyn, that you only go to Junior's for the cheesecake.

It really brought out the flavor.The cole slaw, pickles and beets were pretty standard.For the main course I had the Corned Beef on rye ($13.50) and my other half had the Jamaican Jerk Chicken ($20.50). A okay. Finished off with a Brooklyn Egg Cream ($3.50) and a Raspberry Swirl Cheesecake slice ($7.25). Good stuff.Worth the nostalgia trip.

I don't think they're hand cut, and this kind of iconic restaurant should be serving decent fries. We were lucky enough to get a metered parking space, but be prepared to pay for parking.Worth the trip.",4.0
"I really very much wanted to give this place 4 stars. However, the service I received when I was here forced me to have to knock off a star for the time being.I went here mainly for the cheesecake but ended up having an entire dinner here. I got here on a Friday night around 7 PM and I was starving from having walked all around the city for the entire day exploring. The place was busy but I had no trouble getting seated since the inside of this place is pretty big and has a lot of tables. When I entered I wasn't really greeted by a host/hostess nor did I see one anywhere close by. I moved a little bit farther into the restaurant looking for an employee I could talk to about being seated. I made eye contact with a guy about 30 feet away from me and he quickly came over to me. He asked whether I would like to sit at the counter or a table. I quickly chose to sit at a table since the counter looked a bit cramped and uncomfortable. Once seated I very quickly took a liking to the decor and atmosphere of this restaurant. Lots of old pictures and advertisements from a much earlier time adorned the walls. A lot of my favorite oldies 1950's songs were being played. I really felt like I was hanging out in a 1950's Brooklyn diner. It was a really fun place to just sit back and relax after finishing my day around the big city. There was a large family of native New Yorkers sitting next to me complete with parents, kids, and grandparents all talking amongst themselves with thick NY accents. That absolutely completed the experience. Go where the locals go!It took quite awhile for my waiter to make his first stop by my table to take my drink order. I had been sitting about ten minutes before he made his way over. No big deal. At that point I was enjoying the ambiance of the place. He came back pretty quick with my drink and took my order. I went with the pastrami burger with steak fries. After taking my order the waiter came back a few minutes later with beets, coleslaw, and pickles. All were clearly house made. My food came in a reasonable time. The pastrami burger was a pretty good sized burger with several slices of pastrami piled on top. It came with a very large onion ring. The food was very good and the slices of pastrami on top of my burger were great. The steak fries weren't bad either. However, I was most anxious to try the cheesecake. After finishing my meal I ordered my cheesecake. The massive slice came out and I dove right in after getting several pictures of it. I truly can't describe to you how good this cheesecake was! Seriously, it was like no other cheesecake I had ever eaten before. It was the perfect balance of sweet and creamy. I enjoyed every single bite. I honestly ate tiny little bites of it at a time just so I could make the experience last longer. My advice: Get the cheesecake while you are here! I also regret not trying a Brooklyn egg cream while here which seems to be another specialty of theirs. My waiter really never came back to check on me after dropping my dessert off. After finishing I tried making eye contact with him several times to no avail. I just wanted to get the check at this point. I decided I would sit back for awhile and digest and give him a chance to stop back by. After 20 minutes of waiting and watching him pass by my table with my empty plate and glass numerous times I deduced he was not coming back. I finally got up and asked him about the check. Having to make my way across the room to talk to him was a bit inconvenient considering tables are placed pretty close together here. Add in a bunch of other people and it was like weaving through a maze.Overall, I loved the atmosphere and the food (especially the cheesecake!). However, the service left a bit to be desired. I understand people have off nights and waiting tables is not easy. In this case my waiter practically forgot about my presence which irked me a bit. With that being said I will definitely be back for more of the awesome cheesecake and to give the service another shot. If you're looking for a New York classic or some true New York style cheesecake give this place a try.",3.0

I will have to come at other times of day to enjoy the rest of what Junior's has to offer.",5.0
"The Original. Started with a Heineken ($5.50) and a Cosmopolitan ($11). The beer was cold but the Cosmo was a little on the weak side.Next up, the Baked Onion Soup ($7.95). Mmm, mmm, good. I especially liked that they used a seeded rye bread. It really brought out the flavor.The cole slaw, pickles and beets were pretty standard.For the main course I had the Corned Beef on rye ($13.50) and my other half had the Jamaican Jerk Chicken ($20.50). A okay. Finished off with a Brooklyn Egg Cream ($3.50) and a Raspberry Swirl Cheesecake slice ($7.25). Good stuff.Worth the nostalgia trip. And it's a four block walk from the Barclays Center, which was where were headed after our dinner.",4.0
"I haven't been here for years, & it's absolutely as fabulous as I remembered it. Fabulous Cheesecake, fabulous Reuben sandwiches, and every dish, on every table looked fabulous.They lose a star, because the French Fries were kind of mealy ,if you order fries, make sure you ask for them well done. I don't think they're hand cut, and this kind of iconic restaurant should be serving decent fries. We were lucky enough to get a metered parking space, but be prepared to pay for parking.Worth the trip.",4.0
"I really very much wanted to give this place 4 stars. However, the service I received when I was here forced me to have to knock off a star for the time being.I went here mainly for the cheesecake but ended up having an entire dinner here. I got here on a Friday night around 7 PM and I was starving from having walked all around the city for the entire day exploring. The place was busy but I had no trouble getting seated since the inside of this place is pretty big and has a lot of tables. When I entered I wasn't really greeted by a host/hostess nor did I see one anywhere close by. I moved a little bit farther into the restaurant looking for an employee I could talk to about being seated. I made eye contact with a guy about 30 feet away from me and he quickly came over to me. He asked whether I would like to sit at the counter or a table. I quickly chose to sit at a table since the counter looked a bit cramped and uncomfortable. Once seated I very quickly took a liking to the decor and atmosphere of this restaurant. Lots of old pictures and advertisements from a much earlier time adorned the walls. A lot of my favorite oldies 1950's songs were being played. I really felt like I was hanging out in a 1950's Brooklyn diner. It was a really fun place to just sit back and relax after finishing my day around the big city. There was a large family of native New Yorkers sitting next to me complete with parents, kids, and grandparents all talking amongst themselves with thick NY accents. That absolutely completed the experience. Go where the locals go!It took quite awhile for my waiter to make his first stop by my table to take my drink order. I had been sitting about ten minutes before he made his way over. No big deal. At that point I was enjoying the ambiance of the place. He came back pretty quick with my drink and took my order. I went with the pastrami burger with steak fries. After taking my order the waiter came back a few minutes later with beets, coleslaw, and pickles. All were clearly house made. My food came in a reasonable time. The pastrami burger was a pretty good sized burger with several slices of pastrami piled on top. It came with a very large onion ring. The food was very good and the slices of pastrami on top of my burger were great. The steak fries weren't bad either. However, I was most anxious to try the cheesecake. After finishing my meal I ordered my cheesecake. The massive slice came out and I dove right in after getting several pictures of it. I truly can't describe to you how good this cheesecake was! Seriously, it was like no other cheesecake I had ever eaten before. It was the perfect balance of sweet and creamy. I enjoyed every single bite. I honestly ate tiny little bites of it at a time just so I could make the experience last longer. My advice: Get the cheesecake while you are here! I also regret not trying a Brooklyn egg cream while here which seems to be another specialty of theirs. My waiter really never came back to check on me after dropping my dessert off. After finishing I tried making eye contact with him several times to no avail. I just wanted to get the check at this point. I decided I would sit back for awhile and digest and give him a chance to stop back by. After 20 minutes of waiting and watching him pass by my table with my empty plate and glass numerous times I deduced he was not coming back. I finally got up and asked him about the check. Having to make my way across the room to talk to him was a bit inconvenient considering tables are placed pretty close together here. Add in a bunch of other people and it was like weaving through a maze.Overall, I loved the atmosphere and the food (especially the cheesecake!). However, the service left a bit to be desired. I understand people have off nights and waiting tables is not easy. In this case my waiter practically forgot about my presence which irked me a bit. With that being said I will definitely be back for more of the awesome cheesecake and to give the service another shot. If you're looking for a New York classic or some true New York style cheesecake give this place a try.",3.0
"GREAT CHEESECAKE, if there is anything you have to order, its cheesecake. I have only been here twice (Times Square location), the first time I had a sandwhich but honestly dont remember what it was but it was alright but the waitress we had was fantastic and funny, havnt seen her in a while.The second time was just horrible, service was all over the place, the fried chicken platter was nasty, small, and overly priced. just not worth the misery.But again I cant emphasize enough on the cheesecakes; so do yourself a favour and forget the food go for the deserts.",3.0
"I wish this place was open late. I would eat here every night. The look and feel of this restaurant is amazing, it's so 50s retro. I love it. The decor looks so historical.

I know these things are my weakness so I limit my consumption by allowing myself only two visits per year.The fact that one slice or a whole pie is really damn expensive, parking is really bad at this location, and that cops are always around trying to ticket you helps me stay away.",4.0
I really don't know what the hype is about seriously.  I went there on Saturday  and the service was horrible  the food wasn't great  at all so am assuming  they are known for their cheese cake . The red snapper dish had no seasonings at all it was jus plain -even though I was told the chef is jamaican  hmmm I guess not all Jamaicans can cook. The lady next to us had a salmon dish that looked  good . I won't be going back to juniors for dinner just cheesecake.,2.0

I went a couple of time after and only had cheesecake. The original plain cheesecake is absolutely delicious, the way it melts in your mouth is actually hard to explain for somebody who is not a poet, so I'll just leave it at that.

Get a sandwich of corned beef, pastrami, tongue, roast beef, or brisket, each of these on rye bread. These are also the best, better even than Carnegie Deli's sandwiches. Then, if you have room, order one of their countless cheesecakes. For a newcomer, I recommend the plain cheesecake, by far the best in the city and even the country. This was the key to Junior's' fame, and it is truly world famous. For all this, it is about $25 per person.The service is fantastic, especially in Brooklyn. If you are at the Brooklyn branch, which is the true Juniors because it was the original one and is not as touristy, ask for the waiter Patrick, a seasoned veteran of the establishment. But you cannot go wrong with any of the other waiters and waitresses.The atmosphere is best at the Brooklyn headquarters, and with all of the pictures and memorabilia, it doesn't just represent Brooklyn, it is Brooklyn. Less tourists go to the Brooklyn branch, and it is much larger than the other two branches.The other two branches are in Grand Central Terminal next to the whispering corner and on 43rd Street near Times Square.

She tried to correct her mistake 3 times.

"Brooklyn is just teeming with great lunch spots and Junior's fits the bill. This place has it quirks not unlike everything else in Brooklyn.

Dessert! Don't even get me started on the different kinds of cheesecake they have because I probably won't stop, but I will anyway.  The chocolate cheesecake is so good!

"This diner is the so called mainstay and self acclaimed defacto representative of Brooklyn. It is kind of a mix bag diner. The vast bland interior of tables and banquettes accommodates all types of seating.  The service is friendly and usually prompt. I've been here a couple times for dinner and brunch. Let's start with dinner. Sticking to the obvious choices of burger and half roast chicken. The burger was fine with the usual side of fries, lettuce, slice tomato and onion. The chicken was roast chicken with a side of salad, beets and mashed potatoes. We decide to share a slice of the lemon coconut cake. I'd have to say this was probably the most favored part of the meal.It was a rainy Sunday and we didn't feel like venturing far so Junior's was close by decided to give it a try. The Sunday brunch was in full force upon our arrival. The restaurant was packed full of Sunday church goers all hungry after service. The same usual service. Friendly prompt waitress took our order of a Western Omelet and Eggs Benedict. The table came with bread basket of sweets and buns. The eggs were dry over cooked and not very good. The Eggs Benedict a main staple of brunch was a travesty. The congealed Hollandaise sauce looked disgusting and tasted so. The poached egged cooked in way to vinegary water was fowl. The dish on the whole was inedible. This was my own doing for ordering this. Thankfully, I had the grits and bread basket.I'll have to say Junior's is mix bag.

Stick to the basics and you should be fine but if you want something more I would suggest the other great restaurants in Brooklyn. As to their 'famous' desserts. I prefer the cakes and just plain cheesecake and tend to stay away from the congeal mess of coagulation fruit topping etc.",3.0

"Old school charm sustained by the wait-staff from the local ESL school.   I'm here because it is the Smithsonian of cheesecake establishments.  Fame is not enough for my tastebuds.  The coffee tastes like instant coffee and the waiter brings me cheesecake  with a sour look on his as though the slice represents his ""last chance at romance.""  P-Diddy you have Junior's.  I'm done.  But is the wait-staff part of the enslaved workforce Anderson Cooper is so worried about?  Spoiler alert:  the original cheesecake has a cake crust or really no crust alt all/. It was creamy.  It came was served plain, no whip cream.  But there was some whiplash.",2.0
I wouldn't be a real Brooklynite without a Juniors review. This spot is everything you've heard and more. Been coming here since I was five and it's the only cheesecake I'll eat--quality is always above par. Betta go get you sum!,5.0
"I'd heard about Junior's cheesecake for years, and I finally got a chance to try it a couple years ago. It was SO delicious. It took a while to get back to New York, but once there Junior's cheesecake was on the list of ""things to do""! We went again and it was still just as good. I had the original cheesecake, I liked it better than the flavored ones that I tried off of a friend's order. I haven't ordered the food, just cheesecake and coffee. But it was worth the trek through Brooklyn to get there. A+",5.0

Our second server was spot on, but the first impression is what matters. He ruined my morning, but... The food was really good and cooked perfectly.

"Such a great tourist attraction (food wise) in Brooklyn. Puff Daddy may have made this famous for having his band members walk the Brooklyn Bridge to get a cheesecake but there is more than the cheesecake that makes this place special. When you first walk in you can get a cheesecake or other pastries to go. I came here for a lunch on the a cold Saturday and the place wasn't super packed and got sat down instantly.  Our waitress was very nice and hospitable about what to order and always filled our glasses up when we needed to. You get free coleslaw, half sliced pickles, and sliced beets. Then you also get free cornbread and harm butter rolls. Everything was pretty solid for the most part. I'm not much of a coleslaw guy but did have a few bites. All this was already a meal itself but of course i had to get something to order.I ordered the lunch special chicken pot pie and for only $12 it was massive, which included free refill on soda. A huge portion of a pot pit but it was overflowed with the chicken, corn, peas, carrots, thick delicious mush that was perfect on a cold day. The bottom crust was a bit mushy but the top cover was flaky and buttery. I was half full already even before when I got the entree so I had to take the leftovers home.I was too full to get a cheesecake but I will come back to try their other eats.

I didn't have the food and the staff is rude that's why 4 stars. The cheesecake gets 5 all day. Ohh my goodness it's simply wonderful. The strawberry short cake is good as well. The ted velvet cupcake I had was a little dry but the Red Velvet cheesecake was delicious!!!!,4.0

"I am so disappointed by this restaurant that I don't know where to begin. So, I'd visited Juniors in Times Square about a year ago with some friends and left disappointed by the tasteless food, but decided to give this Brooklyn location a shot since this is where P.

I ordered the BBQ chicken with yam fries and coleslaw and my friend ordered a burger and spicy fries. My friend's burger was so overcooked that I'm very surprised that her throat didn't close up from dryness. My chicken was so bland that I couldn't take more than a few bites. We continued to eat because at that point we were both so hungry that waiting for a new order or attempting to go somewhere else  was not an option, less we pass out in the process from hunger. (I exaggerate and don't take real hunger lightly, but you get the point)When the waiter came back with the check, he looked at my nearly full plate and said, ""So you didn't like the food?""

It's JUNIOR'S!!! HELLO...the cheesecake capital of the universe! I know some people believe that the factory spot is better. I beg to differ... That strawberry cheese cake has been my savior on a craving night. The crust is insane and as I type I am making myself crave another slice.I've eaten here before for dinner and it's basically like your local diner with a bit more flare. The 5 stars is completely for the cheesecake!,5.0
This place is just ok. The food potions are enormous and the prices seem about right but it's nothing spectacular. The staff needs some serious help. Some are great and some just make you feel straight up awkward. If you've never been I'd say go see what I'm talking about for yourself. But on another note their cheese cakes are fantastic and you should definitely get one to go!,3.0
Great experience! Great food! Friendly service! The portions are real decent and so yummy. The cheesecake ( specifically the carrot cake) is so creamy and delicious. Our waitress was a sweetheart and I honestly enjoyed the diversity of people I saw there. I will def come back!,5.0
"When I realized my hotel in Brooklyn was just a 5 minute walk from the Food Network made famous Junior's, I just had to go. The truth is, I'm not even a cheescake lover, but I can't just ignore Rocco DiSpirito saying it's the best thing he ever ate.Between the wood paneling and gold trimmed bar, I felt like I was walking straight back into time. I later found out that my parents used to go on dates at Junior's when they lived in Brooklyn (aw). It sounded like not much has changed since their milkshake sipping days.The service was a little slow and the prices were a bit higher than I expected, but the food made up for it. For lunch I ordered the brisket melt -- a crazy mega sandwich with tender brisket and melty cheese piled onto a huge roll. It was amazing, but wayyy too much food. I had to force myself to stop knowing one more bite would send me over the edge before I could even stick my fork in the reason we came: the cheesecake.We decided to order 1 piece of the chocolate marble cheesecake. To reiterate, I'm no expert, but I think this was cheesecake perfection. It was so light and the texture was just spot on. Certainly worth making a trip for if you're anywhere in the vicinity.",5.0

"Just ate at Juniors with my husband and have never been so utterly disappointed in the whole event. I don't know what was going on, but from the moment we walked in we were treated like shit. No one greeted us and when we actually got a table it look 10 minutes for someone to even acknowledge that we might want water. We also weren't given any bread or pickles which were on everyone else's table. There were tons of servers all over but all of them were just standing around. When our waitress Heather finally came she was rude and passive aggressive and and rolled her eyes at our questions. Everything we asked for (which was just basic coffee and eggs) was an inconvenience for her. The only times anyone came over to us was to take our order and deliver our food. Forget trying to get out water filled, even though the two people next to us had there waters filled multiple times and the family that came in after us had their food before we even ordered. We had to get up to ask for the check, and go to the front to get someone's attention to pay. Over all the food was bland and unappetising and they didn't care to ask our preferences on sides or bread. We left feeling irritated and did not leave a tip. So no I would not recommend this location. Perhaps other Juniors in the city do a better job.",1.0

"I HAVE BEEN COMING TO THIS RESTAURANT FOR AS LONG AS I CAN REMEMBER. In fact my mom would come here regularly when she was pregnant with me in 1988.

My God mother and I went together after learning that it was only 1 slice per person though it wasn't advertised on anything I read. When we reached the front she ordered her 2 slice and I handed Thomas the cashier $1.00 to pay for hers. When he was finished with her and handed me my change, he yelled next. I then informed him that I was next and I was ready to make my order. ""One per person he said"" I replied I'm aware, that's why she ordered hers and now I'm ordering hers. He ignored me and continued to call the next person. We began to argue because he was clearly wrong. Though  I paid for my God Moms cake she ordered it with her own bill, there were 2 separate people present, there was no violation of policy. Before I knew it things escalated and Thomas the cashier called me a Monkey. We began to really get heated in our insults in front of a long line of customers and full staff. He then slammed the drawer and walked away while cussing me. What really surprised me was security coming and accusing me of insulting him, while he was still cussing in the background. To make it even worse, The owner then approached me with a n attitude and asked me to stop yelling and to not make scene, tho his worker and I just had a heated confrontation in front of the entire restaurant all along he continued to cuss at me from a distance.

"Visited Junior's for the first time and it's definitely an old school diner.

Tasha brought out water with ice to the table, but proceeded to bring an extra glass of ice to keep the water cold. Very nice touch! When our food arrived, it came to the table piping hot and delish!! I ordered a veggie omelette which was very tasty and nourishing. Came back later for the famous cheesecake after the play. Loved the original with strawberries, but wished the crust was made from graham cracker crust. Not sure what crust they use, but I didn't care for it. Other than that, the food was good comfort food.

"Will this be considered a fair review considering I didn't actually have the cheesecakes there?  I was visiting the in-laws and, as usual, did not have the time to do anything I wanted.  I planned for days to go to Junior's but it didn't happen.  Luckily through reading Yelp reviews, I found out that the cheesecakes could be ordered online and delivered across the nation.There were more cheesecake flavors available for delivery than I saw on their online menu for dining in.  I ended up settling on the Favorites Mini Sampler, which consisted of six of each flavor: raspberry swirl, red velvet and devil's food cake.  It cost $44.95 plus $12.00 for 2-day UPS shipping.  Note: It still took a week before it was actually shipped, so if you need it for an event, place your order well in advance.The cheesecakes were shipped frozen, in a giant Styrofoam box with five pounds of dry ice.  By the time they arrived after a two-day travel, almost no dry ice remained and the desserts were slightly softened.  The idiot UPS guy left the box out in the sun and didn't even bother ringing the bell to notify me of a delivery.  It even described on a note taped right on the box, next to my address, what the shipment contained, but I guess reading is not part of this guy's job requirement.So I read the paper that came with the package and it said to eat at room temperature.  I couldn't wait considering I already waited a week for them to come, so I sampled all three as they were in-between soft and slightly icy.  Terrible.  Just terrible.  It basically tasted like the four flavors sampler cheescake box that I bought several weeks prior from Trader Joe's.  I waited again until they had completely defrosted and much warmer than room temperature and they were much, much better.The consensus is that they were average desserts and nothing special.  I did not like the cake base.  It totally needs the graham cracker bottom.  The raspberry swirl was the best (and largest of the three) and did not have a base at all.  When I was considering which sampler to purchase, I was disappointed that I had to get the raspberry one with my order considering I bake raspberry swirl cheesecakes myself.  But in hindsight, I think it was good to have Junior's for comparison and sorry, Junior- yours cannot hold a candle to mine.  My raspberry swirl cheesecakes are so much tastier, with fewer and better ingredients, no preservatives or things that I cannot pronounce and they sit on a thick graham cracker base.The loser of the three was the devil's food cake, the one that I was looking most forward to because my sisters and bestie all wanted that one.  Methinks they're going to be sorely disappointed.  It was too rich.  The red velvet wasn't bad.My conclusion is I will probably not order for deliver ever again, unless I go the the restaurant itself and try out in person the other flavors that I really wanted, which was the plain/original and the strawberry shortcake one.  It was just too expensive to order all that cheesecake and pay all that shipping for possibly something I was going to hate.  Maybe next time I'm in NYC...P.S.- I posted a photo of what showed up on my doorstep.",2.0

"DISCLAIMER: Five Stars is only for the Cheesecake which is always outstanding.The restaurant is typical, old fashioned ""Mel's Diner"" (from Alice) diner fare and it was waaaay overpriced.

Got the open faced roastbeef delivered. Was very dissatisfied.  The bread was drowned in watery juice Gross!

"My friend wanted to try this place out before leaving NY. It was better than we expected!! The service was awesome!! Our waiter was so friendly and helpful. The free apps were plentiful! There were pickles, cole slaw, and beets (which is weird). Also, there was corn bread and other breads. We order only two dishes because our waiter told us the portions were large. We ordered sweet potato fries for a side, the chicken parm spaghetti and the spicy chicken and rice. Both dishes came with salads. They were indeed large portions. Three of us finished all of it. We will definitely come back here.The atmosphere is very relaxed. Great for families!!!! This place is huge!!!I totally want to try their cheesecakes. They're on display in the front of the restaurant. They even have mini cheesecakes if you don't want the big ones!!",4.0

"Will this be considered a fair review considering I didn't actually have the cheesecakes there?  I was visiting the in-laws and, as usual, did not have the time to do anything I wanted.  I planned for days to go to Junior's but it didn't happen.  Luckily through reading Yelp reviews, I found out that the cheesecakes could be ordered online and delivered across the nation.There were more cheesecake flavors available for delivery than I saw on their online menu for dining in.  I ended up settling on the Favorites Mini Sampler, which consisted of six of each flavor: raspberry swirl, red velvet and devil's food cake.  It cost $44.95 plus $12.00 for 2-day UPS shipping.  Note: It still took a week before it was actually shipped, so if you need it for an event, place your order well in advance.The cheesecakes were shipped frozen, in a giant Styrofoam box with five pounds of dry ice.  By the time they arrived after a two-day travel, almost no dry ice remained and the desserts were slightly softened.  The idiot UPS guy left the box out in the sun and didn't even bother ringing the bell to notify me of a delivery.  It even described on a note taped right on the box, next to my address, what the shipment contained, but I guess reading is not part of this guy's job requirement.So I read the paper that came with the package and it said to eat at room temperature.  I couldn't wait considering I already waited a week for them to come, so I sampled all three as they were in-between soft and slightly icy.  Terrible.  Just terrible.  It basically tasted like the four flavors sampler cheescake box that I bought several weeks prior from Trader Joe's.  I waited again until they had completely defrosted and much warmer than room temperature and they were much, much better.The consensus is that they were average desserts and nothing special.  I did not like the cake base.  It totally needs the graham cracker bottom.  The raspberry swirl was the best (and largest of the three) and did not have a base at all.  When I was considering which sampler to purchase, I was disappointed that I had to get the raspberry one with my order considering I bake raspberry swirl cheesecakes myself.  But in hindsight, I think it was good to have Junior's for comparison and sorry, Junior- yours cannot hold a candle to mine.  My raspberry swirl cheesecakes are so much tastier, with fewer and better ingredients, no preservatives or things that I cannot pronounce and they sit on a thick graham cracker base.The loser of the three was the devil's food cake, the one that I was looking most forward to because my sisters and bestie all wanted that one.  Methinks they're going to be sorely disappointed.  It was too rich.  The red velvet wasn't bad.My conclusion is I will probably not order for deliver ever again, unless I go the the restaurant itself and try out in person the other flavors that I really wanted, which was the plain/original and the strawberry shortcake one.  It was just too expensive to order all that cheesecake and pay all that shipping for possibly something I was going to hate.  Maybe next time I'm in NYC...P.S.- I posted a photo of what showed up on my doorstep.",2.0
Rating on cheesecake only otherwise it was a 1. The table next to ours was ordering dinner and the overpowering stench of the fish turned out whole table off . Fish that smells that strong has gone bad. Place looked tired and old- time for a facelift.,3.0
"DISCLAIMER: Five Stars is only for the Cheesecake which is always outstanding.The restaurant is typical, old fashioned ""Mel's Diner"" (from Alice) diner fare and it was waaaay overpriced. It wasn't disgusting, but I wouldn't go back for anything other than dessert.  Customer service was great and we were seated quickly which was great because it was a very cold night during Thanksgiving weekend 2012.",5.0
Got the open faced roastbeef delivered. Was very dissatisfied.  The bread was drowned in watery juice Gross! The juice/gravy didn't have much of a taste either.  And to top it off they forgot my fries. I didn't complain because it was an office retirement party luncheon. Overpriced glorified diner,1.0
"My friend wanted to try this place out before leaving NY. It was better than we expected!! The service was awesome!! Our waiter was so friendly and helpful. The free apps were plentiful! There were pickles, cole slaw, and beets (which is weird). Also, there was corn bread and other breads. We order only two dishes because our waiter told us the portions were large. We ordered sweet potato fries for a side, the chicken parm spaghetti and the spicy chicken and rice. Both dishes came with salads. They were indeed large portions. Three of us finished all of it. We will definitely come back here.The atmosphere is very relaxed. Great for families!!!! This place is huge!!!I totally want to try their cheesecakes. They're on display in the front of the restaurant. They even have mini cheesecakes if you don't want the big ones!!",4.0

"As a resident of NYC and a proud Brooklynite one question often asked by visitors is ""have you been to Juniors and how is it"". My reply is always ""go for the cheesecake.""

"A Brooklyn staple that has long been a family destination growing up as a kid in the neighborhood.My grandfather would shout ""I want coffee and cheesecake!"" and we'd all jump in his huge Chrysler New Yorker that had a bench seat in the front (Three people buckled up in the front seat, what a concept??) and drive to Junior's.I've been taking my family to Brooklyn to see old family homes and to eat at restaurants that we would frequent as kids.My oldest son has been acting like a big shot because he had a ""Pastrami burger"" at a deli in Long Island. He wanted a full blown pastrami sandwich. I told him its a block buster of a sandwich, are you sure?? He chickened out!My wife & I spilt a corned beef sandwich, son #1 burger and son #2 chicken fingers.Now just a few things I noticed over the past 10 years. First, all of the ""All you can eat"" chinese buffets as well as Chinese food sit down places with tablecloths have all but disappeared in Long Island. The same with any good place to go for deli. I guess American palates are changing.We all ordered cheesecake and coffee. Just like my grandparents did back in the day.I get it now. Yeah, the cheesecake bring back memories.

"Rarely do I ever give a place a whole four stars but Juniors deserves this.  My mothers decided to bring me here after giving birth to me.  Hey maybe the cheesecake craving kicked in, not sure.  I kid you not the cheese cake hasn't changed since I was younger.  Brooklyn has obviously changed for the good most people would agree, but this change has ran plenty of business out of business.  It's nice to see Juniors holding its ground. I'll always return.",5.0
"All these 5 star reviews are blowing my mind. I had literally the worst food experience I've had in New York at this place. Don't get me wrong, I love Junior's cheesecake as much as the next guy, but the food at this restaurant is horrendous. I ordered buffalo chicken tenders and steak fries. The chicken tenders were the most bizarre thing I've ever received at a restaurant. Terrible, soggy frozen chicken tenders, soaked in some kind of red sugary sour sauce. NOT buffalo sauce by any means. It was so disgusting I took one bite and refused to eat another. The steak fries were also terrible. Frozen, unsalted, extremely potatoe-y and flavorless. They just taste like starch. My friend and I were so shocked after tasting the food we wanted to leave immediately. We hastily asked the server to have it wrapped, paid, left, and then threw it in the garbage once we were outside.I'm still reeling at how bad this experience was.",1.0
"A Brooklyn institution for so many years, Juniors does not disappoint. My family and I went for breakfast and it was perfect. The food ordered was delicious as well as the pastries they provide.

Pictures line the walls of the stars that hail from here as well as a tribute to the Brooklyn dodgers. It's what Brooklyn is all about. And make sure you have some world famous cheesecake.",5.0
"Juniors is one of those places you have to go to.  Especially if you're new to Brooklyn.  As a native I haven't been to juniors in a while, but as soon as I walked in I felt at ease. As always the cheesecake was bomb, freshest cherries I've ever seen on a desert item.  The waiters and servers need to communicate better though, our drink order got switched a couple times and it was annoying.",4.0
"The dining environment is really nice. Even with lots of tables in one room, I didn't feel crowded. The combo Reuben is really good. But the beef burger is just so-so. The chef forgot to put any salt in it so it just tastes like an one-inch beef chunk without any flavor :/ Hardly finish it with pickles and marinated beets. Besides this, the service is pretty nice and food service is pretty speedy.",4.0
Shrimp bisque and fried chicken for me. So much to choice from. I love my hometown spot.,4.0
"Famous place and the prices reflect it. Woo! Goodness. Anyways, I had breakfast here (you can get breakfast anytime) and it was average. I was more impressed by the complimentary appetizer which is a coleslaw and pickle. They are both fresh and homemade. Loved it and I didn't share it with my lunch date (sorry). I have also gotten a turkey sandwich for takeout from here. The sandwich is maaaassssive. I ate half that was enough to full me. I ate the other half the next day with the fancy mustard packet it came with and it was even better. The sandwich is too expensive to get on a daily basis for lunch but it is good. I didn't have the cheesecake which everyone is raving about because I don't eat cheesecake but it is overpriced for a slice. I don't care what it tastes like. Seriously, spend a little more and get a whole meal.",4.0

"Went with my girl to do her taxes downtown yesterday and she had never been to Juniors so we decided to have lunch. I probably have been here in 25 years and it looks exactly the same. I kinda liked that.  Wasnt crazy about the very small table we were given, barely enough room to hold all the comps they give you. Pickles,cole slaw,corn bread,rolls and the best of all pickled beets with red onions. We made quick work of that dish. Very yummy.    I had the soup and half sandwich combo. The shrimp bisque was just ok. The shrimps in it were, well shrimpy. It was one of those dishes that taste kinda good and then starts to just feel repetitive. I had the pastrami on rye and it was good but a bit too lean. They have their own mustard but I think its just licensed Guldens.   My girl had the fried seafood platter and she seemed happy with it, I had a scallop and it was pretty good. The fries we split were decent diner fries. We split a piece of pineapple cheesecake because thats what you do at Juniors and it was good as it's always been.    The problem was the service, my girl ordered a frozen pina colada and they brought her a ""virgin"" one. She kept complaining she couldnt taste the rum in it and when the waiter finally returned at the end of our meal she asked him why it was so weak and he said ""well you asked for a virgin"". We both said she did not. Now my girl only looks like she is 16 (shes 25) and not sure if he took it on himself to give her the virgin one. However after we pointed it out I was a little upset to see it still on the check. Didnt want to make a big deal out of 7 bucks so he just got a smaller tip.

"Junior's is a diner? I never had before because cheesecake has never been on my palate's top 25 delightful foods. Junior's has never been an eager destination for me to go. This place has a bit of an atmophere of a diner from a few decades back, with their colorful striped seating and mirrors everywhere. There are several sections besides the diner feel: the bakery section as you enter, the tiny bar like seating, the back room, cafe and window seating. This place is big and their menu has a good variety to choose from including steaks, jerked chicken, seafood, soups, barbecue, breakfast all day, sundaes, sandwiches and of course what they are known for: their cheesecakes.The cheesecake is a 4 star cheesecake, it does live up to worth trying, even if you're not a big fan of cheesecake, like me. The Chocolate Swirl is I guess one can consider a four layer cheesecake. The bottom is a dark crust (not burnt), soft and lightly crusty, good texture. The layer above is a chocolate cheesecake and their is not much chocolate flavor. The layer above is the regular (vanilla) cheesecake, and it is smooth, lightly flavored (without the strong cheese flavor) and sweetened just right. The top layer is a hardened crust that has a good swirl of chocolate. Yum, worth the $15.95 for our small pie of cheesecake.I want to put my stamp of ""Overrated/Overhyped and Overpriced"" here but I won't.

"Junior's is a diner? I never had before because cheesecake has never been on my palate's top 25 delightful foods. Junior's has never been an eager destination for me to go. This place has a bit of an atmophere of a diner from a few decades back, with their colorful striped seating and mirrors everywhere. There are several sections besides the diner feel: the bakery section as you enter, the tiny bar like seating, the back room, cafe and window seating. This place is big and their menu has a good variety to choose from including steaks, jerked chicken, seafood, soups, barbecue, breakfast all day, sundaes, sandwiches and of course what they are known for: their cheesecakes.The cheesecake is a 4 star cheesecake, it does live up to worth trying, even if you're not a big fan of cheesecake, like me. The Chocolate Swirl is I guess one can consider a four layer cheesecake. The bottom is a dark crust (not burnt), soft and lightly crusty, good texture. The layer above is a chocolate cheesecake and their is not much chocolate flavor. The layer above is the regular (vanilla) cheesecake, and it is smooth, lightly flavored (without the strong cheese flavor) and sweetened just right. The top layer is a hardened crust that has a good swirl of chocolate. Yum, worth the $15.95 for our small pie of cheesecake.I want to put my stamp of ""Overrated/Overhyped and Overpriced"" here but I won't. It's not overrated or overhyped because food though average; what they are known for: cheesecake, is good. But it is slightly over priced.",3.0

"After I made the move across country and settled on living in Brooklyn, people kept telling me that I should immediately go try the cheesecake and Junior's, which is only a few blocks away. Juniors has been around since 1950 and the diner is nostalgic for many New Yorkers.Tonight, I was finally craving something sweet--and it wasn't freezing--so I made the trek over to pick up a chocolate swirl cheesecake. Hoping the quest for the ""best"" cheesecake, as eater's kept saying, was over, I carted it home with delight. I expected a slight crisp on the top edges of the cake, the cheese forming a natural crust in the oven, a smooth, creamy texture inside, and a final cookie crunch of the crust. Instead I found the cheesecake overpoweringly sweet and the sides of cheesecake had an odd stale flavor.

"BEST. CHEESECAKE. EVER!!!Straight-forward, to the point. We had the classic. We had coffee and tea. The atmosphere (retro-sincere-tacky), was awesome.Do yourself a favor and have cheesecake at Junior's at least once in your life.I do plan to go back for the food one of these days ... till then, Junior's gets a 5 for the obvious.",5.0
"After I made the move across country and settled on living in Brooklyn, people kept telling me that I should immediately go try the cheesecake and Junior's, which is only a few blocks away. Juniors has been around since 1950 and the diner is nostalgic for many New Yorkers.Tonight, I was finally craving something sweet--and it wasn't freezing--so I made the trek over to pick up a chocolate swirl cheesecake. Hoping the quest for the ""best"" cheesecake, as eater's kept saying, was over, I carted it home with delight. I expected a slight crisp on the top edges of the cake, the cheese forming a natural crust in the oven, a smooth, creamy texture inside, and a final cookie crunch of the crust. Instead I found the cheesecake overpoweringly sweet and the sides of cheesecake had an odd stale flavor. The artificially sweet flavor that lingered after every bite was too strong, and while texture shortcomings are challenging to overlook, the artificial sweetness made me put my fork down. If you're going to indulge, make sure it's worth it--consider whether you are looking for nostalgia or fresh flavor, before carting one home with you.",2.0

"I went here on a date, and both the boy and the cheesecake were winners. We each ordered a slice of the plain cheesecake, and it was just under $6 for a slice.

"First of all, 5 stars for the service.  Excellent!  My colleague and I both had the matzo ball soup and shared the plate of potato pancakes.  I have to say the soup was a little bland, and the potato pancakes a little bready, but I still enjoyed both.  What the rest of my table got were the pastrami and corned beef sandwiches which they all LOVED.  They did look great.  Also I loved the free pickles they have on the table when you first sit down.  Would love to go back and try the turkey rueben since I don't eat meat.  They also have all day breakfast which was tempting.",4.0
"I have only dined here once maybe a dozen years ago- a memory too distant to fairly compare. Junior's, if course, is widely known, and therefore must provide a certain minimum expectation to get past the minimum mark of one star. In one sentence: slow, neglectful service, except for the waiter's lip service that he's ""here for me,"" and tasteless, poor ingredient food. Some detail: I ordered the ""steakburger,"" which is a totally inappropriate use of the term as this was clearly the lowest grade chuck meat, and needed flavoring or at least SALT. It was cooked longer than necessary for my asked ""medium-rare,"" and was not hot enough once our table was plated(probably because it sat on the window waiting for the slow, incompetent waiter to pick up). The fries were surely sourced  from a frozen artificial means, and also could use SALT or some flavor to their bodiless nutrition. Now, I ordered the original cheesecake to experience their gold standard ""tried and true"" product, and was underwhelmed. The thin layer on the bottom (cookie crumb crap?)distracted from the flavor of the overall cake. The uppermost layer was too stiff as if somehow left in the fridge too long and even a good amount of tapping with my fork would not break it's skin. I can't totally scap the cheesecake, because it was ""au-aight,"" but the consistency was not uniform; to use an analogy of earth science and rocks, it felt like my mouth was tearing into sedimentary layers of different rock types instead of the delicious customary single layer of sand. Ok, not a great analogy, but some of the cake was stiff and dry, while other parts seemed creamier. It just felt like they did not care to love their signature product.",1.0

Made it to the motherland today!  The original location!  I have mail ordered many a cheesecake from Juniors and they have all been delicious.  After Di Fara we drove over here to get a cheesecake to go.  We were going to go with straight up strawberry but they didnt have any plain.  They only had one with a crumb topping.  We got a small one and I was hoping and praying that crumb topping didnt mess it up.  Well....it might have made it better.  The crumb topping is the same type of crumbs they use for old school candied apples.  It was soooooo good!  Juniors does cheesecake with a sponge cake bottom.  It was so rich and delicious.  The strawberries were great and that crumb topping set it over the top.  Juniors makes the best cheesecakes in the world!  Hands down!  It was amazing as usual!,5.0

"I like the decor and the feeling you get when you're in Junior's, a true Brooklyn establishment. From what I understand from my friends, the entrees are middling in quality, but the cheesecakes I've had there have been good, and I like that they provide cole slaw, pickles, beets, and bread plates to your table gratis, and that they're not lazy about water refills. It seems like a miniscule thing to consider, but sometimes a man just needs his water and he needs a lot of it, and it seems the waiters at Junior's are happy to oblige. All the service I've had here has been very polite. So polite that the last time I was there in February 2012, a person in my group who was so drunk he threw up at the table more than once was not asked to leave and no one was mean to him. They just politely cleaned it up and moved on. The staff may very well have been fuming on the inside (we were all embarrassed of this guy and wished he would just go home, but instead he ate cheesecake after puking which, of course, he also ended up barfing minutes later), but to our faces they handled the situation very calmly and quickly.

"Famous for their cheesecakes but I wasn't impressed with them as much as their pastrami - it's to die for!  Packed with flavor and literally melts in your mouth.  A little expensive and formal for lunch but definitely worth a trip if you go to Brooklyn.  Didn't care for the Matzo ball soup, but the BLT was huge, enough to feed 2 people, plus they give you extras which we didn't know about - pickled beets and pickles, so you do get alot of food for the price.  Will definitely go back the next time I'm in Brooklyn.",4.0

"I went to Junior's in Downtown Brooklyn for New Year's Day, and I have to say I don't know what is the big hype about this place.I ordered Sausage, Egg (Sunny side up), Home Fries, and it came with an orange slice. The meal wasn't great, the eggs were runny and made me want to throw it away. The Home Fries was okay but I had better. The Sausage was pretty good. This meal wasn't filling at all.I can't rate the cheesecake because I am not a cheesecake fan.I would say that if you want to get a good breakfast I would say go to the Ihop's a few blocks away.",2.0
"Famous for their cheesecakes but I wasn't impressed with them as much as their pastrami - it's to die for!  Packed with flavor and literally melts in your mouth.  A little expensive and formal for lunch but definitely worth a trip if you go to Brooklyn.  Didn't care for the Matzo ball soup, but the BLT was huge, enough to feed 2 people, plus they give you extras which we didn't know about - pickled beets and pickles, so you do get alot of food for the price.  Will definitely go back the next time I'm in Brooklyn.",4.0
"I've never been a big fan of cheesecake, but since Junior's was featured on Chowdown Countdown, I decided to trek to Brooklyn to the original restaurant-bakery for some world-renowed NY-style cheesecake. static1.px.yelpcdn.com/b…I barely glanced at their extensive menu, which featured a plethora of amazing desserts (static1.px.yelpcdn.com/b…), before declaring to my server that I simply wanted a slice of plain cheesecake. Moments later, he returned with a glass of ice water and a slice of what appeared to be your everyday cheesecake.static1.px.yelpcdn.com/b…Looks can be deceiving.Even before I finished swallowing my first bite, I instantly understood why Junior's was so famous. The bottom layer was not the typical graham cracker crust of most cheesecakes; instead it was reminiscent of an angel food cake, airy and moist, and absolutely heavenly. The scrumptious cheese filling was tangy and fairly light in both texture and richness, blending perfecting with the spongy base to just dissolve in your mouth.static1.px.yelpcdn.com/b…The very top layer of the cheesecake was slightly richer, though beautifully golden and flaky, with a more prominent hint of vanilla. My waiter Osmond had mentioned that Junior's cheesecakes were made daily in the upstairs bakery, attributing to the freshness of the amazing dessert.Each bite of tangy lemon and smooth cheese filling melted in my mouth, until I was left with nothing but crumbs, which I shamelessly licked off my plate. Overall, an AMAZING experience. The flaky lightness of such a typically rich dessert is truly a skill mastered by Junior's bakery.",5.0
My son and I were sat at a table by the windows facing the street. This made for nice people watching and enabled me to keep an eye on my car that I was sure I would get a ticket on. The waiter was friendly and didn't seem to mind when I told him we were only having dessert. We split a large slice of decadent cheesecake with strawberries on top. Delicious! I also had a cup of coffee that tasted very fresh. I will definitely be returning again in the future and my mom loves that she can have the cheesecake delivered to her in Boca.,4.0
"We went to Junior's for lunch, and I loved the retro charm.  Diner decor and classic music playing in the background.  My husband loved that he could get a beer in a diner.  I ordered unsweetened ice tea, which was good.  To start, the server brought us a little bowl of pickled beets, one of my favorites.  Another bowl contained slaw covered with pickle spears.  Good slaw, but the pickles tasted a bit medicinal.  We ordered grilled cheese sandwiches with fries.  I had mine on challah bread, which I loved.We returned for breakfast.  With an entree order, you receive juice and pastries/bread.  I got the vegetable omelet with cheddar, accompanied by home fries.  As hungover hungry as I was, I could not finish this massive amount of food.The prices are not diner prices, which was the only thing that informed us that we were not in a time warp.  Both visits featured friendly, prompt servers.  I would definitely return if I go back to Brooklyn.",4.0
"I discovered Junior's when I came to college --I am now 70 years old, having relocated to the great borough of Brooklyn-- so my take on it is very nostalgic, beyond their vintage-y vibe. Junior's cheesecake is just the best...period. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise! I prefer the classic plain, but the strawberry is delish, too. I have a few other menu favorites that are standards: The breakfast basket, brimming with fresh-baked assorted rolls and mini danish; home made corned beef HASH; pastrami on twin onion rolls...YUM. The last may be just a tad fatty, but, hey, It's pastrami. But by far, what I like most about Junior's is the family that owns it. Over the last few years, as written up in the local media, developers offered $ millions to take over the property...and the Rosens (who I have never met) didn't sell out. Brooklynites sure do appreciate that dedication to our borough and rich tradition, as well!PS. Their location in the theater district in Manhattan offers a good nosh-before-the-show option.",4.0
"I suppose, it's one of the places you have to hit up at one point in your life.  For the most part, I don't think you'll miss much.  The food is ""meh"", but the cheesecake lives up to the hype.  It's also waaaaaay over priced in my opinion.  If you want regular diner food, go someplace else.",2.0
Ehh I mean it is Junior's if you are coming here for the Cheesecake then alright it is good. I know there are times when I do have a craving for it.  My slice of choice is the strawberry cheesecake YUM YUM !! I have never had any of the others so I cannot speak for them.  I have had lunch here twice and the food has been alright both time there were no complaints from me.  The 3 stars is mainly because I feel that they are overpriced. Yes they give you a good amount of food with your entree as well as the free bites before your meal but the cheesecake is expensive as are their meals.  It is something that for me the quality of the food I only would eat here once in a while.  Will I be back sure probably because I would get the cheesecake but am I running through their door ehh nopee not even close,3.0
Went to Juniors last night and tried the Little Fella cheesecakes (pineapple and blueberry) they were amazing but cost a lot considering it took me 5 bites to finish it. Im a huge cheesecake fan and I think its worth trying at least once. And Yes I will repeat....on payday,4.0
"Just like those who have reviewed Junior's before, this is the quintessential Brooklyn stop for tourists and some of the NY residents alike. I've gone here several times over the past year and it has not let me down. Most recently, we took guests from VA here this past Sunday and they were not disappointed. We had a party of 10 and needed a table stat. We were seated by 1230 no problem!To start, you get the complimentary cornbread/rolls. The cornbread is sooo good. I can't remember the last time I had cornbread so moist but not overly greasy which tends to be the case. Excellently done in my opinion. We all proceeded to order separate things but I got the Southern fried chicken breast with mashed potatoes and fries. This again was good and very satisfying. I've had better in the South but this hit the mark for my craving of fried chicken. What I loved was what Junior's is well known for, their cheesecake. I ordered the apple crumb cheesecake and it was rich and crunchy and smooth and delicious and orgasmic. And I mean every single word. I tried to leave some to take home but I devoured the entire thing there. Extra calories be damned!Overall, my guests were happy eating at Junior's. Consider my a regular there anytime I'm in the area!",4.0

"When I want a NY cheesecake, this is what my mouth waters for.  This was my final stop before leaving Brooklyn to come home.  I made my friend sit in the car as I drove around 4 times looking for a place to park, finally I double parked it (everyone's doing it, even the cop ahead of me in line) and made Brendan wait in the car as I got my slice of heaven.I prefer the plain, there is nothing like it- cheesey, creamy and dreamy!  I brought a 2nd fork and wishing I hadn't, the man who doesn't like dessert grew a broad grin as his first bite of cheesecake melted in his mouth.I've never eaten inside a Junior's so I can't remark on their service but I can tell you this is the BEST cheesecake I have EVER eaten, and don't nobody go telling my mom I said that!",5.0

It seemed like a good way to celebrate and remember her. The cheesecake was awesome!! It was way too much for my two person household, so I cut it into 3 large pieces and froze them individually. Tasted just as good after thawing out. I think it was about $35-40 delivered.",5.0

Unfortunately their service was the deal breaker.My bf and I came here on a Saturday night to get dinner before a show at the Barclay's Center. We arrived at 6:30 and it was already popping. There were a good number of people waiting to be seated. I asked to be seated and the manager rudely mumbled something and walked away. I waited for the hostess to come back and she seated us right away.We waited at our table for about 15 minutes before even being greeted and brought some water. We ordered some cocktails that took another 10 minutes to arrive at our table. We finally ordered and I thought ""okay it should get better from here on out,"" but unfortunately that was not the case. We ordered burgers and when they arrived they were lukewarm at best. It appeared as though they had been sitting for a while before someone brought it to our table. We then asked one of the other servers passing through if we could have extra napkins and he said ""sure"" but continued to pass by us without bringing them. I walked up to our server and he said that he was not the server and arrived at our table 5 minutes later to say that he was actually our server. I don't understand how that kind of confusion can possible happen. I was a bit of a struggle to get any employee's attention.

I debated on giving it 1 or 2 stars. The customer service is what garnered the extra star. The food is GROSS. Let me repeat... The food. Is. Gross. I ordered soup. It was totally from a can.

I knew he loved cheesecake, because every time he orders some in New Jersey, he talks about how it's not a ""real New York cheesecake."" But this mention of Junior's was new. So for his 77th birthday, I had a plain cheesecake delivered from Junior's. Oh my gosh. He was beyond deliriously happy. My mom too, and she doesn't really like cheesecake. Apparently it came very securely wrapped so that nothing would happen to it in transit, and it was incredibly fresh. Believe me, my dad would have told me if it sucked or was just so-so. No, he thought it was beyond great.Am so relieved. At his age, he doesn't need a bunch of stuff to clutter up the house some more. He just wants simple things like comfort foods that make him happy and bring back good memories. Yay, Junior's!",5.0

Wasn't really feeling the gelatinous strawberries. Otherwise the cheesecake itself is on point. Now, if only their savory options are just as good. 3 stars... all for the cheesecake.",3.0
"After the seeing Junior's featured on the Food Network, Cooking Channel and in my sweet surrender dreams at night (over and over again) we knew for damn sure this was going to be one of the main stops for us while we vacay in NYC.We stopped in at this particular Junior's (the original), 2 nights in a row. The 2nd night, we actually walked over a mile (in the cold!) from the restaurant we had dinner at just to get another slice of heaven from Junior's.This review is just for the desserts here at Junior's.Slice of Original New York Cheesecake: Best cheesecake of my life! If someone raped me and handed me a slice of this creamy, decadent goodness, I'd probably end up raping my rapist right after. :)Slice of Strawberry Shortcake Cheesecake: The strawberry cheesecake part was very, very dense and sweet...but good! It paired well with the actual shortcake, which was super moist.Red Velvet Cupcake: HUGE! Like triple the size of a normal cupcake you see at other bakeries. I ended up having this 2 nights later after leaving it on our hotel room desk. Couldn't believe how MOIST the cake part still was. Unfortunately, since I left it out, I couldn't enjoy the cream cheese icing on top, but I could tell it would have tasted amazing if I had it fresh. Honestly, if the SBBF didn't smell it to tell me the icing might have gone bad, I would have definitely devoured that whole cupcake!Black & White Cookie: Is this really a NEW YORK thing? Uggghh, why?! I want to be able to have these huge delicious, cakey cookies here in Cali! We shared this cookie in bed and let me tell you, the flavor is just as amazing as the nookie nookie we had on that bed. :)Major brownie, or shall I say cheesecake points for the Junior's staff for being so friendly and efficient when we dined there. Junior's will now always be the first place we hit up when we're back in NY!",5.0

There are small armies, both in quantity and height, that couldn't have finished that sandwich with three mouths and an extra plate scraper.Was it good? I dunno, it was a reuben and it would have made Sally at Katz's too freaking tired and full to do any faking it. How can anything still be that good after spending that much time eating it? But it was tasty enough and filling and most importantly the fries were crispy, which is, in and of itself, of mammoth import.In other news, they have free refills on Diet Coke. Do you know how important that is to the decision making process?** - Critically.",3.0
I debated on giving it 1 or 2 stars. The customer service is what garnered the extra star. The food is GROSS. Let me repeat... The food. Is. Gross. I ordered soup. It was totally from a can. I couldn't eat anything else really because they have no healthy vegetarian options. I won't ever go back.,2.0
"Staff has always been friendly whenever i go there. Love their trio platter with shrimp, chicken and ribs! Not crazy about their chicken tenders - too meaty and the French fries are fat, and to not very tasty. But I will go back because of the platter and their cakes. However, they are a little overpriced. The giant chocolate chip cookie looks very good also. Will definitely be trying that the next time u go back",3.0
"We ordered three cakes. Original, Strawberry and Carrot Cake cheesecake.  I'm not a big fan of the cake bottom ( instead of graham cracker crust).  The actual filing was excellent. A little too pricey, but worth the experience.Not the best parking to come here on busy Flatbush Ave, so have a plan before coming.",4.0
"Only reviewing the cheesecake:  I'm gonna be really forward here.  I think the cheesecake here is over priced, over rated, and over hyped.  but if you really need to try the cheesecake, strawberry cheesecake is the way to go.",2.0
"I recommend the delivery service whole-heartedly for hard-to-please cheesecake connoisseurs.Recently my dad had been waxing nostalgic about the cheesecake at Junior's. I knew he loved cheesecake, because every time he orders some in New Jersey, he talks about how it's not a ""real New York cheesecake."" But this mention of Junior's was new. So for his 77th birthday, I had a plain cheesecake delivered from Junior's. Oh my gosh. He was beyond deliriously happy. My mom too, and she doesn't really like cheesecake. Apparently it came very securely wrapped so that nothing would happen to it in transit, and it was incredibly fresh. Believe me, my dad would have told me if it sucked or was just so-so. No, he thought it was beyond great.Am so relieved. At his age, he doesn't need a bunch of stuff to clutter up the house some more. He just wants simple things like comfort foods that make him happy and bring back good memories. Yay, Junior's!",5.0
"Perhaps it was the 2 Brothers Pizza in Flatbrush, that got me sipping the NYC haterade in terms of food spots so far.A lot of my fellow Yelp buddies (and many other NY locals) appreciate this place with utmost respect.I came in and tried the Cheesecake and when I asked which was their most popular flavors it was between Strawberry or the Plain.All I need to say is, I should have opted for the plain. Wasn't really feeling the gelatinous strawberries. Otherwise the cheesecake itself is on point. Now, if only their savory options are just as good. 3 stars... all for the cheesecake.",3.0
"After the seeing Junior's featured on the Food Network, Cooking Channel and in my sweet surrender dreams at night (over and over again) we knew for damn sure this was going to be one of the main stops for us while we vacay in NYC.We stopped in at this particular Junior's (the original), 2 nights in a row. The 2nd night, we actually walked over a mile (in the cold!) from the restaurant we had dinner at just to get another slice of heaven from Junior's.This review is just for the desserts here at Junior's.Slice of Original New York Cheesecake: Best cheesecake of my life! If someone raped me and handed me a slice of this creamy, decadent goodness, I'd probably end up raping my rapist right after. :)Slice of Strawberry Shortcake Cheesecake: The strawberry cheesecake part was very, very dense and sweet...but good! It paired well with the actual shortcake, which was super moist.Red Velvet Cupcake: HUGE! Like triple the size of a normal cupcake you see at other bakeries. I ended up having this 2 nights later after leaving it on our hotel room desk. Couldn't believe how MOIST the cake part still was. Unfortunately, since I left it out, I couldn't enjoy the cream cheese icing on top, but I could tell it would have tasted amazing if I had it fresh. Honestly, if the SBBF didn't smell it to tell me the icing might have gone bad, I would have definitely devoured that whole cupcake!Black & White Cookie: Is this really a NEW YORK thing? Uggghh, why?! I want to be able to have these huge delicious, cakey cookies here in Cali! We shared this cookie in bed and let me tell you, the flavor is just as amazing as the nookie nookie we had on that bed. :)Major brownie, or shall I say cheesecake points for the Junior's staff for being so friendly and efficient when we dined there. Junior's will now always be the first place we hit up when we're back in NY!",5.0
"Never had a meal here, but the cheesecake is to die for.  Just a word of advice (and some others here said the same thing and they are sooo right), don't kill the cheesecake with sauces and added flavors, KEEP IS SIMPLE... order plain cheesecake (perhaps with some strawberries).",5.0
"Last time I went to Juniors had to be a couple of years ago when I had family in town.  It's great diner food, and ridiculously luscious desserts.I ordered the german chocolate cake.  I know I know, if I don't know what I""m ordering I shouldn't order it.  But I don't like coconut, so I was stuck eating the chocolate frosting off the top.  Which was very yummy mind you.  That and a scoop of chocolate ice cream which did seem to really hit the spot.I have to say I enjoyed having to go UPSTAIRS to get to the bathroom.  Most restos make you go downstairs.  So that was a twist.  What's more I really liked the old-school circa 1970's decor that in no way needs an upgrade.  That and the still hanging christmas decorations.  Woohoo!Oh and one more thing, despite what MDs might have you believe, vinyl wood panelling is not *CAMPY* unless it was put there intentionally.  If it was put there because it was stylish 40 years ago, that's something entirely different!",3.0
"It goes without saying that Junior's has THE BEST CHEESECAKE in New York, and quite possibly, the world. The food on the other hand, not so much, but that's a non issue because everyone knows that CHEESECAKE is the only reason to go to Junior's. (If you did otherwise, then you have failed in life!) I grew up gorging on this decadent goodness, and the strawberry cheesecake continues to be a staple at our holiday dinners -- even though the price tag is much higher and my metabolism is much slower. I do however take issue with the whole strawberries that aren't hulled or sliced. It is very unsexy when I have to spit out the stem base. Or worst yet, when I choke on a whole strawberry. (Serves me right for being greedy, but still... )Other than that, I love me some Junior's cheesecake forevs!",5.0
"I had a great experience at juniors. I went there with a buddy a some time ago. The atmosphere was great, not too loud, not too quiet and the music playing complimented the atmosphere very well.The service was very good. If ever we needed anything the waiter was there immediately. At a place like this, if you're planning to get dinner with a semi-large party, it wouldn't hurt to make a reservation so there's no trouble at the door.Oh and of course, their cheesecake was absolutely amazing! I could eat that all day long if I had to. Don't forget the cheesecake, you definitely won't regret it.",4.0
Large diner.  Has 3 distinct area's to enjoy a meal.  Diner food mind you.  I had the jerk chicken - it was ok.  My friend had the meatloaf . . That was actually quite good.The cheesecake IS THE BEST in NYC!!!  Many different flavors to choose from.  We picked a strawberry and a raspberry.  Excellent!!,3.0
"I'm not from New York, so Junior's only meant  ""cheesecake"" to me, since that's what they will ship and cheesecake would make my Brooklyn-born wife happy (quiet) during her exile in Dallas. It turns out Junior's is actually a diner - it has an insanely large menu, breakfast all day, a full bar and more. We met two of my wife's high school friends for lunch and the food was good, the service was very friendly, and nobody seemed to mind we took up a table for almost four hours. (We did have soup, entrees, and dessert, but that still seems like a long time.) So, after becoming used to being rushed in and out by staff trying to turn tables, it was very nice to find a staff member (thanks, Winston!) that was happy to refill drinks, wait twenty minutes to take an order because one of the party members was late, and in general provide excellent, personal service for an entire afternoon. One issue - which is not Junior's-specific - parking in the area is horrific. If you don't have to drive there, take the subway. There were three garages in the area, and they were all full. We finally found a spot on the street a couple of blocks away, so our designated driver had to run to feed the meter once an hour. (This does help make room for more cheesecake.)The food was good - I had the pastrami and corned beef combo, two rolls, one with each meat and fries. They were very filling. The matzo ball soup was amazing, and I am not a soup person. The German chocolate cake was very good, but by that point, I was stuffed. I'm sorry I didn't try the ""Something Different"" which is a brisket sandwich on potato pancakes with gravy. I think my arteries clogged just a little when it was placed on the table. The chocolate egg creams were very good. If you don't know what that is, just go order one. I'll wait. You'll come back to thank me. While it may not be the same as in it's heyday, it's still a good diner. Plus, there's always the cheesecake.",4.0

"Pastry's for sure are legendary, had the strawberry cheesecake and it was amazing. It's big enough for 2 people, so don't be afraid to share.

"I stopped by this place one day just for the cheesecake because I mean.... who moves down the street from WORLD FAMOUS Junior's and doesn't try their cheesecake? Well.... gotta say, really wasn't that impressed. I prefer a graham cracker bottom, but unfortunately they didn't have any. Only sponge cake- which I wasn't a fan off. They are also pretty pricey even for the plain.I also came here for lunch with some coworkers. I got a pastrami sandwich and ceaser salald. Really can't go wrong with that. However, my coworker got the french toast (menu item that seems pretty fool proof), and I could instantly tell by her face that she hated it. It didn't even look like french toast. I wish I had taken a picture. It looked like it was fried and crunchy- not adjectives that you hear when describing french toast. To top it off, our waitress was lousy. Service was slow, and she appeared to have an attitude everytime we asked her something. Even after telling her that we were in a rush because we had to get  back to work, she took about 10-15 minutes to even bring us out the check. Mind you, she was catering to only one other table.

I've had Junior's many occasions and while I do love the cakes it would not be fair to give them a great review due to an issue I had a few years back. I was in the city so I decided to go to the Brooklyn Junior's for a slice of cheesecake and a strawberry shortcake. I took my cakes back home to the BX and would you believe they sold me a bad cake! The strawberry shortcake was rotten. The preserves were sour. I kept eating small piece by small piece hoping it was just the flavor and I just gave up and threw it away. I was angry not only because strawberry shortcake is my favorite and that they are OVER PRICED but because I trekked there from where I was and it was out of the way plus an hour fifteen minute ride home.

"Junior's is what I think of when I'm imagining typical American food. Hubby and I stumbled across Junior's when we took a walk across the Brooklyn Bridge. We decided to go in as the prices seemed pretty cheap, it looked popular and we were after a more authentic American eating experience. We definitely weren't disappointed! I had Southern fried chicken with mash and corn and man was the serving huge! The meal was very tasty but I could not eat it all! Hubby had a gigantic layered sandwich which he struggled with even though he's a big eater. Though we were full we decided to share a piece of their famous cheesecake and I'm very glad we did. The cheesecake was so tasty and we couldn't get over the size of the strawberries on it!We'll definitely be back if we go to NY again",4.0
"Service was good and the food was your standard diner fare. I expected a nicer, less dinerish place it being so popular, but no, it's a diner.Their cheesecakes do rock, but I didn't have any on this trip and so the diner gets rated as a diner.",3.0
"Juniors cheesecake has to have roughly a gazillion calories per slice but I just can't resist their creamy oh so delicious slice of heaven. One bite and you'll be blown away~ It's been roughly two years since I've dined in here so I can't recall my dining experience but I remember it being a decent one. For $7; a slice of cheese cake is pretty expensive considering you're not in the city or anything but they do offer you a generous amount of cheesecake so no worries. I doubt you'll be able to finish the whole slice in one sitting though. Since the cheesecake is so rich and decadent, a few bites will leave you quite satisfied.",4.0

"As far as actual food is concerned, the food here is blah. I had the beef ribs which were gross. The bbq sauce they put on it was just watery, sugary ketchup at best. My brother got the beef goulash which was actually ok.Now on to the real reason for this review, the dessert! I actually came here because I wanted to get some more of their red velvet cake. See, a coworker of mine made the grave mistake of sharing some of her Junior's red velvet cake w/the me and i've been craving for it ever since. This is one of the best red velvet cake that i've had. It is DE-liscious!! I also tried the pumpkin cheesecake which was also great, you really taste the cream cheese and the pumpkin. I would never come back here for a meal, but all you have to utter is ""Junior's desserts"" and i'm there! Heck, i'll even drive!",4.0
"Great place for desserts!I came in as a I couldn't help but notice all the delicious cakes on the window.This place was a classic old skool joint- I was with two other people, we had an order of onion rings which were amazing.

We also enjoyed a slice of the red velvet cheesecake and the lemon curd coconut cake both were fresh and moist and so yummy!As a Seinfeld fan and someone from Canada I had to also try the infamous 'Black and White' cookie and man they were good! Nothing like I've ever had.Also their chocolate chip cookies were delicious- they had a ginger taste which worked perfectly and were so soft. I will definitely be back!",5.0

"Yesterday like most birthdays my co-workers and I bought a Junior's cake to celebrate the birthday of a colleague.

This dry crumbling cake was sold to us in what was an obvious attempt to sell cakes were not sold the post-Christmas blizzard of 2010. One colleague returned to the restaurant with the dry cake and requested another. One salesperson offered to 'go upstairs' and bring down a fresh cake. A second person behind the counter, a female lied to him and told him that fresh cakes were already available behind the counter. This second cake was worse than the first cake. Three of us returned to work today complaining of going home with 'issues'. The cream cheese icing tasted like a refrigerator and the cake was just as bad as the first. We called and were told we could come back for yet ANOTHER cake. Really? Are you kidding me?

"#JuniorsCheesecakes #Brooklyn ""Pastrami Reuben"": Yo! I never thought I would walk to Brooklyn for some fuckin' cheesecake, but I did and I also got a sandwich.  Let me tell you, when you first walk into Junior's, there's a mannequin wavin' his hand at you, don't, trip! It caught me off guard, but I was automatically welcomed by a sweet waitress by the name of Liberia, she reminded me of Michael Jackson's song, and she was sweet as pecan pie.  She made sure we were seated right away and that our waters never hit the halfway mark on the glass b.  That's what I call first class service.  Anyway, I'm a Reuben sandwich kind of guy so I had to give it try nah'imsayin?  But it wasn't anything of the norm, they had Rueben's with pastrami, why the fuck not.  I also ordered some thick ass steak fries with it as you can see. Now normally, you get two halves with your sandwich b, but I don't know where the fuck they get their bread from but I got 3 halves b like I was in some hockey game or some shit nahmean?  It came with this sauce, I don't know what it was exactly but it probably was their house thousand island dressing sauce b, I wanna call that shit 'The Cayman Islands' dressing b cause that shit had me feel like I was in some tropical shit but really I'm in Brooklyn while its rainin'.  I took a bite out of the sandwich and I thought I saw Jackie Robinson, which I did but it was a picture on the wall, but what I'm sayin' is, the bite was so surreal, I thought I saw JR42 walkin' across the back and MJ moon walkin' on the table and shit, that's how good this shit was b.  When you can't finish your food on the table, that's how you know they take care of you nah'imsayin?  Where I'm from we call that shit the Samoan portions.  I didn't even take it to go, I felt so generous I wanted to give em back the 3rd half.  To top it off I had a red velvet cheesecake.  That shit was like Thugz Mansion and watchin' J. Lo fall in her Louboutins, the shit hit the spot.  I almost asked shorty to pass the Courvoisier but really I wanted milk.  Let me tell you, if you wanna impress ya girl man, like yo you tryna make her take off her panties soon as you get back to the spot, order the red velvet cheesecake b.  I'm serious.  That's an automatic panty remover son.  Overall I give this meal a 5.5 out of 7 rating b. #MoochEats",4.0

Dense but light, sweet but not too sweet, fluffy but solid enough to give that cheesecake texture, and light on crust but still enough to make you know its there. Strawberries were light but sweet enough, and huge, covered in a glaze that wasn't too sweet either. The crumbles, whatever they are (cracker? butterfinger? candied nuts? not sure) are perfect finish.Seriously folks, best NY cheesecake. Bit on the pricey side ($20 for small size, but big enough to serve 4-5 people), up to $60 for a 20 slice wonder, but its worth the cost.LEGIT.",5.0

"I'm surprised that this place has good reviews.  Maybe it's just the difference in expectations between Seattle and NYC?  It was near our hotel in Brooklyn and recommended by them.  My hubby and I ordered that roast beef sandwich.  The beef was piled high and that's where the goodness ends.  The sandwich didn't have anything on it besides the meat and the meat was very dry.  The bread was supposed to be wheat but seemed like brown Wonder Bread.  We assumed it would come with fries or coleslaw or something on the side, but since it wasn't listed on the description I guess we should not have assumed.  They did bring us a bowl of pickles.  yippee.  For the price I expected more.  Glad we split the sandwich.My daughter had the chicken tender app.  There were a lot of them with a tiny little bowl of sauce.  Greasy and dry.  Need  I say more?And finally, since they are famous for cheesecake, we ordered the strawberry shortcake cheesecake.  It tasted old and the strawberry filling tasted canned.  Honestly, Sara Lee is better and cheaper.  Overall, we spent about $40 for an app, sandwich, 1 drink and 1 cheesecake and tax/tip.We tried it for breakfast the next day, anyway.  Our bad.  Over cooked omelets that came with that same tasteless ""wheat"" bread toast.  Nothing else came with that--no potatoes, no fruit garnish, nada.Instead of breakfast, I had a BLT.  Lots of bacon, cold white toast, just a tiny bit of lettuce and tomato.  Again, no fries or chips or fruit garnish of any kind.  Which I think is weird given the price and the fact that it's a sit down restaurant.I'm also a little confused by other reviews that say breakfast includes juice, pastry and home fries.  That wasn't true at the Brooklyn location.  (We got rolls and cornbread) I wonder why?As for service, it was good the first time, but the waiter was a hard to understand.  The second day, the hostess tried to seat us right in front of the bussing station even though there were plenty of empty tables near the window.  She seemed surprised when I asked for a different table.  Our waiter was friendly, but not very good.  He seemed a little surprised when I asked a couple of questions related to food allergies, had to come back to ask my husband what type of toast he wanted and then assumed my daughter wanted the same type.   He brought a drink that my daughter didn't order.  When the food came out they gave my husband's omelet to my daughter and vice versa.  They were similar omelets and it took a few bites before they realized it.  Good thing my daughter wasn't allergic to anything in my husband's omelet.If I wasn't going to steer clear of here because of the food, I'd stay away because I don't trust that they could be trusted to accommodate people with food allergies.",1.0

I don't know what to say  Felt like I was in the Deep South.. Normal cheesecake is great, but there was something off with this original. Go to one of their other outposts, much cleaner.",3.0
"#JuniorsCheesecakes #Brooklyn ""Pastrami Reuben"": Yo! I never thought I would walk to Brooklyn for some fuckin' cheesecake, but I did and I also got a sandwich.  Let me tell you, when you first walk into Junior's, there's a mannequin wavin' his hand at you, don't, trip! It caught me off guard, but I was automatically welcomed by a sweet waitress by the name of Liberia, she reminded me of Michael Jackson's song, and she was sweet as pecan pie.  She made sure we were seated right away and that our waters never hit the halfway mark on the glass b.  That's what I call first class service.  Anyway, I'm a Reuben sandwich kind of guy so I had to give it try nah'imsayin?  But it wasn't anything of the norm, they had Rueben's with pastrami, why the fuck not.  I also ordered some thick ass steak fries with it as you can see. Now normally, you get two halves with your sandwich b, but I don't know where the fuck they get their bread from but I got 3 halves b like I was in some hockey game or some shit nahmean?  It came with this sauce, I don't know what it was exactly but it probably was their house thousand island dressing sauce b, I wanna call that shit 'The Cayman Islands' dressing b cause that shit had me feel like I was in some tropical shit but really I'm in Brooklyn while its rainin'.  I took a bite out of the sandwich and I thought I saw Jackie Robinson, which I did but it was a picture on the wall, but what I'm sayin' is, the bite was so surreal, I thought I saw JR42 walkin' across the back and MJ moon walkin' on the table and shit, that's how good this shit was b.  When you can't finish your food on the table, that's how you know they take care of you nah'imsayin?  Where I'm from we call that shit the Samoan portions.  I didn't even take it to go, I felt so generous I wanted to give em back the 3rd half.  To top it off I had a red velvet cheesecake.  That shit was like Thugz Mansion and watchin' J. Lo fall in her Louboutins, the shit hit the spot.  I almost asked shorty to pass the Courvoisier but really I wanted milk.  Let me tell you, if you wanna impress ya girl man, like yo you tryna make her take off her panties soon as you get back to the spot, order the red velvet cheesecake b.  I'm serious.  That's an automatic panty remover son.  Overall I give this meal a 5.5 out of 7 rating b. #MoochEats",4.0
"I'm in love with Junior's cheesecakes! The bottom is made of some kind of fluffy cake, NOT graham crackers, and it's so rich and fluffy! What did you put in there?! I think after having a bite of the cheesecake here, I can never let myself go to the Cheesecake Factory ever again! I can't believe it took me so long to finally check out Junior's here too. I got the Original, which I deem as my favorite. I guess this is what they mean when they said NYC has the best cheesecake!The service was efficient when I first ate here with my family for lunch. The waitstaff was friendly for most of our time eating here. The food was alright. It was good but not mind-blowing like the cheesecakes! I will return for your delicious cheesecakes someday in your other locations, Junior's. As for this place, just check it out!",4.0
"If you are reading this, then you are on the fence. Listen - Just go. You won't regret it.Get the egg cream, matzo ball soup and a sandwich. Save room for cheesecake. Everything on the menu is really good, but go to the original place in Brooklyn.Juniors is one of the few places that figured out that pan fried chicken is the way to go. It's so juicy and delicious. If you go for it, you better be hungry or share with a friend because it's huge - the chicken must be the size of a velociraptor.",5.0

"I only had the strawberry cheesecake.And for the rest of my life, if I ate the cheesecake at Junior's, I'd die a happy man.The cheesecake is perfect here. Dense but light, sweet but not too sweet, fluffy but solid enough to give that cheesecake texture, and light on crust but still enough to make you know its there. Strawberries were light but sweet enough, and huge, covered in a glaze that wasn't too sweet either. The crumbles, whatever they are (cracker? butterfinger? candied nuts? not sure) are perfect finish.Seriously folks, best NY cheesecake. Bit on the pricey side ($20 for small size, but big enough to serve 4-5 people), up to $60 for a 20 slice wonder, but its worth the cost.LEGIT.",5.0

"I'm surprised that this place has good reviews.  Maybe it's just the difference in expectations between Seattle and NYC?  It was near our hotel in Brooklyn and recommended by them.  My hubby and I ordered that roast beef sandwich.  The beef was piled high and that's where the goodness ends.  The sandwich didn't have anything on it besides the meat and the meat was very dry.  The bread was supposed to be wheat but seemed like brown Wonder Bread.  We assumed it would come with fries or coleslaw or something on the side, but since it wasn't listed on the description I guess we should not have assumed.  They did bring us a bowl of pickles.  yippee.  For the price I expected more.  Glad we split the sandwich.My daughter had the chicken tender app.  There were a lot of them with a tiny little bowl of sauce.  Greasy and dry.  Need  I say more?And finally, since they are famous for cheesecake, we ordered the strawberry shortcake cheesecake.  It tasted old and the strawberry filling tasted canned.  Honestly, Sara Lee is better and cheaper.  Overall, we spent about $40 for an app, sandwich, 1 drink and 1 cheesecake and tax/tip.We tried it for breakfast the next day, anyway.  Our bad.  Over cooked omelets that came with that same tasteless ""wheat"" bread toast.  Nothing else came with that--no potatoes, no fruit garnish, nada.Instead of breakfast, I had a BLT.  Lots of bacon, cold white toast, just a tiny bit of lettuce and tomato.  Again, no fries or chips or fruit garnish of any kind.  Which I think is weird given the price and the fact that it's a sit down restaurant.I'm also a little confused by other reviews that say breakfast includes juice, pastry and home fries.  That wasn't true at the Brooklyn location.  (We got rolls and cornbread) I wonder why?As for service, it was good the first time, but the waiter was a hard to understand.  The second day, the hostess tried to seat us right in front of the bussing station even though there were plenty of empty tables near the window.  She seemed surprised when I asked for a different table.  Our waiter was friendly, but not very good.  He seemed a little surprised when I asked a couple of questions related to food allergies, had to come back to ask my husband what type of toast he wanted and then assumed my daughter wanted the same type.   He brought a drink that my daughter didn't order.  When the food came out they gave my husband's omelet to my daughter and vice versa.  They were similar omelets and it took a few bites before they realized it.  Good thing my daughter wasn't allergic to anything in my husband's omelet.If I wasn't going to steer clear of here because of the food, I'd stay away because I don't trust that they could be trusted to accommodate people with food allergies.",1.0

"I have been going to Juniors since the mid 90's and I have never had a bad meal there. The cheesecake is as good or better than you've heard, it's simply the best anywhere.

Here's my problem:  Juniors prices have come very close to doubling over the past ten or so years. While I appreciate the fact that there's inflation, it doesn't come close to justifying a $90.00 tab for two people ordering a seafood platter with a beer, Caesar Salad, soup, soda and mac&cheese with cheesecake for dessert.

We went to the iconic Junior's restaurant to get a taste of Old Brooklyn. Frankly the experience was horrible. From the moment we were seated things went badly. The waiter was downright unfriendly.

The dish just wasn't that good. I've had better food in random diners across NYC.I ordered the cheesecake. It was OK. I have gotten better cheesecakes at bakeries other bakeries in the neighborhood.

"This place was so good we came here 3 times in 5 days. I'm not kidding. 3 times. We always had a cup of coffee to warm up, and shared one variety of their world famous cheesecake for desert.The first night we tried the Chocolate Mousse cheesecake. This thing was huge! There was a layer of moose at least 2 inches thick, and a layer of cheesecake about the same. It was very good, but also very rich. I'd rank it as my third favorite.The second night we tried the raspberry swirl cheesecake. This was not quite as big, but still large for a slice of cheesecake and plenty for us to share for desert. It was superb and I'd highly recommend. Our third and final night, we tried the carrot cake cheesecake. We'd seen it in the window of the bakery the night before and couldn't help ourselves. This was the most amazing piece of cake I've ever had! It was also humongous. The cheesecake layer was at least 2 inches thick, and then carrot cake and frosting layers were another 4 inches, plus the creamy topping. I'd definitely get this one again!We sat at the bar all three nights and had the same server, who was nice, talkative, and remembered us each time which was nice. The one we didn't get to try was the blueberry cheesecake, which looked amazing. I guess that will have to wait for next time!",5.0

I looked at the lady she pointed at and she saw me and quickly scampered away not unlike a roach in the kitchen when you turn your light on. I guess she thought I was gonna ask for the money back. Which I was gonna do. So I guess the moral of the story is, this isn't the best neighborhood in the world. But the cheesecake is really good. Just hold hands with a friend when you come here.",4.0
"This is apparently one of the highest grossing restaurants in the US.  All the food here is meh, but you do get alot of it.  In fact, you pretty much get a whole meal worth of food mass before anything you actually order arrives, including pickles, cole slaw, cornbread, other types of bread, little pastry things, and pickled beets.  That being said, there are DEF better deli sandwiches in Brooklyn, and DEF better fried/soul food as well. (Theirs is tasteless and extra heavy on the batter.)They get three stars instead of one, b/c of the cool bar scene here at night, in which you must be dressed in something snazzy and over 55 years old to hang out w/ your Henny.PS Yes they also have cheesecake here, as well as a full bakery of other pasteries.  Who really has room for any of these after all the food they bring you ?!?",3.0
*amazing Cheesecake. *POOR customer service at the takeout section.*we were asking for recommendations and the lady gave us an attitude as if it was a real hassle.,3.0
Let me start by saying their Fried Chicken is THE BOMB!!! OMG!!!! I LOVE THEM!!! They give you MONSTER pieces and it's just so HEAVENLY!!! The mash potatoes are great their gravy is so delicious and the collard greens are the best I ever had!! Hands down they rock!!! Their Salads are on the money! Fresh and tasty sauces. :) Oh yeah!I love their corn bread!! So GOOD!!! I tasted their Corn bread topped baked Salmon and OMG that is just too awesome along with their Catfish! WOW!!Just recently my mate and I had amazing service with a wonderful and most professional waiter his name is Zaman. If you want the most friendliest and amazingly detailed service you have to seek this guy out. He is top notch AWESOME! We now will always seek him out. He certainly makes your stay enjoyable. You will come out a happy camper. This guy actually cares about his customers. We had a great table and just sat in a great atmosphere. The manager was delightful. What a great place!! The Cheesecake to DIE FOR!!! PERIOD!! Hands down AWESOME!!! Check this place out! It is the go to for AWESOME SOUL FOOD & KICK ASS CHEESECAKE!!!! :),5.0
"OH MY JESUS CHRIST SUPER STAR!  MOUTH 'GASM ALL OVER THE PLACE! Pardon that sudden burst of excitement. One, if not, the best cheesecake in the NY area. As an avid baker, I can tell you that this cheesecake is simply dee to the freaking vine! DIVINE! I could seriously eat the whole thing by myself, and I have.Now I have only 1 qualm. Do not go to any other Junior's besides the one at DeKalb Ave. It is not the same, the one at DeKalb is the original. Totally worth taking the Q/B/R to Dekalb. It might be a little scary, especially since the area is sketchy, but worth the risk! **Now, Junior's has other foods, but I would not recommend the actual diner. One goes to Junior's for the cheesecake (I love the raspberry swirl cheesecake), the chocolate mousse cake, and the red velvet cake, that's it.",5.0
"This place was so good we came here 3 times in 5 days. I'm not kidding. 3 times. We always had a cup of coffee to warm up, and shared one variety of their world famous cheesecake for desert.The first night we tried the Chocolate Mousse cheesecake. This thing was huge! There was a layer of moose at least 2 inches thick, and a layer of cheesecake about the same. It was very good, but also very rich. I'd rank it as my third favorite.The second night we tried the raspberry swirl cheesecake. This was not quite as big, but still large for a slice of cheesecake and plenty for us to share for desert. It was superb and I'd highly recommend. Our third and final night, we tried the carrot cake cheesecake. We'd seen it in the window of the bakery the night before and couldn't help ourselves. This was the most amazing piece of cake I've ever had! It was also humongous. The cheesecake layer was at least 2 inches thick, and then carrot cake and frosting layers were another 4 inches, plus the creamy topping. I'd definitely get this one again!We sat at the bar all three nights and had the same server, who was nice, talkative, and remembered us each time which was nice. The one we didn't get to try was the blueberry cheesecake, which looked amazing. I guess that will have to wait for next time!",5.0

"O-M-G! its like heaven! we went there for the first time and didn't know what to expect. the place was cute, it has that soda-shop feel to it. since it was or first time, and we had heard how great their cheesecakes were, everyone in our party order their on slice. we ordered a variety of their desserts becuz we wanted to try it all. and boy, did we try it all! we had german choco cake, strawberry shortcake, chocolate and regular cheesecake! we didn't realize the slices were so big! we probably could have shared just 2 slices between the five of us since we had just gotten done with dinner prior to going there. but i'm certainly not complaining becuz every bite of all the cakes were like heaven. if i remember correctly, each slice were approx $6-7.00 which is totally worth it!i know there are multiple locations in NY, but if you can, go to this one for the authentic experience!",5.0

Also, the apples are lined at the bottom of the cheesecake also adding sweet cinnamon apple flavor to the plain cheesecake. Yum~I definitely advise you to check out Junior's cheesecake.

"This Brooklyn institution is the ultimate cheesecake mother lode, not the kind of cheesecake that comes out of a ""factory,"" if you know what I mean (I'm teasing, of course, I like the cheesecake there too).   My suggestion is to look past the fancier cheesecake creations and stick with the basic cheesecake.  You wont be sorry.  The cheesecake is, as they say, most fabulous...perfectly creamy, not too sweet, light but flavorful, and firm (and it wont fall apart on you).  It magically melts in your mouth.  Very very good stuff.  The food itself is fairly standard (the fries were bad) and the Dodger decor all over the place is just downright annoying (Giants fan here, can you tell?).  Finally, excellent service.  We arrived just 30 minutes before closing and we were not rushed, servers are friendly but not overbearing, attentive, helpful.  I'm always wary of ""institutions,"" out of concern that they may be overrated.  IMHO, Junior's immense popularity is well-deserved, at least for its cheesecake.",4.0

"I am the king of cheesecakes and sweets and absolutely love them. I have tried this place multiple times, trying to give it credit for all the hype that it gets. I've tried the strawberry cheesecake and their New York cheesecake multiple times. I must say I'm not that impressed. I've definitely had better.

It's definitely a famous establishment in New York though, so I say go ahead and try it once, see how you like it.",3.0
"What can I say? Still luvin' this place even after 5 years. Why did I stay away so long?!My friend and I used to take the train from Manhattan at midnight during the weekdays to eat their apple crumb cheesecake, plain cheesecake, carrot cake cheese cake and strawberry cheesecake.I am ashamed to say that as I grow older, I grew tire of the journey to and from Brooklyn and the number of trips dwindled in number and soon, an entire year had passed since I haven't had Junior's cheesecake. What was I thinking?!I went back this past weekend and got their apple crumb cheesecake to go. I took a bite and all the great memories came back. Their apple crumb cheesecake hasn't changed! (If you haven't noticed by now, that is my personal favorite.) The crumble on the top gives crunchy contrast to the creamy, smooth texture of the cheesecake that melts in your mouth. Also, the apples are lined at the bottom of the cheesecake also adding sweet cinnamon apple flavor to the plain cheesecake. Yum~I definitely advise you to check out Junior's cheesecake. However, DO NOT eat their regular MEAL/ FOOD. it's TERRIBLE! JUST GET THE CHEESECAKE!! It is called Junior's cheesecake, GET THE CHEESECAKE!!! Especially the apple crumb cheesecake!",5.0
"This Brooklyn institution is the ultimate cheesecake mother lode, not the kind of cheesecake that comes out of a ""factory,"" if you know what I mean (I'm teasing, of course, I like the cheesecake there too).   My suggestion is to look past the fancier cheesecake creations and stick with the basic cheesecake.  You wont be sorry.  The cheesecake is, as they say, most fabulous...perfectly creamy, not too sweet, light but flavorful, and firm (and it wont fall apart on you).  It magically melts in your mouth.  Very very good stuff.  The food itself is fairly standard (the fries were bad) and the Dodger decor all over the place is just downright annoying (Giants fan here, can you tell?).  Finally, excellent service.  We arrived just 30 minutes before closing and we were not rushed, servers are friendly but not overbearing, attentive, helpful.  I'm always wary of ""institutions,"" out of concern that they may be overrated.  IMHO, Junior's immense popularity is well-deserved, at least for its cheesecake.",4.0

I ordered a strawberry cheese cake on line for $54.00, was so excited but when I opened the box the pie was completely frozen. So I waited a few hours for it to thaw out, I then took a bite and it tasted like 6 month old FREEZER BURN cheesecake that was not freshly made. The gram cracker crust was soggy and the strawberry topping tasted like frozen jelly.  I was born and raised in NY, now live in DC had a taste for it, but now, Ill just wait when I go back to NY and get it there. Luckily, customer service was nice enough to give my money back along with S&H!!! SO moral of this story...GO TO THE ACTUAL BAKERY IN NYC, you will love it while its fresh.",1.0

"Junior's is a place I frequented while attending LIU. The restaurant itself is pretty big; it has 2 levels, with clean bathrooms on the upper level. They have a counter in the front for take-out and cheesecake orders. Junior's is good if you know what to expect. The times that I've eaten there, I've had to wait at least 5-10 minutes to be seated, even when the restaurant is not crowded. The servers are not particularly friendly, but, again, I know to expect this. I've ordered a little bit of everything off their menu. I've had griddle cakes, burgers, potato pancakes, steak burgers, and a bunch of other entrees I can't remember. Their food is usually greasy, but if you know to expect this, you won't be disappointed. Their beer-battered onion rings are greasy, but wonderfully disgusting.Now, the cheesecake is hit or miss. I have had their cheesecake on many occasions, tried a bunch of different flavors, and it is inconsistent. On some occasions, it's been creamy and wonderful, and on other occasions, it's been less than desirable. (Plus, who can forget the photo of the impostor rat in the window of Junior's, amidst said cheesecakes?)

"Do you swear to order the cheesecake, the whole cheesecake, and nothing but the cheesecake?I do.Junior's is a Brooklyn icon. If you like a nice, dense, intensely flavored cheesecake, look no further than the bakery counter at Junior's.

The food here is standard--not great, not terrible, just average. That's okay though, because a slice of cheesecake is heavy enough to be a meal.My personal favorite is the chocolate mousse cheesecake.

What's not to love?  You can get a full, satisfying, balanced meal here, the type of meal that I still have yet to have at a diner anywhere in New York City.  The price seems expensive at first, but by the time they bring out the pickles and beets and cole slaw  that  reflect its old-school Jewish heritage plus the three types of bread (the cornbread is so good!) you realize that you have been given your solid money's worth.  I like the fact that they always have a wide range of vegetable selections for your sides, even if they do cook them in enough butter to negate their salubrious qualities... They season the vegetables well and render them tasty if not all that healthy.  James Beard's ol' fat bald ass would be proud!  I usually get the collard greens.The service can be best described by two words: ""on it"".  They must train their wait staff extremely well, because I have only had the best experience with every Junior's waiter, here or at the locations in the City... They are never obtrusive, they list your options very carefully, they listen very carefully to your selections and they work with you on your arcane tastes, i.e. your particularities about type of mustard or cole slaw, your desire for juice on your brisket, etc.  They then watch like a hawk to make sure your drinks are always full, whether it's your water or your fountain drink.  I hope Junior's pays them well...It's just a pleasant place to be.  They play a pretty good selection of oldies that is fairly Martha Reeves and the Vandellas-type R+B heavy, and I appreciate the fact that both the staff and the customers reflect the full range of Brooklynites...

"I wasn't expecting anything amazing from the food. I loathe their cheesecake (it feels like my arteries are clogging whenever I eat a slice) and their food tastes like mediocre diner food at best. But that's not why I'm complaining. My waiter was not only rude to my boyfriend for no reason, but he was extremely leery towards me. When we first ordered, the middle-aged water was really nice as he should've been. When I asked for an egg cream to go with my goulash, though, he gave me this creeper stare that lingered for a few seconds too long. He kept on doing that every time he came over to our table, so I had to stop looking up at him whenever he sporadically refilled our water. By the end of our mediocre meal, our waiter was MIA. When he eventually came back to take away our plates, he basically called my boy a sissy eater. Someone didn't want to earn good tips that night, it seemed.",1.0

"The food here is not a big deal. Honestly. The cheesecake is good but I wouldn't say the BEST on earth. I've had better slices at little bakeries in Queens. Nothing to walk across the bridge for (Diddy is just crazy!).The service here isn't all that great either. Pretty crowded every time I've been here and my waiters always seemed over whelmed to the point they couldn't be as lovely and pleasant as I wanted them to be.My mom LOVES the wings and I hate them, (well, hated when I was a meat eater). It's hard for me to come across a chicken wing I don't like. It's an acquired taste though. Not a BBQ but not a buffalo. Something weird and I didn't like it. I suppose it's hit or miss though. You either love it or hate it. Honestly, after that little rodent scandal in the paper with the photo of the little guy hanging out by the cheesecake, I just got completely turned off to the whole place. I'm sure that was just some disgruntled  fired employee (from what I heard) but still. Once that image was in my head I realized I def wouldn't be able to come in here and sit and have a meal. ( I am deathly terrified of mice.)Anyways, nothing special. The cheesecake is cool but cheesecake is kind of hard to mess up. It's cold cheese. Put a strawberry on top and shove it in a box.

I do not care if you are local or just visiting. No one tops the texture and flavor of the various cheesecakes that Junior's makes.

"This is a place known for it's cheesecake but it's actually a diner styled restaurant/bar with a full menu and tons of seats. I'll give 5 stars for desserts, 3 stars for the service and food. 95% of the people who work here are Indian (I'm not saying there's anything wrong with that but it's very unexpected especially for the area). The service is generally no so attentive and never noticeably friendly and the food is pretty mediocre (I would advice against anything fried unless you love tons of greasy batter). The one good thing is that if you do come here for a meal you get free cornbread which might not be authentic but it's certainly addictive. Many call this place the originator and the king of cheesecake, the place that makes NY famous for the cheesecake. I can't say I've had better cheesecake, the consistency and taste is perfect. The only thing I'm on the fence about is that the bottom is not the graham cracker crust you might expect but a thin slightly soggy sponge cake. I'm not a big fan of this but I realize that it helps the smooth consistency of the cheesecake stand out without screwing that up with you having to chomp down on some thick crust. If you go during the fall they have their seasonal pumpkin cheesecake, if you like pumpkin you will love this. They have a huge list of desserts that are half cheesecake-half cake in one slice which is cool and they also have a huge selection of desserts that aren't cheesecake if that's not your thing. But going to Juniors and not getting some sort of cheesecake is like going to Nathans in Coney Island and not getting a hot dog. This isn't the best area of Brooklyn so I wouldn't stroll around and explore the area but it's fairly easy to get to via car or extremely easy via subway (it's directly across the street from the DeKalb Ave B/M/Q/R stop)",4.0
"I'm not that impressed.   But then again I'm not a fan of having a pound of lunch meat in my sandwiches.  The food is OK.  Well then again, my friend's onion rings was a pound of batter and an ounce of onion.  He enjoyed his pastrami so that's a good choice.  I wasn't impressed by my roast beef ruben.  I didn't have the cheesecake that night but I've had Junior's cheesecake from the Grand Central location and it's a good cheesecake but I'm not that into cheesecake so I couldn't tell you if it's the best.",2.0

"I wasn't expecting anything amazing from the food. I loathe their cheesecake (it feels like my arteries are clogging whenever I eat a slice) and their food tastes like mediocre diner food at best. But that's not why I'm complaining. My waiter was not only rude to my boyfriend for no reason, but he was extremely leery towards me. When we first ordered, the middle-aged water was really nice as he should've been. When I asked for an egg cream to go with my goulash, though, he gave me this creeper stare that lingered for a few seconds too long. He kept on doing that every time he came over to our table, so I had to stop looking up at him whenever he sporadically refilled our water. By the end of our mediocre meal, our waiter was MIA. When he eventually came back to take away our plates, he basically called my boy a sissy eater. Someone didn't want to earn good tips that night, it seemed.",1.0
"After walking the brooklyn bridge, me and my out of town guests were craving for something but our late lunch doesn't warrant for another full dinner.  Hence Junior's.I was impressed by the look inside considering they don't have much curb appeal.It has diner like setting and the room was hardly half full at around 8pm.Stick with the original cheesecake to experience their best assets.Glad that I can say that I've been to one of Brooklyn's landmark but next time I am craving for cheesecake, think i'll stop by Grand Central instead.Note that they have a $5 minimum per person.",3.0
"The food here is not a big deal. Honestly. The cheesecake is good but I wouldn't say the BEST on earth. I've had better slices at little bakeries in Queens. Nothing to walk across the bridge for (Diddy is just crazy!).The service here isn't all that great either. Pretty crowded every time I've been here and my waiters always seemed over whelmed to the point they couldn't be as lovely and pleasant as I wanted them to be.My mom LOVES the wings and I hate them, (well, hated when I was a meat eater). It's hard for me to come across a chicken wing I don't like. It's an acquired taste though. Not a BBQ but not a buffalo. Something weird and I didn't like it. I suppose it's hit or miss though. You either love it or hate it. Honestly, after that little rodent scandal in the paper with the photo of the little guy hanging out by the cheesecake, I just got completely turned off to the whole place. I'm sure that was just some disgruntled  fired employee (from what I heard) but still. Once that image was in my head I realized I def wouldn't be able to come in here and sit and have a meal. ( I am deathly terrified of mice.)Anyways, nothing special. The cheesecake is cool but cheesecake is kind of hard to mess up. It's cold cheese. Put a strawberry on top and shove it in a box. Done.I won't suggest that you don't come here. I just don't go because of the crowd, the inattentive wait staff, and the mickey mouse pic. Feel free to try it out for yourself. You may love it.",2.0
"I've eaten at Juniors a few times and the fact that I never got around to reviewing it until today speaks for itself. The food is good, not great. The portions are huge and the trick to making the meal affordable is to split a salad or other entree with someone.  I have had the cheesecake which is good but a bit overrated and last night we had the ice cream sundae which was also good but not outstanding.  Our waiter while having to be reminded to bring a serving spoon, was very nice though he might have stopped by a little more often.Right now you can get in on a weekday night for dinner without too much of a problem but I wonder once the new arena opens how crowded it will be!",3.0

"Excellent diner in Brooklyn famous for its many, many types of delectable cheesecakes.  You will not be disappointed in their desserts.  The main entrance leads you right through the bakery counters to prepare you for what is to come.Menu is intimidatingly large.  Page after page of cuisines and types of food.  It is more diner / comfort food focused.  If you cannot find something you like, it's more because you will be overwhelmed with choices.Prices are a bit steep but portions are very large.  Good luck trying to save room for dessert.  Be prepared to request a to-go container.  Full bar adds to the fun of the experience.Service is just OK.  Friendly, but not the most knowledgable or efficient servers in my experience.Large restaurant overall with many seating areas.  Mostly a kitcshy, diner theme.  Walls are lined with famous, autographed headshots from over the years.  Overall a very fun, appetizing place for a meal and/or dessert.  Highly recommended, especially for tourists.",4.0
"Known for their cheesecake which I had planned to have for dessert; however, I could not eat anything else after consuming the copious amounts of food we were served. Hot buttery cornbread & rolls, pickles, beets & cole slaw were served as a starter. I finished with the delicious pulled pork sandwich that I am quite certain is the best that I've ever had in life. Couldn't bear to leave any on my plate. Going back for the cheesecake the next time I am in NY.",5.0
Just cant go wrong with a place that sells burgers n cheesecake,4.0
This is one of my Fav placed to dine. Although their lunch specials and dinner options are quite tasty... I really enjoy their breakfast menu. The coffee is always fresh and the best corn beef I've ever tasted. (And I'm not even a fan of corn beef lol!). The cheesecake is absolutely no ridiculous! No cheesecake could hold a candle to a Junior's Cheesecake! And I highly recommend the Raspberry Swirl! #CompleteDeliciousness,5.0

Yummmmm Strawberry cheesecake..............sorry I got lost for a sec. So I ate dinner here and was surprised about the the famous juniors restaurant . But not in the good way. There's no doubt that their cheesecake is amazing(I haven't tried all the flavors but that's my 2013 resolution) but everything else on the menu.....straight diner food.

Cons: -The burgers are HUGE and kinda dry.            -I didn't really like the catfish fingers.Pros: FRENCH. TOAST. Their French Toast is almost like dessert. It's slightly crunchy, it's buttery, ridiculously unhealthy.... *drool*. It comes with this apple...thing to put on top.      -This is one of the few places  where I actually like the scrambled eggs. They're simple, and not ridiculously creamy like other places.     -Their home fries are to die for, but beware, they don't have them after a certain time (they serve breakfast all day though). Their turkey sausage is actually well-spiced.     -Their chicken fingers are wonderful. They're white meat, but extremely juicy (not easy to achieve). Their drinks are great too. They have old-fashioned cocktails and a few new ones, too. Overall, this is a very family-friendly type place. It's not the trendiest spot, but they really make you feel at home.The one in Times Square is an abomination and doesn't even begin to compare to this one in terms of service, and they don't even serve breakfast all day.

"Not sure why this place is serving food. The specialty here is nothing other than the cheesecake. The infamous Diddy-ordered cheesecake is alive and well. It's a spectacular dessert here.

I had a corned beef and pastrami combo that was quite good like sliders not huge for $17 but good and leaves room for overpriced new York cheesecake,4.0
"OK, here's the controversy, I've never REALLY eaten at Junior's. Everytime I go to NY no matter who I visit, or for whatever reason I happen to be there, I only end up at Junior's for a few moments to order the take out cheesecake. No matter how adamant I am about going to Junior's to eat I always end up just ordering a slice of cheesecake to go.I've been told that the food at Junior's isn't that great, and it's as if native New Yorkers are a too ashamed to let the food represent their city. So therefore I can only comment on the cheesecake. My rating has nothing to do with service, ambience, food, nothing except cheesecake. Truily for all I know they may have the greatest food in the world at Junior's but due to now what I think to be a New York conspiracy to keep me from sampling Junior's food, I don't know.Now the cheesecake is alright, it's not life changing like some people would have you believe. I defiantely wouldn't order one online and have it shipped to me, that's taking it to the extremes, I would just make one first, or go to the cheesecake factory, or even Safeways and pick up a fresh one. That being said they are good enough to warrant a trip to Junior's everytime I go to New York, but even then I wouldn't go to far out of my way to get a one, not like I would walk from Manhattan to Brooklyn for a slice (hell naw) (Puffy was a fool for that one, LOL). While I'm now the subject of Junior's cheesecake I must also admit I only order the original plain cheesecake when I go. Once I ordered their strawberry cheesecake and didn't open it until I got home and noticed that the strawberries where so over ripe that they were just hours away from being rotten and they tried to hide the fact by covering the cheesecake with this thick a-- strawberry syrup. Had I rented a car, I would had driven all the way back to Junior's and made the Chef, owner, manager, somebody explain this BS to me.So therefore, I'm only going to judge their original cheesecake and I give it 3 stars, but I'ma take a star because it's overpriced and I'ma take away my New York curve (because all the food in NY is over-rated curve so I give them an extra star so that it doesn't seem like I'm being overly critical in comparision to other reviewers) because they tried to play me with the strawberries.",2.0

"For some reason, I really don't like eating here.  The place is nice looking and kept pretty clean.  Also the servers are super friendly.  However, I think their prices have become a little unreasonable for average tasting diner food.  Also the portions have been reduced over the past couple of years.  Their famous cheesecake does not taste any different than David's frozen cheesecake that you can buy in a supermarket.  If you want a cheesecake that is light & airy and has no preservatives, then go someplace else other than Junior's.",3.0
"I was told that this is the place that p-diddy made his ""making the band"" members get him cheesecake. This place was huge! We ordered the strawberry cheesecake cake. Pretty darn good. The waiter recommended a Mudslide drink to go with the cake. I was a little nervous to pair them together,but it was ok. I think the waiters should know more about their liquor and food.",4.0
"Not sure why this place is serving food. The specialty here is nothing other than the cheesecake. The infamous Diddy-ordered cheesecake is alive and well. It's a spectacular dessert here. The HUGE slice is the hallmark. I had the strawberry, which seemed to have just a little too much of the syrupy gunk on it. Remove that, and the cheesecake is just fine. Delish as usual.",3.0
I had a corned beef and pastrami combo that was quite good like sliders not huge for $17 but good and leaves room for overpriced new York cheesecake,4.0
"OK, here's the controversy, I've never REALLY eaten at Junior's. Everytime I go to NY no matter who I visit, or for whatever reason I happen to be there, I only end up at Junior's for a few moments to order the take out cheesecake. No matter how adamant I am about going to Junior's to eat I always end up just ordering a slice of cheesecake to go.I've been told that the food at Junior's isn't that great, and it's as if native New Yorkers are a too ashamed to let the food represent their city. So therefore I can only comment on the cheesecake. My rating has nothing to do with service, ambience, food, nothing except cheesecake. Truily for all I know they may have the greatest food in the world at Junior's but due to now what I think to be a New York conspiracy to keep me from sampling Junior's food, I don't know.Now the cheesecake is alright, it's not life changing like some people would have you believe. I defiantely wouldn't order one online and have it shipped to me, that's taking it to the extremes, I would just make one first, or go to the cheesecake factory, or even Safeways and pick up a fresh one. That being said they are good enough to warrant a trip to Junior's everytime I go to New York, but even then I wouldn't go to far out of my way to get a one, not like I would walk from Manhattan to Brooklyn for a slice (hell naw) (Puffy was a fool for that one, LOL). While I'm now the subject of Junior's cheesecake I must also admit I only order the original plain cheesecake when I go. Once I ordered their strawberry cheesecake and didn't open it until I got home and noticed that the strawberries where so over ripe that they were just hours away from being rotten and they tried to hide the fact by covering the cheesecake with this thick a-- strawberry syrup. Had I rented a car, I would had driven all the way back to Junior's and made the Chef, owner, manager, somebody explain this BS to me.So therefore, I'm only going to judge their original cheesecake and I give it 3 stars, but I'ma take a star because it's overpriced and I'ma take away my New York curve (because all the food in NY is over-rated curve so I give them an extra star so that it doesn't seem like I'm being overly critical in comparision to other reviewers) because they tried to play me with the strawberries.",2.0
Went here only for the cheesecake and got it to go...so I can only comment on that.  I got the carrot cake cheesecake. Delicious!!!! I can see why diddy made the band walk to Brooklyn for it.,5.0
"best cheese cake in the entire usa"" so great !! your mouth keeps  watering after you get done with a slice,and the food is awesome""",5.0
"Forget the cheesecake, which is delicious, how about their breakfasts?  Reasonably priced entrees come with a nice pastry platter, coffee AND juice.  It's a great place for large groups and they're always extremely friendly.  If you can't make up your mind, or are with a group that includes children, definitely check this place out for breakfast!",4.0

They were both friggin' amazing... I ended up ordering another slice, and I went for the strawberry shortcake cheesecake, which was good, but not as good as the other two. Next time I'll definitely try the chocolate mousse cheesecake, and maybe a strawberry cheesecake. Anyway at Christmas I tried S&S cheesecake, and it was good, but not as good as Junior's...

"It was my birthday. Hubby and I were visiting NYC. That day, we crossed the Brooklyn Bridge, and went to Grimaldi's for lunch. I texted my brother (who lives in NY) that we are at this awesome pizzaria, and he texted me back, go get a cheesecake at Junior's. So.. I looked up the reviews. I couldn't resist. If I had one piece of birthday cake, it had to be this one.So we took the bus from Grimaldi's. Walked into this really classic looking cafe/restaurant. So classic. Jazz music flowing around everywhere (my favorite music in this world!). It was so charming. I cannot remember the last time I went to a place that had those small classic coffee cup/saucer combo. So adorable!We got an original and a red velvet. We asked them if they had a candle, and the server went, why didn't u tell us earlier!! Then he fetched a lady, and they sang happy birthday for me. And then the cheesecake,... The original was out of this world. So good. I agree that the soft bottom is better than the crunch crust that you'll find with other cheeesecakes. And the red velvet was awesome too, with that awesome cheese cream goodness between layers. Aah, so heavenly. Wish there were more words to describe the awesomeness of the cake.Yes.

"This place is a neighborhood favorite (and one I'd travel to even if I didn't live down the street).

"Went to Juniors with a referral from my friend who was raised in Brooklyn and lived there for many years. We just so happened to be traveling through the area and needed to get something to eat before hitting that crazy NYC rush hour traffic. I was impressed when they came out with a bowl of Pickled Beets, Pickles and Coleslaw as a complementary appetizer. The coleslaw was good, vinegar based and the pickles were crunchy. The beets were good as well. I ordered the Swiss Steak Burger which came with a slice of lettuce, tomato, swiss cheese and mushrooms on top. Served with two large onion rings which I wasn't too impressed with as they had that faint hint of fish from the fryer in them but oddly enough, the fried it came with didn't taste like that at all. They just needed salt. The burger was good, not overly great but tasty enough and went well with a Guiness Extra Stout. The roll was fresh and the burger itself was very juicy so the cook did a nice job with the cooking time. The staff were friendly and quick to refill the water at the table and clear the plates. Didn't try the cheesecake because it was already too much food to eat. The total for our order or two Guiness, my Swiss Steak Burger with fries and my friends Cheese Burger with Fries came to just over $51.00 which included gratuity. If you aren't from the city, be prepared for this little piece of culture shock. Yes, things really do cost more in the city. The same meal for me back home in a local diner wouldn't have cost half as much as that. Oh well. It was still nice to have experienced another unique piece of NYC and it was cool to hang out with a friend who grew up there and hear him tell some pretty cool stories about Juniors from when he was a kid. Would I go back? Of course, I still have to try the cheesecake!! Lol",4.0

"We went to Junior's because it's a Brooklyn classic, and my cheesecake-loving friend wanted to visit it before she went to Texas.  We were seated immediately, and I asked for a drink menu while my companion went to the restroom.  When the waitress came back to take my drink order (I had to catch her eye, since she was busy chatting with a few other waiters, and then wait for her to set up another table before she came over) I asked what frozen cocktails they had; she listed three, including one I hadn't seen on the menu.  I asked what was in it, and she replied, ""Oh, I don't actually know.  Rum, I guess.  They all have rum in them.""  A glowing recommendation like that, how could I pass?  The drink was good; it tasted like a piña colada, except that it was blue.  My companion came back as my drink order was being taken, and when she declined, the waitress kept asking if she was sure, until my companion said she wasn't interested in drinking. The menu was kind of limited; if you don't eat meat or seafood, there's only about 5 different things to order--and if you're vegetarian, I really hope you like cheesecake. When the waitress came back to take our meal order, my friend asked how the turkey sandwiches were, and the waitress said she didn't really know, that she didn't like turkey.  My friend asked about the burgers, and the waitress said, ""They're okay.""  I asked her what she DID recommend, and she said, ""The dinners.""  My friend said that she wasn't interested in a dinner because she didn't want a big meal, and the waitress just kept recommending the dinners, (""Oh, we have a turkey dinner, you know."")  My friend ordered a burger with grilled onions; her burger came with no onions on it, but onion rings on the side.  I got the southern fried chicken, which came dripping in grease.  It was delicious, but after about 20 minutes, the bottom was totally soggy from the grease dripping down.  The portions were very generous, but when we asked to take them home, the waitress came over with two boxes, took a fork and plunked my leftover chicken in it, and then put the fork into the plate of ketchup.  After I wiped the fork off to place the mashed potatoes on them, the waitress kept putting things on the plate I was still using, clearly ready for us to go.  She got a strawberry cheesecake which she said was delicious; I passed, since a 20% included gratuity  on a cheesecake I'm taking to go isn't really my speed. If the restaurant had been crowded or we'd been lingering, this would've been a little more acceptable, but it wound up just leaving the worst taste ever in my mouth.  For $30 a person, I can get a lot of fried chicken, and a lot of mysterious blue drinks.  I'll skip Juniors and go to one of my other Brooklyn favorites.",1.0

"1 star for lunch we had at Junior's restaurant. I ordered the special of the day - chicken pot pie. When it first came out, I was delighted by the well baked fluffy layered crust. Am I going to be eating some freshly made chicken pot pie?As I dived into the filling of vegetables and chicken chunks, I was disappointed. It was medium warm at best, the vegetables lacked the fresh ingredients texture (most likely frozen portions, and reheated to order).

The price of the main was high enough for what it was, but that's New York prices for you (even in Brooklyn).The review almost lost a star due to the conduct of my server when it came to settling up. While she was polite, swift and capable, she suddenly became VERY attentive to my table both as I prepared to pay and after she brought me my change. She was obviously angling for a tip at that point. It was really quite awkward. Given the fact that she'd done a good job, I was of course going to leave her the standard 15%. Perhaps I looked like a cheapskate and, as a European, I have to say I find the American expectation of a gratuity as a matter of course to be rather strange. That said, when in Rome...",4.0
"I did not eat here, but my girlfriend and her friend did - and then brought me home something - I will relay their experience and my own.Typical diner fare - burgers, sandwiches, breakfast items, etc. Portions are quite large. It was described to me that as dishes came out, unsuspecting women had saucer eyes as foods approached the table. They also had drinks - an apple martini that was pretty much a martini with apple scent, and a tequila sunrise, which was orange flavored tequila. At least you get your money's worth.They brought me home a Reuben with corned beef and pastrami. Very delicious, even cold.

That said they should come on down off that high horse for a second and have some chicken and ribs, it's pretty amazing here and for the money it's the best bang for your buck in downtown brooklyn. Everything from steaks to fajitas its all standard and all delicious. Nothing fancy just good portions in a nice throwback atmosphere. One thing everyone should try once in their life is the sandwich on the menu called ""something different"". Moist Brisket on a bun made of fat potato pancakes topped with the juices from the brisket. It is one of my favorite things in the world.

"Okay, so let me start off by saying that if this was a cheesecake-only establishment, that I would have to give it 5 stars without another thought. The fact is though that it also claims itself as a deli, and while it has a lot of clout and the food is decent, it's not legendary - especially not for a deli in NY.The pastrami is thick and flavorful, the cheese steak however is underwhelming. Not bad, but nothing spectacular. I would still go here though, the food is reasonable and not obnoxiously over-priced. If you're only stopping by though, do yourself a favor and go try a cheesecake. My personal favorite is the blueberry, but you can't go wrong with strawberry or traditional either.I think there's another one near times square too, so if you don't find yourself Brooklyn side, you can still get a taste over there. I actually thought the food was better in the one in Manhattan, so maybe that's a better bet for quick bite to eat.",4.0

Final evaluation: good cheesecake, nut definitely not the best I've ever had. I think Cheesecake Factory's cheesecake MAY be better, for a mass-produced cheesecake.",4.0
"Cool- I get to be review 201! Yes, they make a very nice cheesecake. It's a taste of old school NY and you gotta make it here for Breakfast someone needs to explain to me how they get their omelets so fluffy.",4.0

"A lot of people act strange when I ask them if they have ever eaten at Juniors. They give me this weird look that say's ""Ive eaten the cheesecake there but aaaaa nothing else..."" That was all in that long drawn out cali speak that has so effectively gravitated to this great city. That said they should come on down off that high horse for a second and have some chicken and ribs, it's pretty amazing here and for the money it's the best bang for your buck in downtown brooklyn. Everything from steaks to fajitas its all standard and all delicious. Nothing fancy just good portions in a nice throwback atmosphere. One thing everyone should try once in their life is the sandwich on the menu called ""something different"". Moist Brisket on a bun made of fat potato pancakes topped with the juices from the brisket. It is one of my favorite things in the world. Worth a try, nothing fancy but a classic standby thats worth more than just the cheesecake.",4.0
"i have mixed feelings about this place. the location is nice. very bright. very well light. yeah there are a lot of lights here. its kinda bright. i wonder how much is their electricity bill a month.i had a burger, good burger, juicy, but i dont know. the fries werent my favorite. i guess this place is ok for the amusement. the lights.",3.0
"Okay, so let me start off by saying that if this was a cheesecake-only establishment, that I would have to give it 5 stars without another thought. The fact is though that it also claims itself as a deli, and while it has a lot of clout and the food is decent, it's not legendary - especially not for a deli in NY.The pastrami is thick and flavorful, the cheese steak however is underwhelming. Not bad, but nothing spectacular. I would still go here though, the food is reasonable and not obnoxiously over-priced. If you're only stopping by though, do yourself a favor and go try a cheesecake. My personal favorite is the blueberry, but you can't go wrong with strawberry or traditional either.I think there's another one near times square too, so if you don't find yourself Brooklyn side, you can still get a taste over there. I actually thought the food was better in the one in Manhattan, so maybe that's a better bet for quick bite to eat.",4.0
"i was really happy with Junior's. It's a very tourist driven place, but accordingly they were moving people in and out with lightening speed. We got out of an amazing production of the Lion King and happened upon Junior's on a fluke.The servings are MASSIVE so I would suggest splitting a dish. We shared a bbq chicken salad and a slice of blueberry cheesecake. The food was really good/fresh, and the service was speedy and efficient. When the weather is nice Junior's is the place to dine outdoors and people watch. Luckily I was there for 85 degree weather and an early dinner so with the sun shining bright and drinks in hand nothing could be more perfect.",5.0

"I just don't see why this place got so many positive reviews. I find the food to be nothing special at all. The cheesecake is ok (3 stars for that), but the food itself is gross. I ordered buffalo shrimp as an appetizer; it was so gross that I told the waiter not to bring my meal. It literally tasted like shit. I'm pretty sure the shrimp was rotten. My bf got a hamburger and I quote his opinion: "" The burger tasted like it was infused with gas from a stove"". After his nasty burger and my rotten shrimp we decided to split some calamari because he was still hungry, and we were taking a cheesecake to go. We got calamari-- how could u mess that up. The calamari was just full of grease, and the marinara sauce was nothing special at all. Take it from someone who LOVES to eat, this place is all hype because of the name and the cheesecake. There are soo many other spots you can go to get much better desserts and meals. As far as Junior's cheesecake I've only had the strawberry one. The strawberries they put on top are in this jelly-like sweet stuff that ruins the whole taste if you don't wipe it off. There is no graham cracker crust which kind of pisses me off, but hey that's the way they make it. I honestly don't see how so many people rave about Juniors cheesecake and/or the restaurant.",1.0

"Junior's reminds me of my childhood.I still vividly remember spending Sunday mornings there, with my family.

And while you can indeed find a hearty, satisfying breakfast in a great many places, you won't find the unchanging ambiance that Junior's provides.

I love Junior's, I often come here sometime after work - they are open till about 1 or 2am - even on weekdays! I have to tell you - there is always DRAMA every time I come here - one time a patron said that the bartender stole his watch - apparently he took it off and left it at the bar and the bartender put it on - DRAMA (funny as hell) Another time someone had ""forgotten"" to pay the bill - fight outside NYPD and all. I love NYC and I love Brooklyn - please out of towners don't be alarmed - its NYC baby!!! The staff is super super friendly and courteous, its almost like they have this pride about working at Junior's almost iconic! Shout out to my FAV waiter Glenroy - this man must work a lot because he is ALWAYS there when I come to visit!!! He always hooks me up with extra pickles so that I can take them home (the pickles that they serve as an appetizer are the BOMB) Now to the drinks - I recommend the Strawberry Bellini - I think its the same strawberry sauce they use for the cheesecakes and sparkling wine - its fun sweet and bubbly and everyone looks while you drink it!!! The food - OK I am a little biased here because I tend to order the same thing - but I have had several things on the menu - which have all been really good! I love the fried chicken with 2 sides I really don't eat the sides I usually have it with the cornbread that they give as an appetizer. So yeah - its 1/2 of a chicken cut up and fried to perfection - always served PIPING HOT!!! Definitely enough for 2!!! Desserts - now you all know that Junior's ships all it's stuff all over the world - but you have to be in the restaurant to enjoy the full experience!!

And $4-5 a piece is worth bc you can not finish all at once and it will stay in your refrige for a week. So it pays off. God bless you if you are buying the whole cake to finish. Dining experience - 3 stars. Dining in there, foods are great but I wish they clean waiter's uniform more.

For $5.95 you get a huge slice of plain cheesecake. It is so creamy and has a delicious crust. Worth the price tag, as this is a staple of Brooklyn.This particular location is the original store, and has been around since 1950. The cheesecakes here are so good, that in 1983 when the place went on fire, people stood outside this blaze yelling ""save the cakes!""I also tried the German Layer cake, and it was also a mammoth slice. They charge $5.75 for this dessert, but it was so good that I gave half to my friend. It is chocolate cake layered with a filling of walnuts and coconut. The icing is great too.

I have to say though that the service was exceptional VERY exceptional despite of what you hear about NYC.

"BEST STRAWBERRY SHORT/CHEESECAKE!. How do you keep outdoing yourself? It's not as complex as Chikalicous', but the Strawberry Short/Cheesecake I had was CRACKTACULAR. It definitely tasted better than it looked. Upon first glance, I was asking myself how this could possibly taste good. The strawberry was fused into the cheesecake and the shortbread was on the side with the whipped cream on the perimeter of the slice. For $6.75, I thought this was going to be a definite fail. To my surprise, it was quite the contrary. This slice was nothing short of heaven. You HAVE to order this. Whomever thought of this genius combination should be given a medal.

"This place is known for its cheesecake! No matter what anyone tells you if your in Brooklyn looking for good Cheesecake this is the place to be. You can either have it take out or dinning in or you can even get it shipped. I found out about this place while in Miami when a friend of mine shipped a Multi-flavored Cheesecake down to me for Christmas. It is so rich you can only eat a slice, I haven't found anyone able to eat more than one slice at one time. When I went to the restaurant to have a cheesecake to go, they have about 30 different flavors to choose from (depending on the time of year).  They also serve lunch and dinner so if your looking to just relax its a perfect place to. If they could ship by slice I would get a slice mailed to me each week!",5.0

"I finally made it to Junior's...pretty embarassing as I am a life long ""Noo Yawka.""If there are 3 three things that Brooklyn has over the other other 4 boroughs its pizza, bagels and cheesecake!This cheesecake is damn good...and I have had some mind blowing slices in my lifetime. For $5.95 you get a huge slice of plain cheesecake. It is so creamy and has a delicious crust. Worth the price tag, as this is a staple of Brooklyn.This particular location is the original store, and has been around since 1950. The cheesecakes here are so good, that in 1983 when the place went on fire, people stood outside this blaze yelling ""save the cakes!""I also tried the German Layer cake, and it was also a mammoth slice. They charge $5.75 for this dessert, but it was so good that I gave half to my friend. It is chocolate cake layered with a filling of walnuts and coconut. The icing is great too. I have had better German Layer cakes, but again I was solely here for the cheesecake.I have not tried the restaurant, but anyplace that serves tongue on the menu must be good. Go here though for a slice of heaven, and worry about the calories and fat content later.",4.0
"I'll get right to the point......a 2 for the food, but a 5 for the cheesecake!!!!! Itt's delicious!!!! If you do eat here, get something safe, like a steakburger, or you'll be sorry!!!  Junior's has FAR too many things on its menu for any of them to be GOOD!But the cheesecake...... it's a SURE THING!!!!  Delicious every time! P.S-  Avoid the egg cream at all costs, and choose the Brooklyn location over the touristy Times Square one!!",2.0
"Tried the banana shake this time and it was pretty good, not too sweet. The chicken fingers were ok with a sauce that is an acquired taste. The mac n cheese tasted like mac n cheese you buy at the grocery store; nothing special. The original cheese cake tasted much better than the Rasberry Chocolate.",2.0
"There's only one reason to go here, as far as I'm concerned, and that's the cheesecake. Eat it there or get it to go, but don't waste time on the other stuff. Overpriced food in a mediocre atmosphere.",3.0
"I FINALLY made it to the infamous Junior's! After years and years and years and years and yeeeeaaarrss of hearing about this place I made it and all I have to say is it's just okay. Now I'm a sweet tooth junkie if there is anything I love it's definitely sweets! When I first walked it I was in heaven but after one bite I was quickly brought back down to earth. I had the carrot cake cheesecake and it tasted like regular carrot cake and the cheesecake was alright as well. Now the portion was HUGE but I didn't/couldn't it all of that. If you go on a date here, save yourself some money and unwanted calories and share with your date. I have to say though that the service was exceptional VERY exceptional despite of what you hear about NYC. If you've never been go and I'll probably go again to experience the other things that Junior's has to offer but I'll stick to the Cheesecake Factory for the best carrotcake cheesecake I've ever tasted.",3.0

"4 star because I have not tried their cheese cake yet. Im on that workout flow lol. Long story short about my experience.

Ordered anything on the menu and the food comes with extra things such as hot and tasty cornbread and regular bread. My friends and I ate them like it was the last supper haha.

"We visited the branch in Grand Central terminal in Manhattan for a cup of coffee, people-watching and a slice of New York cheesecake. All of these aims were definitely fulfilled - and more.

The elegant surroundings are echoed by the style of the cafe - although it's on the concourse it is marked out by a ramp up to the area and fenceposts around. Coffee was hot and fresh. We ordered the Cherry Cheesecake and Carrot Cake Cheesecake - just a slice of each. What arrived was more of a mountain. The carrot cake slice was about as big as my head, and therefore most of it had to leave in a box with us, but it was so fresh, tasty and indulgent and most quintessentially Brooklyn cheesecake. YUM.

Great food & great prices. It's always a nice experience. I would advise to avoid it on Sundays around the time church gets out. It's typically crowded. They have a lot of tables to keep up with the rush.,5.0
"I've been back to this place several times now, and I haven't been disappointed as yet.  Cheesecake was awesome (recommending Choc Mousse and Strawberry Shortcake versions).  The meals were really good and I'd recommend the southern fried chicken breast ... burgers ... mini brioche pastrami sandwiches.  The restaurant has flashback appeal to it which is aided by the pic of famous stars from years ago, and the great music they play from the Motown era.  For me, eating here was like eating at home ... and when you're on the road as much as I am that is a very good thing.",4.0
"Sure, after watching DIddy's orginal Making the Band, and seeing them travel across NYC to get Diddy some of this cheesecake, I had to try it out.Amazing cheesecake?  Yah, pretty much.But the thing that stays with me the most is how gross the actual food was.  Myself and a group of friends hit up this place, and we were absolutely disgusted by burgers & fries that we got here.I guess we shoulda just stuck to the program/plan!!Cheesecake was worth it though.",3.0

"I literally come to this location once a week. My grandmother loves the food here so I take it upon myself to bring her here all the time (hey, I live in her brownstone....in Carroll Gardens....FOR FREE! Juniors is the least I can do). I can only review their burgers because I never order anything else....FOR A REASON!!!! Juniors steakburgers are definitely one of the best meals of my life! The portion sizes are HUGE and the burger will definitely last you at least two meals. I always always always get the same exact thing when I get here, the steakburger with onion rings, mushrooms, and 2 bottles of ketchup. Yup! That's right, I finish a whole bottle of ketchup in one sitting, guess that just adds to my overall amazingness as well as Juniors' amazingness as they gladly supply me with two bottles each time. Now, when you receive your burger, let me tell you, you might literally feel your arteries clog up and your heart stop as if it were really happening (bring Bayer, you never know!). The size of the meat alone can stop a heart...and those onion rings! Oy vey! They are definitely the biggest onion rings I've ever had and they're so....fluffy! Ugh yummy! One great thing about this location is they serve you DELICIOUS cornbreak, cole slow, beats, pickles, and fresh buttered rolls while you wait for your meal. UNLIKE the location in Times Square who jack up their prices $5-$7 more for the same meals in Brooklyn AND they do NOT give you anything while you wait for your food! Wtf! If people pay more, shouldn't they at least get the same amount of food as they would in BK? TImes Square and ripping off tourists....and NYers who happen to want to have a touristy day...typical!!But, all that aside, who can forget the cheesecake!

I think not! Anyways, Juniors cleaned up the place and got it up and running again (don't worry, I didn't take my little old grandma to that place for 2 months until they got the exterminator in there!).

Definitely compares to Katz's. I mean, this was proooobably the best pastrami I've ever had. Granted, I don't claim to have tried all the pastramis in the land, but you cannot go wrong with this sandwich. My friend had the half roasted chicken, which came with rice, mashed potatoes, applesauce and a soda for $15. Not a bad deal seeing as that will make for at least 2 meals. And it was gooood.But what we've all come here for: the cheesecake. We got the original topped with strawberries. Amazing. I kind of wish we'd just gotten the original plain (or maybe the chocolate mousse) because the strawberries came with this kinda gross jelly and a bunch of the berries still had stems! But the cheesecake itself made up for all that. Thick, creamy, crumbly crust. And huge! Excellent splitting size. I don't even know how one person could down a whole thing.

The crust was some thin layer of flavorless dry cake, it was disgusting...chesecake is not complete without a good crust so this place failed. The actual cheesecake was ok...not as smooth as I like it...I have definitley had better in the city. Also didnt like the lack of good flavors, like I wanted the strawberry but it had a pie crust so was more like strawberry pie...Second the food was also pretty bad. They brough corn bread which was dry, gritty and tasted old. We ordered lots of stuff just to try everything, everything tasted like cheap quality crappy diner food...definitley not worth the prices that would make you expect good quality stuff.

Matza ball soup...it was my first time trying it and I think its one of the worst things I have ever ate. Potatoe pancake was flavorless.

Our food came out seperatley not together, like dish by dish...took forever. Forgot some side sauces, and he took forever to bring it out.

Really? yell at me? really? WTF!Then, for a gross bonus to his rudeness, when he finally arrived to refill our water glasses (after they'd been empty for half the meal), he reached over two plates of food and dripped the condensing water all over what was left of our badly cooked lunches, and into my somewhat decent coffee. NASTY. Now there were no more drinks. For a striking death-blow to the ambiance, the waiters yell at each other across the restaurant floor, as if they are shopping in the fulton mall and not working in a supposedly decent restaurant. At the end of lunch, instead of asking if I would like dessert, the waiter said, ""Are you done.""Done. No, jerk-face, turkeys are done, tests are done, PEOPLE ARE FINISHED.  I could feel my third grade english teacher rising like a phoenix from my heart, and realized, I'm never coming back here.  So I said, ""No, I've finished my lunch, and I would like to see a dessert menu.""Here was the moment that the cheesecake could have saved lunch a bit.  Hell, it's why we came here.  Despite my wanting to walk out at this point, we ordered the chocolate mousse cheesecake. It was good. Not amazing, not perfect, but good.

You are the testament of how atrocious service can destroy a meal, and how once great places degrade into shameful shadows of what they once were. You should fire your entire staff and hire people you can train. Start with this: never reprimand a customer when you get their order wrong, learn your own menu, don't reach across tables, if a water pitcher is condensing- wrap it in a cloth napkin or get another one, at the end of a course- ask the patrons if they'd like to see the menu for the next course, clear plates when the entire table is finished- not as each plate empties, and be nice, courteous, and polite to your customers, or they'll never come back.You will never, ever find me at Juniors again.  Gross.  If the waiters are this awful, I can't imagine what's going on in the kitchen.",1.0

"The best Cheesecake EVER.  I've tried their Strawberry one but I'm a sucker for the Original one.  I ordered a slice and killed it all by myself.  It's a HUGE slice!! I don't even remember how much I paid, but I know it was a decent price for what it's worth.  I flew all the way from Calif just to get a taste of this myself.  I even took ONE WHOLE CAKE home in my carry on on my way BACK to Calif.  I can't wait to go back to get more of this.  I can't get enough!!  You have to taste this for yourself...",5.0
"WORST. SERVICE. EVER.The waiter, besides getting my order wrong (a cheese omelet with french fries and toast), decided to yell at me for pointing out that he didn't bring my fries, insisting that I hadn't ordered them (they come with the omelet). Really? yell at me? really? WTF!Then, for a gross bonus to his rudeness, when he finally arrived to refill our water glasses (after they'd been empty for half the meal), he reached over two plates of food and dripped the condensing water all over what was left of our badly cooked lunches, and into my somewhat decent coffee. NASTY. Now there were no more drinks. For a striking death-blow to the ambiance, the waiters yell at each other across the restaurant floor, as if they are shopping in the fulton mall and not working in a supposedly decent restaurant. At the end of lunch, instead of asking if I would like dessert, the waiter said, ""Are you done.""Done. No, jerk-face, turkeys are done, tests are done, PEOPLE ARE FINISHED.  I could feel my third grade english teacher rising like a phoenix from my heart, and realized, I'm never coming back here.  So I said, ""No, I've finished my lunch, and I would like to see a dessert menu.""Here was the moment that the cheesecake could have saved lunch a bit.  Hell, it's why we came here.  Despite my wanting to walk out at this point, we ordered the chocolate mousse cheesecake. It was good. Not amazing, not perfect, but good. It would have been better if the rude waiter hadn't decided to yell a conversation at the waitress on the other side of the room.  Really, is there a manager around? ever?Juniors, you are a disappointment to Brooklyn. You are the testament of how atrocious service can destroy a meal, and how once great places degrade into shameful shadows of what they once were. You should fire your entire staff and hire people you can train. Start with this: never reprimand a customer when you get their order wrong, learn your own menu, don't reach across tables, if a water pitcher is condensing- wrap it in a cloth napkin or get another one, at the end of a course- ask the patrons if they'd like to see the menu for the next course, clear plates when the entire table is finished- not as each plate empties, and be nice, courteous, and polite to your customers, or they'll never come back.You will never, ever find me at Juniors again.  Gross.  If the waiters are this awful, I can't imagine what's going on in the kitchen.",1.0

You can buy a whole cake if you need to at their bakery counter, however they also sell all types of cake[ chocolate, many varieties of cheese cake, etc..], including the red velvet, by the slice at the take out counter. I have been to that counter to get a slice of cake more times then I am comfortable admitting lol. At a bit under $7 per slice (tax included), the slice is a bit pricey, But, I'll tell you what- it is that good and the slice is a substantial size ( I suppose you're getting your money's worth).

His came out hot and was very yummy! The mustard they have was spicy and delicious. My turkey was a bit dry, but nothing a lil mustard and mayo couldn't fix. The topping on the cake (pun intended) was definitely the Cheesecake! Omg...I didn't think it was gonna live up to all the hype, but it did. We shared the red velvet and the carrot cake.

The bacon that came on top of the burger was delicious, but it's pretty hard to fuck up bacon. The waitress never even came to the table to ask if everything was OK.

"Oh whoa is me... my boss just left us to move back to the east coast.  And it's been a sad time to see him depart.  And although it'll take some time for us to get over this loss... he so kindly reached out to help us mend our hearts a little with a variety of cheesecakes from Juniors in NY!  My first thought when I saw the email was, ""hmmm cheesecake all the way from NY?  It must be good for him to send a couple of them to us here.""  So off I went to try some.  I wasn't able to grab a sample of each flavor he sent... that would just be too much =x hehe... so I got a sliver of Tiramisu and a sliver of Chocolate Mousse.  And as I sit here and write this review, I'm thinking the Tiramisu Cheesecake is gooooood.  There's this crunchy layer in it that I'm enjoying and overall it's making my palette happy.  =) BUT... the sliver of the Chocolate Mousse cheesecake, I'm totally dying over right now.  It's cold, it's smooth, it's melty and it has chocolate chips around it.... mmmmm... delicioso!!  Chocolate's my thing yo!  Definitely a place to consider next time I want to send someone something or have something yummy for a special occassion!  I'd go right in there if I could, but perhaps next time I'm in NY.  =D  That's not to say the Bay Area doesn't have good cheesecake, because we have some bomb diggity choices around here, but something different is always fun!!......... oh wow, yup, just took another bite of the Chocolate Mousse... n omg wow!!  still good... maybe even better than the first bite.  =)  My palette thanks you boss man!!!",5.0
"Yummy cheesecake; though nothing amazingly exciting or delectable.  I got the red velvet. Apparently, a lot of famous people go here. I saw an autographed photo of former President Bill Clinton on the wall. That's pretty special, right? Blessed by the president, haha! Convenient location, since the Brooklyn Bridge is only about 5 minutes away (in a cab).  The staff in the take-out area is very friendly, the staff in the sit-down area is kind of not.

Everyone from New York city  knows you only go to Junior's for Cheese cake!!!! I would never eat the food there!Why they serve meals I have no idea because I do not know anyonepersonally who has ever bothered to eat meals there. But the cheese cakes are as much a part of Brooklyn New York history as Coney Island.They are the classic New York cheese cake. They used to be my favoritebut like with most things that are firsts people always come andimprove on them after wards. Cascon's is my favorite now but you can't eat in they only have counter service. This Junior's  is the original  and was in the news recently (Oct 2009)  for having mice and they showed mice running around chewing on cheese cakes. nydailynews.com/ny_local…slashfood.com/2009/10/21…So no need to go to the original in Brooklyn though for me it holds special memories. Junior's is not  a hipster hang out so don't even think about having brunch here. This is old school Brooklyn and for those who don't know that means it means  poor service and no brunch.  So it is good that tourists can now eat Junior's in Manhattan and do nothave to go all the way to Brooklyn to enjoy the cheese cake. Plus itseems not many people know this but all of Junior's cheese cakes atall of their locations come from the Maspeth warehouse where they arebaked. So you are getting the same thing at the Manhattan locations asyou would in Brooklyn. I have been to all of the locations. 3 stars for the nostalgia and cheese cake minus the mice. But for me I will skip the mice and have it in Manhattan.,3.0
"This place is a classic, especially the original one in Brooklyn. It has that old time feel as soon as you walk in the door too. The menu is looong, so I'm sure you'll find something you like. We just came for cheesecake, but ended up getting a couple sandwiches as well. They start you off with complimentary pickles, pickled beets, and cole slaw. All good. The service was a lil slow, but he was very nice and apologized. I had the fresh roasted turkey on wheat, he had the beef brisket and pastrami on challah. They were about $12 each. His came out hot and was very yummy! The mustard they have was spicy and delicious. My turkey was a bit dry, but nothing a lil mustard and mayo couldn't fix. The topping on the cake (pun intended) was definitely the Cheesecake! Omg...I didn't think it was gonna live up to all the hype, but it did. We shared the red velvet and the carrot cake. The red velvet was very good, but the carrot cake cheesecake was ORGASMIC! I'm sure I'll be craving that again at some point and drag my butt to Brooklyn again.",4.0

"I mean, I never tasted the cheesecake but maybe I should.......On the contrary I did hold a breakfast with my manager and ordered pancakes...It was ""iight"". I think Cracker Barrel's food is better and LESS expensive. Juniors food is TOO pricey which is why I've only been there ONCE.",2.0

"I went there a couple of weeks ago for lunch with a friend. I ordered a bacon cheese burger, cooked medium well. The burgers are huge, so big in fact I couldn't comfortable bite into with out risking burger grease all over my work clothes. That's not so much a complaint as a fact.  What drove me to 2 stars was my burger being all pink and falling apart in the middle. Not even close to Medium, certainly not medium well. The bacon that came on top of the burger was delicious, but it's pretty hard to fuck up bacon. The waitress never even came to the table to ask if everything was OK. Wasted my lunch hour on a lunch that I couldn't eat. I think next time my friend suggests Juniors for lunch, I'm going to pass.",2.0
"Oh whoa is me... my boss just left us to move back to the east coast.  And it's been a sad time to see him depart.  And although it'll take some time for us to get over this loss... he so kindly reached out to help us mend our hearts a little with a variety of cheesecakes from Juniors in NY!  My first thought when I saw the email was, ""hmmm cheesecake all the way from NY?  It must be good for him to send a couple of them to us here.""  So off I went to try some.  I wasn't able to grab a sample of each flavor he sent... that would just be too much =x hehe... so I got a sliver of Tiramisu and a sliver of Chocolate Mousse.  And as I sit here and write this review, I'm thinking the Tiramisu Cheesecake is gooooood.  There's this crunchy layer in it that I'm enjoying and overall it's making my palette happy.  =) BUT... the sliver of the Chocolate Mousse cheesecake, I'm totally dying over right now.  It's cold, it's smooth, it's melty and it has chocolate chips around it.... mmmmm... delicioso!!  Chocolate's my thing yo!  Definitely a place to consider next time I want to send someone something or have something yummy for a special occassion!  I'd go right in there if I could, but perhaps next time I'm in NY.  =D  That's not to say the Bay Area doesn't have good cheesecake, because we have some bomb diggity choices around here, but something different is always fun!!......... oh wow, yup, just took another bite of the Chocolate Mousse... n omg wow!!  still good... maybe even better than the first bite.  =)  My palette thanks you boss man!!!",5.0
"Yummy cheesecake; though nothing amazingly exciting or delectable.  I got the red velvet. Apparently, a lot of famous people go here. I saw an autographed photo of former President Bill Clinton on the wall. That's pretty special, right? Blessed by the president, haha! Convenient location, since the Brooklyn Bridge is only about 5 minutes away (in a cab).  The staff in the take-out area is very friendly, the staff in the sit-down area is kind of not. Restrooms upstairs rather large, and fairly clean. We had to order a couple appetizers in order to be allowed to sit down inside. Service alright. I probably wont go back unless it's in some kind of touristy schedule for friends who have not been to Brooklyn.",3.0
Everyone from New York city  knows you only go to Junior's for Cheese cake!!!! I would never eat the food there!Why they serve meals I have no idea because I do not know anyonepersonally who has ever bothered to eat meals there. But the cheese cakes are as much a part of Brooklyn New York history as Coney Island.They are the classic New York cheese cake. They used to be my favoritebut like with most things that are firsts people always come andimprove on them after wards. Cascon's is my favorite now but you can't eat in they only have counter service. This Junior's  is the original  and was in the news recently (Oct 2009)  for having mice and they showed mice running around chewing on cheese cakes. nydailynews.com/ny_local…slashfood.com/2009/10/21…So no need to go to the original in Brooklyn though for me it holds special memories. Junior's is not  a hipster hang out so don't even think about having brunch here. This is old school Brooklyn and for those who don't know that means it means  poor service and no brunch.  So it is good that tourists can now eat Junior's in Manhattan and do nothave to go all the way to Brooklyn to enjoy the cheese cake. Plus itseems not many people know this but all of Junior's cheese cakes atall of their locations come from the Maspeth warehouse where they arebaked. So you are getting the same thing at the Manhattan locations asyou would in Brooklyn. I have been to all of the locations. 3 stars for the nostalgia and cheese cake minus the mice. But for me I will skip the mice and have it in Manhattan.,3.0
"Came here just for the cheescake since we had heard so much about it. Between us we had the Raspberry swirl, the Strawberry, and the Strawberry shortcake. There were all DELICIOUS!!! So good.

"So I came here last night with my Lefrak close circle.  We got one of each-yellow cake with choco frosting-cheesecake-german choco cake-strawberry shake-banana shake-pineapple ice cream soda-cheese friesAll four of us got financially molested though.  They included a lavish gratuity ""because it was after 9pm"".  Nevermind the fact that we were FOUR PEOPLE ordering stuff from a case, A party of 6, 8, 12, ordering dish after dish and dessert and many a beverage and coffee, and getting rolls and butter and coleslaw, THAT I COULD UNDERSTAND, tack it on.  Hell include the tip in the bill and expect even more!  But damn...why us?All this cold waitress unable to communicate or use curteous language did was look at us and wait for our order.  Then she chases us down.  As I pulled out my bills I had well over a months salary for her in my hand.  I told her that the receipt area labeled ""tip""  was ""the suggested gratuity, right?"" ""No it's on the menu, after 9pm gratuity is included."" I'm thinking ""Where, underneath the part where it says 'Hey cops if you come in here on a Thursday night you can probably catch a drug bust in the kitchen.'?""   So I gave her a five (overtipping her 3 dollars more in the process) and said ""Yeah here's for chasing us down.""

"So I came here last night with my Lefrak close circle.  We got one of each-yellow cake with choco frosting-cheesecake-german choco cake-strawberry shake-banana shake-pineapple ice cream soda-cheese friesAll four of us got financially molested though.  They included a lavish gratuity ""because it was after 9pm"".  Nevermind the fact that we were FOUR PEOPLE ordering stuff from a case, A party of 6, 8, 12, ordering dish after dish and dessert and many a beverage and coffee, and getting rolls and butter and coleslaw, THAT I COULD UNDERSTAND, tack it on.  Hell include the tip in the bill and expect even more!  But damn...why us?All this cold waitress unable to communicate or use curteous language did was look at us and wait for our order.  Then she chases us down.  As I pulled out my bills I had well over a months salary for her in my hand.  I told her that the receipt area labeled ""tip""  was ""the suggested gratuity, right?"" ""No it's on the menu, after 9pm gratuity is included."" I'm thinking ""Where, underneath the part where it says 'Hey cops if you come in here on a Thursday night you can probably catch a drug bust in the kitchen.'?""   So I gave her a five (overtipping her 3 dollars more in the process) and said ""Yeah here's for chasing us down."" And by chasing us down I mean, continuing-her-laziness-and-calling-for-us.I'm not gonna front, I'm going back to Junior's.  The pineapple cheesecake is too good.But I will get my tip back.  Come hell, high water or idiot restaurant manager.Gratuity my bum.  I'm not thankful, you old bag.  AND DON'T THINK I'M CHEAP.  We tipped 90% the other day at Presidente.  That lady was busting her ass.  She would've shined our shoes but we were wearing sneakers.",2.0

And there's a thin layer of angel food cake between the layers. oh. my. god.",4.0
"I'm sorry but this is not the world's best Cheesecake.  It's not terrible, I mean I will eat it; but it's not the best.  Their moniker as the world famous ""Junior's"" is cute, but idk, I'm not smitten by this place.  And do they actually have a doorman or was that just a random homeless person who so graciously shooed me in?",2.0

"I just recently went to Junior's for the first time! Sure, I've had the cheesecake at functions before, and it is undeniably delicious. However, I was excited about the ""Junior's Experience,"" so my roommate and I brought her out-of-town relatives there for a Brooklyn Experience.We had no reservations, and the place appeared to be packed. We weren't in a rush and didn't mind waiting. They quoted us a 30 minute wait, but I think it was faster than that. Once seated, we were given a selection of PICKLED THINGS. This might've been my favorite part! There were pickled beets, cabbage slaw, and pickles. Also served were rolls and yummy corn bread. Our waiter was really great. He was super friendly, and gave us extra PICKLED THINGS because my roommate loves them.I ordered a ""sandwich"" called the Something Different. Something different, indeed! It was yummy, tender brisket, sliced thin and piled high between two POTATO PANCAKES. By the end, we were so full, we had to take our cheesecake home!YUM. A great experience, a Brooklyn must-go. Go early, go hungry. Don't fill up on the PICKLED THINGS too much. Save room for dessert!",5.0
"This place is a bit tricky....but I've tried and tested it for so long that I've decoded the formula;1. The cheesecake is over-rated. (I'm from Philly, I know cheesecake, and my mom's trumps theirs by far because of crust, mainly) their crust is upsetting, and their toppings taste way mass-produced. Go with the milkshake instead (if you're eating in)2. The best thing at Junior's is actually their mile-high deli sandwiches. Get the corned beef & pastrami on rye with a side of fries. You might have to take some home, because the portion is huge, but the lunch special allows for a smaller portion-bargain.3. As for the rest of the menu, look at the place like a hyped-up, pricey diner. Diners are only good for certain things, and certain things only; mostly basic and bland classics served on heavy plates in an old-fashioned Americana way, with lots of food.4. When you order meat, esp. hamburgers, know that they will ALWAYS be overcooked by one-two temperatures from the way you ordered it.5. Their bar is very very liberal on the alcohol...management does not care if they doctor up your drink extra stiffly, so take advantage. If you sit at the bar (especially) you will not only get a colorful experience of regulars, old playas, young playas, creeps, tourists, and a few other characters, but a strong drink and probably a very memorable conversation.6. Their service always ranges between bad and terrible. People act like they're doing you a favor by serving you, and management doesn't seem to care. You have to schmooze to get decent service, basically.7. In my opinion the best things at Junior's are:a. deli sandwichesb. the fries!! (who else has good steak fries in Brooklyn?) the sweet potato fries are damn good, too.c. the milkshakes, floats, egg creams and sundaesd. the stiff drinks (even though their drink menu is cheesy)e. breakfast menu (their cornbeef hash is good, so are eggs, french toast, and other stuff that's hard to mess up, etc.)f. side of spaghetti (it's really good!!)g. mashed potatoes & gravyh.  a few other things that I can't think of right now, but that's the jist of itSo go at your own risk, and remember....everything's hit or miss so stick to the formula!",2.0

"I don't like cheesecake but the Junior's cheesecake is delicious. The bulk of the cake has this vanilla taste. The edges have the tasty sugar crumbs. The chocolate cake is a tad too rich. You need a gallon of milk to wash it down. As for the entrees, the burgers are awesome (ask for medium rare or they'll overcook it). Forget the Big Mac and Whopper-Junior's is the best. The fries are lousy. Soggy, tasteless fries. However, the onion rings are the best. Instead of getting fries and onion rings tell the waiter you want a double order of onion rings. There's no additional charge. I also liked the chicken parmagiana. It is very delicious. However, you'd have to be a sumo wrestler to finish the whole thing. I definitely recommend Junior's.",4.0
"My friend Collin stopped by here on the way to a dinner in Brooklyn and picked up the heaviest cheesecake ever!  It was like a weight it was so dense but man it was rich.The two tiny young Italian girls at dinner were somehow able to eat massive amounts while I could barely finish a small piece.  It was wonderfully rich though so probably just as well.To top it all off, all I actually had was the cheese-pie - not even the full-on cheese-cake which Collin insisted was bigger and better.  I am not sure I can believe that there's a larger richer version, but I think I'm willing to find out next time I am nearby and starving!",4.0

We left there with at $65 tab. dinner + dessert. It was so crowded (but then again it was v-day). I had the red velvet cake for desert because i'm not a huge fan of cheesecake... lets just say i've had better all around. I would probably not go back to Juniors unless someone was taking me there and paying for it. I'm from Los Angeles and have been to way better establishments serving the same demographic. Overall Juniors for me did not live up to the hype.,2.0
"I'm from Cali and we have a juniors out here but the juniors in Brooklyn is way better. well the cheesecake is a lot better, i only tried the cheesecake because i was in a rush but so is everyone else in new York. most of the places i visited in NY had really bad service but the customer service here was quite good. i will make a trip back to NY and i will go back to juniors but next time ill try something different",3.0

"Creamiest cheesecake ever! I'm used to the standard ""cheesecake factory"" slice. Juniors was a force to be reckoned with. My date warned me.... ""grab a glass of milk,"" I didn't listen.  My only gripe is based on personal preference, I was a little deprived of my Graham cracker crust. But delicious nonetheless.",4.0

The first time I went, I wasn't too impressed, but I was thinking maybe it just wasn'ta good day for the restaurant. But the second time I went, confirmed why I won't ever be coming back. The place is crappy, the cheesecake (and food) is nasty, and the service isn't the best. I mean, you would think they would at least update the place. But no, it's still crappy looking Junior's.

"Opened in 1950, this is the original location and a true Brooklyn landmark. Everything on the menu - most of which merits only three or four stars - takes second place to the five-star cheesecake - thick, creamy, and rich enough to satisfy your sweet tooth for a week or two. It comes in a number of varieties and, if you're looking for something more fancy-schmancy than the classic plain, brownie marble swirl is your best bet.",5.0

On many previous occasions, I have had you world famous cheesecake only in you 2 city locations. Last night i had the urge around 11 pm , we hopped in the car and headed over to your site. We found parking with ease, and entered your restaurant. I was like WOW, like a kid going to toys r us in the city for the 1st time. After that everything went downhill.........My views are of an avid foodie with a touch of a business man.                    The counter on the right sells pies.I was very intrigued by the heart shape pies. I asked the host behind the counter about them and the pricesME: hey, how you doin ,  what is on top of that heart shape pie and how much is it?host: berries . 44.95 ( i could be off with the prices)M: how much for the plain heart shape?H: after given me a decent stare of 5 seconds , he said 39.95 I was like ok , maybe this kid with his cap goin in another direction is having a bad night.

I realized it was not the right thing to do, but i told my wife wi ll leave a couple dollars tip. We also talked to each other about the 2 gentleman i had interacted with so far, and she said "" welcome to brooklyn"" I was like no, some thing ain't right.

Infact all he did was stare at us in intervals at least 10 times. This man looked very sad & unhappy. In fact everybody looked the same, I was like whoa, even the folks at ihop are happier  and have a smile on their face, even though it was like midnight, it was still within your operating hours. None of your staff looked happy, I kept looking at the host who was seating people down. He never greeted any folks in, whenever people would walk up there to be seated, instead of greeting or having a smile, all he said were how many?In the 15 minutes we were there, 4-5 employees clocked out, and wished goodnight to st. patrick, and he looked at his hand watch every time they passed by.Most of your staff at the time looked indian/guyanese. kinda odd, it is ok i guess. what irked me was whenever they talked among themselves it was in their native language, which is rude cause a lot of ppl could hear them talk.As usual we could not finish our slices, I left NO tip, cause i was let down.

"Junior's is one Brooklyn institution that lives up to the hype.  It's just a shame that most downtown Brooklyn institutions like the Paramount, the Fox, and scores of other old school theaters have not survived along with the maker of one of the best cheesecakes anywhere.  Still, as ""old"" downtown Brooklyn continues to die a slow death and transforms itself into the Ratner City Space Station, Juniors will remain.  Don't even BOTHER trying to procure a cheesecake on the eve of a big family holiday.  Not going to happen.  The lines are three deep...now that's girth (lil inside joke for those who remember me misusing 'girth' in the Mark W. post)!  Best part about Junior's is that the cheesecake isn't the sole reason to eat here.  They have a pretty impressive diner menu that includes an enormous hamburger that would easily fill the most bottomless pit of a belly.  The portion of fries served with a deluxe is generous, and even gratuitous given the size of the burgers.  More than anything, I find the wait staff incredibly kind and accommodating given the daily pressures they must encounter with the sheer number of customers.  Our waiter returned no less than 5 times...and not in an annoying manner, to make sure we had everything we needed.  Also, if you have room, don't pass up any of their old school diner classics like a milk shake or a cherry lime rickey...Junior's blends them all to perfection.  Just do yourself a favor, and make it to Junior's before you die.  Travel with that ""Death or cheesecake"" spirit, and your meal will be that much more satisfying.  Personally, I prefer cheesecake to death.P.s.

"What Veniero's is to Manhattan is what Junior's is to Brooklyn. This place is overrated due in fact to being another establishment of old Brooklyn. The cheesecake is pretty good, but not spectacular. It's not much different from most cheesecakes I've had in many bakeries.",3.0
"What can I say? Wisdom of crowds and all that: the cheesecake here really is transporting, as would be the forklift required to cart me home if I'd had an entree with it. They look awfully big. Three stars on the assumption that the food might be reasonable.",3.0
"we only had the cheesecake, but that's all we needed to have to give it 5 stars!  it was absolutely the best cheesecake i've ever had ... we had the strawberry cheesecake and it had the most wonderful strawberry topping, with real strawberries.  my only complaint, which may be another person's preference, was that the crust was too thin.  i like a chunk of crust with each bite and there wasn't enough to go around.",5.0
"I give the cheesecake a yummy 5 stars. However, the food is nothing to brag about. I think you might have a better time going to burger king!",3.0
"Solid my friends... well, depending on what you are going for... but the menu has everything... I mean everything.  My favorite there are the blintzes, but have had great soups and desserts.. oh yes, the desserts.  Very heavy eating, but hey, it's a delicattesen for Christ sake... stop complaining.  Everyone talks about the Cheesecake, and yes, it is the best in the city, but I really am not a Cheesecake fan.  I don't think the pastrami is as good as Katz's or Carnegie, but not many are and definitely still solid meat sandwiches for sure.  A solid Brooklyn eatery and if you are sick and need some comfort food... they will help you feels all better.",4.0
"Was on the prowl for Southern Fried food today (because, sometimes, it's nice to eat your emotions - particularly when laden in grease).  Unfortunately, Southern-Fried isn't something to try at Junior's (and, admittedly, in Brooklyn) - and, yes, I admit that the only reason we tried Junior's is because nothing else was open (Happy New Years Eve!).  Still, it's an experience: the vast sterility, florescent overhead lighting, razmatazz holiday decorations (glitter-tipped poinsettia! twinkle lights! aluminum garland!), tuxedoed wait-staff, etc.  Must admit that the price wasn't that bad - less than $40 for two entrees & mimosa; plus, a parade of complimentary, off-the-wall nibbles (coleslaw, beets & cornbread) arrive right when you're seated.  I ordered Southern Fried Chicken; my friend Chicken Fried Steak.  The steak had a better scald to it and it was moister; the chicken was a bit over-cooked - however, while I preferred the steak, my friend preferred the chicken (we agreed to dine together more).  The potatoes were good but tasted a smidge boxy, the corn was delicious.   The service was attentive and the waitress was the most cheerful soul around.  If I ever were to patron Junior's again, it would be late a night, after a breeze on the dancefloor - during that in between time when even the streets seem to be sleeping.  When all you really want is a clean, well-lighted place that feels like a few steps into yesteryear.  When all you really want is a plate of steaming cornbread, mashed potatoes & fried chicken.",2.0
"was in nyc in 2003 and had to stop here and get some cheesecake.  i preferred the plain cheesecake!  bought some to go also and it tasted better the next day, mmm.  then in 2005 a friend had bought a whole plain cheesecake for my family & i online and it arrived next day just as yummy.",5.0
"Best cheesecake ever. I still dream about it. Don't order anything else, like for example peach cobbler - you will regret missing out on the cheesecake for years afterwards.",5.0
"Junior's was the first restaurant I ever went to in NY. My lunch was standard diner fair and was quite good though not deserving of 4 stars. Why 5 stars then? CHEESECAKE!! I think the strawberry cheesecake is the absolute best I ever had, and I have had many. I live in Brooklyn now and any time I go to a dinner party, my friends leave it to me to bring dessert.

"Surprisingly, my first experience with Junior's cheesecake was when my then bf's mom sent us a plain cheesechake while we were living in Honolulu.  Holy crap.  That's some seriously good stuff...nowadays I can feed my cheesecake addiction via online ordering...and they send it in a box with dry ice packed in it so your cheesecake stays cool as it makes its way to you all the way from Brooklyn.  They cost about $30 each...SO worth it.  Trust me.",5.0
"Had lunch here because I was at a workshop right across the street at Long Island University.  My friend, Alexis, had grilled chicken with collard greens and mashed potatoes.  She said the dish was delicious!

"I've long been a Junior's fan, thanks to the Grand Central location.  But today I found myself at Brooklyn Technical HS for a NYC teacher event, and with a quick Yelp I found that the original Junior's is mere steps away-- off I went!The place is an oasis on a hot day, especially for a dessert lover.  I scurried across Flatbush, overhearing a nurse from a nearby hospital recommending Junior's to two wanderers: ""The food's ok-- but the dessert's amazing.""  I knew I was going to the right place.  Marveling at the rows and rows of luscious desserts, I ordered an egg salad sandwich and a piece of what I thought was marble cheesecake (turns out chocolate swirl is the proper name), completely forgetting to order a beverage, which just demonstrates that I value my chocolate ingestion over hydration.  I took my booty ($6.95 for the sandwich and a whopping $5.75 for the cake) across the street to a park by LIU and chowed down.  The sandwich was more than ok, in fact, as far as simple egg salad goes, it was very good, and came with 2 perfect pickles.  The cheesecake actually was less of a swirl and more of a double decker: very thin bottom layer of chocolate cake, then a thick layer of chocolate cheesecake, topped by an equally thick layer of regular cheesecake.  Had I known this, I might have stuck to the plain.  Chocolate cheesecake just seems like overkill.The place is cute, very busy at noon, and seemed mixed with both local regulars and tourists.  I wouldn't go back specially since I can get the food at Grand Central, but if I'm in the neighborhood, this would merit a return visit.Update: If you are at Junior's and not in the mood for cheesecake (heaven forbid!) their cupcakes are quite possibly the best in the universe.  They are $3.25 but two people could easily share (I didn't!) because they are enormous cupcakes on steroids-- not delicate little creations like I had at Buttercup.  The cake is buttery and delicious on its own (a rarity!), but topped with an enormous swirl of yellow, purple, pink, blue, or chocolate frosting, with edges rolled in fresh rainbow sprinkles... UMMMMMMMM.  I don't think the frosting is buttercream, which is great, just sugar, sugar, and more sugar!Update 10/07- eat in service is slow!",3.0

"2 stars for a reason not related to the food.  A friend at work who was born and raised in Brooklyn said if you do one thing, you have to eat some Juniors cheesecake.  I'm here in NYC for a week. I bought the NY Pass which says in the book ""Holders of the New York Pass are entitled to a free slice of plain cheesecake with $10 food purchase. Not available for take out. Valid only in the Brooklyn location.""  Okay, so we just need to spend $10 to get a $6 cheesecake for free.  Spend 10 and get 16.  We start to order some tea, onion rings and mac and cheese.  The waiter said we need to buy an Entree.  So, I felt duped and I think Juniors isn't honoring the words printed in the NY Pass booklet.  We just got a piece cheesecake.  It was good. Smooth creamy and a bit of lemon in the crust to help add some acid to break down the richness of the cheesecake.  Had I not felt duped by the waiter/management of Juniors, I would rate the chessecake a solid 4.5 stars.  It was really good.",2.0
