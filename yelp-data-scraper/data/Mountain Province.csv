"Omg this is my favorite cafe in Brooklyn. I'm in love with everything here from the coffee and taro / matcha lattes to the pork kimchi sandwiches and cassava cake. The sweets (drinks and food) are delicate and the pork sandwich is so crispy and packs a peppery zing. The interior is cute, reminds me of a small cabin in a one street town. The front of the cafe lets in a lot of natural light which is nice for reading or studying but the back can be a bit dark. I don't mind it so much though. Music is also not too loud so it's not distracting when you're trying to get work done.",5.0
"I had never heard of this place and a friend took me here last week.Really terrific latte.  Smooth and well prepared.  No bitterness at all.I also had a pineapple scone that was very very good.  I head they have cassava cake, but didn't have any the day I went.I look forward to the warmer months when I can try their iced coffee.  And cassava cake is in my future for sure.Decent prices and the barista was pretty busy but friendly anyway.",4.0
"My favorite coffee shop in all of Brooklyn.They make the best cold brew and avocado toast you can find, in my honest opinion...I get it at least twice a week. I'm vegan but I know their scones and pastries are also delicious, and their prices are great.The people who work here are incredibly nice and unique--it always makes my days better when I stop by. The place itself also has a lot of character with palm tree wallpaper and nice homey touches. It's usually quiet, which I love, and I've met some pretty awesome people here just in passing conversations.Whenever I move and I'm not in the same neighborhood as this coffee shop, I will be very sad but will still hop on the subway to come here.",5.0
"It's a cute little neighborhood place, the cafe is not that big but they produce a quality coffee. They offer free wifi, most of the tables are 2 seater tables with a large table in the back corner.The food:Mocha- The coffee art here is pretty on point. The milk foam was pretty cool, the mocha was nice and soothing. It was really relaxing to drink and it was not overly sweet. yelp.com/user_local_phot…Iced Coffee- The ice coffee here is a popular item and I liked it. I am not the biggest coffee person but I enjoyed it.",4.0
"I came here because I saw the coconut muffin is in a banana leaf (and banana leaves give me life)... But I also got a gorgeous flat white, the best spicy pork sandwich in life, and a generous helping of Korean Trap Music.  Guys... The pork sandwich was on crispy ciabatta with that RIPE kimchi. Ugh. *mic drop*I'm coming back tomorrow.",5.0
Amazing coffee and great service!!! Very friendly staff and cozy coffee shop Best coffee in town,5.0
"The thing about this place is that it is family owned and not at all pretentious. Yet, without all the ""artisanal"" fuss they bake all of their goodies in house. You can smell the baking aroma. I go for the cold brew, or almond milk latte. Service is efficient, New York style. I love this place. Plenty of room if you need to get some work done. Can't resist the CASSAVA CAKE.",5.0
Pineapple Scone. This is what I was here for. I love scones and I love pineapples even more. Who knew you could marry the two?! Pineapple Scone was so fluffy soft on the inside. Sweet pieces of pineapple here and there throughout the scone. It was a light snack and really wished that I got another one!Iced coffee was aromatic and refreshing for my taste.  Quite a relaxing cafe spot for its tiki island decor and air conditioning blowing upon arrival. I love the wooden chairs and tables. Everything is very well spaced out and have many comfortable seating spots for patrons. I'll be back!,5.0
"I freaking love this place. If only it was closer...Tucked away in East Williamsburg, Mountain Province is the rare cafe that gets five stars from me. The coffee is imported from the Philippines and if you're a coffee addict, you'll taste the beans in the cup. It has a earthy, smoky flavor and the first I had a sip, was surprised by how prominent it was. Their espresso-based drinks are carefully made. For the pastries, you can try the cassava cake, taro brioche, or the coconut bibinka (muffin). You can't go wrong with any of them because they're all lightly sweet (my kind of pastry!) but my favorite is the coconut bibinka.  It is a quaint little cafe with island themed wallpaper to make it feel like you are in the Phlippines. That combined with the service, coffee, and food selection make it rise to the top. Happy eating and remember: don't deny, satisfy!",5.0
"What can I say that hasn't been said? This place is a second home to me. With delicious coffee and baked goods (try the Cassava cake!), this is a gem. I'm totally obsessed with their cold brew and taro lattes! They are always concocting something new and delicious to add to the menu. This is the kind of place you can camp out at and get work done or stick around and chat with whoever is working for the day. This is truly the first place that made me feel like a Brooklyn resident when I first moved and I LOVE THEM (and their coffee).",5.0
"It really does feel like you've hit the jackpot when you step outside your place, walk across the street, and try out what would soon to be your new favorite flat white. Hands down my current love and I will be sad when I have to go back home and deal with a lack of Mountain Province coffee. So the other reviews ring true and I am so glad they led me here. The service is quick and the shop is quiet and cozy for you to get substantial work done as it it's not by any means suitable for large groups. This bodes well for someone who wants alone time in any form of work or leisure.",5.0
Excellent Food & Service. Really liked it.Coffee was really worth. Pricing was competitive as well.,5.0
"Just went here for a coffee fix and wifi. Really nice atmosphere with nice quiet music conducive to studying or getting work done. Most people in there are on laptops working, so no loud conversations to overhear. I haven't tried their food, but they were baking while I was there and it smelled amazing. Very tiny place and not many seats, but I say way in the back corner and it was a good little nook.",5.0
"This quaint little shop is a treasure trove of addictive delights. The many positive reviews on Yelp lured me and I'm glad I came. It was a rather wet dreary Thursday afternoon but it almost felt sunny and warm inside. It has a yuppie yet unpretentious vibe with a nice touch of quiet piano/sax jazz. There is free WiFi, with a decent connection, 5Mbps when I was there.I had iced Jasmine tea and the coconut muffin which were both wonderful. It was my first time and Ray Sr., dad of one of the owners, gave me a cassava cake on the house. It was glorious! Later, while I was having hot latte, Ray Jr. just delivered yet another freebie, in a box, and he said, 'For you to take home.' Unfreakinbelievable.Being new to NYC, I made small conversations with staff who were quite accommodating. Chevy was helpful with advice on my house-hunting, settling in, etc.I highly recommend Mountain Province if you're looking for a quiet place to relax and enjoy a cuppa. I knew I'd be back.",5.0
"I ordered an iced tea, and they poured hot tea over a cup of ice.  Yuck! You end up with just a big cup of watered down lukewarm tea.  If you don't have already cooled tea, don't say you serve iced tea.  You don't! It's a bad customer experience to get lukewarm watery tea, so why offer it to customers?Or at least warn me beforehand you're going to pour hot tea! I would've ordered something else if I had know they were going to do that.",1.0
"Excellent lattes and coffee, and I've heard nothing but high praise for the baked goods. Cozy spot on a cold day. For New York standards, there's a ton of seating space (though it can fill up on busies days). My go-to here is an almond milk latte. I don't think one can really go wrong regardless.",5.0
"This beautiful coffee shop is a hidden gem. No wonder that it is the top rated coffee shop. I just hope that it won't be impossible to get into now that it's so popular. I love everything about it. The ambiance is lovely, the coffee is heavenly, and the ube brioche is to die for! The owner, Ray is an absolute sweetheart and a hottie.Will be back again soon!!",5.0
"Adding to the pile of accolades, I am yet another satisfied guest. I don't give 5 stars to most coffee shops as I am very critical of all facets of the cafe environment from decor to taste to service. I pass by this spot every morning on the way to my shop and the reviews had intrigued me. Entering an unassuming environment with what can only be described as my grandmothers wall paper and tables, I was ready to poke holes in all the other reviews. As always I ordered an espresso and a latte. The barista was a wealth of information(side note: he was quite stylish with a nose ring and top knot hair.) when asked about the roaster, I was pleased to hear an educated response. They're using Kalsada out of the Philippines with the espresso having a very Cherry forward palette and a slight dark chocolate finish. The espresso was expertly done with the description matching the taste. It was smooth yet had the slight acidity you'd expect from the cherry notes. I was hoping for a much more dark chocolate finish, but that's just my personal taste no fault on their part. The latte was done quite well with a Rosetta on top. The milk was tempered correctly and the balance of flavors worked well. I ordered an oat bran muffin and was pleased to find the taste matched all previous reviews.  When speaking with the individuals behind the counter I was pleased to find their demeanor and service was friendly and professional. They even suggested I go to another shop to try different coffees. Overall this is one of my favorite coffee experiences I've had in NYC. Believe the hype and treat yourself to something special. Just ignore the walls ;)",5.0
"Mountain Province has, without a doubt, the best cold brew I've ever had in my life. Their lattes, cappuccinos, and other espresso drinks are very good but the cold brew is mind blowing. Their unique food dishes and small snacks are very good. The place really reminds me of a coffee shop you would see in Asheville, NC or somewhere else in the Smoky Mountains. It is a little bit small and some of the seating arrangements are kind of odd but it's still a good place to relax and get some work done. The prices are a little expensive, about as much as Blue Bottle, but I'd say it's worth it. Definitely worth a visit if you are in the area.",4.0

"Came here on a Sunday morning for the first time. This place is so cute with their paròls (Filipino x-mas lanterns) hanging in the front! It's super cozy here. I feel like I'm back to my first shitty apartment in Bay Ridge circa '97 with the wall paper, mismatching decoration and silver radiators. BUT in the best nostalgic way ever. The workers/owners are sweet Filipino people! Fil-Am myself I love helping my kababayans (fellow country-men) out. You see someone's dad behind the counter whipping up these filipino inspired goodies. I ordered a cappuccino and pineapple scone. So tasty! The scone was so moist and yummmmmy. The texture was almost buttery and biscuit like. The cappuccino is solid and tasty. Very smooth and not bitter at all. What's the best part of this place? You can get a Capp and a pastry for 5$!!! Solid and awesome prices here. If and when I do decide to go back to graduate school I can envision the many hours and dollars $$$ I would end up spending here. My only gripe is how far I live from here!We shall meet again soon Mountain Province. Promise. Love always,Gabi A.",5.0

My girlfriend had the coconut latte with almond milk...a must try for vegans. What else did we indulge in a coconut muffin which was moist and delicious. The mystery desert was the yuca muffin that had me doing  back flips......freaking mouth watering flavors on the desert. Oh a big plus was the staff was super chill and made you feel welcomed...............I can't wait for my next cup of Joe.,5.0
"Simple, unpretentious, great vibe with refreshing A/C and nice little wooden tables. Great place to either get social or get productive. I love the surrounding neighborhood blocks, too. Where this place really rallies is in the baked goods - they all looked so good so naturally I went buck wild and got all of 'em: cassava bar, coconut muffin, and brioche with Japanese berry and whipped cream. Every single one was sweet with out being cloying and so ridiculously reasonably priced I had to ask the counter dude to make sure he didn't under-charge me. I loved all the textures and tastes, and the banana leaf added to the presentation.I've been a bit under the weather lately so no caffeine for me. Instead, the keffir lime, avocado, mango smoothie was just what the doctor ordered - generous in both size and flavor. I left happy, sated, and stimulated.

"50 reviews, 5 star average. You've got to be doing something right with numbers like that - I was excited to go in, but cautious too, since I didn't want to overhype the place to myself. Getting in, I admit I was thrown. The decor is more ""grandma's kitchen"" than espresso bar, but it had a warm sort of quiet charm to it. Speaking of warm, the entire staff was nice and friendly from start to finish, definite A+ on that front.They have a nice number of coffee options available as well as several teas. I had the jasmine green tea and was not disappointed, finding it a lovely way to warm up a dreary day. It also nicely complimented the brioche bun with Japanese purple yam. The bun itself was flavorful and nicely-textured, topped with a bit of butter and sugar. The purple yam was new to me - a bit sweet, a bit savory, but it's little touches like that that really make items like this stand out.Afterwards, I just couldn't stay away from a pineapple scone, which turned out to be everything I hoped for - a sweet finish to a tasty, carb-filled breakfast. Now for those keeping score, that's a mug of tea and two breakfast items, totalling all of five dollars. Nice!No complaints here - but that only nets a place three or four stars. For five you've got to have something special, and Mountain Province's warm atmosphere, hot drinks, and tasty treats fit the bill nicely.",5.0
"Alright, so I admit that this has been visited almost every single day since I discovered this gem in my current neighborhood about a week ago. I told myself that I was on a semi-mission to try a different cafe every single day in the Williamsburg area (since there is definitely no shortage of that around here). However, this has been some of the best coffee I've had around here in New York, so I keep coming back almost every single day. My other go to spot would be Oslo (but damn I miss Bay Area coffee). Until my Philz gets shipped here, you can find me here at Mountain Province about once a day, Oslo, or reminiscing over at Blue Bottle for a little taste of home. I like that they offer a good amount of pastries here (and not the janky kind). I've had it myself and it tastes pretty damn good! I've been spotting some type of delicious, generous portion of what appears to be avocado toast being made here. I didn't see it on the menu but will likely be back for it real soon :)The place is super cute as well. Seating gets semi-packed, and the internet is a little slow.

I forgot to take a picture because I was too excited to eat it) EXCELLENT coffee and hot chocolate! Reasonable pricing, plenty of outlets, free wifi, CLEAN bathroom! I love the wallpaper, make sure to pay attention to the details of the decor of the place. Adorable chairs and jam-worthy music. Everything was perfect about this place.

"Great place with awesome latte! It is a great place to get some work done or to simply hang out. Inside is clean and nicely organized. The staff was very friendly, there is wifi, and there are a lot of outlets for those who need it.It is a bit hard to find, but once  you find it you'll definitely want to keep going back for more!",5.0
Wonderful staff and best coffee in the cityGreat location.  A must try for all coffee lovers.,5.0
"So I wanted to find a quiet study spot near my house today and stumbled upon this place, right by the Broadway G station. Let me get straight to the point:EXCELLENT service (mind you, it is not table service yet they still brought my food and water to my table, and helped clean off the table afterwards) EXCELLENT snacks (cassava cake was freshly baked and UH-mazing!! I forgot to take a picture because I was too excited to eat it) EXCELLENT coffee and hot chocolate! Reasonable pricing, plenty of outlets, free wifi, CLEAN bathroom! I love the wallpaper, make sure to pay attention to the details of the decor of the place. Adorable chairs and jam-worthy music. Everything was perfect about this place. I wish it was down the block for me so I could be a regular!!",5.0
WOW !!  This is a damn good coffe spot. Service was lil slow and just seemed the staff wanted to be elsewhere (maybe just a bad daywe all have them) but my muffin and latte were amazing. I will definitely return to this java gold mind:),4.0
"Update after living here for the better part of a year - this is still my favorite place to get a coffee.  And the cassava cake has replaced the scone as my favorite edible when I need a little treat (the taro brioche is also amazing).  The real highlights, though, are still the excellently made coffee drinks and the beautiful people who run it.",5.0
"Awesome place to relax on a Saturday morning with a coffee and a newspaper--it feels a bit like the neighborhood's living room. A lot of that is due to the coffee and staff (both excellent), but I think the bathroom deserves a shout-out too: it puts many bed-and-breakfasts' facilities to shame.I've stuck to lattes and americanos, but I've seen the guys behind the counter make an impressive range of drinks for very reasonable prices. If you're consistent enough with your order they'll start on your drink before you even have a chance to say hello.All that said I wish this place would stay open past 6 PM (an opinion echoed by others) and occasionally the lack of simple foods like bagels has been frustrating. Overall, though, great coffee shop in a neighborhood that needs it!",5.0

"Nice little coffee shop. Stopped in while walking around. They had a nice pastry list. I really wanted to try the taro brioche, but they were out.. so I guess lesson number 1, come early =D.

Kinda stuffy and awkward standing in there waiting for your drink but it was probably just my THC induced social anxiety.Anyway the latte I got was amazing and I'm gonna go there all the time now.,5.0

"A quite little place that I happened into on a lonely, rainy Saturday afternoon whilst wandering Williamsburg. I was pleased at how friendly the server was, and I suspect he may be the owner.

"This is my favourite coffee shop.The owners are really friendly, the desserts always hit the spot and the coffee is good. My favourite dessert is probably the coconut muffin! My least favourite is probably the pineapple scone, but that's because I prefer my pineapple to scone ratio 2:1. I love that they have plenty of power outlets and make no complaints when you stay to work there for too long--i'm guilty of this. I love the music they play, it's perfect for relaxing or concentrating, it's strangely very conducive for studying. I can punch out a paper in probably half the amount of time if I were sitting elsewhere. About the sandwiches, I am a big fan of the pulled pork sandwich, I liked the chicken sandwich but felt it was missing something. Maybe the seasoning could be more asian inspired? I just felt like it was too plain of a chicken sandwich.The bathroom smells good, sometimes it's a little overpowering if you sit too close to it but there's a nice little window sill to leave your belongings so you needn't worry about having to ask a neighbour to watch your stuff.Overall, i'm really sad to move out of this neighbourhood because I won't get to come here as often.

Visiting Brooklyn from LA! I visited at least five different coffee shops around BK and NY proper and was on a mission for a really great iced mocha (which is my fave drink) some were straight forward SBKs imitations but I mean MP tho!! OMG their iced coffee was made from REAL CHOCOLATE from the HAND OF GOD!! It blew me away haha. Also the shop offers sandwiches but they were out of them due to high demand i guess! But next time I come visit i would wanna try their AVOCADO TOAST!!!,5.0

Cute little place in Williamsburg!  People were friendly. Espresso was well made and latte was both beautiful and delicious!  Also had pineapple scone which was yummy (although not as mind blowing as some of the other reviews described) and coconut pastry which was tasty and unique.

"This is my second review ever, which is nerve racking and exciting at the same time.

Probably tonight or tomorrow morning.",5.0
"First time here - I will be back. It was their two-year anniversary & the owners gave everyone in the place a free lunch of grilled chicken, salad & a tasty spring roll wrap. What a gem! I will always return for customer service like this.Cafe au lait with soy milk for $2.25? That is quite reasonable for Williamsburg. This spot is on the South Side, making it much more tolerable than crowded, North Side spots. A great place to do work or just chill! Nice jazzy music selection, and not too loud.The decor makes you feel like you're sitting in someone's Midwestern kitchen circa 1970. Adorable. They have a nice assortment of pastries too. Thanks, Mountain Province!",5.0
"I visited last week when I was meeting friends in Brooklyn and the high ratings on yelp are certainly warranted. It's a cozy, charming spot with friendly owners who are clearly passionate about their work and care about their customers. The drinks are delicious and the food is outstanding (and made on premises). With a Starbucks on every corner, it's easy to overlook smaller coffee shops, but you do so to your own detriment. Mountain Province is a neighborhood gem and I look forward to many happy returns.",5.0

"My parents are in town and we visited Mountain Province, a small hole in the wall cafe. First off, amazing coffee (and reasonably priced too - cuppaccino was only $3). They also serve a variety of yummy pastries and baked goods with a touch of Filipino influence - tapioca cake and pineapple scones yum! Will be back",5.0
"I am not at all surprised to see the 5 star rating on this place!! It just happened to be on the end of the street shared by our airbnb, and what a perfect spot.There is ample seating, free wifi and delicious drinks and food - what more could I ask for? How about friendly and welcoming service? Ok! I am annoyed about one thing, and that is that I didn't go until my last day. If I had gone right away I would have come back every day for an iced latte. I also am desperate to try some baked goods, they all looks unbelievable but I had just devoured a cupcake (poor planning).",5.0
"The homemade coconut cassava cake is outstanding!I just noticed this place today, popped in for some hot tea ( good selection), and was instantly swayed by the delicious-looking cake, which was every bit as yummy as it looked. Seems to be a father-son team behind the counter, maybe. In any case, they are very friendly and rightfully proud of their food.The shop is very cute and homey, and the prices are great. I will definitely be back!",5.0
Coffee's good but the guy that usually stands behind the counter in the morning is a little too arrogant. i love getting my coffee in the morning and getting treated like a human being - this guys aura makes you want to go back to bed.,1.0

"This place is a Brooklyn gem! My girlfriend and I live in the Philippines part time, so we were lured in by the name. For a Brooklyn cafe it gets major points for being surprisingly cool and having ample seating. It was surprisingly relaxed for a weekend morning, free from the craziness of many area coffee shops I have frequented. Surprisingly, they serve roasts from the Philippines, which were awesome--and better than the roasts I sometimes find in Manila! The owner was also very friendly. If I still lived in Brooklyn, I would gladly make this a home base.",5.0
"I can't help but add my recommendation to this happy heap.

In-house. Every morning. And I'm not talking about slapdash croissants. He's whipping up banana-cinnamon donuts with Mast Brothers chocolate, brioche with taro and pineapple scones that may cure you of the common cold and all other ails.- It's beyond adorable.

"There is one reason above all the others that makes this place stand out. Ray knows how to make a good coffee. He really does. In particular I would point to two critical factors:1.

While their baristas may look and talk the part, they often don't really know the difference between lattes, cappuccinos, cortados, flat whites and macchiatos. Many simply just produce a slightly frothy milky coffee and call it whatever name you want to hear. There is a difference. Ray understands that and knows what to do.2. He keeps his machine clean. Another big mistake that many cafes here in Brooklyn seem to make. Neglecting to keep the machine clean will inevitably degrade the quality of the finished product. This is far more important that what beans you use. Even if you have some kick ass single origin with interesting tasting notes, it's just going to taste like any other boring old brew if the machine is not clean. If you want to go beyond choosing coffee on the basis of image and rhetoric then I suggest you give Mountain Province a try.",5.0

"***The address is wrong, it is on Meserole St next door to Mango***This is the most affordable AND most exotic coffee experience you can get in Williamsburg - maybe in all of Brooklyn. Single origin, fair-trade... exclusively filipino coffee. That goes for the espresso as well, of which I was wary at first - usually a robust, carefully crafted blend takes the cake for me, but this is fantastic, bright, flavorful espresso that may blow your mind. Made on a brand new, top-of-the-line espresso machine. I'll drink coffee here over Third Rail any day, and for a fraction of the price.Speaking of cake, Ray, the owner and sole barista at this homey shop, prepares baked goods based on his grandmother's recipes, and they are absolutely incredible. $1.25 for three small brownies with a cashew in each? Yes please. A scone for $1.50... literally, there is no other shop in this town that can compete. The food and drinks are better and cheaper than anywhere else by a long shot. Oh, and the hot chocolate is literally melted dark chocolate, not too sweet, with perfectly steamed milk.Even the regular coffee - a strong, smokey, almost beef jerky flavor unlike any fine specialty coffee I've experienced - is unbelievable and is $1.50. Cozy, friendly atmosphere, and FREE CANDY at the door! Halloween all year! I'm moving in!",5.0

"FIVE STARS FOR BRIGHT YELLOW WALLPAPER WITH PALM TREES ON THE WALLS.I'm pretty sure this is the wallpaper in my grandparents' kitchen in San Diego, which they put up in I think 1987 or so.

Wow they even have neat technology like they put my credit card in an iPad, even if I just want a $1.50 coffee or a $1.50 cupcake with that sweet gooey coconut topping that tastes real good.  I ate a cappucino too because I forgot what it's like to use credit, endless money basically, and it tasted good too.

The coffee is fantastic (single origin Filipino beans), the prices are actually a bit cheaper than comparable Williamsburg spots ($3 for a cappuccino), the place itself is clean, well-lit, and perfect for reading (the owner plays ethereal indie pop at reasonable volumes) or working (free and reliable wifi), and the staff is warm and attentive (he even comped me a coconut muffin, and has plans for a fuller Filipino-inspired lunch menu soon). One important detail: Despite the address on Yelp, the entrance is actually on Meserole, just east of Union.

"it seems like every review here has given mountain province 5 stars, so i feel bad (just a tiny, tiny bit) breaking the trend. mountain province has a ton of seating, and a good number of outlets if you're looking for somewhere to do work. however, the coffee was average, lacking that thick, smoky flavor, and the pineapple scone i got wasn't that good. still, because it seems like every coffee shop in brooklyn is perpetually packed, the fact that mountain province was mostly empty and seems to be a largely undiscovered gem (it's also slightly out of the way of downtown williamsburg) makes it worth a second visit, and many more.",4.0

"This place has the best coffee in the neighborhood. Plus, the owner, Ray, is super nice and friendly. Love the special homemade treats, the yellow, the bathroom, the antique mixed chairs with some modern tables....tell two friends, then those two friends will tell two friends, and so on, and so on.  Oh, and they have what is affectionately known by true aficionados of caffeine as ""cat poop"" coffee!!!  The beans Ray uses are harvested from the excrement of free-roaming civets. Mmm, good to the last dropping!",5.0
"***The address is wrong, it is on Meserole St next door to Mango***This is the most affordable AND most exotic coffee experience you can get in Williamsburg - maybe in all of Brooklyn. Single origin, fair-trade... exclusively filipino coffee. That goes for the espresso as well, of which I was wary at first - usually a robust, carefully crafted blend takes the cake for me, but this is fantastic, bright, flavorful espresso that may blow your mind. Made on a brand new, top-of-the-line espresso machine. I'll drink coffee here over Third Rail any day, and for a fraction of the price.Speaking of cake, Ray, the owner and sole barista at this homey shop, prepares baked goods based on his grandmother's recipes, and they are absolutely incredible. $1.25 for three small brownies with a cashew in each? Yes please. A scone for $1.50... literally, there is no other shop in this town that can compete. The food and drinks are better and cheaper than anywhere else by a long shot. Oh, and the hot chocolate is literally melted dark chocolate, not too sweet, with perfectly steamed milk.Even the regular coffee - a strong, smokey, almost beef jerky flavor unlike any fine specialty coffee I've experienced - is unbelievable and is $1.50. Cozy, friendly atmosphere, and FREE CANDY at the door! Halloween all year! I'm moving in!",5.0
"A really wonderful and quaint coffee shop with good iced coffee, fast wifi, and pleasant staff. Perfect and quiet for work/study.",5.0
"FIVE STARS FOR BRIGHT YELLOW WALLPAPER WITH PALM TREES ON THE WALLS.I'm pretty sure this is the wallpaper in my grandparents' kitchen in San Diego, which they put up in I think 1987 or so. I was recently lead to believe that I must drink coffee and do work by candlelight or dim Edison bulbs.... and listening to loud '90s R&B, which... OK, but.... hrm. Wow they even have neat technology like they put my credit card in an iPad, even if I just want a $1.50 coffee or a $1.50 cupcake with that sweet gooey coconut topping that tastes real good.  I ate a cappucino too because I forgot what it's like to use credit, endless money basically, and it tasted good too. (‿)The owner is nice and cute and Filipino, hence the name ""Mountain Province"", and we are gonna be FRIENDS someday, like Jake and Finn!  | (* *) | ()",5.0
"This is absolutely the best coffee shop in the entire Williamsburg area. I have tried a variety of drinks from across the menu, all of which have been well above average and most of which have been near-perfect. The ambiance is warm and welcoming, and the staff are some of the sweetest, friendliest folks in town.",5.0
"I've been waiting years for a good cafe to open this close to Broadway. The coffee is fantastic (single origin Filipino beans), the prices are actually a bit cheaper than comparable Williamsburg spots ($3 for a cappuccino), the place itself is clean, well-lit, and perfect for reading (the owner plays ethereal indie pop at reasonable volumes) or working (free and reliable wifi), and the staff is warm and attentive (he even comped me a coconut muffin, and has plans for a fuller Filipino-inspired lunch menu soon). One important detail: Despite the address on Yelp, the entrance is actually on Meserole, just east of Union.

Saw the rare 5 star average and had to see it for myself! It lived up to the billing. The desserts are unique and absolutely amazing. My favorites are the coconut muffin and the taro brioche! The staff is so sweet. You can tell that they take pride in their coffee shop. I HIGHLY recommend this place.,5.0
"Came here with my sister today on a Sunday afternoon and stayed until 5 PM. She ordered an almond latte (which is not on the menu, but she asked for it and they said sure!) and I ordered a chai latte, as well as the bite-sized brownies. I was a bit skeptical that this place could get 5 stars so we checked it out and we're really glad we did! The lattes were good and the brownies weren't too sweet and had nuts on top for some crunch. They went well with the lattes. We both want to go back again soon to try their other drinks and pastries.I have to say, this place is extremely easy to miss if you're not looking for it. It's very homey on the inside, with coat racks, cute wallpaper, and a great music playlist. We got a lot of work done and the staff is incredibly sweet. They do not rush you at all (even though we stayed for about 3 hours) and even asked us if we wanted some water while we were working. The people who work there all look related and they look like they have a lot of fun working together, which is really cute. All in all, great staff, great drinks, great atmosphere. And free wifi! We will be back again soon!",5.0
"i once tweeted ""if you're a yelper please stab yourself."" i get the irony of tweeting about annoying yelpers. point is i never thought i'd yelp, mostly because so many yelpers are just terrible. this isn't an opinion, it's a fact backed up by hundreds of thousands of idiotic, poorly written ""reviews."" maybe it's the caffeine high, but here I am yelping. I drink coffee because it's there, I'm tired, and I no longer snort shit through my nose. I went to mountain province and ordered a medium cup of coffee, black. honestly that was the best effing coffee I've ever had in my life.

this place is adorable and everyone is so nice!  I have to give another shout out for the cakes...they had a gluten free yucca flour cake today that was steamed (I believe) with this glaze...this was one of the best sweets i've put in my mouth in recent memory...incredible.  It is all so understated there...i wasn't going to order because it looked sort of anemic and weird....i'm so glad i bought.,5.0
