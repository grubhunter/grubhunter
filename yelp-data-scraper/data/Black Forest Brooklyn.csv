"A great neighborhood German spot that is spacious and low-key. During the day you can find many people hanging out with friends or working on their laptops. They are family-friendly and have been very accommodating when I bring my baby. Service is friendly, food arrives quickly, and the ambiance is relaxed and enjoyable. I like how they take your order and settle your bill with tablets, makes it very easy to split the check and it's eco-friendly without numerous paper receipts. I've had the original flammkuchen and the pork schnitzel and both were delicious. I look forward to hanging out and dining here again!",5.0
"Review is for a weekday lunchFirst of all, the ""lunch special"" is a LIE - there is no free dessert with this. Multiple individuals around me ordering the lunch special at the bar did not receive desserts either, and I did not get one. So why even list it as being part of the (3) lunch special options? Basically this Wurst ""lunch special"" is the same as their regular all-day menu sandwich, so don't even bother looking at the lunch specials. Since, this isn't one.I just got back from eating lunch here and had to write this review right away. The dessert/lunch special thing just made me annoyed.The bartender was super duper awkward.Although 4-5 German sausages are listed on the menu, there were only 2 available (I was never told why). I got the lange rote bratwurst (pork, veal and beef sausage) which tasted like a hot dog. The wurst came on a bun with nothing else on it. As a side there was sour kraut which had no taste, fries that were overdone, ketchup and mustard.I work a few minutes away from here and was excited to potentially find a lunch spot but now I'm really meh about this place.On the lunch special (WHICH DOES NOT EXIST IN REALITY) menu there is a jerk chicken sandwich listed, which sounds good... but not sure if I'll even return to try it.",2.0
"Opentable res for 12 made with my card and all. Upon arrival, we were ""reserved"" the horseshoe area by the window, but we picked a bench by the wall instead. We came to eat AND drink. Luckily it was a windy Monday night. The waiter immediately greeted us with carafes of water and (votive) glasses?  Ordering happens on a tablet which was pretty spot on for us. We started with some pretzels which were just ok to me but the two different mustards (spicy and not) were unique.  The beer battered mushrooms with aioli - get them!  The flatbread, although they only had gluten free dough, none of us could tell the diff. The mushroom and vegetarian ones are both delish!  Got the spätzle (pasta) without bacon which prob made it a little less flavorful but the texture was still comforting as always. Never had it ribbon like before, just had it bite size. You couldn't really taste the cheese.  Sparkling apple juice was good, not too sweet. Everyone else enjoyed their beers and wine. Service was attentive and quick!",4.0
"Very comforting atmosphere, both through decor, lighting, and excellent choice of music ( which isn't too loud). This establishment of course has a great selection of alcohol, especially beer and of course not to mention excellent German food. Staff is friendly and attentive. My friend ordered the grapefruit flavored beer which I tried and was delicious. I don't really drink beer too often but I definitely would have ordered that! However, I ordered a hot totty which was very good- soothing and sweet with a slight kick.  We shared a pretzel ( smaller size) which came out hot, perfectly doughy and delicious! The mustard had a great spicy flavor as well. I was happy my friend decided to share this gem with me!",4.0
The food here is pretty good. The staff is friendly. But the service is just horrible. Coming here for sausage and a salad means you're going to be here for over an hour on your lunch break. I really hope they pull it together in terms of their issues with timing.,2.0
"My buddy was in Germany and he saw a program on TV about German food in America. And Black Forest was one of the places that they discussed and now he wanted to go. So we did.And the food, it's decent. The Flammkuchen is basically German pizza. Flatbread, cut into pieces and easily share-able. The one we got had salmon and dill. It was pretty good. Would order again. The goulash w/ Spaetzel was kind of lacking. I don't know if they par-cook the spaetzel or what, but it wasn't great. I also personally prefer them in smaller pieces, these were kind of like noodles.The meat in the goulash was on the tough side, but on the other hand, the sauce was pretty good. I had a bite of the fish schnitzel too, and it was pretty mediocre.The beer list is good though. They do a barrel-aged old fashioned that was delicious if a bit sweet. And the beer that they have that's a cross between an American style IPA and a German beer was really good.So maybe this is a place for drinks and snacks. I'd go back for that.",4.0
"I have been a regular at Black Forest since it opened and have recommended it to countless friends and acquaintances. Never again.I'm not sure if management recently changed, but in the past 2 weeks I have had three separate experiences that have convinced me to never go back, despite the fact that it is literally around the corner from my apartment.After the previous two trips (slow service, received the wrong drinks, etc.) I decided to give Black Forest another chance and went with a friend. We arrived shortly after 5pm and all of the outdoor tables were full, but they were able to squeeze the two of us in at the end of the picnic tables.We were chatting and catching up and barely noticed that no one had so much as brought us a water until over twenty minutes later, when the couple next to us was getting their check and mentioned to their server that we were separate parties and someone should take our order. The server promised to send someone and disappeared for at least another ten or so minutes. When she came back out the couple reminded her about us a second time and she again promised someone would be right out. We weren't very bothered at this point and chalked it up to the restaurant being busy.Eventually someone came out to take our drink order and we put in our food order as well. The couple next to us left and a new group sat down. Our beers came out probably 40 minutes after we sat down and we noted how long it had taken but figured our food would be right out.We proceeded to wait. And wait. And wait. No one came by to give us an update or ask if we wanted another beer and we were trapped at the end of the table against the barricades and didn't want to disturb the other group by climbing over them.At about 6:30 we noticed that despite arriving well after us the group next to us had already gotten their food. We decided to go find out where ours was, but as we were figuring out how to climb over the group next to us, a server came running out and announced that the group next to us had somehow received our order and started eating it without noticing. I started to ask for the check, but she assured us that our food would be right out.At 6:45 our food arrived and we dug into...stone cold french fries. Our server had disappeared without asking if we needed anything else and at this point, after having arrived hungry and waiting nearly AN HOUR AND 45 MINUTES from sitting down at the table to receiving our bratwursts and fries, we were hungry enough to eat anything so we shrugged and started eating.We lingered over our meal as long as we could, waiting for someone to come by to check on us or bring the check, and finally one of our two servers appeared. I asked for the check and politely stated that we waited an hour and 45 minutes to receive our food and that the entire meal had been a problem. I got a brusque, ""I know, sorry"" without any eye contact and she hurried off, never to return.After nearly 20 minutes, I got fed up and went inside the restaurant and stood at the bar, looking for anyone who might help me get the check. I was completely ignored for five minutes, to the point where some of the patrons at the bar asked if they could do anything to help. At that moment, I saw our other server and made a beeline for her, explaining we had asked the other server for our check more than 20 minutes prior. She apologized and pulled up our check on her tablet for me to swipe my card. Full price.Again, I politely explained that we had now been at the restaurant sitting outside in what had been a warm, sunny day but was now in the 40s and freezing for over two hours while watching other people eat our food and asked if there was anything she could do. She said she would go talk to her manager and returned several minutes later saying that she tried, but ""he would only take off one beer.""We had fully intended to pay for our meal, as horrific as it was, but I was done. I asked to see the manager and was again treated to a long wait. He eventually came out with a visible attitude and made me repeat the entire saga. He looked at me stone-faced when I finished and I explained that while we had every intention of paying for our meal, we needed some acknowledgement of how much had gone wrong and we felt that one of our two beers was almost offensive. The manager became extremely sarcastic and asked what would make us happy, implying what was done was done. I asked what he thought was appropriate and he brushed off the question, becoming more aggressive. ""If I gave you your entire meal, would that make you happy?"" At this point, I was becoming very uncomfortable and I said that if he felt that was appropriate that was fine, but we were happy to pay for our drinks. He repeated, more aggressively this time, ""If I gave you your entire meal, would that make you happy?"" Totally freaked out at this point, I said, ""Yep, have a good night!"" and left.Never. Again.",1.0

"Coming to New York for New Years, Black Forest was my first choice for dinner. With it being my favorite restaurant in Brooklyn and all. But I have to admit I was kind of disappointed this time. The portion size changed so much. I ordered the goulash and they used to give you so much. It was still pretty good (not as good as last time)  I wonder if they changed cooks..... Service was good, and ambiance is great. Price to portion was off. Overall I'd still recommend coming here.",3.0
"Service is number one here and I really appreciate that.Food is a very close second with authentic dishes and portions.Bratwurst is great with stringy crisp fries, sauerkraut, mustard, and ketchup.My only recommendation would be to get some curry ketchup!I'd return regardless.Bummer that the only garden area of this bier garten is the sidewalk dining.All and all, a lovely place to dine with very good service which deserves a higher than usual rating of 4 stars.",4.0
I chose to go there for my birthday. A very rude man did not allow us to get seated. There was an open table. The rest of the place was full. He mumbled something inaudibly and dismissively walked away. So we approached the bartender and other person working there who told us it was absolutely fine to be seated. The cleaning man came back and rudely told us to get up. Very unpleasant and inappropriate. What a way to put a damper on my birthday.We walked out.Recommending training for customer service.,1.0

They were very good and the whole place was very fun. Owners are great people and very kind.Great selection of beer and I try different food every time I go. All good!,5.0
"Worst experience ever. The food was okay, but the service!!!! Went to have lunch today, maybe 4 tables were set. An annoyed unpleasant waitress served the shift.

Needless to say I'm never coming back. Would not recommend at all!",1.0
"If you like German beers, they have a pretty solid selection of about 15 beers on tap. I had an Hofbräu Dunkel, followed by a Schneider Aventinus. They also serve Rothaus Tannenzäpfle, the only unpasteurized German beer available in the US. Drinks are not cheap, though: $8-10 for 0.5L.Food is actually more affordable. The Beer-battered, fried champignon mushrooms & aioli ($7) is a tasty starter, perfect for sharing. The Bauernmädchen ($13) is a tasty flatbread with sour cream, shredded spicy citrus kale, roasted pumpkin, cauliflower & toasted almonds. Kässpätzle ($14) are homemade German egg noodles with smoked slab bacon, shredded  Emmentaler cheese, fresh nutmeg, sauteed onions & house salad[1].As far as wurst, my Lange Rote Bratwurst ($9; spicy pork, beef & veal sausage) was a bit disappointing: pretty bland, and not spicy at all.

"This place is about the beer and atmosphere. Generally a good crowd but the staff gets a little overwhelmed if you come primetime (say, 10p Saturday). Really wanted to love the food but unfortunately not so - the snacks are great (pretzel, meat plate) but I wasn't fond of the entree options. Most notable was the spätzle which was seasoned with butter and that's it - yes I know its supposed to be a 'mop' like a side of bread, but even fresh bread by itself is pretty darn good, right? This spätzle was a bit one note (butter) when eaten alone. The beers are still outstanding.",3.0
"As we traversed around Brooklyn we wanted to find a beer garden to post up and have a large beer to help enjoy a hot Saturday afternoon. We popped into Black Forest Brooklyn and although there isn't much outdoor seating, the oversized skylights helped make the bar feel very open with the added benefit of air conditioning! Though the beer was quite tasty and the selection numerous, the wait staff was almost impossible to flag down and was very cold when we asked questions and placed our order.... Not to mention the beer was pretty expensive! Maybe I'm used to DC prices? (hah who am I kidding DC is still bad!)I think  I was a bit caught off guard at how many families their were at the establishment also. Lots of babies! That is in NO way a reason for my 3 star review, but I don't think I was ready for how family friendly the establishment was when I was drinking a liter of beer... If you are desperately wanting some good German beer and a place to post up with the fam, this is an excellent spot.

"You know, I rarely find myself trying out a new spot, liking it THAT much and itching to return as soon as possible. So as you can tell, I had a really fantastic experience at Black Forest Brooklyn and can't wait to go back. When you combine tons of craft brews, excellent pub style food and a really bright, warm atmosphere... what's not to love?This place is huge! BFB is somewhat divided into two sides. One side consists of the large picnic tables which are perfect for after-work happy hours, parties or just really large groups. It has that communal, casual feel which makes for a great space for socializing. On the other side are the smaller tables of 2 or 4, as well as the bar (with ample seating). The inside is BEAUTIFULLY decorated- antique German clocks, artwork, high ceilings with vintage bulbs. We arrived about 6pm and got a seat right away despite there being a decent crowd.The first thing I noticed: the vast selection of German beers. Aside from, Weihenstephan Hefe Weissbier, my knowledge of German brands are limited. Our waitress was extremely helpful and let me taste a few. Ultimately I settled on the Riegele Kellerbier which was smooth, light... and one of my new favorites. I think it's pretty safe to say if you're going to a bier garden or German eatery, you must order a warm pretzel. Their Riesenbrezel was not only bigger than my head, but delicious. It has just enough crisp on the outside, soft/dough-y on the inside and with the perfect amount of salt. Wonderful for sharing! For dinner, I ordered the Bratwurst which came with a warm kaiser bun, apple cider sauerkraut and shoestring fries. I loved it. To be honest, I'm not the biggest fan of sauerkraut, but it just worked wonderfully with the German sausage. All in all, my meal was spot on and I happily ate the entire thing. (No regrets.)It's safe to say I will 100% be back. Possibly next week even. We had a pleasant experience with the staff and the food exceeded all my expectations. PROST!",5.0

Super yummy! Great service. Great drinks.. You will likely only be able to pronounce 1/3 of the menu but everything we tried was good. Daniel was our server. He was very attentive and gave great suggestions. The Camembert Pit (insert German word here) salad was amazing!  I will be back.,5.0
"Great location as a lot is happening on n this block, and is near BAM. This is a German Biergarten. There are plenty of options on draft, but beware the smallest glass will be half a liter. Very open layout with just the right rustic touch with half the space holding wooden picnic tables standing under two large skylights, and the remainder with newer country 2-3 person square blonde wood tables accompanied by spring green wooden chairs matching in color some wainscoting and fireplace mantle. The same blonde wood creates the tall stools at the bar. Most of the walls are open brick, which is common in BK, yet always appreciated by myself. Likewise to the ubiquitous ""Edison"" style filament anti-energy-efficient light bulbs. Like any respectable beer place, they readily offer you shot-glass tastes of various beers before commitment to order. I love IPAs, and just because I did not find a similar brew to my current taste did not stop me from this 5 star review. I can appreciate that they have many colorful(and sometimes rare) alcohol options, and I settled on their darkest beer, the Köstritzer Schearzbier which satisfied my thirst thoroughly with its tasty black character. Music was a medium loud of various popular eclectic cool, hip, retro or unusual sounds. I think if they wanted to sing ""traditional"" German song fare to the local BK ear, no one would have come, and this place would not have been as crowded as it was this Saturday night. Service was friendly. They sell organic German delicacies and apparently coffee and cake, which I cannot comment because I did not partake in those options.",5.0
"Great service, delicious and filling food, and excellent beer. I had the Nurnberger and my cousin had the Flammkuchen. Both were terrific. The interior is cozy but big at the same time.

"I finally had a chance to try their draft beers and food. Food was great, I really enjoyed their crisp and buttery flatbread pizzas covered in caramelized onions, toasty mushrooms and cheese, their warm, soft, salty pretzels and fried mushrooms with a creamy tangy aioli. I wasnt too fond of their beer options, I was really excited when I ordered their beer flight which includes 15 beer samples, but I was completely underwhelmed. I liked 1 (grapefruit flavored) out of the 15 beers but that 1 beer was good enough for me to return. I will definitely be back for a glass (ok probably a boot) of their Schöfferhofer Grapefruit beer and will definitely try the rest of their menu, oh and some Riesling too.",3.0
"Good beer and delicious food, can't go wrong. The flat bread is really crunchy / thin and the bacon and onion were a good combo.  We also got the regular sasausage which tasted bland but comes with fries.  The potato pancake was also bland but salad that came with it was very fresh. Grapefruit beer!  Have to get it!!!",4.0
"This place is about the beer and atmosphere. Generally a good crowd but the staff gets a little overwhelmed if you come primetime (say, 10p Saturday). Really wanted to love the food but unfortunately not so - the snacks are great (pretzel, meat plate) but I wasn't fond of the entree options. Most notable was the spätzle which was seasoned with butter and that's it - yes I know its supposed to be a 'mop' like a side of bread, but even fresh bread by itself is pretty darn good, right? This spätzle was a bit one note (butter) when eaten alone. The beers are still outstanding.",3.0
"As we traversed around Brooklyn we wanted to find a beer garden to post up and have a large beer to help enjoy a hot Saturday afternoon. We popped into Black Forest Brooklyn and although there isn't much outdoor seating, the oversized skylights helped make the bar feel very open with the added benefit of air conditioning! Though the beer was quite tasty and the selection numerous, the wait staff was almost impossible to flag down and was very cold when we asked questions and placed our order.... Not to mention the beer was pretty expensive! Maybe I'm used to DC prices? (hah who am I kidding DC is still bad!)I think  I was a bit caught off guard at how many families their were at the establishment also. Lots of babies! That is in NO way a reason for my 3 star review, but I don't think I was ready for how family friendly the establishment was when I was drinking a liter of beer... If you are desperately wanting some good German beer and a place to post up with the fam, this is an excellent spot. However, if you want a more rowdy and young crowd I would suggest making the trek to Radegast!",3.0
"You know, I rarely find myself trying out a new spot, liking it THAT much and itching to return as soon as possible. So as you can tell, I had a really fantastic experience at Black Forest Brooklyn and can't wait to go back. When you combine tons of craft brews, excellent pub style food and a really bright, warm atmosphere... what's not to love?This place is huge! BFB is somewhat divided into two sides. One side consists of the large picnic tables which are perfect for after-work happy hours, parties or just really large groups. It has that communal, casual feel which makes for a great space for socializing. On the other side are the smaller tables of 2 or 4, as well as the bar (with ample seating). The inside is BEAUTIFULLY decorated- antique German clocks, artwork, high ceilings with vintage bulbs. We arrived about 6pm and got a seat right away despite there being a decent crowd.The first thing I noticed: the vast selection of German beers. Aside from, Weihenstephan Hefe Weissbier, my knowledge of German brands are limited. Our waitress was extremely helpful and let me taste a few. Ultimately I settled on the Riegele Kellerbier which was smooth, light... and one of my new favorites. I think it's pretty safe to say if you're going to a bier garden or German eatery, you must order a warm pretzel. Their Riesenbrezel was not only bigger than my head, but delicious. It has just enough crisp on the outside, soft/dough-y on the inside and with the perfect amount of salt. Wonderful for sharing! For dinner, I ordered the Bratwurst which came with a warm kaiser bun, apple cider sauerkraut and shoestring fries. I loved it. To be honest, I'm not the biggest fan of sauerkraut, but it just worked wonderfully with the German sausage. All in all, my meal was spot on and I happily ate the entire thing. (No regrets.)It's safe to say I will 100% be back. Possibly next week even. We had a pleasant experience with the staff and the food exceeded all my expectations. PROST!",5.0
"I have no idea why this place has such low ratings. The service is super nice, the beers are great, and the food is delicious. I tried my husband's brat and it was very well done. The atmosphere is wonderful and they even have a big projector screen which is currently playing the U.S. Open.",5.0
"We were a couple sitting on the bar.Bar tenders were both nice and service was good.We weren't that hungry so we took the roasted beets salad with the goat cheese and lettuce.I must say it was quite simple, maybe too simple and not so appealing..The lettuce looked kinda ragged also..Overall, it felt like the salad was not adequate to such place.",4.0
Super yummy! Great service. Great drinks.. You will likely only be able to pronounce 1/3 of the menu but everything we tried was good. Daniel was our server. He was very attentive and gave great suggestions. The Camembert Pit (insert German word here) salad was amazing!  I will be back.,5.0
"Great location as a lot is happening on n this block, and is near BAM. This is a German Biergarten. There are plenty of options on draft, but beware the smallest glass will be half a liter. Very open layout with just the right rustic touch with half the space holding wooden picnic tables standing under two large skylights, and the remainder with newer country 2-3 person square blonde wood tables accompanied by spring green wooden chairs matching in color some wainscoting and fireplace mantle. The same blonde wood creates the tall stools at the bar. Most of the walls are open brick, which is common in BK, yet always appreciated by myself. Likewise to the ubiquitous ""Edison"" style filament anti-energy-efficient light bulbs. Like any respectable beer place, they readily offer you shot-glass tastes of various beers before commitment to order. I love IPAs, and just because I did not find a similar brew to my current taste did not stop me from this 5 star review. I can appreciate that they have many colorful(and sometimes rare) alcohol options, and I settled on their darkest beer, the Köstritzer Schearzbier which satisfied my thirst thoroughly with its tasty black character. Music was a medium loud of various popular eclectic cool, hip, retro or unusual sounds. I think if they wanted to sing ""traditional"" German song fare to the local BK ear, no one would have come, and this place would not have been as crowded as it was this Saturday night. Service was friendly. They sell organic German delicacies and apparently coffee and cake, which I cannot comment because I did not partake in those options.",5.0

The preserves were really good. Lapin got Flammkuchen, which is a flatbread  with sour cream and bacon. Lapin  really enjoyed it and it was a very big portion for the price. Lapin also ordered this German Orange juice beverage which he enjoyed. The food was good but I think I might try their lunch or dinner option the next time.

"Newer is not not always better. Black Forrest is the newer German Beer Hall (these are not Beer Gardens, people) in Fort Greene. It's about a year old and while I don't think it's bad, I don't see why I would come here. The original German Beer Hall in Fort Greene is only a block and a half down. The prices are cheaper, the food is better, and it's more authentic. Black Forrest seems like some commercial, money making, image, of a beer hall. As I mentioned the beer is more expensive, which would grant the owner more money. They offer more food options, but you must purchase most of them with sides. Like fries. Thus justifying why they jack up the prices. I'm sorry, I do not want their skinny burnt fries. After eating a brat from the place, my stomach was in knots. Not the best quality that I've had. The place doesn't even feel like a beer hall. I wouldn't know I was in one if someone blindfolded me and brought me in. In the end, it's not awful, but the original one is just that much better. I could only see myself coming here if the other was shut down or too packed.",3.0

I was with a rather large party so when he did finally come by, he would shout over us: DOES ANYONE NEED ANYTHING ELSE BEFORE I WALK AWAYYYYY!!!!????? Super rude and obnoxious.I had the apple crumble cake which was really just some ""artisanal"" apple pie and coffee that had a bitter/sour taste. Meh.

"I'm going to tell you a secret (which I probably shouldn't - because I want to keep it to myself): Black Forest Brooklyn is one of the *only* (or the only?) venue in NYC that has a license to carry Weihenstephan Kristallweizen beer! Why? I don't know - because you can buy it at Wegman's in Buffalo. Anyways, this Fort Greene beer garten is thriving because of the rustic/wood ambiance and the picnic-bench open seating, and REALLY good draft beers. PLUS, they have good food - WAY better than the beer garden down the street. Favorites:-Spicy Citrus Kale side (It is SOOOOO good, citrus-y and spicy.  However, lately, it has gone down in quality. Sometimes there is very little spice and/or citrus.  This is why I did not give the locale 5 stars.  If their kale was *always* on point - it would be 5 stars... the last 3 times that I have patronized the garten - the kale was not that good. Again, IF it is good - it's fabulous. - Flammkuchen Waldschrat: Try it. It's really good - truffled mushrooms, sour creams and onions on good quality pizza-type flat bread. VERY unexpectedly tasty. - Brezel - the small one or the large one.  Whatever they put in the dough is on point - and the horseradish from the mustard gets into your nose like wasabi. I love that!We saw the World Cup here when Germany won. It was door to door packed and when Germany won, the owners gave FREE BEER to the whole restaurant for an hour. The owners are really sweet, young, from the Black Forest - but met in Fort Greene... Overall GREAT place to hang out with a group or catch up with friends.",4.0

But the worst was my wife's order, the German brunch which was nothing like the description, no croissant, no sausages, no fruit salad and actually delivered 10 minutes after the other entrees...without the soft boilled egg delivered another 5 minutes later and was hard boiled.

So whenever I'm faced with a cold winter's night and I have an appetite the size of the Fernsehturm, German food is what I'm grabbing....Which is why when the temperature dipped below 30 degrees recently I rounded up some friends to fight the winter freeze with a hearty meal. We got here around 8 and it was pretty crowded, but were able to snag a table without waiting too long (it's seat yourself, which I think is GENIUS).Here's what we had and how I felt about it:Reisenbrezel: This giant pretzel is phenomenal.

"Braved the weather yesterday and decided to stop by this gem and check it out. I am nowhere near familiar with German beers and so I was curious. It was me and two other people, the place was almost empty (omg this place is HUGE), with the exception of 2-4 tables. Our bartenders were both Lee and Matt - they were fucking awesome (can I curse on YELP?) ! Their service was perfect, both were divided their time with us with great conversation and were very attentive. They introduced me to three different kinds of beer. The first one was the lightest beer on draft (which I cant pronounce to save my life or yours). The second one was a beer a darker beer that had hints of banana and raspberry. It was totally delicious. I normally don't go for dark beers but im glad I was converted in this moment. The third beer was the winner - a grapefruit, soda-tasting beer. I hate grapefruit, but the presence in this drink wasn't overwhelming and the other flavors helped.. It was very good. I would definitely return for sure!

"Do you like rare imported German beers? How about wurst, bretzles, or landjager? If you do (or have zero idea what the hell landjager is and want to find out), Black Forrest is the place for you. Hanging out on Fulton St in the amazing bar/restaurant triangle formed by the aforementioned, Lafayette and South Portland, this indoor Biergarten is guaranteed to make even the most discerning beer lover smile. They have one of the most authentic lineups I've seen in a while; ranging from standards like Hofbrau (5.1%abv) and Radeberger (4.8%abv), to the super authentic Weihenstephan Kristallweizen (5.4%abv - fun to drink, even more fun to say) and Schneider Aventinus (8.2%abv - careful here this one is easy to drink and WILL sneak up on you). Best part about all of this though? They take debit cards! No need to pull out 100$ for beer like at die stammkneipe up the street (I love that place, not knocking them -  just wish they would take a card). The authentic ambiance this place has going on cannot be overstated, you get the feeling that the owners are from a little town somewhere in the south of Germany (probably because both of them are). Walking in you will be greeted by one of my favorite looking bar tops in the city; it's simple, made of wood, and curved in a way that really highlights the crown jewel of this place - its tap lineup. In the front left corner adjacent to the bar, you will find an awesome corner nook complete with a fireplace - in the winter this is one of my favorite places to sit and have a beer in Brooklyn (if you can't find me and its December, this is probably where I am). The rest of the place is well lit, full of picnic style benches / tables, and has an overall authentic feel to it (the cuckoo clock collection on the wall is hysterical to me, not sure why).If you find yourself here while the sun is still up, or if you swing by on a weekend you'll find young families with kids in tow; Its cool to see such an authentic European vibe in the heart of Brooklyn. If it's warm enough, the outdoor seating is a perfect place to people watch and drink the day away. I haven't had too much off their food menu, but the bratwurst and original flammkuchen (sort of like German flat bread pizza) were very good, though a bit on the pricey side (authentic / specialty foods usually are in Brooklyn though).  They have Brunch (add 15$ to any entrée for two hour unlimited mimosas/beirmosas/Bloody Marys ), so this review is sure to get a food update soon. Absolutely worth checking out the next time you are in Fort Green -  stop by for a half (or full if you're like me) liter of authentic German beir, in an authentic Brooklyn Biergarten.",4.0

My friend was looking for a good place to have a beer and I have to say they have a large selection. Pilsner beer was the choice of the night it was lite and has a very good flavor. I had the Jagerschnitzel Mit Spatzle, it is a breaded veal cutlet with homemade German egg noodle and wild mushroom gravy. It had a very good taste. The portion was big I could not finish it all.

When my friend said, ""are those people waiting for the table""(referring to some women standing near it) the waiter told us in an annoyed and put upon tone that he didn't know. He then walked away. We finally sat down and after waiting over 10 mins., had to flag a waiter to order. Once the food came, our waiter didn't check on us once. In order to get the check I had to go to them service station and request it. I won't go back here due to the service issues.",2.0

"I was out on a date with a friend and we were looking for a place to eat before going into BAM. Black Forest was the perfect spot, a few blocks away from the theater. My friend was looking for a good place to have a beer and I have to say they have a large selection. Pilsner beer was the choice of the night it was lite and has a very good flavor. I had the Jagerschnitzel Mit Spatzle, it is a breaded veal cutlet with homemade German egg noodle and wild mushroom gravy. It had a very good taste. The portion was big I could not finish it all. The prices are reasonable. The place was very busy. We waited for a waiter but thereafter the food was served right away.",4.0
"The food was good- nice and fresh salads, good sausages, good beer selection. The reason I didn't give it more stars is because of the terrible service. When we got to the restaurant it was busy so we asked the waiter if we could sit somewhere. He seemed frazzled and suggested we sit at a table a couple of guys were about to leave. When my friend said, ""are those people waiting for the table""(referring to some women standing near it) the waiter told us in an annoyed and put upon tone that he didn't know. He then walked away. We finally sat down and after waiting over 10 mins., had to flag a waiter to order. Once the food came, our waiter didn't check on us once. In order to get the check I had to go to them service station and request it. I won't go back here due to the service issues.",2.0

"We came here for my cousin's birthday because she had wanted to try Black Forest for a very long time and was ecstatic to finally come. That night it was not busy when we arrived but none of the large tables were available for our group of 6. The waiter said a table would be opening soon almost an hour later but another group that showed up later sat themselves down and the waiter tried to get us to stay and eat in the waiting area on benches instead. When we reminded him we were here first, he said the other table has already sat down and he didn't want to ask them to move because he wanted to avoid a scene. I've never seen or heard of anything like this happen - usually employees are happy to stand up for their customers. And never have I witnessed a scene from asking a group to move if they weren't next in line. My only experience with both others being asked to move on our behalf and being asked to move is that people are happy to do so. The other party was not aware there was another party waiting - they were at the bar drinking - and it was the employee's job to manage everyone's wait. Unfortunately because of this experience my cousin's birthday was ruined and we ended up walking around the area to find dinner since we were all starving by the end of the wait and sadly, I can't review the food itself!",1.0

Tried to go to brunch on New Years day. Went to the place once before and had a great experience. This time was beyond dissapointing. Staff took about 15 min to acknowlege us to be seated mind you the place was not busy whatsoever. But ok its new years day evryone can be slugish. However that set the theme for the rest of the day becaue it took exactly 45 min to get two glasses of orange juice since we were seated and had to call over the waiter who was bringing the orange juices to the wrong table. Sadly enough three other tables were sat and orders taken with drinks on the table before we even got juice. Eventually they took our order and what a surprise i find a hair on my eggs when they finally arrived. Disgusted i returned the plate and asked for the check. What a way to start the new year.,1.0
"The first experience I had here was during the weekday.  I wandered in at 1:15PM looking for a quick lunch and a place to study comfortably while a friend of mine came over from work.  She was late, like normal, so I had set up shop with a few of my textbooks by the time she came.  We ended up ordering the Flammkuchen (a german style pizza) and a Bratwurst.  Our orders came out in a pretty timely manner and tasted quite good.  The flammkuchen was light and had a nice crunchy crust.  The grilled onions and bacon on it had good flavors, but the sour cream base started to solidfy in a kind of chalky way.  While the taste was good fresh, 20 minutes after having order the flammkuchen, the pizza definitely fell flat.  The bratwurst, as you would expect of a German place, was decent, hot, and came out american style (on a bun).  Resting on a bed of crispy french fries, the basket had and slots for small carafes of ketchup and whole grain mustard which were both delicious but didn't really appear homemade.  The sauerkraut that accompanied the dish was decent but had minimal pungency.Overall my first experience here would have been rated a 3 or a 4, but that was before I decided to drag T.H. here for brunch.On the second experience here, T.H. and I went in for a late brunch.  Having eaten here a few days earlier, I was eager to show him that there are decent and delicious brunch places nearby to our apartment.  Not to say that there aren't, but it is clear that Black Forest was built more for my weekday mid-afternoon study locale on that rare day that you get off early from work.  When we walked in, we were quite lucky as we were seated immediately midst the bustling lunch crowd.  Seated further into the restaurant, T.H. and I had a small two-seater table near the casually decorated beer barrel and in full view of both the kitchen door, the bar, and the server's station.  Against our better judgement, we both ended up ordering brunch specials, the Bratwurst gravy and biscuits for T.H. and the Black Forest Benedikt for myself. The Bratwurst Gravy and Biscuits, unfortunately came out slightly cold.  Willing to ignore this in favor of a potentially delicious bratwurst, T.H. dug in and found that not only was his dish slightly cold, the cheese they used remained partially unmelted, giving his dish a slightly chalky taste with a rubbery texture.  Upon further probing into his dish, he found that the biscuits, that were laid down in slider style with the bratwurst and eggs in between, were rock hard.  Not only were they rock hard, they practically bounced off the dish.  I snagged a bit of his biscuit later, as it was the only item left on his plate (he refused to eat them after a while) in hopes that I could soften it with the hollandaise sauce left on my plate and found that the biscuit was actually stale.  So no, we can't recommend this dish.  The bratwurst, from my previous experience here, is decent but it really doesn't get treated properly in this dish.The Black Forest Benedikt itself comes in three varieties.  One with ham, one with lox, and one with Kale.  It comes with a delicious side salad with a mustard vinegrette.  Unfortunately the salad was a tad better then the eggs benedict today.  The egg was cooked perfectly but the biscuit underneath, just like T.H.'s, was rock hard.  While it did soften slightly as the hollandase soaked into it's craggy pores, it was still pretty chewy and difficult to separate into bite sized pieces.  So if the food was overall okay but not extremely good, why did I rate this a 2?  The service wasn't great.  It took 15 minutes to get the check and we only managed to get the check after asking two of the servers and finally were approached by the manager of the establishment because we were looking irate.",2.0

"This place was a pleasant brunch spot surprise. I walked past it with my friend and that this menu looked great. I didn't try the beer or coffee but I will next time.I had the chicken Schnitzel a la Meyer and it was so filling and delicious. For 2 meals, we paid $30.The atmosphere is really nice and homey.

"Expansive inside, with big tables which was nice for our group.The flat breads they have (with a really long German name) are very good, especially the one with the pumpkin, kale and cauliflower.

"My band had a video showing here a couple of months back and I said I would Yelp this place but forgot. So when I found their business card and thought back to my experience that night, what came to mind was THE BEST DRINK I EVER HAD IN MY LIFE!!!!! I'm SOOOO not kidding! It was too long now for me to remember the name of this beautiful fruity concoction, but what I do remember is that whatever I was annoyed about was lost in this elixir FOR DA GAAAAAAWDS!!!!!! And the owner of the place was adorable and awesome as were the bartender and the servers. The place is like HUGE HUGE HUGE for NO REASON!!!!

"This is not an easy review to write, and not because I have one of those little beer headaches that feels like a bike helmet that's just a little too small for your skull.It's not easy to write this because this place, the venuuuuue, is amazing.

So, yes, the place, the space, is outstanding. Kudos to the designer and space-planner.The service, too, is quite charming. Friendly at the bar and friendly with table service, even when busy.

It just didn't taste fresh. Period. There's no more to say about the food. I will mention that my friends said, ""Oh, their brunch is good."" But I wasn't there for brunch, I didn't want brunch. I wanted a bunch of yummy bites for dinner.

"I'm in the neighborhood for brunch a lot and my friends and I have given Black Forest a shot several times. Most of the time, the service has been sub-par. While the wait staff is quite nice, they're usually too busy to properly take care of you. One time, the server spilled a full tray of mimosas on my friend -- a complete accident. All good but management only tried to give him a free dessert while he was wet from the spill and it all in his food. Talked with management and all it did was make a bad experience worse. It's a great space and would love to see it turn around! The best thing on the brunch menu was the biscuits and gravy. Last time was there, they said chef took it off the menu because it was not up to their culinary standards. Oh well...",2.0
"My rating is on based on the food. The very delicious food.....I am a firm believer that a German restaurant is only as good as its potato salad. Black Forest had a fantastic potato salad, tangy and cooled with soft potatoes and the occasional crunch of onion. Does this come with the option to add bacon?? Because that would be amazing, My husband order the goulash and I ordered the jagerschnitzel. Despite the restaurant  having running over Spaetzal, (which it was supposed to come with) and being substituted for mashed potatoes, we were both pleased with our tasty and enormous portions. The meat in the goulash was very tender and my veal cutlet was delicious. The mushroom gravy was amazing, and I asked for extra. Would it be strange if I drank the gravy out of the ramekin?The atmosphere was  a little lacking; it seems like this is a restaurant that has not found its personality yet, but I am not going to hold that against Black Forest. The servers were nice and attentive.The crowd seemed to be very very yuppy. The very loud, top 40s hits music playing left something to be desired. There were not enough people in the restaurant to have crappy teeny bopper music playing that loud. We almost chose to move on judging on that alone, but I am glad we toughed it out. I will definitely return; I am eager to get some potato dumplings in my mouth.  I'm very glad you were good, Black Forest.",4.0

The salad that comes along with it, is what a salad should be. The only cons of Black Forest is the self seating can be somewhat of a hassle and you having to flag down your server from time to time.

I get it you're closing and want to go home but some of your beers are rather big and making me and my friends chug while being shouted at from staff atop the bar and tables was unpleasant.

"We had brunch over the weekend and it was quite nice. We arrived at about 11:15 AM and it was relatively empty. A small lounge area, counter seats at the bar, counter seats in front of the windows, small four-seat tables and longer communal tables. I could tell upon entering it is kid friendly by the strollers that were inside the restaurant back by the second bar. We ordered cauliflower sweet potato flat break which was very nice. We also ordered the French toast and bratwurst with biscuits and gravy. All of the food was good and the service was pretty good considering there was only one waitress. However, with the next hour it became a madhouse. One couple asked if they could share the table and we said absolutely yes. Please take a seat. Well, the couple had their parents and kid so four adults and three kids slowly got pushed to the end of the table. Not cool. Then another group came over and basically circled our table as they waited for us to finish. They were quite polite, but it was not cool at all and most certainly uncomfortable.",3.0

"Decent food. Horrible wait staff. After we ordered our drinks the waitress, Gloria, disappeared. She was going to other tables but not ours for some reason. We asked the bus guys to get her and they assured us she was coming but never arrived. It was extremely disappointing but oh well.

Who serves schnitzel with shoestring fries??  And a house salad?

If you come in a crowd, definitely get the Grosse Wurstplatte, nice presentation with 7 kinds of sausages. Schnitzel was tender with fresh salad. Happy to have Black Forest in Fort Greene!",4.0
"Met up with some friends in the neighborhood on Saturday night.  BF  has great beer (duh, it's a German beer garden) and pretty good food.  The flatbread was different, but delicious.  We also had:Spatzel with bacon  - which was delicious and sticks to your bonesChicken sausage - nothing to write home about, but tasty. I don't really understand why there's another German place that has opened in general vicinity, but it's more casual than Berlyn, which has more of a sit-down-dining experience going on (on top of great cocktails), and more modern than Der Swartzkolner (which is a fun place to drink, but I find the waitstaff rude).",4.0
"This restaurant came recommended to me by a friend who said they serve a good steak... Unfortunately there wasn't such a meal on the menu.  On the bright side, they do serve some pretty fantastic traditional German food!  Pretty chill place to eat, and I'm sure I'll be back in the future.",4.0
"Always a good idea. The food and beers are delish and seemingly authentic, for a very reasonable price. The atmosphere is relaxed and peaceful. Go here on an afternoon when you're not in a rush. Its worth it. The spicy kale citrus kraut is awesome, but it's only a side. Their big soft pretzels are perfect for sharing. The flatbread is very good, and a lot of food for the price.",5.0

"Had a reservation here yesterday at 6p. When we arrived, it was clear they totally forgot/lost the reservation.

When we finally sat at our table, it took forever to place our order. When our food came, there were a couple mistakes but we were too famished to care. ANNNND my bf's food came ten minutes later than everyone else's - a single sausage on a bun with french fries. #itsnotthathardpeople When we got the bill (which ALSO took our waitress 20 minutes to get), they hadn't comped a single thing and even charged us extra for subs that they messed up on. SO NOT COMING BACK HERE EVER AGAIN. There are too many better biergartens in the city to deal with this bs.",2.0
"I am updating my review.  It seems that the owners paid attention to all of us Yelpers because service has greatly improved.  Even though our waiter was ""in training"" he still was attentive and managed to get it right.  Food was great this time.  And of course, the beers as great as ever.",4.0
"I've been a regular at a different German restaurant for years. But this is closer and I thought I'd give it a try.The menu is a good, honest cross section of the regional cuisine of the Black Forest. Execution is very good, I loved the Käsespätzle. The Flammkuchen is great and something you don't see very often.Service is quick and efficient (no doubt in part due to their wireless ordering system).The three times I've been there, all the servers knew how to pronounce the admittedly tricky German menu items.They do have my hometown beer, which earns the fifth star in my book. I will be here more often.",5.0

"Came here on a Sunday afternoon and can only say it felt like it had kind of a strange vibe. On one side the skylights and the architecture have a very modern feel, while the tables and benches are more like a traditional beer hall.

The rest of the beer list was decent, but not as extensive as some other beer gardens in NYC. We didn't try the food, but the menu seemed to have a lot of choices.The service was ok but not standout in any way, and there were a lot of parents with their young children, which is not atypical in the neighborhood, but makes things feel more subdued than you might expect. Probably a nice place to come during the day if you have kids because they seem to be accommodating for families. But not much else stands out here.",2.0

"True to its name, Black Forest Brooklyn brings a bit of der Schwartzwald zum Brooklyn. I see that Matthew S laments, ""Oh, yay, ANOTHER German beer hall,"" but I think it has a number of things going for it that give it an edge over the rest. Take it from me, as I've been around the Stammtisch a few times: I'm a huge fan of Buschenschank and Zum Schneider, but I think BFB eclipses them and certainly the likes of Der Schwarze Koelner and its crappy service.First, it has one of the best beer selections: not just the typical Hofbraeuhaus Muenchen, but Weihenstephan (one of the oldest and best breweries), Jever, and a good selection of bocks, altbier, and other richer varieties. Pils and hefeweizen are ideal in the summer, but it's nice to have darker varieties during this never-ending winter.Second, at some other German beer halls, you may get a similar selection, yet not all of these beers will be served vom Fass, which makes a huge difference for imported beer.Third, I think the atmosphere strikes the perfect balance between Brooklyn character (thoughtfully decorated, mottled exposed brick, relaxed atmosphere) and ein echtes Hofbraeuhaus. They have real Germans working here, including at least one of the owners--who, by the way, appear to give a Scheisse, as I've seen them in the place every time I've visited.Fourth, ein Wort: die Riesenbrezel! Considerably better than Buschenschank's, served hot, buttery, und so gross wie der Wienerischer Riesenrad! Easily the best pretzel this side of the Neckar.The complaints about the noise level and babies strike me as odd--you know you're going to a beer hall in Brooklyn, right?

"This past weekend my amazing girlfriend threw my 30th Birthday Sunday Funday at Black Forest Brooklyn. She said that planning with the staff was simple and they were eager to have us. She reserved the back four tables for the 40 or so friends and family that showed up. Our waitress Claire was unbelievable. Not only was she extraordinarily attentive, she made sure that no randos sat at the tables that were empty before everyone arrived. It just made it easy and relaxed. Everyone had a beer in their hands at all times.Considering how much space we took up, they never rushed us, and you just felt welcomed. Our reservation was at 3:30PM. We didn't leave till 9PM.

"Great place to watch the World Cup!  And especially if you're a Germany fan. The place was standing room only during the Germany v.

"Just visited BFB this past Saturday night around 6:30. My mom had been previously and raved about it, so she was with us as well.  I wish YELP had a 'food rating' AND an 'experience rating'.  While we thoroughly enjoyed the food, getting it was another story.  Firstly please know that it is a 'seat yourself' establishment which can get a bit confusing when you have to hang around the bar area and watch like a hawk for a table not knowing how many other people are doing the same thing.  Also, how can you have a 'seat yourself' policy but also have a table with a 'Reserved' sign on it??? Doesn't seem fair.  Fortunately, our wait wasn't long.  Our waitress seemed a bit overwhelmed when she came to take our drink order. After our drinks arrived, we ordered our food which she seemed to want to get 'done'. I ordered the Jagerschnitzel w/mushroom gravy and Spaetzle. The pork was well seasoned and not dry like some schnitzel can be.  However the spaetzle was bland.  The other items ordered were the large wurst platter that came with a choice of 7 sausages (there are only 5 options on the menu?) and only four came out.  This was served with a variety of sides a few that came out room temp but should have been hot (e.g. mashed potatoes).  They also have a German type flat-bread that was really good. However, once the waitress took our food order, it was a good 30-45 mins. before we received anything plus we never saw her again until she dropped off the check.  We also had finished our drinks and had to hail someone down for a second round.  Right before we received our food, it seemed like 3 or 4 'runners' arrived and the service quality picked up a bit.  Plus a pet peeve of mine is when your server never comes back to your table to make sure everything is OK and you have everything you need.  Although they have been open for 7 weeks (according to Yelp) the service still seems a bit disorganized.  I noticed two kitchen staff visiting the basement to re-up on supplies.  Not something you necessarily want to take time to do during a dinner rush.Since the bar gets very busy, maybe the wait staff attending the tables should do the wine pours (like I've seen done in other establishments).  Also, we sat right by the office and observed the owners going in and out, and greeting friends but I didn't see any interaction or managing of the staff.   I've seen owners of restaurants who have been in business for years, come by tables and make sure everything is OK.  Certainly something you'd want to do when you are 'fulfilling a lifetime dream of opening their own business' (from the BFB website).All in all, I would recommend the food.  I would definitely give it another try go again and would probably call ahead. ; )",3.0

We sat at a communal table with two strangers and a pile of dishes and glasses from the previous diners. We sat there for 20 minutes with the remains of someone else's food and no service. The bus boy seems to think they are our dishes now, but still doesn't clear the table. Finally flagged down a waitress from a different area who was clearly annoyed at having to take our order, and I don't blame her, her co-worker was way out of her depth. And then, finally, food was just not good - the exact same things we'd gotten on the second visit were not only lackluster, they seemed to be made differently (worse) -  like they must have run out of mashed potatoes and sauerkraut and got them from a box/jar, fries were soggy, etc. Seems like some potential, but I got about one more visit before the sheer mess the place is makes me finally wise up and stop wasting money for frustration and middle of the road grease and starch that seems to be what you're likely to get.",2.0
