"We took Grandma to Grandma's House for dinner. We had a party of six ranging from 15 to 68 years of age. From the moment we walked in until we left we were treated with great hospitality. Every waitress assisted with any of our needs or requests. They gave their recommendations and all were spot on.  We shared fried pickles, bucket of fries and bucket of onion strings for the table. The breading used on the pickles and onions was light and tasty. The fries were a mix of traditional fries and chips. Two folks got the sweet BBQ ribs. The ribs fell off the bone. They were flavourful and tender. It was served with a side sauce. My personal opinion they did not need the sauce. Two folks ordered the chicken pot pie. They were phenomenal. The pies were full of flavor, the crust was light and flaky. They were rich in texture and flavor. One person ordered the chicken burger and another a cheeseburger. Both of them enjoyed the burgers.  The burgers were cooked the way they ordered and popped with flavor. We were not disappointed, definitely would recommend to friends and family AND we will be returning.",5.0
"Grandma's House is an All American kitschy comfort food paradise for those who need a little TLC. They rarely seat any one in the front of house, so do not get discouraged if you think they're closed, just yank on the door and find out! Service is neighborly, kind, and chipper. For the location, affordability, and ability to seat a group, Grandma's House gets four stars. With a great location on Atlantic, its easy to get to and easy to find. Most of the menu is under $15 and the portions are good. There are plenty of nooks to seat groups of 15-20 and also smaller nooks for paties of 8. They're also very family friendly. I think there is a step up to get into the restaurant, but I also saw a number of strollers in here, so it's not impossible. The food is three stars, more because its rather generic, diner like food. We ordered:Short stack pancakes with fruit - tasty, fluffy, great with syrupCoffee - standard drip in a small mugChicken crisps - fried chicken thighs, pounded flat, rolled in potato chips and served with a buttermilk quasi ranch dip, these are addictive and a great sideTaylor ham and cheese sandwich - tasty fluffy bread, crisp ham and gooey cheese. I wish there was more ham to bread ratio, but for the $8 price, it will pass. For next time: looks like the chicken pot pie is the winner here. Will have to try when I come back not at brunch.",4.0
"This Review is for delivery. I ordered the Mac and cheese, chicken bucket and grandma Brooklyn salad. Delivery took 1.5 hrs after the estimated 50 mins from seamless.4 cheese Mac had good noodles but was so bland. Like no cheesy flavor at all. It was creamy but like I couldn't taste cheddar or Swiss or anything - just warm. I don't know.Chicken was just ok. The only flavor was oil. It didn't come with any dipping sauce and it definitely needs sauce. If you don't have any I guess ask for it on the side?Salad came undressed which is really the most annoying. Did not come with any sauce on the side either. Also kind of flimsy for $10.5Really unimpressed in general. I love soul food and am not judging this against Michelin star restaurants, I'm judging it against delicious, comfort food which is very much capable being cheap and flavorful. Maybe it's better in the restaurant. Would be willing to give it a try there but would not reorder online.",2.0
"I really like this place- we have ordered take-out from here 2x and were pretty satisfied. I loved the chicken pot pie- although I think I'd prefer potato pieces to mashed potatoes on the bottom. But the chicken was good quality and the sauce was awesome.They have these amazing chicken finger type things covered in potato chips-mmmmmmmmmm!!! Skip the fried pickles though- holy salt and i'm a salt fiend, so that's saying something. They also have amazing cole slaw with fruit and stuff in it. Burgers here are good, not great, same with the fries. Ordered pies from here- they were good as well.",4.0
"I don't think I've ever felt so welcomed at a restaurant. Grandma's House might be the only reason why I'd ever choose to go to Boerum Hill. I came here on a Sunday and was immediately impressed with the ambiance. It definitely gives off that stereotypical-grandma's-house feel. From the table cloths to the menu itself, they definitely succeeded in living up to its name and exceeding my expectations. For the size of the restaurant, the menu is pretty extensive. It wasn't busy when a friend and I came here but our server was really sweet. She was attentive but not overbearing. She was apologetic about the fact that we had to wait a little longer than usual because what we ordered had to be prepared from scratch. I dunno about you, but that's something I actually like to hear, especially if it is chicken pot pie and mac and cheese that I'm waiting for. They were so apologetic that they even provided us with complimentary onion rings which they really didn't have to do, but I appreciated the effort in making my friend and I comfortable while we waited. Needless to say the food was well worth the wait and I'll definitely be back.",5.0
"The staff, the decor, and the vibe is wonderful. Even the owner, very friendly and genuine. The food on the other hand, nothing special. I had the Mac and cheese, yet I felt there was not enough actual cheese, ironically.. The plus: They use bread from mazzolas bakery, which is the best bread in Brooklyn. I wish I would of ordered breakfast because it seems like that is their prime meals. Maybe next time!",3.0
"It was hard to pass up the chance to check out a restaurant that bills itself as the place for some kick ass comfort food.  Fortunately the experience did not disappoint.  I swung by here to grab some lunch.  I saw a lot of very appealing options.  Actually, if you like comfort food, it's hard not to drool when you look at all the cool choices they offered.  After thinking about it for quite some time, I opted for the chicken pot pie, which was said to be one of their signature dishes.  When it was served, the actual size of the dish wasn't that impressive.  I was actually worried that I would be hungry (despite the fact I already ate a small bucket of onion strings which came with the pot pie and are absolutely delicious since they use the same potato chip breading as they do for their chicken dish).  Well, lo and behold, that little dish literally filled me to the brim.  The crust was sensational.  Absolutely perfect.  The pot pie itself oozed like a warm blanket in my stomach .. thanks to the gravy-like texture and the almost undetectable mashed potatoes that were perfectly blended with the rather tasty sauce.  In short, if you want something that's the definition of comfort food ... the pot pie is absolutely the way to go.  I was able to get a bite of the veggie mac and cheese and it was also excellent.  It also looked small, but the flavor was rich and the entire dish was also pretty hearty.  To explain it better - the mac and cheese tasted like an incredibly tasty veggie/cheese omelette  minus the eggs.  It had that same kind of sensation.Another bonus point to this place - the service is outstanding.  The folks were incredibly helpful, friendly and really made you feel like you were home.  The decor was also memorable and the ambiance was inviting.  It's unfortunate someone had a bad experience with delivery and gave this place a shitty review, but based on my dining experience in the restaurant I have to say this was one of the better places I checked out in recent months in NYC.  Note to self:  The food here can be pretty rich/hearty, which I guess is part of what defines comfort food ... so unless you have a huge appetite, it would be wise to order in moderation first and add as you go ...",5.0
"The food and decor are not the only old school aspect of this place, there ye olde brooklynites aplenty. I had an omelet and bacon that were both pretty tasty.  My husband had a chicken pot pie that he really liked.  He practically drank the buttermilk sauce that came with our fried pickles.",4.0
"This place is weird.  We went for brunch and felt it was a diner.  It's also fairly new, opening a few months ago, but has the feeling of a old diner in a random town.The food was fine, overpriced omelettes, I think the mac n cheese is where it's at.Very kid friendly but won't be returning..",3.0
"2016 Edit:I get we live in the age of the internet, but seriously guys, the phone is not your enemy. Calling to place your order, especially here, will serve you much better than ordering online.***Onto the original review***I cannot be more excited to review this place, and to be the first one! Weee!Grandma's House was originally located in South Street Seaport, and according to it's old Yelp reviews (4.5 stars), quite popular. Until Sandy came along. I cannot imagine the heartbreak to have that happen to a (grand)mom/pop shop, and have the strength to go through the crazy logistics of what is the crazy process of (re-)opening a restaurant in New York. But Grandma is back!I literally found out about the old gal's history tonight, before I stepped into the restaurant. I have been walking by Grandma's the past few months and impatiently waiting for them to open because the decor is absolutely charming. And, I don't know, the idea of the ""American Grandma"" charms this Asian girl. And when I walked by tonight and found out they were open, I was so excited to toss out any other potential dinner plans. We were going to Grandma's!I will say, and admit, that usually when I'm drawn to try a restaurant based on idea or decor, the food rarely meets expectations. And I was fully expecting that. But thank god that was absolutely NOT the case here because this Grandma can cook!I feel I have to emphasize, that this place is called Grandma's House. Meaning the food here is simple American. Not New American. Old school. So expect simple and comfort food flavors. Which means, yes, Grandma's stands apart from the offerings of Smith St. fare in a really good, awesome way. The ingredients are still of really good quality, which was another A+ surprise for me, because they could have cut corners, but they really didn't. And THANK YOU for comfort food done right.House Salad - simple and fresh ingredients. As we were sharing the salad, they very kindly offered to provide two different dressings and an extra plate to share. What a gem.Grandma's Sweet Barbecue Ribs - got a ""spectacular"" review by the picky eater. The owner guaranteed that the meat would fall off the bone. And boy did it. He described the (if I remember correctly) 7 hour process they treat it. And man, does it get some lovin'.Chili - was hearty and comes in a small skillet. Pairs amazingly with...American Fries - it's fries, done right. Sometimes you go somewhere and you go, how do you mess up fries? They don't do that here. They get it right.Mac and Cheese - 4 different types of American-made cheeses. Ooh, he told me! What was it...Mozzarella, Cheddar, Vermont, aaaand...darnit! He was having trouble remembering what the fourth was too. Darn! There is a fourth though! It's not Kraft Mac & Cheese, so expect a little roux taste (which I really enjoy).Pickles - the pickles! They are breaded with potato chips! How INGENIOUS is that! It comes with homemade buttermilk dipping sauce. I need to go back and try their Chicken Pot Pie because it sounds amaazing. In a skillet! With mashed potatoes on the bottom! Mmmm...And breakfast ALL DAY! YES!!The decor. I cannot get over it. I love everything in there, especially the wood-burning oven made to look like a fireplace. There's a lot, but it's not cluttered. It's all so charming, everywhere you look! I could go on forever, and supply endless pictures, but every little thing is special. The chairs, the tables, the tv, the lights! Everything!I cannot wait for them to be open full force because I fully see myself many a-nights saying ""let's go to Grandma's!""They're planning delivery soon (non-Seamless, because apparently they take 27%! TWENTY SEVEN!) So yea guys, sorry you're going to have to use your phone to, *gasp!* call.",5.0
"After a night of drinking, this is a great place to hit up for breakfast/brunch to get that fried food fix that we all crave. Comfort food accurately describes this restaurant and is not a place if you're looking for something healthy. For example, the fried items are coated with a potato chip batter. I ordered the veggie burger. I enjoyed it, but the actual party did not have the most flavor. Luckily they cover the top with tons of peppers, onions, and mushrooms. We also got a side of fries and fried pickles. A large portion of fries are served, two of us couldn't even finish the one order. If you're a lover of ranch, I would definitely recommend getting some on the side to put on the burger, fries, pretty much anything! The ambiance was super cute and homey, I want to go back and taste some of their pancakes which looked delicious!",4.0
"Great hospitality and friendliness by staff and owner, even a little bit chatty. They went out of their way to make sure we were happy. High-end comfort food. Ingredients from everything to their dipping sauce to the onion rings were explained to us in great detail.

"If you know me and are someone who is important in my life, you'll know that I'm a big fan of America.So, naturally, this past weekend when I was visiting my brother in Brooklyn and walking down the street and saw an establishment with a giant American flag outside of it I was really Jazzed, to say the least.Upon closer introspection it became clear to me that this homage to freedom is actually a restaurant, which is, aptly named, Grandma's house.Both my grandmothers were not American and did not have houses so while this did not stick I could appreciate it.this place is new. Presumably it opened because someone purposely wanted to sink their money into a weird Americana themed restaurant in the middle of Brooklyn because (?) but I'm not sure. The food is good. Literally the only time I felt sick to my stomach was when I cracked open the menu and discovered it was entirely written in Comic Sans. Other than that, the actual experience was great. We went for brunch and FYI this isn't a NYC (or really even a Minneapolis) level brunch TBH but the eggs were fluffy, the potatoes were crispy and the coffee was good. The food isn't fancy and challah French toast probably isn't even an option here but if you're like me and won't get mad at eggs and bac then you won't get mad at this place. Omelette on point BTW. They have lunch too but can't say anything about it. SORRYZAlso, as the waitress pointed out to the table next to us literally four thousand times the plates are hot. For someone like me who doesn't follow direction well, this is one to take seriously. The plates are hot. PROCEED WITH CAUTION.TBH to the decor is offensive. Even thoe I'm from the Midwest and have spent more time than I'd like to admit in places with names like ""Egg Harbor"" and ""craft palace"", this place was 2 much. I like America and am not embarrassed easily but felt shamefaced sitting here.Grandma's house is good. If you have kids or you can't keep your act together in general this is probably a good place to go because the expectations seem pretty low for this place. If you wanna be a Samantha and drink a mimosa with your gal pals, you're going to be upset so don't come here.",4.0
"Stopped by with a friend for a brunch yesterday. Can't say enough great things about the friendliest service in New York. We ordered the omelette, which was served skillet style. One thing that sets this place apart is tons of cheese options including fresh mozzarella, which is what we got. Delicious! We also got a special type of sweet breakfast they invented in this place. Decadent and yum! It's the grandma toast. Won't spoil the secret of what's in it, just say you should try it for yourself.",4.0
"I ordered a burger, rice pudding and chocolate cake via seamless thinking it was near FiDi where I lived. I then received a very lovely call from the owner telling me that he and his son were driving all the way from Atlantic ave in Brooklyn to deliver my order. My street was closed off and his son walked two blocks in the cold. He also apologized as the location used to be in south st Seaport prior to hurricane sandy and they moved locations which was not updated by Seamless. I felt awful considering how little I ordered but he was so kind and was not bothered at all by this.Not only did they drive all the way out to honor the order, call to make sure I knew it was coming but the food was absolutely DELICIOUS!!!! Especially the yummy burger and chocolate cake with whipped cream. Thank you for the phenomenal service. Next time I'll be coming to you! :)",5.0

No clue how they would ever even stay on the burger the way it was served. Chicken chips - dry and tasteless. Didn't even have enough salt. Fries - super soggy and oily. But I don't fault them too much on this one. Since most places don't deliver French fries well. Chicken pot pie - resembled the quality of canned chicken pot pie soup type of thing. Salad - please please don't put giant celery sticks in a salad. And also huge pieces of carrot sliced with a mandolin are also unmanageable in a salad. Maybe it's just not a delivery place?

"I ordered delivery for Grandma's House. 45 minutes in, they messaged saying our food will arrive in 10 minutes. Waited for another 40 minutes and the food never came. We decided to call to check in on our order and a guy picks up. Not only was he completely unresponsive to our concerns, he began putting the blame on the CUSTOMER! He didn't even try to understand the issue from our side (which we had no fault in, as we received both a confirmation e-mail from Yelp AND the restaurant) and began making up lies about us cancelling our order from a phone call? He knew our number perfectly well, and still claimed that we ""called"" him when we did no such thing. We tried to better understand the situation, but he hung up on us mid-sentence. Worse, Grandma's House continued to charge our card despite never having received the food. The only saving grace was our ability to talk to Yelp's Eat 24 directly to get a re-fund.We were excited to try out Grandma's House, seeing all the previous reviews and its high rating, but I am completely disappointed by the employee's execution of THEIR MISTAKE. Completely unacceptable. This is my first time using Yelp and it completely deters me from ever using Yelp to order again. TL;DR- Restaurant never gave delivery after I waited for more than an hour- BLAMED the customer for mis-ordering (even though I had the confirmation message from both Yelp and the restaurant)- LIED and said WE cancelled our own order and DID NOT apologize- COMPLETELY RUDE on the phone and HUNG UP on us mid-sentence- Charged our credit card despite never having received the foodVERY poor customer service and VERY poor at handling customer issues.DO NOT order delivery from this restaurant.",1.0
"I wish I could write about the food but unfortunately I never had a chance.   I walked to the restaurant for brunch at 11am to find out that they were closed and opening at 5pm even though yelp stated they were open at 10am.  I gave them the benefit of the doubt that maybe they were short on inventory due to the winter storm that hit on Saturday (today is Monday).I was working in my hotel when I decided to put an order for delivery through Eat24.  I was told the food would be delivered within 45-60 minutes.  After waiting 1hr and 20 minutes I called the restaurant and was told that a delivery went out and if I dont get my food in 15 minutes to call ""Seamless"" (even though it's Eat24 where I placed my order) and have them replace the order because they had a ""system glitch"".   Then she hangs up on me.1.  If I had a dollar for every time a restaurant used the ""system glitch"" excuse so that they dont have to be accountable, I would be a millionaire.2.  Instead of offering an alternative solution or making a better effort to track my food, I simply get the ""oh well, sucks to be you"" customer service.3.  Don't over commit and under deliver.  Its the worst thing you can do as a restaurant.   Dont mess with the wrath of a starving customer; your customers have the power of the internet.  Don't tell your customers your food will be ready in an hour when it wont be.   And take ownership when you can't fulfill all your orders. Never giving this restaurant another chance.",1.0
"Fantastic! We have been waiting to home here for a while! We had been reading about its transition from downtown Manhattan with Hurricane sandy, and we were so excited to have this restaurant in our neighborhood! The place is adorable! Such cute decor- looks very old fashioned but in a smart way. We started off with the ""chicken chips""- fried chicken tenders with a potato chip breading and buttermilk dipping sauce. Why didn't we think of that idea?? Fantastic! I had fried eggs and bacon, which was made to order, and my husband had a roast beef sandwich that was house made and sliced there. The flavor was amazing! Perfect amount of spices. And they are kid friendly! We brought out 9 month old and they had several high chairs and were very happy to accommodate us! The staff was fantastic and the owner was so sweet! We will be back for the pot pie!!",5.0

The only saving grace was our ability to talk to Yelp's Eat 24 directly to get a re-fund.We were excited to try out Grandma's House, seeing all the previous reviews and its high rating, but I am completely disappointed by the employee's execution of THEIR MISTAKE. Completely unacceptable. This is my first time using Yelp and it completely deters me from ever using Yelp to order again. TL;DR- Restaurant never gave delivery after I waited for more than an hour- BLAMED the customer for mis-ordering (even though I had the confirmation message from both Yelp and the restaurant)- LIED and said WE cancelled our own order and DID NOT apologize- COMPLETELY RUDE on the phone and HUNG UP on us mid-sentence- Charged our credit card despite never having received the foodVERY poor customer service and VERY poor at handling customer issues.DO NOT order delivery from this restaurant.",1.0
"I wish I could write about the food but unfortunately I never had a chance.   I walked to the restaurant for brunch at 11am to find out that they were closed and opening at 5pm even though yelp stated they were open at 10am.  I gave them the benefit of the doubt that maybe they were short on inventory due to the winter storm that hit on Saturday (today is Monday).I was working in my hotel when I decided to put an order for delivery through Eat24.  I was told the food would be delivered within 45-60 minutes.  After waiting 1hr and 20 minutes I called the restaurant and was told that a delivery went out and if I dont get my food in 15 minutes to call ""Seamless"" (even though it's Eat24 where I placed my order) and have them replace the order because they had a ""system glitch"".   Then she hangs up on me.1.  If I had a dollar for every time a restaurant used the ""system glitch"" excuse so that they dont have to be accountable, I would be a millionaire.2.  Instead of offering an alternative solution or making a better effort to track my food, I simply get the ""oh well, sucks to be you"" customer service.3.  Don't over commit and under deliver.  Its the worst thing you can do as a restaurant.   Dont mess with the wrath of a starving customer; your customers have the power of the internet.  Don't tell your customers your food will be ready in an hour when it wont be.   And take ownership when you can't fulfill all your orders. Never giving this restaurant another chance.",1.0
"Fantastic! We have been waiting to home here for a while! We had been reading about its transition from downtown Manhattan with Hurricane sandy, and we were so excited to have this restaurant in our neighborhood! The place is adorable! Such cute decor- looks very old fashioned but in a smart way. We started off with the ""chicken chips""- fried chicken tenders with a potato chip breading and buttermilk dipping sauce. Why didn't we think of that idea?? Fantastic! I had fried eggs and bacon, which was made to order, and my husband had a roast beef sandwich that was house made and sliced there. The flavor was amazing! Perfect amount of spices. And they are kid friendly! We brought out 9 month old and they had several high chairs and were very happy to accommodate us! The staff was fantastic and the owner was so sweet! We will be back for the pot pie!!",5.0
"Had a great dinner with my two daughters 10 and 7. Food was absolutely delicious. Must try the Brooklyn Blackout Cake!!! It's the real deal!! Kevin the owner couldn't have been more informative or accommodating. I'll be heading back soon with the rest of family including my dad, a long time Brooklyn native!!!",5.0
Great food and service; make sure to get the home fries. There is a lot of room with tables and they make their own bread so the bakery goods are amazing.,5.0
"Went to this place strictly because of yelp. Was looking for something simple to eat that was fast food. I said ok, decent amount of stars, cute name, let's go! Really cute straight country barn type feeling. Had the mac and cheese which came on a skillet. It was really good but I have had better. The beer selection is great. Love the Masson jars as cups. There are fresh daisies on every table which was so cute. Really laid back kind of place not crowded at all.",4.0
"Grandmas House was a recommend by a trusted-foodie friend. The burgers my son and his girlfriend ordered, 1 cheddar and mushrooms and 1Swiss, were cooked to perfection, delicious , really good meat burgers. I had an exquisite Chicken Pot Pie made with Bell and Evans chicken, a beautiful top crust and mashed potatoes on the bottom. That was so good. It was big enough to share. The beers were cold, on tap and served by Frank who waited on us at the luncheonette counter. So fun! Service was great, staff was friendly A great experience, I will go back!!",5.0
"The Brooklyn chicken chips were good, made even better by the buttermilk dipping sauce. The decor was bright with many old signs and memorabilia on the walls.

"I really enjoyed eating here today! It literally felt like I was at a grandma's house. The staff was super friendly (bc my boyfriend and I ordered allagash white, the owner stayed around longer to have one as well and cheered to us for convincing him to drink his favorite beer after a long day) and our waitress made sure that my bf got the correct burger he ordered after seeing that he got the wrong one. They also gave us a complimentary order of french fries which were AMAZING! They were simple and delicious just as fries should be!I ordered a turkey burger and could see that they hand make the patties. I also got the tropical cole slaw which I loved. It was really just simple coleslaw with some raisins and pineapple tidbits, but those two additions were a nice touch.My boyfriend ordered the ""Peter Luger"" bacon burger. It was deliciously rich and the toasted white bread soaked up all the juices and did not fall apart.Lastly we finished our meal off with a chocolate egg cream. yummmmmy.I recommend this place and can't wait to go back and try more!",4.0

"This place is incredible! All the food is made fresh, no joke, from the  French fries to salad dressing. I recommend trying the chicken chips, similar to chicken nuggets but instead of breaded and fried they are dipped in egg and potato chips then fried! I'm seriously serious when I say decadent and divine. It's a hang over cure sent from heaven! Staff was friendly and helpful not to mention the atmosphere and vibe rules. We will be back!!!",5.0

"I was surprised such a spacious place as this could exist in Brooklyn! Very bright and nice Americana sort of decor too. The staff were very welcoming and friendly, which, once again, was surprising in Brooklyn. I got the chicken pot pie, which was AMAZING! The crust was crispy and tasty, the chicken was nice quality, and the filling was super yummy. I also stole my friend's fries, which were equally delicious. All for a reasonable price. Will definitely be back.",5.0
Great breakfast spot! Generous portions that were delish and they even threw in some extra yummy treats on the house. They serve this decadent pastry bread filled with cream cheese and jelly.

"Lovely place, great food and very friendly owners! They used to be in South Street Seaport but the place was closed after Sandy. They recently opened up a new place on Atlantic Ave. They were a 5 star restaurant in South Street Seaport and even the Yelp CEO come in to check out. Make sure to ask the owners about where they get the ice cream from! There is a story behind everything that you see at Grandma's house.",5.0

"My husband and I have been here twice in the last week. The first time, we sat at the bar and had a few beers, while the owner showed us how he makes a genuine egg cream, with the straw standing straight in the center of the glass on it's own! So entertaining! Tonight, we returned for dinner. My husband had the chicken pot pie and a beer, and I had the chicken chips, which come with buttermilk dipping cream. The chicken chips were fried white meat chicken strips coated in crushed potato chips. They were fried to perfection; light and crispy on the outside and tender and juicy on the inside. The high quality of the ingredients were evident. Our server, Lorna, was amazingly attentive. The decor is so charming, and fun for all ages. While we ate, we saw families with several young children and a couples without any children enjoying their meals. We can't wait to bring our daughter here and try some of the other yummy items on the menu! This place is a great addition to the neighborhood!",5.0
