"(capitalization - Enthusiasm)This place was the BOMB, They definitely have vegan options, and the options ARE PLENTY.  You can literally get EVERYTHING on the menu in one platter.  My Girlfriend and I went there for lunch and got the medium platter ( 10$ ) and we were stuffed.  As stated above we got everything.  It's all served from a Buffet Hotwell, you order as you enter and seat yourself.We had Lima beans, Tofu Curry, collard greens, tofu lo mein, lentils and rice, and cabbage sauteed with carrots.  Everything was delicious and they finesse the shit out of the flavors.  BOMB.",5.0
"Oh my goodness, I wish I lived closer to this place because this place was flipping amazing! For about $10 or less, you can choose from an assortment of vegetarian offerings. You will get a ton of food and you will get full for that price point I had just mentioned. When I had gone here a few months ago, I got their $8 platter, and that came with an assortment of stewed greens, lentils, and this amazing sweet and savory seitan. My mouth is watering just thinking about that meal.If you happen to be in Flatbush and you happen to be hankering for a vegetarian feast, I'd suggest you stop by here. I suppose one can't feel too guilty gorging on the food here as nothing is deep fried, but you will definitely feel like you're going to explode, which is how I felt after my meal. It was all worth it, though.",5.0
"This meat enthusiast found Strictly Vegetarian a smashing success. There are combo plates, priced at $8, $10 or $14. You don't choose what you're getting; they give you several dishes that alternate to some degree. The curry chunks (soy? no idea) were the meatiest and the spiciest of the selections. The dish included excellent lentils, as well as cabbage and kale.It may be healthier than ribeye steaks but this isn't a place for South Beach dieters. The combo includes lo mein as well as rice. Believe the hype about the sizes. The $10 plate was a big meal for me and might not be finished by a normal person.",5.0

It's been a staple in a changing neighborhood and has always offered a healthy, low sodium, Vegetarian and Vegan option.  Btw, I'm not a full fledged vegetarian and I can eat their meals every single day and be satiated! The food is and has always been consistent in quality & flavor, the cost is effective, the portions are large and the staff is friendly. It's been a pleasure to support this great business over the years I look forward to continuing to do so!",5.0
"This was an amazing Yelp find. We needed a vegetarian restaurant or a restaurant with good vegetarian offerings because one of guys on our crew was vegetarian. The stellar reviews on Yelp persuaded us to take a chance on getting lunch for everyone here.There's an inverse correlation between the attractiveness of the food and its tastiness. Meaning as unattractive and unappealing the food may look, the meal was very very very tasty. Even my meat-loving carnivore husband liked the food and was totally satisfied and didn't miss having meat.Everything was delicious, but I loved the braised tofu skins and the mashed pumpkin. The kale was also really good. It's definitely home-cooked comfort food, vegan Carribean style. You don't get to choose what you want. You order the size (small - $8, medium - $10, and large - $14) and he fills up the container with a little bit of everything. The portions are HUGE. A medium is incredibly large and too much food for me (but each man on the crew polished off a medium no problem). A large is an insane amount of food. Great value. Delicious food.

"The reviews for Strictly Vegetarian are spot on. Not much to look at (but clean and well lit - very important), but the food is great.

The first time I walked in, I knew it would be vegetarian but wasn't really sure what to expect since it's Caribbean vegetarian. But tried it anyway and it was delicious!It took awhile but I finally made it back with my vegan-loving husband and my turn-your-nose-up-at-vegetarian-cusine BIL. Both loved it. We were served up some rice with black eyed peas, curry tofu, mashed pumpkin, kale, bean curd thing and possibly something else.Kale doesn't do much for me but this was delicious. They had blanched it to take out the bitterness. And it was slightly spicy. I expected to hate the pumpkin and give all of it to the hubs. I'm not a fan of pumpkin. Well, let's just say he didn't get a single bite of mine.Everyday they have a different menu. The guy behind the counter asks you what size you want. Once you tell him, he serves a heaping spoon of everything into your carton. Let me just say that even a small is enough for leftovers. A medium or large will guarantee two-three meals. And for the price? Small - $7, medium - $9, large - $10 or $11, it was so well worth it.Atmosphere? Hole in the wall but who cares? Everyone was really nice and the food was amazing AND well priced. If they plopped this place down in Williamsburg, I bet it wouldn't be as good and it would be double to triple the price.",5.0

It would be premature of me since I don't dine at vegetarian eateries often. Since it was near closing time, they were running out of food. I ordered a small plate for $8 since I was unsure if the food would be a hit or miss. I passed on the rice and peas as well as the mixed vegetables with zucchini. Instead, I opted for the curry chunks, bbq tofu, and collard greens. For your information, I am not a fan of tofu but theirs passed the test. The meal was good, had Caribbean flair, and was hearty. Quite a few patrons walked in after me to fill their bellies too. I couldn't even finish my food, because I was so full. Thankfully, I did not indulge in their desserts, soy patties, or drinks.

The place is spotless I came in and saw the guy cleaning behind the stove, the walls. Never seen that in any store. The food made me forget about eating meat. You get a little of everything if u r not sure what u want, like me. I had curry soy chunks, red peas, veggie lo mein and kale. All very good. Will definitely be coming back again",5.0
"This is somewhat similar to Italfari (another resteraunt in crown height brooklyn). You get a little bit of everything. Note the menu changes every single day, so you will always have a variety. They use Soy Chunks, that's it. The food may be a bit spicy for small children. There is always two choices of rice or pasta. The way they make each varies on day to day basis. Today ( Tuesday) I had curry chunks, spinach, pumpkin, vegetable spaghetti, lentils, you can choose what you want or do not want. Small is $7, medium $9, best bet is to get a medium it feeds 2 or 3.  I have been to many vegetarian restaurants Caribbean/Rasta style this is the best. The staff is friendly, they are mostly Rasta/Kemetic. The portions are very large. They also have VEGAN pastries. Great place to spend your Buck!",5.0
"yowza. walked for 15 minutes to find this place. the guys were having a debate about Lebron vs the Spurs. i waited patiently for them to finish as i checked out my surroundings. everything was clean, i mean, CLEAN. the baked treats were neatly displayed in front and the cafeteria-style entree items were on the right. there is some seating along the window and the side wall, but not much. (bar style seating). i asked him what he had today:he opened the lid to each container- - rice and beans- pinto beans- kale with lemon juice- soy chunks with veggies- lo mein- curry soy chunks- okra- chickpeashe took out a small container and told me to say no to anything i didn't want. the only thing i said no to was the lo meinhe eyed me suspiciously and asked if i was sure and i nodded. i talked some basketball with him and paid for my food. all vegan, baby! no dairy here. the small container is more than enough for one person. i got back home and experimented by pouring some mole sauce on it and it was all super delicious.",4.0
"I've been coming here since i moved to the neighborhood 8 years ago and am so glad this place has survived the onslaught of development on Church ave.

"This place is a classic.  Just gets better with time.  Generous heapings of veg and soy for take out.  Friendly and relaxed old school neighborhood vibes.  Patties are good, but the meals are the best.",5.0
The curry soy chunks are AMAZING! Another thing that is great to try are the soy patties. Its so worth it to get the large size with all of the options for the day.The staff are very friendly and get very thrilled when you enjoy the food.

Vegetarian and Ital food at its best! They provide (as everyone else said) a good amount of food. Their oatmeal cookies are amazing. I appreciate the simple ingredients in the cookies (taste sugar and oil free which is awesome for me). The guy at the counter was super friendly and gave great service! Definitely check it out!!,5.0
The chickpeas and kale were so delicious. Full of flavor. I wouldn't recommend the oatmeal cookie. it was too hard,4.0
"Yup this place is bomb.  7 bucks 9 bucks or 12 bucks for small medium or large.   The friendly guy behind the counter will fill your container up accordingly.  You get a bit of everything or you can pick and choose what you want but it's all good so just let him fill it up.  Lots of good eats here - chick peas, collard greens, a bbq tofu was real delightful, curry tofu chunks so good really nice and spicey.  Usually there is a rice and noodle dish as well and other vegetables.  Definitely a good spot for to go or to eat in.",4.0

"I go in and order a medium of everything but rice.  The noodles go on the bottom and then curry soy chunks, chickpeas, stringbean, barbeque tofu and greens with corn.

He's the short and very warm guy that serves ya. Been going here for years and there is a lot of food given so you can definitely have some for leftovers.  If you don't eat meat, or just want to try something new, go to tis place and you will definitely be back.  Tried the ""oatmeal cookies"" before and they are definitely vegetarian, no grandmas cookies here.  These cookies............ tasted.........um.........Healthy!

"I love to go to Strictly Vegetarian if I have a weekday off.  It's just a filling, warming, satisfying lunch.  Every time I order, I look at the size of the small carton and wonder if I should upgrade to the medium.  And I always come to the same conclusion after seeing the guy load it up - NOT NECESSARY!  He fills that carton to maximum capacity, giving you enough for at least 1 1/2 meals.  I take it home, mix it all up and sometimes put some hot sauce on.  Perfect.",5.0
This is the type of place a Eco Warrior would love.  Not me.  I had the veggie burger and some curry soy protein.  It was hard to finish all of it.  For what you get I guess I see the value in it.  It's more then just your plain old salad.  I'd try a few more dishes to see.,3.0

"Order the large and feed an army! For just ten dollars you get a heaping portion of strictly ""ital"" food (no not italian) that can easily feed 3-4 people, or feed yourself and have lunch/leftovers. Don't forget to get some of their vegan baked goods as well.",4.0
