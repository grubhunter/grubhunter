"Great, great neighborhood bar. Relaxed atmosphere with a wonderful backyard space that can be enjoyed when the weather is nice. They also have a couple of good deals including burger and a beer and a beer and a shot.",5.0
"Hollow Nickel is an above average bar with food options. A short walk from the Atlantic Ave. Terminal, it was absolutely packed on Friday after 5pm until about 7pm for happy hour. Then it quiets down and the night crowd slowly starts filling up. With a diverse crowd of patrons, a great backyard with plenty of seating, and decent food options, it's worth checking out. Beer options are standard for your Brooklyn bars, but the bartenders really know what they're doing despite the hoards running at them with drink orders. I tried only a few of the appetizers but the jalapeno poppers were awesome, the nachos were OK and the fries were.....they were fries. Wouldn't mind coming back at all.",4.0
"Delicious food. Great ambiance. Ordered the nachos with everything on itand the chicken quesadilla.Great selection of craft beer as well.Nice little shin dig.I'd go here again, and maybe bring a bunch of friends too.",4.0
"Excellent choice for a bar if you have some time before going to an event at Barclays just up Atlantic Ave, or if you just happen to be in the area! Casual and reasonably priced pub-style food, good selection of drinks (and $1 off well cocktails until 9pm). I recommend the black bean burger! Surprisingly tasty.Service was a bit slow. Our waitress was the only one handling the entire front of the place, plus also helping man the bar. Curious to try the outdoor garden in the warmer months!",4.0
"Hollow Nickel is a cozy bar that has a good selection of bourbons, craft beers, & tasty comfort food. You'll find Kentucky bourbons like Bulleit, Knobs Creek, & Widows Jane. They also make cocktails like the Brooklyn Sour, the Manhattan, & an Old Fashion. Also, the craft beers on tap rotate frequently & sometimes feature local favorites like Sixpoint. The Bacon Burger with Monterey Jack cheese was not amazing but it was good & it hit the spot. If you prefer something lighter, try the flavorful Guacamole & Chips. The kitchen is open late on most nights & depending on where you sit, you may have to place your food/drink order at the bar. Hollow Nickel's back room has intimate booths with candle light setting, perfect for dates or just catching up with friends. On nice days, they open up their beautiful backyard, which is landscaped & romantically lit at night. FYI: This bar is known as an After-Party spot for Barclays events so there may be a longer wait than usual.",4.0
"Had the best, most unexpected time here. I was on my way home from the Mermaid Parade when my belly started rumbling, so I whipped out my handy yelp app and headed here, a short walk from Atlantic Terminal. Let me start off by saying I was ready to call it a day and head home but this place lit the entire night for me, suddenly anything was possible.We walked in around 6 and were instantly in the mood for a good time. I wasn't planning on drinking but they had a $6 dollar special, a shot of whiskey and a beer, they were able to sub in their Hollow Nickel Ale, which was so refreshing. I ordered the BLT with a salad, it was awesome. The sourdough was wonderful and perfectly toasted, the bacon was crispy, tomato was juicy and there was a good amount of mayo. The salad was fresh and dressed to perfection.We decided to try a pickle back shot, I recommend everyone try this, at least once! It's hard to stop at one and before we knew it, we missed 3 trains and just decided to stay. We ventured out for a bit but it wasn't long till we were back, this time we headed to the outdoor area. It's beautiful and very roomy, there was just enough seating for everyone and the waitresses were always making their way through the crowd, making friendly conversation and taking drink orders. This was truly a magical night, made possible by Hollow Nickel.",5.0
I try to be fair with my reviews. With that being said after a leave a not so good review and the manager or owner of an establishment reaches out to me to rectify the situation I appreciate that. Once that happens I give the establishment the benefit of the doubt and not hold them solely responsible for when their staff may be having a not so good day. This particular owner reached out to me immediately after my experience with his establishment and even gave me his personal cell number. How's that for excellent customer service? I may or may not be in Brooklyn any time soon because I was a tourist during this visit but if I am I'll definitely reach out to him and give his establishment another try.,3.0
"MEeehhh I want to love this place because it's in a really ideal spot for meeting up with people (since SO many trains converge around this area) but my experience overall was mediocre. While the staff was friendly and the backyard was beautiful, the old fashioned I got was terrible. large sugar granules settled into the bottom of the drink, and a large orange wedge was just dropped into the glass without any sign of muddling whatsoever.the best advice I could give is to order a spirit neat or on the rocks - they do have a nice (although somewhat limited) selection of scotch/rye/bourbon, and the food definitely looks on point.I think while chasing the last warm days of the season, this is a great spot for a quick drink or food, but I wouldn't recommend ordering cocktails per se.",3.0
"Hollow Nickel has two things that make a great bar - a good whiskey selection, and an amazing backyard. I've passed by this place many times while walking home and never really stopped in. But I had some time to kill and decided to take the plunge.They have a very respectable whiskey/bourbon/Scotch selection, all for very reasonable prices. Laphroaig was $12 and Blanton's was $13. I've definitely paid more for both.The backyard is pretty huge. It's nicer than 4th Ave Pub and is a lot more open. Great place to be during the spring or summer months.Sad that it took so long to get my ass over here, but I'll definitely be returning!",4.0
"I never rate places on Yelp. I only use it to find bars and restaurants near me. Tonight, I was moved to review a restaurant. My girlfriend and I were trying to find a place near Barclays Center to grab a bite and something to drink. The first place we went was packed (The Hollow Nickel). The second place we went only had a limited menu of bar snacks, that looked great but it wasn't really what we were looking for. I butted my way into a conversation between the bartender and another customer and it turned out the other customer owned The Hollow Nickel. I mentioned that we stopped by there first but that it was too crowded to find a seat. Without hesitation he offered to call the restaurant and bring us food to the bar where we were drinking. I ordered a burger and my girlfriend got the mushroom quesadilla. They were both perfect. The burger was cooked perfectly and the quesadilla was delicious. Does service get better than that? Probably not. Will I go back to both of these places? Most definitely.",5.0
"I came here for brunch with a friend. I enjoyed the breakfast burrito. My friend liked the scrambled eggs and loved the ""home fries."" Very cozy spot with friendly staff and delicious food. I'll definitely be coming back.",4.0
"I came here more than a week ago to celebrate my best friend's birthday and this place gave me the most unexpected experience ever. Coming here, I thought it was going to be like a typical restaurant, with a waiter/waitress taking you to your seat and coming to your table every 20 minutes refilling water and asking if your food was good. Instead, this place ended up being the most relaxing and freeing place to dine and drink.When we went into the restaurant, the bartender simply told us to sit anywhere and handed us the menu. We had to go up to the bar, just to order our food and drinks, which was I found surprising.We ordered nachos, burgers and french toast which all fell in the range of $11-20. The portion of the burger was pretty big with a side of fries. The nachos were one of the best nachos I have ever had, as it came with a container of guacamole, and salsa, which all had a hint of spice to it which gave it a kick of flavor. I particularly loved the french toast I ordered, as it was topped with berries and a side of maple syrup. The french toast was very rich in flavor and had the perfect texture, not too mushy in the middle and not burnt on the outside.If you are someone who is particularly into fruity drinks, I'd recommend getting the white peach sangria; it has a small kick of alcohol that kind of hit me a bit, but with an overall fruity taste. Food: delicious, portion is worth the moneyAtmosphere: very relaxed, color scheme of black and red (which I love)Service: majority of the time self-service, I had to repeat a few times my order of french toast since he did not hear me.If you are in the area of Barclay Center after watching a game or concert, I would recommend this place as it is spacious and not as crowded as other places in Brooklyn. One more perk, is that there is a beautiful outdoor setting to hang out or go for on a casual date.",4.0
"Nice bar and restaurant in the BK, close to the Barclay Center, which makes it nice to go after a game. Prices are relative cheap compare to other bars in the area and the city. I had the ommegang witte beer, which was really good and the wrap. The beer was $6 and the wrap with fries $10. Bill came to $16, taxes were already included I believe. Great place! I would like to give another try for the nachos and the burger to see how they are. Keep up the good work!",5.0
"We enjoyed dinner and drinks outside on the Hollow Nickel's back patio this past Friday evening. It's a casual place with a variety of beer options and comfort food choices. We enjoyed the massive burger and the sourdough grilled cheese, with the seasoned fries (so good!!) and the salad respectively.   All were well done and portions were very generous. Service was friendly but generally they encourage you to order at the bar as there is only one server that rotates around the restaurant and patio. Prices were very reasonable for the neighborhood. Great place for a bite before or after an event at Barclays (a couple blocks down from it along atlantic). Worth the visit!",4.0
"Based upon the name I thought this place was as empty as my soul. Or as hollow as my views on society. On the contrary however, it's packed. With lots of awesome things like, swell drinks, good people, delicious food, and chairs. Got to love chairs.I'd been meaning to stop by the Hollow Nickel for awhile but never got around to doing it. Always something came up. I had plans, or an emergency came our of no where, or the feds were onto my illegal wild animal trafficking. Typical things that pop up.In the past month or so I've been there for a few times. in particular for some happy hours. They were quite happy so there was no false advertising. $1 off all tap beers. As well as deals on well drinks. They also have a deal going around all the time. $6 beer and shot combo. It's a Narragansett tall boy, so while it's not my favorite beer it is a 16oz, and Evan Williams is pretty darn good for a well shot. If you like suffering and hate yourself you can get the deal with a Corona and a well shot of tequila instead. There's also a margarita special, you may want to inquire about. My favorite thing about the place is the food. I don't care for Jalapeno Poppers, but these are not ordinary poppers. They're almost more like fritters. Tasty tasty fritters. I also love their guac, fried pickles, and fries. And I don't normally like overly seasoned fries either, but once again this place just knows how to do it real well. The dipping sauces are fantastic. They got chipolte mayo. Cucumber mayo. Mayo mayo. I like mayo!There's lots of different seating, from a several stool tables in the front, a bar with a television, booths, tables in the back, and an outdoor area. Perfect for whatever size your party is. My one quarrel is the beer selection. It could be a bit more vast. And I don't think the price of the drafts are that great, but they're not awful either. I have to say their personal house brew is pretty good, and is only $5 bucks. They also make a solid Manhattan if you want to get all fancy. So if you find yourself strolling down Atlantic, this is a great option for a great time.",4.0
"My friend found this place on Yelp and decided to have happy hour/dinner here on a Friday evening around 6pm. Judging from the reviews and pictures, we decided to give this place a try. Once we stepped in, it was CROWDED. The only available seats we saw were by the window and seated ourselves. There were shot glasses and glass cups everywhere. No one came around to cleaning them so we just pushed them aside. There was a huge blackboard with a mini menu and also a small paper menu floating around from table to table. Went to the bar and ordered the turkey toastie for myself & the angus burger for my friend and drinks. Asked for a malibu bay breeze and blue hawaiian and the bartender that helped me said they don't carry malibu and I just settled for a cider. Waited on the blue hawaiian for a bit and she never came back with it. When I finally got her attention again, I asked her where was the blue hawaiian and her response was 'what's in that again?' I'm sorry, but how are you a bartender and not know what's in a blue hawaiian? When I told her she said they didn't carry blue curacao. Whoever she was, she must be new. I wish I got her name because she was clueless throughout the whole time I was there. I had to repeat my order to her twice and the order number twice. I told her I wanted the burger medium and it came out well done. The turkey toastie was your typical turkey sandwich drenched in butter. The fries that came with it were super salty. When we were finish, I went to close my tab and it took forever to get her attention. She looked over at me a couple of times and totally ignored me when I tried to wave her down and she decided to help others instead. Super annoyed, I just waved down another worker to close the tab for me. Overall, the worst experienced ever. The food was mediocre, the service was terrible, the selection was limited and it was disgusting inside. Save yourself the trouble and avoid this place. You'll probably have a better experience at Applebee's inside Atlantic Terminal.",1.0
"This bar has the three CB's that are necessary at a drinking establishment: Craft Beer. Cute Bartenders.

To safely get a barstool, I'd say arrive after 8 on a weekday.We had a couple beers (Sixpoint and Lagunitas) and ended up getting some food as well (quesadilla). Beers were $6-7, with some cans running at $4.While all the of previously mentioned were no different from a typical Brooklyn bar, the service here is awesome.

"Here's a list, in no particular order, of things I really dig about this place:- It's never crowded. Admittedly, I've never gone on a Saturday night, but every time I go, it's practically empty which means I get a seat and good service and I can talk to my companions in peace. I'm sure the owner would prefer it to be full all the time, but this is my perfect vibe right here.- The drink selection. Not the craziest most obscure craft beers, but you can definitely get something better than Stella or Guinness. Plus they serve this one brand of cider I love that for some reason I can't really find anywhere else, so good on them. Prices are decent.- Food. Pretty good for basic ""pub"" fare, especially their vegetarian options. Prices are fair.- Happy hour on weekends. Self-explanatory.- Killer backyard. Lots of seating, quiet, tons of shade, not swarming with mosquitoes. Like, I live 5 minutes away and have my own private yard, and still sometimes I'm like, ""I wanna go hang out in Hollow Nickel's backyard.""- Service. Friendly, funny, quick, they remember us even though we're semi-regulars at best. I like these dudes a lot.One star off because once my veggie burger was kinda dry and the margarita is really nothing to write home about.

"I've been to Hollow Nickel about a dozen times since it first opened. It started out a little rough around the edges (I can't even say why, I just didn't love it), but it has grown on me by leaps and bounds. A nice beer selection, decent happy hour, great food. I find myself drawn to it whenever I'm trying to figure out a good place to go with a group: the space in the back, as well as the relaxing backyard, are perfect for groups. A few weeks ago we managed to get a group of 14 in the back space comfortably. Even though it was a busy Friday night, the bartenders managed to get everyone served politely and promptly. I'm glad I kept coming back!",4.0
"I was a bit let down by my recent trip to Hollow Nickel. We stopped in around 9pm on a Friday looking for a low-key night and a casual bite. It was way more crowded than I was expecting, so there wasn't really a place to sit. I also hadn't anticipated such an off-putting crowd. Within minutes of being here, I had a menu swiped off my table and then someone else stole a chair we were using as soon as my boyfriend got up to place our order.I went with the burger and beer special ($10) which is quite a good deal, even if the beer is Narragansett. The burger comes with cheddar cheese, lettuce, tomato and onion. Even though it was a little dry, it was still pretty good! It didn't come with fries, but my boyfriend's chicken 'wich did. I had a few bites and it's a decent sandwich. The fries were probably my favorite part of the meal. They were crisp and flavored with pepper. Maybe appetizers are the way to go.The beer selection was unique. Not a large variety of beer to choose from, but they seem to go out of their way to have out-of-the-ordinary brands on tap. Prices were average.TL; DR: Hollow Nickel is aighttt.",3.0

"We stopped in before the Motley Crue concert at Barclays (obviously) and I will say I was super pleased with the entire experience.  It had the feel of a cool, rock bar, but wasn't grimy and the food was great.  The jalapeno poppers were the clear winners (they are like giant fried balls filled with cheese and spice deliciousness).  We got nachos, which were also great.  The beer selection was on point, servers were all cool and easy and attentive.  It wasn't mobbed,  but had it not been raining I would have loved to sit outback.  This will become a go-to for me for sure.",5.0

There was a woman walking around with free drinks to promote her company, and we weren't rushed at all (I believe we were there for at least 2 hours chatting)",3.0
"Here's a list, in no particular order, of things I really dig about this place:- It's never crowded. Admittedly, I've never gone on a Saturday night, but every time I go, it's practically empty which means I get a seat and good service and I can talk to my companions in peace. I'm sure the owner would prefer it to be full all the time, but this is my perfect vibe right here.- The drink selection. Not the craziest most obscure craft beers, but you can definitely get something better than Stella or Guinness. Plus they serve this one brand of cider I love that for some reason I can't really find anywhere else, so good on them. Prices are decent.- Food. Pretty good for basic ""pub"" fare, especially their vegetarian options. Prices are fair.- Happy hour on weekends. Self-explanatory.- Killer backyard. Lots of seating, quiet, tons of shade, not swarming with mosquitoes. Like, I live 5 minutes away and have my own private yard, and still sometimes I'm like, ""I wanna go hang out in Hollow Nickel's backyard.""- Service. Friendly, funny, quick, they remember us even though we're semi-regulars at best. I like these dudes a lot.One star off because once my veggie burger was kinda dry and the margarita is really nothing to write home about. But really this is more like 4.5 stars, because I'm THAT person on Yelp, and I really do like this place a lot.",4.0
"I've been to Hollow Nickel about a dozen times since it first opened. It started out a little rough around the edges (I can't even say why, I just didn't love it), but it has grown on me by leaps and bounds. A nice beer selection, decent happy hour, great food. I find myself drawn to it whenever I'm trying to figure out a good place to go with a group: the space in the back, as well as the relaxing backyard, are perfect for groups. A few weeks ago we managed to get a group of 14 in the back space comfortably. Even though it was a busy Friday night, the bartenders managed to get everyone served politely and promptly. I'm glad I kept coming back!",4.0
"I was a bit let down by my recent trip to Hollow Nickel. We stopped in around 9pm on a Friday looking for a low-key night and a casual bite. It was way more crowded than I was expecting, so there wasn't really a place to sit. I also hadn't anticipated such an off-putting crowd. Within minutes of being here, I had a menu swiped off my table and then someone else stole a chair we were using as soon as my boyfriend got up to place our order.I went with the burger and beer special ($10) which is quite a good deal, even if the beer is Narragansett. The burger comes with cheddar cheese, lettuce, tomato and onion. Even though it was a little dry, it was still pretty good! It didn't come with fries, but my boyfriend's chicken 'wich did. I had a few bites and it's a decent sandwich. The fries were probably my favorite part of the meal. They were crisp and flavored with pepper. Maybe appetizers are the way to go.The beer selection was unique. Not a large variety of beer to choose from, but they seem to go out of their way to have out-of-the-ordinary brands on tap. Prices were average.TL; DR: Hollow Nickel is aighttt.",3.0
"Love this place. Great decor, friendly bartenders, cheap happy hour, and delicious food. What's not to love? I had a $5 margarita and yummy fish tacos. And my friend and I sat there for like 2 hours afterwards just talking and drinking water, and they had no problems at all with that.",5.0
"Would highly recommend. Ginger toddy was unique and very well made, grilled cheese with bacon on sourdough was delicious. Casual vibe, playlist was great. Excellent spot for a meal and a couple drinks. Whiskey list was extensive and a good number of house drinks. I'll be back.",4.0
This is def one of my new favorite bars! So happy to have come across it on yelp.When I went they had an awesome hot spiked apple cider drink... Along with other drink specials that were awesomely priced. The food was good although some items seemed a bit overpriced. The burger and beer combo was a good deal!Bartenders were super friendly and attentive.Good mix of music was being played and the crowd was laid back and diverse.,4.0
"We stopped in before the Motley Crue concert at Barclays (obviously) and I will say I was super pleased with the entire experience.  It had the feel of a cool, rock bar, but wasn't grimy and the food was great.  The jalapeno poppers were the clear winners (they are like giant fried balls filled with cheese and spice deliciousness).  We got nachos, which were also great.  The beer selection was on point, servers were all cool and easy and attentive.  It wasn't mobbed,  but had it not been raining I would have loved to sit outback.  This will become a go-to for me for sure.",5.0

"The hollow nickel is the shit. I seriously love this place. My girlfriend found it randomly through Yelp, and we keep coming back. Doesn't matter what the original plan is, we always end up here. The staff is super friendly, and they have a great craft beer and cider selection. The food is great, especially the grilled cheese! When you come here, make sure you get a pickle back shot, they're brutal but amazing. I LOVE THE HOLLOW NICKEL! I'll be getting a t-shirt soon.",5.0
"Came by for a few drinks and a snack before a show at the Barclay's Center.  There is a varied list of craft beers on tap and the pinot grigio I ordered, though somewhat of a small pour, was alright by me.  My boyfriend & I shared the turkey melt, which was very simple and good.",3.0
"This place is really cute with a huge back yard, easy-going atmosphere and nice bartenders. Stand by the bar for a rowdier experience or go to the back where they have a couple tables intimately nested. They also have 2 4-seater booths opposite the bar that keep you in the action but let you sit and take a load off. I've been here with friends and co workers, but it would definitely be great place for post date drinks or a big crowd of people.",5.0
"Good hangout for beers and whisky.  Cocktails are not fantastic and the food is on the higher end of the bar grub spectrum, but still just that.  Nice that they have a back garden in summer, though the decor out there could be more atmospheric.",4.0
"Unpretentious, low key bar right on Atlantic Ave.Love the tin ceiling, booth seats and shelves with real books (yes, real!). There is also room on the back with more seatings and backyard, but it was reserved the night we were there, so I could not check it out. They have TV for all you sport fans!Good beer selection. Food is simple, but pretty great. Fries were good, and BLT was very, very nicely put together - perfectly toasted bread, thick-cut bacon, fresh tomatoes - delish!!! Now, someone please, please tell me the meaning of abbreviation on the mirror??? I will love you forever if you do!",4.0
"Fun spot for happy hour drinks and greasy food!  The prices are reasonable and they have a nice selection of beer (wines not so much but I was decently pleased with the $7 sauvignon blanc I ordered).  The food almost bumps this place up to 5 stars--fried pickles, fried jalapeno poppers, guac etc.  Those poppers were incredible--this was weeks ago and I can still remember them. Maybe it was just that I haven't eaten like that in awhile but honestly the dishes were great, in a friend food/death wish way.  There's a cute backyard too, which I'd like to check out one of these days.",4.0
"Just had drinks and appetizers so I'm not going to talk about what's exactly good to eat, but the guacamole was super tasty.Great spot with a LOVELY BACKYARD (which makes it reach the 5*!) - you gotta love it! Decent wine and nice staff. Thumb up.",5.0
"Great little spot. Good atmosphere and friendly servers, plus a fine happy hour.The kitchen was backed up when we went, so we had our drinks and left.

"Weak and weary from too much gaddamn fun, we stumbled upon this place, lured by the $5 margaritas sign. (They have other $5 drink deals too whuuutt).

We had a great chat with one of the bartenders when we were there and he even made us some delicious custom drinks that he made up on the spot. Small beer and wine list, but always a varied offering. For liquor, they definitely focus on whiskey though, so maybe pass this one if that's not your spirit of choice.Since I don't live in Brooklyn, the location is a bit out of the way for me.

"After attending a Yelp Elite event, two of my girlfriends and I were wandering along Atlantic Avenue searching for a bar and that bar was Hollow Nickel.  It was late Thursday night and it was perfectly quiet! The entrance was narrow with white twinkle lights and candles placed throughout the bar.  The dim lighting allowed for a romantic ambiance which I loved!  We were greeted almost immediately upon finding a nice table in the back.  I continued to marvel at how cozy this place was with their book shelves filled with books (shocking I know, but in a bar??) and a fireplace lit up with candles of different heights.  The wall above it seemed to be chalkboard but the walls in the bathroom were definitely chalkboard! Fun!My girlfriends and I just wanted a nightcap and ordered a couple drinks.  I ordered a Shirley Temple, because I'm responsible and had important work to do the next morning, while my girlfriends had beer, because they didn't have urgent work due in the morning. We all decided to share seasoned fries with melted cheese and I'm pretty sure we were disappointed with how it turned out.  I thought it hit the spot but my friend brought up a good point that the cheese should have been flavored and that in lieu of gravy, we should not have been charged for chipotle mayo sauce...Oh and the seasoning on the fries was just dill. Plain ol' dill.Our server was very attentive if not overly attentive.  He was very patient with us and tried his best to accommodate our requests.  Pretty solid service and experience overall despite the gravy/chipotle mayo and tasteless fries incident.  The location is great since it's very close to the Atlantic Ave station by the way.  Despite that, willing to try other food they may offer and will definitely visit this place again.",4.0

"Quaint, cute, dark little wood-grain joint on Atlantic Ave near the Barclay Center. Probably the best bar of its type in the area (locals are gradually losing out against the wave of corporate-chain bars and commercialization brought by Barclay's). But this is a pub that still has its 'regulars' and is making new ones frequently. VERY clean, neat, and swept. No dust anywhere.  No jukebox, but there's a sweet little backyard and there's also a bookshelf of used books. More bars should have this. Bring in a couple of paperbacks you've completed and pick up a few new ones to walk away with. Overall, quite a fun interior: magically, the tables and booths are designed and arranged in such a way that allows people to circulate and for diners to 'nestle closely together' without feeling cramped. The 4-top tables are also very compact, though still comfy for a group. And the deuce tables have the perfect dimensions. You can talk at normal volume without feeling as if your conversations are intruding on other tables. Other pubs should take note! Food: creative/classics. Hearty portions. Extremely well handled. Particularly well done are the fried dill pickles. A crispy, munchy, tart, treat. Draughts: 4-5 mixture of imports and craft brew. Prices: very reasonable. No sticker-shocks.Service: here is where there's a *slight* letdown. A busboy from the kitchen is the only food runner; not a real waiter and there's often confusion because the bartender takes the orders at the bar. The resulting confusion means that you can wait a while for your food, and it may get sent to the wrong table.Crowd: scruffy but convivial. Pseudo-chummy. Bathrooms are well-tended to; you can see that someone is on top of germ issues. They're obviously scrubbed (with good strong bleach) every day. There's coathooks under the bar--now that is a very welcome touch. Its amazing how many bars overlook this touch.Key fact: this is perhaps some kind of LGBT bar? It may not be apparent at first. It's a friendly and clubby atmosphere in general--good for everyone, either way--so no reason to give this aspect any concern or regard. Its a mellow and toasty place to get a buzz on.",4.0
"My guy, Kyle, and I were in town for a concert at the Barclays, figured we'd have time to grab some grub beforehand. Saw all the great reviews for this place on Yelp and decided to give it a go.Oy.First, we walked in to some staring. No greeting, no menus, no ""sit anywhere you like."" Okay. Whatever. It's a casual pub.So we seat ourselves at a table. And wait. And wait. Finally, Kyle goes up and asks the guy who'd been staring at us and even walked past us a coupla times for menus.At this point, we figure we're gonna have to do everything but cook the food ourselves, so Kyle goes up to the bar to place our order. Meanwhile, guys over at the next table are wondering what's taking their chips and guac so long. When the server comes around with chips and guac for another table, and they ask where theirs are, he basically berates them for not having a number. Because you're just supposed to know that you need a number to get your order without anyone offering you one, apparently.Thirty minutes go by before we remind our server that we placed an order. We're going to have to scarf at this point. Good thing Kyle paid already, right?Yyyyyeah, no. Server drops half my sandwich on the floor when the food finally comes out.No immediate apology. No offer to make another or reduce the charge. We have to initiate that whole thing when the server comes around a while later and asks if we got everything we need. With no sense of irony.I'm like, ""Well, I'm missing half my dinner, but otherwise, all is peaches, I guess.""It took another fifteen minutes to get the bill adjusted. And I'm still hungry. It's really a shame, too, because the food was really good.",2.0

You can talk at normal volume without feeling as if your conversations are intruding on other tables. Other pubs should take note! Food: creative/classics. Hearty portions. Extremely well handled. Particularly well done are the fried dill pickles. A crispy, munchy, tart, treat. Draughts: 4-5 mixture of imports and craft brew. Prices: very reasonable. No sticker-shocks.Service: here is where there's a *slight* letdown. A busboy from the kitchen is the only food runner; not a real waiter and there's often confusion because the bartender takes the orders at the bar. The resulting confusion means that you can wait a while for your food, and it may get sent to the wrong table.Crowd: scruffy but convivial. Pseudo-chummy. Bathrooms are well-tended to; you can see that someone is on top of germ issues. They're obviously scrubbed (with good strong bleach) every day. There's coathooks under the bar--now that is a very welcome touch. Its amazing how many bars overlook this touch.Key fact: this is perhaps some kind of LGBT bar? It may not be apparent at first. It's a friendly and clubby atmosphere in general--good for everyone, either way--so no reason to give this aspect any concern or regard. Its a mellow and toasty place to get a buzz on.",4.0
"My guy, Kyle, and I were in town for a concert at the Barclays, figured we'd have time to grab some grub beforehand. Saw all the great reviews for this place on Yelp and decided to give it a go.Oy.First, we walked in to some staring. No greeting, no menus, no ""sit anywhere you like."" Okay. Whatever. It's a casual pub.So we seat ourselves at a table. And wait. And wait. Finally, Kyle goes up and asks the guy who'd been staring at us and even walked past us a coupla times for menus.At this point, we figure we're gonna have to do everything but cook the food ourselves, so Kyle goes up to the bar to place our order. Meanwhile, guys over at the next table are wondering what's taking their chips and guac so long. When the server comes around with chips and guac for another table, and they ask where theirs are, he basically berates them for not having a number. Because you're just supposed to know that you need a number to get your order without anyone offering you one, apparently.Thirty minutes go by before we remind our server that we placed an order. We're going to have to scarf at this point. Good thing Kyle paid already, right?Yyyyyeah, no. Server drops half my sandwich on the floor when the food finally comes out.No immediate apology. No offer to make another or reduce the charge. We have to initiate that whole thing when the server comes around a while later and asks if we got everything we need. With no sense of irony.I'm like, ""Well, I'm missing half my dinner, but otherwise, all is peaches, I guess.""It took another fifteen minutes to get the bill adjusted. And I'm still hungry. It's really a shame, too, because the food was really good.",2.0
"What a great spot that a friend of mine took me to after brunch down the street from here. It has a decent sized backyard with large tables and plenty of seating to fill up with friends, and enjoy the outdoor weather after such an intensely awful winter. The interior is cozy, and the bartender (a cute auburn guy with a beard) who made the most fantastic White Russians that I ever had (and yes, he made them the right way! Layered, not mixed!). Good vibe, especially when in good company! Definitely returning here. Bring friends, and tip well.",5.0
"Went to Hollow Nickel for some pre-concert drinks and grub (first time). Awesome backyard garden. Great happy hour specials. Large beer/whiskey menu. YES!!!!There were some initial concerns with the service and delays getting food out. When these concerns were expressed, the manager treated us very kindly and addressed our concerns with total professionalism. The atmosphere was wonderful, the food was delicious, and the prices were great! What started off as a rocky night was completely reversed by the professionalism and grace of the manager (and hey, who doesn't have an off night now and then, right?!?). I would definitely go back and recommend this place for happy hour, dinner, socializing, etc... AND THEY HAVE A LARGE GARDEN! SCORE!",4.0

"A great bar located on Atlantic Avenue. Went to this bar shortly after Atlantic antic and still was able to have the six point Atlantic antic beer.The bartender was friendly, enjoyed conversation and polite. There was a fresh indoor ambience that was interesting and woodsy. The back area was a little mosquito driven but still a fantastic set up and very relaxing.",4.0
"Great bar for a low key night with a group of friends. Head straight to the backyard for that chill Brooklyn ambiance. Pros:- cute rustic decor- very affordable (had a burger for $12, sangria for $8, they had specials going on like a shot & a beer for $6)- great food- you can very well hear each other even on a Saturday night, which not many bars offer- also on a sat night it was not extremely packed, which made the experience a lot more pleasantCons:- the only thing I wasn't a fan of is that there's no waiter service - you have to go to the bar every time you want to order something.Overall, very much recommended!",4.0
Great service and perfect setup for a large group!  We used the back space to host a pre-new years party before heading to barclays for a concert. The space was decorated for us and easily fit our group of about 20. The prices were reasonable and Travis did a great job of making sure we were taken care of. We will definitely use this bar the next time we are in the area for a barclays event. Highly recommend!,5.0

"I held a boozy birthday brunch for a friend of mine in the back garden area of Hollow Nickel, and it was awesome.  First of all, Nichols is amazing. He made everything easy-- from the planning beforehand and the service during, right down to the processing of the payment at the end.  It all could have been overly complicated and a pain but Nichols made sure it was not.  He and his staff were friendly, efficient, honest and accommodating.  The food and drinks were good too! I had the BLT, which I thoroughly enjoyed-- thick crispy cuts of bacon, fresh slices of juicy tomato and crisp lettuce all on top of two perfectly toasted slices of sour dough bread. The bread had some sort of mayo on it that made it different (in a good way) than any other BLT I've had (can't remember what the flavor of the mayo was, sorry, maybe avocado?).  By all accounts everyone else enjoyed their food too. Oh and the pickle backs! First time I've had them but I enjoyed those as well.All in all, a great experience hosting a birthday brunch at Hollow Nickel. Good times. Highly recommend.",5.0
"This is a really nice looking bar with a cool vibe and a really warm, cozy, inviting feel to the place thanks to the decor, the candle lit tables, the bookshelves full of *GASP* REAL BOOKS, the homey chairs and the modest fireplace.Now that I've gotten most of the pros out of the way I can focus on why I'm giving this place 3 stars. The beer selection is ok. Fantastic maybe in the Mid-west, but this is Brooklyn - the supposed land of awesome beer outside of Europe - the beer list is meh. So is their wine list (if I remember correctly...which I'm pretty sure I do), the cocktail list is pretty great, over-priced for where we are, but still pretty damn delicious looking.I ended up getting a Hoegaarden (a refreshingly crisp beer brewed in Belgium and consumed by me many, many times) and my friend ordered an IPA which she may have not been too crazy about - but at this point we had certainly had enough to drink from a bar hop and a Yelp event - lol.My other friend raged hard on the Shirley Temples because she was responsibly trying to not get wrecked since she had a job interview in the morning. Smart lady.We did have the munchies and wanted to try something off the menu so we settled on herb-crusted cheese & gravy fries. Oh surprise, they were out of grave (it's like barely 9ish mind you, who's out of gravy????? With this dish being the only thing on the menu that required gravy how could they be out? I take it everyone comes here for the gravy fries and only the gravy fries...I asked for ranch sauce *in place of the gravy*, a friend asked if they had chipotle mayo and they said they'd make some for her - then I asked for regular mayo and *surprise* they ran out. Ugh.So the fries come (after a decent waiting period, thank goodness for my beer) and they the top layer (and only the top layer) is covered in some flavorless white cheese. At first my girlfriends liked them, I pointed out the cheese wasn't good and so they both sampled the cheese without fries and came to the conclusion that I was right.The fries alone were pretty damn delicious, real win here - but later when we got the check we realized we were charged for our ranch. We explicitly asked if we could get it *in place* of the gravy they ran out of and were told yes, mind you they also ran out of mayo. How does one run out of condiments? Our waiter was super attentive though so it's tough to blame him because his service was spot on. I blame the kitchen folks or whoever does the shopping - buy more mayo, more gravy making ingredients (assuming you're not buying pre-made gravy, le sigh) and a better quality melty cheese - that white stuff was not good and actually took away from the fries.I'd come back here if in the neighborhood, but I wouldn't go out of my way to leave my nooks in Queens or Manhattan to come here if I didn't have to :-/.",3.0

"I'm pretty sure I ended up here randomly one night years ago with my sister. After our friend decided that he was going to drive everyone home and that there were not enough people to fit in the car, we walked into here and awkwardly were left to chit-chat with his Russian friends. Zoom forward two years later and I'm here again after drinking from a keg in a fake soccer field. I did not need another drink last night by any means at all. But I had one. It was a something IPA and ended up being more expensive than I had wanted to pay. Though, our waiter was a weirdo and wouldn't give us a beer menu and I'm not sure if one even existed. I like the ambience of the place. There's a bookcase filled with. . . books. Chuckles. And a chalk board for writing and doodling in. . . chalk. Low romantic lighting. We split an order of cheese fries that came with really weird not delicious at all cheese. It tasted kind of like melted feta. And it was supposed to come with gravy. But they didn't have gravy. And they gave us some kind of chipotle mayo instead. That they charged us extra for. Which makes no sense because we didn't get any gravy that we were paying for anyway. Sigh. I can't have everything perfect. A decent bar in a convenient location when there aren't many on the way to the train along Atlantic Avenue.",3.0

"This is a very solid place, just a whisper shy of five stars.The atmosphere is very cozy, staff friendly, jokes on the menu funny. The drinks are inspired. The designer seems to like sweet flavors, cinnamon, ginger, and honey all show up multiple times. No complaints here.The food ranges from excellent to decent. Edamame hummus is a great idea, and although the menu *seeeems* to indicate that the pita chips are baked elsewhere, if I had not read that with my own eyes I'd have sworn to you that they were hand-made on the spot by spell-wielding pita sorcerers who were using their powers for good. Just a little too salty though, guys, if I may weigh in.Fried mac and cheese was also fantastic, a little sweetness in the crunchy breading, perfect.The only beef (heh) I have is with the sliders. Portobello slider was too tangy.. maybe it marinated too long? Pork and beef sliders were serviceable.

"Hollow Nickel has become my neighborhood spot to lay low, grab a good drink, tasty snacks and good conversation with a friend or two. Dark, cool and casual the front has mini booths and a wrap around bar while the back has benches for larger groups. A flush bookcase filled with games lines the wall between the two spaces along with the bathrooms. The food, is delicious. Especially the mini burgers and skinny, sexy onion rings. These two finger foods are a must for bursts of flavor all over your taste buds. The cocktails, they are strong! Too strong in-fact but at $5-$6 bucks a pop how can one complain? I'm not, however a big fan of their white wine selection. It's a bit too sour for my taste. Overall, I dig this place. Each experience has definitely been a good one. Oh and let's not forget, they have a back yard too. Great in the warmer months.",4.0

"I'm pretty sure I ended up here randomly one night years ago with my sister. After our friend decided that he was going to drive everyone home and that there were not enough people to fit in the car, we walked into here and awkwardly were left to chit-chat with his Russian friends. Zoom forward two years later and I'm here again after drinking from a keg in a fake soccer field. I did not need another drink last night by any means at all. But I had one. It was a something IPA and ended up being more expensive than I had wanted to pay. Though, our waiter was a weirdo and wouldn't give us a beer menu and I'm not sure if one even existed. I like the ambience of the place. There's a bookcase filled with. . . books. Chuckles. And a chalk board for writing and doodling in. . . chalk. Low romantic lighting. We split an order of cheese fries that came with really weird not delicious at all cheese. It tasted kind of like melted feta. And it was supposed to come with gravy. But they didn't have gravy. And they gave us some kind of chipotle mayo instead. That they charged us extra for. Which makes no sense because we didn't get any gravy that we were paying for anyway. Sigh. I can't have everything perfect. A decent bar in a convenient location when there aren't many on the way to the train along Atlantic Avenue.",3.0
Came here twice for a birthday and going away party. Good places to have a party if you put in reservations. Place doesn't get too crowded. The best drink here I think is called the Atlantic.,4.0
"Nice little space close to Atlantic ave subway station.  A convenient meeting spot to visit your friends who live out in brooklyn (but what kind of friends live in BK anyways AMIRITE?).  What I like about the Hollow Nickel is their nice draught selection, their ability to make me a decent Old Fashoo, and the friendliness of their staff.  It also doesn't get uber crazy on weekends like some of the more popular brooklyn or manhattan establishments-- in other words, low-key.",4.0
"I love this place! Aside that I waited 9yrs for a decent bar to open, this place has so many good things to offer. Hollow Nickel's service is outstanding every bartender and wait staff is above and beyond nice. Food is the perfect bar food. Booze has a great selection if seasonal beers, bourbons, whiskeys and delightful cocktails. Bartenders are really knowledgeable and helpful. Please visit this local wonder!",5.0
"Why haven't I been here before. Tiffany was a great bartender and the wings were good. Great Sunday Happy Hour and fun crowd. A very neighborhood place but 'outsiders' like me were every welcome. Great selection of wine, beer and cocktails! Stop in--you won't be sorry.",4.0
"This is a fantastic neighborhood spot! The vibe is relaxed, the drinks are generous, and the bartender is super friendly. The crowd is a nice mix of folks, and there are homemade french fries and chips!!! Yummm!The bar owners put major detail into build out of the space, it's gorg! And they've got a semi-private back room and a snazzy back yard to boot! Looking forward to the addition of food items on the menu!!",5.0
"This is a very solid place, just a whisper shy of five stars.The atmosphere is very cozy, staff friendly, jokes on the menu funny. The drinks are inspired. The designer seems to like sweet flavors, cinnamon, ginger, and honey all show up multiple times. No complaints here.The food ranges from excellent to decent. Edamame hummus is a great idea, and although the menu *seeeems* to indicate that the pita chips are baked elsewhere, if I had not read that with my own eyes I'd have sworn to you that they were hand-made on the spot by spell-wielding pita sorcerers who were using their powers for good. Just a little too salty though, guys, if I may weigh in.Fried mac and cheese was also fantastic, a little sweetness in the crunchy breading, perfect.The only beef (heh) I have is with the sliders.

"A neighborhood gem- Really low key and cool bar.

"I live in the neighborhood, and have been to hollow nickel a few times at this point.  Last Sunday a few friends and I decided to do some day drinking in the garden and for the first time ever I was thoroughly disappointed with my visit.  The bartender that afternoon was just absolutely terrible.  The guy was rude from the get go.  I walked up to the bar and asked him how he was doing with a smile and literally got a grunt in response.  A little later, I went back to the bar in search of a menu and now there was another woman behind the bar, hoping that she might be in better spirits than her fellow worker I inched towards her direction.  She was chatting up someone at the bar who was clearly a friend and proceeded to ignore me.  I stood patiently, waiting for her to turn her gaze to me..and when she finally did, she just looked at me and continued her conversation with her friend.  Reluctantly, I went back to my grumpy friend to retrieve a menu.  I'm not sure if the employees that day were just super unhappy, or if the bar has taken a turn for the worse but I don't think I'll be back to find out.",1.0

Also, I saw that they have a full kitchen, so that must mean delicious snacks to come. They used to run the old Flying Saucer café, come in to see how they revamped the space completely.

"My first experience at Hollow Nickel was pretty perfect, and I can't wait to return. My fiance and I hosted our engagement party on Saturday May 4th, reserving the back part of the bar ahead of time with about 25 people or so. Working with Lori to arrange everything, Hollow Nickel offered us incredible flexibility and just made it as nice and easy as possible. The night of the party could not have been better. First off, the bar is gorgeous, and their back room was just what I had pictured when looking for a casual but elegant place to host our event. When we arrived they had put down reserved signs and candles on the tables that were ours, and introduced us to our server for the night. Our server was absolutely awesome! He took care of our large group all night (about 5 hours) without a hitch, and was lovely to each and every guest (so much so that all my friends are still praising him!). The bartender also did a fantastic job because every drink was perfect (not too sweet, not too stingy on the alcohol). About midway through the night the kitchen surprised us with enough complimentary fries and chipotle mayo on the house (which could not have come at a better time). Everyone was so lovely, thoughtful, attentive and overall just made it an awesome experience for us and our guests. I would recommend Hollow Nickel to anyone in a heartbeat!",5.0

"Oh my. Where do I even begin? I've never written a review before but this place was so God-awful that I feel it's my sworn duty to warn others. We met up with a group of friends there this past  Sunday afternoon, which also happened to be Cinco de Mayo.  I've been to just about every bar/restaurant in this area and, having never been, I was excited to try a new place. The six of us got there around 3pm and I immediately found it curious that we were the only people in the bar. It wouldn't take me long to figure out why. The main reason we went here is because we heard they had a pretty cool patio, which, in fairness, they do. We took a peak out back but it was too chilly so we grabbed a table inside. Our bartender, who was either stoned or just simple, walked over to our table and informed us that they were out of all quesadillas and tacos, on Cinco de Mayo no less. Oh the irony.  OK then. Since that pronouncement effectively wiped out half of the menu, we decided on the beef sliders, wings and mac and cheese.  In the meantime, we peruse the specialty cocktail menu. The drinks look interesting but are quite expensive, all ranging between $9-$12. Unless you're a master mixologist or I'm at the Clover Club, that's way too pricey for Brooklyn.  I immediately find it interesting that not one of the drinks lists the type of liquor used in the cocktail, they just state bourbon or vodka or what not. For the price though, I'm sure it has to be top shelf, right? I go to the bar to order a drink and ask the bartender (I have to go to him, it appears that, even though we're the only people in the entire place, he has long forgotten about us.) I settle on an Old Fashioned and proceed to order. Me: ""Excuse me, can I get an Old fashioned?  And what kind of Bourbon do you usually make that with""? Him: ""Usually Makers or Bulliet"". Fine, I'll have one with Bulliet. Ten painstaking minutes later he finally finishes making my drink. Him: ""That'll be $13"". Me: ""Uh, it says $9 on the menu"". Him: ""But you asked for it with Bulliet"". Me: ""Uh no. I asked you what type of bourbon you usually make it with"". Him: ""ooohh. I misunderstood you. Usually people ask for either Maker's or Bulliet. If you don't specify then we use the house bourbon, which is Fleishmanns"". Amazing. $9-$12 for a drink made with the cheapest swill on Earth. Feeling my blood pressure rise, I leave Spiccoli and take my now $13 drink back to the table to wait for our food. A few minutes later he brings it out (since he's the only one working he's also the waiter/bus boy etc). At least I'll get to eat, I mean how can you screw up bar food? Pretty badly it would appear. The beef sliders were horrific. The bun was dry and stale, the tomato was cut so thick it was the size of the burger, and the beef was the driest, blandest tasting meat I have ever eaten. Now I'm not one to take food back, but this was so bad that after one bite I immediately did just that. Absolutely dreadful. The wings were no better. Flavorless, unevenly cooked and accompanied by two wilted little pieces of celery and a thimble full of blue cheese. The mac and cheese tasted like it was baked with cheese whiz and came piled with burned bacon on top. Also dreadful. At this point Spiccoli came over and told us that he has to leave, as he's late to his other waitering job in the city, but would we mind settling up with him right now. Sure thing pal. We paid our checks and ran out of that place, all vowing never to return. In short, (I know, too late), this place uses cheap liquor in their ""specialty cocktails"" while charging premium prices, the food was disgusting, it seemed as if the menu consisted of whatever they picked up at Shop-Rite that morning, and the staff is clueless. It's probably a good idea not to open a bar unless you have a clue what you're doing. Stay away. Stay far away! You have been warned.
