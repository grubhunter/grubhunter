"Wow... Found this gem by way of a friend who had said this was his favorite pizza spot in New York.  Since we had just moved a couple of blocks away, we tried to walk in, but the wait was like 2 hours so we passed on it.  A couple of days later, we decided to do take out and man o man, this place is probably the best pizza I've had in New York thus far.  We ordered a large pie, got half sausage and half mushroom.  We also tried the cheese calzone and it was banging.  I don't really know how to explain it, but the pizza crust is exactly how I like it, thin, tasty and baked perfectly.  The tomato sauce is extremely fresh and they use high quality cheese.  I have been to many pizza joints here in New York and when I use to live in East Village, my go to spots were Motorino or Luzzo.  I've also been to other top pizza spots like Roberta's, Rubirosa, Julianna's, Marta, Grimaldi's, Lombardi's, Lil Frankies, etc, however I have yet to try Franny's and Di Fara.  But until I get to try all the top spots, Lucali is now my #1 spot.",5.0
Good pizza ! BYOB!! I suggest you to go there at latest before 5 to put your name on the list. Otherwise you can't get in when they open at 6!Actually i went there before 5 but I couldn't get in! Waited till 7:30. Their pizza is all good but i think there are many alternatives in Manhattan if you just want taste good pizza.,4.0
"If waiting for food is not your thing or if your not interested in excellence then Lucali is definitely not for you. There is a chain pizza in the area. If you are a pizza buff then you'll understand wait times and excellence. Every discussion about pizza usually ends up with either or both parties telling one another they don't know what they are talking about, their pizza spot is the best in the city. Usually one of the original three places are talked about in Brooklyn. When it comes to brick oven style neapolitan, heaven forbid you tell a 40something Born And Raised Brooklynite that there may be a place better than Totonnos, Grimaldi's or the original Patsy's in dumbo and you'll get a fuhgeddaboudit. Just even trying to get them to go somewhere new is like pulling teeth. ""Roberta's? Where? Bushwick!? No way!"" is the usual answer I get with that 40something crowd. I'm not saying those other places aren't good because they are. They are actually all great. I grew up on the original Patsy's in dumbo. I have spent many hours of my life waiting on those lines.Now for the waiting part. Do Not come here hungry. You will end up Betty White hangry. If you are starving and want to try Lucali's get there at or before 6pm to add your name and number to the list. Then go grab dinner somewhere else in the area. No seriously. You will wait an hour or two for pizza depending on the day and time. Go to Frankies 457 order a couple of appetizers or a pasta dish at the bar, have a negroni then head back over to Lucali's and do some hipster watching for the next half hour. You can get lucky though, it has happened to us. A few occasions we have made pit stops on our way to the city and got lucky with a half hour wait. Rare but happens. We eat a pie and rush off to make our real dinner reservations.We usually go to Lucali's as two couples or more so we can order at least two pies and a calzone. Which comes to the excellence part, Lucali puts out the most beautiful, simply delicious pie I've ever eaten. EVER! For me It's like going to a pizza parlor art museum where your able to eat the masterpieces every time you go. Excellence every time. Simple yet phenomenal. The crust is to die for. Perfect char. Perfect crust bubbles all around. Amazing sauce, the best cheeses. Even the calzone are museum quality. We love garlic so we order one with garlic sometimes. Try it. Off the Charts. Lucali should be a must visit stop on any pizza tour. Bucket list must eat. 6pm till 10pm six days a week.Owner Mark and staff are very friendly. Lucali is definitely one of my choices for death row last meals.",5.0
"*suggestion: call a day before to make a reservation. pizza lived up to its hype, but not so much the calzone. MAKE SURE TO GET GARLIC AND TOP IT OFF WITH BASIL! It's also BYOB and the nice hostess offered to leave it in the fridge while we waited a bit outside. Ugh, loved their customer service!!Came on a Friday night without reservation and was told they'd have a seat for me and my friend an hour later. We should've  made a reservation the day before but luckily the wait wasn't too bad considering how busy it was. Lots of people were waiting on line which is always a good sign. Service was excellent-- waitress was attentive and super kind. The hostess was also so considerate and nice. We were seated close to the door and she asked if it was too cold and let us know that there was a heater next to me. We ordered a small calzone with garlic and a large garlic pie with half pepperoni, mushroom topped with fresh basil! Pizza was comparable to pizza from Naples, Italy. Ingredients were extremely FRESH, the crust was doughy yet thin, and the fresh basil was a perfect cherry on top. Also ordered a small calzone which wasn't anything too special.",5.0
"Hands down the best pizza I've ever had my whole life! But the wait could be a little intimidating, we make efforts to arrive around 4:30~5pm and RSVP before they begin service at 6pm. If you arrive any later than 5, expect the reservation to stretch into 7 o' clock. So get here early or don't come at all. slap yo self, cuz the wait only gets longer. This is Jay Z and Queen B's fav restaurant which means that we share the same taste in food. Which make me cool enough to hang with them. Which will make me famous.... *wake up! They only have simple personal pies and calzones in the menu. Open kitchen. BYOB. Superb service. An all around 5 star, well-deserved! Step aside Grimaldi's and Spumoni your qualities have deescalated, Lucali's have yet to let me down",5.0
"When Beyonce and Jay Z have a favorite pizza place, you go to it. (If you watch SNL, you know what will happen if you defy Queen B.)Wednesday night at seven? Completely, manageable wait. I shudder to think what it would be like on a weekend at that time. I would say stick to the weekdays if you're in a time crunch.You essentially build your own pizza with real ingredients. Everything is so fresh (like Bey). It's the benefit of only really doing three things (pie, small calzone, large calzone). My friend and I got the large pie with garlic, parm, basil, and pepperoni. The best simple pie that I've had in New York to date.The service is great. Everyone is really friendly. You can tell that aside from the deserved hype, this is a family spot.It's easily the freshest pizza I have ever had. Highly recommended and probably the best pizza spot in Brooklyn. Tip: CASH ONLY. and BYOW -- bring your own wine. (another tip: if you're exiting off the subway at Carroll St, there are liquor stores nearby where you can swoop a bottle to go with your dinner.)",5.0
"Yup, it's amazing pizza as everyone points out.  Bring a bunch of tasty wine, knock back a couple of pizzas and have a most perfect night.",5.0
"Is it the best pizza in NYC, which would essentially make it the best pizza on planet Earth? Yes, maybe! If it's not the best, it is pretty close. Obviously, this sort of comparison and measurement isn't simple. Base pizza is $24 and $3 per topping, which isn't inexpensive, but it's 8 slices, so it is easily a meal for two . We got pepperoni (the only meat option available) and hot peppers. We called at 6pm to make a reservation - which is more like putting your name on a wait list which is first come, first serve. Being a rainy Wednesday evening, we got here at 9:15pm, for our 9pm 'reservation' but were seated within a couple of minutes. Once the menu was explained to us and we ordered, the pizza arrived within 5 minutes which was so amazing because we were hungry. Meanwhile we enjoyed our BYOB wine! Can't beat that!Plus Beyoncé, Jay-Z, and Beckham (google it) have eaten here, so...",4.0
"It was OK, but I don't get all the hype. I'd rather stand in line for Di Fara, at least I wouldn't have to go through this ridiculous ritual of showing up an hour before the place opens to secure a seat for two hours after it opens. I mean the tastes were good, but the menu is ridiculously limited to two primary items with only about six toppings/fillings, and it's BYOB.",3.0
"Some of the best pizza in the City, coupled with classic ambiance, the satisfaction of being able to see the pizza really being assembled and a BYOB policy that isn't just fleeting and you get one of the all around best pizza pie experiences for that old school style.Just go early...during the week...and don't dawdle too long in there ;)PS--Don't forget to look up on the wall at the specials board!",5.0
"I came here with my best friend while in town, he was determined to get me to try ""the best pizza you'll ever have in your life"" so of course I obliged.    He called and they said ""just come on in,"" but we didn't leave until maybe an hour later because I wasn't hungry. They had a girl standing outside with a clipboard taking names like it was club with a rope behind to keep people out while she went inside. I didn't appreciate this concept, but it made sense once I got inside (it was extremely small). My guess is it can only accommodate about 20 people. It's BYOB, so we grabbed a bottle of wine and went down the street to the bar to have a few drinks before dinner while we waited. The only place to wait was outside and it was cold so we weren't having that. When we finally got in, we were seated and my best friend told me ""there's no menu"". Mind officially blown. They only serve 2 things: pizza and calzones. I just knew I was going to get prosciutto with arugula but NOPE they only have pepperoni, so I said shit lemme get ughhhhh ""the pepperoni with every vegetable you have"" and it was delicious! I do wish the onions were cooked a little more, I was scared I was going to have dragon's breath afterwards...and I did. I didn't realize the kitchen was within our eyesight until half way through dinner. They make everything out in the open and you can see them place the pizza in the brick oven. Note: they have a larger location in Miami as well, with an expanded menu. My best friend was able to meet Jay-Z & Beyoncé while here because apparently they frequent the restaurant.",5.0
"Best pizza I've had! The pizza is thin, crispy, chewy, and so good! The fresh mozzarella and other cheese or what else is on the pizza is so good!!! The original with basil is so yummy!!! They give you extra sauce on the side and if they forget then just ask cause they're super friendly and the sauce it delicious!!! The add on toppings are also good! I don't know if it's just me but the hot pepper flakes were really good! The hot pepper flakes I've tried were rarely spicy but these hot pepper flakes had a kick even with a little sprinkle.

Lucali uses fresh ingredients & for those who want to explore more than cheese on their pizza, they have toppings like garlic & basil (no additional charge), shallots, pepperoni, & a few others. The pie is thin with a crispy crust & the calzone is soft & creamy. Adding garlic to it made it even more tasty. You also get a bowl filled with the secret sauce to dip your pizza crust & calzone in. Some people freak out when they see the prices on the chalkboard menu but the tax is already included & it's so worth the splurge. The added bonus at Lucali is that it is BYOB: beer or wine.

"How can you tell that a pizza place is legit? Well, besides the 4.5 star average rating, it's when you walk up and see David Chang sitting outside.Lucali was one of the few pizza places left on my bucket list, and to say I saved the best for last would not be hyperbole.Some things to know about Lucali:-Be prepared for a wait. Luckily for us, they quoted us an hour and a half, but called us back after 20 minutes to tell us something had opened up. There are a few bars around that you can go to to kill the time (the hostess recommended Bar Bruno).-They have one pizza for $24. You can add whatever fresh toppings they have available for the day at $3 apiece. Garlic and basil is free.-The pizzas are HUGE.-It's BYOB and cash only.-It's delicious.One pie is almost too much food for two people. Luckily, it's thin crust and not too doughy, which is how I like it. Another half minute in the oven for a crispier crust would've done wonders though.Anyway, the toppings we chose were beef pepperoni, mushrooms, garlic and basil. Mushroom slices were lengthwise and long, and the pepperoni portions were generous and gave a nice spicy kick to it. The garlic was mixed into the sauce so you would bite into a garlic patch every now and then. Basil was just put on top after it came out of the oven, which is the way it should be (though I wish they cut the pie after putting the basil on, but that's being very, very nitpicky).Sauce was great, and they also gave us a side of extra sauce and cheese. Not sure if they mistakenly thought we ordered a calzone, or if that's a new thing they do, but it was nice to have something to dip your crust into. By itself, the tomato sauce has a nice tang to it.Is $30 expensive for a pie? Sure. But when you factor in BYOB and the fact that it's a gigantic pie, you don't feel cheated at all.Service was quick, and they have some lookers on staff.The owner Mark stopped by to ask us how everything was, which I appreciated. He was also in the kitchen doing a lot of the legwork too.In terms of Brooklyn-style pizza (that's the large slices and fresh ingredients), it's hard to beat Lucali. I don't often pull the Brooklyn card, but you should take my word for it because I've lived in Brooklyn my entire life.That's a lie. I actually pull the Brooklyn card all the time.But yeah, go to Lucali.",5.0
"This place is altogether deserving of 5 stars.   Yeah, they might be overdoing it a bit wit the rusticity, but why not? Some of the reviewers here simply don't get this place.  The point is simplicity. There are two items on the menu and even the customizable one only has a few options.    But each option is great.   Allow me to clarify.  This is a limited menu, but each ingredient is top notch.  The mushrooms are fresh and sliced thinly, the pepperoni is spicy, the basil is sweet and crisp.  Then there are the primary ingredients.  The crust here is perfectly crisp and slightly cartelized on the outside and chewy on the inside.  The sauce is tangy---some people complain it isn't seasoned--well, it tastes like tomatoes... like it's supposed to.  And the cheese is incredibly good.   I should say cheeses...  The calzone really is genius.  You have the almost sweet ricotta cheese inside (along with mozzarella), and then you dip it in tangy marinara with sharp parmesan.  If you appreciate the simple flavors, its really good.So despite the hype, a large pizza and a calzone (a small one is big enough for two) run only $44.And on top of all that, the service was really johnny on the spot.  AND, I was seated almost immediately.   Five star experience all-around.Oh, and the waitress was a fox--hope I run into her again someday.",5.0
"Probably the best pizza I've had anywhere, especially in NYC. Maybe not for people who really love deep dish pizza though because this is a very thin crust pizza. My boyfriend and I tried coming here last year but got there too late after they ran out of ingredients. So this time, we made sure to be waiting as soon as it opened - got there around 5:40 PM on a Thursday night and was able to nab a table for 3 as soon as it opened at 6 PM. People were RSVP-ing for 7 PM tables before it even opened though, so make sure to get there early!We ordered 2 margherita pizzas with garlic and 1 with pepperoni and mushrooms. They have a small ingredient list of what is available that night. The crust is super light and fluffy with the right amount of crunch factor. You can tell they use very good, fresh ingredients. My tiny, tiny complaint was I wish they would rip off the basil leaves off the stems, because I think all the pizzas come with basil, and they are just haphazardly thrown on like an afterthought. We took the extra pie and a half leftover home and ate it again as a late night snack. Super good!",5.0
"Absolutely, hands down, the single best pizza place I've been in NYC. And it's not just the pizza. It's the beautiful space in which it is created. It is the lovely and friendly staff who work there that are so hospitable, fun and passionate about their menu. And the line outside ... as well as the regular celebrity guests like Beyonce and JZ ... testify to its greatness. The pie comes with the basic crust, cheese and sauce, then the guest can create their own pizza with the toppings of their choice. My friend and I stuck with the basic margherita with basil on top, and it was phenomenal. The crust here is very thin, so much so that it is flimsy in comparison to other NYC crispy crusts.

"This is the Beyonce and Jay-Z favorite pizzeria. My co-worker was telling me about this place months ago and we finally find a time to go together.  WE put our names 30 minutes before the opening and had to wait 2hours.

Lucali is one of those places that you just have to try once to be hooked and wait in line for 4+ hours again & again. Now for the life of me I can figure out why I find this pizza to be so amazing and one step above the rest . The crust is not the doughy chewy traditional Personal Poe crust or the same size. I would say lucali is the traditional Brooklyn carol gardens pizza.,5.0
"How can you tell that a pizza place is legit? Well, besides the 4.5 star average rating, it's when you walk up and see David Chang sitting outside.Lucali was one of the few pizza places left on my bucket list, and to say I saved the best for last would not be hyperbole.Some things to know about Lucali:-Be prepared for a wait. Luckily for us, they quoted us an hour and a half, but called us back after 20 minutes to tell us something had opened up. There are a few bars around that you can go to to kill the time (the hostess recommended Bar Bruno).-They have one pizza for $24. You can add whatever fresh toppings they have available for the day at $3 apiece. Garlic and basil is free.-The pizzas are HUGE.-It's BYOB and cash only.-It's delicious.One pie is almost too much food for two people. Luckily, it's thin crust and not too doughy, which is how I like it. Another half minute in the oven for a crispier crust would've done wonders though.Anyway, the toppings we chose were beef pepperoni, mushrooms, garlic and basil. Mushroom slices were lengthwise and long, and the pepperoni portions were generous and gave a nice spicy kick to it. The garlic was mixed into the sauce so you would bite into a garlic patch every now and then. Basil was just put on top after it came out of the oven, which is the way it should be (though I wish they cut the pie after putting the basil on, but that's being very, very nitpicky).Sauce was great, and they also gave us a side of extra sauce and cheese. Not sure if they mistakenly thought we ordered a calzone, or if that's a new thing they do, but it was nice to have something to dip your crust into. By itself, the tomato sauce has a nice tang to it.Is $30 expensive for a pie? Sure. But when you factor in BYOB and the fact that it's a gigantic pie, you don't feel cheated at all.Service was quick, and they have some lookers on staff.The owner Mark stopped by to ask us how everything was, which I appreciated. He was also in the kitchen doing a lot of the legwork too.In terms of Brooklyn-style pizza (that's the large slices and fresh ingredients), it's hard to beat Lucali. I don't often pull the Brooklyn card, but you should take my word for it because I've lived in Brooklyn my entire life.That's a lie. I actually pull the Brooklyn card all the time.But yeah, go to Lucali.",5.0
"This place is altogether deserving of 5 stars.   Yeah, they might be overdoing it a bit wit the rusticity, but why not? Some of the reviewers here simply don't get this place.  The point is simplicity. There are two items on the menu and even the customizable one only has a few options.    But each option is great.   Allow me to clarify.  This is a limited menu, but each ingredient is top notch.  The mushrooms are fresh and sliced thinly, the pepperoni is spicy, the basil is sweet and crisp.  Then there are the primary ingredients.  The crust here is perfectly crisp and slightly cartelized on the outside and chewy on the inside.  The sauce is tangy---some people complain it isn't seasoned--well, it tastes like tomatoes... like it's supposed to.  And the cheese is incredibly good.   I should say cheeses...  The calzone really is genius.  You have the almost sweet ricotta cheese inside (along with mozzarella), and then you dip it in tangy marinara with sharp parmesan.  If you appreciate the simple flavors, its really good.So despite the hype, a large pizza and a calzone (a small one is big enough for two) run only $44.And on top of all that, the service was really johnny on the spot.  AND, I was seated almost immediately.   Five star experience all-around.Oh, and the waitress was a fox--hope I run into her again someday.",5.0
"Probably the best pizza I've had anywhere, especially in NYC. Maybe not for people who really love deep dish pizza though because this is a very thin crust pizza. My boyfriend and I tried coming here last year but got there too late after they ran out of ingredients. So this time, we made sure to be waiting as soon as it opened - got there around 5:40 PM on a Thursday night and was able to nab a table for 3 as soon as it opened at 6 PM. People were RSVP-ing for 7 PM tables before it even opened though, so make sure to get there early!We ordered 2 margherita pizzas with garlic and 1 with pepperoni and mushrooms. They have a small ingredient list of what is available that night. The crust is super light and fluffy with the right amount of crunch factor. You can tell they use very good, fresh ingredients. My tiny, tiny complaint was I wish they would rip off the basil leaves off the stems, because I think all the pizzas come with basil, and they are just haphazardly thrown on like an afterthought. We took the extra pie and a half leftover home and ate it again as a late night snack. Super good!",5.0
"Absolutely, hands down, the single best pizza place I've been in NYC. And it's not just the pizza. It's the beautiful space in which it is created. It is the lovely and friendly staff who work there that are so hospitable, fun and passionate about their menu. And the line outside ... as well as the regular celebrity guests like Beyonce and JZ ... testify to its greatness. The pie comes with the basic crust, cheese and sauce, then the guest can create their own pizza with the toppings of their choice. My friend and I stuck with the basic margherita with basil on top, and it was phenomenal. The crust here is very thin, so much so that it is flimsy in comparison to other NYC crispy crusts. The red sauce was delicious, and they served it on the side for adding to the pizza or, in my case, for dipping my crust.Truly the best, and it's one of the places I'm always sure to take my guests because it doesn't get much better or more local than this.",5.0

"Great food!  Staff and owner is especially very nice and helped to make the experience better in spite of the long wait time (4 hours) in cold weather!  On Sunday January 31st, I took my girlfriend, the (3.5 y.o) baby, my bro, and my mother here.  Would be my second time here.  We arrived an hour and a half early (thought I saw much earlier), so we wandered around.  When we passed by the front, there was already a waiting list and we found that we wouldn't get seated at 6PM opening, but instead at 7PM.  Briefly spoke with the owner, and moved on.Come 7PM, we come back and wait for our turn.  And wait...and wait.  As time passed, we were informed that the table we were to be sat at had customers that wouldn't leave and kept ordering more.  They were being hurried along (to their displeasure and without us saying anything about it) so we could be seated.  I feel a little bad about their ""shortened"" experience, but we had a 3 y.o. with us.  Anyway, 8PM (nearly 4 hours waiting to eat since mistakenly arriving early) we were able to sit.  They gave a little pizza dough to my baby daughter, and she had a blast playing with it.  Our pizzas arrived quickly, and one was on the house as a thanks for being patient.  The staff and owner was truly nice, and in a ways apologetic.  The gesture was really appreciated!  It helped to make the food taste even better than what the other reviews describe.I'd like to make it a point to stop by here whenever possible just because the service and hospitality is amazing.  It helps that the food is worth the long drive!",5.0

"Hands down my favorite pie in the city! Fresh, high quality ingredients and despite all the hype, it still retains its old-school feeling charm.

He's also a nice guy, posing for photos with people who ask and shaking hands. He got himself a big-time winner with this traditional pizzeria that only sells pizza and calzone with limited traditional toppings (no Hawaiian pie here folks so don't bother asking). We love that it's BYOB and that it's so close by. We get our fix on week nights and don't even bother on the weekends for the 2+ hour wait!

Hands down, the best pizza we've had!  It's thin crust and made with fresh ingredients.  It's not saucy with just the right amount of cheese that doesn't overpower the toppings.  Overall, definitely worth the drive to Brooklyn!On the other hand, the calzone didn't quite live up to the hype.",4.0

"Came here for the pizza and the slim chance to be in the same room as Beyonce.Left with an immense food coma and the best pizza experience EVER (not exaggerating).Survivor's Guide to Lucali:- THE WAIT: They open at 6, but they take names down for seatings beforehand. We came around 5:10pm and got a table for two for their first seating. People who came right at 6pm were told to come back at 8pm. - BOOZE: Buy booze after you've put your name down at the store on Court Street nearby. We got $10 screw cap red wine, because we are classy and poised people.- BABIES: I don't have a baby, but apparently everybody else did. True to the neighborhood, almost every other diner came in with a toddler/infant. They didn't allow strollers into the restaurant and asked to keep the babies on their laps.There are only a couple of toppings, and most of them aren't meat. Which is fine, because you wouldn't want anything that would compromise their superb crust. We got shallots and mushrooms (the garlic and fresh basil came free). They were thinly cut and just barely cooked, which added a wonderful crunch and burst of flavor to the sauce and fresh mozzarella. The crust is light, chewy, and crunchy -- somewhere in the middle of thin crust and normal. The pizza is by no means dense -- the 2 of us split one pie.We then got the calzone, which our stomachs certainly didn't need but our taste buds did. Thank you fellow Yelpers for suggesting this. The calzone is hands down the best I've ever had -- light crust filled with fistfuls of fresh ricotta. I don't care if you're already too full from the pizza -- you must get the calzone, too.",5.0
"What can I say? If you have the patience for the 2 hour wait (or get lucky like we did) then you need to try this place. Toppings vary from day to day, based on whatever fresh ingredients they can get their creative hands on. The interior is simple yet romantic and inviting. The pizza has a very healthy amount of homemade sauce and they give you extra sauce in the side to dip your crust into. This place is BYOB so bring your own wine!",5.0

They have a small array of toppings which are so good as well. And always fresh.! Not to mention that you can see the master pizza maker craftily making your pizza to perfection. I really can't wait to go here again.",5.0
"You know when you wait almost three hours for pizza and have no ragrets after, because it's so good? That's Di Fara! But also Lucali, because I planned ahead, put my name on the list at 6, and had a delicious dinner at 8:45. One of the best pies I've had with no frills needed - just a really, really good pie with red sauce, basil, cheese, pepperoni (all beef?!), onions, and garlic. Get the pizza. You won't be sorry. Ps the service is amazing, they filled my cup of water while it was still in my hand, and having read that it sounds like a bad thing but they pulled it off.",5.0
"Lucali is good but I'm not sure I'd go out of my way to come here. They have some sort of crazy following. You really gotta come here like 30 minutes before it opens to avoid that 2 hour wait or so. The pizza is solid and has really fresh ingredients. They don't have many options which is sometimes a good thing so they can focus on what matters. Just pizza. I loved the fresh cheese, shallots, garlic, basil, pepperoni. It's really filling because it's not exactly thin crusted by any means. Is it the best pizza I've ever had? Probably not, but it's worth a try for sure.",4.0

"I had lost faith in finding the perfect slice, but then I went to Lucali's.  Not only did Lucali bring my love of pizza back to life, but it also introduced me to the most perfect calzone.  My new favorite place for good, no frills, pizza.  Crispy thin crust and delicious fresh toppings.  Get the calzone with garlic and pepperoni, you won't regret it.",5.0
"Came here for the pizza and the slim chance to be in the same room as Beyonce.Left with an immense food coma and the best pizza experience EVER (not exaggerating).Survivor's Guide to Lucali:- THE WAIT: They open at 6, but they take names down for seatings beforehand. We came around 5:10pm and got a table for two for their first seating. People who came right at 6pm were told to come back at 8pm. - BOOZE: Buy booze after you've put your name down at the store on Court Street nearby. We got $10 screw cap red wine, because we are classy and poised people.- BABIES: I don't have a baby, but apparently everybody else did. True to the neighborhood, almost every other diner came in with a toddler/infant. They didn't allow strollers into the restaurant and asked to keep the babies on their laps.There are only a couple of toppings, and most of them aren't meat. Which is fine, because you wouldn't want anything that would compromise their superb crust. We got shallots and mushrooms (the garlic and fresh basil came free). They were thinly cut and just barely cooked, which added a wonderful crunch and burst of flavor to the sauce and fresh mozzarella. The crust is light, chewy, and crunchy -- somewhere in the middle of thin crust and normal. The pizza is by no means dense -- the 2 of us split one pie.We then got the calzone, which our stomachs certainly didn't need but our taste buds did. Thank you fellow Yelpers for suggesting this. The calzone is hands down the best I've ever had -- light crust filled with fistfuls of fresh ricotta. I don't care if you're already too full from the pizza -- you must get the calzone, too.",5.0
"What can I say? If you have the patience for the 2 hour wait (or get lucky like we did) then you need to try this place. Toppings vary from day to day, based on whatever fresh ingredients they can get their creative hands on. The interior is simple yet romantic and inviting. The pizza has a very healthy amount of homemade sauce and they give you extra sauce in the side to dip your crust into. This place is BYOB so bring your own wine!",5.0

"Holy delicious phenomenal pizza batman!! My husband and I have been dying to come here after hearing about this place from friends, recommendations from blogs and restaurant critics, and celebrities who frequent. We read reviews and knew we needed to get here about an hour before it opened if we wanted the first seating.  We walked over and anxiously got in line at 5PM. Around 5:15PM, the hostess came out and took our names and told us to be back around 5 minutes to 6PM (when they open). We just took a stroll around the area but there are a couple of bars close by as well if you'd like to stop and get a drink. We came back at the appropriate time and was seated a few minutes after 6PM. The inside is decorated in an old world Italian farm house style.The menu is very small (Large pie, garlic and basil come with it for free, you can get onions, shallots, peppers, or pepperoni for an extra charge). My husband and I already knew what we wanted (just garlic and basil) so we ordered as soon as we sat down. The restaurant is BYOB but they serve soda if you desire. We got more and more excited as we waited for our pizza, desperately hoping that it lived up to the hype. Our pizza came, we had our first bite.......lived up to the hype. God this is a good pizza. Fresh ingredients, amazing flavor. I could not stop eating it. I ate probably 2 times as much as I normally do because I just couldn't stop. Everyone should come try this place but heed my warning, plan to come early and then go grab a drink at a bar while you wait til 6PM. When we came back at 6PM, people we're being told they would be seated at 8:30 or 9PM. If you come later and try to get carry out, you will get the same story. If you plan, an evening at Lucali will go smoothly! It's also cash only. LOVE THIS PIZZA!",5.0
"Had a pizza and two calzones between us. Superior in every way. Wood fired, perfect crust.

"I went to Lucali by myself on a business trip.  I just got on the train and went.  Maybe I should have called ahead.  I arrived to find a full dining room, a crowd standing outside, and a rope across the front door.  I guess this is to keep a non-stop parade of people checking in for a table.  The place is fairly small.  And there is no bar - where I generally find a seat right away when eating alone.  In fact, there is no alcohol.  But it is BYOB, which I found out the hard way, but lucked out somehow.  More on that later.  I waited about 40 minutes for a table and the hostess graciously called me on my cell when my table-to-be had their check.  So I was able to walk around the beautiful neighborhood that Lucali sits in, while I waited for my table.When I was sat I noticed the incredible relaxed vibe and super warm decor.  Stacks of wood for the wood burning oven, candlelight, wooden tables, and generally warm colors.  Very comfortable neighborhood feel.  There is no menu.  They have pizza and calzones.  The available ingredients for that day are on a chalkboard out front.  And repeated by the friendly staff.  That's it.  Simple and one of the best pies I've ever had.  I got peperoni and shallots, fresh basil and garlic.  It was made practically right in front of me at a table that nearly sits right in the dining room, and came out in 5 minutes like a good pie should.  Perfect crust, very fresh toppings, and an overall quality as good as it gets.  Remember this is a cash only joint.  And BYOB.  OH, when I ordered my pizza the waitress walked away without offering me wine.  No red wine with my pizza?  I called out to her as she walked away, asking if I could see the wine list.  That's when I found out about the BYOB thing.  :(  Well the table next to me heard this exchange and by the time the waitress returned with my water - about 30 seconds later, I had a bottle of wine on my table.  Well about 1/3 of a bottle of wine.  The lady at the table next to mine handed me her bottle of wine with a ""I've been there"", and pulled another one out of her purse.  Saved by another super kind New Yorker!  :)Great night.  Great dinner.  Great restaurant.",5.0
"Kind of annoying ""reservation policy..."" if you even want to call it that. But if you live in the area I recommend calling as close to 6 as possible.

The only other time I've had calzones to order was in my grandmother's kitchen...and my Grandma makes some serious calzones. I've only gotten plain, but the larger will easily feed 4 people.The pizza is good but there are just so many solid pizza places in NYC. I like my pizza thin crusted and crispy,  and I find Lucali's to be sort of soggy. If you're not careful when serving a slice, the whole thing will flop over and your cheese is on the table. Not gonna lie, can't say I wouldn't pick that cheese right back up, but still... floppy pizza is not my thing.The basil and garlic is a must. I find myself suddenly loving basil and garlic just because it's free and plentiful. I normally wouldn't cover my pizza with it but at Lucali's it's just how it's done.",4.0
"We went during the week on a Thursday night around 7. When we got there , there was no line but the place was full so we waited outside for a few minutes since a table was leaving. As other yelpers have noted, this a small space where they only serve pizzas and calzones. What I will address right up front is that while the pizza is delicious, you NEED to order the calzone. I'm not even a fan of calzones to begin with but this food made my eyes roll back in my head. It made me even forget that it doesn't have any alcohol available. It's about a 15 minute subway ride from Manhattan (depending where you are) and then another 15 minute walk through a very nice neighborhood.  It's also cash only so be prepared.

Asked and answered.Attorney: Your Honor, I am just trying to determine whether the pizza was just good or great. Judge: You may proceed. Attorney: So, was the pizza great. Erica: Yes, it was great. Spectacular. Attorney: So what you're telling me is that despite the ridiculous, calculated wait for a table, despite the tiny selection, despite the difficulty of making a plan to come here, you still think that Lucali's is not overrated, is definitely among the best pizza in New York, and you would come here over and over again if you had the patience and planning skills to do so, Ms. Erica?Erica's attorney: Objection!

And I cannot leave out how delicious the actual pizza was! The combination of the brick oven fired dough with THE SAUCE topped with cheese and juicy sliced portobello mushrooms, garlic, and basil This place definitely lives up to the hype. Highly recommend it if you're looking for an authentic NY pie experience!",5.0
"On a recent Tuesday afternoon at a Brooklyn courthouse, our heroine was being deposed on her thoughts about Lucali.Attorney: And tell me, Ms. Erica, how long did you wait to get in to Lucali?Erica: About two and a half hoursAttorney: Does the whole thought of going there and making an entire plan to actually be able to eat the two basically dishes on the menu tire you out before you even begin?Erica: Yes, that's pretty accurate. Attorney: And the last time you were at Lucali's, did you enjoy the pizza?Erica: I did, yes. Very much so.Attorney: Would you say that this is a good pizza?Erica: Yes, I would.Attorney: And is it safe to say, going a bit further, that it is even great pizza?Erica's Attorney: Objection. Asked and answered.Attorney: Your Honor, I am just trying to determine whether the pizza was just good or great. Judge: You may proceed. Attorney: So, was the pizza great. Erica: Yes, it was great. Spectacular. Attorney: So what you're telling me is that despite the ridiculous, calculated wait for a table, despite the tiny selection, despite the difficulty of making a plan to come here, you still think that Lucali's is not overrated, is definitely among the best pizza in New York, and you would come here over and over again if you had the patience and planning skills to do so, Ms. Erica?Erica's attorney: Objection! Leading the witness!Erica: Yes! OK! I love Lucali's pizza! It's ridiculously good even if I won't go there as often as I would if there was not an inhuman wait. Is THAT what you want to hear?Attorney: No further questions, your honor.",5.0
"Not quite a solid 5 but definitely a solid 4.5 star.Decor: 4/5-almost too dim, I was falling asleepService: 4/5-The wait for 3 people was 90 minutes but remember, this place is BYOB. -The hostess came by and asked if we had ordered yet. We told her we finished the pizza in less than ten minutes. She was shocked (and I hope impressed) with our Asian efficiency.Food: 4.5/5-We immediately ordered a large with mushrooms and to our amazement, the pizza was on our table, piping hot, in less than ten minutes! -All we could say after each bite was ""Amazeballs."". Yeah, it was pretty amazeballs. -The thin crust was fluffy yet crispy though not as crispy as Di Fara's. -The cheese and mushroom do slide around a bit but the combination of thin crust with chopped garlic just made each bite a flavorbomb.",5.0
"This pizza was hyped up to me by my friend all weekend while I was visiting NYC, so I was a little skeptical that this place could live up to the hype (it rarely does).  And yet despite my Chicago pizza bias, I will have to say this is one of the best pizza's I've ever had.  The balance between the dough, sauce, cheese and ingredients are spot on.  The ingredients are very fresh and the baby basil really complements the pizza.  We had to put our names down and leave for a couple of hours but it's definitely worth the wait.  We had two pizzas between four people and it was well over enough.  Bonus for it being BYOB.  Highly recommended.",5.0

"So good. They only have pizza and calzones, with rotating lost of toppings. Which makes them very good at making pizza and calzones. If you like mass amounts of delicious cheese then you will adore the calzone. Great fresh, right out of the oven food. Sauce ladeled to your plate on the side. Byob too. Can't go wrong.",5.0
"Awesome pizza, but the wait is horrible. We went there around 7pm on a Sunday. They don't take reservations and was told the wait is about 3 hours. There was no way we were going to wait for that long. We ended up ordering pizza to go and ate the pizza and calzone at home. Pizza was great. Thin crust w flavorful tomato sauce and generous amount of fresh basils. It probably would have been much more tastier if we had it at the restaurant, as while the pizza sat in the box, it lost some of the crust crunchiness. Calzone was ok. I thought it had too much ricotta cheese. I would come back here during off hours when the wait is not too long. FYI: they are BYOB.",4.0
"After hearing about how Jay-Z and Beyonce love this place I just had to come try it out. We ordered the calzone and a large pie with half jalepenos and half shallots. The prize of the dinner was the calzone. The calzone is worthy enough to be on my best thing I have ever eaten list. The large calzone is a meal for one alone. The dough for the calzone is cooked to perfection. A slight chew to the crust and does not get soggy from all of the gooey cheeses within. I don't know what combination of cheeses is but Please do tell Lucali's. The blends of cheeses they use just melt in your mouth and hit all the right notes on your taste buds. Also, get a side of tomato sauce! Take a little bit of calzone and dip it in their legit tomato sauce and it's GAME OVER, except in a good way. The tomato sauce is lightly seasoned as to keep the actual flavor of the fresh tomatoes intact. The pizza on the other hand was meh. The ingredients were fresh but personally I do not like cracker-like crusts. Also, I like basil but the huge basil leaves are a little much. I would prefer if the basil leaves were cut into smaller shreds to avoid having to devour an entire basil leaf. The place is a smaller establishment. A nice dimly lit setting that's good for a date and in a nice and quiet area. Interesting how you can see the cooks making the pizzas in the dining area. BYOB is a major plus. Service was great.I will be back for the Calzone!",4.0

"Those hoping to pick up a pie to go, be warned.

"Pizza is good, calzone is great. Crust is a bit dry, which happens to produce an outstanding calzone that isn't bogged down by a shiny/buttery outer layer, but rather just a perfect combination of tons of cheese (and toppings) and a solid wrapper. The pizza itself is not bad, but I'm not as obsessed with it as everyone else. I think it fares better with a few toppings (peppers and onions for example), otherwise it really needs very ample amounts of the basil, garlic, and some red pepper to shine. As it is, not an outstandingly flavorful experience and perhaps too much of the bread. The calzone, IMO, is dramatically better than other joints in the city. The pizza, while excellent, is less obviously the king.Waits/prices/cash only aren't the best things in the world. My tip?

THE BEST PIZZA IVE HAD IN MY LIFE!!! Adorable little spot. Always a wait. We were 4 people and ordered the original pie with garlic and basil. It was huge with 8 slices and they give you a side bowl of marinara sauce! Garlic haters don't bother having this. There are tiny pieces of fresh garlic on the pizza AND in the side marinara sauce. They cook the pizza in a brick oven with all of their ingredients freshly chopped and serve in plain view. Order the pepperoni on the side if you want to add it because it comes out a little crispy. The people working there are awesome and the owner was the most pleasant man ever! I will come back always!!! No alcohol served so BYOB!,5.0
"My boyfriend and I came here for the first time with a friend of ours on a recent Saturday night. Our friend had warned us that we would need to arrive when it opened in order to avoid a long wait, so we showed up at 6. Little did we know that people start putting their names on the list well before they open at 6, so there was already a 2-hour wait when we arrived. We were shocked, but put our name and number in anyway and headed off to a nearby bar to kill time. Still no call by 8, but we headed back anyway to see what was what. We were told that they were waiting for a 3-top to pay, and we would be next. Another 30 minutes elapsed (fortunately it was nice out, so sitting outside to wait wasn't a big deal), and we were finally in!At this point, we were so hungry that we all felt like the food better be amazing in order to justify the wait time. Our friend looked around and noticed that some people were eating meatballs, which weren't on the menu. He asked the server about them, and she said they were something people had ordered off the menu. We asked if we could try one, and she reported there was one left and it was ours. I realize it was just a meatball, but let me tell you, this was probably the best meatball we had ever eaten (along with the marinara sauce and basil). As we were scarfing it down, the chef came over to ask what we thought. He was thinking of putting it on the menu officially and wanted feedback. Needless to say, we had nothing but good things to say about it. We ordered two pizzas--one with pepperoni and mushrooms and the other with artichoke hearts, garlic, and basil. If you order two or more pies (at a small table), they bring them one after the other. The pepperoni and mushroom came first, and it was truly delicious. We all agreed that it made the wait worthwhile. The second pizza was just as good. There were only three of us, but we finished both pizzas. They're very thin, and not as filling as you might expect, so I would recommend ordering more than you think you need.To sum up: yes, the wait is interminable, but if you plan for that and know that your meal will be worth the wait, you won't be disappointed. This is definitely the best brick oven pizza I've ever had.",5.0
BEST pizza in NYC. What more can i say! Fresh and super delicious ingredients. Their plain margherita pizza is the best. Simple sauce with fresh basil and cheese. Yumm! The crust is super crispy and light. Loved the plain calzones too. We dined in with a 3 year old and the chef provided her with a ball of dough to roll and pizza sauce. She created her own mini pizza. He then baked the pizza specially for her. I thought that was a super warm gesture. Full marks to their customer service!It's a BYOB but they do have some beer and soda in case you forget to bring your own. We love the place and keep going back for more!,5.0

"Let me preface this review with the fact that I'm someone who really, really hates long lines and waiting for food. That being said, Lucali is worth the trek out to Brooklyn and worth the many, many hours of waiting. Unlike some of the places in the city where I really just don't understand the wait time (cough ippudo cough), Lucali is worth every minute of your precious time. The great thing about Lucali is that you can actually go do other things while you wait. They will call you when they are ready. There's a really cute wine bar a few doors down where you can sit down for a glass of wine while you wait. Or you can stop by Momofuku Milk Bar, a short walk away, and grab some pre-dinner dessert while you wait. Come to think of it, once, I bought some delicious bread at a nearby bakery and then sat down and had an entire pre-dinner dinner at another restaurant before Lucali (yes, I understand that this is not typical behavior for someone about to stuff their faces with pizza, but keep in mind that this is me haha). The key takeaway here is that you should expect a long line, so get here way in advance of the restaurant opening to make sure you get a place. They suggested at least half an hour before the restaurant opening. If the wait to eat in the restaurant is too long, you can also wait for pizza to go. Bear in mind that even this to go wait can still be quite long. So if you've actually gotten this far down, you're probably wondering what the big deal is about this place. Well, Lucali IS a big deal. They serve the freshest, most delicious pizza I've ever had in MY ENTIRE LIFE. I can't exaggerate how much this place kicks Grimaldi's booty. Every day, the toppings you can choose from changes because they source the freshest possible ingredients, which differs on a daily basis. Everything about the pizza, from the crust to the cheese to the toppings is perfection. I would recommend getting any meats (Italian sausage and pepperoni were both delicious) and mushrooms and shallots were great. Plain cheese with basil is absolutely divine. To top it off, this place is also byo so make sure to bring your own bottles of wine!",5.0
"This is such a beautiful experience, from the ambience to the food. It's dim, candlelit, intimate (the kitchen where the pizza and calzones are made is right in front of you), with wonderful vintage music -- as a result, it feels dreamlike. And the pizza is the best I've ever had.FYI: BYOB",5.0

"Grimaldi's and Spumoni Gardens overrated. Lucali's what is left of the trios in Brooklyn remain strong. I remember Lucali's being closed for a short period a couple years back because the owner and the chef suffered an injury. I was a little skeptical about returning but it's Lucali's, they never seem to disappoint. Been coming here for some years now, and I obviously cannot come every night since the wait can be up to hours at a time for a small table. The trick is to get there before they open for service(5pm?) and put your name down until you return. The mister and I usually park along Henry St at around 3:30 rush to write our name down for the next available slot, take a stroll down Cobblehill and return at around 5:30 in time for our pizzas. Service: ever so attentive and professional Food: that's a no-brainer, for us to drive down from CT to get our fix. Cleanliness:A++Ambience: intimate, lots of candles, open kitchen. Great spot for dates.",5.0

"The best pizza experience I've had in my life thus far. Call me a pie-ous follower of the holy deity that is mr. lucali. I did my research for spot on pies in brooklyn, and skipped grimaldi's to come here instead--BEST DECISION. This place is beautiful because of its simplicity. They have a no-nonsense menu, and probably no more than 20 ingredients in their entire kitchen. Ok, so that might be an exaggeration, but this is what I feel like pizza should be like-- margarita with maybe some mushrooms and shallots if I'm feeling extra risky. The reason why people line up a good hour before doors open for this pace is because they deliver absolute perfection. It's a holy trinity-- dough, Sauce, and toppings, all done exactly right. The ingredients are very blatantly the freshest it gets, and you won't leave a dingle crumb behind because it's so darned good.",5.0
"Holy moly, mother of all that is holy. This place. Just, THIS PLACE. From the vintage cash register,  to the pulley bathroom flush system, this place SCREAMS beauty. Everything is out in the open, the food, the cooks, the ingredients. They roll the dough with a wine bottle, that alone is awesome. But the food is great too! The prices: meh, definitely up there for pizza, but then again, this isn't pizza, it's God's version of pizza. The way that pizza was meant to be. There is ALWAYS a wait. There are NEVER reservations, and don't even ASK about delivery, that's not happening. You get there, you put your name on the list, and you wait. Take a walk around the area while you do so, this also happens to be one of the most beautiful areas of Brooklyn, too. Bottom line, go here.",5.0
"You know you should think twice about a place this overrated, where the first question is ""have you been here before?"", as in, we do things our way here and you'd better like it. I live a few blocks from here and have eaten their pizza as takeout. Tasty stuff, not as good as Grimaldi, though the basil & garlic is a nice touch. But is it a fair comparison? This kind of pizza is best enjoyed seconds from the oven...So to settle the score when I finally went to check them out, the waitress announced that they were out of pepperoni. Out of pepperoni!?! What kind of self respecting pizza joint runs out of pepperoni? It's like an Inuit in winter saying he can't build an igloo, since he's out of ice.To be continued...",2.0
"awesome pizza. probably my favorite pie in new york. good gracious its good. service is great, its byo alcohol, its a nice and quiet place. and yeah..these guys cook a mean pizza. they do it the right way. its more of a purist pizza. everything is on point. get the calzone and get the margherita. you wont be disappointed. and if you are, i definitely would not trust your palette (sorry). only downside is no reservations and pending which day, it can be a bit of a wait. but other than that, i dunno what else to tell yall...just go. you wont regret it.",5.0

The crust is thin and the ingredients are so fresh. The gooey center in the calzone is just heavenly. There is usually a wait because the place is small, but it's well worth it.",5.0
"I can't wait to go back! The pizza was AMAZING, fresh and cooked just right. It a tiny little place, with very limited tables and space, and don't take reservations. You have to be there super early to get a table. The place opens at 6pm so be there at 5pm if you want a table right away. Weekends are super busy. Also you can BYOB. They only have pizza and a calzone with ricotta and mozzarella. They serve you watermelon afterwards. Very cute quaint spot in BK :)",5.0
"Grimaldi's and Spumoni Gardens overrated. Lucali's what is left of the trios in Brooklyn remain strong. I remember Lucali's being closed for a short period a couple years back because the owner and the chef suffered an injury. I was a little skeptical about returning but it's Lucali's, they never seem to disappoint. Been coming here for some years now, and I obviously cannot come every night since the wait can be up to hours at a time for a small table. The trick is to get there before they open for service(5pm?) and put your name down until you return. The mister and I usually park along Henry St at around 3:30 rush to write our name down for the next available slot, take a stroll down Cobblehill and return at around 5:30 in time for our pizzas. Service: ever so attentive and professional Food: that's a no-brainer, for us to drive down from CT to get our fix. Cleanliness:A++Ambience: intimate, lots of candles, open kitchen. Great spot for dates.",5.0
"I don't care if this pizza joint has a two hour wait, opens from 6pm to 11pm, or closes on Tuesday.  It's still my favorite pizza joint in New York.  I've had a lot of pizza and by far this one is for me.  The pizza is just so nicely baked, it's amazing.Sucks I live in California now and I am sad I cannot find anything that remotely compares.",5.0

Best pizza spot in Brooklyn! Always a line out the door to try and get a table but worth the wait. It's BYOB and my girlfriends and I always bring bottles and have a great time.,5.0
"The best pizza experience I've had in my life thus far. Call me a pie-ous follower of the holy deity that is mr. lucali. I did my research for spot on pies in brooklyn, and skipped grimaldi's to come here instead--BEST DECISION. This place is beautiful because of its simplicity. They have a no-nonsense menu, and probably no more than 20 ingredients in their entire kitchen. Ok, so that might be an exaggeration, but this is what I feel like pizza should be like-- margarita with maybe some mushrooms and shallots if I'm feeling extra risky. The reason why people line up a good hour before doors open for this pace is because they deliver absolute perfection. It's a holy trinity-- dough, Sauce, and toppings, all done exactly right. The ingredients are very blatantly the freshest it gets, and you won't leave a dingle crumb behind because it's so darned good.",5.0
"Holy moly, mother of all that is holy. This place. Just, THIS PLACE. From the vintage cash register,  to the pulley bathroom flush system, this place SCREAMS beauty. Everything is out in the open, the food, the cooks, the ingredients. They roll the dough with a wine bottle, that alone is awesome. But the food is great too! The prices: meh, definitely up there for pizza, but then again, this isn't pizza, it's God's version of pizza. The way that pizza was meant to be. There is ALWAYS a wait. There are NEVER reservations, and don't even ASK about delivery, that's not happening. You get there, you put your name on the list, and you wait. Take a walk around the area while you do so, this also happens to be one of the most beautiful areas of Brooklyn, too. Bottom line, go here.",5.0
"You know you should think twice about a place this overrated, where the first question is ""have you been here before?"", as in, we do things our way here and you'd better like it. I live a few blocks from here and have eaten their pizza as takeout. Tasty stuff, not as good as Grimaldi, though the basil & garlic is a nice touch. But is it a fair comparison? This kind of pizza is best enjoyed seconds from the oven...So to settle the score when I finally went to check them out, the waitress announced that they were out of pepperoni. Out of pepperoni!?! What kind of self respecting pizza joint runs out of pepperoni? It's like an Inuit in winter saying he can't build an igloo, since he's out of ice.To be continued...",2.0

And yes, we would drink the BYOB on the park bench next door as well.The place looks nice for a NYC restaurant so it's a rarity you'll see something like this.

The marinara is fresh and packed with flavor, the crust was both crunchy and bready, and the garlic and basil were perfect. It was unbelievable pizza.

"Heard about this place on NPR a few weeks ago and wanted to see what it was all about. Loved the decor, atmosphere, and friendly home style.

The thin crust pizza with portabellos and shallots was really fresh and fairly tasty but I split a large pizza with a friend and left a little hungry.  A salad and a desert would have been nice.

As a person who loves toppings (usually sausage or mushroom), I am MORE THAN SATISFIED with just a regular Margherita pie. It's perfect for FOUR ppl (2 ""NY sized"" slices pp).

"Certainly the best pizza I have had in a while. If you are traveling to NY from Europe you might not consider a pizza in Brooklyn, and that would be a mistake. The pizza here is up there among the very best. The thin crust is delightfully light and the fresh toppings come through the tomato and cheese base with great aroma and texture.The restaurant is not big and you'll generally find a queue of people waiting. Inside your choice is simple, pizza (pie) or calzone, with a pick from 6-7 toppings. We managed two pizza between the four of us and the two boys could maybe have had a slice extra, but that would have been out of greediness.  I've tried a few acclaimed pizzeria in Italy and around Europe, but would be challenged to say this one does not rank up there with the best. Over 6000km from the pizza motherland, Lucali does the homeland proud.Note: they do not serve any alcohol, so head down the street and buy a bottle before visiting. They will provide glasses :)",5.0
"Lucali is in many ways the best of everything Brooklyn has to offer.The food: the pizza is simply the best. I'm not going to waste time comparing it to all of the other pizza places in the five boroughs. They might be good, and sometimes even great, but they're not Lucali. The sweet-tart tomato sauce here pairs perfectly with the pats of gloriously fresh, soft mozzarella, and the basil is so fresh it seems to have been picked only seconds before landing on your pie. The crust is heavenly. The calzones are gigantic and chock-full of gooey, savory cheese. They're what other calzones ASPIRE to be.The vibe: Lucali is trendy without being pretentious. It's trendy because of what it is: a tiny neighborhood joint with only a dozen tables; that doesn't take reservations; where the regulars are families with preschoolers, fashionable couples from the Upper East Side, and of course, Jay and Bey. You can BYOB, which is friendly on your wallet, and you can call when the restaurant opens to see how long the wait is (because there will be one).The experience: Lucali makes you feel like you're really a part of Brooklyn. It's so small, and SO GOOD, that you feel smart and cool just being there. It doesn't matter if the toddlers nearby are squabbling, or if you have the table near the door - being in Lucali is tantamount to having a good night. I'm serious. I dare you to go and not have a fantastic time. And if you don't believe me, how many other pizza places have 500+ Yelp reviews and nearly a perfect 5? Yuuuuuup.",5.0

The staff was very nice and accommodating and it didn't feel pretentious at all.I haven't decided yet where it ranks among the others, but it's definitely up there.",4.0
"just the BEST! get there early to grab a spot tho, otherwise you are in for a wait.",5.0
"Certainly the best pizza I have had in a while. If you are traveling to NY from Europe you might not consider a pizza in Brooklyn, and that would be a mistake. The pizza here is up there among the very best. The thin crust is delightfully light and the fresh toppings come through the tomato and cheese base with great aroma and texture.The restaurant is not big and you'll generally find a queue of people waiting. Inside your choice is simple, pizza (pie) or calzone, with a pick from 6-7 toppings. We managed two pizza between the four of us and the two boys could maybe have had a slice extra, but that would have been out of greediness.  I've tried a few acclaimed pizzeria in Italy and around Europe, but would be challenged to say this one does not rank up there with the best. Over 6000km from the pizza motherland, Lucali does the homeland proud.Note: they do not serve any alcohol, so head down the street and buy a bottle before visiting. They will provide glasses :)",5.0
"Lucali is in many ways the best of everything Brooklyn has to offer.The food: the pizza is simply the best. I'm not going to waste time comparing it to all of the other pizza places in the five boroughs. They might be good, and sometimes even great, but they're not Lucali. The sweet-tart tomato sauce here pairs perfectly with the pats of gloriously fresh, soft mozzarella, and the basil is so fresh it seems to have been picked only seconds before landing on your pie. The crust is heavenly. The calzones are gigantic and chock-full of gooey, savory cheese. They're what other calzones ASPIRE to be.The vibe: Lucali is trendy without being pretentious. It's trendy because of what it is: a tiny neighborhood joint with only a dozen tables; that doesn't take reservations; where the regulars are families with preschoolers, fashionable couples from the Upper East Side, and of course, Jay and Bey. You can BYOB, which is friendly on your wallet, and you can call when the restaurant opens to see how long the wait is (because there will be one).The experience: Lucali makes you feel like you're really a part of Brooklyn. It's so small, and SO GOOD, that you feel smart and cool just being there. It doesn't matter if the toddlers nearby are squabbling, or if you have the table near the door - being in Lucali is tantamount to having a good night. I'm serious. I dare you to go and not have a fantastic time. And if you don't believe me, how many other pizza places have 500+ Yelp reviews and nearly a perfect 5? Yuuuuuup.",5.0
"I had never heard of this place before I...heard of it. I was in the hood visiting a friend and he suggested me & BF go there for dinner.It was a rainy weekday, so no line. It was cozy and warm, and the pizza was perfection! This is definitely in my top 3 Brooklyn pizza joints. The crust was amazing, the sauce flavorful and the toppings fresh. GO EAT NOWI have heard about the crazy lines and such so Id suggest a rainy weekday.",5.0
"This place is among the best in the borough. Nice crispy pie, fresh ingredients and it's cooled in the brick oven pizza right in the middle of the restaurant. That means you get to watch the chef prep the pizza and covering it in that delicious cheese and so much basil that it makes your mouth water waiting for it. There is a long wait, but this place will impress your friends.",5.0
"When you think best pies in NYC, the first response everyone will say is Grimaldi's, right?  I mean, I would.  Okay, the line for Grimaldi's was literally a block long (and NYC blocks are hella long).  And as much as I would have loved to try Grimald's first...Lucali's was the next best choice! Lucali's is just as famous.  Why?  Because they don't have any refrigerators.  What?  Yeah, what that means is, every morning, the owners pick up whatever fresh ingredients and the pizza is made from whatever they offer.  So sometimes, they'll have sausage, other times, it will be pepperoni.  They have one wood-burning oven, and the pies are delicious.  We got 2 pies:  pepperoni with shallots and artichoke with jalapenos.  Fresh basil comes on top of both pies.  I could have eaten the entire pie by myself.  TIPS:  CASH only.   And because there are no refrigerators, you BYB!!!  We were pre-drinking outside, and I felt hella weird walking in with a bottle of beer in my hand, but, when in Rome, baby.  Also, make sure you call ahead and make rezzies.",5.0
Incredible! The best pizza in Brooklyn and maybe NYC,5.0
"The first time I tried to go to Lucali, I got there at around 6:10, thinking to myself, ""Okay, they open at 6pm, the line shouldn't be too bad, right? Maybe a 15-20 minute wait at most?"" We reached the block the restaurant is on and noticed no one standing outside. SCORE. Got to the door, and the hostess came out, saying that the next available table would be at 8:30. We had never failed so hard. The second time, we get there at 5, taking hesitant steps to the front door, and wondering if anyone is there to take our names down. SUCCESS. We're told to come back at five to six. On a warm Spring day, with an hour to spare, it really is a treat to explore Carroll Gardens...and find a great bottle of wine to enjoy with our pizza - how can you not take advantage of BYOB?We get back at 6 and all the tables but one are full. It must be ours. A group of people fail hard (like my first time), and the hostess asks if she can help us. We give her the name of the reservation, and sure enough, we're led to that one last table. Can't help but feel smug.If you're hungry, you don't have to worry. The pizzas come out fast. If there was a ranking system for pizza waiting time, Lucali would make every other comparable pizza place eat its dust. You might wait 20-30 minutes at Juliana's, Motorino, Grimaldi's, Emily, Wheated, the list goes on - but you will probably wait only about 10-15 at Lucali.The crust is soft and chewy without being too dense. It might be easier eating with a fork and knife - if you have a lot of toppings, each slice might be droopy - and let's face it, this isn't your neighborhood pizzeria pizza where your slice can hold its own by lifting it by the crust. If you like basil, you'll find your happy place, because each pizza comes with bunches of it, as well as fresh garlic (which you can probably omit, if you request it). The variety of pizza toppings is limited. One meat - pepperoni - and a bunch of vegetable options - shallots, mushrooms, peppers, there might be more, I forget. Get the shallots, they are delicious.The calzone comes in two sizes and you can add whatever toppings you want (limited to the ones you can put on your pizza of course). Cheese fiends will rejoice because the ricotta is seriously fresh and creamy. Needless to say, after two whole pizzas between four people, a large calzone took some effort in finishing, but that cheese was uh-mazing.",4.0
"Nobody does it like Mark Iacono and his team.  This is my favorite pizza in all of NYC.  The menu is minimal and that's because you only need three things in life:1.  Their pizza2.  Their calzone3.  Their nutella pizza for desert.AND, its BYOB.  It gets no better.",5.0
"Stopped in on Wednesday night. We arrived 15 minutes before opening, which was just in time for the last table! It was our first time there, so the server explained that they offer one size pizza and calzones. We chose a pizza with pepperoni. Very tasty! Comes with basil. It is a little pricey for a pie, but one pie is good for two people. We had forgotten about the BYOB, so make sure to bring a nice glass of wine or maybe an Italian beer! Can't wait to go back (with drinks this time.)",5.0
"Okay, I don't do Brooklyn. I occasionally hear of Brooklyn but I just don't do Brooklyn. And then my friend told me he ran into Jay Z and Beyonce twice at this spot. I said to myself now I had to do Brooklyn for the pizza there. Everything is simple. One size, one price, a few topping, only pizza and you can BYOB. People line up for this simplicity! The pizza there is just so right and so right. The restaurant has the down to earth vibe, not artificially decorated but homey and welcoming. You can either eat the pizza with wine with your date on a casual going-out or eat the pizza with beer with your family for a Sunday fam get-together. They could have turned down the A/C a bit tho. It made our pizza cold rapidly but overall Lucali is just lovely. I think I like Brooklyn now.",5.0
"If you like thin crust fresh-as-it-gets pizza, then Lucali's is the right pizza joint for you. They only serve two things: Pizza and Calzone, so they pretty much have to do both well - and they exceeded my expectations. It's BYOB. Lots of atmosphere too! Some say ""its the best pizza in Brooklyn?"" Well, that is an opinion left to each individual - my vote is ""Hell-to-the-YES, it's the best!"" (Which should be their slogan)",5.0
"Found this place thanks to Yelp, while driving back home from shopping. Monday, almost 9 pm, sure to find a table for two...No table, fully booked. So we asked for a take out, too tired to look for another place. It was freezing outside, so they were very kind to prepare our pizza pretty fast and we appreciated it.Half margherita, Half mushrooms and spicy peppers $28. Not cheap. We run home and ate it so fast that I forgot to take a picture, sorry. But it was very good, really. Maybe too large crust to me, but for sure I will come again.

"MY FIRST REVIEW VIA THE YELP APP - oh thank heavens for making my life easier!!!! Thanks for letting the elites try it out first! This is great!!!---We waited almost 2 hours on saturday, we went to a local bar to wait. There are a couple of seats outside for people who want to wait, but there's usually a huge crowd. Thankfully Lucali will call you on your cell when your table is almost ready.After we sat down and ordered, our pie came out fresh and piping hot within 10 minutes. Shocking! We thought we would have to wait another 45 minutes or so.The pizza was so good! We ate quickly (to avoid the crust sogging up) and in silence - to savor the taste. The only words we uttered during the entire meal was ""amazeballs.""We then ordered a calzone. It was the best idea of the day. I liked it even more than the pizza. The ricotta cheese was simply scrumptious.I loved that you can watch them make the pizza in the back, completely open. It was pretty neat watching them spread the crust using empty wine bottles!We tried a few other places that same day for our ""Brooklyn pizza tour"" like Di Faras and Spumoni Gardens, Lucali's was hands down the best.  Will be back!",4.0
"Heard about this place for awhile and it's been on the list to try. One Saturday night, the bf and I decided to finally see what the hype is all about. We heard so many great things so we had really high expectations. When we got there at 8:30pm, the hostess told us it would be an hour and half wait  at the very least; nothing sooner. We put our name down and walked around the neighborhood. We stumbled upon this darling place called Brooklyn Farmacy (in another review) and had dessert before dinner. While in the middle of dessert, the phone rang and hostess said a table just opened up. We quickly finished up and walked back. Our real wait time: 1 hour. We ordered the margarita pizza. First time there, figure we order their basic pie. The pie is big enough to share and it was enough between my bf and I. The taste was a bit disappointing. I expected so much more. It didn't blow my mind and quite honestly I wouldn't wait again for this. The ingredients were fresh and not oily but the taste was a bit bland. The crust of the pie was dry and it reminded me of matzo. I'm okay with blandness and less oily type of food but this pizza did not give me that 'New York slice' impression. Also, the basils on the pie was in bunches. It would be better if they were cut into smaller pieces. At the end, my pizza craving was not met.The service was quick and well attended. The ambiance was romantic and quaint.I probably wouldn't care to have pizza here again. But I'll come back to try the calzones.",3.0

This dough is super thin, which I like.We had a large calzone which was the best I ever had.  It's BYOB which is good.The ambiance is nice and dark.

If you're going to get only one pie and you haven't been there before, get a plain pie or a margarita.You also have to try the calzone (with sauce on the size); it's ridiculously delicious...beyond delicious.

"I don't know when it exactly happened, but a transformation occurred some time ago among pizza places. Many pizza places went from being pizza joints and pizzerias to being pizza restaurants. During the transformation they turned down their lights, added flickering candles, added romantic music, restricted their pizza size to one size and bumped their prices up to ridiculous levels. Make no mistake Lucali is a pizza restaurant.Don't get me wrong, Lucali actually makes a good pizza. It's just not a great pizza. And no way in hell is it worth $24. The pizza is sized kinda small so you'll likely need to order two pizzas if you want to feed two hungry people. That means by the end of the night, you're talking about dropping 60 bucks for pizza for two. Yes, 60 bucks for pizza for two. And that's in Brooklyn of all places.The center of the pizza is very thin, the sauce is sweet, and they use a nice mixture of mozzarella and parmegian cheeses, although they congeal way too fast. I like the overall floppiness of the slices (they're sort of New Haven-esque).

Awful service.  Ordered a pizza and when we got there to pick it up- the hostess asked us if we wanted to sit down because there were open tables and she said pizza was ready. We sat- waited for pizza......Another couple came in 5 min later and another 5 minutes passed- out pizza never arrived BUT for some reason or another the couple that came in after us got a pizza- OUR pizza.

"Another place I heard of forever and heard so many good things about. So the place is tiny, only ten tables but the setup is awesome. The place is very dimly light, uber hipster and the kitchen, if you want to call it that, looks like a makeshift kitchen.

The first thing you notice is that the ingredients are incredibly fresh and the pies come out super QUICK. I got a onion, mushroom, garlic and basil pie. It was a solid pie, nothing that blew me away though. I had super high expectations and to be perfectly honest, I was slightly disappointed. I guess it got over hyped for me. I kinda thought the pie was somewhat bland, the tomato sauce felt like water downed tomato water, it really didn't feel like sauce at all. I was expecting a big robust flavor and tang from a really good sauce and it didn't have it. The onion and mushroom didn't really have flavor, the cheese was nice and the basil excellent, oh and the garlic is potent. The dough was nice, but the crust was rather dry.

The only reason this is not a 5 star review is because we also ordered a calzone with mushrooms and onions and the onions were completely raw. Not cooked even an iota. Maybe some people like raw onions, but I don't and I never thought that ordering onions in a calzone cooked in an oven in high heat would mean they would be raw.

"I don't know when it exactly happened, but a transformation occurred some time ago among pizza places. Many pizza places went from being pizza joints and pizzerias to being pizza restaurants. During the transformation they turned down their lights, added flickering candles, added romantic music, restricted their pizza size to one size and bumped their prices up to ridiculous levels. Make no mistake Lucali is a pizza restaurant.Don't get me wrong, Lucali actually makes a good pizza. It's just not a great pizza. And no way in hell is it worth $24. The pizza is sized kinda small so you'll likely need to order two pizzas if you want to feed two hungry people. That means by the end of the night, you're talking about dropping 60 bucks for pizza for two. Yes, 60 bucks for pizza for two. And that's in Brooklyn of all places.The center of the pizza is very thin, the sauce is sweet, and they use a nice mixture of mozzarella and parmegian cheeses, although they congeal way too fast. I like the overall floppiness of the slices (they're sort of New Haven-esque). Unfortunately the Lucali crew skip putting ingredients on roughly 33% of the pizza, around the pizza's perimeter to be exact.

My friend was right. The moment I walked in, it felt different. I felt like I was actually in a pizzeria in Italy. Small but very cozy environment.

(it's also pay per ""topping"" & there's a LARGE size available)NOTE: you can call to put your name on the list (starting at 6) to avoid a long wait!  PLUS when you put your name down you don't have to stand by the door, just be nearby & they'll call you when the table's readyCASH ONLY & DEFINITELY BYOB",4.0

"first things first: be prepared to wait. if you go in knowing there will be a wait, it'll make your experience that much better. also, if they call you - ANSWER it or they will give your table away, and you will need to wait. some more. so this pizza for sure is in my top 5, maybe even top 3 list of NY pizza joints. BUT that's not why i think you should come here. i mean waiting for pizza is like a thing here right? (roberta's, paulie gee, luzzo's etc)YOU NEED TO ORDER THE CALZONE. Immediately. It's basically a rolled up pizza and you get a side of sauce. I literally melted in my seat, mouth orgasm style. The joint is cash only but they soften the blow by having it be BYOB! So net net, bring some wine, go to a bar first, put your name in ASAP and eat the calzone!",5.0

"For a place that is lit predominantly by candle light, Lucali is bright bright bright. And I don't mean just in terms of luminescence.Simply put: the pie is delicate yet powerful, and independent from the crutch of toppings like meats and peppers.

Imagine a mouthful of subtly salty mozzarella and aggressively seasoned tangy tomato sauce, and both upon a backdrop of semi-sweet (but not charred) crust...all encasing a bouquet of fresh basil. THAT, is what you'll get with each slice. It's awesome.  I'll add that the service is excellent _once_ you're actually seated, and it's BYOB, yeeeeow what a winning hand.",5.0

If you try for anytime after 7, it'll be at least an hour wait, more likely 2.I've tried to take-out pizza from this place, as I'm near enough that the pizza will hold up for the short walk.

"Was in New York for a few months working this summer.

It was everything I dreamed of and more!! The pizza was HUUUUUGE!!! Freshly made-- you could see their pizza board from our table. It's so fresh, they don't even have a menu! They just list off the handful of topping selections and that's it. Once size fits all pizza. Uh-may-zing!And the place is adorable! Super cozy and totally reflected the neighborhood. Such a great experience. I heard the wait is insane though... luckily I read the Yelp reviews first and figured that out, so we were there 10 mins before it opened. Still had about a 10 minute wait. The place filled up within 30 mins to max capacity. Clearly, this place has something to offer!! I highly suggest going. The fresh basil adds amazing flavor. Get it! Bon apetit!",5.0

"If I could give Lucali 6 stars, I would.  We've been back several times, and it's still incredibly good.  But I'm re-reviewing to tell a little story.  On our last visit, we had one slice left.  We decided to take it home for breakfast, but, alas, the waitress dropped it on the way back to the kitchen.  No big deal.Well, apparently it was, because they gave us a new pie to take home. Absurdly good pizza and generosity too.",5.0
"The best pizza experience I've had in New York City.

The atmosphere, food and service were all perfect. I will definitely be coming back again.",5.0
"Keep it simple. This place does it and that's what makes it great. Sometimes you have to stand in line for a long time to get in. Once inside, the menu is limited to pizza with about 5 choices of toppings and calzones. That's it. If you want wine, you have to bring your own. There's no corking fee. They don't take credit cards, keeping with the simple idea. The ingredients are fresh and you can watch them cook your pizza in front of your eyes. I fed a group of 6 for less than $100. But it wasn't fancy. Just plain good. I probably shouldn't write a good review and the place is already very popular and this may make it worse. You can get excellent pizza in a lot of places without waiting in New York. But if you don't mind the wait, this one keeps it simple and good.",5.0

It would have been nice if they had cooked the basil onto the pie instead of tossing a bunch of raw leaves on top, but we just did that ourselves. Will def go back!!",5.0
"If I could give Lucali 6 stars, I would.  We've been back several times, and it's still incredibly good.  But I'm re-reviewing to tell a little story.  On our last visit, we had one slice left.  We decided to take it home for breakfast, but, alas, the waitress dropped it on the way back to the kitchen.  No big deal.Well, apparently it was, because they gave us a new pie to take home. Absurdly good pizza and generosity too.",5.0
"The best pizza experience I've had in New York City. I came here last night around 8:30 and immediately got a table for two without having to wait (granted it was rainy so things were probably a little slow). The atmosphere, food and service were all perfect. I will definitely be coming back again.",5.0
"Keep it simple. This place does it and that's what makes it great. Sometimes you have to stand in line for a long time to get in. Once inside, the menu is limited to pizza with about 5 choices of toppings and calzones. That's it. If you want wine, you have to bring your own. There's no corking fee. They don't take credit cards, keeping with the simple idea. The ingredients are fresh and you can watch them cook your pizza in front of your eyes. I fed a group of 6 for less than $100. But it wasn't fancy. Just plain good. I probably shouldn't write a good review and the place is already very popular and this may make it worse. You can get excellent pizza in a lot of places without waiting in New York. But if you don't mind the wait, this one keeps it simple and good.",5.0

I love the fact that it's BYOB, but we didn't know and had to run out at the last minute to get a bottle of wine.

"My third straight birthday dinner at Lucali. For the past three years, my girlfriend has treated me to the best pizza in the world at Lucali. We made it a tradition last year by only going one day every single year: my birthday. Even though it is the best pizza, we try to not go there any other day to make it that much better when we order it.Garlic, Basil, Onion, Cheese, Sauce. That's it and that's all it needs. It is such an amazing pizza that you must try. Wait outside for the 30-45 minutes to be able to sit down and enjoy, because it is definitely worth it. The hostess will basically block the door to make sure no one that is not dining enters the restaurant but that is only because of the size, so don't get nervous.One thing we did notice this past trip. Even though Lucali is BYOB, they still charge you $4 when you bring beer/wine and store it in their fridge to keep cold. Sucks and is sort of stupid.Other than that. It's perfecto.",5.0
"Amazing! Really, a cut above. Super high quality ingredients, beautiful little space on a quiet tucked away block. Be prepared to wait and wait, but if you call before you go they'll take your name on the list and give you a time estimate (not a reservation though). BYOB which is cool.

It's fresh and AMAZING. their pizza is to die for. you'll have to get a pie but two people can finish 1 pie for sure. their calzones are equally amazing (small size can fill two people up after a pie of pizza and thensome)Love it.

"My favorite pizza happens to be a walkable distance from my apartment (I swear, that is totally  coincidence and did not contribute to my 5 star rating. It is less of a coincidence that I live where I do based on my proximity to Lucali.)Do not try to go here at prime time because it isn't a secret. Apparently most Brooklynites and even Jay-Z knows about this place. You will experience a serious wait (over 45 minutes) most of the time and for good reason. The pizza is light and airy yet totally satisfying. You can watch them make the pizza, with only the freshest ingredients. There is no menu because it is pretty straightforward here, they only make pizza and calzones and that's all they need to make because both are amazing. Each day they offer some toppings which can go on either. The mozzarella is fresh mozzarella and the sauce competes with that of my Italian family member's. I think it costs $24 for a pie and I can easily eat half, which is saying a lot because I have a tiny appetite. But there is no way I want to save this and reheat it later. I am eating it hot out of the oven, right there and then and dipping in the side of sauce that I recommend you request. It is a less greasy version of Di Fara's making it perfect. Make sure you ask for fresh basil on top. The lighting is pretty dark for my liking, but you will be greeted by friendly young Italian waitresses (is that PC, or do I have to say servers???) and it is BYOB. Yeah, this place cannot be beat.

Very fresh ingredients and perfectly thin crust. It was delicious.

To top it off, it's BYOB but there's a 3 or 4 bottle maximum. Unfortunately, they don't take reservations and larger groups are harder to seat so I'd suggest going when they open with a special someone or someones. There's no menu, so the waitress will tell you that they only offer 2 remarkably awesome items: 1) Pizza 2) CalzonesShe will then continue to recite the different toppings you can add to your pizza which I blocked out after the first few seconds due to being distracted by shiny objects but I managed to hear garlic and basil, which are free. We ordered 2 pies ($24 each), the 1st with garlic and basil and the 2nd with garlic, basil and hot peppers. The crust was thin and didn't really have a crunch to it but there was no need for the crunch. The crunch was the last thing on my mind.

"Exceptional atmosphere, extraordinary pizza! This place is nowhere near my apartment, but I recently found myself here twice in two days, with different groups of friends, because I absolutely couldn't wait to share this special gem with everyone! It's a very charming spot, dark but radiant, secluded but familiar, and oh so indulgent. They make you wait outside, whether hot or cold, so the insider diners can enjoy themselves; I can respect this, because I appreciate this same treatment in return. If the wait is long, they will call you, so you can go to a nearby bar or market, or just sit out front and enjoy the lovely surroundings -- Carroll Gardens is rather ""precious."" While we were waiting the first night, we met a very nice guy and his extremely sweet puppy, and he couldn't say enough positive things about what we were about to experience. This was all of our same reactions, to the point that the next day, after telling enough friends enough about it, we were convinced to get back in line again! It's BYOB, and there really are few things I can imagine more delightful than a few bottles of wine with a few friends sharing a few pizzas. My favorite is the Mushroom.",5.0

Well worth it though!",5.0
"This is certainly the only pizza place I'm aware of with a velvet rope protecting the entrance, and probably one of the only ones that deserves it. The hostess stands guard with her list of names, keeping track of how many parties are in front of you and ensuring that the sincerely convivial, genuinely rustic atmosphere inside goes undisturbed by the riff-raff* on the street. Even on a weekday, the wait might be upwards of an hour. But as long as you're in no rush, Lucali is worth your time, as their impeccable reputation is well-deserved. The interior is high-ceilinged and spare, with nothing but wooden tables, a street sign and a blackboard depicting the menu to adorn the space. Your eyes can't help but be drawn to the oven in the center of the room where a few men knead dough and push and pull pies into and out of the wood-burning oven. They work deliberately and tirelessly,  surrounded by that bowl of milky mozzarella and piles of fresh basil, mushrooms and more.  The candlelight renders the space dark enough that at each table, you feel like you're in your own little world. You pour your own wine** as Italian men croon in the background; the soundtrack is composed mostly of either opera, or members of the Rat Pack. ""Volare"" is bound to play, and it's fitting, as the pizza will make you feel like flying. While a few other pies in this world might be as good, I'm not sure I could call any better. Lucali's pizza is perfect in its simplicity. Great sauce, beautiful cheese, and the freshest ingredients atop an unimpeachable crust. There is no bad combination to order, but garlic, pepperoni and fresh basil might be my favorite.I have to agree with our recent out-of-town guests who said:1. ""I've never had crust this good. Ever.""2.

"Awesome pizza.  I enjoy the fact this place is no frills, BYOB and no menu!  It's pizza in one size or a calzone.  You are told a list of toppings and that is that!  The crust is delicious and the sauce is the perfect balance of savory and sweet.  I like that they cook it right out in the open - it gives the whole experience a very homey feel.My husband and I were extremely fortunate one Saturday night to walk in and be sat around 7pm.  I was not as fortunate when I brought my brother and 4 year old niece at 6pm sharp on another Saturday only to be told we could not have a table until 8:30pm.  I understand it's small and popular, and I had no issue with the wait personally, but couldn't manage it with a hungry, cranky child.  And I was not aware of their ""reservation"" list, which I think is kind of a crappy way to go about it - if you're not going to take real reservations, then the policy should simply be first come, first served, but again, the place is packed and really doesn't need my suggestion for how to run their business.  The other issue I had - the waitstaff was really personable and friendly, very good at turning their tables without making you feel rushed.  The hostess, however, could take a bit of a tip in that department.  She was at the door both times I've shown up, and I understand that it's busy and people get kind of pushy, but there's really no need to be rude.  I found her to be a bit condescending both times I was there, to me as well as to other patrons.  You're like, 20 years old - if you're that overwhelmed and exhausted from running the door at a neighborhood pizza joint, maybe it's time for a career change.Regardless of these small foibles - I highly recommend Lucali and I feel it truly stands up as one of the best pizzas in the city.",3.0
I don't know if it's the best pizza I've had in the city ( I love Luzzo's) but this place is damn good.  Got very lucky the other night because this party of 4 was late coming back once their table was ready.  The hostess had enough and gave it to us.  Ordered two pizzas.....1 - plain / 2 - pepperoni & portobello mushroom.  It was freakin amazing.  The two pregnant women we were with didn't come up for air until the check arrived.  I'd return in a heartbeat and definitely willing to wait.,5.0

"Exceptional atmosphere, extraordinary pizza! This place is nowhere near my apartment, but I recently found myself here twice in two days, with different groups of friends, because I absolutely couldn't wait to share this special gem with everyone! It's a very charming spot, dark but radiant, secluded but familiar, and oh so indulgent. They make you wait outside, whether hot or cold, so the insider diners can enjoy themselves; I can respect this, because I appreciate this same treatment in return. If the wait is long, they will call you, so you can go to a nearby bar or market, or just sit out front and enjoy the lovely surroundings -- Carroll Gardens is rather ""precious."" While we were waiting the first night, we met a very nice guy and his extremely sweet puppy, and he couldn't say enough positive things about what we were about to experience. This was all of our same reactions, to the point that the next day, after telling enough friends enough about it, we were convinced to get back in line again! It's BYOB, and there really are few things I can imagine more delightful than a few bottles of wine with a few friends sharing a few pizzas. My favorite is the Mushroom.",5.0

"Probably the best pizza in the world. Definitely the best calzone in the world!!!!!Some people complain about the long wait, but my brother who lives in Europe practically is always counting down to his next NY-visit which means a calzone at Lucali's, so that's a wait of more or less 3-5 months. Well worth it though!",5.0
"This is certainly the only pizza place I'm aware of with a velvet rope protecting the entrance, and probably one of the only ones that deserves it. The hostess stands guard with her list of names, keeping track of how many parties are in front of you and ensuring that the sincerely convivial, genuinely rustic atmosphere inside goes undisturbed by the riff-raff* on the street. Even on a weekday, the wait might be upwards of an hour. But as long as you're in no rush, Lucali is worth your time, as their impeccable reputation is well-deserved. The interior is high-ceilinged and spare, with nothing but wooden tables, a street sign and a blackboard depicting the menu to adorn the space. Your eyes can't help but be drawn to the oven in the center of the room where a few men knead dough and push and pull pies into and out of the wood-burning oven. They work deliberately and tirelessly,  surrounded by that bowl of milky mozzarella and piles of fresh basil, mushrooms and more.  The candlelight renders the space dark enough that at each table, you feel like you're in your own little world. You pour your own wine** as Italian men croon in the background; the soundtrack is composed mostly of either opera, or members of the Rat Pack. ""Volare"" is bound to play, and it's fitting, as the pizza will make you feel like flying. While a few other pies in this world might be as good, I'm not sure I could call any better. Lucali's pizza is perfect in its simplicity. Great sauce, beautiful cheese, and the freshest ingredients atop an unimpeachable crust. There is no bad combination to order, but garlic, pepperoni and fresh basil might be my favorite.I have to agree with our recent out-of-town guests who said:1. ""I've never had crust this good. Ever.""2. ""I like your apartment, but you're just going to have to move closer to this place.""__________*That's you.**The BYOB policy takes the sting out of the prices, and if you're as lucky as I am, you might make friends outside with a man who distills his own liquor and score a delicious glass.",5.0

"Sorry about the three stars, but despite all the hype this place has gotten, I believe it makes for a great 4 star neighborhood pizzeria but as a destination Brooklyn pizzeria/restaurant, it rates a very high three star local joint only. More like 3.9 stars, rounded down.It is a very romantic place with its dim lights, rustic tables and pizzaioli in the open kitchen in the back churning out pizze and calzone. Just wish I had gone there to meet a bella ragazza rather than the faccia brutta whom I was destined to dine with. Why waste the ambiance? :-D (I made up for that the next couple of times.)Well, I must have good Brooklyn pizza karma, because when I drove down here on a frigid, November Wednesday night for my first experience here, there was absolutely no wait at all and I got a parking space a mere one half a block away. We waltzed right in and the very cute and friendly waitress took our order after having recited the sparse menu to us from memory.We split a Margherita with fresh basil and a regular small calzone with sauce and cheese. The pizza came out first (and very quickly!). It looked great (see pic), just like a NY Brooklyn pizza should. When I picked up my first slice though, the sauce and gooey cheese slid down the limp crust onto my hand and wrist, burning me and I had to thrust the whole thing down into my plate and then lick the sauce and cheese off of myself. Next slice, I was ready. I remembered the pies my stoned out friends and I used to get at Villa Parma in Jericho after we'd smoked up a storm alongside the Northern State. You'd grab a slice off the pie and the limp crust would then flop down, releasing a flood of sauce and cheese, right down into your plate. There's a special technique to control this phenomenon and once I had that system remembered, all was right with the world.As for the sauce it was good. I like mine a little more acidic, but this was a fine sauce in general. Cheese was nicely distributed, but they might want to reconsider what type they use or where they get it from - it was a bit of a gut-bomb and I could definitely feel it over an hour later inside me, gnawing away.Calzone was a bit disappointing. A large pita/naan type bread round, folded over onto some ricotta, then shoved into the oven and served with a bowl of pizza sauce and a spoonful of grated Parmesan.Like I say, it was pretty good, but I would definitely NOT wait in line nor drive the 24 mile round trip from home to this place and back. If I lived across the street, I'd be here once a week. As I stated above, I've been back a couple times since and with similar results. I feel bad for the three measly stars because the owner's a nice guy and he's trying really hard to make something good, but the food here is just ordinary for what it's striving to be.Lucali IS BYOB (with NO corkage as other reviews have stated), so that is definitely a point in their favor though.

"New to New York and was given this recommendation from a local broker. I'm glad we went, by far the tastiest pizza I've ever had in my opinion. Now with that taste there are some drawbacks, so let me give you the heads up. They open at 6:00 but you can put your name in starting at 5:30. You can call ahead and it is no different than walking right up. So get there early or call ahead. If it is already 6:00 expect an hour or two wait. The restaurant seats maybe 20 people max. They sell by the pie, which will run you $24.00. They offer it plain or with garlic and basil for the same price. From there you look at daily toppings from $2.00-$8.00 per topping. So unless you are up for bringing the bill up the garlic and basil is amazing. The basil is clean and fresh, the garlic is fine and just the right amount to pump the flavor without being overpowering. So, go and enjoy a pizza. Call ahead, and enjoy the awesome.",5.0

"For our next stop - let's just say we left Motorino just on time, and barely.  With traffic thinned out substantially we actually made excellent time trekking to Carroll Gardens but unfortunately there were no parking to be found for a good twenty minutes - twenty long minutes that would lead us past no less than four pizza parlors including our eventual destination - Lucali - yet another location dubbed by various national publications as the best Pizza in America.With Steve-1 showing off his parallel parking skills a mere block away it was a quick walk to the doors of the small space and despite arriving at 5:45 we were thwarted - the first table available would be 7:15 according to the young lady at the door.  Standing and waiting to inform our dining partners of the news and feeling a tad discouraged what happened next still leaves me puzzled, but regardless of the reason (I'm pretty sure the Pizza Gods simply loved our ambition) after approximately five minutes of waiting one of the folks ahead of us in line opted out of her seat and suddenly we owned a 6:00pm table for four.  With Steve telling us stories of Mark Iacono's ground up (literally - he built the oven, the tables, and the chairs) operation and the months spent watching Dom make pies in order to perfect the art door to Lucali would open at six on the dot and we were quickly ushered in a table near the front - close enough to the window for some natural light to blend with the candles, but also with a great view of Mark as he worked the dough and chopped ingredients in a nearly Zen-like fashion - head always up and watching the room as a stark contrast to Dom's nearly non-stop eye contact with the pie.With only two options on the blackboard - Pizza or Calzone - and perhaps ten total ingredients to top the pie we opted for a single pie to split amongst the four of us - half with artichoke, half with portabella.  Watching Mark work the dough, top it carefully, and place it in the wood burning brick oven while my friends chatted I had no doubt it was going to be good - it was like watching a ballet - but I had no idea it was going to be the best pizza I've ever tasted.With a thin crust - crispy, light, and irregularly bubbled yet able to hold up to the ingredients with ease, sweet tomato sauce with a hint of smoke and basil, and handmade mozzarella at its base the pie was exemplary.  Pliable yet toothsome, sweet yet savory, slightly soggy at the center but not oversaturated with oil - really, no, I can't top exemplary as a descriptor.  Add on simple yet flawless mushrooms and sautéed artichoke hearts - my heart melted with each bite because I knew that at the end of the day I'd have to go back to eating Pizza that wasn't this good.With the bill ($26 for a single pie) paid and our flirty server heckling us when we suggested we were heading elsewhere for more pizza (note, Mark's brother recently opened a Pizzeria and we probably should have gone there too!) we made our way outside to find the line longer than when we entered - clearly others already knew what I'd just learned - that something this good is something worth waiting for.",5.0

Not bad.The pizza was better than I remembered which was a pleasant surprise.Crust was thin and crispy. Flavorful cheeses were detected. Sauce was substantial. Previously I had a gripe about these missing elements but not anymore. It was even a bit oilier but necessary which only added to the flavor. My only wish is that they covered more of the body of the pie with sauce, cheese so you wouldn't be left with so much crust.Since grimaldis has fallen off immensely after relocating, pizza politics, etc. Lucali is back on the list for top pizza destinations in NY.",4.0
"I have been going to Lucali for a few years now and for me, it is the best pizza in New York.  If you do not like thin crust and fresh toppings, then this is not the pizza place for you. I have taken many people here over the years and the one piece of advice I always give them is not to be afraid to load up the pizza with toppings. Mark only selects the freshest ingredients to offer on his pizza everyday.In addition, do not forget to try the calzone! You must also add some extra ingredients to that as well, especially the basil. And ask for extra sauce on the side for dipping.One of the best differentiating factors at Lucali is their BYOB policy. Since they do not have a liquor license, you are encouraged to bring your own wine (or beer).

"Don't normally write bad reviews, but clearly this place will survive whatever I write, because they are lucky enough to be in the Cake Boss league. You can't throw a stick in NYC without finding good pizza - it's the water for the dough, right? And the basic ingredients. So why is it that if you arrive at this place at three minutes after they open their doors at 6 p.m. on a Saturday night on Labor Day weekend when most everyone has split town for the last big out of town bender, and ask for a table for 7, they say 10. Not 10 minutes, 10 p.m.!!! Obviously, they see the kids in our party and obviously, they don't have kids or don't like kids or simply don't understand that kids can't just delay eating dinner for four hours. And to be fair, I'm not sure how adults can agree to a four hour wait, either. Okay, so what if we split into 4 and 3 and ask for two tables? 8:30 p.m. Well, at least we're heading in the right direction. Unlike Grimaldi's, you can order a pizza here for take-out without waiting in a one-hour line. Okay, so let's order two pizzas to go and eat them in a nearby park. So we place an order at 6:07 p.m. for two pies, and we're told, come back at 7:15 p.m. I start laughing... Really? Yes, as the hostess explains, ""we only have one chef and he's got a lot of pizzas to make and if you want to eat at 6 p.m. when we open, then you should line up at 5 p.m., and wait"" My first thought is, ""Maybe you should hire another chef and maybe, oh, I don't know, double your production, and your revenue (!), instead of turning away customers, forever!"" My second thought is, ""Well good, I'm glad the chef is busy and it's a good thing people looking for dinner at 6 p.m. agree to patiently wait until 10 p.m. to eat or 8:30 p.m. at the earliest, and I'm glad people seem to enjoy it and don't seem to mind the 2 to 4 hour wait - for pizza! Unless they put truffles on those cheese pies, we'll go somewhere else where we can eat, like, closer to NOW, and where, lo and behold, the pizza is pretty delicious, because, hey, this is New York and it's the water that makes the dough and the bread and the bagels so good, right? And since it's pizza they might add some freshly made sauce, some fresh mozzarella, and throw a basil leaf or two on top. Ouch, that's hard to do... I can see why it's a rare commodity worth waiting long hours to have a chance to partake.""This is the strange phenomenon called ""make them wait - cause that's what makes us so special"" It may be a syndrome. And people willingly participate. Cake Boss in Hoboken has perfected this with a 2 or 3 hour wait for...cupcakes! Same thing applies there. Just use Yelp to find a bakery around the corner or up the block or maybe 3 blocks to the north, and go get some delicious cupcakes made with the same exact ingredients in the same way without waiting hours, and immediately enjoy your food - and get on with your life.

"Any pizza place that rates 4.5 stars is definitely noteworthy, so I've been looking forward to trying it for a while. I finally managed to make the trek out to Brooklyn on a very cold Saturday night. Got there 5:30pm so there wasn't much of a wait for a table.The standard by which I judge all pizzas is Difara's, so I was eager to see what all the hype was about. We ordered a regular pie since I think that's the best way to judge the quality of the pizza.I found the Lucali pizza a little on the brittle side. I like to fold a slice and eat it by hand but the outer crust of the Lucali pie cracked and splintered as I tried to fold it. It didn't have any ""give"" to allow me to get a nice fold in it. I think the crust needs to have some crunch, but it also needs to have a little chewiness and maleability to it imho.As for flavor, I found the Lucali slice to have more of a cheesy flavor to it than Difara's. Maybe it's just the fresh cheese and olive oil that Difara sprinkles on after the pie is cooked, but I think his pies are more savory and flavorful.That's not to say the Lucali pie was bad by any means. It was very good and still one of the best pies I've had outside of Difara's. But in the end, Difara's still reigns supreme in my book.",4.0

"I haven't been to Lucali in a few years and I remember being impressed with it then but still lacking in comparison to my all time new york style pizza favs - di fara, grimaldis...Upon returning on a thurs night, wait was about 15 mins for 2. Not bad.The pizza was better than I remembered which was a pleasant surprise.Crust was thin and crispy. Flavorful cheeses were detected. Sauce was substantial. Previously I had a gripe about these missing elements but not anymore. It was even a bit oilier but necessary which only added to the flavor. My only wish is that they covered more of the body of the pie with sauce, cheese so you wouldn't be left with so much crust.Since grimaldis has fallen off immensely after relocating, pizza politics, etc. Lucali is back on the list for top pizza destinations in NY.",4.0
"I have been going to Lucali for a few years now and for me, it is the best pizza in New York.  If you do not like thin crust and fresh toppings, then this is not the pizza place for you. I have taken many people here over the years and the one piece of advice I always give them is not to be afraid to load up the pizza with toppings. Mark only selects the freshest ingredients to offer on his pizza everyday.In addition, do not forget to try the calzone! You must also add some extra ingredients to that as well, especially the basil. And ask for extra sauce on the side for dipping.One of the best differentiating factors at Lucali is their BYOB policy. Since they do not have a liquor license, you are encouraged to bring your own wine (or beer). I often go with friends and we are always sure to bring at least a couple bottles with us to enjoy with our pizza and calzone.I must warn you that the pizza is not cheap ($24 per pie w/o extras and cash only), but in my opinion, it is well worth the price.

"4.5 stars...This is really one of my top favorite pizza places in NYC (I'd have to say this and DiFaras are two of the best). Where DiFara's is a dirty hole in the wall take-out football game kind of pizza, this is the candlelight eat-in with a glass of wine kind of pizza.Cons:The waits are very long (there's only 10 tables here), its not uncommon to be told that its an hour wait to get a seat. I could be wrong but I'm assuming you can call ahead and get a reservation so try doing that and you might avoid the wait. Personally I took that hour and walked a few blocks to Alma (yelp it) and had a couple drinks at their bar. It's BYOB which I didn't know going the first time and almost everyone here had wine, I was a little jealous.The menu consists only of a pizza and a calzone with a number of toppings/fillings. You're only coming here for pizza anyway so it's not that much of a conThe prices and quite high at $20 for a cheese pizza. Given those prices I would expect a less smoky environment with fancier decor and a wine selection. Although my waitress was really nice and beautiful she wasn't too attentive and my water sat unfilled for quite a whileThey aren't open on tuesdays and they don't open till 6pmPros:I'm not sure if this is a pro or con but expect it to be darker in Lucali than it is outside. It gives it a dark romantic feel and its cool to see the pizza makers work by candle light. They might only open at 6 but when they close is the best part. On their times posted outside it says they close when they ""run out (of people or product)"". You can see that I gave Lucali's 4 stars and after all the cons you might ask why so high. The pizza here is phenominal, one of the best pizzas I've ever had and no matter what the negatives are this place is still cute and the pizza is worth any downfalls they might have.And even though they only opened in 2008 it didn't keep Food Network from agreeing with me as they ran a special called America's Best (with Alton Brown) and not only did they name Lucali's as the best pizza in NYC but one of the top 10 comfort foods in America. I'm actually very disappointed that my little secret just got out to several million more people but it just took Food Network up a few notches up in my book for noticing such an amazing and not touristy spot.",5.0

I could be wrong but I'm assuming you can call ahead and get a reservation so try doing that and you might avoid the wait. Personally I took that hour and walked a few blocks to Alma (yelp it) and had a couple drinks at their bar. It's BYOB which I didn't know going the first time and almost everyone here had wine, I was a little jealous.The menu consists only of a pizza and a calzone with a number of toppings/fillings. You're only coming here for pizza anyway so it's not that much of a conThe prices and quite high at $20 for a cheese pizza. Given those prices I would expect a less smoky environment with fancier decor and a wine selection. Although my waitress was really nice and beautiful she wasn't too attentive and my water sat unfilled for quite a whileThey aren't open on tuesdays and they don't open till 6pmPros:I'm not sure if this is a pro or con but expect it to be darker in Lucali than it is outside. It gives it a dark romantic feel and its cool to see the pizza makers work by candle light. They might only open at 6 but when they close is the best part. On their times posted outside it says they close when they ""run out (of people or product)"". You can see that I gave Lucali's 4 stars and after all the cons you might ask why so high. The pizza here is phenominal, one of the best pizzas I've ever had and no matter what the negatives are this place is still cute and the pizza is worth any downfalls they might have.And even though they only opened in 2008 it didn't keep Food Network from agreeing with me as they ran a special called America's Best (with Alton Brown) and not only did they name Lucali's as the best pizza in NYC but one of the top 10 comfort foods in America. I'm actually very disappointed that my little secret just got out to several million more people but it just took Food Network up a few notches up in my book for noticing such an amazing and not touristy spot.",5.0
"One of the best pizzas I've ever eaten! So so good! Need to go back asap. Lines are long, so I would suggest making a reservation. It's also BYOB.. bring a bottle of wine so that you can enjoy it with the delicious pizza :)",5.0

"Believe me when I tell you that I wanted to give Lucali 5 stars....really, I did. If restaurant reviews were based on the food alone, then Lucali would be the 5-star king of gourmet pizza restaurants. It is arguably the best pizza I have ever tasted in New York.  However, dining is about the complete experience--the food, the ambience, the service, the pricing and ultimately, what is Lucali's greatest downfall, the level of convenience patrons are afforded.Lucali is just plain old inconvenient, and here's why:1.  If you are not standing in line at least 30-40 minutes before the tiny restaurant even opens at 6pm, you wont get a seat, which means it'll be another 90 minutes to 2 hours before you ever get a glimpse of a pizza.  No offense, but im gonna need to see your Michelin Star(s) before you subject me to a ridiculous wait like that.  This is Brooklyn, not the upper west side.2.  Despite being well aware of the demand for their food, the crowd and the long wait time, management refuses to implement a convenience that would make patrons' lives much easier---taking reservations! I guess they think its better to subject patrons to the stress of having to show up well before the place opens and pray that the restaurant gods bless them with a seat. No bueno!3. Its cash only.  The pizza at Lucali starts at $25 (plain cheese), with an additional $3 per topping, so if you dont have at least $100 cash on you for a party of two, then someone is gonna have to go in search of an ATM machine before dinner is over.4.  They dont have a liquor license.  So not only do I have to stand in line forever, I also have to bring my own libations.  Say what?! I think BYOB spots are cool and all, but the place has been open since Jesus was a child...get a liquor license already!!5. The pizza is 40% crust and 60% pizza, which makes me feel more than a bit cheated after dropping $35 on an 8-slice, pepperoni, sausage and green pepper pizza.Dont get me wrong, after two dining experiences there, i can tell you that the pizza is top grade, brick-oven deliciousness!  They use authentic ingredients that you actually get to see the chef using when he prepares your pizza (the kitchen is open and you can see the pizza maker as he is working).  However, for me, its just not worth the hastle. I tried to take my boyfriend there on two separate occasions so he could see why i liked the pizza, but we never made it inside. Two minutes after it opened, there was already a 90 minute wait.",3.0
"After living in New York for over a year and being pretty disappointed in most of the pizza around town, I finally had a perfect place to sit down over a pie with friends.The line is worth the wait and they buy their fresh ingredients daily. Pizza or calzone, you're going to love it.",5.0
"The pizza was even better than I remembered... I was all set to give this place 4 stars and talk for 10 paragraphs about how it took me 4 visits to try the calzone, and how the calzone (with a side of amazing parmesan-y red sauce) was way better than the pizza... but then I had both last Friday and they were both incredible. Now my only advice will be:1) call ahead to get your name on the list2) include a calzone in your plans3) if 'shallots' are (is?) a topping option, do it. shallots are awesome.the people are nice, too, if you're nice to them. it is a very tiny very busy place. also, i am only taking restaurant tips from jay-z from now on.",5.0
"My friends and I rolled up to Lucali on a Saturday night a couple weeks ago for dinner. I specifically say 'roll' because we drove and were fortunate enough to find an open parking space in front of the restaurant, where my friend made a hilariously awful parallel park. It was so bad that the hostess asked him if he was from New Jersey (ouch!). This really hurt his pride, but I think it's partly what got us a table.Lucali is a busy place and when we arrived people were crowding underneath the awning, but someone cancelled right when we got there, so a combination of that and a little sympathy for parking-gate nabbed us a table in fairly short order. On our way in I overheard the hostess remark that the wait was an hour and a half. Yikes!I first heard about Lucali from Paulie Giannone at Paulie Gee's, which is the first pizza joint I've been to that I would ever consider a date spot. Paulie said that he modeled his restaurant on Lucali, and I can see why. Low candle lighting, exposed brick, molded tin ceiling and wood furnishings? Yep. Kitchen(?) and pizza oven in the totally exposed and hardly separated back half of the restaurant? You bet. BYOB? Hell yeah! Billie Holiday and Louis Armstrong playing? Ain't misbehavin'. Lucali has a very sparse menu - pizza and calzones, nothing more. Choose what you want, add toppings and go! We got sausage and onions in our calzone and garlic and basil on our pie. The calzone wasn't what we were expecting - instead of a short speed bump-shaped lump of dough and cheese, what came out was something that looked like a big slice of pizza that had been folded over on itself in thirds from tip to crust. Inside is nestled an impressive array of cheeses that I can't entirely remember, but I think there was ricotta, mozzarella, bufula mozzarella, parmigiano and a secret cheese that our server couldn't disclose (we think it was a mild blue). The calzone was pretty good, but a little light on the toppings. Out next came the pizza. If you are a devotee of thin crust pizza, you need to drop everything and get to Lucali now. The crust was so paper thin and brittle that it felt as though it shattered like a very finely caramelized sheet of sugar. It also had a decent bit of char on it. The cheese was great and the sauce was good, but the entire experience was overshadowed by the basil. Instead of dropping a couple leaves here and there, our pie had a generous helping of sprigs, such that I had a tough time tasting anything but the basil. Service was a little distracted - we had to flag down the servers multiple times to refill our water glasses - but overall the experience was really great.",4.0
"*This is my first review ever!*I was in NYC/Brooklyn for a 10 day vacation. Near the end of my stay, I got a tip to check out ""the best pizza in NYC"".My boyfriend and I had to try 2x to eat here!The first night, we didn't understand how the non-reservation waiting list worked. We called around six, and were told that there was a spot available in 30 minutes. Since we were at the mercy of public transport, and on the opposite end of Brooklyn, we didn't think we'd make it by then. So stupidly, we made our way over there around 7:45 thinking we could handle a 45 minute wait or so. Nope. 2 1/2 hours! The hostess told us the next table (for 2) would be ready at 10:30. So, wine in hand (Yeah BYOB!), we left. Oh well.2 nights later, we called in at 6 on the dot, and were told to come at 7:00 to get a table at 7:30 (with a 3rd person this time).Well, due to half the trains/subways in Brooklyn being canceled or rerouted, we almost missed out again! I ended up calling at 7:10 and asking (begging!) the hostess to keep our table while we hunted down a taxi (hurray for being an out-of-towner). She was really nice to us, said not to worry. So we got there right at 7:30 and she had a table ready for us! Yay!We ordered 1 pie with pepperoni. That's all. It was just enough for 3 of us, but I swear I could eat the whole thing alone! It was utterly delicious! The crust was thin and had just the right amount of crisp. The sauce was so amazing - fresh, sweet, tangy - I wanted to dip my pizza in more of it! And the fresh basil that topped it was the icing on the cake... in a matter of speaking. Some of the best pizza I have had in my life.The wait time for the pizza wasn't too bad, since they make them fresh one by one. It's cool to see the guys working the dough. The service was fine; the waitresses weren't impressively friendly, but they were quick and efficient.I would have given 5 stars, but the wait time is absolutely ridiculous, and its a little pricier than I want to pay for pizza.

Lucali doesn't need my review but I just need to say how much I am in love with this place. The pizza is the best I have ever had due to fresh ingredients and how its prepared. Just stupendous !

"I remember a summer of 20+ years ago, in Sicily. By the beach there was this guy who, every evening at sunset, would set up a table and make pizza on the spot, out of an oven that he made out of scrap construction bricks. There would only be pizza margherita, no other toppings, and only slices. I would eat a slice of this wonderful pizza while sitting by the sidewalk overlooking the sea, a Ceres in my hand, while watching the sun slowly sink in the sea, and thinking in amazement that Africa was the closest land, somewhere away on the horizon.I love pizza. Pizza is one of the simplest and most unpretentious things you can sink your teeth into. So why, oh, why is it so hard to find a half decent pizza in NYC?You've got to love the story behind this place: Mark Iacono opened Lucali to save the local candy store of his Carroll Gardens youth from becoming a Starbucks or Dunkin' Donuts. You can still see relics of the candy store hanging from the exposed brick walls. The space is large, simple, and welcoming, with a wonderful tin ceiling, and the pizza-making area right in the middle, on plain sight.As soon as our pizza arrived, I could already tell it was a winner. The smell was not only wonderful, but you could smell every singe ingredient distinctly: the basil, the milky mozzarella and, most of all, the tomato sauce. The crust is thin and crispy, as it should be, slightly charred and blistery, with a wonderful, simple taste. This pizza was so wonderfully delicious and simple that trying to describe it in more words would just be a disservice to Mark Iacono.We came here on a Saturday night at 7 pm, and there was a 45 minutes wait[1]. This pizza is well worth the wait. I can't wait to come back.BYOB and cash only.-----------------------------[1] I suggest to get a beer at nearby Abilene Bar while you wait: yelp.com/biz/abilene-bar…",5.0
"Is this place worth the hype? In an era where every west Brooklyn neighborhood has 25000 artisanal pizza places, I'm not sure the pizza quality alone is sufficient to justify the trip / wait / price. But: This is probably the best date place in the city. The lighting, the service (hectic no reservation policy notwithstanding), and the music just give it kind of a romantic magic that's hard to beat.And the BYOB is just so clutch - drinking fancy wine or fancy beer at market prices in this kind of environment is just hella rare in NYC, and more than compensates for the rather inflated pizza prices. If you're in a teetotaling phase, then yeah this place is pricey pizza, but otherwise, it's just so reasonable for this region of Brooklyn. As for the pizza itself - it's tasty. Very thin crust, very fresh ingredients, very good sauce. Pro tip: the no reservations policy + this place's reputation make things dicey. So either: go on a slow day (e.g. when it's cold as balls on a Wednesday night) OR call in advance at like 7:00 pm, tell them you're down to be seated whenever, they'll tell you to expect a call at like 10:00, you hop on the subway and trek down to their hood, get some snacks so you aren't cranky, pick up wine/beer to exploit the BYOB, and then settle at a local bar awaiting a phone call. Like if you show up expecting to seated immediately, obvi you'll be frustrated so just take it for what it is, take a deep breath, and just know that when they finally sit you down at least they're hooking you up with BYOB and incredible pizza.",5.0

Pizza is one of the simplest and most unpretentious things you can sink your teeth into. So why, oh, why is it so hard to find a half decent pizza in NYC?You've got to love the story behind this place: Mark Iacono opened Lucali to save the local candy store of his Carroll Gardens youth from becoming a Starbucks or Dunkin' Donuts. You can still see relics of the candy store hanging from the exposed brick walls. The space is large, simple, and welcoming, with a wonderful tin ceiling, and the pizza-making area right in the middle, on plain sight.As soon as our pizza arrived, I could already tell it was a winner. The smell was not only wonderful, but you could smell every singe ingredient distinctly: the basil, the milky mozzarella and, most of all, the tomato sauce. The crust is thin and crispy, as it should be, slightly charred and blistery, with a wonderful, simple taste. This pizza was so wonderfully delicious and simple that trying to describe it in more words would just be a disservice to Mark Iacono.We came here on a Saturday night at 7 pm, and there was a 45 minutes wait[1]. This pizza is well worth the wait. I can't wait to come back.BYOB and cash only.-----------------------------[1] I suggest to get a beer at nearby Abilene Bar while you wait: yelp.com/biz/abilene-bar…",5.0
"Is this place worth the hype? In an era where every west Brooklyn neighborhood has 25000 artisanal pizza places, I'm not sure the pizza quality alone is sufficient to justify the trip / wait / price. But: This is probably the best date place in the city. The lighting, the service (hectic no reservation policy notwithstanding), and the music just give it kind of a romantic magic that's hard to beat.And the BYOB is just so clutch - drinking fancy wine or fancy beer at market prices in this kind of environment is just hella rare in NYC, and more than compensates for the rather inflated pizza prices. If you're in a teetotaling phase, then yeah this place is pricey pizza, but otherwise, it's just so reasonable for this region of Brooklyn. As for the pizza itself - it's tasty. Very thin crust, very fresh ingredients, very good sauce. Pro tip: the no reservations policy + this place's reputation make things dicey. So either: go on a slow day (e.g. when it's cold as balls on a Wednesday night) OR call in advance at like 7:00 pm, tell them you're down to be seated whenever, they'll tell you to expect a call at like 10:00, you hop on the subway and trek down to their hood, get some snacks so you aren't cranky, pick up wine/beer to exploit the BYOB, and then settle at a local bar awaiting a phone call. Like if you show up expecting to seated immediately, obvi you'll be frustrated so just take it for what it is, take a deep breath, and just know that when they finally sit you down at least they're hooking you up with BYOB and incredible pizza.",5.0

"The best pizza that I've ever had was at Lucali.Cracker-thin crust, fresh and plentiful toppings, delicious sauce, and made to order right before your eyes.Service was great. We called ahead to avoid the wait, and when we arrived, the waitress greeted us warmly, listed off all the ingredients for the day and took our order. We ordered two pizzas - one with artichokes and one with bell peppers. After she took our order, the owner came to our table and asked if we wanted both pizzas at the same time, or one at a time so that they would stay hot. I thought that was considerate and it was actually more enjoyable to eat the two seperately, than to have two huge pizzas right in front of us.The ambiance was perfect. Small, dark, lit with candles, and you can watch the owner make your pizza from your table.Next time I'm in NY, I'll definitely be going back to Lucali.",5.0
"This is my favorite pizza. Not just in Brooklyn. In NY as a whole. I love the pizza here with the ultra-fresh ingredients that change on a day-to-day basis. It's also BYOB which makes it even more enticing. Plus the candle-lit, romantic, cozy ambience makes this a wonderful place for a date or a nice, casual dinner among friends. I'm updating my review since I wanted to write about their new desserts. They used to just have pizza, calzones, BYOB and BYOD. But they now have these delicious dessert calzones.

"Oh boy oh boy oh boy, Lucali. You stole my heart and I never want to eat any other pizza again.Recently recovering from a many-year-bout with lactose intolerance, I was saving myself for Lucali for my first NY Pizza. And it didn't disappoint.We called around 6pm on a Saturday evening and put our names on the list for our party of 3. The wait was about 2 hours, but the great part about them allowing people to call ahead is that you can call, and then chill out at home or at a bar until they call you. We just showed up at our estimated time, waited for a few extra minutes, then got seated.The space is gorgeous, dimly lit, and open. I loved watching the chefs make the pizza behind the butcher block. The wood-fired oven is also totally visible from the dining area. It's fun to watch.Our waitress brought us wine glasses and uncorked our bottle free of charge, and we enjoyed some Chianti before our appetizer came out- the best calzone in the Western Hemisphere (and let's be honest, do they even have them in the Eastern Hemisphere? Not to generalize here, but I'm just saying). The calzone was huge- I ate about 1/5 of it and any more would have been too much to enjoy my pizza later. I let the boys eat the rest of it. I recommend getting the original calzone, full of fresh mozzarella, fresh ricotta, and parmigiano reggiano. They serve it with home-made marinara sauce and this complements it perfectly.I also recommend ordering the large pizza with no extra toppings- just the free basil. This was thin-crusted-fresh-cheesy-perfection. No words can do it justice, just come here and see for yourself. They are generous with the reggiano on here too, and along with the fresh FRESH mozzarella, the thin crispy crust, and the perfect amount of sauce, this is pizza perfection.All of this, and including tax our bill came out to $34.

"First thing that ran through my mind when we arrived: 'Are Jay-Z and Beyonce here??' I know I've read that they frequent this spot a lot (including the night of the Grammy's) so I had to see what all the HOVA hype was about myself! We anticipated a long wait so we decided to go backwards and eat dessert nearby before pizza so that we could get there right before they were open. As a group of three we arrived at 5:50 PM and we were immediately seated at the last available table. I would say Lucali is pretty on par with Di Fara's pizza as both are neopolitan style and use super fresh ingredients (and also cost you an arm and a leg for just pizza). But Lucali gives you the atmosphere in addition. It's rustic with wooden tables, open kitchen, and lighting by candlelight. There's no menu except the one written on a chalkboard. Every pizza's the same size and you just choose your toppings. Be prepared to pay at minimum $24 for a pie though and it's CASH ONLY. It's also BYOB. They don't sell any drinks except for soda so if you're fiending for some alcohol make sure you make a pitstop at the beer and wine. At the end of the day, I still think pizza can only get so good. Lucali probably has a pizza that is definitely as fresh as it gets and I'm glad I had it at least once, but I honestly also get the same satisfaction from 99 cent pizza down the block. Perhaps if I made as much money as jiggaman and his lady I'd get my chaeuffer to drive me down here every time I had a pizza craving, but alas this is reality and I am just a poor peasant media planner living in an overpriced (yet wonderful) city.

Only to return an hour and change later and get seated at a cozy little table. It's warm, dark, and definitely romantic. Seriously. This is a date spot, no question. It is BYOB, which is kind of nice considering the price of the pie -- you don't get jacked on the price of a bottle of wine. The staff is friendly and attentive but definitely left you to your devices so as not to spoil the mood.

Only tried the pizza and calzone. Pizza (pepperoni) was great but not earth-shatteringly amazing. Tried pepperoni and mushroom calzones. Mushroom calzone was absolutely delicious: thin slices of portobello + homemade ricotta. Highly recommend. Will be returning. Looking forward to trying more things here.,4.0
"Had I reviewed Lucali in 2009 I would have given it 5 Stars. 2010, 4 Stars. Let me get this over with now before I have to move out of the neighborhood.The Pizza is really good at Lucali! It is excellent pizza!However... Lucali and other Neapolitan pizza makers are getting a little cocky on the heels of all the blogging foodies blowing smoke up their you know whats.  Went here last week.. ordered 1 pizza with mushrooms, peppers, and artichokes. Ate in.  Under no sane circumstance should this pizza have cost me $37, but somehow it did. I left dazed and confused, feeling a little bit like Lucali just turned pizza into the food version of the ticketmaster service charge. Am i wrong about this?  Am open to other opinions on the matter. Maybe my pizza wallet needs recalibration, but i doubt it.By the way... on a week night its really not a challenge to get in. I walk my dog past it at all different kinds of hours and after the initial rush i dont think its usually more than a 10-20 minutes wait and often times no wait at all.",3.0
I am sorry but I really had to calm myself down before writing this review. The restaurant is dark and boring. The pizza cost 30 dollars!!! and for what? Plus 3 dollars a toppings! This place should be BYOT (Bring your own toppings). I am sorry but if you have money to blow go right ahead. Plus before getting totally ripped off you have to wait for at least an hour and a half. I kind of get it why everybody loves this place because after waiting for so long for a seat and then getting your pizza in record time it must be phenomenal. Pretty smart but a total waste of time and money. It is all just HYPE! Its as if people here have never had a pizza from a decent pizza oven with fresh toppings. Don't get me wrong its a good pizza but really left me with a bad taste in my mouth.,1.0

I'm sorry when it comes to pizza there is no competing with Lucali. You know why this place is always packed. Because the food is consistently amazing. Not bad one day and insane another. No it is consistent. Restaurant owners take notice. No one wants to take a chance when you're paying your hard earned cash for food. The cool NY ambiance and the Sinatra on the speakers doesn't hurt either!,5.0
There's something hypnotic about the way they put the sauce on the pizza. The spinning. The pouring. The red.  You haven't had pizza until the ingredients are literally freshly sliced 10 feet away from your table before cooking. Even the cheeses are freshly grated onto your pizza. The ambience is amazing. It feels like you are walking into another world. The service is fantastic. I see why Jay-Z and Beyonce would rather go here than an awards show. I've never had better pizza in my life.,5.0
"5 stars for a 5 star experience. I went over with a friend who knows the owner. He parked his car right in front at the hydrant and we went right in. There was a line/wait but we were whisked right to a table and a few moments later we had some of the best Pizza I have tried in NYC since my first time at the original Grimaldi's. Good Pizza, great service (based on my experience) and a nice vibe. Not sure I would go all the way back there, from the city, for pizza and wait for a table, but I surely won't be turning down any future invites from the friend that introduced me to this place.",5.0
"No reservations and lengthy wait time according to reviews on Yelp.  The majority of the reviews like the pizza, though there are some definite cranks in the mix.  Okay, so we'll give it a try.But, before we waste our time, I call Lucali to ask how long the wait is.  The person who answers puts me on hold briefly then is back on the line.  ""How long a wait is it this evening,"" I ask on a quiet, Thursday night.  ""How many people?"" she asks.  I tell her two and the person at Lucali tells me it is, ""probably a 30 - 45 minute wait"" then she adds, ""is that okay?""Hmm, ""is that okay?""  As if she is making up a nice little story for me and wants to hear my reaction.Life's too short.   Time to move on.",2.0
"First thing that ran through my mind when we arrived: 'Are Jay-Z and Beyonce here??' I know I've read that they frequent this spot a lot (including the night of the Grammy's) so I had to see what all the HOVA hype was about myself! We anticipated a long wait so we decided to go backwards and eat dessert nearby before pizza so that we could get there right before they were open. As a group of three we arrived at 5:50 PM and we were immediately seated at the last available table. I would say Lucali is pretty on par with Di Fara's pizza as both are neopolitan style and use super fresh ingredients (and also cost you an arm and a leg for just pizza). But Lucali gives you the atmosphere in addition. It's rustic with wooden tables, open kitchen, and lighting by candlelight. There's no menu except the one written on a chalkboard. Every pizza's the same size and you just choose your toppings. Be prepared to pay at minimum $24 for a pie though and it's CASH ONLY. It's also BYOB. They don't sell any drinks except for soda so if you're fiending for some alcohol make sure you make a pitstop at the beer and wine. At the end of the day, I still think pizza can only get so good. Lucali probably has a pizza that is definitely as fresh as it gets and I'm glad I had it at least once, but I honestly also get the same satisfaction from 99 cent pizza down the block. Perhaps if I made as much money as jiggaman and his lady I'd get my chaeuffer to drive me down here every time I had a pizza craving, but alas this is reality and I am just a poor peasant media planner living in an overpriced (yet wonderful) city. Definitely recommend trying at least once though, it's worth it!",4.0
"It's all true. All of it.The long wait. The rustic, candlelit ambiance. The delicious pizza that may or may not be overpriced.  BYOB. The short hike from the subway station.But that's kind of what I loved about it. We put our name on the list and went to a nearby bar to kill time. Only to return an hour and change later and get seated at a cozy little table. It's warm, dark, and definitely romantic. Seriously. This is a date spot, no question. It is BYOB, which is kind of nice considering the price of the pie -- you don't get jacked on the price of a bottle of wine. The staff is friendly and attentive but definitely left you to your devices so as not to spoil the mood. Sure it's a little off the beaten path but isn't it nice to be away from it all?Am I gushing enough?Can I just say I loved it here and had a fantastic evening?",5.0

"Located in Carroll Garden, the residential area, which is beautiful and peaceful.  We got lucky today with the restaurant not being crowded today.  When you walk in, it's a bit dark with candles at the wooden table and at where they make the pies, but has an intimate setting and like you've been brought back to Europe (somewhere).  You can see them making your pie as you order.  Oh yeah, no menu when you sit.  Actually, the menu is on a small blackboard outside by the door - straightforward menu.  Only choices, large pie or calzone, toppings sausage, onion, artichoke, mushroom and I think one more.  Cash bases only and BYOB.Onto the pizza,  thin crust with fresh mozzarella which is so nice and crispy and not soggy.  Yes, it is a bit expensive, but you are getting quality pie.  The greatest part is seeing them make the pizza as you order and eat your pie.  Everything is so fresh, from the dough to the homemade marinara sauce used on the pie, to the homemade mozzarella.  We ordered two pies - first pie was devoured by my husband with me eating 1.5 slice and second pie for dinner the next day, but he had to eat one more slices on the way home cause he couldn't get enough....I know rt, what a pig and he's not even big, just his stomach is huge.I really loved their setup in the restaurant.  Brick exposed, open kitchen, seats about 32 people at a time.  They are open 4 hrs a day, only for dinner...they're that good that they don't need to be open all day.  They take reservations on the day of, but not 24-72 hrs ahead.  Suggestion, call at exactly the time they open up - 6p.You'll love this place.  Apparently my husband's stomach and taste bud does because we ordered another pie before we left the place.

"There are a few things you should know before going to Lucali. First, you will most likely have to wait a while. You may leave and they will call you when your table is ready, but the wait might be long. I believe I waited for an hour and a half on my last visit. Second, it's cash only so make sure you are prepared for that. Third, you can bring your own bottle (they will gladly open it for you) and, from what I hear, dessert.Once in, your waiter/waitress will fire off a list of toppings you can get on your pizza and you can order to your liking. I believe a pie starts at $24 and goes up depending on which toppings you get. They also serve calzones.Overall, the pizza is good but I'm not so sure it's worth waiting a couple of hours for. The curst is OK but, as others have mentioned, it can be large and super thin/crispy. That being said, it's definitely good pizza and worth trying at least once.",4.0
"Went here again last weekend for only the second time and loved it! ... once we got our seats, that is.I know the drill, you go up and you get told there's about an hour and a half wait and it's TRUE...but  wait, it isn't this time, it isn't true at all.You're sitting in a tapas bar on Atlantic avenue enjoying some sangria and stuffing your mouth full of warm bread slathered in butter and you get the call.""Your table is ready?""Wuh... it's only been 45 minutes!!....SHIT.. you stuff the bread in your mouth even faster and get the chorizo you were going to linger over to go then hoof your sangria laden tummies over to Lucali... and THEN..the wait...Apparently the people that had our table had paid when they called but they sat... they sat their annoying asses down at that table for another half hour taking bird sips out of a glass of wine and talking about bullshit that could have been spoken about somewhere else.C'mon people.. you know the deal, you KNOW in a place whose waiting list can fill up in 30mins-hour in the summer that you have to eat your food and get your ass out of the place. You paid, you leave.. please leave, please don't leave me sitting on a cold bench glaring at you through the window.You don't want that. I don't want that.I wanted to throw something at you but the glass was in the way.If I'd pressed my nose against the glass would it have made you move faster?No... A table of two arrived after us and got sat because we were still waiting for you.Enough of my ranting.. onto the food.We got the artichoke pizza that day and it was deeelushious... Thinly sliced pieces of artichoke heart with that slightly vinegary bite and buttery smooth texture made it perfect.I'd picked up a bottle of Riesling and good thing because by the time the two... ladies.. left the table we were going to sit at I'd lost my sangria buzz.A sangria buzz is a terrible thing to waste and I spent it fuming outside the restaurant while a group of people outside discussed Gour MET... food. I wish I was kidding, I hope they were. Ooh, you know I said I'd stop ranting. We got a pepperoni calzone to go and my bf took it back up to Buffalo with him. He tells me it was delicious. I side eye my phone....Hah, but really love this place.",4.0
"Glad to have a pizza/calzone place in my neighborhood which is actually considered by non-Brooklynites to be a destination place!  Expect an arduous minimun hour long wait, but once inside with a steaming gooey pie served up in front of you, all will be forgotten.  The place oozes with old world rustic charm:  exposed brick, tin ceilings, and guys rolling out pizza dough with empty wine bottles by candlelight.  Love!",5.0
"Overall, an above average experience. Firstly, I never let wait times muddy the review waters, find out what you're getting into, then plan appropriately. They will CALL you, so go get a beer at Bruno Mars Bar down the block and talk to the elderly travel agent lady who will probably be there (or you can take tour chance talking to the guy in a beret mulling over blank G-Clefs)  But I digress,The place is reminiscent of my favorite spot, Sallys, especially in the one room schoolhouse way, this place even more so. There is little evidence of this being a business operation, save for a large chalkboard on the left wall.  That's right, no greeters station, no service bar (no bar at all), and no cash register in sight. It was Grandma's kitchen and dining room, plus dim lighting, less the linoleum, and welcomed claustrophobia most middle class Italian families packed in small rooms at big tables are used to( I am). Here, The only evocation of a profitable business was the *ding* of a bell with each complete pizza.Our waitress was Vanessa. She was casual, yet attentive, matching the motif in here. And the pizza- the most important- In my opinion, the extra-pizza experience really made this place for me. The pizza was great, but not the best ever. The Mozz was overtook the rest of the slightly off balanced physical ratio of Cheese (40%) Bread (40%) Basil (a BIG 10%) and Sauce (only 10%) ratio. To put it in conditional Tasty mathematical form, the Basilica was equal to or greater than the mozzarella. I took some off to enjoy the full quadfecta. The bread was very good, but left me without the residual flavor kick found at some other high end pizza spots.Meanwhile, sauce was scant. To taste the sauce, I had to find a virgin region of the slice. Then... A knife tip to dissect this sample region, Stradivarius like, until an appropriate amount could be sequestered and placed upon my recently water doused/cleansed palette. Tasty! but I need more per bite!Lucali- I appreciate your attention to detail, I honor your method of having no specials, no gimmicks,Keeping it Italian, no 600 pound chocolate dragon like the one in Xi'an. Just pizza (and pizza destiny's other child) the calzone.",4.0

"BYOB as well as BYOD (d = dessert).  Nice that if you're waiting outside, they'll bring out some glasses and a bottle opener so you can sit on the couple benches out front and booze while you're waiting a potentially long time.  At the corner, there's a store with beer and 40s, but no wine. Not much original to add, other than everything excellent and fresh.  I thought the staff was very friendly and accomodating given the busyness of the place.  A notch up from Grimaldi's in my opinion.",4.0

"I read the reviews.I am a Brooklynite.  I grew up in Bedstuy, Crown Height, Flatbush and so one... When people say things like "" this is the best....yadda yadda yadda""  I say "" whatever""Aside from the wait, no reservation, Bitchy front door lady...The pizza was the best that I have ever tasted.  I am shocked.  I could not understand it. Or maybe I was starving, gonna try again.  Despite everything I had to give it 4 stars.  I don't care how busy it is, the attitude here is not cool!",4.0
"Incredibly good. Delicious, tangy and sweet sauce. Perfect crust. The mozzarella was average and the pepperoni and hot pepper calzone was not close to spicy but still delicious. Great atmosphere and good service.",4.0
"There are a few things you should know before going to Lucali. First, you will most likely have to wait a while. You may leave and they will call you when your table is ready, but the wait might be long. I believe I waited for an hour and a half on my last visit. Second, it's cash only so make sure you are prepared for that. Third, you can bring your own bottle (they will gladly open it for you) and, from what I hear, dessert.Once in, your waiter/waitress will fire off a list of toppings you can get on your pizza and you can order to your liking. I believe a pie starts at $24 and goes up depending on which toppings you get. They also serve calzones.Overall, the pizza is good but I'm not so sure it's worth waiting a couple of hours for. The curst is OK but, as others have mentioned, it can be large and super thin/crispy. That being said, it's definitely good pizza and worth trying at least once.",4.0
"Went here again last weekend for only the second time and loved it! ... once we got our seats, that is.I know the drill, you go up and you get told there's about an hour and a half wait and it's TRUE...but  wait, it isn't this time, it isn't true at all.You're sitting in a tapas bar on Atlantic avenue enjoying some sangria and stuffing your mouth full of warm bread slathered in butter and you get the call.""Your table is ready?""Wuh... it's only been 45 minutes!!....SHIT.. you stuff the bread in your mouth even faster and get the chorizo you were going to linger over to go then hoof your sangria laden tummies over to Lucali... and THEN..the wait...Apparently the people that had our table had paid when they called but they sat... they sat their annoying asses down at that table for another half hour taking bird sips out of a glass of wine and talking about bullshit that could have been spoken about somewhere else.C'mon people.. you know the deal, you KNOW in a place whose waiting list can fill up in 30mins-hour in the summer that you have to eat your food and get your ass out of the place. You paid, you leave.. please leave, please don't leave me sitting on a cold bench glaring at you through the window.You don't want that. I don't want that.I wanted to throw something at you but the glass was in the way.If I'd pressed my nose against the glass would it have made you move faster?No... A table of two arrived after us and got sat because we were still waiting for you.Enough of my ranting.. onto the food.We got the artichoke pizza that day and it was deeelushious... Thinly sliced pieces of artichoke heart with that slightly vinegary bite and buttery smooth texture made it perfect.I'd picked up a bottle of Riesling and good thing because by the time the two... ladies.. left the table we were going to sit at I'd lost my sangria buzz.A sangria buzz is a terrible thing to waste and I spent it fuming outside the restaurant while a group of people outside discussed Gour MET... food. I wish I was kidding, I hope they were. Ooh, you know I said I'd stop ranting. We got a pepperoni calzone to go and my bf took it back up to Buffalo with him. He tells me it was delicious. I side eye my phone....Hah, but really love this place.",4.0
"Glad to have a pizza/calzone place in my neighborhood which is actually considered by non-Brooklynites to be a destination place!  Expect an arduous minimun hour long wait, but once inside with a steaming gooey pie served up in front of you, all will be forgotten.  The place oozes with old world rustic charm:  exposed brick, tin ceilings, and guys rolling out pizza dough with empty wine bottles by candlelight.  Love!",5.0
"Overall, an above average experience. Firstly, I never let wait times muddy the review waters, find out what you're getting into, then plan appropriately. They will CALL you, so go get a beer at Bruno Mars Bar down the block and talk to the elderly travel agent lady who will probably be there (or you can take tour chance talking to the guy in a beret mulling over blank G-Clefs)  But I digress,The place is reminiscent of my favorite spot, Sallys, especially in the one room schoolhouse way, this place even more so. There is little evidence of this being a business operation, save for a large chalkboard on the left wall.  That's right, no greeters station, no service bar (no bar at all), and no cash register in sight. It was Grandma's kitchen and dining room, plus dim lighting, less the linoleum, and welcomed claustrophobia most middle class Italian families packed in small rooms at big tables are used to( I am). Here, The only evocation of a profitable business was the *ding* of a bell with each complete pizza.Our waitress was Vanessa. She was casual, yet attentive, matching the motif in here. And the pizza- the most important- In my opinion, the extra-pizza experience really made this place for me. The pizza was great, but not the best ever. The Mozz was overtook the rest of the slightly off balanced physical ratio of Cheese (40%) Bread (40%) Basil (a BIG 10%) and Sauce (only 10%) ratio. To put it in conditional Tasty mathematical form, the Basilica was equal to or greater than the mozzarella. I took some off to enjoy the full quadfecta. The bread was very good, but left me without the residual flavor kick found at some other high end pizza spots.Meanwhile, sauce was scant. To taste the sauce, I had to find a virgin region of the slice. Then... A knife tip to dissect this sample region, Stradivarius like, until an appropriate amount could be sequestered and placed upon my recently water doused/cleansed palette. Tasty! but I need more per bite!Lucali- I appreciate your attention to detail, I honor your method of having no specials, no gimmicks,Keeping it Italian, no 600 pound chocolate dragon like the one in Xi'an. Just pizza (and pizza destiny's other child) the calzone.",4.0
The best Pizza in NYC without a doubt! Thin crust just the way I like it. I never ate inside always do takeout. The place is tiny and they are only open certain times. This is what NYC Pizza is all about!,4.0
"BYOB as well as BYOD (d = dessert).  Nice that if you're waiting outside, they'll bring out some glasses and a bottle opener so you can sit on the couple benches out front and booze while you're waiting a potentially long time.  At the corner, there's a store with beer and 40s, but no wine. Not much original to add, other than everything excellent and fresh.  I thought the staff was very friendly and accomodating given the busyness of the place.  A notch up from Grimaldi's in my opinion.",4.0

No issues with the wait, b/c they took my bro's cell number and we went to a nearby bar to drink until they were ready for us. Blessings to them for that.The interior design is great. It just feels so nostalgic and comfy. Lighting is dim. Unfortch, Beyonce and Jay did not make an appearance this evening.

"Okay, don't lambaste me with hate emails just yet for giving them 3 stars. The pizza is amazing here. There is no doubt about that. You can taste and see how fresh the ingredients are. They are not shy about showing off the huge portabello mushroom they slice onto the pizzas or the shiny red peppers that are laid across. The problem is the wait. Let me explain: The restaurant is basically 1 giant room. Half of it is for cooking and the other half is for eating. There are about two 4-tops, one 6-top, and eight 2-tops. So, if you have a huge party, don't bother coming here, you will be waiting forever. The seating arrangement is a recipe for the two hour wait I endured for a 4-top. My name was on the waiting list at 7 pm and, yes, I sat down promptly at 9. That is why I subtracted a star. I know it is not their fault, but the wait is so ridiculous that it really eats into your experience. (pun intended). The pizza is great. You can taste the quality and the $24 pie with $3 for toppings is a fair deal. I could eat 3 slices because it is thin crust here. A pie is 8 slices, so you can figure out the rest. Also, you can order, at no extra charge, a side of sauce to dip in the crust. Overall, yummy pizza, but the wait is enough to keep me from coming back.",3.0

Both are amazing and the best I've had - yes, it takes a lot for me to say this definitively. What makes Lucali's pizza so amazing is the sauce (I never thought marina sauce could be that good) and their supremely fresh ingredients (the portobello mushroom and mozzarella were fantastic). The calzone was also great - the crust was flaky and nicely charred on the sides, and the inside were piping hot with oozing ricotta and sausage. We also asked for a side of the marina to go with it...you must do this.I must also comment on the atmosphere. The restaurant is very unassuming, intimate, and rustic. I love the fact that it was renovated from an old candy shop because vestiges of its past are still present in the decor. They also don't have a formal kitchen, so all the food and brick oven are out in the dining area with you. Very nice. Amazing pizza & calzone.

Yes, even though we got there only ten minutes after opening, the wait for a table of two was already approximately 90 minutes. (we took a chance on a Saturday) We decided just to order a pie to go, as did a few others, and we all got our pies in about ten minutes. While we waited, we watched the proprietor bring out glasses for and open the bottles of wine brought by people who chose to wait seated on the benches outside, which on such a beautiful evening seemed like a decent way to pass some time. We also listened as he suggested alternatives to some tourists visiting from Iowa who did not want to wait the two hours for a table for four they required, and then he proceeded to call over to the restaurant he recommended to help secure them a table there.

"This place is awesome.  Read the reviews and save yourself a whole lot of frustration, if you're trying to sit down immediately at 8pm on a Saturday it ain't gonna happen.  Do what we did and go, put your name in, and head to one of the nearby bars, hangout, relax and wait for the call.  On a Saturday night this summer we showed up at 6:30, wanting to get our name in before they stopped for the night.  We were fully expecting an obnoxious wait.  We were told 1.5 hours and my phone started buzzing only 45min later- we headed over and were seated immediately.  From the other reviews I was also expecting a 'tude from the hostesses/waitresses.  There was none of that!  The pizza, calzone, and nutella pie were all ridiculously good, we had plenty of food to take home.  Everything was so fresh the toppings are mandolined right over the pizza, nothing is pre-cut/pre-chopped.  You can watch the pizzas being crafted (yes, I said crafted) right in the open, candlelit space.  We brought wine and were not rushed at any point in the night.This is not just a pizza place, it's totally date night worthy.  With a pizza + toppings, calzone, and nutella pie costing under $50 + leftovers to take home it's a steal.  The night after we ate at Lucali we went to Babbo, and I sat there through the entire meal wishing we had gone back to Lucali instead.",5.0
"Best pizza I've ever eaten.  Absolutely delicious in all ways.   Worth the wait, worth the effort and worth the price.  If you're looking for a quick slice for a couple of bucks this is not your place.  If you want a romantic evening with your significant other at a Brooklyn institution, this is your place.   Sit down, watch the pizza being made across the candle-lit room and pour yourself a glass of wine.  Lucali does not try to appeal to everybody; they keep the quality high, the supply low and will not compromise to everyone's tastes.  Be prepared to wait in line if you're coming at a prime time (weekends and evenings).  Pros: best pizza I've ever eaten, fresh ingredients, friendly service, BYOBCons: long lines, fairly pricey for pizza, limited toppings, limited menu",5.0
"So we came here on a Saturday night. We left the apartment at 6:30 and we were seated by 9:30. Waiting 3 hours and the HUGE crust made me realize it's probably not worth the $50 or so you'll end up spending on one pie. Not to mention, you have to pay for the bottle of wine you bring. There's also a $4 charge when you bring wine for some reason. Just so you know, that works out to $6-$7 per slice of pizza and I can tell you, there isn't any pizza in the world worth that. That doesn't mean the pizza's not delicious. But it's like dating a really hot girl with major daddy issues that only gets off on being choked. Sometimes, it's just not worth it.",3.0

"So, I know there's that whole ""Chicago vs. NYC pizza"" feud thing, however I do not believe there is any way to compare the two.  They are complete opposites in every way possible.  I do love my Chicago pizza and I am loyal to my deep dish, but I will give credit when credit is due. A co-worker recommended this place to me, and I'm not quite sure how he found out about it.  I was staying in Manhattan for work and my bf came for the 2nd week I was there.  It may or may not have been our mission to eat our way through NYC....Anywho...We got there at probably 6pm-ish on a Saturday and was told there was a half-hour wait at that time.  So we went to get cash in the mean time.   (PS CASH ONLY if you didn't read in other reviews)  Yes there is a velvet rope blocking the door, but the place is so small that it is necessary so that people waiting aren't all up on your dinner.  The girl with the clipboard and the phone was hilarious.  If you piss her off, I wish you luck. Otherwise, she was a sweetheart and had us laughing after we came back from getting cash. When we did get back, the wait was already 2 hours.  My tip?  Get there by 6.   When we were seated, we ordered just a simple pepperoni pizza.  There is no menu, just a chalkboard outside with the most unique ingredients listed as choices for toppings.  My boyfriend pointed out that the owner and the guys making the pizzas kept going outside because they have what seems to be a garden with fresh tomatoes and basil (based on what we could see).  We got the sauce on the side as recommended by other Yelpers.  O.m.g.  Hands down the best pizza we had in NYC.  (we had a lot...)   The sauce to dip the crust in was just perfect.  Such amazing sauce.  So, at the risk of making this place have an even LONGER wait (for people who live there, sorry..) ....eat here!  Or at least get takeout and eat it in your car in front of the restaurant like we saw some guys doing...",5.0
"As the favorable reviews avow, the pizza here is amazing and well worth the trip.As for making reservations and the infamous wait time to be seated, the trick to scoring a table without a long wait time is to literally go to the restaurant by 5:15/5:30, (they start seating at 6pm)  and to put your name on their list.  The hostesses here in my experience are very courteous and accommodating.  Usually the wait is only 15 min or so (depending on how large your party is) if you arrive early.  If however your wait time is longer they will take your number and call you when the table is ready.  They don't take reservations in advance, only the day of can you put your name on the list whether in person or by phone.  But keep in mind that reaching them by phone is hit or miss as their lines are ringing off the hook.   So showing up in person is best in my experience.  My other favorite way to enjoy their pizza/calzones is to order takeout and simply pick it up myself.This is a cash only establishment.Cheers!",4.0
"Cozily tucked away in a quite corner of Carol Gardens, Lucali effortlessly, and consistently, creates one of the greatest dining experiences I have ever had. It is, at least for me, exactly why I'm okay with paying the exorbitant rent here, and what make the thought of moving away from NYC or Brooklyn an absolutely terrifying spectacle.I was gifted this place by a friend of a friend about a year ago, and since then nothing has even held a candle to their pizza. NOT EVEN CLOSE. If I could hug the entire restaurant I would. I want to have a sleepover there where everyone eats pizza and drinks wine and we build tents like little kids. I want to wake up to the smell of proofing dough and reeking of fresh basil and garlic. I want to live there. I want to move to Carol Gardens so I can get take out and simply ask for my ""Regular."" I want to try every wine in the world in an attempt to extrude hidden flavors in the numerous combination fresh veggies and meats. I want to buy a pillow made of their mozzarella. I would pay twice what they ask for their pie, and anyone who complains about the velvet rope, or the stern waitresses should simply order their Pizza Hut or Papa John's and leave me and my friends be; we're simply having a sleepover to celebrate why we are alive.",5.0
"It's no wonder Lucali only has two menu items -- it simply has the best pizza in New York. The sauce is perfect, the crust is just the right combination of crispy and chewy, and the rest of the ingredients are unrivaled. I've never tasted such delicious mushrooms in my life; the cheeses are extremely fresh; and the basil is a perfect complement to everything else.If that's not enough to draw you to Lucali, the ambiance is rustic in the best way possible. There are real candles all over the restaurant, and the brick-oven is the centerpiece of the restaurant.  I also appreciated the wide spacing between tables.By virtue of the BYOB policy, the alcohol selection is also unrivaled.

"This place is awesome.  Read the reviews and save yourself a whole lot of frustration, if you're trying to sit down immediately at 8pm on a Saturday it ain't gonna happen.  Do what we did and go, put your name in, and head to one of the nearby bars, hangout, relax and wait for the call.  On a Saturday night this summer we showed up at 6:30, wanting to get our name in before they stopped for the night.  We were fully expecting an obnoxious wait.  We were told 1.5 hours and my phone started buzzing only 45min later- we headed over and were seated immediately.  From the other reviews I was also expecting a 'tude from the hostesses/waitresses.  There was none of that!  The pizza, calzone, and nutella pie were all ridiculously good, we had plenty of food to take home.  Everything was so fresh the toppings are mandolined right over the pizza, nothing is pre-cut/pre-chopped.  You can watch the pizzas being crafted (yes, I said crafted) right in the open, candlelit space.  We brought wine and were not rushed at any point in the night.This is not just a pizza place, it's totally date night worthy.  With a pizza + toppings, calzone, and nutella pie costing under $50 + leftovers to take home it's a steal.  The night after we ate at Lucali we went to Babbo, and I sat there through the entire meal wishing we had gone back to Lucali instead.",5.0
"Best pizza I've ever eaten.  Absolutely delicious in all ways.   Worth the wait, worth the effort and worth the price.  If you're looking for a quick slice for a couple of bucks this is not your place.  If you want a romantic evening with your significant other at a Brooklyn institution, this is your place.   Sit down, watch the pizza being made across the candle-lit room and pour yourself a glass of wine.  Lucali does not try to appeal to everybody; they keep the quality high, the supply low and will not compromise to everyone's tastes.  Be prepared to wait in line if you're coming at a prime time (weekends and evenings).  Pros: best pizza I've ever eaten, fresh ingredients, friendly service, BYOBCons: long lines, fairly pricey for pizza, limited toppings, limited menu",5.0
"So we came here on a Saturday night. We left the apartment at 6:30 and we were seated by 9:30. Waiting 3 hours and the HUGE crust made me realize it's probably not worth the $50 or so you'll end up spending on one pie. Not to mention, you have to pay for the bottle of wine you bring. There's also a $4 charge when you bring wine for some reason. Just so you know, that works out to $6-$7 per slice of pizza and I can tell you, there isn't any pizza in the world worth that. That doesn't mean the pizza's not delicious. But it's like dating a really hot girl with major daddy issues that only gets off on being choked. Sometimes, it's just not worth it.",3.0
"Believe the hype!!It is that good!!Dinner on a Friday night and only had to wait about 30 minutes from the time we called (you can call ahead!).  The atmosphere is warm and cozy.  Ordered the calzone (amazing), the small is really big, more than enough for 3 to share.  Get extra garlic inside, and make sure you order extra sauce..... incredible!We of course got a pie, we ordered with mushrooms.  So light and the crust is so crispy, the sauce really held up, didn't get watery like others i've tried.And to make this all better, BYOB!!!Perfect Friday night dinner!",5.0
"So, I know there's that whole ""Chicago vs. NYC pizza"" feud thing, however I do not believe there is any way to compare the two.  They are complete opposites in every way possible.  I do love my Chicago pizza and I am loyal to my deep dish, but I will give credit when credit is due. A co-worker recommended this place to me, and I'm not quite sure how he found out about it.  I was staying in Manhattan for work and my bf came for the 2nd week I was there.  It may or may not have been our mission to eat our way through NYC....Anywho...We got there at probably 6pm-ish on a Saturday and was told there was a half-hour wait at that time.  So we went to get cash in the mean time.   (PS CASH ONLY if you didn't read in other reviews)  Yes there is a velvet rope blocking the door, but the place is so small that it is necessary so that people waiting aren't all up on your dinner.  The girl with the clipboard and the phone was hilarious.  If you piss her off, I wish you luck. Otherwise, she was a sweetheart and had us laughing after we came back from getting cash. When we did get back, the wait was already 2 hours.  My tip?  Get there by 6.   When we were seated, we ordered just a simple pepperoni pizza.  There is no menu, just a chalkboard outside with the most unique ingredients listed as choices for toppings.  My boyfriend pointed out that the owner and the guys making the pizzas kept going outside because they have what seems to be a garden with fresh tomatoes and basil (based on what we could see).  We got the sauce on the side as recommended by other Yelpers.  O.m.g.  Hands down the best pizza we had in NYC.  (we had a lot...)   The sauce to dip the crust in was just perfect.  Such amazing sauce.  So, at the risk of making this place have an even LONGER wait (for people who live there, sorry..) ....eat here!  Or at least get takeout and eat it in your car in front of the restaurant like we saw some guys doing...",5.0
"As the favorable reviews avow, the pizza here is amazing and well worth the trip.As for making reservations and the infamous wait time to be seated, the trick to scoring a table without a long wait time is to literally go to the restaurant by 5:15/5:30, (they start seating at 6pm)  and to put your name on their list.  The hostesses here in my experience are very courteous and accommodating.  Usually the wait is only 15 min or so (depending on how large your party is) if you arrive early.  If however your wait time is longer they will take your number and call you when the table is ready.  They don't take reservations in advance, only the day of can you put your name on the list whether in person or by phone.  But keep in mind that reaching them by phone is hit or miss as their lines are ringing off the hook.   So showing up in person is best in my experience.  My other favorite way to enjoy their pizza/calzones is to order takeout and simply pick it up myself.This is a cash only establishment.Cheers!",4.0
"Cozily tucked away in a quite corner of Carol Gardens, Lucali effortlessly, and consistently, creates one of the greatest dining experiences I have ever had. It is, at least for me, exactly why I'm okay with paying the exorbitant rent here, and what make the thought of moving away from NYC or Brooklyn an absolutely terrifying spectacle.I was gifted this place by a friend of a friend about a year ago, and since then nothing has even held a candle to their pizza. NOT EVEN CLOSE. If I could hug the entire restaurant I would. I want to have a sleepover there where everyone eats pizza and drinks wine and we build tents like little kids. I want to wake up to the smell of proofing dough and reeking of fresh basil and garlic. I want to live there. I want to move to Carol Gardens so I can get take out and simply ask for my ""Regular."" I want to try every wine in the world in an attempt to extrude hidden flavors in the numerous combination fresh veggies and meats. I want to buy a pillow made of their mozzarella. I would pay twice what they ask for their pie, and anyone who complains about the velvet rope, or the stern waitresses should simply order their Pizza Hut or Papa John's and leave me and my friends be; we're simply having a sleepover to celebrate why we are alive.",5.0
"It's no wonder Lucali only has two menu items -- it simply has the best pizza in New York. The sauce is perfect, the crust is just the right combination of crispy and chewy, and the rest of the ingredients are unrivaled. I've never tasted such delicious mushrooms in my life; the cheeses are extremely fresh; and the basil is a perfect complement to everything else.If that's not enough to draw you to Lucali, the ambiance is rustic in the best way possible. There are real candles all over the restaurant, and the brick-oven is the centerpiece of the restaurant.  I also appreciated the wide spacing between tables.By virtue of the BYOB policy, the alcohol selection is also unrivaled. They're happy to refrigerate your beer or wine while you wait, too!",5.0

"Brilliant pizza in an awesome setting on Henry Street. There's NYC slice-style, which is great in its own right, and there's NYC pie-style. The latter is a little more refined: the sauce, cheese, and toppings are made with more care and with better ingredients. There's usually a very hot oven involved. The crust is slightly charred. Lucali specializes in these pies. I love the small menu, the attitude, and the BYOB policy. I feel very fortunate to live within a mile from this glorious pizza spot. My only issue is the crust, it goes on forever! Once you break the 1 inch threshold you've lost me, but Lucali pizza crust can sometimes approach 3 inches to the center! Maybe earlier in the night they pay a little more attention to detail, I usually go later on.",4.0
"Born and raised in Brooklyn, I've become very critical of any pizza other then the select few establishments which have been around for years (L&B, DiFara, Totonno, etc), but I must say Lucali ranks up there at the top.

It's the perfect place to go an impress people, take a date, go with your family or on a causal Sunday evening. The staff are all friendly and helpful. Natalie at the front desk always takes good care of us and is extremely professional and courteous. Once of the great things about Lucali is that they keep it simple. Many of these new trendy boutique artisan pizza places (Fornino's, Nate Appleman's place, Artichoke, etc) have all these fancy choices that are over priced and frankly nowhere as good. When you come to Lucali's you come for the pizza. Plain and simple. Their topping selections change consistently and they are all fresh. Since the pizza's are thin crust, I would suggest limiting the toppings so you enjoy the flavors of the cheese, sauce and crust (and so it's easier to eat). Make sure you get one of their calzones as well. They use the same dough that they use for the pizza and the ricotta cheese is the perfect constancy. Make sure you get some of the marinara sauce on the side for dipping Tips: Lucali's is a small place intimate place and obviously had developed a following. They do not take reservations, however if you call a few hours in advance and are going to be in the area, they will take your name and number and tell you approximately what time a table will be ready.

"This is a BYOB place that only serves Calzones or Pizza.  We made a reservation for 8:30 and they said they would call us.  We were starving and went at 8:30.  We got sat down at around 9. We ordered from a cold waitress who gave us the ""only calzone or pizza"" spiel.  We ordered a calzone with mushrooms and peppers.  We couldn't wait, after hearing good things.  The calzone came and it was basically just bread and ricotta.  They skimped so little on the mushrooms and peppers, there was barely any at all.  Most NY calzones the toppings are spilling out of it.  Not here.  If I go again, I will be getting the pizza and hopefully they don't skimp on the toppings there.  You can tell the ingredients and seasonings are there and this place could be really great.  But it wasn't when I was there.",3.0
"Really good, NY style brick oven pizza!  It's not as watery as Grimaldi's, and it compares well to Lombardi's.  It's probably faster than Artichoke's and Difari's.  The ambience was awesome....open kitchen with an old world feel, and sassy waitresses!  Wasn't a huge fan of the Calzonne, which was sans tomato sauce.  Advice - avoid weekends if you can....2 hour wait generally, and they are only open for dinner starting at 6pm.  I think they are open Wed-Sun also, so Wed or Thursday are your best bet....before 8pm.",5.0
"one of the best pizza places in bklyn! and a romantic, cozy, rustic, relaxing, good lighting atmosphere to savor it in. they make pizza by candlelight... nuff saidi really love it here -- we always get the pizza with pepperoni, garlic, and basil. and always bring a bottle of red.  we have yet to try the calzones although i hear they are heavenly as well.the lines are annoying, so go early to avoid them or go during the weeknights",5.0
"I can't believe it took me so long to visit Lucali.  It's so solid.  Cozy spot, friendly staff, great pizza (thin crust, but substantial), and BYOB.  It's a winner.Ops note: My friend and I arrived at 6p on a Monday night and were ushered right in.  That's the way to do it.  I'm not really in the business of waiting for pizza.",4.0
"Very good - was more into the calzone than the pizza, but both very good. They keep it simple, it's all handmade and brick oven, very homey atmosphere. Watching two strapping young dudes handmake your pizza by firelight is um, niiiice.The secret to any good pizza is two things - the sauce, and the dough. These guys use a thin crust without much flavor or complication to it - it's a stage for the sauce. Their sauce is where their magic is at - tart, thin, zesty and packs a lot of flavor. Pizza's a good balance for a girl like me, who loves carbs but also thinks of pizza as sauce+dough, and is not interested in a whole mouthful of edge crust to define her pizza. The calzone is rich, exorbitant (in flavor and heft, not price), yet, oh so delicious. It's big enough to feed a family of 4 or 5 alone (two adults, 2-3 kids). You only get one choice - ricotta. But that's OK, cuz it's hella good. On the day we came, Beyonce and Jay-Z walked up in there and freaked everybody out. But apparently they've been coming there for years. Good times.",4.0
"Two things and they do them both really well.

"Go here.  I almost don't want to say that because the line is already too long... but oh hell, I can't lie.  It's worth the wait.  It's worth the European schedule (i.e. they were closed for three weeks on vacaton this August).  It's worth it ALL.The pizza is so fresh, there's really nothing else like it.  The pies are loaded with basil - as if they've thrown a whole plant from the backyard on top.... the sauce must have been made by an Italian grandmother cooking away with her heart and soul in some secret kitchen ... the cheese is perfectly distributed and top notch... the crust is light and buttery and crispy on the edges.The toppings selection tend to change, based on what the freshest ingredients are that day... but my favorites are the mushrooms, sausage (small and spicy), hot peppers and eggplant.  And when they have grilled artichocke hearts on special, do yourself a favor and get these too!Also... take note that I am not normally a calzone person.  HOWEVER, Lucali's calzones are seriously the BEST calzones I've ever had.  Hands down.  Order it as an appitizer with garlic and sauce on the side.  Or if you're just having a calzone and no pizza, get it loaded with your favorite ingredients.  It comes out of the oven literally bubbling and bursting with cheesey flavor; the ricotta fresh and smooth and mellow.The service is wonderful too. The waitresses who work here are all adorabley Brooklyn, so friendly and sweet and helpful (and HOT according to my boyfriend's little brother, ha ha).  And the fact that it's BYO only makes Lucali that much more appealing.  Bring your favorite bottle of red, or six pack of beer, and go to town!",5.0

"Dear Waitress Natalie,Why must you scold me so for using my iPhone at the table? Don't you realize I'm addicted to pizza and need to tell the world (via Yelp app, of course) that I was in mid-Lucali binge?And then, to make matters worse, you presented ME with, of all things, the bill. You clearly just like to kick me when I'm down, mid-post-pizza coma. That is just WRONG, and what's worse is, I think you kind of enjoyed it.Well, truth be told, Natalie was quite fetching, brought us glasses for our BYO and recommended the spicy sausage as a substitute for the pepperoni that was not available. She also gave us the DL on her upcoming trip to exotic locations (Poland and Ibiza, among others), and gave me all name and manner of grief, despite my overwhelming charm and good looks. Ah, yes, the waitresses are indeed engaging (despite a review or two to the contrary), but as to the nitty, let's talk about Roberto B.'s review for a second:My good man, you can't be serious. You could possibly have walked around NYC, seen the manifold insipid, lifeless, flaccid, uninspired and unappealing pizza offerings and somehow, after sinking your teeth into a slice of this pie, say with a straight face that it's just ""good,"" ""totally acceptable,""  but not great? Pshaw. Your credibility is now officially nil, despite your vehement declarations of intimate knowledge of the etymology and origin of all things pizza. Ha! Your review should indeed be dismissed, as you suggested it might be.Oh, and did you actually comment on the demeanor of the waitresses? You want Mark to SMILE when he's making the pies?! Would that make you FEEL better about the pizza? Tell me you're joking. Pretty please.I mean, perhaps you came on a bad night, I don't know;  in any event, you clearly are not from around these here parts from what I can tell. Growing up here, it was pretty much accepted that if you came out of a restaurant not feeling like the waitress had spit in your food, you really hadn't been to New York City at all. This kinder, gentler Noo Yawk stuff has got to go. Get the faaaaaaaahhhk over yourself. Wait...no ESPRESSO? You poor thing! How WILL you survive? Would you even deign to make the same comment about Di Fara? They have no espresso machine at all! Off, off, OFF WITH THEIR HEADS, I SAY!Let's stick to the facts about this pizza:It was absolutely fantastico. The crust was crispy and the flavor confluence from the cheeses was enough to keep me sitting and eating pizza until underverse come (translation: a long freakin' time, according to Riddick). The only slight complaint I would lodge is that the basil should be spread across the pie and even shredded and it isn't, in a manner more akin to methodology of the proprietor's mentor, Dom DiMarco. The basil is an important flavor component and should be experienced on every slice. In truth, that's just a small complaint about a pie that pays serious homage to a great pizza, and yet succeeds at being just a little different at the same time. Among the notable differences, the crust is crispier and holds up better under the weight of the ingredients than the Di Fara pizza (I don't mind a slightly less resilient crust, myself, but I'm just sayin'). We had spicy sausage and garlic on our pie, and it was savory, tangy, and spectacular. I am looking forward to a return visit for a different variety of pie, and a heaping helping of grief from Natalie.  I imagine I'll have to wait until she's back from her world travels for that, but I'm sure it'll be worth it.Hey Roberto, eh?

The pizza is on a high tray and sometimes it is a little burnt because it is authentic. The pizza is delicious. The guy is always there making the pizza with his hands. You can eat pizza or a pizza pocket called calzone. There is a bowl of artichokes and they cost a lot of money.  It is alright to bring liquid but not if you spill it.

"My fiance LOVES pizza and has always raved about the ever-so-far-and-elusive-for-visitors-Di Fara-close-to-end-of-subway-system...just to give you a frame of reference for his taste in pizza.  Some might disagree, but if you agree with him, you might like this place as he continuously reminisces about their food.At Lucali's we ordered the basics as we always do to weed out the good from the bad...We ordered  a margherita (tomato sauce, buffalo mozzarella, and basil)  but tacked on a cheese calzone (as the owner suggested) and asked for extra tomato sauce..  They gave a generous saucerful to dip our calzone and pizza slices in.  But the unusual kicker is,  I dream of the cheese combo in the calzone.  It tastes so creamy and dreamy...I'm such a crazy food addict  and  SO TRY to recreate things I LOVE and this cheese combo is still an annoying mystery to me I want to cry.  I've even tried to make my own ricotta with local milk where i'm from...fail...tried to add certain cheeses that give it a slight bite...fail...I'm wanting the recipe so bad for the cheese calzone (I think there are 5 or 6 cheeses)...please share if you know!!!!This place is extremely tiny so come on off days (weekdays or Sunday).  It's byob or byow.   The setting at night is very cozy and romantic with only dim lights and it feels like you are in someone's rustic kitchen in Italy.It is a bit pricey for pizza, but the whole setting, the love put into each pizza/calzone and quality of ingredients makes it really worth the money and wait.",5.0
"Undoubtedly my favorite pizza in NYC.  While I enjoy Grimaldi's and Motorino, Lucali is easily better than both.  The freshness of the ingredients is unsurpassed and the thin and crispy crust is perfect; lightly charred, it has just enough smokiness and is chewy enough to satisfy without causing your jaw to strain.  Perhaps my favorite aspect of Lucali's pies is the amazing tomato sauce.  The flavorful and balanced sauce is savory without being salty, rich without being heavy, and simple without lacking complexity.  The mozzarella is also outstanding.  Our party of three had two pies (more than enough food):  (1) Margherita (simple and delicious -- Lucali's is the gold standard, in my opinion) and (2) 1/2 pepperoni (great) + 1/2 no cheese with basil, garlic, and mushrooms (tasty even without cheese). Despite its priciness (over $24/pie), distance from my UWS abode, and long wait times (up to 2 hours), Lucali is worth every penny and every minute of traveling and waiting.  Get here before 7pm to minimize the wait; but if you must wait, enjoy a warm or cold drink at the little store around the corner (yelp.com/biz/carroll-del…); while you're at it, pick up some drinks and cash at their ATM because Lucali is cash only & BYOB.",5.0
"The commonly debated topic of best pizza in New York is highly argued with no resolution or agreement in sight.  Of course, the domain of on Mr. Mark Ianoco should be considered one of those in the Elite Company.Lucali's...  Despite It's little known existence just three year's ago, the establishment and operations of Mr. Mark Ianoco has gained such notoriety that it's patron base rivals that of many of New York's highly renowned Pizzerias.  To visit Lucali's is to understand it's Pizza offerings, to dine at Lucali's to be truly humbled.Rachel and I arrived at Lucali's on a Saturday evening at 6:00pm on a spontaneous endeavor.  We began to put our name on the waitlist and was informed that the wait would be 1 hour.  Not too bad given the high recognition given this establishment, thus we proceeded to walk around Carroll Gardens.--- 45 Minutes Later ---We received a call stating that our table was ready.  We immediately rushed back to Lucali's in less than 3 minutes to meet our table obligations.At first entry, patrons will find that the vibrant yet romantic décor of Lucali's is one that's best described as breathtaking and humbling.  With it's rich ivory white walls that's amplified solely by candlelight, the restaurant itself provides a truly romantic feel.  Compared to most other establishments, Lucali's is lit solely by candlelight.  There's no fluorescent tungsten lightening or spotlights from above, the lighting is solely provided by what little sunlight shining through the windows and that of the individual candle placements on each table.  To further describe the establishment, the furniture at Lucali's is comprised of old rustic wooden material, thus aiding in the simplistic feel.  To the immediate back of the restaurant, Mr. Ianoco works under candle lighting to create the various offerings selected by patrons.  With his station finely controlled to his attention, and his patrons under the care of his watchful eye, a feeling of being at home is rendered when dining at Lucali's.  All patrons first entering are greeted by Mr. Ianoco from afar, which aids in the calming tones that surrounds ones sense.  Simply put, the feeling of Lucali's is one that's at ease.  Perhaps Mr. Ianoco's attempt to create an ambient yet peasantry environment worked to his delight, as the quaint and tranquil feel while dining at his establishment is simply superb.The Food:  Great Mastery of Technique, Remarkable Pizza.The Pizza:  A thinly piece of naturally leavened dough is topped with a warm coating of San Marzano Tomato Sauce, and topped with a special three cheese blend.  After removal from the brick oven, the pizza is finished off with a drizzle of Extra Virgin Olive Oil, Fresh Basil, and a Sprinkling of Parmigiano Reggiano.  When consuming Pizziaolo Ianoco's rendition of a classic Naples export, the various flavors derived from his offering is observed as uncanny.  The first notable detection in the Pizza is the nicely charred dough crust that sets the foundation for all the flavors.  The mildly sweet yet hearty taste of the San Marzano tomatoes are amplified by the three cheese base topping.  What's remarkable the three cheese base is Mark Ianoco's ability to deliver an initial velvetty sweet flavor from the Fresh Mozzarella that transitions remarkably well to a slightly bitter and coarse flavor (similar to that of La Tur, but certainly not La Tur).  The Pizza is then finished by a mildly salty / sharp finish of the sprinkling of Parmigiano Reggiano that's balanced out the freshness of the Basil.  When the flavors of the various ingredients combined together, the four detectable flavors on the tongue (Sweet, Sour, Salt, and Bitter), are all enticed, thus allowing for each of the various ingredients of Mr. Ianoco's creation to shine both individually and on conjunction.  A simply remarkable well execution of a classic Naples export!To understand Lucali's is to understand the ideology behind The Pizziaolo, Mark Ianoco's, mastery!  Peasantry atmosphere, that's accompanied by over the top ingredients used to create his pizza is what Lucali's is.  With a fixed menu of two items, Lucali's provides what's good, and what's most sought after.  Simply put, the Pizza is not to be overlooked, but rather embodied and appreciated with each and every bite.Notes on Lucali's:- Set Menu:  Pizza: $26.00 - Toppings are based on what Lucali's has available.- Cash Only!  ATMs are hard to find in the neighborhood so bring cash before arriving.- BYOB.  Bring your own bottle of wine to enjoy the occasion.- If you're the jealous type then don't bring the girlfriend.  Significant others have been known to stare at Mr. Ianoco for hours on end.- Wait time can vary between 10 minutes to 2 hours.  Lucali's allows patrons to call ahead and put their names on the wait list.- No reservations, but patrons can call ahead of seating",5.0
"This place is the best new wave pizza spot in the city. I can rant about John's and Totonno's, but Lucali makes a fine pie and has a pleasant setting.

I adore Lucali's lo-fi / keeping it real pizza producing style.No salads! No mozarella chicken sausage fingers! No stuffed crust! No beer! No wine!Just pizza. And the toppings - which are whatever they have that evening.The crust has the perfect amount of charred-ness and the toppings are top notch.They are BYOB.

"I did  not wait at all, so I have nothing to prove. Came for a friends birthday, one of my first meals in New York. From Chicago so I will always prefer deep dish. This pizza was good, after living in Europe the past few years it is equal caliber to any french or italian pizza, though 4 times the price, so that ones a bit hard for me. Calzone was delish!! and of course all the products so fresh/high quality, plus byob. Ambiance great and service as well, thanks Nicole!",4.0
"After not eating bread for a week (Passover) the BF and I headed to Lucali's for some carbohydrate goodness to get us back on track.And oh was it good.  So a Passover themed review:If it had just been cheesy, it would have been enough.If it had it just been saucy, it would have been enough.If it had it just been covered in toppings (basil, shallots and mushrooms), it would have been enough.If it had it just been hot and bready, it would have been enough.If it had the crust with those air bubbles I love, it would have been enough.Dayenu for Lucali's.",4.0
"Best pizza I've ever had, bar none.  One of my favorite things is, if you request extra basil as a topping, they add it AFTER cooking the rest of the pizza instead of before, like what most restaurants will do.  That way the basil is still fresh and delicious instead of being made into a burn victim.  Also, the neighborhood is quaint and quiet, so even if you have to walk around for 45 minutes waiting for your name to come up, you'll still have a great experience.",5.0
"My fiance LOVES pizza and has always raved about the ever-so-far-and-elusive-for-visitors-Di Fara-close-to-end-of-subway-system...just to give you a frame of reference for his taste in pizza.  Some might disagree, but if you agree with him, you might like this place as he continuously reminisces about their food.At Lucali's we ordered the basics as we always do to weed out the good from the bad...We ordered  a margherita (tomato sauce, buffalo mozzarella, and basil)  but tacked on a cheese calzone (as the owner suggested) and asked for extra tomato sauce..  They gave a generous saucerful to dip our calzone and pizza slices in.  But the unusual kicker is,  I dream of the cheese combo in the calzone.  It tastes so creamy and dreamy...I'm such a crazy food addict  and  SO TRY to recreate things I LOVE and this cheese combo is still an annoying mystery to me I want to cry.  I've even tried to make my own ricotta with local milk where i'm from...fail...tried to add certain cheeses that give it a slight bite...fail...I'm wanting the recipe so bad for the cheese calzone (I think there are 5 or 6 cheeses)...please share if you know!!!!This place is extremely tiny so come on off days (weekdays or Sunday).  It's byob or byow.   The setting at night is very cozy and romantic with only dim lights and it feels like you are in someone's rustic kitchen in Italy.It is a bit pricey for pizza, but the whole setting, the love put into each pizza/calzone and quality of ingredients makes it really worth the money and wait.",5.0
"Undoubtedly my favorite pizza in NYC.  While I enjoy Grimaldi's and Motorino, Lucali is easily better than both.  The freshness of the ingredients is unsurpassed and the thin and crispy crust is perfect; lightly charred, it has just enough smokiness and is chewy enough to satisfy without causing your jaw to strain.  Perhaps my favorite aspect of Lucali's pies is the amazing tomato sauce.  The flavorful and balanced sauce is savory without being salty, rich without being heavy, and simple without lacking complexity.  The mozzarella is also outstanding.  Our party of three had two pies (more than enough food):  (1) Margherita (simple and delicious -- Lucali's is the gold standard, in my opinion) and (2) 1/2 pepperoni (great) + 1/2 no cheese with basil, garlic, and mushrooms (tasty even without cheese). Despite its priciness (over $24/pie), distance from my UWS abode, and long wait times (up to 2 hours), Lucali is worth every penny and every minute of traveling and waiting.  Get here before 7pm to minimize the wait; but if you must wait, enjoy a warm or cold drink at the little store around the corner (yelp.com/biz/carroll-del…); while you're at it, pick up some drinks and cash at their ATM because Lucali is cash only & BYOB.",5.0
"The commonly debated topic of best pizza in New York is highly argued with no resolution or agreement in sight.  Of course, the domain of on Mr. Mark Ianoco should be considered one of those in the Elite Company.Lucali's...  Despite It's little known existence just three year's ago, the establishment and operations of Mr. Mark Ianoco has gained such notoriety that it's patron base rivals that of many of New York's highly renowned Pizzerias.  To visit Lucali's is to understand it's Pizza offerings, to dine at Lucali's to be truly humbled.Rachel and I arrived at Lucali's on a Saturday evening at 6:00pm on a spontaneous endeavor.  We began to put our name on the waitlist and was informed that the wait would be 1 hour.  Not too bad given the high recognition given this establishment, thus we proceeded to walk around Carroll Gardens.--- 45 Minutes Later ---We received a call stating that our table was ready.  We immediately rushed back to Lucali's in less than 3 minutes to meet our table obligations.At first entry, patrons will find that the vibrant yet romantic décor of Lucali's is one that's best described as breathtaking and humbling.  With it's rich ivory white walls that's amplified solely by candlelight, the restaurant itself provides a truly romantic feel.  Compared to most other establishments, Lucali's is lit solely by candlelight.  There's no fluorescent tungsten lightening or spotlights from above, the lighting is solely provided by what little sunlight shining through the windows and that of the individual candle placements on each table.  To further describe the establishment, the furniture at Lucali's is comprised of old rustic wooden material, thus aiding in the simplistic feel.  To the immediate back of the restaurant, Mr. Ianoco works under candle lighting to create the various offerings selected by patrons.  With his station finely controlled to his attention, and his patrons under the care of his watchful eye, a feeling of being at home is rendered when dining at Lucali's.  All patrons first entering are greeted by Mr. Ianoco from afar, which aids in the calming tones that surrounds ones sense.  Simply put, the feeling of Lucali's is one that's at ease.  Perhaps Mr. Ianoco's attempt to create an ambient yet peasantry environment worked to his delight, as the quaint and tranquil feel while dining at his establishment is simply superb.The Food:  Great Mastery of Technique, Remarkable Pizza.The Pizza:  A thinly piece of naturally leavened dough is topped with a warm coating of San Marzano Tomato Sauce, and topped with a special three cheese blend.  After removal from the brick oven, the pizza is finished off with a drizzle of Extra Virgin Olive Oil, Fresh Basil, and a Sprinkling of Parmigiano Reggiano.  When consuming Pizziaolo Ianoco's rendition of a classic Naples export, the various flavors derived from his offering is observed as uncanny.  The first notable detection in the Pizza is the nicely charred dough crust that sets the foundation for all the flavors.  The mildly sweet yet hearty taste of the San Marzano tomatoes are amplified by the three cheese base topping.  What's remarkable the three cheese base is Mark Ianoco's ability to deliver an initial velvetty sweet flavor from the Fresh Mozzarella that transitions remarkably well to a slightly bitter and coarse flavor (similar to that of La Tur, but certainly not La Tur).  The Pizza is then finished by a mildly salty / sharp finish of the sprinkling of Parmigiano Reggiano that's balanced out the freshness of the Basil.  When the flavors of the various ingredients combined together, the four detectable flavors on the tongue (Sweet, Sour, Salt, and Bitter), are all enticed, thus allowing for each of the various ingredients of Mr. Ianoco's creation to shine both individually and on conjunction.  A simply remarkable well execution of a classic Naples export!To understand Lucali's is to understand the ideology behind The Pizziaolo, Mark Ianoco's, mastery!  Peasantry atmosphere, that's accompanied by over the top ingredients used to create his pizza is what Lucali's is.  With a fixed menu of two items, Lucali's provides what's good, and what's most sought after.  Simply put, the Pizza is not to be overlooked, but rather embodied and appreciated with each and every bite.Notes on Lucali's:- Set Menu:  Pizza: $26.00 - Toppings are based on what Lucali's has available.- Cash Only!  ATMs are hard to find in the neighborhood so bring cash before arriving.- BYOB.  Bring your own bottle of wine to enjoy the occasion.- If you're the jealous type then don't bring the girlfriend.  Significant others have been known to stare at Mr. Ianoco for hours on end.- Wait time can vary between 10 minutes to 2 hours.  Lucali's allows patrons to call ahead and put their names on the wait list.- No reservations, but patrons can call ahead of seating",5.0
"This place is the best new wave pizza spot in the city. I can rant about John's and Totonno's, but Lucali makes a fine pie and has a pleasant setting. It is minimalist and it is not cheap, but the pizza is terrific and it's BYO to boot. They typically have wait, but you can give them a cell number and head to a bar to sit it out.",5.0
I adore Lucali's lo-fi / keeping it real pizza producing style.No salads! No mozarella chicken sausage fingers! No stuffed crust! No beer! No wine!Just pizza. And the toppings - which are whatever they have that evening.The crust has the perfect amount of charred-ness and the toppings are top notch.They are BYOB. Although they charge a corkage fee - which seems pointless. As if I was going to drink soda for dinner instead.Cons? It's crazy packed. All the time.,5.0
"This place never disappoints! The fresh ingredients and perfectly season sauce make this the best pizza in the neighborhood without a doubt. The cozy and warm vibe makes Lucali worth the wait. I've never had an even mediocre experience there, I always walk out feeling super satisfied and full. Don't forget it's BYOB.",5.0
"Amazing New York style pizza.  After many years thinking Lombardi's pizza is unbeatable, Lucali has definitely changed my mind.  Fresh ingredients really make this pizza something else.  My favorites now are Lucali, Lombardi's and Motorino (in no particular order).  Keep in mind this place is BYOB.",5.0

"I don't think Mark Iacono was necessarily trying to re-create the pizza eating of yore when he took over an old candy shop in his childhood neighborhood, but at Lucali (his very popular pizza spot in Carroll Gardens), you will eat your pizza by candlelight. Alright, there are also very dim electric lights and indoor plumbing, but it was so dark in there, I really had to rely on my very refined palate to decide whether I had the artichoke or the pepperoni pie in my hand.I've been hearing about Lucali more than any other pizzeria in the last few weeks.  Everybody simply raves about the place.  I was warned that the wait could be very long and that it's both BYO and Cash Only. The restaurant was not at all what I was expecting.  It's completely unmarked, except for the crowd of people outside and a chalkboard proclaiming today's fresh ingredients.  See, Lucali serves nothing but pizza and calzones.  Seriously, nothing.  No drinks, no sides, no dessert.  I'm lucky we got a round of water.  And I guess it's that sort of minimalism that makes this place interesting.Watching Iacono make the pizzas behind the bar, reminded me of pizza legend Domenico DeMarco (from Di Fara) except this guy moves about five times faster.  The technique was very much the same and as I learned later, Iacono studied DeMarco to perfect his pizzas.And I'm not sure if it was all the hype or what, but these pizzas aren't quite as good as Di Fara's.  Sorry.  The pies were huge (they better be for about $30 each) and I noticed some of the corniciones (end crusts) had cracked.  I picked them up and they fell apart.  I'm all for thin crust, believe me, but they have to stay intact.  And the other thing I noticed was that the dough was rather dry. On the bright side, I did think all the toppings were very fresh.  Over the course of two pies, I tried artichoke hearts, mushrooms, garlic, pepperoni, and shallots.  My biggest gripe was that they were way too-expensive.  I mean, $3 for garlic??  For that price, I could have a year's supply from the grocery store.  And a year's supply of bad breath, to boot!The cheese was creamy and the tomato sauce had nice acidity to it.  The basil was well-proportioned and fresh.  I did find the body of the pizza to be a bit wet, which was (I guess a nice) contrast to the dry crusts.  And the flavor (thanks to the fresh ingredients) was pretty tasty.I think the pizza is over-priced (even with all the fresh produce) and doesn't touch the quality and deliciousness of Di Fara (a similarly expensive pizza meal).-eatthisny",3.0
"What can I say about Lucali that hasn't already been said? 225+ reviews and 4.5 stars? Well-deserved for sure.Everything about my experience here was great. Here's why:- 1.5 hour wait turned out to be only about 30-40 minutes.- It's tucked away in a nice and quiet little neighborhood in Brooklyn.- Ambiance, ambiance, ambiance. The decor of the restaurant is adorable and it's got this rustic, authentic Italian charm.- You can watch them make the pizza right in front of you (refer to pictures), so you KNOW exactly what's going on in the kitchen. - I haven't ever tasted authentic Italian pizza (I will this summer though!), but I think that Lucali's would come pretty darn close.- All the servers are pretty females (I know, I'm a girl but hey, I'm allowed to admire my own species)!- BOTH the pizza AND calzone were sooo good. I really don't think you can go wrong with either one and I like that their menu is simple (those are the only 2 items on the menu, though you can personalize it by adding toppings). Neither were too heavy or overbearing! (That's saying a lot, especially because we're talking about pizza and carbs here.)Overall, I would DEFINITELY go back and might even consider venturing all the way to Brooklyn just to eat here again.

"yes, a thousand times yes.special little place on henry with no sign on the door. they have an easel in front with all available toppings. basically you order a large pie and choose toppings (~$3/ea). i want to try their calzone next time. byob which is great since there's a convenience store right on the corner! picked up some yeungling.due to the summer heat they have a rope on the front door with a sign that says it's in efforts to preserve a/c. since they open at 6, put your name down asap (we were the first ones that day what what) and walk around the waterfront for a bit. this area's so dangerous since there's everything from lucali's to pok pok to calexico. you get there a little before 6 and there's already a crowd waiting. they call you by name and have a table ready with waters. you can open up some beers and keep the rest chilled in their fridge.the oven's right in the back, and you can see everything that goes on. ordered a pie with shallots mushrooms and hot peppers. turnaround time is relatively fast, and the service was so kind. pizza, so unbelievably good. crispy crust, nice flavor, very impressed. FRESH BASIL on top makes it. took the rest home and gave the rest of our beer to an elderly couple sitting outside of their apt.NOTE: CASH ONLY",5.0
"Lucali was on my to-visit list for a long time, and has subsequently been on my to-review list for quite a while. I couldn't figure out quite what to say about it. It's garnered accolades from so many different directions, lowly Yelpers up on through the NY Times. Alan Richman said it was the second-best pizzeria in the U.S., for Pete's sake.So I'd love to chalk up my markedly disappointing experience there mostly to deflated expectations. Maybe if it hadn't had so much hype, I would have appreciated it more...? That's what I kept telling myself in the aftermath. After a while, I decided I shouldn't even review the place: my gut reaction to the place was so different from most that clearly something was wrong with *me* in this case. The funny thing is, despite my voraciously omnivoric tendencies, in the familiar genres I am generally pretty mainstream in my tastes. It was a weird disconnect.Because I so want to like the place. Single pizzaiolo, churning out every single pie. Rustic decor and candlelit long before the rest of gentrified Brooklyn took the aesthetic to loony extremes. Quality ingredients, applied with obvious love.But I just hated the pizza, man. I just hated it.I mean, what the F was with that crust? Char. I love me some carcinogenic char. I liked the char on the margherita pie my convive and I shared. But when the creation of char comes at the dear expense of the rest of the crust, drying it out to a cracker consistency when the sauce and cheese are not designed for such a dessicated bed... Then it is a soul error against pizza.  Sure, the cheese: good. Nicely flavored sauce. Impeccably fresh basil. All of it slid off the bedding like water off a duck. A bone-dry, reconstituted sawdust kind of duck. I'm used to slippery toppings at the hyper-Neapolitan joints around town, where it seems a necessary evil (as if the Associazione Verace Pizza Napoletana wants to make damn sure you'll need a fork for their specimens). But at a place where you can pick up the slice without sag (BECAUSE HOW COULD SUCH BRITTLE ARIDITY EVER SAG?), this skittery topping business should be a non-issue.Okay. Breathe. Stop criticizing. Concentrate on the positive. The calzone was pretty good. Not Keste or anything in that department, but solid. And it really is some beautiful decor for a pizzeria. It's nice to have that communal feeling with other food lovers whilst braving the long wait. And it's BYOB.So ignore this review. Go. Pity me but abandon me all the same in my Donatella-Paulie Gee-Zero Otto Nove-Franny's ghetto. I'll welcome you to it if it comes to that, don't worry.Probability of return within 1 year: 0%",2.0
"Best pizza in NYC.  Note 1 - Get the pizza plain.  You will thank yourself.  And if Mark, you know, the owner, prefers his plain - you should too.Note 2 - Make sure your girlfriend does not have a good view of Mark, because she will stare at him in his hunky glory as he makes the pies. Note 3 - The atmosphere is good.  If you come here enough, the same tracks play over and over again.  It can get annoying hah.Note 4 - It's best to come in the middle of the week.  While I live in the vicinity, it's a bit too much for me to come by on a Friday at 430pm just to leave my name for later on in the evening.  Also, it's not the best idea to come here with more than 2 people.  If you're desperate for Lucali, stick with 2.  Any more and there's usually a longer wait.Note 5 - Bring a bottle of wine - $4 BYOB.  Bring some cold beers.  The wait can get long.  And in the warmer months, as it gets darker, you may or not be able to sip on a cold one on the benches outside.Note 6 - A certain Brooklyn legend frequents this place.  The servers as well as Mark have talked about him to me on several occasions.  Follow his Blueprint and stop by.Note 7 - I am eagerly awaiting Giuseppina's, Mark's brother's pizza place which will eventually open in Park Slope.",5.0
"I am ASHAMED of myself. I have lived, for four years, three blocks away from this restaurant - ahem sorry, kitchen - and never been in there. I've passed by its door a thousand times, heard about it a gazillion times, alas, never been inside. But hey, it's not my fault. The place opens after 6 pm. It's on ""the other way"" of my regular path to the subway. And frankly, if I ever walk by it at night, it's probably because I am quite drunk and made a wrong left turn instead of a right one, so I usually fail to notice this place... No signs or anything... Well, they do have a sign, a ""street sign which reads HENRY STR."" but it's hanging from a pole and it is unsatisfactorily located INSIDE the place. So, you get the picture...As they say: ""better late then never"". We've been there tonight, and, well, I've nothing more to add to the reviews. But I can, with a full stomach and a full heart say or, rather shout, that IT IS THE BEST DARN PIZZA I'VE EVER EATEN IN MY LIFE! AND I'VE EATEN PIZZA IN ROMA, VENEZIA AND FRENZE!Now that we've got that out of our systems, here are the details:1. Call them, after 6. They tell you when you MAY come over, and give you a call before that. No reservations!2. They are awesome people; warm smiling beautiful and handsome (I'm not kidding)3. They tell you ""oh, we may have a table in like 45 minutes, but definitely before an hour, would you like that?"" and you tell them ""sure, I'm waiting for your call. I live 3 blocks from you"" and they call you in 5 minutes and say ""we have a table for  you if you can make it in 3 minutes"" and you leave home in 30 seconds and be there in under 2.The prices are CHEAP! I mean they are what they ought to be. A pizza (they do have one size only, but amazing toppings, fresh toppings) is about $20 and with the toppings it comes to ~$30.You have to bring your own wine, booze, what-ever - $4 charge (I'm sure somebody wrote these somewhere below - or above. But I am so full of dough and stuff and wine now and wield them as excuses for not reading stuff - and making horrible grammar mistakes)Anyway. The ambiance is what everybody said it is, just a beautiful kitchen with low lighting and amazing pizza.We went there 3 people, had a pizza, had a calzone, and I wasn't quite full so I wanted them to cook me something like bread so that I can go on licking the sauce off the bottom of the plate. They not only cooked me bread (pita sort of) but they also gave me another plate full of sauce (the guy just carried it over in a cup and poured it into the plate - must be thinking quite highly of me). We brought our own wine,  well actually, after learning that it is BOYOB we just left people at the table and ran back to the liquor shop and bought a bottle and ran back. The bill was $45.I am so happy, I can cry. Maybe I may have, not really sure there. Oh wait, I can't cry - I'm dead inside. Oh well.[Edit | January 27, 2008] I've been there again tonight. I would like to share a feeling that I've experienced - hence the weird edit. This place FEELS LIKE HOME. I don't know why, maybe it's the music, maybe it's the waitresses, maybe it's the entire aura of the atmosphere. It just does. I feel happy inside. I feel happy when they call me back and say ""we have a table in a few minutes, start running"". Maybe it's the heart warming smile on everybody's faces. I have no clue.

"yes, a thousand times yes.special little place on henry with no sign on the door. they have an easel in front with all available toppings. basically you order a large pie and choose toppings (~$3/ea). i want to try their calzone next time. byob which is great since there's a convenience store right on the corner! picked up some yeungling.due to the summer heat they have a rope on the front door with a sign that says it's in efforts to preserve a/c. since they open at 6, put your name down asap (we were the first ones that day what what) and walk around the waterfront for a bit. this area's so dangerous since there's everything from lucali's to pok pok to calexico. you get there a little before 6 and there's already a crowd waiting. they call you by name and have a table ready with waters. you can open up some beers and keep the rest chilled in their fridge.the oven's right in the back, and you can see everything that goes on. ordered a pie with shallots mushrooms and hot peppers. turnaround time is relatively fast, and the service was so kind. pizza, so unbelievably good. crispy crust, nice flavor, very impressed. FRESH BASIL on top makes it. took the rest home and gave the rest of our beer to an elderly couple sitting outside of their apt.NOTE: CASH ONLY",5.0
"Lucali was on my to-visit list for a long time, and has subsequently been on my to-review list for quite a while. I couldn't figure out quite what to say about it. It's garnered accolades from so many different directions, lowly Yelpers up on through the NY Times. Alan Richman said it was the second-best pizzeria in the U.S., for Pete's sake.So I'd love to chalk up my markedly disappointing experience there mostly to deflated expectations. Maybe if it hadn't had so much hype, I would have appreciated it more...? That's what I kept telling myself in the aftermath. After a while, I decided I shouldn't even review the place: my gut reaction to the place was so different from most that clearly something was wrong with *me* in this case. The funny thing is, despite my voraciously omnivoric tendencies, in the familiar genres I am generally pretty mainstream in my tastes. It was a weird disconnect.Because I so want to like the place. Single pizzaiolo, churning out every single pie. Rustic decor and candlelit long before the rest of gentrified Brooklyn took the aesthetic to loony extremes. Quality ingredients, applied with obvious love.But I just hated the pizza, man. I just hated it.I mean, what the F was with that crust? Char. I love me some carcinogenic char. I liked the char on the margherita pie my convive and I shared. But when the creation of char comes at the dear expense of the rest of the crust, drying it out to a cracker consistency when the sauce and cheese are not designed for such a dessicated bed... Then it is a soul error against pizza.  Sure, the cheese: good. Nicely flavored sauce. Impeccably fresh basil. All of it slid off the bedding like water off a duck. A bone-dry, reconstituted sawdust kind of duck. I'm used to slippery toppings at the hyper-Neapolitan joints around town, where it seems a necessary evil (as if the Associazione Verace Pizza Napoletana wants to make damn sure you'll need a fork for their specimens). But at a place where you can pick up the slice without sag (BECAUSE HOW COULD SUCH BRITTLE ARIDITY EVER SAG?), this skittery topping business should be a non-issue.Okay. Breathe. Stop criticizing. Concentrate on the positive. The calzone was pretty good. Not Keste or anything in that department, but solid. And it really is some beautiful decor for a pizzeria. It's nice to have that communal feeling with other food lovers whilst braving the long wait. And it's BYOB.So ignore this review. Go. Pity me but abandon me all the same in my Donatella-Paulie Gee-Zero Otto Nove-Franny's ghetto. I'll welcome you to it if it comes to that, don't worry.Probability of return within 1 year: 0%",2.0
"Best pizza in NYC.  Note 1 - Get the pizza plain.  You will thank yourself.  And if Mark, you know, the owner, prefers his plain - you should too.Note 2 - Make sure your girlfriend does not have a good view of Mark, because she will stare at him in his hunky glory as he makes the pies. Note 3 - The atmosphere is good.  If you come here enough, the same tracks play over and over again.  It can get annoying hah.Note 4 - It's best to come in the middle of the week.  While I live in the vicinity, it's a bit too much for me to come by on a Friday at 430pm just to leave my name for later on in the evening.  Also, it's not the best idea to come here with more than 2 people.  If you're desperate for Lucali, stick with 2.  Any more and there's usually a longer wait.Note 5 - Bring a bottle of wine - $4 BYOB.  Bring some cold beers.  The wait can get long.  And in the warmer months, as it gets darker, you may or not be able to sip on a cold one on the benches outside.Note 6 - A certain Brooklyn legend frequents this place.  The servers as well as Mark have talked about him to me on several occasions.  Follow his Blueprint and stop by.Note 7 - I am eagerly awaiting Giuseppina's, Mark's brother's pizza place which will eventually open in Park Slope.",5.0
"I am ASHAMED of myself. I have lived, for four years, three blocks away from this restaurant - ahem sorry, kitchen - and never been in there. I've passed by its door a thousand times, heard about it a gazillion times, alas, never been inside. But hey, it's not my fault. The place opens after 6 pm. It's on ""the other way"" of my regular path to the subway. And frankly, if I ever walk by it at night, it's probably because I am quite drunk and made a wrong left turn instead of a right one, so I usually fail to notice this place... No signs or anything... Well, they do have a sign, a ""street sign which reads HENRY STR."" but it's hanging from a pole and it is unsatisfactorily located INSIDE the place. So, you get the picture...As they say: ""better late then never"". We've been there tonight, and, well, I've nothing more to add to the reviews.

Everything about this place was kind of disappointing and dissonant in that way. Do they really only have pepperoni? No prosciutto or pancetta or even salami? I was surprised that a restaurant decked in old world, rustic Italian decor would not offer real Italian charcuterie. Smoke and mirrors in good old authentic Brooklyn??? why I never.Also the candle at the table smelled so strong that I had to blow it out just to be able to breathe and regain my appetite.

Our server was only seen twice during our meal and honestly, I hate to be this person, but it seriously must be mentioned...if I waited tables at a restaurant frequented by Jay Z & Beyonce then I would wear something other than a HOODIE and yoga pants. Everything about this place was kind of disappointing and dissonant in that way. Do they really only have pepperoni? No prosciutto or pancetta or even salami? I was surprised that a restaurant decked in old world, rustic Italian decor would not offer real Italian charcuterie. Smoke and mirrors in good old authentic Brooklyn??? why I never.Also the candle at the table smelled so strong that I had to blow it out just to be able to breathe and regain my appetite. Come on, no smelly candles, that's restaurateur 101! I really miss Di Fara's.",2.0
"My friends and I attempted to go to Lucali on Friday, November 9, 2012, but it was closed for renovations. There was no date displayed for their re-opening. Sad face. However, from all the buzz, I'm sure that I WOULD'VE given the restaurant 5 stars.",5.0
"I LOOOOOOOVE Lucali!!!! For ambiance is just perfect! Candle lit, old-school Italian, with a clean rustic appearance.  The chef is often there cooking with his staff right in front of you. You can see them spin the pizza doe and gracefully spread the pristine sauce and decadent cheese on the pie. They also have all of the fresh produce they are using for toppings that day laid out and ready to chop for your individual pizza. I for one am not the biggest calzone fan but I will have at least two servings of theirs!!! It's just the best pizza experience I have ever had and you should go!!!",5.0
"A moment of silence for the pizza.  Ahhhh.  The crust is crispy, but not burnt.  It folds properly.  The local ingredients are lovely and fresh, but in no way do they scream ""healthy"".  (If you're looking for healthy pizza, try California.)   As for the location, and the pain-in-the-ass factor...cute street, lovely rustic interior.  The low counters enable you to watch the whole beautiful pizza-process happen before your eyes.  Don't even think about trying to get a table past 8:30 on a weekend evening.  Once the ingredients run low, no more seatings.  It took us a few tries to figure this out.  Come on a weekday night (early-ish) or on a weekend (very early).  On the up side...though you'll have to wait (and wait, and wait?) for a table, you can BYOB and they'll provide you with glasses so you can drink on the benches outside.  The BYO-factor makes this place more than affordable.  And now back to the pizza...",4.0

"Ahh! Another burnt pizza place... I'm beginning to think that people like their pizza charred. The wait was very long and the pizza was very expensive. Besides the charred sections, which I discarded, the pizza was good and the toppings were fresh.",3.0
"A collection of misguided and patriotic americans will claim that the red white and blue has more of a claim on pizza than it's homeland of Italy.  Such a statement is what gives us the name ""home of the brave"".  Lucali's, however, is a land unto itself.  A pizza parlor where the host, and craftsman are the same.  Mark Iacono sweetly hummed guantanamera while rolling the dough with old vino bottles.  Despite a busy night, he stopped rolling dough to pull my espresso.  The ambiance is mystery.  The dish is pizza.  You will find very little else on the menu(mostly because a menu does not exist).  What god is to heaven, pizza is to earth.  If you can't afford a plane trip to naples, rough up $327 and fly yourself to brooklyn.",5.0
"My friend and I have been going to many pizza places over the last two to three years trying to find which one is the best. We have eaten in many states and as far away as California. When we read about Lucali we felt we had to try it to see how it compares with all the others we have tried. The best thing I can say about this place is that the staff tries really hard to please. After that, the pizza is one of the worst we have ever tasted. The dough was hard and tasteless. The sauce was not much better. We all went away with a feeling of total disappointment. There are too many good pizza places in the City to waste your time coming here.",1.0
"Ok so I love pizza and I thought this would be great.  I order pepperoni, and basil  the cheese was mostly in the center, and super heavy and thick.  by the 2nd slice the bottom of the pizza was already soggy.  It was definitely good but still my hands down for pizza is Grimaldis.The pizza was 27 for the two toppings.  it's byob which i think it's pretty sweet since a bottle of wine can be 28 to start.  It's fairly small and I bet at most it sits maybe 30 people at a time.  There is always a wait so get there early if you can help it.  It's dimly lit so somewhat romantic and rustic so good for a date as well as groups.  Nice Sinatra music playing and you can see the guys making the pizza fresh.  Overall definitely good pizza, and worth a try tons of toppings and they also have calzones which i bet are winners.  I'll try the next time since I wasn't so excited about the pizza.  But definitely worth the visit to experience it.",4.0
"Okay, so maybe my 5 stars are a little biased because my boyfriend discovered an old work buddy is one of the pizza makers here & he gave us a free calzone since he was happy to catch up & that just made my day :)But regardless, Lucali is amazing! We arrived at 5:45 and so we were seated for the first dinner shift, lucky us, the very next couple had an hour wait since they didn't make the cut. The sauce is to die for and the cheese is the perfect blend of gooey and salty pizza perfection. The calzone was delicious. The ricotta was just sweet enough, not overly so at all. The oooooonly thing I can kind of say was a downside was that they didn't have pepperoni tonight (but to be honest, that was just a whim decision, I prefer margheritas anyway) and the crust is a bit too charred and there's more of it than I would like. I want more of their delicious pizza goodness! $27 bucks for a large plain pie and 2 sodas (and a free calzone ;]), absolutely doable for an early Friday night dinner in NYC. Do yourself a favor and visit.",5.0
"Really cute date night spot. It was an hour wait but well worth it. It's byob which is awesome and only menu options are pizza or calzones. They tell you what the toppings for the night are and you make your own pizza. We did mushroom, pepperoni and onions and it was amazing! They also had Frank Sinatra playing which added a nice touch to the dim  lighting and ambiance. Highly recommend this place and will be back.",4.0
"Here's the deal. This is the second best pizza in all of New York City, and that of course means the world. The best is Di Fara and I won't argue with you on that. So let's start with that as the basis of fact for this review.This place makes an absolutely fantastic pie. That's it. This is as close to perfection as it gets. Just get the plain cheese pie. You don't need anything fancy anyway to ruin this fresh pie perfection.The downside is that the place has gotten way too trendy, and as a result I don't go here anymore. First, for me to leave Manhattan for pizza it has to be as good as this place makes it. Second, this is still pizza and I'm not going to wait two hours for it. Once things calm down I'll go back. Ah, I miss the days when this place first opened, before the press and great reviews, when we could go and eat great pizza without the scene.Enjoy Lucali Pizza at least once so you know what great pizza is.* I want to add a short addendum to my review. I read a few other reviews of this place and it seems people are fighting to get in, and waiting several hours. People, we all enjoy good pizza. I put pizza near the top of my favorite foods list and I consider myself an elite pizza eater and highly esteemed pizza connoisseur.  But people, you need a reality check if you are expending this kind if aggravation and energy on Pizza. Pizza! If you say you want to wait for a special nite at Babbo, OK maybe. But please, don't find yourself in a place in your life where you need to stress over pizza. It's only pizza.

Sure, now I am friendly with a lot of folks here, but not because I'm anybody special: Mark and the staff reward loyalty, like anyone else!  Yeah, the waits are long; there are no secrets in New York.

Have you asked for their white pizza? I did last week and he made it right. Amazing cheesy explosion with a perfect blend of flavors. I used to think Totonno's had the best the best white in Brooklyn. I stand corrected. Watch me eat it:  bit.ly/9x2ny6,5.0
"It was very good pizza... butI think some people have objections in principle that I don't necessarily share: of making pizza that big a deal, serving it in a candlelit setting with music, and giving it a date place feel. I'm ok with that generally, but I do think the wait and the hype is a bit unfounded, for this pizza and for any pizza that I can really imagine. Unless the wait itself is fun, like at Shake Shack when I'm just hanging out in a park, no matter how good a burger or slice is it's still just casual food and shouldn't be made otherwise. In this case we called around 5:30-6:00 for a table, was told 8:30 which is when we showed up, but didn't sit till 9:30 which is a bit much. As for the food, it's only calzones and pizzas right now.  We split two small mushroom calzones between the 4 of us which were pretty good. Although the mushrooms couldn't stand up to the cheese and didn't really assert themselves, would've added in another ingredient or swapped in something bolder. The our table got a grilled artichoke pizza which was very good, more subtle in flavor but quality ingredients. Followed by a pie with pepperoni and fresh hot peppers, which had really strong flavors and what ended up being a good combo, and stood out over the artichoke. Ingredients thoughout were legit, really fresh and of great quality.  Across the board I thought the dough was pretty good, had enough structure to not flop out and get soggy in the center which I hate about most ""artisanal pizza"". It wasn't perfect though in that it could've used a few more degrees of moisture and on its own was a bit bland. I left crust on the plate which should never be, and we picked up the habit of asking for extra sauce to use on the crust which says something too.",4.0
"I am so glad to have discovered Lucali - it was truly the shining star of my recent trip to NYC. After some very mediocre slices in Manhattan, I was beginning to wonder what all the hype was about east coast pizza.

It is BYOB, which is a ++ in my book. We also called ahead to get our name on the list - no reservations, thank goodness, because as the dollface of a server said ""we would have a 3 month wait if we took 'em."" The wait was an hour and a half, so we dawdled and found a little bar to duck into for some pre-dinner libations.

"Lucali brings to mind an old saying of Henry Ford.  ""Any customer can have anything he wants to eat, as long as it's pizza...or calzones.""  That is how it went, right?  Regardless, the point is Lucali is a bare-bones type joint.  It works just right for them, though, because their pizza is easily top-5 fare.  At $24 a pie (without toppings) it's a little harder on the wallet than even some of the more touristy locales, but when you consider that one pie easily feeds 2-3 people the price per person isn't bad at all.That all being said, I would STRENUOUSLY recommend you do not go to Lucali on the weekend.  I have been there numerous times on weekday evenings, been seated immediately, and had friendly, attentive service.  However, the one time I attempted to go on a friday night with some friends, we were treated like morons by their extremely rude hostess for attempting to do something as silly as patronize their establishment.  Full disclosure: I work in the restaurant industry; I know what it's like to be on her end of the transaction.  When we first asked for a table, she actually just laughed.  We thought she was kidding, so we asked again at which point she became a little hostile and explained that we would have had to come at 5PM and put our name on the list to even think about getting a table.  There was no one waiting outside, and we were understandably confused, because although this IS a reservation of sorts, she kept insisting they don't take reservations.  They apparently call you on the phone when a table opens up, a policy none of us were familiar with, and were treated poorly for this lack of knowledge.In a nutshell: Lucali consistently offers up some of the best pizza in New York.  But attempt a Friday or Saturday night visit at your own risk.",4.0

"It's almost unfair to rate pizza shops in New York City since everyone knows the best one, everyone's got a favorite slice and in general, there's always some subliminal bias tied to it... Say, which borough it's in or how esoteric it is.Lucali is an amazing pizza shop. I've been to many in Brooklyn, from the greasy slice place in every neighborhood to the high, mighty and gourmet emporia of more recent days (this is closer to the latter) where a pie costs twice what it should and the wait is thrice as long as any normal person should stand around to eat what used to be peasant food. OK, that was a bitchy way to start. Sorry, back to Lucali...Their pizza is really good - It's all fresh mozzarella-type with rustic, almost gourmet bread-quality crust (maybe the water in Brooklyn really does make the difference). The pies are huge and they've remained very, very basic with the technique applied to the crust and to the ingredients you can have put on your pizza. There is no foie gras to be had and they left the truffle oil in their shopping cart at Eli's, where it belongs (seriously, what is with the gratuitous use of truffle oil on everything at some places in this city?). The toppings available are essentially the type you'll find at many typical New York City pizza places - Basic, occasionally necessary and all very enjoyable (you know, pepperoni, peppers, mushrooms, etc.). The pies are all made to order and there's a certain old-fashioned and clearly authentic element to them that I appreciate. The menu is otherwise limited with some small appetizer and/or calzone-related offerings (the calzone was very good, by the way), although the pizza is what it's all about. The shop itself is essential Old Brooklyn to me. I think it was a former luncheonette/general store-type thing because of the remnants of old lighting, signs, shelves, and the old awning outside that all point toward that. Very (very!) dimly lit with exposed brick and cramped beyond belief, it does not belie its location in Carroll Gardens, which I always think of as a relatively old-school neighborhood anyway. This is, however, by no means a neighborhood hang-out. I am told that pizza enthusiasts come from far-and-wide to dine here, and the crowd is certainly diverse. The wait staff is an assortment of adorable locals with a good deal of enthusiasm. They're extremely friendly and accommodating (even with diners who ask too many questions and/or can't make up their mind), and I think that in itself adds a certain quality element to the place. Lucali is also BYOB, which is a nice touch (they'll uncork your bottle and provide you glasses), so you can bring your own Montepulciano (or Franzia...) to please. The only problem I have with this place is the fact that they have limited hours and don't take reservations. Of course, neither of those is limited to Lucali itself, but indulge me while I regale you with tales of the time we were more-or-less told that they're too good for reservations. I am confounded. Bad enough that they have a very limited amount of seats, but when we cheekily inquired with the owner/""pizzaiolo"" (a k a the guy flipping the dough) about this policy, the answer became clear. Owning a popular restaurant in South Brooklyn (it used to be called that, my father tells me) that serves food that follows fad allows restauranteurs and chefs to give self-importance a new meaning.... and while serving pizza (like I said, former/current (?) peasant food!).

"This joint is the creation of Mark Iacono and takes the place of a soda fountain once known for making some of the last real egg creams in Brooklyn.

The recipes, too, are from the neighborhood, having come from Mr. Iacono's grandma and aunts.The space, much of it built out by Mr. Iacono himself, feels like a large homey kitchen that, oh, just happens to have a pizza oven in it. Mr. Iacono prepares his pies in full view of the dining room on a marble-top work table. He tops them with a fresh-tasting sauce made from canned San Marzano tomatoes; a cheese combo of regular fresh and imported buffalo mozzarellas and a generous dusting of just-grated grana padano. He adds to that a judicious bit of garlic and basil before sliding his pies into his self-built gas-assisted wood-fired oven. The oven, he estimates, hovers around 800 degrees, and it cooks the pies in somewhere between two to four minutes, depending on the heat.It all makes a thin, crisp, amazing pie.",5.0

The pizza was absolutely amazing! i loved the large pieces of basil on top as it gave it a very fresh taste. The crust was perfectly crunchy and soft, charred very nicely.

"I've been walking by the crowds at Lucali for over a year now, waiting for the right evening to satiate my pizza craving. My expectations were high, very high, and while I wasn't disappointed with Lucali, I wasn't particularly smitten either. I've had a lot of great pizza in my life, it happens to be my favorite thing to eat. The ingredients at Lucali were all excellent, tasty sauce, high quality fresh mozzarella, but there was something lacking in the overall effect of the pie. If it was a glass of red wine, I would say that it felt thin on the palette. The crust was of ideal thickness, but it didn't have the yeasty taste of interest that a truly fine Neopolitan pie has. The flavor of the bread was rather pedestrian. And for that price, I expect more. Needless to say, I won't be running back here to stand in line anytime soon - there are better and more affordable pizza experiences to be had in BK and Manhattan.",3.0
"I'm from California and I've been eating west coast pizza all my life. It's okay but I don't order it unless friends want it or I'm in a rush to grab a quick meal.If Lucali in Brooklyn was in CA, I'd probably have pizza 4-5 times a week. It was so good!

"In my opinion Di Fara still reigns supreme in the world of Brooklyn/Manhattan pizza joints. If I had to pick a place that came in second, I would pick Lucali. The pizza is great and the service is fantastic. There were 6 of us tonight and we paid $24 per pizza with no toppings after we added toppings our grand total came to $70. That means that we spent $22 on toppings alone. In my opinion that is ridiculous. We had 4 toppings which included red peppers, shallots, artichoke hearts, and mushrooms. All of which are not worth $22 on a pizza. It was good but $70 for two pizzas is a bit absurd.The pizza itself was pretty awesome. The crust was perfectly crispy and the freshness of the mozzarella really came out in the flavor of the pizza. It's not too saucy and those bites that include a slightly charred crust are what it's all about.Di Fara is still my favorite but Lucali is the best runner-up that I could think of in this city where pizza is one of those foods that shaped the city.The BYOB over candlelight is definitely a nice touch too.",4.0

"I have to give this place five stars ... even though:1. The location's a fucking drag2. The wait was an hour plus (Friday night without a reservation).I think we closed the place. The pizza was not my favorite of all time, not even in New York, but it was definitely like... the most authentic, I guess. It was really, really good though. The crust is really thin and they have a ton of fresh vegetables as toppings, was pretty solid. We also got a calzone for the whole table, which was great, it was basically a pizza turned in on itself. I've never had pizza experience like this in New York. Given the location, the owner definitely isn't just some bro out to make a buck, he really loves making pizza etc. The restaurant itself is really nice, not very big, dimly lit, smoking hot waitresses. I don't know if I'll make the trip again but it was a good experience. OH and it was cheap. Not what you'd expect at all.",5.0
"Best pizza EVER. My best friend and I set out to try all the ""great"" pizza's of NYC (we made it to Lombardi's, Grimaldi's, Keste, and some other forgettable ones) and after this place I feel that the search is over. I rave about this place to all my friends.In any case, if you want a pizza outing that is about the atmosphere as much as it is about the pizza, this place is for you. Whether you are coming on a date or a small gathering of friends or family, it's perfect.It is very quaint/ small/ intimate, lighted mainly by candles and a few low-lit ceiling lamps. Atmosphere feels very rustic Italian. The bathroom has a fun, vintage, surprise too.As for food, all they offer is GREAT pizza and toppings, and calzone (haven't tried that yet as there is usually no room left after the pizza). I love a place that is focused on just the pizza, makes it that much more special. A pie for two people is absolutely doable if you come hungry, they even reheated our last slice as per our request. Fresh ingredients ALL the time+ candles everywhere + BYOB = BEST pizza outing. EVER.",5.0
"After several weeks of restaurant hopping in NY and having the indifferent, the ok and the average this was the worthy end.   The best meal I have had in NY and one of the better ones I have ever had.  We went on a Monday, slightly fearful of the rumored crowds.  As we weaved there through the back streets of Carroll Gardens, I started getting a bit nervous. We had both read a lot about this place and it wouldn't take much to be let down.  On a perfect early summer evening, warm enough for T Shirts and flip flops and perfect for a relaxed dribble through the streets we really wanted more than passable.The interior, as you will see from the pictures is a cut down wood tabled bistro; open straight onto the kitchen and the oven.  It is probably one of the more romantic places I have eaten.Basically the place had me at ""please wait 20 minutes"".  Then it owned me when the waitress offered to put my spare beers in the fridge.  Then I gave it my soul when she checked after our first pizza when we wanted the chef to start on the calzone so the food was timed perfectly.  And this was before the food.The plain pizza with basil was perfect. No point going further. The calzone was good, though not for me, too much ricotta and too little crude backstreet calzone action. Having been raised on thumping chunks of calzone that leak their ingredients all over the table it was a bit too classy.The plain pizza though.... Praise be.Everyone notes the prices.  However, all of this cost us 46 dollars and we didn't need the calzone (and I have a hunger).  For the breath of the experience it is a deal.  Now the problem is I just have to force myself not to go back every night for the next 5 nights I am in NY.",5.0
"I have been hearing about this place from friends for quite some time now. So, last friday i finally got a chance to experience Lucali for myself. Since they do not take reservations, we got there early, thinking there would be less of a wait. The place has no sign out front, just an awning with big windows. Walking up to the place I immediately got a waft of garlic. It made my hungry tummy grumble wishing i could just go in and eat. The hostess took my name and number saying she would call when our table was ready, in about 45 min. I thought that was pretty cool, because then we didn't have to wait right in front of the place. We walked down the street to go buy some wine. A few blocks down we walked into a cute little wine shop and asked the gentleman behind the counter for a recommendation, he knew we were going to Lucali. He suggested a modestly priced bottle ($11) of montelpuciano, an italian red.  We walked back to the restaurant and waited out front. When she finally called my name, we excitedly walked in to our adorable rustic table. The first thing i heard from the table behind me was ""Sooo Vinny cawled me...."" The whole back of the place is the kitchen area, and you can watch the handsome men in their cute white tees making pies, rolling out the dough with emptied wine bottles. The whole place is very dim lighting, but not too dim, very romantic. We ordered a pie with artichoke and a calzone with red peppers and pepperoni. The pie came out super fast, and was deeeee-licous. I wouldn't say the best pizza i've ever had, but definitely  in the top 5. Between the three of us we scarfed it down, not even looking up to talk to each other, within minutes. Then came the calzone. Make sure to ask for sauce on the side if you want it. The calzone was yummy. I'm usually not a big fan of pepperoni, but this pepperoni was delicious and had a little spiciness to it. Although, next time i won't get the red peppers, they are so finely chopped, i could barely taste them. Then, we ordered another pie. This time with garlic. Which made me realize that the first pie would have been better with garlic. I left the restaurant entirely happy, and a little buzzed.I would definitely recommend this place for a date or just even if you want a good slice of pie. They only serve two things on the menu, pizza and calzones, so that makes it really easy :) The only reason i gave the place 4 stars instead of 5 was because our water glasses could have been filled a little more frequently, and it's a little expensive. Pies are $24 and calzones are either $10 or $20. Dinner for 3 was $85 before tip (for 2 pies and 2 calzones).",4.0
"This pizza is ok...nothing special. I mean I am not knocking it at all, in fact I say go here and support this local business. But I mean with so much pizza in Brooklyn, this place just does not jump out at me as original or amazing.It gets 3 stars based on their good food and very nice decor. Good service too.",3.0
"I went on a Thursday and called ahead to make sure that I would not get stuck in the legendarily long wait times. I have tried on other nights only to be told the wait time was about 2 hours. The atmosphere is lovely and with all the candlelight, very romantic. The place is BYOB which is fabulous. The pizza was absolutely amazing! i loved the large pieces of basil on top as it gave it a very fresh taste. The crust was perfectly crunchy and soft, charred very nicely. Lucali is pretty bare bones: pizza and calzones...nothing else. The effort is put into turning out high quality and deliciously simple food. The wait staff wasn't overly friendly but got the job done efficiently.",5.0
"I've been walking by the crowds at Lucali for over a year now, waiting for the right evening to satiate my pizza craving. My expectations were high, very high, and while I wasn't disappointed with Lucali, I wasn't particularly smitten either. I've had a lot of great pizza in my life, it happens to be my favorite thing to eat. The ingredients at Lucali were all excellent, tasty sauce, high quality fresh mozzarella, but there was something lacking in the overall effect of the pie. If it was a glass of red wine, I would say that it felt thin on the palette. The crust was of ideal thickness, but it didn't have the yeasty taste of interest that a truly fine Neopolitan pie has. The flavor of the bread was rather pedestrian. And for that price, I expect more. Needless to say, I won't be running back here to stand in line anytime soon - there are better and more affordable pizza experiences to be had in BK and Manhattan.",3.0
"I'm from California and I've been eating west coast pizza all my life. It's okay but I don't order it unless friends want it or I'm in a rush to grab a quick meal.If Lucali in Brooklyn was in CA, I'd probably have pizza 4-5 times a week. It was so good! Unfortunately, I'm back home and won't have good pizza again until my next trip to the east coast.Another great thing was that I showed up during the ""snow storm of the century"" and was told this place usually has an hour wait but it was virtually empty when I went with friends.",5.0
"In my opinion Di Fara still reigns supreme in the world of Brooklyn/Manhattan pizza joints. If I had to pick a place that came in second, I would pick Lucali. The pizza is great and the service is fantastic. There were 6 of us tonight and we paid $24 per pizza with no toppings after we added toppings our grand total came to $70. That means that we spent $22 on toppings alone. In my opinion that is ridiculous. We had 4 toppings which included red peppers, shallots, artichoke hearts, and mushrooms. All of which are not worth $22 on a pizza. It was good but $70 for two pizzas is a bit absurd.The pizza itself was pretty awesome. The crust was perfectly crispy and the freshness of the mozzarella really came out in the flavor of the pizza. It's not too saucy and those bites that include a slightly charred crust are what it's all about.Di Fara is still my favorite but Lucali is the best runner-up that I could think of in this city where pizza is one of those foods that shaped the city.The BYOB over candlelight is definitely a nice touch too.",4.0
My husband and I love coming here.  We come here at least once a week.  You gotta come around 6pm to get a table.  The pizza is really the best I've ever had...so yummy and so fresh!  Great place for a romantic date ;),5.0
"I have to give this place five stars ... even though:1. The location's a fucking drag2. The wait was an hour plus (Friday night without a reservation).I think we closed the place. The pizza was not my favorite of all time, not even in New York, but it was definitely like... the most authentic, I guess. It was really, really good though. The crust is really thin and they have a ton of fresh vegetables as toppings, was pretty solid.

We ordered two pies- one with basil, another with shallots (stupid me- why didn't we just do one pie with two toppings? Is that even allowed?). Both were fantastic, of course.Ambience- nice and cozy. Great seeing the open kitchen and the folks at work. Pizza- delicious. Hype- a bit much. While I'm really glad I went, I honestly don't know if I would make a habit out of this.

"I'd give this place 4.5 starsOf all the foodie quests out there in NYC, it seems pizza is the most debated / disputed.  Lucali currently has the title of pound-for-pound top pizza and this was my first visit.  I'm only going to rate the food and service of this place as I don't really care about ambience, location, or even the wait/reservation system.  We're here for the food.  The pizza is legitimately awesome.  A great pizza crust needs to be light, fluffy and have some taste to it.  Lucali's follows this formula.  Looking at the underbelly of a slice from Lucali's reveals nice toasty burn marks which is always a good sign of an oven.  The crust was a little bland in my opinion but still pretty damn good.  The sauce, cheese, and toppings (from the vegatables to the basil) are all fresh and of great quality.  The service is pretty good and the pizza makers and staff seem to care a great deal about the food and service being as high as possible which is not always the case at other places.  The calzone is money and the ricotta cheese is a good change of ""taste"" from the mozzarella of the pizzas.  I know i said was going to stick to just the food in this review but i thought i should mention this place is BYOB which is a huge plus in my book.Back to the food - The pizza is damn good -no doubt.  Not sure I'd say the best i've ever had but its damn good and would return again.",4.0
"It is good but not that good; not worth the trip from the city if that is your question. I have eaten at all the great pizza places in the city as well as in Italy and I can tell you this place has taken a decent pizza recipe, added a wood-fired oven into a old-world decored space and then tucked it all into a somewhat charming block of brooklyn to yield a good experience, but not a great experience.The service is good, the atmosphere is very good (think back-alley pizza joint in naples that has been around before electricity/uses candle light and marble top tables to prepare the pizza), the pies are good, and the cost is just fine.If you are in the neighborhood, it is worth the trip but not worthy of the line people wait in for hours to have a bit of the pie.",3.0
"My experience here was quite lovely.  My beautiful date and I arrived 30 minutes early, anticitpating a long wait.  To our surprise, we were the 2nd couple there and were promptly seated just after opening.Our waitress was attentive, and opened our bottle immediately.  Our pizza was brought to our table surprisingly fast.  It was delicious.Due to there being three in our party, the bill was surprisingly cheap.  Somehow, we weren't charged the corkage fee which was very nice.  Only $4 off but still welcomed.Thank you, Lucali.  I consider myself a fan.",4.0
"A couple of pals live around the corner from this place and we trekked over last night in the freezing february cold with a couple bottles of abruzzo (YAY for byob). My tip for you, go when it's really cold! Negligible wait time and what a wonderful place to be inside eating incredible pizza pie on a cold night. Don't sit near the door if you can help it because there's a fair amount of coming and going, but sit there if you've gotta, it's worth a little chill now and again. And yeah, the pizza is fantastic. One of the best of its kind I've had. Toppings are awesome. Perfect stuff. Enough said.",5.0
"After a previous (but thwarted) attempt to stuff our faces here, we followed the advice of our fellow yelpers and did the ""call ahead"" thing, which worked like a charm. If you live in the neighborhood, I highly recommend it- I was able to enjoy my wait on the couch in my apartment, rather than on a hard bench in 100 degree weather.Lucali's obviously has a lot going for it- the fervent, cult-like following is definitely an indication. The pizza is solid, of course- the two of us had no problem putting away a whole pie. I even liked the fact that it wasn't air-conditioned- it felt like being in someone's kitchen.Be prepared, however, to drop some serious cash for a pretty basic pizza. If you get any toppings, you're going to be paying nearly $30, which I wouldn't necessarily mind if I felt the product was really something special. Of course, the pizza was delicious and fresh and crusty blah blah blah- everything you would hope and expect from a place like this, but it wasn't transcendent. It was just good. Also, the service we experienced was a bit spotty. We were seated and our server touched base, asked if we wanted any drinks, etc. and gave us a minute to discuss our order. Then she went on break. When there are only two things on the menu, it really doesn't take more than a minute to discuss what you are going to get, so we tried to get the attention of the other server, but to no avail. We were left waiting for at least 15, 20 minutes before our server returned. It was obvious that she felt bad, so she comp-ed us each a can of soda for the wait. By that point, I was so hungry that I downed the Pepsi in about 10 seconds and spent the rest of the wait for my pizza gnawing on the aluminum. When the pizza did come (we got a pie with basil, garlic, and red peppers), my ravenous self did that thing where you try to get as much of a slice into your mouth as possible and end up smearing your face with boiling hot cheese lava. Of course, none of this was really Lucali's fault, as I probably would have done that without the extra 20 minute delay as well.",3.0

It really is a romantic atmosphere. Cons: Long waits! It's ridiculous. We don't even bother to try and go after 6:30 or so. Also--some of the tables are VERY cramped uncomfortable. Finally, it's BYOB--but it would be nice to have some other options besides canned soda. Some sparkling water, or iced tea, or SOMETHING. Otherwise, great place--glad it's in my neighborhood.",4.0
"I brought a date here, because previous reviews on Yelp and elsewhere indicated that it was very romantic. That was pretty true--the candlelight dining does create a certain atmosphere, and it's clearly very important to the people at Lucali--when our candle blew out a busboy rushed over immediately to relight it. The service on the whole was excellent.The wait could be a problem, as could the BYOB, but if you anticipate it it actually works nicely. Stop by, put your name on the list, and while you're waiting stroll the beautiful neighborhood and find a liquor store to buy a bottle.My big complaint was the lack of toppings. The list changes every night, and the night I went the options consisted of mushrooms, basil, and maybe a couple other vegetables. I love toppings and I like to have a variety to choose from, so ending up with a basil pizza was disappointing, the good thin crust notwithstanding. And despite my best efforts, the night didn't end in romance. I have no choice but to blame Lucali's lack of toppings rather than my own bumbling.If you like cheese pizza and have better skills than I, I recommend it.",3.0
"Dropped by last night for the first time (just moved to the neighborhood). 7:30pm with two people, surprisingly didn't have to wait at all. Brought a good red wine and ate the 4 dollar corking fee. Shared a large pie with my girlfriend - toppings: mushrooms (porcini?), pepperoni, onions, garlic... not too long a wait for the food, and the waitress was super nice. Great ambiance - dark and open. Enjoyed looking around, watching the oven. Nice to see the fresh ingredients displayed in the pizza-making areaCouldn't ask for better pizza. Crust was just chewy enough, on the thin side, with plenty of crispy bubbles. Sauce was amazing - just the right amount. Tasty cheese, and the toppings were all great. Pepperoni was amazing - cooked enough to curl the edges. Can't wait to try the calzone.",5.0
"Lucali in my neighborhood is a gift straight from heaven.Seriously, the pizza is on par with the best in the city.  I'd travel for it and instead, I can just walk down Henry St a few blocks.  The BYOB policy is classic and the ambiance is romantic and quaint.  It's a great date place, but equally nice with family or friends.The pizza, of course, is from the old world.  Very thin crust, and handmade with plenty of love.  Every time I've been, the same Italian guy (who I believe is the owner) is working the oven and this gives Lucali the same feel as it's breathren, DiFara.",5.0

It was thin brick oven crust fresh veggies from the yard. Then ordered a calzone it was even better. Will be going back again.",5.0
"I'd give this place 4.5 starsOf all the foodie quests out there in NYC, it seems pizza is the most debated / disputed.  Lucali currently has the title of pound-for-pound top pizza and this was my first visit.  I'm only going to rate the food and service of this place as I don't really care about ambience, location, or even the wait/reservation system.  We're here for the food.  The pizza is legitimately awesome.  A great pizza crust needs to be light, fluffy and have some taste to it.  Lucali's follows this formula.  Looking at the underbelly of a slice from Lucali's reveals nice toasty burn marks which is always a good sign of an oven.  The crust was a little bland in my opinion but still pretty damn good.  The sauce, cheese, and toppings (from the vegatables to the basil) are all fresh and of great quality.  The service is pretty good and the pizza makers and staff seem to care a great deal about the food and service being as high as possible which is not always the case at other places.  The calzone is money and the ricotta cheese is a good change of ""taste"" from the mozzarella of the pizzas.  I know i said was going to stick to just the food in this review but i thought i should mention this place is BYOB which is a huge plus in my book.Back to the food - The pizza is damn good -no doubt.  Not sure I'd say the best i've ever had but its damn good and would return again.",4.0
"It is good but not that good; not worth the trip from the city if that is your question. I have eaten at all the great pizza places in the city as well as in Italy and I can tell you this place has taken a decent pizza recipe, added a wood-fired oven into a old-world decored space and then tucked it all into a somewhat charming block of brooklyn to yield a good experience, but not a great experience.The service is good, the atmosphere is very good (think back-alley pizza joint in naples that has been around before electricity/uses candle light and marble top tables to prepare the pizza), the pies are good, and the cost is just fine.If you are in the neighborhood, it is worth the trip but not worthy of the line people wait in for hours to have a bit of the pie.",3.0
"My experience here was quite lovely.  My beautiful date and I arrived 30 minutes early, anticitpating a long wait.  To our surprise, we were the 2nd couple there and were promptly seated just after opening.Our waitress was attentive, and opened our bottle immediately.  Our pizza was brought to our table surprisingly fast.  It was delicious.Due to there being three in our party, the bill was surprisingly cheap.  Somehow, we weren't charged the corkage fee which was very nice.  Only $4 off but still welcomed.Thank you, Lucali.  I consider myself a fan.",4.0
"A couple of pals live around the corner from this place and we trekked over last night in the freezing february cold with a couple bottles of abruzzo (YAY for byob). My tip for you, go when it's really cold! Negligible wait time and what a wonderful place to be inside eating incredible pizza pie on a cold night. Don't sit near the door if you can help it because there's a fair amount of coming and going, but sit there if you've gotta, it's worth a little chill now and again. And yeah, the pizza is fantastic. One of the best of its kind I've had. Toppings are awesome. Perfect stuff. Enough said.",5.0
"After a previous (but thwarted) attempt to stuff our faces here, we followed the advice of our fellow yelpers and did the ""call ahead"" thing, which worked like a charm. If you live in the neighborhood, I highly recommend it- I was able to enjoy my wait on the couch in my apartment, rather than on a hard bench in 100 degree weather.Lucali's obviously has a lot going for it- the fervent, cult-like following is definitely an indication. The pizza is solid, of course- the two of us had no problem putting away a whole pie. I even liked the fact that it wasn't air-conditioned- it felt like being in someone's kitchen.Be prepared, however, to drop some serious cash for a pretty basic pizza. If you get any toppings, you're going to be paying nearly $30, which I wouldn't necessarily mind if I felt the product was really something special. Of course, the pizza was delicious and fresh and crusty blah blah blah- everything you would hope and expect from a place like this, but it wasn't transcendent. It was just good. Also, the service we experienced was a bit spotty. We were seated and our server touched base, asked if we wanted any drinks, etc. and gave us a minute to discuss our order. Then she went on break. When there are only two things on the menu, it really doesn't take more than a minute to discuss what you are going to get, so we tried to get the attention of the other server, but to no avail. We were left waiting for at least 15, 20 minutes before our server returned. It was obvious that she felt bad, so she comp-ed us each a can of soda for the wait. By that point, I was so hungry that I downed the Pepsi in about 10 seconds and spent the rest of the wait for my pizza gnawing on the aluminum. When the pizza did come (we got a pie with basil, garlic, and red peppers), my ravenous self did that thing where you try to get as much of a slice into your mouth as possible and end up smearing your face with boiling hot cheese lava. Of course, none of this was really Lucali's fault, as I probably would have done that without the extra 20 minute delay as well.",3.0

"We've found out about Lucali last year around November... Since then we bring all our friends to the place... All loved it. I live in the neighborhood for almost 5 years and we have very fine Italian restaurants, cafes here... However, Lucali is simply the best! Here is why...- If you are not in the mood to wait 1-2 hours at the door, don't go there.You'll definitely wait, it's a small place with only one (great) cook.  What do you expect, really!?  (Though it's on your table in about 4-5 minutes after your order is taken. People just sit there and drink their wine. What can the owner do, kick them out?! Patrons should be more thoughtful and get out in a reasonable time).- If you don't like small tables, cozy restaurants don't go there.It's a place as if it is little cafe in an Italian town - say Naples.- If you are not a big fan of romantic places, don't go there.As good as it gets; warm, lovely.- If you want to bring your child when dining out, don't go there.Well, they have a child chair etc. But come on, you must got it so far. It's not a McDonald's with a playground.- If you don't care about the taste of pizza, don't go there.Seriously, you'd never feel the cheese in your mouth. It just melts away with a great after taste.-If you don't like being treated nicely by the waitresses, don't go there.I was sick of waitresses that treats you like sh*t. Oh, at Lucali they are very nice. Friendly waitress in NY, just unbelievable, huh?- If you don't like to be in a neighborhood that is not on your way, don't go there.

It's not on your way; it's hidden; the place doesn't even have its name written outside or inside.But,If you love good quality, crusty, but at the same time juicy brick oven pizza; if you like simple yet beautiful places then you've found your haven.My suggestion: Definitely order a pizza with garlic, onion, basil, bell peppers, black olives. You'll eat your fingers!By the way - You can always call and make a reservation. But since customers decide when to leave, Lucali cannot give you an exact time; instead they call you aprox. 5-15 minutes before you're table might be ready.

This is without question the BEST pizza I have ever had.  It is also the only pizza I have been able to eat in the past 8 years that did not give me acid reflux.  That's because they went through many kinds of tomatoes before settling on the one they currently use.  They also do not add sugar to the sauce for which my stomach is very grateful.The crust is on the thin side and when I am very hungry I can eat an entire pie myself.  The pies are at their best later in the night when the oven is at its hottest.  They tend be a little chewier (rather than crisp) which I find preferable.  The calzones are terrific but best shared as they are very filling.   Lucali's really is a neighbourhood joint that became the hot place to eat pizza because of word of web and reviews.   This is why the waits can be long but what's a bit of waiting when you are among friends.Treat yourself to Lucali's.  It is well worth the wait!,5.0

"My boyfriend states that I frequently shoot him down when he suggests pizza for dinner, so to make it up to him and my ever shrinking wallet (lol), we decide to have a romantic pizza dinner on Saturday night. We read all the reviews on Yelp and were quite convinced that this could be the best pizza place outside of Italy. Although I have never had pizza in Italy, I would have to say this is the best pizza I have had in the world so far. I have had pizza in Japan, and well, seaweed and corn on pizza is just weird. LOL. We arrive at 7:40 and we are told that the wait is 1 hour. We happily agree to wait and waltz over to a dive bar down the street (review to come). At about 8:30, they call us to let us know that a table is ready for us. By now, we have both developed a good appetite, and we were ready to slaughter a pizza! The menu has 2 items: a large pie and calzone. We opted for a large 8 slice pie ($24) topped with basil ($2) and anchovies ($2).  About 10-15 minutes later, a beautiful pie shows up at our table. It smells amazing! Someone should bottle the aroma and name it, ""Eau de Pizza."" LOL. The pie has a generous basil portion, with dots of anchovies throughout. The pizza tasted wonderful. Simple, cooked just right, with just the right amount of cheese, sauce, basil and anchovies. We managed to eat the whole pie, I had 3 slices. I liked that the pizza are made right before your eyes. The place has a nice rustic feel to it, dimly lit, with beautiful old classics playing softly in the background. I also like the old candy sign posted on the wall, which alludes to its history. I was told by my ever knowledgeable boyfriend that the place used to be a candy store and it closed. The owner bought the place and didn't want to see the candy store become a McWhatever. That made me like the place even more. I really enjoyed having pizza here, and recommend it to anyone in the mood for some GOOD, AUTHENTIC pizza. This is a great date spot, so if you find yourself in need of pleasing another, this place will bedazzle your date.

"The vibe here is casual and no frills, just like its menu - pizza and calzones + list of toppings, soda, water, BYOB.  While it is not the earthshattering slice that at this pt is beyond over-hyped, the woodfired pie is wonderfully thin, blistery, and smokey, with a good ratio of sauce::cheese::toppings.  It is wonderful to see the pizza being stretched and baked in the open ""kitchen.""  And the room has an old-timey feel that is authentically Carroll Gardens.The hype is what is driving everyone here and causing the long waits!  So, if you really want to try a pie, get here (1) on a wkday (2) by 6:30 PM and (3) in a group no larger than a 4 top.   At that time, the rush hasn't started and the pies arrive in short order since the kitchen is not backed up.",4.0
"First of all, I really don't know what the hype is all about.  We live about 2 blocks from this place and last night was the first time we've eaten there.  They have two things on the menu: calzone's and pizza.  And they were out of calzones!  Not sure what the reason is but I can't image it's enough to really change my review.  The service is so-so, the corkage fee was only $5 and the pizza was better-than-average.  Amazing? No. The best pizza in Brooklyn? No. The best pizza on Henry Street? No. Sorry, we'd rather get the fresh mozz and marinara down the street at Francesco's.",3.0
"I went on a Wednesday night with one other person, walked from Brooklyn Heights.  When we got there we were seated RIGHT away, the scene was great, music, people and service.  The staff is extremely friendly-- we brought 2 bottles of wine and b/c it was our first time there, she waived the corking fee, which is minimal, but still a really nice gesture.  I was there with someone I didn't know well, so I didn't have the chance to focus so much on the amazing pizza and calzone (with sauce), but I loved everything and so did my guest, best pizza around.  Also, it's nice to look at Mark Iacono while dining ; )",5.0
"Pizza is really good, crust was a somewhat burned, but not a huge deal. Its BYOB, which is fine, but just be prepared.

Overall good experience but would not go out of my way to go again.",4.0
I've never had to wait to get a table here.The staff are always super friendly and really accommodating. The pizza is absolutely delicious and I can't fault it.,5.0
This is without question the BEST pizza I have ever had.  It is also the only pizza I have been able to eat in the past 8 years that did not give me acid reflux.  That's because they went through many kinds of tomatoes before settling on the one they currently use.  They also do not add sugar to the sauce for which my stomach is very grateful.The crust is on the thin side and when I am very hungry I can eat an entire pie myself.  The pies are at their best later in the night when the oven is at its hottest.  They tend be a little chewier (rather than crisp) which I find preferable.  The calzones are terrific but best shared as they are very filling.   Lucali's really is a neighbourhood joint that became the hot place to eat pizza because of word of web and reviews.   This is why the waits can be long but what's a bit of waiting when you are among friends.Treat yourself to Lucali's.  It is well worth the wait!,5.0

"My boyfriend states that I frequently shoot him down when he suggests pizza for dinner, so to make it up to him and my ever shrinking wallet (lol), we decide to have a romantic pizza dinner on Saturday night. We read all the reviews on Yelp and were quite convinced that this could be the best pizza place outside of Italy. Although I have never had pizza in Italy, I would have to say this is the best pizza I have had in the world so far. I have had pizza in Japan, and well, seaweed and corn on pizza is just weird. LOL. We arrive at 7:40 and we are told that the wait is 1 hour. We happily agree to wait and waltz over to a dive bar down the street (review to come). At about 8:30, they call us to let us know that a table is ready for us. By now, we have both developed a good appetite, and we were ready to slaughter a pizza! The menu has 2 items: a large pie and calzone. We opted for a large 8 slice pie ($24) topped with basil ($2) and anchovies ($2).  About 10-15 minutes later, a beautiful pie shows up at our table. It smells amazing! Someone should bottle the aroma and name it, ""Eau de Pizza."" LOL. The pie has a generous basil portion, with dots of anchovies throughout. The pizza tasted wonderful. Simple, cooked just right, with just the right amount of cheese, sauce, basil and anchovies. We managed to eat the whole pie, I had 3 slices. I liked that the pizza are made right before your eyes. The place has a nice rustic feel to it, dimly lit, with beautiful old classics playing softly in the background. I also like the old candy sign posted on the wall, which alludes to its history. I was told by my ever knowledgeable boyfriend that the place used to be a candy store and it closed. The owner bought the place and didn't want to see the candy store become a McWhatever. That made me like the place even more. I really enjoyed having pizza here, and recommend it to anyone in the mood for some GOOD, AUTHENTIC pizza. This is a great date spot, so if you find yourself in need of pleasing another, this place will bedazzle your date. Would have liked some dessert, but then again, that probably would have ruined the authenticity. It is BYOB.",5.0

"My husband and I completed a pizza tour of Brooklyn a couple of summers ago and we agreed that Lucali is HANDS DOWN the best pizza in New York.  There is something absolutely perfect about the sauce (so full of flavor), the cheese, the fresh basil, the peperoni.  It is such a small restaurant and can be a little frustrating to get into especially on a weekend, but it is well worth the wait.  It's also BYOB so you can bring in a couple of beers or a nice bottle of wine.  There is no artificial light, just a little bit of candlelight so it's actually a little bit romantic (for a pizza place!) if there aren't any large families or boisterous large parties there.  I have recently moved to CA and will miss eating here tremendously.  If you want a little something different, order the Calzone with a side of sauce.",5.0
"Worth the wait! This place is always busy but you should definitely hang out for the pizza as it's a-mAzing. If you end up waiting a bit, check out Brooklyn Pharmacy around the corner as this place is another cool little hangout.

"Clearly a great pizza and an equally great experience.

I can see the artists' hands creating your circle.  They are masseuses for taste buds in waiting. The payoff comes first to my smell, soon after my taste. It is obvious the love they put into their food. Very likely reinforced by the closeness of the entire experience; diners and cooks sharing the 50x25 space. I love the transparency and the togetherness this creates. In creating a metaphor relative to a pizza pie, it's not a circle that goes from restaurateur to patron and back around, it's the insides, the centers of a Lucali pie; we are a mix of ingredients together in the same space, overlapping, emphasizing each other's uniqueness; creators, consumers, purveyors, all coexisting in a warm slop of sensual goodness.",5.0

"Not that Lucali's really needs another review, but our experience was as great as we hoped for. Our waitress was great and helpful since we were indecisive.

"Pizza is a very simple dish, made of simpliest ingridients and yet so different. The secret in very small details that you may not notice, and that's the magic of it.

The best pizza in the US! Without a doubt. Lombardi's and DiFara's are close but do not equal this unrivaled splendor. The only complaint I have is the wait time. But you will find that the pizza is worth the wait.,5.0
"So this place will piss some people off and make others drool.  These type of places always do.  Its good food.  Real good.  But the crowds, popularity and oh god, the wait, is really too much.  I'm lucky I live a block away so I can put my name down in person (they dont do reservations) and go home for the 60-90 minutes normal wait time.  The sorry people who drive to the spot, in their hummers and maybachs, have to wait outside often standing up the whole time.The pizza is just fantastic and the calzones gigantic - and that pretty much all they sell.  It's BYOB but the'll serve water or soda if I remember.So here is the synopsis.  LOTS of people, great gourmet oven baked pizza (with the tasty burned spots too), but a long fuckin wait.",4.0
Heart.  Delicious candlelit pizza dinner.  I turn green with envy thinking of the people who live on that same block.,5.0
"Got pie with artichoke on half; tomato sauce, mozzarella, and basil included. Split with gf; we were both stuffed. Thin fluffy crust. Sauce was silky and fragrant. Cheese was flavorful and thickness was good. Fresh basil was crisp; ask for more next time. $28+tip.Rustic homey atmosphere. Nice casual crowd. Friendly service. Bring wine or beer; the restaurant doesn't carry any.Calzone is five cheese and toppings are extra; waitress suggested hot peppers. $10 for the small is good for one person.Line-up starts around 5:45pm. Book a table and show up by 5:50pm.[30 mins. from W 4th St. on the F train.]",4.0
"Lucali defines date spot in Brooklyn.  The open kitchen was so welcoming, and the close-knit dining was in between communal, while still privately romantic.  The swiftly, yet gratifyingly prepared thinly crusted, open oven flavored pizza really did meet up to its expectations.  Each bite was savory, encompassing a zesty pepperoni, buttery like cheese, juicy mushrooms, and fresh basil!  And topping the toppings with BYOB as well ----perfect, perfect, perfect!  It's cash only, but so worth chasin' that paper.",5.0
This is worthy of the hype.,5.0
"Yup, that's pizza, alright.  Made lovingly right there, 15 feet away, in a darling little wood-burning oven with dim lighting and cozy & timeworn decor (faux, but no matter).  Did I like it?  Yes indeed, but I like Patsy Grimaldi's, John's, Totonno's, slices from Joe's on Carmine, etc. etc., too, all for slightly different reasons.  Was it worth freezing my ass off outside for an extra half hour while that four top dawdled over their wine dregs and gnawed crusts after paying their check?  No.  It's pizza - fancypants minimalist artisinal pizza, mind you - and thus all highly subjective like art and beauty and stuff.  So if you're into rhapsodic babbling about ""the perfect mix of crispy and chewy"" and the ""acid/sweet tang of fresh plum tomatoes"" and blah-dee blah blah, and you think an integral part of the Great Pizza Experience is suffering for it beforehand, then by all means, stand there on the sidewalk like a dunce and have at it.",3.0

"It is with a mix of sadness and reluctance that I type this review, knowing that I am in the minority and that my review will probably be dismissed by the legions of Lucali devotees. After all, this is the mythical restaurant that has seduced New Yorkers with its ""perfect pizza"". I went last night with my cousins and a Sicilian friend. We are all very familiar with Italian food, have lived in Italy and have mixed feelings about the growing pizza fetishization that has swept New York. Pizza is a wonderful thing, the equivalent of crepes in France or Burritos in Mexico. It is not fine cuisine. It was never meant to be. It is ""happy food""- food meant to be consumed with friends and family, around a table, with beers, laughter and smiles. Which is where my first, massive criticism of Lucali emerges. The people working there, including Mark, look like they've been sodomized by a ten foot long rolling pin. They, quite simply, look unhappy. Not a smile on their face. Nothing. Zero. They are conducting a military operation, efficient, yes. But void of warmth, emotion or enthusiasm. A low point was reached when the ""Godfather"" theme song kicked in. Really?! You strive for pizza authenticity but then you wallow in the biggest cliche of them all? Having the pizzaiolo in full view of everyone is a good idea- but not if the pizzaiolo has a permanent scowl on his face. Compare him to Roberto Caporuscio from ""Keste'"" (which I consider the best neapolitan pizza in New York). Or even Dom at Di Fara, with his wide-eyed, painstaking attention to detail. None of that is present at Lucali.An hour and a half wait is ludicrous but thankfully my cousins live 5 minutes away so we had somewhere to go. The girl at the door didn't even call me on the phone- we had to march down to the restaurant to make sure they hadn't forgotten about us. The tables are the best thing about the restaurant, together with the high ceilings and pretty lighting. But I digress. Back to the service. A small army of skinny hipster Brooklyn- Italian girls await. One chews gum like a horse the whole time. The other (especially skinny) girl takes after Mark and has a perpetual scowl on her face. The hostess, also, has a look of disdain for everybody in the room. It's as though it is your PRIVILEGE to eat there- not their right, or pleasure, to serve you. This is an inherently catastrophic attitude for a restaurant, and resulted in an unsatisfying experience. The kicker came when I asked for a double espresso- something that EVERY ITALIAN RESTAURANT should be able to do- and I was told by the waitress that they were unable to make me one. Why? ""Because the AC is on."" Apparently you either stay cool, or you get a coffee. But to ask for both is a ridiculous request at Lucali, and one that is met with scorn. Let me say that the ONE smiling waitress, a wonderful African-American girl, had only been there one day. I sincerely hope Lucali does not affect her spirit and her graciousness. What about the food? Totally acceptable pizza. Good, but not great. I repeat: not great. The crust crumbled at the edges, as it was mostly overdone. The sauce was fresh, as was the mozzarella, but really, is that an impressive feat for a pizzeria that charges $24 a pie? If I wanted cardboard cheese and ketchup on my pizza I'd go to Domino's. It shouldn't be such a big deal that a pizzeria uses fresh ingredients. The calzone, which many yelpers claim is up there with the Sistine Chapel and the Pyramids- a miracle of human imagination and inventiveness- is mediocre at best. Put the sauce INSIDE the goddamn calzone! What is this, cheesy bread from Pizza Hut that you gotta dip in the marinara sauce?! And ooohhhh fresh Ricotta. Gimme a break. Slapping a gob of fresh ricotta on some dough and sticking it in the oven hardly constitutes artistry. The calzone at Sezz' Medi' uptown is much better, for example.I am so disappointed. I wish I could bitch-slap Mark with one of his fresh buffalo mozzarellas. He needs to get off his high horse and understand that pizza is a sunny gift, not a culinary egotrip. It's food for the people. It should be fast, effortless and selfless. And I almost forgot: the skinny waitress kept circling our table like a rabid vulture, constantly asking if we wanted anything else or if she could take our plates away. This was immediately after we had finished our food. Only in New York.Go to Keste'. Go to Di Fara and enjoy Dom's show and childlike enthusiasm.

"I was there last night.  My friends and I waited outside in the cold for an hour and a half.  At some point the slightly vague hostess gave our table to a larger party- though I believe our group was first.  Finally we were seated and the five of us crowded around a small table.  Near the end of our meal we were interrupted by an angry little man who demanded that we finish up quickly so that he and his friends could take our table.  As we exited the restaurant, he began to clap loudly and said, ""Well done!  Very good!  I'm glad you took your time!""  His friends [adult males, not children as you might have assumed] chimed in with, ""Unbelievable!"" and ""So selfish!""  all while casting narrowed-eyed, sidelong glances our way.   Yes this actually happened and it was so ridiculous that I did not know quite how to respond.Despite all this I give Lucali 5 stars!  The pizza is THAT GOOD.  Proper thin crust pizza with simple, fresh toppings.  The atmosphere is warm and cozy, service is friendly, and once you place the order, the piping hot pizzas arrive promptly.  Keep in mind, there is always a wait.  But if you do wait just like everyone else, without making a scene, you will be rewarded with what may be the most delicious pizza you've had in New York.  Or possibly in your entire life.",5.0

I like the fact that you can bring your own wine. We even had the honor of dining with Beyonce and Jay-Z, who sat a few tables over. The reason I don't give Lucali 5 stars was because the waitress actually told us to leave, as she had people waiting outside. We had JUST finished our pizzas and still had wine left to enjoy. Well guess what - tough luck that people have to wait, we waited more than 1 hr too...that was such a disappointing ending to an amazing food experience. Serious attitude problem.",4.0
"eating pizza like this makes me depressed!    i may have said it before in  a review of somewhere else, but pizza is really quite a simple thing, and the right ingredients, the right equipment, and a little love, and you'll get it right.        sadly so many places in new york don't really serve proper pizza.   lucali, of course, is a different story.    lucali's pizza is quite superb.     this is a simple pizza restaurant, two things on the menu - pizza and calzone, both tomato and cheese to start out with.       you can get a few different toppings, which vary night by night, and are mostly in the new york pizza topping tradition, but handled with proper care.      tonight i got a pizza (only large is served, and it is pretty big), with a 50/50 topping of pepperoni and hot peppers.      the pepperoni was very good, and the peppers were sliced nice and thin, and there weren't too many of them.    also, in addition to the regular cheese, the pizzas coming out are topped with freshly shaved parmesan and handfuls of basil leaves.the crust was perfectly thin, with a good amount of blisters and char.    the tomato sauce was flavorful - sweet, tangy, and well seasoned.   there was just the right amount of cheese.  what you're getting is an old-world style pizza, with a new york sensibility, but with a thoughtful and refined approach - or, as refined as you want pizza to be (not very!).  perfect!the ambience in the place is lovely - faux-stained yellow walls,, and tin ceilings, and lots of candles.  dean martin, etc., on the radio.  old neighbourhood signs (and some, i am assuming, from the former soda fountain which was at the location when i lived in the 'hood ten years ago).  i like the very open style kitchen too, with its low work-tops.   really nice service tonight when i visited, and cool to have a place like this that is BOYB, so i had a nice splash of wine with my pizza.i'm giving 5 stars, though maybe half off for not having a smaller pie option.   i think for  solo diner, early in the evening, or take-out, that a smaller pie will be much more manageable.   just a thought.consider me a big fan of lucali!",5.0
"The only sauce that I can recall having a lasting aftertaste. Several hours aftertaste.  I like the neopolitan style with the larger, more traditional size slices. The crust was airy, crisp, and flavorful enough. I did find myself dashing salt while eating the crust, but the food combined with the subtle and rustic ambiance accompanied by the welcoming warmth of the brick oven which steals the show at center stage, I fell in live with the place. Oh yea, and it's byob.",4.0
"OMG, I LOVE this pizza!  I could eat here every day.  It's not the prettiest place but the guys making the pizzas in their white t-shirts do kinda distract the eye!  The pizza itself is amazing, really thin crust with the perfect amount of cheese and the sauce is SO good!  I like how they tell you which toppings are available when you sit, it seems more ""homey"" like that, less like a pizza sweat shop.  The calzones are delicious too, that ricotta cheese, YUM!Yes there is always a 2 hour wait and the phone is *always* busy but the front staff is very accommodating with that, you can go to another place to have a drink while you wait and they will call your cell phone when the people at your table are ready for their check to give you time to get back there.  Ok, so yes it would be much more convenient if there was a bar/waiting area there but I'm sorry, the pizza is so good, its worth it!  As the old saying goes ""anything worth having is worth waiting for"".",5.0
"The calzones were so good here. One time, during a lunch-meeting at work, I brought in one of their calzones for my lunch, and my boss - we'll call him Mr. S - was absolutely mesmerized by the fragrance of my lunch. From that day on, my lunch-time duties was to go to Lucali's and get a calzone for him every day. I went from errand-boy to lunchtime pal, as we typically enjoyed our fare at his desk.Also, the pizza is do damn rustic. Effin' awesome.",5.0
"It is with a mix of sadness and reluctance that I type this review, knowing that I am in the minority and that my review will probably be dismissed by the legions of Lucali devotees. After all, this is the mythical restaurant that has seduced New Yorkers with its ""perfect pizza"". I went last night with my cousins and a Sicilian friend. We are all very familiar with Italian food, have lived in Italy and have mixed feelings about the growing pizza fetishization that has swept New York. Pizza is a wonderful thing, the equivalent of crepes in France or Burritos in Mexico. It is not fine cuisine. It was never meant to be. It is ""happy food""- food meant to be consumed with friends and family, around a table, with beers, laughter and smiles. Which is where my first, massive criticism of Lucali emerges. The people working there, including Mark, look like they've been sodomized by a ten foot long rolling pin. They, quite simply, look unhappy. Not a smile on their face. Nothing. Zero. They are conducting a military operation, efficient, yes. But void of warmth, emotion or enthusiasm. A low point was reached when the ""Godfather"" theme song kicked in. Really?! You strive for pizza authenticity but then you wallow in the biggest cliche of them all? Having the pizzaiolo in full view of everyone is a good idea- but not if the pizzaiolo has a permanent scowl on his face. Compare him to Roberto Caporuscio from ""Keste'"" (which I consider the best neapolitan pizza in New York). Or even Dom at Di Fara, with his wide-eyed, painstaking attention to detail. None of that is present at Lucali.An hour and a half wait is ludicrous but thankfully my cousins live 5 minutes away so we had somewhere to go. The girl at the door didn't even call me on the phone- we had to march down to the restaurant to make sure they hadn't forgotten about us. The tables are the best thing about the restaurant, together with the high ceilings and pretty lighting. But I digress. Back to the service. A small army of skinny hipster Brooklyn- Italian girls await. One chews gum like a horse the whole time. The other (especially skinny) girl takes after Mark and has a perpetual scowl on her face. The hostess, also, has a look of disdain for everybody in the room. It's as though it is your PRIVILEGE to eat there- not their right, or pleasure, to serve you. This is an inherently catastrophic attitude for a restaurant, and resulted in an unsatisfying experience. The kicker came when I asked for a double espresso- something that EVERY ITALIAN RESTAURANT should be able to do- and I was told by the waitress that they were unable to make me one. Why? ""Because the AC is on."" Apparently you either stay cool, or you get a coffee. But to ask for both is a ridiculous request at Lucali, and one that is met with scorn. Let me say that the ONE smiling waitress, a wonderful African-American girl, had only been there one day. I sincerely hope Lucali does not affect her spirit and her graciousness. What about the food? Totally acceptable pizza. Good, but not great. I repeat: not great. The crust crumbled at the edges, as it was mostly overdone. The sauce was fresh, as was the mozzarella, but really, is that an impressive feat for a pizzeria that charges $24 a pie? If I wanted cardboard cheese and ketchup on my pizza I'd go to Domino's. It shouldn't be such a big deal that a pizzeria uses fresh ingredients. The calzone, which many yelpers claim is up there with the Sistine Chapel and the Pyramids- a miracle of human imagination and inventiveness- is mediocre at best. Put the sauce INSIDE the goddamn calzone! What is this, cheesy bread from Pizza Hut that you gotta dip in the marinara sauce?! And ooohhhh fresh Ricotta. Gimme a break.

At Lucali, it will set you back $30 and the pie is light enough that an adult man can easily finish a whole one.I'm willing to pay a bit more for top quality, but it's crazy to pay double, particularly give that there are a lot of places in this city that use top quality ingredients on their pizzas.

"believe the hype. lucali is fantastic. i am constantly dragging my manhattanite friends/out-of-town visitors to this place. as a serious, serious pizza lover, i can say lucali is the best pizza i have had so far in new york (and i've had a lot). the crust is thin and crispy, the sauce is delicious and not too sweet, and the cheese (mozzarella and parmesan) is fresh and, more importantly, generous but not excessive. the toppings are delicious, and while they are expensive ($3+), they are totally worth it. plus, fresh basil and garlic are free, which is a great perk since they are both necessary to great pizza. the prices are high for pizza (when compared to the likes of papa john's or your average pizza joint), but are reasonable given how great this place is. the inside has great ambience -- dimly lit, pleasantly noisy (i tend to get claustrophobic in loud, dark places so i really do mean pleasant), candles on each table, and a view of the ""kitchen"" in the back which is literally a table and two wood-burning ovens. and i love that they are BYO.the wait is annoying, but can be COMPLETELY avoided if you call ahead to put your name on the list -- they'll give you a time estimate and call you when your table is ready. the last couple of times i went the table was ready before the estimated time, which was a pleasant surprise.the staff is brisk and no-nonsense, but has always been pleasant to me. the owner (who also throws the pies) often comes by to check how your food is, which is great. i suspect most of the negative reviews about the service are from customers who forgot to leave their air of entitlement at home... just sayin'.i kind of hate how glowing this review is, but it is totally deserved.",5.0

cute spot. romantic lighting. byob. seems great to me!BUT....- we arrived on a monday at 8pm and were told to wait an HOUR? - no veggies on the menu at all. just one type of calzone and pizza. not even a salad. - no menusafter our dining experience. I can say the pizza was ok. not worth an hour wait OR the no menus and not being able to have a small salad or even something else with our meal.I would probally go again but there are many other resturants in the area to choose from. just not really worth it for me.,3.0
"I really like this place. It's got a really warm neighborhood vibe, with a mix of older folks and whatever you call the younger people who've moved into the area (I wouldn't really call them hipsters) and a smattering of the Chowhound fanatics in search of the next great pizza place. It's great for a date or a small group of friends sharing some wine (especially since it was still BYOB both times I went).I've never been to Grimaldi's, or Totonno's, or Patsy's, or Lombardi's, so I'm really not the right person to tell you how good the pizza is, but I can tell you that you can do far, far worse than the pies here. And it's better than John's on Bleecker, which is just riding on its rep. The crust is thin, the edges crisp, it's got a nice char, the toppings don't weigh it down, the ingredients are quality, there's no grease. It's good enough that I'm willing to trek out here from Manhattan.The only problem is the consistency, which perhaps they've remedied by now. Given that the owner was making all the pies himself, there was much more variation between them than there should be. On one ocassion, we killed three of them, and while it was great that each one was better than the last, it shouldn't have been that way. Another time, the pizza was strangely soggy on the bottom.

"I've  been all of this ""pizza city"" and though it has a few very good spots this is my new number 1.  A lot of people complain that they had to wait in line though I've never had to. I also do not go out to eat on weekends so that might have something to do with it. For my brother's birthday we ordered two pies which came out real fast. The first one was a pepperoni and scallion pie and it was absolutely amazing. Scallions are an underused pizza topping and I do not know why since it's basically a mix of an onion and garlic making it an ideal topping. The pepperoni's were also very good. The next pie was peppers which had a nice spice to it. The cheese is the best part and the pizza maker told us its a mix of low-moisture mozzarella and bufala mozzarella. I'm getting real tired of this artisan pizza craze where I can see my mozzarella and how it melted making it looking like cheese islands in sauce, so this mix is what I've been looking for. The crust looks like it leaves something to be desired due to its large size, but I was all about it. Normally I do not eat crust but this was crispy without being too charred and it added a fun crunch to the pie if you took the broken crispy pieces and put them on the pizza. Service was quick and the pizza chefs were very friendly. A pie is around $24 bucks which isn't cheap, but we also brought two bottles of wine and the fee was $4 total making it a great equalizer for a great meal.",5.0

The first one was a pepperoni and scallion pie and it was absolutely amazing. Scallions are an underused pizza topping and I do not know why since it's basically a mix of an onion and garlic making it an ideal topping. The pepperoni's were also very good. The next pie was peppers which had a nice spice to it. The cheese is the best part and the pizza maker told us its a mix of low-moisture mozzarella and bufala mozzarella. I'm getting real tired of this artisan pizza craze where I can see my mozzarella and how it melted making it looking like cheese islands in sauce, so this mix is what I've been looking for. The crust looks like it leaves something to be desired due to its large size, but I was all about it. Normally I do not eat crust but this was crispy without being too charred and it added a fun crunch to the pie if you took the broken crispy pieces and put them on the pizza. Service was quick and the pizza chefs were very friendly. A pie is around $24 bucks which isn't cheap, but we also brought two bottles of wine and the fee was $4 total making it a great equalizer for a great meal.",5.0
"pluses: very, VERY delicious pizza, very nice serviceminuses: no menu, so you don't know real prices. you are ordering pizza or calzone (nothing else) and add different ingredients (not knowing the price!!), in the end you get the 70$ check for 2 and you're like WHAT???byob too, they don't have alcohol",3.0
def expensive for pizza and wayyyyyyyy too long of a wait but the pizza is amazing!!! and a cute different type setting.. but pizza again is great!!,5.0
"What I want to add here, having now eaten here many times is the consistency of the food. While toppings may change the core essence of the product (crust, cheese, sauce) is repeated again and again. Always wonderful and worth the wait.",5.0

"i LOVE pizza. as in love love love can eat a whole pie by myself lovei've been wanting to try lucali since forever. all i hear are great things and am only 5 minutes away so it doesn't make sense that my lucali cherry still hasn't been popped!it's really no frills and no menu, they just make pizza and calzones. the toppings on the pizza is incredibly fresh, and if you like onions on your pizza (which really everyone should) they put just enough that it offers the right flavor and crunch.it's BYOB so make sure you bring wine(s)! my table over-stayed our welcome so we had to quickly down our last drops of malbec but i honestly didn't mind. i've been on the other side waiting for tables to clear for a ""must-eat-there-or-i'll-die-unfulfilled-spot"" so if the place delivers on quality i don't mind sharing!",5.0

"Line up early for this thin pie with a signature char across the bottom. This cozy and very dimly lit restaurant only seats a fraction of the people found queuing and shivering outside in the winter, but people know it's worth the trip. The small calzone is roughly the size of a football field, but Lucali will likely make you find room for that extra slice.",4.0
"BEST pizza and calzone I have ever had! FINALLY got to eat here after trying to get in every time I have been coming up to Brooklyn to visit my sister. I started to think this place didn't exist! We called right when they opened on Sunday evening at 6pm and were able to get a table for 5. We started by sharing a large calzone with half cheese and half pepperoni. It came with fresh heaping piles of basil and a bowl of delicious marinara sauce. It was so incredibly amazing, I couldn't get enough! We also ordered two large pies, one with basil and one with garlic. Both were unbelievably tasty! The cheese is fresh and flavorful but not too heavy or cheesy. The crust was thin, crispy and amazing! Everything I ate here was to die for. Another wonderful thing about this little piece of heaven on earth is it's BYOB! Which makes for an incredibly cost effective dinner. The service is very friendly and fast! The only drawback is if you don't call ahead right when they open to reserve a table you will be waiting forever because they are always busy and packed! Can't wait to come back!",5.0

"Bliss in a calzone!  This place is delicious.  They only serve pizza and calzones but both are amazing. Best calzone ever! and biggest.Ive only had take out from here but the atmosphere looks intimate and cozy.  It has a low candle lit, rustic feel. Plus they make the pizzas at a little table right in the dining room.  If pizza places exist in heaven I imagine they would look and taste like this.YUM!",5.0
"Even though it's oh so much more special (basil flown in from Israel, $24 price per pie) then the pizza I had growing up in North Jersey it really, really reminds me of it - which is a good thing. I love that there's not a lot of options, you're going to pizza or calzone (period), because that's what they do well.  It's soda or sparkling water if you don't bring your own bottle of wine or beer, which they very kindly accommodate. The bathroom is so cute and is everything I'd want in my cottage home away from the city.  This is a great place for a date, nice when your mom is visiting from out of town, or of course, with a friend. Just keep in mind that it is a pizza place and service, although quick, is casual. My 'hood pairings - wine from Smith and Vine and wait for your table by having a drink at Bar Great Harry.",5.0

"I recently went to Lucali's for a friend's birthday party.  It is BYOB.  Suck it peeps, the yacht was in the shop!  The pizza is really great, but first, a word about the service.  We were a group of an indeterminate amount (11-15).  We arrived early (just before opening, as they don't take rez), but not too early.  They were unable to accommodate us for the 1st service but would call us on the phone when our table was ready for 2nd service.  With Brooklyn Social only a few blocks away, this is NOT bad news.  Then when we arrived to claim our table we were already loud, obnoxious and obviously heavy laden with about a dozen bottles of wine.  Our server, a pleasant demeanored blondish woman whose name I can't recall, corralled our surly group into a quick order and made good recommendations in terms of quantity of food.  She then chilled and brought out bottles of wine whenever asked (we definitely should have left a better tip).I admit we were NOT the easiest group to handle.  However, you never would have known it looking at her.  She definitely helped turn an evening at a pizzeria into a special occasion.  The FOH here is probably THE best I've ever seen in a pizzeria on any continent (host, servers, bus, water etc).  Friendly, blunt, effective, timely, and helpful.  Perfect Brooklyn.  Perfect anywhere.  The rest of the weekend (yes, this tumbled into one of those weekends where your clothes begin to grow hair, and the time of day and purpose seem to shuffle off into nothingness-a weekend that feels like camp or a group vacation) we talked about how every other restaurant's service sucked by comparison.  Honestly.  I even commented once on how weird that was.  But about the pizza...The pizza here is pretty great.  Excellent sauce, great cheese, and a light airy, but only somewhat crackery crust.  The perfect amount of cracker to the crust when the cheese and sauce are this good.  Simply put: it's the kind of place you wish were everywhere.  An impeccably managed establishment.  Kudos to the staff!  I hope this place lasts forever.  And I wouldn't even think twice about recommending it to anyone: whether from Manhattan, Queens, Texas, Toledo or whathaveyous.  Bravo!  Seriously this is all smiles.",5.0

I am still dreaming about the ricotta cheese. Only thing I would add is some garlic! BYOB is great and they will gladly open your bottles for you. They even put our beers in the fridge! It doesn't hurt either that the man with the thick, dark hair makin the pizza is absolutely beautiful... he belongs on the cover of a romance novel with a white peasant shirt on and a damsel in distress hanging from his arms.",5.0
"I just love it when places live up to considerable hype.  After seeing Lucali listed as the 2nd best pizza in America by GQ, I was skeptical.  But this was one of the best meals (not just pizza, meals!) I've had in the last 10 years.  My experience was far different from other reviewers - 30 min wait, amazing service (get Erica, she's the best), INCREDIBLE pizza with pepperoni and fresh basil, and a warm smile and ""thank you"" from Mark!  My advice: go on a Sunday, get there no later than 6:15, and bring nice bottle of red.  Enjoy!",5.0
"I have had Lucali pizza three (3) times.  Twice it was take out and once we ate in house.  I did the same thing with the calzone.  I did not (surprisingly) like my first (eat in) experince and never expected to have Lucali pizza again.  I found the pizza was too wet and steamy when it came out.  I was too hungry to let it cool off and so the heat overwhelmed the taste.   Since then I have had the pizza at a friend's house and ordered it myself as take out.  I have changed my mind: this pizza is truly wonderful!  The crust is crackly in some places and nicely charred.  Other sections are soft as italian bread.  I really don't think the cheese is mozzarella at all.  It is dense and not ""sludgy"" like that.  It is firm, much like locatelli.  If it is, in fact, fresh mozzarella, then it has a very very low fat and water content.  Though nothing like Grimaldi's or Di Fara's, those two types of pizza come to mind.  I happen to really dislike Di Fara's pizza because it is so oily.  But like Di Fara, don't expect a gooey slice.  Like Grimaldi's the crust is the star with the sauce.  The restaurant staff is very nice (not like Grimaldi's), but brace yourself for sticker shock: a plain pie, pepperoni pie and calzone totalled  . . .$61!",4.0
"Hands down, the BEST pizza you will ever have.  Worth the wait always.  Extra bonus is the BYOB, and it really has great atmosphere, it has a warm vibe, homey and romantic.  Might be tough for a large group, but with for 2-4 people its always been okay for me.   The pizza is totally amazing but so are the calzones w/ the homemade sauce.  Cheers!",5.0

"So are we over the hype yet? I'm overly-saturated. It's like when you find out your mom is now listening to the indie-rock band you thought was totally hip and underground just last year.

Well the intimacy of the location is kinda shat on when it's a cramped room that you are rushed into and hurried through like a cow or a Disney tourist. The best pizza? Eh. It's OK. It's good. It's just a brick oven pizza though. All the elements are good, but it's brick oven pizza. It's not rocket surgery.So Lucali's is obviously paying the rent though, as you can see by the crowd any night. So why not move to a bigger space? Come one, step it up Luke.

"We went to this place while visiting family in Brooklyn.

"This place is incredible.Two of us lined up outside at 5:30pm on Saturday night.   There were about 15 people there before us and the hostess came outside to take our names.  We just made it into the first seating at 6pm.  The place holds approximately 30 people and was very romantic with the dim lighting and music.  There were a few families with small children, but luckily they were not distracting.  We sat right by the prep station were a long wooden table had all the fresh ingredients spread out and the warm oven was already cranking out masterpieces.  The pizza chef and his assistants were very seasoned and cool to watch.  We were essentially sitting in the middle of a rustic Italian kitchen. Our waitress was great and very kind.  We ordered one pizza, half cheese and half pepperoni and red pepper.  This is the first place I am willing to compare to Grimaldi's.  The crust was super light and still chewy. The sauce had a nice tang and the cheese had just the right amount of salt.  The pepperoni had a kick and the peppers were crisp and fresh.  It was heavenly.  We ate all eight slices and moved on to our calzone.  It was stuffed with five cheese and there was virtually no oil in the dough, which was a pleasant surprise for me.    We ate everything in front of us.  It was a lovely time.  It was the most I have spent on pizza (pizza, calzone, two Pepsi's for $43) but well worth it.  When leaving, the charming pizza twirler waved goodbye but his expression said ""see you next time"".  And he will.",5.0
"Lucali's is something special! It was written up in Cosmopolitan magazine as the 2nd most romantic restaurant in the USA. My sister called me with this information before her visit last week and we did go there Sunday night. You may be asking yourself how a pizza place can be romantic but let me tell you that if I was on a date I would have been very pleased. There is something about Lucali's that is magical. I will leave it up to you, when you go there, to understand what I mean. We ordered a pizza and a calzone because they both looked incredible. Very seldom does the visual match the taste and we were thrilled that it actually did. The service was great and enjoyed talking with our waitress. After dinner, we were lucky to have a 15 minute conversation with Mark, the owner, outside his beautiful restaurant. I can't recommend this place enough. It is just as good as Grimaldi's but the added benefit here is you don't get the tourists or the rude service that keeps me from patronizing Grimaldi's. Definitely bring some wine and settle in for a fabulous dinner! You will thank me!",5.0

"So in full disclosure I created a Yelp account partly just to review this restaurant.  The reason for this is this is my favorite place to eat in the city. You see I used to be A Grimaldi's fan while not the best pizza in the city it is really close to my house, the lines there weren't a problem because I was a regular and the staff cut me ahead. However as I kept going to Grimaldi's over the years I noticed the pizza declined in quality while the clientele kept getting more and more touristy. I finally got fed up one day when in the Summer I had to rush my meal and a fat Texan tourist kept taking pictures with his flash on and annoying me. At that point I realized Grimaldi's had become too touristy. So I heard about Lucali's on yelp and went to try it. I had to wait around 30 minutes but it was a nice summer day so it did not bother me. When I got in the restaurant it was exactly what I was looking for there was dim lighting a laid back atmosphere and not an obnoxious tourist to be had. Then the pizza came, now I have had pretty much every great pie in New York from Lombardi's to Di Fara's and I have to say that was the second best pie I ever had (Di Fara's still takes number one). I then had the calzone and it was by far the best calzone my lips had ever tasted. Since then I have been going to Lucali's as a regular and have not regretted it. While some people complain about the wait and the service, it is a place that favors locals, which is fine with me as I am a local myself. Also Mark and the Waitstaff are great if you are pleasant towards them. That being said I can understand people being surly after an hour wait so my advice call ahead that is what the number is for. The only real complaint I have about Lucali's is the price is pretty high, however that is basic supply and demand economics.",5.0
"amazingly good. why bother with patsys or heading into manhattan to one of the tourist traps when lucali is in the neighborhood? here's the deal: don't expect to just waltz in and sit down. if it's after 7:30, you're in for a wait. brown bag some beer or wine and that wait will be more pleasant. once you're in, you'll find they keep it simple. pizza and calzones only, same ingredient options for both. i highly recommend mushroom/garlic--somehow its the perfect combo. i'd say a pie per two people is a good ordering gauge-- what you don't eat you can always take home. and everything is super fresh-- you'll watch the owner make your pie--and the setting is lovely (i'm assuming those tin ceilings are original). more recently i've noticed they've started to charge a corking fee--something on the order of $3, but no matter. bring a nice bottle of red and you're in for a great meal.",5.0

The crust was light as air with a sauce from heaven and the toppings were fresh and delish! The whole experience was likened to a popular speakeasy for foodies. After a certain time they turned away customers for takeout.  Customers brought their own beer and wine but they served a variety of canned soft-drinks. Obviously I'm a fan and recommend this experience to the masses!",5.0
"This place is incredible.Two of us lined up outside at 5:30pm on Saturday night.   There were about 15 people there before us and the hostess came outside to take our names.  We just made it into the first seating at 6pm.  The place holds approximately 30 people and was very romantic with the dim lighting and music.  There were a few families with small children, but luckily they were not distracting.  We sat right by the prep station were a long wooden table had all the fresh ingredients spread out and the warm oven was already cranking out masterpieces.  The pizza chef and his assistants were very seasoned and cool to watch.  We were essentially sitting in the middle of a rustic Italian kitchen. Our waitress was great and very kind.  We ordered one pizza, half cheese and half pepperoni and red pepper.  This is the first place I am willing to compare to Grimaldi's.  The crust was super light and still chewy. The sauce had a nice tang and the cheese had just the right amount of salt.  The pepperoni had a kick and the peppers were crisp and fresh.  It was heavenly.  We ate all eight slices and moved on to our calzone.  It was stuffed with five cheese and there was virtually no oil in the dough, which was a pleasant surprise for me.    We ate everything in front of us.  It was a lovely time.  It was the most I have spent on pizza (pizza, calzone, two Pepsi's for $43) but well worth it.  When leaving, the charming pizza twirler waved goodbye but his expression said ""see you next time"".  And he will.",5.0
"Lucali's is something special! It was written up in Cosmopolitan magazine as the 2nd most romantic restaurant in the USA. My sister called me with this information before her visit last week and we did go there Sunday night. You may be asking yourself how a pizza place can be romantic but let me tell you that if I was on a date I would have been very pleased. There is something about Lucali's that is magical. I will leave it up to you, when you go there, to understand what I mean. We ordered a pizza and a calzone because they both looked incredible. Very seldom does the visual match the taste and we were thrilled that it actually did. The service was great and enjoyed talking with our waitress. After dinner, we were lucky to have a 15 minute conversation with Mark, the owner, outside his beautiful restaurant. I can't recommend this place enough. It is just as good as Grimaldi's but the added benefit here is you don't get the tourists or the rude service that keeps me from patronizing Grimaldi's. Definitely bring some wine and settle in for a fabulous dinner! You will thank me!",5.0
"wow, what in the world is the draw here?!  is it the byob, or everyone convincing everyone else through hype that this place is heaven even though its not.  believe me, the pizza and calzone we had were indeed tasty, just not worthy of the price, the wait, or the walk off the beaten path. at all.  the ambience sort of makes  up for it a little.",3.0
by far the best pizza ive had in nyc... my brother used to live around the corner and we went opening night... the place is an instant classic and watching mark(?) make the pies behind the counter is pure art.,5.0
"So in full disclosure I created a Yelp account partly just to review this restaurant.  The reason for this is this is my favorite place to eat in the city. You see I used to be A Grimaldi's fan while not the best pizza in the city it is really close to my house, the lines there weren't a problem because I was a regular and the staff cut me ahead. However as I kept going to Grimaldi's over the years I noticed the pizza declined in quality while the clientele kept getting more and more touristy. I finally got fed up one day when in the Summer I had to rush my meal and a fat Texan tourist kept taking pictures with his flash on and annoying me. At that point I realized Grimaldi's had become too touristy. So I heard about Lucali's on yelp and went to try it. I had to wait around 30 minutes but it was a nice summer day so it did not bother me. When I got in the restaurant it was exactly what I was looking for there was dim lighting a laid back atmosphere and not an obnoxious tourist to be had. Then the pizza came, now I have had pretty much every great pie in New York from Lombardi's to Di Fara's and I have to say that was the second best pie I ever had (Di Fara's still takes number one). I then had the calzone and it was by far the best calzone my lips had ever tasted. Since then I have been going to Lucali's as a regular and have not regretted it. While some people complain about the wait and the service, it is a place that favors locals, which is fine with me as I am a local myself. Also Mark and the Waitstaff are great if you are pleasant towards them. That being said I can understand people being surly after an hour wait so my advice call ahead that is what the number is for. The only real complaint I have about Lucali's is the price is pretty high, however that is basic supply and demand economics.",5.0
"amazingly good. why bother with patsys or heading into manhattan to one of the tourist traps when lucali is in the neighborhood? here's the deal: don't expect to just waltz in and sit down. if it's after 7:30, you're in for a wait. brown bag some beer or wine and that wait will be more pleasant. once you're in, you'll find they keep it simple. pizza and calzones only, same ingredient options for both. i highly recommend mushroom/garlic--somehow its the perfect combo. i'd say a pie per two people is a good ordering gauge-- what you don't eat you can always take home. and everything is super fresh-- you'll watch the owner make your pie--and the setting is lovely (i'm assuming those tin ceilings are original). more recently i've noticed they've started to charge a corking fee--something on the order of $3, but no matter. bring a nice bottle of red and you're in for a great meal.",5.0
