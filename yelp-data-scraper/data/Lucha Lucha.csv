"I measure how much I love food by what I do when I take a bite. Do I shrug, dip it in something, do I put it down and continue my conversation? At lucha lucha after I took a bite of the California burrito I laughed. I laughed because it was so. Damn. Good. I didn't want to talk or think I wanted to enjoy this amazing San Diego style burrito. The tortillas are like nothing you've ever had, flakey, buttery, full of flavor, and layered with oaxaca cheese. Filled with delicious guac, crispy fries and carne asada that is just out of this world. The shrimp burritos are just as good if not better everything tastes fresh, the shrimp is made the order and filled with flavor. All of their homemade sauces, especially the habanero carrot is drool worthy. I would pay money for lucha lucha to open up a location in Manhattan The people who work there are fun, kind, love to chat with you and recommend great food. And make sure to ask about the secret menu ;)You won't regret going to lucha lucha, you'll regret not living in the apartment above it",5.0
"So according to the very handy Google translator - Lucha translates to 'fight' or 'battle' or 'wrestling'.  So, I suppose Lucha Lucha = Fight Fight, right?Well, my friends, I tell you this - if you try and sneak a bite of my Lucha Lucha quesadilla, or worse try and snatch it, I will have to fight fight you.  I may look cute - but I am strong, especially when it comes to protecting my lunch.Why am I so territorial?  It's because Lucha Lucha's quesadilla is goooooood.  Big ol' tortilla filled to the edges with black beans, cotija cheese and your choice of meat (I chose chicken) folded over and grilled to melty perfection - you'd be on the defense too!  Other menu items include tacos, burritos, and bowls with choices of chicken, chorizo, steak and veggie options.  I haven't tried the chips yet - but I did get a side of guac ($1) with my quesadilla and it was pretty excellent.  Also excellent are the salsa options.  Smokey chipotle was my favorite and the name speaks for itself.  The verde was good too but by my third bite w/ the verde salsa the lime juice and cilantro became too much for me, others may love it.  And of course the Habanero was hot.  The restaurant is on the small side but what it lacks for in size it makes up for with personality.  The gal behind the counter was so chatty while I waited for my quesadilla to be made.  And you can't help but smile at the vibrant colors and luchador masks/figurines used as décor around the place.  It's such a happy place.  And I was so happy once I finished my chicken quesadilla.  Sooo looking forward to my next visit.",4.0
"In a city with a serious burrito shortage, Lucha Lucha is the hero we've all been waiting for. I moved here from SF about a year ago and haven't had much luck, but if you know where to look, you can find some gems. This is one of them.I tried the tempeh burrito (I believe the standard burrito comes with rice, beans, guac, sour cream, cheese and protein with some salsa on the side) and it was wonderful! It seems like the cheese is melted onto the tortilla which means it's fully melted and you get some in every bite. Love it! I thought the burrito was a decent size. I'm sure some people might be able to split it into two meals, but I definitely ate the whole thing in one sitting. Oops? It was a little heavy on the rice compared to the protein, but not so much so that it seemed like a rip off and definitely not enough to deter me from coming back. Next time I want to try the California burrito and the nachos also look really good.Another thing to note is that the staff here is incredibly kind and personable. This is a cute, chill neighborhood spot that I can see myself coming back to over and over again.",4.0
"Great SoCal style tacos, burritos and quesadillas.  The burrito is hearty and delicious. The tacos are served on only one tortilla, but they pack in the SoCal flavors with Guac, crema and queso.Order the chorizo anything, the cinnamon and cumin flavors of the meat make it a stand out.Seating is limited if its a busy day.",4.0
"My hunt for the best San Diego-style burrito in the city continues, this time with a recommendation from some SoCal natives. And the rec was spot on: This is a true California burrito.It's the perfect size, filled with fries and no rice (as all burritos should be) and the meat is seasoned to perfection. The only other place that comes close in flavor is the Smorgasburg burrito spot.As with others, I'm docking a star for cash only. Normally this wouldn't bother me, but while we were in there the cashier loudly complained that they didn't have enough change to give to people, and he was ""using money from [his] own wallet."" Uhh, I said, ""have you guys ever heard of Square?"" Blank stare. This is silly, considering they have the FANCIEST iPad apparatus for keeping track of purchases that I've ever seen. C'mon, guys! Upgrade. Thanks for the ATM, but please...this is 2015.",4.0
"ALERT: Large portions, so go with a friend so you can share and titillate your taste buds with various flavors. Lucha Lucha markets itself as San Diego (SoCal) Mexican food in Brooklyn. That it is.  So any reviewer who makes some inane comment about how ""authentic"" it is - just stop. It's not *trying* to tout itself as such. Vegetarians will love it because there are actual fake meat options (Mushrooms or Tempeh). You don't have to be subjected to marinated veggies and beans. My favorite was the Mushroom Nachos - tons of flavors, layers and really fresh. AND it was not inundated with cheese. I was actually shocked that I enjoyed the nachos so much! I could not stop devouring them. The Tempeh California Burrito was tasty - but, to be honest, I didn't really love it. The ratio of fries to tempeh/other ingredients was off - wayyyyy too many fries and they weren't great fries - too starchy. [For reference - the BEST fries in sandwich/burrito/wrap that I have ever had was at Bucharest Grill in Detroit - the Bucharest Shwarma - fries in chicken shwarma with garlic sauce. I could potentially go back to eating chicken just to experience that again]. The sauces were a major highlight. Specifically, Chipotle, Carrot Habanero and Pineapple Habanero. Dripping them on each bite was lovely.Next time I go I will order the mushroom nachos and tempeh tacos or something without the fries... Because it was clear that the ingredients and accompaniments were fresh and tasty (Their guacamole, salsa, sauces, etc... are all homemade, simple and fresh).If I want ""authentic"" tacos/Mexican food I will continue to go to the taco truck at Chilo's a few streets over. But, when I want interesting vegetarian SoCal, Mexican fusion food I will definitely come back to Lucha Lucha. *CASH ONLY",4.0
"Great food at lucha lucha! Very flavorful, and a great portion. I had the carne asada fries and they were delicious. Definitely enough for 2 people. Will definitely be back here soon because  I like the feel of this place as well. Hope a lot of people support this spot because they're serving up quality.",5.0
"We ended up here after Chilos was closed and were pleasantly surprised how enjoyable our meal was.  We tried the salsa and chips, beef, chicken and chorizo tacos. The tortillas used were very fresh and the fillings were perfectly seasoned.  The standout for me was the asada as the steak was very tender and nicely charred.  Tacos came dressed with the usual suspects cheese, cream and tomatoes.  Service was fast.  CASH only establishment.",4.0

"The fiancé and I moved from San Diego to Brooklyn last summer, and besides the weather and great mountain biking, about the only thing we REALLY miss is the border Mexican food.We've tried a few shops in the Clinton Hill/Fort Green/BedStuy area, and a couple were decent Mexican food, but none of them were of the SoCal variety we miss so much. We saw Lucha Lucha on Yelp a few times, but were getting jaded by NYC's legendary lack of SoCal/border Mexican food. So today we decided to just give it a shot, seeming how the guy that runs it is FROM San Diego... and boy are we glad that we did! The guac is legit: fresh, with some salt and lime like it should have, and CHUNKS of avocado - Hellyeah.We ordered a Carne Asada burrito, and a California burrito as well, and both were legit. A taste of home in our new home. The only other thing I really wish they offered is a Chimichanga, but Jay, one of the owners, said that's already in the works, along with a few other surprises - awesome!Jay is a chill guy; down to earth, and friendly.

I appreciate this gesture Lucha Lucha :) I get two  textures with my meal, awesomeness!I did try my BF quesadilla and the bite was great! The beef was in a mole type sauce giving the cheese and tortilla a moist piquancy.The decor is cute- Nacho Libre themed as you see in the pictures. The place is a bit small but not cramped.

"one hopeless norcal and hopeful socal kid walk into lucha lucha one sunday afternoon - carne asada burrito for me, carne asada fries for francis. man, he waited forever for his food...desperately hungry. like longer than you wait for animal fries on a crowded night at in n out...and the crowd wasnt even all that bad. while he waited in agony, i lapped up my burrito, which was very very protein heavy. and also kind of dry, i lathered it with sauces. the habanero was standout, rather mild honestly. unlike norcal burritos, which is slathered in wetness - sour cream, guac, pico and usually orange sauce, this was different. i was fairly upbeat about this place, and then francis's food finally showed up, and frankly, ot wasnt worth the wait. really really dry, he, a san diego native, was rather letdown, but ordered a burrito to go anyways, acknowledging that was probs the better move. its a worthy effort, but leaves something to be desired. then again, when u talk california burrito as a spot, you set a high standard to achieve. like you dont expect much of some places, they wow you, 5 stars. whereas here its like you went all the way from midtown to bedstuy, not to mention he waited for a long time, expectations are really high. unfairly high. these spots really do try, and they are so nice and lovely, so there efforts should be rewarded. but our palettes are bitchy, so yeah...",4.0
"I love that this place has vegan options other than the typical sautéed onions and bell peppers! They actually have a vegetarian protein on the menu- tempeh. It's an unusual choice for a burrito but it works.

One the foil container is extremely hot on the fingertips and if you try to hold it on one side you end up causing the plastic cover to cave in. Secondly, you should always make sure your paid and leaving customers have everything they need ( hot sauce, utensils etc) before you turn to get into deep conversation with other patrons, especially if you see them still standing there (clearly that means they still require something) Also, I don't like to see coworkers be aggressive to one another especially when it's not your business.

But Lucha Lucha doesn't really seem to do that.The tortillas are from a bag. The carne asada was overly salty, the chorizo was kind of bland. Both were strangely acidic. The mushrooms were okay, but nothing wonderful. Just a sub par taco experience that I'd prefer to never experience again.On the plus side, the servers were very nice. And despite not being made to order, the guacamole was pretty good and plentiful for the price. And if you like Mexican Coke, well they have it, so there's that.

The chorizo was not very flavorful like it normally is and the sour cream, cheese, and guacamole on top...ahhhhhh I wasn't a fan but it's ok.

Also had a side order of chips and salsa ($3), which actually featured a real adult-sized bowl of normal freaking salsa (i.e. simple tomatoes and lime instead of NYC's usual thimble of over-the-top smoked-poblano-and-cascabel blend) just like you'd get in California.However, the tortillas really need some work -  not of high quality and the ones with the tacos were soft and completely lacking any oil, as if they'd been steamed instead of griddled. Ditto for the chips, which seemed like they were baked. I will say that the burritos other diners were eating had flour tortillas that looked really nice - lightly browned and slightly flaky, as opposed to the too-thin or too-thick varieties normally found around town.",3.0
"I love this place so goddamn much. As a SF transplant in Brooklyn, I have been in pain trying to find a decent place for burritos out here. And I've come up short everywhere. BUT. This chill-ass californian dude shows up in Bed-Stuy with his delicious blend of San Diego mexican food and I am ALL IN. thank you, chillest man on earth, for the calfornia burritos you have brought us.",5.0
"So here's the thing... It's pretty well documented at this point that New York has some good Mexican food. Different dishes, different regions, different styles, all represented. And I'd think if you were a relatively new restaurant, you'd want to try to carve out your own little spot in the culinary landscape. But Lucha Lucha doesn't really seem to do that.The tortillas are from a bag. The carne asada was overly salty, the chorizo was kind of bland. Both were strangely acidic. The mushrooms were okay, but nothing wonderful. Just a sub par taco experience that I'd prefer to never experience again.On the plus side, the servers were very nice. And despite not being made to order, the guacamole was pretty good and plentiful for the price. And if you like Mexican Coke, well they have it, so there's that. But if this were my local taco joint, I'd ignore it until a better option opened.",2.0
"The best burrito I've ever had. Jay was super nice and gave me the low-down on a campechano California burrito (recommend getting for true San Diego experience). Great flavor, great portions, great service. Welcome to the neighborhood!",5.0
Great place to bring a beer and sit at the counter and eat delicious tacos and burritos. Try the campechano tacos!!!! The meat is marinated to perfection. So much flavor!,5.0
"I almost can't believe a tempeh/french fry/guacamole burrito exists, but I'm so glad it does. Ultimate vegan comfort food. The mushroom burrito was pretty good too, but next time will order the mushrooms in taco form. I think they would stand out more without the rice and beans.",4.0
"The Good: Most importantly, the food is good.The Bad: the most basic requests aren't allowed. I requested extra cilantro and they said no. It's fairly slow.  And although it's decorated cute, it lacks an overall welcoming vibe  Overall: probably best for delivery or pick ups to go.",3.0
"I was looking for authentic Mexican food which I didn't find here unfortunately, but overall the food was of really high quality.The decor is neat, fun. Nice atmosphere. We ordered tacos and a burrito. Burritos are rarely seen in Mexico but I had a craving :). It was stuffed with yummy fillings but I would've liked more of selection as to the salsa offered. There was only chipotle this time. Also, if they are looking to go authentic they could add rajas con crema or something similar to add some nice flavor and creaminess.The tacos...ok. The chorizo was not very flavorful like it normally is and the sour cream, cheese, and guacamole on top...ahhhhhh I wasn't a fan but it's ok. I'm more of a Mexican street taco lover.This place seems pretty successful given the yelp reviews, so if this is what works for them then they should keep doing it.Given the great service and the sounds of a California burrito I would like to go back!",4.0
"Holy guacamole..I found the promise land for tacos on the run with some kick ass flavor. I had the chicken, steak and chorizo tacos and I have nothing negative to report. My lovely companion (Mariel) had the rice bowl with steak,pinto beans Pico de gallo and guacamole. Two happy customers signing off",5.0
"Found this gem one day and was able to meet one of the owners, Jay. Very laid back and friendly! The place is quaint and colorful with Mexican wrestling masks as the decor.They have a lot of the usual items that you will find at Mexican restaurants, but they have Campechano!!! This was the first time that I've ever heard of this and Jay told me that it is a mixture of chorizo and steak! Needless to say that I had to try that in my burrito and my mind was blown!!! The flavors are full and and you are able to taste the different ingredients which compliment each other nicely! I am a huge fan of this place and so very happy that they opened in my neighborhood!!!!",5.0
"The food was okay, I wouldn't say its particularly authentic. My chicken taco was pretty dry, the tortilla chips and Guacamole were good. I ordered delivery here and watched the driver drive past my residence (super close to their location) all the way across town and then pass my residence again on the way back to their location.  It is an assumption on my part that they would deliver to the closest place first however the driver completely forgot about me. Its okay accidents happen, However, when he showed up he seemed annoyed that I asked him to come in through the first door so that I wouldn't get locked out, when handed me the food he said ""enjoy, bye"" really curtly and offered no apology or anything. I sorely regretted leaving a good tip before receiving my order. IF I order again,  I will not be tipping ahead of time.",2.0
Most authentic tasting California burrito (Carne Asada Fries in a Tortilla!) I've had in a long time. Got nostalgic about SoCal while munching on it. Definitely going back and bringing a crew,5.0
Being from San Diego I'm very particular about my  California Burrito ... Lucha Lucha has awesome carne asada and the salsa is bomb! In North County San Diego they don't do Guac in the Cali burrito so I get it on the side. Also for all of you San Diegans FYI there is no yellow cheddar cheese they use Oaxaca cheese. Think I might just bring my yellow cheese next time  The owner Jay is awesome so is Stacy we will definitely be back.,4.0
"Man, I was so excited to try this place. I've lived in San Diego my entire life so hearing about a place in NY that has socal-style Mexican food seemed like a dream come true. I got the carne asada fries and...The food wasn't bad. I'll give them that. I didn't love it, but I'd normally give it at least 3 stars; maybe 4 if it didn't cost $15. But this didn't even come close to what ""socal-style"" carne asada fries are like. This was covered with some bean/mole sauce and I could barely even taste the meat or the fries. There was just way too much going in what should be a relatively simple dish.Maybe the cali burritos would be better, but I'm honestly a little apprehensive to go back after the disappointment of the carne asada fries.",2.0

"I've been searching for a real California Burrito in NYC. I've finally found one! For those who don't know, that includes french fries instead of rice. This place had the perfect amount of fries which were perfectly cooked. Plus guac included. And fresh, quality ingredients.",5.0
"Here's proof that quality ingredients make all the difference. I'm writing this as I finish my burrito, a basic beans and rice with the usual accoutrements: cheese, pico de gallo, sour cream guac... However... the ingredients are all so fresh and flavorful that this simple burrito is one of the best I've had in recent memory.The tortilla tastes like real bread--it has the flavor and texture of lavaash. The rice is not your typical restaurant rice... it seems somewhere between jasmine and basmati and actually has a flavor of its own (not spiced up), as rice should. The beans are perfectly cooked, and its topped with the right amount of sauces so as not to overwhelm the simplicity of the basic ingredients.Now if they only used organic or antibiotic-free, humane meat, it would be the perfect place and I would journey out to Bed Stuy just to eat there. For now, I'll just hit them up for a veggie burrito every damn time I'm in the neighborhood.",5.0
"The cost and the amount of food you get are pretty on point. At first, for a taco joint, I was like wow, pretty expensive. However when our food came out, there was a lot of it. I easily had leftovers for the next day from my rice bowl. The food is good. I'm from the border of Texas and Mexico, so the spice of the meat was a bit different for me, but not horrible. It's tiny inside, so we opted to sit out front and people watch. The staff was super friendly and warm, so kudos to them.",4.0

"Driving home from Manhattan trying to get away from traffic went into Bedsty so I decided to come here since I had bookmarked for a while. The place is tiny but nice. Ordered three tacos the carnitas were awesome the chicken was great, crispy and juicy at the same time. The only reason no 5 stars they have to double up on the tortilla by the time I got to the second taco it broke up on me and the third. Forget about it it was all mush and the fillings were all falling out. I will be back and I hope they make this little change to make the taco experience better. Had to update my review. Just got a message front the owner and he said they do double on request since I didn't know I will move it up to 5 stars and will ask to double next time",5.0
"Ordered here late on a Saturday night. It was my first time so I wanted to sample a few items off the menu. So I started off with the chicken rice bowl, chicken taco and a steak burrito.

He didn't try to rush me out like some places may right before its closing time.Food=Amazingness!! The meats were marinated and seasoned to perfection. Enhancing the dishes even more.  Pico de Gallo was beyond fresh and they use queso fresco instead of the gross orange colored pseudo cheese that some other places serve.

I assumed that because this place claims to be authentic, that maybe cilantro wouldn't be the main ingredient. Again, my bad. I dissected one out of three tacos and choked it down, but ended up eating $30 tortilla chips because the guacamole (that was clearly out of a tube) was comprised of cilantro as well...

The guacamole was great, and so was the green hot sauce, and chipotle house sauce!Overall: Lucha Lucha is a cool neighborhood spot, food is good, oh yeah I fell in love with Jarritos grapefruit soda, and staff is nice! Next time I'd probably settle for a seamless takeout order, if they're on seamless.",3.0
Great neighborhood taqueria that I recommend you try! I've had the burrito and the tacos and I loved them! Glad this place is here. I think the owner is from Cali so he knows what a proper taco should taste like and he's making that happen right here in Bed Stuy! Support this restaurant!,5.0

"Great food, better people. I walked in ordered the three taco special and then dun dun dun... I realized I had lost my wallet. Shit. I tell the guy at the counter and he says well I'm not going to let you go hungry and puts the order in anyway. Everyone in the place was giving me morale support including the guys at the counter. It was unreal. After calming down a bit and letting the feeling of going to throw up subside I ate my pretty delicious tacos.  It felt pretty good to be treated like a human... A human who lost their wallet and was pretty starving. I was luckily able to pay the guy back with their app via PayPal but I'm glad he had faith in me to come back and repay him.  It's awesome to have a great taco spot in the neighborhood, even better to be treated like a friend. Love it.",5.0
Awesome space! Very delicious authentic food and quick too! Gladly come back next time I'm in the area!,5.0
Awesome place!  Who cares if the tacos aren't authentic Mexican tacos? They taste excellent and are very generously sized.  And guac is included!!  Burrito with fries are also awesome.  We try to stop by on our multiple runs to Home Depot. So happy this place is on our way!,5.0
This place is awesome. I live close by and find it hard to walk home without wanting to stop in for some tacos. The staff is always super friendly and the food is excellent.I would absolutely recommend you stop in for some tacos or a rice bowl. Make sure you get some guac too!!,5.0
"The food is very good. Maybe a little too salty for my taste but still very good. I come here often. Love the owner. Always playing some good obscure 70's blues rock. Keep up the good work!!! Expand your menu a bit. We want horchatas, tamales, soup (in the winter).",4.0

"I went to Lucha Lucha today for the first time, and I'm already looking forward to my next trip there.  My girlfriend got a tempeh burrito sans dairy, and the tempeh was wonderfully cooked and seasoned.  I struggled to choose between the mushroom rice bowl and the mushroom burrito at the counter, and while I ended up ordering the rice bowl, due to a miscommunication I received a mushroom burrito.  This was a welcome mistake, however, as the burrito was super delicious (and--let's be real here--I immediately regretted not ordering a burrito anyway.)  You could probably walk in, tell the employees to surprise you, and leave satisfied.  The house-made chips are also tasty and well-seasoned, and the coffee is surprisingly better than the drip at most of the area's cafes.  Lucha Lucha is, by far, the best option for California-style Mexican food in the neighborhood, especially if you're looking for vegetarian or vegan options.",4.0
"I stopped in after seeing it on the way home, naturally. I love trying different Mexican-inspired cuisines thanks to my Mexican boyfriend, so we both decided to try the new month-old place. The cashier, Nia, is such a sweetheart. Being that this place is still new and has not yet experienced the heavy rush of its neighboring Mexican spot--Villa Poncho--she makes it a warm/friendly environment.The cook, Rona, is such a gem. He seasons all of the meat (and even dips) to PERFECTION. It tastes like I'm eating a home cooked meal.I got the rice bowl with chicken, and they do not shy away from loading on the rice.... Definitely not the stingy-Chiptole type. It came with cilnatro-white rice, sour cream, guacamole, cheese, and I added lettuce. My boyfriend got the two tacos for $5 deal and stuffed them with steak. MY GOD, it definitely made me want a steak rice bowl, which I'll probably get the next time I go. We also got the chips & guac. While, their chips & guac. is cheaper than Villa Ponchos, they definitely do not give half as much of either. And, Villa has homemade chips-- so I'll be going to Villa (one avenue away) for chips/guac. and Lucha Lucha for everything else :)",4.0

"My suspicions is that anyone who doesn't give this place a 4 star either had something they didn't really normally care to eat or they work for the competition.Either case, my wife and I split 2 dishes, a California Burrito and a Rice Bowl with Steak and Churizzo.  I have never eaten a California Burrito but it had Fries and I love trying new things. Needless to say, wow! It was delicious!The Rice Bowl had a lot of the things you would expect, but the combination of the quality of the ingredients really made this one of the best Rice Bowls (if not the best) I have ever had! It was the Campechano. OK, so maybe I really don't frequent many different Mexican Restaurants, I would say perhaps 10 different ones in my lifetime, but it's really the best and certainly tops places like Chipoltle.The manager, Jay, was very personable and helpful.

After numerous customers who had come in and ordered while I was sitting there waiting were served their food, I asked if mine would be ready soon and was told that they'd gotten busy with online orders and that mine would be right out. The guy at the counter's non-plussed tone was unmistakably intended to make me feel like I was being uptight or a jerk for simply asking where my food was, which I really did not appreciate. I waited an additional 10 minutes before my burrito finally came out. The guy at the counter offered me a free soda, which I appreciated on some level but declined (I mostly just wanted to have not spent half an hour sitting there waiting for my pick-up order when I could have been at home).

With other shops around offering the same old blandness, Lucha Lucha stands out as the real deal. The Chorizo packed to the brim with creamy avocado. The classic Campechano with perfect med-rare steak. I could sit here and further describe the impossibly perfect torta that I am eating, but instead, you should stop reading this, pause Netflix, get off of your couch and go melt your face.",5.0
"Was a little skeptical at first.  Being from Texas and having grown up in California, I am very picking about my Mexican food.  Lucha Lucha did not disappoint! Massive portions too. I recommend they relocate their trash cans throw a picnic bench or a couple tables in front.  Friendly service.  I'll become a regular!",4.0
Great food and friendly service. The California burrito was delicious.,5.0
Great place. Really good food all around. Best mexican place in this neighborhood so far. I wish they closed a bit later.,5.0
"been meaning to try this place since it opened, finally dragged myself over there. nice, vibey space, friendly peeps. tried the rice bowl with tempeh. it's very very good; just the right amount of spice, nice combination of things. will definitely be back (am gonna try a burrito next time). hope they do well here; i will certainly keep them busy...",5.0
"This place manages to do so much with so little space. The carne asada fries are excellent, as are the tortas. Spot on SoCal Mexican.",5.0
Lucha Lucha is a great Brooklyn spot. If you want flavor taste this is the place. Other taco places don't have the taste and flavor of this establishment. Excellent.,5.0
Great food and great staff.  Just found this place the other day.  It's going to be my new go to.,5.0
"You want good vibes and a better burrito, hit this place up. I'm drawn here equally by both every time I'm in the neighborhood. The chorizo will change your life. If it doesn't, your genetics have failed you. Also the coffee - skip the place down the block and just get the chemex here.",5.0
"Auh-maze-zing. Born and raised Southern California kid, the California burrito brought me back to the tastes and smells of home. Before eating any Mexican food in New York I have very low standards no matter how good other people say it is it never compares to home. I was floored at how good this place was and how it resembled everything I grew up on. I will be eating here as a staple in my diet from here on out. And it's in my neighborhood, even better.",5.0
"Great food and vibe! Plus the owner is super nice, great local spot.",5.0

Awesome food - the best Mexican food I have had in Brooklyn. The owner/manager often hangs around and is a very nice guy. I would definitely recommend eating here. Try the carne asada fries - they are my favorite!,5.0
