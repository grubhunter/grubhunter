I'm not sure I want to review this place. Because I don't want it to change and have tons of city folk coming!But it's so so good. The pork belly bao buns are unreal...difficult and messy to eat. But so yummy!! Their salt and pepper spring rolls are so flavorful..but be careful you'll want to eat them so fast that you'll scorch your mouth!!Come. Eat. Enjoy.,5.0
"Simple snack foods with supposedly higher quality ingredients. Had the spring rolls, pork belly bun, beef dumplings, pork potstickers, and special foie gras bao.Everything was just ok. The dumpling and potstickers skin was very thick. The meat fillings were also just ok for me. I couldn't taste any foie flavor in the bao. The aged beef was funky but not in a great way. The pork filling could have been better seasoned.Overall, not worth a special trip, but ok if you're nearby and want a snack.",3.0
"After the Blizzard, took the train, bus, n walked through the slush... For a long missed taste of Chef Chris' #damngoodchinesefood Had a hot, fragrant bowl of ""pig n mushroom juk""...and his divine dumplings!  nirvana for tastebuds!The juk was more like a soup. The broth was layered in flavors. Simmered rice that burst into flowery grains alongside strips of black mushrooms and bites of ""pig""... Each spoonful hit spots of tastebuds, olfactories, and beyond with yumminess, perfume and a warm tummy... My only complaint - I didn't see a large/quart size offered! ;)note: photo shows remnants in cup :PThe dumplings were delightful as always....#fresh #nutritious #twoordersYes!I've missed the food so much - I took mouthwatering Sweet Chili-Ribs and Happy Buddha Veggies home!!  #DoubleWhammyYumYums!!",5.0
"Ordered: Honey lemon sour plum drink, Pork belly bao, and Pan fried pork dumplings Pros--The pork in the dumplings were juicy and full of flavor. The bao was packed with flavor as well--hoisin sauce, pork, cucumbers and spices on top. Cons--There was too much food on the bao, making it hard to eat with your hands. It would've been better to have a little bigger bun. The drink was so overwhelming with a prune flavor that I didn't enjoy it whatsoever. The service was not as attentive as I would've liked. They brought the bill before I even finished eating and never bothered to refill my water.",3.0
"Super strong 4, these are my personal best dumplings in Brooklyn, by a long shot!  I am happy that there is a spiritual heir to the dearly departed dumpling specialist Eton, which I dearly and deeply miss.   Both the incredibly juicy pork dumplings and the wonderfully smokey and musty dry-aged beef pot-stickers belong firmly up in the pantheon of the cities great dumplings, along with the Chinatowns soup dumplings,  Rego Park's Mantis,  Greenpoint's pierogis, Jackson Heights' Momo's, Bensonhurst's raviolis, and the many many more wonderful forms of dumplings to be found across this great city.  The high quality ingredients and classical training of the chef shine through thoroughly and profoundly, and more than justify the slightly elevated price tag.        I would love to give the place a functional if not actual five stars, however, while I respect the brevity of the Menu, I would only wish there were another non-dumpling dish or two that could if not match, at least approach the same stratosphere of quality of the dumplings, and effectively fill out an order here to the level of meal, as opposed to one of the best possible snacks.  The spare ribs were tasty, though not necessarily registering as better than the average to be found at the local good delivery option.  The Foie Gras bun was likewise tasty although the elevated ingredients might make you expect it to be more mind blowing  Seasonal vegetables taste  d fresh enough though somewhat muddled in terms of flavor.  Theres not much else to be found in terms of menu options, and I usually just get one of each of the dumplings.  Setting is sparse but clean, serene and pleasant, and the same can be said for the staff and service.  No booze to be found and takeout is a solid option, but if I decide to dine in I usually order my dumplings, which of course are made to order and take a good solid 10 minutes minimum, and head across the street to either Farrell's or Double Windsor to enjoy while I wait for them being prepared.",4.0

"Mmmm! First off - East Wind Snack Shop is clean, the service is friendly and helpful, and the prices are super reasonable for the quality of food you're getting. I would recommend going with a friend or two and ordering a bit of everything and splitting it - like asian tapas :)We ordered: Lychee boba: light, refreshing, and great flavor. During the summer months you definitely won't regret ordering it to startPan fried juicy pork dumplings: 5 in an order, perfectly golden and somehow the insides have a slight taste of a soup dumpling. Must order for first timersdry aged beef potstickers: I'm not used to such nice meat being in a dumpling but I can tell you I'm a huge fan. They come in small circle pouches of crispy goodness - definitely try pouring some of the in-house made soy sauce mix!foie gras bao: Light, fluffy, savory... For someone who isn't a huge foie gras fan I can tell you that I would definitely order these again. happy buddha vegetables: This might have been my favorite dish of the day. Mushrooms, greens, bean sprouts, all mixed together in some amazing seasoning. Even if you're not vegetarian you're going to love thissweet chili ribs: The ads don't lie - it's really fall off the bone meat that is somehow still crispy and not overly salty. A must order but be warned that you should wait a couple minutes for it to cool off before you dig in. hong kong hot cakes: Didn't know it was possible to elevate such a simple dish but here we are! I'm used to grabbing some of these hot cakes off of street carts and scarfing them down before the end of the block. These hot cakes are worth savoring though - the lemon flavor really comes through and almost tastes like a delicate madeline cookie... The best way to end your meal :DIn summary - take the time to check out east wind snack shop.. and then walk off all the inevitable food belly you'll get afterwards in prospect park.",4.0
The space is small. But put to good use. It has about eight (bar) stools divided between two counters with four tables and chairs in the middle. It's fresh and clean. Really very clean. It's a one page no frill menu which I like. If you eat in they'll bring to your table a cup of complimentary tea. I didn't drink it as I'm not a tea person. Considered asking for wine replacement but I wanted to continued the good manners that abounds here. I only tired the pan fried juicy dumplings and it lived up to its name. I also got some dry snacks to go as I'm a big fan of most Chinese snacks. I heard other diners comment about how great their selections tasted. Nice. Customer service: 1 starCleanliness: 1 starAestehtics: 1 star Food: 1 starPrice: 1 star Grand slam total 5 stars!Also it's right as you exit the subway station at 15th street/Prospect Park West so that's a plus.The End.,5.0
"We stopped here after a short bike ride in prospect park for lunch. My son and I shared the dry aged beef pot stickers, the pork dumplings and a buddah's delight.The dumplings and pot stickers were some of the best I've had.

I give east winds 3.5 stars Since our last visit the dumplings have improved significantly.The spring roll could still do with some improvements.There isn't much filling but at least now it's crispy.I also tried the foie gras bao which was very unusual.I probably would have preferred my bao dry without the salty wet sauce topping as it kind of ruins the lovely texture of the bun.I recommend this spot to eat dumplings and sip tea!,3.0

"All I can say is Yum!  East Wind Snack Bar is a small, unpretentious place for street-food style snacks. Food is served in red-checked paper baskets and diners get their own empty basket instead of a plate. You do have to ask for chopsticks, but tea is served automatically in lovely ceramic cups. Service is friendly. Food comes out as it fires, so don't expect anything in any particular order. The must/haves: chili-glazed spare ribs (riblets with a sweet/spicy glaze, served with rice & pickled cucumbers), pork bao (only one per serving but it's big enough to share), and dried beef potstickers. I loved the foie gras bao; husband did not care for it. The salt and pepper spring rolls are crunchy and tasty but are a little greasy. Today we tried the Shanghai vegetarian soup dumplings. I liked the ginger taste but there was a bit too much sweet potato, which made them a little gummy, and not enough soup (it may have all been sopped up by the potato).   I don't think I'd order them again.

"I've walked by this locale a thousand times over the years. There was always some new restaurant here that never took, whose arrival I'd await with anticipation yet with menus that ultimately never enticed me. That changed now that East Wind Snack Shop opened a month ago. Chef Chris Cheung (Nobu, Jean-Georges) may have cracked the code of this odd little space right off the F train at Prospect Park.Cheung has lived in this hood for 16 years. I bet he walked down those F Train steps thinking ""what could I do with that space?"" as often as I have. The result is a small family run spot by a local and celebrated chef buzzing like none before it.The menu (dumplings, buns, ribs, spring rolls, etc.) is tight and approachable - seemingly do-able in a super small kitchen. Were there days early on when they'd run out of dumplings? Yeah, but you would too if your dumplings tasted like these. And they're on top of it, even extending their hours till 9.Did we wait a bit when we ordered to go? Yeah, but it's a new hotspot, and that's what happens. I'm not rushing to Yelp to complain about it. I even take some of the blame since we really should have just eaten there instead of taking-out. It's a nice low-fi vibe. Cute stools. They were sweet and apologized for the wait, twice giving us treats, including these Haws that my girl knew instantly. Soft sugar wafers wrapped like Chinese firecrackers.There's plenty of other kitschy treats on hand from chocolate and strawberry Pocky, to Ramune soda, and Foco Tamarind.We sauntered home with steaming hot dumplings and such in a brown paper bag, our expectations high. Maybe too high, considering there was no guarantee this stuff would even still be hot when we finally dug in. Cut to the chase; everything was hot and delicious. The Pan Fried Juicy Pork Dumplings were delectable. Just the right amount of salty, not overly doughy and not stingy with the pork, cooked perfectly with a shiny happy sear. The dictionary definition of what I want when I want one. And I want more than one.We also had the the Sweet Chili Ribs with Pickles and Jasmine Rice. They were a thing of simple beauty, even fresh out of the plastic take-out carton. Perfectly tender and glazed. I did a little dance inside when my girl let me eat the last one.Oh, East Wind, we needed you in these parts. I look forward to a getting my hands on your buns and hotcakes.jealousfoodies.com",4.0

The vibe of this tiny restaurant is casual, but the quality of the ingredients is very high. Credit goes to Chef Chris who sweats the details and who excels at making simple dishes great.In a neighborhood that generally doesn't have good Asian food, let alone good Chinese food, East Wind is a very welcome addition.

I bet he walked down those F Train steps thinking ""what could I do with that space?"" as often as I have. The result is a small family run spot by a local and celebrated chef buzzing like none before it.The menu (dumplings, buns, ribs, spring rolls, etc.) is tight and approachable - seemingly do-able in a super small kitchen. Were there days early on when they'd run out of dumplings? Yeah, but you would too if your dumplings tasted like these. And they're on top of it, even extending their hours till 9.Did we wait a bit when we ordered to go? Yeah, but it's a new hotspot, and that's what happens. I'm not rushing to Yelp to complain about it. I even take some of the blame since we really should have just eaten there instead of taking-out. It's a nice low-fi vibe. Cute stools. They were sweet and apologized for the wait, twice giving us treats, including these Haws that my girl knew instantly. Soft sugar wafers wrapped like Chinese firecrackers.There's plenty of other kitschy treats on hand from chocolate and strawberry Pocky, to Ramune soda, and Foco Tamarind.We sauntered home with steaming hot dumplings and such in a brown paper bag, our expectations high. Maybe too high, considering there was no guarantee this stuff would even still be hot when we finally dug in. Cut to the chase; everything was hot and delicious. The Pan Fried Juicy Pork Dumplings were delectable. Just the right amount of salty, not overly doughy and not stingy with the pork, cooked perfectly with a shiny happy sear. The dictionary definition of what I want when I want one. And I want more than one.We also had the the Sweet Chili Ribs with Pickles and Jasmine Rice. They were a thing of simple beauty, even fresh out of the plastic take-out carton. Perfectly tender and glazed. I did a little dance inside when my girl let me eat the last one.Oh, East Wind, we needed you in these parts. I look forward to a getting my hands on your buns and hotcakes.jealousfoodies.com",4.0
"Absolutely delicious food. The atmosphere is casual, kind of diner-ish. The food is unbelievably good, and super inexpensive at that! Low-key, everything is paper/plastic. Fun and friendly environment--the staff in particular were very kind and easy to talk to. Also the food came out super quickly. Loved that we could see Chris Cheung at work from our table! Nice guy.",5.0
"Like many new restaurants, East Wind stumbled out of the gate, but they quickly recovered and are now serving food that's consistently delicious, as well as providing service that's gotten smoother and more attuned with each visit. The well-priced menu is limited, but everything I've had has been spot on. The beef potstickers, spring rolls and sweet chili ribs are my personal favorites. The vibe of this tiny restaurant is casual, but the quality of the ingredients is very high. Credit goes to Chef Chris who sweats the details and who excels at making simple dishes great.In a neighborhood that generally doesn't have good Asian food, let alone good Chinese food, East Wind is a very welcome addition. I'm thrilled they're right around the corner from me. Actually dangerously close. But I'm more than okay with that.",4.0
"Foie gras bao sounds like a ridiculous gimmick, which is why we ordered it, but it turned out to be kindof amazing. I don't even like foie gras. It works here. How about that?You've probably already heard that chef Chris Cheung is a veteran of Nobu, Jean-Georges and Ruby Foo's, so you know there's pedigree here. You may also be familiar with the tortured history of this cursed location, which has seen a fried oyster joint and the ambitious Brooklyn Proper come and quickly go in the past few years. But dumplings are the correct answer to ""What could thrive in a small place like this without a full kitchen?"", and here's hoping Cheung is the guy who exorcises the curse, because this food is awesome.Sweet chili ribs are beautifully glazed. Pork belly gwa bao was delicious, and I feel qualified to say that because - I know this is going to make you want to punch me - I had the same thing for lunch from a different place and it was better here. Dumplings themselves are terrific, and affordable. (Some of the other stuff gets less everyday affordable. Foie gras bao, man. Who even does that?)Basically the whole neighborhood was in there last night, shooting the shit with Albert behind the counter. They have such a nice, casual feel going on that we were almost bummed our food was ready so quickly. (But, I mean, we did have to get home to watch Broad City.)Fingers crossed for this place. These are the dumplings we deserve.",5.0
"I've only been once so far, but my experience was great.  I had the fried pork dumplings and gua bao.  I really enjoyed both - the filling in the dumplings was particularly good.  I'm hoping to go back to try more things.  This is the first full week the place is open and it is absolutely a mom and pop joint, so you might have to be patient while they figure out their kinks.  Still, first impression of the food and people are great and I don't doubt that they'll put it all together sooner than later.",5.0
"I have to admit, I was disappointed.  We tried the fried pork dumplings, and the gua bao.  The fried dumplings were disappointing - a little better than the norm for the neighborhood, but considering how bad the local chinese food is, that's not saying much.  The gua bao were definitely better, they were tender and yummy, but not the best I've had, either.  Overall, I will say, for the neighborhood, this is definitely the best you're going to get.However - the food had a painful wait, partially caused by the fact that it seems like none of the people taking or serving the food had ever worked in a restaurant before.  After waiting over 30 minutes for my dumplings and gua bao, and watching the chef fill my order ticket 10 minutes previous but still not having it prepped, I asked what was going on, and they started to give me my order... and then realized it was still missing two gua bao.  Anyways, he was able to whip up some more quickly, but it was just one of those things where if I hadn't been paying attention and hadn't gotten tired of waiting, I could've easily waited another 15 minutes before they even remembered to fill my order and let me go.The reality is that the place just opened a few nights ago, and it shows a lot of promise, but they definitely haven't yet worked up their rhythm, yet, and so call ahead or be prepared to sit around twiddling your thumbs for a while.  Would I recommend them?  Eh... probably not yet, but I suspect that given a few more weeks to work out the kinks, it'll be really good.  I'll try it again in a couple of weeks (and try some more dishes) and update the review then.Edited to add: something else worth noting, before you go visit - they close after they run out of food, and so far, that's been around 7 or 7:30 pm each night, and even by 6 they've sold out of half of the dishes.  If you're going to go, go early, or call ahead.",3.0
"What a great lil shop to stop in for a casual meal. My wife and I had a Friday night dinner here and shared a bunch of deliciousness. The dumplings, potstickers and bao bun were top notch. However the spring rolls were my personal favorite. It was a fun environment, and each dish came out piping hot and as fresh as could be. I know I only Yelp when a place is a 4 or 5, and this joint is a 5 on the food alone. We will return.",5.0
"This place is a Gem. So glad I live close by. The pork dumplings were perfect, bursting with flavor and the right consistency. I also had the pork Bao and it was delicious. Recomended if you need a quick snack on your own, or come with a few friends and share a bunch of small plates!",5.0

Food is very good but they are very slow.  I was the only person there and still waited 15 or so minutes for myfood.  I also ordered a passion fruit bubble tea that was awful.  I have no idea how they made it but it was a color and consistency that I have never seen before.  The bubbles also weren't fully cooked.  I would return but only if I called my order in.  I wouldn't go back on a spur of the moment decision.,3.0
"Good service, great food (it's legit), reasonable price. What's not to love? I like the fact that the chef cooks everything fresh. You really see the love & effort he puts into his food. As a Chinese person, I appreciate that he keeps the taste authentic. A great addition to the neighborhood",5.0
"Delicious, cute and fun spot. First time to this neighborhood in Brooklyn but well worth the trip. We had a variety of dumpling which were juicy and super flavorful. The Foie Gras Bao is house made as is everything at EWSS. It seems a lot of care goes into this spot and it could be in every NYC borough. Very well conceptualized. We tried some of the BBQ items which were also good. The owner suggested trying a Sour Plum Drink which we all loved. After a cold beer  to start on a hot day it was  good with food as sweet dessert-like drink. I really liked all the snacks to make a meal. It was fun to try all these new tastes.  The chef is so nice and cooking everything to order so all items are fresh. Unusual in most dumpling places. At the end of our meal we had an oder of the Hong Kong Hot Cakes, very cool and yummy. First time having those, too! We'll be back to this spot. It's what NYC is all about. Trying new things for the first time, and meeting new people in a neighborhood that all about community. That's why I moved here. Congrats!",5.0

"Stopped in after reading all the amazing reviews last night.  We waited almost an entire hour to get our first item.  The egg rolls were just ok (certainly not worth the hour long wait).  Next we had the pork buns; the bun itself was tough and chewy, the pickles not so much pickled as just slices of cucumber.  Finally we had the much touted pork dumplings, which I was underwhelmed by.I wanted to like this place so much- it's in our neighborhood, it serves dumplings (my favorite!) and it seemed like it would be a quick and easy picnic to take to the park.  Sadly, I won't be back.  An hour for sub par dumplings when there are only twelve other people waiting?
