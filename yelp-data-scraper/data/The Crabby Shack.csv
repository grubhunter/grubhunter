"I just moved to the neighborhood a few weeks ago and was wandering around with my boyfriend on a Sunday afternoon looking for lunch when we stumbled upon this gem. Aaaaaamazing food, and amazing people! The owner came out to say hi and welcome to the area. We had the crab cakes and crab roll, both of which had generous servings of crab and a perfect amount of seasoning. We also ordered a side of corn bread which had a light coating of honey and was basically cake, but better. Can't wait to go back and try the rest of the menu.",5.0
"If your craving seafood, this can be your go to place. After examining the menu a friend and I decided to give this place a try. We were not disappointed. You can eat in or take out. The place has a cute nautical theme and for although it's on the small side they have plenty of seating. We found a seat in the back and the place was fairly clean even though the patrons before us decided to leave crab leg shells on the floor Crab roll- nice portion and FULL of crab meat.  I enjoyed the flavors but it did seem to be missing a component. I can't put my finger on it. The roll is soft and buttery and so is the crab, maybe a crunchy component would be a great addition. Either way it's worth the moneyCrab taco - Was just ok. We later realized they had shrimp tacos and would have probably have those a try but our order was already in.Cornbread - delicious! It's honestly more like a desert but I really enjoyed it. Crab Mac and Cheese - This is the reason I gave them 4 stars. This dish is amazing. Again, they don't skimp on the crab meet and the Mac and cheese itself was great. The nice crunch throughout is probably my favorite. Banana pudding - although it is not made in house, ( it's from the Brooklyn Sweet Spot) it's hard to find a pudding that remotely compares to my grannies homemade pudding but this one comes so close! Overall this place gives you exactly what you pay for. I will definitely return.",4.0
"I heard such wonderful things about this place. So when my best friend came to BK wanting crab I told her I knew just the place. It's a cute little place. It actually reminded me of the Krusty Krab on spongebob for some reason. The cashier was very nice and patient as we asked many questions and pondered over the menu. We decided to get 2lbs of crab legs each, crab mac & cheese, crab blt and the lobster roll. I also tried the elderflower infused sparkling water. It was so good I drank one at the counter and had to order another. We were disappointed they were out of the house made lemonade. The crab blt was delicious but the crab was an after thought. In fact if I had a blind taste test I would've just said BLT. I know bacon is a overpowering ingredient but there was very little crab on the sandwich to begin with and the crab that was there tasted like nothing.  I would order again if I was in the mood for a BLT. The lobster roll was bad. $20 for a claw meat only, bland mess. My friend was so disappointed as was I. I don't suggest anyone waste their money. Crab Mac was okay. Again it was bland and I didn't appreciate biting into the overly crunchy cheese topping with every bite. It would stick to my teeth and the only flavor I could taste was bitter cheese. I wouldn't order again. Now for the crab legs themselves. We ended up taking them home because our eyes tend to be bigger then our stomachs. We ate them later on in the evening waayyyy to salty. I mean they should've took some of the salt from the crab and added to the lobster roll. It was basically inedible. Unless I wanted to spend my day off in the hospital from high blood pressure or a stroke. Being the resourceful person I am and not wanting to be out of $50 bucks. I removed all the crab meat from the shells and made crab linguine with a Parmesan cream sauce the next day for dinner. It was quite tasty and I didn't need to add any salt. Despite the less then stellar experience I would've been willing to give this place another chance but I witnessed a very unsanitary practice and that sealed the deal for me. The kitchen has a good size window so you can see into it. A cook came out of the kitchen with his gloves on.  Opened the front door of the restaurant with his gloves one. Opened the outside basement door with his gloves. Walked down the steps and came back upstairs with a bag of mixed greens with his gloves on. Opened the front door of the restaurant again with his gloves on. Went back into the kitchen and continued preparing food still with the same gloves on. Not even health inspector themselves can quantify the amount of germs, bacteria and cross contamination that was on those gloves. When I saw that I should've just asked for a refund and left but I was in a state of morbid shock. Crabby shack that is a NO NO please train your kitchen staff about improper glove use. For him to do this so freely I'm sure this is a reoccurring offense.",2.0
"I'll start by saying I really enjoyed my crab roll, but the spicy butter wasn't what I thought. The seasoning thrown on top was unexpected. They're known for the rolls and I was not disappointed. The crab Mac was a little bland. It could use some seasoning. Not so much to overpower the crab and cheese...but something. The corn bread was toasted a bit much, and was more like a slice of cake...I don't think it meshed so well with my food. My friend was also not a fan. The service...we ate in. When we got there, we had to wait a good couple of minutes to order because their phones were ringing so much. I get they're busy...but they know they are busy and should have their system organized a little better. I also didn't appreciate listening to the attitudes toward one another behind the counter while I ate. When it was time to go, I guess the man that walked in to the front counter was more important than me standing there and all I needed was lids for my food containers. I would go back, but only for take out. I'll stick to the crab roll and that's it.",3.0
"Stayed in Brooklyn in December and found this high rated eatery on Yelp. Place was clean and had nautical design theme. Walked in and the friendly staff immediately greeted and took my order. Of course, I had to try a couple of items :)First, the Crab Roll. I was salivating when I saw it come out of the kitchen. It was stuff full off real fresh crab meat. I also ordered the Crab Mac & Cheese. It took a little longer because they bake it from scratch but was worth it. Piping hot, gooey tasty cheese w/ nice crust, and again, filled with real crab meat (see close up pic). The mac was big enough to share for 2 but I was solo so more for me...lol. Only wish the order of Crab Roll came w/ a side for the price of $13. The mac was only $11 bucks.FYI, they don't serve fountain sodas here but offer homemade lemonade or ice tea and artisanal natural bottle sodas. I tried this Pineapple Coconut Nutmeg soda and it was delicious.",5.0
"I've been meaning to go here for months, but for whatever reason it hadn't happened. Until.....I had a lazy Saturday committed to Netflix, the couch and the potential to clean my apartment. This of course needed to be complemented by a delivered meal. And there is was on the seamless listing. Hmm I always envisioned sitting down inside the crabby shack and enjoying my first meal onsite, but the couch seemed like a great alternative.  Delivery was prompt and as promised which is great for a Saturday evening.  I ordered the crab roll and crab mac and cheese. Everything was very tasty - mac and cheese wasn't overly cheesy or greasy and I didn't feel as though I'd been duped on my crab portion.  Portion wise I'm happy that I ordered the mac and cheese to accompany my crab roll. A crab roll alone would not cut it. I would definitely order from here again. Maybe I'll eat at restaurant next time.",4.0
"Upon entering the store we were greeted and I proceeded to stare at the menu for five minutes, trying to make up my mind. I finally settled on two crab tacos with chipotle mayo something I had enjoyed on my previous visit and a side of broccoli.I genuinely believe they read their Yelp reviews and have definitely taken heed to people comments. This time my tacos were stuffed! Lots of fresh crab meat, cabbage and radishes but they odeed on the sauce, it overpowered everything. After scraping majority of it off the flavors of each ingredient were able to shine. The broccoli was delicious, very buttery and garlicky; a perfect side to anything on the menu. I originally was going to give a three star rating but a few bites into my second taco I noticed an eyelash stuck to the bottom of the taco shell. I was beyond disgusted and brought it to the owners attention. She was apologetic and offered me another taco on the house. I was not interested as I was already turned all the way off but accepted and got it to go. Staff is still helpful and friendly and the owner did her best to rectify the situation but I will not be returning.",2.0
The crab roll is solid.  We had had the Mac n Cheese.  I amNot sure how I feel about that yet.  So the crab roll was stuff when crab to the brim. You can have it with butter sauce which I love because mayo is no beuno in my mind.  This place is hole in a wall small restaurant with some seats feeling.  The service is decent a little slow. I did not have a chance to try the other items. I think the corn bread would be my next bite his place,4.0
"Came here for lunch and I cannot stress enough the fact that I loved every single we ordered. We got the crab BLT ($14), crab roll with chips and a drink ($17), crab mac and cheese ($11), and a small crab and corn chowder ($8). Crab BLT was generous with crab meat and basically a BLT with a side of crab crack. The crab roll was super meaty and buttery and salty in just the right way. And the crab and corn chowder was probably the best corn chowder I've ever had in my life. We came here today for Valentine's day lunch -- best lunch of the past year for sure.Staff is incredibly nice and friendly. You order at the register and the place is self service. The insides are bright and clean and reminiscent of a beachside.. Well, crab shack. Two large tables, a couple small tables, and bar-stool seating are available.Highly, highly recommend this place. We will be back again!",5.0
"Love at first bite!!!! I was lured in after passing their creative chalkboard on numerous occasions and then seeing that thee Denzel Washington was here. I now crave this place and have to talk myself out of not coming everyday. I always get the same things; crab roll, broccoli, and cornbread. Everything is amazing. The corn bread is really sweet and unlike any I've had anywhere else, in a great way. The broccoli is always perfectly cooked and I love the sauce that comes with the crab roll. They are usually pretty busy so food sometimes takes a few extra minutes to cook but I promise it's well worth the wait. I'm so happy this spot is so conveniently located!",5.0
"Simple and plain, the food here is excellent! I mentioned a great lobster place a week or two ago, but crab is, first of all a cheaper option and just as tasty.  They do also do lobster here as well. As per usual anywhere, lobster is about $5 more.  I'm sure I'll go back to try it as well one day.I went with the buttery crab roll. It was great. Stuffed full of crab on a simple hotdog bun. They had a crab Mac n cheese that I thought it redundant to try so I decided to just get the normal Mac n cheese.  The Mac and cheese is phenomenal! I'd go back for it alone. It rivals and surpasses the likes of that from many of the local West Indian restaurants.My friend had the crab grilled cheese sandwich. They use the same mixture of cheeses as the Mac and cheese, so to couple that with crab was perfection as well.  I also had a bit of her honey butter cornbread too.  Good stuff.Oh and there's banana pudding! It's more custard and less banana and wafer than I'd make at home for myself but the taste was still good enough to compliment as a dessert portion of the meal.I was originally planning to bring my own beer because I saw a review about it being that type of establishment. Luckily I went in first and saw that they had a small but adequate selection of beers and ciders, so all was well.Great place and I'll be back soon.",5.0
"This establishment has been on my list for a while and I finally got a chance to check it out.  I visited the restaurant on a weekday around 8pm with a friend.  The decor of Crabby Shack so cute, clean, and bright.  There are a couple tables in the restaurant but I wouldn't recommend bringing too many people in your party for that reason.  The music here is PERFECT and I am pretty sure it is because of the neo-soul music playlist and the cool and calm vibe it created.Then have a decent size menu from crab legs to lobster rolls to crab rolls.  Which is enough of a reason to return for a second time.  I ordered the Lobster roll and took about 10 minutes to make it.  When I received my food I was kind of surprised because just lobster meat on a bun.  I am use to having lobster roll that has mayo and maybe a little green onions.  The lobster meat was tender, well seasoned, and tasty.All in all this is a restaurant I would return to SOON and urge people to try if you love well season fresh seafood.",5.0

5 Stars!!! Can i show you how I did my dance when I tasted the Crab and Shrimp?Oh boy. The food here is delicious. My taste buds were in Seafood Heaven.

The cornbread taste like someone's Grandmas recipe from the south. It had the right amount of mystery sauce on it. Lol. It's a bit expensive but you can't go wrong! I spent $40 on myself! It's never crowded and the restroom is uber clean. That's a pet peeve of mine! There was Cotton in the restroom the first time i went by and I thought to myself this is strange and kind of took me back. Then I met the owners the last time I stopped by and they are Sisters! And very humble... They hopped on bicycles and rode off into the sun! I wish them the best of the best. I will return again and dine in one day. You can BYOB!,5.0
"Five stars for crabby shack. You should only come here if you want crab. My family and I had : a crab roll, crab Blt, crab grilled cheese, crab tacos and crab cake sliders. The crab cake sliders are kinda dry and there isn't an option for a plain mayo or something, because the chipotle sauce didn't taste balanced and neither did the aioli sauce. Alas, the crab roll was my favorite- it was buttery and plentiful. This place is great because you get crab without all the hard the work that comes with eating crab; however, this place is a bit pricey and for everything I mentioned plus 4 drinks was $74 . So understand this deliciousness comes at a high price! Enjoy",5.0
"Had the Famous crab roll and crab mac and cheese, the roll was exactly what it says it is.

If I'm in the neighborhood and craving crab I'll hit this spot gain, there's nothing of the sort near by. I appreciate the meal combos to save a few bucks.",3.0

On a cold winter night I wandered out to get some yummy comfort food.  The Crabby Shack was on my list for some time so I decided to brave the cold for some yummy seafood.Ordered the crab roll with spicy butter.  The roll was full of fresh crab.  Wow..was impressed.  Every bite included some yummy crab.  The only disappointment was that I love spicy.  There was nothing spicy about the butter.  It tasted regular.My biggest disappointment was the mac and cheese I ordered.  It has zero flavor and no salt.  Like no salt.  I'm salt sensitive and cook with light salt.  That's why I know they didn't add any.  It was eight dollars in the garbage.  It was also dry.  I hate to waste food but I'm considering throwing it away which breaks my heart.I'm a believer in supporting small businesses so I will try them again.  I'll just stick to the crab meals.  I'm currently eyeing my peach cobbler..I have my fingers crossed.  Lol.,3.0

"First time eating here on Sunday night.  It was highly recommended by a good friend. Bad crab, bad food! Soooo much season salt on the crab and on the tacos.  There was so much salt we had to brush it off with a napkin. It was even under the taco shell. It was all over my clothes and fingers smelled like season salt even after several hand washes.  I ordered the $20 crab legs they were very dry, SHELL hard as a rock and when cracked the meat had no moisture and it was stringy like fiber. I ate them because they were expensive but they were so tasteless. Very little crab taste. All I could taste was their awful seasoned butter. I think the crab was old frozen, frostbit because the shells were so rubbery.  Some areas of the shell were transparent that's how old it looked. I won't go there again. The tacos were terrible too. My daughter ate only one or two bites and was done So disappointed. I took my daughter here with me for a mother daughter dinner date ,wish the food had been better. $50 bucks wasted.  I looove crab and I have had it many times before. My memory of it was that  It tasted great with just some butter ,lemon. The meat was thick and plump, light pink and it came out smoothly, delicious and juicy , soft and full flavor. I do want to say,Very nice employees,  sweet and helpful. I should have said something but they were so busy and I didn't want to ruin my nice date and conversation my daughter.",1.0
I've ordered from here twice. The first time the crab and shrimp were great and had awesome flavor. My only complaint is that the shrimp isn't peeled or cleaned. Today was my second time ordering and I tried the crab tacos and shrimp tacos...completely AWESOME! My sister ordered the crab legs and shrimp but complained that it was too salty. I didn't believe her and had to try it for myself and it was overwhelmingly salty. Practically inedible. She couldn't eat it and ended up having to spend more money to buy something else. I'm giving 3 stars because my tacos were awesome and the delivery was quick...I'm also factoring in my first experience with them.,3.0
Was on franklin ave looking for another restaurant. So glad i walked into The Crabby Shack!!!!! I had a shrimp taco and a crab taco with chipotle mayo sauce along with their cornbread.

Planning on going this weekend again and trying the grill cheese and of course another serving of cornbread :-),5.0
"Seafood Heaven I must have died and gone to seafood Heaven. Man oh man, what a great dining experience I had going at The Crabby Shack! Honestly, I loved everything about this diamond in the rough. The diamond of course being the Crabby Shack. The rough being the  minor renovations going on in the neighborhood.Now, why did I go? Well, a good friend of mine invited me to try this ""seafood spot"" in the neighborhood that he has become a regular at. Of course by now, you know what that ""seafood"" spot is called. So naturally, I join him and a few of my friend to chow down on some seafood that turned out to be most amazing. After a few minutes of observing the menu and voyeuristically observing the finger lick - gum smacking delight of other diners, I decided to go for the gusto. I ordered one of their more pricey items (rightfully so) the crab legs.I'm not going to go on and on but what I can tell you is that I finished my well seasoned crab legs in record time. My friends and I enjoyed the food and drink selection so much, two of my friend ordered takeout. I was so taken in by the food, I imaged that the dessert must have been just as good. The one item they had was banana pudding (I suggested they add peach cobbler - lol - personal preference) I ordered the banana pudding and finished that in short order as well! The staff? Simple A++++You will enjoy everything, I promise.",5.0
"Exploring the area I book marked this place after seeing it on a reality show. Cute small atmosphere like everyone describes. $26 got me- crab roll which was full of crab and taste! A crab taco- all crab, I skipped the cabbage and relish. I liked it but the taco shell could be better. It's soft so it won't crumble like a hard shell but.... Idk. Again it was good. The side of corn, cut in half was moist and juicy and kissed with old bay seasoning. The peach ice tea made it all flow well. Great experience. Great island music and not too loud.

I took it home so my crab roll which was delicious and filled with yummy buttery crab was a little cold I bet it's better if you eat there.  I also got the crab Mac which was cheesy and had a decent amount of crab inside. I had 1/2 pound of spicy shrimp and the spicy butter was on point! It was bursting with flavor although wasn't too spicy just a little spicy. The platter was for my wife and she said nothing through out  the whole meal. The crab sauce was pretty tasty. The butter was delicious ! look forward to going back and sitting in so my food will be nice and hot. Overall I had to give this place a thumbs up.",5.0
"First time eating here on Sunday night.  It was highly recommended by a good friend. Bad crab, bad food! Soooo much season salt on the crab and on the tacos.  There was so much salt we had to brush it off with a napkin. It was even under the taco shell. It was all over my clothes and fingers smelled like season salt even after several hand washes.  I ordered the $20 crab legs they were very dry, SHELL hard as a rock and when cracked the meat had no moisture and it was stringy like fiber. I ate them because they were expensive but they were so tasteless. Very little crab taste. All I could taste was their awful seasoned butter. I think the crab was old frozen, frostbit because the shells were so rubbery.  Some areas of the shell were transparent that's how old it looked. I won't go there again. The tacos were terrible too. My daughter ate only one or two bites and was done So disappointed. I took my daughter here with me for a mother daughter dinner date ,wish the food had been better. $50 bucks wasted.  I looove crab and I have had it many times before. My memory of it was that  It tasted great with just some butter ,lemon. The meat was thick and plump, light pink and it came out smoothly, delicious and juicy , soft and full flavor. I do want to say,Very nice employees,  sweet and helpful. I should have said something but they were so busy and I didn't want to ruin my nice date and conversation my daughter.",1.0
I've ordered from here twice. The first time the crab and shrimp were great and had awesome flavor. My only complaint is that the shrimp isn't peeled or cleaned. Today was my second time ordering and I tried the crab tacos and shrimp tacos...completely AWESOME! My sister ordered the crab legs and shrimp but complained that it was too salty. I didn't believe her and had to try it for myself and it was overwhelmingly salty. Practically inedible. She couldn't eat it and ended up having to spend more money to buy something else. I'm giving 3 stars because my tacos were awesome and the delivery was quick...I'm also factoring in my first experience with them.,3.0
Was on franklin ave looking for another restaurant. So glad i walked into The Crabby Shack!!!!! I had a shrimp taco and a crab taco with chipotle mayo sauce along with their cornbread. The cornbread is to die for! Its not the typical. Tacos were amazing!!!!! And im not much of a crab eater but this is my new fav local spot! Planning on going this weekend again and trying the grill cheese and of course another serving of cornbread :-),5.0
"Seafood Heaven I must have died and gone to seafood Heaven. Man oh man, what a great dining experience I had going at The Crabby Shack! Honestly, I loved everything about this diamond in the rough. The diamond of course being the Crabby Shack. The rough being the  minor renovations going on in the neighborhood.Now, why did I go? Well, a good friend of mine invited me to try this ""seafood spot"" in the neighborhood that he has become a regular at. Of course by now, you know what that ""seafood"" spot is called. So naturally, I join him and a few of my friend to chow down on some seafood that turned out to be most amazing. After a few minutes of observing the menu and voyeuristically observing the finger lick - gum smacking delight of other diners, I decided to go for the gusto. I ordered one of their more pricey items (rightfully so) the crab legs.I'm not going to go on and on but what I can tell you is that I finished my well seasoned crab legs in record time. My friends and I enjoyed the food and drink selection so much, two of my friend ordered takeout. I was so taken in by the food, I imaged that the dessert must have been just as good. The one item they had was banana pudding (I suggested they add peach cobbler - lol - personal preference) I ordered the banana pudding and finished that in short order as well! The staff? Simple A++++You will enjoy everything, I promise.",5.0
"Exploring the area I book marked this place after seeing it on a reality show. Cute small atmosphere like everyone describes. $26 got me- crab roll which was full of crab and taste! A crab taco- all crab, I skipped the cabbage and relish. I liked it but the taco shell could be better. It's soft so it won't crumble like a hard shell but.... Idk. Again it was good. The side of corn, cut in half was moist and juicy and kissed with old bay seasoning. The peach ice tea made it all flow well. Great experience. Great island music and not too loud. Staff was wicked friendly and full of suggestions. Will be back.",4.0
"One of the best meals I've had in NY so far. I didn't even know I liked crab until the Crabby Shack. My friend had the crab roll, corn, chips, blueberry lemonade, honey butter cornbread AND the pear red wine PIE. Need I say more.",4.0
"Nice and cozy place. Friendly staff, this was my first time there with my family. The lady who took our order made some suggestions and we decided to go with the crab roll with avocado and garlic butter. Also ordered the honey butter cornbread. We took a seat and waited for our order. It didn't take long about 15 mins. When it came and I took the first bite omg!!! The bun was so soft the crab meat was well seasoned!!!! The cornbread was sweet and heavy so make sure you save that for last. I ordered the lobster Mac n cheese to go because sitting there watching other people order made me want it too. But definitely going to come again worth it not to pricey but not too cheap. Thank me later",5.0

"Placed an order via phone and the lady was very pleasant. She said my wait will be about 35 mins. They took 19 mins. I'm impressed! I always say tell us more time when it's less. Noooice!Ordered 1lb Alaskan snow crab platter with broccoli and potatoes in garlic sauce, and 1/2 lb spicy steamed shrimp. I asked that they replace the spicy sauce with  garlic sauce. The food:Ordered half because usually a pound lasts for days in this home. Not today, it's a little on the small lb size lol. It also looks like shrimp cocktail (plain steamed shrimp) because I really didn't see the sauce. The broccoli and potatoes sides were served in the same bag as the crab.On to the taste:I enjoyed the potatoes. Can someone even mess that up? The broccoli and sauce was on the salty side TO ME. I'm realizing I need to stop commenting on the salt in meals. I do not like salt but others do so soak it up Freeyah!The shrimp was nice. I scooped the sauce over the shrimp for added taste. The crab was easy to open without a cracker and tasted really really good. But as a shell food lover I would say that. I'm happy to report thr food and overall experience won me over and they've found a new customer. I may even order more later THIS evening *grins* The delivery guy was pleasant and muy easy on the eyes ladies!  *wink wink*The End.",5.0
"I went here to eat the other day and walked out as if that never happened. After I ate my 4 inch, stringy-crab-meat-hot-dog-bun, I was still so hungry I had to regurgitate my food and eat it again. LOL. Times are too tough to be fooled by this place....I got the crab roll and mac & cheese. Crab roll is sinfully priced at TWELVE DOLLARS. Do not be fooled - the crab meat is shredded thinner than jellyfish tentacles and its served on a hot dog bun (not even a Blue Ribbon!!). The mac & cheese was an over-baked, wannabe ""soufflés"" that was tasteless and dry. If I wanted to choke on dry food, it'd be a biscuit from Popeyes! Inedible. Don't go to this place if you actually want to eat and drink. If you're craving seafood from the Pacific Ocean, I advise you to skip this place. If you know anything about seafood, you can see right through the eyes of the oh-so-neighborly owners - $$$$$$$$$$$$. At least know what you're doing before you put the big-boy price tags on your food. What a joke!",1.0

The Crab Roll is filled with real crab meat!  Mac & cheese also stuffed with real crab. Staff is super friendly.I strongly recommend this place if you're a seafood lover,4.0
"The crab roll was acceptable. The bun was buttery, delicious and perfectly chewy. The crab was fresh, but its mostly claw meat from spidery crustaceans of the stone crab level. So yea, you're not getting jumbo lump crab meat in your roll and if you have a real craving for satisfying seafood then this might miss the mark. The mac and cheese was pretty bland and could use the addition of a stronger cheese. The corn bread was kind of sad too-- it didnt have the right texture and lacked flavor. The lemonades were unimpressive so go with a soda if youre looking for something sweet to wash everything down.",3.0

Too much crab kinda.  Usually I wouldbt like mayo on a crab roll but this one kinda needs something added to it.  I also ordered the crab blt since I heard great reviews.  Took a few bites and threw the rest out (I ate the bacon of course).  Totally overhyped and overpriced.  I don't think I'll return here unless it's to try the crab legs and the tab is on someone else.",2.0

"I must admit that I am pretty disappointed with my latest visit.  I always like to try a place twice before giving it a lower star and rating just in case they were having a off day.  The first time I went I thought it was mediocre I thought that the crab roll was good but now $12 worth.I went again today and order the crab roll and while it does have a lot of crab meat in it (seems string like the Cannes version) I found it to be a little too, hmm, idk how to even explain it. Too much crab kinda.  Usually I wouldbt like mayo on a crab roll but this one kinda needs something added to it.  I also ordered the crab blt since I heard great reviews.  Took a few bites and threw the rest out (I ate the bacon of course).  Totally overhyped and overpriced.  I don't think I'll return here unless it's to try the crab legs and the tab is on someone else.",2.0
"Oh welcome to the neighborhood Crabby Shack! Yelp had this on my list to visit and I'm so glad I did! A cute casual little spot that transports you to a seafood shack off the beach instead of off Franklin Ave. The staff is super cool and helpful. The place is very clean and the decor is cute and simple. There are a couple spots to sit but not many. So grabbing a quick bite with a couple of friends for a foodie date like I was on is probably a better idea than bringing your whole entourage. The food is delicious and fresh. We got one of the crab rolls and the 1lb snow crab platter (platter means +2 sides) with corn (so sweet and fresh) and broccoli (a bit over cooked... Will go with 2 corn next time). The crab roll was like a lobster roll, slathered in garlic butter and packed with fresh snow crab meat. A perfect portion and good if you aren't looking to get your hands dirty. But personally, I love getting my hands dirty! So moving on to the crab platter... It was two sets of snow crab legs with about 4-5 legs per and lots of lump crab on the body to pick out. Super fresh and not overwhelmingly seasoned. The shell is soft enough so you don't need crab crackers... Unless you can't handle it ;) but if you do need them, they got them.I highly recommend the lemonade and the selection of fruity sodas they carry. Things to know: small casual spot and clean up after yourself please. Not a cash only, they do accept credit cards. Great spot for carry out too.We were too full for dessert this time around but there's always next time! The cupcakes look so cute!",5.0
"Amazing place, really like it.The crab taco is so tasty.Combined with corn and potatoes you're sorted",5.0
"Overpriced and tasteless. Go to the Fish Store on Fulton and Arlington. Much more variety, five times more veggies for the same $3.00 or so (i rcvd an amt equate to a famine at Crabby Shack) and condiments galore to your avail. What a joke. I was looking for a bag of steamed crab n received anemic legs for $52. Live once, yet skip this unless u like disappointment. For that same 52 bucks, if you go to the fish store on fulton, you would have food for three in all variety. More theme and trend than quality.",1.0
"I'm selective with crab rolls. I usually enjoy the crab rolls from the Plaza hotel or a place called Rollin' Lobster in LA who imports directly from Massachusetts each week. This spot however, is on another level. First- I am pleasantly surprised by the pricing, very fair $12 for a crab roll is a go! Second, the warm garlic butter and the softest potato roll ever with just a touch of sweetness to exec that's the crab. The broccoli was a touch too crisp but seasoned well and while I am not a corn person, the corn in the bag with the spicy shrimp had a nice kick. The spicy shrimp were headless. Heads are a deal breaker for me so I was happy about that. Be sure you let it marinate for a few or ask for extra sauce (.50). I found that the shrimp on top weren't flavored as well as those on the bottom. The drink assortment was great and every drink was $3. I had the pineapple, cinnamon nutmeg and it was so refreshing. My husband had the cucumber and mint water and enjoyed that as well.Service was too notch. The establish is cute and clearly family owned. I will continue to support. Welcome to Brooklyn, Crabby Shack!",5.0
"This place sells rotten sea food! I have spent hundreds of dollars at this establishment over the past year or so and really liked it until I ordered the crab legs and they tasted of strong ammonia. I could not finish eating them and I called the restaurant to complain. They asked me to dig in my trash can to return the food and I gladly did. They gave me 15 bucks back of the 46 dollars I spent after I asked them to kindly refund me whatever they think is reasonable, then called me to tell me that there was nothing wrong with the rotten food and that I had taken advantage of them?? Then hung up on me. :/",1.0
"I ordered 2 crab tacos, corn and lemonade via Grub Hub.  The delivery was prompt. The crab tacos were salty and there was much more slaw/cabbage on the taco than actual crab meat. Being from the south, I've had much better crab tacos. The corn was delicious & the lemonade was watered down & pitiful. I won't be ordering from here again. $20 wasted.",2.0
This place is really solid. The crab roll is always a good choice at $12. Be mindful that it's not super large roll but it is always overflowing with crab meat on a soft and buttery bun. I like the crab grilled cheese as well for something different. The corn bread is pretty darn good to add on to an order. I would say skip the crab mac and cheese. It tends to be a little dry and doesn't have a ton of crab in it for the price. None of their portions are very large so think about adding a side to your entree if you're really hungry.,3.0
"please do yourself a favor and get the lobster roll!!!!! it's a special as of 8/20/15,  I'm not sure how long it's going to last but it is godly! for $20, you get a lot of lobster. I do wish that the buns were a little larger, (maybe they should consider making two different sizes) but it is totally worth the money. the roll was lightly toasted, very soft to bite, the lobster was perfectly warm - not too hot not too cold and seasoned to a T. these folks know what they're doing! I must come back and try their crab and/or lobster mac & cheese as I am a loverrr of mac & cheese. oh! I almost forgot to mention the decor, I loved every minutes of it, especially the front viewing window where you can watch folks walk up and down Franklin ave as you eat. a nautical theme was a perfect choice for this seafood spot. the employees are super sweet and welcoming. I will definitely be back!",5.0
"Found this place via grubhub and have only ever ordered delivery and have always been super satisfied. Their food is so good and delivery is always fairly quick. I was skeptical to order delivery from a seafood spot, especially in NYC where seafood isn't exactly the delicacy around here, but omg I was so pleasantly surprised. I had the crab roll with garlic butter- so very good! I also have tried the potatoes (seasoned perfectly and delicious), the cornbread (loved it my first time, not as crazy about it second time as it was a little on the dry side), and the banana pudding is just amazing. Some of the best banana pudding I've ever had. Definitely order here or stop in (which I still need to do!)",5.0
"I happened upon this place when they were still doing their soft opening. I had already eaten but decided to give it a try after speaking with one of the owners was outside. That day I tried the steamed shrimp and what a wonderful choice it was. Since then I've gone back and had the crab roll, crab mac and cheese, and the delicious corn bread. I've never been disappointed with any choice that I've made here. I usually try to bring out of town visitors to this lovely little Brooklyn gem because I know I'm guaranteed to have friendly service and great food.",5.0

The star of the show is really the sauce the crab/shrimp combo came in.  It was spicy, sweet, delicious.  A real knockout.  I also thought the cornbread was quite good and that the chowder was solid (but not out of this world).  My knock on the food is that the portion size was a bit small (next time I think I'll get the $23 platter and see if it fills me) and the crab was about 2 minutes overcooked so it was drier that it should be.  other than that, the food was great and I enjoyed the meal. I'll definitely be back again!",4.0

"Lapin and I came here on Sunday as we were both craving crab. We ordered two crab tacos which were good. They were packed with crab but they felt like it was missing something.  Lapin said it was because the dressing overpowered the delicate taste of the crab. We also ordered the famous crab roll which was ah-mazing. It was packed with just crab meat...none of that filler stuff  like salad you would get at other places [Sagaponack -- I am looking at you]. And of course, we ordered one pound of  Alaskan Snow crab legs with 2 sides. To be honest, it definitely didn't feel like a pound. And the sides were a bit skimpy. We ordered the corn on the cob (2 pieces) and the potato was just one potato cut up into quarters. I wish they had more seasoning options available like at other crab boil places than just plain Old Bay, which was strong and overpowering on some of the crab legs and other pieces it was bland.  To wash it down, we had hibiscus soda which was pretty interesting. Lapin liked it more than I did.On a side note, apparently this place is BYOB as I saw some customers drinking and the owners didn't say anything. To order [we were a bit confused by this at first], you place your order at the cashier and give your name and then you can pick up your order. And be sure to ask for your receipt because the prices do fluctuate and after doing the math we were charged a lot more than listed but the cashier didn't give us a detailed receipt just a total receipt, so we are not even sure how much we actually did pay for the crab legs.",3.0
Just okay. I probably wouldn't return. Very expensive for small portions and lacked flavor.,3.0
I really want to love this place but I cant. Came here because many people recommended it to me... I wasnt really satisfied or what I expected. My friend got the crab roll I got the lobster we split corn and mac cheese. It all came up to 70 dollars.The crab rolls were very salty first of all and over all I just didnt think it was worth it... We were still hungry after spending 70 dollars..,3.0

When first opened the Alaskan Crab=$25..I had problem paying most times I bought 2 bag taste was Awesome..Now the price Went Up and taste went Down... brought a bag today and it was very oily and taste was very blah... I hope they get their flavor back on point cause I love that little spot..,2.0
"This was an amazing place, I loved the atmosphere and the music in the background. The staff was very friendly and helped us every step of the way. The crab roll was good, a little on the small side. The crab mac n cheese was amazing. It had just the right amount of cheese and just the right amount of noodles. Again, the portion was small, idk if that's because we got it to-go or what. Would definitely eat here again and would recommend to anybody!",4.0
"I. LOVE. The Crabby Shack!!!! My friends and I went and loaded up on a bunch of food. The staff was so polite and attentive! In the hour plus that we spent there, we were checked on no less than 3 times, including by the owner! Amazing food, great staff.",4.0
"I'm a huge fan of shellfish and the food is ridiculously delicious.My boyfriend and I ordered for delivery and their turn around time is pretty average. I'd definitely go for the crab roll and steamed shrimp. Their crab tacos were good, but the rolls are way more worth it. Both the garlic and spicy sauce options were delicious. But if you ask me, spicy for the crab roll and garlic for the shrimp is the way to go.The only downside is that it is a bit pricey, but tbh, what good shell food spot isn't a bit pricey? I'd definitely recommend this place and eat here again. But maybe not regularly just 'cause ya girl's pocket ain't that deep. Maybe when I'm ballin' on 6 hunnit.Let me stop making a fool of myself.TL;DR this place is great, but just a little pricey.",4.0
"Checked out Crabby Shack this weekend and I have to say, their crabs are on point. I was with a big group of people, so we were able to try a bunch of things to get a feel for the menu and everything we had was delicious. It helps that the owners and staff are super friendly. They helped us make our choices and everything they suggested (which was a little of everything for our group) was good - nothing disappointed. Here's a run-down on our picks:1lbs Spicy Shrimp - Definitely one of the highlights of this meal. Share it with your table or horde it for yourself - who cares, just don't miss this one. These are cooked shell-on and the flavor gets all steamed into the shrimp under the shell.Crab Tacos - Corn tortilla with the perfect amount of crab and pickled onions. You get to choose your own sauce for the crabs, so we got one with lemon aioli and the other with chipotle mayo. Both were super tasty, but if I had to pick between them - the chipotle mayo has a really nice smokey flavor that complimented the onions and crab. 1lbs Crab Legs w/ broccoli & potatoes - Listen, all of this came together in a clear plastic bag and it was good. I mean, it was so good I wanted to drink the broth at the bottom of the bag. My friends dipped their crab rolls and leftover crab from the table in it so we wouldn't waste that amazing flavor of butter, crab and Old Bay. The potatoes and broccoli come sitting in the broth with the crab - the potatoes soak up that flavor and it makes them extra delicious. My mouth is watering just thinking about it.Since I don't eat bread, I can't comment on anything else our table had but I'm sure someone from our group will. I do know that everyone raved about their crab rolls and one person even got a second one because she didn't want the meal to be over. Clearly, we'll definitely be back. Extras: Fresh strawberry lemonade was super good - not too sweet, just right. They offer natural sodas and sparkling water and desserts. Prices are great!In the area? You should check it out. Not in the area? You should find yourself in the area just for this (like we did).",5.0
"My friend and I was very excited about the crabby snack!! I met Fifi she was very pleasant... The music was on point wide variety old and new school.   We ordered to stay and go ..loI     I ordered the crab roll with butter garlic which was delicious the crab meat was very tasty! My friend had the crab BLT with avocado she loved it ""suggestion about the bacon "" give options for those that don't eat pork. We also shared the honey cornbread and crab Mac&Cheese it was Amazing with a capital A.... We had spicy tea and Berry juice yummy.  The decor is amazing the restroom is well to do!! Of course we took food to go crab chowder just know I'm crabbed out for today .. I will be returning ... Yes they delivered!!",5.0
"Lapin and I came here on Sunday as we were both craving crab. We ordered two crab tacos which were good. They were packed with crab but they felt like it was missing something.  Lapin said it was because the dressing overpowered the delicate taste of the crab. We also ordered the famous crab roll which was ah-mazing. It was packed with just crab meat...none of that filler stuff  like salad you would get at other places [Sagaponack -- I am looking at you]. And of course, we ordered one pound of  Alaskan Snow crab legs with 2 sides. To be honest, it definitely didn't feel like a pound. And the sides were a bit skimpy. We ordered the corn on the cob (2 pieces) and the potato was just one potato cut up into quarters. I wish they had more seasoning options available like at other crab boil places than just plain Old Bay, which was strong and overpowering on some of the crab legs and other pieces it was bland.  To wash it down, we had hibiscus soda which was pretty interesting. Lapin liked it more than I did.On a side note, apparently this place is BYOB as I saw some customers drinking and the owners didn't say anything. To order [we were a bit confused by this at first], you place your order at the cashier and give your name and then you can pick up your order.

So now either you're a genius or you realized I'm not a regular as I snap shots for your yelp review lol.I ordered two crab rolls.

The crab had no mayo just butter, similar to a Connecticut style lobster roll.It's a cute little ""shack"" in Crown Heights.

Brooklyn is the new it spot and restaurants like The Crabby Shack make it so.Awesome decor (check), good food (check) incredible customer service (check) and the option to eat in or take out (check). Now with such a rave review why only 4stars? When I called in my order I asked if the buns was toasted and I was assured they were. However upon eating my roll the bun was not toasted.

I hated that it was in an aluminum dish. Some of the mac stuck to the sides. Hated that. Over all both dishes we the better then good. And I'd like to work thru the menu.

"Small and causal, but seriously cute!the crabby shack seems to be owned and run by a family.  Everyone resembled one another and they all had a smile on their faces and made each visitor feel welcome.  Some of the patrons were very familiar with the staff, indicating they were regulars (that's always a good thing).  Seafood seasoned so wonderfully, you leave with your mouth still watering.  Everything's full of flavor, but JUST ENOUGH!!! I started with the lobster mac and cheese and crab roll!  Both were a dream. The crab roll was dressed with a garlic butter on the softest potato roll EVER!  The combination was ON POINT! I ordered an Arnold Palmer- it was made fresh and just sweet enough.  They do not serve alcohol and you won't even miss it.  I ended with the peach cobbler, which was the dessert of the day.  The peach cobbler was served warm and each bite was better than the last. My friends ordered the crab legs, seasoned shrimp, potatoes, corn and broccoli.  We are all foodies and all had great things to say.  One friend, commented, I am trying to eat slowly so I can savor the flavors, but its just so good.  I am already planning my return. I wish I lived in the neighborhood, because they deliver and are open for dinner, which would be a nice treat every so often!

"The Crabby Shack is a wonderful experience.   The crab roll is unbelievable and for those who are true crab lovers, the Alaskan crab and spicy shrimp combo will keep you coming back for more.Great atmosphere....great food....great feeling.",5.0
"First off let me start off by saying the crab roll is the best!!! The staff is very friendly and funny. The food has amazing taste but, the crab roll was everything. Give this place a try!!",4.0
Ordered the 1/2 pound of shrimp. Was unreal. The sauce and shrimp were both delicious. Got a side of corn to go along with it which was also fantastic. Very friendly staff and a nice restaurant to sit down in.,5.0
"Good atmosphere for sure, it is what it is but the staff is 'meh' not that friendly - more concerned with putting on make up. The food is good and pretty overpriced (2 small slider is $13) but the annoying thing is that they want to charge you .50 for extra Aioli. Also, my sliders had some manky  lettuce which was gross. Not sure about quality control.",3.0
"Small and causal, but seriously cute!the crabby shack seems to be owned and run by a family.  Everyone resembled one another and they all had a smile on their faces and made each visitor feel welcome.  Some of the patrons were very familiar with the staff, indicating they were regulars (that's always a good thing).  Seafood seasoned so wonderfully, you leave with your mouth still watering.  Everything's full of flavor, but JUST ENOUGH!!! I started with the lobster mac and cheese and crab roll!  Both were a dream. The crab roll was dressed with a garlic butter on the softest potato roll EVER!  The combination was ON POINT! I ordered an Arnold Palmer- it was made fresh and just sweet enough.  They do not serve alcohol and you won't even miss it.  I ended with the peach cobbler, which was the dessert of the day.  The peach cobbler was served warm and each bite was better than the last. My friends ordered the crab legs, seasoned shrimp, potatoes, corn and broccoli.  We are all foodies and all had great things to say.  One friend, commented, I am trying to eat slowly so I can savor the flavors, but its just so good.  I am already planning my return. I wish I lived in the neighborhood, because they deliver and are open for dinner, which would be a nice treat every so often! Prices are reasonably priced!!  If you are hungry and need a casual eat- try it out!",5.0

"This is the cutest place! The nautical theme is tasteful and adds character. The place is Black owned and staffed which personally I love! They also support Brooklyn Sweet Spot, a local dessert spot. If you haven't gone to either one, you are missing out on amazing food! The Crabby Shack has great prices for tasty food. Don't go here if you're counting your calories or carb intake. Most of the food is in sandwich form unless you get a bag of steamed spicy shrimp or crab legs. You have to come here ASAP!!!",5.0

"I looooove the crab roll here! I went to Crabby Shack yesterday after a visit to the Brooklyn flea market. The place is lovely and not very crowded during the day. I ordered the crab roll and it tasted sooo good that made me want to eat another one. But well, only if it was a bit cheaper. The peach cobbler which I took home was delicious too. Not too sweet with lots of peach. Definitely go back here if I have a chance!",5.0
"My husband and I went here this weekend for a late lunch. I had the crab roll, he had the crab BLT with avocado. For our sides, we had the crab mac and cheese and corn on the cob.

I went there about a week ago my lobster roll was so soggy and didn't even have flavor the crab Mac& cheese was alright . but the banana pudding was GREAT the lemonade was watered down& too much ice ..... The pop soda was delicious I won't be in a hurry too go back there,2.0
Coming out of retirement to give this place a review. It's THAT GOOD! My roommates family is in town and we walked over here to check the place out. Crab roll is amazing. crab BLT is dope. Mac and cheese is solid. Corn bread.... OHHHH THE CORN BREAD! Anyways place is legit and the people working here are the best of Brooklyn. Good vibes great music. I'll be back more than once.,5.0
"The customer service leaves a lot to be desired.  I was told that I couldn't get my $3.00 12oz cup lemonade sweetened because they don't want to give the customers diabetes. It seemed funny to me since the crab rolls and macaroni and cheese were greasy and fatty enough to get the customer a heart attack.  That's $30.00 that I'll never get back. You would think that when are spending that much, a little consideration would be a given. It's a shame.",1.0
The best seafood in the neighborhood. The crab roll was full of crab meat not artificial meat at all. It was filling and delicious. I also had the crab Mac and cheese which was real cheesy but not a lot of crab meat. Would be going there again for sure!!!,5.0
"The food is great at this small new spot in Mid-Brooklyn. I went with some friends and we had the Crab Cake Sliders, the regular mac and cheese, lobster mac and cheese, and I had the crab tacos.

Drove all the way from Long Island to try this place. Granted Long Island has many seafood places they seem to be lacking in something. I ordered the crabs in garlic butter and have to tell you it was great. It was meaty and flavorful. The price wasn't to bad either. Of course I had to try the crab roll as well. That too was good. My great grandmother had the spicy shrimp and said it was good as well. No complaints here. I would of liked to sit and enjoy my food there but it is a small space. Cute but it gets crowded. You can tell they have a lot of support from friends and community at their establishment.,4.0

"Only been here twice, but both times have been great. First time was during the winter, and they had crab chowder, which was absolutely unbelievable. We've also had their banana pudding, crab roll, tacos, boiled shrimp, corn bread, broccoli and lemonade. All of it is ABSOLUTELY incredible. The broccoli is even ridiculously tasty. To top it all off, the people who work there are so friendly, upbeat, and have just a really nice warm nature to them. The atmosphere and the way it was designed is also on point.

Crab roll had tons of fresh crab and was served on a warm, buttery, toasted roll. Don't forget to try one of their infused sparkling waters - the elder flower and cucumber/mint ones are delish.

We got 1 Spicy and 2 Garlic.Everything was wonderful. The only thing I could recommend is that if you don't have a crab cracker at home, you'll have to get creative. We used some chopsticks and some old scissors, and it worked fine, but if the shells were pre-cracked it would have been way easier.I have to say I feel obnoxious asking someone to crack shellfish for me, having spent too many years waiting tables, but the crab was so good we needed to have the right instruments to make sure we could eat it all!I also melted some butter and garlic so we could do some dipping since the sauce comes on the crab, so some people might want a side of garlic butter.All and all it was a great choice for a special night of hanging in with friends.",4.0

"I stopped in last night solo to try out this new spot in my neighborhood. The Crabby Shack did not disappoint! It was cute and small, with not a ton of people inside but great music (old school hip hop while I was there). Very chill vibe which is nice in comparison to a lot of the overly packed places on Franklin.I had the crab roll - so good! It was super full of crab meat that was well seasoned and the bun was tasty too! The crab flavored chips were a great side too, and next time I wanna try some of their other side orders!One of the owners (I forget her name) came by to say hi - she was suuuuuper sweet and I was kinda geeked to see business owners in the hood that still have faces like mine :)I'll definitely be a regular there now (my girlfriends have been dying to try it so now I can vouch for them!). Only took off one star because I wish I could have had a beer with my crab roll :)",4.0
"My boyfriend and I went here for lunch today after anxiously awaiting it's opening. They still are in a ""soft opening"" at this point and don't have their full menu, but we split the crab sliders and the Snow crab platter. Both were amazing.The sliders come two to an order with your choice of a lemon sauce or a spicier sauce. As I am a little bit of a wimp when it comes to spicy foods we went with the lemon sauce, they were light flavorful and delicious.The platter is a lb of Alaskan crab legs and is served with broccoli, potatoes and half an ear of corn. It was well seasoned, moist and that paired with the sliders split between the two of us was the exact right amount of food. I am really glad this spot opened up, there is nothing like it in the neighborhood, and if the food is this good already I can't wait to see where they can take it from here. The owners, Fifi and Gwen are warm, inviting and passionate, I'm wishing them the best of luck!Will definitely be back, and I'm bringing everyone. Just be prepared to get your hands dirty.",5.0

Well I must say the food here isn't bad but it also isn't spectacular of your use to good crabs.  I had the crab mc and cheese which was dry and tasted like it sat for a while.  The crab but was ok but was more bread than crab.  Yes the owner was pleasant but I was amazed to have to pay 50 cent a piece for extra sauces in which containers were half full. I wouldn't go here again and I would say I have it 2 stars only because the staff was pleasant.,2.0
"Not having grown up near the water, I can't say I've had many crab rolls before.  But the Crabby Shack version is great food.  Plus I love a restaurant with cool design, and Gwen and Fifi made a beautiful place  out of an old building. This place should be a Franklin Avenue mainstay for years to come.",5.0
"For the price, it was just so so. I was really excited to try this place, and potentially add another restaurant in the hood to our list of go tos. Unfortunately,  the crab BLT with avocado didn't have any avocado,  and the lettuce was beyond wilted. The mac and cheese with crab barely had any crab. The flavor and preparation of the food was fine, but not worth another try. Oh well! I'd actually give it a 2.5 if I could.",2.0
"nice place. Love the interior. However, I ordered the crab roll and I was disappointed. Crab meat on a hot dog bun. Small roll. most of the meat is chopped thinly at the bottom. A few whole pieces on the top. Not worth 12 bucks. This was an appetizer for me, although I bought it for dinner. Next time I'll try the crab cake sliders.",3.0
"I heard so much wonderful things about this place and I didn't fail.  I loved the lobster roll and mac and cheese with lobster.  The pineapple basil lemonade is refreshing.  The decor is bright, clean, and welcoming. I was the first to arrive upon opening and in no time the place was filled with customers.  Great place even down to the rest room- clean!!",5.0
"I stopped in last night solo to try out this new spot in my neighborhood. The Crabby Shack did not disappoint! It was cute and small, with not a ton of people inside but great music (old school hip hop while I was there). Very chill vibe which is nice in comparison to a lot of the overly packed places on Franklin.I had the crab roll - so good! It was super full of crab meat that was well seasoned and the bun was tasty too! The crab flavored chips were a great side too, and next time I wanna try some of their other side orders!One of the owners (I forget her name) came by to say hi - she was suuuuuper sweet and I was kinda geeked to see business owners in the hood that still have faces like mine :)I'll definitely be a regular there now (my girlfriends have been dying to try it so now I can vouch for them!). Only took off one star because I wish I could have had a beer with my crab roll :)",4.0
"My boyfriend and I went here for lunch today after anxiously awaiting it's opening. They still are in a ""soft opening"" at this point and don't have their full menu, but we split the crab sliders and the Snow crab platter. Both were amazing.The sliders come two to an order with your choice of a lemon sauce or a spicier sauce. As I am a little bit of a wimp when it comes to spicy foods we went with the lemon sauce, they were light flavorful and delicious.The platter is a lb of Alaskan crab legs and is served with broccoli, potatoes and half an ear of corn. It was well seasoned, moist and that paired with the sliders split between the two of us was the exact right amount of food. I am really glad this spot opened up, there is nothing like it in the neighborhood, and if the food is this good already I can't wait to see where they can take it from here. The owners, Fifi and Gwen are warm, inviting and passionate, I'm wishing them the best of luck!Will definitely be back, and I'm bringing everyone. Just be prepared to get your hands dirty.",5.0
"I've found that special ""...where everybody knows your name"" neighborhood gem!The Crabby Shack is the new (crustacean) Cheers!Raya is an absolute doll & can literally make your mouth water for every single item on their menu with her descriptions & recommendations.The curry crab roll is hhhmmm hmmmm DELICIOUS! With a daily roll + chips + drink clocking in at a comfortable & affordable $15...I've found a new addiction!Owner Fifi makes it a point to greet patrons as they come in & by the time you try to roll yourself out of the door, you've made a new BFF!Fun, friendly atmosphere with a FABO playlist in the background.BYOB. There's a bevy of all natural drinks to choose from as appropriate chasers for your spirits. Insider tip: Their mint lemonade is excellent paired with vodka!This place is a gem in the Prospect Heights neighborhood.",5.0

You will not be disappointed!!!",5.0
"I really love this place. The owners are so welcoming and it is clear Crabby Shack was a labor of love. It is adorable and even more important, the crab is delicious. Pretty reasonably priced for what you get, too. Obviously fresh high-quality seafood won't be the cheapest, but I think Crabby Shack is a great value if a roll is what you crave (or tacos! or crabcakes!). You can get a meal of a crab roll, chips, and a soda for $15. You pay $18 to get just a lobster roll from Lobster Pound (which is also delicious, but still).",5.0
"We ordered to take out and eat at home... AMAZING! We ordered the Alaskan Crab legs with broccoli and corn, macaroni and cheese with crab, and the 1/2 lb spicy steamed shrimp... everything tasted really, really good.

Had a date night at The Crabby Shack.  We order the crab Mac n Cheese and the crab roll.  Everything was very good and tasty.  The vibe is very laid back with good music.  After a long day from work coming here was just what was needed.  No fuss no frill just straight tasty food with good vibes.,5.0

"Absolutely delicious. Perfect food, seasoning outstanding. The decor was relaxing and reminded me of Nantucket/Martha's Vineyard. My husband who is not a seafood eater loved this place. We ordered the crab roll and steamed spicy shrimp. Devoured it mercilessly. The bun was soft and warm, perfect amount of chunky crabmeat mixed w more delicate minced pieces. Definitely loved the steamed shrimp, Gladys down the street has good spicy shrimp, but it's a bit too oily for my taste and always gives me a tummy acheGo eat here, you must.

I can totally respect a restaurant where the owners are in the kitchen, you know its going to be made with perfection.

But back to the crab roll, it really is just amazing. So amazing that my boyfriend and I had to get another one and split it. Prices are reasonable, service is superb, and it's bring your own beer until they get their liquor liscense. You can't beat that.

The mint iced tea was refreshing!The acoustics in the room made it super loud and hard to hear in there. And I think the tables could be better arranged to maximize seating in the space.

"Just had a fantastic lunch at The Crabby Shack today! My lady and I stopped by during their soft opening for lunch. I hadn't eaten yet and was ready for some serious seafood. After talking with the helpful server we decided to do the King Crab Platter and the Crab Cake Sliders. Both were amazing! Luckily this wasn't our first date, so my girlfriend was un-phased when a claw cracked and went flying in her direction. The seasoning in the crab cakes and on the crab legs were fantastic! We honestly didn't even need butter. Our server had mentioned that there have been people who eat the platter on their own and I may have been able to as well, but with the crab cakes it was very filling. Their drink selection was a bit limited, but it is their soft opening, so I don't hold it against them. I will certainly be looking forward to having a nice beer with a meal there in the future though. As we were eating the staff in the back of house came out to see how everyone was enjoying their meals. They're all incredibly nice and a real pleasure to be around. Bottom line: Great food, great hospitality and a great inclusion to the neighborhood! If you're in Crown Heights and you're getting seafood somewhere else, you're wasting your time!5 stars!

"Tonight I visited this place with my sister after hearing several rave reviews. Well to my dismay, they did not deliver. We placed our order at 7:20pm and at 8:15pm, we inquired about our food. It was at this very moment that the owner realized that our ticket had fallen on the floor and therefore the food staff was unaware of our order. The food was quickly prepared and the owner offered to make it up to us with dessert. I think that I am a pretty reasonable individual however, we spent $35 in this establishment so I expected our meals to be on the house, which didn't happen. Needless to so I will not patronage this business again because wait time is a part of the dining experience and waiting over an hour for my meal is unacceptable. I left feeling really Crabby!!!!",1.0

I didn't have an issue paying $21 for the platter but I felt the lobster rolls were a bit measly for $12. Like it's literally the size of an average hotdog. I would pay 4 bucks more for a more robust sandwich and heartier bread. After nearly $50, I'm still hungry. I also wish they had more spices for the crab. They're new though so maybe that will come. Overall it was decent.",3.0
During a trip to New York we came out to Brooklyn to try the Crabby Shack and we're very glad we did. The crab rolls are incredible and the Mac & Cheese is the best I've ever had! Definitely worth the trip when you're visiting NY.,5.0

"Really cool nautical looking place. Love the feel and vibe of it. Can't go wrong with either the crab blt or 1lbs Alaskan snow platter. Both were so good we ordered it again to take home. The crab tacos are great for kids since it is small yet filling. Would recommend this place to anybody who likes seafood. By the way, prices are incredibly reasonable for seafood in NY.",5.0
"Lucky for me I live in the neighborhood. I love to try new spots and as soon as I saw this spot I decided to try it out the next day. Went with a few friends, I had a crab roll and have been coming back again and again ever since. Great decor, very friendly staff and food tastes wonderful.",5.0
"Tonight I visited this place with my sister after hearing several rave reviews. Well to my dismay, they did not deliver. We placed our order at 7:20pm and at 8:15pm, we inquired about our food. It was at this very moment that the owner realized that our ticket had fallen on the floor and therefore the food staff was unaware of our order. The food was quickly prepared and the owner offered to make it up to us with dessert. I think that I am a pretty reasonable individual however, we spent $35 in this establishment so I expected our meals to be on the house, which didn't happen. Needless to so I will not patronage this business again because wait time is a part of the dining experience and waiting over an hour for my meal is unacceptable. I left feeling really Crabby!!!!",1.0

"Came here after many positive reviews from neighborhood friends and lemme tell ya, they lived up to it.

"Wow! As a seafood lover and a total NY foodie, my whole family loved this place.  The people working there were all hospitable, and the food came fast, and OMG was it good.  We had the crab BLT, the Crab roll, and 2 lbs of crab legs.  I regretted not getting the big crab lovers feast, because we kept ordering more food.

They must be ""Big""Took my ordererd to go .. I got home and and to my surprise !! Tacos were the smallest tortilla you buy at a supermarket and only 1 tortilla with crab meat and some non tasty sauce on it! I normally buy tacos at a mexican restaurant and they at least give you 2 tortillas with meat filling of your choice and salad for only $2.00 a taco.. I was so dissapointed driving 20 minutes to get to this place and getting overcharged.

"I love the ladies who brought the Crabby Shack to Crown Heights! It's like a little taste of home (I'm from Maine) and the food is right on par with that that you would find in a costal New England seafood shack. I had the crab roll and it was exactly what I was hoping for. Just pure crab meat drizzled with homemade garlic butter and piled on a super fresh super soft bun. No fancy add ons, no mayo, totally New England style. And they even had Old Bay for me to top t off with! The atmosphere is just as enticing, it feels so warm and inviting, and the decor is the best of any restaurant that has opened in Crown Heights in the last 5 years! All around job well done ladies! And my roommate and I were so happy one of the owners, Gwen, came out to ask us how our food was! Can't wait to go back and try everything else!!",5.0
What a nice little spot!  We were greeted very warmly as soon as we walked through the door. I had the crab taco and hibiscus tea (small items just in case I didn't like the food).

"This review is mixed. The food at crabby shack ""tastes"" good once you get it in your mouth.   But it wasn't the most pleasant experience getting it there. The ""platter"" is not a platter of food; rather it is a plastic bag full of food all mushed together.  And you have to stick your hand into a plastic bag of hot slop to find your crab. It's a small place, so don't expect a seat at a table if you go during meal time. Eat here if you like crab, but don't order the platter.  They should serve the platter in a more appetizing way.",3.0
"During my experience at the Crabby Shack I felt like I was on a holiday at the beach.You will come out of there with your hands dirty, crab all over your face but with a gigantic smile. I was there with 3 friends and decided to try out most items on the menu. Everything tasted fresh and amazing but if I had to chose the best dish I would go with the shrimps and their amazing sauce. I should also mention the the BLT crab sandwich which was also out of this world. In some other comments I read people complaining about the portions but I cannot think of any other place in NYC where you can have such good quality at such a reasonable price. Yes they could make the crab rolls bigger and charge you ten dollars more for them but they seem to be too honest there to do that. After we finished our meal, one of the owner came and asked for our opinion and she seemed genuinely interested in what we had to say. What a refreshing attitude in the sometime ""know-it-all"" NY culinary scene. Overall, I only have good things to say about this place and I will be back again and again and tell as many friends about it as possible because this place deserves to be known and appreciated by everyone.",5.0

Crabs you want crabs you get. This is a place that practically is a whole in the wall and gives many established so call crab restaurants a run for their customers. The food is very flavorful.
