"Firstly, thanks to idontdoclubs.com for their extensive list of black owned establishments! No matter what walk of life you're from they offer a wide variety of different restaurants which feature different foods so definitely check it out.The food was really good! My friend and I both ordered the granola crusted French which is possibly the best French toast I've had. My friend and I believed it was made with potato bread which gave it a distinct flavor. I also ordered a side of scrambled eggs. Only 4 stars because the food wasn't as warm as we would've like but other than that the food was great.",4.0
"I have been to many many many chicken places while my time here in NYC, and I find that many many of them do fried chicken wrong.  If it is a lack of seasoning, un-crispy crust or just dried out chicken.  HOWEVER, this place does fried chicken justice.   Came here for dinner with my daughter based off reviews and it is easily one of the top 3 fried chicken joints I have been to in NYC  The chicken was fresh and made to order.  Was seasoned perfectly with an awesome crust.  We had the Mac and cheese and collard greens as sides.  And though they were good, they were greatly overshadowed by the main course.  This is a must go if looking for some good ole fashioned southern chicken",5.0
The hot chicken is good but nothing all that special.  I froze my butt off while eating there - that really dampens the experience right?The tables could be cleaner.  Service was okay.  This is really just a diner experience and nothing more.  No need to return.,3.0
"Peaches Hot HouseI've been enjoying the Nashville style hot chicken here for approx the past 2 years and don't plan on stopping anytime soon. Yes the restaurant isn't that large, maybe seating for around 30 the food definitely makes it worth the wait.If you enjoy spicy food then the ""extra hot"" is the way to go. I must confess it's brought tears to my eyes a few times but I always manage to push through. For sides you can't go wrong with the Mac and cheese and/or the collard greens (in which I add some hot sauce for a kick). For drinks the ""sister Rosetta"" is more refreshing than strong but after 2 or 3 during happy hour and you'll be more than happy.",5.0
"Peaches Hothouse serves delicious fried chicken, blackened catfish, Mac & Cheese, and anything else you can think of when you're thinking about a true Southern meal. But what I can tell you is that a real standout is their brunch menu! They have an amazing French Toast with sugar and peaches. Take my advice and order that with a side of fried chicken and a peach mimosa. Best brunch you'll ever have!They also have a great dinner appetizer of Duck Confit and Black Eyed Peas over mesclun with a light vinaigrette. They also have mixed drinks that I absolutely loved: Jack Daniels, Cointreau, and lime juice. Bring a friend and introduce them to Peaches! Overall, great food, great drinks, and a great environment. Enjoy!",4.0
"Hot fried chicken. Yes.Expect to put your name on the board and wait, because it's a small place and there's a high demand for this hot fried chicken.  There's a small store across the street where we bought some drinks to have while we stood outside and waited.We sat at the bar, which was great, as service was fast.  My bf and I each ordered the hot fried chicken because we didn't want to share, but we probably could have shared (it's a generous amount).  I have a very high tolerance for hot/spicy so I went for the ""hot"" and didn't think it was too hot at all; it was just hot enough to give it a kick, but not distract from the chicken itself, which was perfectly cooked, juicy and tender, which just the right amount of skin, and not too greasy. You get your choice of a side, and I went with corn on the cob, which is one of my favorites. There's nothing ""special"" about it here, I found it balanced the chicken well since its somewhat healthy and didn't make me feel too guilty.Not life changing, but very very good.",4.0
"Its always the small spots with the best food.this was just my lucky day. My boo and I was extremely hungry and it was up to me to pick a place. I found this place on yelp and saw the reviews and decided to go with it.The waiters were nice and the food was amazing !!!! I order the  Peach Granola Toast French and Collard Greens . It was the best collard greens I ever tasted. There is nothing like going to a restaurant super hungry and leave super happy.The only thing that stopped it from getting 5 Stars is that I was sitting my door and the cold air was coming in hitting me. Other than that, it was great!xoxoCynthia",4.0
"Got take out here and it was just as fresh as if we dined in. Ordered the hot chicken and it was perfectly crispy, moist, warm, flavorful and satisfying. The pickles were the perfect compliment to the chicken--they cut the spice perfectly. The corn bread was awesome. Of the sides we ordered (got collard greens, mac,bacon potato salad, and mashed potatoes) the mashed potatoes were the best. Need to come back for dessert and hot sandwiches.",4.0
"I'm a regular to Peaches HotHouse and have even met some new friends here (including a woman who runs an exciting new podcast for black women).  But I just had to post a review about their take out.  Because while most takeout doesn't stand up to making it home - especially fried chicken - their is always crispy when I get home and actually HOT (i.e. spicy), the way I order it.The Watermelon Salad with arugula & pickled ginger is a palate cleaning winner, and the full Jim Cade burger with fried green tomatoes has introduced a few skeptics to wonders of the fried green tomato.  Disclaimer: this is best enjoyed on-site, as fried green tomatoes need to be eaten piping hot.  I once ordered butter beans that were not butter beans at all, so beware.  But other than that one snafu, I love Peaches HotHouse.",4.0
"Extremely friendly staff! I love how the employees get along so well with each other and even hang out outside of work. The scenery here is very homey and has warm, Southern food. The drinks here are also made especially strong by the bartender (maybe because it was Halloween)?When you first walk in, you may be surprised about the small space; there is a bar that can seat about 6-10 people and about 4 large tables (can seat about 6-8 on each table). There is a marker-board by the front door, where you can write your name and how many is in your party. There is a small bench to wait inside by the front door (which seats about two people). Outside across the front entrance, there are two long benches where you can wait as well. The music inside can get loud but they have great tunes! They also have a television by the bar but sometimes impossible to hear because of the music (and the television had no subtitles when we were there).I recommend ordering the BBQ shrimp and fried grits and any fried chicken combo (comes with a side of your choice). The macaroni & cheese and corn on the cob were perfect sides! Overall, our dinner was very filling and we gorged on the leftovers later that night. The service here is very professional, friendly and fast. We will definitely return here again!",4.0
"So I came here yesterday for the first time and ordered the HOT fried chicken. It was hot and spicy just the way I like it. I also had the fried grits which was kind of bland, but once I put a little salt and pepper it was perfect. I can't wait to return to try their sides like the bacon potato salad and the collards greens which I heard is delish.",4.0
"I ordered the regular hot chicken since spicy food is not my thing while my friend ordered the extra hot chicken. Thinking it wasn't going to be that terrible, he gives me a little piece of skin, the tiniest sliver of skin. The reaction to the heat was immediate. I couldn't feel my lips or the inside of my mouth, I started seeing stars and my friend quickly ordered me a small cup of milk. The waiter was very gracious and asked if I ate a piece of the extra hot chicken while I nodded painfully with tears in my eyes. Overall, if you really like spicy fried chicken, go for the extra hot. Or you can be like me and get the regular or hot chicken and still enjoy deliciously juicy and flavorful fried chicken. Either way, the chicken is divine. The wait time was almost an hour since the space is very small, but it was cozy. The service was fantastic also!",4.0

"Ok.  I am a Tennessee gal so I rarely approve of soul food style establishments.  But I approve.  That said, after a childhood stuffed with pulled pork and fried chicken, I'm on the vegetarian tip these days, and I'd have more luck in an actual eatery in Tennessee.  We're southern, not Neanderthal.  For a while that mushroom grits business did me right, but that's been gone a while, and now I'm stuck with piecemealing a few sides to make a sort of meal.The ambiance works.  Expect to wait and then be crowded into your table.  Servers could be friendlier, but southern hospitality isn't as easily imported as hot sauce - so I expect the Brooklyn server hustle.Miz Peaches, throw a couple more veggie-friendly dishes on that menu of yours, and you'll be five stars all the way.",4.0

"Oh peaches peaches peaches!Such good food, such good drinks, and such good pricing! I came here today at the recommendation of my friend. She's a yelper too and wanted to stay in Brooklyn for our outing. Peaches is one of the ""black owned businesses"" on the list that was sent to me by a couple of friends so I was excited to come see what it was all about. Not to mention the stellar reviews and mouthwatering pictures peaches has on yelp. We found parking and walked in to a friendly greeter who asked us to write our names on the list. It looked as if there were three or four parties ahead of us but when she called their names out onto the street and no one appeared she told us we wouldn't have to wait and there were two seats available for us right in the corner. God was on our side because we were so hungry we were ready to eat our fingers. We were seated in a tight tiny corner and were greeted by an attentive and cute waiter who asked if we had any questions about the menu. He informed us that happy hour was until seven and all the drinks were $5. I had seen the Ma Rainey drink pictures on yelp and knew for a fact that I had to have one. My friend and I both ordered the hot chicken for $13 and each got a side of macaroni and cheese for four dollars both of which were to die for!! The chicken was well cooked and not too spicy and the macaroni and cheese was some of the best I've ever had. My friend agreed. The service was great and the food was awesome I will definitely be coming back here to sample some more of the great variety they have on the menu! This place really is a gem!",4.0
"Peaches HotHouse has been on my bookmarks of places to try for over a year now and I finally got the opportunity to get here and see what the rave was all about but somehow I missed the fact that they were a very tiny and for me uncomfortable establishment.Peaches is in fact a hothouse in that it is tiny and cramped and definitely not my thing so I'm not coming back to dine in here but as for the food it was everything I expected and I will do take out here only.To further sully things we had a not so eager to serve, laid back and lazy server by the name of Silvana who seated us, gave us menus, we got our food and expressed interest to our server that we would like to order from the appetizers menu as well but we were never asked or looked upon again until we stopped her and inquired about drinks and additional napkins. When I asked Silvana about their drinks menu and what she would recommend she simply said "" You have the menu, take a look at it""! No quick rundown on what's popular, no question on what I might like, Just look at the menu!OK... this was a sticking point for me as her attitude came across as disinterested and lackadaisical.We had a look at the drinks menu and waited, and waited, and watched Silvana walk by us several times, never, ever again to stop and ask if we had a chance to look at the menu and or if we were interested in ordering anything. Just complete and utter nothingness!!This affected my dining experience in a very negative way as no one wants to be treated like that and I certainly didn't appreciate it!Both my friend and I decided that we would flag down someone else and inquire about drinks and the like and a very nice gentleman came along and was happy to explain drinks and give recommendations and this I appreciate and what I was hoping our server would do. I also let the gentleman know of our experience with Lazy Silvana who is certainly going to ruin this place business if she isn't dealt with quick. We got our drinks and perhaps someone mentioned something to her because the next time she came our way I looked up and she gave us an ice cold stare with her lips pursed and her eyes winced and in a glower looking straight at me and this was incredulous to say the least. At this point I decided that I no longer wanted her to service our table and I let the other server know this! Of course they couldn't see the look on her face that she gave me and neither was I going to waste my time at this point saying so but just make sure she doesn't come back here and I left it at that and wont be back.Now on to the food as you can see from my very lengthy review the food was no longer on my palate of good things since a single shitty server impacted what could have been a much better dining experience and review.Both my friend and I got the Hot chicken mine was the hot, my friend the regular and yep the chicken is banging, its got great crunch, spice, flavor and still moist and juicy on the inside!Our Grits were creamy goodness and the drinks not bad at all!Final Thoughts...I don't do tiny, cramped, back to back seating places well, the food was damn good and I will do take out here and that's only if I'm in the area and in the mood for it! The fact that we drove out of our way to come here with such high hopes and have our dining experience trampled on by a careless server doesn't sit well with me at all!Silvana needs to take a customer service class and or this place needs to hand her a laid off slip so she understands that they're in the business of customer satisfaction throughout the meal and service and this matters otherwise your bottom dollar is on the line if this becomes a repeat experience for your other customers!Catch you on the check-in and take out here.",3.0

The chicken is tender, moist, and cooked to perfection. The skin is thin, crispy, and covered in that magical concoction of spices. Use the bbq sauce on the table - it's absolutely delicious and great for coating pieces of chicken for a cool down. The restaurant is packed at all hours, but well worth the wait.

But anyway,  peaches is the best place I've been to for the stuff.I usually get the regular and hot chicken.  The chicken is done well, very juicy and the meat to skin and batter ratio is very well,  as you are not paying for just skin and batter. You really get your money's worth....i usually get the regular and hot chicken,  why not the extra hot chicken you ask ? Because it is f***ING hot ! I myself are very much into spicy food, as I'm from the carribean, but I must admit the extra hot chicken has me crying. The meatloaf here is superb also, soft and flavorful, the shrimp is juicy. I have to say also,  the sides ! The mashes potatoes are immaculate with southern gravy even better, even the broccoli is delicious with a taste that's so unique. The drinks here are also done very well.Why 4 stars ? The brunch did not impress me too much. I had a egg, pepper, raab, and  andoule sausage scramble which was good, but the grits that came with it I didn't care too much for.  In fact the grits were not done well. All in all for soul food this place is top notch, quality,  tasty food that will have you coming back for more.",4.0
"Finally tried peaches! Yay!! The wait was so devastating, but the food made up for it! Crispy, spicy southern goodness! So I ordered the extra spicy chicken.

I was a bit disappointed that we weren't able to try the Mac and cheese because it's only made in the evenings :(. So I just had the fries.

But anyway,  peaches is the best place I've been to for the stuff.I usually get the regular and hot chicken.  The chicken is done well, very juicy and the meat to skin and batter ratio is very well,  as you are not paying for just skin and batter. You really get your money's worth....i usually get the regular and hot chicken,  why not the extra hot chicken you ask ? Because it is f***ING hot ! I myself are very much into spicy food, as I'm from the carribean, but I must admit the extra hot chicken has me crying. The meatloaf here is superb also, soft and flavorful, the shrimp is juicy. I have to say also,  the sides ! The mashes potatoes are immaculate with southern gravy even better, even the broccoli is delicious with a taste that's so unique. The drinks here are also done very well.Why 4 stars ? The brunch did not impress me too much. I had a egg, pepper, raab, and  andoule sausage scramble which was good, but the grits that came with it I didn't care too much for.  In fact the grits were not done well. All in all for soul food this place is top notch, quality,  tasty food that will have you coming back for more.",4.0
"Finally tried peaches! Yay!! The wait was so devastating, but the food made up for it! Crispy, spicy southern goodness! So I ordered the extra spicy chicken. It wasn't too spicy, but had a kick to it. Perhaps one of the best southern fried chicken spots in NY so far. My husband had the spicy chicken which was also good. I was a bit disappointed that we weren't able to try the Mac and cheese because it's only made in the evenings :(. So I just had the fries. Small place, so if you plan on coming, make sure you're prepared for the wait. But trust me, it will be worth it! Crispy spicy goodness will satisfy your southern craving!",4.0
"One Sunday afternoon I traveled out to bedstuy at the request of a friend seeking brunch. Peaches was suggested but by the time I got to the area Peaches was closing before reopening for dinner. So we decided to go over to Peaches Hothouse. We walk into the restaurant and stand in front for a minute or so and was not greeted by the host or a bartender, waitress or anyone. So I'm confused now, do I just sit at any table, is someone going to come over, is it self service. I walk further into the middle of the small restaurant and look around and stand some more. The bartender finally looks over and asks if we want to sit at the bar or we'll have to wait for a table. I move my feet over one step to the side and turn my body and point to the table that's right behind me and ask if we can just sit there. He said okay; guess he wasn't aware of the open space :/Once seated we wait for a little while for a menu and we order. Got catfish nuggets to start. I got the hothouse chicken, spicy. The chicken was barely spicy.  My friend got the catfish. We both felt our meals were just okay. Nothing to write home about.",3.0

I had some sort of gin and sweet tea drink that was pretty good. My verdict on the chicken?

As you squeeze into the seats, you get a menu with food on one side and cocktails without any prices on the other. The Hot Chicken ($13) comes in Regular, Hot, or Extra Hot and one additional side. I got the Hot with Butterbeans and Ham Hocks side. It arrived in a platter of three pieces of chicken on toast with three butter pickles, a side of corn bread and a bowl of the beans.

If you ask for Regular - no cayenne pepper........... If you ask for HOT.... some cayenne pepper sprinkled on it............. If you ask for Extra Hot...... a lot of cayenne pepper sprinkled on your chicken...Now to my observation - the cayenne pepper is sprinkled after the chicken is Fried - and the fact that it is on top of the chicken skin - you best believe that it is HOT (HOT or EXTRA HOT make sure you love spicy food before trying)Other than that - it is nothing to DIE for.............. but I would visit again when I am in the mood....,3.0

"I'd bookmarked Peaches Hothouse on a semi-whim after hearing about the authenticity and unabashed spiciness of their fried chicken. Unlike most other fried chicken locations in the city, Peaches specializes in Nashville Hot Chicken, a now-iconic dish that has its roots in an eatery known as Prince's Hot Chicken. For those of us who can't make the trip south, however, Peaches is thankfully just a subway ride away in Bedford-Stuyvesant.Even at first glance, Peaches Hothouse is clearly a neighborhood spot, a place for the locals to grab a quick meal as well as place takeout orders. The interior is pretty barebones, with the necessary rows of tightly packed tables, bright lighting, and a small counter area. While it wasn't too busy on the weekday evening that we went, there is a whiteboard by the entrance for guests to write their name down in case a wait is inevitable.But let's cut to the chase: it's the chicken you're here for, after all. While peaches does offer a number of other proteins and sandwiches, their Hot Chicken plate is proudly showcased in red font in the center of the menu. Guests can opt for one of three spice levels and also pick a side to accompany the order. I, of course, went with the Extra Hot, which includes a wing, a drumstick, and a thigh served on a slice white bread with a portion of cornbread and pickles on the side. It didn't appear to be too fiery, so I dug in with gusto. The chicken is clearly fried to order - the skin is crisp and hot, the underlying white meat still tender and juicy - and the seasoning, an aggressive mix consisting of cayenne, paprika, hot sauce, and a hint of garlic.... About that seasoning, though. While I was all right after the first few bites, it wasn't until I started on the second piece that I realized just how spicy it was. My dining companion can certainly verify that my face did turn red - quite a feat for someone whose palate is used to a regular dosage of Sichuan food. The spice level is certainly not a joke, and I would advise anyone who is less than confident in their tolerance to opt for the ""Regular"" or ""Hot"" levels instead. Thankfully, the sides we ordered, a sublime Mac & Cheese and a velvety order of Creamy Grits, helped considerably. (I wasn't a fan of the Collard Greens, however.) By the time I reached the third and final piece, I was able to regain most of my composure.For those seeking a different take on the typical fried chicken or those simply looking to test their spice tolerance, Peaches is certainly the place for you. The food is tasty, the prices more than reasonable, and at the very least, it will make for an unforgettable meal... although your stomach might not be quite as delighted as your taste buds.",4.0
"The fried chicken at Peaches is so good, that eating it is akin to a religious experience.  For starters, when we first arrived we were warmly greeted by the super nice staff. Then we were taught about the different levels of ""hot""That the chicken can come in.  I went for the mildest, and used hot sauce on the side. My friend opted for the medium. (To me, that was still pretty hot!)  The thing is they can cook it according to what you want, but no matter if you're a wimp when it comes to spices (like me) or if you're down for fiery hot, peaches has the chicken for you.  Peaches has all the chicken.  It's so good, that My plan is to visit so frequently that the people who work there to start to get sick of me.  They have other items on the menu, that I'm certain must be just as fabulous and I plan on finding out for myself. As for you reading this right now....  Go. Now. Seriously. Enjoy!",5.0
"Delicious! This was the second time I went to Peaches, the first time was during brunch and I don't remember being wow'd but I do remember the chicken tasting good but being a little too spicy for me.This time I ordered the regular chicken with collards and bacon potato salad. Soooo good. The cornbread tastes like cake and wasn't dry. The collards were great and flavorful and not overpowering or bitter. The bacon potato salad was a different but appreciated taste. And the chicken! The regular chicken dinner came with 3 pieces mixed white and dark, breasts and thighs, both juicy. To top it off I had their house hot sauce  (suppppper good). I love hot sauce and this was kicking --hot but not too hot for my American tastes. To drink I had the Billie Holiday which was great, I'm a fan of anything with elderflower/st.germain, that with Hendricks rose infused gin and grapefruit made the drink light tasting but strong. Came with a party of 7 on a Thursday night and had to wait like an hour--well worth it!Only complaint is my drink took forever to come because they had to get more gin. But the server apologized and it was cool.With Peaches you have to find what level of spice is right for you, but once you do you'll love it!",5.0
"Beware! The HOT chicken is definitely very HOT. I underestimated the heat this chicken packed and thought I could handle it, boy was I wrong. I can only imagine what the extra hot tastes like. However, even knowing this I would most definitely get it again. The chicken itself was very juicy and delicious. They have sweet tea which is a plus for me! We split the catfish appetizer very yummy. For sides I had the corn on the cob, and bacon potato salad. The potato salad was a very good compliment to the hot chicken. My friend had the collard greens (very yummy) and the fried grits which I thought were a little bland but I don't really like grits to begin with. The space is very tight so if you want to have an intimate conversation this might not be the place. Our waiter was very friendly and very attentive of us.

Then we were taught about the different levels of ""hot""That the chicken can come in.  I went for the mildest, and used hot sauce on the side. My friend opted for the medium. (To me, that was still pretty hot!)  The thing is they can cook it according to what you want, but no matter if you're a wimp when it comes to spices (like me) or if you're down for fiery hot, peaches has the chicken for you.  Peaches has all the chicken.  It's so good, that My plan is to visit so frequently that the people who work there to start to get sick of me.  They have other items on the menu, that I'm certain must be just as fabulous and I plan on finding out for myself. As for you reading this right now....  Go. Now. Seriously. Enjoy!",5.0
"Delicious! This was the second time I went to Peaches, the first time was during brunch and I don't remember being wow'd but I do remember the chicken tasting good but being a little too spicy for me.This time I ordered the regular chicken with collards and bacon potato salad. Soooo good. The cornbread tastes like cake and wasn't dry. The collards were great and flavorful and not overpowering or bitter. The bacon potato salad was a different but appreciated taste. And the chicken! The regular chicken dinner came with 3 pieces mixed white and dark, breasts and thighs, both juicy. To top it off I had their house hot sauce  (suppppper good). I love hot sauce and this was kicking --hot but not too hot for my American tastes. To drink I had the Billie Holiday which was great, I'm a fan of anything with elderflower/st.germain, that with Hendricks rose infused gin and grapefruit made the drink light tasting but strong. Came with a party of 7 on a Thursday night and had to wait like an hour--well worth it!Only complaint is my drink took forever to come because they had to get more gin. But the server apologized and it was cool.With Peaches you have to find what level of spice is right for you, but once you do you'll love it!",5.0
"Beware! The HOT chicken is definitely very HOT. I underestimated the heat this chicken packed and thought I could handle it, boy was I wrong. I can only imagine what the extra hot tastes like. However, even knowing this I would most definitely get it again. The chicken itself was very juicy and delicious. They have sweet tea which is a plus for me! We split the catfish appetizer very yummy. For sides I had the corn on the cob, and bacon potato salad. The potato salad was a very good compliment to the hot chicken. My friend had the collard greens (very yummy) and the fried grits which I thought were a little bland but I don't really like grits to begin with. The space is very tight so if you want to have an intimate conversation this might not be the place. Our waiter was very friendly and very attentive of us. Definitely coming back here and will probably just get the regular chicken and adding a little hot sauce to it (to be safe!).",4.0

"After being here a few times over the years, I still give this place 3 stars. Before, it was more of a ""minus 2 stars"" place but now it's a ""you earned 3 stars!"" place. I have never faced the long waits as I come usually around very early dinner or off hours. Well, at least after my first visit. This is what I would suggest if you live nearby. If required to face the wait again, this would drop back down to a ""you lost TWO stars"" kind of place. Space is still tiny, still sometimes frigid. It's almost too tiny for even a hostess station so I don't know what they could do. A very proactive bartender? Seat yourself sign? But yes, I still dislike the awkward entry/seating situation echoed throughout other reviews. The servers have always been friendly. My food suggestion remains the same of the appetizers and fried chicken. I love the drinks but here and there the alcohol content is either too strong or too weak. This happens here and there at most places I venture to so I'm not disappointed. I suggest coming for booze and chicken then people watch. I feel like the folks in front of the corner store watch you eat anyways so may as well see their happenings. Also, there's an idyllic garden (Garden of Hope) 1.5 blocks over btwn. Throop & Marcus Garvey. Take a short stroll and have your intimate conversations and gathering there after eating. It will create a 4-star experience.",3.0
"I had to give it 3 stars due to the long ridiculous long wait. Got there at6:40 and did my sit down till 7:45.. The fried grits with shrimp were great. The catfish fritters could of been crispier.. Fried sausage were great, crispy and mustard sauce was good. The meatloaf was great, tasty and white gravy on top. The pork chop was juicy and moist .

"Service - Good! Feels like a family-owned business. Food- Must try the fried chicken. Collard greens were too sour for my liking. Fried grits were perfectly crispy and great with the sauce, but bland by itself. I've definitely had better beans. Theirs were a little too hard and I think I expected them to be richer with more flavors. The bacon potato salad was also good. Also got the peaches french toast, but they forgot the peaches in our takeout order :/ but even without them, they were delicious! Restaurant - very small. Probably seats about 20.

"So, full disclosure, I hate New York but have to come here for work occasionally.  Not a local, it's always challenging to find something authentic.  I wasn't expecting much but Googled for fried chicken to eat, and all the ""good"" fired chicken places were really far from where I was staying.  This place was was still 30 mins but well worth it.  Small place, has almost as much seating at the bar as tables.  They specialize in Nashville Hot Chicken, but I ordered regular fried. Took about 15 mins but was really good.  Crust was flavorful with a real good crunch but not greasy or too thick to overwhelm.  Chicken breast was perfectly juicy and the thigh had extra crust.  Had a corn on the cob for a side that was cooked well but could have used a little butter.  Topped off with some nice sweet corn bread.  Really couldn't have hoped for better. A decent amount of food for a great price.  This place should def be on the NYC top 10 for fried chicken.",5.0

"Tiny and cramped space but the food here makes up for it! It's got big, bold flavor with a southern twist! Get here early on the weekends if you don't want to wait outside in the cold.

The grits were good they were these small breaded squares filled with warm grits served over southern BBQ sauce, it was delicious but the shrimps felt over cooked and we're definitely frozen, next time I would skip these and just get the grits.We also ordered the corn pancakes, (these were delicious and had real corn pieces cooked right into it!) Get them! The veggie omelette was fresh and the veggies were crisp and cooked well... I got the peach crusted French toast and it was very good! My mouth was happy! The bathroom was also very cool, clean and decorated with a farm motif.

"I will just be reiterating what everyone else said about the hot chicken - it is SO good (and I'm weird/picky when it comes to chicken). The skin was crispy/flavorful AND the meat was super moist.Me and my sister A both opted for the hot chicken, regular (not spicy) with a side of crispy grits for brunch. The crispy grits are cheesy grits that are fried in cubes and served with a tomato sauce on the side - AMAZING. Her husband R did the North Carolina-style BBQ pork egg scramble and devoured it, so you know it was good. He had a side of creamy grits, which were also yummy and sprinkled with spring onion. Yum!Beyond that, we had coffees all around. The nephew O got scrambled eggs and bacon with toast - perfect for a five year old. I didn't try it but apparently their bacon is also really delicious!One small thing was that, after our food arrived, we didn't see our server again till WELL after we were ready to pay. This meant no coffee refills (which we all could've desperately used) and no extra napkins. Since we got there when they had just opened, it wasn't even like it was super busy.

"You know that the food is very good when the conversation stops.... or, it's very spicy.... (or both)I realized this a few years back while seated at Peaches Hothouse with a few OG yelpers, and one of our friends, otherwise an entertaining  conversationalist, just stopped talking. He had ordered the extra hot fried chicken, and while the pain wasn't enough to get him to start hallucinating, it did shut down one end. (Somewhat ironic, taking in the full picture...). Now, I used to be braver (and younger) then and so I had the audacity to ask for some hot sauce on the side as well, much to the amusement of our waitress. Bravado aside, memory suppression would likely explain why my next visit to the Hothouse took another few years...While I've been more regular since, and Peaches Hothouse shows no sign of slacking when it comes to the volume of customers they bring into Bed Stuy, it's pretty clear that there's been a (marginal) decline in quality as the (co)owners have focused more on other restaurants that the B+C Restaurant group has since launched. I don't know what's changed in the cooking, but lately all the heat (from Cayenne Pepper) is coated on the skin, and once you've eaten the skin, the chicken inside, while moist, shows no hint of fire. I know this wasn't the case earlier.Hothouse serves a full menu (though I wish they had biscuits), at brunch and dinner, but it would be pointless if you were to come here and not eat the fried chicken. In one of my recent visits, I sat next to a father as he tried to cajole his daughter into trying some fried chicken - but, she resisted all his entreaties. Kids, these days...I have tried the desserts, and don't believe they serve much purpose other than re-acquainting you with your lips and liberating them from their numb state. I can't say much for the ambience. Peaches Hothouse is certainly not a date place for the crowd that is no longer shopping at Forever 21. The best case scenario is that you'll stop talking after a few bites of that extra hot chicken. In the worse case: you might end up crying in front of your date... not to mention it wouldn't be advisable to take her home and have her listen to a medley of the Berlin Philharmonic and an A cappella soloist the next morning.While Peaches is not in the same league as Prince's Hot Chicken, or Hattie B's... it will save you the trip to Nashville, and is your best bet till another hot chicken place opens up in the city (3.5 stars)",4.0
"I often eat fried chicken, but after this meal I wanted to eat it more often. Very tasty. I got the middle hotness of fried chicken, and creamy grits.

"I was a regular at Peaches HotHouse when I lived just a couple blocks away.  It was the first place I came (based on the good ol' Yelp ""nearby"" function on the app) after moving into the neighborhood, and I came back every couple weeks thereafter.  I returned last week just to make sure it was as good as I remembered.  Short answer:  good lord yes it is.Long answer:  I love this hot chicken.  An order usually gives you a breast, a thigh, and a wing or drumstick.  For fried chicken, it is not greasy whatsoever, and the meat stays extremely moist while the skin is hypercrunchy.  The level of heat isn't always consistent (""hot"" can be mild one day and blow-your-doors-off hot the next) but it almost doesn't matter.  It is addictive in the way the best Szechuan dishes are--at some point the spice becomes exhilarating and begins to taste almost sweet or fruity, and lose sight of the fact that your nose is running a little and your vision is slightly blurry.  The sides are on point as well.  The kale is vinegary and a little spicy, and the potato salad and the mashed potatoes are both good foils for the hot chicken.  The chicken comes with a block of their delicious, vanilla-y cornbread.  (side note:  the burgers aren't bad either.)Kelso Nut Brown is an excellent palate refresher for the spice, but the cocktails here are really good as well.  I'm partial to the Lightning Hopkins (mostly because you get a whole bunch of whiskey-soaked blueberries at the end).  Service is a bit perfunctory, and the wait can be tough since you have to be within earshot (no text system) and there isn't really anything nearby to wait in.  But it's worth it, promise.  Alternatively, take the chicken to go--they'll usually have it ready for you in 15 minutes.I'll try Prince's in Nashville someday, I hope.  Until then, this and Purbird (and El Pollo Rico in Arlington VA) are the centers of my chicken universe.",5.0
"So I'm writing as I eat... Or rather as I drink for right now. ( see pictures)Well I tried typing and eating but that's didn't work out so well, a next day review will have to do.

One inconsistency I found was that both of the people I was with got the same drink and one was a lot strong then the other. Between the three of us we had the Hot chicken, mac&cheese, green, fried shrimp and potato salad. Not one single complaint. Very good cooking.

"There's a #wait, but good #Hot Chicken. I only got #Hot. Probably the right amount of heat, but now I wonder what #Extra Hot is like.Moist chicken, not #too greasy. I didn't need to add salt or hot sauce. Good flavor. Good #beer selection.",5.0
"I practically live here! This is such a BedStuy gem.Sebastian was our server today & he was amazing. Really personable and he helped my friend go through the menu (she was a newbie). He even sent my cornbread back to the kitchen because it didn't look good to him. He definitely cares about the appearance of dishes. As a fellow server, it was definitely an experience I try to give all of my guests.I had the Jim Cade entree (crusted French toast, eggs, grits, & turkey sausage) & for somebody that despises French toast, that's probably the one dish I get regularly. My friend had the Po'Boy sandwich & it was gone in like 2 minutes. For drinks I had the Brooklyn Girl (duhh) & then I had it again. I'm just a sucker for any restaurant that includes honey jack in their signature cocktails.Overall, great great great place. Definitely stop in for brunch on the weekends or beat the crowd & do their everyday brunch during the week!",5.0
"I thought I came here years ago but it was the other location LOL. Woops...anyway, I came here after work with my boyfriend and passed it because it was so tiny and dimly lit to the point where we couldn't even see the restaurant. It was a packed house but luckily we were able to grab some seats in a nice little corner in front of the window. This place is so cozy; the music was chill, the wooden tables are pretty, and the crowd seemed like folks from the neighborhood. It was very loud but hey, what do you expect in Bed Stuy at 6 pm in a soul food joint? Didn't bother me at all but my boyfriend was a little annoyed. I ordered the Blackened Catfish with jalapeno sauce on the side (I forget the name) and mashed potatoes. To be honest I was not familiar with the cuisine so I had to ask the waitress and she was very kind. The food was nicely portioned and my mashed potatoes were creamy. There was also a very tall glass of water at the table to refill the glasses which was perfect because I get thirsty every five seconds LOL. All in all good times, good vibes.",5.0
"I was introduced to this restaurant when it turned up on a list of places for my group to eat during our culinary weekend in NYC. Well the group didn't make it cause it was planned after a long day of eating and PARTAYING (and needless to say they were still asleep when we were scheduled to attend). My body did not get the memo though and I woke up bright and early still. So after looking at the website split into several small groups. I think 4 (maybe 6) is the largest group I would suggest if you want to sit all together. and noticing their Food Network feature and more importantly the menu, I decided to go anyway. I am so glad I did. When I arrived the restaurant was on a short wait for groups but being by myself, I was able to snag a seat at the bar right away. The restaurant is small so I don't know how our group would have fit anyway. We definitely would have had to be I ordered the shrimp and grits (which is on the appetizer menu) with creamy grits instead of grit cakes. Because I also wanted something sweet (and quite honestly am a bit of a fat ass), I also ordered the French Toast with peaches. These two items could not have been a better combination. This hit the spot AND the crevice behind the spot !!!  The shrimp was NOLA style BBQ shrimp. It was saucy and served as a gravy on my grits. The flavor was good, as little sweet but good. So I am always hesitant to order French toast because I am not a fan of eggs so with the usual prep at most restaurants, they are cooked on the exterior of the toast due to the use of an egg wash. These were not like that. The toast was coated with corn flakes and if egg was in the batter or coating it was not obvious. The French toast just the sweetness that I wanted with addition of the peach topping.  The peach topping taste like the inside of a peach cobbler (which just happens to be my favorite dessert). This is my favorite version of French toast by far. I loved this place. If I lived in Brooklyn, I would definitely be a regular here. I will without a doubt come back here again on my next trip to Brooklyn. I did not try the fried chicken which was featured on Food Network but next time I might have to because those who ordered it threw down and really seemed to enjoy it.",5.0
"Completely out of the way if you don't live in the neighborhood- which we don't.Also, unluckily for us, the subway line was closed and we had to take a bus and then walk abt 15 mins.

"You know that the food is very good when the conversation stops.... or, it's very spicy.... (or both)I realized this a few years back while seated at Peaches Hothouse with a few OG yelpers, and one of our friends, otherwise an entertaining  conversationalist, just stopped talking. He had ordered the extra hot fried chicken, and while the pain wasn't enough to get him to start hallucinating, it did shut down one end. (Somewhat ironic, taking in the full picture...). Now, I used to be braver (and younger) then and so I had the audacity to ask for some hot sauce on the side as well, much to the amusement of our waitress. Bravado aside, memory suppression would likely explain why my next visit to the Hothouse took another few years...While I've been more regular since, and Peaches Hothouse shows no sign of slacking when it comes to the volume of customers they bring into Bed Stuy, it's pretty clear that there's been a (marginal) decline in quality as the (co)owners have focused more on other restaurants that the B+C Restaurant group has since launched. I don't know what's changed in the cooking, but lately all the heat (from Cayenne Pepper) is coated on the skin, and once you've eaten the skin, the chicken inside, while moist, shows no hint of fire. I know this wasn't the case earlier.Hothouse serves a full menu (though I wish they had biscuits), at brunch and dinner, but it would be pointless if you were to come here and not eat the fried chicken. In one of my recent visits, I sat next to a father as he tried to cajole his daughter into trying some fried chicken - but, she resisted all his entreaties. Kids, these days...I have tried the desserts, and don't believe they serve much purpose other than re-acquainting you with your lips and liberating them from their numb state. I can't say much for the ambience. Peaches Hothouse is certainly not a date place for the crowd that is no longer shopping at Forever 21.

The first thing I noticed was all my chicken pieces looked like thighs. I believe one piece in there may have been a wing. It was highly breaded and the chicken inside didn't have much flavor. That's when I asked for BBQ sauce.     We asked a couple next to us if they come frequently. They said yes, but the guy claimed that it has been an off night because the flavor is off. I surely agreed haha!     *** I ""may"" try it again but not any time soon. You should give it a try and let me know what you think! ***",3.0
"Yo. There have been times when I did not enjoy my carry out experiences when ordering from Peaches. Spending time dining in house have been mixed but positive overall. Great food but not always the absolute best service. Tonight, Peaches won me as a real big supporter. Tonight the staff flexed and turned up for me in an honest way. My girlfriend and I took seats at the bar and a guy who had been sitting took standing room next to my girlfriend's chair talking to another woman nearby. His elbow was sticking into my girlfriend's back and she asked him to give space and he dismissed her saying ""it's going to be tight"". We would have been more permissible if he asked us to scoot or move over a bit. He was out of his mind angry when my girlfriend finally moved over her chair after he continued to lean into her. Peaches does not have standing room bar space. So when he got aggressive, we confronted him saying No, Stop It. He and I stood flexing chests  while I told him to keep cool and give us our space. He was not nice and very rude. I asked to bartender to figure things out and the bar tender responded to our needs and told him to calm down. The owner, Rodney, backed us up and we enjoyed the rest of the night with a few special moments. Overall, thank you bartender Meek and Rodney.",5.0

I heard good words about the fried chicken at this place, but when I had them, it wasn't worth the wait, at all.

To make this review simple..I'll put it to you this way...it's very good...just not greatWe started with the BBQ shrimp which was just ok...more like boiled shrimp in bbq sauce than bbq shrimp The fried chicken (which is what we went for) wasn't bad...it just wasn't that memorable eitherNow the sides...on the other hand...(collard greens and creamy bean) were delicious Im not saying dont go...just not sure what all the fuss is about,3.0
"When my mother visited NYC for the first time, she really wanted to go to Peaches! When we arrived she was tired and hungry after a big day. We were waiting for over an hour, and she was a little anxious and was bit short with the staff. I explained to her that it how it goes sometimes, and she was ok. However, I guess the damage was done because I cannot recall a time receiving service as bad as this.The waitress didn't even say hello, only ""Alright, what do you want? And you? And you? Is that it?""Well, actually, we would like drinks. She said, ""Ok?"" And just waited.In fact, we would have enjoyed several beers/ cocktails each (and tipped well on them) had the waitstaff asked even once during the meal. But mostly out water remained empty. And the staff basically ignored us.The food was superb, we all agreed. But without exaggeration, this is the worst service my father can recall receiving. What a disappointment. I am quite unhappy.I am willing revisit this if someone in management will simply apologize to my mother for such unprofessional service.",2.0

"Came here on a Friday for dinner after having a few drinks, but don't think you need to be drunk to enjoy the food here.  The fried chicken was great!  So good, that my friend and I got it on a burger and on it's own, and there still wasn't enough chicken.  We also managed to come in time for happy hour.  $5 drinks while you wait for a table is something anyone can get behind.When we were seated, after a fairly short wait considering there was a large birthday party present int he small space, the service was fast and courteous.  We knew what we wanted and it came out quickly.  The chicken was hot and flavorful, the mac and cheese was gooey and delicious, and the fries were the perfect salty counterpoint.  Finally I topped it off with a slice of bourbon cake to go.  You would think that after all the drinks I'd had this evening, I wouldn't need cake with bourbon icing - but you'd be wrong.  The cake was delicious, and the burst of sugar was just what I needed to take me through the night.",4.0
"I went on a Friday night around 6:30 or so. We saw lines on another day out the door and ratings so we assumed it was good. When we went it, we were sat immediately. I ordered the basic ""hot chicken"" simply to give it a try, since I've had it before in Nashville and it was delicious.     The food came out in a timely manner and I was READY TO EAT! The first thing I noticed was all my chicken pieces looked like thighs. I believe one piece in there may have been a wing. It was highly breaded and the chicken inside didn't have much flavor. That's when I asked for BBQ sauce.     We asked a couple next to us if they come frequently. They said yes, but the guy claimed that it has been an off night because the flavor is off. I surely agreed haha!     *** I ""may"" try it again but not any time soon. You should give it a try and let me know what you think! ***",3.0
"Yo. There have been times when I did not enjoy my carry out experiences when ordering from Peaches. Spending time dining in house have been mixed but positive overall. Great food but not always the absolute best service. Tonight, Peaches won me as a real big supporter. Tonight the staff flexed and turned up for me in an honest way. My girlfriend and I took seats at the bar and a guy who had been sitting took standing room next to my girlfriend's chair talking to another woman nearby. His elbow was sticking into my girlfriend's back and she asked him to give space and he dismissed her saying ""it's going to be tight"". We would have been more permissible if he asked us to scoot or move over a bit. He was out of his mind angry when my girlfriend finally moved over her chair after he continued to lean into her. Peaches does not have standing room bar space. So when he got aggressive, we confronted him saying No, Stop It. He and I stood flexing chests  while I told him to keep cool and give us our space. He was not nice and very rude. I asked to bartender to figure things out and the bar tender responded to our needs and told him to calm down. The owner, Rodney, backed us up and we enjoyed the rest of the night with a few special moments. Overall, thank you bartender Meek and Rodney.",5.0
"Word of advice my dear Yelpers: go early. We went around 10am and snagged one of the last seat free. Egads! Food is pretty tasty, the biscuits are awesome and the overall vibe is pretty cool. The Bloody Mary was heavy on the Sriracha so not totally my fave, but definitely a spot to check out.",3.0
"The service was terrible, we ordered our drinks once we sat down, chased for several times and they finally came after we finished our meal, both appetizers and main course. The people sat next to us, who arrived earlier before us, only got their drinks but their food never came. I heard good words about the fried chicken at this place, but when I had them, it wasn't worth the wait, at all. This is New York, and there plenty better fried chicken places out there, and theirs are just extremely dry and not even well seasoned.

"Only complaint would be the size. The bathroom is right behind you if you are sitting along the front of the bar. Definitely an architectural fail. So imagine people waiting for the bathroom, while the waitress is also trying to pass... A lot of ""excuse mes"" and ""sorrys"" or a lack of which can cause an unannounced tension. Other than that.

"This is definitely a small restaurant. When I go there for the very first time, I thought I went to the wrong place, I can't even locate the restaurant at night.

"I don't usually eat fried chicken but when I do, I want the real deal. Peaches HotHouse is the real deal. I went to brunch here last weekend and though the egg scrambles and corn pancakes looked amazing, I had to get the hot chicken. The HotHouse prepares their fried chicken in the Nashville style and I'm a huge fan.  Must admit the coffee at $3.50 is a bit overpriced but they do give you refills. The place is small so be prepared to wait outside the restaurant. I had been here for dinner several years ago and noted that they had redone the place to extend the bar  and remove tables. I think was a nice touch as it made it feel a little less cramped and sitting at the large bar was relaxing. What's the hot chicken? Three pieces of chicken ($13) served on a piece of white bread and your choice of southern side. First, the breading on the chicken is amazing and you will find yourself eating every last bite and then wishing for more! The breast and leg were each beautifully cooked and very filling. When I couldn't finish, my boyfriend (who had already eaten his chicken and bacon potato salad) ate the rest of my plate as it was good enough to eat the scraps... I went w/the cheesy grits as my side and I was very impressed with the creamy, buttery, cheesy grits that retained heat for minutes.  Amazing.  I will be back to try the mac n cheese.",5.0
"Came here because the regular Peaches was closed due to an emergency. Came  on a double date for brunch on a Saturday. I had the hot fried chicken with the potato salad . Personally, I didn't like the Potato salad. I was expecting small pieces of potato but the potato pieces were quite large. The chicken is actually mediocre . Yes it's hot and spicy but it's not due to the seasoning. They just sprinkle cayenne pepper AFTER the chicken has been fried. So I bite into my chicken and I have a sneeze fest because the cayenne pepper is ALL OVER . That's lazy cooking if you ask me. On the other hand, the drinks were very very good. The place is super tiny and only has about 8 tables. Wouldn't go back .",3.0

Catfish nuggets are sooooooo good! I need them once a week. I'm a seafood lover so our can't imagine how surprised I was to fall in love with the fried chicken!

I enjoyed this place immensely. I was craving fried chicken and decided to check it out this past Saturday. It is very small so be prepared to wait for at least an hour on weekends. There is a board when you get there and you have to sign in.

I did not get the spicy chicken because I was afraid that I would get heartburn after but my daughter told me that her chicken sandwich was spicy and it was not that bad since we are Caribbean on our scale she thought it was not that bad. You get side orders with the chicken so I got mac and cheese. It was awful. No flavor and bland. Do not get it. The French fries are excellent seasoned and the grits were amazing.

I thought the creamy grits would've had cheese since I saw a lot of the other patrons with cheese on their grits, but I guess you had to ask. It was just really busy and overcrowded.",3.0
"The food here is ...... REMARKABLE DELICIOUS & SCRUMPTIOUS! I had the Grandma Eda's Meatloaf it was sooooooo GOOODDD! I even added their housemade hot sauce and it packed in the extra zing & kick, you people may like! The place is small I can say that, it's best to go early evening. But the food outweighs all the wait because I was very satisfied! The mac & Cheese is amazing. Just delectable! The bacon potato salad is just as great. The pricing is very reasonable and service great.",5.0
"When a majority time vegetarian can't resist trying the chicken at a chicken place, you know something is being done RIGHT. Also- you can make a plate out of the sides alone. A++ to the collards, garlic sauteed broccoli, mashed potatoes, and cornbread.",5.0
"The only bad thing about this place is that everyone knows how awesome it is and it's a tiny space, so you will have to wait. The fried chicken is no joke (loooove the spicy Tennessee style) and service is great. Brunch is an especially good time to go.",4.0
"They are pretty good, its pretty lively in there i like it.",4.0
"Love finding southern food up north...and YES they have SWEET TEA!!We ate SOOOO much food and everything was AWESOME! Catfish nuggets, Crispy Grits, Creamy Grits, Kale, Collard Greens, Mac & Cheese, and HOT Fried Chicken, then for Desert we got the Bourbon Pound Cake. I would definitely go here again next time I'm in Brooklyn.",5.0
"Crispy grits and fried chicken go perfect together. Between the perfectly crisp and not greasy chicken to the relaxed local atmosphere, I'll be making the ten minute walk from my apartment more often than my body would like.",5.0

"Food was really delicious, staff was not the most attentive (hence the 4 stars instead of 5).  Place is EXTREMELY small and therefore there was almost an hour wait (we had 6 people before us).  Waitstaff is limited, I think there was only one waitress.  Food took an appropriate amount of time to come out.  My boyfriend's drinks took a long time despite the fact that we were sitting 2 feet from the bar.He got the hot chicken and I got the catfish in jalapeno remoulade.  His chicken had the appropriate amount of spice...my catfish was far far far from being spicy.  Even the jalapeno remoulade was not spicy at all.  For 2 people the bill was $45....we each got an entrée, split the Andouille sausage appetizer and he got 2 beers.",4.0
"First things first, might as well get the major negative out of the way. Service was slow. Went on a Sunday evening around 8pm. After a party of 4 had left with my group being top of the waiting list, it took them a good 15 mins to clear the table to get ready for us. Afterwards, food took quite a bit of time to get after placing the order (maybe 20 mins?). The wait wouldn't have been so bad except drinks only arrived a few minutes before the food did. Felt bad for the people waiting on the bench outside because I knew it would take them quite a bit of time to get seated. On the other hand, outside of the slow pace, our waitress was pleasant and helpful and once the food started to come out it basically came out almost all at once.Now onto the food itself, which I believe warrants the 4 star review:Southern Charcuterie Board: Consisted of fried wedges of bologna, slices of smoked sausage, pulled pork, thick cut prosciutto style rolls of ham, some pickled onion, mustard, and some sesame crackers. Overall pretty good. Typical of what you would expect from fried bologna and the sausage. The pulled pork was very smokey and too dry for my tastes but a few splashes of hot sauce fixed that. The ham went well with the mustard but I felt the slices were too thick and it made the meat a bit chewy.Fried Green Tomatos:The tomatos were pretty nice and cut thick. The arugula salad, dressing, and bacon kind of overpowered the tomatos though so I would suggest removing some of the toppings from the tomatos and using them sparingly.Blacked Catfish:I didn't get a chance to try some (more like I ran out of stomach room by the time I got to it) but my friends didn't seem all too impressed by it. I'd say it's a probably skip unless you just have to have some fish.Regular Chicken:Very clean tasting fried chicken. I don't think its really fair to judge fried chicken by saying one place is best over the others. Skin was nice and crispy with a slight hint of seasoning. Meat was perfectly cooked but otherwise I felt was missing a little something and was kind of bland. Maybe some extra black pepper in the batter would help immensely.Hot Chicken:This is the chicken to get. I'm not a huge pepper head and I don't like my food immensely spicy. The hot variety was perfect, just the right amount of heat but not enough to cover over the flavor of the chicken meat itself. And the heat would slowly burn more as you went through the plate. I'd stick with this spice level and I think the extra spicy might be too much for me. It was good enough that after the first two plates of hot chicken, we got a third for ""dessert"".Sides (collard greens, bacon potato salad, grilled broccoli, mac and cheese, crispy grits):The sides were all pretty solid but I felt they were all lacking a little bit, but that's probably due more towards personal tastes. I felt the collard greens lacked salt and probably could have been fixed with the addition of bacon. Not sure if there was any bacon in the dish already but I didn't get any on my plate and I couldn't really taste it. Bacon potato salad was pretty good but some pieces were basically quarter of a potato in size. Also there was an off taste which I think was dill mustard. I like mustard and I believe mustard in potato salad is traditional but I'm not a fan because I think it interferes with the mayo. Grilled broccoli was standard, I think steamed with garlic slices and then lightly grilled. Mac and cheese was pretty solid although I've gotten use to everywhere else putting bacon in with their mac. Crispy grits was nice, small cubes of grits bread crumbed and then lightly fried. The grits were pretty good on their own but I would have loved a light drizzle on melted butter over them.There were also pickles scattered among the different plates that were very good. Very light pickling as to not over power the dishes. Sweet with a hint of spice to them and very nice snap since they're thick cut.Side Note: Kudos for the palmolive dish soap cut with a bit of water in the bathroom! Definitely cuts the grease off your hands a hell of a lot better than standard hand soap.",4.0
"So glad my husband found this place on Yelp, and it was so close to our new apartment! This will be our ""go to spot"" for Southern dining.I normally take photos, but when we went they had just dimmed the lights. It was a Monday night at 7pm and the place was packed. We added our names I the waiting list (diy-dry erase board at the door) and our wait was 20 mins, but it went by so fast! They do not pressure you at all! We got to enjoy our meal at our pace. Service was on point, always making sure we're ok.Hot Chicken- next time I want the EXTRA hot, bc hot wasn't so hot. The chicken was so juicy and the breading was deliciously seasoned with cornbread. This also came with a side so we ordered the fried grits.Cornbread- fantastic, not too sweet!Fried Grits (cubed)- amazing! Crispy on the outside and oh so creamy on the inside.Fried Green Tomatoes- amazing again! Catfish Nuggets-fried just right!",5.0

"Id love to give more stars, but it's so small that it's nearly impossible to enjoy your meal- I almost got a mouthful of my neighbors fro .... more than once.

Great chicken and sunday specials! Careful of the wait during busy times.Good choice of beer and basic cocktails as well. Fried green tomatoes are a great way to start the meal.,4.0
"I LOVE THEIR CHICKEN!!!Their hot chicken is honestly some of the best I had. I had the regular because I do not eat spicy food, however the spicy is definitely hot if you like. My friend and I came here and we were shocked to see how small this place was. It was pretty ""intimate"" with its seating and I could hear the weird conversation next to me. That was not too great. The service is extremely welcoming in this restaurant which I really enjoyed. Their drinks were not too bad, a little too sweet for my liking. I ordered the Sister Rosetta which is their most popular drink and it was not my favorite. It tastes like a sex on the beach which many people happen to like.Their macaroni and cheese had a powdery taste to it, so it took away from the down south home made taste I was expecting so I did not finish it. Their vegetables and their french fries [sweet potato fries as well] are amazing!I had been waiting to try this place for quite some time so I was happy to finally get here. I don't know if I would return, it is a little pricey but not too bad. Reasonable.",4.0
What!!!!!!  Now this is A whole in the wall. THE CHICKEN!!!!! if you like hot!!! Get the extra hot chicken its not hot where you can't breath. But your going to know your eatting something spices.  Hold the fuck up!  Have you every had a burger with and chicken cutlet on it. And you can have that spice too.  I even love the mason jar they give you drinks out of. Get on down here and get you eat on #Bedstuy,5.0
"Absolutely loved this place. Sat at the bar for brunch and had the corn pancakes, which were delicious! The eggs were perfectly cooked, which is sadly rare, and overall the experience was incredibly enjoyable. The bartender was a sweetheart and recommended food and drinks, making me a delicious whiskey and baileys iced coffee. Would definitely come back, great vibe.",4.0
"I had Peaches HotHouse on my to-do list since I randomly found them on Yelp under a bunch of users' fried chicken lists last year. And then recently, a friend sent over a NYT article with a ghost pepper fried chicken recipe based on Peaches' recipe, and we knew we had to go.We stopped by on a Thursday night before 8pm, so we were able to get a table (by the time we were leaving, there was a line out the door, so prepare accordingly). The space inside is very clean, with some charm and TVs. They have a bunch of beers on tap, including local ones.For appetizers, we started out with the fried green tomatoes (which come with bacon!) and an order of fries. Fries were crispy and of medium thickness. I was definitely a fan of both, could could've actually gone without the fries because I didn't realize the chicken would come with a crap ton of sides!Onto the chicken - they allow you to mix and match spicyness, so I definitely recommend doing that. We asked for a mix of hot and extra hot (it was actually two pieces hot and one extra hot). For $13, it came with a side of your choice (I went with the bacon potato salad), corn bread, sweet pickles, and a slice of white bread. So yeah, a ton of food.The chicken took awhile to come, but that's just a factor of how many people were ordering them and how many they could deep fry at once, so can't blame them for that. The fried chicken skin was crispy all around. The hot wasn't unbearably hot, but it made you feel alive. The extra hot (the one made with ghost chilis) however, was another story. Prepare to sweat and drink tons of water/beer. The heat sneaks up on you and puts some hair on your chest (even if you're a girl, I bet). But it wasn't a one-trick pony - you still got the crispy skin and the tender meat underneath.The side of bacon potato salad was definitely a good choice, as the coolness helped a lot with the spicy (and eating cold bacon is interesting). I also tried my friends' mac & cheese and collard greens. Both were great, but I'd give the edge to the mac & cheese.Our server was great at giving us recommendations and explaining the menu to us. He was the one who recommended that we mix-and-match spicyness, and gave recommendations on sides.All in all, definitely a great experience and a great meal. Quite possibly the best fried chicken that I've had in Brooklyn!",5.0

Will be back soon!Update: We started going once a week and have loved everything we've ordered. Give me another Sister Rosetta!",5.0
"one word : grits. this is real soul food. a quaint and gorgeous restaurant, with a home style feel. it's usually packed so it's best to get there early. worth the wait. great service. great music.",5.0
"I've had this place bookmarked for a while now. I wanted some brunch and needed to knock out an essay so I decided to come here. Clinton St. Baking was so far. This was definitely the answer. My server, I believe her name was Chivon, really nice. I wasn't even aware that they had happy hour on the weekend. Of course I took advantage of that! I ordered a Sister Rosetta and french toast. I wasn't the biggest fan of the peaches on the side. I don't care for warm fruit. The drink was fruity. I enjoyed it. I don't need strong drinks so early in the AM.As I'm eating this smelly guy (going to assume he works in the kitchen) sits next to me and pushes my water and Sister Rosetta closer towards me. He sits, he eats. It's hella seating in the establishment too. I get extremely nauseous at this point. My stomach is weak so certain smells upset my stomach. I struggled to finish my food. I ordered the bourbon pound cake to go. Really looked forward to the berries. I had the berries separated from the cake so it wouldn't be soggy when I was ready to eat it. Kinda disappointed when I peered through the container to see blueberries as I love strawberries especially with cake. I don't think I was expecting icing on pound cake either. Too much. It was okay. I wouldn't order it again. Happy to have tried it. Maybe I'm missing something since it could've been served warm had I ordered it to stay.

"What a wonderful place! The extra spicy chicken is one of those dishes hot enough it takes a certain athleticism to eat it, but, unlike many other incredibly spicy dishes around town, this one is so delicious I want to go back as often as possible. The sides I've had are all excellent and the drinks are magnificent. Everybody who works there creates a welcoming vibe and everybody who eats there abides and makes the place feel extra friendly.

The chicken was crispy, juicy and delicious! What have I been eating all of these years?!?!)For my sides I got the mac and cheese (which was cheesy, not at all greasy, and pretty damn good considering I'm a bit of a mac and cheese snob) and the collard greens (which were some of the best greens I've ever had that were not prepared by a blood relative!! like...I didn't even put hot sauce on them!!)

"PHH probably ranks one of the highest in terms southern style fried chicken places in NYC. Normally I only go for dark meat because almost everyone overcooks their chicken but theirs was juicy enough so I didn't mind the mix of white and dark meats. The skin was crispy without being oily or too bready. Flavor wasn't anything extraordinary but something about that spice seasoning they sprinkle on top is addictive. I got mine extra hot while my wife got hers hot. Maybe they messed it up in the kitchen but they both tasted equally spicy to me. My wife doesn't tackle extra spicy too well and ended up getting a side order of the creamy grits to keep the mouth from burning up. Heh heh... I have never seen her eat fried chicken so slowly. I don't know if they purposely made the pickles sweet but they also helped diffuse the heat.The grits that my wife got were actually pretty delicious. I could taste the butter in it. My side order was apple smoked bacon which was good but I've had smokier, more flavorful versions of this. We also had a side of kale was came immersed in a savory broth. Probably not the healthiest of way of having kale but I liked it though my wife wasn't a fan.It was an ordeal for us to get here all the way from Astoria by public transportation and I""m not sure if it was special enough for us to come back but I'm glad we tried it.",4.0
"Mmm Mmm that's good chicken.Service left something to be desired. But the vittles were good enough for me to make a return visit next time I visit Brooklyn. The place is small but cozy. Seems like there was one server for every table (in and out), which would make our wait times make sense, but I still wasn't happy about it. The wait was so long, the server offered complimentary cocktails. I appreciate that they acknowledged how long we were waiting. Plus, there was a long line by the kitchen entry for to go orders, so I figured the food was worth waiting for. And it was.We started with fried green tomatoes, which was topped with bacon, arugula, and some kind of aioli. We also ordered the fried catfish nuggets, which were more like strips. Both dishes are very good. Both were crisp without a drop of oil on them.I ordered the hot chicken plate (mild, no spice), with greens and creamy fried grits. My BFF ordered the spicy chicken, greens and mac and cheese. I think they gave her the very spicy instead of spicy, because it was so spicy she couldn't finish it. Mine was perfect. Super crunchy skin, moist interior. The greens were good too (mac and cheese were so so, kinda bland), but the creamy grits were the side star of the show. Delicious. The cornbread was soft and sweet too.I was too full for dessert, but with the service being what it was, I didn't want to wait 30+ minutes for it either. The chicken though. And the fried green tomatoes. And the fried grits. Delicious.",4.0
"With a bustling crowd and a mellow ambiance, Peaches Hothouse presented an interesting duality: It was busy, yet cozy. Even though it was crowded, my girlfriend and I were seated fast. The service was good but not great; this is to be expected with such a packed house. When the waitress came around, she was very nice, but she didn't seem to know much about the food.Speaking of the food, it was delicious. My meatloaf had a nice, well-done crust and a moist interior. The mushroom gravy was delightfully creamy, as were the mashed potatoes. My girlfriend enjoyed her food as well, even though catfish is not high on her list of favorite fish. Sadly, I only got a sliver of cornbread on the side; I would have liked a bigger piece.Peaches Hothouse's delectable food and comfy atmosphere net it a 4 out of 5 in my book.",4.0
"I was really looking forward to eating here especially after reading the reviews. I ordered take out and got to the restaurant early to pick up my food. The place was small and packed. I ordered the hot chicken with macaroni and cheese. 5 minutes later I got home and my food was cold, not warm at all. This was the first disappointment. the chicken was not seasoned well at all. There was some type of red pepper seasoning, maybe peprika, that burned my lips but was overall bland since it was not combined with a seasoning that had more flavor. The macaroni and cheese was also nothing special and the cornbread just tasted like a cold piece of cheap cake. I know I'm a good cook but sometimes I like to enjoy relaxing and eating out. I'm not sure if I somehow got unlucky or this place is really just so bad. The chicken  was not even that juicy when I bit into it. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone and I'm really disappointed that I wasted my money on subpar food.

Service was excellent.  Food was prepared and served in a timely manner.  I would recommend the fried catfish appetizer and can't go wrong with the signature fried chicken meal.  Reservations are not accepted and the place is on the small side so I'd advise dining on off peak times or be prepared for a wait.,4.0

Went back a few times and revisited the menu! All sooo good!! Discovered some awesome regulars and the main bartender Edward who runs a tight ship & pours an awesome drink!!!",5.0
"PHH probably ranks one of the highest in terms southern style fried chicken places in NYC. Normally I only go for dark meat because almost everyone overcooks their chicken but theirs was juicy enough so I didn't mind the mix of white and dark meats. The skin was crispy without being oily or too bready. Flavor wasn't anything extraordinary but something about that spice seasoning they sprinkle on top is addictive. I got mine extra hot while my wife got hers hot. Maybe they messed it up in the kitchen but they both tasted equally spicy to me. My wife doesn't tackle extra spicy too well and ended up getting a side order of the creamy grits to keep the mouth from burning up. Heh heh... I have never seen her eat fried chicken so slowly. I don't know if they purposely made the pickles sweet but they also helped diffuse the heat.The grits that my wife got were actually pretty delicious. I could taste the butter in it. My side order was apple smoked bacon which was good but I've had smokier, more flavorful versions of this. We also had a side of kale was came immersed in a savory broth. Probably not the healthiest of way of having kale but I liked it though my wife wasn't a fan.It was an ordeal for us to get here all the way from Astoria by public transportation and I""m not sure if it was special enough for us to come back but I'm glad we tried it.",4.0
"Mmm Mmm that's good chicken.Service left something to be desired. But the vittles were good enough for me to make a return visit next time I visit Brooklyn. The place is small but cozy. Seems like there was one server for every table (in and out), which would make our wait times make sense, but I still wasn't happy about it. The wait was so long, the server offered complimentary cocktails. I appreciate that they acknowledged how long we were waiting. Plus, there was a long line by the kitchen entry for to go orders, so I figured the food was worth waiting for. And it was.We started with fried green tomatoes, which was topped with bacon, arugula, and some kind of aioli. We also ordered the fried catfish nuggets, which were more like strips. Both dishes are very good. Both were crisp without a drop of oil on them.I ordered the hot chicken plate (mild, no spice), with greens and creamy fried grits. My BFF ordered the spicy chicken, greens and mac and cheese. I think they gave her the very spicy instead of spicy, because it was so spicy she couldn't finish it. Mine was perfect. Super crunchy skin, moist interior. The greens were good too (mac and cheese were so so, kinda bland), but the creamy grits were the side star of the show. Delicious. The cornbread was soft and sweet too.I was too full for dessert, but with the service being what it was, I didn't want to wait 30+ minutes for it either. The chicken though. And the fried green tomatoes. And the fried grits. Delicious.",4.0
"With a bustling crowd and a mellow ambiance, Peaches Hothouse presented an interesting duality: It was busy, yet cozy. Even though it was crowded, my girlfriend and I were seated fast. The service was good but not great; this is to be expected with such a packed house. When the waitress came around, she was very nice, but she didn't seem to know much about the food.Speaking of the food, it was delicious. My meatloaf had a nice, well-done crust and a moist interior. The mushroom gravy was delightfully creamy, as were the mashed potatoes. My girlfriend enjoyed her food as well, even though catfish is not high on her list of favorite fish. Sadly, I only got a sliver of cornbread on the side; I would have liked a bigger piece.Peaches Hothouse's delectable food and comfy atmosphere net it a 4 out of 5 in my book.",4.0
"I was really looking forward to eating here especially after reading the reviews. I ordered take out and got to the restaurant early to pick up my food. The place was small and packed. I ordered the hot chicken with macaroni and cheese. 5 minutes later I got home and my food was cold, not warm at all. This was the first disappointment. the chicken was not seasoned well at all. There was some type of red pepper seasoning, maybe peprika, that burned my lips but was overall bland since it was not combined with a seasoning that had more flavor. The macaroni and cheese was also nothing special and the cornbread just tasted like a cold piece of cheap cake. I know I'm a good cook but sometimes I like to enjoy relaxing and eating out. I'm not sure if I somehow got unlucky or this place is really just so bad. The chicken  was not even that juicy when I bit into it. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone and I'm really disappointed that I wasted my money on subpar food. Bedstuy has many great places to eat and unfortunately this place could not even compare.",1.0
Service was excellent.  Food was prepared and served in a timely manner.  I would recommend the fried catfish appetizer and can't go wrong with the signature fried chicken meal.  Reservations are not accepted and the place is on the small side so I'd advise dining on off peak times or be prepared for a wait.,4.0
"If there is a line to enter, you have to put your name on the bulletin board.  Cute idea.  I had the regular fried chicken, mac & cheese, collard greens with a side of potato salad.  The chicken was good, but not enough to make me go out of way to come back.  After hearing someone on my job rave about it, I was disappointed.  The mac and cheese was good, but the collard greens had a bit too much vinegar and very spicy.  The potato salad was ok.  The service was good and efficient.  I was surprise by how small it is with just a seat for two in the doorway.  If you go when it is cold outside, which I did and your table is near the door, keep a scarf close by as there is nothing blocking the air as customers come and go.  They use a air of drapes to either try and hold back some of the cold.",3.0
"This place is the closest I've gotten to Southern food. I wouldn't know about the authenticity of the recipes, but everything was pretty good. My friend and I got the fried chicken with a side of mac and cheese and mashed potatoes. There are no problems with the food, but the service was okay. There was one guy that started out as our server. He asked if we could move to acommodate a bigger group, which was fine, but no one helped us move the drinks or bags. Then, we got a second server who requested the food and was very nice. Then, we had to wait for the original waiter to pass us our check.",4.0
"This place is the bomb.com. I came here with my best friend and the food was so good. I ordered the fried chicken which came with three pieces and a side, I got the Mac and cheese it was good also. I ordered corn on the cob which was just ok, collard greens which was seasoned well and mash potatoes. The mash potatoes were extremely good. They also provided a small piece of corn bread and regular bread. To drink I got the Minnie Mouse drink which was strong. My friend got the hot chicken which she said wasn't to hot and collard greens. The total bill was $54 bucks. That shocked me but the side orders were between $3 and $4 dollars. I highly recommend this place. Food was delicious.",4.0
"If you're from the south(to a New Yorker thats anything below them) and want some soul food, then this is about as close as you're going to get. Now its not your grandmas chicken, greens, mac and cheese but its not bad for a NY'er. It's a small setting but it doesn't take too long to get seated. I almost forgot, the Spicy isn't Spicy. So go ahead and take the plunge if you're on the fence.",4.0
"Service was great.  I probably didn't get the best dish for myself which was ribs and grits but the others in my party were extremely happy with their meals.  The flavor was my only issue but that was on my tastebuds and not the cooks.  Again, amazing service though.",4.0
"My friend and I came here on a Thursday night, it was packed! At first it was a little confusing, figuring out their seating process and who actually worked their because the hostess was in regular clothing. I eventually noticed her and then she showed us the board that we had to put our names on to wait. The weather was nice out, so we decided to wait outside on some benches. The wait felt pretty long, but after awhile we were seated. The place was very cute and hipster-esk, a great place to go for a date or with a small group of friends. Our waiter came over a few moments after we were seated, he was very nice and knowledgeable. I ordered the fried chicken, corn on the cob and fries; my friend ordered the Booker T burger, Mac n cheese and fries. The meals are made to order so that justifies the long wait time that we experienced before being seated. Our food finally came to the table and we dug in, it was absolutely DELICIOUS!!! My fried chicken was seasoned perfectly and super crunchy,  her burger was also amazing and so were our sides, there were no leftovers. Once  we finished, the only thing that we regretted was that we didn't order anything to go. We've definitely found a new food spot in Brooklyn! Oh and to put the icing on the cake, they're CHEAP :)",4.0
"If you go at 4 PM, there are five people in the place, and you can drink your drink and eat your hot chicken as a peaceful moment at the end of the work day. It's kind of amazing.  The blackberry limeade bourbon drink is also amazing. Every single thing they cook is good.",5.0
"Delicious chicken. The wait was terrible though. I have to say, if you go to a good fast-food chinese place you might find this type of chicken. The difference is in the flavor and how toasted is the skin. Overall, its a restaurant that deserves to be tried once.",3.0

Like to feel the burn.  Order the fried chicken extra spicy.  Whoa!  I can take spicy..but wow..and I loved every minute of it..sweating and all.  This is one of the BEST fried chicken places..ever!!  And I'm picky!  I have been here a couple of time s and I love it.  Place is a little cramped but what can u do.  The bartender on weekends is beyond awesome and makes killer drinks.  Yum!  I had most of the sides and the collards r the truth. One gripe I have..I ordered the bourbon cake to go..after two bites I dumped it.  Tasted old and heavy.  It also absorbed tastes and smells from their fridge.  It tasted like it was sitting next to a bag of onions.  It looked pretty and I felt sad dumping it.  Desserts r not listed on their menu and I guess doest move too much.  Minus a star.   And bring back happy hour on the weekends.  Whhhaaaa.,4.0

"So good that it's my second day in a row eating here! Peaches is a much-appreciated spot in a neighborhood lacking quality dine-in restaurants.

"Peaches never fails to satisfy. Any fried chicken you get there is well executed. (Unless you truly do not like heat, start at the middle level of hotness for the chicken. It's not that bad.)

For sides we got collard greens, creamy grits, grilled brocolli, mac and cheese, asparagus and god knows what else. I am not exaggerating when I say this. Pretty much everything we ordered was lip smacking delicious! Even for an Indian guy, the extra hot fried chicken was hot and absolutely irresistible. We stopped complaining about the cold weather after the first few bites of that chicken :) My friend who was with us has been in the restaurant business for over 20 years and has ran several fast food restaurants in his career. He said that the fried jumbo shrimps were some of the best he has EVER had. His wife is from the caribbean and she knows her Southern food.

"The food here is really great but for 530 on Sunday the service was terrible. There was only one other table when we got here, but the waitress that was managing our table was inattentive and forgetful. We didn't even get water until after we received our drink order. She was constantly doing everything else but helping us. Our food came over an hour after we placed our order - AFTER other tables that came later and ordered the same things as us. Arugula and watermelon salad was super tasty and of course the fried chicken is fantastic (they mean HOT).

"Okay which would YOU rather have; shi-shi foo-foo decor w/okay food, try your luck service and higher prices OR bare bones decor, great food, very good service and lower prices? Well listen here; I never go to a restaurant to eat the lighting, dinnerware or table napkins! Give me plain plates, forks and mason jars to drink out of but just make sure that what I'm eating and drinking is exceptional to my palate and fairly priced!!! This is why I love Peaches Hot House!One of my favorite menu items is the HOT Fried Chicken!! It's so hot that you have to let it ""burn itself out"" on your tongue! Now I know that sounds crazy but what I'm saying is just let it burn... Water won't help. Neither will milk or bread. Just let it take over and soon you'll become used to the burning hot spices. It will be okay I promise, just try not to lick your lips though... It only makes it worse. The collard greens and Mac n Cheese are both really good and well seasoned! The fried shrimp is Ah-Mah-Zing and their fish is always, always cooked to perfection! I once had a slice of fresh blueberry pie with a nice spoonful of whipped cream and though I haven't had it in a looong time...I think of it often. The crust -flaky and not too thick, the blueberries were plentiful and sweet. This had to be a homemade pie! There was so much love in it. So much love. Ahhhh (I had to take a moment to reflect).But anywhoo, their drinks are very good and as I mentioned above they're served in mason jars which I personally love!! Tip: If you're ever feeling a bit under the weather and need something better than NyQuil I suggest that you make a beeline for PHH and order their Hot Toddy!!!! It will lay you down reeeeeeaaaaaaaalllllllyyyy LOW and you'll have one of the best sleeps ever! It's a great small spot that I wish was bigger.  It sits approximately 18-20 on the floor with maybe an additional 5 at the bar...Service is very good (even when we walk in 10 minutes before the kitchen officially closes) and the smiles we receive on our way in are just as big as the smiles we receive on our way out!Go- enjoy!!!",5.0
Great for Tompkins avenue..Alittle smaller than peaches on Lewis (the original peaches)but it's nice inside and the staff is very nice..I like drinks from here..the bed stuy punch..I always order the turkey meatloaf with a side of salad..I strongly recommend this eatery if u are I.

"i was not impressed by this place. the place is very small inside. the fried chicken was not especially good or anything to write home about. some of the staff were nice and a few were downright rude like i as the customer was getting on their nerves. no problem, you'll never seem my green again. the place itself is a sweatbox. it's so tiny and you're getting the heat from the kitchen inside the dining area which is very very small. the bar is very small too which means there is little room to navigate. i mean, if someone flushes the toilet the whole place will hear it. the bathroom is also right by the kitchen door (gross). the corn looked rancid. the collard greens were good. there were vagrants loitering outside begging for money and harassing patrons. i guess it would be worth it if the food was amazing but it wasn't. if this is the best fried chicken you've ever tasted, then either you haven't had authentic soul food or your taste buds are off or maybe i got a bad batch. either way, never again.",1.0
"This place is all types of amazing! Really chilled spot in bed-stuy. A bit on the tiny side but that's pretty typical in NYC and the food makes up for it.

As for sides, I always get the grilled asparagus or the bacon potato salad and I've never been disappointed. They also have an amazing happy hour with a nice selection of cocktails for $5!! Oh, you must try their french toast if you go for brunch. So good it makes you want to do a happy dance!Love the HotHouse!

"Deeelicious! Make the trip out there. Yes, it's further out than the normal hipster would travel but it is worth it. The hot chicken is amazing. The crispy skin is packed with flavor and no oily mess. Careful because the hot really is hot. Also get the fried catfish nuggets. Soooo good. Crispy outside soft insides. Yum! Collard greens not worth it but the mac looked good. I'll have to get it next time. Dishes come with cornbread. If I wasn't full, I'd ask for seconds. Staff is friendly. No wait for me on a Saturday brunch time. Drinks are great, though a bit light.",4.0
"The food here is really great but for 530 on Sunday the service was terrible. There was only one other table when we got here, but the waitress that was managing our table was inattentive and forgetful. We didn't even get water until after we received our drink order. She was constantly doing everything else but helping us. Our food came over an hour after we placed our order - AFTER other tables that came later and ordered the same things as us. Arugula and watermelon salad was super tasty and of course the fried chicken is fantastic (they mean HOT).

When I moved to the neighborhood I was eager to try Peaches Hothouse since I had already been to Peaches before moving nearby. The chicken here is out of control!I ordered the Hot Chicken and I would advise anyone thinking about ordering something else on the menu to not. If you don't order the hot chicken you will be sorry. It's too good not to have and enjoy! The cocktails look good but I was more keen on the beer they have on tap! Good selection and it only seems right to pair a Hot Chicken with a cold beer.The service here was not the best but okay. It was busy and they were orders going in and out but for a small establishment I was expecting a more personable experience.,4.0
"So I heard about this place from a friend. I was skeptical, being very familiar with good southern food, and having been disappointed with the lack of it since moving to NYC. Nevertheless, I gave it a try.Walking in, I was quite surprised by the warmth and welcoming of the quaint, almost unnoticeable place. There's no sign on the door, but the decorum inside spoke volumes about the hothouse identity in an organic, non-pretentious way: it was clean and sleek, but cozy. I felt at home.My friend and I saddled up to the bar. It was happy hour ($5 cocktails, local beer 2 for $5)  I ordered the Sister Rosetta and the Hot (not extra hot) chicken with the collards. My friend (vegetarian) ordered the fried green tomatoes and Mac and cheese. A-MAZ-ING!!!!!!!! The chicken was crispy with a wonderfully, spicy flavored breading. The meat was juicy, hot and flavorful in its own right. Obviously marinated. It was literally the best fried chicken I've ever had. Not just in NYC. We also orders the bourbon cake for dessert. Just as flawless and yummy. To add, the staff was crazy nice and friendly, offering suggestions and hoping to help in any way possible. I will most certainly be back. Is it wrong that I'm kind of glad that it doesn't have a sign outside? I wanna keep it all to myself. Lol...",5.0
"Peaches HotHouse is pretty good for a southern style comfort food brunch. It is very small inside so it's not really great for large groups although I happened to go with a bunch of people.

This brunch was good but nothing about it blew me away.",3.0
"My friends and I were craving Nashville-style hot chicken and we couldn't take a casual trip down to Nashville so Peaches HotHouse was the next best option. I would say that their hot chicken spice level is on the more conservative side. Consequently, if you like your chicken with some extra heat, going for the hot or even extra hot should satiate your palette. You also can't go wrong with any of the sides. The fried green tomatoes were divine. Highly recommend it for someone who has never tried Nashville-style hot chicken or for those of you who miss it.",4.0
I visited this establishment last night and I must say the food is amazing. I ordered the Hothouse burger. The burger was so delicious and the fries were tasty as well.

"Went last night for my first time...I discovered Peaches during my #Bedstuy, and subsequent #PeachesHothouse, search on Instagram. The pics of the crunchy chicken did it no justice, but really was enough to draw me in w/in days of my arrival to my new home. I ordered the extra spicy chicken and OMG was it that. I kept sucking in air to cool my mouth while I relentlessly kept munching on the crunchiest juiciest fried chicken I've ever bought at a restaurant. *I never order fried chick, as I prefer the perfection of home cooked chickenAnywho, my friend and I also had the following...Fried Green Tomatoes w/ Bacon & Arugula- Flavorful but I like my tomatoes with more crunch to themPotato Salad w/ Bacon- Soooo BOMB! This coming from a person not big on Tato saladCollard Greens- cooked to perfection but I felt the need for salt and hot sauceHowlin Wolf- aka Dark n Stormy. Delish! Mac'n Cheese- Let me say I'm 1000% lactose intolerant. I get migraines, itchy, and bad breakouts from dairy. Did that stop me from grubbing on forkfuls of mac'n cheese? Um, HELL NO! Lol by the time I got home I was itchy and woke up this morning w/ dry patches. Jim Cade burger- I didn't sample this but from the looks of it, and the after effects of my friend unbuttoning his shirt to ""make room"" I'd have to say this hearty looking burger was equally delish.

Booker T. burgers for my sister and I (reg burger topped with a piece of fried chicke), and for my mom another burger that they had on their list of daily specials (was just a reg burger with an onion ring on top). All three burgers, although juicy, were extremely bland. Collard greens on the side was honestly the best part of the meal...my mom and sister second that emotion.",3.0
I went here a couple of weeks ago with a small group no tables were available so we sat at the bar. The bartender was very nice took drink orders right away and they were good . We ordered our lunch I got the fried chicken because it was said to be the best i also got a side of greens and my cousin got the Mac and cheese so we could share. Now the reason I give this place 3 stars is because everyone's food came out besides mines only my greens came out. I thought since I ordered fried chicken maybe it took s little longer but I was still sitting there. Finally one of the waiters asked me if I wanted a plate and I said no I'm waiting for my order. So right away he went to the back to check....somehow my order didn't get mad so they had to make it  I was starving but I got a drink on the house while I waited. Then they gave me free cornbread which was soooo good and apologized for the wait. Finally my food came out and they apologized again and told me my meal was on the house! I dug into my chicken right away and it was so good they have house made hot sauce and that was awesome also. Anyways I finished what I could took the rest home and as I was leaving the serving apologized again. So even though I had to wait for my food they tried there best to make up for it and I appreciated that In the end I would still return and give them another chance. The food was great so if your around check them out.,3.0
"There is no awning for Peaches HotHouse, only a small chalkboard by the side of the restaurant that finally gave the place away.  My bf couldn't find it and the only way I found it was because I saw the address 415 by the door.  Anyway, I was craving fried chicken and looked threw my list of bookmarks for good reviews on fried goodness. I finally decided to go to the Hothouse to try their hot fried chicken.  Needless to say, I was not disappointed.  I got the extra hot fried chicken with a side of bacon potato salad for $13.00. The server kindly advised me that the extra hot fried chicken is really hot in which I answered ""I drink hot sauce.""  The bf got the regular fried chicken wings and a side of fries.  Finally, the food came and it was everything my craving wanted, crispy chicken that's tasty, oily, and definitely hits the spot.  The bacon potato salad was nothing exceptional, but man their friend chicken is good.  The french fries was not on the crispy side, it was soft and salty.  And of course, I never fail to give credit when it's due.  The servers were very nice and attentive.  Bottom line, come here for the fried chicken I agree with the other yelpers.",4.0

Booker T. burgers for my sister and I (reg burger topped with a piece of fried chicke), and for my mom another burger that they had on their list of daily specials (was just a reg burger with an onion ring on top). All three burgers, although juicy, were extremely bland. Collard greens on the side was honestly the best part of the meal...my mom and sister second that emotion.",3.0
I went here a couple of weeks ago with a small group no tables were available so we sat at the bar. The bartender was very nice took drink orders right away and they were good . We ordered our lunch I got the fried chicken because it was said to be the best i also got a side of greens and my cousin got the Mac and cheese so we could share. Now the reason I give this place 3 stars is because everyone's food came out besides mines only my greens came out. I thought since I ordered fried chicken maybe it took s little longer but I was still sitting there. Finally one of the waiters asked me if I wanted a plate and I said no I'm waiting for my order. So right away he went to the back to check....somehow my order didn't get mad so they had to make it  I was starving but I got a drink on the house while I waited. Then they gave me free cornbread which was soooo good and apologized for the wait. Finally my food came out and they apologized again and told me my meal was on the house! I dug into my chicken right away and it was so good they have house made hot sauce and that was awesome also. Anyways I finished what I could took the rest home and as I was leaving the serving apologized again. So even though I had to wait for my food they tried there best to make up for it and I appreciated that In the end I would still return and give them another chance. The food was great so if your around check them out.,3.0
"There is no awning for Peaches HotHouse, only a small chalkboard by the side of the restaurant that finally gave the place away.  My bf couldn't find it and the only way I found it was because I saw the address 415 by the door.  Anyway, I was craving fried chicken and looked threw my list of bookmarks for good reviews on fried goodness. I finally decided to go to the Hothouse to try their hot fried chicken.  Needless to say, I was not disappointed.  I got the extra hot fried chicken with a side of bacon potato salad for $13.00. The server kindly advised me that the extra hot fried chicken is really hot in which I answered ""I drink hot sauce.""  The bf got the regular fried chicken wings and a side of fries.  Finally, the food came and it was everything my craving wanted, crispy chicken that's tasty, oily, and definitely hits the spot.  The bacon potato salad was nothing exceptional, but man their friend chicken is good.  The french fries was not on the crispy side, it was soft and salty.  And of course, I never fail to give credit when it's due.  The servers were very nice and attentive.  Bottom line, come here for the fried chicken I agree with the other yelpers.",4.0
Perfectly quaint!  Delicious hot fried chicken...and hot means hot!  Don't forget to try the crispy grits. The Mac n cheese and greens are well seasoned. The $5 happy hour was icing on the cake.,5.0
OMFG this was the best chicken I ever had. So good I couldnt even speak. It was like I went into another universe where all that existed was this sweet delicous tender perfectly cooked chicken and nothing else mattered! It's so good that I don't want to go there too often and potentially get tired of it! Just.do.it.,5.0
"This place is seriously dangerous. The food and drinks are amazing and if you're an idiot like me you'll easily end up with a $200 tab for 3 people. I went to brunch with 2 friends. We started with the shrimp and grips app which was pretty good. Lots of small shrimp and around 6 pieces of fried grits. For my main I got the extra hot chicken, while delicious it was honestly too hot to eat. I didn't really enjoy it very much. I enjoy hot food but this was ridiculous. Probably the third spiciest think I've ever had an issue with. My 2 friends got the pancakes and french toast which they enjoyed. One of them got a side of chicken with their pancakes which was awesome.  The real reason my bill was $200 was the drinks. They have a delicious coffee cocktail on the menu. I'm not sure exactly what's in it but it will knock you on your ass if you're not careful. I'm not sure how many we had, they were $5 during brunch happy hour and $8 after.

"Read a lot of great reviews about this place in my neighborhood, so decided to give it a try last night: we were 4 girlfriends and a 5yr old niece. We arrived at 8pm and got a table outside about 20min later. Too long after being seated, the server eventually came to ask about drinks. She rattled off names of a bunch of craft beers, and while I am familiar with some craft beers, I'd never heard of ANY of the ones she mentioned. She mentioned one was a ""light beer"", I asked whether that meant light as in low-cal or low-alcohol. She said it was ""light"". Helpful. I asked her what 'regular' craft beers they might be comparable to... she replied ""we don't have regular beer."" I told her that I understood that, but asked what they *might* be similar to, ie. Sam Adams summer ale, Coney Island, etc. She seemed perplexed. My advice would be to print a beer menu with descriptions of the beers, so that people who are not familiar with your vast array of unusual craft beers can make an informed decision!We then ordered, including a side of fries for the 5yr old. After 45min of waiting (and our server didn't even come back to ask if we needed more drinks), we stopped her to ask when we might get food, especially because the child was falling asleep. Her answer was ""We've got a lot going on back there"". Really?! Then the manager came out and explained that the kitchen was really backed up because of so many take-away orders. We asked her to at least bring some fries so the little girl could eat and sleep, which the manager obliged, and also offered a round of drinks on the house. Nice offer, although why bring another giant cup of juice (filled with ice!) for a 5yr old who didn't finish the first juice and was already asleep?How's this, Peaches: if your restaurant is full to capacity and you have a long line of patrons still waiting for tables, tell phone-in customers that you're not taking take-away orders at this moment. Aren't patrons who patiently waited to be seated and then patiently waited to be served, deserving of priority treatment?

"I'm not new to Peaches, I've eaten here many times. I traveled from DC to check out the hot fried chicken. I ordered the fried chicken and yam fries. My friend ordered, JUMBO shrimp and fries. I asked for two hot and one extra hot. First off my chicken was mad different. It wasn't crispy at all. I've ate here many times so I had a measuring stick to judge from. The chicken was not crisp or spicy. The extra spicy was not even regular spicy. It was just mildly spicy chicken all around. My friends order was suppose to be JUMBO shrimp. The shrimp was not even large. Medium shrimp is served in place of JUMBO. On the menu it says JUMBO, yet they continue to serve the wrong size prawns. I don't know what's going on at Peaches Hothouse but it's not the same. Consistency with these small eateries can be up and down.

There is no separate marinade for the spicyer chicken, nor do they use a separate pepper-infused batter or anything like that. It's just a spice mix which is dusted on top, probably shaken out of a canister. My guess is that the difference between ""hot"" and ""extra hot"" is a function of how many times you shake the canister over the chicken, which probably explains why it's inconsistent. Would be nice if they just put cans of seasoning on the table, but I'm sure they have their reasons for not doing that.How hot is Extra Hot?

"I've been to peaches quite a few times, and the food is delicious. I have to warn you though... The place is very small. Peaches is southern soul food.... They specialize in their fried chicken which is delicious. My favorite side has to be the Mac & Cheese. My friend had the chicken po' boy, and he really enjoyed it... So much that he vows to go back to have it again. The drinks have to be my favorite though. Their specialty cocktails are all delicious. My favorite has to be the sister Rosetta. Since the place is tiny, I'd recommend bringing a date here or a group of 2 or 3 tops.on any given night you should expect a wait, even though it may be a short one. The service was great though.",4.0
"UPDATE, 8/27/14: I'm changing this to reflect the food, which is really great. And the fact that Ben and Craig, the owners, explained the circumstances that evening (training staff) while also fully apologizing for the experience and making it right. Like good people. Who do great restaurants with great food. But this below...still happened.ORIGINAL REVIEW, 8/18/14: Dear Hothouse, I joined yelp to write this review. And to distinguish Hothouse from other establishments that know what ""service"" means. In the course of our nearly 3 hour excursion, my party and I were treated on the spectrum of INVISIBLE to SOCIAL PARIAHS.The Players: Myself, my boyfriend, our good friend from Toronto on her last night in NYC, and Hothouse staff from 8/17/2014The Setting: Sidewalk outside Hothouse, inside HothouseThe Plot: Upon arrival (8:40pm) and adding our name to the list, we were told that the wait was about 40 minutes. We watched names being crossed out very quickly for the first 15 minutes and felt hopeful that 40 minutes was an exaggeration - but soon the table turnover stalled. As we crept to the ""top"" of the list, we saw a two top on the sidewalk opening up. Hey, we thought, I bet we can totally add a chair there and make it work, since all the remaining parties on the list were ""threes."" As we watched the patron pay his bill and depart, it must have taken another 10 minutes for the table to actually be cleared and ""readied."" (Side note: The place was busy, but we witnessed what seemed to be 2 waitresses, 3 hostesses/bussers and a bartender - which for all of us looked to be plenty of staff to handle the small restaurant. My boyfriend has been in the industry for a very long time and believes he could have waited on the whole floor by himself better. For the majority of the time, we saw staff standing around doing nothing...while one waitress (who may have been the manager?) covered nearly the entire restaurant. Our waitress in fact would disappear for lengths at a time until we asked other people for help.)Finally, that table was cleared, the skies were smiling upon us, and we rejoiced. Until we saw the another party being sat there instead. When my friend inquired about this, as we were the next party on the list, the waitress indicated semi-rudely that they only seat two tops outside with three if one of the three is a child in a high chair. Disappointed and hungry, we waited a bit longer. Not more than 5 minutes later, another two top opens up on the sidewalk, and a hostess (?) calls us over to take the table as she will go grab another chair - which is precisely what another person told us could NOT be done. Looks were exchanged between us, but we were starving and decided to take what we could get. As we waited for the third chair, a complete four-top opens inside and I requested that table instead as it had been getting slightly windier outside. The hostess (?), clearly annoyed, says fine but it has to be cleared. At this point, we were disgruntled, yes - but never rude or inappropriate. We wait and watch as not a single person touches the table, in fact, not a single employee seems to be traversing the floor for a few minutes. Presumably, there was some type of conspiracy plot being hatched in the kitchen, because for the next hour and half, our party is forced to beg for service, for water, for silverware, for drinks...at first silently pleading for simple eye contact from anyone on the floor, then calling out for help, and finally at times simply getting up and getting things ourselves. The utter disdain that the entire staff had for our party was something I have NEVER seen before in my 31 years of life. We were sat at 9:58pm. Three tables seated AFTER us ordered, ate, and left before we were done. We flagged down a waitress at 10:17pm after having been ignored for 20 minutes. She didn't even ask us if we wanted drinks. Twenty minutes later, we inquired about the appetizers. They avoided our table like the plague, then gave insincere apologies and offered a round of drinks in response to our complaints. My friend had no interest in getting a drink but asked for her $6 salad to be comped instead - to which the waitress responded, ""no problem!"" What should appear on the bill? Her $6 salad. They got my order wrong and instead of apologizing (which I did, saying, ""I'm sorry, but this isn't what I ordered"") - the plate was gruffly taken from me and then practically thrown on the table in front of me 10 minutes later. I have had the shrimp sandwich before, and it did NOT look the haphazard way I received it last night. Bottom line, the food is really good and my other time at the restaurant was fine, but the service (or lack thereof) last night left the worst taste in my mouth that I have ever experienced. I have never treated a service industry professional as terribly as we were treated last night.",3.0
"Bed Stuy is home to some real (but rare) gems, and this is one of those places. I've been a few times and the food is consistently amazing. The staff is laid back and cool. Only issue is that the space is super small and the layout isn't great so there's often a wait of like 10-20 minutes. Bed Stuy do or fry.",5.0
"Pretty good all around, but the fries they serve are such a huge detractor and aberration from what seems like a menu w/ soul. They're industrial, cheap, frozen fries from a bag. For a small operation, you'd think they could manage a potato dicer and the simple process of double-fried fries - or baked fries - or anything ferchrissake, except frozen fries.",3.0
The place is small not a whole lot of seating. Had the fried green tomatoes served with crunchy bacon and arugula. the presentation and food was soooo goood. Also had their hot chicken. Yum seasoned right and juicy. I will definitely be back for more. My husband had the burger and was very tempted to order another one.,4.0
"Amazing southern cuisine. Very small, down home feel. If you're looking for an intimate setting this is NOT your place. It gets really crowded around dinner time. Instead it's a good place to come alone or with friends (3 at the max) and catch up. I love the music selection.  The drink selection is great, and the staff are really nice. Be careful in ordering the hot chicken because the hot is actually Very Hot. For sides order the kale it's seasoned to perfection. Also try the bourbon pound cake for dessert!",4.0
Loved this place. Went here last minute with a friend after our first set of plans fell through. The food was awesome. I had the fried cheese grits and the meat loaf. Both were don't to perfection. I also had a drink called the Ma Rainey. Let's just say I'll be back. The atmosphere is cozy. I wish it was bigger but once you're seated it isn't bad at all.,5.0

"What a bummer. This place really impressed me the first time around. I had the meatloaf and the boyfriend had the nashville hot chicken. They were both delicious, sides included. Granted, the boyfriend was red-faced by the end of the meal, but serves him right for wanting to show off and getting the hottest option.But it's been diminishing returns every trip since. The last will be our final one for a while. What a nightmare of a night. The service wasn't just slow, it was a nashville hot MESS. Our first server peaced out halfway through our meal, and the waitress that was left was almost in tears she was so overwhelmed. The kitchen didn't make it any better. The food was cold, bland, the bread was dry as a bone and tasted stale. We didn't even bother to complain the service was that slow we just wanted to leave.Shame. I'd love to go back. But which Peaches am I going to get? Will it be the one that won me over with that first fried-spicy-delicious bite? Or will it be a disappointing mess? Better question: do I want to waste my time and money finding out?",2.0
"Best Fried chicken place in Brooklyn! I have been there a few times. The first time I ordered the spicy fried chicken . I did not know how spicy it was going to be . It's hot ! So Beware .The second time I ordered the regular fried chicken which is pretty good. I've also had the fried shrimp once but did not really like it for It was soggy and a bit too greasy for my taste buds . Nonetheless, this place has awesome fried chicken .

"Peaches Hot House is the smaller version of Peaches, but I went to this location first. The wait on the weekends for brunch is about 30-45 mins because the space is small and they have maybe 2 waiters at most. The food is pretty good, especially the granola crusted french toast - that's what I always order, with a side of fries. The drinks are strong and they usually have specials, so plan ahead and have a good meal.",4.0
"Unbelievable menu and drinks!  I only wish it were roomy enough to fit large groups (because it's guaranteed to be a crowdpleasing meal).  Favorite dishes are probably the asparagus, macaroni and cheese, meatloaf, shrimp sandwich, and catfish nuggets.I'd technically give it 4.5 stars because the service can be really slow, but I can't imagine they can fit much staff in such a small space.  However, the staff's pleasantness and the tastiness of the food makes up for it.",5.0
"The food was good. My sister and I Ordered the Booker T  and my mom ordered a burger off the menu. The food was good, a little bland but not bad. For a starter, We had the Tallahassee Jam which was pulled pork on a crispy pretzel chip. That was really delicious, and the mustard sauce that came with it was good. We ordered the Mac n cheese, potato salad and collard greens as well. The collard greens were the best. The other two a little bit on the bland side. Overall it was a good place to have lunch but wouldn't rush back here again any time soon",3.0
"I always get the extra spicy here, and while it certainly packs a punch it is far from an obnoxious test of  fortitude.  In short, it might be the most perfectly seasoned piece of chicken I've ever eaten.  It's also nicely brined, so it's always perfectly moist and meaty.Points off only for:1)  Mac & cheese that's fair at best.  Skip it, get the excellent butterbeans instead.2)  Service that's often haphazard, which is fine at a place like this as long as it's always is upbeat and friendly, which it is 80% of the time, but 20% of the time it can be attitude-y.  (Probably if you go here a lot, or work here, you know exactly who I'm talking about...)3) Portion size is small: you're charging $13, give me half a chicken, not 3/8ths of a chicken!",4.0
"I'm not a fan of fried chicken at all. So, when my mom said she wanted to go to Peaches HotHouse while she was visiting, I was skeptical. I mean it's chicken doesn't it all taste about the same? Wrong, so wrong. For starters we ordered the giant iceberg wedge with blue cheese and bacon. Before it was brought to our table my thoughts were... salad wedge so like they cut a head of lettuce in half... I just didn't understand. When I got it and ate it I understood, the blue cheese was so good and the salad was just right, very crisp and a great start to our meal. I recommend ordering it as a starter. For entrees I got the crispy fried jumbo shrimp, I couldn't decide what side I wanted so I got the mac and cheese as well as the potato salad (I ended up taking them both home because I was too full). The shrimp was awesome, spicy, but not too spicy and they removed the top shell part, I cannot stand it when restaurants don't do that, it came with chipotle mayo for me to dip the shrimp in, yumm. I also had a slice of bread that I didn't end up eating I took it home, corn bread that was so moist and full of flavor and pickles, I love pickles. My sides that I just took a quick taste of were good too. Very creamy mac and cheese and the bacon potato salad was down right awesome. My mom ordered the hot chicken plate, as I said before I'm not a big fried chicken person and bones in chicken freak me out. Well my mom forced me to try some and let me tell you it was the best fried chicken that I have ever had. She got a side of grits and she said that they were awesome as well. Overall it was well worth the 20 minute walk from my apartment to come here and there is no question in mind, I will be back again. On another note I'm not sure why everyone is saying the service is so rude, when we went our waiter was awesome and very attentive, a bit awkward but he did his job well. It also wasn't super busy when I went so hey who knows maybe there just aren't enough waiters to go around during the busy hours.",5.0
It loses a star for service and space. To be fair it was a rainy day - but there was no space to wait for our table and it took a very long time to get a drink after we sat down. But everything got better once we got that drink and it ended up being a great dining experience. The food is BOMB. The hot fried chicken is really delicious. Sides are tight. I would highly recommend going here - just don't go with a big group. 4 person party max.,4.0

Yes it's hot, but it's no one trick pony. It's also delicious, not greasy, quite juicy and the spice goes beyond the skin down to the bone. The mild may lose some heat but none of the flavor.$12 for 3 healthy sized pieces and 1 side are hard to resist.So hard that once after a excellent brunch of ($7.50) oyster po' boy  (not NOLA quality but still good) and sweet potato fries I got envious of the people around me eating chicken that I got an order to take home, for some quality alone time.I consider this a southern-influenced as opposed to traditional southern restaurant. The difference being you won't see potato salad, turkey wings or smothered pork chops on the menu. You will see bacon topping fried green tomatoes and sweet corn and black eye peas salad.While the chicken is the star,  Peaches HotHouse really excels at  being a great restaurant. From the egg scrambles at brunch, to drinks served in mason jars, to the  blues soundtrack ( Taj Mahal, Muddy Waters etc) and pretty affordable prices  it's a near perfect , southern influenced dining spot.",5.0

You will see bacon topping fried green tomatoes and sweet corn and black eye peas salad.While the chicken is the star,  Peaches HotHouse really excels at  being a great restaurant. From the egg scrambles at brunch, to drinks served in mason jars, to the  blues soundtrack ( Taj Mahal, Muddy Waters etc) and pretty affordable prices  it's a near perfect , southern influenced dining spot.",5.0
"Was skeptical after my wife found this place online. We were staying at a nearby Brooklyn Sheraton.  We went and after being a little nervous about the neighborhood we went inside to an immediate seat and I enjoyed the best fried chicken I've ever had - hands down. I live in Texas and my wife is a native (and a great cook) and neither of us had had it so good.  My 3 boys thought the same.I had chicken and greens - both amazing.  Mac & Cheese is all good too.Wife had 3 sides - beans, corn, asparagus - all top shelf.Services was not great but the kid seemed new and he was friendly.Prices were fair and not typical New York.Place is really small so go early or plan on waiting.Highly recommend this hideaway for Soul Food in Brooklyn.Tom H - Austin TX",5.0

"I just returned from Peaches and well..........meh, I've experienced better lol. My family and I decided to try a new place every other Sunday and today was Peaches.  We arrived and the place is super tiny.  The waitress was also the hostess and she seemed very flighty. It's honestly not a good idea to go there with a party of more than 5.  We were a party of 4 and we were cramped.  It seems as if the place can hold no more than 25 people.We ordered our food and ordered our drinks at the same time, but it took around 10 minutes to get the drinks.  I am a good character of Iced Tea (sweet tea!) and Peaches tea did not hit the spot.  The tea seemed as if it was made with honey, which is like a country no no.  The food came out 30 minutes after the drinks and it was not hot!  There is nothing worse than cold food when you are starving.  The friend chicken was hot and yes it was good, but all of the sides were lukewarm or cold.  My mac and cheese was lukewarm and when I took a second fork full of it, I actually had a cold noodle.  It honestly wasn't that great. My dad had the beans and they had a hamhock in them (my family is from the south so they love pork), but they were cold as well.  When he sent our sides back, his new order of beans didn't have the ham hock, so he wasn't so happy.   The cornbread was smaller than my palm and it was also not the best.  It was underwhelming.I honestly think the only people that really enjoy this place are the handful of hipsters who now reside in Bed Stuy.  I don't think I will return to this location due to a lack of service (the waitress/hostess never even asked us if our food was ok, nor did she apologize for the food being warm) and the food wasn't that great.

Focus!So I decided to try this place for my love of fried and hot food and to see what all the hype is about and to support a local business. Now, I have a very high tolerance for hot food...Like, ridiculously high. Too often I order dishes that are advertised as being devilishly hot, only to be sorely disappointed. So I went in with the mentality that their hot can't possible compare to my hot. This lead me to order the  extra hot, thinking that Peaches' hot won't do it for me. I was so effing wrong. The hot was so damn hot. Like burn your mouth and need a gallon of milk after each bite. The slice of bread and pickle (loved the pickle) also help battle the hotness. Despite my burning mouth, I was able to taste everything. This is a must for hot food, the flavor must be there and my chicken was packed with it. The meat was juicy and the skin was crispy.  The portions are also really big so you can easily share just one order. After having the extra hot, I had to go back for more, but this time I pulled it down a notch. I got the hot. Delicious! And I did not need as much milk this time. I also took it to go. This is a small place and it's always packed so be prepared to wait if you decide to eat in. They also have a limited amount of beers on tap (like 4). Side dishes are okay but honestly, who cares?

"Disclaimer: don't come here unless your expecting a carbalicious, fattening, fried, and greasy good time. There is no healthy vegetable in sight.We came here at 8:30 on a Friday night, and were told an hour wait. This is one of the few times where an hour really means an hour. I wouldn't advise coming at this time because if, it's cold outside, there's not any room to stand around. It will be a long and cold wait.As a double date, we had the fried chicken, fried grits n shrimp, fried green tomatoes (I sense a theme here) and various sides including kale, corn on the cob, mashed potatoes, and famed collard greens. To tell you the truth, I enjoyed the grits better than the fried green tomatoes. I liked the tangy sauce, and it was a good complement to the chicken.The fried chicken was great. As you may know, it can be difficult to get good restaurant fried chicken, this place does a fantastic job. It is crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. If you want hot sauce or honey, you will have to ask. My favorite side was the mashed potatoes. It was perfectly buttered and salted. I'm not a fan of collard greens, so I did not try. The kale was just alright. I didn't try to the corn either, it looked like corn that's been sitting in the water bin all day, waiting to be picked out. I imagine the mashed potatoes would be better, they would be hard to top.For dessert, the four of us shared the butter rum cake. It is HUGE. After four people eating, there was still some left over. If you are going to share with such a big party, I hope you are really close. After a while, it gets to be a jumbled mess, and you don't know who's eating what.Overall, the night was great. It was inexpensive. Appetizers, dinner, drink, dessert, and tip all for $67 pp. The waiter deserved it. He was nice, talkative, and gave great recommendations.

"I LOVE the hot house and have even got my neighbors involved! One of them is hooked now. Obviously the hot chicken is the draw here....and it is *delicious.* The breading is different than anything I've ever had for friend chicken. It has a slightly sweet taste, which plays off perfectly against the spice. The mac and cheese, while tasty, could use more seasoning. I've also had the fried chicken sandwich on their brunch menu (it's less spicy than the one on the main weekday menu) and it was to die for. Along with the sweet potato fries. Both of which I'll probably order right at this moment. I know they cook to oder and what not, but the food sometimes takes ridiculously long, so knocking off a star for that.

I had a piece of fried chicken breast with a side of greens. Not much to say but the food was very good.

I felt like I was eating family cooked soul food. Now I hope your mom and grandmom can cook and then you will know what I mean.

We didn't care too much for the Mac and Cheese though :/, there was a spice they utilized that had an awkward cinnamon flavor to it YUCK. The drinks were not only $5 for Happy Hour but they were really really good as well. Restaurant overall had a homey feel, however there is room for improvement on the decor and seating arrangements. If you don't like sitting too close to  strangers while eating---I suggest ordering food to go.",3.0
Peaches HotHouse is by far some of my favorite fried chicken in New York. Get it Extra Hot and slather it with some hot sauce. Might be burnin later but its ooo so worth it.,5.0
I have to say the fried chicken was awesome.  We went at 10am on a Sunday and by the time we left it was packed.  The chicken was moist and flavorful.  My veggie friends who came with me thought there food was pretty sub par. I would go back just for the chicken.,4.0
"Probably the best fried chicken I've ever had in a restaurant, period! The catfish nuggets are amazing. The drinks are too damn good to have just one! I wish they opened earlier during the week. But I'm glad they're in business. You'll be sure to find all the local hipsters there with their bikes chained to the fences or neighborhood trees. The menu is very simple. The staff is super casual and very friendly. I highly recommend this place as it is slowly becoming one of my favorite places to ever hang out and grab a drink/bite to eat.",5.0
"I LOVE the hot house and have even got my neighbors involved! One of them is hooked now. Obviously the hot chicken is the draw here....and it is *delicious.* The breading is different than anything I've ever had for friend chicken. It has a slightly sweet taste, which plays off perfectly against the spice. The mac and cheese, while tasty, could use more seasoning. I've also had the fried chicken sandwich on their brunch menu (it's less spicy than the one on the main weekday menu) and it was to die for. Along with the sweet potato fries. Both of which I'll probably order right at this moment. I know they cook to oder and what not, but the food sometimes takes ridiculously long, so knocking off a star for that. But for great chicken, the Hothouse is hard to beat in BK!",4.0
I had a piece of fried chicken breast with a side of greens. Not much to say but the food was very good. It wasn't some unexplainable twist on southern food; it made me seriously pause and think...did my mom cook this?... Best way to describe the meal is... I felt like I was eating family cooked soul food. Now I hope your mom and grandmom can cook and then you will know what I mean. Definitely better then smoke joint...which is owned but the same folks (I think) and I happened to have in the same week.,4.0
"First time here! Been dying to go! Cousin in town so we checked it out! Small spot! Told us a 45 minute wait but since it was just us 2, table became available quick! A plus! $5 happy hour drinks. 2nd plus! Had the Muddy Waters which was good. Cousin tried the fried grits and hot fried chicken which she was very pleased with! I went simple with scrambled eggs, bacon and grits! I was satisfied!  For dessert we shared bourbon pound cake and ice cream! Delicious! Wont wait for family to be in town to return!",4.0
"Fuck this place. They pretty much ruined my 1st Father's Day. As I wrote our name on the board,  I ask if it's going to be a issue to sit inside as we have a stroller. I'm told ""it won't be an issue"". Fast forward one hour later and I'm told we have to sit outside as it's too tight for a stroller inside. WTF? You assholes should have told me am hour ago when I asked. I see a two top and a four top inside,  I ask if we could sit at the four top... I'm told no because it's only two of us. I now have to get some food through a drive thru add I have to head home, get ready and go to work.  FUCK THIS PLACE! THANKS FOR RUINING MY 1ST FATHER'S DAY!",1.0
"I would give this place no stars if I could. I've never given a review on yelp but after this experience I felt compelled. I can't believe this place. We were so excited to come here for our friend's birthday on a not-so-busy Saturday night. Our usual haunt is Catfish on Bedford but we decided to change it up for this special occasion. Our group of 4 got there at 8:40 and we were first on the list for a table. We waited patiently for an hour while multiple tables were sat before us. Not only were the two servers completely confused, incompetent, rude and physically pushy, but they sat a party that had just arrived (after us waiting for an hour) at a table for 4. We were so fed up we walked out. For our group - and most of us work in the industry - I've never been so frustrated and disappointed with the lack of service. On top of this, the only bartender walked outside and sat with her friends so we couldn't even get a drink while we waited. It could have been a one time fluke, but considering the 3 out of 3 people working the front either appeared utterly confused at the simplest questions, rude, or straight outside sitting and chatting with friends while the bar was packed, I have very little faith in this place.

"Great Chicken, Pub Atmosphere, Diverse CrowdNo more needs be written about the chicken. It's magnificent.

The collared greens provided a great balance and the cornbread is just right, which I took to go and am happen to munching on now as I write this review.It's not just the chicken, however, that gives this place its comfy appeal. It has a quite well-attended bar (at least for five o'clock (PM) on a Saturday) which takes up a large portion of the rather small room. At any given time you might be treated to people all around you drinking and laughing and whooping it up, and that can really just improve your mood. But it can get a little loud in there, too -- not a place for sitting down and writing your Ph.D. thesis, or designing your latest art installation, or both, given that this is on the edges of hipsterish Brooklyn.What struck me was the diversity of the crowd. Bohemians, businesspeople, people from the neighborhood, Manhattanites, everybody was in the place, probably because it's Zagat rated. It's not the easiest spot to get to (off the A/C and a good 10 block walk), so if anyone outside of Bed-Stuy/Crown Heights is there, it's probably because they made the express trip. Peaches HotHouse was actually a rather moving study in how different types of New Yorkers may inhabit the same space, not because they are *forced* to crowd together, as is the case in Manhattan and the denser parts of Brooklyn, but because they were all indeed attracted to the same establishment.

The neighborhood is not the greatest, once you push through the curtains you enter a hipster fried chicken joint.  The decor is minimalist and the bar area is huge for such a small space, but in the end its all about the food.The chicken was moist and tender and seasoned well through the meaty sections, I am not sure how they did it.  The mac and cheese was to die for.  My husband loves this place and wants to go back.  Overall, the food was alright.",3.0
"Peaches HotHouse has been on my radar for a few years now but it took me a while to finally check out. I grew up in Florida and Alabama and every now and then, I crave that full-fat comfort food I grew up on. My girlfriend and I met a friend in the neighborhood for dinner and we were excited to dig in. The restaurant itself is small (but it's Brooklyn!) and the interior is inviting/cozy. I'm a vegetarian but I went in prepared to order from the side item menu which has plenty of meat-free options. I saw that fried green tomatoes were served and that there were a variety of sandwiches and burgers on the menu. I asked the waiter if it would be possible to get a fried green tomato sandwich and he could just ring me up for a burger/chicken sandwich or whatever he wanted. He said he didn't think they could do that but I was a little disappointed that he didn't bother asking the chef -- I definitely miss a fried green tomato sandwich.Undeterred, I order the fried green tomatoes and the crispy-grits (my girlfriend also ordered a mac and cheese with her meal that we shared). I added a blueberry lemon-aid with bourbon to drink. My drink was tasty and refreshing for a summer evening but there seemed to be barely any alcohol in it (which was a theme with all of the cocktails we ordered). My girlfriend overheard the table next us being a little more brazen and had sent their drink back to have more alcohol added!Our food arrived and my meal looked amazing except for one thing.. my fried green tomatoes were red! I hoped they would still taste as good, and they were definitely comparable but the difference was noticeable. Red tomatoes are more watery, so the batter got soggy and wasn't exactly sticking. By the end of my meal I had a pile of tomato mush and breading. The breading did taste good and I can imagine it being a great dish with green tomatoes. Put those things on a sandwich and you've got a winner!The mac and cheese and crispy grits were nothing to complain about, but were also fairly straight-forward. The mac and cheese had a nice layer of baked cheese on top and the crispy grits were simple but tasty (and for three dollars, a great side item). Overall my meal was good but the details left a tad more to be desired. I have a feeling it was an off-night, especially based on the other reviews. I also acknowledge that I'm reviewing a meat-heavy restaurant from a vegetarian point of view so my experience is atypical. I am confident I will be back soon, and hopefully I can update with more stars and kind words.",3.0

"A self-described  ""urban ""country cafe"" Peaches HotHouse serves the best fried chicken I've had in NY. What the menu calls ""the main event""= ""Nashville Style Hot Chicken! Crispy, Juicy and Spicy all at once Hot Chicken is not for the faint of heart, but it sure is delicious."" I'm not faint of heart, but, being possessed of tastebuds which are acutely sensitive to heat and spice, I was unable try anything hotter than the ""regular"" HotHouse crispy fried chicken. (If you are interested in reading about precisely how hot these birds are, see James F and Wing L's reviews). Something I really appreciated was that Peaches lets you chose which parts of the bird you want. As someone who vastly prefers white meat, I'm not a fan of places like Redheads where the fried chicken dish always consists solely of a leg and a thigh. Peaches also provides huge portions--my order of white meat-only ""regular"" chicken came with two breasts and a wing along with pickles and cornbread and a choice of one side (I chose the mac and cheese).  My table also ordered sides of mashed potatoes and bacon creamed corn to share. The chicken itself was crispy and juicy, but not in the least bit greasy. Although my order was not ""hot hot hot,"" it still packed in plenty of flavor, and I appreciated the bottle of homemade hot sauce on the side which allowed me to add just a touch of heat and spice. The mac and cheese was decent, but not of the creamy variety I prefer. The mashed potatoes were smooth and slightly peppery, and the creamed corn with bacon was a revelation. I am usually not a fan of cornbread, but Peaches' version was so moist, rich, and dense, that it almost made me a convert (if only all cornbread could taste like that). I washed all of this goodness down with a delightful pink rum punch served in a mason jar. Our waitress was extremely knowledgeable and helpful. I would recommend coming here early in the evening or early in the week as the place is small and fills up quickly.",4.0
"If you love fried chicken, then this is the place for you.  There really is no point in getting anything else besides the fried chicken.  The sides were decent but extremely average.  The chicken is juicy and flavorful, the skin crispy, and the spicy is SPICY.  The corn bread is delicious, tastes more like a cake.  Their drinks are good, certain drinks are served in mason jars.Its a small restaurant so be prepared to wait a little if you go during prime eating time.  It's also a little hard to find, but totally worth it when you do.",5.0
"I used to come here for brunch a while back.  I can't really recall what I've had there because I just looked at their menu online to jog my memory and I couldn't remember seeing anything  that was listed that I usually order.

"Up there again last weekend before Xmas; had the extra spicy, extra hot chicken.  We had a nice group of four, good conversation, but while I was downing that chicken I could hardly say a word.  Now I love some hot food, stuff that will send most folks running from the table, but I am here to tell you: that chicken is hot!  Way too hot to enjoy sensibly.  Like I said before, heat is good but it should not overpower the taste of the food.  Like Mombasa pepper; it doesn't get much hotter than that, but it doesn't kill the taste of the food.  Or maybe that's ALL they season their chicken with.  Anyway, I finished all three pieces on more of a personal challenge than on hunger.  Just like sipping strong whiskey - blow out through your mouth and don't inhale except through your nose and with your mouth closed.  And for God's sake, don't touch your face, people!4th star comes from the discovery of some very good hot sauce that they put on the table.  Very good heat and very good flavor - mmm.  i had that on some fries BEFORE the chicken came...Also liked the way they rearranged since the last time i was there.  Very nice, Peaches - keep it up!",4.0

"I saw Peaches Hot House on Food Network a few months back and decided to check it out.  I am not a fan of spicy food and did not get my chicken spicy (ordered regular).  My husband on the other hand loves spicy food and ordered extra spicy.  He even ordered some to go. The neighborhood is not the greatest, once you push through the curtains you enter a hipster fried chicken joint.  The decor is minimalist and the bar area is huge for such a small space, but in the end its all about the food.The chicken was moist and tender and seasoned well through the meaty sections, I am not sure how they did it.  The mac and cheese was to die for.  My husband loves this place and wants to go back.  Overall, the food was alright.",3.0
"Peaches HotHouse has been on my radar for a few years now but it took me a while to finally check out. I grew up in Florida and Alabama and every now and then, I crave that full-fat comfort food I grew up on. My girlfriend and I met a friend in the neighborhood for dinner and we were excited to dig in. The restaurant itself is small (but it's Brooklyn!) and the interior is inviting/cozy. I'm a vegetarian but I went in prepared to order from the side item menu which has plenty of meat-free options. I saw that fried green tomatoes were served and that there were a variety of sandwiches and burgers on the menu. I asked the waiter if it would be possible to get a fried green tomato sandwich and he could just ring me up for a burger/chicken sandwich or whatever he wanted. He said he didn't think they could do that but I was a little disappointed that he didn't bother asking the chef -- I definitely miss a fried green tomato sandwich.Undeterred, I order the fried green tomatoes and the crispy-grits (my girlfriend also ordered a mac and cheese with her meal that we shared). I added a blueberry lemon-aid with bourbon to drink. My drink was tasty and refreshing for a summer evening but there seemed to be barely any alcohol in it (which was a theme with all of the cocktails we ordered). My girlfriend overheard the table next us being a little more brazen and had sent their drink back to have more alcohol added!Our food arrived and my meal looked amazing except for one thing.. my fried green tomatoes were red! I hoped they would still taste as good, and they were definitely comparable but the difference was noticeable. Red tomatoes are more watery, so the batter got soggy and wasn't exactly sticking. By the end of my meal I had a pile of tomato mush and breading. The breading did taste good and I can imagine it being a great dish with green tomatoes. Put those things on a sandwich and you've got a winner!The mac and cheese and crispy grits were nothing to complain about, but were also fairly straight-forward. The mac and cheese had a nice layer of baked cheese on top and the crispy grits were simple but tasty (and for three dollars, a great side item). Overall my meal was good but the details left a tad more to be desired. I have a feeling it was an off-night, especially based on the other reviews. I also acknowledge that I'm reviewing a meat-heavy restaurant from a vegetarian point of view so my experience is atypical. I am confident I will be back soon, and hopefully I can update with more stars and kind words.",3.0
"I took my wife, daughter, and mother in law out for Valentine's Day dinner. Upon arriving at Peaches after delay and confusion we were instructed to write our name on a white board that hung in the foyer which ""was checked periodically "". After waiting about forty minutes we were seated. The the food and drink menu sounded great but fell short when served. The standout dish was the fried chicken, it was great. The hot sauce was delicious as well. I would only recommend this establishment for a fair weather day during happy hour.",3.0
"Very good home cooked food.  The Booker T was very good.  It could have use some sort of sauce though.  The hot sauce blend that they provided was bland. This place is small so be prepared to wait.  Also, the service was a bit slow. It was all worth it for the bourbon pound cake.",4.0
"The day my heart was broken in BK...I had previously enjoyed the other location.  Unfortunately this time was different. After waiting for over an hour we were sat at a tiny two top in the window( we were 3) next to the exposed door.  As snow flew in as  our order arrived to the table incomplete. The incomplete dish arrives after we were done eating. The food was good I think, since we rushed through our meal due to being so cold I'm not really sure.  They didnt even offer to take the late arrived item off the bill.  Won't be back again.

"A self-described  ""urban ""country cafe"" Peaches HotHouse serves the best fried chicken I've had in NY. What the menu calls ""the main event""= ""Nashville Style Hot Chicken! Crispy, Juicy and Spicy all at once Hot Chicken is not for the faint of heart, but it sure is delicious."" I'm not faint of heart, but, being possessed of tastebuds which are acutely sensitive to heat and spice, I was unable try anything hotter than the ""regular"" HotHouse crispy fried chicken. (If you are interested in reading about precisely how hot these birds are, see James F and Wing L's reviews). Something I really appreciated was that Peaches lets you chose which parts of the bird you want. As someone who vastly prefers white meat, I'm not a fan of places like Redheads where the fried chicken dish always consists solely of a leg and a thigh. Peaches also provides huge portions--my order of white meat-only ""regular"" chicken came with two breasts and a wing along with pickles and cornbread and a choice of one side (I chose the mac and cheese).  My table also ordered sides of mashed potatoes and bacon creamed corn to share. The chicken itself was crispy and juicy, but not in the least bit greasy. Although my order was not ""hot hot hot,"" it still packed in plenty of flavor, and I appreciated the bottle of homemade hot sauce on the side which allowed me to add just a touch of heat and spice. The mac and cheese was decent, but not of the creamy variety I prefer. The mashed potatoes were smooth and slightly peppery, and the creamed corn with bacon was a revelation. I am usually not a fan of cornbread, but Peaches' version was so moist, rich, and dense, that it almost made me a convert (if only all cornbread could taste like that). I washed all of this goodness down with a delightful pink rum punch served in a mason jar. Our waitress was extremely knowledgeable and helpful. I would recommend coming here early in the evening or early in the week as the place is small and fills up quickly.",4.0
"If you love fried chicken, then this is the place for you.  There really is no point in getting anything else besides the fried chicken.  The sides were decent but extremely average.  The chicken is juicy and flavorful, the skin crispy, and the spicy is SPICY.  The corn bread is delicious, tastes more like a cake.  Their drinks are good, certain drinks are served in mason jars.Its a small restaurant so be prepared to wait a little if you go during prime eating time.  It's also a little hard to find, but totally worth it when you do.",5.0

"As always, my wife and I try to hit some new spot on our wedding anniversary in April. This year, we did Peaches Hot House. The wait can be a pain and it is cramped, but for the food......whoa, it was worth it. Wifey had the hot, I had the extra hot. The chicken caused my mouth to have a party of yummyness on my tongue. I loved the spicyness of the chicken. Add to that, we did the fried green tomatoes which were OK, and the grits and cheese and catfish nuggets. Great stuff. Along with my chicken, I ordered the Booker T burger which had a piece of hot chicken breast on the sandwich. Talk about turf and turf, delicious. So if you crave for hot soul food but are willing to tolerate a wait and cramped space, hit up Peaches Hot House. Of course, with the hotness, the drinks are cool and refreshing too. Top notch.

No secret is safe here.Where PHH is winningA convenient little neighborhood restaurant featuring an inventive menu at a great price point, a staff that really seems to care and patrons who are generally nice and down to earth.  I like that a lot.All that being said, this spot is an easy trek for me and I'm never motivated to go.  I suppose I haven't found a menu item that makes me want to keep coming back.  I've tried the shrimp and grits and the duck sandwich and both were tasty, but neither left my slightly siddity taste buds wanting more.My suggestion - try it - if you're in the neighborhood - and see for yourself.   Not the most glowing recommendation, but like Cheryl Lynn, I Got To Be Real...(That's a Yelp review and a music education tied neatly with a bow.  You're welcome.)",3.0
"I came here for the Dine in Brooklyn 2 for $28 3-course special. We started off with one giant iceberg wedge with blue cheese and bacon. It was nothing special, just salad. For the main we had the 4 pieces fried chicken, came with 3 breasts and 1 wing, with 2 sides. We chose French fries, which was good, and mac n cheese, which was a little dry. I had the hot chicken and it wasn't hot at all. The chicken was so juicy and good, but not the best I had, though slightly better than Pies N Thighs. For dessert we had the banana pudding. Basically the special came with one appetizer, 4 pieces fried chicken, and one dessert. I wish they given 2 appetizers and 2 desserts.",4.0

"My friend and I came here twice and I must say, that both times the chicken was amazing.The first time I had the mild fried chicken but the extra hot chicken is the best!!!! I recommend this spot to anyone who wants a taste of some southern fried chicken.",4.0
"Fried chicken is good. Just in life, it's a good good thing. At peaches? It's AWESOME. The batter is perfect - just the right crunch, with a bit of sugar, and salt and pepper. Ordered the Hot and was hoping it would be hotter than it was. This would probably qualify as a medium, especially in a place that's known for its hotness!But nevertheless, well played peaches.Side of kale was good. Side of Mac and cheese was good. Appetizer of fried catfish balls, so so. Appetizer of shrimps and crispy grits, pretty good but not amazing.Overall- just order the chicken and make sure it's hot!!",4.0
"I don't even know where to begin. So I will start with this: ""GOTD@MN!""If I had to die tomorrow, and someone were to offer me one ""last meal""...I think I might have to pass on my mom's jerk chicken and head on over to Peaches HotHouse. I am not seafood fan, never have been, never will...but we ordered the BBQ shrimp and fried grits, and I can say that they not how to do it right.. When the fried chicken (hot), mac & cheese, and corn bread arrived....I nearly cried...it was beautiful :) My only complaint was the waiter, he must have been having a bad day, because he forgot to take our order to the kitchen (30 minute additional wait)...he apologized and took 50% off the bill....nice, a very solid save for Peaches HotHouse.",4.0
"The trek here is really kind of sketchy but I definitely think it was worth it. Right after I arrived, I was informed their happy hour was ending in 5 minutes ($5 cocktails until  7) so I quickly decided to put in an order for one, which was yummy. Though A didn't enjoy the meal, I loved the fried green tomato appetizer and think their fried chicken is delicious. We ordered the Hot, which is the least spicy though I could still taste the delicious subtle spiciness. The cornbread was good and our mac and cheese was ok but maybe would have been better if it weren't cold when it was served. The burger with fries was nothing special and we ended up taking half of it home. We were moved from a really nice corner window seat to a spot in the middle of two tables in the middle of the restaurant after we ordered our food. The restaurant is definitely small but we felt we had enough breathing room even though it was difficult to maneuver to our new table. Though we agreed to move right away, we regretted it after moving since it was much less comfy and enjoyable but it was made up for when they brought the check and took 10% off for the inconvenience, which was very considerate of them.",4.0
"F this place entirely! I've eaten here several times back when the other manager ran this place and the food was well above avarage but after he left, the man faced, she beast who works there now looked me square in the eyes and seriously told me that I couldn't use their bathroom?! Seriously? So I'm sure they could care less, but I'd just as soon opt for the Halsey street grill around the corner and not have to deal with the bad attitudes of people who feel I'm not good enough for their establishment.",1.0
"I thought the chicken here was quite yummy. I've eaten fried chicken all over the place and this stuff here was quite delicious. I got the mashed potatoes too, with some gravy on it. MMM MMMMM!

Or maybe someone wants to wait here for me? That would be nice? Let's go...you're waiting....",4.0

"A couple months ago, Wing L. issued a spicy challenge to Amy S. and me to eat Peaches Hothouse's famous spicy fried chicken. We both gladly accepted and then later threw a wrench in his plans by 1) Amy got sick the day of and 2) at Peaches, I calmly announced that I did not care for fried chicken was going to eat something else.I don't disllike fried chicken, but given a choice of fried chicken and something else, something else will almost always win. Fried chicken is what I eat when I don't see anything else I want. After Wing stared at me in disbelief, he asked me what I was there for then.""The sides."" I had looked at the menu and I was way more excited about the sides than I was for any of the main entrees.""The sides,"" he repeated. ""Yes, I want all of them!"" I gestured grandly. Thankfully Sandy C. and Sallina were game so we got all EIGHT sides -- collard greens, grilled asparagus, sauteed kale with garlic, creamed corn with bacon, French fries, mashed potatoes, creamy grits, and macaroni and cheese.They really know how to cook their greens, so that they're tender, but not mushy. I LOVED the collard greens, just a touch spicy to give it a nice kick. I would happily come back down to Peaches for their greens and the French fries (they don't look like much, but they have the perfect crispy exterior and mealy interior that you want in a fry). The creamed corn was very fresh, but I wasn't as enamored with it as everyone else at the table. Mashed potatoes are good, but didn't distinguish itself from other mashed potatoes that I've eaten, macaroni and cheese was okay (preferred a creamier and cheesier sauce), and the grits needed more  salt.While Sandy, Wing, and Sallina were chowing down on fried chicken, I had the boneless short rib. Very tender and good. Thankfully they provided extra bbq sauce because by itself the short rib lacked flavor. I got to taste Wing's ""extra spicy"" chicken. Very crispy and crunchy. Fried perfectly as it was not at all greasy and oily. Juicy meat. It was indeed spicy, but nothing that Wing and I would call extra spicy. The server told us that if we wanted it even spicier to order it ""owner's box"" next time. All of us also got the blueberry smash (muddled blueberries in a strawberry lemonade), which was utterly delightful. I made mine more delightful by having vodka in it. Next I'll try it with bourbon.Getting down to Peaches from Astoria took about 1 hr and 20 mins by train. A long ride, but I would say the food (and company) were definitely worth it. But what makes it really worth going down to Peaches is that a few blocks away, there's a hair salon that also does tummy tucks.

"After meaning to go the Peaches Hot House for the better part of a year, I finally hopped on my bike and made the ride out one Friday night. And I was very impressed. Despite the seemingly-constant sound of sirens (firetrucks, police cars, something that looked suspiciously like a drug bust...) outside, Peaches Hot House is an oasis of fun. Just make sure you sit INSIDE this oasis of fun, not at the tables outside.But first, the drinks! There was a wait, but the selection of good beers and cocktails at the bar made it more than bearable. As in, this is a place I would come JUST to drink, regardless of the food. And the food. That was pretty good too--the hot chicken sandwich with fries was delicious, and the mac and cheese was one of the best I've had. There were also some insane specials, like the Hot chicken dinner with 2 sides (instead of 1) and your own personal bottle of Allagash Curieux, all for $22, or $2 bottles of Blue Point.

Liked the atmosphere of the place. Wasn't as crazy about the food. Ordered the blackend chicken and a side of macaroni and cheese and they were both okay. The chicken was a little on the dry side but I enjoyed the macaroni and cheese.

"After meaning to go the Peaches Hot House for the better part of a year, I finally hopped on my bike and made the ride out one Friday night. And I was very impressed. Despite the seemingly-constant sound of sirens (firetrucks, police cars, something that looked suspiciously like a drug bust...) outside, Peaches Hot House is an oasis of fun. Just make sure you sit INSIDE this oasis of fun, not at the tables outside.But first, the drinks! There was a wait, but the selection of good beers and cocktails at the bar made it more than bearable. As in, this is a place I would come JUST to drink, regardless of the food. And the food. That was pretty good too--the hot chicken sandwich with fries was delicious, and the mac and cheese was one of the best I've had. There were also some insane specials, like the Hot chicken dinner with 2 sides (instead of 1) and your own personal bottle of Allagash Curieux, all for $22, or $2 bottles of Blue Point.

"If it wasn't for the NY Daily News writing an article about this boasting, hot fried chicken serving eatery in Brooklyn, I wouldn't have known about it!

At Peaches Hothouse, you get a choice of ""Mild!, Hot!!, or Extra Hot!!!"" We settled for the ""Extra Hot!!!"" There was a party going on the other side of the restaurant and they were getting served salads upon salads with chicken upon chicken. They seemed to be having a great time! After waiting 20 minutes for our freshly fried birds and downing some Blue Point Lagers, the ""Extra Hot!!!"" chickens arrived. One sniff and it boosted back up my senses! It was golden brown and delicious looking. The spice they tossed it around was definitely noticeable...pass the cayenne! You are served 1/2 of a chicken either breast or thigh, pickle slices, and one side of your choice...I chose the creamy grits. After one bite of the hot bird, I immediately tasted the sugar along with CAYENNE! Not savory as other fried chickens, meaning it didn't have much salt on it. Words to describe the chicken: crispy, juicy, sweet, tad bland, spicy. The spice kicked in after eating one wing. After that, though, everything was an easy walk home. Even though the grits had chunks floating around, it was descent and helped calm the heat down. The servers were friendly and fun!

"With upcoming travel plans to Nashville happening soon, I was quick to track down newcomer Peaches HotHouse in Bedford-Stuyvesent, which seems to be getting positive coverage for one of Nashville's most famous dishes: Hot chicken.We asked for this Nashville hot chicken ($12) to come ""the way it's supposed to be"" and expressed our ability to eat spicy things. As expected, things moved a little slower than normal New York City pace, which we were fine with given the nice setting to relax in. The bare woods and Earth tones let you enjoy your drinks (try the delicious lemonades!) while waiting.What came was not especially spicy, unfortunately, but extremely enjoyable. The crispy-fried perfection was served on top of a thick slice of egg toast, and while not setting your lips on fire, it did have decent kick. I guess next time I would insist on having it hot instead of politely requesting it.The menu is one page and very approachable, but offers enough to satisfy most moods. We went with the fried green tomatoes ($7) which are served with bacon and barbecue aioli, a dish that lived up to its tempting description.The mashed potatoes ($3) were all you could ask for and were so creamy and moist that gravy was rendered unnecessary. The collard greens ($3) were standard.Peaches has a decidedly neighborly feel to it, and was very welcoming as you might expect southern hospitality to be. It is definitely the type of restaurant you find yourself going back to more than expected.",4.0
"After much delay, I finally made my way to Peach's. My cousin came from DC a few months ago and I wanted to take her here for brunch, but it was so full that we were forced to go to Williamsburg and eat at Pies & Thighs. Seriously, Peach's Hothouse has some of the best fried chicken I've had in my life, and that's saying a lot considering the women in my family are some chicken frying queens from Louisiana. I love the feel of this place and our waitress, Lisa was simply amazing. I've never been to a restaurant where a waitress actually sits down beside you and tells you about the menu. She told me she was originally from Germany, but she sure does have the southern hospitality aspect down. We ordered the southern charcuterie platter which consisted of fried bologna, pulled pork cooked in bacon fat, and andouille sausage. Fattening yes, but delectable in every way imaginable. We also got a fried tomato salad with arugula and bacon and bbq mayo dressing. My original instinct was just to order plain fried green tomatoes, but Lisa convinced me otherwise; the salad was good but I should'v'e stuck to my original plan as fried green tomatoes stand out by themselves. Now as for the fried chicken, they have 3 options: regular, hot, and extra hot. Now I love hot & spicy food, but I was not ready for the extreme amount of heat that the extra hot chicken had. Lisa warned me, but when most people tell me something is hot, I'm usually dismissive cause it's not really hot. This didn't apply to the situation. While it wasn't so hot that it ruined the flavor, you definitely have to be careful how you it cause you don't want it burning your lips or going down the wrong way. Even for me, I think I'll get the hot chicken. Comes with one side (I got mac & cheese which isn't as good as my homemade version, but very good nonetheless) and cornbread. I've been wanting to come here for a long time, but the wait definitely paid off and this will definitely be one of my staples. Every time a family member or friend comes from out of town to visit, I will have to bring them here.",5.0
"Just ate here this afternoon and loved it! I've been to the original Peaches and we were worried we would have to wait for a table there so we came here instead. Not too crowded and we were seated immediately. Server was great! Attentive but not hovering. I had the sangria which was strong and sweet followed by the BBQ shrimp w/ crispy grits and finished w/ chocolate brownie and ice cream. All the food was flavorful, good portions, and wait wasn't long.The menu is one of those ones where everything sounds delicious and I'll definitely be back to try the shrimp and grits, watermelon salad, french, toast, etc. I don't eat chicken/beef but I know they're known for their fried chicken. Overall great experience and only a block away from my house so this could be my new favorite spot.They also have a full bar and well made drinks so it might be worth it to stop by in the late evening for small plates and cocktails.",5.0
"Dined here for a Saturday night dinner. It was packed. Note to self and others: they do not take reservations and your group must be there to be seated.The food was amazing here. This place would have gotten a 5 if it was just based on food alone. I got the Hot chicken with a mac and cheese side. My boyfriend got a Boneless Beef short ribs with collard greens and cream grits. Let me tell you ...for the money, it's extremely worth it. The Beef short ribs melted like butter when you dug your fork in it. The Hot (Hot means Hot) Chicken was extremely moist and full of flavor. They give you three pieces and even the white meat was delicious. My boyfriend managed to finish it all for us both but just the entrees alone will be enough. We just wanted to try everything (esp with the price!). Also love the fact that I get my diet coke in a mason jar! Other specialty drinks are also served in mason jars. Didn't have a chance to try them but it seems like someone at every table ordered one of them. Service and organization was what disappointed me. The people were nice but it's hard to get their attention because they were always running around. It is a small restaurant and, when its cold outside, people who were waiting try to cram into the restaurant in the small aisle (sometimes invading diner's space).",4.0

It was small and with goat cheese and arugula? Gimme a bowl of it and put salt on the fucker and call it good! Next was the Nashville shrimp. I dont know what that means, except damn good! Big shrimp, lightly breaded, and perfectly spiced. My side was asparagus. Good choice. I was drinking from Alex, he was good looking and easy going. Also made my suggestions, which were perfect!!I only want to talk about the -minus one star. Get rid of the slice of bread garnish, and . . . . you shall gain the 5th star!!",4.0
"3.5 starsI should preface this by saying I prefer hot wings to fried chicken.  We got an order of the hot and very hot despite the warning of the waitress.  Being a lover of hot and spicy, I was sure I would be able to handle it.  The hotness come from a rub which is hot enough to leave a lingering burn on your lips.  I liked it, but didn't want more than one piece of chicken.  Little too hot to enjoy a lot of it.  But the hot was not hot enough.  The skin was crispy (which I love) but I didn't give it 4 stars because I honestly didn't feel like there was enough flavor.  The meat was moist, but more bland than expected.  Maybe I have to try the regular next time.Oh- but order the shrimp.  That was fantastic.  And the fried bologna which was more like spam in my mind but the only other bologna I've had was Oscar Mayer.  Either way, it was juicy and flavorful.  (pickles on the side were a hit too)Sides-wise: agree with other reviewers that you can skip the mac n cheese.  I loved the kale and butterbeans.  The beans were smoky and delicious.  Give the fried green tomatoes a shot.  Crispy coleslaw (which is basically just coleslaw) was very peppery and a bit too much mayo for me.  But it was good to balance out the burning from the very hot chicken.  Potato salad was probably the best potato salad I've had but I'm not a huge fan so that may not be a fair judgement.   Dessert: apple blueberry pie.  YUM!  Get a slice of their pie and share with friends.  You'll want a few bites.  Overall, I'd go again.  And I wouldn't eat Popeye's the previous day like I did this time.  That likely skewed my rating.",3.0
"The food is tasty enough (even if overly buttered, especially the grits had way too much). It wasn't anything you couldn't get at the many other chicken and barbecue places across the city, without the trek into Bed-Stuy. The location is very small and they've crammed more tables than it is supposed to hold. Not only is this annoying as you have to get up from your table and pull it out for people to pass, but it's probably a fire hazard and they should be fined by the fire marshall. I witnessed them seat two fat women at a tiny table crammed against another table and sticking into the aisle, and one of the women only had half a bench seat to sit on (the bench was obviously designed to hold one less person so there would be space to, say, breathe. The wait staff made no apologies for the accommodations, so either they don't notice, don't care, or just don't understand the rules of actual southern hospitality. Funny for a place serving southern food.",2.0

We went with the fried green tomatoes ($7) which are served with bacon and barbecue aioli, a dish that lived up to its tempting description.The mashed potatoes ($3) were all you could ask for and were so creamy and moist that gravy was rendered unnecessary. The collard greens ($3) were standard.Peaches has a decidedly neighborly feel to it, and was very welcoming as you might expect southern hospitality to be. It is definitely the type of restaurant you find yourself going back to more than expected.",4.0
"After much delay, I finally made my way to Peach's. My cousin came from DC a few months ago and I wanted to take her here for brunch, but it was so full that we were forced to go to Williamsburg and eat at Pies & Thighs. Seriously, Peach's Hothouse has some of the best fried chicken I've had in my life, and that's saying a lot considering the women in my family are some chicken frying queens from Louisiana. I love the feel of this place and our waitress, Lisa was simply amazing. I've never been to a restaurant where a waitress actually sits down beside you and tells you about the menu. She told me she was originally from Germany, but she sure does have the southern hospitality aspect down. We ordered the southern charcuterie platter which consisted of fried bologna, pulled pork cooked in bacon fat, and andouille sausage. Fattening yes, but delectable in every way imaginable. We also got a fried tomato salad with arugula and bacon and bbq mayo dressing. My original instinct was just to order plain fried green tomatoes, but Lisa convinced me otherwise; the salad was good but I should'v'e stuck to my original plan as fried green tomatoes stand out by themselves. Now as for the fried chicken, they have 3 options: regular, hot, and extra hot. Now I love hot & spicy food, but I was not ready for the extreme amount of heat that the extra hot chicken had. Lisa warned me, but when most people tell me something is hot, I'm usually dismissive cause it's not really hot. This didn't apply to the situation. While it wasn't so hot that it ruined the flavor, you definitely have to be careful how you it cause you don't want it burning your lips or going down the wrong way. Even for me, I think I'll get the hot chicken. Comes with one side (I got mac & cheese which isn't as good as my homemade version, but very good nonetheless) and cornbread. I've been wanting to come here for a long time, but the wait definitely paid off and this will definitely be one of my staples. Every time a family member or friend comes from out of town to visit, I will have to bring them here.",5.0
"Just ate here this afternoon and loved it! I've been to the original Peaches and we were worried we would have to wait for a table there so we came here instead. Not too crowded and we were seated immediately. Server was great! Attentive but not hovering. I had the sangria which was strong and sweet followed by the BBQ shrimp w/ crispy grits and finished w/ chocolate brownie and ice cream. All the food was flavorful, good portions, and wait wasn't long.The menu is one of those ones where everything sounds delicious and I'll definitely be back to try the shrimp and grits, watermelon salad, french, toast, etc. I don't eat chicken/beef but I know they're known for their fried chicken. Overall great experience and only a block away from my house so this could be my new favorite spot.They also have a full bar and well made drinks so it might be worth it to stop by in the late evening for small plates and cocktails.",5.0
"Dined here for a Saturday night dinner. It was packed. Note to self and others: they do not take reservations and your group must be there to be seated.The food was amazing here. This place would have gotten a 5 if it was just based on food alone. I got the Hot chicken with a mac and cheese side. My boyfriend got a Boneless Beef short ribs with collard greens and cream grits. Let me tell you ...for the money, it's extremely worth it. The Beef short ribs melted like butter when you dug your fork in it. The Hot (Hot means Hot) Chicken was extremely moist and full of flavor. They give you three pieces and even the white meat was delicious. My boyfriend managed to finish it all for us both but just the entrees alone will be enough. We just wanted to try everything (esp with the price!). Also love the fact that I get my diet coke in a mason jar! Other specialty drinks are also served in mason jars. Didn't have a chance to try them but it seems like someone at every table ordered one of them. Service and organization was what disappointed me. The people were nice but it's hard to get their attention because they were always running around. It is a small restaurant and, when its cold outside, people who were waiting try to cram into the restaurant in the small aisle (sometimes invading diner's space).",4.0
"For the first time, I must say it is GREAT!!!  My mom had fried AND BBQ shrimp and she loved it!!",5.0
"Had dinner here with a girlfriend of mine two days ago and it being my first time having southern food it was a good experience.  The meatloaf I had was tender and the greens was well seasoned.  My friend was slightly disappointed that there was any candy yams on the menu but the bourbon frosted cake made up for it. I on the other hand enjoyed the cocktails, the bartender was cute too.",3.0
"Moving here from Alabama, I'd have to say they have their food juuuust right. Cornbread! Cornbread is like a status quo with where you food stands in ranking. Taste the cornbread and decide if you wanna eat the food!Vanilla?? IDK, but its fucking delish!I had the watermelon salad, which was lame compared to every thing else. BECAUSE! It was small and with goat cheese and arugula? Gimme a bowl of it and put salt on the fucker and call it good! Next was the Nashville shrimp. I dont know what that means, except damn good! Big shrimp, lightly breaded, and perfectly spiced. My side was asparagus. Good choice. I was drinking from Alex, he was good looking and easy going. Also made my suggestions, which were perfect!!I only want to talk about the -minus one star. Get rid of the slice of bread garnish, and . . . . you shall gain the 5th star!!",4.0
"3.5 starsI should preface this by saying I prefer hot wings to fried chicken.  We got an order of the hot and very hot despite the warning of the waitress.  Being a lover of hot and spicy, I was sure I would be able to handle it.  The hotness come from a rub which is hot enough to leave a lingering burn on your lips.  I liked it, but didn't want more than one piece of chicken.  Little too hot to enjoy a lot of it.  But the hot was not hot enough.  The skin was crispy (which I love) but I didn't give it 4 stars because I honestly didn't feel like there was enough flavor.  The meat was moist, but more bland than expected.  Maybe I have to try the regular next time.Oh- but order the shrimp.  That was fantastic.  And the fried bologna which was more like spam in my mind but the only other bologna I've had was Oscar Mayer.  Either way, it was juicy and flavorful.  (pickles on the side were a hit too)Sides-wise: agree with other reviewers that you can skip the mac n cheese.  I loved the kale and butterbeans.  The beans were smoky and delicious.  Give the fried green tomatoes a shot.  Crispy coleslaw (which is basically just coleslaw) was very peppery and a bit too much mayo for me.  But it was good to balance out the burning from the very hot chicken.  Potato salad was probably the best potato salad I've had but I'm not a huge fan so that may not be a fair judgement.   Dessert: apple blueberry pie.  YUM!  Get a slice of their pie and share with friends.  You'll want a few bites.  Overall, I'd go again.  And I wouldn't eat Popeye's the previous day like I did this time.  That likely skewed my rating.",3.0
"The food is tasty enough (even if overly buttered, especially the grits had way too much). It wasn't anything you couldn't get at the many other chicken and barbecue places across the city, without the trek into Bed-Stuy. The location is very small and they've crammed more tables than it is supposed to hold. Not only is this annoying as you have to get up from your table and pull it out for people to pass, but it's probably a fire hazard and they should be fined by the fire marshall. I witnessed them seat two fat women at a tiny table crammed against another table and sticking into the aisle, and one of the women only had half a bench seat to sit on (the bench was obviously designed to hold one less person so there would be space to, say, breathe. The wait staff made no apologies for the accommodations, so either they don't notice, don't care, or just don't understand the rules of actual southern hospitality. Funny for a place serving southern food.",2.0
"Very nice vibe, surprisingly uncrowded on an (early) Saturday evening.  Great cocktails too.  The ""hot"" (not ""very hot"") fried chicken was woo-hoo hot....I would agree with previous poster and get regular and doctor it to your own taste.  But that being said, that chicken was fantastic.  Catfish nuggets (more like fingers) were super fresh....whomever is manning that fryer knows what they are doing.  Sweet potato fries, ""crispy grits"", fried shrimp-- all were spot on.  Grilled broccoli was more steamed than grilled, chocolate cake more like a opund cake than the touted ganache.....but small quibbles in a great meal.   Definitely a must-return.",4.0
"Went for brunch today. Friendly server! Sweet bartender. Great bloody mary and mimosa. Yummy food--though I am kind of getting sick of this arugula / onion garnish they always put on. Time to think of something new, guys! Also, they tried to charge us $3.50 each for a ""bottomless cup of coffee,"" which we didn't know about because it wasn't written on the menu--plus we each only had collectively three cups of coffee. My date just declared that he wasn't going to pay $7 for two cups of coffee and the bartender just knocked one of them off the bill. Awesome.

"I have heard/read SO many good things, so one lazy Sunday when I didn't feel like cooking, I ordered take away. Hot chicken, potato salad, collard greens, and Mac n cheese. I do believe the take away was not as good due to the fact that it wasn't eaten right away, piping hot, so I will factor that in...Overall: food was ok. I could have cooked the sides WAY better - not the best I've ever had, and I based my choices on yelp reviews. You guys let me down :( I do believe (my opinion) that those who find this place just to die for, haven't had this kind of cooking before. I grew up on collards and potato salad - and I have had better (much better - never appreciated how good it was till now, when everybody swears by collards and kale all of a sudden - but not everyone can cook them well). It's funny. Wish my grandmother was here to see this. She would love to see how everyone is eating kale and collards nowadays like out of nowhere... when I was small, this was solely for 'certain' households (I'll just leave it at that). Basically, the collards weren't seasoned well. Neither was the potato salad. And the Mac was boring. They should have added some interesting cheeses to it, or something. I've had far better Mac from my other grandmother. It must be baked. I've just never been a fan if it unless it's baked - with bacon, loaded with goodies. That's how I likes it :)Anyway: the chicken lived up to the hype-ish. Even as takeaway, it was still madd crunchy. Didn't lose it's yummy. Again, not my favorite fried chicken, but good nonetheless. Medium heat was spiced well. Also the cornbread was ok too. Try it for yourself. You may find it absolutely delish or just a good meal for the moment...",3.0

Was comparable to Princes med to hot. If you want really hot, tell them you are from Nashville and to make it Nashville hot.  They will spice it up considerably for you.  I think this is great that the hot chicken is spreading. My wife had the jalapeño pulled pork and was yummy. So were the black-eyed peas. The fries were off the chain. I would love to come back and try the rice bowls, but since I am from Nashville, this will be difficult.

Fried green tomato salad, andouille sausage with mustard and crackers, Mac and cheese, mashed potatoes, and extra hot fried chicken with collard greens.

"Finally, somewhere in NYC that can actually make  decent fried chicken. I say finally because I've tried it at lots of places. I'll never understand how some of restaurants in NYC get credit for making ""good"" fried chicken. Peaches Hot House is the only place I've experienced that deserves such praise. They obviously use the method my family uses, which is a double buttermilk coating with seasoned flour. It's what insures an amazing crust that sticks to the chicken. It's good stuff, though I take issue with it because it seemed deep fried instead of pan fried (the deep frying insures an even frying but sometimes it over-fries portion of the chicken), but as I said it is still very good. They claim the extra hot stuff is incendiary, but I asked for extra hot sauce (I made the mistake of rubbing my eyes midway through the meal, which caused a temporary medical issue with my eye, notes to everyone, don't rub your eyes after eating the extra hot stuff!). The sides were equally good, the Kale and mashed potatoes were very fresh and delicious, much healthier than the usual Southern variety. The big let down was the cornbread, that was obviously prepared that morning and then heated up, it seemed like warm dry cake instead of hot moist cornbread. Perhaps the standout dishes of the evening were our appetizer and dessert. We ordered the fried green tomatos, they were amazing but they cheated and added bacon, which makes everything amazing right? The mustardy sauce that came with them was great, without the bacon they aren't as good as what we make back South, but I'll be damned what an innovation!!!! I'll be utilizing it myself the next time I make them. The dessert was wonderful, a double chocolate pound cake with fresh frosting. This was the perfect end to a heavy dinner, it made us even more full but in a great way. Delicious. Their drink list is excellent and they cleverly name their cocktails after great  Southern Blues and Jazz musicians, anywhere that names a drink after the great R.L. Burnside is cool in my book. My wife had a Billie Holiday which was amazing. Their beer list is small but very good, they have a range: an  IPA, a good Lager, a pilsner, a heffeweizen, and an excellent porter for after your meal. The staff was very friendly and highly efficient, we were never left unattended for longer than 5 minutes. Our drinks were always full and the meal came out fast. All in all I was really surprised by this place. It's a bit pricey for the neighborhood, but the food and service are worth it. If you'r a Southern expatriate or simply  enjoy Southern food give this place a shot. I'm sure you'll enjoy. Go early though because it is a very small space and by the time we left (7:30) there was a short line forming outside. Go though, and enjoy!!",4.0
"This place is my jam. Bed-Stuy has become my second home (I still love you Flatbush), and when I'm in the neighborhood my mouth instantly waters for mac and cheese, collard greens and hot chicken (and of course some whiskey to wash it all down).Plus, it's just got a good vibe. Good people behind the bar, good patrons, good food. What more can you want? READER BEWARE:I will say, I ordered the extra hot chicken once for delivery and managed to survive. barely. I am almost certain what I got was just the regular hot chicken, because...when I was in house and ordered just ONE piece of extra hot chicken, I died. No joke, my boyfriend and I couldn't finish the one piece. I cried, I turned bright red, a bit of my soul left my body. I actually ordered a glass of milk to ease my pain (the bartender didn't find this odd, so I must not have been the first to ask). It wasn't til hours later that I finally regained strength and ability to function as a normal human being. If you're into that sort of thing, just remember, I warned you.",4.0

It's good stuff, though I take issue with it because it seemed deep fried instead of pan fried (the deep frying insures an even frying but sometimes it over-fries portion of the chicken), but as I said it is still very good. They claim the extra hot stuff is incendiary, but I asked for extra hot sauce (I made the mistake of rubbing my eyes midway through the meal, which caused a temporary medical issue with my eye, notes to everyone, don't rub your eyes after eating the extra hot stuff!). The sides were equally good, the Kale and mashed potatoes were very fresh and delicious, much healthier than the usual Southern variety. The big let down was the cornbread, that was obviously prepared that morning and then heated up, it seemed like warm dry cake instead of hot moist cornbread. Perhaps the standout dishes of the evening were our appetizer and dessert. We ordered the fried green tomatos, they were amazing but they cheated and added bacon, which makes everything amazing right? The mustardy sauce that came with them was great, without the bacon they aren't as good as what we make back South, but I'll be damned what an innovation!!!! I'll be utilizing it myself the next time I make them. The dessert was wonderful, a double chocolate pound cake with fresh frosting. This was the perfect end to a heavy dinner, it made us even more full but in a great way. Delicious. Their drink list is excellent and they cleverly name their cocktails after great  Southern Blues and Jazz musicians, anywhere that names a drink after the great R.L. Burnside is cool in my book. My wife had a Billie Holiday which was amazing. Their beer list is small but very good, they have a range: an  IPA, a good Lager, a pilsner, a heffeweizen, and an excellent porter for after your meal. The staff was very friendly and highly efficient, we were never left unattended for longer than 5 minutes. Our drinks were always full and the meal came out fast. All in all I was really surprised by this place. It's a bit pricey for the neighborhood, but the food and service are worth it. If you'r a Southern expatriate or simply  enjoy Southern food give this place a shot. I'm sure you'll enjoy. Go early though because it is a very small space and by the time we left (7:30) there was a short line forming outside. Go though, and enjoy!!",4.0
"This place is my jam. Bed-Stuy has become my second home (I still love you Flatbush), and when I'm in the neighborhood my mouth instantly waters for mac and cheese, collard greens and hot chicken (and of course some whiskey to wash it all down).Plus, it's just got a good vibe. Good people behind the bar, good patrons, good food. What more can you want? READER BEWARE:I will say, I ordered the extra hot chicken once for delivery and managed to survive. barely. I am almost certain what I got was just the regular hot chicken, because...when I was in house and ordered just ONE piece of extra hot chicken, I died. No joke, my boyfriend and I couldn't finish the one piece. I cried, I turned bright red, a bit of my soul left my body. I actually ordered a glass of milk to ease my pain (the bartender didn't find this odd, so I must not have been the first to ask). It wasn't til hours later that I finally regained strength and ability to function as a normal human being. If you're into that sort of thing, just remember, I warned you.",4.0
"Food is ""okay"". I would've preferred to stay home and cook myself. The service here is terrible. It took about 15min just to get a soda. The waiter could not get the order right and seemed disinterested. Even the tap water was terrible and we were served with dirty glasses. I will not return.",2.0
I love fried chicken and this place is pretty good for a sit-in place.  The portions are pretty generous where you can spread to two servings.  The skin has the perfect kick of spiciness and the insides aren't dried.  Would I go out of my way again? Probably not.  Popeyes nearby is suffice.,4.0
"Ok, I've been back a few times since then.  The service is totally casual.  Which can be great.  But this last time, the service was just awful.  Forgetful and incompetent.  No water, no drinks, he forgot to order a side dish and when I asked him about it, he said he forgot but the kitchen is cleaning up, so he couldn't get it.It's in my neighborhood, and I think a lot of the clientele are locals, but they gotta step the service up.",3.0

"Peaches Hothouse is amazing for the chicken. The portions are ginormous (if you're moderately hungry I suggest sharing), and the sides are just great. The place is small, so we sat at the bar, and enjoyed our meal. There are some great beers on tap and the cocktails sounded equally inspiring. I started with the fried green tomatoes, which were totally on point. For my main, I went for the hot chicken, and we shared a bunch of sides. The grits were delicious as were the collards, but I was a bit unimpressed with the kale. Overall great food and great experience.

"I came to Peaches Hothouse for brunch with my BFF on Saturday afternoon, we were seated immediately an we were able to order pretty quickly. Our food took a long time to come out but our server did inform us that the kitchen was transitioning from brunch to dinner. When our food finally arrived OMG it was love at first bite. I ordered the shrimp hothouse sandwich and a side of mac and cheese and my friend had the hot chicken. The shrimp was tender and cooked perfectly, the mac and cheese was delicious. My friend loved the chicken she ate every piece. I can't wait to go back it was fantastic.",4.0
"Forgive me Peaches, for denying you your well-deserved review. A few months ago, I made my way to this cozy place. The regular chicken was crispy but not too greasy. I tried some extra spicy and everything I ate tasted spicy for a while after that... I heard you can ask for the Owner's Box if you want something even spicier than that! What's commendable is not only the great fried chicken, but also the above-average sides! We tried all the sides on the menu collard greens, grits, French fries, bacon creamed corn, asparagus, garlic kale, mac and cheese, and mashed potatoes... The collard greens were the biggest surprise. The texture was just right--- not too mushy, and the hint of spiciness gave it a little kick. And the bacon creamed corn, as the name suggests, was just amazing. And don't let those unassuming French fries trick you... they were crispy on the outside but soft on the inside. The grits and mac and cheese turned out to be the most underwhelming--they were ok, but the other sides were just so awesome that they paled in comparison.Wow.. I spent half of the review raving about the sides... but the entire meal was enjoyable! I also had some kind of blueberry lemonade that was awesome.",4.0
"Met some friends here on a Sunday evening for dinner and I was really impressed with the fried chicken. Some of the best I've had in the city, and I consider myself something of an expert. I got the regular, but the ""hot"" was also good. I was cautioned against the ""extra spicy"" as it can be a little too much for those of us who aren't spice enthusiasts. I also recommend the homemade hot sauce--though I don't normally enjoy hot sauce, it really added a nice kick to the chicken (not that it needed it). They also have a decent beer selection, and the prices are more than fair for the amount of food you get. Worth the trip out to Bed-Stuy, in my opinion!",5.0
"Really cute little restaurant in the middle of well..um..you'll see.  We were walking down the street on a muggy Saturday night, people BBQ'ing on the sidewalks, sitting out front chit chatting, just hanging out and then I see the restaurant before I even get to the corner. I say to my boyfriend, ""Oh, it's the place where all the White folks are.""  Yes, this was the only place that I saw within a mile radius where White people were sitting out front chomping down on food and chugging beer.  Let's just say, Peaches Hot House definitely stood out.  Not only that, but the waitstaff was White too.  Very strange for a neighborhood that was damn near 99% Black. It's funny that my boyfriend blended in more than I did once we stepped inside. But, yes, this was my first observation of the place. Oh and that the service was friendly and fun.I opted to go for the catfish with the Goddess dressing here and it was tasty, however the red rice tasted fresh out of a box of Zataran's. I barely touched the rice, but the blackened catfish was good.  I also tried the fried grits which came with three different dipping sauces. That was tasty and that sweet and moist cornbread was also fabulous. I was already kind of full from all those carbs before they brought out my main.  Good sweet tea with free refills!  Nearly a homerun meal but in order to finish off my night of gluttony,  we decided to share the double chocolate cake which came with a dollop of cinnamon whipped cream and fresh berries.  Now, that was a belly buster and fantastic to share. Even with three people, we still didn't finish the entire slice.All around good food, not so good sides, yummy dessert and good service. A-okay in my book!",4.0

The spicy doesn't have the seasoning mixed into the batter either. My boyfriend ordered it and it looked like they had just sprinkled a bunch of cayenne pepper on top.

I think their pulled pork is saucy and flavorful and should go with everything they've got. I liked their potatoes and grits, but I felt really ""ehh"" about the collard greens. Maybe they should let me take a peek back there. They serve some of the best bacon in the neighborhood, thick and cooked just crispy enough. The fried chicken is pretty wonderful too, served with a giant slab of egg bread and yummy bread and butter pickles. I like it spicy and they definitely deliver.

Seriously I adore fried chicken. After driving around for 1.5 hours looking for a good soul food place based on yelp reviews I came across this place. I went with the reviews posted here and ordered the fried chicken. BOY was I DISAPPOINTED!!!!Can we say overcooked; and I'm so confused as to why it was drowned in cayenne pepper after it was fried/ burnt. So not my cup of tea. The Mac n cheese was too thick and lacked taste. The collard greens were okay. Was this meal worth the 20 bucks? Heck no!

How is it appropriate for the owner to pull a waiter out of the restaurant and proceed to have a 20+ minute conversation (fight) out on the sidewalk. Meanwhile my party of four was without a waiter!!!! How does that make sense? Should I return to a place where chastising your employee is paramount?? Do that when your establishment closes. I won't be returning since Ben and Craig don't seem to think their customers are important. I only gave them one star because I had to give one. If I didn't have to they wouldn't have gotten that much.,1.0
"This place in my opinion was OK.  The chicken was decent, although the breading was a little more like KFC's- kind of thick, but not as thick as KFC.  It was seasoned well- and the ""hot"" isn't as spicy as some say...or maybe my spice tolerance is a little higher, but I don't think I have that much of a tolerance for spice.  Mac and cheese was okay as well...corn bread- i didnt really like as it was a little on the crumbly side.  Overall, the only word that sticks out in my mind to describe this place is ""OK""",3.0

I'm pretty fond of their egg scrambles, especially the North Carolina (pulled pork, pickled onions, and scallions). I think their pulled pork is saucy and flavorful and should go with everything they've got. I liked their potatoes and grits, but I felt really ""ehh"" about the collard greens. Maybe they should let me take a peek back there. They serve some of the best bacon in the neighborhood, thick and cooked just crispy enough. The fried chicken is pretty wonderful too, served with a giant slab of egg bread and yummy bread and butter pickles. I like it spicy and they definitely deliver. I've heard decent things about the burger and see above to know how I crave their pulled pork in all forms, including sandwich.All in all it's one of those neighborhood gems that deserves a place in the hearts of locals and visitors.",4.0
Seriously I adore fried chicken. After driving around for 1.5 hours looking for a good soul food place based on yelp reviews I came across this place. I went with the reviews posted here and ordered the fried chicken. BOY was I DISAPPOINTED!!!!Can we say overcooked; and I'm so confused as to why it was drowned in cayenne pepper after it was fried/ burnt. So not my cup of tea. The Mac n cheese was too thick and lacked taste. The collard greens were okay. Was this meal worth the 20 bucks? Heck no! I was severely disappointed...plus I wasted all that damn gas driving around.,2.0
"Mmmm mmmm.Peaches got it on point.  Ribs are amazing and the extra hot chicken really holds up to its name.Place is really small though, almost like walking into a closet.  But the food is worth it...or you can easily just pickup.",4.0
"Worth the trek to Bed-Stuy for the fried chicken, super tender yet crispy. Hot was more than enough, but if you're a hero go for extra hot. Had mine with mac n cheese which seriously wasn't anything to write home about (not sure where those ""it's crack"" tips from foursquare came from). Will be back for regular next time to avoid sweating profusely.",4.0
How is it appropriate for the owner to pull a waiter out of the restaurant and proceed to have a 20+ minute conversation (fight) out on the sidewalk. Meanwhile my party of four was without a waiter!!!! How does that make sense? Should I return to a place where chastising your employee is paramount?? Do that when your establishment closes. I won't be returning since Ben and Craig don't seem to think their customers are important. I only gave them one star because I had to give one. If I didn't have to they wouldn't have gotten that much.,1.0
"This place in my opinion was OK.  The chicken was decent, although the breading was a little more like KFC's- kind of thick, but not as thick as KFC.  It was seasoned well- and the ""hot"" isn't as spicy as some say...or maybe my spice tolerance is a little higher, but I don't think I have that much of a tolerance for spice.  Mac and cheese was okay as well...corn bread- i didnt really like as it was a little on the crumbly side.  Overall, the only word that sticks out in my mind to describe this place is ""OK""",3.0
"Time to set the record straight guys - after hearing all about this place I had to check it out.  Really enjoyed the fried green tomatoes appetizer.... ok, ok - let's get to the chicken.After reading some of the reviews here I got nervous - I pussyfooted and got the ""hot"" instead of ""extra hot.""  What a mistake.  I like spicy food, but I wouldn't say my tolerance was exceptionally high - and I personally found the ""hot"" not hot at all; hot in the way popeyes chicken is spicy.The ""extra hot"" definitely had kick to it.  The kind of kick that makes you tear a little bit, but in a good way.  I will definitely be getting the extra hot next time - and if you enjoy spicy food, don't fear and take the plunge!",4.0
"..i was in the area, and seen reviews on yelp. So i decided to give it a try. Place is actually pretty small, when we got there it was packed. We all ordered the chicken, we got regular, hot and extra hot..unless ur a fire breathing dragon dont get the extra hot it will melt ur face off! Chicken was actually pretty good, it had a nice little sweet taste with spice. Our sides was corn, fries, and mac & cheese (it wasnt baked) so didnt care to much for it. Corn bread i really enjoyed..ordered a drink which was great..actually ordered 2..oh yeah since the extra hot chicken was to spicy the waitress was kind enough to exchanged it for us. I would return",5.0

"They fry chicken very, very well. The result: bone-in, tender, juicy pieces coated in a crispy, flavorful batter seasoned with black pepper and, I believe, celery salt.

Besides the chicken, my side of broccoli was unimpressive: wet, salty, with too many chunks of garlic stuck to it.

"I've been wanting to go to this joint for a minute - who wouldn't salivate at the thought of ""EXTRA HOT!"" chicken that comes with its' own warning? - and was glad when the opportunity arose to hang with a good friend.When I walked in & looked around I was pleasantly surprised that the Hothouse wasn't as uncomfortably tiny as some reviews led me to believe. Yea, it's small but cozy small, and not on that deceiptful devil of a realtor ""cozy"" tip that means you can't do a jumping jack within knocking into a wall tiny, it's just cozy as in comfy, not claustrophobic. It was dimly lit and a server was sitting at the bar happily chowing down on something from the menu. Always a good sign!Once seated by a very warm server with a strong Southern accent but who's really from Philly named Marvin (who knew Philly was bamma?), our waiter, Alex, introduced himself. I recognized Alex right away from the Peaches on Lewis ave & was impressed that tho I haven't even been in Brooklyn for nearly 5 months, Alex remembered my name! (cue theme music from ""Cheers""). Yea, it was like that.Anyhoo, I was only there for the ""EXTRA HOT"" chicken so I looked at the menu only to see what kind of dessert I was gonna stuff myself with after. As I fixed my mouth to order, my dinner companion warned me that as he'd been to India for an extended length of time & thus knew from ""hot"" he felt comfortable warning me away from the ""EXTRA HOT"" as it had succeeded in playing him by numbing his lips & bringing tears to his eyes. Usually info like that would make more eager to ""bring it on!"" but I felt very. afraid.So, I went for the ""Hot"" instead. Dear Yelpers, I'm the kinda home cook who puts cayenne on every non-sweet dish & has a personal relationship with curry. I could attribute it to my Jamaican heritage but who really knows? All I'm sayin is, I'm a chick who digs some heat. When our orders came, I woried that maybe it woudn't be hot enough. There were 3 pretty big pieces of chicken & I could see the spices. I could also see the crunchiest chicken ever, which my teeth confirmed when I bit into it. How they do that there?I mean, the crunch was crazy! The flavor was dutifully spicy but I gotta say, it didn't blow me away. Like another reviewer mentioned, the spice didn't seem to be infused into the actual meat. Not that it was bad mind you, but all the fun was in the skin.When I mentioned to my friend & Alex that maybe I could've done with more spice, Alex brought me a piece of the ""EXTRA HOT"" chicken & yelpers, I could SMELL that bad boy from practically a foot away! Now that's what I'm talkin about! This piece also looked different, more red I think. It was just as crunchy as the ""Hot"" but this piece was: juicier, more flavorful & the SPICE! yea mon! It made my lips tingle but not burn, it played with my tongue, but not badly, it, in effect, is what I should've ordered first. I must also mention something incredibly weird: the pickels. How the hell does something as side orderish random as pickles, taste so incredibly good? What was that all about? I mean, I almost wanted to ask for more.For my side dish I had the creamy grits. It came with sliced scallion on top. It was creamy, a little lumpy, but bland. A nice shake of salt &/or pepper would've done it some good.Finally dear yelpers, by doggy bagging it, I was able to save room for dessert. I ordered the bourbon brown butter cake. It arrived with a side of vanilla cream. The cake was warm, moist & delicious. It had a nice strong shot of bourbon in it, making the whole thing quite yummy.I'd love to go back & order other items as my friend told me that many of the other dishes are also quite good & the smells wafting from my fellow diners plates would seem to affirm what he said. So, all in all, a great experience!",4.0
"About a little more than a month ago, Yelper Laura A asked me in a compliment,  "".... Peaches HotHouse? .. haha. Wonder if you hear about it. Its said the spiciest chicken ever..""  Spiciest?  Did she just mentioned the word spiciest?  She sure knows how to ping my interest.  No, I did not know about Peaches Hothouse before then but after looking it up on Yelp and seeing the many positive reviews, I definitely know about it now.  For the next few weeks, I thought about trying this place quite frequently and one day, I was able to gather two of my friends to accompany me to this establishment.Walking into the homely corner restaurant, one of the first things that you'll notice is that this place is pretty small, seating about 30ish patrons max.  Despite us being there on a weekend at what is considered dinner time for most people, we were able to be seated immediately.  Our server was this super polite young man with an actual southern accent.All three of us decided on getting their signature dish, the Nashville style hot chicken but at various levels of spiciness.  I of course went after the ""extra hot"" ( with the accompanying warning on their menu ""Caution! EXTRA HOT is extremely spicy.  There.  We warned you"". How could I resist after they wrote that? ) while one friend ordered the ""hot"" and the last one ordering ""regular"".  This selection is very reasonably priced at $12 for 3 large chicken pieces, a thick slice of egg bread, 3 slices of pickles and 1 side of your choosing.I have to say that so far, this is the best fried chicken in NYC in my opinion, beating out even the ever popular Pies and Thighs.  In my review for Pies and Thighs, I mentioned that even though I really liked their fried chicken, the one thing that was holding it back from perfection was that it needed more seasoning.  The fried chicken at Peaches Hothouse have the same super crunchy battered skin and moist meat as Pies and Thighs but solves the seasoning problem.  Even the ""regular"" flavor needed no condiment to accompany it.  It was great the way it was cooked.  The ""hot"" was mildly spicy while the ""extra hot"" was spicy enough to make my nose run a little but not enough to make me think it's intolerable.  People that still think it's a bit too spicy, the accompanying egg bread goes a long way to tone down the heat.  It's is indeed the spiciest fried chicken that I have tried in NYC outside of a few buffalo wings served at some restaurants.For our 3 sides, we decided on:Bacon cream corn:  So creamy and good with the added richness of bacon bits and bacon flavor in the cream.French fries:  A nearly perfect version of shoe string fries.  Crispy outside but with a soft starchy interior.Mashed Potatoes.  It was good but nothing out of the ordinary.The pickles slices deserve a mention too.  Sightly sweet and sour, it was like no pickle I had anywhere else yet.  It was good and even my pickle hating friend ate it all.  The server told me that they buy the pickles from somewhere and then they add their own flavor to it to give it that extra unique taste.For my drink, I selected this off the menu item that I believe was called a ""mint blueberry smash"" or something.  It was basically a lemonade like concoction with whole mint leaves and whole blueberries to give it a minty blueberry twist.  Another winner.  I couldn't stop drinking it.  Well actually, I did stop drinking it a few times, but only because the blueberries kept on getting stuck in my straw and I had to eat it out.Everything was going grand and we were thoroughly enjoying the meal so we decided to end it with a Triple Brownie Vanilla Ice Cream for dessert.  Gasp... it wasn't that good.  This was our only disappointment.  The flavor was fine but the brownie texture was all wrong.  It was more of a cookie than a soft brownie. A HARD cookie. All in all it was a great meal.  I liked this place so much that I decided to select the place for my first Unofficial Yelp Event in Brooklyn, possibly introducing 30 or so Yelpers to Peaches Hothouse.  This is when I found out that they don't take reservations.  Doh....  I guess everyone on Yelp have to discover this place on their own instead.  It's certainly worth the trek here.  It's the best damn fried chicken in NYC with or without the spiciness.I read in another review that you could even make it spicier by telling them to make it hotter.  Not sure how true that is but hey, I'm definitely going to give it a try. Watch me go back there real soon. =DNashville Hot Chicken: 5 Bacon Cream Corn: 5French Fries: 4.5Mashed Potatoes: 3.5Triple Brownie Vanilla Ice Cream: 2.5Overall 4.5Heat level of the hottest fried chicken from a scale of one to five, five being the hottest. 4",5.0

It comes with three pieces, which is a good size for $12.00.  I had the hot chicken, not extremely hot, or whatever it's called, because the waiter compared it to, ""I hate you hot."" The hot was spicy enough. I got the crispy grits which were DIVINE and a side of mac and cheese to share with my friend. I wish the mac and cheese had been baked a bit. I felt like it was something akin to velveeta (sorry guys) and therefore didn't leave an amazing impression on me. I also got a drink...something thompkins, which was tasty as well. My friend and I split the apple pie for dessert. The pie slice was large, pretty and tasty, although I have had better pie. Believe me, anything apple is my favorite and this apple wasn't singing to me, but it was good. I think hands down my favorite thing was the cornbread. It smelled like cake. It was warm and wrapped in a piece of parchment paper which was the perfect way to start the meal. One star goes hands down to the corn bread. One star goes definitely to the chicken. Breading aside, was super moist inside. I mean RIDICULOUSLY super moist inside. I also like that the chicken is free range, local chicken. I ate a happy chicken, well before it was killed, so I am therefore happy! Two stars go to the service, and the set up. It's a bit small inside, but I love the decor and the feeling of the restaurant. As a matter of fact, you never feel like you're in a restaurant, you feel like you've been transported to a shack, with style, somewhere in Alabama. One of the two stars goes to the fact that they had killer blues playing. I'm a lover/sucker for blues music, especially when I'm eating fried chicken. I'll be back. For that corner seat in the window with the pillows. And for another piece of hot chicken. YUM!",4.0
"If you love fried chicken but can't stand the dirty little hipsters at Pies n' Thighs in South Williamsburg, you can keep in real in Bed-Stuy at Peaches HotHouse.I was immediately excited by the prospect of having my fried chicken without a side of  flannel, skinny jeans, and irony. There are some great Southern touches throughout the restaurant: old glass bourbon bottles reclaimed as water carafes, wood shingles on the walls, an actual screen door separating the kitchen from the dining room, and a sign above the kitchen proudly stating ""Liquor in the Front, Poker in the Back."" (It took me a while to process the double entendre.)The meal started out with a piping, hot slice of cornbread which I dutifully slathered in butter. Afterwards, I ordered the fried green tomatoes with bacon and barbecue mayo. It was a very Traif-like dish, with the smoky bacon and pungent mayo immediately asserting their flavors, while the fried tomato (nearly molten out of the fryer) contributed a nice acidic kick.Admittedly, I wussed out on the extra hot chicken, but having my face sweat off like a fat man at Russian banya had absolutely no appeal to me. Instead, I ordered a mixed trio of mild and hot pieces. For the fried chicken connoisseurs: - The chicken is fried at a high temperature, so there isn't a residual pool of grease like what you'd get at Pies n' Thighs. - Nevertheless, when you bite into the chicken, it's pure steam and chicken jus.- The crust is very similar to the texture of the Mama Els' chicken at Hill Country: crunchy, crumbly, with a consistency of similar to a soft, buttered graham cracker, except it's laced with a dusting cayenne pepper and brown sugar. I would go here more often but unfortunately it's quite a trek from Park Slope. Here's to hoping that the owners get the brilliant idea of opening a Peaches HotHouse next door to their already popular Smoke Joint in Ft. Greene.",4.0

"This restaurant is delicious, reasonably priced, has great friendly staff, and fun ambiance.  Arrive early to avoid crowds!Eat this: fried chicken (only get the 2nd highest level of spicy unless you intend to sweat flames for 3 days), fried shrimp, meatloaf.

"We live around the corner so we've eaten here a few times. The sides and drinks are the highlights. The mains, especially the chicken, are well done, but nothing spectacular. All of the sides are spot on, some good enough to eat by themselves. The drink menu is creative and happy hour is a great deal. If you want spicy chicken, the hottest on the menu will burn your entire G.I. tract. It must have ghost pepper in it.The ambiance is great for a neighborhood restaurant. Over the past year it's been filling up with hipsters from Friday to Sunday, especially for the weekend brunch, and lines can get long. Since they don't take reservations it's best to show up well before you want to eat, or come from Mon.-Thur.",4.0
"I've been wanting to go to this joint for a minute - who wouldn't salivate at the thought of ""EXTRA HOT!"" chicken that comes with its' own warning? - and was glad when the opportunity arose to hang with a good friend.When I walked in & looked around I was pleasantly surprised that the Hothouse wasn't as uncomfortably tiny as some reviews led me to believe. Yea, it's small but cozy small, and not on that deceiptful devil of a realtor ""cozy"" tip that means you can't do a jumping jack within knocking into a wall tiny, it's just cozy as in comfy, not claustrophobic. It was dimly lit and a server was sitting at the bar happily chowing down on something from the menu. Always a good sign!Once seated by a very warm server with a strong Southern accent but who's really from Philly named Marvin (who knew Philly was bamma?), our waiter, Alex, introduced himself. I recognized Alex right away from the Peaches on Lewis ave & was impressed that tho I haven't even been in Brooklyn for nearly 5 months, Alex remembered my name! (cue theme music from ""Cheers""). Yea, it was like that.Anyhoo, I was only there for the ""EXTRA HOT"" chicken so I looked at the menu only to see what kind of dessert I was gonna stuff myself with after. As I fixed my mouth to order, my dinner companion warned me that as he'd been to India for an extended length of time & thus knew from ""hot"" he felt comfortable warning me away from the ""EXTRA HOT"" as it had succeeded in playing him by numbing his lips & bringing tears to his eyes. Usually info like that would make more eager to ""bring it on!"" but I felt very. afraid.So, I went for the ""Hot"" instead. Dear Yelpers, I'm the kinda home cook who puts cayenne on every non-sweet dish & has a personal relationship with curry. I could attribute it to my Jamaican heritage but who really knows? All I'm sayin is, I'm a chick who digs some heat. When our orders came, I woried that maybe it woudn't be hot enough. There were 3 pretty big pieces of chicken & I could see the spices. I could also see the crunchiest chicken ever, which my teeth confirmed when I bit into it. How they do that there?I mean, the crunch was crazy! The flavor was dutifully spicy but I gotta say, it didn't blow me away. Like another reviewer mentioned, the spice didn't seem to be infused into the actual meat. Not that it was bad mind you, but all the fun was in the skin.When I mentioned to my friend & Alex that maybe I could've done with more spice, Alex brought me a piece of the ""EXTRA HOT"" chicken & yelpers, I could SMELL that bad boy from practically a foot away! Now that's what I'm talkin about! This piece also looked different, more red I think. It was just as crunchy as the ""Hot"" but this piece was: juicier, more flavorful & the SPICE! yea mon! It made my lips tingle but not burn, it played with my tongue, but not badly, it, in effect, is what I should've ordered first. I must also mention something incredibly weird: the pickels. How the hell does something as side orderish random as pickles, taste so incredibly good? What was that all about? I mean, I almost wanted to ask for more.For my side dish I had the creamy grits. It came with sliced scallion on top. It was creamy, a little lumpy, but bland. A nice shake of salt &/or pepper would've done it some good.Finally dear yelpers, by doggy bagging it, I was able to save room for dessert. I ordered the bourbon brown butter cake. It arrived with a side of vanilla cream. The cake was warm, moist & delicious. It had a nice strong shot of bourbon in it, making the whole thing quite yummy.I'd love to go back & order other items as my friend told me that many of the other dishes are also quite good & the smells wafting from my fellow diners plates would seem to affirm what he said. So, all in all, a great experience!",4.0
"About a little more than a month ago, Yelper Laura A asked me in a compliment,  "".... Peaches HotHouse? .. haha. Wonder if you hear about it. Its said the spiciest chicken ever..""  Spiciest?  Did she just mentioned the word spiciest?  She sure knows how to ping my interest.  No, I did not know about Peaches Hothouse before then but after looking it up on Yelp and seeing the many positive reviews, I definitely know about it now.  For the next few weeks, I thought about trying this place quite frequently and one day, I was able to gather two of my friends to accompany me to this establishment.Walking into the homely corner restaurant, one of the first things that you'll notice is that this place is pretty small, seating about 30ish patrons max.  Despite us being there on a weekend at what is considered dinner time for most people, we were able to be seated immediately.  Our server was this super polite young man with an actual southern accent.All three of us decided on getting their signature dish, the Nashville style hot chicken but at various levels of spiciness.  I of course went after the ""extra hot"" ( with the accompanying warning on their menu ""Caution! EXTRA HOT is extremely spicy.  There.  We warned you"". How could I resist after they wrote that? ) while one friend ordered the ""hot"" and the last one ordering ""regular"".  This selection is very reasonably priced at $12 for 3 large chicken pieces, a thick slice of egg bread, 3 slices of pickles and 1 side of your choosing.I have to say that so far, this is the best fried chicken in NYC in my opinion, beating out even the ever popular Pies and Thighs.  In my review for Pies and Thighs, I mentioned that even though I really liked their fried chicken, the one thing that was holding it back from perfection was that it needed more seasoning.  The fried chicken at Peaches Hothouse have the same super crunchy battered skin and moist meat as Pies and Thighs but solves the seasoning problem.  Even the ""regular"" flavor needed no condiment to accompany it.  It was great the way it was cooked.  The ""hot"" was mildly spicy while the ""extra hot"" was spicy enough to make my nose run a little but not enough to make me think it's intolerable.  People that still think it's a bit too spicy, the accompanying egg bread goes a long way to tone down the heat.  It's is indeed the spiciest fried chicken that I have tried in NYC outside of a few buffalo wings served at some restaurants.For our 3 sides, we decided on:Bacon cream corn:  So creamy and good with the added richness of bacon bits and bacon flavor in the cream.French fries:  A nearly perfect version of shoe string fries.  Crispy outside but with a soft starchy interior.Mashed Potatoes.  It was good but nothing out of the ordinary.The pickles slices deserve a mention too.  Sightly sweet and sour, it was like no pickle I had anywhere else yet.  It was good and even my pickle hating friend ate it all.  The server told me that they buy the pickles from somewhere and then they add their own flavor to it to give it that extra unique taste.For my drink, I selected this off the menu item that I believe was called a ""mint blueberry smash"" or something.  It was basically a lemonade like concoction with whole mint leaves and whole blueberries to give it a minty blueberry twist.  Another winner.  I couldn't stop drinking it.  Well actually, I did stop drinking it a few times, but only because the blueberries kept on getting stuck in my straw and I had to eat it out.Everything was going grand and we were thoroughly enjoying the meal so we decided to end it with a Triple Brownie Vanilla Ice Cream for dessert.  Gasp... it wasn't that good.  This was our only disappointment.  The flavor was fine but the brownie texture was all wrong.  It was more of a cookie than a soft brownie. A HARD cookie. All in all it was a great meal.  I liked this place so much that I decided to select the place for my first Unofficial Yelp Event in Brooklyn, possibly introducing 30 or so Yelpers to Peaches Hothouse.  This is when I found out that they don't take reservations.  Doh....  I guess everyone on Yelp have to discover this place on their own instead.  It's certainly worth the trek here.  It's the best damn fried chicken in NYC with or without the spiciness.I read in another review that you could even make it spicier by telling them to make it hotter.  Not sure how true that is but hey, I'm definitely going to give it a try. Watch me go back there real soon. =DNashville Hot Chicken: 5 Bacon Cream Corn: 5French Fries: 4.5Mashed Potatoes: 3.5Triple Brownie Vanilla Ice Cream: 2.5Overall 4.5Heat level of the hottest fried chicken from a scale of one to five, five being the hottest. 4",5.0
"They're known for their fried chicken, specifically their ""extra hot"" fried chicken, and for that reason we went.  B. is into the spicy food, me less so, so I got the plain and he got the dish that comes with a warning.Both were really great, but the extra hot isn't playing.  It is literally blisteringly hot.  Use the same caution when touching your lips or other sensitive spots as you would having just touched a habanero pepper.  Seriously.The food was great and reasonably priced, the place was cute, and the menu tempting with other non-fried chicken items that will require a second (and third...) trip.",4.0

"WOW. This place is amazing! Yes, it takes a little while to get your food, but that's what you get when you are NOT getting fast food (they make the chicken to order and locally source as much as possible). If you want fast, MSG seasoned, hormone-filled chicken then go to Kennedy Fried Chicken.What to get:- Fried Chicken Medium heat. I read quite a few reviews that claim the mild chicken is flavorless, but the medium heat chicken was great! -Their grits with BBQ Shrimp- OH MY GAWWWWD - the creamiest best flavored grits I have ever had!!!

"There are only a handful of restaurants in Bed Stuy quite like Peaches Hothouse on Tompkins Avenue. Sure, there's Saraghina and a few others pushing an artisanal ethos through an emerging (though underserved) neighborhood, but Peaches Hothouse, from the owners of The Smoke Joint and Peaches (proper), is surely the only place where you can find an approximation of Nashville fried chicken shack in the middle of Brooklyn.Inside is cramped, and you may find yourself uncomfortably close to your neighbor (but this is OK-- strike up a conversation, or better yet, challenge the manhood of the guy on a date sitting next to you in a hot chicken-off). At peak times, Peaches can be packed full and understaffed (you've been warned). If you're less inclined to ruin someone else's meal, order a beer or a drink (""likker"" as they call it) and wait for your fiery chicken to arrive while grooving to the blues blasting over the speakers.Like I said, Nashville hot chicken is the star. Peaches' version appears to be much less greasy than its inspiration, (but it is served with pickles and bread). I've never tried the original (and regret not doing so since I've been to Nashville), but the hot chicken far surpassed my modest expectations (and usual heat tolerance). To obtain the requisite ""extra hot,"" I recommend you order with a serious stare that alerts your server to the fact that you are a serious person who is not to be fucked with.The chicken arrives entombed in a dark crust heavily dusted in brown sugar and cayenne pepper. The first bite sets the tone, and steaming juices compound the wave of pure heat that envelops your lips, turning your face a flushed red (at least that's how Steve looked while chowing down on the drumstick). I kid, but I probably looked worse.If ordering your chicken extra spicy, don't be a fool. Eat it with something creamy. Crispy grits-- fried cubes of grits served with a ""spicy"" aioli help somewhat-- especially since it's the supposedly spicy mayo that tames the chicken's heat. Even better is the creamed corn with bacon. It could use slightly more pepper, but that's a minor complaint.Collard greens are also a standout. They have a strong, vegetal funk, with an undercurrent of sweetness. Add their housemade hot sauce for maximum effect, especially once ""hot"" becomes relative after the chicken.I've had less success with the rest of the menu (shockingly, the burger is one of the only items I have yet to try). Shrimp po' boy is fine, but pales in comparison to the one at Cheeky (not their fault, the bar has been set high). The pulled pork sandwich is solid, but not nearly as good as my waiter led me to believe.Brunch is also served on weekends. I've only tried two of their ""scrambles,"" but beyond the quality ingredients, neither was more exciting than something I could make at home (yeah, that statement could describe brunch nearly anywhere in town). Just go for the hot chicken and you'll be happy. No Brooklyn bias here-- Peaches probably wouldn't set Manhattan on fire (besides the hot chicken), but in Bed Stuy it's the perfect neighborhood spot that would be welcome anywhere.",4.0
"I heard about Peaches Hothouse being touted as the ""hottest Fried Chicken in NYC"" so I sent an email out immediately to my friends and within minutes we made a date for Sunday brunch.On this faithful Sunday, it was pouring outside and I hesitated going all the way to Bed-Stuy for some fried chicken knowing full well the typhoon like winds and the rain that comes in sideways would thoroughly drench me.  I texted my friends and they said they were still game.So off I went with my umbrella to take the F to the A and then the 10 minute walk to 415 Tompkins Ave.The area is still rather desolate and I easily picked the spot were my friends were waiting inside all warm and cozy.  Luckily, they had a nice table roomy enough for me to slide in as the whole place was already brimming with people savoring brunch or fried chicken.We immediately decided on the plates, my friend opting for extra hot while my other friend and I opted for hot but we would split the dishes between us.  The $12 plate came with a side and unfortunately, mac n' cheese is only served during dinner.  Our waitress recommended I go for the bacon creamed corn which she said is a good compliment to the fried chicken as it soaks up the spiciness.  My friends ordered collard greens and vegetable dish which I don't remember the exact name.The dishes arrived and we were surprised at the amount of food served to us: 3 large pieces of fried chicken served on top of bread.  The fried chicken depending on the level of hotness came in various shades of red and brown.  I ordered a glass of milk just in case I would burst into tears.We split our plates up so we had extra hot and hot  and we immediately dug in. Compared to my tolerance of spicy food, extra hot fried chicken didn't do much damage to me.  I was able to eat the whole thing in addition to my second piece of hot fried chicken.  The girls cleaned their plates but I thoroughly enjoyed my bacon creamed corn and debated whether or not I should order another dish but my friend recommended I save room for dessert.The waitresses were impressed then I asked for apple pie a la mode.  The dish took awhile to arrive but around that time, it was 2:30 and the brunch crowd were filtering in so it soon became standing room.  It was nice the waitstaff didn't rush us which I appreciated a lot since a lot of establishments tend do that during nor were the patrons giving us the death stare to let us know to move it along.I really enjoyed the atmosphere and the friendly waitstaff.  I definitely have to come back for dinner which my friends agreed because I really want southern mac n' cheese!",4.0

"Is this spot a buck or 2 pricier than what I think it's worth?  Maybe.  But when I have an out of town guest that I want to see weep like a little girl I don't hesitate to take them to this spot.  While some might say the chicken is too hot, I don't buy it.  One recent brunch with 3 friends had 2 of us ordering the extra hot chicken.  Needless to say it ended with 3 of us in tears and me not being able to feel anything in a 3 inch diameter around my food hole.Some notes:*The food outside of the chicken is good also.  *The coffee is pricey.  *The mixed drinks and green fried tomatoes are awesome.*The grits that come with the catfish end up coming off a little more like hominy, but that's ok, because I think traditionally (at least in my experience) hominy is what's served with catfish.  *The waitresses are great at what they do.",5.0
"Ah, to schlep (Sorry, it actually wasn't all that far, just being a city snob) all the way out to Bed-Stuy for some eats, it was worth the adventure and the experience.  The food is great.  The service is super friendly and welcoming.  The place is definitely Nashville Chic if there is such a thing, complete with Hatch Show Print art work direct from the source.  (Hatch Show Print is an old skool letter press company that does posters for over a 100 years in Nashville).  We celebrated the wife's birthday here, just the two of us.  We both got the chicken (HOT).  It was definitely conjuring up the memory of sweating it out at Prince's Hot Fried Chicken in Nashville.  We loved it!  The sides of bacon creamed corn and mac n cheese were perfect accompaniments.  The corn bread was really good as well, especially since it was served warm.  There are other soul food classics on the menu that have potential as well since we saw them on other tables.  The fried shrimp, grits and spare ribs all looked delicious.  The bourbon brown butter cake for dessert was complete heaven.  Didn't think we could stuff it in, but why not.  The server was totally cool.  He told us that he had dropped our left over wing that was about to be wrapped, so they fried us up a new one.  Sweet!  And it was really delicious the next morning as well.  All the heat is built right into the crust.  There are also a nice list of cocktails on the menu as well.",4.0
"Yo La Tengo was right to write 3 songs about hot chicken. They should do an entire concept album about Peaches. Not only was the chicken moist and deeply flavorful beneath the shatteringly crisp and generously spiced crust, but there just wasn't a miss in any other dish we ordered. Fried green tomatoes? Excellent. BBQ Shrimp? A revelation. Bourbon cake and apple-raspberry pie for dessert? Yes. Yes, more of all of that please.Add honestly friendly service and a surprisingly deep selection of American whiskeys to the above and serve over a self-consciously but not gimmicky faux-dive decor.",5.0

"This review will have 2 parts: the first, about a really good Nasvhille-style chicken joint in Bed-Stuy; and the second, about a near-death experience I had in said place.From the same guys that run Peaches on Lewis Ave, Peaches HotHouse is a no-fuss but comfortable eatery that serves southern hits.  While spice and hot sauce is a common condiment to southern classics, suffice to say that the traditional fried chicken dish can be expected to be a relaxing eat.But if you're not savvy to what Nashville-style fried chicken is, then here's where part 2 comes in...That bird was goddamn HOT!Your spice choices consist of Mild, Hot, and Extra-Hot, and each plate of chicken (3 large pieces per order) can include any combination.  I had two hot and one extra-hot.THAT BIRD WAS GODDAMN HOT!!The ""hot"" was just the right amount of heat, and that heat went well with the tender meat and flavorful skin.  It was better than KFC skin! which is no easy feat!  (Did I just have a ghetto moment?  Oh, well!)  It was a heat that enhanced and made spoonfuls of a bacon creamed corn all the better.But that extra-hot was fucking lethal!  I was convinced that my tongue was turning black and was shriveling in my mouth.  My vital organs were throbbing and somehow, my trachea caught on fire from next-door esophagus so that even breathing was excruciating.   I sweated tears of agony through every pore in my body.  My lips and even fingertips were numb for quite some time after the meal.Fortunately, that was only within the first few bites.  It gets more manageable after that spice hazing.Basically, if you're into chicken and near-fatal amounts of spice, then come on down to Peaches HotHouse!",4.0

Yes, it takes a little while to get your food, but that's what you get when you are NOT getting fast food (they make the chicken to order and locally source as much as possible). If you want fast, MSG seasoned, hormone-filled chicken then go to Kennedy Fried Chicken.What to get:- Fried Chicken Medium heat. I read quite a few reviews that claim the mild chicken is flavorless, but the medium heat chicken was great! -Their grits with BBQ Shrimp- OH MY GAWWWWD - the creamiest best flavored grits I have ever had!!! Such a wonderful surprise!!! I think this should be their featured dish.- Their hot sauce.....can they bottle it and sell it? PRETTY PLEASE? - Bourbon cake - SOOO worth the extra carbs :D",4.0
"There are only a handful of restaurants in Bed Stuy quite like Peaches Hothouse on Tompkins Avenue. Sure, there's Saraghina and a few others pushing an artisanal ethos through an emerging (though underserved) neighborhood, but Peaches Hothouse, from the owners of The Smoke Joint and Peaches (proper), is surely the only place where you can find an approximation of Nashville fried chicken shack in the middle of Brooklyn.Inside is cramped, and you may find yourself uncomfortably close to your neighbor (but this is OK-- strike up a conversation, or better yet, challenge the manhood of the guy on a date sitting next to you in a hot chicken-off). At peak times, Peaches can be packed full and understaffed (you've been warned). If you're less inclined to ruin someone else's meal, order a beer or a drink (""likker"" as they call it) and wait for your fiery chicken to arrive while grooving to the blues blasting over the speakers.Like I said, Nashville hot chicken is the star. Peaches' version appears to be much less greasy than its inspiration, (but it is served with pickles and bread). I've never tried the original (and regret not doing so since I've been to Nashville), but the hot chicken far surpassed my modest expectations (and usual heat tolerance). To obtain the requisite ""extra hot,"" I recommend you order with a serious stare that alerts your server to the fact that you are a serious person who is not to be fucked with.The chicken arrives entombed in a dark crust heavily dusted in brown sugar and cayenne pepper. The first bite sets the tone, and steaming juices compound the wave of pure heat that envelops your lips, turning your face a flushed red (at least that's how Steve looked while chowing down on the drumstick). I kid, but I probably looked worse.If ordering your chicken extra spicy, don't be a fool. Eat it with something creamy. Crispy grits-- fried cubes of grits served with a ""spicy"" aioli help somewhat-- especially since it's the supposedly spicy mayo that tames the chicken's heat. Even better is the creamed corn with bacon. It could use slightly more pepper, but that's a minor complaint.Collard greens are also a standout. They have a strong, vegetal funk, with an undercurrent of sweetness. Add their housemade hot sauce for maximum effect, especially once ""hot"" becomes relative after the chicken.I've had less success with the rest of the menu (shockingly, the burger is one of the only items I have yet to try). Shrimp po' boy is fine, but pales in comparison to the one at Cheeky (not their fault, the bar has been set high). The pulled pork sandwich is solid, but not nearly as good as my waiter led me to believe.Brunch is also served on weekends. I've only tried two of their ""scrambles,"" but beyond the quality ingredients, neither was more exciting than something I could make at home (yeah, that statement could describe brunch nearly anywhere in town). Just go for the hot chicken and you'll be happy. No Brooklyn bias here-- Peaches probably wouldn't set Manhattan on fire (besides the hot chicken), but in Bed Stuy it's the perfect neighborhood spot that would be welcome anywhere.",4.0
"I heard about Peaches Hothouse being touted as the ""hottest Fried Chicken in NYC"" so I sent an email out immediately to my friends and within minutes we made a date for Sunday brunch.On this faithful Sunday, it was pouring outside and I hesitated going all the way to Bed-Stuy for some fried chicken knowing full well the typhoon like winds and the rain that comes in sideways would thoroughly drench me.  I texted my friends and they said they were still game.So off I went with my umbrella to take the F to the A and then the 10 minute walk to 415 Tompkins Ave.The area is still rather desolate and I easily picked the spot were my friends were waiting inside all warm and cozy.  Luckily, they had a nice table roomy enough for me to slide in as the whole place was already brimming with people savoring brunch or fried chicken.We immediately decided on the plates, my friend opting for extra hot while my other friend and I opted for hot but we would split the dishes between us.  The $12 plate came with a side and unfortunately, mac n' cheese is only served during dinner.  Our waitress recommended I go for the bacon creamed corn which she said is a good compliment to the fried chicken as it soaks up the spiciness.  My friends ordered collard greens and vegetable dish which I don't remember the exact name.The dishes arrived and we were surprised at the amount of food served to us: 3 large pieces of fried chicken served on top of bread.  The fried chicken depending on the level of hotness came in various shades of red and brown.  I ordered a glass of milk just in case I would burst into tears.We split our plates up so we had extra hot and hot  and we immediately dug in. Compared to my tolerance of spicy food, extra hot fried chicken didn't do much damage to me.  I was able to eat the whole thing in addition to my second piece of hot fried chicken.  The girls cleaned their plates but I thoroughly enjoyed my bacon creamed corn and debated whether or not I should order another dish but my friend recommended I save room for dessert.The waitresses were impressed then I asked for apple pie a la mode.  The dish took awhile to arrive but around that time, it was 2:30 and the brunch crowd were filtering in so it soon became standing room.  It was nice the waitstaff didn't rush us which I appreciated a lot since a lot of establishments tend do that during nor were the patrons giving us the death stare to let us know to move it along.I really enjoyed the atmosphere and the friendly waitstaff.  I definitely have to come back for dinner which my friends agreed because I really want southern mac n' cheese!",4.0
"I am biased!  I LOVE this place!  The greens are outrageously good, the drinks superb, the food... oooh oooh oooh! Sorry, I forgot that this is a public space, I'll stop moaning online.  Did I mention that I love this place!",5.0
"Is this spot a buck or 2 pricier than what I think it's worth?  Maybe.  But when I have an out of town guest that I want to see weep like a little girl I don't hesitate to take them to this spot.  While some might say the chicken is too hot, I don't buy it.  One recent brunch with 3 friends had 2 of us ordering the extra hot chicken.  Needless to say it ended with 3 of us in tears and me not being able to feel anything in a 3 inch diameter around my food hole.Some notes:*The food outside of the chicken is good also.  *The coffee is pricey.  *The mixed drinks and green fried tomatoes are awesome.*The grits that come with the catfish end up coming off a little more like hominy, but that's ok, because I think traditionally (at least in my experience) hominy is what's served with catfish.  *The waitresses are great at what they do.",5.0
"Ah, to schlep (Sorry, it actually wasn't all that far, just being a city snob) all the way out to Bed-Stuy for some eats, it was worth the adventure and the experience.  The food is great.  The service is super friendly and welcoming.  The place is definitely Nashville Chic if there is such a thing, complete with Hatch Show Print art work direct from the source.  (Hatch Show Print is an old skool letter press company that does posters for over a 100 years in Nashville).  We celebrated the wife's birthday here, just the two of us.  We both got the chicken (HOT).  It was definitely conjuring up the memory of sweating it out at Prince's Hot Fried Chicken in Nashville.  We loved it!  The sides of bacon creamed corn and mac n cheese were perfect accompaniments.  The corn bread was really good as well, especially since it was served warm.  There are other soul food classics on the menu that have potential as well since we saw them on other tables.  The fried shrimp, grits and spare ribs all looked delicious.  The bourbon brown butter cake for dessert was complete heaven.  Didn't think we could stuff it in, but why not.  The server was totally cool.  He told us that he had dropped our left over wing that was about to be wrapped, so they fried us up a new one.  Sweet!  And it was really delicious the next morning as well.  All the heat is built right into the crust.  There are also a nice list of cocktails on the menu as well.",4.0
"Yo La Tengo was right to write 3 songs about hot chicken. They should do an entire concept album about Peaches. Not only was the chicken moist and deeply flavorful beneath the shatteringly crisp and generously spiced crust, but there just wasn't a miss in any other dish we ordered. Fried green tomatoes? Excellent. BBQ Shrimp? A revelation. Bourbon cake and apple-raspberry pie for dessert? Yes. Yes, more of all of that please.Add honestly friendly service and a surprisingly deep selection of American whiskeys to the above and serve over a self-consciously but not gimmicky faux-dive decor.",5.0

"This review will have 2 parts: the first, about a really good Nasvhille-style chicken joint in Bed-Stuy; and the second, about a near-death experience I had in said place.From the same guys that run Peaches on Lewis Ave, Peaches HotHouse is a no-fuss but comfortable eatery that serves southern hits.  While spice and hot sauce is a common condiment to southern classics, suffice to say that the traditional fried chicken dish can be expected to be a relaxing eat.But if you're not savvy to what Nashville-style fried chicken is, then here's where part 2 comes in...That bird was goddamn HOT!Your spice choices consist of Mild, Hot, and Extra-Hot, and each plate of chicken (3 large pieces per order) can include any combination.  I had two hot and one extra-hot.THAT BIRD WAS GODDAMN HOT!!The ""hot"" was just the right amount of heat, and that heat went well with the tender meat and flavorful skin.  It was better than KFC skin! which is no easy feat!  (Did I just have a ghetto moment?  Oh, well!)  It was a heat that enhanced and made spoonfuls of a bacon creamed corn all the better.But that extra-hot was fucking lethal!  I was convinced that my tongue was turning black and was shriveling in my mouth.  My vital organs were throbbing and somehow, my trachea caught on fire from next-door esophagus so that even breathing was excruciating.   I sweated tears of agony through every pore in my body.  My lips and even fingertips were numb for quite some time after the meal.Fortunately, that was only within the first few bites.  It gets more manageable after that spice hazing.Basically, if you're into chicken and near-fatal amounts of spice, then come on down to Peaches HotHouse!",4.0
"Well hello there, Peaches (HotHouse version).  You wined and dined us real nice.  You gave me everything that I, a good Southern boy living just around the block from you, needed from a good Saturday brunch: grits, a blackberry cocktail, and of course, The Cosby Show playing in the background, with some India.Arie unobtrusively serenading us to into a sweet, sweet food coma.  Your staff was friendly and timely, and your food delicious.  It's just small enough with just good enough acoustics for it to feel intimate yet social.  Where did you come from, and can you bring some of your friends?Since I'm living just a few steps away, I expect we'll become BFFs shortly.  I look forward to our future photo album of great memories.",5.0

The double smoked bacon was also tasty and my friend had the Lo Country scrambled eggs with lump crab meat, which was also delicious.I have no complaints about this place.

"Recently in New York, Brooklyn has become a popular hotspot in terms of housing, bars, and restaurants. All of the restaurant reviewers that I have been following have blogged about the up and coming restaurants in Brooklyn, raving about the innovative interior and the delicious food served. So I, too, have been widening my range of restaurants by visiting places located elsewhere from my local town Queens and Manhattan, branching out to Harlem and to Brooklyn. One of the restaurants that I dined in was noted in Yahoo for having the spiciest chicken in NYC, and I couldn't help but to head over and try some of their infamous hot chicken.From the name itself, Peaches Hothouse advertises the extreme heat that they use to cook their food. Amanda and I walked in through the restaurant and it was evident that Peaches Hothouse specialized in traditional southern food. We were seated immediately in the small restaurant as our waiter quickly explained the menu: Peaches Hothouse prides themselves in their Nashville Style hot chicken, which is what attracts diners in the first place. Our waiter further explained that there were three degrees of spiciness for the hot chicken, from regular, hot, then to extra hot. Fully relying on our Korean heritage and our distinct abilities to handle spicy food well, we ordered the extra hot chicken, sending our waiter into a state of shock. According to him, female diners like us were the ones who were daring enough to order the extra hot while the male diners who accompanied them settled for the regular. As a side for our extra hot chicken, we asked for a milder flavored corn on the cob. Apart from the chicken, we also ordered the fried shrimp po' boy with aside of crispy grits. Shortly after ordering our food, our waiter brought out two Arnold Palmers (  1/2 iced tea,  1/2 lemonade) unique glass jugs and freshly baked cornbread. I have a tendency to judge southern restaurants by their cornbread, and Peaches Hothouse impressed me from the start with their warm cornbread. Sweet and crumbly, I had to ask for more of this delicious cornbread as we waited for our food. When our food came out, both of us weren't too shocked at the look of the extra hot chicken. Sure, it was perfectly cooked - the fried skin of the chicken looked extremely crispy and it was clear that they knew a thing or two about frying chicken. But what disappointed us was how unintimidating the chicken looked in terms of its spiciness. Nonetheless, we dug in and soon realized how wrong we had been. Peaches Hothouse's extra hot chicken is really extra hot. Although we couldn't see it, the entire fried chicken breast was dusted with Cajun pepper, making it one of the spiciest chickens I've ever had. Taking one bite of this chicken brought tears to our eyes and we had to continuously ask for refills to alleviate the feeling from our mouths. After we recovered from the extra hot chicken, we moved onto the shrimp po' boy. Everything about this dish was perfect: the shrimp was fried perfectly, the bread was toasted well, and the dressing was a great accompaniment to the sandwich as a whole. The shrimp po' boy, hands down, had all of the components in making a great southern dish.  The sides that we ordered were delicious as well, both the crispy grits and the corn on the cob were perfectly seasoned. Peaches Hothouse gave both of us a spicy food experience that we will never forget, and there's no doubt as to why they were listed as having the spiciest chicken in NYC. Although their chicken was extremely spicy, it was also extremely delicious and tender. Commuting to Brooklyn is tedious and the train ride is lengthy, but Peaches Hothouse makes all of this completely worth it by providing quality southern food. I strongly recommend Peaches Hothouse if you're willing to have a mind-blowing, tongue numbing experience, and if you can handle their hot chicken.",4.0

Food was outrageous.  I had the blackened catfish and ordered a side of mashed potatoes with gravy that would normally go on the meatloaf.  Beyond.  So delicious.  The only reason I'm not giving it five stars is because the waiter asked if I wanted to sit at the bar and seemed annoyed when I said I wanted a table (I was dining alone).  My cocktail was also delicious - I had the Sippie Wallace.,4.0
"Delicious. But, upon our second visit at 2:30 on a Sunday afternoon to order take out,  we were told they were taking no more orders because they were ""too busy"". REALLY? WOW! Well, I guess this IS Bed-Stuy. Proving once again, the ghetto is still the ghetto.-meh. I won't be back. It wasn't THAT good.",2.0
"This place was on Eater's list of top 12 fried chicken dishes in the city and they definitely earned it.  I went with a group of friends and we ordered all three styles- regular, hot, and very hot.  We were all happy.  I got three big pieces (a breast and two drumsticks).  Cooked perfectly- crunchy, and juicy.  I like plain, non-crunchy mac and cheese so I was happy with theirs.  The fried grits were good as well.  And topping it on if with the bourbon pound cake was a good way to finish up the evening.  They have an interesting selection of mixed drinks if you go at dinner time.  And the waitress was funny and attentive.",5.0
"mmmmm Fried Chicken, Peaches has some of the best. I do agree with other reviewers that the hot isn't very hot. The extra hot, however, lives up to its namesake. The creamed corn is exceptional but the last time I went they didn't have it. It does get crowded, especially on weekends, so sometimes we will order to go and pig out in our car in front of the hood liquor store. The hostess can be really annoying yelling throughout the restaurant sometimes but otherwise this place is delicious. It looks like they've added some new things to their menu that i'll have to go back and try.",4.0
"Just returned from spending a week in NYC.  My son who lives in Brooklyn wanted us to try this place.  It was crowded, very small space.  We did have to wait a while, but the very friendly staff checked in with us every few minutes assuring us that they would seat us as soon as possible.  It was worth the wait, the food was fantastic.  The food is southern, comfort style food that your grandma (if she was from the south) would cook.  Order the Fried Green Tomatos with bacon and arugula, you won't regret it.  Next time I'm in NYC I will go there again.",5.0

"I stopped by Peaches yesterday for an impromptu brunch break and thoroughly-enjoyed myself.  The atmosphere is relaxed, casual and (I don't want to use this word but I can't think of a better one so...) hip.  The staff seems to be solely made up of beautiful young women of varying ethnicities, orientations, etc. (if there were men working there I did not notice.  Sorry, guys.) and the food is great.  I had a giant meatloaf sandwich (seriously, you will not be able to finish it in one sitting and believe me, I tried; it's delectable) a refreshing lemonade which wasn't overly-sweetened as is the case at other joints and my friends and I shared both sweet potato fries and regular fries; I recommend the sweet potato fries.  I hope to visit next weekend and try the fried chicken.",4.0
"Ehh,  I wouldn't recommend running here. I went for brunch with a friend a couple months ago. There are very limited options in the Bed Stuy area, so I was thrilled to try it. I had the fried chicken (of course) , grilled asparagus and potatoes . It was a good dish,.. not hardly the BEST ever. I haven't tried it since and I live 3 blocks away. My friend had the trout or salmon.. (can't remember) & he kept picking at MY plate. Not that it sucks.. just wasn't spectacular to me. However, the drinks are amazing. Very strong.. just how I like it :)The space was a bit awkward. I felt claustrophobic since the tables have no room between. It was pretty packed when I went on a Sunday.  Cash only - as well. Honestly. There are no options in Bed Stuy, so residents are delighted to have somewhere to go. 5 Stars, in my opinion, is awfully high. Don't go with the same expectations I had.  But try the chicken.. it supposedly is their best dish.",3.0
"Finally... a peaches that's walking distance!! Chicken cobb salad is the best salad I've ever tasted. Cornbread is delicious... more like pound cake. Po Boy is great too, but wish they had oyster po boy as indicated on the menu.They also need to bring back the sweet and spicy bk wings... a peaches favorite. They use to have them, but depending on the waiter, they either never had them, it's just a special, or they're out. There's a great waiter and waitress there... always happy to see them and tip them well for their exceptional service, even though it's just take-out.Got the penne a la vodka special once... I'll be weary of trying their specials from now. It was just ok. If you find something you love here, stick with that.

"This place is great. Fried chicken is perfection, don't get it EXTRA hot if you want to actually eat it, or try ONE piece extra hot so you can say you had it. We love this place, the beer selection is good, it's a nice spot to hang out and enjoy some good food and good beers/drinks.",4.0
"Been here 4 times.....The Fried Chicken is really good. If it was name ""Fried Chicken Peaches"" I would've given it 5 stars......I think it's better than 'Pies N Thighs' but you really can't compare the two (differently fried). The drinks taste ok but they taste like moonshine, so you pretty much gonna be really buzzed lol. The dessert is really good (Burboun pound cake). I noticed that these types of Southern spots usually have GREAT comfort desserts *greedy grin* reason they only got four stars is cause of the wait..........I'm very impatient.......and the space; imma tall guy so the slim tables were a huge issue for me....but if you don't care about all that and just want fried chicken make the trip.",4.0

They also wrote about the family and the excellent pie...so I added that to my bill and was not disappointed.

"At this moment in time, Peaches is my favorite fried chicken place here in NYC. I have had it a few times now, and last night after class, I rolled up and ordered 2 more orders to go...

I am a big eater, so I get 2 orders... after all, i'm a Man, and 3 pieces is probably a little small in my opinion...I have enjoyed my chicken here each and every time. By the time I was home, it was only slightly warm and STILL amazingly delicious!!My son had some ribs he enjoyed. We like the cornbread, for sides, the mashed potatos and the mac and cheese are very good.Nice sweet tea.OK service, small place... otherwise, I would have given them 5 stars.I'll continue to head over here on a regular basis.Not cheap, but i'm willing to pay for quality.",4.0
"I like it super spicy, so I got the extra hot. It was spicy as hell. At one point I was unsure if the chicken was hot to the touch or if my mouth was just scared to go back for more.

Recently went here on a Saturday night because my husband had a craving for fried chicken.  He seemed to really enjoy it but I thought it was just okay.  The biggest disappointment for me was how sweet the fried chicken was.  I ordered hot thinking it would have a nice kick to it and it was extremely bland.  All I could taste was sugar.We also had the side of bacon potato salad which was great.  The mac & cheese was gross.  It was dry and bland like they just melted cheese over pasta in the microwave.Drinks were fantastic! I highly recommend the Billie Holiday.,3.0
"Read the reviews, and since I'm around the corner, I decided to try takeout.

It isn't cold, but a little less than warm, which tells me my food was dying in the window ( I'm one block away). The shrimp were cook perfectly, but they weren't hot. The crispy grits were just weird.  I grew up on grits, and that was just weird. Maybe they would have been better if they were hot. The cornbread tasted more like cake and was delish. The slice of bread was kinda hard on top, like it's been sitting out. And the sweet pickles made the end of dinner almost alright. Ill go back, but dining in. And going to try the chicken.",3.0

"After spotting this place on the Dine In Brooklyn spread and checking out their menu, what started as calm anticipation blossomed into full grown juvenile excitement.I headed there with the girl (she made us reservations for 8:30).  When we arrived it was quite apparent that the reservations were not necessary, but we were told a few hours before it was quite crowded.  Regardless, reservations are a good thing as I forecast this place gets big.The lovely waitress greeted and sat us.  Currently, they don't have their liquor license so we brought some lovely beer to pair with our dinner.We placed our order.(1) Watermelon Salad to start(2) Fried Chicken (Spicy) and a side of Crispy Grits for the man(3) Shrimp and Grits for the womanWatermelon Salad was quite delicious and refreshing.  Fresh arugula was the base.  The watermelon paired so well with the lime and ginger it was fantastic.  Ginger pieces added a nice touch.Crispy Grits were crunchy on the outside and smooth and creamy on the outside.  Sprinkled with some sort of red pepper for that lovely touch of heat.What I had of the Shrimp and Grits was sweetness.  Grits were creamy and well seasoned.  The mushroom cream sauce was gravy like and mushroom heaven.  It was obvious the shrimp was fresh and not from a bag.Now, finally the fried chicken.  The macaroni salad was nice since lethal levels of mayonnaise were not used.  The chicken meat was so juicy.  Unfortunately, the batter with the spice had an odd sour aftertaste.  Maybe too much buttermilk, or spice?  The non-spice version probably has potential and the fried chicken was decent in terms of flavor.  It was just a little off.All in all a great experience.  Fun wooded decor and sparsely decorated with exciting black and white pictures of people having a good time.  Go here.Love,Joe",4.0

"Went to Peaches yesterday for the first time with my boyfriend and friends.  My bf can definitely be classified as a Fort Greene snob lol/so venturing out into Bedstuy was definitely a stretch; however Peaches Hothouse did not disappoint!!!

"Holy smokes, did I love my meal at Peaches HotHouse! When I signed in to write this review I was SHOCKED that there were any negative reviews. The space is small, but so inviting. The waitstaff were extremely friendly and sweet, which always really impresses me in this city. And the FOOD, goddamn! The fried green tomatoes were like heaven. And my ""regular"" fried chicken was just perfect. I'm not really even a big fried chicken fan, even though it's a ""thing"" in NYC right now (red meat, please), but this blew my mind! Crispy, well spiced, tender flavorful meat under the crust,and it really didn't seem greasy to me at all. And the portion is ginormous. My leftovers will make two more meals. My garlic kale was also delish, and a nice side of healthiness to the fried chix. The only thing that was weird was the big hunk of bread under the chicken...unnecessary. Oh, and Mr. Andy Lee got the ""extra hot"" chicken, and almost passed out. The waiter gently warned him...but of course he wouldn't back down. I can't imagine he enjoyed his meal because he was huffing and puffing and sweating in pain. But, if you like to torture your face, this chicken is for you. I can't wait to go back and try everything on the menu (except the extra hot)!!!",5.0

"Peaches HotHouse, you made my night today.You must understand, I have been planning to get in this place for weeks now. Maybe even months. I even went into the sister restaurant (Peaches) thinking it was the same one that I saw on the Cooking Channel ( it wasn't ).Finally, I made it, and I was not disappointed. Well, not entirely. The ambiance of this front is less frou frou than the sister restaurant, more casual, comfy, a cool place to kick back and relax- if there's enough room for you. It seems like a mere 36 people give or take can fit in here, which makes waiting for a table slightly uncomfortable. Once the waiting was over, the real event began. The chicken..the big heaping plate of chicken was soooo overwhelming. Initially, 12 bucks for 3 pieces of chicken seems steep, but this is CHICKEN. Like, Fred Flintstone like chicken. Big old dookie piles of chicken. Crazy. We ordered the hot variety, but there's also no spice or extra hot for the adventurous types. Flavor wise, the meat was super succulent and juicy. I will say, that I was not a fan of the actual crusty bits. I'm a freak for texture, so it could be just me. It was spicy, but not enough for my Jamaican blood. My sides for the evening were garlicky kale (yes), bacon creamed corn (YES), the surprisingly awesome crunchy grits ( I'm not big into grits, but these were super super yum..mega YES) and mac & cheese. Didn't have too much of the latter, but I could tell that this was way above Velveeta quality, and maybe a little bit less awesome than your granny's ( or mom's...or sister's....you get it) To top this already awesome experience off, I had a tasty beer called Mother's Milk, and the staff friggin' rocks! My friends and I totally hit it off with the two waiters, so much so we got Facebook deets afterwards. One could really tell that they enjoy what they do, and enjoy making the customer experience everything it should be. Bang on guys. So yes, I would totally come back here, if not for the rocking sides, but for the awesome people that make Peaches what it is: A super friendly, super stuffing Southern food journey.",4.0

"Peaches Hothouse blows Pies-n-Thighs out of the water. I know Bed Stuy may be intimidating to the hipster droves of Williamsburg, but this place does Southern well, and moderately priced. I took my mother who loves Southern (and is usually skeptical about my restaurant recommendations) to Peaches, and she enjoyed her meal of spicy chicken, vegetarian collards (a welcome change from the hammock-addled mess that finds its way to family holiday meals), and Mac & cheese. Not being a poultry eater myself, I rather enjoyed my shrimp po boy, Mac & cheese, and a very STRONG bourbon cocktail. Also appreciate the drive towards supporting local and free range products--you don't get that at a lot of southern eateries. Seems Peaches is well supported by local Bed-Stuyers (fellow brown people), which was very reassuring as to its quality. Only quip was speed of service, but as their chalkboard said, good food isn't fast and fast food isn't good. Too true! Will definitely go back, order an appetizer to bide my time with, and try to save room for dessert!",4.0
"Peaches Hothouse is awesome. It was the first dining/drinking establishment I patronized when I moved to Bed Stuy.The atmosphere is very cozy and the chicken is great, I would recommend getting it hot or extra hot if you like spicy food. I think brunch is a great time to eat at Peaches but so does everyone else in Bed-Stuy so either show up as soon as they open or expect an hour long wait(hence the 4 stars). The service is pretty good, the hostess made me comfortable while waiting, she gave me (free) coffee as I waited outside. On the flip side, Peaches is good for drinks. I had 3 generously poured Jack Daniels(dont judge me) for just $18. Can't beat it. Love, love, love Peaches!",4.0
"The Nashville-hot chicken sounded lovely on a breezy weekend so I made my way over to Bedstuy. I started off with the fried green tomato appetizer - interestingly topped with bacon. I couldn't resist ordering. I'm not sure what I imagined but it came to me as, i believe it was, four fried green tomato slices...covered by a small salad, which itself was criss-crossed with 2 slices of bacon. It was tasty but the fried green tomatoes cld have done with a but of seasoning for the breading. I ordered next the fried chicken (hot). First off it wasn't too hot (but then again I like things spicy). The portion size was quite generous! It looked so tasty I paused to appreciate it before digging in. First bite: crunchy, moist, yummy and a bit of spice. It is not the best I've ever had (I am from the deep South after all) but it was respectable and enjoyable. I did wish for a bit of salt or seasoned salt worked into the batter/breading...Also had a drink, served in sort of a jelly glass which I LOVED. I like the sort of ""juke joint"" feel of the place...casual and relaxed. I felt like I was at my grandmother's down south during a family reunion when the cool part of the family comes and starts playing their music and hitting the table yelling and playing cards or dominoes...this wasn't happening at Peaches, it wasn't loud or rowdy, but it felt like the sort of place u cld get comfortable and feel at home in! Free of pretense. All in all I enjoyed. Oh and the wait staff was attentive but not bothersome.  I look forward to visiting again..and again...",4.0
"""Fast food aint good & good food takes time"" was their motto, but I wouldn't know because they took so much of my time that I never got to the food. I joined yelp specifically to write how completely offensive the ATROCIOUS service was at Peaches HotHouse. My boyfriend & I went here for 'brunch'. I ordered a bloody mary. Inexplicably, the waitress took 10 min to make it (instead of the 2 other people behind the bar who stood uselessly, one of them pointlessly wrapping silverware in napkins when there was already a massive pile of already prepared silverware) It was busy, but you couldn't tell based on the zero activity level of the waitstaff. We then ordered our food, which the waitress didn't write down, along with 2 coffees. It took  an unnecessary amount of time for the coffee to come, the people next to us asked for their check before our coffee came & the waitress apologized to them for not bringing it before abruptly turning back because she realized she had it under her arm. INCOMPETENT. The next party seated ordered coffee but never got cream & borrowed ours for the remainder of the agonizing hour of life we wasted there. We started noticing that nearly everyone arriving after us was getting their entrees before us. My boyfriend went to the counter to ask what was up, & was told, ""it depends on if you ordered the chicken,"" which he did, but so did the other 3 groups served before we were (which he told them). A few minutes later (at this point, at least 45 minutes in, we were visibly agitated) the waitress asked me what I ordered (?!?!) then said our orders were about to be up. Another 10 minutes later, a completely different person served our food. I bit into my 'North Carolina"" scrambled eggs, which were disgusting, & PLAIN. Told the waitress I didn't think it was what I ordered & she said ""You're right, those are plain, this order is for the people next to you (the second party to arrive after us & be served before us) did you touch them?"" as she asked this I was munching on a single potato square, which is the only thing I got to eat. My boyfriend replied somewhat jokingly, ""Yes, it's very touched,"" to which she responded ""WHATEVER THAT MEANS. This order is for the people next to you. I wish you had told me before you touched it."" UMM, WHAT? Why would we think that an order nearly identical to ours being served to us wouldn't be ours when they got there 20 minutes prior to this? Why did everyone around us wxcept for us get served? After she said this we decided it was so offensive we couldn't stay. At least I got a free bloody mary out of this time suck & the coffee was actually REALLY good.",1.0

"We almost left. We walked in, looked at the menu, and was not impressed. None of us saw anything on the menu that was vaguely interesting - forget the mouth watering. I had seen Peaches on Food Network but forgot why they were being featured. After spending hours in line to take my grandchildren to see the Statue of Liberty, we were more than a little hungry so we were looking forward to going to Peaches. (We're from MD). Well let me tell you, when we looked at that menu it was like someone let the air out of us. But I was hungry and I didn't want to try to find someplace else to eat so I asked my 11 year old granddaughter if she saw ANYTHING on the menu that she would settle for. She said sure. She could eat the fried shrimp. Then I asked the 7 year old who declared she could eat the shrimp too. The 16 year old still wasn't looking impressed. I looked at the menu again and saw the fried chicken. That's when I remembered why they were featured on Food Network. So I decided to get the spicy chicken. My daughter doesn't eat fried chicken so I knew that was a no go for her. I suggested the blackened catfish to which she replied she didn't like blackened food. Ugggghhhh!!!! I asked the 16 year old if she would eat the fried chicken. She reluctantly agreed. My daughter was really having a hard time but finally agreed to get the blackened fish at the encouragement of the waitress. After ordering, I went to the bathroom to wash my hands. Let me tell you, that was the cleanest bathroom I'd ever seen in any NY restaurant. That made me feel a little better. Fast forward to the food. It was the BOMB!! The fried chicken was crispy, crispy and more crispy. And juicy! Cooked to perfection. I love spicy food but I only got 1 piece of the extra hot cause I wanted to enjoy the food not numb my taste buds and I didn't know how spicy was spicy. It was spicy but not to. Just perfect as far as I'm concerned. The  shrimp was very good. They don't have cocktail sauce. Instead they make a homemade aioli. It was delicious. My daughter, the one that doesn't like blackened food, inhaled that catfish. It was GOOD! The collard greens had just the right amount of kick and the cornbread was very good. Even the french fries were good. Needless to say, we all walked out of Peaches quite satisfied and with big stupid smiles on our faces. We all decided Peaches deserved another visit. Soon. If you're looking for fancy, don't waste your time. If you want good food and some of the best fried chicken I've ever sank my lips into, don't miss Peaches.  You will not be disappointed.",4.0

I love spicy food but I only got 1 piece of the extra hot cause I wanted to enjoy the food not numb my taste buds and I didn't know how spicy was spicy. It was spicy but not to. Just perfect as far as I'm concerned. The  shrimp was very good. They don't have cocktail sauce. Instead they make a homemade aioli. It was delicious. My daughter, the one that doesn't like blackened food, inhaled that catfish. It was GOOD! The collard greens had just the right amount of kick and the cornbread was very good. Even the french fries were good. Needless to say, we all walked out of Peaches quite satisfied and with big stupid smiles on our faces. We all decided Peaches deserved another visit. Soon. If you're looking for fancy, don't waste your time. If you want good food and some of the best fried chicken I've ever sank my lips into, don't miss Peaches.  You will not be disappointed.",4.0

"Ever go to place and everyone is ordering the same thing, but its brunch so you want something brunchy?....Yeah....I should have had the chicken....Because brunch here (specifically their egg dishes).....I can't even put it nicely....was absolutely disgusting....and while I FELT like throwing up, my friend actually DID throw up her food....so now I also question the cleanliness and preparation of the disgusting food we had.I considered going back to this place to try out their lunch or dinner menu...but the fact my friend's body simply rejected the food....there is something WRONG...and I'm not going to give this place a chance to make me throw up.....",1.0

The mac and cheese is good.  I'm sure it has some smoked gouda in it...love it!  They give you three pieces which I wasnt able to finish..doggy bag, of course.  I also had a drink.  I forgot the name of the drink but it was interesting.  It was lemonade, bourbon ( i believe), ginger, mint and blueberries.All in all...the staff was personable and friendly.

"I love Peaches restaurant and decided to try to the HotHouse with my younger cousin. I ordered the fried chicken (since it seemed like their specialty) with side orders of kale and mac n cheese.

The fried chicken was okay, did not like the seasoning they put on top of it and it kept getting in my nose lol.

"I'd give them two stars but they ruined my man's b-day so one star it is! Take that, 4.5 average.Peaches Hot Mess.Okay, so the Hubs was dying for some Nashville Hot Chicken so we headed here, ordering the fried green tomatoes, regular chicken, the fried whiting, collard greens, and creamy grits. The cornbread arrived first, too sweet and tasting like the box I suspect it was shaken out of. Okay. We sip our Cokes and listen to R&B. And listen to R&B. About 12 songs in, Hubby crankily announces that we have been waiting 50 minutes for food. I somehow distract him for another 20 minutes until the food comes. The fried green tomatoes were acceptable; covered with too much bacon and sauce, yes, but fine. The creamy grits had a distinctly 'off' taste, like moldy cheese. The collard green were bland and limp. My whiting was a shockingly small portion, like three fish sticks that might be served to a cranky todder in Park Slope and while my husband's chicken was adequately sized, it sucked. There was a sour quality to the batter (excessive vinegar or buttermilk or, you know, rot) and it tasted burnt. It was so over-battered, that we removed the batter in a whole piece and it sat there accusingly, like a mad soft shell crab.

"Great restaurant where the chicken is prepared to order. The complimentary cornbread was sweet, moist, and buttery.  I had the fried green tomatoes, which was encrusted in cornmeal flour, served on a bed of arugula and drizzled with a tangy dressing.  I thought the tomatoes were sour (are they supposed to taste that way?), but the arugula and dressing were delish.  I couldn't place the dressing though.   I ordered the peach tea cocktail.  Not a fan.  The sweet tea completely overwhelmed the peach schnapps. For my entree, I had the hot fried chicken with mac and cheese and a side of collard greens.  I made a HUGE mistake ordering the hot chicken.  My mouth was on fire immediately.  I sheepishly asked for the regular version, which I found to be nicely seasoned and piping hot - unlike Amy Ruth's bland, old refried chicken. The mac and cheese was okay, but the collard greens were much too salty.  I couldn't finish them.  DH ordered the creamed corn (YUM).  The sweetness of the corn went well with the cream and bacon.  That night, the restaurant was really busy; our server was both serving patrons and mixing drinks, so we didn't get as much attention as I would've liked.  We had the bourbon cake, which was dry, tasted nothing like bourbon, and didn't have much icing.  Bummer.  I really look forward to dessert.  All in all, it was a solid meal.",4.0
The is the best spicy fried chicken i ever tasted. It even beats Popeye's.,5.0
"Their food is so amazing. I would have to say that it's the most southern restaurant in the city that i have ever experienced. Everything about this place is great, the people, the food, and the comfort that they give you.",5.0
"I really couldn't ask for a better neighborhood restaurant.  The hot fried chicken with a side of bacon creamed corn and a Mother's Milk stout is one of my favorite meals in the city.  Service can be a little slow sometimes, but is always exceptionally friendly and the food is worth the wait.  They also have a great selection of New York beers for $4 or $5 and a solid cocktail menu.  The atmosphere is charming and they're always playing an excellent selection of soul and blues.  Really just an all-around great place which I consistently recommend to all of my friends.",5.0

"been to this place 4-5 times, some of the food is great, some like the mac and cheese not so great...the service has always been a little on the not too great side, but i can deal with that as long as i have good food and get my drinks quickly at least.  last night was the worst dining experience i have ever had, we were sat by the waitress, where we sat for at least a good 5 mins before i looked at the time wondering if anyone was going to bring us water, or a menu for that matter.  after i looked at the clock we tried to get someones attention and anytime we made eye contact, the person would look away, finally 10 more mins pass and the waitress comes over and asks if we need menus, get menus, wait another 5-10 mins still no water, or drink order taken, no one has come back to take our order. a couple gets up from the bar, so we figure maybe we can get some service if we move to the bar. as soon as we sit, the waitress appears, and instead of apologizing for us waiting at least 25 mins, kinda questions us about moving to the bar, now at this point we have been there half an hour and finally got water, and our order taken! now we try to order drinks, the bartender takes our order, and then just never makes the drinks, i actually timed it, and it was 17 mins before she started our drinks, and we were just sitting there watching her talk to people and not really do much else, finally a couple service tickets came in and she finally decided to start our drinks...at this point 3 girls that sat 5-10 mins after us were finishing up their meals...needless to say i am really disappointed because the drinks and the meals i have eaten there have been pretty good, but i will never go back there again",1.0
"Amazing food, amazing service. Be careful with the extra hot chicken though, it is very inconsistent. Sometimes areas of the chicken receive more spices than others and it makes it intolerable.",5.0
"I'd give them two stars but they ruined my man's b-day so one star it is! Take that, 4.5 average.Peaches Hot Mess.Okay, so the Hubs was dying for some Nashville Hot Chicken so we headed here, ordering the fried green tomatoes, regular chicken, the fried whiting, collard greens, and creamy grits. The cornbread arrived first, too sweet and tasting like the box I suspect it was shaken out of. Okay. We sip our Cokes and listen to R&B. And listen to R&B. About 12 songs in, Hubby crankily announces that we have been waiting 50 minutes for food. I somehow distract him for another 20 minutes until the food comes. The fried green tomatoes were acceptable; covered with too much bacon and sauce, yes, but fine. The creamy grits had a distinctly 'off' taste, like moldy cheese. The collard green were bland and limp. My whiting was a shockingly small portion, like three fish sticks that might be served to a cranky todder in Park Slope and while my husband's chicken was adequately sized, it sucked. There was a sour quality to the batter (excessive vinegar or buttermilk or, you know, rot) and it tasted burnt. It was so over-battered, that we removed the batter in a whole piece and it sat there accusingly, like a mad soft shell crab. The words 'pissed' and 'disappointed' come to mind, yes.The waitstaff was nice but overstretched and basically, we waited 70 minutes to spend $40 on awful food.
