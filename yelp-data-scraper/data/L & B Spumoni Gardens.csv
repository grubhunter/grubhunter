"L&B Hands down has the best best pizza I have ever tasted! Whenever my cousins come to visit they always ask to come here also because they've also never tasted better pizza. So we always go there to eat and the staff is always kind and fast! Unlike other great pizza places I love L&b's because the prices are fair. I just wish they delivered to me I swear I would order all the time but they don't.  Highly recommended to try them, YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT :) Hope they forever stay this way hahaThanks   -Mary",5.0
"Seriously I am not fan of Sicilian style pizza, but this joint rocks the socks off of that style of pizza. Best damn pie I've hand in awhile. If we are ever back in Brooklyn we are definitely eating here again.Their Rainbow Spumonti was good but a little too heavy on pistachio for my tastes.",4.0
"The hike deep into Brooklyn is worth it. If you want a NYC style pizza that is off the tourist path, then this place is for you. Also, it is a great place for pizza is you are an NYCer or soon to be NYCer. I came here here with a party of 8, with 6 of which were people from out of town, and the staff was very prompt and helpful by explaining things on the menu for my guests. The dining experience is very old school 70s/80s NYC without the male perms. Just note, we ate at Spumoni Gardens in late March, so it was not very crowed at all for dinner. I understand that this place is VERY popular in the summer and you may have to wait a while for table if you have a large group.   The pizza squares were pretty delicious. However, it was not the absolute BEST but it was pretty close. Sometimes I think that high ratings on Yelp can set unattainable experiences for certain places. I really liked the antipasti and calamari appetizers, the latter of which you can get grilled. Pizza aside, the spumoni is where it is at. I mean, the restaurant is called spumoni Gardens. So, save a little room in your belly for the rainbow spumoni.",4.0
Here is my review boiled down:Legendary.Thank you Mike the financial executive from JP Morgan for introducing me to this place right over the bridge.  Get a half-tray Sicilian and go into a food coma.,5.0
This is a famous pizzeria in Brooklyn and it never disappoints. I order a middle and/or corner slice of pizza and on most occasions I eat 2-3 of these epic slices! The inside is bear minimum but it's clean and decent and the service is super fast because they are used to the high number of people that patronize the place. The pizzas are very indulgent so I can't visit this place too often or I start packing the pounds!,5.0
"Note that I have never dined in here, but from what I have had and my experience, this place hits the spot especially during a nice day where you can be outside, have some pizza and ice cream.  As it seems, many people have the same idea as you can expect lines and a crowded patio area during peak hours.Brooklyn is known to have some great pizza and L & B Spumoni Gardens does not disappoint!  They are known for their Sicilian Square Pies and I suggest you try these slices.  Note that these slices from the Sicilian are not crunchy, but more soft and on the chewy side.  I would suggest having these slices right away than having them to go, as I can imagine they get pretty soggy overnight.However, the taste of these slices are great.  The pizza is heavier on the sauce rather than the cheese, which I do not mind at all.  This allows the cheese to not be overwhelming and you will notice that most of the sauce is on top of the pizza.  You can also taste a bit of oregano in it.  Also, what wins me over with L & B Spumoni Gardens is that there is an option to get ice cream here!  I opted to get their L & B Spumoni (hence the name!) that contains Vanilla, Chocolate, and Pistachio.  I love Pistachios in general and they know how to make it well here! They also have Italian ices here that seem great to try during the summer.There is a dine-in area here so hopefully when I have a chance to stick around the area I will eat-in here and try their other offerings and entrees.  But even if I eat-in here, I will make sure I get a slice of their delicious Sicilian pizza!",4.0
"This is what you expect at any classic New York Italian restaurant, busy, waiters carrying 100 plates at once, music, family's laughing, happy kids cheering in an icecream boat, everything about this environment so welcoming and family oriented.  Here it is just my girl friend and I, but this did not stop of from having the full experience as we are supposed to: bread, salad, fried, protein, pasta. Here we started with the calamari, this was light and flaky (unfortunately light on flavor) which ACTUALLY became complete with the marinara(don't be afraid to throw a little lemon in that too). The arugula salad we had, amazing, a bundle of the biggest arugula I've ever seen tossed in balsamic and topped with tomatoes onions and garlic. The pepper, the spice, the crunch of those vegetables with the vinegar zing, perfect.Entree wise, we went with the chicken parmigiana and shrimp fra diavolo, wow. He handed the seafood dish to me and the mountain of mussels that came my way, you're lucky I caught a pic because I was digging right in. I was tearing through shells for meat, the shrimp large and succulent I didn't worry about those (thanks), I hardly noticed there were clams too. The linguine rested in the sauce, every bite was sweet and tangy.  The chicken parm, for two people, it had to be, one person to conquer that serving? Share with friends for sure. It may sound weird, but I I am not a chicken parmer like that, I know it's a go to for most, but this was made perfectly.   The techniques used, flavors that came together fluent throughout the entire meal, I only regret being too full for dessert(they really don't play with dessert, entire candy lands were passed to children).It doesn't matter tho, returning here a must. This is THE Italian spot, I'm telling you, I came from the BRONX to get it!",5.0
"So I'm riding my bike around Coney Island on a cold day and I feel like a warm slice is just what I need to keep me going. I've suffered through square slices a couple times at the suggestion of friends, who were nostalgic for something that I just didn't understand...until now. In short, I've hated every square slice I've gotten from everywhere EXCEPT at Spumoni gardens. The square slices here are on a soft, fluffy bread that has the lightest bit of crispiness at the bottom. The cheese is nothing to write home about but the tomato on top is super fresh and delicious. I will probably never make it a priority to get a square slice but if I ever needed one, this is where I would come.",4.0
"L & B Spumoni's makes great Sicilian pizza. I came here with a group of friends and went to the pizzeria side (not the restaurant side). We shared a half pizza for $21. It was delicious. The cheese-to-sauce ratio is perfectly balanced for my tastes. The cheese is flavorful and not overwhelming. The sauce is amazingly tangy. Some people might not like the doughy bread, so the slices in the middle without crust can be overly doughy and soft. The slices touching crust are better. Getting to L & B Spumoni's is a journey, so make it a trip and check out that part of town while you're out there.",5.0
"BEST PIZZA! The square pie is so deliciously crispy while simultaneously doughy. The tomato is sour, sweet, and well balanced. We went for lunch and each got a slice, but loved it so much we went back for dinner AND GOT A WHOLE PIE. I was seriously skeptical of this square pie because I thought, ""whose square pie could be better than Di Fara's?"" but this Spumoni Gardens' is seriously amazing.",5.0
"Just came back from the world famous L @ B Spumoni Gardens and I am not smiling.  I have seen great reviews from numerous TV food shows and pizza lovers that I was dying to try this pizza.I tried their infamous Sicilian square pizza and I am not impressed.  Just dough, tomato sauce and minimal cheese topping.The ride to Brooklyn from Manhattan for this bland, boring, tasteless pizza was a waste of my time!",2.0
"This was a perfect place to eat after a long day in Brooklyn. Had gotten up early to attend a card tournament. Being a competitive player sure gave me and my friends an appetite. We got there 30 minutes before close and the staff was helpful in explaining the types of pies. Our first time here.There is also some ice cream next to it. Is this all one business? Anyways, the pizza was delicious. We got some spumoni after or I think thats what it is. Filled up our tummies for the drive back home. Next time We are back in Brooklyn we are coming back for more.",5.0
"As far back I can remember - I've enjoyed the pizza here. I practically grew up on L&B's pizza. When coming to L&B- get ready for 2 things....A SQUARE SLICE & Some SPUMONI! Yes ladies & gentleman...it's referred to as a square slice & it's DELICIOUS. The way they put the sauce over the mozzarella then top it off with grated cheese...amazing! The square is a must, I've rarely seen people come here a regular slice. And by the way, it wasn't until I was in my adulthood where I started called the square slice/pizza ""Sicilian"". The restaurant offers an extensive menu of goodOld fashioned, home style Italian ""comfort food"" ! There is even counter where you can get the restaurant menu to-go. Just be careful, I think the pizzeria side & restaurant side are handled by different People. Just know which door your entering. Last but definitely not least- you gotta have the Spumoni! You can thank me later!",5.0
"Brooklyn's reputation as the borough of legendary NYC pizza is completely valid; among the many pizzeria institutions it represents perhaps no place comes close for Sicilian style pizza than L&B Spumoni Gardens. Buried deep in the southern part of the borough, Spumoni Gardens (I've never heard many locals ever refer to it as ""L&B"") can feel like a trek for non-locals but I would do it anytime I'm craving Sicilian. After all distance is all relative with patience and an appetite, right? Anyone with a car should zip over here immediately, barring BK traffic in mind of course.At roughly $21 a pie and $2.25 a slice, the price is a relatively a bargain next to a lot of other (vastly) inferior pizza joints that charge over $25 for grandma versions of Sicilian pies. These squares are chunky to the core, cheesy as it gets, and incredibly messy to eat. Unless you're strolling by for the occasional bite, this pizza should always be shared in good company or bought in bulk.Unlike most pizzas, I would venture L&B is better off eaten fresh on the spot, rather than the next day's leftover-in-the-fridge kind of the pizza. The crust loses its edge, the bottom becomes saturated in the grease / sauce, and it becomes a soft pudge of pizza goo before it congealing to a room temperature brick. Some folks might like it this way, but for maximum pizza pleasure I suggest eating it on the spot.And of course, there are other things besides pizza they do quite well. During the summer, this is a popular spot with locals for Italian flavored ices. Other Italian specialities like arancini rice balls or linguine with clams are popular with the non-pizza eating crowd, along with the baked clams, broccoli rabe, and mussels. There are round pies as well, but they have little precedence over the square slices.Lastly, this place is huge. Parking lot, dining room, and a massive outdoor area as well. During good weather days, there could be a long line but I've seen the same even during cold nights. It is uber family friendly and a fun place to challenge one's appetite for a tasty carb loading session.",4.0
"There is mostly seating outside in a fenced in area in front. I would not call it a garden, though. There are three places to order.  Two are  outdoor opening windows, one for pizza and the other for spumoni, ices and ice cream.

I elected seating al fresco, as it was a record warm day in March.Not being a fan of square pizza, (yes, I know) I had a veal parmigiana hero.  It was so good. I can't believe I ate the whole thing.

Do not even think of eating this in the car, or you will have marinara covered upholstery.This being an above 72 degree day, I had a cherry Italian ice, which was just, meh.Oy, I shoulda had the spumoni!There were two persons servicing the window. I ordered 2 slices of round pizza to go, which they are not famous for, and it is excellent.  I ordered my pizza, paid for it with 6 dollars (they are $2.75 a slice) and was waiting for change, but as one person was wrapping and handing over the pizza, the other had disappeared without handing me the change, essentially, tipping himself.  This marred what would have otherwise been a stellar experience.I am not saying I would not have tipped, but they gave me the equivalent of a ""you're welcome"" without giving me the courtesy of offering a ""thank you"" first.Ba-da-bing.",3.0

The place smells good but it's dirty.. I mean.. Pretty filthy... The floors, the table, just gross.. Anyway, I was starving so we woofed down two famous squares.. They sucked... The sauce was ok but it was like I was eating raw dough .. All chewy and spongy it was gross.. There are so many other BETTER pizza places... We're in friggin New York like cmon.

Just boring and the pasta was mushy.I was so grossed out I wanted to just get up and leave.. Which I was upset bc I really wanted the spumoni but physically couldn't stand to sit there another minute...This place has been around for a while and I'm sure if their spumoni was anything spectacular you would see it in the freezer section of your local food store just like other places do when they're actually successful with their gelato, sauce, etc. Older Italian women working in the front of the place are ratchet and rush you so don't expect a friendly greeting they only give a shit about getting you in and out and truthfully the food F-ckin sucked..

"Went on an unexpected, spontaneous pizza crawl in Brooklyn with my son a couple of weeks ago.  Finally found time to try the renowned DiFara's on Avenue J, home of the $6 slice.  Waited close to an hour for a few slices of a round pie (He wasn't doing squares that day) surrounded by a mix of hipsters and locals all agog over the pizza and watching (some filming) the old master ply his trade.   Okay.  I get it.   It's a cool experience and the pizza is really, really good.  Then why did both my son and I look at each other as we left and almost simultaneously say, ""let's go get some L&B squares.""    Twenty minutes later, after one bite of a square L&B slice from a fresh pie, my son and I looked at each other and again almost simultaneously said, ""Now that's great pizza!""   Wow.   I have admittedly been disappointed in L&B the last couple of times I was there.

"Best leftover pizza ever.In the sea of NY style pizzas all across the city, L&B Spumoni Gardens is like an isolated secret swimming pool of pizza. Unlike many of their competitors throughout the city, L&B uses thick crust pizza, and places the sauce on top of the cheese. It's kind of like deconstructing and re-imagining how the pizza is made. Perhaps it's this way of crafting the pie that causes it to be so delicious the next day.So like I said at the beginning, it's the best leftover pizza I've ever had. During my dining experience, some friends took us here as we continued our pizza scouring adventures, and as we get there, my friends instantly ordered for us without giving us a chance to even see a menu. Two trays, one to eat there and one to go. As we ate there, I definitely knew this was a solid pie. Nothing mind blowing, but solid all the same. That night we go home and my friends were a little sad that we did not share their hardcore fandom of this pizza, and so we went to sleep. The next morning, we awoke and decided to heat up the to-go tray in the microwave, and by some voodoo magic, the pizza was actually better the day after than the night before. The sauce was tangier, the dough was fluffier but still had that crispy outside, and the cheese was melded into the dough more consistently. My mind was in shock of how overnight the pizza evolved like a pansy ass Magikarp turning into a strong Gyarados. I was in such shock that my mind came to one of two conclusions, either 1) over the night, someone broke into the apartment, and switched out our above average pizza with a phenominal one, or 2) like I stated above, somehow the pizza evolved like a pokemon under the full moon, revealing it's true greatness to us in the morning.To this day, we are still baffled as to how the pizza got better, but from that moment forward, the legend of the L&B leftovers took hold in our hearts, and is unanimously the best leftover pizza in our eyes.",5.0

"L&B's Sicilian square pizza is the best pizza you can get in the neighborhood by the slice. I agree that it's over-hyped after the countless times I've ate here. Regardless of the hype, it's still a solid choice to satisfy your hunger and taste-buds. There is usually a constant flow of customers so expect a fresh tray to be waiting for you at the pizza window. I personally like the corners because I like the charred crunchy crust. The cheese melts underneath the sauce giving it a unique texture. The sauce is semi-sweet and tangy. It's a no brainier why they've been in business for so long. Over the past weekend, I placed a phone order for 2 Sicilian trays ($40 a tray), 1 catering sized baked ziti, and 1 catering sized Caesar's salad to feed the guests that came over for a party. Not 1 single slice left over and not 1 single complaint. Baked ziti ($35) was finger licking good (feeds 8-10) Salad ($30) was meh. I'd substitute for pasta in the future. Do yourself a favor and head over to the desserts window and order a Spumoni. There are real pistachios! The Spumoni ice/ice cream is rich and flavorful.",4.0

"I was in the Bensonhurst area for lunch, and after seeing Spumoni's Yelp page with 2k+ reviews, I thought it would be a perfect opportunity to see what all the hype is all about. Half-tray Sicilian ($21): The dough was soft and a bit chewy, with the fresh mozzarella they use adding a nice thick layer of cheesiness that blends well with the rich tomato sauce. It's topped with a little parmesan. Additional toppings are $2.75 each, but only paid $2 for half with pepperoni so my total was actually $23. Though this was the first time trying pizza here, I guess I'm with the purists in saying that the Sicilian slices taste so much better with no toppings. The pepperoni was good, but I did find it a bit too salty. I agree with another reviewer--it'll take at least two to three to fill you up.Large Spumoni ($3.50): That small translucent plastic cup is a LARGE!? Note to self: Order a pint or quart next time. I ordered the rainbow flavor (vanilla, chocolate, and pistachio mix) and absolutely loved it. There were actual bits of pistachio in the spumoni, which was pretty awesome. I was expecting this to be excessively sweet, but it was more of a subtle sweetness. The texture is lighter than their regular ice cream, which made eating it easier...and quicker (le sigh).The other dishes seem like typical pizzeria food, so I might just stick with the Sicilian and Spumoni. A bit overhyped, but I do think the grandma-style pies here are pretty good.",3.0
"10 stars please. The Sicilian slice is just near perfect and downright amazing at L&B. Delicious is the word. If you are a fan of the beloved square pizza, there is no reason to look further than here. L&B is truly the NY landmark of the beauteous and delicious Sicilian style slice.I will forewarn for those who aren't a fan of doughy, thicker crust, Sicilian style pizzas, then you may not entirely enjoy this. Those who complain of thicker crust, Sicilian are simply made to be that way, though with that, the crust on L&B has a really nice bite and texture when compared to other slices.  But it's best to be experienced fresh, and by the slice, though one can opt for a pie and/or delivered to your door if within proximity. But what pizza isn't best experienced right out of the oven. I've had their pizza in all the ways however; hot out of the oven, hot out of the box, warm from settling in the box, cold from leftovers, etc. Regardless of temperature, the flavor stays there. The crust still holds everything together. It again retains a nice crisp on the bottom and sweet airy fluffiness on the top that holds a perfect proportion of flavorful tomato sauce and melted gooey mozzarella. The difference here though with L&B is they reverse the cheese and sauce role -- the sauce is on the top and the cheese is on the bottom. The science behind this really works as the crust holds up very well next to ingredients. The sauce has a nice body and sweetness of flavor. The cheese just oozes but isn't the drippy oily gross cheese you'd come to expect. This is some quality cheese. This is some quality pizza.And we can honestly look past the decor and ambience of this place, but I find it to be very charming with its old school characteristics and history. You simply can't find a place like this anywhere in NY, that serves a respectable Sicilian as original and unique like this. All in all, make sure to take a trip to L&B with the expectation of having incredible pizza. And you don't even need the extra toppings.",5.0
Great Pizza there is lots of outdoor space to eat. They have the best italian ice. You can get takeout for the ices they pack it in a plastic container and they give you a cold bag regular flavors until May then they add more exotic flavors. It gets really crowded in the summer.

"This is hands down the best pizza I've ever had in my life.This was the first restaurant I ate at when I moved to NYC in 2009 (literally the first, we went there after moving into Park Slope.

One bite of this pizza and I was gone. Done. I think I had 4 slices at the restaurant, another in the car on the way home, and one or two more once home. Yes I wanted to die, but the taste...oh man.

Every year since I was a little kid we have pizza and spumoni. There is always a emotional aspect for me personally think back to when my grandparents came here when they were in their 20s.

Large patio is great for families or a group of friends to have a slice of amazing Sicilian Style pie and Spumoni.

"Food: 3.0/5.0Service: 2.5/5.0Value: 3.5/5.0Decor: 2.5/5.0Overall: 3.0/5.0People have their quirks, and the Yelp masses are no exception.  Every once in a while, I'll happen upon a highly decorated spot only to come out sorely disappointed.  After finally making it to L&B, I can report that disappointed, oh, I was.What can I say?  Yes, it's much better than Ellios or the french bread stuff they served in middle school.  And yes, I'm not the biggest fan of squares (but hey, I've been to PSP and am willing to admit it's pretty good).  But... it's just 'so Brooklyn' to talk up L&B like they're serving the greatest piece of puffed up cheese bread on the planet when in reality what's driving the love is some combination of nostalgia, groupthink, or an unhealthy love for puffy square slices.  At least don't call it pizza like it's real real pizza.  You guys are in New York for crying out loud.  Give it a try, but really really really keep your expectations in check.  And get a spumoni.",3.0
"L&B's Sicilian square pizza is the best pizza you can get in the neighborhood by the slice. I agree that it's over-hyped after the countless times I've ate here. Regardless of the hype, it's still a solid choice to satisfy your hunger and taste-buds. There is usually a constant flow of customers so expect a fresh tray to be waiting for you at the pizza window. I personally like the corners because I like the charred crunchy crust. The cheese melts underneath the sauce giving it a unique texture. The sauce is semi-sweet and tangy. It's a no brainier why they've been in business for so long. Over the past weekend, I placed a phone order for 2 Sicilian trays ($40 a tray), 1 catering sized baked ziti, and 1 catering sized Caesar's salad to feed the guests that came over for a party. Not 1 single slice left over and not 1 single complaint. Baked ziti ($35) was finger licking good (feeds 8-10) Salad ($30) was meh. I'd substitute for pasta in the future. Do yourself a favor and head over to the desserts window and order a Spumoni. There are real pistachios! The Spumoni ice/ice cream is rich and flavorful.",4.0

"I came here for a holiday party with my coworkers about two years ago and LOVED this place. I normally don't eat to much pasta, but the plates kept coming. My MD was a huge fan of this place and he wanted to make sure we tried them all. I enjoyed all the pasta dishes, the pizza came out and this was a NYC slice. The pizza was thick and cheesy and cooked to perfection ( I can still imagine the slices I had). We had a few (10 bottles) that were passed around for all three tables to enjoy. It was a great evening. The atmosphere was perfect, great company, and tasty food. I was a happy person. If someone asks for a new spot to take their friends, grab some good Italian food, or want a delicious sundae this is the place I usually refer them to if they are in the Brooklyn area and drive. Although trains are just one block away. As for the sundae......when we sat down they gave us something I haven't see on anyone's pictures. I don't know because it was a holiday or maybe they loved us, but the sundaes were mounds of ice cream, sauce, and delicious flavors ALL combined on one sauce pan/plate.I need to go back ASAP.

"I guess you can say I'm a romantic when it comes to yelp milestones, such as my 400th review. I did not want it to be some tawdry review of a street meat cart or dumpling storefront in the armpit of Chinatown, no, I wanted it to be special (like Dylan and Brenda at the Bel Age after the prom special).  As such, I have not posted anything in a long time, just waiting for a place worthy of the big 400.  Alas, on the 3rd day of my new low carb lifestyle, I thought what better time to drive out to brooklyn and try L&B's famous squares. Strangely enough, I first heard of L&B while living in Surfers Paradise Australia in 1997.  While there, I befriended a guy from Coney Island who would talk endlessly about his favorite pizza place called L&B.   When I returned stateside, for whatever reason, I never made it out there. Happy to report that the countless positive reviews on yelp are on target. This is not some hyped crap-house, no this place serves delicious squares that are worthy of acclaim. Pro tips: 1.  I think it is better to order by the slice, not a half a tray.  This way the pizza is fresh and still hot.2.  Go at a strange hour so there is no line, like during the week around 3ish. 3.  When I went during the week day I found street parking very easily (despite how it may look from the pictures, there is no parking lot for L&B). 4.  The slices are a decent size, not that big.  Some reviews say that the pizza was much better years ago.  I wonder if this is the case?  It would be fascinating to compare a slice from 1997 when my friend would rave about it, to a slice purchased today. Overall, well worth the drive out there.  I'm already craving more. Definitely worthy of 5 yelp stars.",5.0
"Love their square slices and spumoni ice cream ! Expect a lot of people during the summer time, I'd say it's worth the wait though. The duration of time it takes for them to prepare your order only if your buying squares is almost instant. They work fast and the pizza is already prepared.",4.0
"Best pizza I've ever had in my life. It's far, but worth the subway ride there. I took the N and got off 86th street. When you get off just take a right turn and go straight until 11th st. I've had a few deep dish pizzas but this is by far the best. I live in California and visited New York and was told by a friend to stop by spumoni's and I was not disappointed. There are 3 parts to the restaurant. When facing Spumoni's starting from the left is the pizza shop, then the ice cream window, and lastly the restaurant on the right. Seating outside is abundant, but inside the pizza shop is small.At first bite of the Spumoni deep dish square it had a hint of sweetness to it. The bottom was crispy and perfect! The cheese is on the bottom and then the sauce on top so it kept the bread from getting soggy. They even give you an option of middle or side piece (I chose side)!For $2.75 a slice, it is worth it. Though the pizza is so simple it is full of flavor and the workers are very nice! For dessert I had the Spumoni rainbow ice cream with pistachio, vanilla and chocolate. For a small it was $3.75. Though interesting it was a little underwhelming compared to the pizza and also I feel that there are better places to get ice cream around ny! Overall worth the long ride and if you're going in the summer might as well visit Coney Island since it's one subway stop away!",4.0
"Alert: Best time to go is 1) When HUNGRY and 2) in the summer. After 25 miles of biking last weekend, in 82 degree weather, with only a handful of almonds, a bottle of water and a small lemon ice in my stomach, I was sufficiently prepped to eat the thick Sicilian deep dish pizza that Spumoni Gardens is known for. Now, I'm no deep dish pizza fan. Once upon a time, I lived in Chicago for 3 years and tried each and every top-rated Chicago-Style deep dish pizza joint and I was never happy. I used to scrape out the insides because those deep crusts were gross. I think I may have left Chicago because I judged the city by it's crappy deep dish pizza. But Spumoni Gardens is in NEW YORK. The sauce on the Sicilian deep dish is zesty, flavorful and lovely. The way the cheese melts into the sauce and crust is seamless. The actual dough is chewy on the inside, crisp on the outside. The best part? If you sit outside at the picnic tables, there is no line. You just go to the counter and order. We had our slices within 5 minutes of entering! PLUS, when I went up for seconds, the pizza guy gave me an extra slice ""on the house"". Total score. (I did try a slice of the thin crust pizza, but couldn't finish it. Bland, boring, hardened cheese. DiFara is where you go for thin crust). I also sampled various homemade ice cream/gelato flavors (pistachio, tiramisu...) and just didn't like them. They were overly creamy and lacked flavor. But the lemonade was GREAT. Not too sweet and perfect for a hot day. The clientele at this Gravesend, BK, remind me of folks who go to Anderson's Frozen Custard in Buffalo OR the cast members of Real Housewives of New Jersey. This is not where hipster Brooklyn roams. It is where local (mainly Italian?) families go after baseball games. Spumoni Gardens serves up totally solid deep dish Sicilian pizza and sauce. It's not usually my thing and I don't foresee being a regular by any means. But on those RARE moments when I crave tons of chewy dough with zesty, homemade sauce served within minutes, I now know where to go.",4.0

"Friends swear by this place, so I'm wondering if the quality may have fallen off recently.The square pie is doughy, imbalanced, and underwhelming.I've had ""tomato"" pies from other places and, while not my preference, I can appreciate the sauce on top approach. And the sauce is tasty... very sweet but also bright and flavorful.Unfortunately, the sauce is all this pie has going for it. The thin layer of mozzarella lacked punch (it felt cheap) and the dough was pillowy, somewhat bland, and just dominated every bite. I never expected a perfectly balanced pie here but if you're going to double down on sauce and dough, those components need to shine.Thankfully the spumoni was delicious and it was nice to be able to dine outside. I can see the charms and understand why (when the pizza was better?) this was a beloved destination. But the way it stands today it's tough to comprehend how L&B is mentioned alongside other top tier NYC pizzerias.",3.0
"Been here a couple of times before the Yelp years and figure it's time to write 3 sentences about it. Sicilians squares are good but don't expect to bite into the best thing ever made. It's good but it's also a bit overhyped. 10 years ago I may have said it's really good but due to many more competitors opening up grandma style squares, it's quickly being pushed down the ranks.",3.0
"I thought hey, it's a slice of cheese pizza in the shape of a square. How great can it be??OH, BUT I WAS SO WRONG. Definitely worth sitting on the one hour subway ride from our Airbnb in East Village. $2.75 a slice and I would get at least 2-3 to fill you up. The texture and flavor were really top notch. I can only imagine how a fresh pie would taste...",5.0
"I came here for a holiday party with my coworkers about two years ago and LOVED this place. I normally don't eat to much pasta, but the plates kept coming. My MD was a huge fan of this place and he wanted to make sure we tried them all. I enjoyed all the pasta dishes, the pizza came out and this was a NYC slice. The pizza was thick and cheesy and cooked to perfection ( I can still imagine the slices I had). We had a few (10 bottles) that were passed around for all three tables to enjoy. It was a great evening. The atmosphere was perfect, great company, and tasty food. I was a happy person. If someone asks for a new spot to take their friends, grab some good Italian food, or want a delicious sundae this is the place I usually refer them to if they are in the Brooklyn area and drive. Although trains are just one block away. As for the sundae......when we sat down they gave us something I haven't see on anyone's pictures. I don't know because it was a holiday or maybe they loved us, but the sundaes were mounds of ice cream, sauce, and delicious flavors ALL combined on one sauce pan/plate.I need to go back ASAP. I'm having a little bit of anxiety being so far from Brooklyn now (living in NJ now).",4.0
"This place is phenomenal! You have to go and get the Sicilian pie and the Spumoni dessert ice cream. The staff is super friendly and the owner, Lenny, is so great he got us free pasta and dessert! The pizza is great when paired with the red house wine. It's an hour for us to get here but we will definitely be going back.",5.0
"I guess you can say I'm a romantic when it comes to yelp milestones, such as my 400th review. I did not want it to be some tawdry review of a street meat cart or dumpling storefront in the armpit of Chinatown, no, I wanted it to be special (like Dylan and Brenda at the Bel Age after the prom special).  As such, I have not posted anything in a long time, just waiting for a place worthy of the big 400.  Alas, on the 3rd day of my new low carb lifestyle, I thought what better time to drive out to brooklyn and try L&B's famous squares. Strangely enough, I first heard of L&B while living in Surfers Paradise Australia in 1997.  While there, I befriended a guy from Coney Island who would talk endlessly about his favorite pizza place called L&B.   When I returned stateside, for whatever reason, I never made it out there. Happy to report that the countless positive reviews on yelp are on target. This is not some hyped crap-house, no this place serves delicious squares that are worthy of acclaim. Pro tips: 1.  I think it is better to order by the slice, not a half a tray.  This way the pizza is fresh and still hot.2.  Go at a strange hour so there is no line, like during the week around 3ish. 3.  When I went during the week day I found street parking very easily (despite how it may look from the pictures, there is no parking lot for L&B). 4.  The slices are a decent size, not that big.  Some reviews say that the pizza was much better years ago.  I wonder if this is the case?  It would be fascinating to compare a slice from 1997 when my friend would rave about it, to a slice purchased today. Overall, well worth the drive out there.  I'm already craving more. Definitely worthy of 5 yelp stars.",5.0
"Love their square slices and spumoni ice cream ! Expect a lot of people during the summer time, I'd say it's worth the wait though. The duration of time it takes for them to prepare your order only if your buying squares is almost instant. They work fast and the pizza is already prepared.",4.0
"Best pizza I've ever had in my life. It's far, but worth the subway ride there. I took the N and got off 86th street. When you get off just take a right turn and go straight until 11th st. I've had a few deep dish pizzas but this is by far the best. I live in California and visited New York and was told by a friend to stop by spumoni's and I was not disappointed. There are 3 parts to the restaurant. When facing Spumoni's starting from the left is the pizza shop, then the ice cream window, and lastly the restaurant on the right. Seating outside is abundant, but inside the pizza shop is small.At first bite of the Spumoni deep dish square it had a hint of sweetness to it. The bottom was crispy and perfect! The cheese is on the bottom and then the sauce on top so it kept the bread from getting soggy. They even give you an option of middle or side piece (I chose side)!For $2.75 a slice, it is worth it. Though the pizza is so simple it is full of flavor and the workers are very nice! For dessert I had the Spumoni rainbow ice cream with pistachio, vanilla and chocolate. For a small it was $3.75. Though interesting it was a little underwhelming compared to the pizza and also I feel that there are better places to get ice cream around ny! Overall worth the long ride and if you're going in the summer might as well visit Coney Island since it's one subway stop away!",4.0

"Classic Brooklyn pizza! When you come here, be sure to get the Sicilian (square) slice and the spumoni. Their slices have the cheese melted into the bread, then it is topped with sauce and a bit of olive oil. From there, you can always add garlic, red pepper flakes, and oregano. The pizza is here is nice and fluffy and the crust has a crunch to it. So good! I'm not usually a pistachio fan, but when I'm here I will get the spumoni. It had a great creamy texture and great chocolate and vanilla flavors as well. But that's not all - it's cheap too! I came in on a Sunday night with four other friends. It was a little chilly outside, so we decided to eat in the restaurant. It's a very typical Italian restaurant inside, which doesn't match the laid back, summery feel of the outdoor seating area. We ordered the calamari (nothing too special there) and half a pie (12 slices). All in all, it came out to around $10 each with tax and tip. We were all full, and we still had some pizza left. Definitely got our money's worth :) Service was good! We were seated right away and our sever started us off with waters and bread. Our calamari came out pretty quickly, and the pizza was hot and fresh.",5.0
"We were headed out to Dyker Heights to see the annual Christmas lights and wanted an Italian meal beforehand.

Our waiter offered us the family style meal, which we declined but sounded like a feast that had enough food for about 30 (if I ever come back with that many people, it doesn't sound bad). Everyone seems to order the Sicilian pizza, big thick crust square pieces with a thick red sauce and smattering of cheese. We ordered that along with a few salads, pasta dishes, and heroes. While the food was good, it was not anything special. The highlight of the meal are the desserts which include any type of ice cream - soft serve, regular, ices, and spumonis. We tried the spumoni for fun and it wasn't bad! People may not come for the food, but for the communal, family, fun atmosphere (and possibly hefty portions).",4.0

I'm not a fan of the Sicilian style of pizza in general so I won't comment on that. However the Spumoni is delicious.

"Our alternative dine in place after visiting Coney Island as we can't handle the crowd in Nathan's, today was  the Hotdog Eating contest. Glad we tried the place. We tried their famous Sicilian square pizza. $21 for 12 slices one topping. Good price for the quality of their dough and the size of the pie. It's filling . We got our crust a little  crunchy on the edge. We love it.We can't resist their spumoni so we bought a small and large size. Price difference is just 50 cents. Get the larger serve on your visit. We had the rainbow flavor, chocolate, pistachio , vanilla. Not sweet is good ....not smooth , not a fan....or is it the nuts that made it rough?They have a sit down restaurant too.  This review is for their pizzeria. Next visit, I'll try what else they offer.",4.0
"Their spumoni is delicious.  In fact, they wholesale to some of the pizzerias in Brooklyn.  The square that so many people brag about is  ok. To me it tastes like a thick piece of dough with lots of tomato sauce and parmesan cheese on top.  It has no mozzarella cheese at all. Whats a square or a slice without mozzarella?! Go for the spumoni.  It is definitely worth it.",4.0
OUTSIDECASH ONLY.Their pizza is different and definitely made for those who are not a huge fans of a very cheesy pizza. They are square slices and the sauce is amazing.INSIDEAny form of payment.Really amazing food. Their pasta is nice and fresh. I ordered the stuffed shells and it was impeccable. I would definitely recommend this place; however do expect there to be lots of people. I have yet to go there and it not be crowded.,4.0
"Tips: First, decide whether you're eating in or outdoors.If you're eating outdoors, go to the window that says: 1/2 Trays and full trays only. (Unless you're getting pizza by the slice, then proceed to that window). After you order, grab a sit and wait for the yumminess.If you're eating indoors, go inside and give your name to the hostess. If temperature is nice, go sit outside. They will call your name over the loudspeaker when your table is ready.If you're eating inside and with a large group, don't go there during the dinner rush, at least on weekends, otherwise you will wait. Square slices come in single slices, half a tray (12 slices) or full tray (24 slices). If you come with an appetite, expect to eat two slices per person (I had 3; yup I eat like a fat man!).On to the review: I went with five other people at 5:30pm and we only waited about 15 minutes for a table inside.Food: We ordered half a tray of the square slices as well as calamari, rice balls, and mozzarella sticks. The pizza was soo good and just so different than the other Sicilian slices I've had. The cheese is underneath the sauce making the slice soo fluffy. The taste is tangy with a touch of sweet. The corner slices are definitely the best. The Calamari was yummy as well as the rest of the appetizers. After we paid our bill, we got a small spumoni ice cream and it was sooo yummy. Even if you're stuffed from the pizza, have some ice cream, after all, how often will you go there?Ambiance: Place is very family friendly therefore you see people from all ages. Outside they have picnic tables; inside is small, yet comfortable. Depending on your taste, you'll see some Italian eye candy. Bathroom is kind of small.Service: Hostess was super friendly. Our waiter was nice although at one point we had to hunt him down for the bill.Prices are so cheap! This is a good place to go if you need to feed many mouths or if you're on a budget.This place is quite far from Harlem, so I can't say I'm rushing to go back.

Not particularly blown away by this place.  They specialize in the Sicilian slice- I guess made famous by publicity on Travel Channel food show.  I am not getting anything special from this slice- it's decent.  If you like more sauce (again nothing special but I do note that it's not overly sweet- something I don't like my sauce being) than cheese.  Reasonably priced for a slice with soda.  Large seating outside.  Parking a bit of challenge in the area.  Not worth a long trek since there are many great pizza places in the NY area.,3.0
"I'm a fan for the SPUMONI icecream.  I just don't understand why the rate increases so much. I always buy a large container. I remember it being about $5, now its closer to $9 for a PINT.  I would buy it more often if it weren't the case.",4.0
"Came here with friends after a beach day for ice cream. Tried pistachio and rainbow spumoni, tiramisu ice cream, and peach Italian ice. They also had pizza so we ended up getting 1/2 Sicilian with mushrooms (12 slices).The ice creams were all delicious! The pistachio spumoni was a shocking green and quite addicting. The peach Italian ice was very refreshing. The pizza was very filling and could get in 2 squares before feeling extremely stuffed!The atmosphere is very casual. There is a separate section for ice cream and pizza. Even for pizza, there is a separate line for single squares and pies. If you get single squares, they are immediately ready to eat! After you get food, there are a ton of tables of all different sizes. Great casual spot for post beach treats!",4.0

L&B is a classic place. Very comfortable restaurant with some amazing pizza. The outdoor setting is pretty awesome when it's a nice day out.Good food and wonderful environment.,5.0
"If you love pizza and haven't tried L&B you haven't lived. A true landmark in the New York pizza scene. The thick, fluffy crust is covered with a layer of mozzarella and then smothered in a sweet and flavorful sauce. If it's your first time order double the amount of slices you think you can eat, because you won't want to stop. Make sure to finish your meal with the incredible Spumoni.",4.0
Not particularly blown away by this place.  They specialize in the Sicilian slice- I guess made famous by publicity on Travel Channel food show.  I am not getting anything special from this slice- it's decent.  If you like more sauce (again nothing special but I do note that it's not overly sweet- something I don't like my sauce being) than cheese.  Reasonably priced for a slice with soda.  Large seating outside.  Parking a bit of challenge in the area.  Not worth a long trek since there are many great pizza places in the NY area.,3.0
"I'm a fan for the SPUMONI icecream.  I just don't understand why the rate increases so much. I always buy a large container. I remember it being about $5, now its closer to $9 for a PINT.  I would buy it more often if it weren't the case.",4.0
"Came here with friends after a beach day for ice cream. Tried pistachio and rainbow spumoni, tiramisu ice cream, and peach Italian ice. They also had pizza so we ended up getting 1/2 Sicilian with mushrooms (12 slices).The ice creams were all delicious! The pistachio spumoni was a shocking green and quite addicting. The peach Italian ice was very refreshing. The pizza was very filling and could get in 2 squares before feeling extremely stuffed!The atmosphere is very casual. There is a separate section for ice cream and pizza. Even for pizza, there is a separate line for single squares and pies. If you get single squares, they are immediately ready to eat! After you get food, there are a ton of tables of all different sizes. Great casual spot for post beach treats!",4.0
"I've been going to L&B practically since the day I was born. Their famous square, with its crunchy well-done crust and cheese underneath the sauce, is so good. I could live off of this pizza and I always make sure to bring some slices home to freeze so I can eat the little slice of perfection whenever I want.",5.0

"Two of my Italian friends, one from New Jersey (with family from BK) and the other from Staten Island, recommend this place to me when I asked where I could find some of the best pizza in New York City.

"We sat inside here last winter and it was like sitting in my great aunt's foyer... from the 1970s.  Lots of brass and smoked glass.  Clearly I missed the memo about the 'gardens' and eating outside.The food, however, was delicious.  We had some grandma pie slices, a pasta dish, and of course - Spumoni!   This place is a NY institution and the food deserves every rave review it receives.  The meal was awesome. Need to go back again when the weather is warmer, but it looks like I missed my shot at that for this year, too!",4.0
I love their pizza. I do not think this place can get their pizza wrong. It does get really busy during spring and summer nights but it is completely worth it and I would always wait on line for pizza as great as this. One day I hope to make pizza as amazing!,5.0

"I've been going to L&B for many, many years. I was lucky growing up that it was close by in the neighborhood so I was never too far from a perfect slice. Things I love about L&B:1. It's family owned for over 70 years. It feels like family when you're there.2. You know summer is approaching when you start seeing the outdoor red benches filled with people.3. It's busy but you never have to wait long because they are super efficient and organized. There's a window for pizza slices, a window for pies, a window for ice cream, an indoor area for other pizzeria goodness, and an indoor full italian restaurant.3. The indoor restaurant has a full excellent menu with goodness like their chicken parms and pasta (you can order pizza too). Some nights you can catch the owner walking around and if you're lucky, he picks you to be the special guest of the night...and you will soon find yourself rolling out of the restaurant with a happy satisfied round belly.4. Spumoni Ices and soft serve ice cream. Enough said.5. Last but not least, their PIZZA....namely their famous SICILIAN (square) SLICE. It's just perfection--the tomato sauce, cheese, and thick bread that has a nice crust on the bottom but soft on the inside. Simple and satisfying on every level. If you're craving just the NY thin slice pizza (my favorite kind of pizza), then just get a regular slice - you will not be disappointed. I promise.I don't get as many chances to go to L&B as I used to as a kid, but every time I do pay a visit, it takes me back to my good old Brooklyn days.",4.0

Born in Gravesend and this was our spot.  If you didnt grow up eating this pizza than you just have no idea.  Brooklyn is filled with great pizzarias and this one takes the cake for me when it comes to squares.  2 squares and a round and two sodas is my order and you cant forget to grab some spumoni or whatever ice is your favorite.  Than go to Villabate alba or Cuccios for some pastries.The restaurant is also fantastic.  If your in Brooklyn you have to hit this famous landmark.,5.0

This place gives you just the regular slice, nothing fancy, no brick oven, no thin crust, but it will satisfy your pizza craving.

The square slices are the perfect combination of dough, sauce, and cheese, and butter probably, because nothing can taste this good without cheating. I don't want to overwhelm such a simple concept with too many words, so I'll just say that you should definitely get the pizza, and you should definitely not overthink it and get something else.

There are two lines for pizza, one for pies and one for single orders.  Single slices were quick, service just wasn't the greatest, as they are just trying to sell and move on to the next customer.

There are very limited seating inside; however, there are a lot of seats outside so you can sit outside and eat enjoy your pizza in the spring/summer.

This place used to be really good. Its a landmark place and the best thing on the menu is their spumoni. No other place beats it at all. However the pizza slices are getting tiny and the prices higher. At the restaurant area I ordered a sausage roll and it was okay in comparison with a lot of places in park slope and bay ridge areas. Their sauce is touch and go. One day it was fantastic and two other times it was eh. Because it is such a famous place you need to get there  early or make reservations because its like a zoo. Very crowded all the time which is a good thing for them. Also when the restaurant is full we have to sit outside ont he metal benches. Im fine with that but they need to clean off the bird poop in the spring and summber. Its loaded with that and i wont sit there.,2.0
"I have lived in Bensonhurst almost all my life, so I know good pizza. This is good pizza. It's something I crave every month. I've been here more times than I can remember since I was a kid.

The outdoor seating makes this a nice place to hang out, especially in the summer.The spumoni is the perfect thing to finish off your pizza with. Don't be turned off by the bright green color, there are chunks of delicious pistachios in there, they don't mess around with their spumoni! Don't like the icy texture?

"This place is basically a Brooklyn landmark. You cannot come to Brooklyn without stopping by and grabbing a slice. They serve the best square slice you'll ever have. The simplicity really makes it. It's just dough, mozzarella, tomato sauce, parmesan cheese, and olive oil. And it's in that order too! The cheese comes before the sauce! That really gives the slice its uniqueness. Simply put, it'll be the best $2.75 you'll ever spend.",4.0

I did eat at the restaurant inside, the food that night wasn't bad but it was nothing to write home about either. I ordered spaghetti and clam sauce and it lacked taste and seemed bland, there was a long wait as well but it was busy that night. One suggestion I do have is that the seats are more spread apart, it gets claustrophobic at times and sitting so close to strangers can be uncomfortable. I'll be sticking to pizza and gelato there loyally though!",4.0
"Finally tried L & B Spumoni Gardens, one of NY's historical and unique Pizza places of yesteryear here today and even more popular.For years as a kid, we would stop off for Albert's Pizza (in Long Island), whose unique recipe appears to have come straight from here!  L & B began in the 1930s, and Alberts on LI in 1950s!  Lol..  maybe they are related or maybe Albert was a chef who came out here with L & B's recipe and became popular from it! Not sure.This  is fun pizza that is square, has a crispy light crunchy crust, cheese underneath a really saucy sauce, with some distinct flavor of oregano, and parmesian cheese sprinkled on top.So its not your classic Neopolitan, expect something different, and good.  They do have round, but people come here for the Sicilian sauce on top.I headed in here on a quiet day  Chrismas week for lunch with  good friend, just to check out some great Brooklyn Pizza, and because of the day/time likely there were no long lines at all.Tip: This place is a few minutes from a classic Italian Bakery Villabate Alba, so when in Rome, check out them both.Both made me want to drive in to Brookyn two days later again..

Some of the best pizza in Brooklyn! If you go you should definitely get the square slices. Normally I prefer the round slices at other pizza places but at L&B the squares are their specialty! They also have wonderful ices in the summer time a particular favorite of mine is the peach! If you want to keep it casual you can eat outside or if you want to get together with family for a nicer event you can eat inside. They have great pastas and chicken parm as well!,5.0
"It's been a couple of years since I've last come to Spumoni Gardens, but it's delightfully still the same. You really have to be consistent though when you've been in business for as many years as L&B has.The Sicilian slice is what you come here for and of course you have to finish it up with some of their spumoni.   It's always an enjoyable experience here and is perfect for groups, families and pretty much anyone.I'm tempted to say it's better to come either extremely hungry or with a large group just so you can delight in getting an entire pie.The staff are all super efficient and fast and there's quite a bit of seating available. It still gets packed, but the tables turn over pretty quickly.",4.0
I've never felt so welcome and at home at a restaurant. The Sicilian square pie was to die for. Loved the salad as well. Of course we had the legendary spumoni too. Would come back! From the moment we walked in it was like coming home.,5.0
"This place is basically a Brooklyn landmark. You cannot come to Brooklyn without stopping by and grabbing a slice. They serve the best square slice you'll ever have. The simplicity really makes it. It's just dough, mozzarella, tomato sauce, parmesan cheese, and olive oil. And it's in that order too! The cheese comes before the sauce! That really gives the slice its uniqueness. Simply put, it'll be the best $2.75 you'll ever spend.",4.0

"I love this place tremendously. I usually have the Sicilian pie as well as the gelato out on the benches. It has a very relaxing and fun vibe. I did eat at the restaurant inside, the food that night wasn't bad but it was nothing to write home about either. I ordered spaghetti and clam sauce and it lacked taste and seemed bland, there was a long wait as well but it was busy that night. One suggestion I do have is that the seats are more spread apart, it gets claustrophobic at times and sitting so close to strangers can be uncomfortable. I'll be sticking to pizza and gelato there loyally though!",4.0
"Finally tried L & B Spumoni Gardens, one of NY's historical and unique Pizza places of yesteryear here today and even more popular.For years as a kid, we would stop off for Albert's Pizza (in Long Island), whose unique recipe appears to have come straight from here!  L & B began in the 1930s, and Alberts on LI in 1950s!  Lol..  maybe they are related or maybe Albert was a chef who came out here with L & B's recipe and became popular from it!

I assumed this must have been where it originated and that it would taste similar.  I was sadly mistaken. This pie did not have the robust flavor that I've found it to have at other places.

But this place does not only OWN the pizza market but also their famous Spumoni Pistachio Mix. It's frozen when you get it but melts quickly in your mouth and you can taste all the flavors.

This was a classic Italian experience and I really enjoyed it and the food.

"I'm not a big fan of pizza and the idea of trying a sicilian pie, thick crusted and deep dish pizza was not intriguing to me. I bought a slice and it was SO good. It's really convenient for me to just walk, take the train or bus here. I come here regularly now whether I buy a slice or a whole pie. I always go for the corner slices because I love the crust, then I top it with everything from garlic powder, chili flakes, and oregano. After pizza, I wash it down with some ice-cream. (which isn't my favorite either, it's hard for me to like certain ice-cream) I love their creamsicle ice-cream, it's so rich, creamy and sweet. I've dine in the restaurant a few years back and had ordered pasta for take-out but I don't remember how it was exactly. I'll update my review when I do.",5.0
"6 years later and I'm still not blown away by their pizza. Sicilian is definitely the better slice compared to their regular round slices. The round slice was kind of bland, the cheese was eh and there wasn't really any sauce or flavor.Since I haven't had other flavors, I vowed for the rainbow one which includes, vanilla, chocolate and pistachio. It was terrible. The pistachio tasted incredibly artificial and sugary. Real pistachio isn't like this. Even the almonds tasted fake. The chocolate was bad as well, again very fake it tasted like they used hot chocolate powder to make it. The only flavor that was passable was the vanilla. My 5 year old cousin tried some of it and hated it as well, he took two bites and gave it to me and said he didn't want it anymore. Here's the convo: Me: Why don't you want the spumoni? Cousin: It's not yummy. Me: Why isn't it yummy?Cousin: It's not good.Me: What's not good?Cousin: The green stuff, tastes yucky.There you have it folks, if a 5 year old can hate spumoni, that's gotta say something right? After all their taste buds are more sensitive to taste and they're the world's pickiest eaters.The only thing that can possibly redeem this place is the sicilian slice, otherwise skip it. This place does not live up to its hype.",2.0
"Whenever I am in the area, I always try to grab either a slice or a large cup of spumoni to go. One slice is super filling since the crust is thick and the cheese in the pizza is heavy but it is super delicious. I always prefer the slices around the edge because it is less messy to hold and theres a crunch from the crust. In one sitting, if i can, i'd normally scarf down 1 and a half slices! The spumoni from L&B is the best I've had so far!",5.0

"I wanted to give the place a higher rating but I just couldn't - at the end of the day...it really  wasn't that good - its 3 star good - not great by any meansWe ordered a half a pie - square slice - and I think we would have been better off ordering one slice at a time - the slices seemed to be better if you order that way - ours seemed ""pre-cooked"" and as if it was on an assembly line - it wasnt cooked thru and thru - there was that layer of doughiness that just won't do3 recommendations...order one slice at a time, dont bring any home (it doesn't re-heat well at all) and make sure you order the spumonii ice cream before you go - its delicious",3.0

"As my buddy Ben would say ""Spuuumoooneeeeeees is legit"". Was here with a small group and we got down on some old school Italian goodness deeeeeep in Brooklyn. Went in on the Sicilian Square while waiting for a table. At the table we had some meatballs, spaghetti, and another dish I can't seem to remember. This was a classic Italian experience and I really enjoyed it and the food. The metaballs were my favorite, but if you know me, this would be a no brainer.  The service was a bit slow since it was a busy Sat night, so the server was super nice and got us a free ice cream platter, yes platter.Feed me more please.",4.0
"I'm not a big fan of pizza and the idea of trying a sicilian pie, thick crusted and deep dish pizza was not intriguing to me. I bought a slice and it was SO good. It's really convenient for me to just walk, take the train or bus here. I come here regularly now whether I buy a slice or a whole pie. I always go for the corner slices because I love the crust, then I top it with everything from garlic powder, chili flakes, and oregano. After pizza, I wash it down with some ice-cream. (which isn't my favorite either, it's hard for me to like certain ice-cream) I love their creamsicle ice-cream, it's so rich, creamy and sweet. I've dine in the restaurant a few years back and had ordered pasta for take-out but I don't remember how it was exactly. I'll update my review when I do.",5.0
"6 years later and I'm still not blown away by their pizza. Sicilian is definitely the better slice compared to their regular round slices. The round slice was kind of bland, the cheese was eh and there wasn't really any sauce or flavor.Since I haven't had other flavors, I vowed for the rainbow one which includes, vanilla, chocolate and pistachio. It was terrible. The pistachio tasted incredibly artificial and sugary. Real pistachio isn't like this. Even the almonds tasted fake. The chocolate was bad as well, again very fake it tasted like they used hot chocolate powder to make it. The only flavor that was passable was the vanilla. My 5 year old cousin tried some of it and hated it as well, he took two bites and gave it to me and said he didn't want it anymore. Here's the convo: Me: Why don't you want the spumoni? Cousin: It's not yummy. Me: Why isn't it yummy?Cousin: It's not good.Me: What's not good?Cousin: The green stuff, tastes yucky.There you have it folks, if a 5 year old can hate spumoni, that's gotta say something right? After all their taste buds are more sensitive to taste and they're the world's pickiest eaters.The only thing that can possibly redeem this place is the sicilian slice, otherwise skip it. This place does not live up to its hype.",2.0
"Whenever I am in the area, I always try to grab either a slice or a large cup of spumoni to go. One slice is super filling since the crust is thick and the cheese in the pizza is heavy but it is super delicious. I always prefer the slices around the edge because it is less messy to hold and theres a crunch from the crust. In one sitting, if i can, i'd normally scarf down 1 and a half slices! The spumoni from L&B is the best I've had so far!",5.0
Best Italian family friendly with great service! The chef always comes out to shake peoples hands and let's try new things for free! Had my birthday several times there and everyone was stuffed!

"My favorite pizza of all time. My Brooklyn friends in college used to deliver this pizza to me and it just brings back good memories. I remember when They first brought it they said it was the best. 5 slices later, I agreed. Not to be biased, but as a foodie, I have to say that this is my favorite. I've tried Chicago deep dish, Lombardi's, Luzzo's, and places in DC. This takes the cake. The bottom of the pizza is crunchy, the middle very moist with the bread and cheese combined perfectly, and it's all topped with a tasty tomato sauce with sprinkles of cheese on top. Careful, after you try the first bite, you get addicted and you start eating faster. Then you might burn the top of your mouth which is what happened to me. Ah well, worth it ;).  Definitely a place to try if you're in the area or within driving distance. The Spumoni ice cream is meh so I'm just rating this on the pizza. I've had the best homemade ice cream from farms in Virginia so these don't even come close. Tip: request for the edge piece so you can have something to grab the pizza with and try the crust. If you like the crust, get the corner piece, and if you just like the juicy pizza, then get a middle piece!",5.0
"Best Sicilian slice ever!! Spumoni Gardens is a must-try for any pizza fan. The bread is perfectly chewy and the crust is bar none. The cheese melts into the bread to form an unbelievable and unique texture. The sauce is on top of the cheese it is deeply layered with flavor and a little sweet. There is nothing I dislike about this pizza. I have only ever gone to the pizza parlor, and not the attached restaurant, but the restaurant has a line out the door at night so I assumed it also fantastic. The Spumoni dessert is also a favorite of mine. It is best enjoyed outside on a warm summer day. Spumoni Gardens has an old school Brooklyn feel that is hard to find. If this place was closer by, I would stop in all the time.",5.0

"OLD School Sicilian Slice at L & B Spumoni GardensYou couldn't believe it!.  I ran 16 MILES just so I can eat the entire 12 Slices!.No Kidding. I ran from Columbus Circle with a group of runners.  We all met up at 10AM and from Time Warner building, To West Side Highway all the way down to Canal Streetn Following the Manhattan Bridge, then to Flatbush Avenue, made a Half Circle into Prospect Park Following down to Ocean Parkway then to Ave U.YES..... 16 Miles (Which took me 3 hrs) To Devour a Sicilian Slice (Not just one... Had 4 of them). The Best part is each one is so fresh, warm, and So Saucy that it was Finger Licking DELICIOUS!.Each Slice ($ 2.75 each) is about 6X8 inches wide, and about an inch thick of Dough / Cheese / Sauce).You don't usually wait, there's 2 cashiers inside (One is by the slice, and one is by the Pie).They also serve Pizza Pie (plain or with pepperoni).PS......

Though the spumoni was a lil icy, it had nice chunks of pistachio in it. There's tons of tables outdoors, so it's a nice spot for pizza and ice cream when the weather is nice.",4.0
"I don't believe I've ever had authentic 'Brooklyn pizza'! Now I KNOW what all the hype has been about for yours. Over the weekend I went to L&B with a friend to grab a slice of pizza.Although there was a parking lot right next to the premise it was full, but we were able to get a parking spot nearby. Initially, the line was long AND for good reason. I had a fresh square slice and it was just the perfect amount of cheese to sauce to crust ratio. We both sat outside at a small table and enjoyed eating our slices in the amazing weather. We contemplated getting icees, which are also sold there and ultimately decided not to.I would love to go back for another slice and to try some of their authentic Italian dishes.",4.0
"Tasty and unique but not as great as I expected. I've had Spumoni Gardens bookmarked for some time and today presented me with the perfect opportunity to pay this place a visit and get a taste of the much talked about Square slice. About the pizza, it was pretty good. Its very saucy which is good thing because the sauce is the highlight of the slice. It has a distinctive sweet/tangy flavor that pretty much saves it from the downfall of not being cheesy at all. I know there was cheese on the slice but not much. Some slices had more cheese than others but even the cheesiest ones have very little cheese. The other thing I didn't like was the crust is kind of Doughy.  All in all it's still a good square pie but it defiantly wasn't this best in the borough, end all slice of pizza it's being made out to be. As far as the place goes I thought it was really cool, they have a large outdoor area to enjoy in the summertime (if your lucky to get a table with an umbrella). They even have a section of the restaurant that serves what appeared to be some delicious ice cream treats. I'd give the place a rating of 3.5, I'd come back if I was in the neighborhood and i'd enjoy the slice, but if I came here from another borough expecting greatness I would certainly be disappointed.",3.0
"Growing up in Brooklyn, this L&B was a staple in everyone's diet. Parking was always a mess, but when you wanted a square that could be compared with no others this was where you went, tickets for double parking be damned. Once I finally started making more than $4.75 an hour I was able to graduate to their sit down restaurant which was equally delicious, but still we could never walk out with out eating a square because it's that good. I haven't lived in Brooklyn in over ten years, however L&B remains a place in my ""food tour"" that just can't be missed.

"I am a huge fan of pizza. I can't get enough of pizza. It's funny because I am writing this review waiting on my pizza from a different place. Ok let's start with arriving at the location. You probably will need a car because I live in Queens and I will be  damned if I had to take public transportation to come here. Parking is awful because it's only  street parking,so good luck.      My boyfriend was super excited and raving  about the pizza.  I trusted his pizza palate and was look forward to an amazing experience. We stood in line, which seemed long and out the door. However, it was moving quite fast.  The line was only for regular slice and or Sicilian slice. For some reason you weren't allowed to order any toppings on the pizza waiting on this line. I think you have to get on another line for that.        Now for the decor of the place. The place is separated into to three different sections. One for pizza, spumoni and the last section of sandwiches.  You have great outdoor seating which adds on to the experience.        Me and my boyfriend  each got a regular and a Sicilian slice. I must say the regular slice was great. It didn't have the "" ton of dough"" and no cheese taste. The sauce was slightly sweet and tangy which complimented the cheese beautifully.  Even after the slice was done I was memorized by the taste. The crust was not too crunchy but soft and lightly crispy.    Now for the Sicilian slice.... hummm I am not too happy report I did not like or care for it. I actually regretted this choice. I think that slice was nothing but dough . So much carbs you could probably skip two days without eating any. There was no taste, just dough ... pure dough. I was super excited about the Sicilian slice because from what I heard that's what this place was renowned for. I don't want to criticize the taste of great pizza establishment but it was pretty bad. I am hoping may be it was  only that day. I didn't taste the cheese or the sauce. The whole experience  my palate was yearning for was disappointing.   I might just go back to redeem this place but will be only getting one Sicilian slice for both us. I just don't want to have repeat of extreme dough like last time.",3.0
"Love the Sicilian pie. That sauce is amazing. To experience the true taste of the pizza it must be eaten there, otherwise it's like chewing a rubber tire slathered with cold mozzarella.

We had the pistachio flavor, and we both agree that this isn't a good combo with the spumoni. I love pistachio, but the way the flavor tasted is just..bad. I admit, that's my first time trying it here, so can't comment on other flavors.Will update the view once I tried out the pizza that everyone is raving about..",3.0
"Listen, any born and bred New Yorker worth his salt can tell you where to get a regular slice in any borough. The thing about L & B's that stands out is that you don't come here for your average slice. You come for a Sicilian slice, a square. A crunchy on the bottom, but gooey-saucey-cheesy on top, bite from heaven. And 20 balloons (bucks, dollars, however you want to call money) for half a tray is a steal if you ask me. You never leave L & B's hungry. Instead you leave satisfied, and curious as to how you and two friends managed to finish half a tray and barely leave a crumb in the box.",5.0

"If your from Brooklyn this is the place.  Wait, not from Brooklyn? Better make the trip! This is still the place, has been for over 80 years and will always be the best!  I've lived in Staten Island for over 20 yrs now and even my kids know if we are having pizza, we are traveling to Brooklyn. I'm not sure if anyone gets a regular slice since anyone who is anyone goes just for the squares. So, first of all they put the cheese UNDER the sauce. Yes, you heard right, cheese first and then sauce.  Does it make a difference in taste?  I don't know but they have the best tasting pizza around.  After the pizza make sure to head over to their spumoni window!  To die for.....",5.0
"We just ordered a pizza for $40 this past Sunday and it was soooo late and barely warm and all dough this time. This is the second time we ordered a delivery; it never came for our wedding the first time, now it is so late the pizza is barely warm. To add insult to injury, the pizza was all dough with barely any topping and I have eaten here many times and quality dropped; unless you like dough bread with barely any sauce and cheese. Spare yourself, many reviews even on food channel are bogus.",1.0

The best square pizza around!!! You have to buy the pie and share with friends. The pizza and sauce are original. Take some home. Also the Spumoni ice cream is delicious. Inside and outside dining.,5.0
"I am a huge fan of pizza. I can't get enough of pizza. It's funny because I am writing this review waiting on my pizza from a different place. Ok let's start with arriving at the location. You probably will need a car because I live in Queens and I will be  damned if I had to take public transportation to come here. Parking is awful because it's only  street parking,so good luck.      My boyfriend was super excited and raving  about the pizza.  I trusted his pizza palate and was look forward to an amazing experience. We stood in line, which seemed long and out the door. However, it was moving quite fast.  The line was only for regular slice and or Sicilian slice. For some reason you weren't allowed to order any toppings on the pizza waiting on this line. I think you have to get on another line for that.        Now for the decor of the place. The place is separated into to three different sections. One for pizza, spumoni and the last section of sandwiches.  You have great outdoor seating which adds on to the experience.        Me and my boyfriend  each got a regular and a Sicilian slice. I must say the regular slice was great. It didn't have the "" ton of dough"" and no cheese taste. The sauce was slightly sweet and tangy which complimented the cheese beautifully.  Even after the slice was done I was memorized by the taste. The crust was not too crunchy but soft and lightly crispy.    Now for the Sicilian slice.... hummm I am not too happy report I did not like or care for it. I actually regretted this choice. I think that slice was nothing but dough . So much carbs you could probably skip two days without eating any. There was no taste, just dough ... pure dough. I was super excited about the Sicilian slice because from what I heard that's what this place was renowned for. I don't want to criticize the taste of great pizza establishment but it was pretty bad. I am hoping may be it was  only that day. I didn't taste the cheese or the sauce. The whole experience  my palate was yearning for was disappointing.   I might just go back to redeem this place but will be only getting one Sicilian slice for both us. I just don't want to have repeat of extreme dough like last time.",3.0
"Love the Sicilian pie. That sauce is amazing. To experience the true taste of the pizza it must be eaten there, otherwise it's like chewing a rubber tire slathered with cold mozzarella. This place was also where I first had the pleasure of eating veal. Had the veal parmigiano and was soooo delicious. Will definitely go back.",4.0
"There's a reason why this establishment has been around for decades, they are amazing. Authentic Italian food, pizza is always on point and the service is enjoyable. My waiter gave me a free slice of pizza because I was pregnant. How thoughtful! Love this place.",5.0
"Came here on a Sunday night around 10pm, and the pizza line was quite long, about 10 people online. We weren't hungry, so I didn't get a chance to try out their famous pizza yet, but I did try the spumoni with a friend. We had the pistachio flavor, and we both agree that this isn't a good combo with the spumoni. I love pistachio, but the way the flavor tasted is just..bad. I admit, that's my first time trying it here, so can't comment on other flavors.Will update the view once I tried out the pizza that everyone is raving about..",3.0

Pizza is my favorite food so of course I won't eat just any pizza.  Came here on a busy Saturday afternoon and ordered 2 pies.  They have a great system so didn't have to wait too long. Got my 2 hot pies (almost couldn't carry them they were so hot) and we zipped home and devoured them. They are the square pies that have right amount of sauce and cheese.  Perfect crust (love the corners) and just fresh and tasty. It is one of those places that that have stood the test of time - it's real Brooklyn pizza.,5.0
"Well I have been coming here all my life, and for that reason I am a bit biased. My family and I have visited this place since I can remember, and now that I live close, I can visit more often. Previous to my most recent visit, I had only ever ordered from the window, and would almost always only get the spumoni. The spumoni is terrific, but it is a bit lighter than normal spumoni. It's sort of like a cream-ice, if that makes any sense. It lacks the creamy thickness indicative of typical ice cream or gelato. But it is marvelous. It's a great feeling when some things are just as wonderful as they were as you remembered them as a child. The vanilla, chocolate, and pistachio flavors are swirled together and produce magic.It's all downhill from there. This trip, we ate inside the restaurant. The service was shoddy. The sicilian pizza was ok, not great, a bit under cooked. The calamari was a bit bland, but ok with lemon and marinara sauce(points for bringing it without having to ask). The pear salad was actually quite tasty. Not cheap, so be prepared for that.I had the regular round pizza in the past that I remember being very good. My advice: stick to the spumoni.",4.0
"Love love love their Sicilian style pizza! They allow the dough to rise before prepping it; cheese is added and then topped with their delicious tomatoe sauce.

Very disappointing experience.   Pizza was mediocre at best; baked clams were dry and flavorless; calamari was average.  The service was absolutely horrible.  The appetizers were brought out after the dinner and waiter ignored the table (I have to wonder if that had anything to do with our party being a mixed group). The food and service definitely did not warrant their menu prices.,1.0

But still no mussels in white wine sauce - I had to literally get up and confront my waiter.

I mean it should be considering the fact that they named themselves after the ice cream. Any pizza in Queens is so much better than the one they serve here.,2.0
i enjoyed my Sicilian slice and pistachio spumoni. The bread of the Sicilian slice was very soft. and it wasnt oily like regular slices.Pistachio spumoni isnt creamy like ice cream. it very nutty and yummy!,4.0
"LOVE L&B! A sicilian style no-fuss pizza with a thick dough, sweet tomato sauce, and thin layer of cheese on top. theres a small place to sit inside if you're just ordering pizza or spumoni, but there's also a restaurant portion of the restaurant for when you're feeling a little fancy! a true new york staple",5.0

"I visit Brooklyn every year and it's mandatory to stop and L&B for a delicious Italian dinner. We always go Garlic Bread, Calamari, a Pasta dish, Steak, and chicken Parm. Done. KO. I don't love their pizza, only because I grew up eating thinner folded triangular shaped pizza, but it's also nice to do Sicilian style once in a while. The atmosphere is great, it's always packed, the servers are nice, and it's like a huge Italian fam party. I'm always stuffed before I make it to the Italian Ice window to order a quart of Spumoni to take with me :)",5.0
"After hearing all of the hype about this place, I decided to come here with my girls for dinner. I guess everyone had the same idea because the place was packed. We had to wait over an hour and a half to be seated inside. The hostess explained that there was a party of 20 so it wasnt really their fault but it was still a really long time to wait.The sicilian pizza was okay...sauce was pretty good but overall I didnt think it was as great as everyone says, although it is somewhat better than a lot of the other options out thereId recommend getting a pizza to go rather than eating in",3.0
"CHEF'S TABLE. CHEF'S TABLE. CHEF'S TABLE. This place is the real deal and well worth the trek from Manhattan. I've only been twice now but both experiences were gleeful, memorable meals and the dishes were consistently delicious. The wait for a table is well worth it. When you're there, look around at people's faces in the dining when their plates are placed down in front of them and you'll see the look of pure happiness. The portions are American huge which is great for leftovers, and try not to think about the amount of ice cream and salad that is going to waste because you can't take those things home (although they did ask). One of the best restaurants in the whole damn city.",5.0
"If you want a perfectly cooked, savory slice of pizza look no further than L&B. This is my FAVORITE pizza joint in all of NY. I can't get enough of it when I am in town. Being a Brooklyn native I had access to their pizza and spumoni all year round, now that I live in TX it's a daily yearning. Don't miss out on the best Sicilian you will ever have in your life.",5.0
"I live this place, always open when other pizzerias close at 10pm. Never had anything else besides their special pizza and it's so good that I take home extra , keep it in the frig for a few days,, microwave that shit and it still hits the spot",5.0
"We've had a few visits here since my first review and I must say I now have a new appreciation for the L&B sicilian slice. The sauce is on top and the cheese underneath?! I literally realized this on our last visit! It does make a difference in the taste and it really is good. I can understand why I wasn't totally 5 stars for this place, since a plain slice and a sicilian slice are totally different.  This slice though. You need to let it marinate for a bit to really appreciate the flavors. The sauce is sweet with the flavor of the cheese underneath. The dough is crisp on the edge and bottom but soft in the middle. 4 slices and 2 sodas=$14. Do it.",5.0

"I'm a midwest girl in NYC--I regularly find myself asking, ""where is the BREAD with my pizza!?"" Brick oven/thin crust just isn't the pizza I want. I've found my dream slice: THE SICILLIAN SLICE AT L&B. The slice I had was fresh out of the oven and the crust was crisp where it needed to be and fluffy on the inside. The best part, however, was the SAUCE. The slice had the perfect amount and it had a super tasty, old school Italian flavor. There was not too much cheese which made it even more delectable. The rainbow spumoni was the perfect finale to this most delicious slice of pizza. Best slice I've had in the 7 years I've lived in NYC.Also, the outdoor seating and right off of Ocean Pkwy (which has a great bike lane) make it a great place to ride your bike and have a lovely outdoor lunch.",5.0

How can anyone living in south of brooklyn not try this place? I been here for many  years and their square pizzas are not like any other pizzeria in nyc. I made a rookie mistake when I first tried here. I ordered a round slice. Round. After noticing how everyone seemed to have square pizzas I quickly picked up their secret. Their square slice is not like a ny slice where its thin like a cardboard. The  square is crunchy on the outside while fluffy on the inside. The sauces is generous on top keeping it nice and moist. They don't go cheap with the cheese either. You get a decent layer of cheese on top.If you aren't feeling pizza they also sell other stuff like ice cream ...pasta...and stuff...I never had anything else there other than pizza but I am sure it's good right? This place is super family friendly. Outdoor seatings are a bit cramped but still enough space to eat. People are so friendly there and treat you like family too so they don't mind you sharing a table if there's no place to sit. If anyone is visiting from out of town this pizza place is a must go as they do a better job representing ny pizza,4.0

"Cheese pizzas are the only pizzas for me. It's my way of comparing pizza parlors. And after having read rave reviews about L&B Spumoni Gardens, and knowing it's an landmark in the pizza landscape, I ventured out into Brooklyn to pay homage and to see and taste for myself.I just ordered a round pie slice of cheese pizza ($2.50) that wasn't even reheated upon placement of my order. I didn't see anyone making any pies, just someone slicing them. One thing that stuck with me was how, when I deposited money into the tip jar, the cashier shouted something like, ""Tip, guys!"", and I was met with a resounding cheer. I don't recall what it was they said but it sounded grateful, so I'm assuming it was a thanks of some kind. I found/find it a good practice.My pizza slice was well worth its price, for an establishment like L&B Spumoni. Very straightforward, nothing groundbreaking. The crust was chewy and wasn't oily , you could fold it properly, the mozzarella was fresh... But in effect, it was lackluster.

"The pizza is famously delicious  ... This no one can deny! However , it gets so busy there that parking is a pain! L&B does have a small parking lot for customers but I notice a lot of people stay in their cars all night! They become ""squatters"" in L&B's parking lot. This isn't a drive through! Get your pizza and hit the road!!!  As a result, people like myself who are there to do just that become the victims of pissed off delivery boys who've HAD IT with the lack of spots in the lot. One evening I had a craving for L&B's pizza. I found a spot in the lot and ran in. When I come back to my car I find that some asshole blocked me in and it is impossible for me to pull out my car and go home! One of the workers in the back informed me that the car belonged to one of the pizzeria's drivers. I asked if he can kindly tell the inconsiderate piece of shit to move his car. Well I waited and waited .  Then I went inside L&B's and asked again. Then I was told it will be moved. As I made my way back... The dickless wonder drove off. My pizza was nice and cold. Thank you for this lovely experience L&B!",4.0
"L&B pizza is what you would call different than any other you'll taste. One thing stands out to me though, and it's the use of too much dough, and not springing for high quality herbs, and instead relying on very bad quality dry oregano. It makes the pizza almost difficult to digest, but even more importantly, there's something to be said for their lack of customer service and rude attitude.Try it once and develop your opinion, but definitely have your money ready when you're about to order. They get very rude if you take time or ask questions.",3.0

It's not bad, but it's not outstanding either. Still, like I said, the portions are what keeps me ordering those dishes/meals, when I need some fulfulling food for a long day/night of work.

"two words: sicilian slice. this is an upside down kind of slice with the sauce on top and it is delicious and warm as the square pies move quickly on a nice day. Be sure to ask for your favorite ""cut"" from the tray of pizza.  perfect place to sit outside in picnic tables on a warm day. Remember to get a spumoni when you are done with your pizza. They also serve neapolitan style slices and there is a full service restaurant next door.",4.0
I absolutely love this place! The square slice here is one of the best I have ever tasted. They constantly have fresh pies so you'll never ever get a stake price. The ices here are really yummy especially the spumoni. I will always come back here!,5.0
"I love L&B for their spumoni and Sicilian Slices! Their round pies are good too, but nothing to overall rave about. Their Sicilian slices are just fantastic! Thick and bready, with a nice sauce with tons of herbal/spiced flavor! If only you could get toppings on individual slices!I get their pasta dishes and heroes too, and the portions are great, but sadly the sauce is just meh for me. It's not bad, but it's not outstanding either. Still, like I said, the portions are what keeps me ordering those dishes/meals, when I need some fulfulling food for a long day/night of work.

"Just recently moved back to Brooklyn and to the Gravesend area after having lived in the mid-west for a while, and had my landlord mention this place to me when we moved in. I have been seriously deprived of great Sicilian pizza out in the mid-west and was really excited to have some great Sicilian options again.This however, is by far the BEST Sicilian pizza I have ever had, and I have tried out quite a few in my days. Perfect crust, perfect cheese, and just the right amount of sauce. Complete perfection. I have tried out their square pies as well and they are also great, but I am partial to the round pies. The prices for the slices (which is what I usually get) is also very reasonable, with two round slices setting you back $5.50. Also, others have mentioned this as well, but if you are looking to just order a few slices, make sure you go to the window all the way on the left past the ice cream window! Super quick to get a few slices of cheese. Absolutely and completely worth the trip. So happy to have this be my local pizza joint!",5.0

"This is the place in Brooklyn to go have pizza. I went this week with my girlfriend, as I'm moving to Florida and had to have a couple of L & B's slices before I went. It was a Tuesday at lunch time and there was a line, but not the humongous line they have on the weekends. I got two regular slices (cheese pizza) and so did my friend. They have tables with umbrellas for outside eating. We carried our slices to the outdoor area with picnic tables and a roof-type awning overhead. It was much cooler there, as the day was sweltering. The pizza is great. I particularly like the way the crust has a teeny bit of charring from the oven. That's real Italian pizza. There was no shortage of cheese on the slice, and I love that. Still it wasn't overwhelmed by cheese. After you get your slice you can go to a service area to get napkins, oregano, Parmesan cheese, plastic utensils, straws for drinks, and the like.I had slices here years ago (early 1980s) and they were great then. They're also great now. I've eaten in the restaurant (years ago) and it was really good, but this review is about the pizza as that's what I go to L & B's for now.

"This was the most disgusting pizza I have ever had! We ordered an entire Sicilian pie, when my husband came home and we opened the box.

Best sicilian slice i have had and if you look at my reviews i am a tough critic. This place is a gem. A slice of heaven is the best way to describe the sicilian.If you live anywhere drive-able you should come to this place. Screw it if you have to fly in do it. Its worth it.,5.0
"Go for the square instead of the round slice.  The round slice tasted worse than the $1.00 slices that you get from random pizza joints.  Maybe because it had been out for some time and they didn't even care to heat it up prior to serving it? On the contrary, the square - OH MY!  It was served piping hot and the texture of the dough and crust, oh dear lord, have mercy on this pizza lover! The slice was doused with the perfect amount of sauce and topped with what I believed to be baked grated Parmesan cheese, which gave it a bit of a salty crunch.

"My sausage brothers who are originally from New York told me I had to come here and that it's the only reason to ever go to Brooklyn. My friend and I hopped on the N train from Manhattan to Brooklyn so we can have dinner. We got to the 86th station. Oh my, the area isn't well-lit and there were Mexican guys saying ""Chino! Chino!"" Oh, great...I'm going to have to headbutt somebody...again.I was told Brooklyn people are ""different"" but I wasn't sure what that meant since my aunt, uncle and cousin are from there and they don't seem different to me. I loved the people from Spumoni Gardens when we went there. Chatty, loud, with a Brooklyn accent and friendly - the type I find hilarious.  The hostess was very helpful. Our servers were fantastic veeeeerrrry friendly. We were chatting it up and next thing you know, pretty much everyone that worked there including the lovely yet spunky manager were at our table...chatting and laughing! It was like I've known them for years!I planned to get meatballs, arancini, a round slice and a Sicilian slice. But our server told us the pizzas by the slice only come in cheese - no other toppings. Although New York cheese pizza is delicious, I was in the mood for some sausage and pepperoni. So, we got the small (12 slices) of Sicilian pizza with pepperoni, sausage and mushrooms. I immediately sent my sausage brothers a picture of my pizza. They were disappointed in my failure in ordering pizza the ""right way"" which is plain cheese. *shakes fist*. We also got calamari, arancini and spumoni (of course). It's worth mentioning that they have shakers for oregano, Parmesan cheese, garlic powder and chili flakes at each table. Mmmmm...garlic powder.Calamari:This was pretty typical fried squid rings. The marinara had a very mild flavor so my friend had to add salt, pepper, Parmesan on hers. 3/5Arancini:I'm not a fan of rice but if it's Italian rice balls? Now, we're talking! Take my Asian card away if you wish. You get 3 rice balls lightly breaded with bread crumbs. The rice has meat and peas mixed in. The sauce is light with some melted cheese. 4/5Sicilian Pizza:Despite my pizza being topped with failure called pepperoni, sausage and mushrooms - I thought this was really good. They use real tomatoes - the sauce was sweet. The crust was thick. The small pizza we got was huuuuge! I was only able to eat a slice. 5/5Spumoni:You shouldn't call yourself ""Spumoni Gardens"" if your spumoni sucks. I love spumoni and I liked this. We only ordered one but they gave us another one for free. 4/5My friend was afraid to leave and walk back to the train station. It didn't help when our servers told her ""if you go past dataway, you might get shot at."" Hahaha! My advice is to relax, it hurts less that way.

"This was the most disgusting pizza I have ever had! We ordered an entire Sicilian pie, when my husband came home and we opened the box.

Best sicilian slice i have had and if you look at my reviews i am a tough critic. This place is a gem. A slice of heaven is the best way to describe the sicilian.If you live anywhere drive-able you should come to this place. Screw it if you have to fly in do it. Its worth it.,5.0
"Go for the square instead of the round slice.  The round slice tasted worse than the $1.00 slices that you get from random pizza joints.  Maybe because it had been out for some time and they didn't even care to heat it up prior to serving it? On the contrary, the square - OH MY!  It was served piping hot and the texture of the dough and crust, oh dear lord, have mercy on this pizza lover! The slice was doused with the perfect amount of sauce and topped with what I believed to be baked grated Parmesan cheese, which gave it a bit of a salty crunch. And the crust was crisp and crunchy.  All this goodness for $2.50!! If there is a heaven and I make it there, it would definitely consist of a square slice from here.They also have homemade ice cream, spumoni and creamsicle.  I had the pistachio spumoni, which was pretty good, but a little bit too sweet for me.

I'm sad to say after years of coming here this weekend was my last. The workers are downright rude and don't have any people skills.  They make you wait and there is no order and they all are mumbling in Arabic if you question what os going on and why I can't order yet. There are better places in Brooklyn. Plus the pizza is soggy bread. Don't waste your time go elsewhere.",1.0

"I can't even count how many times I've been here, but the square slices and Italian ices are perfection.I've also ate inside at the sit down restaurant twice, very good food and service and the dessert platter is amazing. They only charge per person and you get quite a good amount of dessert, they usually change up the look of the platter by table.",5.0
"A few slices of pizza and some ice cream is all you need to be happy!  Sit outside, enjoy the weather, and feed your face.  Parking is often tight so you may have to park down the street",5.0

"As a kid growing up in Bay Ridge, every summer we rode our bikes up to 86th St and W6th St for some of the best Sicilian Pizza we ever ate! We always got two squares, a coke, and a rainbow Spumoni after we ate!  My recent visit was a week ago.  I live in the City now and always brag to my kids how great is is so they said, go get some! So I made the subway trek to L&B and ordered a Sicilian pie and a Spumoni (I ate that icy confection on the 25th Ave West End platform!) and brought it back on the train (people were staring and drooling BTW) and 45 minutes later, in the door and it was still warm! 5 people wolfed down 12 squares in about 10 minutes!  L&B's never fails me.  Crispy yet fluffy crust.  They add the cheese first then the sauce and baked to deliciousness! We have a trip planned this weekend to get some great squares and some Spumonis!",5.0
"The pizza is good. They make a lot of pies beforehand and package it so when you order, you get the pizza pretty quick. I would prefer to have hot and fresh pizza right out the oven though, not ones that has been cooling in the pizza box for a couple minutes. One thing about the pizza is that it is a bit salty for my tastes.",3.0
"I am a huge pizza fan, I am also a huge fan of this place. Everyone should pay this place a visit sometime . $20 for a Sicilian pie with 12 slices... Pretty good deal for high quality pizza. Also, while you are there pick up one of the ices!",4.0
"I've been eating New York style pizza all my life and I thought that was the yummy goodness. But I was wrong! The Sicilian pizza was very thick and chewy. There is a hint of crustiness at the edges. The sauce was evenly layered and very well seasoned. This pizza was very different, but I liked the doughy texture.",5.0
"This place is a Brooklyn landmark. The square slice, known elsewhere as ""the Sicilian"" is their best known dish, but this place is no one trick pony. The Spumoni is also out of this world. Just because the Spumoni and squares are their specialty, don't overlook the sit down restaurant. It could easily survive as a standalone restaurant and give some of the better Italian American restaurants in Brooklyn a run for their money. Don't be fooled, anything with the Spumoni Gardens name means quality. The long waits and big smiles of patrons on their way out can testify to this.",5.0
"If you don't wait in line for the most piping hot slice of Sicilian in the world - im talking lava hot - then you don't get to review this Mecca. I'm a fan of the corner slice and if you can't see the steam radiating off the pie, step aside and wait for a fresh one. Eat it before it seems safe to do so, you won't regret it. Straight up this pizza will change your life. Anyone who doesn't like it is totally cool in my book because this spot is already blown up, and the fewer tourists in the line the closer I am to my corner slice!",5.0

This is brooklyn!!!!been coming here my whole life and its one of the best slices you can get. I didn't give it 5 stars because they changed the recipe about 4 years ago and it is just a tad worse. Still the best slice in New York though. ONLY GET THE SQUARE SLICE,4.0
Square hot out of the oven corner slice is arguably one of the best slices in the pizza biz...the round slice is underrated and pretty good as well..have to finish off with a spamoni .....4 stars not 5 why? Cause it's do dam expensive!,4.0

"I've always heard how amazing L & B Spumoni Gardens is & how it's the staple for Brooklyn pizza so when I was in the area with my friend on Friday night, she had to take me. We were sat right away & greeted by a really friendly & handsome server ;) I knew I wanted to try the square pizza that everyone raves about, but I really wanted Italian food so I opted to take a slice of square pizza to go after we ate. We ordered a Ceaser Salad & Fettucini Alfredo to share for dinner & Fried Calamari to start with as an appetizer. I hadn't had a cream sauce in a long time & the fact that the Alfredo is served with prosciutto & my pregnant friend's eyes lit up when I suggested it, I knew we had to order it. In hind sight, I should have suggested we order something else because it wasn't great. I mean, it was edible but it definitely was not anything to be excited about. The fettucini seemed more like linguini in size & the cream sauce was very liquidy without much flavor. I guess I'm used to Alfredo sauces which are thicker in consistency & have more cheese. The Ceaser salad was also nothing to write home about. To be honest, the salad at Wendy's has more flavor. Another dish that was pretty dry & it tasted only like lettuce with a ton of Parmesan flavoring. There was dressing but it seemed more like a paste of cheese. It was ok just nothing special & definitely not worth the money. The calamari appetizer was the best of three items we ordered but I am not a fan of their sauce whatsoever. It has no consistency at all & is pretty tangy & sauce like that just gives me agida. There was absolutely no salt whatsoever either & I actually added salt to the calamari which is something I have literally never done in my entire life! The desert we ordered because we simply just had to was pretty outrageous though & I will give credit where credit is due because the tartufo, Spumoni, & ice cream were all creamy & delicious. Ok, the pizza. Oy vey. I do not understand what the hype is about. It's a square slice with tangy sauce & a tad bit of Parmesan on top. I heated it until the crust was burnt & there was still literally no way of getting the pizza crisp even in the slightest. It tastes pretty similar to a thicker Ellio's frozen pizza to be quite honest & I just don't get why people say this is THE place to go to. I don't agree. Yes, the service was awesome. Yes, the dessert is great. I'll even admit that after seeing a pic of the Rigatoni Bolognese on Yelp after we ate & wish I would have ordered that instead, this restaurant is way overrated. I'll stop in again when in the neighborhood for an ice or something but other than that, I will still stand by favorite Italian restaurant in NY & that is Mama Theresas. Nothing beats it anywhere.

"The best square pizzas... In this world!!!! Their sauce is just so different from other pizzerias. I cant even explain it! Its so good!!! I always get either half a pie or a full pie becos 1-2 is never enough. Their spumoni is also great! Love the pistachio flavor and if im feelin greedy i'll get the rainbow (all the flavors) pint to go! This place gets very crowded in the summer becos they have outdoor seating. They have a small parking lot but most of the time ppl jus double park get what they want and leave.

"Great pizza. I had the regular slices and some square slices. Square slices are much thicker, have a fluffier crust, and less cheese than regular slices. Not gonna change your world if you've grown up in Brooklyn and been surrounded by NYC pizza, but pretty damn good for the price. I had spumoni ice cream afterwards. Honestly, the sizes for ice cream and ices are too small for the price they list, but it's all homemade so I guess that justifies it. If you've never had it before, it's less creamy than ice cream but too creamy to be an ice, and tastes strongly like pistachio, swirled with chocolate and vanilla and the teeniest tiniest hint of mint. Tasty, but probably wouldn't get it again.",4.0

"How can you not love this place? It's the perfect end to a long lazy summer afternoon at Coney Island (especially if you've lazed at the beach past 7:30, the inexplicably early closing time over at Totonno's). Hop on the train one stop, walk over, get in the long, super-quick walkup line and sit on the kind of picnic tables that dotted the public parks wherever you're from. It's an experience unlike any other - no frills, no pretense. Just a metric ton of pizza at a great price. Of course when you're there, get the square. And load it up with red pepper flakes, more cheese, whatever you want - the crust can take it and it enhances the experience - tempering what is otherwise the pleasant mild sweetness of the pizza. If you're a pizza fanatic like me, you'll surely have already watched the various media showing how they make it here - cheese (sliced) first, sauce later - and it makes a difference. Hell, the sauce is so legendary a mafia war (literally) almost broke out over it in 2012 - there was even a federal trial - look it up. It's nothing like the rest of the city's thin, crisp, greats - it's a thing of its own and it's a beauty.Oh yeah, the spumoni? Try that too! Pretty sweet, but really nutty and really great.",5.0

Then my entree which was probably the worse penne I ever tasted in my life. It was bland cream with peas and such a yellow color it looked like turmeric was added to the dish. It was inedible. I couldn't even eat it. We had to ask where my sons pizza was to 3 different guys as our admitting server was MIA. It's like they forgot about us totally. How do you forget to serve the kid FIRST. kids should always get their food first. Not last. What kid wants to wait for pizza. Their pizza was good when it finally arrived. Finally the brought my baked clams which was my app after my entree. They were not that great clams were so tiny it's not like you can make someone happy with the size of them. They knew they messed up tonight and took the clams off the bill. Mind you. My husband is a chef and has owned a restaurant in the past. We won't ever come back to this place. I would rather sit outside and eat the pizza as take out. I won't ever come back to dine inside.

"I feel like there's more nostalgia and some emperor-has-no-clothes hype with L&B. We ordered and sat outdoors in the picnic tables section, and we came for the Sicilian pizzas but also had arancinis and a meatball sub - so much red sauce! - plus the rainbow spumoni. The pizzas were kind of doughy and heavy, not as crispy of a crust, but the cheese and sauce were good. The sub, not so much, but the surprise were the rice balls - filled with peas and chopped meat, topped with more red sauce and melted cheese. They were a bit underdone in the middle, but the effect of the mushy rice, sauce, and cheese was a savory comfort. The spumoni, there's no pistachio in the world with this color, but at least I had some green in my food.I wouldn't make a special trek out, but it's casual and can be a fun summer atmosphere with friends or family.",3.0
"With almost 2000 reviews, there is little more to say, but I will try.  I have yet to eat at the restaurant but exclusively at the counter on the left entrance.In short, it may be the best Sicilian slice I have ever had.  The crust is perfect, crispy and yet light inside; the sauce is pure; the cheese is mix of yum.  You may have to wait a bit, for the slice and a place to sit, but there is seating outside.Do yourself a favor and get off the Belt Parkway, grab a slice, close your eyes and enjoy.  Also, leave a tip and check out the reaction.",4.0

"THIS PLACE IS FAR! Yes, it's in the middle of no where Brooklyn, but is it worth the drive? One million percent yes! You come here for one thing only, OK maybe two things, yeah you only come here for two things only: the squares and ice cream. The reg slice is a reg slice, it's almost not even worth mentioning. I have to admit though, in typical Ben fashion, I will have to go back just to try their other stuff, to test out the menu. The al fresco dining is also really nice, especially on a summer day.The food:Square- This is one of my favorite Sicilians slices. The dish is different from your average Sicilian in that they actually do a layer of cheese and then the sauce on top. The sauce is excellent, there is a subtle sweetness and a great tang to the sauce. The cheese is ooey/gooey and the bottom is nicely crunchy. A fantastic square. If you get a whole pie, try to get one that is already made, the fresh pies have a soft/spongy bottom and takes away from the slice. yelp.com/user_local_phot…yelp.com/user_local_phot…Slice- it's just a plain ole slice.Spumoni- I am a big fan of their rainbow spumoni. It's kinda like a Italian tri-flavored ice cream. The flavors are chocolate, pistachio, and cremolata, which is a vanilla almond-cinnamon. yelp.com/user_local_phot…Nocciola Hazelnut Ice Cream- This absolutely gets no love what so ever but their hazelnut ice cream is fantastic.

"A group of friends and I (party of six total) ate dinner here last night, and we couldn't have been more disappointed. The pizza was mediocre and definitely not something worth traveling down to southern Brooklyn to try.  I wanted to order the spumoni in the hopes that it would live up to expectations, but our service was so bad that my friends and I ended up getting the check and leaving after we finished eating our pizza.  The hostess was nice and got us sat quickly, but the waiter and his attendants were not up to par and didn't come over to us until 15 minutes had passed. And even then we had to ask twice for someone to come over to our table.  It definitely seemed like we were being ignored.  After we ordered our drinks and food, it took another 15 minutes to receive the bread (our drinks also took a while). The section we were sat in definitely did not look busy so we had no idea why we were waiting so long.  It took 25 minutes for my friend to get his house salad.  We literally didn't receive our pizza pies until 40 minutes after we had ordered.  Around that time, a table of four was seated next to us.  They received their wine, salads, appetizers, and pizza within a 20 minute time frame, which was ridiculous. They were seated in the same section as us with the same waiter.  Clearly, there was unequal treatment between our tables, and when my friend told the waiter that we were not getting good service, he couldn't have been more apathetic.  We asked if we could get a discount of our bill, and he returned and told us that the manager said there was nothing that could be done. At that point, we just asked for the bill and skipped dessert.  The tables around us clearly got better treatment from our waiter.  After we finished paying, we had been there over an hour (a ridiculous amount of time to wait for two pizza pies).  After this horrible service experience and lackluster pizza, my friends and I definitely won't be returning to L&B again.",2.0

"Hands down the best value and Pizza..No One has a Sicilian square like an L&B square. the regular isn't bad either...I've had ones a little burnt, or under cooked..but almost always amazing..Indoor dining is pretty good, but again be prepared on weekend for a long line.

What can I say other than this is the best square slice I've ever had. I really enjoy the middle slice better than the outside crust but to each his own.

"More about the entire package than the individual components.The pizza is decent, more on the saucy side than the cheesy.

"4 stars for the pizza. I just love the unique approach to the Sicilian slice. The consistency of the crust along with the delicious sauce and caramelized Parmesan on top make this irresistible to me.Make sure you know how to order. You'll ask for a ""square"" slice for Sicilian (and it's ok to ask for a specific piece/area of the pie) or a ""round"" (which is really a triangular slice, which is essentially an above-average Brooklyn slice - good but not spectacular).There's a separate line for spumoni, and you will want the pistachio.Service is kind of what you'd expect, but the entire crew will thank you if you are generous enough to drop a dollar into the tip jar.I have not eaten in the restaurant - just the pizzeria - but a friend who dines regularly at Rao's claims L&B's food is right up there among the best. An extraordinary claim that I cannot yet personally verify (until my friend takes me to Rao's.)",4.0

My colleagues had been raving about their pies so much that I couldn't resist but make the trip to a part of town that is quite spartan. As every other review has already attested, there is a separate window for whole pies and to be sure, its the economical option. I got a sicilian which I think stands for, 'load up the dough' and slogged my way thru two slices. It really wasn't my thing and perhaps I'll make a trip there again to try the round new york style pies but even the sauce was average for New York standards.",2.0

We ordered what they're ""famous"" for- the Sicilian pizza.

"My review of L&B falls under the wanted-to-love-it-badly-but-it-just-didn't-measure-up category. My colleagues had been raving about their pies so much that I couldn't resist but make the trip to a part of town that is quite spartan. As every other review has already attested, there is a separate window for whole pies and to be sure, its the economical option. I got a sicilian which I think stands for, 'load up the dough' and slogged my way thru two slices. It really wasn't my thing and perhaps I'll make a trip there again to try the round new york style pies but even the sauce was average for New York standards.",2.0

One of my favorites. We order from here often. Half a tray means 12 square slices of heaven. The seafood is fantastic with big portions. I love the fried calamari. The pasta dishes are good but I'm a little bit bias because I'm Italian. We usually order for pick up because delivery could take an hour or sometimes more. (I only live about 12 blocks away.)

"It's worth coming to the ends of the earth in Brooklyn for the pizza here.It's like the mini J&R of Italian restaurants: they have 3 or 4 different places in a row, each specializing in a different food: on the far left in the corner is the pizzeria, followed by the ice cream shop that has the famous Spumoni, followed by a counter for takeout of pizzas and pastas, and lastly the sit-down restaurant that has a full menu of Italian food.We came here to get the much talked about and hyped Square Slice at the pizzeria.The exchange when my wife asked for a cup of water was pretty hilarious to watch:- Her: May I please have a cup of water?- Pizza Guy: $1.50- Her: For tap water?!?- Pizza Guy: [pauses for a bit] FINE, GIVE ME A CUP (gesturing angrily to the stack of plastic cups behind her).In spite of this abusive treatment, I'll stick with the high rating because they serve up a really authentic, delicious slice of pizza, and they brought out a piping hot, fresh pie right when we got there after a long journey. It's a pretty bare bones menu in the pizzeria (yelp.com/biz_photos/l-an…), but that's all you really need. Just spend $2.25 to get one of those delicious square slices, and you'll leave happy.After wolfing down the delicious slices under the spiteful/watchful eyes of the pizza guys, we strolled next door to try some of that Spumoni ($2.50 for a small cup). I really liked it. It's kind of like if gelato and Italian Ices had a baby.By the way, the square slice here is way better than at Di Fara, mostly because you can walk right in, grab a seat easily at the plenty available tables, and you don't have to wait arbitrarily long times to just get a single slice, depending on how slow the single guy making the pies there is. The treatment you get is pretty shabby at either one, but it doesn't sting as badly here since you don't have to wait forever to get your slice. Also, the slices here aren't as ludicrously priced ($2.25 instead of $4).If I ever get the urge for some real Italian food in an authentic setting and want to travel insanely far away from home for it for some reason, I would definitely come back here to try out the restaurant as well after getting another square slice.",5.0

"It's no DiFara but it's pretty damn good!The sauce is what sets L&B above the rest.  They know that's their key ingredient which is why they put it on top of the cheese instead of under it.

So don't look at it that way.L&B's pizza doesn't blow my mind the way Totonno's or Di Fara's does. But I love it nonetheless. Here are some important things to consider, based on my many experiences there:1) the L&B experience isn't only about pizza. It's about Brooklyn in summer, spumoni in a ""garden,"" mirrored ceilings, being encouraged to try the ""chef's table"" every time you go, discovering you've been non-consensually served the ""chef's table"" every time you go. 2) But it is also about pizza. SICILLIAN pizza. Do Not Order Thin Crust Pies Here. I disagree with all the snobs who say the thin crust is ""repulsive,"" but I see no point in getting it. Their Sicillian pies are to die for. Truly delicious -- go for the corner slice. (Always go for the corner).3) If they bring you the chef's table -- enjoy the artichoke hearts and seemingly endless parade of entrees you would never have ordered. If you're vegetarian, tell them! to prevent the ongoing arrival of STILL MORE meatballs.4) Enjoy the dusty tray of post-dinner liquors brought to the table for your perusal! THIS IS L&B AT ITS BEST! And if you don't accept a tiny glass of limoncello from the man with the tray... just, WHO ARE YOU? And how did you end up at L&B?5) Let them bring you an enormous spumoni dessert to share with your whole table, and neighboring tables, if we're honest. 6) If the chef comes out to thank you and offers you a size XXXL tee-shirt -- TAKE IT. P.S. As closing time nears, you stand a shot at influencing the music selection and MAY be able to strike up a dance party with the hostess.P.P.S. I felt unsure how to answer the TV question.

We sat outside on the patio and there was just droves of people coming in and not enough people to accommodate everyone. I also tried some of my friends meatball hero and there was just really no flavor.

You feel like you're with family...but with out any of the stress! :) While the constant waves of people coming in and out of the restaurant or grabbing takeout of pizza and/or icecream is definitely convincing of this third generations success, you can tell that everyone in the restaurant is happy and loves the place as much as the customers!!

"This pizza is worth the hour trek I made out to Gravesend to try it! I was a bit scared it may have been overhyped, as it happens often, but this was not the case. This is probably the best pizza I've had in the city. Each square slice is only $2.50, and worth every penny. I ended up going back for another square, and I'd already had two. Instead of your typical pizza, the cheese is put on the dough first, followed by the sauce and a sprinkling of parmesan cheese. It may seem like your average cheese pizza, but I assure you it's not. They have a nice sized patio for eating outdoors, and the staff is really nice. The hype is real. Make your way out here as the weather gets nice, and enjoy a slice or two or three!",5.0
"The square pie is a unique piece of delicious heaven. Best Sicilian slice in the city.The regular pie is average, (maybe a little below in fact)spumoni is stupendous! Best spumoni in the city. Loses a star for the bathroom (ugh) and hostess who relegated me to the outside bathroom.",4.0
"They do square slices a little different it, with the sauce on top on the cheese.. But it works!! The pizza is great here, I definitely  recommend you trying a slice it will be worth it!!",5.0
I went there because it was featured in one if the travel channel shows. Definitely not the best Sicilian or pizza in Brooklyn. The service was terrible and the pizza was cold.We ordered a shrimp parmigiana and that was cold too... Money was totally wasted. Travel channel should do a little more research.,1.0
"ok so about 3 years ago I lived in bensonhurst Brooklyn, minutes from this place.. For years I had heard people rave about the pizza. I honestly do not know what all the hype is about. The pizza in my opinion, had too much sauce and not enough cheese. The lines were insane, and the customer service was just horrible. We sat outside on the patio and there was just droves of people coming in and not enough people to accommodate everyone. I also tried some of my friends meatball hero and there was just really no flavor. It was like eating a ball of mush. gross ....Sorry but tourists may like this place but when you live in the land of Italians and there a million competing places to eat, this place just doesn't make the cut...Next....",1.0
"The delicious Square Pizza with its rich, thick tomato sauce ON TOP of a layer of mozzarella and crispy, yet soft dough in the center of the slice has been THE PIZZA for generations of Brooklynites. They also have a full service restaurant that serves large portions of very good pasta and traditional Italian dishes, in addition to pizza, which is very popular. Their excellent ice creams and ices/spumoni serve as excellent desserts, as well as stand alone treats on a summer day (or any day). The setting is casual and unpretentious. Worth a trip from anywhere!",4.0
"L & B Spunomi Gardens is the most delicious food and best experience in all of Brooklyn (dare I say... NYC as well!) From the moment you enter, you're treated like you have your own private dining experience (even though there are TONS of people in the place!) You feel like you're with family...but with out any of the stress! :) While the constant waves of people coming in and out of the restaurant or grabbing takeout of pizza and/or icecream is definitely convincing of this third generations success, you can tell that everyone in the restaurant is happy and loves the place as much as the customers!!

"Hands down the best dining experience I had while visiting the NYC area during the holidays.  Came here with a group of 8 after a friend suggested we try out the pizza.  We ended up getting some of the best customer service I've ever received thanks to Danny or Denny (I believe) and the other staff that served us that night.  He just went above and beyond to make sure we had the best night and I truly thank him for that.We had shrimp appetizers, some kind of fried fish, breaded mussels or clams (I just know they were delicious, ok!) salad, steak, fish, pizza, fries, and the biggest dessert I've ever seen!!!  I literally wanted to throw up (Hunger Games style, as a member of my group put it) so that I could keep eating more, MORE, MORE! lol....pizza was great, but I truly enjoyed the rest of my meal as well...to the point that I was wondering how they managed to serve me the best broccoli I've ever had in my life (lol).  I will definitely come back if I am ever in NYC again!!",5.0

"My family and I went to this restaurant because it had good yelp reviews and it was close to where we were staying. When we got there it seemed cool because there is a restaurant area and s fast food area outside. I got the Vodka sauce pasta with shrimp and it was really good. It was creamy and tasted great. Then came dessert sand it was the best thing ever. We got the Spumoni and it was sooooo good. It's got a kind of chocolate ball at the bottom with cherries, vanilla ice cream and chocolate ice cream. Then the rest is pistachio ocean with whipped cream on top. Then a bunch of ice cream cones filled with chocolate vanilla swirl ice cream. It was so good my family made it a tradition!",5.0
"If you are not a fan of crowds or long lines --- stay home. The pizza is legendary. In my opinion, the square pie is good, but not the best. Visiting L & B is a Brooklyn pizza dining rite of passage. You go, you enjoy a square slice, some spumoni and the atmosphere and you cross it off your culinary bucket list.I have never had a bad experience dining inside. The dining room can get crowded and loud - be forewarned. The food is prepared well. I love the cold seafood salad.

"I have put off writing this review because there are some places that are just so hallowed that even the thought of writing about all the reasons to love them becomes a daunting process. First, get the square slice. The square slice is a thing of beauty. For the people who had a bad square slice experience here, I don't know what to say. The square slice here is usually baked to perfection. The crust achieves that perfect crunchy-on-the-outside-and-perfectly-chewy-when-bitten consistency. The sauce recipe is probably a well-guarded secret since this is easily the best sauce I have had on any pizza slice in NYC (and I have had a LOT of pizza here in the three decades I have lived in NYC). The cheese is melted under the sauce and marries itself to the crust.What you get is a symphony of pizza flavors that (when done right) will leave you wondering how you will ever consume a slice from anywhere else again. Now, about the spumoni. The spumoni is best enjoyed during NYC's dog days of summer. Get the pistachio-mixed. Trust me on this. It's a brilliant layering of flavors with just the right amount of crunch and creamy goodness. L&B is an NYC institution.",5.0

Had a square slice. It was okay. Would have been much better if it were hot. The rainbow spumoni was awesome. Probably wouldn't trek out here from the city though.,3.0
"The Sicilian pie is soooo good! I ordered the regular cheese pie, next time I'll try extra cheese and a different topping. The tiramasu ice cream was yummy too.",5.0
"My kids love the pizza,  it is popular open late and easy to get to",3.0
Great food. Pizza is out of this world. Long wait but well worth it! You must try the spumoni!,5.0
The atmosphere is open to the public I like that. The squares are amazingthe. The ice cream is also great and tasty. I been going for a very long time since im a little boy.Parking is so so .The price is a little overpriced but I still go. Thank you guys for the great Sicilian square pizza.,4.0
"I recently came back to this establishment and found out they raised their prices by $1 on their half trays and $.25 on their slices. I have no problem with that but I noticed that the half tray I ordered seemed off. It was smaller than usual and tasted differently. The slices were literally half the thickness of the old ones and the sauce tasted so bland/generic. It wasn't as great as it was back when I originally had it and my mom who is no stranger to the hyped up Sicilian slice started questioning the pie as well,  wondering what happened to it. I hope their quality is not depreciating and that it was a just a bad batch...",2.0

"It isn't what it used to be :(I've been in Brooklyn my whole life and I love L&B. But they seem to have lost their way slightly.I used to dream of that saucey hidden cheese pizza when I would pull up and fight to find a parking spot. I am not sure what changed; perhaps different ingredients or the kitchen was a little off that day but it just wasn't the same.It was STILL delicious and amazing but when you've had L&B as many times as I have, and the fact I am giving 4 stars imagine what it would be like if they cooked the pizza the way I remember?Regardless though, the crust is great, their cheese is very authentic and seems of good quality, and don't forget the sauce. I just wish their trays of pizza were more evened out in terms of sauce. One slice had almost no sauce while another slice was absolutely drenched.But regardless, this is a Brooklyn gem and perhaps it was an off day. I will come back soon and hopefully update this to 5 stars :)",4.0
"The question is, is the Sicilian slice that good that I would come all the way to a neighborhood I rarely or if ever go to? No they are not worth the trip or going out the way, I mean its just pizza. However, if you happen to be in the neighbor it's definitely worth checking out. I prefer the regular slice, but their Sicilian slice is the best I've had. The crust is thick, soft, and chewy with the right amount of cheese and tomato sauce. This is a great spot for the summer because there is tons of outdooring seating.  And the spumoni* here is a must try. Perfect treat after your meal and there are so many flavors!___________* Italian ice cream made with layers of different colors and flavors",4.0
"L & B used to be my favorite place to go for pizza and spumoni amongst other foods that they serve.   They have totally gone down hill.  I don't know what kind of waiters they hired but, they pick and choose the people they give good service to.  I have gone there 3 separate times got 3 different waiters  tip each of them well above 20%, not what they  deserved for their terrible service and never received good service.  My recent experience was horrendous, not only did it take someone 15 minutes to come to my table with only 2 other patrons in the restaurant they bring me this disgusting eggplant parm sandwich ice cold and horrible, never even came back to ask if everything was ok.  This was not the first bad experience, this was the third.  I have never had to write something bad about a place, but, I think people should be aware of what goes on there.  If you know the waiters personally maybe you got a shot at good service and good food, if not your on your own to an unpleasant experience.  I am in the hospitality business a long time and I treat patrons like gold, I don't think I should have to pay for someone to treat me bad and give me bad food to boot!  I have heard some other bad stories about this place but didn't believe it at first, I guess I had to experience it for myself.",1.0

"Made the trek out last Saturday night to try the World Famous Sicilian Pie. Not only was I not let down by the pizza, my entire experience while there was pretty fantastic. 2 of my friends and I went closer to closing time, so there was no wait to get seated indoors. The pie came out pretty quickly too and did not disappoint! We got pepperoni, sausage, and mushrooms. The base was deliciously doughy and crust was nice and crispy, tomato sauce was on the sweeter side (I really like that though), and I don't know what kind of mushrooms they use, but they sure are yummy! Really sad that I couldn't eat more than 2 slices (I know, weak!). The people who run this place are absolute sweethearts as well. We were loitering at our table because 1) maybe we were secretly wondering if any of us could fit another slice in, and 2) we were trying to figure out what bars were in the area that we could head out to. We asked one of the many nice servers for suggestions, and he didn't hesitate to give a genuine, helpful answer. Then, as we were loitering around some more, instead of being like many other places would probably be giving us signals that we needed to get out, they said they were going to give us dessert and offered us cappuccinos as well! I was expecting a scoop of Spumoni or something, but no...they came out with their crazy huge dessert plate that was chock full of everything (cheesecake, chocolate covered chocolate and vanilla Spumoni topped with pistachio Spumoni, sprinkle covered ice cream cones...!) I especially liked the ice cream cone (cause who doesn't like ice cream cones, and I liked the sherbet that filled the cone) and the chocolate covered Spumoni - vanilla especially was suuuper thick and creamy.My experience was top-notch, which is why I'm not hesitating to write a review to toot their horns - L&B deserves it.",5.0

I consider myself a pizza critic. I have had plenty of pizza from places that friends consider the best pizza in nyc. This is truly the best pizza I have ever eaten.  I ordered a large round pie and I had to go back for a second one. I wanted to try the ice cream but my carbs were already on overload. I will be back! Their are two lines one for slices one for pies and they move really quickly. There is seating outside there is a window to order pasta and another for ice cream.

The dough is soft and pillowy, and the combination of that against the cheese was heavenly. We also tried the spumoni, which was tasty.We left and made it a few blocks away and realized we forgot out souvenir photo from Coney Island, so we went back and it was still there, set aside for us.

"I've had the square Sicilian about a handful of times and I tried so hard to like it. I also gave too many chances for this place.

I don't know about anyone else, but the sauce was salty to me, I suppose some of the people I shared it with also agreed it was salty too. It just didn't sit right. Pizza isn't pizza if the sauce was not right and the lack of cheese. Crust and dough was burnt every time we had this. It looked like someone just vomited their pasta dinner onto the pie. I gave 2 too many chances. This place is just ok, not blown away and not quite understanding what the hype about the pizza is about. The staff here never seemed friendly to me, they weren't mean but they weren't welcoming either especially if you're slow in ordering or not sure what you want, you might irritate them. They seem to look miserable every time I go. WIth that being said, they make the sicilian pie at a very fast rate. It took literally 5 minutes and they tossed the box at the counter for me to take.

"On the last day of my rotation at the CVS on 18th Ave/New Utrecht, my preceptor got us L&B's Sicilian squares and they were amazing!! I normally don't rate pizza places because all pizza tastes the same to me (if they have the same toppings that is haha) but L&B's Sicilian squares just left such a big impression on me that I had to rate this place! They cook the squares so that the center is a little undercooked so that it's chewy on the inside and crunchy on the outside! YUM! I gobbled down 2 squares with no problem and also swiped one to bring home for later but, being the clumsy oaf that I am, it dropped on the floor while I was walking home :( Don't worry, I'll be back L&B!!!",4.0
"Spumoni makes some pretty good pizza and ice cream in Brooklyn.  Their pizza is definitely a little thicker than the regular NY slices (which I prefer), but it's delicious when you eat it fresh.  Their Spumoni ice cream is awesome - I love the pistachio flavor tied in!  It really gives it some unique flavoring that no one else is really able to give.  Things are a smidgeon more expensive here than other pizza spots, but it's worth the wait.  Nothing fancy about here though ... Very casual with some outdoor tables in the summertime.  Haven't been back since then so I can't speak to how it's like in the other months of the year, but this will surely be a summer spot I frequent.",4.0

"Came here during a little pizza tour of Brooklyn I did with my girlfriend on a random Sunday nightWe each got a square slice and some arancini parmigiana. The pizza was definitely on point. Nice big Sicilian slices that were hot and fresh for a very reasonable $2.50 a slice. Dough was crispy on the bottom and airy in the middle, but it had a lot of body and was able to hold the zesty sauce and nicely layered cheese, just the way a real Sicilian slice is supposed to be.I'd give this place a perfect rating, but our arancini parmigiana took over 30 minutes to be ready even though the guy told us 10. By the time we got it it was cold and just not very appetizing at that point. Other than the slight arancini mix up (which we were ultimately comped, which salvaged the review from 3 to 4 stars), L&B Spumoni is a classic staple of Brooklyn pizzeria history that everyone needs to try if they haven't.

"On the last day of my rotation at the CVS on 18th Ave/New Utrecht, my preceptor got us L&B's Sicilian squares and they were amazing!! I normally don't rate pizza places because all pizza tastes the same to me (if they have the same toppings that is haha) but L&B's Sicilian squares just left such a big impression on me that I had to rate this place! They cook the squares so that the center is a little undercooked so that it's chewy on the inside and crunchy on the outside! YUM! I gobbled down 2 squares with no problem and also swiped one to bring home for later but, being the clumsy oaf that I am, it dropped on the floor while I was walking home :( Don't worry, I'll be back L&B!!!",4.0
"Spumoni makes some pretty good pizza and ice cream in Brooklyn.  Their pizza is definitely a little thicker than the regular NY slices (which I prefer), but it's delicious when you eat it fresh.  Their Spumoni ice cream is awesome - I love the pistachio flavor tied in!  It really gives it some unique flavoring that no one else is really able to give.  Things are a smidgeon more expensive here than other pizza spots, but it's worth the wait.  Nothing fancy about here though ... Very casual with some outdoor tables in the summertime.  Haven't been back since then so I can't speak to how it's like in the other months of the year, but this will surely be a summer spot I frequent.",4.0
I always come when it gets dark out me and friends always get a half tray of the square.After that? Dessert!! We always get the spumoni icecream my favorite. Oh and it gets pretty packed here too that even cops have a hard time finding a parking spot.,4.0
Their square slice is absolutely fantastic highly recommend! And their round slice is very good as well!,5.0
"Came here during a little pizza tour of Brooklyn I did with my girlfriend on a random Sunday nightWe each got a square slice and some arancini parmigiana. The pizza was definitely on point. Nice big Sicilian slices that were hot and fresh for a very reasonable $2.50 a slice. Dough was crispy on the bottom and airy in the middle, but it had a lot of body and was able to hold the zesty sauce and nicely layered cheese, just the way a real Sicilian slice is supposed to be.I'd give this place a perfect rating, but our arancini parmigiana took over 30 minutes to be ready even though the guy told us 10. By the time we got it it was cold and just not very appetizing at that point. Other than the slight arancini mix up (which we were ultimately comped, which salvaged the review from 3 to 4 stars), L&B Spumoni is a classic staple of Brooklyn pizzeria history that everyone needs to try if they haven't. You can't go wrong if you're in the neighborhood.",4.0

"The first time I came to Spumoni was after a back laboring day of moving me out of Bayridge and into Kensington last year.

"The sicilian squares did not dissapoint! I was so excited to go here after leaving the Mad Decent Block Party in Coney Island. The setting is really nice, they have a restaurant sit-down area and a large, open, outdoor area with plenty of tables for anyone looking to just grab a couple slices. We ordered a half-tray of their famous squares (12 slices for $20) and each bite was as good as the next. The sauce in itself sets it apart from your average slice of New York pizza, it was what every pizza place should strive for! Then the crunch at the bottom of every slice and at the end with every crust offered the best combination of textures one could ask for! After our pizza we decided to try their homemade italian ices and let me tell you, we did not regret this decision! We ordered a small spumoni ($3) which consisted of chocolate, vanilla and pistachio flavors. Now their homemade italian ices isn't quite like your average cup, this cup of Italian ices is a little more creamy and smooth than the average ices you would get at Ralph's or Rita's.

"This place is famous for their Sicilian slices and spumoni, and it's easy to see why they've been loved for 75 years after taking one bite of their perfectly prepared slices!Each square is perfectly portioned, with a texture that's perfectly crispy near the bottom but super chewy, almost undercooked in the middle. It's almost like a savory nougat or caramel bar, and while that sounds strange at first, one bite and you'll see what I mean! The cheese and the sauce that rests on top is super delicious and while it can get sort of messy, it's okay because you'll want to be covered in this pizza if it was physically possible!There's not much more to say about the pizza, since it's pretty simple but executed flawlessly.I'll have to confess, I've never had spumoni before coming here. I never even knew what spumoni was! It is a layered ice cream (in this case with Chocolate, Vanilla, and Pistachio), and the texture of this one was sort of like a creamy Italian ice with the flavors of gelato. I really liked it, and definitely will be back for more!The service is super friendly, and the crowds here are fun to watch. I cracked up a few times watching some clowns honking while trying to get around the double parked people picking up pizza.Overall, I'm glad I made this stop on my summer pizza crawl, and I highly recommend it to anyone that wants a great little bite of Sicily right in Brooklyn!

"L & B Spumoni Gardens is like a beer garden but for pizza. The space is huge and open air with lots of picnic tables.

There is a reason why L & B is called Spumoni Gardens!!! I loved the spumoni and I didn't think I would. It was a mixture of chocolate, vanilla, and pistachio Italian ice but it was mostly pistachio. The pistachio was a hideously fake Hulk colored green but it was so fierce! There were bits of roasted pistachios in it and it was just so good. Never tasted anything like it. L & B puts Rita and Ralph to shame. The other flavor we chose was pomegranate and it was also amazing. Together they even made a good pairing. The pomegranate ice was a great consistency.

The hype is well-deserved, for sicilian - you're not going to get much better this this!We also ordered the Arancini (Italian rice balls with a meat/peas filling) which took more than 30 minutes to make. I think they forgot about our order because when we got it, it was lukewarm. Thankfully, the server felt bad and we ended up getting the food on the house.

I went here for a friend's birthday party. Best pizza I've had in a long time. The take out area and seating areas were packed. People were eating their slices right there on the sidewalk. Nothing like this sicilian style pizza and a nice cold beer to wash it down.,5.0

"Dont do the Chef's Table! I took a party of 14 Adults and was charged $85 per person. We didnt have any alcohol and the food was not gourmet food. So, why $85 a person? - Because it was Father's Day.I contacted the manager and was told that the rates are higher on Father's Day & Mother's Day. After a long talk, he finally agreed to credit me back $200 and a $50 Gift Card.L&B's is a great place to enjoy a classic Pizza, and good Italian Food. But, the Chef's Table is over-rated and way too expensive.Next time, I'll just order from the menu.",3.0

"Pizza, Pizza, Pizza!!L&B Spumoni Gardens.  Deep in Brooklyn.  Love it!I had their Sicilian slice.  The dough was fluffy with a light layer of tomato sauce and cheese underneath.  $2.25  yelp.com/biz_photos/vyoA…I also had tried Spumoni (Vanilla, Chocolate, and Pistachio).  It actually has real pistachios in it.  YUM!  yelp.com/biz_photos/vyoA…Good cheap eats.  Enjoy!",5.0
"L&B's serves the PERFECT slice of sicilian pizza... I've never been a fan of sicilian until I ate here. The dough is fresh, soft on the top and crispy on the bottom with a thick layer of quality mozzarella cheese and a generous spread of savory tomato paste. The hype is well-deserved, for sicilian - you're not going to get much better this this!We also ordered the Arancini (Italian rice balls with a meat/peas filling) which took more than 30 minutes to make. I think they forgot about our order because when we got it, it was lukewarm. Thankfully, the server felt bad and we ended up getting the food on the house.

"I knew that we were going to sample real New York City pizza during our visit here, and have always believed that the best slices could be found not in overpriced Manhattan, but Brooklyn.  It was a choice between DiFara's Pizza (which has been featured on America's Test Kitchen), or L&B, featured on Man vs. Food.  Both looked great, but we decided on L&B because they also offered Italian ice after the meal, which admittedly swayed us.  I won't lie - we were kind of shocked by the surroundings.  Can we say sketch, boys and girls?  Seriously, a backdrop of high-rise projects wasn't what I'd had in mind - I felt like we were getting ready to dine at the (now-demolished) Murphy Homes in Baltimore, a prospect I wasn't looking forward to.  Parking was nearly impossible - there were cars lined up outside in the middle of the road and we were about to give up when we saw an empty spot across the street.  We grabbed it, and counted ourselves lucky.  There is zero organization to the ordering line(s) here.  People were just milling about all over the line and we didn't know where to go so that we didn't jump in front of anyone.  I hate ordering systems like this because you run the risk of being rude and cutting in front of people - a star off for that.  I was having so much anxiety that my boyfriend gently suggested for me to find a table, he'd order.  (Yes, it was gently - no ""shaddap, lemme do dis"".  Heh.)  We ordered half a tray of the Sicilian with pepperoni and mushrooms - yes, I KNOW, it's sacrilege to order the Sicilian with toppings, but TFB (too fuggin bad), it's how we roll.  At 19 dollars for half a tray (12 slices), the price difference is significant.  Besides, we didn't know if this was going to be good or not, so we went with the larger size - after all, if it sucked, we could just dump it somewhere, maybe in Central Park.Anyhow, it didn't take too long for the half tray to be done, maybe 15 minutes or so.  LoML brought it back with a couple of Cokes, and away we went.  Real New York City pizza.  This better be good.We opened the box to huge, greasy, saucy goodness.  My word, it was just beautiful.  I picked up an end piece and dug in - whoa.  This is some EXCELLENT pizza.  The bread was tender on the inside, crispy on the bottom, with just the right amount of melty cheese in the middle.  The sauce was just the right level of sweet and salty, perfectly balanced.  The mushrooms were perfect, the pepperoni just biting enough on the palate.  If this represents Brooklyn, I think I want to move here.  My boyfriend was enjoying it, too.I could only eat 2 slices - my boyfriend, 4.  I know, we're wimps.  But we wanted to save some room for that lovely ice cream.  I finished it off with a peach Italian ice that made me want to sing ""Ave Maria"".  Seriously.  This Italian ice was like no other I've ever had.  It was sweet, airy, light, and drippy.  It was wonderful.  My boyfriend got a shake - I don't even know what kind it was, it tasted like chocolate and hazelnut, but it was definitely delicious.So what did happen to the other 6 slices?  They didn't end up in Central Park after all, but in our bellies after a quick buzz in the microwave - in Baltimore.  Yes, they were even that good after we got home.  We sat in our bedroom, slowly munching the last of it, saying to each other that we'd best enjoy it while it lasts.  L&B Spumoni Gardens will definitely be on our list when we return to Brooklyn.  And we will.  After all, I have to start searching for that house.  :D",4.0

I ordered the fettuccine Alfredo and thought it was okay so I ate it. Later that night I had extreme stomach pain!! Ended up throwing up most of the night and the next day. Couldn't keep anything down for 2 days! Last weekend I decided to give it another try  thinking that maybe it would be better. WRONG AGAIN! I had a sicilian slice and the rice balls. Later that night I had stomach pains again and felt nauseous most of the night. I will not be returning. After so many years of being open the quality of the food starts to diminish, they had a good run with me though.",1.0
"The food is fine, but your don't really go here for the food. It is mainly for the awesome experience!It is good red sauce italian food with cold red and slightly jammy red wine. The line is forever.",3.0
"The square pizza it's pretty good. Not the best, but still good. Soft and doughy, and good sauce. But the spumoni it's excellent! It's like a cross between ice cream and water ice. Light and delicious, and you don't feel full and bloated like you often do after ice cream or gelatto.

"Did not like this pizza. Just not for me. The pecorino taste was too intense and I am not a fan of pecorino to begin with. Also found the tomato sauce to be a tad too sweet.

"I traveled to L&B with a group of friends anticipating the best scicillian slice that we've ever tasted.  We ordered, we ate, and were still hungry.  We then ordered a regular pie (round)... we weren't impressed at all.  However, we went next door and got some of their ice cream........ that was delicious!  Folks from queens shouldn't bother venturing out to this place, but if you're a local, it's a treat.",3.0

"This place is going downhill.  Same happened to Joe's on Carmine.  It's still decent, but it's hit or miss now.  Sometimes I get lucky with a square reminding me of what it used to be like.  The dough/crust has somehow grown bigger every year and is just too much density now.  A good square here was pillowy soft and light.  Now, two squares might make you bloated like the stay puft marshmallow man",3.0

I was, however, blown away with how good the round slice was. Honestly, it was one of the best slices of pizza I've ever had, and I've lived in NYC for most of my life.After my pizza was consumed, I had a small spumoni, which was delicious.

"This place is really awesome.   The food here is great.  I ordered notte di natale which is linguine with lobster meat, shrimp and scallops.   It is expensivr but very fresh.The service is what you would expect from a place that is busy all the time.  They arent over friendly by any means but not so rude that you get offended.The only reason I didnt give them 5 stars is due to waiting over an hour for my food.  I understand they were busy but it was still frustrating.",4.0
"Horrible pizza.  Well, at least the kind we got ... thick bread with, I think, maybe, there was a some cheese (I wouldn't testify in court that there was cheese, though) covered by disgusting sauce.Looked to me like you could get a regular pizza (with cheese on top) but my companion wanted this other thing that the restaurant calls pizza.  I call it gross.The spumoni wasn't ice cream ... I'm not sure what it was ... a half-hour later, it was still sitting in the Styrofoam cup in the same state as it was when it was served to us ... a colorful scoop of SOMETHING.  It wasn't melting so it couldn't have been ice cream ... and it couldn't have been ice ... I don't know what it was ... a scoop of chemicals or something, I guess.",1.0
We came here in a group on a Friday night. We purchased some of the boxes of the square pizzas for a relatively fair price. The pizza was delicious even though it was a bit saucy and did not have much cheese.All my friends were also raving about the spumoni ice cream but I didn't get to try it. They have a nice seating outside area and are close to the beach. This will be a perfect spot to group a meal after the beach.,4.0
"The parking spots are always filled during the warmer months but people are usually in and out so it's not a long wait for a spot. I sat outside which had plenty of seating. I do love sitting outside on nicer days and having their air conditioned dine in as an option. I went inside and asked for a high chair and the generous waiter offered his assistance with carrying it outside to my table.I ordered a square (for me) & round (for my daughter.) When craving for a Sicilian, this place is hands down the best. I had what was leftover of my daughter's slice and it was mediocre. I can easily find a slice that taste better elsewhere. For dessert, I shared a watermelon icy with my daughter. I'm not a huge icy fan so I wasn't that impressed. When I dined in previously, I remember the ceasar salad was tasty and the potato croquettes were a hit.",4.0
"Holy crap, this is fine pizza.I've been craving good pizza for awhile.  When my friends said they were going to order from the best pizza place in town, I got excited and a little skeptical.  But alas, this was amazing!!  I can't wait to have another slice.There's something about it, but it doesn't taste like any pizza I've had before.  Yet I recognize it as pizza.  Sicilian is definitely the way to go - it's less greasy, more flavorful, and fills you up in the right way.  I felt satiated and happy after 3 pieces.Definitely try this place out - it's out of this world.  And just plain cheese.  I can't imaging what would happen if you added toppings to this awesome canvas!",5.0
"I was introduced to the cult of L&B Spumoni Gardens by a friend who was practically weaned on the homemade ice cream that gives this institution its name. There's no garden in evidence though, just an expanse of concrete with industrial picnic tables crowded with happy families. The complex includes two takeout stations: one for pizza and the other for spumoni, ices and other ice creams. There's also a sit down restaurant, with a selection of pastas and appetizers and main dishes. We split up, and I headed for the pizza window (made famous by a series of videos from the Jimmy Kimmel show that can be found on YouTube). The only choice is square Sicilian or slice of round. My friend rounded up two cups of Spumoni. The pizza was hot and fresh and tasty, but actually improved as leftovers reheated later. The spumoni is American style ice cream - not gelato - with chunks of pistachios laced through the vivid green, white and brown swirl. Better than the food is the people watching. Multi-generational family groups, lavishly tattooed couples, elderly men, and lots of children. Everyone united in their love for pizza and ice cream. No wonder L&B has been in business since 1938. It's a winning combination.",3.0
"More like 3.5 stars. I wenty here a few weeks ago with my family. It was decent.. perhaps it was slightly above decent, but only slightly. The pasta sauce felt like it could have had a less sharp taste to it. My uncle ordered a slice with pepperoni and it looked like a plain slice, reheated, with pepperoni thrown on top of it. The calamari was pretty tasteless. The food itself is pretty good, but can be improved. The ice cream is slightly better, bumping it up to almost 4 stars in my book.Definitely a place worth trying out for their Sicilian and ice cream, but not worth going to if you're expecting an amazing Italian dinner.",4.0

Virtually no lines and we were easily able to grab some seats.I got a round and a square slice. I'm not really a big fan of Sicilian pizza (too much dough for me), but I thought this was very tasty. I was, however, blown away with how good the round slice was. Honestly, it was one of the best slices of pizza I've ever had, and I've lived in NYC for most of my life.After my pizza was consumed, I had a small spumoni, which was delicious. My review will merely echo the thoughts and sentiments of like-minded individuals, so all I can tell you, reader, is that you simply must try this place out for yourself.",5.0
"Don't believe the hype. I didn't think the pizza here was all that great. I had the square slice, maybe I just don't get it. The spumoni ice cream was just aaight. Maybe the sit down food is better.",2.0
"Some of the best pizza you'll ever have.  I've also had a regular pie from them, but that's just average.  I swear their price increases have been pretty rapid.  I always order a half tray, which now costs $20 or $21.  Only a few years ago it was $16ish.  There is also a restaurant there, but my review is strictly for the pizza.  Quick, fast, and delicious .. can't go wrong.",5.0
"This place is really awesome.   The food here is great.  I ordered notte di natale which is linguine with lobster meat, shrimp and scallops.   It is expensivr but very fresh.The service is what you would expect from a place that is busy all the time.  They arent over friendly by any means but not so rude that you get offended.The only reason I didnt give them 5 stars is due to waiting over an hour for my food.  I understand they were busy but it was still frustrating.",4.0
"Horrible pizza.  Well, at least the kind we got ... thick bread with, I think, maybe, there was a some cheese (I wouldn't testify in court that there was cheese, though) covered by disgusting sauce.Looked to me like you could get a regular pizza (with cheese on top) but my companion wanted this other thing that the restaurant calls pizza.  I call it gross.The spumoni wasn't ice cream ... I'm not sure what it was ... a half-hour later, it was still sitting in the Styrofoam cup in the same state as it was when it was served to us ... a colorful scoop of SOMETHING.  It wasn't melting so it couldn't have been ice cream ... and it couldn't have been ice ... I don't know what it was ... a scoop of chemicals or something, I guess.",1.0
We came here in a group on a Friday night. We purchased some of the boxes of the square pizzas for a relatively fair price. The pizza was delicious even though it was a bit saucy and did not have much cheese.All my friends were also raving about the spumoni ice cream but I didn't get to try it. They have a nice seating outside area and are close to the beach. This will be a perfect spot to group a meal after the beach.,4.0
"The parking spots are always filled during the warmer months but people are usually in and out so it's not a long wait for a spot. I sat outside which had plenty of seating. I do love sitting outside on nicer days and having their air conditioned dine in as an option. I went inside and asked for a high chair and the generous waiter offered his assistance with carrying it outside to my table.I ordered a square (for me) & round (for my daughter.) When craving for a Sicilian, this place is hands down the best. I had what was leftover of my daughter's slice and it was mediocre. I can easily find a slice that taste better elsewhere. For dessert, I shared a watermelon icy with my daughter. I'm not a huge icy fan so I wasn't that impressed. When I dined in previously, I remember the ceasar salad was tasty and the potato croquettes were a hit.",4.0
"Holy crap, this is fine pizza.I've been craving good pizza for awhile.  When my friends said they were going to order from the best pizza place in town, I got excited and a little skeptical.  But alas, this was amazing!!  I can't wait to have another slice.There's something about it, but it doesn't taste like any pizza I've had before.  Yet I recognize it as pizza.  Sicilian is definitely the way to go - it's less greasy, more flavorful, and fills you up in the right way.  I felt satiated and happy after 3 pieces.Definitely try this place out - it's out of this world.  And just plain cheese.  I can't imaging what would happen if you added toppings to this awesome canvas!",5.0
"I was introduced to the cult of L&B Spumoni Gardens by a friend who was practically weaned on the homemade ice cream that gives this institution its name. There's no garden in evidence though, just an expanse of concrete with industrial picnic tables crowded with happy families. The complex includes two takeout stations: one for pizza and the other for spumoni, ices and other ice creams. There's also a sit down restaurant, with a selection of pastas and appetizers and main dishes. We split up, and I headed for the pizza window (made famous by a series of videos from the Jimmy Kimmel show that can be found on YouTube). The only choice is square Sicilian or slice of round. My friend rounded up two cups of Spumoni. The pizza was hot and fresh and tasty, but actually improved as leftovers reheated later. The spumoni is American style ice cream - not gelato - with chunks of pistachios laced through the vivid green, white and brown swirl. Better than the food is the people watching. Multi-generational family groups, lavishly tattooed couples, elderly men, and lots of children. Everyone united in their love for pizza and ice cream. No wonder L&B has been in business since 1938. It's a winning combination.",3.0
"More like 3.5 stars. I wenty here a few weeks ago with my family. It was decent.. perhaps it was slightly above decent, but only slightly. The pasta sauce felt like it could have had a less sharp taste to it. My uncle ordered a slice with pepperoni and it looked like a plain slice, reheated, with pepperoni thrown on top of it. The calamari was pretty tasteless. The food itself is pretty good, but can be improved. The ice cream is slightly better, bumping it up to almost 4 stars in my book.Definitely a place worth trying out for their Sicilian and ice cream, but not worth going to if you're expecting an amazing Italian dinner.",4.0
"Ordered two square slices and waited 10 minutes. Then came back to get our order, the guy said I'm sorry it would be another 10-15 minutes. So we waited and then we asked another person that was there because the previous guy was gone already. He told me that there is no square slices in the oven and he told us that we would have to wait another 10 minutes . That's a stupid half an hour that we almost waited for, never coming back here again and I won't refer my friends either.",1.0
Like Sicilian pizza slices? Well l&b has the best around. Pair that with some spumoni ice and you have the perfect meal. They also have an extensive menu inside if you want some true Italian grub.,5.0
"I feel very disappointed I don't have this kind of pizza in California.  Sure we have Sicilian pizza,  and it's pretty good,  but Spumoni has the best Sicilian pizza I have ever had.  The taste was incredible fresh,  it tasted like pizza is supposed to taste. I won't be eating Sicilian pizza anymore unless it's from here.  Until next time Spumoni Gardens!",5.0
"If you're looking for an authentic New York experience, it doesn't get any better than having pizza in Brooklyn... And this is the place to do it!

It will definitely leave you satisfied!",4.0
I don't know what the hype is about. 2.75 for a square or round slice. Cheese only. No topping available for the slice. All it is a ton of sauce on a slice and cheese. Nothing special.  Oh yeah the Spumoni wasn't anything great either.  Pistachio tasted fake.,2.0
Let me start off by saying I live right around the corner from this place. During the summer time it is packed with everyone and their mothers. Gets me frustrated coming home from work trying to look for a parking spot. But this review is for the Sicilian squares only which is what everyone should get when coming first time to this place. I don't really enjoy the Italian dining here but the Sicilians squares are amazing. It is meant to be eaten right away and tastes the best when it is fresh and hot out the oven. The sauce along with the salty crust is always what I enjoy the most out of this place. If you have room for dessert head on over and get a pistachio spumoni to top off a good night. This place is here to stay.,5.0
I love the sauce! I thought it was incredibly delicious. The way they layer the ingredients heightens the flavor. But if you're not into rich sauce or thick rising pizza this may not be the place for you. But if you those things this is the best! They have a number of other items but being here for the pizza tour we were here for one thing - pizza!,4.0
"L&B's is my go-to place every time I'm in Brooklyn. The square slice is the way to go! The pizza is usually piping hot since they're constantly making more trays of pizza one after another. The dough is thick but soft and there's just the right amount of sauce on top. Once you're done, walk a few feet over next door and get some spumoni or frozen treats. They have a wide variety of ice cream and soft serve you can choose from. While seating is very limited in the actual pizza shop, they have ample outdoor seating which is perfect for days with nice weather.You're stomach will leave happy and full!",5.0
"Probably my most favorite pizza. I always look forward to their sicilian pie. I also love their spamoni Italian ice. Parking is tough, but hey, it's Brooklyn.",5.0
"I'm not a native New Yorker. So I think that affects my preference for types of pizza. I personally prefer a nice thin crust with not too much sauce and cheese. I like pizza to not be too overwhelmingly heavy and with interesting topping combinations.Spumoni Gardens is not that kind of place. But even though the pizza here doesn't really match my particular preference, there's just no doubting that it's really great pizza. What you get is a typical grandma slice: thick, soft, cheesy, with just the right amount of crunch to make even me happy. The pizza tasted so fresh that even I couldn't really complain.Now let's talk about their spumoni ice cream. Let's just say you haven't really had spumoni until you've had it here. Again, not something I typically crave, but if and when I'm going to have spumoni I sure hope it's only from here. Not overwhelming, didn't taste artificial, and was just light enough that you wanted to keep eating more. Fantastic.I'm curious to come back and eat inside the restaurant. I wonder what else this place has up its sleeve...Overall, definitely recommend checking this place out. If this is your kind of pizza, you are going to be really upset that you didn't come here sooner.",4.0

"If you're in town, this place is a must. I didn't think the pizza was mind blowing but it's a classic so you have to go just to say that you went. I bought a Sicilian 1/2 tray and it was more than enough for two people. I had leftovers which was great because the pizza still tastes delicious when reheated in the oven. Location: I found that the place was in the middle of nowhere. I had to go out of my way just to go here but I decided to go for it because everyone said it was great and I wanted to judge for myself.Ices: I think I enjoyed the ices more than the pizza itself. It was a hot summer day so that might be the reason. I had the coconut and it was amaze-beans. Overall I think this was a one time thing for me but it was good food. The prices could be better though. I paid $20 for the 1/2 tray.",4.0

Thick crusted cheesy dough slices topped with sweet tomato sauce = PIZZAGASM (pizza orgasm). There is really no place like L&B.  The cheese is applied on the dough before the sauce. Think about it.

"If I reviewed them 20 years ago, it would get five stars, but the square pizza crust is just not what it used to be, has not been crispy on the bottom for the last few years. I thought it was because I was getting a half a pie, and they put it in the box and store it on top of the ovens, so it can get soggy, but I ordered slices the last few times I was there, and it was still not crispy. That is sad because the sauce and cheese is still outstanding. I am originally from the neighborhood and have been going there since birth, and I remember that it used to be crispy. My father remembers when they used to just sell spumoni from the cart on the street. The spumoni is still worth five stars, though. Please don't go there and get an icee. You must get spumoni.

I love nice soft and crusty pizza.  Spumoni's definitely delivered.  My family and I ordered a couple of sicilian slices because I thought my 3 yr old couldn't an entire one on her own.  Talk about being waaaayyy off mark.  My daughter ate the entire slice!  The sauce is perfect blend of savory and not bland.  We also had a rainbow spumoni ice cream...  if you're a fan of pistachio ice cream don't even bother with the rainbow.  The pistachio had a flavor unlike any pistachio ice cream I've had.  I definitely have to check this place out again before the summer ends.,4.0
"My husband made me try this place and I really didn't think I would like it based on the looks of the Sicilian pizza.  I usually like thin pizza with a lot of cheese so I didn't really get the appeal of it.  We got a couple slices of the Sicilian and then I got a slice of the standard round pizza as a backup in case my suspicions proved true.  But O.M.G the Sicilian pizza is GOOD!  The other pizza is good too, but not really what this place is known for, so just stick with the Sicilian.I really don't know what to say about it except try it.  I'm not really sure why it's so good but it just is.It was so good, we got half a sicilian pizza to go and carefully secured it for the trip back to SI.",5.0

"I understand the neighborhood fondness for the unusual square slice, I used to enjoy them as a kid, however, there's no good excuse for the glowing reviews on their pointless, unimaginative, tired, anything-but-authentic 'Italian' restaurant fare. It's not even a good imitation of decent Italian American food. When you're a 'red sauce' joint that continues to do business and your red sauce really sucks ( tasteless & bodiless), one might think you were living on a memory.After eating pretty easily the worst 'Italian food' I've probably had in years, I stepped outside to smoke a cigarette and as I considered getting one of those squares to chase the bad meal away, a guy delivering Chinese food came across the courtyard & asked me who ordered the food. I told him to bring it inside and I thought, at least the staff knows not to eat here. Hopefully you do too.PS, it's been years since I've had spumoni and even that hasn't aged well. Creamy rich turned into icy cheap. Couldn't even get lucky on dessert.Go anywhere else- you can't do much worse.",1.0

I love nice soft and crusty pizza.  Spumoni's definitely delivered.  My family and I ordered a couple of sicilian slices because I thought my 3 yr old couldn't an entire one on her own.  Talk about being waaaayyy off mark.  My daughter ate the entire slice!  The sauce is perfect blend of savory and not bland.  We also had a rainbow spumoni ice cream...  if you're a fan of pistachio ice cream don't even bother with the rainbow.  The pistachio had a flavor unlike any pistachio ice cream I've had.  I definitely have to check this place out again before the summer ends.,4.0
"My husband made me try this place and I really didn't think I would like it based on the looks of the Sicilian pizza.  I usually like thin pizza with a lot of cheese so I didn't really get the appeal of it.  We got a couple slices of the Sicilian and then I got a slice of the standard round pizza as a backup in case my suspicions proved true.  But O.M.G the Sicilian pizza is GOOD!  The other pizza is good too, but not really what this place is known for, so just stick with the Sicilian.I really don't know what to say about it except try it.  I'm not really sure why it's so good but it just is.It was so good, we got half a sicilian pizza to go and carefully secured it for the trip back to SI.",5.0

"I understand the neighborhood fondness for the unusual square slice, I used to enjoy them as a kid, however, there's no good excuse for the glowing reviews on their pointless, unimaginative, tired, anything-but-authentic 'Italian' restaurant fare. It's not even a good imitation of decent Italian American food. When you're a 'red sauce' joint that continues to do business and your red sauce really sucks ( tasteless & bodiless), one might think you were living on a memory.After eating pretty easily the worst 'Italian food' I've probably had in years, I stepped outside to smoke a cigarette and as I considered getting one of those squares to chase the bad meal away, a guy delivering Chinese food came across the courtyard & asked me who ordered the food. I told him to bring it inside and I thought, at least the staff knows not to eat here. Hopefully you do too.PS, it's been years since I've had spumoni and even that hasn't aged well. Creamy rich turned into icy cheap. Couldn't even get lucky on dessert.Go anywhere else- you can't do much worse.",1.0

"Holy thick square pie!  What did my hubbie and I get ourselves into!?  We came here on a rainy Saturday (boo! we could have sat outside if the weather was nicer) and ordered a 12 slice square pie and penne vodka.  Both portions were HUGE, the pie was probably the thickest I've seen a while.  Our waiter wished us luck as we started our pizza/pasta adventure...we got through about half of it! Pizza - pretty good, the crust was a little too thick for my liking.  The sauce and cheese were delicious.

"REALLY good pizza. Tried both the square slice and the cheese slice (triangle). The square slice barely has cheese on it but somehow tastes like its loaded with flavor. Its very doughy, like expected but has a great texture its sort if like a layer of sauce, a layer of chewy, then a layer of soft and bouncy. not sure if that makes sense but it tastes great! the cheese slice has a good amount of cheese on it and was pretty regular but the dough was flat and tasted better than a normal slice. The spumoni (ice cream ish) is DELICIOUS very creamy but also super light not sure why. overall great place lost a star cause it wasn't the best thing I ever ate but very good and worth the trip.

They seem heartless over this New Year's Holiday. So don't come here if you don't want to be treated this way.

Went in again for a sit down dinner.  Amazing.  Ordered the mussels in white sauce and sucked up all the broth with many slices of bread.  Half a carafe of house Red was super yummy.  Pear Salad was a mountain of delicious salad as tall as it was wide.  The slices were solid.  Definitely going back again.  The Spumoni was perfect and we took a pint home for later.,5.0

"So apparently the owners changed a while ago, but I hadn't been here since the change until today, and boy, was I disappointed.The boyfriend and I ordered half a tray (of squares) to go. They were still warm when we got home and I was really excited because I was starving. At first glance, the pizza looked a lot different than I remembered. There was a lot more Parmesan cheese sprinkled on top and some slices barely had any sauce. All the extra cheese made the pizza so unbearably salty. The crusts were also entirely burnt so I had to eat around it.We have so many slices left over.. Wish I would've known that the squares aren't what they used to be.. Wouldn't have gotten 12 slices! Or even one for that matter.Don't think I'll be coming back.. L&B.. You've broken my heart :'(",2.0
"OMG you can NOT live in NYC and NOT have been to L&B Spumoni Gardens. This place is a staple and worth the reputation it has. Its legendary.So this is how it works right? You take the train. I wanna say the Q, but I can't even remember at this moment in time so just look it up. Thats why google maps were invented folks. It is a bit of a walk to get there but its worth every step. It gets crowded during the summer so be patient. The great thing about this place is there are like three parts to the experience. There's the outdoor pizza ordering. You get a sicilian slice. You DONT GET ANY OTHER SLICE! ITS WHERE THE LEGEND COMES FROM. Sure, cheese on first, sauce on after. Its been done elsewhere. Yeah I get it but don't dismiss it. The sauce is amazing! Its almost sweet and the crust is so crispy. Everything is at such an amazing balance. The next stop is the window right next to that one where you get your spumoni. Ive gotten spumoni ice cream before. Does not do it justice. Have it here. If you don't like nuts, ok then don't get this but if you love it, get it. The flavors are perfect and such a refreshing end to your meal.The third stop is next to THAT window its just a step indoors where you can order heroes, sandwiches, you name it. The cool hero is any with broccoli rabe. Thats not it though.... it of course has an indoor restaurant and its AMAZEBALLS!! Look its Brooklyn. Of course there is amazing Italian food all over it. L & B gives everyone a run for their money. Normally when I see lasagne on a menu, I shrug and go ""Meh"" I'll pass. My friend's aunt ordered it. Get it. Just.. just get it! Its amazing. The food is to die for! Everything everyone ordered at the table was yummy goodness and nothing was left behind. No doggie bags and there was a lot of food AAAND if you still want a slice of sicilian while you wait for your meal, you can totally order it. Nom nom.The outdoor portion is loaded with picnic tables, people double park just so they can run to the windows, order, and run. Its awesome. I highly suggest you try this place out at least once in your lifetime.",5.0
Great pizza for those that love lots of sauce on their pizza...crust is also delish!! The atmosphere is great too!

"The Sicilian squares are great...yes they are!!! but i got one more news for you, buddy. Chef's table!! So much food...Good. Nay. Great. Food.

It didn't make any sense to me whatsoever if they were open or not.I don't think this is how they acted with me when I was younger. Who knows if their food has changed too. They seem heartless over this New Year's Holiday. So don't come here if you don't want to be treated this way. They don't even put signs up, like every other business if they are closing early for this holiday evening! Don't even bother calling them about their holiday hours if this is how they areFrank's Pizza on Flatbush Ave and Ave P in Brooklyn is much better on these terms. Almost any pizzeria at this point is much better than they are!",1.0
Went in again for a sit down dinner.  Amazing.  Ordered the mussels in white sauce and sucked up all the broth with many slices of bread.  Half a carafe of house Red was super yummy.  Pear Salad was a mountain of delicious salad as tall as it was wide.  The slices were solid.  Definitely going back again.  The Spumoni was perfect and we took a pint home for later.,5.0
its classic. its NY pizza. its a landmark. rainbow spumoni is the cherry on top.,4.0
Great pizza.  I have had squares and a regular pie both really good. Can't comment on much more since when I have had it (twice) it was take in. But its good stuff.,4.0
"So apparently the owners changed a while ago, but I hadn't been here since the change until today, and boy, was I disappointed.The boyfriend and I ordered half a tray (of squares) to go. They were still warm when we got home and I was really excited because I was starving. At first glance, the pizza looked a lot different than I remembered. There was a lot more Parmesan cheese sprinkled on top and some slices barely had any sauce. All the extra cheese made the pizza so unbearably salty. The crusts were also entirely burnt so I had to eat around it.We have so many slices left over.. Wish I would've known that the squares aren't what they used to be.. Wouldn't have gotten 12 slices! Or even one for that matter.Don't think I'll be coming back.. L&B.. You've broken my heart :'(",2.0
"OMG you can NOT live in NYC and NOT have been to L&B Spumoni Gardens. This place is a staple and worth the reputation it has. Its legendary.So this is how it works right? You take the train. I wanna say the Q, but I can't even remember at this moment in time so just look it up. Thats why google maps were invented folks. It is a bit of a walk to get there but its worth every step. It gets crowded during the summer so be patient. The great thing about this place is there are like three parts to the experience. There's the outdoor pizza ordering. You get a sicilian slice. You DONT GET ANY OTHER SLICE! ITS WHERE THE LEGEND COMES FROM. Sure, cheese on first, sauce on after. Its been done elsewhere. Yeah I get it but don't dismiss it. The sauce is amazing! Its almost sweet and the crust is so crispy. Everything is at such an amazing balance. The next stop is the window right next to that one where you get your spumoni. Ive gotten spumoni ice cream before. Does not do it justice. Have it here. If you don't like nuts, ok then don't get this but if you love it, get it. The flavors are perfect and such a refreshing end to your meal.The third stop is next to THAT window its just a step indoors where you can order heroes, sandwiches, you name it. The cool hero is any with broccoli rabe. Thats not it though.... it of course has an indoor restaurant and its AMAZEBALLS!! Look its Brooklyn. Of course there is amazing Italian food all over it. L & B gives everyone a run for their money. Normally when I see lasagne on a menu, I shrug and go ""Meh"" I'll pass. My friend's aunt ordered it. Get it. Just.. just get it! Its amazing. The food is to die for! Everything everyone ordered at the table was yummy goodness and nothing was left behind. No doggie bags and there was a lot of food AAAND if you still want a slice of sicilian while you wait for your meal, you can totally order it. Nom nom.The outdoor portion is loaded with picnic tables, people double park just so they can run to the windows, order, and run. Its awesome. I highly suggest you try this place out at least once in your lifetime.",5.0
Great pizza for those that love lots of sauce on their pizza...crust is also delish!! The atmosphere is great too! Try the spumoni or take it to go as its a great treat after having a big square slice of pizza :). I am able to find very close street parking and be in a quick waiting line especially if I go 30 min before or after the typical lunch/dinner times.,4.0
"The Sicilian squares are great...yes they are!!! but i got one more news for you, buddy. Chef's table!! So much food...Good. Nay. Great. Food. So I was a weak sauce and couldn't get past the pasta dish. Appetizers were sooooo nice I devoured them thinking like nothing else is coming. I believe there's supposed to be steak after the pasta dish but I got myself so full I couldn't get anything else in after the pasta lol. I will come back for this again though. Totally worth what we paid for. A must try for every foodie.",5.0

"I've been a long time fan of this neighborhood haunt but last evening was a disaster!!!!  The service was subpar with the waiters throwing straws for drinks on the table as they walked by and putting the dinner plates anywhere without clearing the used dishes. When the food arrived in a disorganized order, my Shrimp cocktail was loosely thrown on a plate of lettuce with a huge blob of cocktail sauce.  The shrimp must have been from freezer section from a local supermarket and very over cooked. My main course (an old staple of this place) chicken parm with rigatoni, the chicken was good but the mozzarella wasn't melted properly and the sauce was splattered on- very messing.   This wasn't the end my dining experience at L&B, the bus boys used the bread knife to cut a plastic garbage bag open and without wiping it they began to cut the table bread.  Also they dropped the butter packets on the floor scooped them off the floor and onto someone's tables while they were not looking.  That was totally gross!!! There was also another issue with the butter served on my table, it was so melted!  It must have been out of the fridge for hours.   I can't begin to say how disappointed I was with my experience which is normally an above average meal.  Hope they go back the old L&B...  Deeply disappointed.",2.0

"I had very high expectations for this place because theyve been open for seventy years and seem to be very popular. for the most part, they delivered. I got the garlic bread as an appetizer and though im not typically a bread person, im glad i ordered it. it was perfectly cooked and the garlic was applied very generously. There were even charred chunks of garlic on top which provided a nice effect. My main course was the red clam sauce and spaghetti. The sauce disappointed me a bit because it wasnt as flavorful as i was expecting (had to add a bunch of red pepper to get it to taste close to how i wanted it). However, the clams were amazing-plump and extremely fresh tasting. My boyfriend got the seafood fra diavolo which should be a spicy sauce but the flavor seemed lacking in his sauce as well and it seemed a bit thin. He also agreed that the seafood itself was very good though so the theme here seems to be understated sauces and great seafood.

"Oh snap! Which establishment is going to get my 300th review? L&B Spumoni Gardens of course. ""Why?"", You ask? WHAT DID I TELL YOU ABOUT QUESTIONING MY DECISIONS?Well if you must know it's because these special centennial reviews I've been doing have common themes. Great Brooklyn establishments with a rich history, that I've experienced with my family growing up. It's the summer time now and what better place to go than L&B? I can think of at least 50 places I'd rather be, but that's not the point. This is a place you'd be very happy to be at on a nice summer's day. There is plenty of parking a block or two away but what fun is that? Don't you want to double park in front like everyone else and their mother is does. No joke, I came with my friend and his mother showed up double parking her car. Uncool Ms. Liverwursen, I'll let it slide. She does make mean PB&Js, so I can't hate. Or maybe you'd like to check the full parking lot, where some guy is taking up two spots. Some woman didn't even bother attempting to park and just left it in the middle of the lot essentially blocking three cars from leaving. When you try to U turn out of the lot some guy will be coming in and that guy coming in will yell at you for being in the way of his destination, which is no where because there is NO PARKING! But the real treat is what I would experience here on late night weekends as a teenager. Woah, souped up cars doing doughnuts in the middle of 86th street  getting chased by cops. Is that Vin Diesel and Paul Walker? No wait. It's just some stereotypical goon talking with his hands and being too aggressive as the police start to arrest him, while his friend sitting shotgun is crying.  Oh Brooklynites, you make me proud.  Once you decide it was better to park elsewhere you start to experience the real magic, people watching! Parenting 101 is in session and you see some winners up in here. That's right Gina you shouldn't hit your ::EXPLETIVE:: brother. You tell her, random mom. Oh random dad if you won't pay attention to your crying and screaming baby, who will? THE WHOLE PLACE WILL, that's who! Put some spumoni in that kid's mouth already! Getting a whole pie for the family dad? Oh, your giving one slice to each of your kids while you eat the rest for yourself. Who's dad does that? Oh wait it was mine. (On a sweet sentimental note. This is  where I bought my dad lunch for the first time once I got a job out of college)All types of people coming here. People from far away lands come here, like New Jersey, Long Island and Westchester. Old Asian people come here just to sit down, they're here for people watching too apparently.  Russian men having a conversation which sounds like they're about to fight each other but are actually complimenting each others family. Adolescence with so much hope and promise, illustrating how they are influenced by their great heroes...... hip hop artists and basketball stars. Elderly people who only get ONE SLICE, because they'll die before they have a second.Now lets talk about the pizza. If you order a regular slice, you're gonna get a look of death. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? I don't care if you don't like Sicilian slices. You get that Sicilian slice! That's why this places does the business it does. You can get that regular slice anywhere but no one makes a Sicilian like L&B. I'm not saying it's the best, but it's unique and can not be replicated (Sorry bootleg Barclay's center knockoff.) Why is this Sicilian bad boy (No, not Tony D from Bensonhurst) so delicious? The dough is so good, super soft. The cheese is right on top of the dough and then they put the sauce on. Oh I'm in heaven just thinking about those slices. I get a minimum of four every time. You can't just leave yet, you must get the spumoni. You MUST, or I will find you. I'd say go with pistachio. Vanilla is pretty good too. Don't get chocolate and I love chocolate.  Place could get super packed at times. If you need to use the rest room there's one around in the back. You might find a nice young man asking you if you want to purchase some things he has for sale. You just let him know you're high off eating some of the best damn pizza this world has......... and if you want I guess you can see what he's offering. L&B Spumoni Gardens........ Come for the pizza. Stay because your car is trapped in the parking lot.",5.0

"Un. Real. Best sicilian slice ive ever had (Pinocchio's in harvard sq is now second best).

I can never decide if a side piece with extra crust or a middle piece drenched in sauces is best.. so i just eat multiples of both! Obviously only been here for the pizza. Have been here just for take out slices to eat in, and with a group of 36. Take out- always hot and fresh Sicilian slices to take out immediately. 2.50/slice. CASH ONLY. Don't think they have an atm on premises. You can ask for middle and side pieces. Spumoni- delicious! has nuts so beware. With group-set menu: Salad was really fresh and tasty. Had Sicilian and  regular cheese pizza. Obviously Sicilian is waaaaaay better. i hate cheese pizza (where's the meat??) but better than most places and regular pizza crust is good. I love it when the cheese strings and the regular definitely did that. They have gluten free pasta options for those of you that can't partake in the pizza to cry into. Definitely worth the trek. and once you're done eating in, grab a box to go! Baking sheet, 450 oven for 5 minutes to reheat and it's just as good as fresh. *Barclays version is not nearly as good as getting it from the original. We still get it every time though.

"I was kind of worried that I hate kids for a while.  This is probably symptomatic of the fact that I live in a neighbourhood where people feel it appropriate to bring their children to cocktail bars and beer halls and deny them a childhood by forcing them to read the complete works of Dostoyevsky by age 7.  It's summer, do your kids a favour, bring them to L&B and get them a square and a pistachio spumoni instead of making them watch you get housed on martinis.  Also, your kid can walk now, so no need to push junior around in that SUV stroller, let them run around a bit.  Needless to say, the square slices are the only thing you should order here.  Also acceptable, rainbow spumoni, though you may as well order pistachio as it's the best flavour.  If you're worried about eating a wad of ice cream in public as an adult male, just take notes from the 10 FDNY guys to your right standing around in a huddle devouring it straight from the paper cup - no spoon required.  It's important to get at least one side or corner when ordering your squares - the char around the edges is fantastic.  I was equally impressed by and annoyed with the cargo shorts wearing man in front of me; 'Lemme get four cornahs and two diet Pepsi'.  The sauce is sweet, but also has a tang to it - the cheese is thin and melted underneath.Bring your kids here.  Bring your parents here.  Bring your friends here.  This is a wholesome (and fat) way to spend a Saturday afternoon.",5.0
the best sicilian pizza ever ever ever!!! lol . i dont like sicilian pizza but once i tried this place it has become my all time favorite for sicilian pizzas.  amazing and it is worth it! cool place to go to in the summer with friends to go out and eat and hang out.,5.0
"The best pizza in all of NY hands down! Their pizza is so addictive - they probably put crack in it. Lol. I always have the Sicilian slices (a half a pie on my own), and follow it up with a Spumoni ice. I've never had their round pizza. They have outside seating, some times it is hard to get a seat in the summer because there are too many people. But if you go in the spring and fall you can get easy seating outside.",5.0

"I love pizza and L&B is still one of my favorite places for pizza. I always order a a 12 slice sicilian pie to bring home and by the time I'm home, it's still piping hot and delicious. L&B slices are different from other pizzerias because I don't know how they get their bread so freakin fluffy and soft, BUT STILL CRUNCHY. If I don't make sense, it's cause I can't really justify them in words. Some may consider the softness weird and uncooked, but it tastes perfectly fine to me.A pie costs around ~20 and really fills you up. 2 slices does it for me, but sometimes I cut a third slice in half cause I can't help myself. L&B has outdoor benches, which aren't the cleanest, but eh, you're already eating pizza. You'll probably drop sauce on yourself anyway. They have spumoni ices, which are super refreshing in the summer, and also entrees (like pastas and appetizers). My friend tells me their portions are huge and they are tasty. I will have to try them sometime myself.AMAZING PEESA!",5.0

"It looked so good on Man vs. Food that I had to try it. I took the N train to 86th Street. I stepped out to see a neighborhood not unlike the one I taught in for two years in the South Bronx. Across the street from the subway is a huge sprawling housing project. On the walk to L&B you pass a C Town grocery store and a check cashing place. As I look at a map now, I can see that perhaps I would have missed this if I had gotten off one stop before at Avenue U. Next to the housing project is a luxury condominium building and across from that is L&B.I ordered a slice of Sicilian. $2.25, a decent price for a big slice. They have a whole pie at the outside counter and you can ask for a middle, corner or edge. I liked that. I went middle. My first bite or two it was too hot. You have to wait a minute to cool off just enough that you're not just tasting hot.Then the party started. This pizza is an example of the magic that happens when food is exactly the right texture. Let's build up from the bottom. The bottom crust is perfectly crisp. The bread above that is a perfect soft and not too chewy texture. Its almost airy in there. On Sicilian that can be topped with sogginess from sauce. Not so here. The bread is topped off with the melted mozzarella. It is the perfect top. It is almost like an open-face grilled cheese sandwich made with pizza dough and mozzarella. Then topped with a great red sauce. The highlight of the sauce is the parmesan and/or romano sprinkled on top. Its aroma and taste combine to form the nicotine of this cigarette. I went back and ordered a second slice. I'd be lying if I didn't admit I considered ordering a third. But I had to save some room for the next treat, pistachio spumoni.I ordered a small cone of it, again setting me back $2.25. There is plenty on a small cone. The color is a very bright and artificial green. No matter, whatever chemical causes this green, its not detracting from taste. Again, the texture is a major success. Not creamy and melty but not ice either. Didn't drip. Also, the spumoni has bits of pistachio pleasantly sprinkled in. The taste is fantastic. Wonderfully pistachio. What would win a pistachio triple-threat match, L&B spumoni, Shriver's in Ocean City's pistachio fudge or Bobby's Burger Palace's pistachio milkshake? I don't know. So I paid $6.75 for two slices of great pizza and a delicious spumoni. They only have cans of soda there so I just used my water bottle. This place is a find. Thank you so much Adam Richman!",5.0

"First timer...in my 30-something years living on this Earth, aka Brooklyn, I have never been to this establishment. So, without further adieu, here are my thoughts:1. First impression given while calling this place before the intended time to arrive is not good. I called their direct number---wanting to arrive at 7pm for a party of four people; there is an automated message that prompts you to choose from dining area, ice cream or pizza. After about three times of calling and getting a, ""This party is not available"" message I got fed up and called the regular pizza area, at which point, the phone was picked up promptly, but the gentleman answering the phone was quite strange (upon asking is this ""Spimonte"", I got a few feed backs of, ""Who?""). I then was transferred to the dining area and while waiting for awhile, I was then asked if I wanted to make a reservation for the chef's table, which was to be $50-70 p/p. Seemed a little pricey to me at first, but we made our 7pm reservation regardless; considering it was our first time there, no chances were to be taken. We made the reservation and showed up promptly. So---minus one star for the weird turn out of events on the phone line. 2. Upon siting down, we noticed that our table was not clean at all, with weird spills on the floor and some random plastic bag full of garbage stuffed under the table. They eventually cleaned it to our satisfaction (we were also offered to sit at another table that had recently been opened up: nice), but we chose to keep our seats. It was incredibly busy and packed. We sat down and the bus boy brought our white bread right away. We hoped to get a waiter to talk to us, but to no avail, we received no one. No one came to us to give a menu nor did anyone give us any iced water and after awhile, we were absolutely parched and dying of thirst. We finally had a waiter (later, found out his name is Benny) and he finally explained to us what this Chef's table is. It basically means your table will get a bunch of appetizers, one big pasta plate to share between all, one big plate of meat/fish/steak as a main course to share, a few sides to go along with the main course, essentially unlimited drinks (including alcohol as beer/wine) and one large desert. So we were down to see what this was about...3. For our appetizers, we got a shrimpCocktail with bread-crusted and regular shrimp with few sauces. The bread-crusted shrimp was amazing and the regular shrimp was uneventful. Then we got the fried mozzarella and it was definitely a crowd pleaser, my mom included who doesn't eat anything with tomato sauce. Then it was time for the artichoke. Nothing especially remarkable, but worth mentioning. Then, the large salad was delivered: a little dry for my taste, but some other people at the table were very well pleased. Lastly, we received the baked clams, and those were yummy. Yum yum. During this time, the waiter was in reach for unlimited carafe of wine refills and bus boys asking if we are doing okay (nice touch). We waited a pretty long time for the next batch as we ordered the linguine with clam sauce. A little questionable for my taste, but other people were glued to this pasta (I must say the cooking was done al dente and I loved that texture). We kept the pasta on the table while our main arrived. (We were approached by what looked like the manager, and since there was a huge party of about 20 people next to us, they were kind enough to explain that we could move to the same table behind ours in order to give the bigger party more space to spread out. We didn't mind and moved promptly: even thanked by them. We also asked about this infamous Sicilian slice and the manager was able to bring us a few slices, cut into small pieces, as a thank you for choosing to move). 4. The main course was agreed among the four of us to be a mix of chef's fish over mashed potatoes with shiitake mushrooms and chopped asparagus. We received another two plates of sides: more mashed potatoes and bright green brocoli rabe hearts. The hearts were a bit tough for my taste; my mother absolutely loved them. Mashed potatoes were okay. 5. We were stuffed even before the linguine came out, but were still eager for the next finale. We received a large desert taster: one piece of cheesecake, one of chocolate fudge cake, tartufo cut up into quarters and a large portion of the infamous spumonte. Not bad...definitely filling. I had a cup of cappuccino and I was happy as a clam. They did not have any tea left to us to choose from, which I found strange why aRestaurant would run out of tea on a warm Friday night. Oh well...still other choices were provided and everyone in my party was happy. So, all in all, this is a review not pizza (although Sicilian: good), but for the dining room. We had a great time---family style. Five stars for the food and one removed for the lack of proper functioning phone line that connects to the hostess when calling to make reservations.",4.0

"A Sicilian pie that isn't all dough. Just the right thickness and the sauce is great, too. I could have eaten that half-sheet pie all by myself. Next time we get two.",4.0
"First timer...in my 30-something years living on this Earth, aka Brooklyn, I have never been to this establishment. So, without further adieu, here are my thoughts:1. First impression given while calling this place before the intended time to arrive is not good. I called their direct number---wanting to arrive at 7pm for a party of four people; there is an automated message that prompts you to choose from dining area, ice cream or pizza. After about three times of calling and getting a, ""This party is not available"" message I got fed up and called the regular pizza area, at which point, the phone was picked up promptly, but the gentleman answering the phone was quite strange (upon asking is this ""Spimonte"", I got a few feed backs of, ""Who?""). I then was transferred to the dining area and while waiting for awhile, I was then asked if I wanted to make a reservation for the chef's table, which was to be $50-70 p/p. Seemed a little pricey to me at first, but we made our 7pm reservation regardless; considering it was our first time there, no chances were to be taken. We made the reservation and showed up promptly. So---minus one star for the weird turn out of events on the phone line. 2. Upon siting down, we noticed that our table was not clean at all, with weird spills on the floor and some random plastic bag full of garbage stuffed under the table. They eventually cleaned it to our satisfaction (we were also offered to sit at another table that had recently been opened up: nice), but we chose to keep our seats. It was incredibly busy and packed. We sat down and the bus boy brought our white bread right away. We hoped to get a waiter to talk to us, but to no avail, we received no one. No one came to us to give a menu nor did anyone give us any iced water and after awhile, we were absolutely parched and dying of thirst. We finally had a waiter (later, found out his name is Benny) and he finally explained to us what this Chef's table is. It basically means your table will get a bunch of appetizers, one big pasta plate to share between all, one big plate of meat/fish/steak as a main course to share, a few sides to go along with the main course, essentially unlimited drinks (including alcohol as beer/wine) and one large desert. So we were down to see what this was about...3. For our appetizers, we got a shrimpCocktail with bread-crusted and regular shrimp with few sauces. The bread-crusted shrimp was amazing and the regular shrimp was uneventful. Then we got the fried mozzarella and it was definitely a crowd pleaser, my mom included who doesn't eat anything with tomato sauce. Then it was time for the artichoke. Nothing especially remarkable, but worth mentioning. Then, the large salad was delivered: a little dry for my taste, but some other people at the table were very well pleased. Lastly, we received the baked clams, and those were yummy. Yum yum. During this time, the waiter was in reach for unlimited carafe of wine refills and bus boys asking if we are doing okay (nice touch). We waited a pretty long time for the next batch as we ordered the linguine with clam sauce. A little questionable for my taste, but other people were glued to this pasta (I must say the cooking was done al dente and I loved that texture). We kept the pasta on the table while our main arrived. (We were approached by what looked like the manager, and since there was a huge party of about 20 people next to us, they were kind enough to explain that we could move to the same table behind ours in order to give the bigger party more space to spread out. We didn't mind and moved promptly: even thanked by them. We also asked about this infamous Sicilian slice and the manager was able to bring us a few slices, cut into small pieces, as a thank you for choosing to move). 4. The main course was agreed among the four of us to be a mix of chef's fish over mashed potatoes with shiitake mushrooms and chopped asparagus. We received another two plates of sides: more mashed potatoes and bright green brocoli rabe hearts. The hearts were a bit tough for my taste; my mother absolutely loved them. Mashed potatoes were okay. 5. We were stuffed even before the linguine came out, but were still eager for the next finale. We received a large desert taster: one piece of cheesecake, one of chocolate fudge cake, tartufo cut up into quarters and a large portion of the infamous spumonte. Not bad...definitely filling. I had a cup of cappuccino and I was happy as a clam. They did not have any tea left to us to choose from, which I found strange why aRestaurant would run out of tea on a warm Friday night. Oh well...still other choices were provided and everyone in my party was happy. So, all in all, this is a review not pizza (although Sicilian: good), but for the dining room. We had a great time---family style. Five stars for the food and one removed for the lack of proper functioning phone line that connects to the hostess when calling to make reservations.",4.0

"Somehow I see these guys popping up on a bunch of top 10 pizzas in New York lists, so on a recent bike ride out to Jacob Riis I figured I would stop by to see what the fuss is all about. There was a smallish line at 6pm on a Sunday, hopefully a good sign that the pizza is worth waiting for. Some locals got into a bit of an argument with the counter guy about something or other, and when I got up there to order, he was throwing me a bit of attitude as well. Whatever, maybe the pizza's fantastic. God knows those assholes at Patsy's on 118th could use a manners lesson, but the pizza up there is so perfect, I never really care. Anyways, back to Spumoni Gardens. I have no problem with Sicilian style pie. I often order Grandma slices for a change of pace, I like the crispy fried bottom and substantial thickness. I've had better square slices pretty much everywhere I've ordered them in the city. The Spumoni Gardens sicilian slice somehow has zero air bubbles in the crust, and no stretch or tooth to the dough. Which means that since it's about an inch thick, you end up with a huge, uniformly dense crust, with that cheap white bread texture. You know how on a nice loaf of rustic italian bread, when you slice it or bite into it, the remaining bread springs back into shape? And you know how when you pick up or bite a slice of wonder bread, it compresses anywhere you applied pressure and doesn't spring back? That's what this stuff is like - it has no tooth. Combine that with the fact that it's necessarily doughy, because of the thickness, and the complete lack of any kind of fried texture on the bottom of the dough, and you have basically a wonder bread crust with crispy outsides. There are about 2mm of cheese and tomato sauce on top of that - personally I like to have my cheese bubbling a little bit so the fact that it's underneath the tomato sauce kind of prevents that from happening, but whatever. If the crust was edible it'd be forgivable. The comparison to grade-school lunch pizza is accurate, that's what it most closely resembles. I don't know, if you grew up eating cheap processed bread products maybe this will be sentimental for you. Otherwise go somewhere they invest a little money in some decent flour.Oh - the spumoni was pretty good!",1.0

"This has been my favorite Sicilian style pizza since my childhood and I love it the same every time I return. Their pizza has been featured on Man v. Food and is really just excellent. Their square is thick, crunchy on the bottom, mushy on top and they put the sauce over the mozzarella and then sprinkle with parmesan. The sauce is hearty and sweet, just the way I like it. It is great (and packed) in the summer because they have a huge outdoor seating area. It is pretty hard to park around here (you will notice the double parked cars, motorcycles and usually at least one cop car-because the cops around here know where it's at-and it's not the Dunkin Donuts down the block). It is still decently priced and retains its neighborhood feel, even though people from all over Brooklyn come here. And the slice? Please don't come here if you are ordering a round/Neapolitan slice. There are plenty of places to go for that. If you want a hefty, filling saucy square then you need look no further. The hardest part is always saving room for spumoni and ices. L&B is also known for it's spumoni so make sure to try. The traditional spumoni is 'rainbow' but not the red, white and blue kind. This is creamy gelato, pistachio and chocolate.

"Thick crust Sicilian pie is their trademark along with their ices. We came for early dinner and good thing too cuz it packed up quickly shortl thereafter. Tried broccoli rabbe which was delicious.

Also tried pepperoni pizza which was interesting. We got the half pie which was thick crust with 2 pepperonis on each slice. Very little cheese, .mostly sauce and bread. It is lighter bread but still thick crust so u gotta be up for that. Also tried salad, and plain slices too. Dessert tried the spumoni which was a nice portion and ice cream sundae. All tasty.

"I had heard about this place for years; it was only 1.5 miles from where my grandparents had lived and where my Dad grew up. Yet in all my 31 years, I had never been to the Spumoni Gardens before. The girl and i ordered a half pie, which is 12 square-shaped slices for $19.00. Since she is the veteran of this place, she placed the order while I took a table outside. My rear end end had barely hit the seat when she came back holding a white square shaped cardboard box. It was out in maybe three minutes at the most. I guess they prepare them in advance because the demand is so high! This was just amazing pizza. The crust was thick and crunchy, the ruby red sauce tasted homemade. The mozzarella is layered under the sauce and there was just enough cheese to bring the whole slice together; it wasn't overpowering at all. For my own taste, I added a little extra oregano and parmesan cheese. Nothing else is needed, no sausage, no pepperoni, no veggies. It tastes perfect just the way it is.

"I came back to L&B after a good two years with Gabby S. This place is somewhat close to my house but for some reason I never really come here. It's a good thing I don't though or else I'd be the size of a whale from eating their delicious italian food. The two of us ordered calamari, linguine carbonara, a slice of their famous sicilian pie and two desserts (tiramisu and spumoni). The food was definitely on point. In my last review I stated that the carbonara was delicious and a must try. I ate it again today and this time still doesn't fail to disappoint me. The sauce was so creamy. The calamari appetizer I ordered was made just right. The squid was definitely cooked to perfection. Not too overcooked. It needed a bit more salt/pepper but it's nothing the salt and pepper shaker couldn't revive. The marinara dipping sauce that came with the dish was somewhat bland so I squeezed a little lemon juice in there and the taste came out a lot better. The sicilian slice is everything people rave about. I honestly really like my thick crust pizzas to be a bit ""moist"", that way it can soak up all the tomato sauce. L&B's made it just that. The tiramisu wasn't anything to rave about, I've definitely had better at other Italian establishments but man the Spumoni they had was off the hook! Next time I hit up L&B, I'm definitely bringing home a pint or two. Our waiter was really inattentive. Our bus boy was a lot better. My friend asked our waiter for some water and he didn't fill it up. When she waited and saw that he wasn't going to refill our water, we gave up and asked the bus boy to do it.

The bus boy was really nice cause he replaced the spumoni I ate at the restaurant with fresh spumoni when I said I wanted to take it to go. I wasn't expecting such a nice gesture. He was kinda funny and enthusiastic too. Overall, a good family style restaurant with a no fuss Brooklyn attitude, just the way I like it.",4.0
This place is as good as it gets for pizza. Went here with a couple of friends and the environment outside is comforting.

The bus boy was really nice cause he replaced the spumoni I ate at the restaurant with fresh spumoni when I said I wanted to take it to go. I wasn't expecting such a nice gesture. He was kinda funny and enthusiastic too. Overall, a good family style restaurant with a no fuss Brooklyn attitude, just the way I like it.",4.0
This place is as good as it gets for pizza. Went here with a couple of friends and the environment outside is comforting. The square slices have definitley held their name for being the best slice in Brooklyn. After having the pizza we shared a nice pint of spumoni which topped it off. Everything was so enjoyable that i cannot wait to go back again.,5.0
i had the square red slice it was okay. Brothers pizza in Staten island still better to me.Only thing better about L&B is the seating,3.0
i haven't eaten in the actual indoor restaurant in ages but GOD i love this pizza. And the ices are fantastic. I also love the outdoor seating. I'm from Brooklyn but I live in the city now so I really miss it!,5.0
"L&B is legit the go to place. Whenever I'm hungry or craving something good, L&B is the place to go. Usually I go with my friends after school to pick up a slice or two, depending how hungry I am, it fills me up. Their sicilian slices are to die for. They are delicious. Words can't describe how delicious it is. After pizza, it's usually their spumonis. Their spumonis are delicious as well. I definitely recommend to come here.",5.0

"My cousin brought me here as one of her favorite places and I left a fan as well.  This is the perfect place for a summer afternoon. The outdoor seating area is huge, with tones of picnic tables both under and outside the overhang.  If you want a quick service go with the half pie.  Ready to go all you need to is grab a few drinks, paper plates, and napkins and go to town.  Definitely go for the center pieces.  I started with an outside piece, and was a little unsatisfied at first, but as soon as I moved onto my 2nd (and last) piece (an inside one), I could totally see what my cousin was talking about.  Great doughy crust with a nice layer of sauce and cheese - all you really need for a good slice of pizza.  The leftovers were just as good as the first go around - a key component in a good pizza place.  This is not the place to go for gourmet pizza, service, or decor, but for a summer chill afternoon, it's pretty perfect. They also carry Spumoni, which makes this the full italian experience",4.0
The round pie is delicious! I gobbled up my slice in about 5 seconds.  Square pie is good but i personally just like less crust.  But there may be some truth to there being crack in the sauce... there is something very addictive about it!  The only problem is after the pizza which ice cream to decide on... spumoni or creamsicle soft serve!!!,4.0
"I first saw Spumoni Gardens on Man vs. Food and I instantly wanted to make a pilgrimage to Gravesend. My opportunity came on an early Sunday evening last Spring. We made the trek out there on the D-train, and it took about an hour from Manhattan. Boy was it worth the special trip.There was a little bit of a wait, maybe 15 minutes or so, but we were soon seated. Spumoni Gardens has a small takeout area in the front, outdoor benches, and then an actual restaurant. It is the type of Italian restaurant I used to frequent when I was growing up in New Jersey. Old school, red sauce, big portions. They serve assorted pastas, typical dishes like chicken parm, and of course the famous pizza. We went there specifically for the Sicilian style pizza that was featured on Man vs. Food, so the two of us ordered a salad and 12-slice square pie to split.The pizza came out and it was truly fantastic. The bottom of the pie was crisp, and the inner crust was thick and doughy. The mozzarella was placed directly onto the dough, and was sliced, not shredded. It was topped with huge ladles of delicious sweet marinara sauce, and then some grated parmesan. We ended up having a few slices leftover to bring home with us. Overall, it was amazing and very special pizza. I just wish I had a magical transporter that could spare me the long subway ride.",5.0

It's Lou Malnati's with 1/2 of the crust thickness (cue outraged NY'ers who would rather walk over hot coals than desecrate their palates eating deep dish).

"OK, I'll admit, I'm a total pizza critic.  I like my pizza in the 98 percentile range.   To most people, they might very well love this pizza and maybe the quality has dipped as others here have indicated.  But I must say, I was disappointed.   Perhaps it was the anticipation of hearing about it for years and  I mistakenly built it up to something it couldn't achieve, but I can't say that this is exceptionally good pizza.  In fact, I found the soft Sicilian slices to to be rather void of any crunch that a typical pan pizza would/could/should have.   The sauce, cheese combo is good, but when put together, overall, I unfortunately wasn't impressed.   Maybe you'll feel otherwise.   Two star rating overall and one additional star for the mere fact that the place is an old school shrine which totally love.  If there is another visit I'll try a sandwich since the round pizza even looked below average.  I find it hard to believe that this is the best that Brooklyn's got to offer.",3.0

My girlfriend and I, always argue over which is the best flavor. I went to the restaurant part one time, and got the chef's table, a four-course family style meal. Each course was delicious, and I would definitely come back for a full dinner in the future.",5.0
"OK, I'll admit, I'm a total pizza critic.  I like my pizza in the 98 percentile range.   To most people, they might very well love this pizza and maybe the quality has dipped as others here have indicated.  But I must say, I was disappointed.   Perhaps it was the anticipation of hearing about it for years and  I mistakenly built it up to something it couldn't achieve, but I can't say that this is exceptionally good pizza.  In fact, I found the soft Sicilian slices to to be rather void of any crunch that a typical pan pizza would/could/should have.   The sauce, cheese combo is good, but when put together, overall, I unfortunately wasn't impressed.   Maybe you'll feel otherwise.   Two star rating overall and one additional star for the mere fact that the place is an old school shrine which totally love.  If there is another visit I'll try a sandwich since the round pizza even looked below average.  I find it hard to believe that this is the best that Brooklyn's got to offer.",3.0
"Normally I am not a hugh fan of the Gradma Slice.  The joints I have been to are okay when it comes to this type of Pizza.  However when it comes to this place, this is by far the best gradma slice I have ever had.  What makes it unique is the way that it is made with having the cheese on the bottom and the sauce on top.  I can see how this is an iconic Brooklyn landmark.  Would definatly go to this place again, even if I am far away from this place.",4.0
"Is there anything better than the pillowy pizza goodness one can find at Spumoni Gardens? Fresh out of the oven, ethereal, perfectly sauced...best sicilian style pizza around. The Italian ices are always a welcome end to the meal, and the people watching here alone is worth the trip.",5.0
"I took some Texan friends who have taken up making pizza as a hobby (they provide it for a winery out there) on a pizza crawl to some of the best pizzerias in Brooklyn.  A Brooklyn transplant of theirs in Texas insisted that L&B be part of the mix as it was to have the best ""squares"" (he didn't seem to understand what Sicilian meant) in the area.  I hate to say the emperor has no clothes, but I was seriously underwhelmed.  We had a regular slice and a square.  The regular was comparable to Original Ray's--very pedestrian.  The square was undercooked, OK sauce, and hardly a hint (but maybe that was the intention).  Fortunately, the rest of the day was filled with visits to Di Fara, Lucali, and Sottocasa.  We ran out of time for others but wish had used the L&B time for Roberta's.  If you're interested, Di Fara won first place, followed by Sottocasa and Lucali.  If the contest had been for calzones, then Lucali's would have wiped the field.",2.0

"I am not exaggerating when I say their Sicilian pizza is the best on the planet.I drive from central Jersey twice a year just to get a taste.Short story: I was poorly presenting a final presentation in a communications class and I was cruising for a failing grade on that project. I finished the presentation by talking about this pizza and describing it to my uneducated New Jersey classmates...I did not know that the teacher had once visited L&B, and proceeded to give me an A for the presentation. I would have failed otherwise. I swear on my life this is true.I passed my final because of this pizza. THAT'S HOW GOOD IT IS.If you are in Brooklyn, you get this pizza. End of story/",5.0

"Never have I been to a place more overrated in my life. Brooklyn natives should be ashamed of themselves for even letting this place exist by frequenting it. And not only that, but any time you criticize this place in the slightest, people from the neighborhood lose all rational sense and start yelling uncontrollably. People love this place in the same way Ray Lewis loves Jesus. It's just a little too loud, a little too forced, and a little too shreiky and obnoxious.Not sure if they are nostalgic for some point in history 50 years ago when this place served edible food, but that is no excuse. This place is dreadful. Imagine a stale piece of bread with disgusting tomato sauce on it, hiding sub-par cheese underneath and NASTY service, and you now know what this place is about.I will say nothing else, because this is the last time I ever wish to mention this place, or spend more than 5 seconds even giving it my attention.",1.0
"I found a Sicilian pizza place and needed to see if it was all that the Food Network hyped it up to be--actually I just really needed to see if any other square pizza could trump Buddy's in Detroit.  L & B puts the cheese above the dough and then the sauce above the cheese so you get A LOT of sauce (yum!)This is actually the original location and is still family-owned.  Ludovico Barbati came to the U.S. in 1917 and started selling his products in a horse & buggy.  When he became popular he decided to buy the vacant property on 86th St. in Brooklyn and built a structure to make the Spumoni and Ices.  In 1950 they built the second of the three buildings to sell pizza out of and later added the third building which is now the restaurant.  -Sicilian Square Slice: the sauce is delicious--a bit like tomato pasta sauce and what's nice is that even though there is so much of it, it doesn't fall off! But the semi-tasteless dough is overwhelming. Not enough cheese in my opinion. The crust is actually good because it's cheesy, garlicky and chewy. But Buddy's is still the king of square pizzas. -Rainbow Spumoni (pistachio, chocolate & vanilla): Woah. Your initial reaction is omgosh this is too sweet. But then you taste the bits of pistachio and it's quite good. Like there are actual pieces of pistachio in there. The chocolate, when you can get some has a strong taste and the vanilla also has a great flavor. I was surprised by how much I liked it.  What is spumoni exactly?  It's typically three flavors of ice cream with a fruit/nut layer in between.  FINAL VERDICT: If you are close to Coney Island visit the place.  It's nice because you can either eat in or just grab however many slices you want and sit at a table outside.  You can then grab some ice cream once you are done enjoying your pizza.  The pizza is certainly good, but the dough they used just didn't make me crave more.  I really did like the Spumoni though.  It's also nice just to see the locals who obviously come here a lot and to see the Italians that have been here for generations amidst the new population of folks in the area.",3.0

"Friends and I I took a trip to Brooklyn a little while ago to run some errands and go to this place. L&B apparently had the best Sicilian Pizza evaaaar! which means I had to try it. Well first off, I was surprised that ordering, paying, and getting the pizza all happened in under 3 minutes--L&B is constantly baking pies, so you can get your pizza with little to no waiting!I've never had Sicilian pizza before, so I can't compare this to prior experiences... however, I must admit that this was some bomb pizza. The crust/bread was soft and chewy, the tomato sauce was sweet and well seasoned, and the cheese added a nice touch of richness. Although the Sicilian seems rather simple, it works and is something I'd definitely come back for...Side Note: Spumoni ice was BOMB too!",5.0

The best pizza spot in brooklyn. The Sicilians are what they are known for. The pizza is similar to pizza bread and not like your typical pizza with loads of cheese. Be prepared to get 3 or four slices because they are amazing.,5.0

"Never have I been to a place more overrated in my life. Brooklyn natives should be ashamed of themselves for even letting this place exist by frequenting it. And not only that, but any time you criticize this place in the slightest, people from the neighborhood lose all rational sense and start yelling uncontrollably. People love this place in the same way Ray Lewis loves Jesus. It's just a little too loud, a little too forced, and a little too shreiky and obnoxious.Not sure if they are nostalgic for some point in history 50 years ago when this place served edible food, but that is no excuse. This place is dreadful. Imagine a stale piece of bread with disgusting tomato sauce on it, hiding sub-par cheese underneath and NASTY service, and you now know what this place is about.I will say nothing else, because this is the last time I ever wish to mention this place, or spend more than 5 seconds even giving it my attention.",1.0
"I found a Sicilian pizza place and needed to see if it was all that the Food Network hyped it up to be--actually I just really needed to see if any other square pizza could trump Buddy's in Detroit.  L & B puts the cheese above the dough and then the sauce above the cheese so you get A LOT of sauce (yum!)This is actually the original location and is still family-owned.  Ludovico Barbati came to the U.S. in 1917 and started selling his products in a horse & buggy.  When he became popular he decided to buy the vacant property on 86th St. in Brooklyn and built a structure to make the Spumoni and Ices.  In 1950 they built the second of the three buildings to sell pizza out of and later added the third building which is now the restaurant.  -Sicilian Square Slice: the sauce is delicious--a bit like tomato pasta sauce and what's nice is that even though there is so much of it, it doesn't fall off! But the semi-tasteless dough is overwhelming. Not enough cheese in my opinion. The crust is actually good because it's cheesy, garlicky and chewy. But Buddy's is still the king of square pizzas. -Rainbow Spumoni (pistachio, chocolate & vanilla): Woah. Your initial reaction is omgosh this is too sweet. But then you taste the bits of pistachio and it's quite good. Like there are actual pieces of pistachio in there. The chocolate, when you can get some has a strong taste and the vanilla also has a great flavor. I was surprised by how much I liked it.  What is spumoni exactly?  It's typically three flavors of ice cream with a fruit/nut layer in between.  FINAL VERDICT: If you are close to Coney Island visit the place.  It's nice because you can either eat in or just grab however many slices you want and sit at a table outside.  You can then grab some ice cream once you are done enjoying your pizza.  The pizza is certainly good, but the dough they used just didn't make me crave more.  I really did like the Spumoni though.  It's also nice just to see the locals who obviously come here a lot and to see the Italians that have been here for generations amidst the new population of folks in the area.",3.0
"Great pizza...In fact, among the best but they need to stop with the attitude and be a little more customer friendly.  The guys up front are tough guys and cannot be any more nasty when serving.  I get the whole Brooklyn attitude and all but they need to work on being nicer and friendlier when serving customers, after all it is NYC and there are tons of other options.",4.0
"Friends and I I took a trip to Brooklyn a little while ago to run some errands and go to this place. L&B apparently had the best Sicilian Pizza evaaaar! which means I had to try it. Well first off, I was surprised that ordering, paying, and getting the pizza all happened in under 3 minutes--L&B is constantly baking pies, so you can get your pizza with little to no waiting!I've never had Sicilian pizza before, so I can't compare this to prior experiences... however, I must admit that this was some bomb pizza. The crust/bread was soft and chewy, the tomato sauce was sweet and well seasoned, and the cheese added a nice touch of richness. Although the Sicilian seems rather simple, it works and is something I'd definitely come back for...Side Note: Spumoni ice was BOMB too!",5.0

"How did I know my husband was the one? When we watched a Man vs. Food episode featuring this place and he said, ""let's drive there tomorrow."" We went, the pizza is everything they say it is. We've had pasta dishes here. Baked ziti is excellent. Maybe order that and take a pizza home. Don't leave here without trying the pizza.",5.0
Fluffy Clouds of Pizza!! It's Haven in a Box! Need I say more! This is hands down one of the best and only places I will get Upside Down Pie... For those from out of town.. Its where they put the cheese down first on the dough and then the sauce! A half a tray will run you about $20 bucks and will feed 3 - 5 people nicely. If you need more get yourself a full tray and take some home and freeze it for another time! and it still taste as good as it did the first time you got it!!!  When you are done with eating pizza you need to get a cup of either their Spumoni or a cup of their delicious Creme Cycle as it is my all time favorite. This is our go to spot after band practice!,5.0
"THE BEST PIZZA. The end.Anyone who doesn't think so, I worry for you. I'm salivating just thinking about those perfect little squares of heaven so I must navigate away from this page now. L&B, just consider delivering to Queens! No? Ok fine. Still the best pizza.",5.0
"I don't know how I feel about this place.I've eaten food from here a few times and have always gotten mixed responses. The first time I came here for dinner, I really enjoyed my pasta. There were no complaints! The second time I got food here, was from a takeout pizza. It was rather soft, pretty good, but nothing too special. I came back with my significant other for dinner, and had no major issues with our food. In fact, since we were here rather late, they took off a charge for calamari and our dessert (since they didn't have the ones we asked about). That left a good impression! However, my significant other and his parents have frequently been stating lately that their pizza is getting worse. ""It isn't how it used to be"", they say. Unfortunately, I haven't tried their pizza back in 'the good 'ol days' so I am not one to say. They explained that they were disappointed with a recent experience at the restaurant and would no longer be coming back. Apparently, after ordering calamari as an appetizer, they didn't receive it until the main course had come. They asked to send it back until the course was finished, which they did, but unfortunately it came back cold. When they finally ate it, it wasn't even as good as it used to be. However, they still charged them for the poor quality of an appetizer.However, I personally wasn't turned off by their food. I tried a meatball hero at one point and it was rather good. The meatballs were very moist (maybe a little too moist) but they tasted good. Unfortunately, since it was takeout, they packed it in a way so that the bread and cheese got stuck to the plate and broke off as I ate.",3.0

"I went here on a tour of Brooklyn. Yes, a tour. I was only able to try the Sicilian pie, but boy was it good. Most pizzerias specialize in thin crust or Neapolitan styles so it was a nice change. You can sit inside for more of a formal dining experience or sit at one of the tables outside and just get down and dirty with your pizza.",4.0

"Had some today, and it was absolutely amazing. I don't know if I'd recommend it to anyone else simply because its more of a hit or miss with people. Its amazing pizza but some people aren't really into that kind.Personally I love that place, been going there forever.",5.0
"Never in my life has a place made me feel unwanted in their restaurant.  Another Hispanic family walked out after sitting for 15 Min and not even water was brought out to them. Smh, never coming back.",1.0
Best Sicilian pizza ever! The food is amazing in the air down restaurant as well! Also have amazing Spamoni only downside is that's it's sorta in the middle of nowhere & they don't deliver very far. But you will probably never find a Sicilian pizza better anywhere but here!,5.0
"You go there and notice it's obviously a neighborhood favorite, but didn't stand in line for more than 3 minutes because they have a smart set up: pizza on the left, dessert in the middle. I tried their Spumoni ice yesterday and not sure what's not to like. The texture was perfect, felt like the in between of ice cream and icee. The spumoni flavors, which consisted of pistachio, chocolate and vanilla were unexpectedly, refreshingly complimentary. Also, wanna know what else is pretty cool? They have a parking lot. Ohhhh yea, a parking lot in NYC is like a short line at Shake Shack. Score.This review will be completed when I go back for their pizza, but from the smells of it, there's only going to be an upward trend. ENJOY!",4.0
Great pizzas near the neighbourhood. Cheap and cheerful! Straight out from the oven!Highly recommend,4.0

"L&B? *Drools*I would pay top dollar for a square shipped to Vegas! This is my favorite pizza in the country! I'm a traveling guidette, I've been all over the place and nothings ever come close!Their secret is their fresh buffalo mozzarella, San Marzano tomato sauce and Pecorino Romano cheese. Their crust cannot be described in words. I grew up in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn and had L&B every weekend for the first 20 years of my life. Their pies aren't as cheap as some but you get what you pay for. For the quality ingredients they use, in the 80 year old brick oven,-- it's worth every dollar.

"I've loved this placed for many years before writing this review.  But, YELP asked me if I'd been here, so...The pizza is actually NOT what I love about this place.  I could live without their pizza.  Their rainbow spumoni (Chocolate, Creme and Pistachio) is, however, fantastic.  My favorite thing here is the REAL food served to-go or in the dining room.  I've never had a bad meal here.Favorite menu item: Frutta di mare (Cold Seafood Salad)",4.0

"Wow this place is highly rated?  I'm not sure exactly what all the hoopla is about this place, and maybe I'm not a New Yorker but I sure as hell do know how I like my pizza.  This is not that place.  So Sicilian pies are their thing here.  We ordered a plain cheese pizza and fried calamari.  Not really sure what the cost was for everything but it was $7 bucks per person which is pretty damn good.  But if you're looking for a good pizza, I would go elsewhere nor would I make a journey out here to grab a slice.  Their Sicilian pizza was very thick, with cheese on the bottom, sauce over the top, and that's it.  If you like wonder bread, you'd probably love their crust because that's what it reminded me of.  Way to doughy for my liking and missing that chewy characteristic I love so much.  The other edge of the crust was nice and crispy but everything else was just soft bread, not good.  The sauce was good, and I swear the put the sauce on top to cover up the fact they don't put any cheese on the pizza.  I honestly couldn't tell on two of my slices if there was any cheese on it and that's out of the 3 that I ate.  I understand a real Italian pizza is light on the cheese, but shoot, I should have some cheese on every slice.  Everything was fine though once doctored up with every condiment imaginable, hot pepper flakes, garlic seasoning, oregano, oh and of course parmesan cheese to make up for their lack of cheese.Sorry Spumoni, I've had better Sicilian pizzas at a number of places.",2.0
"I am so happy to have tried L & B Spumoni's Sicilian Pizza and the Spumoni Gelato today. However, I was a bit disappointed with the pizza part. I didn't feel like it was anything extraordinaire.

I still prefer Di Fara's Pizza (including their Sicilian version).Other than that, I thought the spumoni gelato was amazing!",3.0
"This place is 3 things- a pizzeria, a spumoni shop, and a sit down restaurant. The first 2 get 5 stars, the last one gets 3 stars= 4 stars.Round pie- who gets a round pie from L&B. They should just take it off the menu. The square is the way to go. come with a few friends, order a half tray, and dig in. No toppings needed. When I read posts and reviews about people putting toppings on the square pizza a little part of me inside dies... blasphemy! Great dough, good amount of cheese, and the sauce is sweet and so tasty and makes the slice. The spumoni and ices and ice cream. All good. I feel like a little kid every time I go up to the window after I finish my pizza and wait for ice cream. It's good stuff.The restaurant. meh. It's gone downhill for me. Portions have gotten smaller. Quality has dipped a bit. The waiters take your order, maybe bring your drinks, check on you, and then bring your check. Everything is generally handled by the bus boys. I've work in the biz and I don't really like that. I want to be able to deal with my server. It's hard sometimes even getting their attention. The food is decently good though, and you can order from the pizzeria too. They have plenty of outdoor seating for the summer. Gets busy here. But I love it guys.",4.0

My friend however said that the Sicilian was really good compared to most places, so I definitely will check out other Sicilian pizzas before I totally scratch this place off.

"went to L&B Spumoni Gardens finally on 3.9.14.  ive been wanting to try this place for a very very long time.  I was not dissapointed.  for a sunday night at 7:00pm the place was packed as expected.  i met with the hostess, brittney, who had a great, pleasant personalilty. i was taken back when speaking with her as i totally expected to get a little bit of new york / brooklyn attitude.  i was seated in ""john's"" section in the secondary dining room.  i was with a table of 6 total and we elected to start with the red house wine, a large sicilian style pie, and two salads, (pear salad & house salad)  probably the best red house wine ive ever had.  i would go back to this place to just drink this red wine.  absolutely remarkable!  the pizza was amazing.  definitely in the top 2 best ive ever had, maybe #1.  the house salad was ok.  wasnt crazy about the light catalina dressing it was served with, but its salad!  not a big deal.  i did not try the pear salad but it was gone in about 6 minutes flat.  my friends told me it was very good. for dinner our table ordered a few things and we all shared.  i had the veal chop served with vermouth sauce.  it was okay.  maybe i should have gotten it parm style, either way, the chop was prepared well, i just wasnt a big fan of the vermouth sauce.  i tried some of the ravioli and eggplant parm.  both were great.   for dessert, we got a gigantic sampler that looked like a science fiction project.  this thing had 6 suagr cones sticking out of it, three giant heaps of L&B flavored ices to scoop, a bunch of brownie slices, a piece of tiramisu pie, chocolate ice cream pie, and 4 or 5 tartufo desserts.  amazing.   i took a half of pie home back to jersey with me along with a gallon of L&B ice cream.  John our server was ACES, one of the better servers ive had in recent memory.  he had great energy, was very knowlegable about everythng on the menu that we had many questions about.  his recommendations were spot on.  i cant wait to go back.",4.0

"went to L&B Spumoni Gardens finally on 3.9.14.  ive been wanting to try this place for a very very long time.  I was not dissapointed.  for a sunday night at 7:00pm the place was packed as expected.  i met with the hostess, brittney, who had a great, pleasant personalilty. i was taken back when speaking with her as i totally expected to get a little bit of new york / brooklyn attitude.  i was seated in ""john's"" section in the secondary dining room.  i was with a table of 6 total and we elected to start with the red house wine, a large sicilian style pie, and two salads, (pear salad & house salad)  probably the best red house wine ive ever had.  i would go back to this place to just drink this red wine.  absolutely remarkable!  the pizza was amazing.  definitely in the top 2 best ive ever had, maybe #1.  the house salad was ok.  wasnt crazy about the light catalina dressing it was served with, but its salad!  not a big deal.  i did not try the pear salad but it was gone in about 6 minutes flat.  my friends told me it was very good. for dinner our table ordered a few things and we all shared.  i had the veal chop served with vermouth sauce.  it was okay.  maybe i should have gotten it parm style, either way, the chop was prepared well, i just wasnt a big fan of the vermouth sauce.  i tried some of the ravioli and eggplant parm.  both were great.   for dessert, we got a gigantic sampler that looked like a science fiction project.  this thing had 6 suagr cones sticking out of it, three giant heaps of L&B flavored ices to scoop, a bunch of brownie slices, a piece of tiramisu pie, chocolate ice cream pie, and 4 or 5 tartufo desserts.  amazing.   i took a half of pie home back to jersey with me along with a gallon of L&B ice cream.  John our server was ACES, one of the better servers ive had in recent memory.  he had great energy, was very knowlegable about everythng on the menu that we had many questions about.  his recommendations were spot on.  i cant wait to go back.",4.0
I love you I love you I love you I love you.The sicilian squares are AWESOME. Always get extra to take home. The lasagna is really good too. All of the food is really good and the spumoni is obviously very good as well.A few times they gave us free dessert which is SO kind. L&B.... I love you.,5.0
"This place doesn't ef around. Their sicilian pizza is on point. In the summer the best way to do it is go buy half a sq from their takeout window, bring it home, top it with whatever you want, toast it a little in the oven and go nuts!Their gelato and ices are a great way to finish a meal.",5.0
I don't get it.   We were told the wait would be 25 minutes (we called ahead-- make sure to call in a reservation) and then the actual wait was an hour and fifteen in the freezing cold lobby.   The food is Olive Garden level-- just standard mass-produced Italian.   I had the broccoli rabe and sausage.  My friend had the pizza.  It was meh.  Not worth the incredibly pain-in-the-ass wait.,2.0

"This was one of the worst restaurant experiences of my life. The reason being are the following:# 1 Main Reason was Service-I had the waiter acknowledge me only when I placed my order and upon receiving my check. The waiter never once asked me during my dining experience if I need anything additional, or how my food was etc. If Im paying for waiter service that is normally typical waiter 101 to ask question about my experience. I also ordered food in which I requested a box to take it home with but instead it was thrown away. Also, everyone else seem to have received a bread basket.  In addition, I had a dining guest with me through out my dining experience-Mr. FLY. The food was OK nothing over the top especially when there is countless Italian restaurants in the NY tri state area. I'll pass on returning here based on the poor service and just OK food.",1.0

"Go for the whole square pie.  Grab a seat and don't you dare leave until every slice is gone.  The cheese is under the sauce!  My guy was skeptical but once he took a bite, I think he almost proposed.  Bathroom could use some work ( totally gross) but you get to watch how the pizza is made while you do the pee pee dance  standing on line.  Lets hope the cooks use a better bathroom.",5.0

"My husband and I will take the 1 hour drive any time for L&B's Sicilians. We always order the half tray sicilian, which is insanely huge but we bring some home after. The slices are fluffy and delicious. You take one bite into the slice and its melt in your mouth heaven. I always order a salad with it because after all that much carbs you start to feel guilty. There has been occasions where my husband has ordered there garlic bread - (holy mother of cheeses) lets just say that was pretty good but I suffered some major heartburn from all the cheese smothered on the bread, they definitely give you about 4 heroes buns on that plate.

"This place is an institution in Brooklyn and never disappoints.  They are consistent and usually busy.  We got there at 10:30 pm on a Saturday night and there were plenty of people outside eating and a pie fresh out of the oven for us to enjoy.Square slices are my favorite and a must try.  Then go over to the next window and get yourself some spumoni, you won't regret it.",5.0
Dam Good Pizza!  Nice change having the sauce over the cheese.  Crust is Sicilian style (square) with the perfect amount of crispiness and chew.  Sauce is very flavorful and all ingredients are excellent quality.  Would I wait in a 30 minute line for the pizza?. No but I'm a spoiled New Yorker and never wait more than 15 mins. There is always another place to eat. But definitely a unique and delicious experience if  you are from out of town.,4.0
"Oh. my. goodness. Oh. my. dayum.""It's the elite spot for pizza with service! You have to go!"" said my sister. Normally, I'm not a pizza fan, but with family from the west coast, sure why not. Right off the train station walking and all of a sudden, the aroma of tomato sauce and fresh bread hit me. ""What an alluring scent, surely can't exist in Brooklyn..."" But it does.Goodness, large outdoor seating with numerous customers taking pies to go while others sit and eat their beauty of a slice. So many happy faces from various ages - the elderly laughing and holding a slice that's 3/4 of their face, middle aged couples eating and talking aloud, teens on their mobiles snapping their slices in the proper lighting, and young'ins chewing while eyeing their next slice. What a friendly and joyful place to eat at - fantastic atmosphere.Within the restaurant, the seating space isn't the largest, but it can hold an abundance of fun and deliciousness. Slightly cramped and ninja-ing your way through seats - the customers I nearly bumped into were all so friendly; guess I chose the right path.Anyhoo, onward to the order. Honestly, come here for a pizza. 12 slices is 1/2 a pie I believe, so image 24 slices of soft chewy bread layer with flavorful red tomato sauce with your desire of toppings. How can you say no?! My group also ordered pastas, chicken entrees, and I got a lasagna plate as sides if you will.Our 1/2 square pie was: 1/2 with mushrooms, 1/2 plain. Very good right at sight and touch. Crispy bottom, soft bread, right amount of tomato flavor to bread ratio - evenly flavored on all sides (because their squares, equal sides... Is that a chuckle? I'll take it!) Both my slices were exquisitely delicious!There were many pasta dishes. Penne a la vodka was creamy and plentiful in sauce (a little too much, but oh the better to dip with). A simple dish with marinara was still good with tomato pieces within the sauce and the right amount of saltiness.Chicken entree with mushrooms was moist yet lean. However, not the lean-dry texture rather a tender cut with a complementing sauce. It was just good.The lasagna plate was so hefty. Large plate for a large serving of lasagna slices and meat. Hoo, 2 people had a hard time finishing it due to the food choices on the table. Love the cheese placement within this dish because it was just right.All this food, what about the service? Alas, in the beginning, we didn't have immediate attention but it was better and stayed at that level. Our waiter was fantastic - didn't get his name, but so amiable and personal to us. Gave us suggestions and even told us what the cooks there do best (Note, he wasn't evening pointing to expensive plates, rather the cheaper yet overlooked ones) Excellent, excellent, superb! Hell, he would've done extraordinarily well during these recent presidential debates, just saying.To top off the night, we exited to get some ice cream outside. Spumoni was tasty and smooth plus comes in a decent size for the price. The prices overall were reasonable for dessert.Total price for the night doesn't compare to the food, service, and atmosphere in my opinion. This place is a joy to eat in and more joyful with a large party.My sister also mentioned the head chef who comes out to greet and treat customers. I must come back to meet this jovial man!Bellissimo! Delizioso! Oh, my Brooklyn pizza haven.",5.0

"Came on a Monday night and parked right in front, on the street.

"After having ah-mazing deep dish pizza in chicago, my friend suggested this place to me. It's not exactly deep dish but similar with the cheese under the sauce. Sorry but it definitely doesn't even come close. There was too much dough, the sauce was sweet which I don't mind too much but it was just okay. I did enjoy their special dessert. The dessert is different at every table and depends on the the amount of people that you have. Loved the fudge, cheesecake, not so much the brownie (and I usually LOVE LOVE brownies but not from here), the gelato was good too but not for me. The table next to us had two cones with a few gelato flavors on a plate so depends on who makes the dessert and what they feel like putting on it.",3.0
"Is this place a pretty good pizza place? I'm honestly not sure but they do offer their well knwon sauce on top pizza which is unique and gives them points.

"Mama mia! What a pizza!Their Sicilian is simple, yet so unique. I've never thought that I would find something so simple, so elegant and yummy. The crust combines the unique texture of original Italian bread. The sauce brings up childhood memories in the mom's kitchen, tasting so sweet and a bit spicy. And as the cheese unifies the flavors, it travels you to other places and time.For a summer night dinner, it is a must!",4.0
"Never been to Gravesend? Yeah, me neither...until now. And it was def worth a visit out to this much-heralded pizza joint on a rather mundane strip in South Brooklyn. Why?The squares man, the squares! Not quite a grandma's, not quite a sicilian and def not you're average slice of pie. This is a whole new category, almost like an upside down slice with the ample sweet red sauce on top and cheese nestled comfortably underneath on top of crispy, thick crust.And due to the high volume they're always coming out pippin hot n fresh...no stale ass, laying around pies here.And in addition to the unique pies, the layout of this place is noteworthy due to a LARGE patio deck with picnic tables out front for your sun-worshiping pleasure. A great way to spend a leisurely lunch throwin down some tasty squares!And lest you think that's all there is to it, this is a 3 in 1 kinda place with a wait serviced indoor portion if you want something slightly more formal and of course, there's the spumoni next door serving up the name sake Italian ice cream.So gas up your metrocard and day trip it or make it a pit stop on your way to Coney Island.",4.0
"Made the hour and 45 minute (one way) train trip after hearing about this place on some TV show.Here's what we ordered:-caesar salad ($7.95): I thought this caesar salad was pretty darn good!

I only ate one slice but could see myself eating another one because the dough is so light and doesn't fill you up fast!I am a new fan, but for where I live, not worth the trip to go on a regular basis.

Located in Bensonhurst, people FLOCK from all over to grab a slice of their famous Sicilian pizza. (Don't dare order a regular slice! Sicilian is the way to go.)  There is usually a wait for tables and pizza, and since we were late to meet everyone, I was freaking out that the line would be insane.  Lucky for us, the place wasn't too crowded, and my BFF Allison did us a solid by grabbing some tables AND ordering a pie ahead of time, so it would be ready when we arrived. I will state that I was never a fan of Sicilian pizza. I was (and still am) a thin crust loyalist.  But this pizza... it was good.  Most Sicilian slices, at least that I've had, are very dense, and thick, and almost too much dough.  But this was a perfect ratio of crust, dough, cheese and sauce. Not too saucy, just enough cheese, the spices were spot on.  How good was it??  I had 3 slices.  THREE.  If you know me, I barely finish anything.  Except bags of microwave popcorn.  Even though it was dripping gross cold rain outside, and we were stuffed to the gills with pizza, we ducked into the restaurant side of Spumoni Gardens next door for.... spumoni!!!  If you aren't aware of what spumoni is, Wikipedia defines it as ""Italian ice cream made with layers of different colors and flavors, usually containing candied fruits and nuts. The ice cream layers are often mixed with whipped cream. Chocolate and pistachio are the typical flavors of the ice cream layers."" Yes please!!!  I got pistachio, while my husband got chocolate.

"If you plan on ordering delivery from l&b you better have a back up plan. First, it will take a MINIMUM of an hour and a half to be delivered. They will tell you 45 minutes when you order but it never actually comes. When the food does finally arrive at its destination it will be cold. Lastly you will have to be prepared to eat whatever it is they felt like sending. Ordered on salad? Surprise, didn't have the ingredients so they sent a different salad. At least it's in the same realm of what you originally ordered. Other surprises have included ordered raviolis parmigiana, received raviolis covered in parmigiana cheese. Ordered rice ball special, received plate of grilled chicken. My personal favorite: ordered fried zucchini, received baked clams. Called to request they send back the correct order and the guy argued that they don't have clams and I must be mistaken.  Are you kidding me? When you call to ask where the food that you have waited an hour and a half for is, or to request that the correct food be sent, the attitude is well what do you want me to do about it? There is no apology or compensation and if your naive enough to ask them to resend your order you will wait another hour and a half. You would think these issues would be solely on the delivery portion, but the same issues arise in the restaurant. I ordered raviolis parmigiana and received a plate of raviolis covered with cheese but NO SAUCE. the waiter told me the cooks did not understand what I was asking for.Overall, I'm done. Yes, the pizza is good and the rest of their menu is decent but I'm sick and tired of what ends up on my plate taking two hours, being cold and having to win the lottery to receive what I actually ordered.

"My wife and I recently stopped here as part of the ""A Slice of Brooklyn Pizza Tour"" (highly recommend!) and definitely enjoyed the pizza and spumoni.  We had slices of the simple Sicilian cheese pizza and I must say that I've never had anything quite like it.  I've had plenty of similar pizza (square, sicilian style, thicker crust), but nothing that compared in terms of crust.  The way they layer the cheese on top of the crust (in between the bread and sauce) in order to keep the crust intact is genius!  If you didn't know it, you might think the crust was a little ""doughy"", but that's actually the layer of pecorino romano!  It really does keep the crust dry so you can enjoy that nice, flaky, light and airy goodness!  The sauce is definitely a little sweet, but very good!If you like sicilian style pizza (and even if you don't), you definitely must try this place!  And be sure to give the spumoni (I recommend pistachio) a try too, it was excellent!Although we visited in winter (it was cold) and ate inside, they have plenty of outdoor seating and this looks like an excellent place to enjoy the weather and some great food on a nice day!Positives: Great pizza (the crust and sauce stand out), excellent spumoni, historic/famous place, lots of seating both outdoors and indoors.",4.0

"Every summer a bunch of us pile into a car, head over the bridges, and head to L&B's. We love it. We sit outside, soak up the atmosphere and have a blast.We love the Sicilian pizza, the music and of course the Spumoni. You go just as much for the atmosphere as you do for the food. It's just so Brooklyn!I grew up in Brooklyn and when I need my home fix, I head out there. Even as a kid this was our destination for spumoni on special occasions. Believe it or not I've never been to the indoor restaurant because we always sit outside, so I can't comment on the service or the food in there. I remember being there when I was 10, and now my little one is almost 10. Time really flies, but this play stays the same, and that's a good thing.",4.0
"This place is a neighborhood entity that is still family owned and has been around for over 60 years. The squares (sicilians) are delicious and the regular slices are good as well. Their ingredients are high quality. The cheese, dough and sauce they use are very good and the standout is the rich, savory sauce. I would rate the slices out of a possible ten..about a 7. The squares are a 9. Awesome. If they were a bit bigger they would be a 10. People eat the pizza outside on the tables they provide, but there is also a restaurant part that serves all sorts of entrees. I had the shrimp parmigiana with pasta and the portion was huge and the price was affordable. They take reservations for this part of their restaurant and accept credit/debit as well.If you happen to be in this part of Brooklyn, then you should definitely stop by and have a bite to eat.",4.0
"If you plan on ordering delivery from l&b you better have a back up plan. First, it will take a MINIMUM of an hour and a half to be delivered. They will tell you 45 minutes when you order but it never actually comes. When the food does finally arrive at its destination it will be cold. Lastly you will have to be prepared to eat whatever it is they felt like sending. Ordered on salad? Surprise, didn't have the ingredients so they sent a different salad. At least it's in the same realm of what you originally ordered. Other surprises have included ordered raviolis parmigiana, received raviolis covered in parmigiana cheese. Ordered rice ball special, received plate of grilled chicken. My personal favorite: ordered fried zucchini, received baked clams. Called to request they send back the correct order and the guy argued that they don't have clams and I must be mistaken.  Are you kidding me? When you call to ask where the food that you have waited an hour and a half for is, or to request that the correct food be sent, the attitude is well what do you want me to do about it? There is no apology or compensation and if your naive enough to ask them to resend your order you will wait another hour and a half. You would think these issues would be solely on the delivery portion, but the same issues arise in the restaurant. I ordered raviolis parmigiana and received a plate of raviolis covered with cheese but NO SAUCE. the waiter told me the cooks did not understand what I was asking for.Overall, I'm done. Yes, the pizza is good and the rest of their menu is decent but I'm sick and tired of what ends up on my plate taking two hours, being cold and having to win the lottery to receive what I actually ordered. There's plenty of other great pizza places in the area, l&b is just resting on their reputation without the follow thru to back it up.",1.0
"There are two parts of Spumoni Gardens - the sit down restaurant the take-out section. The outdoor section us great. You can get their amazing pizza, salads or heroes, and spumoni. While you can't get them all from the same window and sometimes have to wait on three lines, they are pretty quick and hey, the same could be said for a Food Court.The restaurantnproper is a great place to eat with family and friends. The food is delicious, especially their baby artichokes with garlic and wine sauce. YUM!Why not five stars? On Sunday you can only order something called Chef's Table. For a party or a group, its great. If you just want to sit down and enjoy something simple, you can't.",4.0
"My wife and I recently stopped here as part of the ""A Slice of Brooklyn Pizza Tour"" (highly recommend!) and definitely enjoyed the pizza and spumoni.  We had slices of the simple Sicilian cheese pizza and I must say that I've never had anything quite like it.  I've had plenty of similar pizza (square, sicilian style, thicker crust), but nothing that compared in terms of crust.  The way they layer the cheese on top of the crust (in between the bread and sauce) in order to keep the crust intact is genius!  If you didn't know it, you might think the crust was a little ""doughy"", but that's actually the layer of pecorino romano!  It really does keep the crust dry so you can enjoy that nice, flaky, light and airy goodness!  The sauce is definitely a little sweet, but very good!If you like sicilian style pizza (and even if you don't), you definitely must try this place!  And be sure to give the spumoni (I recommend pistachio) a try too, it was excellent!Although we visited in winter (it was cold) and ate inside, they have plenty of outdoor seating and this looks like an excellent place to enjoy the weather and some great food on a nice day!Positives: Great pizza (the crust and sauce stand out), excellent spumoni, historic/famous place, lots of seating both outdoors and indoors.",4.0

"My daughter was out in Brooklyn visiting college friends and the family she stays with raves about this place. This time out she brought back a Sicilian pie and two containers of spumoni. I have not had spumoni for over 40 years and just tasting it brought back wonderful memories of my grandparents and great grandparents, dinners with the family and spumoni for dessert.  For dinner tonight we heated up some of the sicilian slices and have not had pizza that good since I left Jersey 14 years ago. My daughter tells me that L&B is the only place that her girlfriends parents go for Italian food and pizza. I can only speak about the pizza but if it was that good after a drive out from Brooklyn, then I can only imagine how good everything else is. Looks like we need to make a trip out to L&B sometime this summer.",4.0
"I didn't intend to use a Brooklyn accent but for some reason ""square"" came out like ""squa."" The dough itself had much more flavor than is common. The namesake dessert is also impressive. Stick with the outdoor pizza section instead of the sit-down restaurant part.",4.0
"My personal favorite pizza, the Sicilian square at L&B's. The zest in the homemade sauce, combined with the sweet soft thick dough and crispy crust provides for an experience worth the out of the way trek. To wrap it up, the not too sweet spumoni gelato (and hell most of their flavors of ice cream), I would take this pizza joint over any other any day of the week.",5.0
"My favorite Brooklyn pizza! Unique & Memorable... If I knew I would never set foot in Brooklyn again, this would be the last slice of SQUARE that I would want to eat.  But [yes, there is also a 'but'] I don't like the regular slice. Go for the square and some spumoni afterwards!",4.0

They are good even the next day when you eat the leftovers at home.  The restaurant also has delicious yummy italian dishes.  You really feel like you're in an italian home with the loud diners eating around you.",4.0
"Once again, another reason to be a proud Brooklyn Native.Not much to say, really.  Don't get a slice, get the square.  If you want to experience the hype, please oblidge to that.Ended up eating 4 squares in about an hour span last weekend, was so worth it.The sauce is more on the sweet side, but it's a good complement to the cheese which is underneath.Wait times are minimal, and there are multiple seats, both indoors and outdoors.  Don't expect to spend a lot of dough, as everything is somewhat reasonably priced, even considering inflation in the last 10 years or so.Really, it's all about the uniqueness of the pizza taste, which is not duplicated.  Granted, there are a lot of other excellent pizza places similar (DiFara's, Grimaldi's, etc), but they really don't deserve to be compared to one another.  They all bring a unique flavor (no pun intended) and all have something to bring to the table (pun intended!).If you want to be Brooklyn-ized, go to this place.  This reminds me of what Brooklyn was, which is starting to change.The food menu is pretty solid too, they have a number of different sandwiches.  Aside from being a hamburger conoseur, I happen to like many-a-chicken parm.  They also bring a quality hero as well.Get the square if your're smart, and you won't be disappointed.Three Cheers for L & B!",4.0

"I had never heard of this place before, but I was fortunate enough to have someone bike me here. They have a large outdoor area with picnic tables and take out windows, great for warm night and sunny days. They have a dine-in area too, but it didn't look that appealing. To be honest, I'm not a Sicilian pizza person; I find Sicilian slices to be a waste of carbs with all that thick dough, but much to my surprise it can be very good. We tried a middle, corner, and side slice. You might think that there isn't a difference, oh but there is... the middle is much more undercooked, so you have more doughiness/chewiness. I personally didn't like it as much as the side slice, where you had good proportions of crust to cheese ratio, good crispness from side and on the bottom. The corner had too much crust for me and not enough sauce and cheese to compensate for the extra dough. All 3 had good crunch on the bottom. We also ordered fried calamari, which was terrible. The marinara sauce for dipping tasted like water downed tomato sauce with extra sugar or ketchup. The calamaris itself lacked flavor too.   In summary, order a side slice of pizza and go to the next window and order a large spumoni. My mistake was ordering a small.",4.0
"I don't frequent Brooklyn or as my dad says Brooka-lean...but I will say that I will be coming back more often simply because of this place. This place is illegal in 7 countries. I mean the food is outstanding. Da-best. I went here for a my gf's grandma's 90th bday party. Everything was family style. I will try to recollect what we had but I am still in a food coma. They brought out apps by the truck full or at least it looked that way. A few personal pizza's to start to sample. Oh-my-god. Probably one of the best pizza I have ever had. It was so soft, the sauce was so fresh, the toppings were delicious. Everything was perfect together. Then the salad came out...I tried it to feel as though I had some greens in me. Then the clams oreganato: great but dry crumbs...still excellent. Then came out the mozzarella in carrozza (so freaking good), then the rice balls (amazing) and you would think it would stop there...oh no. Time for the pasta (ziti in bolognese sauce and spaghetti in clam/garlic sauce), both were very good. The best part of the meal (other than the dessert) were the stuffed artichokes...holy cow they were superb! Stuffed with breadcrumbs and shrimp...yummy! I tried to slow down but it really wasn't working. So there was a 30 minute break and all of a sudden sliced steak cooked to perfection (family style), grouper and broccoli rabe were brought out. You wouldn't think the steak would be great but it was so good I overloaded on it. I tried the grouper but I am not much of a fish eater...it was ok. The broccoli rabe was good as well. So I think that's it...really...is that a boat of ice cream coming out...seriously...oh my...yeah it is....there was cheesecake and ice cream and chocolate cake and their world famous spumoni...Now if you have never had spumoni, you need to go here to truly witness the best you will ever have...I can go on and on but seriously everything I tried/over loaded on was awesome. Their service was top notch. The staff was super friendly, funny, attentive and really made a special day even more so.

"I don't get the hype at all. I am an open minded eater so when people told me the squares here are 'upside down' I thought cool.. But really there's a reason for pizza being the way it is.

We had to chase the server down to put in the adults' food order. The food took forever. The server was practically invisible. I watched the tables around us turn over repeatedly while we languished, picking food from the kids' plates and sharing ice cubes for hydration, hoping our food would be next. When the food actually came out, orders were wrong. Pieces were missing. We found a wire twist tie inside of one of our meatballs. The food that was supposed to make up for the crowd and the bad service turned out to be standard pizzeria fare - nothing special and certainly nothing worth the hype.

I could eat you all day and all night L&B silician slice! My absolute favorite silician slice in NYC! I've gotten a pie to go and it still tastes good when you reheat it. FYI: I've come up with the perfect method to reheating pizza. You take the pizza slice and you place it in the microwave for a minute or so untill the cheese melts. (I know you guys think mircrowaving pizza is gross but i'm not finished yet) Then you take the slice and place it on a heated fry pan. It makes the crust all nice and cripsy. This method is better than a conventional oven because 1. its a lot quicker and 2. the sauce is not all completely dried up. Try it and let me know how it goes for you!,5.0

I bought 2 slices and it got me really full. Eating the square slice was like eating bread. It was too doughy for me. On the positive side, I liked their sweet tomato sauce and the thick crust.

I cannot count how many times I've eaten this pizza on the train. Yes, I have no shame, but with this pizza that's quite all right in my book, any-day!",5.0
"L and B is famous for their square slices and spumoni so I went to try. I was never really a fan of square slices. It's too thick and reminds me of nyc public school school lunches. I gave the square slice a try and it was just okay for me. I love triangle slices more because it's thin, crunchy, and the cheese is stringy when I take a bite. I bought 2 slices and it got me really full. Eating the square slice was like eating bread. It was too doughy for me. On the positive side, I liked their sweet tomato sauce and the thick crust. The square slice didn't live up to the hype for me. I'll be better off grabbing a slice from my local joint.",3.0
The best sicilian style pizza in Brooklyn!  A must for anyone traveling in the area! Also highly recommend the  sausage and peppers sandwich,5.0
"This used to be my favorite pizza. But, in recent years, it hasn't held up to my memories of how great it was. But, I'm still a fan... maybe just for nostalgic reasons. :)",4.0
I know so many people who swear by their Sicilian pizza but I don't find it to be as amazing. I always feel like the top of the pizza is undercooked. I think the fact that the cheese is under the sauce has something to do with that. I prefer regular pies from there. Just not wowed by the pizza at all.,3.0

"Man, what a difference a year makes in a place. First off, the square pizza is awesome. Come here to eat pizza, that is a good thing, then finish off your meal with the best and only spumoni around. That is great and what gives this place a 3 star rating. If the restaurant were 1/3 as good as the square pizza, this place would rate 5 stars.The food is just ok here. The service is HORRIBLE. We used to come regularly last year and years before and the experience was worth waiting for. Tonight, the waiters sucked eggs. They were way too young, inattentive, and they had a flock of busboys and servers that reflected truly poorly on the place. I thought, man, this is really ghetto now. Add to that, the stupidity of them, I asked them to wrap the left over calamari, and forget the garlic bread, and i come home to find the exact opposite. It isn't too much to expect the service people to speak english, is it??So, save your money for pizza and spumoni and the heck with the bad restaurant with crap service.",3.0

You want the pistachio ice cream and the spumoni. The atmosphere is fun- last time I was there a crew on motorcycles was getting their pizza and it was entertaining.

"2 stars for the quality of the bread and the pasta. 4 stars for the pizza and and shrimp caprese. I'm being generous about the pizza because my brother reeeally hyped it up for me :/ All in all, I do not believe that L&B's was entirely worth waiting an hour for. I'll have to come back in the summer for spumoni as well, but I'm frankly disappointed. I don't understand why they bother serving bread when it's practically stale. The cinnamony bread was okay, but I felt very dissatisfied with the bread overall. :/ My dad got the veal milanese with spaghetti & marinara on the side (automatic option). The veal was sadly bland and dry, and the sauce did not compensate well. The spaghetti in marinara was a joke; it looked and tasted like there was no effort put into it at all. The shrimp caprese, on the other hand, was bursting with flavor; I think the egg was also marinated in the sauce, and it was a hit. The pasta did not pick up the sauce well, and the al dente state of the pasta was heavy, rather than bouncy. It wasn't very enjoyable. The famous, oft-raved Sicilian pizza was well-presented and doughy. My brother insisted on getting the plain one (because it was purportedly ""so good already""), but I was unable to appreciate it in its original splendor. I can love plain pizza if the sauce and cheese is amazing, but this pizza ... I don't know. Perhaps I'm just not a fan of the heavy doughiness.

"Unique among pizzas in Brooklyn.  The most obvious difference is how doughy and thick its crust is.  High quality mozzarella sits under the sauce and melts into the crust which gives it an extra doughy consistency.  They're generous with their sauce which is sweet and more viscous than most other pizzas.  While this isn't your typical NY style pizza, it's reliably delicious.",4.0
"You can get a whole pizza pie in about 30"".  Just walk up to the window, and Bam! The cheese pizza was flavorful and everything i expect out of a pie.  I also got some to go items from inside.  The Spaghetti Carbonera was filling and delicious.  Garlic bread and their regular bread was a nice accompaniment.  But, you must get the spumoni ice cream/gelato.  They had they best pistachio flavor I have had in a very long time.  The food and atmosphere is all good!",4.0
"L&B's set up reminds us of Brooklyn times I've never experienced.  Going out for pizza with one's crotchety dad after a Little League game, some kind of Philip Roth or other 70s Jewish writer remembrances.  The shape of the Sicilian slice reminds me of the cafeteria pizza I unselfconsciously enjoyed as a kid.  The taste is so much more, sweetish sauce, crumbled parmesan cheese that looks ungenerous, but actually adds enough tang, a dollop of mozzarella.  It is a unique slice of Sicilian pizza and certainly the best of its kind.  As an ice cream obsessor, I had to try the spumoni.  It looks like it hails from a deep, warm tradition I never participated in, looks like balls of Neapolitan ice cream I've never seen or tasted, a reminder of beloved desserts and when this neighborhood was mostly Italian.  It tasted like a pistachio almond concoction and was overall delicious though not very creamy.  When my friends and I came to try this place, I gawked at the ""real Brooklyn Italians"" with teased hair, troweled on makeup, and large families... in this pizza joint surrounded by Jewish stores and Russian Uzbek waiters hanging out outside of Baku.  I rarely see teased hair and generally find most Italians that grew up in pre-Giuliani New York in places like New Jersey.  I imagined the countless families rewarding each other and celebrating here.  However, I hear bad things about the table service and restaurant food despite the epic spumoni cake I saw someone bring out.  I wouid rather eat outside and pretend I'm in some New York version of Slums of Beverly Hills.  Though this is far and away superior to a Sizzler.",4.0

"Went here last summer.. The place was packed but it didn't take long before we were seated.. I started with the mozzarella sticks which was fresh and made that day..

Next time I will try the pizza..4 stars all the way!!!",4.0

"Came here for my bf's birthday and got the chef's table.  We figured that the chef's table is whatver Spumoni had extras.  It's usually 40-70/per person but the waiter was nice and charged us $35/per person.  Ok so appetizers were shrimp cocktail, fried shrimp, salad, fried cheese, clams (maybe it was mussels?).  We got penne a la vodka (delicious) and putanesca (ok) and then a chicken dish (delicious) with a HUGE plate of green beans (awesome).  For dessert the waiter suprised my bf with spumoni with Happy Birthday written across the plate.  We both didn't ask for this although he mentioned it was his birthday to see if they could do anything about the price of the chef's table.  Awesome service, huge portions and just a good ole grand time!",4.0

"L&B has spumoni and Silician pies down to a science. After a long, hot day at Coney Island, a group of us head to L&B's to refuel. We sat inside (so mother freaking hot and sweaty out there), and while we had to wait a while for someone to come to the table, the guy who finally did was awesome. Like, just a really good guy. I would be friends with him. So friendly and conscientious. Love that. He got us going with pitchers of ice water and huge baskets of bread and SO much soft butter. I HATE hard as rock butter that destroys and mangles my bread and this place seems to know what's up.We got a caesar salad and 1/2 Sicilian pie with pepperoni. There were four of us and the 1/2 pie was plenty. I've heard the whole pie is the size of a football field or something. The dressing on the caesar was really good, but there was a little too much of it...something you'll rarely hear me complaining about. The pie was good, really good, with a unique almost lasagna-like sauce. It just proved to me, though, that I really am more of a thin-crust person. Not L&B's fault.I got a cup of mint chocolate chip ice cream (had to...it's my fave and I was coming off a looooong diet) and we got this huge volcano of a dessert whose name I can't remember.

You have to eat them while they are hot though. Their pizza is thick, chewy in the middle, slightly crispy on the bottom and extra saucy on top. Yummmm.Their sit-down food is excellent as well. My bf and I ordered a chicken cacciatore and pasta bolognese, both quite tasty. Halfway into our meal, the chef comes over and offers us a taste of their steak. We were surprised as to how friendly he was! Then he brought over a complimentary plate of fish from the chef's menu and boy were we blown away!!

"This is the best Sicilian Pizza I've ever had; I prefer traditional style by far, but this is Sicilian style that's impossible to pass up if you're as big of a pizza lover as I am.  The lines can get quite long, but the guys quickly turn these pizzas out as they restrict no toppings on single slices; I don't mind because I think this helps move things along quickly.  Typically, most people order a half-tray (12 slices) or a whole tray (24 slices).  I grabbed a half tray with my dinner date for the evening, and before I knew it I stuffed 4 slices down my gullet.  Like I said before, I'm not the biggest fan of Sicilian, but I am definitely fan of the greatest pizza sauce I've ever tasted.  While I have my go-to spots for slices of cheese, and my gourmet gems for my favorite style (Brick-oven that is), I've never had a pizza sauce better than Spumoni Gardens.  It had the right amount of sweetness to it and the perfect dashes of herbs and seasonings, accentuating the tomato flavors in all the right ways.Some other reviewers said there could be more cheese on these slices, and while I'm an avid cheese lover, that's not what this pizza is meant to be.  It's meant to be a tribute to what traditional Italian pizza sauce should taste like.  If it were loaded with cheese, it would definitely add greasiness and take away from the purity of the crispy Sicilian shell and the perfection of the best pizza sauce ever.  I wish I could tell you about more food options here (like the 4 different types of hero's the table next to me ordered looked amazing), but sadly the pizza was all I had room for.  I tried some of the Vanilla Chip water ice later on and was not a fan; it wasn't bad but it was also WATER ICE (icy, chipped) not ITALIAN ICE (creamy, smooth).  I'm usually not that picky, but being in Brooklyn and having such good pizza, I expected more from the water ice.Do yourself a favor, in fact do your whole family a favor, pick up a whole tray of sicilian and bring it home for everyone to enjoy!",5.0
"What a great little pizza/Italian ice joint to go to when there's a line forming/no parking at Totonno's. You'll save money too. The pizza here is probably 3 stars. The extra star is for the parking lot. This place comes with its own parking lot. Who the f*ck has their own parking lot in NY??! FEEL FREE TO DRIVE HERE! I had a slice of both regular and square. The regular was regular, the square was interesting. It's just sauce on top. Both slices were very fresh as each pie is sold off quickly. You will hear the word ""NEXT"" here more than in any other place in our observable universe. My favorite part about this place (besides the AMPLE parking) was the seating. It's just a bunch of picnic tables outdoors which is awesome in the summer. It's akin to being in a convertible. Yeah A/C is nice in a car but really there's nothing like a convertible.

"This HAS to be a 5.It took me almost an extra 35 minutes to find Spumoni Gardens, but luckily, I was able to track it down. I found a space in the small parking lot on the side (if you don't, good luck) and then walked over to the window. The process of ordering is really easy and quick.

"We went here on the second day of summer, so you can imagine it was HOT, our plans to sit outdoors quickly changed when we couldn't take the heat. We had some square pizzas ,calamari and I had the Caesar Salad with chicken. The food was great, the salad portion was big (took home half). The service is slow our waiter, never came over to see if we needed anything, except when we flagged him down. The seats are packed to close to each other , but I guess that's how it is at a family style restaurant. When we arrived at 4pm the place was half packed , by 5:00 pm it was full.",4.0
Did you know they have a restaurant? Probably not since most ppl come for the outdoor seating and pizza which if you do go get a square its the best even tho they sold off the place and the recipe isn't as good as it used to be. But on the off chance you want food go inside to the right order the calamari or the clams they are great authentic not over breaded and the right app to a great dinner.,3.0
I gave L&B's 5 stars for their awesome Sicilian squares! It's one of those places that you have cravings for. I've been their lots of times over the last 3 years since I live nearby. The restaurant has a variety of pastas and Italian must-haves. They are delicious and you get a lot for your money.,5.0
"Killer Spumoni Great in the summertime sitting outside under the big awning.  They are know for their square Sicilian and Spumoni The rest of their food is okay so just go for Spumoni and SlicesSome rules:  never order a slice or such of Sicilian with toppings.  They have an indoor part but it's always crowded The sauce is sweet but not too sweet.  They put a touch of cheese on the squares.  is it the best pizza ever?  No, but it's very good and worth the journey and is a fun time since it's close to Coney Island",4.0
"A coworker recommended we come here after a day at Cony Island.  We originally tried Totonno's, but I was rudely told it would be an hour and a half wait for a pie.  We left, and my boyfriend remembered the suggestion regarding L&B.  Not only was there sufficient parking, but the pizza was awesome.  Instead of shelling out 20 dollars for a whole pie that we weren't going to eat, we only paid 12 for 4 slices and 2 sodas.  The only thing I didn't like was the fact that this place is GUIDO CENTRAL.  Living on Long Island, I thought I had seen the guidoest of the guidos, but this place proved me wrong =P.  Good pizza, nice atmosphere--4 stars.",4.0

"This place is awesome.  Ive been here for just the pizza and also for the chefs table.  The staff is good and the food is just plain awesome.  Once when I came here, the staff asked my party of 3 if we could move so they could use our table to make a bigger table for another big party that just came in.  It was no big deal since we had just sat down and didn't even order yet.  They were so apologetic and comped us some pizza and our spumoni dessert and we didn't even expect that.  Gotta love a proactive staff!  Thank you!",5.0

"This HAS to be a 5.It took me almost an extra 35 minutes to find Spumoni Gardens, but luckily, I was able to track it down.

I immediately tasted the sweet sauce, gooey cheese, soft upper crust and deliciously burnt bottom crust. It brought back memories of Sheeps Head bay, Bay Ridge, and Coney island; growing up in the 90's, having L&B on the weekends with my family. I can't even begin to convey the kind of emotional response just seeing a picture of this pizza brought back. It is that good.

I made the trek from Lower Manhattan, so perhaps that is persuading my perception of the pizza, but I didn't think it was everything Yelpers cracked it up to be. My boyfriend and I arrived here around 11:45am on a Monday, so the pizza by the slice was piping hot and ready to be served up. We wanted to try the Sicilian after reading the reviews that their thin crust was just a-ok. I was disappointed to see that you couldn't get any of the pizza by the slice with any toppings, so we had to settle for cheese. It was good, don't get me wrong, but it wasn't anything... special. The crust had a great flavor to it and was airy, the sauce was flavorful and tomatoey, and the cheese was your standard mozzarella. The service was friendly at the window, and the atmosphere was alright, it's pretty much exactly what you'd expect from the pictures.I'd probably take my Brooklyn pizza ventures elsewhere.",3.0
"Been coming here for decades.  Great pizza, heros, Italian ices, ice cream, spumoni, atmosphere and prices.  The inside sitdown restaurant is good too.  A Brooklyn Tradition!",5.0
"I first started coming to this place in 1997.  It WAS much better back then.  Since the original owners sold it, the pieces have gotten a lot smaller and the service sucks!  Not worth the money  and they're too close to a C rating for me (they have a B right now).  I definitely won't be back!  House of Pizza on Union Street (between Columbia and Hicks) serves a similar pizza and the BEST calzones you'll ever have in your life!  Go there instead.",1.0
over rated but fun for a visit and people watching,1.0
"Some of the best sicilian pizza in Brooklyn. The sauce is pretty acidic but amazing and the cheese tucked underneath keeps the dough nice and gooey, a great contrast to a perfectly crunchy bottom. For the full experience, go on a nice, sunny day and sit outside - it feels like you're at the Shore and the guys behind the counter are pretty awesome to watch. Keep it simple though, toppings can cost you a good 30 minutes instead of the 5-10 a regular tray or half-tray will be ready. If you live nearby, be warned that delivery takes FOREVER and the pizza's not nearly as good!!!",5.0
"While at work right now and on some down time I was thinking of my favorite foods in America. When it came to pizza there is absolutely no other contender. Even though it has been a few years since I have had a Sicilian slice from L&B, as soon as I saw the picture I experience euphoric recall. I immediately tasted the sweet sauce, gooey cheese, soft upper crust and deliciously burnt bottom crust. It brought back memories of Sheeps Head bay, Bay Ridge, and Coney island; growing up in the 90's, having L&B on the weekends with my family. I can't even begin to convey the kind of emotional response just seeing a picture of this pizza brought back. It is that good. A must for anyone who has never been there. ....I am even beginning to smell it. New York has never seemed so far away.",5.0
"I'll keep this one short. L&B's is everything that's right with Brooklyn and pizza. There a very few pizza places in NYC have specialty slices that can stand up to the L&B's all mighty Square. \If by some miracle you manage not to completely stuff yourself on pizza, get the ice cream!",5.0
"I was here yesterday and ordered a Sicilian pie. OMG! I can honestly say that Spumoni's makes the best Sicilian in NYC. The tomato sauce, the awesome crust so tasty, slighty burned outer crust,the yummy cheese. I was stuffed after eating two squares of yummy goodness and had to take some home. Can't wait to eat 'em for lunch and reminisce of the great time I had at L& B's. This is A MUST for BROOKLYNITES, & YELPERS TOO!",5.0
"Ok, I've wanted to write my review on L&B or affectionately known, Spumoni Gardens for a longtime. Today I chose a beautiful summer day to drive to my old Brooklyn favorite for a few delicious Sicilian squares and a delectable cup of Spumoni.  As it has been for the last 50 years that I have known this spectacular place, cars were double parked, lines were formed to order and it's as if all of Brooklyn had the same idea as I did.Two glorious pieces of pizza were consumed first. The second square was right out of the oven. Sauce was sweet, olive oil was lightly pooled on top and below the most delicious sauce on the planet was the moist and silky mozzarella cheese melted to perfection! L&B know that the cheese belongs between the dough and sauce not on top of the sauce. This is what allows the crust to be light but crispy on the bottom! Perfection!As for the cup of spumoni I feasted on after wards, a happy ending to say the least!  The spumoni here is creamy but not too creamy, sweet but not to sweet, refreshing with just the right amount of almonds that has you opening up the cup to scoop out the last of this delectable, almost sinful dessert!If your from Brooklyn, you know exactly what I'm talking about!  If your not an haven't been here, this place must be on your lists of places to go in your life! Don't miss this treat!",5.0
We loved this place so much that we came two nights in a row all the way from LIC in Queens (about an hour by subway). The Sicilian Pizza was so good we bought a whole pie the second night to have some to take home. I have never had better Sicilian Pizza in my life. The regular slices were great but the Sicilian was over the top. We tried the pasta dishes the second night and they were good but not exceptional. The spumoni is wonderful as well.,5.0
"I was visiting my friends over in Brooklyn and after a while I blurted out that I hadn't had dinner yet. They decided to take me here since they loved it so much and I could see why. Surprisingly for a Saturday night, it wasn't packed at all and the service was fast and friendly. I loved it. And it didn't hurt that 2 slices with a can was just $6! We got ourselves a table and I immediately dug in. The crust was so crunchy and slightly burnt, just how I like it. The dough wasn't chewy at all considering it was fairly thick. I'm a huge fan of cheese and this pizza had a good amount. The sauce was also just awesome. I may or may not have played a little coy in what I really thought to my friends to not seem like a fat ass but really, the pizza is great. Kinda sucks that it's so far from me or else I'd be here everyday.",4.0

"It's hard to find someone who doesn't love the food at Spumoni Gardens. You will find lots of people who don't like the atmosphere, staff, or lines, but when it comes to the food you just can't deny the goodness that is Spumoni Gardens. The sicilian is amazing. If you like, slightly undercooked dough as I do then you will love this pizza, as the dough at the very top can be a little undercooked and gooey in the most wonderful way. The edges can get a little burnt but somehow even the burnt parts taste wonderful (and I hate burnt crust). The pizza is not heavy as most Sicilian pizzas are, it is as close to perfect as I have ever tasted. I have tried the regular spumoni as well as the pistachio spumoni and do not like either very much. People go nuts for this stuff but am I the only one that doesn't consider this real spumoni??The workers are what you can expect from a Bensonhurst pizzeria. They are loud and rude so check out the menu before you go and be sure to know exactly what you want to avoid getting chewed out for glancing up towards the menu for 10 secs. The atmosphere is crazy and loud in the summer but not in an obnoxious way, for me at least. I have friends who don't like this atmosphere but having lived in Brooklyn when I was a child, that kind of craziness is nostalgic for me. The restaurant is also surprisingly good. The artichoke app is amazing (which I happened to taste when our server ordered one too many and gave one to our table for free), the heroes and rice balls are amazing although the main dishes can be hit or miss. Stick to the francese  and marsala dishes. The servers can be flighty but I've been given free wine and apps on more than one occasion so just be patient and treat them well.",4.0
"I have been going here for about 2 years and i love it. The pizza here is amazing and the gelato is to die for. During the summer they are open pretty late, till about 1 am and during the winter they close at about 11. If you want great pizza go to Spumoni Gardens.",4.0

For some reason I find that the pizza is always better then eating inside for what reason I do not know it all comes from the same place. The service inside is terrible and the other dishes are ok nothing to rave about ... so pretty much just stick to the square slices and you'll be more than happy!!!",5.0

"No Sleep Till.....Brooklyn!!!!  I've been meaning to try L & B Spumoni Gardens and today was the perfect pre-spring day to enjoy this famous Brooklyn fare.  We dined outside on the picnic tables and scarfed up the insanely delicious Square pie, a 12 slice pie from the Heavens.  Crispy, chewy, yummy sauce on top.  We tried the round pie as well, adding sausage.  Thin and crispy, as it should be.  The sausage was better than the standard sausage topping you experience on most pizzas.  House made? Not sure but it was damn good!  We took the leftovers from that bad-boy home.  I'll have to fight for them for a future lunch I'm sure.  Because yours truly was so psyched about the Square pie, we took home a 12 slice pie as well.  We drove about 45 minutes so I figured this justified my gluttony!

This restaurant has excellent food and service.  They have awesome sicilian slices where the cheese is on the bottom and the sauce is on top.  Their chef's menu (family style) is delicious.  They customize what your group wants to eat.  I highly recommend this restaurant to my friends & family.,5.0

"Many are called , few are chosen""...the absolute ""Gold Standard"" among square pies. to compare this to any other (legitimate) square is like comparing Petrus to $50 Cabernet's.This is a pie that is ""Sui generis"".A must stop in the borough.

"After walking around Brooklyn looking at the pretty Christmas lights, my boyfriend and I were hungry and decided to make a trip here at 11 at night. We had seen this pizza on TV shows and immediately said we had to try it one day. We had already eaten a big meal earlier that night but we didn't care, bring on the pizza!We went inside and there were actually a good amount of people waiting for pizza at the counter. I was a little confused at how the ordering system went. There was one spot where people were going to order whole pies and then other people were just standing around. I asked one employee where do I order and he barely understood what I was asking, so he asked someone else and that guy told me just to wait until a new pie came out. So we waited patiently for the fresh pie to come out to place my order.While waiting, the man who didn't speak much English warmed up a square slice that was sitting out for us to have for free, so nice of him! I guess he felt bad that he didn't understand what I asked him earlier. He even cut it in half for us to share.We ordered 6 slices to go to bring some home for my parents. We couldn't wait to eat them so we sat in the car and ate it. Wow, so good! The taste was different from the slice that was warmed up to the fresh one. Definitely worth the wait for a pie that is freshly coming out of the oven. The crust is perfectly crispy on the bottom and the dough is airy and so good, the cheese and sweet sauce top it off perfectly. I felt like I was in pizza heaven! My parents even enjoyed it after it got cold from the ride to Brooklyn back to Queens. We had a slice left over and I warmed it up the next day in the toaster over and it still tasted good!

"My mom wanted to go to a good old fashioned Brooklyn Italian joint while in town.  I happened to hear about this place on Top Chef awhile back, and a couple co-workers recommended it so I decided to take the long ass train ride from Queens to Bay Ridge to take my folks here.  In short, it was exactly as I expected it:  Family owned and operated for 70 years, hearty portions,  reasonable prices, where the locals eat, tacky decor, and yummy food.  The three of us shared a Cesar salad ($8) which was a perfect starter salad portion to share between 3-4 people.  The lettuce was definitely fresh, and the dressing was exceptional.  I've never tasted a dressing so thick in my life - almost like melted cheese.Dad got oven baked lasagna ($13) A generous portion with clear layers of tasty sauce, sausage, and ricotta.  Mom and I split a portion of Linguini with Vodka sauce.    Between the two of us we couldn't finish it.  I was looking for something creamy, but was also in love with the idea of a tomato sauce, so it was the perfect marriage of both.  Spicy and sweet with lots of mushrooms, it was fantastic.  As I said, the Decor is Family Italian tacky.  That kind of tacky that says ""This place is the bomb.  Eat here""  Most of the others in the joint seemed like regular patrons who know the menu like the back of their hand and come back again and again (for good reason)  The service proved to be an issue.  I'll preface this by saying we got there at a bad time as two large parties (the smaller of the the two was about 25 folks) were just getting in so the wait staff was rather stretched.  But, it did take nearly 5 minutes before anyone came to say hello and every bit of service we got the whole time we were there seemed like a side thought (as in ""Here's your food.  Hope you like it.  I've got bigger fish to fry."") We paid the bill, then ran out to get some of this famous Spumoni.  In short, the spumoni is the shit.  Yep.  That's all I can really say.  It's DAMN GOOD.  $2.25 for a small is all you really need after a hearty lunch.  All in all, this is a great ""establishment"" restaurant whose food lives up to it's esteem.  However, the lackluster service makes you feel like an outsider if you don't weigh 350lbs, or have 4inch red lacquer nails and a perm.  Great food, go if you are in the area.",3.0

"O.K.  after getting the squares for past couple years here im saying they are great...but my first sit down dinner here  was rather disappointing...the service was shoddy , customers seated after my fiancee and i were served before us.Maybe it was an off night but that sucked for me because i heard such great things the food here...but it blew and i still had to pay.Now for the stuff we ate,  a salty as hell ceasar salad with store dressing im sure,  an app of meatball parm which was the highlight of the dinner and a order of spag and meatballs which was shared because of the huge portions.  The sauce was like tomato water and the meatballs were dry as sawdust.",1.0

I tried their Sicilian slices for $2.50 each. It's okay. I had much better at Gino's on 18 Avenue which is now closed. The slice has a lot of sauce on the top and it taste very sweet. The bread taste too soft and doughy. I much prefer thinner crust. I am still on a search for the best Sicilian slice.,3.0
"I don't understand the hype. I definitely had better pizza's in other pizzerias in Brooklyn. Hubby and I decided to try the restaurant and go for a sit down dinner.

"Decided to give this place a shot Friday. I stopped by on the the way home from work. I got there around 6:00pm. I was expecting a long line but surprisingly there wasn't any. I walked into the takeout section, and ordered a half pie squares. I was expecting to wait a few mintues when the counter guy turns around and grabs a pie from the top of the stove. I noticed there were over a dozen pies boxed and ready to go just sitting on top of the oven. As he was bringing the premade pie to the counter I glanced over and saw a fresh pie being placed into the box. I pointed to that pie and asked if I can have that pie. The counter guy pointed to the premade box and said this is the same. I touched the top of the box and it felt warm, not hot. I was in a rush and not in a mood to start my weekend off arguing over a pie. I paid the  20 bux and went home.By the time I got home, the pie was slightly warm and not hot, ( I only live 10 minute drive)  So the luke warm square was tasty. the sauce was sweet and the bottom was crispy. So if you want a hot pie, go later in the evening when they'll be serving fresh out of the oven pies and not ones they've premade.nothing like the wait for a FRESH HOT PIE from DiFara's",3.0

I asked if I was going to get a replacement because I paid for something that only had one bite taken out of it. They didn't appear to be in any hurry to do such a thing, but muttered that yes, they were getting me a replacement.

"It's too bad that this place is so far away!!!  Visited this place for a family vacation, after seeing an episode featuring it on Man vs. Food :)  We were there on a Tuesday afternoon, during an odd hour, which meant there was no waiting!  Everything we ordered was really good, and I have to say, I know that everyone raves about the Sicilian Square, which was definitely yummy, but the MEATBALL SANDWICH was soooo delicious!  I thought about it nearly everyday that I was in NY!  The unexpected delight was the calamari!  Such a fair price for a mountain of perfectly made calamari rings!  The outside was crisp, while the squid, itself, was absolutely tender, not overcooked, or rubbery/tough!  We ordered it as an afterthought after seeing a bunch of other tables devouring it.  By the time it came, I was pretty much full, but I still managed to pig out on it.  We couldn't finish it, and it was the ""small,"" and so I had it wrapped up, thinking ""Too bad this won't be as good later..."" -Flash Forward- Hours later: Is that a rumble in my tummy?  Break these bad boys out, and goodness gracious, what a great surprise!  Still tasty!  Even though it was cold, and (sniffle) the breading was no longer crunchy, it still hit the spot!If I'm ever in New York again, you can bet I'll be back at this place.  *My only complaint is that I did not enjoy the spumoni...I know, that's totally ironic.  It was a bit freezer burned...but that aside, since I was really there for the grub, not for the dessert, I had to give it 5 stars.  The price was fair, and the food was good.  If you decide to dine in their outdoor patio, and order from the window, the food is priced less than inside the actual restaurant :)...we ate in because it was chilly, but on a nice, warm, sunny day, it would be perfect!",5.0
"Spumoni Gardens invented a different kind of pizza! I live in SF Bay area and from time to time I'm trying to explain what's so special about L&B, and even though I can't, I'll give it a shot anyway.It's like half deep dish, and three quarter awesomeness.. It stays crusty while being the juiciest pizza you ever had.. it's salty while it's sweet.. It's sauce perfection and they wouldn't put so much of it if they weren't so confident in it's excellence.. It's something you will never understand till you try it, and then have it at least three more times so your tongue will have enough time to comprehend what just passed by. I hart thin crust more than deep dish but this hybrid throws me in a loop every time I have it. It's too bad that so many people will never know how good pizza can get since both Spumoni Gardens and my all time favorite thin crust (Di Fara) are both in a remote part of Brooklyn and most people wont bother going that far for a slice. I always liked pizza a lot, but only after I had L&B and Di Fara I completely fell in love with her.",5.0

"It's too bad that this place is so far away!!!  Visited this place for a family vacation, after seeing an episode featuring it on Man vs. Food :)  We were there on a Tuesday afternoon, during an odd hour, which meant there was no waiting!  Everything we ordered was really good, and I have to say, I know that everyone raves about the Sicilian Square, which was definitely yummy, but the MEATBALL SANDWICH was soooo delicious!  I thought about it nearly everyday that I was in NY!  The unexpected delight was the calamari!  Such a fair price for a mountain of perfectly made calamari rings!  The outside was crisp, while the squid, itself, was absolutely tender, not overcooked, or rubbery/tough!  We ordered it as an afterthought after seeing a bunch of other tables devouring it.  By the time it came, I was pretty much full, but I still managed to pig out on it.  We couldn't finish it, and it was the ""small,"" and so I had it wrapped up, thinking ""Too bad this won't be as good later..."" -Flash Forward- Hours later: Is that a rumble in my tummy?  Break these bad boys out, and goodness gracious, what a great surprise!  Still tasty!  Even though it was cold, and (sniffle) the breading was no longer crunchy, it still hit the spot!If I'm ever in New York again, you can bet I'll be back at this place.  *My only complaint is that I did not enjoy the spumoni...I know, that's totally ironic.  It was a bit freezer burned...but that aside, since I was really there for the grub, not for the dessert, I had to give it 5 stars.  The price was fair, and the food was good.  If you decide to dine in their outdoor patio, and order from the window, the food is priced less than inside the actual restaurant :)...we ate in because it was chilly, but on a nice, warm, sunny day, it would be perfect!",5.0
"Spumoni Gardens invented a different kind of pizza! I live in SF Bay area and from time to time I'm trying to explain what's so special about L&B, and even though I can't, I'll give it a shot anyway.It's like half deep dish, and three quarter awesomeness.. It stays crusty while being the juiciest pizza you ever had.. it's salty while it's sweet.. It's sauce perfection and they wouldn't put so much of it if they weren't so confident in it's excellence.. It's something you will never understand till you try it, and then have it at least three more times so your tongue will have enough time to comprehend what just passed by. I hart thin crust more than deep dish but this hybrid throws me in a loop every time I have it. It's too bad that so many people will never know how good pizza can get since both Spumoni Gardens and my all time favorite thin crust (Di Fara) are both in a remote part of Brooklyn and most people wont bother going that far for a slice. I always liked pizza a lot, but only after I had L&B and Di Fara I completely fell in love with her.",5.0
"The Sicilian slice was simple magnificent pleasure. I came all the way from central Jersey on the recommendation of a colleague. And the Sicilian slice was worth it. Am not too sure about the regular slice. If I wasn't travelling by train, I would take a full box home. This was in Winter, so indoor seating area being bigger would have got it 5 stars.

"I started eating my piece of pizza before I even got away from the window. My dad, a New York native for 60 years, knows the good places. An easy place to get to from Coney Island.

"I don't know if we came on an off day, but it was a Thursday at 2pm the restaurant was empty. We asked for a half tray of Sicilian. It came out really quickly however, it was literally raw dough in the middle. It felt sort of like soft chewing gum, you know the kind that is really watery when you first start chewing it.  We called the waiter over and showed him and he brought out a fresh, hot one directly from the oven. It was only slightly better.  Still had a layer of uncooked dough. Hmmmm..not sure what people are raving about.

"My friend and I had both been meaning to check this place out for some time. Having been to almost all of NYC's pizza havens, when I saw Adam Richman plugging this supposed gem out in Gravesend, I knew I had to check it out.On arrival, things looked good. There was private parking, outdoor seating, and a crowd of seemingly satisfied customers, many of whom were NYC public employees on their lunch breaks. This was promising, for who would be a better judge of New York's finest...than New York's finest?As we approached the window, a young man placed a piping hot square sicilian pie on the counter before us, precisely the pie about which Richman had boasted so ""Adamantly"" on his heavily syndicated ""Man v. Food.""  So, excitedly my friend and I forked over twelve bucks for four slices and two sodas and took our seats in the shade. To Richman's credit, the slices looked every bit as good as they did on the show, but that's where our praise ends.  The taste was simply unremarkable. Had I not had such high expectations, I would have appreciated it as I would any other average slice; however, this slice was not supposed to be average. The slice's composition was unconventional but a welcomed departure from the norm, at least in appearance.  There was a lot of sauce (which I tend to like) and a crisp, airy crust with a thin layer of mozzarella beneath the sauce and sparse sprinkles of parm' to top it off.  On paper it sounds great, but in execution the flavors simply didn't sing to me.  There was no grand symphony,  nothing exploded in my mouth, and I had no inclination to return for seconds.  To say I was disappointed would be a gross understatement, as there was absolutely nothing memorable or even noteworthy about L&B's pizza.This is minor league pizza whose mention does not belong in a conversation about the greats.",2.0

I used to really love the pizza here. Obviously something has changed...I ordered a half tray and to my surprise. The outside was totally burnt and somehow...the middle was raw. The pie was all sauce and no mozzarella. What's up with all the grated cheese?? Gross.,2.0
"This pizza joint is absolutely delicious. Stopped by here after the color run in Brooklyn and would definitely make a trip out to Brooklyn again JUST for this pizza! I got the regular pie and shared among friends. I definitely ate the most among my friends and more! If you're around the area, definitely stop by and ENJOY!",5.0
"Trecked to spumoni gardens during rush hour from queens.  Was it worth it? YES...the pizza is definitely a unique taste, sweet sauce, cheese under sauce to keep the bread from getting soggy and nice crispy crust.A little pricey for a small square slice but worth it.  I ate three slices there and got four to go....needless to say I ate two more when I got home.  I'll be back, definitely recommend.Side note: while I was there it was fairly busy, one dude was all the way from NJ....it's good but idk if it's THAT good to pay the tolls to get there from jersey lol",5.0
"AMAZING! I have been coming here for years and always left happy and fulfilled. The staff is very nice; just about all the waiters remember me. Their square slices, Caesar salad, baked clams, and chicken sorrento are amazingly delicious. I can't get enough of this place. They always make awesome desserts which I can't say no to. I will be a customer for life!",5.0

"BEST CLASSIC SQUARE PIZZA EVERRR!! but, with a little classy twist -- crispy crust, with a fluffy bed of cheese and a vibrant red blanket of tomato sauce ON TOP. and just as a disclaimer: the sauce is far beyond from anything like marinara. i'm truly grateful that L&B is a mere 5-minute drive from my bf's place as it has become a frequent option for lunch/dinner. i don't even have to call ahead of time, because the turnover is so high. the pies are always guaranteed fresh and steaming hot. the crustless center squares are the perfect slice of geometric food heaven. just writing about it puts me on cloud nine...",5.0

"This place is something you have to experience.  There is an indoor section with a waitstaff I believe, but we opted for the huge outdoor section.  The outdoor area is full of tables and benches to sit at and there are 3 different areas to order food.  The half-Sicilian is amazing and is plenty of pizza for 2 people... probably would've fed 4 people.  Their spumoni was also delicious, but the rainbow has a lot more pistachio than I was expecting.  Overall, really great experience although I wish they had a few more options in sodas.",4.0

I have to admit I was tricked by Man v. Food host Adam Richman into coming here. This place is nothing great. Don't bother. It's way out of the way if you're visiting Manhattan and its not worth the subway ride. Their famous Sicilian squares aren't as great as Adam described. The sauce is way too sweet for me.

"One of the best Sicilian slices in the city, all. 5 boroughs. L&B has been serving up Brooklyn for years. The upside down Sicilian slice. He'll yea I'm a fan. Great dough, sauce, and cheese. That's it , simple! I hear they have great spumoni as well. Time to go back and check it out.",5.0
"I love this place! When you are craving a square pizza, Spumoni is the place to visit. Of course their other foods like pastas, salads, etc are to die for, my favorites are their squares. The best thing is that there is hardly a wait for their pizza. On the other hand, there is a wait to sit down and eat in their restaurant, but it's worth the wait. Don't get me started on their Spumoni ice! Its like heaven in a cup!  If you ever want to celebrate a birthday in a restaurant, I would recommend celebrating it there. My reason is because they have family sized sundaes that consist of a tower of spumoni and other delicious flavors of ices. If this helps, my Aunt travels from Pennsylvania to get 3 trays of their squares to take home. (I think that should tell you something!) The only down side to this place is that its so good that it is always packed and the restaurant is fairly small. Other than that, they get 2 thumbs up from me :)",5.0

"One of THE HANDS DOWN best takes on a Square Sicilian Slice you'll find on the PLANET. Sometimes you drive by and decide you want just one slice. But you walk up to the window a great ol tray of pizza and before you know it you're sitting at one of their benches, the sun shining on your face, and you've got 3 big hot slices covered in sauce and parmesean staring you in the stomach. Then you get up to waddle to your car in their parking lot, which is almost always full but at least they have one, and out of the corner of your eye you see a small child with the biggest grin on their face. You turn around and they are OM NOM NOMing some Strawberry Spumoni. Well now that did it and the next thing you know you've got a cone of creamy goodness in one hand and a pre-packed quart in the other.

"Their Sicilian pizza should be illegal because it's crack. You can't just eat one. Seriously. I dare you.The first time I came here was on our way to Brighton beach.

Most recently, I came after running a 5K at Coney Island with the Wildlife Conservation Society to save turtles! After the run, they had the usual bananas, yogurt, apples and grapes, but we wanted something more to celebrate our run. L&B doesn't open until 11am on Sundays so we had to kill some time at the Aquarium (the Sea Lion show is amazing!). We left around 10:30 and took the orange line two stops to Avenue X. Although the yellow line station is a lot closer to L&B so I recommend you take that instead. It was approximately a 10min walk from the orange line station. We each got a slice of the Sicilian, but had to get seconds because it's so derish. I prefer the corner slice and middle slice combo when ordering. The crust is so crunchy and reminds me of the edges of lasagna and the center pieces are so soft and saucy. Absolutely amazing combination.After our meal, we split a Rainbow spumoni (vanilla, chocolate and pistachio). It was pretty good but not as amazing as the pizza. Some bites tasted a little too artificial and a good portion of it was icy and not as creamy (kinda like when you leave ice cream in the freezer for too long!).

"L & B Spumoni Gardens is a Should Eat. It is the best Sicilian slice of pizza you will ever have, we promise. It is worth the drive and the wait any time of year.  Some quick tips when eating at Spumoni, 1. have part of your group secure a table while the other half orders the pizza. 2. Order more slices than you expect to eat, you will thank us. 3. Get napkins it can get messy especially when eating the middle slices with no crust.

One slice of sicilian was delicious (and probably enough), but the traditional marinara was excellent as well. I live right near grimaldi's but I think the travel to Spumoni is worth it - offers a unique experience and pizza thats not your boring traditional italian pizza.",5.0
"It's nice to sit outside on a summer evening, enjoying a good square and spumoni. L&B makes a pretty good square. Perhaps even a very good square. The crust is tasty, the sauce is tangy, the sprinkling of cheese is nice. However, while it is enjoyable, it does not blow me away. There's not much else to say about the L&B expereince.",3.0
"after hearing the Met's John Franco brag about this pizza, I had to trek out to Brooklyn to try it. Definitely distinct. The squares remind me a bit of the old Pizza City in Howard Beach.",4.0
If we're just talking about food this place is hands down 5 stars. The pizza here is f**ing amazing. The silkiness of the melted cheese on top of the perfectly chewy dough on top of a perfectly crunchy crust. A sweet layer of amazing sauce on top it all! However the place looks like a dump inside so I'll give it 4 stars. A Brooklyn institution none the less !,4.0

"L & B Spumoni Gardens is a Should Eat. It is the best Sicilian slice of pizza you will ever have, we promise. It is worth the drive and the wait any time of year.  Some quick tips when eating at Spumoni, 1. have part of your group secure a table while the other half orders the pizza. 2. Order more slices than you expect to eat, you will thank us. 3. Get napkins it can get messy especially when eating the middle slices with no crust.

"Continuing along our previously determined route - 2 persons per car - our next stop would be one of the oldest in Brooklyn - L&B Spumoni Gardens.  Having heard of this space from some local friends in the past but having never seen it mentioned on a ""best of"" list (actually, most of what I'd heard was quite negative aside from two glowing recommendations of the namesake Spumoni) I went into the experience with modest expectations - expectations seemingly warranted by the rather unkempt clientele (think track suits and fake-gold chains) and gaudy exterior (think  neon lights).....plus Steve 1's statement that he wanted to bring us here as a ""contrast"" to DiFara's - and that he wasn't going to order any pizza.More a full-fledged eatery than DiFara's or the other spaces on our trip, the first thing I noted when entering the non-pizza half of L&B was the smell - it wasn't ""bad"" but it reminded me of the ketchup factory near where I grew up - not a good sign since I saw spaghetti sauce and not a Heinz bottle.  Following Steve 1's lead and first ordering a small spumoni for a little over $2 I have to admit that although I'm pretty sure there was nothing artisan about the ingredients or organic about the colors this was some tasty ice cream - a bit more icy than creamy but absolutely loaded with faux-pistachio flavor, buttery almond/vanilla, and Hershey's kisses tasting chocolate.Making our way next door where Steve 2 and Laura had already taken a seat I was greeted by a burly smiling fellow serving up slices and when I ordered a single slice he gifted me a second for free as there were only two left in the pan - a nice gesture, even if it would turn out to be wasted.  Taking a seat and subsequently a bite I instantly noted the previously ""contrast"" - this square slice was pretty terrible.  With a doughy crust not terribly different from the frozen sort you'd expect from Costco topped with a sort of briny and bland sauce and grated parmesan plus what was undoubtedly bagged mozzarella (perhaps from Costco?)  the only fair comparison I can make is to the square slices served up at Little Caesars in Joe Louis Arena when I was a child...a pizza I never really liked, but a pizza I always finished due to the excessive arena price and a pizza I'll always remember due to the location.  Unfortunately (or perhaps fortunately?) for L&B the price was bargain basement so I had no trouble placing the second slice in the trash before leaving the memorable (for better or worse?) location.",2.0

L&B is a Brooklyn institution. Go! Go NOW!",5.0
"This was my third trip to L&B Spumoni Gardens. In 2008, FEEP (fellow enthusiast for eating pizza) Jr. and I did an outer boro pizza tour. We made a stop at Spumoni Gardens for a slice of their square pie and a conventional triangle slice from the round pie.  About a year ago, I returned with EPBAC (eats pizza but avoids cheese) and again sampled both the square pie and a conventional triangle slice. Based on those two experiences, I safely concluded that the round pie was forgettable. The square didn't blow me away either, but based on the reviews of pizza bloggers more expert than I, it was an easy decision on a hot August afternoon to stop in and try again en route from Dyker Heights to JFK.Here is some background, excerpted from their website: ""Here we are known for our Famous Sicilian Pizza, Home made Spumoni, and outside seating. Ludovico Barbati came into the United States back in 1917, from Torella Di Lombardi, Italy. In 1938 Ludovico learned from a baker how to make Spumoni and Ices, in a little garage on West 8th Street, Brooklyn New York. He sold his products up and down the streets of Gravesend & Bensonhurst, Brooklyn. In 1939, Ludovico, Sr. decided he needed a little, inexpensive place to make the Spumoni and Ices, so he purchased vacant property on 86th street in Brooklyn. In the mid 1950's L & B Spumoni Gardens built the second building, which is now the Pizzeria, selling our famous thick Sicilian pies, as well as our regular round pies. L & B Spumoni Gardens is now in its fourth generation. There will always be a family member to greet you at our doors.""Nice stuff! Let me translate that last sentence: ""There will always be a family member to bark at you if you hesitate when you order.""  That is not a complaint! In fact, the brusque attytood of the window staff is part of L&B's charm. The place is huge by pizza joint standards. There is a separate window to order pizza and a window for spumoni and Italian ices.I ordered two square slices, and I was happy that I did not get a center sans-cornicione piece. I got one standard border slice that had a single crusty edge, and a corner piece with two crispy edges. Upon visual inspection, it is abundantly clear that this is not pizza, deep-dish pizza, or Sicilian pizza. Yes, it has a thick Sicilian-style crust, but the cheese is a mere dusting of some aged finely grated cheese, probably Parmesan. This, folks, is what we call tomato pie in Conshohocken PA (and at Wegman's market).For a cheeseless pie, the sauce should shine. This sauce was nice, but it gets smoked by the sauce at Marzano's in Exton PA, where the sauces sits atop the cheese in the uniquely Pennsylvanian ""upside down pizza"" style. In fact, this sauce was no better than the thick rich red gravy that sits on the five buck tomato pie from Wegman's. Those who praise the L&B square pie talk most about the crust. Crisp, airy, crunchy. It was all that. Starting with its perfectly browned bottom, above that is a layer that is puffy like good Italian bread, then above that is a layer that is dense and moist (probably from the sauce). Texture-wise, this is pretty good. Better than the light airy crust at Marzano's, and with a tad more flavor than the Wegman's tomato pie.I have to conclude about this square pie what I've concluded about tomato pie in general: if you grew up eating it, it must be pretty special. If you discover it as an adult, it's a fine snack but at the end of the day it's a pretty good pizza with the cheese missing. I'm glad that there are places like this, but I think the whole look and feel -- window ordering, outdoor seating, spumoni for dessert -- makes this place more an experience than an epicurean event (same can be said for Pat's or Geno's Cheesesteaks on Passyunk Avenue in Philly). You go for the ambiance, not so much for the food.I love ice cream, I like spumoni but there are a lot of places selling some crappy stuff they call gelati or spumoni but which aren't as good as supermarket ice cream. I'm happy to report that the spumoni at L&B was wonderful. I loved their take on ""Neapolitan"" in which they substitute pistachio for strawberry. And they scoop it from three different drums!  The vanilla, chocolate, and pistachio products were the perfect soft texture (though they began to melt faster than I could eat & photograph). The small cup of spumoni was the same price as a square slice: $2.25. Nice value.How does it all stack up?  Based on my two past experiences, I rate the round pie a 5. Not bad, but not distinctive in any way. The square pie rates higher. I think I can go up to 7. The spumoni is a 9.5!  Loved it. This is a fine institution and I encourage you to stop by if you are in the area OR if you are a big fan of tomato pie. But for me, it's not destination pizza.I am Pizza Quixote!",3.0

"How anyone can give this place less than 5 stars, I seriously don't know...The square pie here is so good that my minimum is three each time I go, and this is coming from a dude who generally knows his limits.

Its savory, tangy, sweet and garlicky all in one. Simply amazing.  The soft doughy middle of a slice is usually juxtaposed by a crunchy charred crust...again, amazing.

"Absolutely amazing Sicicilian style pizza. You look at the pie (square pie that is) when it comes out and it's fairly intimidating. It's a good 1""-1"" 1/2 thick with aggresive crust and smothered in sauce. When you actually bite into it though...magical. The crust is as light and flaky as philo dough and the sauce...oh my lord the sauce is unebleivable. Light, bright with just a little acid and sweetness from the San Marzano tomatoes. In fact, the only reason why this isn't a perfect 5 stars is the service was dreadfully slow. Other than that...top 3 pizzas I've ever eaten.",4.0
"The parking lot is to the left of Spumoni. There is a nice, big seating area in the front, and there is also indoor seating. This place is fast! I parked, went inside, ordered half a box of Sicilian, got the box instantly (it was still steaming hot), and got back into the car within five minutes. I kid you not! The Sicilian half pie has 12 slices - that is enough to feed about 6 people, more or less depending how hungry you are. I ate 3 slices =). The crust was thick and crunchy. There was a thin layer of cheese and the sauce was full-bodied and amazing. There were a bunch of italian spices and it had a fresh tomato flavor. The peculiar thing about Spumoni is that they put their pizza sauce on top of the cheese. The only downfall of the pie was that the immediate layers beneath the cheese were getting pretty soggy, because they box the pie right after they make it. But, the thick crust prevented that from being a huge issue. Nice, satisfying pizza!",4.0

"""The best service I received tonight was from my neighbor!""So said the guy sitting on the table diagonally across mine. After exclaiming repeatedly to having been there for more than three hours, he had developed quite a sympathetic audience of diners. The straw that broke his back was seeing a server walk past him to serve dessert at the table next to his. ""Hey, isn't that mine?"" he challenged the waiter who turned away without responding to him. The beneficiary of the dessert got up, and instead offered it to him. ""Here, take it. No worries."" The gentleman in me hoped that the recipient would at the least thank his benefactor, but perhaps his patience had been stretched beyond limit for all he could do was laugh and mutter, ""Man, It seems I am in the Twilight zone. Nothing is going right, tonight!""He wasn't the only one who had suffered bad service at L&B that night. Upon entering the family owned establishment now in its 69th year of operations, packed with families or teenagers on dates, I was completely ignored by the 8 or so servers roaming around. Even though one managed to elbow me, not a single one stopped and asked me whether I needed a table. When I blocked one of them and asked to be seated, he nodded but disappeared to attend to another table. After standing for 6 minutes or so (having come all the way to Bensonhurst, I was determined to eat and review!!) one of the members of the Barbati family finally came up to inquire whether I was being attended to. So, let me say it in a language the servers can understand: el servicio chupa!Going back to the food, I confess that I am not a fan of Sicilian pizza with its thick French bread like crust. I find it heavier than my preferred pizza option of Neapolitan style pizza, or otherwise the thin crust one. That said, as opposed to the dense, tough concrete bricks of an excuse for Sicilian pizza that you get in other establishments, the square slice here is far superior: a light and crunchy crust, airy middle, coated with minimal mozzarella and THEN topped with a tangy tomato sauce. I would say: Best in class, but in a category that I don't really care much about!As for the famous Spumoni (vanilla, chocolate and pistachio), if it weren't for the ghastly Kelly green, and nuts, I would've had a hard time figuring out that the flavor was indeed Pistachio! And, chocolate, really?! That was chocolate?! Conceptually, I would think that Spumoni, predecessor to the Neapolitan ice cram is a wonderful dessert: molded Italian ice cream with layers of different flavors and colors and a fruit and nut layer to add texture and complexity. However, it would appear that the Spumoni at L&B still avails the same food coloring, and essences, that the founder Ludovico Barbati used in 1939! 12 slices of pizza, a Spumoni, and bottled water left me with a bill of $26.40.

"Like many others, I first heard about L&B on Man vs Food.  Then I went on Yelp, and there were so many people who were raving about how good the Sicilian pizza was.  Now I'll tell you about MY experience, and why I thought the square pizza was fabulous as well.I always want to know, WHY is something so good, and what makes it so different from other versions of the same dish?  After all, you can get pizza anywhere.  The best way that I can describe the difference between an L&B Sicilian slice and those of others is comparable to the difference between a beignet and a donut.  When I first bit into the inch thick pizza, I was expecting it to be flavorful, but a bit heavy and very filling.  To my surprise, the pizza was so delectably fluffy and light, and of course, super flavorful, with the perfect bite to the crust.  YUMMM!!We also tried the famous spumoni ice cream, as well as the strawberry ice cream.  If I could get the flavor of the spumoni ice cream with the smooth consistency of the strawberry ice cream, it would have been ice cream perfection.  The spumoni was good, and specifically, the pistachio ice cream was the shining star, with bits of pistachio nut in the ice cream.  But consistency wise, it was too bubbly creamy for me (I prefer the smooth creaminess of Haagen Dazs ice cream).  The service was terrible.  When we walked in, the hostess (and all of the waiters walking by), completely ignored us for like 5 minutes.  Then, they never checked in on us to take our orders, refill our drinks, or give us our check.  We had to flag down our waiter for every little thing we needed.  I'd recommend just getting the square pizza to go and eating it outside so you don't have to deal with the wait staff.",4.0
I don't know what all these reviewers are eating.  L&B is no longer a great pizza place.

"The corner of a Sicilian slice followed by a spumoni in a paper cup. It's the only reason to ever come here. The restaurant part is small and chaotic, but the food never disappoints.

"""The best service I received tonight was from my neighbor!""So said the guy sitting on the table diagonally across mine. After exclaiming repeatedly to having been there for more than three hours, he had developed quite a sympathetic audience of diners. The straw that broke his back was seeing a server walk past him to serve dessert at the table next to his. ""Hey, isn't that mine?"" he challenged the waiter who turned away without responding to him. The beneficiary of the dessert got up, and instead offered it to him. ""Here, take it. No worries."" The gentleman in me hoped that the recipient would at the least thank his benefactor, but perhaps his patience had been stretched beyond limit for all he could do was laugh and mutter, ""Man, It seems I am in the Twilight zone. Nothing is going right, tonight!""He wasn't the only one who had suffered bad service at L&B that night. Upon entering the family owned establishment now in its 69th year of operations, packed with families or teenagers on dates, I was completely ignored by the 8 or so servers roaming around. Even though one managed to elbow me, not a single one stopped and asked me whether I needed a table. When I blocked one of them and asked to be seated, he nodded but disappeared to attend to another table. After standing for 6 minutes or so (having come all the way to Bensonhurst, I was determined to eat and review!!) one of the members of the Barbati family finally came up to inquire whether I was being attended to. So, let me say it in a language the servers can understand: el servicio chupa!Going back to the food, I confess that I am not a fan of Sicilian pizza with its thick French bread like crust. I find it heavier than my preferred pizza option of Neapolitan style pizza, or otherwise the thin crust one. That said, as opposed to the dense, tough concrete bricks of an excuse for Sicilian pizza that you get in other establishments, the square slice here is far superior: a light and crunchy crust, airy middle, coated with minimal mozzarella and THEN topped with a tangy tomato sauce. I would say: Best in class, but in a category that I don't really care much about!As for the famous Spumoni (vanilla, chocolate and pistachio), if it weren't for the ghastly Kelly green, and nuts, I would've had a hard time figuring out that the flavor was indeed Pistachio! And, chocolate, really?! That was chocolate?! Conceptually, I would think that Spumoni, predecessor to the Neapolitan ice cram is a wonderful dessert: molded Italian ice cream with layers of different flavors and colors and a fruit and nut layer to add texture and complexity. However, it would appear that the Spumoni at L&B still avails the same food coloring, and essences, that the founder Ludovico Barbati used in 1939! 12 slices of pizza, a Spumoni, and bottled water left me with a bill of $26.40. As the waiter (who had earlier expected me to butter the complimentary bread with my fork, and not knife) came back to collect the cash he inquired whether I needed any change back from my $40. I made sure that he saw the bill, before commenting that even he couldn't possibly expect that the service merited a 50% tip. Or, indeed a return trip...",2.0

"This is more than an italian eatery; it's an experience. At this legendary landmark you will find what Brooklyn is all about. If you are one of these people that shy away from local color and are only comfortable around transplants, then this isn't for you. You got kids running around hopped up on dessert. You might see two guys engaged in a stare down competition over who is wearing a better gold chain. If you saw this place on the show Man vs. Food then you might know a little bit of what I'm talking about. First off, it's not a pizza. Don't call it that. It's a square. If you try to categorize it as pizza you are on the wrong track. The sauce is what really stands out and not just because its covered in it. The bread is also thick, soft and doughy. I felt like I could eat about ten of these.When I came here I didn't even know what a spumoni was and I still don't think I know. Is it an icy? Is it ice cream? Both? Whatever it was, it was like crack in a cup. I went with the pistachio and it was so flavorful that I thought it had to be artificial. It was that good. I'm told they make it on the premises and everything they use is the real ingredient. This really is an oasis out in the middle of Gravesend and it's been around since 1939. With the crowds it was drawing and the amount of double parking going on, I can see why.",5.0

"I had no idea pizza could  be so delicious! I've never been to Italy, but this just has to be the closest thing to getting a true Sicilian pizza. My uncles were ranting and raving about this place for months so they finally decided to prove it to me. Mind you, I was very skeptical seeing as everything they raved about before was always overhyped and never met my expectations. Spumoni Gardens definitely met my expectations and then some! The 2 lines (one for slices only and the other for whole pies) were stretched out across the parking lot and now I see why! We got one pizza pie and, at first glance, all I could think of was ""what the hell is with all the sauce?? where's the cheese!?!?!?"" I took one bite and fell in love! OMG I wish I listened to them before and came here all the time so I can get my fill of true Sicilian pizza at least twice a week. The slices are HUGE and extremely filling. I had no idea how I managed to eat 2 slices! My uncle has to be a record breaker though! That guy downed 5 slices! And he wanted to buy more! Nuts!

"Nothing screams Brooklyn, Summertime, and Italian more than L&B's. If you are a pizza fan, especially Sicilian slices, be prepared to be blown away. During the summer, nothing beats grabbing a 1/2 tray of Sicilian slices, a spumoni Italian Ice with some of your friends while sitting on the benches in the front of the restaurant. Even though their regular slices are good as well, the Sicilian is what they're known for. Baked to crunchy perfection, topped with light Parmesan cheese and homemade tomato sauce, the Sicilian is hands down one of the best in the city. Just be careful, because sometimes the slices can be over drenched in sauce, so remind the counter to go easy with the sauce on your pie. When you're done chowing down on your Sicilian slices, make sure you grab a homemade Italian Ice as well. I usually get the lemon ice, which literally has lemon seeds in it, which vouches for it's freshness. Best part, everything is affordable, the atmosphere is great and family oriented, and you won't be left disappointed.",4.0
"When reviewing this pizza place you really can't compare it to other establishments because of 2 reasons:1) Spumoni Gardens is in many ways the food version of a mini-shopping center, you have the smaller pizza take-out place with a small sitting area inside, you have the ice cream store next to it and then you have the restaurant. All of this with outdoor seating that allows you to pay for each and then sit. 2) The main attraction here is a type of pizza that is not your typical slice. The signature L&B square has the sauce on top of the cheese, and the sauce has lots of sugar in it making it very sweet and giving it a unique taste not like your other pizza joints.Bottom line is the pizza is fantastic, you can easily eat 5 squares before you begin feeling full. The prices are high for something that may not look so big to you at first, but the taste fully makes up for that. I suggest you sit in their outdoor area to get the full experience.",5.0
"As a pizza aficionado, I will travel great lengths for a good slice. Spumoni Gardens, however, located so far out in Brooklyn that if you took the subway one more stop, you'd literally be swimming in the ocean, is a bit of a trip to nowhere. Located in a relatively depressed neighborhood, the restaurant and the outdoor seating area sprawl for almost an entire block like the neighborhood's playground. The famed pizza tasted a bit like puffy bread sticks doused in marinara sauce, with little sprinkles of grated cheese. I was hoping for a more solid and flavorful pie. And it tasted more like a marinara pie, not really pizza. The pizza purist in me was heartbroken.The appetizers were the restaurant's strongest suit. Roasted artichokes looked too good to eat -- little rosebuds with stems on a plate. Mozzarella in carrozza was my favorite, melted cheese between slivers of bread. Yummiest thing there.The dessert is massive, but the ice cream tasted too much like dyed Italian ices, and was watery.Our server was incredibly accommodating and helpful, and assisted everyone with picking out a dinner special that fit their budget. On the downside, getting back to wherever you had to return to after a filling meal (plus leftovers), was a drag.",3.0
"This is more than an italian eatery; it's an experience. At this legendary landmark you will find what Brooklyn is all about. If you are one of these people that shy away from local color and are only comfortable around transplants, then this isn't for you. You got kids running around hopped up on dessert. You might see two guys engaged in a stare down competition over who is wearing a better gold chain. If you saw this place on the show Man vs. Food then you might know a little bit of what I'm talking about. First off, it's not a pizza. Don't call it that. It's a square. If you try to categorize it as pizza you are on the wrong track. The sauce is what really stands out and not just because its covered in it. The bread is also thick, soft and doughy. I felt like I could eat about ten of these.When I came here I didn't even know what a spumoni was and I still don't think I know. Is it an icy? Is it ice cream? Both? Whatever it was, it was like crack in a cup. I went with the pistachio and it was so flavorful that I thought it had to be artificial. It was that good. I'm told they make it on the premises and everything they use is the real ingredient. This really is an oasis out in the middle of Gravesend and it's been around since 1939. With the crowds it was drawing and the amount of double parking going on, I can see why.",5.0
"Duh-licious, I liked both the standard slice and the big slices. Everyone on here has a long review, I'll just say that I agree with it. Love the oreo-vanilla icing.",4.0

"This place is a little over-hyped. I've had better grandma slices at Rosa's in Queens and Carmine's in Williamsburg. The fact that they offer broccoli rabe as a topping for their heros is a huge plus though. Excellent sausage & peppers! Sadly, some places can't get this right.",3.0
"I had no idea pizza could  be so delicious! I've never been to Italy, but this just has to be the closest thing to getting a true Sicilian pizza. My uncles were ranting and raving about this place for months so they finally decided to prove it to me. Mind you, I was very skeptical seeing as everything they raved about before was always overhyped and never met my expectations. Spumoni Gardens definitely met my expectations and then some! The 2 lines (one for slices only and the other for whole pies) were stretched out across the parking lot and now I see why! We got one pizza pie and, at first glance, all I could think of was ""what the hell is with all the sauce?? where's the cheese!?!?!?"" I took one bite and fell in love! OMG I wish I listened to them before and came here all the time so I can get my fill of true Sicilian pizza at least twice a week. The slices are HUGE and extremely filling. I had no idea how I managed to eat 2 slices! My uncle has to be a record breaker though! That guy downed 5 slices! And he wanted to buy more! Nuts! I wanted to puke after the first and I ate the second slice because I just wanted more even though my stomach was screaming ""STOPPPP!!!!""

"Despite the hair in my pizza, (Yes, you read that correctly ""hair in my pizza - I don't want to talk about it), I thorougly enjoyed my experience.  After a day at the beach - sand still in my bathing suit - pizza, salad and spumoni hit the spot. The pizza was yummy, definitely not what I was expecting (and I'm not talking about the hair) - the sauce had a nice ""edge"" to it and the crust was spot-on.  The strawberry salad was very fresh and the ample serving of goat cheese came in a separate container.  Sitting at a picnic table eating the spumoni from a paper container brought me back to my youth.   And so did the 80s tunes playing in the background.As I have been hearing about the famous Spumoni Gardens for years and from many different sources, I assume the hair in our first pie was just a weird fluke.  And since the staff had absolutely no problem giving us a new pie, all was quickly forgotten.",4.0
"Based on L&B takeout --- My office ordered 10 boxes of L&B's famous Sicilian pizzas on 2 separate occasions, and both times I was incredibly underwhelmed.  I get the whole mozzarella melting into the dough before topping with the sauce dynamic, but didn't think it produced anything particularly tasty.  Both times the pies arrived partially cold (we're in WFC across from 9/11 site, so I may give them some leeway here), but both times I also tasted a hint of something rancid. Maybe it was the sauce, or the hardened cheese that hadn't melded entirely into the dough and just laid like a dried clump of wax  - but it was off-putting.  The dough was good, not crisp because again it was traveling, but the sauce was a bit too heavy, and weighed down the slice.  I would think they'd be better straight out of the oven, but still not extraordinary.I will say all of my Italian coworkers would not stop raving about L&B, cold Sicilians and all, but the other ethnic make-up of our office were not blown-away...harsh but true. Another +1 star because both times they were free lunches so I'll be fine.",3.0
"Oh, the warm, saucy, cheesy majesty that is L&B's.  I'm always thrilled to pick up a Sicilian pie and (no matter what the day had in store for me) have my spirits lifted by a wonderfully crafted square slice.  I can never get enough of the sauce and each slice has just the right amount to flood my palate yet doesn't compromising the chewy and slightly crispy dough holding this thing of beauty together.  The regular pies are good but the Sicilian are masterfully done.I love that there is nothing pretentious about this place, just amazing pizza and some benches to park your ass in while you experience something just short of magic.  If you managed to save a little room, and the weather isn't too harsh out, I suggest giving the spumoni a try.  Seriously, a cure all for any restless stomach.",4.0
"An interesting slice.  It's Sicilian but I guess it's Grandma style.  They actually compose the pizza by putting the cheese on first then smothering it with sauce then sprinkling parmesan on top.  The logic is that placing the cheese prevents any sogginess in the crust...they use a lot of crust.  I enjoyed it...it's hard to compare to other Sicilian slices I've had because it's so different.  Forget comparisons, I think their version of the Sicilian slice is very good...I wish I could give it 3.5 stars but opted for 4 because I really like the huge outdoor area they have going on.  It feels sort of like a blast ifrom the past and you have kids, families, older people all gathered around enjoying anything from calamari, pizza, to ice cream.  It was a pleasure eating pizza outdoors on a Saturday night while drinking 2 dollar cans of bud.btw, the restaurant looked great...I'll have to go back and try.  The portions looked tremendous...like you come here to eat...eat like Tony Soprano or Fat Pussy.",4.0
"For the most part, I stop by the outdoor eatery and grab a few square slices. Their round pizzas are nothing to write home about, but the squares are what everyone and their grandmas stop by for. The square has sweet, flavorful sauce over some cheese (which isn't as notable) but a buttery, thick crust. While the pizza is memorable, it would only warrant four stars.However, the indoors restaurant is the final kicker. Service is fast and simply amazing. I can think of no other restaurant in New York that has the same commitment to its customers. While I've never met Lenny, the waiters would offer unmatched attention, making for a pleasant experience. They really go beyond the requirements for what I consider to make for a pleasant experience. One time, I was informed that they ran out of burgers. They were gracious enough to whip up a tasty dessert of brownies, hot fudge, ice cream, and strawberries for us. This is place is definitely worth it.

"L&B makes a tasty square, but they've gotten so busy in the past 10 years that I often get a cold, old slice. If you can get one fresh out of the oven, you're in for a real treat.

"Easily the best Sicilian style pizza in town, and a summer staple of South Brooklyn worth checking out for the pizza alone.  Unlike most NY slices this pizza comes in doughy, fluffy squares topped with chewy cheese and a slightly tart tomato sauce.  The combination is quite filling, and the garlic salt on the crust is perfectly crisp though there are few edges in their generous pans.  Needless to say it will leave a memorable impression of what pizza that's distinct from other parlors around town.A half tray of pizza easily feeds 4-6 with leftovers.  I like to bring guests from out of town to try their pizza, which makes a great stop before and after visits to Coney Island.",4.0

"Despite the hair in my pizza, (Yes, you read that correctly ""hair in my pizza - I don't want to talk about it), I thorougly enjoyed my experience.  After a day at the beach - sand still in my bathing suit - pizza, salad and spumoni hit the spot. The pizza was yummy, definitely not what I was expecting (and I'm not talking about the hair) - the sauce had a nice ""edge"" to it and the crust was spot-on.  The strawberry salad was very fresh and the ample serving of goat cheese came in a separate container.  Sitting at a picnic table eating the spumoni from a paper container brought me back to my youth.   And so did the 80s tunes playing in the background.As I have been hearing about the famous Spumoni Gardens for years and from many different sources, I assume the hair in our first pie was just a weird fluke.  And since the staff had absolutely no problem giving us a new pie, all was quickly forgotten.",4.0
"Based on L&B takeout --- My office ordered 10 boxes of L&B's famous Sicilian pizzas on 2 separate occasions, and both times I was incredibly underwhelmed.  I get the whole mozzarella melting into the dough before topping with the sauce dynamic, but didn't think it produced anything particularly tasty.  Both times the pies arrived partially cold (we're in WFC across from 9/11 site, so I may give them some leeway here), but both times I also tasted a hint of something rancid. Maybe it was the sauce, or the hardened cheese that hadn't melded entirely into the dough and just laid like a dried clump of wax  - but it was off-putting.  The dough was good, not crisp because again it was traveling, but the sauce was a bit too heavy, and weighed down the slice.  I would think they'd be better straight out of the oven, but still not extraordinary.I will say all of my Italian coworkers would not stop raving about L&B, cold Sicilians and all, but the other ethnic make-up of our office were not blown-away...harsh but true. Another +1 star because both times they were free lunches so I'll be fine.",3.0
"Oh, the warm, saucy, cheesy majesty that is L&B's.  I'm always thrilled to pick up a Sicilian pie and (no matter what the day had in store for me) have my spirits lifted by a wonderfully crafted square slice.  I can never get enough of the sauce and each slice has just the right amount to flood my palate yet doesn't compromising the chewy and slightly crispy dough holding this thing of beauty together.  The regular pies are good but the Sicilian are masterfully done.I love that there is nothing pretentious about this place, just amazing pizza and some benches to park your ass in while you experience something just short of magic.  If you managed to save a little room, and the weather isn't too harsh out, I suggest giving the spumoni a try.  Seriously, a cure all for any restless stomach.",4.0
"An interesting slice.  It's Sicilian but I guess it's Grandma style.  They actually compose the pizza by putting the cheese on first then smothering it with sauce then sprinkling parmesan on top.  The logic is that placing the cheese prevents any sogginess in the crust...they use a lot of crust.  I enjoyed it...it's hard to compare to other Sicilian slices I've had because it's so different.  Forget comparisons, I think their version of the Sicilian slice is very good...I wish I could give it 3.5 stars but opted for 4 because I really like the huge outdoor area they have going on.  It feels sort of like a blast ifrom the past and you have kids, families, older people all gathered around enjoying anything from calamari, pizza, to ice cream.  It was a pleasure eating pizza outdoors on a Saturday night while drinking 2 dollar cans of bud.btw, the restaurant looked great...I'll have to go back and try.  The portions looked tremendous...like you come here to eat...eat like Tony Soprano or Fat Pussy.",4.0
"For the most part, I stop by the outdoor eatery and grab a few square slices. Their round pizzas are nothing to write home about, but the squares are what everyone and their grandmas stop by for. The square has sweet, flavorful sauce over some cheese (which isn't as notable) but a buttery, thick crust. While the pizza is memorable, it would only warrant four stars.However, the indoors restaurant is the final kicker. Service is fast and simply amazing. I can think of no other restaurant in New York that has the same commitment to its customers. While I've never met Lenny, the waiters would offer unmatched attention, making for a pleasant experience. They really go beyond the requirements for what I consider to make for a pleasant experience. One time, I was informed that they ran out of burgers. They were gracious enough to whip up a tasty dessert of brownies, hot fudge, ice cream, and strawberries for us. This is place is definitely worth it. Spumoni, square slices, and Sicilian food, at more-than-fair prices open until late at night. What's not to like?",5.0
"L&B makes a tasty square, but they've gotten so busy in the past 10 years that I often get a cold, old slice. If you can get one fresh out of the oven, you're in for a real treat. The restaurant has great food, and the ice cream is delish. Great spot in the summer, when you can sit outside with a big group of friends.",3.0
"Easily the best Sicilian style pizza in town, and a summer staple of South Brooklyn worth checking out for the pizza alone.  Unlike most NY slices this pizza comes in doughy, fluffy squares topped with chewy cheese and a slightly tart tomato sauce.  The combination is quite filling, and the garlic salt on the crust is perfectly crisp though there are few edges in their generous pans.  Needless to say it will leave a memorable impression of what pizza that's distinct from other parlors around town.A half tray of pizza easily feeds 4-6 with leftovers.  I like to bring guests from out of town to try their pizza, which makes a great stop before and after visits to Coney Island.",4.0
"Nothing like a bit of spumoni, apparently, to cool you down in the summer.A tasty, light frozen milk-like dessert, the pistachio and chocolate flavors are delicious.Busy lot, though -- lots of people inside at the Italian side of the restaurant.

The cheese under the sauce is perfect for someone like me that doesn't like overly cheesy pizza, and their sauce is tangy and delicious. It's honestly the perfect slice. Again, there's no reason to elaborate because for what it is (a pizza place) it's perfect. It looks like a pizza place, smells like a pizza place, and has service like a pizza place. I've never eaten in the restaurant side of it, but if their other food is anything like their pizza then it's divine!",5.0
"So, about 6 months ago I was dying to try this place out.  After years of fending off questions about how I live in Brooklyn and haven't been to Spumoni Gardens (hey listen its a big borough ok?), I was finally around the area with the wife, and decided to take home their sicilian pie home to the family,  How would I describe it?  It's all about the sauce.  Doughy but tasty bread, with cheese baked in...I gotta say I understand the cravings.  I've been back, and had times I've wished I could go back as well, if you know what I mean.",4.0
classic spot get the square pie and a spumoni after you go to brighton or other beach.  way better than coney food anywhere.  quite a scene at night... very sopranos casual.,5.0
"When I took a bite into the ""great"" Silician slice, it reminded me of middle school pizza; thick crust, sauce and sprinkles of cheese. I'm not a fan of thick crusts, so for me it wasn't good. I also tried the Italian ices, the flavors of watermelon and pomegranate is not good, but the coconut was and the rainbow spumoni looked good.",2.0
"peezzaaa peeezzaaa... I'm the type that prefer paper thin crust with a lot of cheese. However, this one is definitely incomparable to the usual thin crust goodness I always eat. Extremely light n' fluffy at top and perfectly crispy at bottom. The square form makes it even better to eat. (I prefer the ends, i'm a bread lover)it doesn't get it's full 5 stars because the location is too far, and it takes a journey for me to find it.

"I can't say this is the best square slice in Brooklyn, only because I haven't tried every single pizza place in Brooklyn.  (I'm pretty close though, and  it's one of my many life goals)  However, I CAN say that L&B's serves up the best square slice I've ever tasted in all my years on this Earth.  The crust is perfect.  Crisp, slightly burnt on the bottom with a soft, not-too-chewy texture.The sauce is perfect.  Tangy, sweet, a little salty, with hints of basil.  I like to add some oregano on top.The cheese is perfect.  Smooth, creamy mozz placed under the sauce, with melting parm-reg on top.The timing is perfect.  These slices MOVE.  On a busy night, which is every night, if you time it right, you can get a slice from a pie that came out of the oven not 20 seconds ago.  Then you can contemplate that lifelong dilemma of ""To burn the roof of your mouth, or not to burn?"" while you stare at the plate of gooey, bubbly deliciousness.  I usually end up deciding ""Screw it all, let it burn!"" and soothing it with some excellent spumoni later.",5.0

Even when the line is long, it won't take long for you to get your food. The spumoni and ices are also incredibly good. BUT there is one major issue here. The LOUDSPEAKER SYSTEM. They just scream into it all day. Its unnecessarily loud. I would easily say they deserve 4 stars otherwise, but it is so distracting, and in some cases, if you sit too close to a speaker, painful to endure, that it ruins everything else this place has going for it.

The only thing about my experience here that knocks it down to four stars is the spotty service.  Both times I've been here, it's been hard to track down waiters for simple and reasonable requests such as soda refills, and both of my parties were left sitting for far too long waiting for our checks.",4.0

"I really love this place, it is as Brooklyn as Brooklyn can be - it makes you want to bust out the polyester leisure suit, white patent leather platforms and the butterfly collar, check yourself out in the mirror and compare yourself to Al Pachino while shooting off the finger guns. They have walk up window service for pizza and for spumoni, and yu can sit outside and people watch, which more than compensates you for the negligible price of your food.They serve pizza in triangle and square forms (Neopolitan and Sicilian for all of you high falootin' fancy pants yelpers). DO NOT order triangles, go with the squares - it's what this place is known for. The sauce is on the top, and it is delicious while being terrible for you at the same time. Bloomberg and the City Council are probably fuming about this place as we speak.After you have a few squares, and go back for more and eat those, you will want to order spumoni. This is real gelato, not the edy's grand stuff you can buy at the supermarket. Served in a little paper cup, old school brooklyn style.Spumoni Gardens is a perfect place to stop after a long day at Coney Island. Good for kids, and you get free entertainment in people watching.

"This is one of the worst, if not the worst italian restaurant in Brooklyn. With so many reviews I expected a lot better. The sicilian slice is absolutely average, it's like those school french pizzas, very doughy, a bit of a crunch on the bottom, and what appears and tasted like plain tomato sauce from the can. It is very saucy and extremely average in taste. You can buy some regular bread, toast it in the oven, open a can of sauce, dip it in said sauce with some cheese. The pastas are HORRIBLE.

"I really love this place, it is as Brooklyn as Brooklyn can be - it makes you want to bust out the polyester leisure suit, white patent leather platforms and the butterfly collar, check yourself out in the mirror and compare yourself to Al Pachino while shooting off the finger guns. They have walk up window service for pizza and for spumoni, and yu can sit outside and people watch, which more than compensates you for the negligible price of your food.They serve pizza in triangle and square forms (Neopolitan and Sicilian for all of you high falootin' fancy pants yelpers). DO NOT order triangles, go with the squares - it's what this place is known for. The sauce is on the top, and it is delicious while being terrible for you at the same time. Bloomberg and the City Council are probably fuming about this place as we speak.After you have a few squares, and go back for more and eat those, you will want to order spumoni. This is real gelato, not the edy's grand stuff you can buy at the supermarket. Served in a little paper cup, old school brooklyn style.Spumoni Gardens is a perfect place to stop after a long day at Coney Island. Good for kids, and you get free entertainment in people watching. What more do you people want, anyway????",4.0

"My kinda place.I can't speak about the menu as a whole, but I can concerning the Sicilian slices.This is the closest thing I have ever had when compered to my trips to Sicily.Although the San Marzano tomatoes aren't traditional Sicilian, it is a nice touch concerning taste and quality.I have no reservations giving this pie the highest rating",5.0
"This place is as good as they say.  The pizza is perfect, 2 slices and a split salad filled us right up.  Spumoni is definitely an acquired taste (especially if you're sensitive to that almond extract flavor).  The setting was just amazing, all decked out for christmas and they play a loop of all their TV press ever (so early 90s NY1 clips mostly) which is just great.  A lot of Big Pussy types, 75 year old couples joking about getting divorced, large Italian families etc. eating here (this is all awesome).  I hear it's great to eat outside so I think when the warm weather is back I'll make this a bike adventure destination.",4.0

As for the quality of the slice, it was nothing special.  The sauce wasn't chunky or seasoned very nicely, and I found it to be way too sweet.  The crust was decent, but the tomato paste based sauce really detracted from the experience.  There was a slight dusting of cheap parmesan cheese on top that was kind of an afterthought.I also took home a quart of spumoni that was an absolute joke.  The most artificial, neon green crap I have ever seen.  I was very surprised and taken aback that a place with spumoni in its name would serve such an inferior product.  I will not be back, ever.",2.0
"Took a drive here on a random Saturday.  Had no trouble getting a seat inside.  Service was quick and great.  For someone who prefers thin crust pizza, I was surprised by how good their pizza was.  had their spumoni for dessert, it was great! It definetly lived up to my expectations.",4.0
"For as long as I can remember, people have been talking about this place. I've heard so many variations of the name that sometimes people would be talking about it and I'd have no clue what they're talking about. Names range from Spumoni's to Spumoni Gardens to L&B and so on. I've only ever heard good things about this place. Mainly people proclaiming the Sicilian Slice to be the best ever. I was once brought here by a former coworker and after admitting that I've never been here before he immediately exclaimed that I just had to try the best Sicilian Slice. He was from Long Island so I don't even know how he became a Spumoni pizza expert. I agreed on the Sicilian and after all the hype surrounding this thing I was expecting heaven on earth or something of the sort. What I got was a thick piece of bread and chunky tomato sauce with cheese that reminded me of the pizzas you get for lunch back in grade school. Yuck.Can someone tell me what it is that I might not be comprehending here? Is it supposed to be like school lunch? Couldn't I just go visit a random school cafeteria for that? Honestly it wasn't good at all. But then again my bias is that I hate the crust on pizza unless it's thin and crunchy so that might be it. Maybe but maybe not.What I do like about this place is the ample seating that they provide. There are many seats inside but just as many outside as well. It's great in the summer when all the locals come to grab a slice and just hang out and relax outside. They have ice cream too!",2.0

"Came here for some dessert to end the day after our glorious experience at Di Fara Pizza.  Friend told me I needed to get the spumoni ice cream here.  It was probably one of the best spumoni I've had in my life!  I like how the flavor was just light and the texture was creamy and icy at the same time.  Even the cone was fresh and crunchy.  Me like!  My friend had the soft-serve cones, also top quality stuff.  We were just sitting at the picnic tables outside, enjoying a lazy, sunny Friday afternoon.  This place once again reminded me how much I love NY - the diversity of people, food and culture.  This is indeed an authentic spot.",4.0

"4.5 starsBest square slice in Brooklyn? You bet your culo! Crispy slightly-burnt crust on the bottoms and sides, soft dough in the middle, a perfect amount of mozzarella topped off with some seriously delicious sauce, and a generous sprinkling of Parmigiano-Reggiano on top.

The sit-down restaurant section, next door to where they serve the pizza, has some fantastic food as well. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because: (a) their fettucini alfredo always felt like something was slightly off or perhaps missing. (b) The prices are going up (which I normally wouldn't have a problem with) but it seems their slice sizes are going down as well!Aside from those 2 qualms, however, I heart Spumoni Gardens, big time!",4.0

The chicken was juicy and tender, and came with sauteed mushrooms, which was unusual, but a pleasant surprise. The whole bill for two large appetizers and an entree, a glass of wine and a soda was $50. I left stuffed with a doggie bag. After dinner I had spumoni outside which was also cheap and delicious.

If you like ice cream, I really like their rainbow spumoni.  You can even take it home in cartons if you like it that much.  It's cheap, tasty and wonderful when the humidity just won't quit.  As for the soft chocolate ice cream, it's rich and creamy like ice cream should be.Yes it's crowded- but that's because it tastes good.",4.0

"Yes, the Sicilian (square) pizza - or, as my nana says, ""abeetz"" - is killing, as is the complex and special spumoni, not to be missed. But if you live nearby you're missing out if you don't try their pastas, they are fantastic. Last night we split a seafood salad (perfectly cooked but under seasoned) and linguine bolognese (red, not cream sauce, although I've had both). Delicious and unless you're a glutton the famously gigantic portions are perfect to share. Every pasta I've had was perfectly al dente with fresh-tasting sauces in which you clearly taste the love. Pasta with sausage and broccoli rabe is also particularly good, it's not an easy one to get right and they do a slammin job.

"I spent a lot of time in Brooklyn, and once lived near enough to Spumoni Gardens to eat pizza there a few times a week.   I used to enjoy the food there, so although I now live over an hour away, when my sister requested that we do a family dinner there I was excited.   Last night we ate there with a party of seven including one child and six adults.    I would definitely think twice before I visit this place again.  I had called ahead at 3PM to get seating in the dining room for 5 PM, and was told they don't take reservations, but I could put myself on the dining list which would give us the next available table for our party size.  I was on the list for 5 PM, but we weren't seated until over an hour later!    My family was so hungry that while we were waiting, they opted to sit outside and get a pizza from the take out counter and eat it at the picnic tables outside.   Surprisingly, the take-out counter moved swiftly and efficiently and we were given out pizza and beverages right away.  The pizza was hot and fresh and tasted good.   We had some leftover slices and left them in the boxes to take home.  By the time we could actually be seated in the dining room, my family was ready for desert.  After checking with the hostess, finally, a table was ready.  We were seated, but an older woman helping the hostess was very rude to us and made a nasty comment about bringing in our leftover pizza boxes, even though they were from the Spumoni Garden's take out counter!   She wasn't at all happy to seat us just for desert.  I explained that we had waited over an hour for the table and had one small child and one diabetic person in our party.   I said that my family had drove all the way from Pennsylvania and New Jersey just for this dinner, and that no one could wait over an hour to eat because we all had a long drive home, so that was why we ate outside.   Still, were not treated very nicely.    We were given a table right up against a wall in a cramped corner and a large pile of menus were dumped on top of our pizza boxes by the older woman who was helping the hostess!  The woman explained that ""everyone has a story"", and she ""could not listen to everyone's story"" because the restaurant was too busy.  Still, we were hoping to have a delicious desert and so we waited for the waiter to come take out orders.  We watched the waiter help about 5 other tables before he came to us. Our waiter was nice and polite and apologized for the wait.   My family ordered various sizes of spumoni, tartuffo and tortoni deserts for the adults and an ice cream cone for my niece.  The deserts came out, but a few things were not what we were expecting.  Usually tartuffo has a dark chocolate shell over a mixture of vanilla, chocolate and strawberry ice cream, but instead we were served a less enjoyable white chocolate version with raspberry ice cream.  The spumoni was okay, but had a bit of a gritty texture.  The totoni was nice and creamy, but one person in our party complained that the toasted coconut it was topped with was stale and unpleasant.    Overall, our experience in the dining room was not great and I would not return to Spumoni Gardens anytime soon.",2.0

"Totally LEGIT Sicilian pizza... at first I was pretty turned off by the fact that you can't get toppings on it unless you order a whole one because I totally wanted some anchovies on mine, but I guess that just shows how confident they are on their plain cheese pizzas cause a plain slice just blew me away.Some people don't like their pizza doughy, but I personally say ""Bring that carb load on!!!"" it was most definitely my favorite part of the pizza. sauce was good and cheese was gooey... nothing better than the simplest things done right.Then I got a bit selfish and got BOTH the spumoni and Italian Ice (coconut flavor) and man did that kick my taste buds ass... but totally in a good way of course.

"So my g/f and I are in bay ridge visiting a couple friends who had invited us over for dinner.

We trust him and decide to drive out.Thankfully we did. Somehow en route to getting the spumoni ice cream, we were convinced to try a sicilian square slice. at first glance, it looked like one of those pizza truck pizzas that are in midtown. But it was so much better than them. the cheese was actually at the bottom and the tangy, delicious tomato sauce on top of it with sprinkling of pecorino to finish. Together, it formed a slice worth finishing despite my full stomach.

Maybe because the owners are non Italian. Now they must use tomato paste and they are very cheap with the cheese. They only serve Pepsi soda, no coke cola. Also the slices are very small for the price they charge and you will get heartburn. My advice is to bring some tums if you don't believe me.",2.0

"I am not a big fan of pizza. I mean, I hardly ever eat pizzas. I'm thinking perhaps twice or thrice a year. I think it's because of the vomit smell that remains behind after eating the pizza. It's the cheesy after-smell! So it figures that this is my first time eating a Sicilian .I was brought here by a friend. When she said that we were going to be eating pizza, I was like, damn, pizza. How unexciting. When I go out to eat, I like to eat cultural foods, or Asian influenced foods. I don't see pizza as such. It's the epitome of fast food. You grab a slice and go. Maybe going to one of those fancier pizza joints that they have in the city will change my view of pizza, bumping it up to the ""exciting culinary experience"". That means that I still see pizza as plain old pizza after coming here. But, on the other hand, the pizza was pretty damn good!The pie came out piping hot. I sprinkled tons of red pepper flakes and garlic on it, and took a bite, a delicious bite! I was surprised at how good the slice was. The bread (is that the right pizza terminology for it?) was really soft and pillowy. The sauce was tangy and flavorful. I mean that bite was so awesome! I'm actually craving some right now (craving for pizza almost never happens to me). It really was that good. As for the spumoni, not really.

"You have to go here with a very specific frame of mind. That you want a change of pace from the pizza you usually get and that you CRAVE awesome Spumoni, and you are cool with fighting for the almost non-existent parking in the lot, and the guidos triple parked outside. Dont go there for glamour, or for a sit down gourmet meal inside (did that once and NOT worth it at all) Go there to sit on a metal bench, enjoy some tasty pizza (ya gotta order a least a full pie and share, or bring some home) and look around and take in the characters that go there, it is a specticle, but in a good way.Oh yeah...I did not see many flowers in this 'garden' but it is always a memorable experience if you go for the Sicilian pizza and spumoni desert, PERIOD.  (TASTES even better when you reheat the next day...so buy extra and bring home........NOT the spumoni,,the pizza!!!)",4.0
"Been going since 1984.The recipe hasn't changed, go for the square pizza. It's unique and is what has made them famous.Don't expect outstanding customer service, just order your pizza and a Pepsi and eat. Then, after you ate, go next ""door"" and get Spumoni ice. There isn't much else, just good pizza and Italian ice that has been the recipe for success for 72+ years.",5.0

"I am on a quest to find the best pizza in New York! I have eaten in L&B's during the 1990's. During that time it was pretty good. Over the years the quality has gone down dramatically! Maybe because the owners are non Italian. Now they must use tomato paste and they are very cheap with the cheese. They only serve Pepsi soda, no coke cola. Also the slices are very small for the price they charge and you will get heartburn. My advice is to bring some tums if you don't believe me.",2.0

"I am not a big fan of pizza. I mean, I hardly ever eat pizzas. I'm thinking perhaps twice or thrice a year. I think it's because of the vomit smell that remains behind after eating the pizza. It's the cheesy after-smell! So it figures that this is my first time eating a Sicilian .I was brought here by a friend. When she said that we were going to be eating pizza, I was like, damn, pizza. How unexciting. When I go out to eat, I like to eat cultural foods, or Asian influenced foods. I don't see pizza as such. It's the epitome of fast food. You grab a slice and go. Maybe going to one of those fancier pizza joints that they have in the city will change my view of pizza, bumping it up to the ""exciting culinary experience"".

"Nobody ever talks about Lenny. How he trolls his restaurant with his sweatpants and soiled T shirt trying to up-sell with his chefs table special menu. I didn't fall for it at first but it turns out he was right. In Italy nobody orders right off the menu! says Lenny. So I let him plan my dinner and it was amazing. He truly has a love for the art of Italian cuisine and it shows. You just have to stop him at some point or he will keep sending dishes out to you all night. I remember one time where he felt that the dish brought out wasn't up to snuff and he removed it from our check. He also bought us a huge spumoni tower of desert gratis. Sometimes the waiters themselves buy you desert. The portions are gigantic and skillfully prepared. The prices are very reasonable. If you just want pizza remember to stick with the Sicilian. There is none better anywhere! It is a saucy pizza with pastry like crispy dough with an abundance of flavor thanks to love and delicious Brooklyn water. I have been coming here for about 20 years and it has been consistently great. Do not believe the naysayers. This is the best Sicilian pizza of all time, anywhere!",5.0

Not a whole star because the rest of my review will be worth the 5 stars.I LOVE their sicilian pizza! Yes, I know a few people have told me they hate the pizza because there's barely any cheese.

Also when I would order from the dessert side, I would see the workers preparing great looking dessert dishes.

"When Famous Fat Dave introduced us to this place on our last visit to New York, it was so good we took the subway out on our own from Manhattan (a one hour ride) only 12 hours later. This time we were staying with a friend in New Jersey so we endured a 2 hour train and subway trip from New Jersey involving FOUR TRANSFERS just to eat here. Totally worth it though. My time is precious in New York because I never have enough time to go everywhere I want to, but it's worth traveling for the pizza at Spumoni Gardens.What they do here is Sicilian style pizza which is thicker and breadier than New York style. You order at the counter and let them know how many crust edges you want. The pizza slices are all square shaped and the pie is cooked as one big rectangle, so your choices are 0, 1, and 2. (I prefer 1 - like back hair it gives you something to hold onto.) I recommend ordering one slice at a time so it never gets cold. Oh yeah, they make one kind of pizza and it's cheese. That's the only kind you need. The sauce is what makes it good. In fact it's outstanding.You'll probably get a table but you may have to wait a few minutes. Soft drink cans are $1.50 each which is a bit on the high side.When you're done you can head next door where there's a sit down restaurant (serving pasta classics) and spumoni counter. While you wait you can look at the old neighborhood pictures.The spumoni is a day-glo green color, and it's nutty and it's the best damn spumoni I've ever had.Blue collar New York and Boston guys are smart and will mess with you. It's something we unfortunately don't have in the same way on the West Coast. When I got my spumonis I asked for a spoon, and the counter guy was like ""That'll be $1."" I was like Ha ha, smart ass.This place is a slightly sketch walk from the subway. It's fine during the day but I wouldn't do it at night. You also get to walk past an Aardvark amusement rental place with small amusement park rides. (Can you tell Coney Island is only a mile away?)

"What a way to travel from Queens to get here for their Sicilian square slice. This was our 1st stop on Pizza Epicurean Adventure Part I.

It tastes like a big dough pie. So I am not please, yet they do sell a lot it seems, and its quick stop of eat for 10 mins and next set of people.. so I guess business is good.",2.0

"Def a fan.  I would go back - the area is a bit hard to get to by subway and shady at night, but definitely worth the pizza.  I went for a friend's bday who grew up going to L&B all the time - so that means I got to try a lot of pizza.  I like the round pie more than the square, but I do like the square - and I don't like a lot of square pizzas!  The plain for both was the best.  We initially ordered the round pie with mushrooms and it was just ok.  Then the birthday girl freaked out that we dared to get  topping so we ordered the plain and she was right - 100 times better!  They gave us water glasses for the wine some people ordered which was kind of weird but it was also crazy packed on a Friday night at 8/9pm so I guess I can understand.  They were also really accommodating since we had a lifesize poster of the birthday girl's favorite actor waiting for her at the table as a surprise!",4.0
Very unique pizza.   This place gets busy quick and there is a reason why.  They serve a deep dish pizza that reminds me alot like Lou Malnatis you get in Chicago.  The dough is soft and moist and smothered with sweet and tasty tomato sauce on the top.   When you are eating the pizza it actually feels light.   After two to three slices later you start to feel how heavy it is!  The wait staff is extremely friendly.   Don't order too much because you can easily fill up on a few slices.   If you are looking for a unique pizza experience i'd try this place out.  Nice change of pace from your typical New York style pizza.,4.0
"Let me give everyone an honest review with a little history about this place.Spumoni used to be owned by ITALIANS. They sold the place to ARABS. From that transaction, it all went downhill. The squares used to be gigantic and loaded with tasty sauce. Now, they're half the size and DRY. WTF happened to the sauce? Horrible. My wife is not Italian and SHE noticed the difference. In fact, SHE noticed it first! I gave Spumoni the benefit of the doubt and tried 3 more times. Each time was the same. Lousy. It's not what it used to be and now it's just a popularity contest. I believe most reviewers here that gave them 4- 5 stars are either their first time or they're regulars fooling themselves and are trying desperately hard to accept the changes.

"I've never had pizza quite like the square slice here at LB Spumoni Gardens. Yes, I have had ""sicilian"" style pizza. Yes, I have had thick crust and Chicago deep dish. Yes, I have had every type of artisinal and neapolitan pizza. And every interpretation of utility pizza and new age vegan pies. All put on traditional, sourdough, pita, cracker, you-name-it-I've-had it crusts. And yes, I have had the square pie at DiFara (still one of my all time favorites).This pizza achieves two things right off the bat. It is light and fluffly and its chewy gooey. All within a light crisp crust. Unlike DiFara square, the crust is not heavily fattened up and takes only a light crisping in the oven, versus a deep crisp texture. The dough however, grows to monsterous height. Like a good slice of Texas toast. But instead of meeting with a slice of cheddar, this dough melts....no FUSES, mozz cheese straight into itself. It does this so well that one cannot tell when dough stops and cheese starts.And just as your jaw is fusing the crust/dough/cheese together the sauce comes in with a hit of acidity. POW, keeping each bite seperated. Otherwise you'd be lost in a cheese/dough dream.I appreciate all types of pizza. My favorite being more thin crust and neapolitan wood-fired types. But I also love a well made slice that carries with it neighborhood pride and a good deal of history. If I grew up in the Bay Ridge area I could easily see this being my feeling of home. A warm and doughy comfort food perfect for sharing with the family, friends, and loved ones.",4.0

"I'm new to NY and a friend took me here, i have to tell you i would have never stopped in if I was driving by. Place is nice but from the outside looks like a Pizza place. Well i was so impressed with the food in the place, the Pizza has to be the best that i have ever had, the chicken parm out of this world. If you want to take your family out for excellent food in a great family environment this is the place. If you are just driving by pick up a pizza you won't regret it...",5.0
"What a way to travel from Queens to get here for their Sicilian square slice. This was our 1st stop on Pizza Epicurean Adventure Part I. Recommended that this has to be one of the must stop, we finally made it here and try Sicilian slice. Thick on the dough, with lots of tomato sauce, I am not a big fan. It tastes like a big dough pie. So I am not please, yet they do sell a lot it seems, and its quick stop of eat for 10 mins and next set of people.. so I guess business is good.",2.0

From rice balls to pizza to spumoni, I can promise you will leave stuffed, satisfied and charmed by Brooklyn.",5.0
"Def a fan.  I would go back - the area is a bit hard to get to by subway and shady at night, but definitely worth the pizza.  I went for a friend's bday who grew up going to L&B all the time - so that means I got to try a lot of pizza.  I like the round pie more than the square, but I do like the square - and I don't like a lot of square pizzas!  The plain for both was the best.  We initially ordered the round pie with mushrooms and it was just ok.  Then the birthday girl freaked out that we dared to get  topping so we ordered the plain and she was right - 100 times better!  They gave us water glasses for the wine some people ordered which was kind of weird but it was also crazy packed on a Friday night at 8/9pm so I guess I can understand.  They were also really accommodating since we had a lifesize poster of the birthday girl's favorite actor waiting for her at the table as a surprise!",4.0
Very unique pizza.   This place gets busy quick and there is a reason why.  They serve a deep dish pizza that reminds me alot like Lou Malnatis you get in Chicago.  The dough is soft and moist and smothered with sweet and tasty tomato sauce on the top.   When you are eating the pizza it actually feels light.   After two to three slices later you start to feel how heavy it is!  The wait staff is extremely friendly.   Don't order too much because you can easily fill up on a few slices.   If you are looking for a unique pizza experience i'd try this place out.  Nice change of pace from your typical New York style pizza.,4.0
"Let me give everyone an honest review with a little history about this place.Spumoni used to be owned by ITALIANS. They sold the place to ARABS. From that transaction, it all went downhill. The squares used to be gigantic and loaded with tasty sauce. Now, they're half the size and DRY. WTF happened to the sauce? Horrible. My wife is not Italian and SHE noticed the difference. In fact, SHE noticed it first! I gave Spumoni the benefit of the doubt and tried 3 more times. Each time was the same. Lousy. It's not what it used to be and now it's just a popularity contest. I believe most reviewers here that gave them 4- 5 stars are either their first time or they're regulars fooling themselves and are trying desperately hard to accept the changes. It's no where near what it used to be. Not even close. It's a local landmark and nothing else.",1.0

"L&B has been a Brooklyn institution for over 50 years and there's a reason for that. They make quite possibly the best Sicilian squares in all of metropolitan NY. I've been going here since I was a little kid and have always loved my experiences here. Never go here for a regular slice though, they are not the draw. The thick Sicilian squares are fluffy, dripping with amazing sauce and very cheesy. What makes them different is that the cheese is below the sauce which is beyond delicious. If you're looking for the quintessential Bensonhurst atmosphere, this place is it on a summer weekend night. Flocks of club goers and ""Situtation-esque"" Brooklynites flock to this spot to be spotted and to spot. Through the years, this place has been a pizza staple of mine, and will continue to be. I have had some bad experiences though, such as a mouse sighting and I am not a big fan of their restaurant inside. The food is not on par with the pizza they serve.",3.0

Spumoni gardens is a classic!! The squares are great but what surprised me the most was the great dishes they cook up in the restaurant. Had the chicken cutlet parm with pasta and was very pleased.

L&B Spumoni Gardens offers the most unique and hands-down best slice of pizza in the city. L&B has developed a rightfully earned reputation by taking a simple spin on the Sicilian pizza.L&B has a simple formula -- take the idea of the basic makeup of a slice of pizza (sauce and cheese) and flip it to make a cheesy mozzarella base with a sweet sauce poured over mixed in with parmesan cheese for that final punch. This simple spin (mostly built on their sweet sauce) creates an unforgettable flavor that trumps any other slice in the city known for its pizza.,5.0

"Maybe Sicilian pizza isn't my thing but I found the pizza to be a bit better than average, but nothing superb. The crust was nice but I felt the pizza overall was a bit bland. I guess I'm just one of those people who enjoys their pizza thin and Brooklyn style. I was hoping the pistachio spumoni would be awesome so I got a large size cup but I was disappointed when I tasted it. The flavor seemed too strong, making it seem almost artificial. If it had been more creamy and rich, maybe the flavor would've been more subtle and enjoyable. Anyways, the experience wasn't that bad.

"The best Sicilian pie I've ever had.These huge Sicilian squares are amazing. Its so good you can't just have one slice.

The thin crust slices are pretty good too. The prices are friendly for both the pizza and the ices! There's usually a lot of foot traffic at this place but I've never had to wait too long to be taken care of at the counter.A really great family place with the outdoor picnic like seating, perfect for nice days! I always make sure I have some room for a small lemon ice :). It doesn't get any more authentic than Spumoni Gardens!Tip: Make sure it has just enough time to cool so you can enjoy it.

Went there for dinner last night. We have been going there for years and never had a bad experience. We ate in the restaurant . First we ordered wine and two appetizers to start. They came in about 2 minutes. We had not forks and it took us 3 waiters to finally get forks. The sauce for the calamari was terrible. It had no taste. We had no salt and pepper on the table and the only way to get a waiter was to jump him. We had just started to eat out appetizers and the main course came. I felt like the food was just thrown at us. I waited for grated cheese and then they gave us salt and pepper. We ended up taking food home because we felt rushed. They kept coming and trying to clean our table while we were still eating.  We were looking to have a nice relaxing dinner instead we felt rushed.  Also the sauce for out main sauce also was terrible.

"As an Italian and BK native who has been visiting L&B for 20 years, I'll overlook the fact that this pizza isn't made by Italians and say that L&B is truly unique. The square Sicilian pizza is quite different than most (sauce on top of the cheese) and its cooked to doughy almost raw perfection. Every time I go the pizza is spot on. The spumoni ice is also the best I've tasted in the tri-state area. Just the right amount of pistachio, chocolate and cremalata; so good! Their eat-in restaurant is great as well, but I honestly only go for the square slices.",5.0
"I'm no Sicilian pizza connoisseur, but on a recommendation from a friend, I was intrigued by her ""You've gotta go to L&B!"" enthusiasm.  On a day when I felt like going on a little adventure, my boyfriend and I drove 11 miles down to Gravesend to try this pizza out.What can I say?  It was good, it was hot and tasty, and we definitely scarfed it down.  $2.75 for a slice-- chewy soft crust, sweet sauce, minimal cheese.  Will I drive 11 miles in the near future to come here again?  Nah.  I'd rather try somewhere else in the quest for something amazing.We also tried the rainbow spumoni- chocolate, vanilla and pistachio.  It was nice-- a little icy, a little creamy, not cloyingly sweet.  Again, not out of this world, but definitely good.  It's a pretty casual place, nice to sit outside in the summer.  I gotta give them credit, though, for being open 70 years.  Wow!",3.0

"Even if you thought the food sucks you have to come here because the surroundings are great. But the thing is, the food doesn't suck. This place is historic and is basically 3 different businesses crammed into one place. If you're rocking an Amar'e Stoudemire jersey and just wanna stop by for a slice there is a window outside where you can sit and chill out after a day of fishing or something. And you just have to order one of their square slices and you'll feel like everything in the world is in order. Or you can go to another window and get some spumoni. For the non-Italians spumoni is like a cross between ice cream and an Italian ice, it's SPUMONI! I dined inside with my tiny ol' grandma though.

"I've been here twice and both times it was okay. The service is great, the people who work there definitely try to engage conversation with you because they're also locals so it's a great experience. The atmosphere is also very loud, but not too distracting. I've had the chef's table before with my family and we could not finish the meal because there was just so much food.

"Friends and I got 2 meatball heroes and a Sicilian pie.Sicilian pie is out of this world.  As with all New York pizza I've had, it's the water, I swear.  Alright, so for the newbs out there, Sicilian style pizza has the cheese beneath the sauce, which produces a gooey consistency.  The crust at the bottom of the pie has an amazing crunch to it, and those two textures combined gives you an almost divine piece of pizza.1 star off, though for their meatball heroes.  Meatballs were bland and flavorless.Go here for just the pizza and you'll be a happily stuffed person when you leave.  Their pasta didn't look too bad, maybe I'll try that next time.",4.0
If you crave sicilian pizza... this is the place to eat!!!Although it's a bit out of the way to get to... it's worth the time and drive... and adventure to get here!!!Plus they have Italiam ice and soft serve ice cream (get the orange cream swirl!!!) that's surprisingly good and tastey too~!It's best when you take some home... and reheat it in the toaster oven... and let the crust get a bit more crispier than normal... but just to hear that first crunch when you bite into it... it's to DIE for~!,5.0
"Now this is New York pizza at its finest. We went here with my cousin and his wife having only heard stories about this place. Might I add many sounded like fish-tales, but in the end, even they couldn't live up to how great it was. In true New York fashion they have a walk-up window (don't sit inside, its no the same) and you order the same thing every time. And that order....is pure heaven. They make a Sicilian Pizza that knocks your socks off, fills you up and keeps your wallet full in the mean time. But don't miss out on desert either. There Spumoni for desert is out of this world. Of course it is, they're known for it. It's tradition, nostalgia and a gastronomic adventure all wrapped into one. To get the full effect, you've really got to order from the outside window and hope to get a seat at one of the many benches. The only reason it doesn't get that fifth star is due to the massive crowds and even though they have a ton of benches and tables, its hard to find a spot.

"As an Italian and BK native who has been visiting L&B for 20 years, I'll overlook the fact that this pizza isn't made by Italians and say that L&B is truly unique. The square Sicilian pizza is quite different than most (sauce on top of the cheese) and its cooked to doughy almost raw perfection. Every time I go the pizza is spot on. The spumoni ice is also the best I've tasted in the tri-state area. Just the right amount of pistachio, chocolate and cremalata; so good! Their eat-in restaurant is great as well, but I honestly only go for the square slices.",5.0
"I'm no Sicilian pizza connoisseur, but on a recommendation from a friend, I was intrigued by her ""You've gotta go to L&B!"" enthusiasm.  On a day when I felt like going on a little adventure, my boyfriend and I drove 11 miles down to Gravesend to try this pizza out.What can I say?  It was good, it was hot and tasty, and we definitely scarfed it down.  $2.75 for a slice-- chewy soft crust, sweet sauce, minimal cheese.  Will I drive 11 miles in the near future to come here again?  Nah.  I'd rather try somewhere else in the quest for something amazing.We also tried the rainbow spumoni- chocolate, vanilla and pistachio.  It was nice-- a little icy, a little creamy, not cloyingly sweet.  Again, not out of this world, but definitely good.  It's a pretty casual place, nice to sit outside in the summer.  I gotta give them credit, though, for being open 70 years.  Wow!",3.0

"Even if you thought the food sucks you have to come here because the surroundings are great. But the thing is, the food doesn't suck. This place is historic and is basically 3 different businesses crammed into one place.

This is the 2nd time I've had a Sicilian pizza pie and I'll never eat a pizza again without cheating on it with L&B's pizza in my heart.

"I have to agree w/ danielle about this place, only it was the round slice  that i tried out. Go in and then order. The guy just gets the plate and t hen plops the slice on it.

It's a long line in front of me as well as behind, and i figured ok just out of the oven maybe a couple of minutes ago.Bite into the slice and it's just like any old  sucky round slice in NYC, - decent sauce and cheese on top, and that soggy shit on the bottom. I mean real soggy, like there's no crunch underneath. So i did what i normally do w/ these slices - squueze the cheese and sauce into my mouth, eat the crust and then dump the rest onto the plate and onwards to the trashcan.I ordered an entree also months b4 that slice. I think it was shells or manicotti. Whatever it was that sucked also. Plain man just plain. L&B. Maybe i'm the only fucked up one here to give it one star as apparently everybody loves this place .

The sauce on top of the square slices is sweet and delicious, and the crust was nice and crisp. The cheese under the sauce was just enough to get noticed, not overwhelming, which is nice.

"If your expectations aren't too high, Spumoni Gardens will likely please. It's a classic red sauce Italian American joint, but being located in the center of classic red sauce Italian American Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, USA, gives it that added touch of authenticity. It's been there since 1939 and for good reason. The food is good, but not great. The portions are insanely huge. Lasagna is my red sauce Italian restaurant litmus test. When they brought it out, there were enough calories on that plate to light a small city. I'm not kidding--I divided it with a knife into quarters, ate one quarter, and will be eating the other three for lunch this week. All for $11.95. And it's good lasagna, with what seems to be quality ingredients. Such a deal! Apps were good. Roasted artichoke was tasty, fried zucchini could use some more flavor, salads are huge and pleasing, calamari was fresh and tender. Spumoni Gardens is famous for pizza, especially Sicilian slices. My verdict: just OK. There's the same or better at most corner pizza joints all around the City. Very heavy on the sauce, light on the cheese here. The deserts are impressive. The spumoni does not disappoint. The pistachio ice cream was chock full of nuts, and very good. The homemade Italian ices reminded me of Corona Ices King over in Queens--highly recommended. Part of the fun of Spumoni Gardens is people watching your fellow patrons. It's like all the extras from the set of the Godfather and the Sopranos in one restaurant.

"Spumoni Gardens offers indoor and outdoor seating.  Indoor seating is more of a restaurant atmosphere with menu items like pasta and eggplant parm, while outdoor seating is strictly for pizza.  We had heard great things about the pizza, so we decided to order a half tray of pizza - about 12 slices - for $19.  Pizza at Spumoni Gardens is Sicilian style, and their pizza is a little untraditional.  Layered on top of the dough is the cheese, followed by sauce on top. A layer of pecorino romano is then dusted on top of the pie.  We were craving a pepperoni pie and like extra cheese, so we decided to get both as toppings ($2.75 each for toppings).After a 10 minute wait for our pie, we picked it up at the pickup window and sat outside at one of the many picnic tables. The extra cheese looked interesting to me, because a few slices were layered on top.  As you can see in the picture, even with the extra cheese, it looked nothing like a normal pizza.  To be honest, I thought the extra cheese would have been placed on the bottom of the pie, not the top, where the other cheese was originally put.  Still, I'm glad we ordered the extra cheese because I don't know if I would have been able to taste it otherwise.  The sauce was delicious, and I'm not sure if it was the flavoring of the overall pie or the two pieces I had, but I couldn't taste or see the cheese that was cooked under the sauce - maybe because the cheese seeped into the dough. However, I would agree with the host Adam from Man Vs. Food that because there was a layer of cheese in between the sauce and the bread, this pizza was not soggy and the bread remained crisp.With the sprinkling of the pecorino romano on the top of the pizza, my favorite part of the whole pie had to be the crust.  Some excess pecorino got on top of the crust, and it really made the crust so much more enjoyable.I really liked Spumoni Gardens.  Would I spend close to 90 minutes each way on the train for this pizza again? No, but if I was at Coney Island, I'd want to stop at Spumoni Gardens on my way home.",4.0

"I went here ordered the Sicilian. It was good the dough was perfect, the cheese everything was good. I should have gotten some ice cream too they even had Pumpkin favored ice cream.

"I am a diehard thin crust girl but there is nothing I don't love about the square, make that a corner square please from L & B.  Having grown up in Sheepshead Bay this is a literal slice of nostalgia that proves you can go home again.   The dough has a consistency that is unlike any square slice I've ever had and despite a comment below, NOTHING like Chicago deep dish.. sweet and airy you can't eat just one.. Have spumoni for dessert, watch the locals and the bikers pull up one after the other while sitting at one of the outside tables and then head to Coney (or come afterwards !) and finish off the night riding the Cyclone..",5.0
"wasn't impresssed. i would go again just becuase it's an old school brooklyn joiny, nice in the summer with the outside seating area surrounded by brooklyn surroundings. I could see how others would like, but i just don't get the bready, doughy square pizza. I'll try the traditional slice and update.",2.0

"Spumoni Gardens offers indoor and outdoor seating.  Indoor seating is more of a restaurant atmosphere with menu items like pasta and eggplant parm, while outdoor seating is strictly for pizza.  We had heard great things about the pizza, so we decided to order a half tray of pizza - about 12 slices - for $19.  Pizza at Spumoni Gardens is Sicilian style, and their pizza is a little untraditional.  Layered on top of the dough is the cheese, followed by sauce on top. A layer of pecorino romano is then dusted on top of the pie.  We were craving a pepperoni pie and like extra cheese, so we decided to get both as toppings ($2.75 each for toppings).After a 10 minute wait for our pie, we picked it up at the pickup window and sat outside at one of the many picnic tables. The extra cheese looked interesting to me, because a few slices were layered on top.  As you can see in the picture, even with the extra cheese, it looked nothing like a normal pizza.  To be honest, I thought the extra cheese would have been placed on the bottom of the pie, not the top, where the other cheese was originally put.  Still, I'm glad we ordered the extra cheese because I don't know if I would have been able to taste it otherwise.  The sauce was delicious, and I'm not sure if it was the flavoring of the overall pie or the two pieces I had, but I couldn't taste or see the cheese that was cooked under the sauce - maybe because the cheese seeped into the dough. However, I would agree with the host Adam from Man Vs. Food that because there was a layer of cheese in between the sauce and the bread, this pizza was not soggy and the bread remained crisp.With the sprinkling of the pecorino romano on the top of the pizza, my favorite part of the whole pie had to be the crust.  Some excess pecorino got on top of the crust, and it really made the crust so much more enjoyable.I really liked Spumoni Gardens.  Would I spend close to 90 minutes each way on the train for this pizza again? No, but if I was at Coney Island, I'd want to stop at Spumoni Gardens on my way home.",4.0

"Okay L&B has a decent Brooklyn neighborhood vibe. There's outdoor seating that reminds me of picnic bunches. I love sitting out here at night especially when the weather allows. Something very cool about eating a slice of piping hot pizza al fresco style. I know they're famous for the their sicilians but to tell you the truth, I've never really gotten into it. Actually their pizza in general just doesn't really do much for me. But I do make the pilgrimage to come here for their Spumoni. It's neither too icy or too creamy. It's just right. There's little chunks of pistaccio in every bite. I don't like things too sweet but they got the sweetness down perfectly.

"It was a crisp fall morning as I make my way North on the Garden state Parkway. As I approach the Outer Bridge Crossing a certain calm falls over me. I am originally from New York but am a transplant here in South Jersey for the last 17 years. You can take the girl out of the city, but not the city out of the girl. Over the bridge and onto 440, then head East on the Staten Island Expressway. As I continue, I can see ahead in the distance the top of the arches of the Verrazano Narrows Bridge towering over the trees. With the sun just about up it is really a sight one should see at least once in a lifetime. When finally reaching the bridge the sun is positioned in such a way that the water beneath is glistening. As I make my way over the Verrazano Bridge, my windows are down, and the crisp clean air is rolling around in the car like a backseat filled with small children laughing. I then exit off onto 92nd Street and automatically make my way to 86th Street to do a little shopping before meeting some friends at Spumoni Gardens for lunch. When I arrived at Spumoni Gardens, I will be honest, I was taken back a little bit by what I had seen. A long building surrounded by a chain link fence which looked like to me a paved parking lot but had umbrella covered picnic tables corralled inside like a bunch of wild horses and trees coming through the sidewalk. There was also a walk up window outside where you can order their famous Spumoni Ice Cream. My first impression, it reminded me of an old carriage house where they used to keep horses. A pretty far cry from what I had envisioned. But once entering the doors I was doubly surprised by what I had seen. A section to the left for Ice Cream, directly in front of you the Pizza take out, then through a door to the right is the dining room with linens on the table. Right off of the dinning room is a huge, newly built Sun room. And yes, that used to be part of the corral of Picnic tables until the crowds had gotten so over whelming to dine in that it was transformed, and transformed beautifully into this solarium type of setting to accommodate more diners. With arches painted on the walls like an Italian Villa and soft music playing in the back round it was perfect.The menu had a wide variety of appetizers and entrees each one sounding better then the next. To start we had decided on the Pear and Walnut Salad. A combination of mixed salad greens and red onion topped with huge slices of Pecorino Romano cheese and Pears, then drizzled with a Balsamic Dressing and topped with candied walnuts. The combination was fresh, crisp and out of this world!! Our entrees consisted of Grilled Balsamic Glazed Chicken topped with Fresh Mozzarella and Red Roasted Peppers, Penne Vodka with Grilled Shrimp and Chicken Marsala. The chicken breast was marinated in balsamic vinegar and grilled until just done and fork tender, mozzarella that melted in your mouth & roasted red peppers that were done so right that you could taste the char on them. The penne pasta was cooked Al Dente and the vodka sauce was light, creamy and smooth with just a hint of vodka to taste and topped with eight large grilled to perfection shrimp, the chicken marsala was two chicken breasts that was obviously cooked in the marsala and mushrooms for just the right amount of time to where it was rich, buttery and like heaven to the palette. A vegetable melody accompanied the chicken marsala consisting of broccoli, zucchini, and baby carrots that were full of color and crisp to the bite. For dessert, of course, we had the Spumoni Ice Cream. The best I have ever had! Chocolate, Pistachio, and Cherry Ice Cream layered with fruit and nuts and a hint of Almond flavoring. There is really no reason to go anywhere else for this specialty. They have mastered it. Which leads me to believe they need to package it so everyone can have a taste. Here in Brooklyn there are all kinds of restaurants that have been in neighborhoods like this one for decades. Standing on old traditions, and homemade recipes from the old country they have lasted through the test of time and the ups and downs of the economy. Spumoni Gardens has been in Brooklyn on 86th Street for more than 70 years. I can understand now that old saying ""never judge a book by its cover"". After being there enjoying the great food and company of friends Spumoni Gardens has Brooklyn written all over it. With the corralled umbrella topped tables sitting on blacktop, the walk up Ice Cream window, the take out pizza and the dining room they have covered it all.

I politely mentioned to her that we've waited for a very long time and are very thirsty and would like some water. She said with a huge attitude: ""Well, did you ask for water?"". I said ""No, because noone came to our table yet"". She then said, ""well, we don't bring water until you actually place an order.

"Ok so this is Bensonhurst, an area of Brooklyn that really represents the true Brooklyn spirit.  I work right near this slice of heaven that they call L&B and people trek over from far distances for their pizza and Italian ices.  In the summer it is bustling, no where to park and people grabbing a slice and an ice and enjoying it outside on their picnic style tables.  I have only tried one thing here and that is their Square pie and I have to say I love it and actually crave it.  Its not your typical Square pizza.  They prepare it with sauce on top of the cheese and the dough is crispy not too doughy which I love.  I have heard really good things about their other food and my friends tell me that the Spumoni is out of this world.I will have to try it, but you really need to head over to 86th Street in Brooklyn and grab yourself a slice of heaven.  They also have a sit-down full restaurant that serves your classic Italian dishes like Lasagna, Manicotti, Calamari, Eggplant, Chicken, Veal Parm, etc. They have a parking lot and street parking and this time of year is better.They also take credit cards and do deliver but only to a few blocks within their area.  You will not be sorry!!!  But you might become addicted, so beware.",4.0
"I'm going to start off my illustrious and legendary Yelp career with a review of a place I could have reviewed when I was 10. Full disclosure: I have a sentimental attachment to L&B as my Grandma has always lived around the corner, and a love of the Sicilian pizza from L&B is pretty much genetic for me. To this day, whenever I visit, some squares come back with me. The same goes for the rest of my family. But sentimental attachment doesn't necessarily mean one is wrong, does it? Of course not, glad we agree. Look at some of the other reviews. I'm not alone here. This is the best Sicilian in NYC.It's not your typical slice. Heavy on sauce, light but sufficient with the cheese. The sauce is fantastic, the crust is crispy and buttery, and it's baked perfectly. You can not go wrong.As I tell anyone who's around, or even anyone passing through Brooklyn on the Belt: Go to L&B, get some squares, finish off with some rainbow spumoni, and you'll be enjoying life.",5.0

"Ok so this is Bensonhurst, an area of Brooklyn that really represents the true Brooklyn spirit.  I work right near this slice of heaven that they call L&B and people trek over from far distances for their pizza and Italian ices.  In the summer it is bustling, no where to park and people grabbing a slice and an ice and enjoying it outside on their picnic style tables.  I have only tried one thing here and that is their Square pie and I have to say I love it and actually crave it.  Its not your typical Square pizza.  They prepare it with sauce on top of the cheese and the dough is crispy not too doughy which I love.  I have heard really good things about their other food and my friends tell me that the Spumoni is out of this world.I will have to try it, but you really need to head over to 86th Street in Brooklyn and grab yourself a slice of heaven.  They also have a sit-down full restaurant that serves your classic Italian dishes like Lasagna, Manicotti, Calamari, Eggplant, Chicken, Veal Parm, etc. They have a parking lot and street parking and this time of year is better.They also take credit cards and do deliver but only to a few blocks within their area.  You will not be sorry!!!  But you might become addicted, so beware.",4.0
"I'm going to start off my illustrious and legendary Yelp career with a review of a place I could have reviewed when I was 10. Full disclosure: I have a sentimental attachment to L&B as my Grandma has always lived around the corner, and a love of the Sicilian pizza from L&B is pretty much genetic for me. To this day, whenever I visit, some squares come back with me. The same goes for the rest of my family. But sentimental attachment doesn't necessarily mean one is wrong, does it? Of course not, glad we agree. Look at some of the other reviews. I'm not alone here. This is the best Sicilian in NYC.It's not your typical slice. Heavy on sauce, light but sufficient with the cheese. The sauce is fantastic, the crust is crispy and buttery, and it's baked perfectly. You can not go wrong.As I tell anyone who's around, or even anyone passing through Brooklyn on the Belt: Go to L&B, get some squares, finish off with some rainbow spumoni, and you'll be enjoying life.",5.0

"Second time around and same impression.  I adore a great story and appreciate a great background, but this place lacks a great taste.  I won't even comment on the typical slice, but I will comment on the square slice.  This is more bearable than Staten Island's ""The Square"" in Grant City.  I think placing cheese before sauce prevents the dough from cooking thoroughly, so in that, it tastes odd.  L & B is not great slice or deserves the recognition it gets.",1.0

"Spumoni Gardens functions as both an eat-in Italian restaurant and pizzeria. I only took part in the latter (so far). Now again, this was a place that was hyped ahead of time. With 69 years under their belt though, I was willing to bite (no pun intended). Unlike some other popular establishments in Brooklyn, we were able to sit down immediately, despite the joint being someone crowded. The pizza was ready in a timely fashion. Now it was time to dig in.The pizza was indeed phenomenal. They have a very specific order of applying the ingredients and creating this pizza, but it works. I do have to admit, I hold Rosa's Pizza in extremely high regard. Going to any other pizza place in the city with talks of it being the best, I wave my Rosa's flag, ready to do battle. This place definitely made a believer out of me. Despite my bravado, I ended up eating about 4 slices of Sicilian. It was that damn good. I'm not from Brooklyn, but I would gladly take a ride out there again just for the pizza.",5.0

Thick Sicilian Crust with Sauce on top  instead of cheese. This place was pack when I got in.I got simply 2 slice of sicilian  and it was ok. I coudn't eat the 2nd slice.

"If I could only eat one slice of pizza for the rest of my life, it would have to be from here.  No really, it's that good.I went here for my brother's birthday party and we had a pretty big group.  After my mother's visit here, I only had one thing on my mind... the sicilian slice.When we got there, I split a delicious salad with my mother and father while everyone else was tearing up the bread that was placed on the table.  My brother, his girlfriend, and her friend ordered pasta dishes while the rest of us (me, mom, pop, other brother, brother's friend) were anticipating this masterpiece.  They bring it to the table and the aroma is intoxicating.  The marriage of cheese, garlic, oregano, and the yeast of the dough work their way up your nose and make you salivate profusely.  Not only does it smell delicious but it tastes even better!  The dough is light and airy, the mozzerella is fresh and creamy, and the sauce is enough to make you scream for joy.  I ate two slices and if not for my self conscious telling me to stop, I could have eaten another.Then I got a chance to taste my brother's Chicken Parmigiana.  It was awesome and a very generous helping.  You can't fake TLC in a restaurant and I know the people in the kitchen love what they are doing and what they are cooking up.We ordered the dessert platter which is enough for ten people.  It comes with ice cream, slices of spumoni, tartuffo, three kinds of cake (including a slice of tiramisu), and coevered in whipped cream and sprinkles.  Delightfully sweet and an excellent finish to an unforgettable meal.I cannot wait to get back there and eat their pizza until my heart's, and stomach's, content.",5.0
"Listen, this is more than just pizza, this is an experience. You don't go to L&B for a slice and a coke. You go for a couple of squares and some spumoni. Don't bother with the restaurant as that is there just as an angle to make more money. Their Italian food is mediocre at best. It's the squares you are after and should be most concerned with. And by squares, I am referring to their pizza. Call it anything else and you WILL be ignored. Asking for a  Sicilian instead of a square has just proved to all around you that you are NOT a local, probably a yuppie from north Brooklyn or, even worse, Manhattan, and you are 10 seconds away from getting rolled.You go up to the counter and tell the guy how many squares you want and how many pepsi's. No, they don't serve coke. Don't ask. You can also order half a tray (12 squares) or a full tray (24 squares). Feel free to take some home, they keep well for a couple days ONLY if you re-heat in an oven. If you use a microwave, you are an asshole. If you order a ""slice"", you are an asshole. If you try to order a pie, you are an asshole about to get rolled.The square, when properly prepared will have a thick crispy crust and will be drowned in their old school sauce. Underneath the sauce you will find most of their fresh cheese, with a little on top for good measure. It looks like a regular Sicilian. It's not. Most cheese on a Sicilian sits on top, like a regular slice. This is one of their hooks, along with the sauce, which you will NOT find anywhere else on the planet. Sit down and enjoy. Do a little people watching. You will quickly realize you are in a part of Brooklyn surrounded by real Brooklyn locals, with a smattering of Staten Island. You got your guineas, your mick's, your russian mobsters, gangsters and wannabe's from the nearby projects all in one place enjoying some of the best pizza in NYC. Keep your mouth shut unless you know what's good for you. These locals can smell fear and weakness from miles away, and you will be fuc*ed.When you are done with your squares, walk up to the Spumoni counter and get a couple scoops of the real deal. This is mothers milk to us Italians growing up in that neighborhood. Try it once at least. You don't have to love it, just give it a shot.

"First, I must disclose that I am a thin crust lover.  So venturing out of my comfort zone was something I don't usually like to do when it comes to pizza.  This was well worth it!  The square pizza was really tasy.  I loved how the bottom was crispy and the middle was oozing with a combo of cheese and dough.  The top had a sauce that was not too salty it may have been a bit sweeter than I like because I truly dislike pizza sauce that is sweet but I could live with it as the rest of the pizza made me very happy!  It was crazy busy so we ordered to go and ate at one of the to go booths.  The finishing touch was the ice cream counter.  The soft serve was really creamy and topped off a great dinner.",4.0

"Okay.  Let's get one thing straight.  Brooklyn doesn't make bad pizza.  The worst pizza in Brooklyn is still bound to be magically delicious.  So you can't really rate a Brooklyn pizzeria based on its slice alone.At a landmark like Spumoni's, you go not only for the spectacular pizza, but also for the experience.  Undoubtedly one of the most spacious pizzerias in the borough (if not the entire city), Spumoni's is known for its outdoor seating, ideal for grabbing a slice on a hot summer day.  The first time I went to Spumoni's was in high school with my boyfriend's family.  We took advantage of the outdoor seating, which unfortunately led to disaster.  As my boyfriend was sprinkling hot pepper on his slice, the summer Brooklyn breeze blew a great big grain of it right into his eye.After five solid minutes of tears and whining, the pepper was still there and he was forced to suck it up and go inside for assistance.  I'll always remember how kind the staff of Spumoni's was in taking care of my boo.I don't see that guy anymore, but my love affair with Spumoni's is still going strong.",4.0

Ok....we go on to order some broccoli in oil and garlic, calamari and of course the pie. First, the broccoli was simply amazing, extraordinary to be exact..not oily, perfect amount of garlic and the broccoli had a nice crunch. Next, the calamari was decent at best. Light and airy but too chewy for my liking...Finally, after waiting what seemed like forever, the pizza! We ordered half sausage, half extra cheese. Their sausage is great, thinly sliced, very flavorful. The pizza on the other hand was SUCH a let down. It was over powered with so much romano cheese that it made the slice just wayyyy too sweet! I'm not a fan of sugary sauces/pizza although some really enjoy it. I will say the Spumoni is out of this world though!To make a long story short, not impressed at all in regard to the sicilian. Spumoni and broccoli off the charts and the service could use a ton of improvement.

Pizza as it should be. Go on a hot summer day after a day at the beach just around dinner time and it might be one of the best experiences you could have. Go up to the counter and ask for a certain number of squares meaning sicilian slices and move to the side. One of the great things about this pizza is the fact that it is always fresh and right out of the oven.

Pretty good pizza...about 10 min drive from my home. They have a spacious outdoor seating area. Always crowded and their pizza is as good as it gets! Definitely worth your trip to Brooklyn for a slice or 2...or 3!,4.0
"Once I brought some out-of-town friends to pick up a pie.  They ordered it with pepperoni.  I didn't say anything.Later that evening, everyone who swung by the party 1) knew exactly where the pizza came from in 0.5 seconds and 2) could not understand why there were toppings involved.Ah, out-of-towners...Anyway, it's L&B, order a slice (using exactly that word, no more, no less:  ""Slice"") and shaddap.  Four stars because sometimes it's not a corner, and then I actually can admit there's better pizza out there.By the way, excellent heroes too -- especially when you add the broccoli rabe!",4.0

"L&B Spumoni Gardens has the best sicilian pizzas ever! I still cannot get over how amazing this pizza was. It was the best pizza I have ever had in my life so far...The sauce is so juicy and sweet, it is right on point. The crust is crunchy enough. The price is extremely fair. It has the most perfect amount of cheese...Bless this pizza!...Only reason it only gets a 4 is because the people working there should be a bit more welcoming and nice, then again they are old and have probably been working there their entire lives so I do not blame them as much. They should also try cleaning up a bit more,but then again, I guess they reserve their energy for the making of the amazing pizzas.",4.0

"Pretty overrated if you ask me. Had the square (Sicilian) slice. Nothing special at all and not really worth the trip unless you have a sentimental connection with the place or live in the area. The ambiance however is quite nice. You sit outdoors and talk to whomever is at your table. We had the pleasure of sitting with 3 Italian grandmas who recommended the spumoni, which was positively divine.",3.0
"Yes, yes believe it...they have the most unbelievable sicilian pizza. Considering the popularity of this place you would wonder why they still charge $2.25 (or $2.50?) for a slice. That's good old-fashioned, Brooklyn business right there! However, I'm giving them three stars because I'm taking away half a star for lack of parking spaces in the lot and around the area. You see cars double parked everywhere just to grab a slice. And the other 1 1/2 is taken away for the horrible pasta served in the restaurant. Sorry, but even I can make better pasta. Even a simple dish like spaghetti with sausage tasted BLAND. Sausage? Bland? How did they manage that?",3.0

Pizza as it should be. Go on a hot summer day after a day at the beach just around dinner time and it might be one of the best experiences you could have. Go up to the counter and ask for a certain number of squares meaning sicilian slices and move to the side. One of the great things about this pizza is the fact that it is always fresh and right out of the oven. Bottom line is they have been doing this pizza the same way for over 50 years don't ask for toppings or regular slices get a couple of squares and a pepsi and save room for the spumoni. Enjoy,5.0

"Round pie and thin crust fanatics may be apprehensive about the idea of Sicilian Pizza, but L and B's will put you to the test.

Greatest sicilian pie on planet earth!!!! I couldnt tell u what else they make or how good it is b/c who cares....Its all about the sicilian...when I worked in queens I would drive a 1/2 hr out of the way just for a slice..

"A lot of times when people say a place has the best pizza in New York, you go and you try it yourself and while it might be good, you can't help thinking that there still could be better. Not this. This lives up to all that hype.A typical Sicilian slice tends to have that Cap'n Crunch effect--the crust is so sharp and crumbly that it fucks up the roof of your mouth. The L&B slice is nothing like that. The crust is crisp on the bottom, chewy in the middle, and then the sauce-cheese-sauce thing will kill you. The sauce is perfect, just sweet enough, just rich enough. I always love a side or corner piece, but especially here, where that crust edge is flecked with Parmesan cheese that's gotten slightly burnt in the oven. Oh man! When you pull up in the parking lot, the smell is the first thing to get your mouth watering, and you won't leave thinking there is anything better out there.",5.0

"I actually sat down in the dining room here for the first time when I went on a date with a new beau (I still heart him) last Fall. We had a lovely, romantic, no-frills Sicilian-American style experience. Some may consider an atmosphere like Spumoni Gardens to be cheesy/borderline Jersey Shore in class factor. But that is exactly why I love it! Very old school, colorful, and not trying to be trendy. It is what it is. But it's kind of staple. I just love old neighborhood institutions like this - these kind of neighborhood family ethnic eateries require lots of effort to keep alive in a day where it's all about having it your way or being ultra trendy-hipster. I respect their ability to survive, stay basic, and stay kind of old skool no matter how kitschy (or any other descriptive term that may come to mind....I don't want to get too mean with the jokes) they are! Spumoni Gardens is classic and very colorful with all of the personality abound inside & out. It's a nice slice of the neighborhood. Going here for a date was awesome because the ambiance made me feel like we were actually living the movie ""My Cousin Vinny"" by choosing this place as a date destination to be all mushy & cutesy. The people dining around us were very entertaining, and kind of distracting - we kept speculating as to who was ""made"", who you wouldn't want to fuck with, whether any hits were ever made in this place, etc. The large tables of boisterous Bensonhurst families and their thick accents are part of the experience here.  Loved it.Oh yeah, the food. I've always waited a year for takeout in the past (I usually get entrees or sandwiches - I don't like their sicilian pizza - sorry to say), but sitting down in the dining room is different. The owner or manager is really really into making guests feel like family, and does little extra stuff for people to make them feel good & because he needs a lot of attention. You get huge portions. We doggy-bagged the leftovers, and that's a big deal for me to do. I would describe the food as a step up from very good pizza parlour entrees.

"This is hands down the best pizza in the world.  The scilian pizza is to die for.  The sauce has very good unique taste, and the crust isn't too puffy and is crunchy.  The cheese is on the bottom and then the sauce is spread on top of it.  Then on top of the sauce there is parmesian cheese sprinkled over it.  The slices look small but they fill you up very quick.  It only tastes good if you get a full or half of tray, it doesn't taste as good by the slice or reheated.  There is restaurant seating inside and tables for regular seating on the outside, which is great in the summer.  If you have any room after the pizza, I would recommend the spumoni,  or any of the ices.",5.0

"I've been to many pizzerias in my day, but I must say the one place where the taste of the food remains constant; no matter how many times you go is L&B's. It's a place where its cool to just come and chill out with your friends; over some amazing pizza.

"Okay, seriously I am a sucker for sweets and I usually prefer desserts over everything else. But here, at L&Bs, I don't even go for their spumonis or their ices. I go for their sicilian! Oh my god. Whenever I go here I have to resist myself from devouring more than 2 slices. I cannot begin to explain to you the awesomeness in this little 4x4inches of heaven. Let me start with the crust. The crust is sooooo soft, not chewy, and has a crunch on the bottom. Some people say it tastes undercooked, but its not! They are probably talking about the cheese that is perfectly melted on top of the dough that literally fuses together and makes the dough extra soft and melty. Then comes the tangy sauce splattered on top of the cheese. I did not know that a bread, tomato, and cheese could taste so good together. Believe the hype! I live in Queens and I haul myself to Brooklyn ever now and then just for their sicilian slices. I've always wanted to try their regular slices too but I could never get myself to get one because I can never risk wasting a space in my stomach when I know there can be a sicilian in there instead.",5.0

The atmosphere is great and eating outside when it's warm and sunny in Brooklyn makes it worth the experience. I know I may be in the minority here but I really don't care for the pizza.

"Okay, seriously I am a sucker for sweets and I usually prefer desserts over everything else. But here, at L&Bs, I don't even go for their spumonis or their ices. I go for their sicilian! Oh my god. Whenever I go here I have to resist myself from devouring more than 2 slices. I cannot begin to explain to you the awesomeness in this little 4x4inches of heaven. Let me start with the crust. The crust is sooooo soft, not chewy, and has a crunch on the bottom. Some people say it tastes undercooked, but its not! They are probably talking about the cheese that is perfectly melted on top of the dough that literally fuses together and makes the dough extra soft and melty. Then comes the tangy sauce splattered on top of the cheese. I did not know that a bread, tomato, and cheese could taste so good together. Believe the hype! I live in Queens and I haul myself to Brooklyn ever now and then just for their sicilian slices. I've always wanted to try their regular slices too but I could never get myself to get one because I can never risk wasting a space in my stomach when I know there can be a sicilian in there instead.",5.0

"Out of this world.  Best square slices anywhere; dynamite sauce, perfectly under-cheesed.  Haven't even bothered to try to food inside -- it'd be hard to top a couple squares and a cup of spumoni.  Whenever I'm in the city, I'm giving myself a couple hours to take the train out to Bensonhurst and grab a bite.  It's worth the 45-minute train ride.",5.0
The atmosphere is great and eating outside when it's warm and sunny in Brooklyn makes it worth the experience. I know I may be in the minority here but I really don't care for the pizza.

"how can i not give L&B 5 stars? I have been there so many times since moving to Brooklyn. Their dining is great. Every dish has been delicious.

"The pizza is OK.  I mean the sauce is a lil tangy and the cheese is very fresh but I cant help but notice that its a lot of dough. The bread part of the pizza is very thick and it tasts almost like a foccacia texture.  That being said it is still pretty solid.  WHat is great about L and B's is their other dishes, such as pasta and sandwiches.  Their pastas are DELICIOUS and they give u MONSTER PORTIONS.  Try their steak sandwich which is to die for.  Last but not least is their sweets, the ices and spumoni are world class but my favorite thing there is the peanut butter chunk ice cream.  Id definitely come back to this place but as for the pizza, DIFARA STILL REIGNS SUPREME IN MY BOOK.",4.0

"i actually haven't had the pizza at all, but the rest of the food was really good.  came with a party of like 15 and they were able to accommodate us despite the fact that it was ridiculously busy, which was nice.  it was a bit crowded but the service was good and definitely some of the better italian food i've had in a while.",4.0

"One of my faves...Just gimme a Sicilian half tray and I eat it myself. There is hardly a wait there either. They do so much volume that there is always a Sicilian pie comming out. Don't eat the round pie there, thats not what you go there for.  You must get some Spumoni or Creamalotta..Thay have the best!!AL-G",5.0

"I have never had anything but the squares and spumoni ice cream from L&B. I have no idea how the other food tastes. But I am sure it is decent. Although, I can't imagine why you would come to L&B and not get the squares. Wouldn't you be tempted? L&B has the best squares I have ever had. The sauce is absolutely delicious, the crust is not too chewy and not too crunchy and the little sprinkle of grated cheese is perfect. It is the perfect summertime pizzeria. I love the outdoor seating and the fast service. You go up to one of the windows, order your pizza and beverage then go sit. After eating about 3 squares, I head over to the other window to buy some spumoni ice cream. It is so good....vanilla, chocolate and pistachio, you can't go wrong. Bonus...there are little bits of pistachio in it. Mmmm...",5.0

"L & B Spumoni Gardens is a treasured Brooklyn institution, a piece of my childhood, and without a doubt purveyors of the best square slice of pizza on the planet (although L & B calls it a Sicilian). The square slice is the one of the best known signature foods at L & B; the way it's prepared is unlike any other square slice you've ever experienced. And then of course is the spumoni. I suppose people are more aware of gelato as the frozen Italian treat, but if you've ever had spumoni you'd be a fan. And if you've ever had exceptional spumoni, you've had it at L & B or from L & B. They don't call it ""Spumoni Gardens"" for nothing.  The service is nice and they prepare some nice pasta dishes and a pretty good chicken parmigiana too. But if it's atmosphere you're looking for, the L & B Spumoni Gardens is probably not your first choice. They have a restaurant, but it is a bit shabby, and most of their seating is outdoors on picnic tables. You should probably have them deliver a Sicilian pie, and a spumoni cake for dessert. You will not be disappointed.Overall I'm rating the food. They have a decent round slice too, but it's the spumoni dessert and the Sicilian slices are as good as you'll ever have it.",5.0

nobody serves an upside down sicilian like L&B's can! which is probably why you'll find a long line even on a Tuesday night. Their regular slices are nothing spectacular though.

I remember once when we ate in and placed our orders and waited for seriously all of 10-15 minutes (considered normal for the busy weekends) for our calamari appetizer and the boss lady herself came by our table to apologize saying that the kitchen missed our order because it was so busy. We hardly even noticed! Our waiter then came out like a minute later with a meat and rotini appetizer ON THE HOUSE as an apology for making us wait. That's awesome service there!  I haven't been around the area for a while now but all the times I've gone in the past, the food and company was always great and I just love the atmosphere.

"The place is loud... and crowded!  I felt as if I was sharing a table with the couple next to me our tables were so close.  Also the waiters are all over the place.  Nonetheless, the atmosphere is lively and that's because people are enjoying their food and in the end, isn't that the most important thing?",3.0
"I'm lucky enough to live just a few blocks from L&B Spumoni, and everyone I know who's ever been there is outrageously jealous. Two squares (from the edge, please) and a diet Pepsi for five bucks? Argh, heaven! And the restaurant is great, too. The calamari appetizer is gigantic, with a crisp, light breading giving way to tender, never chewy calamari. The salads are out of control, too - so huge that you could share them as an entree, and always fantastic. (My favorite is the grape tomato salad, with walnuts, dried dates, raw zucchini and ricotta salata, though their Caesar is seriously the best I've ever had.) The waiters are uneven - some can be cold, though most have gone out of their way to make us feel at home. If you're ordering dessert in the restaurant for a birthday or something, let them know it's a special occasion - you'll probably get a gigantic platter of spumoni decorated with whipped cream, cherries and enough sprinkles to choke a horse.",5.0

"This is about as Brooklyn as you can get! I mean...we're talking the real Brooklyn Italian experience here.  You can either grab a slice from the pizza line and sit outside on warm summer nights, or stop at the hot food counter and get some calamari and a hero for your picnicing pleasure. But the true experience comes in the dining room. Portions enough to feed a family of four (and thats just on the appetizers) and prices reasonable enough to keep you coming back again and again.  I highly highly reccomend the pear salad.  Microgreens, fresh pears, candied walnuts and your choice of cheese (go with the ricotta salata)! Order with the intent to share. That pasta bowl probably has a full pound of pasta in there.  Chicken or Veal Parmigianna? Yeah baby! Be prepared for leftovers! Or you can do what my family loves to do. Go in and get a salad (pear or orange, or an order of mussles...or fried calamari or....) and then get a pizza at your table.  Fresh and hot from the oven, thin crust, good quality mozzerella and tomatoes... And of course your meal won't be complete without a lemon ice or (of course) a Spumoni that they make right there at the resturant. Spumoni Gardens is a true Brooklyn institution. Its the perfect stop on your way home from a day in Coney Island! Come on out to Benshonhurst and enjoy!",5.0
"THIS is Sicilian pizza!  I hate overly-cheesy pizza, and the pizza here has the perfect sauce-to-cheese ratio.  The dough is pillowy, but not heavy, in other words, perfect.  I didn't even eat anything else; I didn't need to.  The pizza is enough to satisfy any craving for pizza if you are a fan of the Sicilian slice.  A quintessential summer experience.  Just go!",5.0
nobody serves an upside down sicilian like L&B's can! which is probably why you'll find a long line even on a Tuesday night. Their regular slices are nothing spectacular though. Their spumoni is awesome and they are generous with their scoops of icee too. Also picked up an eggplant parm and chicken parm--they were HUGE and damn good. The perfect place for a laid back summer evening in Bk.,5.0
"The pizza and spumoni at L&B are fantastic.  I've even had birthday cakes made there... out of spumoni...mmmm.  The crowd is comprised of a bunch of Brooklyn meatheads & bimbos, but do your business & do it quick there.  I recommend you stay away from the indoor restaurant, as it has never pleased me or my company, but I cannot say enough about the pizza.",5.0
"I absolutely love this place! Their square slices really are ALL THAT! There's usually a long line of people waiting outside for their slices, especially in the summertime. Nearby FDNY frequents this place so often they are there everytime I am, which works for me..eye candy! I have had great memories everytime I visit and eat in in their restaurant. I remember once when we ate in and placed our orders and waited for seriously all of 10-15 minutes (considered normal for the busy weekends) for our calamari appetizer and the boss lady herself came by our table to apologize saying that the kitchen missed our order because it was so busy. We hardly even noticed! Our waiter then came out like a minute later with a meat and rotini appetizer ON THE HOUSE as an apology for making us wait. That's awesome service there!  I haven't been around the area for a while now but all the times I've gone in the past, the food and company was always great and I just love the atmosphere.
