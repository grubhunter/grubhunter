"Somehow, before I moved to New York, I wasn't a pizza person. Thanks to places like this, I'm a true believer. I sipped on my favorite Bourbon at the bar while we waited to be seated - this place is popular so expect a wait, but don't be discouraged by it. They will text you when your table is ready.We started with the garlic bread - round, large and wood fired just like the pizzas. It had a great kick to it. My fiance ordered the Four Cheese Pepperoni Pizza, but with red sauce, and I ordered the Arugula Pizza with proscuitto. To say we devoured them was an understatement. And that crust! Heaven.Great atmosphere, amazing food & drinks -- Barboncino won my heart.",5.0
"We finally stopped in for brunch at 12:30pm to find absolutely no wait, shocking given the uniformly rave reviews. The Pancetta/egg/cheese was quite satisfying, albeit a bit heavy-handed.The nutella calzone, unfortunately, was mostly unfilled/underfilled/hard to cut dough, and absolutely ruined by Hershey's syrup glazing and overpowering the entire thing. They also didn't have the foresight to bring it out after/separately, so it was lukewarm by the time we got to it.Keep an eye out for Happy-hour drinks and pizza deals",4.0
Great arugula pizza! Pepperoni is awesome too. The only reason they're getting 3 stars is because EVERY TIME I come here for brunch they're out of like half the menu. It's really annoying.,3.0
"Ain't nobody saying no to pizza. Not today people. On a very starving day, I ran into Barboncino to get myself some brick oven deliciousness. I was not disappointed. Ordered a regular pie and an eggplant pie. (Yes I like my pies -- Don't judge)From the moment I ordered it until execution and in my heads was mere minutes. No wait time, no hassle and super friendly person taking my order. They pies were amazing. Crispy crust, non soggy dough, perfect amount of cheese to sauce ratio. Absolute perfection. I can't wait to come back and try some other dishes they offer.",5.0
"It is my opinion that Barboncino's is the best pizza I've ever had.That Arugula pizza with the hot oil! Delicious!Great atmosphere, the wait staff can sometimes be a little hit or miss. During the summer the patio is nice, though there used to be an abundance of flies.",5.0
"Lovely crusty & flavorful pizza. Some would say ""Even better than Italy!"" A real cozy treat.",5.0
"Amongst all the other great spots in this blooming Brooklyn neighborhood , Check out barboncino for authentic Italian  . Fine dining atmosphere, paired with good pizza , and a list of fine Italian wines , in Brooklyn?  Not something you'll come across often . Good place for a date night , and if you come super hungry like I did . Order the pizza pane, drizzled with rosemary oil! Really tasty and gets to the table fast! Service is great as well, my server Steven was able to answer all my menu questions and was patient with me while I made my wine selection! Will be back soon!",5.0
"Pretty solid Margherita pie! Mozz had a good texture, wasn't too greasy, crust wasn't too burnt. I have certainly had better pizza in Brooklyn but still a good place to satisfy your pizza craving. Did take out (ready in 10 minutes) because there was an hour wait to sit inside. The ambiance seemed very cozy and cute though. This was around 8pm on a Saturday night by the way. I am sure you can get a table easier on other nights. Friendly service. Definitely worth a stop if you are in the neighborhood.",4.0
"I love, love Barboncino! I've been here for dinner, the Free Brunch, late-night pizza at the bar and yeah, it has been delicious every time. The staff is friendly. The wine is good. The pizza is some of the best I've had-- chewy crust, yummy cheese and tasty toppings. I'll be back very soon!",5.0
"Best dinner spot. Very dimly lit, there are single tables and cafeteria style tables to sit. The music is quiet or non-existent so the place doesn't get too loud. It's cozy. It's romantic. It's perfect.They have a bar section that is visibly separate from the restaurant. This is a great place to grab one of their cocktails (strong and flavorful), draft beers or a glass of wine while you wait for a table. If you get lucky and go early or on an off night (weekdays, typically), you can sit down without a stop at the bar.The wine list is small but in my non-wine-expert opinion, still great. Their cocktail list is plentiful with many different options to choose from, and they have a group of draft beers as well. But the real killer is the wood fire pizza. The Arugula pizza is like a delicious salad atop flat bread, the Neapolitan Meatball is a wonderful mix of basic pizza with insanely flavorful crumbles of meatballs spread on top. The food is finger licking, ""ooooh ahhhh"" screaming good.To quote Nike so eloquently, ""Just do it."" Enjoy.",5.0
"Ordered: Artichoke and pancetta pizzaPros--The pizza had a nice char to the crust. The ingredients tasted very fresh, and the tart artichoke and savory pancetta was a great combo. The staff was very friendly. Cons--The tables were too close together where it was difficult to enter and exit my seat. The pizza was in need of a light layer of sauce (maybe pesto) and less oil (as it significantly dripped off the slices).",4.0
"This place is fantastic. A little pricey, but the food and drinks are worth it.Definitely sit at the bar and order a drink while you wait for the table. The sazerac is great! Very good quality cocktail selection and wine list.I had the margherita pizza and my boyfriend and friend had the soppressata picante. We were all extremely satisfied (and full). The waiter recommended a great, reasonably priced bottle of wine that would go with both pizzas. Besides the food and drink, the restaurant is beautiful inside. I would honestly have a wedding reception there- pizza for all!",5.0
"Thank you to the incredible staff who put up with 15 of us rowdy kids on a Tuesday night! (And for dealing with us obnoxiously celebrating a birthday boy.) The pizza was delicious, the garlic bread was so delectable, and the party room in the basement was lit. Service was on point and fast.",5.0
"Lately I've been on a hunt for the perfect pizza that is doughy yet crispy in all the right places with toppings that blend evenly in every bite. And a menu that's full of staples but just different enough to make it difficult for me to decide what to order. That's usually not the case for me. I'm a classic pizza kind of gal and although often tempted I can't help but order a good Margherita because I just love it so. Yes I know I'm probably missing out on a lot of good pizzas out there, but a lot of pizza places get so over zealous with their menus it's down right overwhelming and well, for crying out loud it's a pizza! Next to a sandwich it's literally one of the most basic foods in history. It should not have ten toppings. It just shouldn't! Barboncino gets it right all around. They get the classic stuff right (yes I ordered the Margherita). Not too saucy and not too cheesy, it was melt your heart and fior di latte satisfying. The Arugula pizza was great too. Sometimes, greens on a pizza kinda feels like you are eating a garden (not a salad - but the garden) and at first glance I was little worried that would happen here, but it didn't! The mix of garlic, parmigiano regianno, and olive oil brought it all together. Our waiter said the Piazza was the most popular cocktail so I gave it try. I took one sip and I cut my friend off mid-sentence and made him try it. It might have been one of my favorite cocktails I've had all summer. The ginger beer isn't overpowering (which would have turned me off from first sip) and it had just a hint of sweetness to it. It was just enough to make it a really good summer drink. Overall, I'm a fan and would definitely return to Barboncino in a heart beat. Especially with some friends for a lunch/early dinner where we could share some pizzas and chat before the late evening crowd fills the place up.",4.0
"Really cool space with a nice bar and nice cocktails. The pesto with white beans is superb. I'm not a fan of Neapolitan-style pizza, and I found the meatballs to be too densely packed the one time I had them. Other people I know love this place, so I wouldn't let my negatives dissuade you from going. The staff is really nice, and ""barboncino"" means poodle in Italian, which is cute.",4.0
"Their arugula pizza is amazing. They have good choices of beers on tap and I like their hostesses. Loved my server the first time I was here, full of personality. My second time, this past weekend, our server was nice but I could tell he was annoyed that we didn't order more. Oh well! I don't care, I'll be a new regular since I'm in the neighborhood and love their pizza and vibe. The bar was crowded and only had one bartender on the Friday night. I love their outdoor space in the back during warmer months!",5.0
"Barboncino is certainly among New York's elite pizzerias. The crust has an absolutely perfect char. It has an incredible balance between doughiness and crunchiness. I can't ask for much more out of the crust. We ordered an artichoke and smoked pancetta pie. It was a white pizza without sauce. I think the ingredients were very well executed without a tomato sauce; however, I would have ordered a different pie with tomato sauce in retrospect. Regardless, it was one of the better white pizzas that I've had.Barboncino offered an interesting selection of appetizers including roasted peppers and meatballs. They also have some interesting desserts, most notably a nutella banana calzone.I'd rate it four and a half stars.",4.0
"5/5 for ambience and food. Service varies. We had an amazing server for dinner, but a terrible server for brunch even though it was half empty. Recommend : sausage/funghi pizza and sopressata pizza. Hungry just thinking about it!!!",4.0
Really yum pizza place in Crown Heights. The restaurant itself is cute and comfortable- perfect for an anytime meal. I went around 330pm on a Sunday and it was suprisingly busy. We ordered: Sopressata Picante pizza- this is the star. MUST HAVE WITH HONEY. Seriously dont miss this point. Cremini and Sausage: this one was less exciting. Still good but the above was better. Cant wait to come back and try more!Service is tops.,5.0
"I was first introduced to Barbo's over a year ago by a good friend who lives only blocks away. Based upon my experiences and tastes, I am giving Barbo's 5 Stars. Their pizza is some of the best I have EVER had. I'm sorry DiFara, Barbo's pizza can hang. Barbo's does pizza right!Whenever I am in the area visiting friends, we make it a point to have at least one meal there. I have had just more than their pizza on the menu. The meatballs? Forget about it! They are crazy good. They are so moist and filled with flavor. Meat isn't your thing, well don't you worry. The white bean and pesto or the cheese slate with garlic bread are both dreamy. I love the hot oil that is a fixture on their tables. Dousing my pizza with the oil elevates the goodness of their pizza. The bar area is probably my favorite part of the restaurant. It is small, but very intimate. I love the low lighting and candles, it adds to the ambiance. Their cocktails are hand crafted and super delicious. There are hundreds of pizza places in Brookyln I could go to for pizza, but I wouldn't have it any other way...Barbo's all the way!",5.0

"There's no denying that Barboncino makes a fantastic pizza.  After having eaten there at least 50 times, you can take my word for it.If you come to Barboncino, you can expect to get consistently good pizza, tasty cocktails that change seasonally, and a small collection of rotating beers (Peroni always available along with a few local beers).  The ambiance is what I think of as quintessential Brooklyn (think low light, exposed brick, purposely unfinished touches, unvarnished wood and iron).  The service staff is friendly and delivers seamless service.The specifics:Every morning, on my way to work, I walk by and see the dough guy in there making millions of balls of dough that will eventually become the perfectly chewy pizza crust that evening.  That guy is a hero.  At the heart of Barboncino is a wood-fire oven that takes that dough and cooks it to leopard-spotted, chewy, salty perfection in about 3 minutes.  They have about 8 pizzas on the menu.  These have never changed in the three years they have been open.  Having tried all the pizzas (multiple times), here are my favorites:- Eggplant and Zucchini pie ($14):  This red pie has thinly sliced eggplant and zucchini on top of a red pie and is sprinkled liberally with garlic.  It's my go-to pie.  Be forewarned, you'll still be tasting the garlic in the morning.- Arugula pie ($14, +$4 with prosciutto):  This is like a white pie with an arugula salad on top.  In case you felt like both a salad and a pizza, this is a good option.  You can get the prosciutto if you MUST have meat at every meal (and I totally understand this sentiment) but I don't think it adds all that much to an already delicious pie.- Meatball pie ($15): They have great meatballs here.  Soft and moist (hero from above also makes the meatballs, I think) and seasoned very well.  They are crumbled on top of a red pie and topped with some basil.  - Any special pie they have that night (usually around $17): After having the same 8 pies on the menu, any variety is good.Honorable mentions go to the mushroom and sausage and the soppressata pies.  Pro-tip:  The lines here are long.  The bar is first come so try to snag a seat there.  It's the best seat in the house anyway because the bartenders are awesome.  Oh!

"This is a take out review, just heads up!On a long trip home, we walked by this place after getting off the subway. It was in my Yelp bookmarks for months, and I was finally happy for a chance to try this place. We popped in, placed an order, and we had two piping hot pizzas within 10 minutes. The guys working at the counter were quick and efficient. After a quirk scurry home, we flipped the lids to our pizza boxes, and heaven was found inside.I'd imagine that straight out of the oven, the pizza here is absolutely divine, and even after a 15 minute walk home, the pizza is STILL amazing. Creamy, fresh mozzarella and sweet tomatoes made for a beautiful margherita pizza. I didn't even nab a slice of my boyfriend's pizza--we both scarfed them down quickly.10 out of 10, I'll be coming back here again.Update--yes, I've been back a couple times since that initial heavenly visit. This is likely one of my top favorite places in Crown Heights. The warm decor and fantastic happy hour makes this a go-to place when my boyfriend and I want to get out of the apartment. $3 draft Peronis! The servers here are really great and attentive, and as to be expected, the pizzas are the best straight out of the oven. We've since tried the meatball, the soppressata pizza, and the white pizza special. You can't go wrong with any of these.",5.0
This place does two things well-Great service.Great Nutella Calzone.What I didn't find too impressive was the pizza. The artichoke w/ smoked pancetta pizza was overcooked. The crust was dry and hard to chew on. The texture of the cheese wasn't great either. It was firm and not nicely melted.The Arugula pizza with sausage was the special of the day and that was decent. Nothing too impressive though.Would give it a while before I come back to try this place again.,3.0

I wouldn't have ever imagined many years ago seeing a brick oven pizza spot on Franklin Avenue but this place fits perfectly into this growing neighborhood. This place has a nice little wine selection which is always a plus. For apps we tried the meatballs which were very good. For our pizza selection we decided to go with the arugula pizza. The arugula was very fresh and a nice touch to the pizza. I enjoyed the food and wine but it was boiling hot in there! I was literally sweating it was so incredibly hot. We wanted to have more drinks but after eating decided that it was best to just keep it moving and go to another spot. I don't know if it was because we were sitting so close to the brick oven but that still shouldn't be the case. Hope this place can pump up the AC before the summer is over!,4.0

"I went to this restaurant a few years ago right after it opened and I enjoy the pizza but I forgot exactly where I was  (i was on a really bad date and wanted to forget everything about it except for the food). Tonight I was hungry and was looking for something good, a real pizza not that crazy $1 - $2 slice foolishness.  So while perusing pizzerias, i found this joint.  Hopped on a bus to another bus, and called ahead of time to confirm the hours for the kitchen (which was about to close at 1am).  Upon my arrival, they immediately made my pizza in served it to me less than 10 minutes at a table with water.  Friendly workers and all.Pizza: (the margherita) All I can say is..... fantastic & fresh.  It even had a hint of buttery goodness hidden between the cheese, sauce and crust. I think I ate too much but i can walk that off.I will be back with my bf next time.",5.0

However he comes over to our table has a chat with us and we automatically knew what we wanted to order, the Napolean Meatballs, 1 peroni beer, and 1 coke. with individuals pies for myself and my boyfriend. As we wait for the appetizer (the meatballs) we mentioned to adam we would like to order some bread which he came back with 5-8 mins later, STILL NO MEATBALLS and as im eating the bread I call adam over and my boyfriend asks him what is the hold up with the meatballs, and his answer was ""meatballs?"" and my boyfriend was like yes the meatballs we ordered for appretizer to have with the bread, and he says ""omg i am so sorry i completely forgot"" and no offense for a saturday night is was not busy, there were still empty tables around. At that point I was just so turned off because I love this place. then when we get out pizza my boyfriend finishes his beer and Adam comes over and says oh how is everything and my boyfriend says good can i have another peroni? and Adam says ""of course""...5 mins later.....10 mins later. Still no beer. After he eats his pizza and drinks water (which he didnt want he wanted his beer) Adam comes over to see how is everything and my boyfriend says its ok man but you never bought me my beer and I didnt enjoy my pizza as much. Again ""omg i am so sorry i completely forgot, its been a long day"" no offense we all have our long days but I dont need to hear that as the customer, its not my problem.. Overall we did not like the service this time around and it will be a while that me and my boyfriend will back here. Thanks Adam but if you cant remember someones order than working in a restaurant is not for you.",2.0
"On my last visit to New York City we stopped at multiple places searching for the best margherita pizza and this was my favorite. Thin crust, light sauce, ripe thinly sliced tomatoes, crisp basil, fresh fior di latte mozzarella cheese, with a light coating of extra virgin olive oil made this one great pizza. It felt a little more upscale with a cocktail bar and nice decor, but nothing you have to dress up to visit. There were 4 of us and each one of us ordered something different and each one of us were moaning with each bite. I am sure the people around us were very uncomfortable. They sat us at a bench table next to the entrance so they may have lost some customers that night.It was pretty packed for a Thursday evening so you may end up waiting but we were seated and served quickly but our waitress was not the most friendly person. Its okay the pizza made me forget about pretty much everything else in life for a few minutes. I cannot speak to better pizza but you cant go wrong if you are in the neighborhood and looking for a true margherita pizza is what you are looking for.",5.0
"Say what you will about this place - I love it. Good pizza, beautiful spacious interior. Nice bar. I don't have endless money to eat out, so when I go to a nice place - it has to count! This will be the first place I suggest to anyone who wants to go out and have a nice sit-down dinner.",5.0
"Such a cute, warm place. We kinda just randomly walked in and so glad we did, because this place is bomb. The lighting was perf. Lots of seating. My sister got the artichoke and pancetta pie and I got the sopressata and basil. Both were very good, but felt like they overdid the salt. The amount of water I drank that night was crazy. Even though it took me two full days to get rid of my garlic breath, and almost suffocated from my sister's SBD farts...I would return. I want to try the other options. And I actually really liked that place. Too bad we didn't have any room for dessert though. They had a lot of options.",4.0
I try to go here once per week the pizza is great if u like brick oven style and the hot oil that's on the table is bomb.  Also I love the root beer floats with salted caramel gelato!! Sometimes there is a wait but that's because this place is awesome also they are open until 1am!! Great for dates,5.0
Excellent ambience for a date night or just with friends. Their pizza is one of the best in Brooklyn and they have great happy hour beer. My favorite is the four cheese with pepperoni! Definitely go here on Tuesday night when they have live jazz!,5.0
"YAAAAAASSSSSSS. This place is so good. My friend and I ordered the clam pizza and the artichoke and pancetta pizza. They were both incredible. Things that were awesome:1. The crust: pillowing, yet not chewy or doughy. the perfect vehicle for a delicious pizza.2. Toppings: This place does not skimp. There was legit half an artichoke on each slice, and my cup runneth over with pancetta. 3. Our server was extremely attractive. Like crazy hot. And besides that, he was really attentive, but not clingy. In conclusion, Hot dude feeding you delicious pizza while making sure you have everything you need but giving you some space for your friends.  If you are single, I highly recommend going to check out THAT whole situation.",5.0
"Delicious. One of my favorite pizza places, as their style is my idea of a perfect pizza (and is woodfire!!! YES). We came here on a Saturday night and had about a 30 minute wait - but keep in mind this was in the winter so their backdoor space wasn't being used at the time. The bar area was a little crowded with others waiting, but not a big deal - this was to expected. We were seated in a corner and ordered a bottle of wine, salad and a pizza. We probably should've just ordered 50 pizzas. I'll be writing another review soon - as I'm moving just down the street and will be back!",4.0
"Update: I really liked this place before. Now, I LOVE it. One reason: Steve. The waiter Steve is incredible. I do not know him. He didn't ask me to do this, but it's so refreshing to not only get good good but incredible service. I was never outwardly impressed with the service before and I gave up eating pizza so I haven't been around, but I just stopped in to grab the delicious Nutella calzone and Steve was my waiter....totally awesome. If you ever get rid of Steve, the Nutella calzones will not be worth me coming back. Guys, go here for the good food...keep coming back for the service like Steve provided. Friendly, efficient, great listener, awesome person.",5.0
"I went to this restaurant a few years ago right after it opened and I enjoy the pizza but I forgot exactly where I was  (i was on a really bad date and wanted to forget everything about it except for the food). Tonight I was hungry and was looking for something good, a real pizza not that crazy $1 - $2 slice foolishness.  So while perusing pizzerias, i found this joint.  Hopped on a bus to another bus, and called ahead of time to confirm the hours for the kitchen (which was about to close at 1am).  Upon my arrival, they immediately made my pizza in served it to me less than 10 minutes at a table with water.  Friendly workers and all.Pizza: (the margherita) All I can say is..... fantastic & fresh.  It even had a hint of buttery goodness hidden between the cheese, sauce and crust. I think I ate too much but i can walk that off.I will be back with my bf next time.",5.0

"Went here for a date night. Had a 45 minute wait on a Saturday night so decided to sit at the bar until we were called. (Side note: you can eat at the bar if you like but we just preferred a table.) Any ways, the restaurant is on ""Nowait"", in which you can see exactly how many people are in front of you waiting to dine which is pretty cool. Once we got our table we were greeted pretty promptly & since we had time at the bar we knew exactly what we wanted and ordered. We had the meatball appetizers which were so tender. We then had the arugula pizza w/prosciutto & four cheese pizza w/pepperoni. Can we please have a moment of silence for the four cheese pizza w/pepperoni please? Granted the arugula pizza was good but the four cheese pizza was to dieeee for.... My mouth is watering as I speak of it. Good service, good food. Definitely will be back.",5.0
"Hello, Fancy Pizza!An old friend was coming in from out of town for a conference and I wanted to give her a taste of New York. This meant pizza. Since I was giving her a ride to the airport, we needed to meet up in Brooklyn. The usual suspects (i.e., Grimaldi's) would have meant a really long line and difficulty in finding parking, plus Ben and I had a lot stuff that we had to get done before dinner, so we were thinking of going to someplace closer to our home. Barboncino fit the bill nicely. It's trendy and fancy enough to impress someone, but not stuffy. The interior has exposed brick walls, reclaimed wood and pipe, and the style is industrial chic. You feel that you could wear a pair of nice jeans there and fit in. I really enjoy their pizza. Each pizza is a thin crust personal pizza. The crust is nicely blistered from the oven and topped with good quality ingredients. It is sliced into quarters and 3/4s of a pizza is enough to fill me up. They make gelato there as well. The hazelnut was delicious. I loved the sweet nutty flavor. The staff is lovely. Very kind and considerate. Barboncino is a good date place.",4.0
"Cool ambiance!! ...I had the meatball pizza and it was decent, the overall pizza was good, but due to the meatball's small size, you really don't get a chance to experience the flavor of the meatball...but the 2 stars which would have been 1,  but the ambiance and pizza taste saved the review . My waiter service was not good at all. I saw the waiter once after I ordered and that's when he gave me my pizza, and after sitting with a finished plate, he finally comes over and I ask for the check. Then after waiting, I realized he never comes for check, and I walk up to the front to pay for it.

"I order the pizza out a lot so I can't say really about other food or dining + ambience stuff - although it is a very chic, dimly lit place. I always find the curtain is super annoying to go through every time I enter the door.I've tried the margherita most recently and it was really soggy (pizza's tasty no matter what) but it was liquid-y. Arugula (without prosciutto is better imo) is my favorite and the greens really help cut some of the fattiness. So I've had this one a couple of times.And lastly I've tried the artichoke & smoked panchetta - definitely the oiliest of all three. If you like panchetta or bacon, you'll like this. In general the pizzas are pretty small and like $12-17. I could probably eat an entire one EASILY if I wanted to - but I wouldn't because they're usually pretty greasy (and I'm talking about in comparison to domino's or papa john's etc). If my brother didn't like it so much (he doesn't mind the oiliness one bit), then I probably would get my pizza elsewhere.",3.0
"This place has a ridiculously romantic ambiance. In the best way possible.Rustic brick walls, wood tables and chairs, and ultra-sexy lighting, but in a very warm, cozy, relaxing atmosphere. It's the perfect date spot, or even a quiet dinner with a couple friends. Ordered a Soppressata Piccante pizza to share and drinks. I asked for a non-alcoholic hot apple cider that was tasty, but was definitely NOT non-alcoholic. Not complaining though. The pizza hit the spot. First of all, the crust qualifies as thin crust, yet has more heft and crunch than most other places. You can actually lift the slice without the toppings sliding off! It does seem that there could be a tad more cheese and sauce, but what's on there tastes great. Same with the soppressata. Delicious, but needs some more! (My inner Oliver Twist comes out.)It's hard to rank this place among the other pizza places, because it's distinct enough on its own. But I would definitely recommend this place to others.",4.0
"Did a half and half pizza: artichoke with pancetta & four cheese pepperoni and it was delicious! Also try the burrata cheese, so good!!

Great Pizza done properly meatballs a bit tough would prefer a softer style... Get the Clams pizza and add the lemon at the end and it will hit all your taste buds from buttery to zesty to crunchy to chewy...If their appetizer were better I would give 5 star but brick oven pizza is one of the BEST in NYC,4.0
"Excellent pizza; maybe my favorite in New York. It's smaller and lighter than your standard pie, and overall more interesting. I think I've tried most of them at this point and like them all, although for what it's worth we always get one artichoke/smoked pancetta. We also very much like the white bean appetizer.Service has been spotty at times but overall even there this place does it well.

Minor inconvenience, but it was a bit weird.We were given the brunch menu so that is what we went off of. We ordered the two sides, roasted potatoes and sausage.

After a few minutes we were moved to a table... that was open the entire time we were at the bar. Minor inconvenience, but it was a bit weird.We were given the brunch menu so that is what we went off of. We ordered the two sides, roasted potatoes and sausage. They were ok, nothing special in my opinion.We went with the roasted asparagus and caramelized onions Frittata and the arugula pizza. Both were amazing... the Frittata definitely the heavier of the two.Will come back again for the meatball pizza.",4.0
"THANK YOU PIZZA GODZ!Not only is this the holy grail of pizza in bk, the service is phenomenal! I have searched the lands high and low for the perfect pizza and have been faced with bitter disappointment around every corner. Barboncino has made me feel things for pizza I haven't felt in a LONG time. The service is fantastic! Our server Steven not only had the sweetest pony tail the world has ever seen (second only to my fathers) he was also extremely  knowledgeable and friendly. The ambiance is beautiful, the cocktails are perfectly balanced, refreshing and unique. What else could you possibly want?! Special thanks to Max and his incredible patience and helpfulness when I called to get everyone's names, I will be back ... ALL.THE.TIME.",5.0
"Nothing too fancy, nothing too mediocre. Perfect place to mingle and jingle. FYI, the dessert are calZones.. Hard ass dough, and not your regular crepes! :(Great pizzas, drinks are on point. All in all, I wanna be back with a date!",4.0
I walked pass this spot a few time and finally came here on a date one cold Sunday night. It's definitely not what you expect from the outside. The feel of this spot is intimate with the dim lighting. The look is rustic but charming. It's bigger than I thought with the back opening up into a split level.There was a bit of a wait and so we chose to sit at the bar...and ladies there were hooks for your bag. Always a star in my book!The bartender was friendly and suggested a lovely cocktail with gin....Yummy! I ordered the arugula pizza.....heavenly. I am a fan of this place! Will definitely be back!,4.0
"This place ended up a little mediocre to be honest. We ordered the four cheese and pepperoni, the pizza wasn't anything special. It was a little limp and greaser then expected, although I did enjoy the crust and the pepperoni (they were larger then the standard size and pretty damn good) It was very cozy, tables were a little close for my preference. Our server was friendly but not very attentive.",3.0

By far the best pizza you can get in this area. I hit the fennel and sausage pizza and it tasted very nice. I liked the consistency of the tough and the crunchiness of the crust. Wish I could have tasted more fennel though. Also the waitress had no idea how to open a bottle of wine and she kept trying to take our plates away before we finished. I think she must have been new though.,4.0

"Fabulous pizza, fabulous ambiance and great drinks!After a long journey into NYC, this was the place we popped into for our first dinner.

"OMG its 2;30 in the morning and my lame ass wants to write a yelp review...well, here goes: tonight I came here with some co-workers for some after-work drinks since we just worked a long shift. they took me to this gem and I totally fell in love. FIRST OFF - happy hour at this time??!! (well, it was midnight when I was there)...that's customer service at it's finest . I haven't tried the pizza here yet, but I was looking at some that was ordered by others,and they all looked heavenly. Cant wait to return to try more things on the menu.

Such tasty and unique pizza. Yummy!,5.0
The pizza here is really good I've had it a couple of times and tried a few different ones. The prices for the pizza ranges from 9-20 depending on what is on the pizza. I have tried the margarita which is really good and than I have tried the special ones like eggplant and the four cheese with pepperoni. I have also tried the Nutella banana calzone desert and it was huge. It was really good but really big. The customer service here is usually good for the most part but this recent time I went it was bad. My friend and I have gone when it was much more crowded and have received better service. The waitress took so long to come to us. It took 30 minutes to get desert and there was not even a full scoop of ice cream. Than to wait for the check took more time and than to give her the money.,3.0
This is my favorite restaurant in Crown Heights! I love going here. The only problem is it's always so packed but that is because it is so delicious. I always end up having to wait for a table. The drinks are really good and the pizza is crazy good. My favorite is the Arugula pizza.,5.0
"This is my favorite pizza place in all of nyc, no joke. I love the atmosphere, but their takeout is quick also.

"This was the best pizza I've had in a LONG time - including Roberta's and Emily. It was on par with Keste pizza, my favorite in all of NYC(clearly, I like the Neapolitan style). I've definitely heard about Barboncino but, in contrast to most cases, I don't know why it isn't hyped more. I had the arugula pizza and it was perfect. There were quoted a 30-40 minute wait (at 8 pm on a Friday, so I was expected it) but we found a spot at the bar and tracked our spot in line with their cool app and before I knew it we had a table. Pizzas are around $14-20 but you get a lot for that - I got three meals total out of my pizza. The downside, and the reason this review isn't 5 stars (and I am tempted to dock it to 3, but the pizza was THAT good) was the service. I have no idea what was going on but we got our pizza before our first round of drinks, and the check before our second (shouldn't have ordered that second round). Our server apologized profusely both times but never offered to take the second round of the bill, which I think he should have.

"I don't know why it took me so long to get myself here. All of my friends rave about this place and I guess I've always had my own favorites along Franklin Ave. However, this has moved to the top of my list in record speed!I went on NYE for dinner and was able to get seated within an hour. It really is worth the wait and you should always expect one. It's pretty crowded, but the ambience is so cozy, warm and slightly romantic... After a drink, you forget you were even waiting.I started at the bar while I waited and enjoyed the piazza cocktail - semi-sweet with a rosemary kick, yum. I also ordered the botanica cocktail from my table - a bit more sour with a refreshing basil taste, even more yum.There were three of us and we split the spinach salad, four cheese pepperoni pizza and the cherry stone clam pizza. The clam pizza is much more enjoyable when it's hot and it's not overpowering with flavor, but it's absolutely delightful. However, that pepperoni pizza is out of this world!! The cheeses include an odd variety like gorgonzola. Hands down, the best pizza on the menu. The salad was also fresh, but I'm sorry, I'm never one to rave about salad. Oh, and we also got the tiramisu with a scoop of dark chocolate gelato - amazing, fluffy goodness! This spread was just enough for the three of us. Also note that the pizza crust is pretty thin, but still bubbly, which makes for the perfect oven fried pizza.The ONLY downside to this place is that the service is a bit slow. I think it's because of the product. A pizza just doesn't take five minutes to bake! But even our spinach salad came out a tad slow.",5.0
"My fave restaurant in Crown Heights. The woodfired pizza is awesome (try the clam pie) especially with a drizzle of the chili oil.

It reminded me of stale naan. 1/5Sauce: what sauce? The sausage and crimini mushroom pizza had neither sauce nor olive oil. Maybe some briny residue that tasted like a pickle that's been in the fridge for too long. 1/5Cheese: Fior di latte? Please. Each slice had a few dots of cheese. They'd be better served with going with true buffalo mozzarella if they actually wanted to be legit. 1/5Size: You need a microscope to see this thing. $50 for two tiny lunchables-size pizzas? This is some overpriced hipster bull**t. Italians should be ashamed to be seen eating here. 1/5Overall:This is where you should go if you want to look hip while eating tiny, flavorless, bland mush.

It was too large for one person but not big enough for two moderately hungry people. I left hungry. Make sure you get an appetizer if you plan to share your pizza with someone. Also, our waitress kept rushing us throughout the entire meal despite the fact that the restaurant was pretty much empty. She hovered over asking for our drink order after we'd asked for extra time. I'm all for expediency but she made me feel flustered and uncomfortable and I just couldn't wait to get out there. All things considered, I probably won't come back.",3.0

In fact - with its dim lighting, laughter mixed with music in the background, and social atmosphere - it was more memorable than the food.

"Maybe the best pizza I've ever eaten!!  I'm from CT so pizza, I'm no stranger to.  I love Chicago's deep dish, NYs thin pizza, New Haven Bar Pizza, even floppy pizza in Italy, however none have I ever found to be as fresh and as delicious I just had to write this review.  The crust has a distinct Indain Na'an type texture.  Thin in the middle, big crust, but fluffy and even doughy inside, yet still bubbled up and acquired some wood oven char, yummy.We chose meatball and clam.  WOW!  Every ingredient as fresh as the next, with fresh herbs on top, no flavor remiss, a circus of deliciousness with every bite.   Even our spinach salad with goat cheese and apple, simple yet it was extremely fresh, light and delectable.  Wish I took some pictures.Finished with Tiramisu, dulce de leche gelato and espresso.  Mmmm, again, super fresh, super moist cake and flavor was on point.  Service great, seated quickly, great ambiance, candles, dimly lit, not too loud and had a hot playlist going!  We sat towards the back, exposed brick distressed shabby chic feel, very well done.  There was bar up front and plenty of seating.  Will definitely return to NY to eat this pizza again!",5.0
"I've been wanting to come try this place for the longest.  I love pizza but I hardly ever eat pizza baked in a wood burning oven.   I finally had a chance to eat here.   I was planning a get together dinner with my friends, I picked this place.    It was something different because every single time we get together for dinner, we always end up eating Thai food.   I like it but got really really tired of it. We were a group of 4 and we ordered 3 pies.   The artichoke, the meatball and the eggplant and zuchinni.  The eggplant zuchinni pie was a bit soggy, but I understand how much water can come out from zuchinni when cooked.  Later on we ordered the clam pie.  That pie was my least favorite. There also wasn't much clam pieces on the pie.   For $17, they can scatter a few more clams around the pie.   My favorite was the meatball pie.    The hot olive oil was also really good on the pizza, for some spice.I would like to come back to try their other pies.   I was eyeing the arugula pie.  The waiter was also very attentive.   He was nice enough to let the pizza makers know that we were eating the pies family style, they cut our pies into 6 slices rather than the normal 4 slices, without our request.",4.0
"Barboncino can easily be a date spot considering how dim the restaurant is. But overall, I really enjoyed coming here. The wait wasn't bad and you can head over to the bar area and get drinks while you wait for seating. They use a very modern-day brick oven that looks like a giant golf ball. We tried the Arugula Pizza with added Prosciutto, Neapolitan Meatballs, and the classic Margarita. Each came as a personal size, thin-crush pizza sliced into 4 large pieces. All were delicious but slightly on the salty side. The Arugula with Prosciutto has always been my favorite kind of pizza. The Neapolitan Meatball was recommended by our waiter, but the pizza looked almost identical to the Margarita. The only difference was the added homemade meatballs, which were exploding with flavor. To add an extra kick to your pizza, they have a pepper infused oil on each table that was pretty good. I would have liked to try the Nutella calzone, but we were already too full from the pizza. I would definitely like to stop by again.",4.0
"I LOVE this place and their pizza! The restaurant itself is incredibly inviting and cozy with pockets of seating around, great lighting and candles. The pizza is incredible, I've had a few of the options and I am never disappointed...it's really good. I've tried DiFara, Juliana's, etc and they are up there right with everyone else (possibly better). There is also a spicy oil that's delicious and definitely ask for honey to drizzle on top or dip your crust into. Simple wine selections, tasty cocktails and craft beers for those who are thirsty! Last time we tried a salad, and even that was so good. I want to go back to try some of the appetizers and the artichoke/pancetta pizza.",5.0

I would suggest you let the pizza cool for a few minutes before going right into it. Hard to control the urge, but if you do, then the cheese won't slide off and you won't burn the roof of your mouth.Good service and atmosphere. Will come back again to try non-pizza dishes.",3.0
"Maybe the best pizza I've ever eaten!!  I'm from CT so pizza, I'm no stranger to.  I love Chicago's deep dish, NYs thin pizza, New Haven Bar Pizza, even floppy pizza in Italy, however none have I ever found to be as fresh and as delicious I just had to write this review.  The crust has a distinct Indain Na'an type texture.  Thin in the middle, big crust, but fluffy and even doughy inside, yet still bubbled up and acquired some wood oven char, yummy.We chose meatball and clam.  WOW!  Every ingredient as fresh as the next, with fresh herbs on top, no flavor remiss, a circus of deliciousness with every bite.   Even our spinach salad with goat cheese and apple, simple yet it was extremely fresh, light and delectable.  Wish I took some pictures.Finished with Tiramisu, dulce de leche gelato and espresso.  Mmmm, again, super fresh, super moist cake and flavor was on point.  Service great, seated quickly, great ambiance, candles, dimly lit, not too loud and had a hot playlist going!  We sat towards the back, exposed brick distressed shabby chic feel, very well done.  There was bar up front and plenty of seating.  Will definitely return to NY to eat this pizza again!",5.0
"I've been wanting to come try this place for the longest.  I love pizza but I hardly ever eat pizza baked in a wood burning oven.   I finally had a chance to eat here.   I was planning a get together dinner with my friends, I picked this place.    It was something different because every single time we get together for dinner, we always end up eating Thai food.   I like it but got really really tired of it. We were a group of 4 and we ordered 3 pies.   The artichoke, the meatball and the eggplant and zuchinni.  The eggplant zuchinni pie was a bit soggy, but I understand how much water can come out from zuchinni when cooked.  Later on we ordered the clam pie.  That pie was my least favorite. There also wasn't much clam pieces on the pie.   For $17, they can scatter a few more clams around the pie.   My favorite was the meatball pie.    The hot olive oil was also really good on the pizza, for some spice.I would like to come back to try their other pies.   I was eyeing the arugula pie.  The waiter was also very attentive.   He was nice enough to let the pizza makers know that we were eating the pies family style, they cut our pies into 6 slices rather than the normal 4 slices, without our request.",4.0
"Barboncino can easily be a date spot considering how dim the restaurant is. But overall, I really enjoyed coming here. The wait wasn't bad and you can head over to the bar area and get drinks while you wait for seating. They use a very modern-day brick oven that looks like a giant golf ball. We tried the Arugula Pizza with added Prosciutto, Neapolitan Meatballs, and the classic Margarita. Each came as a personal size, thin-crush pizza sliced into 4 large pieces. All were delicious but slightly on the salty side. The Arugula with Prosciutto has always been my favorite kind of pizza. The Neapolitan Meatball was recommended by our waiter, but the pizza looked almost identical to the Margarita. The only difference was the added homemade meatballs, which were exploding with flavor. To add an extra kick to your pizza, they have a pepper infused oil on each table that was pretty good. I would have liked to try the Nutella calzone, but we were already too full from the pizza. I would definitely like to stop by again.",4.0
"I LOVE this place and their pizza! The restaurant itself is incredibly inviting and cozy with pockets of seating around, great lighting and candles. The pizza is incredible, I've had a few of the options and I am never disappointed...it's really good. I've tried DiFara, Juliana's, etc and they are up there right with everyone else (possibly better). There is also a spicy oil that's delicious and definitely ask for honey to drizzle on top or dip your crust into. Simple wine selections, tasty cocktails and craft beers for those who are thirsty! Last time we tried a salad, and even that was so good. I want to go back to try some of the appetizers and the artichoke/pancetta pizza.",5.0

"I came here really excited to try the pizza because of the amazing reviews but I was so incredibly disappointed. I had the margherita pizza and it was VERY soggy, flavorless, and burnt :(  The sauce tasted watery. I felt like I was just eating plain bread dipped in water. It's a really small portion for what you pay. Sadly, I would not recommend this place to anyone, especially if you're looking for good New York pizza.",1.0
"Let me just say welcome to Brooklyn, their pizza is really good the clam pizza it sounds weird it's super good.please get early if always sells out.Which I think it's a tactic you guys know the people love it keep those clams coming for our pizza people.The meatballs are good two.Tiramisu nah you can pass on that.That Nutella calzone amazing goodness it's huge so expect to share it among friends they should make two sizes, Just in case just one person wanted it.But besides that great pizza .",5.0

"What can I say, the pizza here is pretty solid. The simplest pies showcase the quality of ingredients best here, while sometimes the flavors get lost in the specialty dishes (arugula, seafood, etc.) It can also be hit or miss as to how over-done the crust is going to be, but it's nothing that isn't remedied by the delicious red pepper soaked olive oil on each table.With a good selection of well priced beer and the fast service, the wait isn't ever too large but expect at least a half hour to an hour wait on a weekend night. Don't bank on their new texting app working (or even letting you register either).",4.0
"We came here on a Saturday afternoon craving some gourmet pizza and we were not disappointed. Although they were still serving off of the brunch menu, our waiter indicated that we could order pizzas off their main menu or suggest a pizza and he would likely be able to make it. The place was half full and we were seated right away. Both the decor and the staff were ""SO Brooklyn"" so it was a great place to bring a friend from out of town.I had the mouthwatering (seriously, just thinking about it, makes me salivate) Pear Gorgonzola Pizza. Hot, crispy, rich sweet and salty perfection! My friends ordered the sopressata and a pepperoni & red onion pizza, both of which satisfied our cravings and our tastebuds :) The rest of the brunch menu looked enticing too!The staff was friendly and even brought extra marinara for us to finish the crusts for no charge. I'll definitely be back!",5.0
"Pros:  Decor - really liked the dim lighting, the ceilings and the rustic feel. The layout made the restaurant feel bigger than it actually is.Kitchen - the kitchen is the centerpiece of the restaurant, and they show off the wood-burning oven, which is in constant use. Bar - waited for a table (for only about 15 minutes) at the bar. The popular gin cocktail was very good, albeit small, and the bartenders were friendly and attentive. Food - we ordered the artichoke pizza and the mushroom and sausage pizza. Both were on the table within 10 minutes of being seated. The crust was very good - thin and well cooked, but not burned. It was light, but could still hold all the toppings. Small detail, but I also like when restaurant leave a bottle of tap water on the table. Cons: Pizza was a little salty, but it didn't slow me down. Then again, I like savory food. Not really a negative for me personally. The cocktails were very good, but for $12, I would have liked to have more (volume and alcohol content)",5.0

"5 starsGreat little neighborhood joint. It's narrow at the bar and looks smaller than it is when you walk in. They have seating in the back and downstairs (that's where we were seated) for more privacy (and optimal for a bigger group). But the atmosphere is perfect for dates or meeting up with a few of your girlfriends (depending on how big your group is, might be difficult. We got lucky one time). The server we had was great. Really friendly and helpful with suggestions (and amounts). He made us feel very comfortable - joking around with us and taking his time. Some might not like this but like I said, it's a neighborhood joint so you have to expect a neighborhood feel. Bartenders are amazing. Like our server, really friendly and makes whatever you need. A pleasure to hang out at the bar as we waited for our table. Food. I'm not going to pretend I can distinguish one great pizza from another. But this is some damn good pizza. It's up there. If you like that thin brick oven type, you won't be disappointed. We got a number of pizzas: margherita, sopressata picante, cremini and sausage, arugula, and cherry stone clams. They were all good. Whatever your favorite topping is, just go with that. THEN top it with that beautiful chili oil. My god that is delicious. Just want to carry it in my bag like people carry ranch. It's no special recipe but just something about chili and oil - just love. We also got the meatballs, roasted peppers with burrata, and some salad. Again, no complaints. Meatballs are great. And burrata. How can you not love burrata. Salad to ...cleanse the palate. :)Overall - great. Would I say to come out of the way to come here? Probably not. But only because there are a lot of really great pizza places like this in nyc. Or at least that might be closer depending where you are. But I have friends who live around here so I'm here quite often. Lucky lucky me.",5.0

This place is awesome! Came here on a date night and have been craving it ever since! We were seated right away where we each order cocktails - thought it was great for the price! We ordered the Salumi Board to start and it was a lot of delicious food. I got the Margherita pizza and he got the Arugula pizza with some additional science! Worth the price but the portions are generous so maybe think twice before getting an appetizer! Try this place out- definitely worth making the trip to Crown Heights,4.0
"Doubtless one of the best restaurants and bars in ""town""!Great service, serious professionals only work there.Excellent cocktail bar, I had one of the best Negroni ever, executed at perfection!The fire-roasted peppers are a MUST try! Sooooo delicious. Get the garlic bread with it, and maybe add the burrata.Their pizza is not 100% Neapolitan. It's too tick, baked for too long. They don't offer buffalo mozzarella but that seems arising from the firm decision form the managers not to serve anything that doesn't meet the quality label of excellence! Well, I respect that, and I swear the first thing I said to my gf after tasting the pizza was: ""the toppings are REALLY of great quality!"". The freshness of what the toppings met and exceeded my Italian expectation bar. Everything was DELICIOUS!So, at the end pure Neapolitan or not, their pizza is *a*n good! Like GOOD GOOD!I went there two nights in a row. The second time was late night and maybe thanks to the slower traffic our PIZZA was PHENOMENAL!Who knows me is aware that I'm terribly picky on pizza, and I personally guarantee that the pizza here is TRULY GOOD! I understand and respect other yelpers complaining about this kind (Neapolitan) of pizza, but the fault here is not the pizza but the lack of knowing what a authentic pizza is, and what it takes.Great pizza, great atmosphere, great service, good beers, and great liquor bar.A MUST GO in Brooklyn!(I would actually go there on purpose even if I were in Manhattan!)",5.0

"Barboncino's is not only a great place to grab a late night snack, but also a great place to meet up with friends and grab a drink. The bar, situated at the front of the restaurant is always busy and the bartenders make some fantastically unique delicious cocktails. In the back of the restaurant is an intimate lifted section with cozy and subtle design elements that give the restaurant a warm and relaxed feel. The menu, although somewhat limited has some great pizzas and salads to offer (my favorite being the artichoke and pancetta pizza).

"Best pizza in brooklyn, warm and cozy. My favorite drink here is the piazza.Is very popular, expect to wait when visiting on weekends.",5.0
"Called and they said they don't have the pesto sauce that goes on the pizza. So you don't have pesto? No, only for the appetizer. So, you're out of pesto? Yes! How are you out of pesto on a Friday?On a weekend? Really?! And no one seemed to cater. Typical New York response.we don't have it and I don't care !",1.0
This place is awesome! Came here on a date night and have been craving it ever since! We were seated right away where we each order cocktails - thought it was great for the price! We ordered the Salumi Board to start and it was a lot of delicious food. I got the Margherita pizza and he got the Arugula pizza with some additional science! Worth the price but the portions are generous so maybe think twice before getting an appetizer! Try this place out- definitely worth making the trip to Crown Heights,4.0
"Doubtless one of the best restaurants and bars in ""town""!Great service, serious professionals only work there.Excellent cocktail bar, I had one of the best Negroni ever, executed at perfection!The fire-roasted peppers are a MUST try! Sooooo delicious. Get the garlic bread with it, and maybe add the burrata.Their pizza is not 100% Neapolitan. It's too tick, baked for too long. They don't offer buffalo mozzarella but that seems arising from the firm decision form the managers not to serve anything that doesn't meet the quality label of excellence! Well, I respect that, and I swear the first thing I said to my gf after tasting the pizza was: ""the toppings are REALLY of great quality!"". The freshness of what the toppings met and exceeded my Italian expectation bar. Everything was DELICIOUS!So, at the end pure Neapolitan or not, their pizza is *a*n good! Like GOOD GOOD!I went there two nights in a row. The second time was late night and maybe thanks to the slower traffic our PIZZA was PHENOMENAL!Who knows me is aware that I'm terribly picky on pizza, and I personally guarantee that the pizza here is TRULY GOOD! I understand and respect other yelpers complaining about this kind (Neapolitan) of pizza, but the fault here is not the pizza but the lack of knowing what a authentic pizza is, and what it takes.Great pizza, great atmosphere, great service, good beers, and great liquor bar.A MUST GO in Brooklyn!(I would actually go there on purpose even if I were in Manhattan!)",5.0
"I love this place! Service, food, drinks, ambiance was amazing! A nice spot for a romantic date or with friends.",5.0
Amazing Neapolitan pizza and ambience. Slow service but to be expected given how crowded it is. You can text for wait updates though. Charged $3 for a side of sauce to dip crust in though which was an unnecessarily douchey move.,4.0
"Barbachino pizza is sooooo good, that it should be used as the body of Christ on sunday mass. Cause hallelujah I think I've died and gone to heaven!Staff there rocks, never had a bad server and the good ones know how to to sell ;) (Legitimately my fist and probably only yelp review because they deserve it.)",5.0
"Barboncino's is not only a great place to grab a late night snack, but also a great place to meet up with friends and grab a drink. The bar, situated at the front of the restaurant is always busy and the bartenders make some fantastically unique delicious cocktails. In the back of the restaurant is an intimate lifted section with cozy and subtle design elements that give the restaurant a warm and relaxed feel. The menu, although somewhat limited has some great pizzas and salads to offer (my favorite being the artichoke and pancetta pizza). The staff is attentive and interactive, the correct food always arrives on time and at the perfect temperature. Between the ambiance, friendly staff, and consistent food, Barboncino's is a solid choice for a casual dinner with a friend, a date, or alone.",5.0

"This place is a gem for so many reasons. I've eaten here at least 4 times. Great, great wood oven pizzas. The meatball and clam ones are my favorite. Any that use their sweet fresh tomato sauce are a good bet. I've also had several of their salads which are a little small but all delicious. The Nutella banana calzone for dessert is epic so save room for that. The food is well priced, the pizzas are around $12 which is fair. This place also has a good bar with a solid beer and wine selection and great cocktails. One final thing of importance is that the food comes out very quickly. You won't wait a long time to get your meal and the service is excellent. This is probably the can't-miss restaurant in the neighborhood for me.",5.0

"Cool pizza spot in the neighborhood. I liked the 80s Bell Biv Devoe they were playing too.

"Solid neighborhood spot. The pizza is good, but for the price I think you can get better in NYC. I think the margerita so far has been my favorite, the one with clams a close second. The cocktails are fantastic, thought. They have this wine float one that is one of my favorite things ever. Decent-priced bottles of wine, too. They have Jazz on Tuesdays too, which is great if you wanna just go chill and listen to some music by yourself.",4.0
Dericious pizza! We came on a Saturday afternoon to watch the Brazil vs Netherlands game (they have a bunch of TV's and projectors) for their happy hour ($2 off beers? half off? not sure). There was plenty of seating (although no bar service at the tables - we had to go up and order).I also got the Neopolitan meatball pizza. The sauce was yummy and the crust was good (although a little burnt). Service was excellent. Overall a great place to hang out and enjoy great food!,4.0
"Came here last night and it was amazing !! The wait was twenty minutes , we grabbed a drink at the bar while we waited for our table . They texted us exactly twenty minutes later saying the table was ready. We started off with the roasted peppers and buratta which was delicious , and also had the arugula salad which had pine nuts so that was a nice twist . We then ordered the speciality pizza which was pancetta , pineapple and jalapeño and BOY was it delicious!!!! I can hands down say it was the best speciality pizza I've had in Brooklyn !

Hands down has to be some of the best thin crust pizza I have tasted in Brooklyn! Very fresh and crunchy yet soft! Arugula salad is a great start but good to share since the pizzas are not small!  Brick oven thin pizza! They have a beautiful HUGE BRICK OVEN when you walk in! Only down fall is the long wait on Friday and Saturday nights could easily be longer than an hour because of the small amount of tables but definitely worth the wait they have a nice bar where they get you when your table is ready! Definitely recommend! Tables are candlelit at night.,4.0

"I live right around the corner and this is a definite go-to. Sometimes can be very crowded at usually busy times, so I start off with drinks. Definitely try their cocktails. The Frank Sinatra (light, bourbon cucumbery, ginger drink) is delightful. I'm a lover of all thin crust pizza, but I'm also a lover of crust. I might even argue its my favorite part (ok, maybe behind the cheese). Not only is it crispy, the crust is fluffy and substantial. I usually start off with a couple of salads - very simple. I guess the arugula is a little sparse, but that's an arugula salad for you. They sometimes have a special burata tomato special, which I would advise you to order immediately. I've had the meatballs as well and love them. Very juicy. In terms of pizza, 2 for 4 people is usually the perfect amount if you have apps. The sopressata is probably my favorite because of how garlicky it is (I'm garlic obessed), but not disappointed with any that I've tried.",4.0
"Don't get me wrong, the pizza at Barboncino is good, I just feel there are better options in the area that don't require you to wait an hour.  Ogliastro on Washington ave has a better crust and in my opinion, more creative topping combinations, AND a nice outdoor area AND (usually) no wait for a table.  If you're the type of diner that feels better about eating about places that make you wait for a long time, Emily is nearby and the pizza is, in my opinion, far better.",3.0

"People say that in the restaurant world there are only two real currencies: your praise and your money. Barbocino has earned both from this delighted gourmand. Where to begin? Meatballs? Please, so juicy you'll want to wear a raincoat. Burrata? Complaints = nada. Tiramisu? All for me, none for you. Caprese? Yes way-ze! Salumi board? Never bored! Cheese slate? Can't wait! Honestly though, I don't really eat pizza so I can't comment on that. The waitstaff were so welcoming and pleasant though I would have been just as satisfied to eat them up :) I go on many dates at this romantic hotty spot and waiting at the bar for my Romeo has never done me wrong. The barkeeps are knowledgable and attentive even when the bar is overflowing with boisterous regulars. And when my prince turns into a frog (wtf! online dating, right?) those cuties behind the bar always provide a sweet, sweet lily pad for me to land on. One more tasty piazza, please *ribbet*.Of particular note are the bathrooms which are always clean and provide an almost obscene amount of privacy for me to do my dirty work. I've always been of the opinion that when you see a shooting star you have to grab on with both hands and hold on tight! Barbocino is the shooting star of Franklin Ave!!!

"We came on a Saturday around 1 pm. Pretty large space, they have an outdoor section as well, which is nice when weather permits. Not many people were around, so easy to just walk in and get seated right away. The kitchen and wood-fire ovens are right by the door, so it's a bit of a different set up and the dining area is in the back. Lots of wood and open space. There's also a private bar area that's secluded from the rest of the restaurant. Service is friendly and it's easy to flag someone down if you need anything.The pizzas are good, but just not great. It's definitely not the best Neapolitan around. The quality of the dough isn't as high and the crust isn't cooked well. I'm tired of hearing the line ""it's a hot oven, so it has to be burned a bit"" when asking for the pizza to be lightly done. The crust does not have to be burned or charred even. It's perfectly possible to pull out the pizza a few seconds before it chars or burns because plenty of Neapolitan places accommodate for that request all the time and do it perfectly.One of the pizzas we actually had to get redone entirely because it was black. Not charred, but just literally the color black around the crust and on the bottom. Granted, they were really nice about it and didn't hesitate to remake it. Of course, this time in a completely exaggerated way so that it was served practically raw. But it's just because they don't have good command over the process, which is really exactly the reason you should go elsewhere if you can. It's not bad food, it's just not a great version of it.I will say, they have some pretty non-standard pizzas, like the sweet apple, which we tried. It has ricotta, apples, brown sugar, bourbon vanilla extract, nutmeg, cinnamon, and butter. It's very heavy and rich, but surprisingly the sweetness is balanced by the ricotta and it can be eaten as a meal and not just a dessert. It's an interesting concept that works out, so if you want something totally different, give it a try.",3.0
"In a desperate search to find something reasonable to eat at 12:00 AM, I stumbled upon this little gem of a restaurant and was seated quickly towards the back at beautifully candle lit table. Both the hostess (the dude with the killer ponytail) and our waiter were unbelievably kind. My friend and I ordered a custom pizza which maybe took less than 15-20 minutes to come out. Franklin Ave is changing so quickly! I'm really glad a place like this exists in our neighborhood. It's Manhattan meets Brooklyn, without the Manhattan prices. I will definitely be coming back here for a drink and late night bite soon!",5.0
"I have been here so many times for dinner. On the weekend night sometimes I have to wait but not so long. The best way I recommend is just go get some drink at the bar.

"People say that in the restaurant world there are only two real currencies: your praise and your money. Barbocino has earned both from this delighted gourmand. Where to begin? Meatballs? Please, so juicy you'll want to wear a raincoat. Burrata? Complaints = nada. Tiramisu? All for me, none for you. Caprese? Yes way-ze! Salumi board? Never bored! Cheese slate? Can't wait! Honestly though, I don't really eat pizza so I can't comment on that. The waitstaff were so welcoming and pleasant though I would have been just as satisfied to eat them up :) I go on many dates at this romantic hotty spot and waiting at the bar for my Romeo has never done me wrong. The barkeeps are knowledgable and attentive even when the bar is overflowing with boisterous regulars. And when my prince turns into a frog (wtf! online dating, right?) those cuties behind the bar always provide a sweet, sweet lily pad for me to land on. One more tasty piazza, please *ribbet*.Of particular note are the bathrooms which are always clean and provide an almost obscene amount of privacy for me to do my dirty work. I've always been of the opinion that when you see a shooting star you have to grab on with both hands and hold on tight! Barbocino is the shooting star of Franklin Ave!!! Four shooting stars, in fact. Would have been five stars but I'm in between therapists at the moment.",4.0

"I just have to start by saying this pizza is amazing. Absolutely amazing. I was immediately impressed by the vibe. Really cool and laid back, low lighting, candles on every wooden table, a clear view of the wood-burning pizza oven. Seating was a little cramped--we were so close to the group next to us that we could have easily joined in their conversation--but it wasn't too bad.My boyfriend and I shared a spinach salad to start. It was smaller than I thought it would be, and the apples were four very thin slices placed on top. I could barely taste the balsamic vinaigrette. A bit disappointing. However, the pizza more than made up for it. We ordered one pie--half marinara for me, half meatball for him. We loved it! The sauce was so fresh. Crust was on the thinner side, which I usually hate, but it was crisp on the outside and fluffy on the inside. Perfection. The pizza was a good size. It's enough for two to share (especially if you get appetizers), but I could have easily polished a whole one off.I'll be back for more delicious pizza--next time I'll skip the salad and order an entire pie for myself!EDITI've since been back for brunch, and I have to say that the Sweet Apple pizza is AMAZING! I had it without the ricotta (I can't eat cheese), but it didn't seem to lose any intended flavor at all. It was perfection--apple pie as a pizza. I've been having dreams about it ever since.",4.0
"I had a lot of friends recommend this place and it definitely didn't disappoint. The hostess greeted me lightly and professionally. I'll eat it at a table that I was comfortable with it and the waiter quickly approach me with menus even though he had two other tables.

"I couldn't wait to come back! The crust (beautiful black bubbles) with incredible toppings make this the best pizza around!Brunch pizza? Oooh...Got the pizza with egg and sausage (or your choice of meat). WHOA. So good. The only problem is the bottom of the egg can't good through if place on the pizza raw, so it's partly cooked and a goopy egg white floated on the rest - bummer, I really wanted to give them a fifth star.Our waitress recommended the zucchini and eggplant pizza which was AWESOME. A nice bit of heat creeps up on you after each bite and they give you a chili oil to spice it to your liking.This and a good local beer? What better way to enjoy pizza?",4.0
"3.5 stars...Their pizza is made in a beautiful wood fired brick pizza oven and they use fresh and tasty ingredients. Where they fail however is having a pizza that only takes a few minutes to go limp and soggy, party due to not cooking it enough and partly because of the amount of olive oil they drizzle on top after it comes out of the oven. They also get a little stingy putting a single basil leaf on each of the four slices you get on the personal pizza ($11 for a margherita). Lastly they cut the mozzerella way too thick and it wasn't nearly melted and the chewiness was just a little too unbalanced. The space is large and beautiful, the backyard is quiet and quaint. So quaint in fact that it almost didn't bother me so much that the service was ridiculously slow.",3.0

Also, the staff was awesome, even though we might not have been the least annoying customers.",5.0
"Honestly, 4.5 stars is correct.Service was great. Food was great. I had a drink at the bar while we waited to get a table, and my drink was also great. Our server was awesome, and funny. My only gripe was how long it took for us to get our food. Even our server apologized for the length of time it took, and then told us that he would get us a free dessert because of the wait!

"I'm actually surprised that this place only has 4 stars, and that there is any review that says anything negative. Other than the occasional very long wait (due to this place's awesomeness), I've never ever had a bad experience here. I've been coming here on average one or twice a month since it opened, and have had every single thing on the menu. I don't have any personal connection with the owner or staff (although both are very friendly), but my fiancé and I love this place and think of it as our favorite neighborhood spot.For the pizza, it's all good. It beats similar pies in the borough, i.e. Forninos and Motorino. The plan Margherita is great, but the ones with toppings also don't disappoint. They do a good job of not top-loading the pizza, but rather use only a couple toppings generously portioned and complementing each other. My favorites are any thing with the soppressata and pancetta are great. Also, their arugula pizza is awesome (add prosciutto). The bonus is this: come here for brunch and get the bacon egg and cheese pizza.Appetizers are all all good too. The meatballs rival Meatball Shop balls. The white beans in pesto is amazing. And for dessert you can get that crazy Nutella calzone they have. It's good, but enormous and intense, especially if you just scarfed down an entire pizza yourself.Beer and wine is good, and the bartenders make a good fancy cocktail. They could add a double IPA to the tap list, but now I'm getting picky.Bottom line: go here.",5.0
"I just have to start by saying this pizza is amazing. Absolutely amazing. I was immediately impressed by the vibe. Really cool and laid back, low lighting, candles on every wooden table, a clear view of the wood-burning pizza oven. Seating was a little cramped--we were so close to the group next to us that we could have easily joined in their conversation--but it wasn't too bad.My boyfriend and I shared a spinach salad to start. It was smaller than I thought it would be, and the apples were four very thin slices placed on top. I could barely taste the balsamic vinaigrette. A bit disappointing. However, the pizza more than made up for it. We ordered one pie--half marinara for me, half meatball for him. We loved it! The sauce was so fresh. Crust was on the thinner side, which I usually hate, but it was crisp on the outside and fluffy on the inside. Perfection. The pizza was a good size. It's enough for two to share (especially if you get appetizers), but I could have easily polished a whole one off.I'll be back for more delicious pizza--next time I'll skip the salad and order an entire pie for myself!EDITI've since been back for brunch, and I have to say that the Sweet Apple pizza is AMAZING! I had it without the ricotta (I can't eat cheese), but it didn't seem to lose any intended flavor at all. It was perfection--apple pie as a pizza. I've been having dreams about it ever since.",4.0
"I had a lot of friends recommend this place and it definitely didn't disappoint. The hostess greeted me lightly and professionally. I'll eat it at a table that I was comfortable with it and the waiter quickly approach me with menus even though he had two other tables. My food came swiftly and we have a great happy hour drink menu special. When I'm in the area, I will definitely come back again because I enjoy it. Kudos to the staff",5.0
"I couldn't wait to come back! The crust (beautiful black bubbles) with incredible toppings make this the best pizza around!Brunch pizza? Oooh...Got the pizza with egg and sausage (or your choice of meat). WHOA. So good. The only problem is the bottom of the egg can't good through if place on the pizza raw, so it's partly cooked and a goopy egg white floated on the rest - bummer, I really wanted to give them a fifth star.Our waitress recommended the zucchini and eggplant pizza which was AWESOME. A nice bit of heat creeps up on you after each bite and they give you a chili oil to spice it to your liking.This and a good local beer? What better way to enjoy pizza?",4.0
"3.5 stars...Their pizza is made in a beautiful wood fired brick pizza oven and they use fresh and tasty ingredients. Where they fail however is having a pizza that only takes a few minutes to go limp and soggy, party due to not cooking it enough and partly because of the amount of olive oil they drizzle on top after it comes out of the oven. They also get a little stingy putting a single basil leaf on each of the four slices you get on the personal pizza ($11 for a margherita). Lastly they cut the mozzerella way too thick and it wasn't nearly melted and the chewiness was just a little too unbalanced. The space is large and beautiful, the backyard is quiet and quaint. So quaint in fact that it almost didn't bother me so much that the service was ridiculously slow.",3.0
"Great pizza, drinks and service. We always sit at the bar and the bartender is very friendly and attentive. They also have cider which I love. Is our favorite spot for pizza!",5.0
"The crust on this pizza is amazing.  Baked so hot that it blisters and blackens before it even has a chance to brown, it is chewy an crisp but still delicate and doughy.  We had the Artichoke and Pancetta pizza with garlic and olive oil.  No tomato sauce but we didn't miss it. Also, the staff was awesome, even though we might not have been the least annoying customers.",5.0
"Honestly, 4.5 stars is correct.Service was great. Food was great. I had a drink at the bar while we waited to get a table, and my drink was also great. Our server was awesome, and funny. My only gripe was how long it took for us to get our food. Even our server apologized for the length of time it took, and then told us that he would get us a free dessert because of the wait! How nice is that? This place is just great. It's a pretty good date spot too. There's an outdoor patio that you can access as well, but you should make reservations if you can...you don't want to have to wait a while.",4.0

"I'm actually surprised that this place only has 4 stars, and that there is any review that says anything negative. Other than the occasional very long wait (due to this place's awesomeness), I've never ever had a bad experience here. I've been coming here on average one or twice a month since it opened, and have had every single thing on the menu. I don't have any personal connection with the owner or staff (although both are very friendly), but my fiancé and I love this place and think of it as our favorite neighborhood spot.For the pizza, it's all good. It beats similar pies in the borough, i.e. Forninos and Motorino. The plan Margherita is great, but the ones with toppings also don't disappoint. They do a good job of not top-loading the pizza, but rather use only a couple toppings generously portioned and complementing each other.

"I went to Barboncino a few weeks ago, and I enjoyed everything about it.  The atmosphere was nice and cozy, the service was great, and the food was delicious.  I started off with the caprese salad which was wonderful. The mozzarella was fresh, smooth, and creamy.  Probably the best mozzarella I have ever tasted.  I also had the margarita pizza which was very nice.  All in all, it was a great dining experience.",5.0
Went here for drinks after work.  Great prices's and good selection of cocktails and beers.  The food was outstanding.  Pizza with Artichoke and Panchetta was out of this world.  Fairly priced.,4.0
"This is my first Yelp review ever and I feel this place is well deserving of it. Being a Brooklyn girl born and raised having the taste buds for great pizza is embedded in me. I ordered the Margherita which is a total classic. It surely did not disappoint. I originally wanted the Marinara but, as the waitress stated right off the back it doesn't have cheese I was quite sold. But, my co-worker that's a vegan ordered it and he seemed pretty content with it. I also, sampled the Arugula it was pretty good as well. But, what I've seen from my coworkers it had a lot of toppings on it and they stated and I quote, ""it's like a salad on top of a pizza"" maybe less toppings. I ordered the Duvel beer didn't quite know what it was but, I felt a little buzz and it tasted amazing. Even considering coming here again in a month for my birthday. What sold me was it being a 10 minute walk from my house and the outdoor seating which I didn't actually sit in the patio area but, it looked pretty packed. Definitely will try sitting there for my birthday. Being a Crown Heights native I'm proud to know this pizza area is in the neighborhood. You get an A+ in my book! Highly recommend, what are you waiting for? Just go to Barboncino already!",5.0
"Incredible pizza! I had a cappuccino that was really well made. Their gelatos are amazing too - the mint gelato I tried tasted super fresh and delicious. It's busy, I arrived there with my boyfriend at 6:30 or so on a saturday evening and there was already a wait! Luckily it wasn't very long, and they are very organized with their seating. Very cozy, romantic setting, it looked like many of the customers there (including myself!) were in groups of 2.",5.0
"Contrary to belief, I'm a simple guy. I tend to live a minimalist lifestyle, I dress plainly, I love all things Apple, my favorite color is navy blue, my car is a barebones manual civic, the list goes on...My pizza toppings tend to echo that sentiment. So when my friend told me that this place had just a handful of pizzas to choose from I said, ""that just means they know their shit and don't distract customers with other bull."" Honest to God, this was the best pizza I've had in my life. Granted I just got off the plane at Newark and hopped on the NJ transit to catch two more trains to get to Brooklyn, but still. We ordered the Neapolitan meatballs, $9; the Sopressata Picante pizza, $15, and a pinot noir for my friend, while I sipped on a couple of their craft cocktail special--i don't remember what it was called but it had all things Jesus told us to stay away from. Basically, it was fucking delicious. The meatballs are simple. It's kind of hard to mess these up, yet it is also hard to get them to amazeballs status. I felt these weren't quite there, but they were damn good. I think the oregano could have been upped to bring in that authentic mama's house kind of feel to them. Their fork tender nature and moist interior was hard to say ""no"" to, especially since my stomach had been eating itself for the past 7 hours.The sopressata picante is a purest's dream. The original pepperoni pizza. Fresh tomato, fior di latte (a pretentious name for a creamier cow's milk mozzarella), garlic, and olive oil. The flavors evoke cleanliness, freshness, and a feeling of authenticity you don't find common in pizza joints. It's definitely the oven that creates this magic, and it's what you see when you enter the restaurant. The thing I love about these brick ovens, is that they only get better with age. That in itself will keep me coming back on my future visits to Crown Heights.These two dishes were great together...one was relatively heavy (meatballs) while the pizza was a light delight. We capped off our night with an off-the-menu treat called the Banana Nutella Calzone a la mode with Dulce de Leche gelato and a pinch of sea salt.Let that shit sink in a bit. *cue Yelp bookmarks ""To Try""* Made, in the same oven as their other delicious commodities, this is a huge pocket filled with the amazingness known as nutella spread, with slices of banana, then baked to a puffy cloud of a dessert. It looks big, and it is, but it is perfect for sharing and is on the lighter side (just like their pizzas). We took it a step farther and made it gelato a la mode with a perfect dulce de leche cream. Our handsome waiter, Peter, suggested the sea salt on the side and that seriously made my night. He knew where we were going with this before we did. There's something about that sweet + salty formula that equals pure ecstasy in your mouth.Good job, man! With alcohol, our bill came out to $90, which was a great way to start this weekend of eating!",5.0
Pizza there is so good!  Salad is great as well. The staff is incredibly nice and the ambiance is sexy/cozy.  Bartenders really know how to make some authentic drinks.  Don't know what else to say but to try it and you'll see why this place is a great place for friends or a date,5.0
"Barboncino is a pizza place in Brooklyn,NY and the pizza is made in a brick oven style for better taste. They have different types of pizza but the one I picked was with an Italian sausage and extra virgin oil and black pepper. The pizza was really good but a bit burned and I think over all the price are a bit high even though this place has a good night life feeling inside and has low lights make it very good place for a date or late night snack.",3.0

"Deeelightful thin crust brick-oven pizza place in a neighborhood I love (Prospect Heights). After a long day of 5K-ing, Sakura Festing, and drunken improv practicing in our teammate's living room, the SO and I forgot one key ingredient--dinner. Yelp app to the rescue!Luckily this place is open late, even on Sundays. We were able to snag a table within 5 minutes. Barboncino is a nice, generously sized space that feels warm--both from the aforementioned brick oven, and from the amazing staff. We actually sat steps away from our hip server's station/register. He was as nice as nice can be. Not sure where you guys found him, but hold on to him!The food was excellent. We kept it simple--[giant] white beans and pesto was creamy and zesty, and the Neapolitan Meatball pie more than made up for their running out of appetizer-sized meatballs. Everything about the pie was perfect--from the impressively soft and chewy edges to the slightly crispy crust and of course the sauce, cheese, and meat-a-ballas.Dare I say it, a top 5 pizza place in NY that I've been to?

People were seated at wooden tables in a dark, sexy, warm and welcoming room, it excited me.  We were quickly ushered to our seat in no time, I liked the mature and sexy feel of this place, there were lots of dark wood and exposed bricks with just enough lighting to make it enticing.We went over the menu and decided that since it was four of us we would order 2 pizzas.  I went with the Meatball pizza.  I must admit I am not a pizza person and have really only eaten a slice or two maybe 2 times in my life before this night, so my pizza choice was based purely on ""oh that looks like it would be tasty"".  And that it was!

I love the split-level dining and the fact that the restaurant wraps around to a small, intimate bar on the other side. On a cold winter night, it's really great to hunker down at a candlelit table at Barboncino and have several glasses of wine and amazing, hot, crispy, decadent coal oven pizza.",4.0
"Brooklyn pizza at its finest! I love this place,  the service is always good and the food is even better! My favorite is the zucchini and eggplant pizza so delicious! Its thin crust pizza with so much flavour from the dough to the tomato sauce to the toppings. Also, a must try is the nutella dessert! Warm and damn good! Love this spot! There's a bar, dinning room and outdoor seating for any type of night you decide to have :) Enjoy!",5.0
"Have been back a few times with larger groups and the food is always amazing, great service and beautiful ambiance in the restaurant. Will continue to be a favourite for us :)",5.0
Great date spot very intimate pizza was great customer service on. They had a drink special and then we had dessert definitely will return.,4.0
"Best pizza in crown heights hands down. Weekend waits are usually pretty lengthy but the bar, wait staff and pizza are so damn good that No one ever really minds . The space is large and vibrant and the crowd is always really fun. Try the artichoke pancetta and the meatballs!",5.0
"Went last night for dinner. It was much larger inside than it appears to be from the street. Service was attentive and prompt without being pushy. Great atmosphere - candlelit, lots of wood and tin ceilings and cozy tables. I concur with other yelpers: this is a nice date spot.We had a margherita pizza, a spinach salad, two beers and a whiskey. The pizza was tasty and when paired with the spinach salad (which was not the best I've ever had, but was perfectly serviceable), it made for a satisfying, easy meal. I will return to try out their gelato and some of the fancy cocktails.",5.0
"'Twixt such friends as we, few words suffice: I don't eat pizza anywhere else unless I have to.Great pizza. Great atmosphere. Great wine.

The pizza ovens and recipes are imported from Italy. Friendly owners researched the hell out of pizza: The margherita is excellent ($12) and consistently so. Doesn't need toppings, but I've tried others and the cherry-stone clam and parsley-butter variant more than once. Heavier, but very very good.

"Barboncino is a blessing. They serve an excellent pizza and I would rate them as good, if not better, than Franny's. The space is huge and you never really have to wait very long. Also, they have a bar serving excellent so the wait is always pleasant. They serve pizzas till 1AM  everyday and their consistency is just remarkable.

"Another 5 star review for Barboncino. We loooove it there! My Italian partner and I are addicted to Barboncino's pizza, and that's saying something (he's picky on what constitutes good Italian food). I've been designing my own pizza - with eggplant, zucchini, arugula and strips of parmesan cheese. This and the Tiramisu is perfect.A little boost for the staff too - they are super friendly and make you feel like you're visiting friends. Love Barboncino's.",5.0
This place has fantastic pizza and the BEST garlic bread. Get the cheese plate (which comes with a massive helping of garlic bread) and any of the pizzas. The arugula pie is great as is the artichoke and smoked pancetta. The place is dark and cute and wood and lovely. A worthy spot if you're in the area.,5.0
The best neapolitan pizza in Brooklyn. It's just perfect. The atmosphere is great. The staff is always friendly. The gelato is terrific. The service is fast. The prices are reasonable.

If you don't mind a literally dark environment and ok food then this is a place for you to try out. The food is decent. The pizza ingredients makes it taste a bit bitter.The restaurant seems overcrowded so be prepared to dine next to strangers.

I asked our server if I could still order it, he not only put the order in but was vegan himself and recommended the mixed field greens salad.

"There's nothing like walking into a place by yourself and feeling completely at ease. Barboncino's gave me this feeling last night. Generally I'm always out with friends, but I have those nights where I want to go sit at the bar by myself, order small plates, and drink fancy glasses of wine while interacting with the random bar floaters to my left and right. However, this place is ideal for groups who like to drink, eat, and be loud.Like a magnet I was pulled in here last night after their 1st happy hour but before the late night one had started. I sat at the bar and tasted a few wines before settling on a dry white, ordered an appetizer that had roasted peppers and capers on a bed of burrata which was so healthy and fresh tasting, and chatted some nonsense with other guests and ordered more wine.A few glasses later, I'm sharing a Margherita pizza with the dude to my right and shooting the shit with his two amigos at the end of the bar. The bartender, Derrek, was patient and chill, and the other employees seemed pretty mellow.

It was a Friday night, so it was packed, and we had to wait quite a while for a table (but I'd be damned if I wasn't going to get some of this pizza!). When we finally got seated, we had a great, funny waiter who was really knowledgable about the menu and was able to guide my ridiculously picky brother to something he would like. My mom and I split a caesar salad, which was DIVINE -- not too creamy or heavy, and also split an Arugula pizza with added prosciutto. Holy shit, one of the best pies I've ever had.

"This is my favorite pizza in NYC after DiFara although I'll take Barboncino's atmosphere over DiFara any day. I've been here several times in large groups, couples and recently solo. Each time the service has been excellent and the food does not disappoint. Recently I dined alone and sat at the bar. I ordered the roasted pepper and Burrata salad which was excellent. The Burrata was so delicious, very creamy and fresh. I have tried several pizzas here but I think the one I ordered that day, the Sopressata, is my favorite. If you like a bit spicy, this is for you. The Sopressata serving is generous as is the size of the pizza itself. I also love the chili pepper infused olive oil they have available. Also, try the white pizzas! I am not the biggest fan of white pizza because at other places they tend to be dry but this IS NOT the case at Barboncino's. Full of flavor with a lot of unique toppings combos.

"I've been here a handful of times and have found it to be consistently good in all respects. They have a nice area to sit outside when weather permits, and the interior seating layout is intimate but, even during busy dinner hours, you never feel crowded. Good for groups or a low key date, it's certainly the best pizza in the area.  They've recently started promoting some more social events like Oscar Night and a Mad Men viewing on big projector screens - which would be fun with friends but not really conducive to a romantic date if you're trying to be cute with a special someone (or even a not-so-special someone. No judgement here.) Call ahead or check their Facebook page to be sure you know what to expect. As for the food - I've never had anything here I disliked. The meatballs are good but apparently my girlfriends mother makes better ones, and the salads are also a nice appetizer. But the best thing I've had is by far the Arugula pizza. Pay the additional few bucks to have some Prosciutto thrown on it and it is heavenly. The salty Prosciutto and peppery arugula blend so well with the tangy Parmesan cheese....I miss it. Note that the pizza dough is pretty chewy, so if you're not into maybe having to use a fork and knife (because you're a new yawker and you don't DO that here!) you mightn't be thrilled with it. The bar is a good mix with a decent amount of beers and wine available, and they have cocktail specials which they switch up from time to time. The staff are always friendly and attentive, but on weekends it could take you a while to get seated. Worth the wait!",4.0
"3.5 stars (giving them the bump because I would definitely return).  Barboncino has a beautiful space--I loved the ambiance--the lighting, tables, and oven are all beautiful and make the place feel special.  I went with a group of 5--we had 4 pizzas (the margarita, the anchovy, the artichoke and smoked panchetta, and the clam), the meatballs, the arugula salad, a few cocktails, and then nutella calzone dessert with gelato.  I thought the pizza, like others have said, is good but not great.  I think it may be that the chef needs to keep it in the oven a bit longer because the dough does get a bit soggy.  I think the ingredients though were good and I thought the meatballs especially were delicious.  My brooklyn sweat tea was strong (as noted on yelp), and I had 2 of them because I enjoyed the first. Overall, I liked Barboncino.  I would rank it close to Juliana's in terms of pizza quality--very good, but below Frannys (as its closest natural rival).",4.0

We didn't really have time to check out the full menu. We were just really hungry and wanted to get to any random bar we could find. I would come back here!,4.0
"I've been here a handful of times and have found it to be consistently good in all respects. They have a nice area to sit outside when weather permits, and the interior seating layout is intimate but, even during busy dinner hours, you never feel crowded. Good for groups or a low key date, it's certainly the best pizza in the area.  They've recently started promoting some more social events like Oscar Night and a Mad Men viewing on big projector screens - which would be fun with friends but not really conducive to a romantic date if you're trying to be cute with a special someone (or even a not-so-special someone. No judgement here.) Call ahead or check their Facebook page to be sure you know what to expect. As for the food - I've never had anything here I disliked. The meatballs are good but apparently my girlfriends mother makes better ones, and the salads are also a nice appetizer. But the best thing I've had is by far the Arugula pizza. Pay the additional few bucks to have some Prosciutto thrown on it and it is heavenly. The salty Prosciutto and peppery arugula blend so well with the tangy Parmesan cheese....I miss it. Note that the pizza dough is pretty chewy, so if you're not into maybe having to use a fork and knife (because you're a new yawker and you don't DO that here!) you mightn't be thrilled with it. The bar is a good mix with a decent amount of beers and wine available, and they have cocktail specials which they switch up from time to time. The staff are always friendly and attentive, but on weekends it could take you a while to get seated. Worth the wait!",4.0
"3.5 stars (giving them the bump because I would definitely return).  Barboncino has a beautiful space--I loved the ambiance--the lighting, tables, and oven are all beautiful and make the place feel special.  I went with a group of 5--we had 4 pizzas (the margarita, the anchovy, the artichoke and smoked panchetta, and the clam), the meatballs, the arugula salad, a few cocktails, and then nutella calzone dessert with gelato.  I thought the pizza, like others have said, is good but not great.  I think it may be that the chef needs to keep it in the oven a bit longer because the dough does get a bit soggy.  I think the ingredients though were good and I thought the meatballs especially were delicious.  My brooklyn sweat tea was strong (as noted on yelp), and I had 2 of them because I enjoyed the first. Overall, I liked Barboncino.  I would rank it close to Juliana's in terms of pizza quality--very good, but below Frannys (as its closest natural rival).",4.0
"Stopped in late night after our original destination Catfish (well let's just say they ruined the chance of me trying them out). Back to my review, loved the ambiance and the friendly service as soon as we walked in, hint hint other place. The pizza was great and I had a pretty good cocktail that I can't seem to remember the name of. I would definitely go back. It was a great addition to my bday wknd.",4.0
5 of us had dinner here last week and found the dough to be bland and the toppings to be undercooked ( in the case of the eggplant/zucchini pizza).It is a nice space but does not deserve the 4.5* rating.  I've had better pizza in every artisan pizza spot in NYC.,2.0
"This place is the Mecca of great customer service. I felt like I was a celebrity. From the minute I walked in, the staff was super attentive to my needs.

I ordered the Meatball pizza. It was very good. I'm a meat guy, so I wished there was a little more meatball. However, the flavor was very good. Great first impression and I'll definitely be back.",5.0
"My girlfriend and I have been here more than a dozen times. We go to Barboncino regularly ourselves, and make it a destination when friends and family come to visit.

They have a really great nutella, banana, walnut calzone which is a must have dessert. I wish they had more music happening there. They have a band on wednesday nights that they claim is a jazz trio, but I think it turns into an open mic scene more than anything. I'd love to see more live music!",5.0

"This wonderful pizzeria is the creation of indie filmmaker Ron Brown and Jon Greenberg, who previously worked at Paulie Gee's and, before that, the original Robicelli's. Perhaps it is not too surprising, then, that the pizza at Barboncino is remarkably similar to that of Paul Giannone. Even the Ferraro oven, imported directly from Naples, is the same as that of the popular Greenpoint pizzeria, just a bit smaller.This is all for the best, since these guys learned their pizza lessons well: The pie is thin, chewy, airy, and nicely spotted with char dots[1]; the tomato sauce is fresh and tangy; and the fiordilatte mozzarella[2] is as tasty as it is creamy. In fact, the Margherita pizza ($11) is such a beautifully balanced and light thing that I felt that I could easily eat five pies.The full bar that serves cocktails, nicely priced at just $10. It also has Dogfish Head 90 Min. IPA on tap, together with Brooklyn Chocolate Stout.The people behind Barboncino clearly put great care and a lot of effort in creating a dark, sexy ambiance that is also warm and welcoming. The two-level massive room sports lots of dark wood, exposed bricks, and great attention to details. The recently opened outdoor patio is more intimate. Barboncino is a great place to meet up with some friends, for a low-key date, or even to just enjoy a pizza and a beer by yourself at the bar[3].Start with an appetizer: the Neapolitan Meatballs are just as good as an appetizer ($9) as they are as a pizza topping. The best part of the salumi board ($19) is the accompanying piece of pizza dough (or ""pizza pane""; which also comes in a garlic version for $4) freshly baked in the oven. I cannot praise enough the fire roasted peppers with burrata ($12): the peppers are drizzled with extra virgin olive oil, capers, and parsley are sweet and juicy, and the burrata is wonderfully light and milky. In fact, this burrata is absolutely delicious!The pizza menu is fairly basic, if not particularly innovative.- The Eggplant and Zucchini ($13; tomatoes, red pepper flakes, fiordilatte, garlic, and extra virgin olive oil) is perhaps my favorite pie: very flavorful, with a nice earthiness to it.- The Cremini Mushrooms and Fennel Sausage ($17; fiordilatte, garlic, thyme, pecorino romano, and extra virgin olive oil) sounded better than what it tasted, and fell a bit flat in flavor.- Similarly underwhelming was the Artichoke and Smoked Pancetta ($17; fiordilatte, garlic, pecorino romano, and extra virgin olive oil).- Soppressata Piccante ($15; tomatoes, fiordilatte, garlic, oregano, and extra virgin olive oil) was solid.- The Neapolitan Meatballs ($15; fiordilatte, house-made meatballs, parmigiano reggiano, basil, and extra virgin olive oil) is perhaps the best pie on the menu.- The Arugula ($14; cherry tomatoes, fiordilatte, shaved parmigiano reggiano) was nice, light, and refreshing. The pizza is excellent by itself, but add prosciutto di parma if you want some extra flavor ($4): it's tasty and comes just slightly crisp on the edges.- I am generally suspicious of seafood-based pizza, but the Cherry Stone Clam pie ($17; fiordilatte, garlic, parsley butter, and extra virgin olive oil) was nothing short of wonderful, and transformed me into a believer/worshipper.- A potato and anchovies white pizza served as a special was excellent, and in fact it would later become part of the regular menu -albeit briefly. A potato and rosemary white pizza special, on the other hand, left me unimpressed.For dessert, ice cream comes from Il Laboratorio del Gelato, and it's fantastic (I recommend hazelnut and pistachio). A tiramisu' dessert special[4] was surprisingly light and fluffyly delicious; I highly recommend it.Despite some shortcomings with some the toppings, the pizza here is consistently good. If this is their starting point, Barboncino set the bar pretty high.

"Yummmo. This place is just as good as Lombardi's but with a much shorter wait time and half the cost.

I tried their arugula, which is served with fresh shavings of parmigiano reggiano and cherry tomatoes on top of a bed of arugula, sauce and olive oil. No argument that it was tasty as hell, but it was quite soggy in the middle and made for an unpleasant fold :( I think the number of toppings and oils made it too heavy. Duly noted.  My friend went with the tried and true Margherita, which was pure bliss.

So, I opted for the Arugula. Delicious. Perfect! Will definitely come back now. Service: The staff was very accomodating to us.

"Why 3 stars? The dough was too soft for me. I like Roman pizza style of curst, thin and crunchy. Our pizza, one with anchovies and the other one is with artichoke, crusts were very soft. Nice idea for soft crust was that each pizza was cut in quarter (4 pieces) and made much easier to fold half and enjoy like sandwich. A wood-fired brick oven gave a nice smokiness and burn. I think tasty tomato suce helped this pizza but later I had a strong sign of MSG form it....?After, our waiter gave an invitation to celebrate one year anniversary card. It comes with free appetizer and pizza. My friend went back for the celebration but the line was out to the street and around the block with locals that wanted to come in but never had a chance. I thought it was very nice gesture of Barboncino to reach out to the neighbors this way.Just yesterday (12/07/2012) I found the owner sent me a message about MSG. This is his reply."".......I am very sorry you got heatburn after eating at Barboncino.  I obviously never want that to happen.  Regarding our tomato sauce, it is made with organic tomatoes, and a small amount of salt and olive oil, and nothing more.  I hope that helps!  Thank you so much!"" -- Ron B.",3.0
"Good pizza but not great pizza.  I've been to many coal oven places and I must say this wasn't bad in comparison but it could've been a tad better.  The quality of the ingredients was great, but the crust & dough were too soggy.  I had the half of the sopressata piccante and half margherita.  They were nice to enough to let us all do half of one and half of another as long as the base was the same.  I also shared an appetizer of the day which was mussels and garlic bread.  The bread was great, lots of garlic chunks and fresh herbs but the mussels sauce was so super spicy, almost too spicy to enjoy.They are very nice, accommodating and patient.  We were coming in at different times and able to order whenever we wanted.  Also My friend's pizza was completely charred in comparison to everyone else's in our group but they were nice enough to send it back and make her another.",4.0
"Okay there is a slight confusion here. This place is a hit or miss.The first time I came here was not so great. The pizza lacked any flavor and the crust was quite ""rubbery"" if you will.I decided to try this place again recently and I was honestly satisfied. I had the meatballs and Artichoke/Smoked Pancetta pizza.It was absolutely delicious! The crust was light, airy and buttery.The taste was amazing.The ambiance is great and the staff are cool peeps too. It's a cute, laid back type of spot. Great for a intimate meal or non pressure date.Hit or miss, so please don't rely on my review ;)",3.0
"I LOVE this place. Yes, it helps that it's across the street from me, but still... how can you not enjoy the pizzas here. Thin crust with options stemming from arugula (my favorite) to originals like margherita. Their starters are also great - all of their salads are a perfect way to start your meals. You can also come here with a crowd. I've been here with up to  6 friends and they're always willing to move things around and find a place for you.I will say that it is a popular establishment, so you will wait if you get there during the rush. The good thing is that they'll redirect you to their bar, where you can hang out and grab a drink while you wait for your table. The bartenders are super friendly and they have a great selection of beer, wine, and liquor, so I say get here and try the food. You won't regret it.",5.0
"Let me preface by first saying I use yelp all the time to read reviews on restaurants, but I rarely write about my experiences unless it is phenomenal or terrible. My most recent visit to Barboncino's was a phenomenal dining experience, so I wanted to share!I have been to Barboncino's before, and have always had a good experience there. But I recently went last week and the experience exceeded my already high expectations. My friend and I asked the waitress for a beer recommendation, and she provided us with an amazing light beer (similar to a hoegaarden) - and for 6 bucks each. We also each ordered a pizza - my friend got the margarita and I got the arugala pie with prosciutto. The margarita was to die for, as was the arugala pie.

"I took my roommate here to convince him to sign for an apartment in Crown Heights. We toured the apartment at 6. Ate here at 7. Signed at 10. I have been back innumerable times since. The salads are fine if you want to feel better about yourself. And the appetizers do no harm. But really, if I were you, just order pizza. About one per person, or three for four. The best ones are the artichoke and pancetta and the cremini mushroom and fennel sausage. There's a decent beer selection made better by a few cheap bottom-shelfers that you can't normally find in an establishment this nice - in case you don't want to splurge. There is a fun range of cocktails, some of which are reasonably-priced, others a little outlandish. The $10 sazerac (a good measure of a bar's cocktail-making capacity) falls on the affordable side, and they do it right.",4.0
"So happy to have a good pizza place in Crown Heights. The whole menu is good and all the have nice thin crispy crust, but I had to write a review mostly for 1 pie. The Cremini And Fennel Sausage pizza is almost magical. I don't even eat meat and I tried a bite of a friends once and now I find myself guiltily licking my fingers and looking for crumbs after i've polished off the whole thing...........I wish they delivered. So bad. But it's totally worth the trip.",4.0

"Why 3 stars? The dough was too soft for me. I like Roman pizza style of curst, thin and crunchy. Our pizza, one with anchovies and the other one is with artichoke, crusts were very soft. Nice idea for soft crust was that each pizza was cut in quarter (4 pieces) and made much easier to fold half and enjoy like sandwich. A wood-fired brick oven gave a nice smokiness and burn. I think tasty tomato suce helped this pizza but later I had a strong sign of MSG form it....?After, our waiter gave an invitation to celebrate one year anniversary card. It comes with free appetizer and pizza. My friend went back for the celebration but the line was out to the street and around the block with locals that wanted to come in but never had a chance. I thought it was very nice gesture of Barboncino to reach out to the neighbors this way.Just yesterday (12/07/2012) I found the owner sent me a message about MSG. This is his reply."".......I am very sorry you got heatburn after eating at Barboncino.  I obviously never want that to happen.  Regarding our tomato sauce, it is made with organic tomatoes, and a small amount of salt and olive oil, and nothing more.  I hope that helps!  Thank you so much!"" -- Ron B.",3.0
"Good pizza but not great pizza.  I've been to many coal oven places and I must say this wasn't bad in comparison but it could've been a tad better.  The quality of the ingredients was great, but the crust & dough were too soggy.  I had the half of the sopressata piccante and half margherita.  They were nice to enough to let us all do half of one and half of another as long as the base was the same.  I also shared an appetizer of the day which was mussels and garlic bread.  The bread was great, lots of garlic chunks and fresh herbs but the mussels sauce was so super spicy, almost too spicy to enjoy.They are very nice, accommodating and patient.  We were coming in at different times and able to order whenever we wanted.  Also My friend's pizza was completely charred in comparison to everyone else's in our group but they were nice enough to send it back and make her another.",4.0
"Okay there is a slight confusion here. This place is a hit or miss.The first time I came here was not so great. The pizza lacked any flavor and the crust was quite ""rubbery"" if you will.I decided to try this place again recently and I was honestly satisfied. I had the meatballs and Artichoke/Smoked Pancetta pizza.It was absolutely delicious! The crust was light, airy and buttery.The taste was amazing.The ambiance is great and the staff are cool peeps too. It's a cute, laid back type of spot. Great for a intimate meal or non pressure date.Hit or miss, so please don't rely on my review ;)",3.0
"I LOVE this place. Yes, it helps that it's across the street from me, but still... how can you not enjoy the pizzas here. Thin crust with options stemming from arugula (my favorite) to originals like margherita. Their starters are also great - all of their salads are a perfect way to start your meals. You can also come here with a crowd. I've been here with up to  6 friends and they're always willing to move things around and find a place for you.I will say that it is a popular establishment, so you will wait if you get there during the rush. The good thing is that they'll redirect you to their bar, where you can hang out and grab a drink while you wait for your table. The bartenders are super friendly and they have a great selection of beer, wine, and liquor, so I say get here and try the food. You won't regret it.",5.0
"Let me preface by first saying I use yelp all the time to read reviews on restaurants, but I rarely write about my experiences unless it is phenomenal or terrible. My most recent visit to Barboncino's was a phenomenal dining experience, so I wanted to share!I have been to Barboncino's before, and have always had a good experience there. But I recently went last week and the experience exceeded my already high expectations. My friend and I asked the waitress for a beer recommendation, and she provided us with an amazing light beer (similar to a hoegaarden) - and for 6 bucks each. We also each ordered a pizza - my friend got the margarita and I got the arugala pie with prosciutto. The margarita was to die for, as was the arugala pie. The crust was perfect, plenty of cheese, and the prosciutto tasted amazing with the arugala. They also have a great spicy oil that you can add to the pizza.

"I just came back from dinner from Barboncino and I wanted to write this review while it's still clear in my head. First off, I rarely come to Brooklyn, I was around the area because I went to visit the Brooklyn Museum. So I decided to Yelp what was good to eat around the area after a long day at the museum. Barboncino caught my eye. When I entered, there was three couples in front of us waiting for the Hostess to seat us all. (Strike 1) The hostess was no where to be seen or heard. We all literally waited ten whole minutes for her to even show up at her hostess counter. (Strike 2) Then a party of 8 showed up after us and they got seated before us.(Strike 3) She finally acknowledged us and ask us how many people. Before she seats us she then stepped away to give out menus to the party of 8. She came back and ask a customer that just walked in how many people. I was like ""uhh, we are here first"" Why can't she just seat us first?! Like really?! It just doesn't make sense!Ok let's talk about the food. The menu is really small. Their main focus are their pizzas. The pizza was soggy and was like not dry or crispy on the bottom. The meatballs were good though. To conclude this review. I am never coming back or recommending anybody. And the hostess needs to go take a Hostess 101 class and learn the basics of good customer service.",2.0

"Margherita pizza is not to be beat! Once in a while for variety we'll get this delicious special pizza that was once on offer (dried cherries and gorgonzola cheese-- ask for it!), but ideally we'd always ever like it in a 1:3 ratio with the margherita, which means that more often than not we just suffice ourselves with that.Beware: Dough is extra chewy! (Like, so delicious to eat but P90x for the jaw!) Center can get soggy! I've played around with ordering it extra crispy and more often than not, it comes back not even. Luckily however I realized that this is just the way it's meant to be, so don't be alarmed. This is fork-and-knife pizza if I ever saw it. (Still use my hands though.)Also, have to say that my partner and I had a FANTASTIC time here for the Super Bowl (my first as active participant and not resistant bystander). Projector screens were up everywhere as well as 2 plasma screens. We were in the nook behind the bar and couldn't have been happier, no traffic! We ordered a glorious 3 beers, 3 pizzas (2 margheritas and one special, duh), and the HUGE nutella calzone with scoops of strawberry, chocolate, and vanilla gelato. Would not advise ever getting this amount of food unless you're stoned though. It really isn't a normal amount for 2 people, even for a 3 hour affair-- and we're marathon eaters.

"3.5 Stars. (Yelp really need to allow 1/2 stars.)The pizza at Barboncino is a neapolitan style of pizza.  It's softer and more bread like rather than the thin and crispy  ""NY"" style of pizza.  I'm more of a fan of the thin and crispy style but don't mind mixing it up with a good neapolitan pie every once in a while.  Barboncino's pizza is good. Barboncino's pizza is right up there with the other neapolitan pizza place I've tried. (Paulie Gee's, Roberta's, etc.)  The space is really large and airy and bright - and when we, my girlfriend and I, went, a Tuesday around 7pm, we were able to get a seat right away.The CherryStone Clam pizza was good - it's no Frank Pepe's - but it'll do in a pinch.  They served whole clams rather than minced clams which was nice - i just wish there were more of them.  They were just too many clamless bites.  The bites with clams were great, the ones without were a little bit flat.  Adding some red pepper flakes helped add some depth to the pizza overall.The Margherita was very good with a nice, fresh tomato tasting sauce.  One of the better Margheritas I've had actually.  My only issues were some service errors.  We ordered the Caprese Salad Special with Burrata, a milky mozzerella, and our silverware was coated in the stuff.  We piled our appetizer plates on top of each other, then our silverware on top of that - thinking the waiter would take the whole thing away and replace our silverware.  Nope.  He actually removed the dirty silverware, placed them back on the the table, and took the plates away.  Ummm...Not a huge deal but kind of ruined the moment.I was intrigued by several other pizza combinations so we'll be back. (Especially since the kitchen is open late.)  If they work on the service a little bit more it would increase the overall pleasant dining experience and make it more of a ""go to"" place for me.",3.0

"3.5 Stars. (Yelp really need to allow 1/2 stars.)The pizza at Barboncino is a neapolitan style of pizza.  It's softer and more bread like rather than the thin and crispy  ""NY"" style of pizza.  I'm more of a fan of the thin and crispy style but don't mind mixing it up with a good neapolitan pie every once in a while.  Barboncino's pizza is good. Barboncino's pizza is right up there with the other neapolitan pizza place I've tried. (Paulie Gee's, Roberta's, etc.)  The space is really large and airy and bright - and when we, my girlfriend and I, went, a Tuesday around 7pm, we were able to get a seat right away.The CherryStone Clam pizza was good - it's no Frank Pepe's - but it'll do in a pinch.  They served whole clams rather than minced clams which was nice - i just wish there were more of them.  They were just too many clamless bites.  The bites with clams were great, the ones without were a little bit flat.  Adding some red pepper flakes helped add some depth to the pizza overall.The Margherita was very good with a nice, fresh tomato tasting sauce.  One of the better Margheritas I've had actually.  My only issues were some service errors.  We ordered the Caprese Salad Special with Burrata, a milky mozzerella, and our silverware was coated in the stuff.  We piled our appetizer plates on top of each other, then our silverware on top of that - thinking the waiter would take the whole thing away and replace our silverware.  Nope.  He actually removed the dirty silverware, placed them back on the the table, and took the plates away.  Ummm...Not a huge deal but kind of ruined the moment.I was intrigued by several other pizza combinations so we'll be back. (Especially since the kitchen is open late.)  If they work on the service a little bit more it would increase the overall pleasant dining experience and make it more of a ""go to"" place for me.",3.0
"If you read my reviews regularly--and of course you do, why wouldn't you--then you know that I love two things: em-dashes, and restaurants very close to my apartment. So you should be SHOCKED and INTRIGUED that I love Barboncino so much that I'm a legit regular here and it's in an entirely different neighborhood from where I live.The pizza is just so god damn delicious... and the bartenders make a mean Manhattan.

"I've been here three times in the last year and been disappointed with each visit. The food is good--but not exceptional--but hardly warrants the slipshod service. The first time I went, a year ago, the service was slow. It was not busy, a week night. The server seemed more interested in himself and his coworkers than us. We waited a long, long time to place an order--we had to beg him to take it. It was a farewell dinner, so we let it slide. That friend returned in late spring, and I begrudgingly returned. Maybe this time it will be different! Everyone likes it! It was a busy Saturday night, so I did not mind the two hour wait for our modestly sized party. We waited in the bar, a very busy space, where I was routinely run over by other patrons. Still, this is New York, that's fine. Except... we watched other parties our size give their name and sit 20 minutes later. I was the only one miffed, as I was the only person who wasn't absolutely hammered. We even watched the entire front turn over several times with groups our size and larger. At one point our waitress pointed to a two-top in a booth and promised that it was our table, if the guests would just LEAVE. (If you're throwing them under the bus, what chance to we have?) We ordered our food as soon as we sat, which was fine--but we received another table's food. They had a similar order (except we had salad, and they had arugula pizza), and we tried in vain to have SOMEONE confirm that the kitchen made a mistake. We ate our food after several minutes--and maybe 15 minutes after that the waitress came to take it away. The third time was another heel-dragging episode, with an out of town relative I had previously denied the Barboncino experience. The food was still good, but the service was a mess. This time we were a two-top seated ahead of a more disserving couple. We said we'd sit anywhere, but they did too. The waitress even said that we were skipping the line. We gave our name to three different people, and then we had a hard time placing our order (just as I had a year ago). After the order WAS placed multiple servers approached us. ""Thanks so much, we've put in our order!""The waitress knew the table next to us. I admit that I'll hook up a friend when I'm at work, but there's no discretion in stage whispering. And free drinks, entrees, and desserts is downright injurious when you're starving. The good news for me is that third time's the charm.

My friend and I split the arugula salad, which was fresh and springy with interesting, flavorful pesto-dusted cherry tomatoes, pine nuts and just enough oil to temper the natural bitterness of the greens. We also had the meatballs appetizer: four simple meatballs the size of baby's fists in a basic marinara sauce with some sprigs of parsley, just like grandma made back in the old country (your grandma; mine was too busy making matzo balls).For our main course, we split the eggplant and zucchini pizza, which is dotted with concentric circles of very thinly-sliced eggplant and zucchini brushed in oil and cooked just enough to make them taste awesome.

"I'm racked with guilt, but for some reason, I just don't love this like I think I should. Why? I don't know. Everything was good. The spinach salad, served with apples and goat cheese, was exactly the kind of salad that I love and make for myself all the time. My date and I shared the cremini and sausage pizza, which tasted just like a mushroom and sausage pizza should taste. Arguably, even better, since the crust was good, cheese was fresh, and I never have anything bad to say about mushrooms.Was it that I just wanted to be blown away? There is certainly no shortage of epic-level pizza in NEW YORK CITY. I mean, come on. Perhaps the fact that apples-goatcheese-spinach salad IS in fact something I can make myself was not the most impressive. The pizza wasn't sloshed in truffle oil, which can definitely get trite and overused in cuisine these days, but perhaps without it I was missing that umami quality.I don't know.

I love everything on the menu, many do not know they have brunch, and boy is it ever deeeeeelicious. Everybody I've taken here LOVES this place. Don't miss out!",5.0
"Excellent. As soon as this place moved into the neighborhood everyone knew it'd be great. The  wait is sometimes annoying because it's gotten so popular, but just go across the street to Franklin Park and have a drink while you wait. The meatball appetizer is great and every pizza on the menu is excellent.",4.0
"I'm racked with guilt, but for some reason, I just don't love this like I think I should. Why? I don't know. Everything was good. The spinach salad, served with apples and goat cheese, was exactly the kind of salad that I love and make for myself all the time. My date and I shared the cremini and sausage pizza, which tasted just like a mushroom and sausage pizza should taste. Arguably, even better, since the crust was good, cheese was fresh, and I never have anything bad to say about mushrooms.Was it that I just wanted to be blown away? There is certainly no shortage of epic-level pizza in NEW YORK CITY. I mean, come on. Perhaps the fact that apples-goatcheese-spinach salad IS in fact something I can make myself was not the most impressive. The pizza wasn't sloshed in truffle oil, which can definitely get trite and overused in cuisine these days, but perhaps without it I was missing that umami quality.I don't know. Everything is obviously great, so it deserves no less than 4 stars, but I just can't give it 5.",4.0

"My fiancee and I were in the neighborhood checking out Brooklyn Botanic Garden, but we decided to swing by Barboncino for lunch before heading over. The storefront is rather unassuming, and it initially looks like there's only a small bar space in the front - but there's plenty of seating in the back, both on a slightly elevated upstairs and downstairs as well. It wasn't too crowded at this time, so getting seated was a cinch, and service was pretty straightforward and quick. For a pizza joint, I will say that their orange juice is pretty solid and definitely fresh-squeezed...something I appreciate, given that there are a good number of brunch joints that will stick you with concentrated OJ.That said, the pizza here is phenomenally good. My only complaint is that the menu doesn't make it apparently clear if you can take a 'choose your own' approach to what toppings you have on your pizza. We ended up splitting a margherita pizza and the 'breakfast' pizza on the menu (pancetta and fried egg). The margherita was classically good - fresh mozzarella, a proper amount of basil, and a crust that was crisp in a couple places, but otherwise had the right amount of firmness so that the thin crust didn't become too soggy. The pancetta and fried egg was fantastic and was far superior to the breakfast pizza I've tried at Forcella. Instead of being too thick and piled with too much toppings, the pancetta is chopped up and sprinkled throughout the pizza. There's one egg that is fried on the middle of the pie, and there's a little pecorino that's mixed in with the mozzarella. In all - it's a really good pie that works extremely well as a brunch pie. Both pies were 12 inches in diameter, so you'll be pretty filled up if you have a ratio of a pie per person.I do wish Barboncino was closer, as this is one of the better 'newer' pizza joints I've been to around NYC. Everything tastes fresh and is made on the spot, and it's a really chill atmosphere to eat at or hang out at the bar. The exposed brick wall adds a certain homey comfort to the restaurant, making it the perfect place to hang out with a group of friends. It's not too far from Manhattan, though, so I definitely do plan on coming back!",5.0
"Fantastic pizza with super fresh ingredients and well-honed preparation.   I've had a few good meals here.   It's the perfect place when you want real wood fired oven pizza.  As an obnoxious food & bev person, I usually order a couple things and make a mish mash plate at my table and this works out perfectly here.  Their clam pizza is fantastic...instead of big chunks of clam, they finely chop it with parsley/garlic and it's almost like a clam puree/spread layered under the cheese.  Toss some arugula salad on there and squirt it with lemon and you will have heaven in a bite.  I love their homemade chili oil too, it's especially nice on the meatball pizza.   My boyfriend is also a picky food & bev professional and he was pleased with our last visit, during which we also had the burrata appetizer.  We had to practically roll ourselves out of there and had not one complaint.  Romantic lighting and atmosphere on a weeknite too if you're on a date.",4.0

For a pizza joint, I will say that their orange juice is pretty solid and definitely fresh-squeezed...something I appreciate, given that there are a good number of brunch joints that will stick you with concentrated OJ.That said, the pizza here is phenomenally good. My only complaint is that the menu doesn't make it apparently clear if you can take a 'choose your own' approach to what toppings you have on your pizza. We ended up splitting a margherita pizza and the 'breakfast' pizza on the menu (pancetta and fried egg). The margherita was classically good - fresh mozzarella, a proper amount of basil, and a crust that was crisp in a couple places, but otherwise had the right amount of firmness so that the thin crust didn't become too soggy. The pancetta and fried egg was fantastic and was far superior to the breakfast pizza I've tried at Forcella. Instead of being too thick and piled with too much toppings, the pancetta is chopped up and sprinkled throughout the pizza. There's one egg that is fried on the middle of the pie, and there's a little pecorino that's mixed in with the mozzarella. In all - it's a really good pie that works extremely well as a brunch pie. Both pies were 12 inches in diameter, so you'll be pretty filled up if you have a ratio of a pie per person.I do wish Barboncino was closer, as this is one of the better 'newer' pizza joints I've been to around NYC. Everything tastes fresh and is made on the spot, and it's a really chill atmosphere to eat at or hang out at the bar. The exposed brick wall adds a certain homey comfort to the restaurant, making it the perfect place to hang out with a group of friends. It's not too far from Manhattan, though, so I definitely do plan on coming back!",5.0
"Fantastic pizza with super fresh ingredients and well-honed preparation.   I've had a few good meals here.   It's the perfect place when you want real wood fired oven pizza.  As an obnoxious food & bev person, I usually order a couple things and make a mish mash plate at my table and this works out perfectly here.  Their clam pizza is fantastic...instead of big chunks of clam, they finely chop it with parsley/garlic and it's almost like a clam puree/spread layered under the cheese.  Toss some arugula salad on there and squirt it with lemon and you will have heaven in a bite.  I love their homemade chili oil too, it's especially nice on the meatball pizza.   My boyfriend is also a picky food & bev professional and he was pleased with our last visit, during which we also had the burrata appetizer.  We had to practically roll ourselves out of there and had not one complaint.  Romantic lighting and atmosphere on a weeknite too if you're on a date.",4.0

"It definitely was not the best pizza i've ever had. That distinguished title is still held by Pronto's Pizza on Staten Island (the penne ala vodka slice is AMAZING). My friend & I came here for brunch. We shared the Margharita pizza & the pizza with artichokes (not sure of the name). Both pizza's were pretty good although I liked the one with the artichokes better.The price for the two pizzas was about $30. The pizza's were 4 slices each. That's about $7.50 per slice. Although the pizza was good, I don't see myself spending that kind of money on pizza any time soon.The service was okay. Not great. Not bad. I would definitely go back for the dinner menu some time in the distant future.",3.0
"Okay brunch. Great ambiance.The brunch pizzas had a nice charred crust, but they weren't great. Besides the one pancetta and egg pie, the menu doesn't feel suited for the breakfast part of brunch, only for lunch/dinner.  The Blue Bottle French-pressed coffee was weak, as it didn't have enough grounds.",3.0

"The pizza was pretty good and the restaurant had a great atmosphere. I wouldn't say it was one of the best, but definitely a nice option for late night pizza.

"Oh Barboncino, how have I not written about you yet?!Drinks are delicious, staff are extremely attractive but the pizza tops it all. The crust is chewy and tender at the same time.

"This place looks pretty nondescript from the street and is easy to miss, but the food is great. We got there in time for happy hour, which featured $4 draft beers. We waited at the bar for the rest of our party to arrive and got seated right away, although we were right next to the door. The hung curtains just inside the door to help keep the cold air out. As for the food and service, both were good. Our server seemed a bit intoxicated, but he was very friendly. The appetizer of pancetta wrapped around goat cheese served on top of an apple slice had a perfect balance of textures, saltiness and tanginess. Four pieces cost about $10, but that's not unexpected for this restaurant. The cremini and fennel sausage pizza I got had a wonderfully light crust with some light char and the right amount of cheese. The mushrooms and chunks of sausage were flavorful and looked appealing on the pie. This place has great food and a nice atmosphere, I will definitely be going back in the future.",5.0

"This is the pizza experience I was hoping for on my first visit to Brooklyn! A good friend of mine had read glowing reviews in Time Out, and being in walking distance to her place, we decided to check it out. We were pretty hungry by the time we got there, having had drinks at a nearby pub just before. We were quoted a 40 minute wait time for a table at 7:30 on a Sunday night, so we just decided to get it to go. It would have been nice to linger over dinner in what looked like a pretty intimate, warm space, but we were starving! Within about 7-10 minutes of ordering, we were walking out the door with three hot boxes of pizza. Thank God for wood-fired ovens! We ordered the Arugula, Eggplant and Zucchini, and the Margarita. Hands down the Arugula was the best. The salty shavings of parmigiano reggiano mixed with its peppery salad accompaniment made for a perfectly balanced pizza. The Eggplant and Zucchini pizza was good, but nothing special. The Margarita was pretty fantastic. All the ingredients were pure and fresh, cleanly distinguishable on your taste buds. Perfection. This was also the first time I've tried flor di latte mozzarella, which was on all the pizzas. It made for such creamy goodness in each bite.  Chicago pizza just can't compete.",5.0

"Barboncino does a lot of things right.  First off the space is large inside with room for larger groups.  Second, the drinks are great.  The manhattan is my favorite but they use quality liquors and have a throwback feel to their cocktail selection.  The food is simple but excellent.  It's a small menu with a few starters and pizza options.  The standout starters are the white bean pesto and roasted peppers with burrata.  You have to try the artichoke and pancetta pizza as well as the clam one.  A few of the things that could be better.  The dessert menu is non-existant.  Their only option is gelato and after eating it, it felt more like ice cream than gelato.  Very airy instead of the dense decadent gelato I'm used to.  The menu needs to be expanded.  I get doing a couple things and doing them really well but they need to keep up the variety to ensure neighborhood regulars return.  Maybe a special here and there just to change it up.  Minor complaints in the grand scheme of things but a great addition to the neighborhood.",4.0
"Pizza is good.Cold beer is good.Barboncino has both. They have several kinds of each, from the basic (though thoroughly delicious) like margherita and peroni to the more adventurous like cherry stone clams and a seasonal local brewery offering. You can have your pizza on the cheap (about $15), or you can team it up with appetizers like white beans and pesto, or cheese/meat boards and drinks to make it thoroughly fantastic. The service is always bubbly and attentive. The cocktails are stiff. The dough is fluffy, crispy, and stretchy all at once and in all of the best ways. Probably my favorite place in the neighborhood.",5.0

"This may just be my favorite new neopolitan pizza. First time at the restaurant, I ordered a margherita - as usual - to test out how much I like the pizza. My friend ordered the gorgonzola/pear.It was nice to have the diversity - two very different pizzas - and holy holyyyy cheese, were they both fantastic. Beautiful sauce, perfect thinness, perfect crisp to it, but also bendy. And the cheese was just delightful. It seriously has every element pinned to perfection. The friend's pizza was also just flippin' wonderful.The restaurant also does pretty much everything else well, too. Great drink list (wine/beer). Super cute pizzaiolo making the pizzas. Sweet waitress, who was attentive and said we were pretty (compliments give restaurants a +1 in this narcissist's book, haha). The space itself was amazing - it looks like a farmhouse dining room, all wood and antique, it has two levels and plenty of light. They will soon be opening their outside space as well.",5.0
I like the atmosphere and the staff but the pizza is soggy on top or burnt a little too much. It lacks consistency.  Otherwise I would come often. Improve your pizza!  There's room for improvement. ( :,3.0

"Loved the decor, the pizza not so much. It wasn't bad but i'll take Saraghina any day over Barboncini. The pizza got cold really fast, the tomato sauce was so runny the dough was moist by the time it got to the table. Service was excellent so i wouldn't  mind coming back.",3.0

Choosing 3 of their 8 or so flavors was a different story but once I finally did make my decision, I did not regret it in the least. Dulco de leche (sweet caramel-esque goodness), amaretto crunch (new, as interestingly good tasting as it sounds), and strawberry (because classics are necessary). He in turn got tiramisu and said it passed his taste test. All in all our bill was about $50 which isn't terrible for dinner and dessert for two.

"I'd been meaning to try this spot, but never got around to it since I live across the street from a pizza place (not even remotely comparable), and never seem to be in the mood for pizza. But I was so glad I did finally do Barboncino! Neopolitan pizza is my favorite style with ultra-fresh ingredients, and an old-world type method, so the inner gourmet foodie in me was full of glee - heehee! But I have to say that I was impressed with the light bodied, just delicious glasses of red wine I enjoyed while I was here! The margarita pizza was a simple, but fulfilling choice. The quality of the pie was more important than the toppings, although the one with the clam on it was very tempting. That will be my choice on my next occasion.Ambiance was loud and boisterious, but not obnoxious. I'd describe the decor as trendy, loft-industrial version of rustic. I think this place is great for groups of friends, and pre-gaming. I saw someone bring children here, which I can understand, since they can be as loud as they want, but the kids seemed completely confused and overwhelmed by the chaotic atmosphere, noise level/acoustical combo and cried frequently, looking around frightened and confused. I felt sorry for them. My waiter was genuinely good at his job, very gregarious in a non-stiff but not laissez-faire servicey kinda way, not to mention extremely adorable and flirtatious in a way that totally rubbed me right, haha. I actually wish he had asked for my number like I saw that he wanted to, but he was probably worried about being professional or something...

"Pizza was the choice for tonight, and after checking out the Yelp reviews in the area, Barboncino's looked like the place to go.As one other reviewer mentioned, as soon as you step in the door, it's like you've walked into a completely different neighbourhood. Especially on a day as hot as today, the nicely air con'd environment was welcome. Very nicely styled inside, the owners have done a good job of making this place feel upmarket, but welcoming. This is helped by the great staff, who are very helpful and friendly. I should point out that after a week in New York, this was the best service we have had anywhere.I ordered the Fennel Sausage pizza, and my wife had the Meatball pizza. Both were delicious. The crust is not too thin, and although I'd rather not have the charred black bits where the dough bubbles up, it was still perfectly cooked. The tomato sauce on the meatball pizza tasted fresh, and the meats and cheese were all high quality. My only complaint would be that there could have been slightly more fennel sausage on my pizza. Other than that, really top quality pizza.Barboncino's also has a full bar inside, so I had a couple of cocktails, which were great. We also had dessert - I had the gelato: Hazelnut, Pistachio, and Fig, which was a great combo.

I think we visited at the perfect time, too: a sunny day, with light streaming through the windows, early dinnertime. Though it filled up later, it was nice to start with an early dinner in a place where we could hear ourselves talk. Service was perfect -- prompt but not overbearing. We even ordered dessert -- which is generally my measure of good service, as it's as much about effective but non-pushy salesmanship as it is about what's actually on offer. I always WANT it, but I never NEED it -- and our server at Barboncino somehow convinced us to have the gelato, which was delicious. Well done, Barboncino. We'll be back.",4.0

Luckily for us it was just busy enough in a chill, soothing sort of way. (9:30 p.m. on a Friday.)We shared the Bib lettuce salad with Gorgonzola and toasted walnuts - absolutely delish! And the pizzas were great as well. The best way to think of this is as a traditional trattoria - casual, simple fare that sticks to the basics and gets 'em right.

Once the idea was planted though, I couldn't give up on the idea. The meatballs - oh the salty porky meatballs! - I wanted to eat them, but in my bed. But you can't just eat meatballs for dinner on their own! What's a girl to do. If the girl is me, they call Barboncino looking for answers, and are offered meatballs with extra sauce for pickup (no delivery yet) and a ""garlic bread"" that's not on the menu. Hooray! My problems are solved! I'll make spaghetti, Barboncino will give me meatballs, and we will have spaghetti and meatballs. I would by lying to you if I didn't tell you I had some internal conflict about feeding my boyfriend meatballs and sauce made by someone else, but desperate times call for desperate measures.

This doesn't bother other people much, as friends I have shared pies with are much impressed. But for me, texture is paramount, and pie that has been saturated by moisture in the middle is big off point for the pizza, which is the only item on the menu. The toppings applied are excellent.

The decor is beautiful, wood paneled but well-lit, so it seems big and airy and cozy at the same time. Service was very attentive and everything came quickly! Like super quick, they must have had the pizza crusts ready in the wood-fired oven awaiting topping orders. We shared the arugula pizza and topped it with the proscuitto di parma. It was like a thin sheet of pizza with 6 inches of salad, meat, and cheese on top and kinda unwieldy to eat (I had to do an illegal foldover) but the pizza tasted amazing.

The wine I got (I wish I remember the name, it starts with an S...) was to die for!I'm not going to go into detail about which pizza is dope because they all are! I WILL say that you have to try the Arugula and tomato salad because that's simplicity in it's finest!

"I'm so lucky to have Barboncino a few blocks away from where I live. I swear, if I wasn't so worried about my waistline and the size of my wallet, I'd be dining here every night! I've been here a few times and the last time I took my mother, who couldn't stop talking about how delicious the pizza was!Besides the obvious highlight of the restaurant (the pizza!), I am in love with the ambiance and the cool jazz that is softly lingering in the background. The staff are awesome at what they do and are quite entertaining. It was always a pleasure ordering the food. Oh, and the wine! Oh-my-goodness. The wine I got (I wish I remember the name, it starts with an S...) was to die for!I'm not going to go into detail about which pizza is dope because they all are! I WILL say that you have to try the Arugula and tomato salad because that's simplicity in it's finest! And yes, I concur with the others - the Meatballs are succulent and when paired with the pizza, it's a heavenly combination.",5.0
"Barboncino is better than Grimaldi's, better than Totonnos, better than Patsy's, Better than Gruppo and Tappo, better than Lombardi's, better than Amorina, better than Franny's, way way WAY better than Two Boots, and yes, better than DiFara's. It is the most delicious pizza I have had in my life. Right up there with a delicious pie I shared with my friend in Rome.The dough is light, fluffy, squishy, and crispy, and cooked in 90 seconds. I too was skeptical of the new place on the block, but holy crap this place is worth it. The cheese is incredible. We had the Artichoke and Soppresata, mmmmmmmm! The salads were also delicious. We're going back ASAP.",5.0
This was the best pizza I had in New York so far. We went as a large group and ordered about four different pizzas with the salumi board and the cheese slate. The Artichoke & smoked pancetta was the best....full of flavor!The staff was friendly and patient. We had a great time!,4.0
"Great evening at Barboncino - I'm a big old sucker for delicious food and drink with a side of hipster. This place reminds me of some of my favorite joints in San Francisco, and that is a very good thing.We started with a drink at the bar while we waited for a table - I had their take on a Manhattan, which was delicious, a tad sweet for my tastes, but very yummy (and I tend to drink bourbon straight, so I may be biased).  The bar is comfy and serves the menu, so on another visit I would be up for just having a pizza or cheese slate (not plate, get it, I like it) at the bar.We moved to a table - the tables are close together, but the acoustics are good, so even in a full restaurant I had no problem hearing my friend or having a conversation. The decor is super appealing, brick, high ceilings, wood tables.  Service was great, struck the perfect medium between attentive and knowledgeable yet not over bearing.  We ordered the Neapolitan Meatballs to start and the Eggplant and Zucchini pizza. The meatballs (said by a former vegetarian) were absolutely delicious. I don't know what the blend of beef, pork, veal is, but they were super tender and almost melt in your mouth.  More of those are in my future.  The pizza did not disappoint - eggplant and zucchini were thinly sliced, eggplant wasn't breaded, and the crust was perfect. We weren't starving, so sharing one app and a pizza and we were both definitely satisfied. And had room for gelato...The gelato was DELICIOUS. You get to choose three flavors - we had hazelnut, pistachio, and dulce de leche.  It was served with a side of sea salt so you could create your own salty/sweet combo. There was not a grain of salt left - it was the PERFECT addition to the dessert.  I also had a glass of wine with the pizza - a valpolicella which was big and just what I was looking for.  If I'd had another glass I would've tried the Aglianico. Sigh, guess I have to return...",5.0
Went by on a Wed night and was seated almost immediately. I love the look of the place. Perfect lighting and good space while still feeling kind of intimate.

Just the right amount of lighting, spacious, while still pulling off the intimate vibe. perfecto.Must try: the Sopressata Picante, it was just all sorts of good.

"My roommate & I have been waiting for the ""Brick Oven Pizza"" mystery storefront to finally open, and last week we hit up the new Barboncino's for the first time. It was a weekday, and slow (they're still trying to get their liquor license, so they aren't getting the bar crowd right now). We got the artichoke & smoked pancetta, as well as a marinara pie for filler.The artichoke & smoked pancetta was amazing. Delicious. Marinara was a good, typical wood-fired marinara pie. Crusts were all nice, crispy, with a little smoky flavor but not too much. I hate when places undercook their crust so this is a plus.The atmosphere is really nice, it's very tastefully decorated, though roommate thought it was trying a little too hard, I disagree. Very cozy. Service was friendly and prompt, on top of things but not overbearing.I'll definitely be back to try the cherry stone clam pie.",5.0

"I never thought a piece of pizza could make me happy to be in Brooklyn... but this has proven me wrong.I could happily eat the crust by itself, but the toppings were incredible as well... just the right amount of garlic spread onto the crust so it isn't overbearing, and a thin but substantial coat of cheese does the trick. It was clearly made of very fresh ingredients, and their oven made parts of the crust a little blackened, which I love.I got the arugula pizza, which had enough arugula piled on top that it actually made me feel like I chose a healthy option... please don't feel the need to provide a reality check here. All of the options looked fantastic. There were also salads and apps on their relatively small menu.A large personal pizza (the only size they have) runs between $13-16, and while I could have easily downed the whole thing, I was plenty full after eating half and very full after 3/4.

"Napolitano style, wood burning, brick oven pizza. Wow.I got a little backstory. The owner spent two years learning how to make napolitano style wood burning, brick oven pizza, in naples, italy. In the process, he imported an oven from one of the foremost brick oven makers in italy. So that big oven is actually imported from naples. And it was worth the effort. The pizza is thin crust, perfectly baked with a soft yet crispy crust. (I would just eat it as bread if i could, its that good). You can taste that it was wood-fired. It had just a little smoky taste that really made the pizza stand out. I had the artichoke and pancetta pizza. All the ingredients were delicious, and I especially liked the fresh cheese they used. Also - the ambiance. Come for a real brooklyn, exposed brick feel. The dining area looks like all the tables were hand made. Beautiful experience. Take a date, your family, bring all your friends. Whoever you want, you won't be disappointed. A great new addition to crown heights that will surely last as a neighborhood staple.",5.0
Superb pies and excellent service! I have eaten here twice now and am thoroughly impressed with the pies here. I have had the pepperoni and four cheese pizza the second time I went and adored it. We also imbibed on the Meatball appetizer and Goat cheese Spinach salad. Loved all of it!Wait staff is very hospitable and endearing. Feel of the restaurant is really cool like a Brasserie almost but one that is located in the Dolomites!,4.0
"I love it here.  This is truly great pizza.  The decor is subtle, yet trendy and they have an outdoor area. They have a great happy hour which I hope they keep--$2 draft beers.  I had a great date night here because we were able to slowly enjoy our night and eat our dinner without being rushed at all.  The only reason I give 4 stars instead of 5 is the take out and lack of delivery.  We live about 4 blocks from here and we love this pizza, so we occasionally take out.  Every single time we get home, we have to put the pizza in the oven or have it cold.  Don't get me wrong, it is still good cold, but for the price I would rather have hot pizza.  Maybe their boxes need some insulation or they should start delivering and use a pizza bag, but take out really shouldn't exist here. A continuation...I decided to add to this review since I have run into a deterrent from eating here three times now--The standoffish, tall blonde woman who stands at the front.  As a person who works in the hospitality industry I find it important to point out when there is a continuous issue at a restaurant.   1. I went to get take out and when I gently complained that we keep getting home with cold pizza I was met by the tall woman with anything but sympathy.  She angrily explained that the pizza cooks quickly and isn't meant for take out.  Well I only live 4 blocks away and still love the cold pizza, but maybe you should have told me that when I ordered?  Maybe I should have gotten an apology?  I suggested it could be insulated with tinfoil.  She explained that that just wasn't possible singe they only have tinfoil sheets that won't fit around the box.  Okay, well we still went back. 2. My boyfriend and I went in for a romantic night and we were greeted by the tall woman who ignored us and then said it would be a while as she seated a couple and their baby.  I get it, you want to seat a couple with a baby first, but we were there first and if she had asked if we minded I would have said it was not problem and we would get a drink at the bar. 3. We came in for dinner and were not greeted by the tall woman.  We asked for a table for two.  She said there was a couple ahead of us and that we would need to wait for the hostess.  WELL WHO ARE YOU THEN?  We discussed throughout dinner the options for who this Tall Woman could possible be if she were not the hostess?  A suggestion to the Tall Woman-- Greet your customers before telling them there is a wait and that other customers are more important.  Try to help customers and find solutions.  You are in the service industry and not meant to drive customers away, so please stop.  We love this restaurant and will continue to go here despite the tall woman, but in the interest of Barboncino, educate your staff on proper treatment of paying customers.",4.0

"They struck all the right notes with me tonight, great food with wonderful service in a very pleasant atmosphere. They manage to make it feel like 'going out' without being ostentatious, from the prices to the decor and everything in between. This was exactly what the neighborhood needed! We ordered the cheese slate, which was delicious and balanced - it came with wonderful bread and a drizzle of honey. The spinach salad was fresh, nothing special but very good. For the pizza we chose the arugula with prosciutto and the cremini with fennel sausage, both were excellent! The arugula pizza was like a salad on top of a pizza, I was sort of expecting the arugula to be wilted but it was very good none-the-less. The mushroom and sausage was excellent, I would be hard pressed to choose which one I liked the most. All of this for three people seemed about perfect. Not sure about the desserts as we had something waiting at home. Next time we go we'll be sure to BYOB while they wait on their liquor license, the bar sure does look sad with no booze in stock but I'm sure it will be quite nice once operational. So far I'm impressed with the place and definitely plan on going back in the very near future.**edit** They are NOT BYOB, it would jeopardize their ability to get final approval for their liquor license. Found out the hard way, but more than happy to sacrifice my store bought beer for the sake of a full bar in the near future.",5.0

I loved the arugula pizza, the clam pizza, and the mushroom and sausage pizza.

"Excellent space. Wonderful staff and nice atmosphere. I didn't think it was loud at all despite some previous viewers comments. My old lady hates Neutral Milk Hotel because it's too noisy but loved this place's volume level. Prices are completely affordable. Food was great and cocktails strong. We shared the meatballs and the artichoke pizza. Both were great. Favorite meatballs in the city were late Mia Dona and these are close. I love Nice Pizza up the street and this place is an excllent more romantic alternative. The pizza is chewy instead of thin and crunchy but equally exquisite. Great date spot. If you can, get Jaime as your waiter, pleasurable, attentive and knowledgable. Great place as a destination or even if lucky enough to be a local.",5.0
"Yummm. Having lived in Italy, I am a pizza snob. This pizza was delicious. Crust was crispy on the outside, yet soft and plush in the middle; sauce was delicious, and had the perfect amount of fresh mozzarella cheese. My parents took my husband and I here for his birthday dinner because he wanted meatballs, his favorite food. The meatballs did NOT disappoint. And my dad, who is a bigger snob than I am, loved the food as well. Our waitress was extremely friendly, and service was good overall. Highly recommend!",4.0
"From the curb you don't expect much, but the second you walk in the door you enter this warm and inviting restaurant. The unfinished decor is charming and the pizza and wine were delicious.

"Napolitano style, wood burning, brick oven pizza. Wow.I got a little backstory. The owner spent two years learning how to make napolitano style wood burning, brick oven pizza, in naples, italy. In the process, he imported an oven from one of the foremost brick oven makers in italy. So that big oven is actually imported from naples. And it was worth the effort. The pizza is thin crust, perfectly baked with a soft yet crispy crust. (I would just eat it as bread if i could, its that good). You can taste that it was wood-fired. It had just a little smoky taste that really made the pizza stand out. I had the artichoke and pancetta pizza. All the ingredients were delicious, and I especially liked the fresh cheese they used. Also - the ambiance. Come for a real brooklyn, exposed brick feel. The dining area looks like all the tables were hand made. Beautiful experience. Take a date, your family, bring all your friends. Whoever you want, you won't be disappointed. A great new addition to crown heights that will surely last as a neighborhood staple.",5.0
Superb pies and excellent service! I have eaten here twice now and am thoroughly impressed with the pies here. I have had the pepperoni and four cheese pizza the second time I went and adored it. We also imbibed on the Meatball appetizer and Goat cheese Spinach salad. Loved all of it!Wait staff is very hospitable and endearing. Feel of the restaurant is really cool like a Brasserie almost but one that is located in the Dolomites!,4.0
"I love it here.  This is truly great pizza.  The decor is subtle, yet trendy and they have an outdoor area. They have a great happy hour which I hope they keep--$2 draft beers.  I had a great date night here because we were able to slowly enjoy our night and eat our dinner without being rushed at all.  The only reason I give 4 stars instead of 5 is the take out and lack of delivery.  We live about 4 blocks from here and we love this pizza, so we occasionally take out.  Every single time we get home, we have to put the pizza in the oven or have it cold.  Don't get me wrong, it is still good cold, but for the price I would rather have hot pizza.  Maybe their boxes need some insulation or they should start delivering and use a pizza bag, but take out really shouldn't exist here. A continuation...I decided to add to this review since I have run into a deterrent from eating here three times now--The standoffish, tall blonde woman who stands at the front.  As a person who works in the hospitality industry I find it important to point out when there is a continuous issue at a restaurant.   1. I went to get take out and when I gently complained that we keep getting home with cold pizza I was met by the tall woman with anything but sympathy.  She angrily explained that the pizza cooks quickly and isn't meant for take out.  Well I only live 4 blocks away and still love the cold pizza, but maybe you should have told me that when I ordered?  Maybe I should have gotten an apology?  I suggested it could be insulated with tinfoil.  She explained that that just wasn't possible singe they only have tinfoil sheets that won't fit around the box.  Okay, well we still went back. 2. My boyfriend and I went in for a romantic night and we were greeted by the tall woman who ignored us and then said it would be a while as she seated a couple and their baby.  I get it, you want to seat a couple with a baby first, but we were there first and if she had asked if we minded I would have said it was not problem and we would get a drink at the bar. 3. We came in for dinner and were not greeted by the tall woman.  We asked for a table for two.  She said there was a couple ahead of us and that we would need to wait for the hostess.  WELL WHO ARE YOU THEN?  We discussed throughout dinner the options for who this Tall Woman could possible be if she were not the hostess?  A suggestion to the Tall Woman-- Greet your customers before telling them there is a wait and that other customers are more important.  Try to help customers and find solutions.  You are in the service industry and not meant to drive customers away, so please stop.  We love this restaurant and will continue to go here despite the tall woman, but in the interest of Barboncino, educate your staff on proper treatment of paying customers.",4.0

"They struck all the right notes with me tonight, great food with wonderful service in a very pleasant atmosphere. They manage to make it feel like 'going out' without being ostentatious, from the prices to the decor and everything in between. This was exactly what the neighborhood needed! We ordered the cheese slate, which was delicious and balanced - it came with wonderful bread and a drizzle of honey. The spinach salad was fresh, nothing special but very good. For the pizza we chose the arugula with prosciutto and the cremini with fennel sausage, both were excellent! The arugula pizza was like a salad on top of a pizza, I was sort of expecting the arugula to be wilted but it was very good none-the-less. The mushroom and sausage was excellent, I would be hard pressed to choose which one I liked the most. All of this for three people seemed about perfect. Not sure about the desserts as we had something waiting at home. Next time we go we'll be sure to BYOB while they wait on their liquor license, the bar sure does look sad with no booze in stock but I'm sure it will be quite nice once operational. So far I'm impressed with the place and definitely plan on going back in the very near future.**edit** They are NOT BYOB, it would jeopardize their ability to get final approval for their liquor license. Found out the hard way, but more than happy to sacrifice my store bought beer for the sake of a full bar in the near future.",5.0

"Great cold cuts, great cheese, great pizza, great beer!Barboncino (""Poodle"" in Italian), is a restaurant where the quality matches the price.

"Walking in to Barboncino feels like leaving Brooklyn and going to a mountain lodge.  The ambiance is relaxing and calm, dimly lit.  The pizzas are tasty, but I don't think it's worth the price.  The crust is not that great, kind of tough by the time it cools and not that crispy thin new york pizza I love.  The toppings were delicious, I had a white pie with prosciutto and artichokes.  Beautiful presentation.  The chili garlic oil condiment is addictive.  But at $16 for a pie that is just enough for one person, I wouldn't go back.  Though I am really glad this place is in the neighborhood and I hope people keep coming here!!!",3.0

"How do I love thee? Let me count the ways! 1. The Pizza is ah-mazing! I usually order the margherita pizza. It's always cooked to perfection with just enough cheese and sauce on it. 2. If you haven't tried the cheese plate, please do so immediately! Four different types of cheeses with a delicious and soft  garlic bread with a side of honey. Honey you ask? Yes, honey! who knew that cheese, bread, and honey would compliment each other so well? Well it does. 3. Happy hour, you can get a $2 Yeungling Lager-yummy and refreshing. and last but not least 4. The staff is always super friendly and attentive. Take it from a fellow server. I love this place!",5.0
"Honestly - the artichoke and pancetta pizza is a freaking DELIGHT.  And, where on earth did they get those red peppers with that burrata cheese?  And that hazelnut gelato?  This was a fantastic dining experience beginning to end, complete with our adorable waiter and his flower pin.  I've been dying to check out Barboncino since it opened a few months back.  Let's be serious - I was dying to check it out for the eight trillion months it seemed like they were building it.  It did take a while for them to open, but now that I've been in - I see why!  The owners took so much care to get the ambiance of this place just right.  It's cozy... a new little home right here in Crown Heights.  Plus!  If you only want pancetta (or meat) on only half the pie, they're accommodating!  What more could you ask for?  I'll be a regular.",5.0

One of my favorite neighborhood spots. Great pizza and good for brunch too.,5.0
"Went here for brunch one morning. There was a large group of us and we each ordered a different pizza. Didn't really realize that we were each getting a whole pizza and we had plenty of food. Got to try a large variety of pizzas, and they were all delicious. Their breakfast pizza is a pancetta, eggs, and cheese. It was amazing. I am sometimes fearful of breakfast pizza being too eggy, but theirs wasn't.Most of the rest of their pizzas on their brunch menu are pretty standard pizzas, though all of them were delicious. They also had a caramelized apple and ricotta cheese pizza that was delicious as a dessert pizza.They also had a nice listing of brunch cocktails. I had a pear bellini which was sweet and refreshing.Service was quick and painless.",5.0
"Walking in to Barboncino feels like leaving Brooklyn and going to a mountain lodge.  The ambiance is relaxing and calm, dimly lit.  The pizzas are tasty, but I don't think it's worth the price.  The crust is not that great, kind of tough by the time it cools and not that crispy thin new york pizza I love.  The toppings were delicious, I had a white pie with prosciutto and artichokes.  Beautiful presentation.  The chili garlic oil condiment is addictive.  But at $16 for a pie that is just enough for one person, I wouldn't go back.  Though I am really glad this place is in the neighborhood and I hope people keep coming here!!!",3.0
"The pizza is drop dead delicious. The service is really friendly. We got there a little on the late side, but it was still busting at the bar. We came through the kitchen entrance and several people checked to make sure we were being taken care of. Our waitress was lovely, helpful, and didn't mind us chatting with her. The decor is so lovely, earthy and woody, it's just chic enough without sacrificing its cozy feel.And that pizza...just wow! Cheese has never tasted so good.",5.0

"How can I begin describe my experience at Barboncino?Fantastic, delicious, romantic, playful, fun...these words only scratch the surface...I happened into Barboncino one night this week with a girl that I have been seeing lately (we've only been on a couple dates, but we've got good chemistry).  When we walked in the door, our beautiful hostess greeted us and showed us to a table in the back.  The electric lighting is low, and the candles flicker and flitter.  Jazz plays in the background.  When I sat at our table and looked across the candle light into my date's eyes, I was filled with warmth and romance...and we hadn't even tasted the food.We decided to order the Neopolitan Meatballs and Bibb Salad as an appetizer...those meatballs...they melt in your mouth and the Bibb Salad is a crunchy, fresh good time (you've got to balance the carbs with some veggies, right?)...we ate our appetizers, the conversation flowed, our mouths chewed...Then the PIZZA came.  We ordered the Cherry Stone Clam and Artichoke Pancetta Pizza...they were the perfect mixture of burnt and dough-ey.  The cheese was melted softly on top of the dough, the clams were succulent and garlicky- the artichokes were bitter and the pancetta was a meaty treat...delicious...and as for the date?  It's going so well that we ordered desert.The gelato was delicious, of course.  How could it not be.  And by this time, I was having such a good time that I got out of my seat and moved next to my date.  I held her close.  We fed each other gelato.  Jazz played in the background.  The night ended with a garlicky kiss that was almost as good as the Cherry Stone Clam Pie.I think I will go back to this place.",5.0

Simply the best pizza I have had in a long time. Wonderful flavors and well made cocktails. The staff is so friendly too. Basically if you like great pizza go there. The crust and olive oil they use is probably the best part of it. Also tried their tiramisu and it was fantastic.,5.0

"I moved to New York from Italy seven years ago and am constantly on the lookout for authenticity in Italian food, and Barboncino gets it right every time. The quality of the food is immediately apparent, even before it ends up in your mouth - hence their ability to keep things simple. The drinks are also expertly made and absolutely delicious, and that much more fun to explore with helpful explanations by incredibly polite, hospitable, friendly and surprisingly efficient waitstaff. Absolutely no complaints. :)",5.0
Best pizza i had in a long long long time.  wow,5.0
"The pizza tastes good, but i agree with some of the other reviewers - the plate they serve it on somehow adds to the sogginess of the pizza and it really takes away from the whole experience.  Restaurant is beautiful inside and waitstaff was quick and friendly but I still wouldn't go back...",3.0
"This is probably my wife's and my favorite restaurant in town these days.  The food is great, the drinks are great, the staff has a culture of nice, and the vibe inside is great. The artichoke and pancetta pizza is my face, but I'd recommend to ask for it with the spicy honey on top -- that really makes it.  All the pizzas are good, that bread the use is our of this world. The salad with the cherries is also perfect.",5.0
"i've been here twice.once for a date and once for my birthday dinner. i think the fact that this is where i chose to go for my bday says a lot considering it still doesnt have a liquor license. what i love about this place is that it had no hype. i didnt read any reviews and i had no idea what i was going to get. i was pleasantly surprised both times.in my opinion, this place is better than totonno's, grimaldi's, roberta's, and paulie gee's. but definitely not better than difara's.  since this place is still so new (and totally uncrowded), the wait staff is especially attentive and aim to please.  i docked a star because it's pricey.i'm excited there's so much great food opening up in our hood.",4.0
"I eat a lot of pizza around NYC.  I think they make the best margharita pizza in the area that includes crown heights, prospect heights, park slope, and fort greene.  I doubt you can find better.  And a great atmosphere, so what's to lose?",5.0
Delicious pizza- cremini and sausage pancetta and artichoke were delicious. They need their freaking liquor license because the decor makes me want to get cozy with a drink. Super friendly staff. Will be a favorite!,4.0
Barboncino is a really fantastic and much needed pizza spot on Franklin. I've been waiting for it for a year and a half now and it has not disappointed. The decor is beautiful and the food is delicious. Great for a date night or a group spot. Can't recommend it highly enough.,5.0
Totally unexpected considering the neighborhood.  But the food is great! I even really like the salad.  The pizza is thin crust cooked to perfection!  I think they just got their liquor license so yay! Very attentive staff.,4.0
"This is a really beautiful restaurant and the pizza was awesome!! (the salad was delicious too!)  It has a casual atmosphere that makes you feel comfortable, yet exceptional service and ambiance that gives you that ""going out to dinner"" feeling, which is so nice to have in our neighborhood.  The bar areas are relaxed and you can imagine having wine and good conversation, or a pint of beer and a card game.  The food is out of this world.  We got the meatball pizza, and ordered a second!  I would say the only draw-back (if I am being very very picky about amazing food) is that they tend to slightly burn the pizza crusts.  It is still very doughy, so it can be easily overlooked.  The restoration and interior design is relaxing, cozy, and artful.Definitely make this spot your regular.",5.0
Stumbled upon this place and was very pleased. Very cozy set up. The pizza was good and tasted as if it was made with fresh ingredients. My fiance' loved the meatballs too. One pizza and an appetizer can feed two people. If not just get a pizza per person. Will be returning.,4.0
"Holy freakin' crap, this shit is the bomb.  Pizza, service, quality for price, I simply cannot name enough excellent things about Barboncino.  Bravo!!!!",5.0
"Pretty good, I'd say. Went for the pizza brunch, which I didn't know existed, and it was yummy pizza. I think it's wood-fire brick over style. I just had the margarita pizza, and it was great. They serve with a great chili oil (olive oil with chili in it). The bloody mary was OK, tasty, but very watery, but I prefer pulpy bloody mary's, so maybe you'll like it. Good beer and cocktail selection, some domestic and some imports. The waiter was polite, no wait to sit (we went around 2pm on a Saturday), seating was roomy/not cramped, drinks came right away and food came quickly (ten minutes). Could be good for kids, but don't worry, not swarming with them. Check it out sometime!",4.0
"This place took forEVER to open up. It was worth the wait; they overhauled the entire inside of that place and hired at LEAST one fantastically friendly and attentive server before our first visit. And at least five of their pizzas will change your life. Since we only ordered five, they're currently batting at one hundred percent.",4.0

"Just opened in October of 2011 and definitely a great new addition Crown Heights neighborhood. They pride themselves in authentic wood fired pizza and it's evident as you walk in and literally walk into the wood fired stove is right behind the hostess stand. Staff are welcoming, spunky and accommodating. I've only had the gellato--dulce de leche, hazelnut, and vanilla--were awesome, not Italian by any stretch of the imagination but a great 2nd place. The presentation of the preparation of the pizza is clever--the 'chef' slowly pulls each pie in and out the oven cooking each one to a golden char which entices onlookers debating whether or not to order one. Overall, it's a great spot especially for a date which I enjoyed every minute :) Definitely a must if you're looking for something nice, affordable (11-1a happy hour) and convenient right off the Franklin 4/5 stop. Check it out ;)",4.0
"Barboncino will ruin your life. It's not just that it dwarfs most other pizza in New York and easily holds its own among the best...Wait now stop and think about how big that statement is. Then think about the level to which your expectations of the pizza went up. I am telling you, even with expectations that high, the pizza will surpass them. It's that good. The rumor is they shipped the huge beautiful brick oven straight from Naples and reconstructed it right there in the shop. That oven gets so hot that your pizza cooks in under a minute--which is the secret not only to beautiful naan but to beautiful pizza (Did you know that good naan and good neapolitan pizza are brother and sister?). Anyway when you walk out, this pizza will haunt you...forever. It's not just that every other pizza you eat will taste not as good, it's that most things you do in your life will not be as good as Barboncino pizza. It's terrible. It's a terrible realization. So unless you're one of those super confident 'I'm so great and my life is awesome' people so far from any form of self doubt or depression (You people make me sick.), my recommendation, for the sake of your own mental health, is that you don't come here.",5.0
Nice chic pizza spot. And did I mention the magic words? Brick Oven! Chill atmosphere and good service. Worth checking out. Only 4 stars because they could do with some variety in their otherwise cutting edge menu. But the inside is well put together and a great place to dine.,4.0
"Ate hear the other night....and the place is cute! Salad was a joke....store bought dressing store bought arugula taste.....but i will say the pancetta and artichoke pizza was pretty serious....good brick oven taste nice chokes.......nothing wrong with a good brick oven pizza....that said thats all they have going on for them minus some specialty drinks....no delivery, nothing else redeemable on the menu...but hey brick oven pizza on franklin is still aight with me",3.0
"This place is great -- and not just great ""for the neighborhood"". Every pizza I've tried has been delicious, but it's a great experience all around. Really friendly people, great space (it's much bigger than it looks from the street), an interesting and thoughtful drink menu, and they have brunch now! You can even get french press Blue Bottle to go with it. Well worth the trip whether you're in the neighborhood or not.",5.0

"this year my sister decided her birthday was going to be a multiple event celebration. as such, dinner at the new pizza shop on franklin was on the agenda. yay! barboncino! i walk past this place on my way home and had been looking forward to checking it out. well alrighty then!it's a beautiful space featuring exposed brick, a giant wood burning oven and super cool light fixtures. the ambiance is laid back and the food is deeelish! we started out with the salumi board and moved on to shared four cheese with pepperoni and sopressata picante pizzas. mmmmm! so good and garlicky, i was glad i was out with my sisters and not on a date. the only part that sucked was the lack of spirits. i was very confused. i mean, why the giant bar if they don't serve alcohol? well. it turns out they don't have a liquor license yet. oh. and speaking of dates - barboncino is a great spot for a casual one, especially if you don't like the person you're dating. i keed. i keed. i'm joking, however i had to make it a point to mention the married couple sitting behind us who barely looked at each other, let alone speak. maybe it was just a really long day, however i'm glad they at least had the opportunity to enjoy a tasty meal (even if it was in silence).",4.0

And I love garlic.The crust was thick and doughy. Soft. Like the place itself.I can't say I'm a huge fan of Franny's, but Franny's has the same prices, and kicks this place's ass up and down the street, leaving it whimpering like the little doughy pies that it serves.",2.0
"artichoke and pancetta.  breakfast pizzas.  this spot is excellent for either dinner or brunch.  you can't go wrong with anything on the menu.  waitstaff can be a bit aloof - one waitress in particular is perfectly burnt out and narcissistic at the same time.  but the food always comes out fast and hot.   a lot more space here than it looks like from the outside, a very welcome addition to the neighborhood.",4.0
"Great spot for a date night!  Really nice atmosphere, not too loud, and delicious pizza and drinks.",4.0
"Maybe I had unreasonable expectations after seeing the 4.5-star Yelp average, but I don't understand what all the fuss is about. The pizza sauce was watery and bland, and the ""heirloom"" tomatoes on the caprese salad tasted no better than the supermarket variety. The atmosphere is perfect for an intimate date, but it doesn't really outweigh the mediocre food.",2.0
"The ambiance is wonderful, the staff are super nice, and it's overall a great dining experience. I just wished I liked the pizza better. The rest of their food that I've tried has been great (the meatballs, the cheese platter, the ice cream). I've tried 3 different flavors of their pizza and each one has been just *almost* really good. The crust is bit too thin and soggy, maybe. It's a shame because I love pizza and I love this place.",3.0
"this year my sister decided her birthday was going to be a multiple event celebration. as such, dinner at the new pizza shop on franklin was on the agenda. yay! barboncino! i walk past this place on my way home and had been looking forward to checking it out. well alrighty then!it's a beautiful space featuring exposed brick, a giant wood burning oven and super cool light fixtures. the ambiance is laid back and the food is deeelish! we started out with the salumi board and moved on to shared four cheese with pepperoni and sopressata picante pizzas. mmmmm! so good and garlicky, i was glad i was out with my sisters and not on a date. the only part that sucked was the lack of spirits. i was very confused. i mean, why the giant bar if they don't serve alcohol? well. it turns out they don't have a liquor license yet. oh. and speaking of dates - barboncino is a great spot for a casual one, especially if you don't like the person you're dating. i keed. i keed. i'm joking, however i had to make it a point to mention the married couple sitting behind us who barely looked at each other, let alone speak. maybe it was just a really long day, however i'm glad they at least had the opportunity to enjoy a tasty meal (even if it was in silence).",4.0

"bangin'. i can see it from my house. can they see me too? worth the wait and the pesos. the arugula pizza sounds scary, like a salad on a pizza, but it is damned delicious. great service, and they really did a great job building it out.",5.0
Was leaving Dutch Boy with some friends and saw this spot opened across the street.  Very nice ambiance so we wanted to peek in and see what was going on and I am sooo happy we did! Awesome drinks and food! Definitely adds a bit of casual class to the neighborhood.  I do feel it should have a better Happy Hour special. and the pizza is a little bit on the expensive side. My bill kind of surprised me (and not in a good way!) ! But I am still happy its nearby and now I don't have to travel far for a great glass of wine and some munchies.  I will definitely be recommending this spot and taking friends in to check it out! Great Job!,5.0

"We came here for lunch.  A little disappointed that the menu is limited in the daytime, so there are no appetizers - just pizzas and salads.  We ordered an arugula salad and an artichoke and pancetta pizza.  They were decent, but not overly memorable.  Interesting thing is that they actually serve a whole section of artichoke vs. just the artichoke hearts on each slice, so they probably use fresher ingredients.  Side note: Parking around here is pretty tough.",3.0
"Great addition to the neighborhood. The pizza is ok. The crust is ok and I found the sauce underseasoned and too acidic though all the toppings were fresh.  Honestly for the value and taste I rather would trek to Graziella's. However, Barboncino has a lovely drink menu and decor so for that alone I will be back.",3.0
"My girlfriend and I visited on our first night in NYC, thinking this would be an excellent chance to visit a nice NY pizza restaurant.  The place looks great, and the pizzas look good, but that's about where it ends.  The flavors just weren't there.  For the price, I'd go elsewhere.",2.0
"Giving this place a solid four stars for an overall pleasurable experience and delicious pizza.  Came here last week on a date and was pleasantly surprised.  The place is unassuming from the outside in the middle of Prospect (Crown) Heights but once you step inside it has this cool, dim, rustic kind of feel.  Since it was a Friday it was pretty crowded but the host assured us he would try to get us seated asap which he did less than 15 minutes later.  Point number 1.  The waitress was polite and attentive and we ordered a plain pizza and a meatball pizza since they were pretty small and thin crust.  Absolute party in my mouth! Point number 2.  Each slice had the right amount of cheese, the right amount of sauce and the right amount of deliciousness!  I love me some pizza and most 'pizza bar' type places are just ""ok"" when it comes to the actual food and are usually overpriced.  Barboncino's is not - definitely lived up to my expectations and the prices were right.  I didn't get to sample the drink menu as all I had was a glass of wine but I definitely intend to come back to sample it!  This is definitely a great place to come on a date as its not super loud but definitely a cool place to hang if you want a low key, chill restaurant to dine with your friends.  Awesome place!",4.0
I will be back. Need to try more things before I write a review just based on a couple of their pizzas. The meatball was very good. The beer was outstanding. Hoping to try the artichoke pizza next time.,4.0
"Wow, the food was amazingly delicious!  We started with bibb salads and it was fresh, tasty and delicious. The toasted walnuts on top were done just perfectly and a nice touch.  The pizza was out of this world delicious.  We had the arugula pizza with proscuitto and cherry tomatoes.  The tomatoes were so fresh tasting and the proscuitto was crisped just perfectly and the taste of the pizza was to die for. The artichoke and pancetta pizza was awesome.   The cremini mushroom pizza with fennel sausage was delicious. The cheese they use for the pizza was incredibly good and all the ingredients in everything we ate was top quality.  There was a good selection of beers on the menu and again very good. The service was perfect. We had a friendly waiter who knew the menu and we were not rushed.  I would highly recommend this restaurant, you have got to try it and I guarantee you'll be hooked. We can't wait to go back.",5.0

checked this place out tonight.  i live on the same block and have been waiting for ages for it to open.  considering it just opened last night i was blown away.  it was delicious and the service was great.  i was persuaded to have the clam pizza which was a game changer for me (i never would have thought clams would go with pizza.). it is served with a slice of lemon for you to squeeze on top which gives a nice bright flavor to the already  creamy and tangy combo that the pizza has.  they are still waiting on their liquor license but i would not let that stop you.  in fact its probably better to try it out now because once they get their license it will be PACKED.,4.0
"the pizza is delicious and crust is perfect, so are the cocktails and meatballs. i've had  just about everything on the menu except the cheese plate.  i feel the salads, though bright and fresh, are overpriced and not interesting, so i would pass on that unless you just have to have your greens.  the gelato, although wonderful a year ago, seems to have changed recipes or origins and not my favorite either.  the wine list, IMHO, could be rethought.  but this is a pizza place and you get what's promised.  all the pizzas please, but as always, margherita is my standby.  there's somewhat of a meandering seating arrangement, so you kind of have a choice of sub-ambiences: more secluded booths at the front, seats at the bar, cafe style seating, private large group table downstairs and outdoors in the back yard.  Family and kids alert if you're there for an early dinner.  Service has been good to very good on all of my many visits.  it's a casual place, but In the theater of service, i have overheard some rude exchanges from patron to server on occasion and I must say consummate professionalism has always been maintained.",4.0
"AHHHHHHHH PIZZAAAA?????????? Totally! You can't get it here, but if you ask for some PIZZA you'll sure to be delighted! I drink here all the time I eat here all the time, what more could you ask for? I'm satsified by the service especially! WONDERFUL great vibe",5.0
"I was in a pretty bad mood when I got to Barboncino after a long demanding day at work. I must say that I left the restaurant as a new person, happy and satisfied. The stuff were all incredible - friendly, attentive and caring. The design of the space is beautiful and I felt very comfortable, everything was just the way I wished it to be and more! As for the food I had low expectations since I'm not really a pizza person, but I must say that I'm transformed now! The pizza was the best I've ever had, the crust was perfect and the variety of unique toppings allowed everyone to find their favorite, we were a large group so I was able to taste several different pizzas and they all were creative and delicious! I was impressed by the variety of starters they offered, the roasted peppers were my favorite, I added the cheese and couldn't get enough of it! The cocktails were awesome too! Overall a wonderful delighting experience, as you see I give Barboncino five stars, I'm so happy to have found my new favorite restaurant!!!",5.0

Very nice atmosphere. Great renovation job. Service us good. The pizza crust was a bit soft but tasty.  Needs to cook longer. Goat cheese was sparse in the goat cheese salad  They don't serve any bread! But you have the option to buy it for $4 !!!,3.0

"Barboncino was on my radar even before it opened, since I live down the street, and when we finally went for dinner a couple of months ago, it did not disappoint! I don't think this is the best pizza in the universe (and would give the food four stars overall) but the atmosphere and service make this place absolutely fantastic. It's great spot for sitting at the bar by yourself, for a romantic dinner for two or for a group of friends/family. Their menu is very small, but offers a great selection of Italian fare and excellent wines. I will stay away from recommending specific dishes, since that's highly dependent on individual tastes, but if you like fresh salads, meatballs (hint!) and pizza for a reasonable price, this place is a must. I think Barboncino has already become a neighborhood staple, and for a good reason. One word of warning though: it gets pretty crowded, especially Fri & Sat nights, so come early!",5.0
