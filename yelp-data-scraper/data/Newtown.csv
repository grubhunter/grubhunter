"Newtown is pure magic. It's a hidden gem in Bushwick. It's perfect for vegetarians because everything on the menu does not contain meat. It is a modern twist on great middle eastern food. The service here is friendly, but however, it is tiny and there is not that many places to sit. The menu has great selection. They have hummus platters, falafel, great sandwiches, and an amazing homemade chai tea.In my opinion, the best things to order here are the Haloumi Sandwich and the Falafel Sandwich. Seriously so good. Everything here tastes beyond fresh and perfect. I highly recommend giving this place a try and if you are not in the area, it is worth a trek out to Bushwick for. It's a great unique space.Friendly service, great food, and very fresh. Limited seating and strange bathroom down a hallway in the back. CASH ONLY TOO!!!!",5.0
"So far I have had the halloumi sandwich the two times I have been here. It's a small cozy place perfect for Brunch, Supper or even early dinner. The food is good and so is the coffee. Check it out if you are in the area.",4.0
The falafel sandwich was straight up the best sandwich I have ever eaten. Fantastic food at great prices. The only possible fault I can find with this place is that it's pretty small.,5.0
"The halloumi sandwich is unbelievably good, I love the seitan one too. Great for BYOB too. Always make a point to come here if I'm anywhere close.",5.0
"I really enjoy this little place, I probably eat here once a week before practice. Usually I'll order the halloumi sandwich, and it is really REALLY great! Their hummus is yummy and I've had a few of their seasonal soups, and they have always been tasty.I tried their seitan sandwich the other day, I'm not a huge seitan fan, so I suppose that's why I wasn't wild about it. I've been sitting here working a few times, and I like the atmosphere. To be honest, I don't know if they have wifi.Iced coffee is real good, had a hint of cardemon last time I had it. It's my favorite.",4.0
"Small place, but such good food! The halloumi sandwich was amazing and the hummus was really great too. Food came out fast and you could tell it was hella fresh. Definitely coming back here!",5.0
I'm trying to find an excuse to eat here every day. I don't think you can go wrong with anything on the menu. Great for a quick bite or a nice date.,5.0
"SO INCREDIBLE!First of all, the people here are so sweet. They always have a place for us when we go, and they're really awesome. The coffee. So great. I believe it's a common company in New York (can't remember the name), but it's better than that $5 you're spending at Starbucks. For appetizers, we've had both the hummus plate and labne with za'atar. The bread they give you comes incredibly nice and warm, fluffy, all that good stuff. I can't say much more about hummus, given that it's delicious, you should eat it all.The halloumi sandwich. This is a MUST have on your first visit. If you've never had halloumi before, it's a type of cheese (non-melting) from the Cyprus region I believe. The combination with eggplant, roma tomatoes, on a (again) fluffy rosemary cibatta bread ... it's a taste that will linger in your mouth for days.",5.0
Love the Seitan sandwich and all of the hummus flavors. The place is small but the food is awesome.,5.0
"Took myself out on a lunch date on a Saturday afternoon here and my meal was enjoyable. I was craving some falafel so I decided to go with the hummus bowl with falafel. The hummus and hot pepper sauce was a bit salty but nonetheless very tasty with the warm pita and mixed veggies. I also like my falafel very crispy and theirs is on the softer side. So if you like grainer softer falafel then this is your place. Prices were awesome for a good vegan/vegetarian meal. Check it out! I surely will once again when I'm in the mood for some Middle Eastern.Lastly, this is a CASH ONLY establishment so come prepared, otherwise there is an ATM directly outside but the fee is $2.25 :-/",3.0

"My friends and I went here recently and we each got the falafel sandwiches/platter and coffee. It was all very delicious. The coffee was really good too, I was surprised because usually places that aren't coffee shops don't serve good tasting coffee. The place is tiny, but I didn't mind it at all (I like that I almost tripped over a chair when I first walked in, it added to its charm - or mine? jk). Our server was mild-mannered and responsive to our table's needs which made me feel so much more comfortable than I do at places where the staff is overly friendly and contrived. One thing I should note is that it's **ca$h only** (but super inexpensive). If you don't eat meat or dairy try this place at least once, you'll be glad you did. ...Kinda mad there's nothing like this in Baltimore. Next time I'm in the Brooklyn/NY area I'm definitely going back.",5.0
"This cute tiny gem serving amazing Israeli food in the heart of Bushwick is a new love of all vegetarians in the neighborhood (and beyond). I took an hour-long journey to try it for myself and didn't regret it a bit! On weekends, the place offers delicious specials, which I found to be REALLY special.

I don't know why this place has only 4 stars. It's great. I come here all the time. The foods delicious. I usually get the machaba hummus and the seightan sandwich. I haven't had a bad experience yet. I like small business' and don't mind supporting them. Good job guys!,5.0

You should just leave this miserable place to me and I will suffer through eating here repeatedly as though I was being punished for eternity.

"This place was super yummy! I usually don't go for vegan or vegetarian, I tend to think I wont be satisfied without the meaty protein but this place proved me wrong. The labne had a perfect, creamy texture and was very flavorful. The pita that came with was fluffy and gorgeous. I had the falafel sandwich which was excellent and enough for a lunch option. My boyfriend had the seytan sandwich and the combination of the sweet, spicy vegan sausage and the cabbage salad really worked. Plus, it is not pricey at all! A great spot in Bushwick, really recommended.",4.0
So cozy. Amazing spicy lentil soup. The tabouleh is exceptional as well. Sat here reading after my meal and drinking peppermint tea on a cloudy November day.

It deserves better, it really does. That being said, it's truly adorable.

"I've walked through this part of Bushwick before... behind the school that sits at the corner of Grand and Bushwick, between warehouses, and feral cats.In fact just a couple of weeks ago I went with a friend to an after hours loft party at waterbury & Meserole, a nameless faceless loft, that without proper coordinates and detailed directions, you would never find at all.  Newtown sits quietly on Waterbury, and it's discretion is one of it's virtues.  But silent as it is, I must put down to pen what delicious foods I was introduced to.  The menu is quite small, with a handful of middle eastern dishes.  I chose to go for the arugula salad, as I thought I wasn't very hungry.  Arugula, sundried cherries, cucumbers, shiitake mushrooms that flavored things hauntingly close to bacon, and a nice vinaigrette dressing.  It's topped off with a couple of pieces of focaccia bread, drizzled with olive oil.  Nice.  Yes this salad was supreme, but what beat it out by a hair was the potato leak soup, which frankly would humble my mom's great cooking.  The soup was incredible.  For vegetarians, this place is a real oasis.  Top notch cooking, and a very friendly tiny cafe vibe.  After enjoying dinner, stop by the Anchored Inn next door for a beer or three!",5.0
"This review is based on the halloumi sandwich, WOW it is delicious! how come no one told me vegetarian food can taste this good. I will be back here to try other stuff on the menu, and i will certainly be back for the Halloumi!!",5.0
"This crew does Mediterranean food right!My girlfriend and I have been eating here since it was Yummus Hummus and we have never left disappointed. Newtown either bakes their own bread or sources from somewhere locally because the focaccia and pita are always killer. Pair that with fresh vegetables, homemade sauces/aiolies and you have a sandwich menu that even your favorite bodega will never compete with. The haloumi sandwich is to die for and the seitan sandwich is perfect. Even the side of greens are dressed well and not immediate garbage like a lot of sandwich shops.The hummus and sides are on the same level! Lots of care and fresh ingredients go into everything that Newtown makes.Downsides: Cash only and they close at 7. There are no good excuses to be cash only in 2013 where even an iPhone/iPad can take your credit card. Closing at 7 means I'm generally only able to visit Newtown on the weekend but this would be a great dinner spot if they could keep it open until 9 or 10!",4.0
"Friendly service, excellent food, great location.Get the halloumi sandwich.",5.0
"I've only been to Newtown twice, but both times the food was great. It isn't as cheap as some of the other Middle Eastern places in the area, but you really get what you pay for. The Halloumi sandwich and the hummus plate with eggplant were both amazing. It's a very small place with not too much seating. The decor is nice and cozy, just what you'd expect in this area. It's right next to a great bar. The people running this place have done a really good job, both with the food and the design of the space. This is the kind of place you take friends or family who are visiting. It really encapsulates the spirit of the neighborhood. Cheers, Newtown. Unfortunately, it looks like they've CLOSED, so this might be a eulogy review. I went on 6/24, and the windows were covered. The phone # is some random dude who does not want to make you a Halloumi sandwich. It's a real shame, it was probably my favorite spot (yeah, I don't eat out very often), and there's almost no food options close to 3rd Ward now. I'm sure that'll change in a year or two, though. Who knows, maybe they'll come back with a new name again.",5.0
"I currently work at 3rd Ward and Newtown is the closest and definitely most delicious place to eat. My only complaint is that they run out of things real fast. I don't think I've ever been able to get the Newtown salad with the shitake bacon they mention on the menu. The seitan and the soup seem to go quickly as well.That being said, everything I have had there is great. The falalfel sandwich is perfect, the soup is always real comforting (and vegan) and I could easily go into a carb coma by stuffing my face with their rosemary black salt foccacia. You get a lot of food for your money with the hummus plates and everything always tastes very fresh.The coffee isn't amazing but I can't complain when it's a dollar. Service is friendly but sometimes a bit slow. And keep in mind if you want to eat inside during the winter it is FREEZING.",4.0
"This place is DELICIOUS and the only reason I'm docking a star is because the bathroom experience is always disgusting. Please fix it up, guys. I know it's tough with that single stall but really, things like toilet paper and soap should really be readily available. Also, please clean out the trash in there. And did you fix the lock yet? The halloumi sandwich is without any exaggeration the best sandwich I've ever eaten in my life and I've brought a couple of people here who agree. The humus is great, the falafel is great, the service is always really nice. It can be fast or slow depending who is working and how busy they are so it's not reliable in that sense and I would probably avoid this place if I were in a rush. But the people working there are always really sweet.",4.0

"I've walked through this part of Bushwick before... behind the school that sits at the corner of Grand and Bushwick, between warehouses, and feral cats.In fact just a couple of weeks ago I went with a friend to an after hours loft party at waterbury & Meserole, a nameless faceless loft, that without proper coordinates and detailed directions, you would never find at all.  Newtown sits quietly on Waterbury, and it's discretion is one of it's virtues.  But silent as it is, I must put down to pen what delicious foods I was introduced to.  The menu is quite small, with a handful of middle eastern dishes.  I chose to go for the arugula salad, as I thought I wasn't very hungry.  Arugula, sundried cherries, cucumbers, shiitake mushrooms that flavored things hauntingly close to bacon, and a nice vinaigrette dressing.  It's topped off with a couple of pieces of focaccia bread, drizzled with olive oil.  Nice.  Yes this salad was supreme, but what beat it out by a hair was the potato leak soup, which frankly would humble my mom's great cooking.  The soup was incredible.  For vegetarians, this place is a real oasis.  Top notch cooking, and a very friendly tiny cafe vibe.  After enjoying dinner, stop by the Anchored Inn next door for a beer or three!",5.0
"This review is based on the halloumi sandwich, WOW it is delicious! how come no one told me vegetarian food can taste this good. I will be back here to try other stuff on the menu, and i will certainly be back for the Halloumi!!",5.0
"This crew does Mediterranean food right!My girlfriend and I have been eating here since it was Yummus Hummus and we have never left disappointed. Newtown either bakes their own bread or sources from somewhere locally because the focaccia and pita are always killer. Pair that with fresh vegetables, homemade sauces/aiolies and you have a sandwich menu that even your favorite bodega will never compete with. The haloumi sandwich is to die for and the seitan sandwich is perfect. Even the side of greens are dressed well and not immediate garbage like a lot of sandwich shops.The hummus and sides are on the same level! Lots of care and fresh ingredients go into everything that Newtown makes.Downsides: Cash only and they close at 7. There are no good excuses to be cash only in 2013 where even an iPhone/iPad can take your credit card. Closing at 7 means I'm generally only able to visit Newtown on the weekend but this would be a great dinner spot if they could keep it open until 9 or 10!",4.0
"Friendly service, excellent food, great location.Get the halloumi sandwich.",5.0
"I've only been to Newtown twice, but both times the food was great. It isn't as cheap as some of the other Middle Eastern places in the area, but you really get what you pay for. The Halloumi sandwich and the hummus plate with eggplant were both amazing. It's a very small place with not too much seating. The decor is nice and cozy, just what you'd expect in this area. It's right next to a great bar. The people running this place have done a really good job, both with the food and the design of the space. This is the kind of place you take friends or family who are visiting. It really encapsulates the spirit of the neighborhood. Cheers, Newtown. Unfortunately, it looks like they've CLOSED, so this might be a eulogy review. I went on 6/24, and the windows were covered. The phone # is some random dude who does not want to make you a Halloumi sandwich. It's a real shame, it was probably my favorite spot (yeah, I don't eat out very often), and there's almost no food options close to 3rd Ward now. I'm sure that'll change in a year or two, though. Who knows, maybe they'll come back with a new name again.",5.0
"I currently work at 3rd Ward and Newtown is the closest and definitely most delicious place to eat. My only complaint is that they run out of things real fast. I don't think I've ever been able to get the Newtown salad with the shitake bacon they mention on the menu. The seitan and the soup seem to go quickly as well.That being said, everything I have had there is great. The falalfel sandwich is perfect, the soup is always real comforting (and vegan) and I could easily go into a carb coma by stuffing my face with their rosemary black salt foccacia. You get a lot of food for your money with the hummus plates and everything always tastes very fresh.The coffee isn't amazing but I can't complain when it's a dollar. Service is friendly but sometimes a bit slow. And keep in mind if you want to eat inside during the winter it is FREEZING.",4.0
"This place is DELICIOUS and the only reason I'm docking a star is because the bathroom experience is always disgusting. Please fix it up, guys. I know it's tough with that single stall but really, things like toilet paper and soap should really be readily available. Also, please clean out the trash in there. And did you fix the lock yet? The halloumi sandwich is without any exaggeration the best sandwich I've ever eaten in my life and I've brought a couple of people here who agree. The humus is great, the falafel is great, the service is always really nice. It can be fast or slow depending who is working and how busy they are so it's not reliable in that sense and I would probably avoid this place if I were in a rush. But the people working there are always really sweet.",4.0
Had a superb dinner there.  So much food for so little money. The lentil carrot cilantro soup they were serving was the best soup I've ever tasted.Thank god it's in a hidden industrial location far from a subway station so it will scare the crap out of people from Manhattan thinking of going.,5.0

"About three days after moving to Brooklyn all the way from California, I had the biggest -- I mean, BIGGEST -- hankering for some falafel. Naturally, I pulled up my trusty Yelp app, found the nearest Middle Eastern, vegetarian-friendly joint I could locate, and thought I'd test it out.The location is pretty unique, lodged between a lot of industrial buildings with maybe like, one square foot of unbroken sidewalk cement on the way there. What I really liked was the outdoor seating option, and the earthy vibe from it. Our table was made from a tree stump, and the seats were made from smaller tree stumps. Across the street, a graffiti artist was adding on to the wall mural, which provided some entertainment while we waited for our food to arrive.The staff was extremely friendly and accommodating. The falafel pita sandwich was out of this world crazy-good. I mean, I'm not picky when it comes to falafel. If it looks like a falafel and tastes like a falafel and is actually a falafel, I'll probably like it. But this... was so good. And the portions were pretty big for the price; I only finished half and took the rest home for dinner later on (added plus, it was in a reusable plastic container which is now holding some gouda in the fridge! Score!) Their homemade foccacia bread might have been my favorite, though. So crispy on the outside, so soft on the inside... so rosemary-y. Yum. The hummus was pretty oily, but if you just sort of push the oil to the side and eat the hummus itself, it's tasty as well.I'd love to go back and try some of their other options, though there are very few to choose from. But when you're a vegetarian and you go to a restaurant that has more than one vegetarian item on the menu, it's always sort of like a covert ""cha-ching!"" feeling. I'll definitely be back!",5.0

"I know a guy who  limits himself to one egg sandwich per month. Just the one. He raved to me about the egg sandwich at Newtown, a real treat for ""just five dollars!"" And I was a little hesitant at first, because five bucks is a lot for an egg sandwich in a neighborhood where there are like seven bodegas within spitting distance. But once I decided to trust him and try out this sandwich... oh, wow. He was right; for the quality, it's a bargain, dude. Delicious focaccia bread, really tasty eggs, tomato, cheese, arugula -- I didn't have a hankering for a standard bodega egg sandwich for three weeks.The hummus is also excellent, tangy and nutty, and the hummus plates are surprisingly hearty and filling. I've gone in thinking I was spending a lot of money for simple ingredients like hummus, pita and eggplant, and come out feeling like I'd gotten a bargain for eating a meal like that for less than $10.Tiny, relaxed dining room. Couple tables outside, too. Feels like eating a meal at your friend's loft or something, cozy and homey. I can definitely see how, if you live in the neighborhood and happen to take someone home one night, this would be a great place to bring them in the morning or early afternoon of the next day, if that's a thing that will ever happen to me again.",4.0

Eggplant never tasted so good and ol boy wanted to go back for brunch today. He got the hummus with falafel, and perhaps wished there were more falafel, though I think the menu claims it as principally hummus so we won't ding them for it. Anyway, hummus was good as Yummus Hummus and I can't wait to try the other sandwiches!P.S. I think it's BYOB like Yummus Hummus was, there were ppl with tallboys when we arrived. Unfortunately the nearest bodega is not actually near, so keep that in mind on the way!P.P.S. I left my wallet and it was waiting for me behind the register when I came back, completely intact!

"I'm not sure if it's fair to rate this place after going in just once, for coffee, but I'm doing it anyway. First off, this place is confusing. I was lured in by the sign that touted ""ORGANIC COFFEE."" I wasn't looking for falafel, mind, I just wanted a decent cup of coffee to wake me up on a cold, snowy Sunday. Walked in & met the most obnoxious smokey air, kinda greasy. Asked about the coffee... They had... coffee. Stacks of beans lined the shelf. No espresso, no lattes, caps, etc. Just COFFEE. Drip, I'm sure. Well, when you put it on your sign outside, I really expect it to be above average, because the sign means that you're boasting that you have it, so I expect you to have it together. Maybe they would fresh grind? Make it in a press? Maybe they would prepare a fresh cup? Something? I got a large cup of what tasted like cheap tasting, stagnant gas station coffee that you're forced into accepting whilst on a road trip. Gross. It's really not hard to get coffee up to standards, so it kinda pissed me off. Keep it off of your sign unless you're going to churn it out properly.
