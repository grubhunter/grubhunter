"Mekelburg's is quickly becoming the worst kept secret in Brooklyn.  Mostly because of my big mouth.  Coming here is so cozy!  You walk through a beautiful gourmet grocery store that's filled with stuff that you'd buy when you're trying to make a meal to impress someone you'd really like.  Or if you just had a crushing defeat in life and just really need a pint of decadent ice cream. Or if you're really drunk and see a chocolate bar with a chihuahua dressed as Michael Jackson on it and you didn't know how you'd lived your whole life without this chocolate bar...Anyhow...So you walk through this magical land of deliciousness into the best craft beer bar and gastropub (is it still cool to call places that?)!  With something like 16 beers on tap + a bunch of beers in bottles and cans, a huge wine list, and handful of classic cocktails, it's really hard not to find something you like!  The beers are constantly changing and always super interesting (unless you think Bud/Coors/Stella are interesting...cuz they're not gonna be on the menu).  The bartenders are also there to help you when you're paralyzed by indecision.  They're knowledgable and can help you identify a drink you like and will offer you a taste of anything to let you know that you is kind, you is smart, you is making good beer choices.And now the food.  Please try the food.  It's so delicious.  Daniel and Alicia are amazing chefs that got their start doing underground supper clubs and the food is that perfect mix of exploration and comfort.  You'll be able to tell you're eating a sandwich (or whatever) but you'll suddenly think, ""Man, that's kinda punchy!  Fun!""My personal favorite is the Baked Potato with Smoked Cod.  It's just a plain potato but topped with smoked fish and caviar.  You can just imagine this is what a Russian Tsar with a crazy hat and mustache would totally eat while contemplating beheading his advisors.  The Meatloaf Sandwich will seem innocuous but then you bit into a pocket of yummy ricotta and it's like your tongue is floating away on savory marshmallow cloud.Service here is casual but friendly.  If you're lucky, Daniel and Alicia will come by and chat with you about their adorable kids or their latest adventures or talk to you about the neighborhood's sordid history.  It's always a good time.Oh, and if I haven't convinced you to go yet, as summer slowly (serious emphasis there) draws near, they have a fantastic backyard.See you there!",5.0
"Finally!!! They were right. My friends have been telling about Meks for months and I've been so backed up with work. This past week I finally had the chance to go for breakfast and I do tell you, they do not disappoint. So you may get confused walking in, as the front of the store works as an adorable quaint deli and grocery but let that not deceive you. Walk through the isles and this amazing bar/food area awaits you. Like all other reviewers, I will point out that the beer selection is definitely a selection you will not find elsewhere. Breweries who are new to the game or old ones, you'll find the one that hits your sweet (or sour) spot here. I did love that at 9:45am there were three guys sitting at the bar drinking beer. I have yet to see that elsewhere. The ever so friendly waitress saw us entering and ran over to tell us she'll be a moment as she's serving someone else at the front end. When she came back we already knew what we wanted and ordered. My friend ordered the Mek-Muffin and I the Chocolate Babka French Toast (Exactly as phenomenal as it sounds). The french toast was pure insanity. It was brought to the table hot and smelled so damn good. It was soft, runny chocolate and delicious flavors all around. The Mek muffin was just as amazing in a savory form. Fresh delicious eggs on brioche with creme fraiche, bacon and some more heaveness (that's not a word but still).The prices are quite reasonable too and parking is a breeze which is never likely in Clinton Hill. We really enjoyed our breakfast here and as my friends told me, I must go back for dinner. So I will be back. Very very soon.",5.0
"I absolutely love this place. The owners, Alicia and Brian, opened Mekelburg's last summer, and it's a wonderful addition to the neighborhood. Mekelburg's consists of a small grocery store in the front that has an extensive cheese counter and stocks freshly baked bread, organic produce, and other cool items (e.g., purple corn tea, vegan ice cream, organic meat, Soda Stream). I like that I can buy things at Mekelburg's that I'd normally have to visit Whole Foods Gowanus to find. Now the best part of Mekelburg's is the restaurant in the back. They have a rotating line-up of craft beer, serve the best egg sandwich I've ever eaten, and cook up some innovative baked potatoes that I am excited to try. Go for happy hour with friends, brunch with your family, or date night with your partner. It's great for all occasions!",5.0
"First & Foremost: I'm marrying the Salt Baked Potato. Preferably the one with the slab of bacon.Second: You're lucky there's a picture of the potato.Third: I took your coasters, deal with it.Now that we have that out of the way...Mekelburg's is like a mullet, business in the front & a party in the back.When you first walk in, you will see a grocery store & towards the back, the bar/dining area.Come here with a good friend to catch up on life & you'll never want to leave.Seriously, you will lose track of time.I didn't get a chance to taste the legendary Mek Muffin, but everything else I did get to try was absolutely delicious.My favorites being the N'Orleans BBQ Shrimp Po Boy & the Salt Baked Potato (clearly).I still dream about this potato at night.One of these days I'll wake up in time for brunch.I'm pretty sure I need one of these Mek Muffins in my life!They have a wide variety of beer.Since I know absolutely nothing about beer, I can't really comment too much about it.The cider the bartender recommended was good!I shall return because I have to eat everything on the menu & run these people from Ohio out of our town!",5.0
"What an awesome addition to Clinton Hill! Mekelburg's is just a few blocks from my apartment, so my boyfriend and I came here for brunch a few weeks ago. The dining space is small, and there were a few people waiting for a seat, but luckily you can browse the shop while you wait. We ordered coffees, mimosas, and two mek-muffins. The coffee was a bit watery, but the mimosas were good. The mek-muffins were large and yummy! They come with malaysian sriracha, which added that extra flavor to the sandwich. We also ordered the roast beef sandwich to go, because I had read tons of great things about this sandwich. Luckily, we had gotten there right before noon, and they started making the lunch sandwiches soon after. We ate it after a walk down Dekalb and a walk through the Fort Greene farmer's market. I'm happy to say that it was as delicious as I had hoped. My boyfriend loved it too. The dining space is kind of minimalist and industrial. There are bright lights and a low ceiling. They have a large patio that I'm excited to try out when it gets warmer. They also have a bar with tons of beer and cider on tap. They have varied sizes so that you can try different kinds! The shop area has those typical fancier goods that you'd expect to find from a shop like this, including cookies, tea, frozen pizza, ice cream, crackers, etc. They have lots of local items, along with meat and cheese. They also have a laundry soap refill dispenser where you bring your container and refill your soap. They also have a meat club and a cheese club--info is on their website.Our brunch experience, as well as the customer service in the shop, were both very enjoyable! It's just the type of neighborhood foodie spot I love.",5.0
"Stopped in for an early brunch and was greeted by a smiling, courteous bartender. We sat at the bar, ordered a couple mimosas and chatted about food options with the bartender. Brunch options: unique considering what typical brunch menus can be. He got eggs, porchetta and broccoli rabe on a brioche roll.I had the whitefish tartine and the smoked salmon tartine.... Don't judge, I LOVE food! Both were incredible! He gave his sandwich five stars. I especially loved the smoked salmon.Check this place out!!",5.0
"Mekelburg's is the reason why I will move to Clinton Hill one day. Mekelburg's might also be the reason why I might start cooking one day. The front part of the establishment is a specialty food store, including a cheesemonger's counter. Since I haven't cooked in over a decade, I have not spent much time in this section. What I have seen so far, though, is likely to tempt me to pick up some groceries from here and create some culinary wonders of my own. The rear section is the bar and restaurant. I have thoroughly enjoyed everything I have ever eaten here, although my favorite would have to be the sambal butter roasted oysters. Each serving consists of four plump, juicy oysters that are packed with flavor. The baked potato with smoked Alaskan cod, creme fraiche, and caviar is quite delicious too, as is Nana's meatloaf sandwich. The sandwich is layered with velvety ricotta cheese, a generous slice of beef meatloaf, and a tomato-based red gravy. The combination of textures and flavors is absolutely delightful. My other favorite is the barbecue shrimp po'boy. The grilled shrimp and the luscious sauce is stuffed inside the baguette, such that when you bite into the sandwich, the filling gushes forth and fills your mouth with stupefying scrumptiousness. OK, I'm being a little too dramatic here, but try it for yourself. The po'boy really does exceed expectations. For one, the shrimp is grilled rather than deep fried. Also, the sauce it is drenched in is bursting with a bold piquancy. It is easily one of the best sandwiches I have ever tasted. If the food alone weren't enough of a reason for me to frequent Mekelburg's, add to it that Daniel and Alicia, the owners, are two of the nicest people in our city. A meal at Mekelburg's has evolved into more than just a meal; it is quality time spent with some very special friends.",5.0
"This place is one-stop shopping if you want to get drunk on delicious beers you've never heard of, eat amazing and beautiful food, and/or pick up carefully curated cheese, charcuterie, or other gourmet groceries* to cook your own amazing and beautiful food at home. Since those are basically my only hobbies, I see Mekelburg's being a regular spot for me.If you really need me to tell you how to live, I would recommend:1. Coming in with gluttons who like to share. If you don't know any of those, I would recommend getting new friends. I'll be your new glutton friend if you'd like, but you're buying until I figure out what it is you bring to the table. 2. Drinking all the beer. Chances are you'll discover something you never knew you liked (Pineapple cider! Sours! Quads! Cask ales!). The 8 oz option, as well as the extremely hospitable staff that are happy to pour you tastes, make this easy.3. The salt baked potatoes. We had both the black cod/caviar and the slab bacon/raclette versions, and it's honestly difficult to imagine such deliciousness until you dive in. In this Age of Instagram, it doesn't hurt that they are absolutely gorgeous as well.4. Sandwiches. The Wagyu Roast Beef and the porchetta/broccoli rabe are the only ones I've had the pleasure of trying so far, but I imagine the quality remains high throughout the list.To be fair, you are paying for the quality...but I'm not sure you can go wrong here._____________*It's nice to see that they also support local spots, sourcing at least baked goods from some favorites (Bien Cuit croissants, everything baguettes from Mazzola, etc.).",5.0
"Heyo! Another cute and fun thing that's popped up in the area. Can never get enough of those! They've got an outdoor patio (which sadly doesn't get any sun - probably best in the summer months) and a small area inside to eat as well, with about 8 bar stools too. Fresh beer on tap. This is not really a place I'd come to eat often, as there are not a lot of vegetarian options, but holy crap, the ones that ARE on the menu are fantastic (buratta + acorn squash and the veggie sandwich, which also comes with buratta on it). Whatever spread/garnish they use on the acorn squash is absolutely delicious. All around the store (and even in the bathrooms) the walls are lined with chalk boards that people can write on. My personal favorite was ""what's your patronus?"" with a turtle drawn next to it. Hah!The specialty store in front has a great selection of fine goods at a reasonable price. I wish I lived in the area, as I'm sure this would be my primary reason for stopping by!",4.0
"Holy crap this place is amazing! This place is the definition of a hidden gem. Its tucked back behind a store so I dont think a lot of people know about it, but it was always full! The owner (manager?) Daniel is so nice and talked with us during our stay- as well as a few of the guys who worked there- talked to us and made suggestions (since we are not from NY) told us cool places to check out. it really is a nice cozy fun place! highly suggest their L'Amuse And Cracklin' as well as their Porchetta sandwhich (split it) those are so amazing I had one everyday while I was in NY!",5.0
"KenScale: 9.0/10I always find a joy in discovering unassuming restaurants in the city that not many people have been talking about but deliver outstanding food. I try to make as many trips to Brooklyn (also planning on making more trips to Queens) to discover these places that are outside the radar of Manhattanites. This time the restaurant that I visited happens to be inside a grocery in the Flatbush area; the whole setting looks like it could be a great find as long as the food is great. Well, Mekelburg's definitely delivered and I already have two dishes that would likely be strong candidates for my annual dishes of the year. Mekelburg's menu consists of simple small plates, sandwiches, baked potatoes and cheese and meat plates. The awesome balance of flavor and texture, however, totally belies this simplicity. Burrata with roasted acorn squash had the wonderful combination of salty burrata and sweet squash, and the texture of silky smooth burrata was something that I would remember for a long time. Wagyu roast beef sandwich was also quite nice, with fresh and tender roast beef that was very pleasant inside my mouth. It was, however, overshadowed by the sensational porchetta sandwich with broccoli rabe. I'm not even a huge fan of porchetta sandwich as I usually find it too stuffy, but the one at Mekelburg's just had perfect texture of the meat with the ideal balance of flavor; you would never get tired bite after bite, and I just absolutely loved how a simple sandwich could make a wonderful meal. Salt baked potato was another dish that totally delivered. I tried the one with smoke black cod, crème fraiche and caviar and just couldn't stop digging the dish, which had soft potato working magic with decadent combination of crème fraiche and caviar. My dining companion, who's not even a fan of potato in general, couldn't rave about this dish, either. It's such a pleasure to see how much impact a simple baked potato can make.The restaurant doesn't take reservations and given the tiny size of the space, I suggest arriving early to secure your seat at one of the tiny tables. The dining space got quickly crowded by the time the food started coming out. Mekelburg's has some interesting beer selections that you could also try to complement your meal. Get a pint of IPA and enjoy with the wonderful food coming out of the kitchen. This is a gem that any serious diner in NYC should know about; on the other hand, I prefer that it stays under the radar so I can always visit next time I'm in Brooklyn. Porchetta sandwich and salt baked potato were just too sensational!",5.0
"I really like the concept behind this place: a gourmet grocery store at the front, a bar that specializes in craft beers, and a compact menu serving really delicious food. Add a nice, quiet backyard to the mix, and you have a winner.First things first: the beer selection is fantastic, one of the best in Brooklyn. The very well curated craft beer list offers 16 rotating taps in 8 oz, 16 oz, and growler size. Every time I come here I've seen new breweries featured including, among others, Finback, Firestone, Evil Twin, Gigantic Brewing, Knee Deep, Other Half, Gun Hill, and Barrier. Being a sour beer lover, I'm also happy to see that there are always a couple of sours/gose available.it's worth noting that you are allowed to get a growler and drink it on site, which is great if you come here with a group of people.The bottled beer selection is also remarkable, featuring rare brews such as YumYum, an outstanding American pale ale from 3 Floyds Brewing Co.As far as food, don't be fooled by the compact menu: the small kitchen offers some extremely tasty dishes, such as soft shell crab sandwich with lettuce and avocado ($15); roasted mackerel with pesto, coleslaw, and avocado ($13); bone marrow ($11). Or the Sambal butter roasted oysters ($13), alongside the porchetta sandwich with broccoli rabe ($15), which is like an orecchiette pasta dish in a sandwich[1].If I had to pick a favorite, though, perhaps it would be the baked potato. Yes, a baked potato. With creme fraiche, smoked black cod, caviar, dill ($9). What makes this simple dish so good it's the smoked black cod: so incredibly flavorful, it goes perfectly well with caviar, transforming this simple dish in a decadent treat.The menu changes constantly, as Daniel and Alicia like to experiment with new dishes. In fact, you should talk to them if you see them around: they always make for a great conversation, and you may even get to try some new dishes that are not on the menu.There's also a selection of meat and cheeses available in 3 sizes (3mers, 5mers, and 7mers). You should definitely try the duck belly prosciutto, alongside several lamb charcuiterie offerings.This is a great place to meet up with friends after work, to catch up with somebody you haven't seen in a while, or to just relax at the bar while enjoying a tasty brew and a dish.--------------------[1] And I love orecchiette with broccoli rabe.",5.0
"I guess I'll review this place for my 300th review...why not???This review is for the dining section only.   They also have a market area in the front but I didn't get a chance to fully browse through the joint.I've been hearing really good things about this place from fellow Yelpers.  I've had this place bookmarked for a while.   Another Yelper friend also wanted to try this place and we finally set a date to dine here.We were a group of 3.  We decided that we can order the food and share it since there were so many great options on the menu.  We started with a charcuterie plate of cured meats and cheeses.  I'm guessing it was salami and prosciutto....I think...I forgot what the name of the two cheeses were but it was delicious.  The plate was garnished with cornichons, roasted almonds and some jam.   Everything paired well with each other.   Although, I wished it came with more bread.....I love bread.  The next item was the pâté.  It was a simple yet tasty item, served with toasted baguette slices, a dallop of Dijon mustard on the side and more cornichons.   We also ordered the black cod and caviar baked potato, sambal roasted oysters, the N'Orleans BBQ Po'Boy sandwich, the porchetta sandwich (porchetta, broccoli rabe and parmigiana) and the Italian sandwich (mortadella, soppressata, hot coppa, speck, mozzarella, lettuce, pickled peppers and onions).  When asked which was my favorite dish, I couldn't give an exact answer.  They were all frickin good.  I guess I'll say the baked potato.  I heard the menu changes but I'm not sure how often...I'm not sure if it changes with the season. I also wanted to try the Mek-Muffin, but I didn't realize it was a brunch item.  Time to schedule a brunch date!!!",5.0
"Great little store/bar/gastropub on a quiet street.   One of my Yelp friends recommended I check out the place (thanks Matteo!) and thought it might be a good venue for my beer club.  After stopping by one Saturday afternoon and enjoying myself, I set up a beer club meetup and it was a smashing success.The back area with the tables and the bar is nice and comfortable.  Even on a warm night the garden was pleasant.  The selection of beers was great.  Everyone was telling me they were able to try beers they'd never had before and I found a couple of new favorites (both sours).  The food was great too.  I had the roast beef and every part of the sandwich was fresh and delicious.  I probably could have just eaten the bread it was served on!   The pork sandwich was also popular.  Soft shell crab sandwich received mixed reviews....of my three friends who ate that, two thought it was ""meh"" but one really liked it.Some of the taps poured slowly and with a lot of foam so that was a bit of a drag when there were almost 40 thirsty beer drinkers but the friendly team running the place did a great job taking care of everyone.The most common comment I heard from my crew was ""I wish we had a place like this in my neighborhood!"".  Sounds like a franchise opportunity waiting to happen!  I'll be back for sure.",4.0
"Name something you like and Mekelburg's is bound to have it. Craft beers? Check. Charcuterie meats and cheeses? Piles of them. Gourmet groceries? In spades. Delicious sandwiches? You betcha.I first learned about Mekelburg's from a post on reddit's /r/Brooklyn. I spoke to the owner Daniel about it, and he said that after a long opening week, he decided to post a bunch of the photos he had on his phone on a whim, and it sure worked because it got my butt in the door!Don't let the basement entrance of Mekelburg's fool you. Step inside and you'll find an oasis in the food desert. The first thing you'll see is fresh bread from Mazzola bakery, followed by a pretty substantial meat and cheese section (I couldn't leave without picking up some speck and Mahon from Spain). The dude working the counter was awesome and really knew his cheeses.Past that, you'll find all sorts of other goodies - a whole rack full of hot sauces you've never heard of, artisinal pickles, ready-to-bake Roberta's pizzas, lots of nuts and spices, and way more. They also have cold brew from Toby's available, which they offer with fancy farm milk. Might have been the best cold brew I've had in a long time!Walk to the back and you're greeted by the super cool bartender Mike, and behind him, a triple wide chalkboard with the food menu of the day, a dozen and a half craft beers on tap (some available to go in growlers!), and other available drinks. If they have the Grimm Lambo Door, definitely get a pint of that!The back room has an arched ceiling which makes it seem way more spacious than a basement has any right to be. There's also ample bar and table seating (you order food at the bar).Speaking of food, what they have here is nothing short of amazing.I had the porchetta sandwich, which was insanely crispy and juicy. There was also broccoli rabe in it, which added a nice contrasting texture and flavor.Also ordered the smoked salmon and cream cheese tartine. At some point, a tartine is big enough to be an open-faced sandwich, and this one definitely pushed the envelope. The pickled onions on top were a really nice touch.Last but not least, there was the fanciest baked potato I've ever had. It. Had. Caviar. On. It. Along with creme fraiche, and smoked cod that Daniel said was shipped from Alaska by a family member. So yeah, it was delicious. I didn't know a baked potato could be gourmet food, but hey, you learn something new every day.They also have a pretty large backyard. It has several picnic tables and is definitely a great place to spend a summer day with a cold craft beer.If I had to nitpick about something, it was that they didn't have bone marrow available the day I went. But that's just another reason to return!I wish Daniel and his wife Alicia all the best in their newest venture. He's such a nice guy who seems genuinely appreciative of his customers. We also had the pleasure of also meeting his 6-month-old son Jax, who Daniel jokes is the real owner of the shop.Hope to see you all again soon!",5.0
"4 1/2 strong,The hype is legitimate, and these sandwiches are excellent and several nothingness than  mind blowing. The set-up, easy to miss signage and location on one of the quieter blocks in one of the most picturesque districts in the borough,  down a flight of stairs from the street  with the fancy food and provisions shop in front, homey and cozy bar and cafe in the rear is about a new-Brooklyn as possible (with the sky high prices in the retail section to match!).  Such unabashed and excessive twee-ness would normally be cause for an instant strike against an establishment in my book, but again this spot backs it up with the goods in spades.        Much praise (including a selection as one of the NY Times Dining best dishes of 2015) has been reaped upon the house Porchetta.  Obviously slow cooked  for ages. it's as succulent as I've ever had, although served thinner than I've likewise ever seen and well prepared and properly bitter broccoli raab. That sandwich is certainly delicious and becomes more so when you factor in that it, unlike most of the other selections. is offered as a lunch special which includes one of the smaller pours of several of the offerings from the beautifully curated rotating lift of drafts behind the bar.  The title of my personal favorite sandwich in this shrine to the form however, and possibly my current favorite in the city, would have to go to the incredible one of a kind Shrimp Po' boy.  I cannot recall if this apparent method of preparation, it seems to be cooked, at least in part INSIDE a somewhat hollowed out loaf of fantastic French/Italian bread, with the Shrimp simmered perfectly in a ""bbq"" sauce that hits the perfect balance of savory and spicy without any of the asinine and cloying sweetness one might be wary of from a sauce with that moniker.  Other sandwiches, are reliably delicious as well, including a juicy house prepared Wagyu roast beef with decadent French-leaning accouterments, on a roll that deliciously resembles an everything bagel in taste and texture.              As I mentioned, the draft list is selected with evident care and knowledge, and in keeping with the principals of New Brooklyn philosophy, changes frequently.  Happily, in what is an unfortunate departure from the norm and many like-minded establishments, the staff, to a person I have found is nothing less than informed, helpful,  and (GASP) actually genuinely friendly!  Definitely one of the better places to arrive in the borough this past year, and in this area for quite some time.",5.0
"I balked and asked that they repeat themselves when they quoted a 30-minute wait for a porchetta sandwich to go, but they didn't flinch.The sandwich is overhyped and now $14 rather than the original $13, and no better than the mediocre one at the eponymous spot in the East Village, where it's larger & cheaper and prepared far quicker. The takeout menu is awkwardly small and placed near a register near the grocery area, further reinforcing the fact that they want you to dine in or sidle up to the butcher/cheese display here. The folks running the place also decided to leave the key in the back door too, pretty smooth.",3.0
"I had the baked potato with cod fish and took a vegetable sandwich back to work. The baked potato was DELISH!!!

I'll be back while I temporarily work around the corner.",5.0
"One of the best breakfast sandwiches I've ever had. Great setup and good vibes in this place. Would definitely come back in the evening to try their menu of beers.Coffee was excellent (got an americano) and it's nice that pickled onions and arugula are a free suggested addition to the breakfast sandwiches. On the walk through to the bar, you can peruse through some quality groceries from around the world.",5.0

"I guess I'll review this place for my 300th review...why not???This review is for the dining section only.   They also have a market area in the front but I didn't get a chance to fully browse through the joint.I've been hearing really good things about this place from fellow Yelpers.  I've had this place bookmarked for a while.   Another Yelper friend also wanted to try this place and we finally set a date to dine here.We were a group of 3.  We decided that we can order the food and share it since there were so many great options on the menu.  We started with a charcuterie plate of cured meats and cheeses.  I'm guessing it was salami and prosciutto....I think...I forgot what the name of the two cheeses were but it was delicious.  The plate was garnished with cornichons, roasted almonds and some jam.   Everything paired well with each other.   Although, I wished it came with more bread.....I love bread.  The next item was the pâté.  It was a simple yet tasty item, served with toasted baguette slices, a dallop of Dijon mustard on the side and more cornichons.   We also ordered the black cod and caviar baked potato, sambal roasted oysters, the N'Orleans BBQ Po'Boy sandwich, the porchetta sandwich (porchetta, broccoli rabe and parmigiana) and the Italian sandwich (mortadella, soppressata, hot coppa, speck, mozzarella, lettuce, pickled peppers and onions).  When asked which was my favorite dish, I couldn't give an exact answer.  They were all frickin good.  I guess I'll say the baked potato.  I heard the menu changes but I'm not sure how often...I'm not sure if it changes with the season. I also wanted to try the Mek-Muffin, but I didn't realize it was a brunch item.  Time to schedule a brunch date!!!",5.0
"Great little store/bar/gastropub on a quiet street.   One of my Yelp friends recommended I check out the place (thanks Matteo!) and thought it might be a good venue for my beer club.  After stopping by one Saturday afternoon and enjoying myself, I set up a beer club meetup and it was a smashing success.The back area with the tables and the bar is nice and comfortable.  Even on a warm night the garden was pleasant.  The selection of beers was great.  Everyone was telling me they were able to try beers they'd never had before and I found a couple of new favorites (both sours).  The food was great too.  I had the roast beef and every part of the sandwich was fresh and delicious.  I probably could have just eaten the bread it was served on!   The pork sandwich was also popular.  Soft shell crab sandwich received mixed reviews....of my three friends who ate that, two thought it was ""meh"" but one really liked it.Some of the taps poured slowly and with a lot of foam so that was a bit of a drag when there were almost 40 thirsty beer drinkers but the friendly team running the place did a great job taking care of everyone.The most common comment I heard from my crew was ""I wish we had a place like this in my neighborhood!"".  Sounds like a franchise opportunity waiting to happen!  I'll be back for sure.",4.0
"Name something you like and Mekelburg's is bound to have it. Craft beers? Check. Charcuterie meats and cheeses? Piles of them. Gourmet groceries? In spades. Delicious sandwiches? You betcha.I first learned about Mekelburg's from a post on reddit's /r/Brooklyn. I spoke to the owner Daniel about it, and he said that after a long opening week, he decided to post a bunch of the photos he had on his phone on a whim, and it sure worked because it got my butt in the door!Don't let the basement entrance of Mekelburg's fool you. Step inside and you'll find an oasis in the food desert. The first thing you'll see is fresh bread from Mazzola bakery, followed by a pretty substantial meat and cheese section (I couldn't leave without picking up some speck and Mahon from Spain). The dude working the counter was awesome and really knew his cheeses.Past that, you'll find all sorts of other goodies - a whole rack full of hot sauces you've never heard of, artisinal pickles, ready-to-bake Roberta's pizzas, lots of nuts and spices, and way more. They also have cold brew from Toby's available, which they offer with fancy farm milk. Might have been the best cold brew I've had in a long time!Walk to the back and you're greeted by the super cool bartender Mike, and behind him, a triple wide chalkboard with the food menu of the day, a dozen and a half craft beers on tap (some available to go in growlers!), and other available drinks. If they have the Grimm Lambo Door, definitely get a pint of that!The back room has an arched ceiling which makes it seem way more spacious than a basement has any right to be. There's also ample bar and table seating (you order food at the bar).Speaking of food, what they have here is nothing short of amazing.I had the porchetta sandwich, which was insanely crispy and juicy. There was also broccoli rabe in it, which added a nice contrasting texture and flavor.Also ordered the smoked salmon and cream cheese tartine. At some point, a tartine is big enough to be an open-faced sandwich, and this one definitely pushed the envelope. The pickled onions on top were a really nice touch.Last but not least, there was the fanciest baked potato I've ever had. It. Had. Caviar. On. It. Along with creme fraiche, and smoked cod that Daniel said was shipped from Alaska by a family member. So yeah, it was delicious. I didn't know a baked potato could be gourmet food, but hey, you learn something new every day.They also have a pretty large backyard. It has several picnic tables and is definitely a great place to spend a summer day with a cold craft beer.If I had to nitpick about something, it was that they didn't have bone marrow available the day I went. But that's just another reason to return!I wish Daniel and his wife Alicia all the best in their newest venture. He's such a nice guy who seems genuinely appreciative of his customers. We also had the pleasure of also meeting his 6-month-old son Jax, who Daniel jokes is the real owner of the shop.Hope to see you all again soon!",5.0
"4 1/2 strong,The hype is legitimate, and these sandwiches are excellent and several nothingness than  mind blowing. The set-up, easy to miss signage and location on one of the quieter blocks in one of the most picturesque districts in the borough,  down a flight of stairs from the street  with the fancy food and provisions shop in front, homey and cozy bar and cafe in the rear is about a new-Brooklyn as possible (with the sky high prices in the retail section to match!).  Such unabashed and excessive twee-ness would normally be cause for an instant strike against an establishment in my book, but again this spot backs it up with the goods in spades.        Much praise (including a selection as one of the NY Times Dining best dishes of 2015) has been reaped upon the house Porchetta.  Obviously slow cooked  for ages. it's as succulent as I've ever had, although served thinner than I've likewise ever seen and well prepared and properly bitter broccoli raab. That sandwich is certainly delicious and becomes more so when you factor in that it, unlike most of the other selections. is offered as a lunch special which includes one of the smaller pours of several of the offerings from the beautifully curated rotating lift of drafts behind the bar.  The title of my personal favorite sandwich in this shrine to the form however, and possibly my current favorite in the city, would have to go to the incredible one of a kind Shrimp Po' boy.  I cannot recall if this apparent method of preparation, it seems to be cooked, at least in part INSIDE a somewhat hollowed out loaf of fantastic French/Italian bread, with the Shrimp simmered perfectly in a ""bbq"" sauce that hits the perfect balance of savory and spicy without any of the asinine and cloying sweetness one might be wary of from a sauce with that moniker.  Other sandwiches, are reliably delicious as well, including a juicy house prepared Wagyu roast beef with decadent French-leaning accouterments, on a roll that deliciously resembles an everything bagel in taste and texture.              As I mentioned, the draft list is selected with evident care and knowledge, and in keeping with the principals of New Brooklyn philosophy, changes frequently.  Happily, in what is an unfortunate departure from the norm and many like-minded establishments, the staff, to a person I have found is nothing less than informed, helpful,  and (GASP) actually genuinely friendly!  Definitely one of the better places to arrive in the borough this past year, and in this area for quite some time.",5.0
"I balked and asked that they repeat themselves when they quoted a 30-minute wait for a porchetta sandwich to go, but they didn't flinch.The sandwich is overhyped and now $14 rather than the original $13, and no better than the mediocre one at the eponymous spot in the East Village, where it's larger & cheaper and prepared far quicker. The takeout menu is awkwardly small and placed near a register near the grocery area, further reinforcing the fact that they want you to dine in or sidle up to the butcher/cheese display here. The folks running the place also decided to leave the key in the back door too, pretty smooth.",3.0
"I had the baked potato with cod fish and took a vegetable sandwich back to work. The baked potato was DELISH!!! If you order it, just be sure to order something else because it isn't quite enough for a meal. I could eat it all day, every day. Service and atmosphere was really friendly. I'll be back while I temporarily work around the corner.",5.0
"One of the best breakfast sandwiches I've ever had. Great setup and good vibes in this place. Would definitely come back in the evening to try their menu of beers.Coffee was excellent (got an americano) and it's nice that pickled onions and arugula are a free suggested addition to the breakfast sandwiches. On the walk through to the bar, you can peruse through some quality groceries from around the world.",5.0

"What a great place!It's like a specialty deli/grocery store/bar/restaurant all rolled into one. Wonderful selection of artisanal meats and cheeses, fresh vegetables, tons of gourmet foodstuffs, breads, the list goes on and on. In the back they have a bar serving craft beers and food. The menu is pretty darn awesome. I had the following things: porchetta sandwich, smoked salmon and cream cheese tartine, and possibly the world's fanciest baked potato, topped with caviar, creme fraiche, and smoked cod.Was really hoping for the bone marrow, but it's hard to complain when you're eating a baked potato with caviar. The mix of salty creamy elements with the potato was fantastic. The porchetta sandwich and smoked salmon tartine are nothing to sneeze at either. The porchetta has wonderful crispy skin and was greasy, juicy, and meaty in the best way. The tartine was huge, and had generous portions of fish and smoked onions. Also enjoyed their beer selection, which Mike the bartender helpfully described some of the beers on the menu.Met Daniel the owner (and his adorable son) and really appreciated how warm and welcoming he was to all his customers. Looking forward to coming back!",5.0
"I first randomly discovered this place on Yelp as a recommended local lunch spot and decided to give it a try. So I headed over and ordered a Wagyu roast beef sandwich. Game over. I haven't been able to get it out of my head since. I am still raving about the sandwich to anyone who will listen (or maybe not listen). It is so good! I returned four days later with my fiancé and her friend for brunch, and they all loved it just as much. Our friend actually had other brunch plans later and wrote to us afterward saying she wished she had eaten more at Mekelburg's  I got the Wagyu roast beef sandwich again (why wouldn't I?) and my fiancé got the whitefish tartine, which she said was one of the top two whitefish salads she has ever had. Our friend got the smoked salmon tartine, which I am sure she is probably still thinking about as well. Maybe even raving about to anyone who will or will not listen. The storefront is very cute and small, packed with a lot of local and remote deliciousness and goodies. Great selection of meat, cheeses, frozen pizza from Roberta's, yummy artisanal mayos and pickles from local vendors, a great tea and coffee selection, and so much more. You can even refill liquid soaps and grind your coffee beans there. The restaurant in the back has a full bar with a great selection of beers, and a decent number of tables where you can sit back, relax, and enjoy their many goodies. There is also a small outdoor patio attached, which is a nice bonus.The staff and owners are really nice too. Very attentive and friendly. This place is my number one choice for awesome sandwiches and gourmet groceries in Clinton Hill for sure! You could blindly choose anything from the menu and not be disappointed....trust me!",5.0
"Beer selection is very good, but the bartender seemed a little snobby. Food was very good but took longer than I thought it would take to make something that wasn't hot. I still had to give it 5 stars because he made up for it with a mekel coffee titos Kalula concoction that was stellar.",5.0
"Super tasty food and excellent rotating beer selection. The porchetta sandwich is amazing! Also, the nicest bartenders who are very knowledgeable. They let you taste any beer before ordering to make sure you like it. Once, I ordered a pint without tasting first, and wasn't too into it. The bartender happily let me order a different one for free along with a free appetizer! All in all, a very easy-going and cozy place... highly recommend.",5.0

"tldr: offensively overpriced; bad neighborsReally an unwelcome presence in the neighborhood.  The food is fine (though the $15 sandwich I had last week was really nothing special - fancy ingredients, but more grease than flavor) and the selection of beers etc is pretty smart.  But the prices are an insult - as other reviewers have noted, things run well over what you'd find at whole foods and the like (e.g., $10+ for a pint of ice cream).  Is this neighborhood only for investment bankers and trust funders?  Businesses in diverse neighborhoods have a responsibility to cater to the full economic spectrum, not just the 1%.  Moreover, they really screwed over the community garden next door by placing a loud, bacon-scented vent that blows hot air right into the seating area.  It's a pity as I sense that the folks who run it are decent - but made some unfortunate choices.",2.0

It wasn't too sweet, a little crunch on the outside and a little scoop of ice cream on top and I'm still thinking about it a day later!  Of course had some beers too and I tried the Brett IPA, at the suggestion of the owner, which was new to me and I enjoyed it a lot.",5.0

"I hate to be the one jumping off the five-star bandwagon with this place, and I usually don't write follow-up reviews that are negative, but I think the success of Mekelburg's has been detrimental to all of the aspects that I initially loved about it. For one thing, the dining area now doubles as a Gymboree class for young hipster moms and their screaming children. I understand that the business itself can't control this, and it's more of a reflection of how the neighborhood is evolving; however, I do think that the staff could manage the situation better. Given that it's pretty much a self-service restaurant, it's not ideal to have entire tables or sections of the seating inaccessible to patrons and runners because they are filled with carelessly placed double-wide strollers and gigantic diaper bags. They should have designated areas, at least for the strollers, in order to make this place comfortable and possible to navigate. I've also found that the wait time for both take out orders and dine in orders has gone from long, to ridiculously long, to unacceptably long: 45-50 minutes for a cold cut sandwich is unacceptable. I could have gone to Mazzola Bakery, purchased the bread, returned to my apartment, and made the sandwich myself during that time. The food prep has started getting sloppier and sloppier, and the care that I used to see put into each product seems to be deteriorating. I recently placed a take out order for a ""build your own sandwich"" and waited 40 minutes for it only to discover when I got home that they left off one of the three ingredients (the most expensive one, coincidentally).

It also has a shop packed with all kinds of fine foods any other goodies -  It has a fantastic selection of those hard to find but essential english products - Golden Shred, Tetley tea bags, Maltesers, HP Sause, Salad cream and Ribeana. I also picked up a much needed marble mortar and pestle, then i had to leave because i couldn't carry anymore.....",5.0
"Ordered the porchetta sandwich. The good news, it was pretty good. The bad news, it took 35 minutes for them to make it. It should not take 35 minutes to make a sandwich to go. So overall impressions were not great. Not sure I'll go back.",2.0

"First time stopping in after months of passing by and it did not disappoint! Very friendly, knowledgeable and open staff, amazing craft beer selection that swaps out seasonally.We split the porchetta sandwich, burrata and acron squash small plate, and smoked black cod baked potato with caviar.The bartenders said we had the three best things on the menu, and I was blown away. The burrata app was one of the best dishes I've had in the city.Check this place out, you won't be sorry!",5.0

"I love this place. It's one part bar, haute cuisine grocery store, social club, baby friendly etc..  My wife and I met the owners Dan and Felicia when they opened the shop and have enjoyed their company and proprietorship ever since.  It's a place to pick up top quality chocolate at 9:30 PM when you've finished dinner and realized there is none in the house; a place to watch televised political debates, or games; a place to get an amazing latte and egg sandwich at 8:30 AM on the way to work. And the fact that it's in the basement of a cool residential building (with an outdoor garden!) as opposed to a traditional storefront makes it a little more special, as if you were at someone's home.  Great staff, great owners, great food.  Well done.",5.0
"Love the breakfast sandwich. Such a great spot for snacks, groceries, sandwiches and libations. A true gem in the neighborhood.",5.0
"Amazing outgoing, friendly and knowledgeable staff who always make us feel welcome.  A great place to hang out and watch the games!  The meat and cheese dishes are our favorite to order and are absolutely delicious. It's so fun that they pick our your selection and tell you about each one and where they come from.  Any extra request we have they are completely accommodating as well as answering any questions about their items. Highly recommend Mekelbergs!  A true gem.",5.0

"This is exactly the kind of place I wish there was more of.  Good people trying hard to present good, fresh farm to table products at appropriate prices.  And then there's the bar.  A beer drinker's paradise.  Never the same keg twice.  Bartenders who know the nuances in their product.  A desire to elevate the game.",5.0
"To go to Mekelburg's is to experience the adult version of ""a kid in a candy store"". You almost want to throw a party just so you can have a reason to buy everything. And when you're done with that, do not miss the soft shell crab ""BLT"". Hot damn. Looking forward to spending time on the patio. Welcome to the neighborhood Mekelburg's!!!",5.0

"The food and atmosphere were wonderful. The young male waiter and some of the staff in the store were the worst. The waiter forgot to place part one of our meals. (that's no biggie) what was the turn off is that he brought out my friends and said mine was coming right up. So we waited until we realized that my friends food was getting cold so I insisted he eat without me. 25 mins later with no food I finally wave down the bartender and instead of being honest and apologizing he said that my sandwich simply takes longer, ummm there is no such thing as a 1 hr sandwich. I only wanted to order another cocktail, which I did. Once the food came out, he never came back to check on us although we were sitting right at the bar, he stayed clear on the opposite side, he didn't offer to discount the sandwich or even pay for the extra drink I ordered while I waited. When shopping in the store the workers just seemed annoyed, were not helpful and had an aire of superiority for no good reason. This is a basement shop in a chill neighborhood they can save the stuck up attitude for the UES. The food was divine and I loved the atmosphere. They carried Greaters Icecream which I gladly spend $40 on.",3.0

"If one could fall head over heels for a cheese monger - this is where one would do it. Get the cheese plate. Do it. Moving on, this is a super fun local place with everything you need if you want to eat well or enjoy a quality brew. The bar experience was a little less than stellar - the beer was a tad warm, the bartenders service was very slow and he straight up said he doesn't like cocktails so don't ask for one. Overall this is a cool place and I'd definitely recommend stopping by.",4.0
"It is rare to find great food at a pub - great beer at a restaurant. That's why this place stands out as a refreshing and much needed addition to the scene.

"For the market. Since Choice Greene closed I've been hoping for a specialty grocer to replace it. I can hardly shop at upscale places on the regular, but sometimes you just need that special ingredient (or fresh bread! of which there is a dearth in this neighborhood, despite the rent prices). I had the delicious babka at a party and was excited to pick some up as an easy breakfast option for weekdays, particularly knowing they have late hours and can accommodate a busy 9-5ers schedule. Grabbed it and a frozen Roberta's pizza, neither of which had listed prices. Rung up for $25. I expected it to be pricey, but for a loaf of bread and a frozen pizza, though admittedly ""specialty,"" that is pretty rough. Not sure a normal person can afford even the occasional speciality ingredient here.",3.0

"It's clear that the people at Mekelburg's are trying very hard to create something special - no sullen teenagers behind the counter here! Everyone was enthusiastic and helpful and best of all, welcoming. We tried an assortment of their foods and I was impressed with what they've done at Mekelburg's. The porchetta sandwich was delicious with a ""just-right"" assertive flavor and -CRUNCH!- crispy bits of skin! Really great. The BLAST sandwich (bacon, lettuce, avocado, soft shell crab and tomato) was the second sandwich I tried and a testament to its wonderful flavor was the fact that it was not outshone by the porchetta sandwich I had just eaten. I could not choose which sandwich I liked better - they were both terrific. Really, all of the food offerings were creative and crafted well. These seem to be the leitmotifs of the place. Methinks you'll have a lovely meal here and you'll enjoy exploring the many gourmet food items they have available. Mekelburg's is a thoughtful business for the thoughtful customer.

"Great food, very friendly service.  Nice back yard - although there are mice running about which is pretty gross. And it's not cheap! A pint of Maine IPA is 9 dollars. This is way too much for a regular beer. The grocery store has lovely stuff but is taking the piss with its prices - Yorkshire Tea is 10 dollars!! Double the price of Wholefoods. Daylight robbery. It is disappointing as I live around the corner and enjoy all the local food places, but with prices like this I am put off going back.",3.0

"It doesn't get better than Mekelberg's.

"OOF, what a strange experience.     I really like the concept but there were one to many drastic horrible dimensions to give this place more than one star.   The cheesemonger and ladies in the front were very nice and helpful.  They had a beautiful selection of cheese and certain things I cannot get in the area (still no organic/humanely raised chicken/meat though) , which is fantastic. It was only until I stopped for a drink in the back things turned ugly.    I was greeted by five different people, off handedly and disgenuine.   As if I just stepped into Ippudo's dining room, a robotic manufactured sense of 'SO GLAD YOUR HERE TO GIVE US YOUR MONEY' shot at me from all sides.  the first thing I noticed after was some peculiar, out of place anime pictures on the wall,,nothing against anime pictures, just seems out of place.,,not my thing.  I sit down at the bar which has a lovely finish to it and greeted by the bartender who is chewing gum (gross!).  I ask her about the beer selection and she seems pretty unfamiliar with most of the offerings.  The selection is altogether fantastic although I don't understand why they don't have more NYC breweries,,so many of them putting out fantastic beer nowadays,, got support our neighbors people!  The music was really uninspired and kitchy,, it was as if i was transported to a lame bro den of the 90's with some present non offensive stale radio music to make it even more irritating.  Right now in my life I just don't need 'Love is what i got' by Sublime singing in my ear by some 40 year old yuppy.  I was also unhappy the bartender did not know how to pour beer at a beer bar, as she left the faucet sit inside the beer as she was pouring (discussing!).   I asked about where they get the meat for the sandwiches and I couldn't get a straight answer so I passed.  I find it sad at this day and age in these neighborhoods people still sell Mcdonalds grade meet..very disappointing.  I finished with a coffee and when I asked for milk they seemed to be out of the Rondybrook container, but have no fear,,they were delighted to refill it with cheap bodega milk for me.  I just think if they feel  they have to be deceptive about milk, what else are they being sneaky and dishonest about?  And the worse was still to come....   I asked for my check from the other bartender who seemed nice enough, although he had this weird, sly smile, painted on his face..disingenuous, if not downright scary.  He offered me another drink, I declined.  He then leaned in, broadened his crazy smile, and very car salesmen like asked ""are you sure?"".    Yes I am sure! I don't need the hard sell when it comes to alcohol thank you very much.  I can't think of a more irresponsible thing a bartender can do than press people to drink more when they have already stated they have had enough.   There should be laws against it.    I left, never to return.  Pro Tip,, when walking past here, try the other side of the street.  I was strolling past a couple nights later from Glorietta Baldy (a dope beer bar not to far from this place)  and one of the owners was outside pretty inebriated trying to coax people to come in for free shots.  It just seemed sort of desperate and more of the hard sell, car salesmen attitude I find very unappealing.",1.0
