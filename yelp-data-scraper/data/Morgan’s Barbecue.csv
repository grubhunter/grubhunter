"Great place to go before or after a game at the Barclays. Got dinner before an Islanders game two weeks ago, and drinks after a Nets game last week. Fun atmosphere, not pretentious unlike some other places around, our server (I think her name was Ursula?) was a delight, and the food was delicious.We shared a bunch of things but would definitely recommend the beef rib, the fatty brisket, the wings, the pulled pork, and the key lime pie for dessert (seriously though, get the key lime pie).",5.0
"After church my family and I decided to have lunch here. We arrived soon after they opened, so we were seated right away. The great thing about this place is you can order by the 1/4 1/2 or 1b. So if you want to just give something a try they make it really easy. The brisket was smoked to perfection. It was flavorful and had the perfect amount of fat. The pork ribs were also delicious. The flavors are intense and the meat is literally falling off the bone.I was excited  to try the jerk Mac and cheese and was a bit disappointed. The flavors are on point but the consistency was horrible. The noddles are dreadfully overlooked and the runny cheese sauce didn't help. I also enjoyed the fact that they had a few kiddie options. My sons favorite (grilled cheese and French fries) was available and he really enjoyed it. Although this meal was on the children's menu, the portion was pretty big. Overall Morgan's has perfected BBQ meats it seems like everything else seems like an afterthought.",3.0
"Out late at night and looking for some food that wasn't a deli or McDonald's in the area. Super excited when I found out Morgan's was open until 2 AM. I live in the neighborhood and have been wanting to try the spot for a while. However, I was really disappointed with both the service and the food.The server was over us from the minute we got there. I get it, it's 1 AM on a Friday and you're really not stoked to be serving so late. But, we were completely nice and not wasted and of obnoxious as I'm sure a lot of the crowd at that time can get, yet the server wasn't friendly or prompt at all. OK, not a big deal for some good late-night food. Unfortunately, the food was a disappointment as well. We got the wings and while they were the best thing we ordered they still were pretty sad. The sauce was served on the side which I guess is standard practice here but it made it really hard to eat and get a good sauce distribution. I was most disappointed in the brisket sandwich which I had read good things about on yelp. It was really dry, sliced really thin, and had no flavor to speak of. I really wanted to like this sandwich! Granted, we came here at 1AM on a Friday so the food may not have been up to the standard it usually is , but I can't say I'll be coming back here anytime soon.",2.0
Came here for a friend's birthday. BBQ is usually not my cuisine of choice when choosing where to eat out in NYC so I may be a bit biased. We ordered a bunch of meets to share and I got the Frito Pie and coleslaw. Wasn't really super impressed and I thought the Frito Pie was pretty salty (I guess Fritos are salty in the first place but I digress).I tried someone else's corn side which I actually thought was one of the better sides I tried that evening. Great central location near Atlantic Avenue/Barclays Center.,3.0
"Tremendous value for the portions of the food, especially if you order the dinner-plate-size stack of three crumbly pancakes and the brisket and eggs, which includes 1/4 pound of mixed brisket (lean and fatty), two eggs, salad greens, hash (not noted on the menu, but a nice--but SPICY, brisket-studded surprise, so be warned...a friend sensitive to heat couldn't eat hers), and easy substitution of toast for a buttery, also crumbly biscuit for $16. The only exception re: value was the 8-minute egg, where the entree for $13 was the same size as the add-on for $3. I'm not sure if that was a mistake or not, but that seems rather silly.The meat is delicious and that gorgeous pink smoke ring is readily apparent. The sauce is a perfect happy medium between thick sweet and vinegar-based thin ones, and the house dressing for the salads is great as well, if not a little sweet. Martin's rolls are the breads for the sandwiches, which is a nice regional touch, but everything else is Austin-focused. I loved seeing the piles of wood at the bottom of the stairs--proof positive that the meat is smoked overnight, as they tell you when you sit down. Coffee is strong--our table went through cup after cup of milk!--but delicious. The many varieties of mac and cheese are incredible; we had the gruyere, mushroom, and spinach and it was luxuriant. Everyone in our party of 6 had a brunch entree and shared the 8-oz (medium) mac and we could barely finish it since it was so rich! However, it's an absolute must. Service (we had this lovely blonde-ish server with a pixie cut) is absolutely wonderful, especially in direct contrast to James, where we were turned away after multiple attempts to make a brunch reservation for our large group and multiple assurances that we'd be fine driving in from Suffolk County to dine there. However, Morgan's definitely kept us from feeling like we settled when we stumbled upon it. I'd come back for sure.",4.0
"Solid BBQ spot with a nice space and casual vibe. I came here for brunch/lunch on a Saturday with three friends and we were pleased to be seated immediately and given a wide variety of menu options to choose from. We ordered a mixture of breakfast/BBQ food (and went heavy on the mac n cheese because of course). I really dug the pulled pork sandwich, served with coleslaw on top. Normally, I'm not a big slaw fan but Morgan's was delicate and complemented the tender pork while adding some crunchiness to the sandwich. I doused the whole thing in their delicious barbecue sauce at the table and the whole thing was over much too soon.The mac was slightly less impressive - my plain side was a little bit bland, so in the future I would opt for one of the many flavored options (buffalo, chicken tinga, mushroom). The cocktails were also a bit lackluster but not bad by any means. Would need to try some more of the BBQ food and desserts before bumping Morgan's up to a 5, but I was certainly satisfied with the experience and prices. Brunch including a few cocktails and split four ways was under $25 per person - success!",4.0
This place is amazing. The menu has an assortment of meals for anyone. The staff is friendly. It's a place that's home away from home.Definitely need to experience Morgan's.,5.0
"Morgan's BBQ! Thee I love! :) I love the selection of BBQ entrees at Morgan's and the ambiance is so chill! The waiters and waitress are always willing to give really great recommendations and the food comes out relatively quick. My favorite dessert is the Pecan Pie...note: I'm from the South!   The music selection is always really pumped and the games are always on at the bar. The restaurant is a nice size so it isn't too tightly packed and during warmer months the patio is open and it is so nice to sit outside. The neighborhood is fun and lively with great activities to get into after lunch/dinner, e.g., shopping! You can't go wrong with any of the macs, but if you want something more spicy try the Jamaican Jerk Mac & Cheese. The catfish sliders are also pretty awesome and the Texas Red Chili is a winner! I really like Morgan's, which is why I always return when I'm craving BBQ!",4.0
"Morgan's BBQ is located in a very bustling area a hop, skip, and a jump away from the Barclays Center. It's in a fairly centralized location so it's a great place to meet up with friends. This past week, a friend and I met at Morgan's for happy hour. I must say it was one of the best choices we ever made. I arrived at 4pm and seated myself outside. There weren't many customers but people started to trickle in moderately as it became closer to dinner time. The server quickly brought over ice water with a couple menus. The service continued to be friendly and attentive. Upon looking at the draft beers, I thought I entered beer heaven. I wanted to try every single one of them. They all seemed to have some kind of fruity element. The server was able to tell me a little bit about each one of them and which ones she suggested. I ended up getting 2 draft beers ($4 each for the happy hour special). Once my friend arrived we ordered wings along with chips and queso. The wings can't with buffalo sauce and blue cheese on the side. Everything was absolutely delicious. The wings and the queso were super flavorful. This place left a very positive impression on me and I'll definitely be back!",5.0
"A fun laid-back vibe, and as someone who possesses Texas roots I can vouch that their sign out front advertising ""a taste of Texas"" doesn't disappoint.  Cozy inside on the nippy day I visited, but the outdoor patio left me longing to return when the weather was more forgiving.  The brisket sandwich was delish and the standard lean meat option was much appreciated. Be forewarned, when the menu says sandwiches served ""with cole slaw"" they mean on top and not on the side.If you don't want your BBQ dinner to break the bank then go on a weekday when you get a free side thrown in with your sandwich.  Otherwise sides will cost you a pretty penny, as seems to be the norm with BBQ in the city.  Though the breadcrumb-topped Mac and Cheese is hearty enough to fill you up pretty well on its own. Fast takeout as well, handled by a friendly bar staff.",4.0
"I arrived late so ended up snacking on some of the various pork entrees other people had ordered. Overall the BBQ was good, but not great. They were also out of Shiner at the time I stopped by, which was a little disappointing considering the nature of the restaurant. There aren't a lot of BBQ places in this part of Brooklyn (or in general), so Morgan's does fill a void nicely if you're looking for decent mac and cheese or some slow roasted brisket.",3.0
"My favourite BBQ place in the neighbourhood, by far. Get the fatty brisket, and the chicken - they're amazing, and definitely what this place does best (their pulled pork and ribs are tasty, but not significantly better than what most places do).The corn bread is fantastic, and the other sides (I always get Mac & Cheese and collards) are well done. Plus a pitcher of Shiner Bock and you can't go wrong.",5.0
"Ok kids, lets talk BBQ.Lets talk about Morgan's BBQ, specifically, because they kinda know what they're doing over there on Flatbush...Like the way they pile their sandwiches up high.  Super tender pulled pork on an oversized potato bun.  Yeah, I said oversized.  No little buns here and excellent meat/bun ratio.  And that bbq sauce?  So delish.  Tangy, vinegary and easily accessible in a bottle right there on the table. Lets also talk about the sides offered.  All the usual suspects were on the menu - mac, beans, potato salad, etc.  For lunch* I had a side of Mac&Cheese with my sandwich and was seriously (and sadly) underwhelmed.  The mac had a good cheese factor but the pasta itself was mush, like it had been cooked too long and then sat even longer.  So disappointed by the mac.But I'd rather not leave on a negative note- sooo lets talk quick about the look and feel of Morgan's.  It's pretty nice.  It's most impressive feature would have to be the large open dining room/bar and patio for dining al fresco.  Back inside are a handful of booths for more intimate dining.  Bonus points for the open window kitchen, lighting and cool wood scraps flooring throughout.Comfortable atmosphere + delicious bbq = a really good visit to Morgan's.  A fine addition to the Flatbush Ave restaurant scene.*I highly recommend doing Morgan's for a weekday lunch (if you can swing it of course) special - $10.50 gets you a pulled pork sandwich AND a side.  Any other time a side of mac&cheese is $5 extra bringing your total to $15.50.",4.0
Love their Mac n cheese the chicken Tinga one I believe. The corn is also really good. I've had their catfish sliders and OMG they are delish!!!!!! I've also had the brisket and sausage.EVERYTHING IVE HAD IS GOOD!! I'm still trying to have the beef ribs but evert time I go it is sold out .,4.0
"Found my first miss on my bbq adventures.I had such high hopes and a hankering for good bbq.Thoroughly disappointing and sick.The waitress decided to switch half way through our meal, the new one saw us once and that was it.I had some of the most flavorless pulled pork ever, which I didn't even think was possible. ordered french fries, they didn't make it to the table until we were finished eatingMy bf ate his brisket and vomited within a half hour of leaving.The queso was the only saving grace of this place.",2.0
"Went here on a Sunday evening around 6, we were seated pretty quickly. The seats on the wall are veryyyy close together!The mac & cheese was sooo worth the wait . It was one of the best Mac&cheeses I've ever tasted from a restaurant. My friend & I even ordered 2 extras for us to take home after we ate.I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I got the half chicken and the leg of the chicken was undercooked on certain parts. Some of it was very pink and rubbery so I put it aside. All and all the food was really good, next time I'll just specify my meat be cooked well through.",4.0
"The ribs were fairly good.The brisket was tough and dry. And I ordered the fatty brisket, but it had no fat on it.The pulled pork was abysmal. It was drier than crackly calloused feet.

The sauce was super sweet and didn't help at all.The macaroni from Elbow Room was the best part of the meal.",2.0
"Watch my video and feel the joy! :DDAYUM, Thank you Tom Colicchio. Ginormous Beef Rib $27. This thing. We call in the indominous rib because it is straight up from Jurassic World. Crust was a little bit on the salty side, but the inside was just rightly reasoned and it did come apart from the bone very easily. I liked it very much. 1/2lb FATTY (if you must order) Brisket was excellent. Good fat ratio, soft, again a little too salty but mostly on the crust which you can remove. The BBQ sauce was to die for, spicy, tasty, not overly sweet. EXCELLENT.Cole Slaw, good, i would recommend it. Came around 5pm so it was happy hour. Only 2 items, thats sad. The $2 tacos (pulled pork and brisket) were a great deal, but way too SALTY, that was a miss. I don't know if i would have them again. And $7 Pulled Pork Queso...WOW, I don't think I have had dipping queso this good. On Point guys. The food is very filling, I recommend ordering sensibly and go from there. Food doesn't take long because it is already smoked and ready to please your palate.They were out of Red Ales (my faves) so had to make do with Shiner Bock Dark Ale (meh) and Abita Light. The Sweet tea + Bourbon was kind of strong (wow), It was okay though.Service was excellent. My friend brought in a cake for my bday and they gave us the works to celebrate it. Excellent dinner!",4.0
"Yay! I'm a fan.Went to Morgan's before an Islander game a week ago- brought a friend who had never had BBQ before, so it was a ""fingers-crossed- I-hope-this-is-good"" kind of experience.. and it delivered! It's December, but unseasonably warm, and we were hot from walking from Atlantic   Terminal to Prospect Park, and then back to Morgans before the game, so we opted to sit outside as they have picnic table style benches that can fit something like 15 people at a table. Good for people watching too, so no disappointment there.It was quite busy, and there was only one server working the entire area, so service overall was a bit slower than what you expect. Still though, nothing atrocious, just relax and enjoy. I had the mushroom mac n cheese- very good- enough for two to share as a part of a meal. I also had the kale ceasar salad with cornbread croutons, but I asked for a half portion, and it was perfect- even big for a half portion. Next time I'll try the pulled pork.My dinner mate had 1/2 lb of lean brisket and collard greens- all were really tasty and great, but the 1/2 lb brisket was not a lot of food (it was hard to understand how much it would really be- us silly gooses didn't know). I would recommend a pound of whatever meat you get if this is a dinner meal, and then at least one side. To make it a hearty meal, I would venture to do two sides. Why not?Drinks- I had a manhattan, and it was really good- strong and not watered down. My friend had a drink which had mezcal, and it was so overly smokey that it was disappointing, I tried it too and it had a brutal aftertaste in my opinion. This place was good- the only thing was that the meat portions were hard to visualize, and the price was steep- but then again, good quality food! They're open till 12am during the week I believe, and 2am on Fri and Sat- perfect for after a game at Barclays.",4.0
It's pretty safe to say that Morgan's has some solid BBQ but nothing necessarily extraordinary.  The beef brisket was tender and well seasoned but unfortunately arrived a little cold to the table.  The corn bread was soft and tasty.  I appreciate the collab with the Elbow Room but the mac and cheese kinda tasted like Kraft Mac and Cheese with some extra umph. The best part of the meal was certainly the beef ribs and we were lucky enough to get the last serving.  It was super tender and extremely filling.  This was recommended by our waitress and was hands down the show stopper.We lingered for a while chatting and sipping on our drinks without feeling rushed.  I would definitely revisit.,3.0

"BARBEQUE!!!! MY FAVORITE!! Morgan's BBQ is probably one of my favorites so far. There is outdoor seating and cute mason jars for your beer!

Came here before a game at Barclays and immediately came back. Food was outrageously good. Really traditional Texas smoked BBQ. We got the tacos before the game. Happy hour was $2 tacos!! $4 beers!! Food was so good we wanted to come back and try more. The fatty brisket was absolutely my favorite thing on the menu. Juicy and so much flavor. No sauce needed. My wife had a brisket stuffed loaded potato which was almost a meal on its own and she now gets it every time we come. Ribs just fell off the bone. For sides we had Jamaican Jerk Mac and cheese. They have an entire menu dedicated to specialty Mac and chez!! Corn in a cup was the big winner for me. It was like Mexican street corn but creamy and off the cob. My wife loved the spicy collard greens. The staff was wonderful. It was pretty crazy before the game but they went out of their way to really make sure we had a great experience and now whenever we come back they treat us like friends instead of customers. Great neighborhood vibe. Can't wait for the summer so we can sit outside all day and night. The bartender had a really extensive knowledge of the whiskey selection and steered us in the right direction. Balcones Brimstone. Get it. Great food. Great people. Great place.,5.0
"Came here late, and they were out of basically the first three things one might think to order when going to a barbecue joint. That turned out to be a great thing, as both my wife and I tried something we might not have!Do not ignore the Turkey Tails. Hot sauce, greens, crispy meat. Really, really good stuff. One of the tastiest things I had during my trip to New York. The macaroni and cheese varieties are almost overwhelming, and the two that we had were both superb. If I were to go back I'd get the tails, some really delicious cornbread, and a few beers to watch a game.",5.0
"Hands down, my favorite place to eat in Brooklyn. Originally from the south, it's tough to find authentic BBQ where the meat is spiced and smoked to perfection and the sauce is not overly sweet. Morgans gets it right, 100% of the time. The ribs and brisket are amazing - but since you order by the pound, you get more for your money with the brisket. The Elbow Room menu of mac & cheese is delicious, and the cornbread and honey butter is to die for. My fiance orders the wings every time he goes, and the chicken is just as good as the pork. It is a loud restaurant, so be prepared for noise and probably a wait for a table, but it's worth it. They deliver too, so really it's a win-win.",5.0
"Absolutely a good stop before/after an event at the Barclays Center. We stopped in for dinner between two events and got some delicious Mac and cheese (a sausage Mac du jour and classic), some ribs, wings, and corn bread. They were super welcoming and happy to accommodate our big group, and the service was good (food comes quickly too, at least what we ordered). Beer comes in pints and pitchers and averages about $7 a pint. The Mac and BBQ was good and filling (not mind blowing but delicious considering how hungry we were) but cost could climb seriously if you order a bunch a la carte. Definitely recommend as a near-Barclays option, perhaps not as a destination solely.  But good for a big group of friends to share some good food.",4.0

My wife had a brisket stuffed loaded potato which was almost a meal on its own and she now gets it every time we come. Ribs just fell off the bone. For sides we had Jamaican Jerk Mac and cheese. They have an entire menu dedicated to specialty Mac and chez!! Corn in a cup was the big winner for me. It was like Mexican street corn but creamy and off the cob. My wife loved the spicy collard greens. The staff was wonderful. It was pretty crazy before the game but they went out of their way to really make sure we had a great experience and now whenever we come back they treat us like friends instead of customers. Great neighborhood vibe. Can't wait for the summer so we can sit outside all day and night. The bartender had a really extensive knowledge of the whiskey selection and steered us in the right direction. Balcones Brimstone. Get it. Great food. Great people. Great place.,5.0
"Came here late, and they were out of basically the first three things one might think to order when going to a barbecue joint. That turned out to be a great thing, as both my wife and I tried something we might not have!Do not ignore the Turkey Tails. Hot sauce, greens, crispy meat. Really, really good stuff. One of the tastiest things I had during my trip to New York. The macaroni and cheese varieties are almost overwhelming, and the two that we had were both superb. If I were to go back I'd get the tails, some really delicious cornbread, and a few beers to watch a game.",5.0
"Hands down, my favorite place to eat in Brooklyn. Originally from the south, it's tough to find authentic BBQ where the meat is spiced and smoked to perfection and the sauce is not overly sweet. Morgans gets it right, 100% of the time. The ribs and brisket are amazing - but since you order by the pound, you get more for your money with the brisket. The Elbow Room menu of mac & cheese is delicious, and the cornbread and honey butter is to die for. My fiance orders the wings every time he goes, and the chicken is just as good as the pork. It is a loud restaurant, so be prepared for noise and probably a wait for a table, but it's worth it. They deliver too, so really it's a win-win.",5.0
"Absolutely a good stop before/after an event at the Barclays Center. We stopped in for dinner between two events and got some delicious Mac and cheese (a sausage Mac du jour and classic), some ribs, wings, and corn bread. They were super welcoming and happy to accommodate our big group, and the service was good (food comes quickly too, at least what we ordered). Beer comes in pints and pitchers and averages about $7 a pint. The Mac and BBQ was good and filling (not mind blowing but delicious considering how hungry we were) but cost could climb seriously if you order a bunch a la carte. Definitely recommend as a near-Barclays option, perhaps not as a destination solely.  But good for a big group of friends to share some good food.",4.0

"THAT BRISKET !I am a long time fan of another BBQ joint in LES and when my boyfriend mentioned we would be dining here with friends from out of town, I was a bit skeptical. I felt as if I was betraying my beloved spot in LES but to my dismay I was proven wrong. I personally had the corn in a cup and catfish taco and picked from my boyfriend's brisket loaded baked potato and ribs. All were equally delicious and made fresh. Our waitress was very friendly and attentive. Will definitely be coming back to get my hands on some mac and cheese!",5.0
I was a bit skeptical about coming to this restaurant but my cousin insisted. We went on a late night. Their wings was great & the Jamaican jerk mac was everything. I'm not a fan of brisket but it was decent.,4.0
"Ordered 1/4 lb of pulled pork, got charged for 1/2. Waitress was so busy that I didn't get a chance to address the discrepancy. Service in general mediocre at best. Cornbread was just okay. Buffalo Mac & Cheese was delicious. I wouldn't rush to visit again with so many restaurants in the area.",3.0
"Wow.A snug spot with a triangular bar that wraps around the kitchen. Outdoor seating could be pleasant in warm weather.Extremely friendly servers are all very willing to help.We were four people sharing an assortment of pounds, half and quarter pounds of meat.They were out of the giant beef ribs we saw being served at another table by the time we arrived, a shame as they were truly Dinosaur bones and appeared from afar to be fine specimens.The fatty brisket has a heavy rub that runs into the delicate meat. The meat is juicy and flakes apart easily. Smoke flavor is strong but does not out shine the expertly finished meat. Turkey slices are sliced thin and running with juice. Tender, these slices have a nice smokiness in each bite. Turkey tails are fatty and have a very thick skin. A slightly sour flavor is somewhat overwhelming although the meat is moist.Spare ribs are flecked with salt and pepper and smoked to a thin but crisp ""skin"" like exterior. Not much bark but a perfectly cooked piece of meat. Pink flows almost to the center and the cartiledge is just beginning to dissolve. The meat tears easily from the bone without canoeing.Pulled pork is thick and freshly pulled. Liquid love (juice) coats the pink and grey meat. Chunks of rub are mixed in.A cup of chili is rich with beans and meat.Corn bread is moist.A totally excellent bbq spot bested only barely by Hometown and Brisket Town, but just barely.",4.0
"We made a special trip to come here after we saw the restaurant on Bravo's Best New Restaurant TV show. We were so disappointed! We wanted to be really impressed after we heard how good the BBQ was, but we went (a couple of w/e ago) it just wasn't. We ordered a 1/4lb of ribs, pulled pork, brisket with a side of mushroom Mac & cheese and a side of sweet potato. Firstly, we ordered the sweet potato with brisket and it came out plain, hence the need to then order 1/4lb of brisket. We made the error known to a member of staff who responded that she was told by the server it was plain sweet potato, so put that through. There was no response to us ordering brisket after we received our food, due to their error?! They just took the order & charged us for it! The best bit of the meal- the Mac & cheese! With the mushrooms it was delicious!! The 'plain' sweet potato, meh...The meat- I was so disappointed with the ribs. As per the tv show, these were the thing to have. They were very pink & not very smoky. The pulled pork was better, but a bit bland and I ended up caving & adding BBQ sauce! The brisket was good, but a bit dry, not melt in your mouth, like I've had at other BBQ joints. Overall, a disappointing experience. Probably would not return.",3.0
"Good BBQ is like a cocktail bar where the ""mixologists"" don't wear suspenders. It's rare (see what I did there?), but they exist. Morgan's has become my go to for some good BBQ! Located in my neighborhood, cooked to perfection, and in a chill environment.  Located on the Corner of Flatbush and St. Marks, Morgan's provides lots of outdoor space and room inside to have a good time. The servers are fast and know how to hustle. The food here will give you everything your heart desires. Actually it's probably more I what your stomach and mind want. Your heart's arteries would be disappointed with your delicious decision. I really love their brisket. While I don't usually go with turkey at a BBQ spot, here it's an unknown gem. They are connected to elbow room so you can get some top notch Mac n Cheese for a few more bucks. They have a pretty good selection of beers. I recommend getting some pitchers if you're with a group. The cocktails aren't that bad either. My one knock on the place is the bang for your buck. It is the best BBQ in that area of Brooklyn. I just find other places that have top of the line BBQ, offer you a little more for your money. A sandwich (which isn't that large of a portion), some Mac n Cheese, and two drinks, can run you around $50 after tip. So if you've got a hankering for great BBQ, come to Morgan's. Just remember to bring some extra cash.",4.0
"We came for a lunch break during work on a gorgeous bright sunny day. A good opportunity to seat outside and eat on the benches. Elbow Room has been incorporated into Morgan's Barbecue. If you want some Elbow Room, it is on the Morgan's Barbecue menu. We ordered some the Smoked Chicken Wings. I liked the good smoked flavor. Good crispy outside with a juicy chicken on the inside. From the Elbow Room menu, we had the Mushroom Mac and the Margherita Mac. I liked the Mushroom Mac. It has mushrooms, spinach, and some crispy shallots. Very cheesy and gooey. Good flavors. Love the crispy shallots. The Margherita Mac was also good. It tomatoes and basil. Good freshness taste it. A lot of stuff I would like to try when I get a chance to come back here.",4.0
"This BBQ joint is fantastic! We had the best time there on Easter for a late lunch - we were a group of five and walked right in without a reservation.

Actually we got a pitcher of the stuff and slurped it down. It's sweet and spicy and delicious. Good beer selection also!Just WOW to the food - this was the best pork ribs and fatty brisket I've ever had! Literally the meat fell off the ribs and the spices rubbed onto the meat we're unbelievably delicious. 1/2 lb of the brisket and 1 lb of the ribs (5 ribs) was good for 2-3 people. We also tried the cheesy chili fries (this was my favorite of the sides - the chili has chunks of brisket in it), the collard greens, the beans, the jerk chicken mac and cheese (I didn't taste it but my family raved about it), coleslaw, brisket tacos and a brisket sandwich.

"I took my best friend here for a pre birthday lunch we got a server named Vegas he was super sweet and very helpful with the menu although most of the stuff we ordered was sold out ( brisket ) we decided to try the ribs, the wings ,mac and cheese, pinto beans ,potato salad and ice tea. Alought to my taste buds some of the smoked meat tasted a little salty but everything was cooked to perfection.  Will go back to try the brisket.",4.0
"Our waitress was lost through the entire meal, but the fatty brisket and pork ribs were enjoyable, albeit pricey for the portion. The Mac & cheese and collards sides were average. They started with some solid, older soulful tunes, then Hotline Bling & Can't Feel My Face kicked in once our weak desserts arrived. Their 'signature' bourbon pecan pie was truly awful, a scorching, soupy, flavorless mess that explained why our server didn't recommend it along with the others when she brought the dessert menus. (Brownie in a cup was solid, at least, so the taste in our mouths leaving wasn't quite as bad.) Wondered how they could stay open until 2, as no one was in the dining room, but noticed the bar was thriving on our way out. (Forgot why this place looked familiar until after we left -- featured on an episode of Bravo's ""Best New Restaurant"")",3.0
"Where do I begin to describe how amazing this place is?Let's set the scene: it's 5:00 pm on a rainy, cold Saturday in Park Slope Brooklyn. My wife and I, having seen Morgan's featured in Bravo's Best New Restaurant, felt it imperative to make the journey from NJ to BK to see if the hype was real. I love smoked meat, so it seemed like a perfectly good idea to travel over bridges and highways to come to this Mecca of meat. The aroma of smoked meat greeted me like the father of the Prodigal Son, making no judgement as to why it took me so long to get here. Our happy hostess had us seated in the cozy, casual, and simple place within 10 minutes. Just enough time for me to get a delicious drink from the bar, Jack's Candy I believe? Think of it as an Old Fashioned with a touch more sweetness. A great welcome beverage. My pregnant wife looked on with envy as we looked at our menus and began to formulate a game plan.The game plan was this: order everything we wanted, and let God sort out the stuff we would be taking home. Started off with:Chili-cheese fries-the chili was SO good, that the fries just got in the way. It was great, but I wanted more of the juicy steak chunks rather than the crispy fries. Plus, as great as the idea of chili cheese fries usually sounds, the soggy mess that ultimately becomes about half the order of fries often later nullifies whatever beauty the initial decision carried with it. Next time, I'll get chili, I'll get fries, just not mixed together. Old School Mac n Cheese-really good, delicious even. If I had to make one complaint, it would be the breadcrumb topping. The breadcrumbs weren't crispy, quite the contrary actually, but the Mac and cheese itself was delish. That being said, if go with...Cheeseburger Mac and cheese-a pleasant surprise. With the beef and pickles accenting the dish, it was super yummy! Then we just decided to pretty much order the menu:Pork ribs-very good, but not the best I've had. The dry rub is so amazing it helps, but this is one of the few things I prefer to be more sauce based in the BBQ world. Pulled pork sandwich- AWESOME pulled pork on potato bread with Cole slaw on top. Pork is super tender, well seasoned, and perfect for a sandwich.Beef and Sausage links-Holy Crap these were good. We were a little partial to the beef sausage, but both were tender and fresh and smokey and...my mouth is watering as I write.Ginormous beef rib-This is a must get. Repeat, A MUST GET. It's fatty and sweet and slightly spicy and meaty and has a beautiful crust and, take my word for it, perfectly delicious reheated the next day.The fatty brisket here belongs on the Mount Rushmore of meats I've ever eaten...ever. The dry rub is on fleek, the smokiness is omnipresent, and the meat literally melts in your mouth. If you have 24 hours to live and need to eat meat before meeting your maker, not eating this might just earn you a trip to purgatory for making such a bad decision.We took a ton of food home, and sadly skipped desserts because there's a Doughnut Plant right next to the joint. I promise you though Morgan's that I will try dessert next time.Everyone must go here, and if you're a vegetarian  then well, I just feel bad for you.",4.0
"Ok, so have you ever dined out at a restaurant and didn't review it because you wanted to see if you could double your pleasure. Morgan's Barbecue is just the place. Me and a good friend dined here over the summer and I was very impressed - impressed - impressed! For a BBQ spot, I was most (yes .. wait for it) impressed with everything that I ordered off the menus. I was curious to see if this was a fluke but today's trip confirmed my initial feeling about this BBQ eatery. Before I say another word, my bartender Kate was simply amazing. If you are so luck, you may get the chance to meet Kate. Service with a smile and her ginger lemonade was to die for. I had two and wanted a third. The good news is that the whole staff is dynamite. You would be hard pressed to find a better run restaurant. I just wish they had more space to do their thing. I wouldn't want them to move but I wish the place was a tad larger. You will have died and gone to BBQ Heaven if you eat here. Trust me on this one, I know BBQ.",4.0
"I've eaten here 4 times, once for dinner and 3 times for brunch! I actually love their brunch...enough to keep returning.

We've gotten on our visits breakfast tacos, breakfast burrito, brisket and eggs, kale caesar, maple bacon...it's all good and resonably priced. We've also had mimosas, bloodies, and one time in particular we split two pitchers of the Smokey Stawberry Lemonade....the bomb....Oh and the staff has always been super friendly, the food fast and good.

"We've created a little bbq crew and its our mission to keep trying all the different bbq spots in nyc. This time we made it out to Brooklyn for Morgan's BBQ as our friend saw it is being featured on the Bravo Best new restaurant series. Ive gotta say it did not disappoint and the review of this place on the show is spot on. We started the queso + chips. We did the regular 8oz of queso with no meat (you can order with meat mixed in.) Great flavor, definitely a treat in a city where queso is scarce, and they bring over more chips if you need them. Ordered the lemonade- they only offer a lemonade with ginger. If you dont like ginger, you wont like this. It was good but I wish they also had a regular lemonade option. My friend ordered the (forgot the name) bourbon + sweet tea and it was very tasty. The reason to come here is definitely the meat! Im boring when it comes to meat selection.  I ordered the pork sandwich, comes with coleslaw on top and a side. I have to say their pulled pork was flavorful, peppery, and didnt need sauce.My friend ordered the fatty brisket and ribs. She agrees with Tom Colicchio that the brisket definitely stands alone and does NOT need sauce. She recommends it! Ribs were also delicious and falling off the bone. The sides- some were better than others. The sweet potato is so tasty! The potato salad was okay. Cole slaw (on top of my sandwich) was light and fresh. Also ordered the mac and cheese, it comes with bechamel + garlic breadcrumbs. It was alright. I prefer a creamier mac and cheese. Ultimately, the sides are there so you don't get ""meat drunk"" as my friend puts it. We were there midweek around 5pm and have to say the service was friendly and good. One of the staff members looked like he could have been the understudy for Jamal on ""Empire"". He was nice and great at recommending options. They had the right balance of being attentive and not annoyingly so. They did forget our mac and cheese order but made sure to get that out to us ASAP. Overall service was really solid. The space is pretty large and I can see how on a warm, sunny day that patio out front will get a lot of use. They also have a happy hour (4-5$ drinks and 2$ tacos!). Oh! and their playlist that day reminded me of one of my high school playlists- a lot of Jack Johnson, Bob Marley, and Sublime. Would definitely return.

When it's good the pork ribs and fatty brisket in particular are superb - worthy of five stars. And don't put any sauce near it because as good as there sauce is (that is consistent at least!), they really don't need it. And I should also point out that this review doesn't include the Elbow Room that shares the site as all of the mac&cheeses from there have been delicious.There have been quite a few times recently when the meat has tasted obviously grilled and charred. I'm not sure if they do it to reheat the food, but one time it was so heavily charred that the ribs were inedible; even the cut edges of the ribs had grill marks on them meaning they were pre-cut and then grilled! We sent them back and the next set that they gave us were perfect - which is even more frustrating; if you have high standards for your food don't let yourself down by sending out anything that is sub-par.I'll keep going because the staff are typically really nice, I like the atmosphere and the food is great when it works out. If they sort out the consistency issues then I will happily re-rate as a 5-star.",3.0

"Ahh.... Where to begin......I've been on a recent BBQ binge. A friend put me onto Hometown in Red Hook, and I've been hooked ever since. I'm downtown with my wife and kids and decided to check out this spot.......BIG mistake. My waitress introduces herself and gets us drinks.... My wife asked for a sangria that was horrible.the bartender needs to be shot!!!! LolThen I ask the waitress for 2 cokes and a sprite. I call her and tell her the sodas don't taste anything like they should. She goes back to the bartender, who has the audacity to tell her the sodas tasted fine. I laughed in her face and told her to tell the bartender to check his tastebuds...On to the food.... The greens sucked, mash potatoes were sorry, and the cornbread tasted more like tortillas for tacos than cornbread.  I even ordered a baked potato that was so overcooked I could throw it and crack someone's head open.The brisket I got was on point and the Mac and cheese was decent. I will never go back to this place especially if someone is gonna tell me something is good when I know it's bad....This equals bad business in my book. Good riddance.....

"Walking around trying to find a random place in park slope and stumbled across Morgan's.  Didn't particularly want any meat (chicken or beef).  Started out with the catfish sliders.  They were tasty and filling.  You get 3 for $12.  My boyfriend had the sweet potato (with sage and brown sugar).  We shared the collard greens which were seasoned pretty good with garlic and red pepper.  I also ordered the ok school ""elbow room"" Mac .  It was ok.  Not impressed at all!  I guess I expected major flavor, cheese, and ""standout"" food from a bar-b-que place. My boyfriend was happy with his chili that he had, so he ordered a side order to go. My boyfriend and I ordered Malbac which was very ""average"".  Giving a fair 3 stars as I'm sure the bar-b-que and beer are great here!!  Bill was $70.00 and the service was average to below......",3.0
"Two stars based only on the food. The service was atrocious.A friend called me today and said he was eating at Morgan's. I have been there before so I thought ""sure why not"". I grab my daughter and head over. As I'm walking up the special board in front of the store states ""$6 Brisket sandwich"". It says nothing else. I sit down and order a ""Brisket Sandwich"". Upon receiving my meal I get a sandwich that is nice and does the job. Nothing amazing but nothing terrible. We had two infants in our group so we hastily ask for a check in case we need to leave quickly. Upon inspection of the check my $6 sandwich was now $13. When the server comes over I ask her why my sandwich was $13 and her response without excuse or explanation is that I ordered the sliced brisket sandwich. Now I know I just asked for a ""brisket"" sandwich and I was not questioned whether it was sliced or chopped. The server Alanna, was clueless and aloof. No manager approached me and offered an explanation. While the food was fine to begin with, my $6 sandwich went from a good deal to a ripoff because of how much it ended costing for what I got. On the whole it's overpriced and stuffy for being a ripoff of Texas bbq when in reality it's more Memphis.",2.0
EAT HERE AT YOUR OWN RISK!It's been 48 hours since I ate here and got food poisoning and I'm still weak and nauseous. I know Morgan's was to blame as it was the first and only thing I ate that day. I've spent 2 days over a toilet and lost a lot of money work wise - THANKS MORGANS!,1.0
"Because I'm from the Midwest, I usually avoid BBQ spots in NYC for fear of them not measuring up and leaving me disappointed. I must say after passing this spot numerous times I'm so happy my friend suggested we pop in yesterday. We made it just before the kitchen closed. I don't know what they did to the baked sweet potato I had but it was quite amazing. Amazing enough to make me want to eat it every day lol I also tried the chicken wings which were pretty awesome. Charred enough for flavor but not burnt tasting at all. I had a bit of my friend's Mac & cheese with bread crumbs, another pleasant surprise. Great variety at the bar and Justin, the bartender, was remarkable. I will definitely visit Morgan's more often since I am always in the neighborhood.

And don't put any sauce near it because as good as there sauce is (that is consistent at least!), they really don't need it. And I should also point out that this review doesn't include the Elbow Room that shares the site as all of the mac&cheeses from there have been delicious.There have been quite a few times recently when the meat has tasted obviously grilled and charred. I'm not sure if they do it to reheat the food, but one time it was so heavily charred that the ribs were inedible; even the cut edges of the ribs had grill marks on them meaning they were pre-cut and then grilled! We sent them back and the next set that they gave us were perfect - which is even more frustrating; if you have high standards for your food don't let yourself down by sending out anything that is sub-par.I'll keep going because the staff are typically really nice, I like the atmosphere and the food is great when it works out. If they sort out the consistency issues then I will happily re-rate as a 5-star.",3.0
I think it is the best BBQ in NYC. I've been to most bbq joints and Morgan's never disappoints. It's hard to get a table sometimes but definitely worth the wait.,5.0
"Ahh.... Where to begin......I've been on a recent BBQ binge. A friend put me onto Hometown in Red Hook, and I've been hooked ever since. I'm downtown with my wife and kids and decided to check out this spot.......BIG mistake. My waitress introduces herself and gets us drinks.... My wife asked for a sangria that was horrible.the bartender needs to be shot!!!! LolThen I ask the waitress for 2 cokes and a sprite. I call her and tell her the sodas don't taste anything like they should. She goes back to the bartender, who has the audacity to tell her the sodas tasted fine. I laughed in her face and told her to tell the bartender to check his tastebuds...On to the food.... The greens sucked, mash potatoes were sorry, and the cornbread tasted more like tortillas for tacos than cornbread.  I even ordered a baked potato that was so overcooked I could throw it and crack someone's head open.The brisket I got was on point and the Mac and cheese was decent. I will never go back to this place especially if someone is gonna tell me something is good when I know it's bad....This equals bad business in my book. Good riddance..... I'll stick to Hometown....",1.0
"Walking around trying to find a random place in park slope and stumbled across Morgan's.  Didn't particularly want any meat (chicken or beef).  Started out with the catfish sliders.  They were tasty and filling.  You get 3 for $12.  My boyfriend had the sweet potato (with sage and brown sugar).  We shared the collard greens which were seasoned pretty good with garlic and red pepper.  I also ordered the ok school ""elbow room"" Mac .  It was ok.  Not impressed at all!  I guess I expected major flavor, cheese, and ""standout"" food from a bar-b-que place. My boyfriend was happy with his chili that he had, so he ordered a side order to go. My boyfriend and I ordered Malbac which was very ""average"".  Giving a fair 3 stars as I'm sure the bar-b-que and beer are great here!!  Bill was $70.00 and the service was average to below......",3.0
"Two stars based only on the food. The service was atrocious.A friend called me today and said he was eating at Morgan's. I have been there before so I thought ""sure why not"". I grab my daughter and head over. As I'm walking up the special board in front of the store states ""$6 Brisket sandwich"". It says nothing else. I sit down and order a ""Brisket Sandwich"". Upon receiving my meal I get a sandwich that is nice and does the job. Nothing amazing but nothing terrible. We had two infants in our group so we hastily ask for a check in case we need to leave quickly. Upon inspection of the check my $6 sandwich was now $13. When the server comes over I ask her why my sandwich was $13 and her response without excuse or explanation is that I ordered the sliced brisket sandwich. Now I know I just asked for a ""brisket"" sandwich and I was not questioned whether it was sliced or chopped. The server Alanna, was clueless and aloof. No manager approached me and offered an explanation. While the food was fine to begin with, my $6 sandwich went from a good deal to a ripoff because of how much it ended costing for what I got. On the whole it's overpriced and stuffy for being a ripoff of Texas bbq when in reality it's more Memphis.",2.0
EAT HERE AT YOUR OWN RISK!It's been 48 hours since I ate here and got food poisoning and I'm still weak and nauseous. I know Morgan's was to blame as it was the first and only thing I ate that day. I've spent 2 days over a toilet and lost a lot of money work wise - THANKS MORGANS!,1.0
"Because I'm from the Midwest, I usually avoid BBQ spots in NYC for fear of them not measuring up and leaving me disappointed. I must say after passing this spot numerous times I'm so happy my friend suggested we pop in yesterday. We made it just before the kitchen closed. I don't know what they did to the baked sweet potato I had but it was quite amazing. Amazing enough to make me want to eat it every day lol I also tried the chicken wings which were pretty awesome. Charred enough for flavor but not burnt tasting at all. I had a bit of my friend's Mac & cheese with bread crumbs, another pleasant surprise. Great variety at the bar and Justin, the bartender, was remarkable. I will definitely visit Morgan's more often since I am always in the neighborhood. It's always exciting when expectations are exceeded!!!",5.0
"I don't know or see what the fuss is about...The ribs are ok at best but nor magnificent as some of you guys on here state. Made me waste my money and time...sheeeeesssshhhhh...First off, the ribs were lacking flavor by itself. It was tender but something was missing. Secondly, I did NOT appreciate that spicy sauce. It overwhelmed everythinggggggg.....I have no problem with spicy but this was just too much. I could not even enjoy my dang food. It was horrible. That goes for the greens too...spicy as hell. The mac and cheese was good....Maybe I was there on an off day or perhaps, their were other options of sauce...don't know but I was less than impressed. sorry. I know this is not soul food per se but maybe I am used to the soul food style of ribs. IDK...The service was fast and good but I don't think I will be coming back...",3.0
"Tried the ribs, fatty brisket, wings, mac and cheese (fancy one not the regular one :)), collard greens and the key lime pie. Calm down I shared everything that was ordered.

Be prepared for the black pepper overload but all the meat is cooked to perfection.

"I was going to give two stars, but I just can't do it.  There is no excuse for being given a menu with a price on it that is refused.  I ordered a pulled pork sandwich that came with a side for $10.50.  That seemed like a decent deal.  I placed my order, he wrote it down, and everything seemed fine.  After a long pause, something clicked in his head and he told me that my sandwich didn't come with a side because ""it's Memorial Day, so we're treating today as a brunch day.""  Apparently when there is brunch, prices skyrocket.  So, the side that is normally included became $5.  I wouldn't even have much problem with the prices going up (even though it is nearly a 50% price increase!), but when you give me a menu with a price, I expect you to honor it.I do have to admit the food wasn't too bad.  Well, mine wasn't.  My sandwich had good flavor, even though it was way fattier than it should have been (even for a relatively fatty sandwich).  My friend's meal looked awful, though (and she said it tasted like it looked).  She had poorly cooked eggs with two strips of sad-looking bacon, and bland, runny grits.  The bacon and eggs are probably outside their area of expertise, but the grits shouldn't be.  And if anything is outside your expertise, you shouldn't have it on the menu.Don't eat here, please.  They don't deserve it.",1.0
"Second time coming here. First time I had the beef sandwich (on special too at 6 bucks can't beat it), chips with smoky queso and old school Mac and agua fresca.  The sandwich was basically bbq'd beef pieces with coleslaw in a potato bun. It was delish though I think they could've put a liiiiitle more beef to balance the slaw which was good; tangy and not too saucy. I also loved the chips and smoky queso; two cheese blend with chopped onions, tomatoes,  peppers and cilantro on top. Loved the Old School mac; creamy with garlic breadcrumbs on top. The agua was alright but didn't wow me. It had spiced rum and pineapple and lemon juice. Second time around I had buttermilk biscuit, smoky wings, candied bacon and Texas two step. The biscuit was... interesting. It was soft, fluffy but a little tough if that makes sense. It also had chives and other herbs baked in. Not the buttermilk biscuit I'm used to. Wished it came with butter and honey on the side to rid the dryness a bit. The wings were crispy, little charred on some places. It came with blue cheese sauce and buffalo sauce and two celery sticks. It was, but not memorable. I wished it came cooked with the buffalo sauce instead on the side because it was a little dry. The Texas two step is supposed to be bourbon and sweet tea when lemon garnish on ice but I pretty much just tasted bourbon on ice. Then there was the candied bacon. I mean it was bacon. Cooked in brown sugar reduction. What's not to love?The service was great. Both times the servers were nice and attentive. Food was hit and miss.",3.0

"First trip here. Overall, a very good experience.I love the industrial feel of these kinds of places, and coupled with a large outdoor front patio, I immediately knew this was my kind of joint. In terms of the barbecue, these guys hail from Austin, Texas -- probably one of my favorite parts of the country when it comes to producing incredible BBQ meats. When trying BBQ for the first time, I typically measure my initial experience by the quality of their pulled pork sandwich. And for that, Morgan's might just be a 5-star experience. The pork truly melts in your mouth and is so wonderfully seasoned, you just can't stop eating it. And unlike many BBQ joints, the pulled pork here is not dressed with any sauce. Instead, you add in all the sauce you want, courtesy of the plastic squeeze bottles located at each table. The sauce here is excellent too -- it's very thin and vinegary, with a really nice spicy bite. That's the way (uh-huh, uh-huh) I like it.Less impressive was a side cup of corn tossed with cayenne and cojita cheese. The corn was overcooked, and despite a heavy dressing of cheese and seasoning was quite bland. This dish really only works when you grill the corn over a fire and get a nice char, and then serve it on the cob with mayo, cojita, and cayenne.

I've been to Texas many times and I've had some great bbq but this place can hold its own with the best of them. The brisket as tender and flavorful and the candied bacon was amazing and creamed corn is a must have side. Next time I'm in NY I'm going.,5.0

"First trip here. Overall, a very good experience.I love the industrial feel of these kinds of places, and coupled with a large outdoor front patio, I immediately knew this was my kind of joint. In terms of the barbecue, these guys hail from Austin, Texas -- probably one of my favorite parts of the country when it comes to producing incredible BBQ meats. When trying BBQ for the first time, I typically measure my initial experience by the quality of their pulled pork sandwich. And for that, Morgan's might just be a 5-star experience. The pork truly melts in your mouth and is so wonderfully seasoned, you just can't stop eating it. And unlike many BBQ joints, the pulled pork here is not dressed with any sauce. Instead, you add in all the sauce you want, courtesy of the plastic squeeze bottles located at each table. The sauce here is excellent too -- it's very thin and vinegary, with a really nice spicy bite. That's the way (uh-huh, uh-huh) I like it.Less impressive was a side cup of corn tossed with cayenne and cojita cheese. The corn was overcooked, and despite a heavy dressing of cheese and seasoning was quite bland. This dish really only works when you grill the corn over a fire and get a nice char, and then serve it on the cob with mayo, cojita, and cayenne. Mexican restaurants have a lock on this dish.We also had to try the mac and cheese, given that they have a whole side business dedicated to that cheesy noodle goodness we've all come to love. Unfortunately, we screwed up by not ordering the simple, classic version, and instead trying their buffalo chicken mac and cheese. This was a real rookie mistake on our part.

"A friend and I have been looking forward to trying this place for a while and we finally set a date. They have a great location on Flatbush and St. Marks with more space for tables than expected and an outdoor seating area when the weather is better.I have to preface this part of the review with the fact that my friend is a chef and therefore pretty particular. She found the brisket to be overly black-peppery, with large chunks that she had to chew through, so much so that she had to order something else. I agree that it was heavy on the pepper, but for me, the meat itself was delicious. Take our waitresses advice and get the fatty brisket - it is much juicier! My friend did however rave about the collared greens.I ordered the pork ribs which were large and tender - very happy with the selection and also the cheeseburger mac. All of our mac selections, we ordered the mushroom and buffalo as well, were unique and comfortingly delicious!Our table shared a chips and cheese with pulled pork and a slice of their cornbread, both of which were winners for all.Overall, I would definitely come here again. It may not have been the best BBQ I have ever tasted, but it was right up there and the mac was a brilliant touch!",4.0
"Loved the gigantic beef rib. It was a juicy tender short rib that I didn't want to share. The rub used is a touch spicy but so good with the fat from the rib. I know everyone loves the moist brisket here, and man it was mighty flavorful but I was very surprised that the brisket wasn't really fatty. Maybe I'm just used to hillcountry's overly fatty brisket.  The cornbread with peppers and honey butter is a must have. Mac and cheese, as well as the beans were ok, but clearly not the star of dinner (for me at least). I came on a Sat night, and found the service to be incredibly friendly but the hostess hard to find. Then I realized she was doubling as waitservice. For a place this busy, they should have a dedicated hostess.Overall, a fantastic very affordable and delicious bbq. Sorry hillcountry, I think I have a new bbq love.",4.0
"During a moment of self-loathing, anger, and having a sad pity party I didn't want to do anything at all for my birthday. Which was over a month ago so this review is way over due. I was persuaded at the last second into getting dinner with a few good friends. I didn't actually pick the place but I said Brooklyn and I had this place bookmarked for awhile. Also, barbeque at the end of the summer is always a swell idea. The whiskey and bourbon selection here is fantastic. Beer choice not so much and it is over-priced. The cocktail menu is also kind of lame. Wasn't the biggest fan of their gin based drink with the muddled blueberries. The gin had an over-whelming bitter taste and ""good gin"" shouldn't do that. It should taste like liquid gold. The second drink I had was the Texas sweet tea with bourbon and it was substantially better but tasted just like alcoholic sweet tea in a mason jar. Their cocktails are priced around $9-11. You could be enjoying a good glass of Widow Jane or Buffalo Trace with your meat instead, so do that.The good parts about this place is that I love that it is conjoined with The Elbow Room. The macaroni and cheese here is pretty tasty and very share-able. We ordered a couple different versions. I only tried the Mushroom Mac with crimini mushrooms, spinach, and gruyere cheese. It was very creamy, the wilted spinach and decadent mushrooms with perfect shaped elbow noodles encasing all of that cheese.The only complaints with this may be with that I'm not partial to having an enormous amount of breadcrumbs crunched on top. Others feasted on Margherita Mac with San Marzano tomatoes, mozzarella, and fresh basil. This was noted as not being cheesy enough or as good as hoped for. The Old School Mac with NY State Sharp Cheddar, béchamel, and garlic breadcrumbs. - Good, but not the best macaroni ever had.For meats I had the sliced brisket sandwich with a side of cornbread. What I don't like about dining here on the weekends is that a side costs you extra as opposed to weekdays when it is free. LAME. The coleslaw was basic. The brisket even though it was a fresh new batch that we waited an extra 20 minutes for before ordering, since the kind waiters happened to mention they were making a fresh new batch up, wasn't the best quality that I've ever had. Some people complained that the dry rub was extraordinarily spicy. Spicy in the sense of way too much black pepper and seasonings. Not burn my face off heat spicy. I was in the middle on it but agree that less on the rub could have been so much more. The best meat I did happen to sample a small bite of thanks to my buddy Anton and his friends was the GINORMOUS BEEF RIB. I say that because that is the best meat on this menu hands down and you should order it immediately. Between the two of them they ordered two orders of it so I did not feel guilty in the slightest in taking this extra morsel of fatty delicious fall off the bone meat. I never knew in my life that rib meat could be made of not pork and still taste mind blowing. The cornbread lastly was quality with little nuggets of diced up bell pepper and had a hint of sweetness. Finished the meal with an obligatory and embarrassing 'happy birthday brownie' that got passed around. It was okay. But I'd skip on ordering desert here. Overall, decent bbq that could use a few fine tweaks to make it perfect. The Elbow Room definitely helps this place out a bunch with upping its star rating though.",4.0
"I know yelping is a cliche but... Went here for the first time and had an awesome experience. There was a line out the door so I was initially put off a bit but if there's a crown, it must be good. So I went in and promptly got seated at the bar. The beer was nice and cold in the mason jars. I got the pork tacos which were awesome. So was the side of Mac and cheese. Highly recommended. The bartender was awesome and what really gave this place 5 stars. She figured out I was new in town and told me about a few other hot spots around town. Really nice touch and as someone who doesn't really know anyone, I'm very appreciative.",5.0

"I'm a little hard on this place. My thing is when I go out I expect the food to be better than my own. As an amateur barbecue chef Im going to be more critical than the average person. If The words ""bark, smoke ring, or pull"" dont mean anything to you, you may want to disregard my review. In short, this is a barbecue place for someone who doesn't know good good barbecue. The only thing that keeps this from being a 1-star review is the jerk Mac n cheese which wasn't that bad.We rate everything in our household 1-10.Pulled pork. Dry. Inexcusably dry. They put the ""pull"" in the pulled pork. Too much seasoning on the outside. I get the feeling they may cook the food in an oven then throw it in a grill to finish it. That's an acceptable technique if you can make it work. They don't. I'd prefer lloyd's packaged pulled pork container. 1/10Fatty brisket. Once again over seasoned outside but no bark. Minimal smoke ring. It tasted more like pastrami than true smoked brisket. Maybe that's the technique they used? Nevertheless, not true Texas brisket. 4/10Coleslaw. Not very good. Fresh onions in coleslaw? Your coleslaw should go well with your brisket. It didn't. And it didn't stand on its own merit. 3/10Jerk Mac n cheese. This was actually pretty good. I'm happy we got it else we would have had to stop somewhere else for food after. Didn't taste very much like jerk(what do you expect in a bbq place) but it was good nonetheless. 8/10Ice cream sandwich. Cookies were borderline burnt and not much ice cream. My wife commented that she prefers ""Potbelly's"" ice cream sandwiches. 4/10In conclusion, I've had better bbq in a Parking lot food truck for half the price. Will not return.",2.0
"Here's the deal. If you want ribs, this is the place to go. Heads up though, if you don't want a super casual atmosphere, then this is not the place for you.

"It was a pleasure to be able to eat some really solid barbecue in Brooklyn without having to go to Williamsburg and wait on lines and sit in a barn and eat with hipsters.It was a little troubling to see how empty this place was on a Saturday afternoon, but all the better for me. We had the whole beautiful outdoor seating area to ourselves, which is great on a nice, sunny day.They have a great menu, with all of the staples you would expect from a respectable barbecue joint. They sell several different kinds of meat by the pound, as well as sandwiches, which come with a side during lunch time (11 AM - 5 PM) for a great deal. One of the differences here from a lot of the other places is that they have a huge menu of sides - they have all of the ones you normally see (baked beans, potato salad, collard greens, mac & cheese, etc.), as well as some very different ones, such as the Soft Tacos and the Stuffed Baked Potatoes (which you can stuff with brisket or pulled pork, which sounds amazing).We got the Lean Brisket ($20 per pound) and the Pork Ribs ($12 per pound). The brisket was pretty tasty, but still pretty fatty for lean, but the Ribs were really really great. So meaty and they completely fell off the bone. We also got the Pulled Pork Sandwich was not so great ($10.50). It felt like the guy pulling the pork got lazy and didn't pull it enough - it was more like large hunks of pork that were mostly bland. For the side with that we went with the Potato Salad, which was of the variety that is completely smothered in sauce, so a bit overwhelming.I also wanted to try the Mac & Cheese, until I realized that there is an Elbow Room walk-up window next door, so I got a huge tub of one of the specialty mac & cheeses from there for a delicious side (yelp.com/biz/elbow-room-…). It's a perfect location to be right next to a barbecue joint, though it must be cannibalizing their mac & cheese sales here.This is a really solid option if you want some good barbecue and can't deal with going to Williamsburg for most of the other great options, or the wait is too long at the closer location of Dinosaur BBQ. I will definitely be back to try some of the other meats and to try some of the pie for dessert.",4.0

I had brisket at Mighty Quinn's and thought all brisket is that succulent...not the case. The waitress never came to ask how my food was. I had to flag her down for a second glass of wine. I asked her if the brisket was supposed to be cold and she told me no. She went to the kitchen. And came back telling me that perhaps it was cold because of the coleslaw on top. She didn't offer to reheat my food. She only said 'sorry' and that was her resolution. I flagged her down for the check as well (she never checked on me, except to take my food away when it was HALF eaten). She charged me $13 for the brisket which shows for less online and $10 each for a glass of wine which I also believe was less. I just wanted to get out of there so I didn't bother checking the prices until I got home (my mistake). I will say the bartender was very nice but everything else makes me decide this will not be a place I will return to. Bit of advice - fire your waitress from 11/19/15 1pm. The cold food could have been easily rectified had there been a competent waitress that gave a darn.",1.0
"I've been to several bbq restaurants throughout NYC.  Morgan's is definitely one of my favorite places. Delicious ribs, mouth watering chicken, and sinfully good Mac n cheese. To finish a plentiful dinner, the warm chocolate brownie is worth the calories! The staff is attentive and warm.",5.0
"This place is amazing. Great drinks, BEST barbeque I have ever had in my life, and great setup.  This was my second time here tonight, and my bf and I will be making this our #1 go to this summer, what with ample outdoor benches and all. The only reason I could ever think about giving it a star less would be for the amount of children and oblivious parents all over, but this is the neighborhood, and there's nothing the restaurant can do about the general population. Also, the hostess was a little drunk (saw her taking shots) and she kept ramming into us(propped up at the bar as far in as our seats could go) every time she passed us. I work in a pretty tiny restaurant though, so I could kind of understand either way. Everything else, especially foodwise, on their end is perfect.

My dish sat there getting cold while we waited a really long time for my husbands. It's eggs, not rocket science, I'm pretty sure they can figure out the timing better on this. I will also add it was empty for brunch so there was no good reason for the delay. My meal was cold so I sent it back. They make me a new one and the eggs are runny and undercooked.

"Been a few more times left disappointed. Maybe it's just been bad timing, but consider this some tough love. Some recent and recurring issues...-The portions have been inconsistent. Sometimes the sandwich is heaving with meat and it makes me happy. Other times, it's mostly bread and slaw.-Meat is either over salted or over peppered. It's like one shaker or the other is missing back there. Couple of times the meat's been on the dry side.-Sides lack personality. That's part of the fun of bbq is putting your own spin on things, but here it's like you order mac 'n cheese, you get mac 'n cheese. You order greens, you get greens. All at that bare minimum.-Lately it's been chaotic to try to get a table. Host/ess isn't always easy to spot and the wait area gets congested, probably to the annoyance of seated patrons.

Both mac & cheeses were delish.So we tried Morgan's again and hit timing just right. Waits can be long on weekends/brunch hours.

I don't think I can eat BBQ anywhere else after coming here. The fatty brisket was on point and the star of our meal. The meat was super tender and the luscious fat melts away in your mouth like butter. Just reminiscing is making me salivate.

Out of the beef rib which sucked, but I can respect because they don't over order and waste food. So we had brisket, smoked wings and pork ribs. All really succulent but too much salt on the on the ribs. Just a touch too much, brisket a little too peppery, little bit. Smoked wings were amazing.

Definitely reasonably price. Make sure you let the server explain to you how it works because I went there and had a late lunch with a friend.

The brisket was tasteful and had enough flavor. Make sure to put someBBQ sauce it makes it taste even better.

"Morgans is def one of my fave places to eat when i am in the mood for hearty food and have a craving for mac n cheese and bourbon, a weird combo? Maybe a little. What i like the most is that they have vegan mac n cheese thats even tastier than the dairy version. I dont eat meat and I shouldn't eat dairy so I really appreciate this option. The portions are filling and the staff is super friendly. If you are an out-doorsie kinda person like i am, you will also appreciate the outdoor seating.

"Easily the best BBQ I've had in the 5 boroughs.We were a table of 4, and we split a number of the large sides--collards, cole slaw, and corn, all of which were delicious.  I'm a cole slaw fanatic, and their slaw was fresh and crunchy, not soupy.  The collards were spicy and sweet all at once, and the corn had cotija cheese magic all over it.We also shared two of the Elbow Room mac & cheese options--the Buffalo, and the Tingha.  The Buffalo won everyone's heart for sure, but the Tingha was really yummy too.I shared a pork link (nice snap to it) and pork ribs (fall-off-the-bone tender) with my husband, and though I could only eat a bit of each because of how rich it all was, it was totally top notch.  I had a bite of his brisket as well, and it was probably the best brisket I've ever had.  Full stop.The service was lovely, too, which was a delightful departure from the usual brusqueness I'm accustomed to as a Brooklynite.  The bartender entertained us with drinks and comfortable chat when the first two of us arrived.  Then, when #3 got there, they showed us to our table ...gasp... BEFORE our entire party arrived ... and it wasn't a problem or big deal to them.  Our waitress even came around when happy hour was ending to see if we wanted one last special before the time was up.  Bourbon-pecan pie?  Check.Meat sweats after?  Check.Sweet, sweet, meaty dreams all night?  Check and check.",5.0
"Visited one night a bit late right before they were ready to close. My boyfriend and I really enjoyed the brisket and Mac and cheese. We also had some drinks which were pretty strong, maybe before closing the  bartenders are a little more generous. I wouldn't mind visiting again to try some other things on the menu. I think the baked sweet potato was my least favorite.",3.0
"I'm so sorry to say it, but this place is really nothing special. I was so excited to have a barbecue place that's a block away from me, but I've come here 4 times already and still have not been wowed. The meat is typically dry and all you can taste when eating the tacos is spice. The only good thing about this place is that you can order from the elbow room next-door and have it delivered with your meal. Sadly, I've heard that the mac & cheese is not so great either.Skip this place and go to Dinosaur BBQ instead.",2.0
"First of all, let me just say that the reason I didn't give Morgan's 5 stars is because I've only been there once and haven't tried everything yet. But if everything else on the menu compares with what I had on my first visit, it will definitely warrant a 5-star rating.Generally, most bbq joints seem to focus their energies on one or 2 products (with various grades of success) and miss on others, be it the brisket, ribs, mac & chee, what have you. Altogether, we tried the brisket, pork ribs, traditional macaroni & cheese, cornbread, collard greens, and the pecan pie a la mode. Everything was superlative! The ribs may very well have been the best I've tasted north of the Mason-Dixon line. Just the right amount of flavor from the rub and smokiness. And a perfect texture and chew. The brisket (you can order fatty or lean; who orders lean?) was moist and flavorful. And the sides were all great.I've been to other really good bar-b-q joints before (Hill Country - the one in the city -, Hometown, etc) but have never had such consistent quality across the board before.As I've said, if this holds up with the rest of the menu, it's a definite 5-star jernt.",4.0

"Food quality: good. I'm originally from the South and quality-wise, I think this place could actually survive and do well in bbq country. The brisket is very moist, ribs were tender and came off the bone with some ease. The corn bread with pepper jelly also stands out. The main problem with this place, and why I probably won't go again, is that it's just way to expensive for the small portions. I came with a group of 6, and when they set down our food in those tiny little paper trays, it was just the saddest thing I'd ever seen. Also, the sides come in two sizes, and the larger one was termed ""for the neighborhood."" Since we had a group, we obviously opted for that size. My memory might be failing me, but it came in a cup the size of a small cup of ice cream. Definitely felt a bit sacrilegious for a place that flies the TX flag in front.  If you want to try BBQ in Brooklyn, Dino's is not far away and personally, I think it's a far superior choice.",3.0
"100 check ins. It is hard to say what's best about this place. The people here have been so amazingly kind and friendly. The owners Chris and Joel are ever present, kind, generous, courteous, and everything in between. There are people who work here I would gladly call friends, simply because they always took time to care, and talk and build relationships. Besides that the food here is just on another level. The Frito pie here is truly a gem. Definitely an appetizer for one, but simply amazing. They have a SWEET BAKED potato that is beyond this world, and add some pulled pork to that bad boy and it's just appetizer heaven. Their Mac and cheese are spectacular. They have different kinds but even just their regular Mac is amazing. But this is a BBQ spot. what you need to have here is the brisket and pulled pork. To die for, I promise",5.0
I'm not a fan of pork but the fries was really good and the drink similar to a mojito was good didn't like the sangria. Wonderful atmosphere and I like the outside dinning. Would go back to try a few things.. Also sexy servers..(girls),4.0
"Ultimately, I just wanted to drink with friends so I had fun. They have an okay craft beer selection. Ithaca flower power was the best thing on tap when I went. The food was really, really mediocre. I had to send back the biscuits and gravy. It was presented terribly and was really depressing looking for 9$. I wish i had snapped a picture. Two dry biscuits, with an incredibly small amount of gravy. I would guess about 3 tbsps, that's it. It looked like the plate had been almost dropped because the little bit on there was spilling over the side of the plate. Every time I've ever had biscuits and gravy the gravy fills the plate or bowl. Its almost like soup. This gravy was little more than a garnish. I would have eaten it anyway, but the biscuits weren't even warm, so I was able to send it back and get mac and cheese instead.Even the mac and cheese (mushroom) was okay, not amazing. I would never come back here for the food. Only for the outdoor seating. They seem to know that they don't need to try that hard because its a great summer location.

"There really and truly is no better barbecue place in NYC.  If my opinion changes, I will gladly update this review (because it would mean I found more awesome barbecue).  But let me be clear:  Mighty Quinn's, Hill Country, Dino -- all fine and dandy, but Morgan's is on another level.The fatty brisket is probably the best brisket I have had anywhere, period.  Perfectly moist and full of beef flavor without being overwhelmingly fatty.  Beef sausage: up there with some of the best places you can find in Texas.  The pulled pork is just right too, peppery and salty (which seems to be their approach to barbecue in general, lay on good quality salt and pepper to cook, and let the customer handle the saucing.)  If there's a weakness it might be the ribs -- but I'm not a huge rib guy anyway, so I'll let it slide.And ohhhh the sides.  I could eat the roasted corn with cheese and lime every day.  Add in great smoky pintos and collards, and you have a complete meal.

The Mac and cheese left much to be desired, though. There's a full bar in the front, but the drink menu they gave us was very limited.

"This will be my new go to before events at Barclays from now on. Happy hour runs until 7 and includes $4 beer, $6 chopped beef sandwiches, and $2 tacos. I believe they also mad have had a special on quesso. The chopped beef sandwich was a decent size with a good amount of meat on it alone with some coleslaw. The meat was very good though a little tough, some BBQ sauce helped add to the flavor. I went with the pulled pork taco which was also very good, it didn't seem to need anything. It's solid BBQ, it's not the best I've had but it's miles above the crap like Dallas BBQ and better than Hill Country. They have a couple decent beers on tap  and our waitress was very friendly.

I came around 1pm, so it wasn't busy even thought it was lunch time so I decided to sit outside. Only one server for outside and 2 other customers were outside with me, kind of took her a minute to get my order. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich with the regular mac and cheese. The sandwich was pretty good. Had just enough kick but wasn't too spicy. Loved how they topped it with cole slaw. The Mac and cheese was ok...I grew up in a southern household so I'm kind of particular about my Mac and cheese...it was a little too milky for me, but the topping of breadcrumbs was pretty good. Even though it was the middle of the day, their drink menu was pretty interesting so I decided to try the strawberry lemonade blah blah (sorry I forgot what it's called!) it was made with some type of tequila that had a smoky flavoring to it. It's one of those fancy drinks where the first couple of sips are ok, but then it got kinda gross...the smoky flavoring got kind of annoying...lol. It's an ok place to go if you're just walking by, but I wouldn't go out of my way to check it out. Service was kind of slow, but the food was a little more than ok.",4.0

Then we found a bug in our pitcher of spiked lemonade. We had just poured out 3 glasses when we saw it and asked our waitress to replace it. I watched as her and another server poured most of that remaining pitcher into glasses, then had the bartender empty out the last 1/3 of the drink, refill the SAME pitcher with minimal alcohol, and fill it back up with what was poured out into the glasses by the servers. When they brought it back and I brought this to their attention, both the waitress and bartender got visibly annoyed. Sorry, but if I pay $45 for a pitcher and find a bug in it, the least you can do is actually replace the amount that was left with fresh drink. Not some mixture of bug-soaked old drink with a splash of watered down new, and a side of attitude. There are way too many places in the area to stand for service that poor.",2.0
I was really looking forward to eating here based on other reviews.Waitress was rushed and somewhat New York  apathetic/detached.  You'd expect some southern hospitality at a BBQ place  -  not the cold attitude you get at some NY upscale restaurants.  I think this is an important issue for restaurants.  Hate it when a waiter acts like they're doing you a favor by serving you.Brisket sandwich was SMALL but good. It was supposed to have cole slaw on it -  but there was none.  Ribs were good - though small portion also (didn't seem to be the half pound we ordered).   The corn/cojito cheese side was good but hardly any cogito cheese in it.  I saw a Kale salad at another table - looked huge - enough to feed a family of six!! Odd since other items at Morgan's are served as very small portions.Seating is tight inside.  Outer area was in use by a private party and the  view is of a dreary stretch of Flatbush avenue. Good music mix.,2.0
"Family's in town, got a bunch of mouths to feed.  Yelp says Morgan's delivers but Yelp is known to lie about such things so I call and ask, and they say yes, they deliver.  Great!  I'll call back with an order in 20 mins.  Great.Get the order together, call back, someone else answers the phone, ""Can I place an order for delivery?"". With an eye roll audible over the phone: ""Uh, we don't deliver"".  ""I just called 20 minutes ago and asked if you delivered, you said yes"".  ""It wasn't me who said that, we don't deliver"". ""Fine, someone else said you deliver"". ""Just a sec"" Line goes quiet, comes back on, attitude as if I should be grateful she bothered to not just hang up: ""Yeah, we're not going to deliver"". No apology for the misunderstanding, no offer to take a carry-out order, nothing.  I'm the jerk for still being on the phone.Not delivering is fine.

"This will be my new go to before events at Barclays from now on. Happy hour runs until 7 and includes $4 beer, $6 chopped beef sandwiches, and $2 tacos. I believe they also mad have had a special on quesso. The chopped beef sandwich was a decent size with a good amount of meat on it alone with some coleslaw. The meat was very good though a little tough, some BBQ sauce helped add to the flavor. I went with the pulled pork taco which was also very good, it didn't seem to need anything. It's solid BBQ, it's not the best I've had but it's miles above the crap like Dallas BBQ and better than Hill Country. They have a couple decent beers on tap  and our waitress was very friendly. The food came out quickly and we were able to make the game on time.",4.0
"Came across this place just wandering around in Brooklyn on my way to work....apparently it was on a show for one of the best new places to eat (shrugs)....anyway, it was ok. I came around 1pm, so it wasn't busy even thought it was lunch time so I decided to sit outside. Only one server for outside and 2 other customers were outside with me, kind of took her a minute to get my order. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich with the regular mac and cheese. The sandwich was pretty good. Had just enough kick but wasn't too spicy. Loved how they topped it with cole slaw. The Mac and cheese was ok...I grew up in a southern household so I'm kind of particular about my Mac and cheese...it was a little too milky for me, but the topping of breadcrumbs was pretty good. Even though it was the middle of the day, their drink menu was pretty interesting so I decided to try the strawberry lemonade blah blah (sorry I forgot what it's called!) it was made with some type of tequila that had a smoky flavoring to it. It's one of those fancy drinks where the first couple of sips are ok, but then it got kinda gross...the smoky flavoring got kind of annoying...lol. It's an ok place to go if you're just walking by, but I wouldn't go out of my way to check it out. Service was kind of slow, but the food was a little more than ok.",4.0

"Four and a half very high. Pretty certain this is currently the BEST BBQ you can find in NYC.  Stopped in once a few weeks after it first opened in September and was disappointed to find they were awaiting their liquor license and were not permitted to  allow BYOB either.  We toughed it out nonetheless, and I was impressed by the food.  Went back again last weekend when the full bar was in full swing during a Texas college football game,  and was considerably more impressed.  Everything was excellent all around when it came to the meats.  Of particular note was the succulent and moist turkey, a rarity in NYC BBQ spots to say the least, the fine pork ribs and pulled pork, usually reliably the most underwhelming option at a BBQ place for me, in this case quite good and not dried out.  The star of the show however for me was without a doubt the brisket, particularly the fatty, which was astonishingly good.  Its infused with a wondrous deep smokiness, and melts in your mouth.  It is better than Brisket-town's version, my former NYC brisket benchmark, by a considerable margin.   As I mentioned the scene was quite boisterous to say the least, in large part due to the college game but enhanced even more so by the high energy staff whose antics verged on theatrics, in an entertaining way.    The food was so good that the friend I dined with and I returned during the week for lunch and got the brisket and pulled pork tacos, served in the traditional Austin style on soft flour tortillas with Tex-Mex fixings.  They were uniformly excellent as well.  The scene was decidedly mellower this time and we were lucky enough to meet the pit master who proved to be a great guy who along with another Texan staffer gave me some valuable advice on which establishments I cannot miss, and which I should skip on my upcoming trip down to Austin.  The place is fantastic and judging from my twice in a week visits here this week, quite dangerous for me to have this close to my apartment.",5.0
"Welcome to the hood! Quick, quality food with friendly staff. We got the brisket and pork ribs with collars greens and roasted beans sides.

"So I don't eat meat (but why did you go here?)...my friend from the south was visiting so I had to take her to BBQ plus the outdoor seating made it a definite yes.I already made the decision to order a ton of sides, which is totally okay with me because BBQ sides are some of the most amazing things ever. Then the caesar kale salad caught my eye with HOMEMADE CROUTONS, I was sold. I got the salad and a side of mac and cheese which was to die for. The mac and cheese is how any mac and cheese should be made...flavorful and toasty bread crumbs on top. The righteous way and the only way to make mac and cheese.My friend got the mac and cheese as well with the brisket sandwich. She didn't complain one bit. We both ordered the mint juleps which were tiny but tasty and STRONG. Perfect for a spring day and well priced! $5 each!The only reason there were 4 not 5 stars is because of the service. It was a bit slow...people who sat down after us were served before us - but we weren't in any real rush, just something noticed.Regardless, I'll be back...maybe for the collard green salad and another tasty side...or I'll be there for brunch, glanced at that menu and everything sounded good.",4.0

"I don't often write restaurant reviews, but my experience last night at Morgan's was so good that it motivated me to join Yelp to write this review We took my entire family here, all 17 of us, for dinner before the Nets game last night.  As a long-time BBQ enthusiast, I was skeptical that I'd find decent BBQ in Brooklyn, but the yelp reviews and the proximity to the Barclays Center convinced me to give it a try.  There is only one word for for the meal we had last night, and that is ""spectacular"".  The dry beef and pork ribs were out of this world, the chicken tender and juicy, and the Okra and corn-bread are amazing.  Oh, and the Mac and cheese (something like 6 different varieties) is without question the best Mac and cheese I've ever had. The deserts brought tears to my eyes. And to top it all off, the staff all have the most beautiful smiles, are friendly, attentive and fast.If you are a BBQ fan, anywhere in the US, you owe it to yourself to plan a visit to Brooklyn for some of the best BBQ you will find anywhere.If you are headed to the Barclays Center for a concert or a game, you're cheating yourself if you don't go to Morgan's for dinner first.I cannot wait to go back.",5.0
"Fatty brisket is fantastic, but two missing cogs: 1) Morgan's sauce doesn't offer much, if anything, to the brisket. Granted, the brisket is solid as is, but would be even better if it had a touch of Fette Sau's sauce on top. 2) Another vegetable side offering would take this to the next level.

"If you're looking for authentic Texas BBQ this place is it! I'm from Austin, TX home of Rudy's BBQ and The Saltlick. I've been dying for some good BBQ in NYC. You'll meet other Texans in there too. It was great to hear and be a part of a normal Texas conversation again. The staff is friendly. Love the atmosphere inside and great to have the patio tables outside. Great variety of food. Gave it 4 out of 5 stars because it's super pricey. The moist brisket is $24 per lb! In Texas it's like $11. But I got it anyways and it was worth it.",4.0
"Only reason it even gets two stars is for the beautiful venue and wide array of mac and cheese flavors. From there it all goes downhillSo i went and had by far the worst service ive recievef at any downtown brookly bar/ resturant.

I then purchased a pitcher believing his judgement ... And well .. Yeah it was horrible. I then asked for some lemonade to mix with this horrific pitcher and was told that ""simple sugar solution was added for taste"". As we watvhed the bartender and another waitress group together and point and laugh n conversation about our table. All we did was look and smile ... It really made you not want to spend your moneyIt tasted a little better after this....very little.We then ordered the 3 eggs bacon and grits meal.

Well whatever, the waiter messed up the order but i ate it simply to avoid more horrible interactions.Finally ....

"I really love the ambiance of this place. Very casual and cozy, almost like being at a family barbecue. I ordered some Mac and cheese and it was pretty average. The brisket however was juicy,tender, and succulent. I would definitely go again, but will probably pass on the Mac and cheese",3.0
"When it comes to the criteria for favorite spots in summer, you're looking for outdoor seating and a menu with good refreshing drinks, and they do it well on both counts: big wooden benches make it way more likely you'll be able to grab a table than other places nearby (although that gets trickier around dinner time on nice nights, as you'd expect), plus they offer a good beer list and huge pitchers of laid-back summery cocktails based on lemonades and sweet tea.Barbecue is a contentious issue (and it seems like some people can rhapsodize for hours about beans in chili and whether you can taste whether something's been hickory-smoked, not to mention the Memphis-style vs. Kansas City-style vs. Texas-style debates), but the food itself is pretty dynamite. A couple of quick suggestions:- You can always ask for white bread on the side, and it comes free. If you're eating with friends or on a date, skip ordering five sandwiches and instead get some pulled pork and brisket, along with a couple of sides, and people can customize it themselves. (Way more fun, connotes much more of an outdoor barbecue feel--plus: cheaper.)- They'll ask you whether you want your brisket lean or fatty. This should go without saying: always opt for the fatty brisket. (The lean is even drier than you'd expect). - Order the chili as a side. It doesn't look as fun as the mac and cheese (and, I mean, you should order that, too), but at Morgan's, it genuinely makes for the best barbecue sauce you could imagine, especially since theirs does the job but isn't anything to write home about. Heap some of their chili on pulled pork and white bread, and you've got yourself a mouthful of heaven.All in all, this is the perfect neighborhood spot in summer for just about anything you can think of: boozy brunch with friends, fun casual date, happy hour with coworkers, or sitting out in the sunshine with a book.

"Four and a half very high. Pretty certain this is currently the BEST BBQ you can find in NYC.  Stopped in once a few weeks after it first opened in September and was disappointed to find they were awaiting their liquor license and were not permitted to  allow BYOB either.  We toughed it out nonetheless, and I was impressed by the food.  Went back again last weekend when the full bar was in full swing during a Texas college football game,  and was considerably more impressed.  Everything was excellent all around when it came to the meats.  Of particular note was the succulent and moist turkey, a rarity in NYC BBQ spots to say the least, the fine pork ribs and pulled pork, usually reliably the most underwhelming option at a BBQ place for me, in this case quite good and not dried out.  The star of the show however for me was without a doubt the brisket, particularly the fatty, which was astonishingly good.  Its infused with a wondrous deep smokiness, and melts in your mouth.  It is better than Brisket-town's version, my former NYC brisket benchmark, by a considerable margin.   As I mentioned the scene was quite boisterous to say the least, in large part due to the college game but enhanced even more so by the high energy staff whose antics verged on theatrics, in an entertaining way.    The food was so good that the friend I dined with and I returned during the week for lunch and got the brisket and pulled pork tacos, served in the traditional Austin style on soft flour tortillas with Tex-Mex fixings.  They were uniformly excellent as well.  The scene was decidedly mellower this time and we were lucky enough to meet the pit master who proved to be a great guy who along with another Texan staffer gave me some valuable advice on which establishments I cannot miss, and which I should skip on my upcoming trip down to Austin.  The place is fantastic and judging from my twice in a week visits here this week, quite dangerous for me to have this close to my apartment.",5.0
"Welcome to the hood! Quick, quality food with friendly staff. We got the brisket and pork ribs with collars greens and roasted beans sides. We also went rogue and ordered a tricked out Mac n cheese from Elbow Room. They are owned by the same people but the more fun offerings aren't on the menu. I'm pretty sure my BBQ obsessed beau will make me eat here weekly. Thank goodness for elastic  waistbands.",4.0
"So I don't eat meat (but why did you go here?)...my friend from the south was visiting so I had to take her to BBQ plus the outdoor seating made it a definite yes.I already made the decision to order a ton of sides, which is totally okay with me because BBQ sides are some of the most amazing things ever. Then the caesar kale salad caught my eye with HOMEMADE CROUTONS, I was sold. I got the salad and a side of mac and cheese which was to die for. The mac and cheese is how any mac and cheese should be made...flavorful and toasty bread crumbs on top. The righteous way and the only way to make mac and cheese.My friend got the mac and cheese as well with the brisket sandwich. She didn't complain one bit. We both ordered the mint juleps which were tiny but tasty and STRONG. Perfect for a spring day and well priced! $5 each!The only reason there were 4 not 5 stars is because of the service. It was a bit slow...people who sat down after us were served before us - but we weren't in any real rush, just something noticed.Regardless, I'll be back...maybe for the collard green salad and another tasty side...or I'll be there for brunch, glanced at that menu and everything sounded good.",4.0

"I don't often write restaurant reviews, but my experience last night at Morgan's was so good that it motivated me to join Yelp to write this review We took my entire family here, all 17 of us, for dinner before the Nets game last night.  As a long-time BBQ enthusiast, I was skeptical that I'd find decent BBQ in Brooklyn, but the yelp reviews and the proximity to the Barclays Center convinced me to give it a try.  There is only one word for for the meal we had last night, and that is ""spectacular"".  The dry beef and pork ribs were out of this world, the chicken tender and juicy, and the Okra and corn-bread are amazing.  Oh, and the Mac and cheese (something like 6 different varieties) is without question the best Mac and cheese I've ever had. The deserts brought tears to my eyes. And to top it all off, the staff all have the most beautiful smiles, are friendly, attentive and fast.If you are a BBQ fan, anywhere in the US, you owe it to yourself to plan a visit to Brooklyn for some of the best BBQ you will find anywhere.If you are headed to the Barclays Center for a concert or a game, you're cheating yourself if you don't go to Morgan's for dinner first.I cannot wait to go back.",5.0
"Fatty brisket is fantastic, but two missing cogs: 1) Morgan's sauce doesn't offer much, if anything, to the brisket.

I'm not much a of a BBQ aficianado but this place was pretty damn good to me.  Loved that the Elbow Room menu is integrated.  The mac n cheese at the Elbow Room is really good and a perfect, creamy compliment to the peppery bbq served up here.  For sides, we had the corn salad, which was awesome, the pinto beans were exceptional.  For meat we had the lean Brisket, peppery, dry and tasty, the Pulled Pork, my wife's favorite here, and some ribs which were also very peppers but very tasty.  The BBQ sauce they make is PERFECT as an accompaniment to the bbq flavors they use.The service was horrific.  Two hostesses who had no idea how long the wait was or where they could seat people. Seemingly an endless number of servers and bussers milling around without talking to patrons and mostly just drinking juice in the back with each other.  Took about 15 minutes to get waited on (I'm talking about getting water and anyone to say ""hi"").To avoid the horrendous service I would recommend sitting at the bar because the bartenders there work their asses off and, as a result, will give you good service.",3.0
"Went here on the Sunday of Memorial Day to sit at the bar and was greeted, or should I say not greeted, by the ""worlds worst bartender"" (a man with a huge beard) as he called himself.  After waiting for about 10 minutes and realizing the bartender did not care to make eye contact or acknowledge me I got up and asked the host for 2 menus. Only then did the bartender realize that we weren't the same people who were sitting there before. Simple enough mistake, I was willing to let it go.We asked what was better, pork or brisket and the bartender just walked away not saying anything and came back to tell us he had to try the brisket and said they were both good, very helpful thanks.  We ended up ordering the fatty brisket, pulled pork tacos and the Caribbean chicken mac and cheese (can't remember the official name of it) along with two drinks.  My boyfriend got his beer right away, after waiting about 15 minutes I finally asked about my cocktail and realized he just forgot about it.  The drink was strong and not very tasty, it was the whiskey and tea option, once again can't remember the exact name. In the mean time I tried to get water for us and that took awhile too.The food finally came and thank god... it was delicious!! The fatty brisket was full of flavor and their BBQ sauce is everything a girl could want.  The tacos were by far the best thing we ordered! The pulled pork with the guac and other toppings were PERFECT!! I could eat 10 of those in one sitting. The mac and cheese was hard to eat, the flavor profiles didn't really go well together and honestly it was hard to finish. Also important to note that this is all very messy and trying to get extra napkins from the bartender was like pulling teeth.It then took us FOREVER to get our check and by the time we left I was so angry with the service I almost forgot how good the food was.  If you go I would stay FAR away from the big bearded bartender, he really is the WORST bartender I have ever had.",3.0

Wow...so we visited Morgan's for my wife 45th birthday. We had read the reviews and decided to try it. We had the fatty brisket and the ribs with buffalo Mac n cheese along with the Cole slaw. The ribs were the most tender ribs I ever had! The buffalo mac n cheese had Frank's hot sauce on the top which made it hot. We enjoyed our meal. The server (Feleahcia) was very helpful and service was fast. I liked the music pumping and the atmosphere was pretty chill. I recommend this spot! Oh...try the jalapeno Nino drink!,4.0

"Thank you Food Network! I watch FN religiously and I love to try new places. So let me start with the negative: it's Saturday, I drove all the way from Princeton, NJ just to try this joint. We arrived at 4:30 and are told we can't order any of the meat/BBQ items!! Uhh...what? Am I on punk'd? Cuz pretty sure I came to a BBQ RESTAURANT. Ok you wanna get on the brunch thing, that's cool. But nobody is coming here to eat your damn eggs and especially not at 4:30pm! That is just not cool. If you are a BBQ joint then serve it all day, period. That said, we waited the half hour to be able to order it. Which is just silly. The brisket is on point. They know what they're doing. We tried the sausages as well, they also had fantastic smoky BBQ flava flave. The Mac and cheese was good also. I noticed that they still serve the Fritos pie in those bougey packages so I guess best new restaurant didn't make too much of an impact there. Not important. The food is excellent which is what it all boils down to. The service was good. It's not a big place however so there would be no excuse for bad service. Only other thing that seemed to be somewhat annoying was that there is only one bathroom, meaning one toilet and its shared for men and women. Again, who really cares just informational. Bottom line the BBQ is bomb and well worth a trip. But please just serve it all day. That's like going to a pizza place and being told you can't order it for a half hour. It makes no sense.

"Wow. Go Morgans. Meat was delicious. Sides were less than five stars but still good. We will go back. Prices are expensive but you get quite a bit of food. I'm a bit over the idea that BBQ has to mean paper bowls and uncomfortable seats, though. I want to eat like I am in my backyard but in the comfort of a plush restaurant. Too much to ask?We are just leaving and we are full and happy. And sleepy.",4.0
"Food was a 3.5, Ambiance was a 3.5 (for a BBQ place) and the service was a 0.5The food was actually pretty good. I'm not much a of a BBQ aficianado but this place was pretty damn good to me.  Loved that the Elbow Room menu is integrated.  The mac n cheese at the Elbow Room is really good and a perfect, creamy compliment to the peppery bbq served up here.  For sides, we had the corn salad, which was awesome, the pinto beans were exceptional.  For meat we had the lean Brisket, peppery, dry and tasty, the Pulled Pork, my wife's favorite here, and some ribs which were also very peppers but very tasty.  The BBQ sauce they make is PERFECT as an accompaniment to the bbq flavors they use.The service was horrific.  Two hostesses who had no idea how long the wait was or where they could seat people. Seemingly an endless number of servers and bussers milling around without talking to patrons and mostly just drinking juice in the back with each other.  Took about 15 minutes to get waited on (I'm talking about getting water and anyone to say ""hi"").To avoid the horrendous service I would recommend sitting at the bar because the bartenders there work their asses off and, as a result, will give you good service.",3.0
"Went here on the Sunday of Memorial Day to sit at the bar and was greeted, or should I say not greeted, by the ""worlds worst bartender"" (a man with a huge beard) as he called himself.  After waiting for about 10 minutes and realizing the bartender did not care to make eye contact or acknowledge me I got up and asked the host for 2 menus. Only then did the bartender realize that we weren't the same people who were sitting there before. Simple enough mistake, I was willing to let it go.We asked what was better, pork or brisket and the bartender just walked away not saying anything and came back to tell us he had to try the brisket and said they were both good, very helpful thanks.  We ended up ordering the fatty brisket, pulled pork tacos and the Caribbean chicken mac and cheese (can't remember the official name of it) along with two drinks.  My boyfriend got his beer right away, after waiting about 15 minutes I finally asked about my cocktail and realized he just forgot about it.  The drink was strong and not very tasty, it was the whiskey and tea option, once again can't remember the exact name. In the mean time I tried to get water for us and that took awhile too.The food finally came and thank god... it was delicious!! The fatty brisket was full of flavor and their BBQ sauce is everything a girl could want.  The tacos were by far the best thing we ordered! The pulled pork with the guac and other toppings were PERFECT!! I could eat 10 of those in one sitting. The mac and cheese was hard to eat, the flavor profiles didn't really go well together and honestly it was hard to finish. Also important to note that this is all very messy and trying to get extra napkins from the bartender was like pulling teeth.It then took us FOREVER to get our check and by the time we left I was so angry with the service I almost forgot how good the food was.  If you go I would stay FAR away from the big bearded bartender, he really is the WORST bartender I have ever had.",3.0

"I've been consistently pleased with my dining experiences at Morgan's - I often recommend it to friends for food or drinks before events at the Barclays Center. I've been seated in the main restaurant, in the bar section up front, and at the bar itself. The service has been about average, to slightly better than expected. The seating in the back is a bit crowded/cramped, but the front section can be chilly near the door this time of year.On to the food - highlights include the brisket and pork ribs. The pulled pork is also solid, and the turkey tails is a sadly overlooked menu item that I would recommend trying - what's not mentioned on the menu is a tasty buffalo-style flavor in the glaze. Another favorite has been the Stuffed Baked Potato, with your choice of pulled pork or beef brisket. I've never tried any of the sandwiches (I'd rather fill up on meat than bread).The sides are mostly solid across the board - for me the only true lowlight is the macaroni and cheese, which is outsourced to their neighbors at Elbow Room nextdoor. They offer several types of mac & cheese, none of which have a strong enough cheese flavor - sometimes the pasta is also too mushy. Skip this, order more meat instead. Or try the beans, the greens, or the chili.Also, I have to mention this - after all my experiences I can honestly say that the most obvious criticism I have for Morgan's is their DISAPPOINTING BARBECUE SAUCE. It's the only consistently unsatisfying part of my experiences - to me it tastes sweet, with Asian influences (ginger, plum). If you could BYO sauce, you'd be set (in fact I may eventually push my luck and resort to this - or just start ordering takeout).Tip - check the bar for happy hour tacos and beers! I would go here just to get a drink - they have a great whiskey list (particularly American), solid cocktail and beer lists, and good Happy Hour specials on beers and tacos.",4.0

"I'm so disappointed to be writing this review. I personally have a whole list of places I want to try and eat at and I was excited that my boyfriend and I made weekend plans to drive an hour to Brooklyn just to try this BBQ spot that was on Bravo's Best New Restaurant show. I was drooling just thinking about the brisket that I was about to ingest. It was a gorgeous day out and perfect for some BBQ. When we got there I was smacked in the face with a sign that said ""brisket sold out"" ... What?!?! I had an instinct it wasn't going to go any better from there since our hostess who sat us didn't even care to mention it. How could a place like that be out of brisket on a Saturday no less? So in addition our waiter was not friendly and when he came to get our order didn't introduce himself or even ask if it was our first time. The first thing he said was ""you know whatchu want? Um ok. So onto the food. Maybe it's just me but when I think of BBQ I think of juicy meat paired with a nice thick BBQ sauce. Well the only sauce they had wasn't really what I would consider a BBQ sauce but a BBQ broth. We ordered pulled pork, pork ribs and a small side of Mac and cheese. The pork ribs were more red than I would have liked and the pulled pork had lots of fat which didn't thrill me. Don't bother getting the mac and cheese since it was still bland which was a critique given to them when they were on the show. Needless to say I was really disappointed and won't be returning. The mimosa wasn't bad though. Lol. Sorry that I had to make this review but needed to be honest. Hopefully it was just a rare experience.",2.0

"The title of my review should be called: A Tale of Two Briskets. One of the staple items I've come to enjoy at Morgan's Barbecue is their highly-regarded moist brisket, often paired with corn bread and mac n cheese. But the past two times I've ordered brisket, I've noticed the moist brisket being...well...not quite as fatty. When I order a fatty brisket, I want that nice thick layer which protected our bovine champion from the elements...and I'd like that with a side of corn bread and mac n cheese, please. With my soliloquy out of the way, I must say that the not-as-moist brisket is actually MORE flavorful than before, so I am sated for the time being. To date, it remains the best darn brisket I've ever had. In addition to their main attraction, their pork ribs possess the right combination of smokiness and texture that allows for extremely tender meat, yet still gives you the pleasure of biting into it (fall off the bone is overrated). Same goes for the underrated beef ribs which come brontosaurus-sized and carries a nice char without drying out the meat which remained tender and fatty. My suggestion would be to cut the rib meat off the bone, so that you can eat it in small bites.

"Good, but not great. The food is good quality, the pork ribs I ate were definitely above average for NYC, but they just do not compare to most places down South. This is the case with most all NYC cue. Their dry rub here is high quality, I think the actual taste of the pork is a problem. It's ironic because their servers wear shirts that read ""If it ain't smoked all night, it's no good"" and the smoke is what's missing from the flavor in the meat!!!! It's just not there, which is a big let down. The chips and queso were ok too, but again back in Texas you can get better chips and queso almost anywhere. It was just mediocre. You're also paying a lot of money for small portions which sucks. The service though is amazing- the servers here are some of the nicest I've experienced anywhere in NYC, and that's saying a lot. Such nice friendly people working here. Watch out for the beer menu though, $6 shiner bocks???!!!! Are you kidding me? That certainly doesn't match up to some of my old haunts back in TX- they'd through ruckus!!!! I'll give Morgans another chance for sure, but the quest for good cue in NYC continues.....:(",3.0

"Thoroughly excellent, with one caveat: I adore salt, I adore black pepper, and if you don't, much of the food will probably overwhelm your palate with its heavyhanded seasoning.Brisket and pulled pork were pleasantly fatty with moderate smokiness, greens were refreshingly simple and unadorned, red chili was earthy and rich, and the pinto beans were a saline departure from the sugary stuff most BBQ joints serve.

"I've been consistently pleased with my dining experiences at Morgan's - I often recommend it to friends for food or drinks before events at the Barclays Center. I've been seated in the main restaurant, in the bar section up front, and at the bar itself. The service has been about average, to slightly better than expected. The seating in the back is a bit crowded/cramped, but the front section can be chilly near the door this time of year.On to the food - highlights include the brisket and pork ribs. The pulled pork is also solid, and the turkey tails is a sadly overlooked menu item that I would recommend trying - what's not mentioned on the menu is a tasty buffalo-style flavor in the glaze. Another favorite has been the Stuffed Baked Potato, with your choice of pulled pork or beef brisket. I've never tried any of the sandwiches (I'd rather fill up on meat than bread).The sides are mostly solid across the board - for me the only true lowlight is the macaroni and cheese, which is outsourced to their neighbors at Elbow Room nextdoor. They offer several types of mac & cheese, none of which have a strong enough cheese flavor - sometimes the pasta is also too mushy. Skip this, order more meat instead. Or try the beans, the greens, or the chili.Also, I have to mention this - after all my experiences I can honestly say that the most obvious criticism I have for Morgan's is their DISAPPOINTING BARBECUE SAUCE. It's the only consistently unsatisfying part of my experiences - to me it tastes sweet, with Asian influences (ginger, plum). If you could BYO sauce, you'd be set (in fact I may eventually push my luck and resort to this - or just start ordering takeout).Tip - check the bar for happy hour tacos and beers! I would go here just to get a drink - they have a great whiskey list (particularly American), solid cocktail and beer lists, and good Happy Hour specials on beers and tacos.",4.0

"I'm so disappointed to be writing this review. I personally have a whole list of places I want to try and eat at and I was excited that my boyfriend and I made weekend plans to drive an hour to Brooklyn just to try this BBQ spot that was on Bravo's Best New Restaurant show. I was drooling just thinking about the brisket that I was about to ingest. It was a gorgeous day out and perfect for some BBQ. When we got there I was smacked in the face with a sign that said ""brisket sold out"" ... What?!?! I had an instinct it wasn't going to go any better from there since our hostess who sat us didn't even care to mention it. How could a place like that be out of brisket on a Saturday no less? So in addition our waiter was not friendly and when he came to get our order didn't introduce himself or even ask if it was our first time. The first thing he said was ""you know whatchu want? Um ok. So onto the food. Maybe it's just me but when I think of BBQ I think of juicy meat paired with a nice thick BBQ sauce. Well the only sauce they had wasn't really what I would consider a BBQ sauce but a BBQ broth. We ordered pulled pork, pork ribs and a small side of Mac and cheese. The pork ribs were more red than I would have liked and the pulled pork had lots of fat which didn't thrill me. Don't bother getting the mac and cheese since it was still bland which was a critique given to them when they were on the show. Needless to say I was really disappointed and won't be returning. The mimosa wasn't bad though. Lol. Sorry that I had to make this review but needed to be honest. Hopefully it was just a rare experience.",2.0

"The title of my review should be called: A Tale of Two Briskets. One of the staple items I've come to enjoy at Morgan's Barbecue is their highly-regarded moist brisket, often paired with corn bread and mac n cheese. But the past two times I've ordered brisket, I've noticed the moist brisket being...well...not quite as fatty. When I order a fatty brisket, I want that nice thick layer which protected our bovine champion from the elements...and I'd like that with a side of corn bread and mac n cheese, please. With my soliloquy out of the way, I must say that the not-as-moist brisket is actually MORE flavorful than before, so I am sated for the time being. To date, it remains the best darn brisket I've ever had. In addition to their main attraction, their pork ribs possess the right combination of smokiness and texture that allows for extremely tender meat, yet still gives you the pleasure of biting into it (fall off the bone is overrated). Same goes for the underrated beef ribs which come brontosaurus-sized and carries a nice char without drying out the meat which remained tender and fatty. My suggestion would be to cut the rib meat off the bone, so that you can eat it in small bites.

"Was walking to a different restaurant when I saw Morgan's and decided to take a friends advice. Forget that other restaurant- Morgan's is where its at! The most important part of any barbecue restaurant is the barbecue of course. Morgan's did not disappoint. The ribs were made with an excellent dry rub, no sauce needed. The meat was so tender my friend and I joked you could eat it with no teeth. You wrap your mouth around the bone and the mean falls off. TREMENDOUS. The sides were a little pricy, generally $6 for small and $12 for large. We had the potato salad which I enjoyed but the side not to be missed is the creamed corn. Squeeze that lime and enjoy! There is also a macaroni and cheese restaurant next door you can order from. We didn't partake but they certainly had some alluring choices.

"I've been to Morgan's 3 times, and twice has been a disaster. The food is okay (though I lived in the south for years, and certainly wouldn't say this is quality BBQ at all), the service is awful. My last trip there will be my last. We were seated for 25 minutes before we got a waitress. It wasn't like there wasn't one around, one kept walking directly past our table. The table directly next to us had their food before anyone ever came to our table. Eventually I got up and asked a waitress to come to our table. She got the one that ignored us, who went to another table in the section to ask if everything was okay (I'm 6 foot- 5 inches and 275 pounds, you can't really miss me). So the person I originally asked came to take our order. She did not write anything down and missed our order by a mile. Between meat and sides for our table, we ordered 8 items. 3 were right. After 10 minutes I had to again get up and find someone to complain to, who said a waitress would be right over. She wasn't. Eventually she fixed the order, but by then we just wanted to leave. I explained this is the second time this happened to us (the first time was a similar wait, and 3 tries to get one dish right), and I just wanted the check. She apologized and brought the check, and they had the gall to not only not discount it for our terrible experience, but include the food we were still waiting for!It's a shame, the space itself is nice, the drinks are good, and the food is decent, though not outstanding. The service is just so awful it ensures I'll never go back. If you want a better experience in every way, go to Fletcher's 5 minutes away in Gowanus.

"It seems that every now and then, I'll need a reminder that, as a 105 lb. girl, my stomach, unfortunately. has limits; and that I will definitely not feel well after eating three pork ribs, nearly 1/2 lb of brisket, biscuits and gravy, and cornbread. And that mac and cheese? Forget about it. (For all you skeptics thinking, ""What? You call that a lot of food? You eat like my baby sister!"" Well, I applaud you and the black holes you call your stomachs.)But everyone has a vice, and mine is obviously gluttony, and what better way to ""feed"" that vice, than indulging on some barbecue. So after eating probably two lbs. of food, I guess I should say a few words about it.First of all, from the outside of the restaurant, it seems that Morgan's is right next to Elbow Room, which sells mac and cheese. Once you're inside, the two restaurants will have merged into one - you get both menus and you can order from both on one check. This is great if you intend to order mac and cheese and want a wider variety to choose from.The highlight of the meal was definitely the pork ribs. The meat was smoky, juicy, and just tender enough to fall of the bone with a slight tug, without falling apart. The cornbread - standard, but not the best. I generally find that places err on the side of dryness, but Morgan's is actually a little too moist - perhaps because of the pepper jelly. It seemed more like pound cake than it did corn bread. However, the pepper bits inside do make it somewhat different from your standard cornbread.The fatty brisket was decent as well. My only criticism is that a big portion of it seemed more lean than fat, and not very juicy. I definitely needed a good dousing of barbecue sauce with each bite. Other than that, it was smoky and well-seasoned.For anyone who has had biscuits and (sausage) gravy before, and for anyone who has an expectation for a thick, creamy, slightly spicy, meaty, and hot gravy, I would shy away from this one. This one was a little too thick; it was warm at best; and had but a few tiny crumbs of sausage here and there. I think the bold flavors of the smokiness from the meat and the barbecue sauce might have overwhelmed my taste buds, because I thought that the first few bites of biscuit were flavorful, but after a few bites of brisket, the gravy became bland, and it became more chore than leisure to finish it.Unfortunately, I only took two or three spoonfuls of mac and cheese, which I ordered from the Elbow Room menu. I had shared the Chicken Tinga Mac with someone, who ended up taking it home, but from the spoonfuls I did have, it was too dry for my liking. I like my mac to be a little saucier, and it just wasn't up to par. Luckily, you're on this page, because you want barbecue, and in that case, you're probably better off ordering barbecue than mac, and probably some of the other sides that they offer, like the potato salad, which adds a nice acidity to the meal, or the collards. That being said, I haven't tried the collards, so I can't vouch for them, but after eating SO MUCH MEAT, greens seem to be a good idea.",3.0
"Alrighty, so the first time I ate here,  it was halfway through a night of drinking, and I swore these were the most delicious brisket soft tacos I had ever eaten in my entire life on earth. But! I know my intoxicated taste buds tend to lie to me, so I went back another time (sober!) to test these tacos again! And then I went back again a few days ago.. and I think I want to go back sometime this weekend.. because these tacos are BOMB.Since the tacos have really cast a spell on me, I can't really say anything about the other stuff on the menu, haha. Oh, but I will say that the FRITO PIE... is a must try. ;P It is genius. My boyfriend and I split one, and I severely regretted not getting my own. We even looked up the recipe so we can make some of that goodness at home! Besides the food, service is usually on point! Pleasant waiters/waittresses and food is prepared promptly!

"I professed my love for a well-known hipster BBQ place in Williamsburg awhile ago, but now that I've eaten at Morgan's, I feel like my loyalties have been divided. My partner, who rarely disagrees with me about food, still doesn't believe that Morgan's is better than the other, but overall I think we'll be seeing more of this place in the future. Given the quick seating, the great service at the bar, and the friendly low-key atmosphere, Morgan's seems a lot easier to dine at.We ordered portions of the pulled pork, fatty brisket, sausage, and ribs -- though they were all outstanding, my favourite by far was the fatty brisket, which melts in the mouth. My partner was a bit miffed by the fact that they had only one or two sauces out at the bar, but I generally prefer to eat BBQ based on its own merits.For sides, we opted for collards, beans, and a baked potato without the meat. The first two were meh, but the baked potato was a standout and I'd order it again. Our bartender commented that the baked potato with meat is a meal within itself, but even this one was pretty hefty with the (real!) cheddar cheese, sour cream, butter, and green onions. Yum.If there's room for dessert, I wouldn't skip out on the key lime pie, which has a fantastic graham cracker crust and that perfect combination of sweet and tart. Do they make these to go?",5.0

The most important part of any barbecue restaurant is the barbecue of course. Morgan's did not disappoint. The ribs were made with an excellent dry rub, no sauce needed. The meat was so tender my friend and I joked you could eat it with no teeth. You wrap your mouth around the bone and the mean falls off. TREMENDOUS. The sides were a little pricy, generally $6 for small and $12 for large. We had the potato salad which I enjoyed but the side not to be missed is the creamed corn. Squeeze that lime and enjoy! There is also a macaroni and cheese restaurant next door you can order from. We didn't partake but they certainly had some alluring choices. Above all else go for the barbecue.I highly recommend and will return.",5.0
"I've been to Morgan's 3 times, and twice has been a disaster. The food is okay (though I lived in the south for years, and certainly wouldn't say this is quality BBQ at all), the service is awful. My last trip there will be my last. We were seated for 25 minutes before we got a waitress. It wasn't like there wasn't one around, one kept walking directly past our table. The table directly next to us had their food before anyone ever came to our table. Eventually I got up and asked a waitress to come to our table. She got the one that ignored us, who went to another table in the section to ask if everything was okay (I'm 6 foot- 5 inches and 275 pounds, you can't really miss me). So the person I originally asked came to take our order. She did not write anything down and missed our order by a mile. Between meat and sides for our table, we ordered 8 items. 3 were right. After 10 minutes I had to again get up and find someone to complain to, who said a waitress would be right over. She wasn't. Eventually she fixed the order, but by then we just wanted to leave. I explained this is the second time this happened to us (the first time was a similar wait, and 3 tries to get one dish right), and I just wanted the check. She apologized and brought the check, and they had the gall to not only not discount it for our terrible experience, but include the food we were still waiting for!It's a shame, the space itself is nice, the drinks are good, and the food is decent, though not outstanding. The service is just so awful it ensures I'll never go back. If you want a better experience in every way, go to Fletcher's 5 minutes away in Gowanus. The staff is 100 times better and the BBQ is equally better.",1.0
"I really like Morgan's and am so glad they came to the neighborhood. Lean brisket and pulled pork are delicious. Get the sweet potato. Hell, ask if they can stuff the sweet potato with brisket. It's worth it.Collard greens were just OK. Mac and cheese apparently not the best. Beans really good. Brisket tacos are awesome. Love the sauce!Nice selection of sides to divvy up so you can try a lot.",4.0
"I.LOVE.THIS.PLACE.Been here twice in four days and have to say it makes me miss TX.  Fatty brisket is perfect, chopped beef is amazing, and the pork links are fracking awesome.Staff is very attentive and friendly.  Damn, feeling homesick....Place would have 5 stars if it had a Baylor University flag hanging.  Sic' EM Bears!",4.0
fatty briskey... collard greens.... mmmmmmmm.,5.0
"It seems that every now and then, I'll need a reminder that, as a 105 lb. girl, my stomach, unfortunately. has limits; and that I will definitely not feel well after eating three pork ribs, nearly 1/2 lb of brisket, biscuits and gravy, and cornbread. And that mac and cheese? Forget about it. (For all you skeptics thinking, ""What? You call that a lot of food? You eat like my baby sister!"" Well, I applaud you and the black holes you call your stomachs.)But everyone has a vice, and mine is obviously gluttony, and what better way to ""feed"" that vice, than indulging on some barbecue. So after eating probably two lbs. of food, I guess I should say a few words about it.First of all, from the outside of the restaurant, it seems that Morgan's is right next to Elbow Room, which sells mac and cheese. Once you're inside, the two restaurants will have merged into one - you get both menus and you can order from both on one check. This is great if you intend to order mac and cheese and want a wider variety to choose from.The highlight of the meal was definitely the pork ribs. The meat was smoky, juicy, and just tender enough to fall of the bone with a slight tug, without falling apart. The cornbread - standard, but not the best. I generally find that places err on the side of dryness, but Morgan's is actually a little too moist - perhaps because of the pepper jelly. It seemed more like pound cake than it did corn bread. However, the pepper bits inside do make it somewhat different from your standard cornbread.The fatty brisket was decent as well. My only criticism is that a big portion of it seemed more lean than fat, and not very juicy. I definitely needed a good dousing of barbecue sauce with each bite. Other than that, it was smoky and well-seasoned.For anyone who has had biscuits and (sausage) gravy before, and for anyone who has an expectation for a thick, creamy, slightly spicy, meaty, and hot gravy, I would shy away from this one. This one was a little too thick; it was warm at best; and had but a few tiny crumbs of sausage here and there. I think the bold flavors of the smokiness from the meat and the barbecue sauce might have overwhelmed my taste buds, because I thought that the first few bites of biscuit were flavorful, but after a few bites of brisket, the gravy became bland, and it became more chore than leisure to finish it.Unfortunately, I only took two or three spoonfuls of mac and cheese, which I ordered from the Elbow Room menu. I had shared the Chicken Tinga Mac with someone, who ended up taking it home, but from the spoonfuls I did have, it was too dry for my liking. I like my mac to be a little saucier, and it just wasn't up to par. Luckily, you're on this page, because you want barbecue, and in that case, you're probably better off ordering barbecue than mac, and probably some of the other sides that they offer, like the potato salad, which adds a nice acidity to the meal, or the collards. That being said, I haven't tried the collards, so I can't vouch for them, but after eating SO MUCH MEAT, greens seem to be a good idea.",3.0
"Alrighty, so the first time I ate here,  it was halfway through a night of drinking, and I swore these were the most delicious brisket soft tacos I had ever eaten in my entire life on earth. But! I know my intoxicated taste buds tend to lie to me, so I went back another time (sober!) to test these tacos again! And then I went back again a few days ago.. and I think I want to go back sometime this weekend.. because these tacos are BOMB.Since the tacos have really cast a spell on me, I can't really say anything about the other stuff on the menu, haha. Oh, but I will say that the FRITO PIE... is a must try. ;P It is genius. My boyfriend and I split one, and I severely regretted not getting my own. We even looked up the recipe so we can make some of that goodness at home! Besides the food, service is usually on point! Pleasant waiters/waittresses and food is prepared promptly! This place is also conveniently located near the Barclays center, so it makes for a good post-game/post-concert pit stop.",4.0
"I professed my love for a well-known hipster BBQ place in Williamsburg awhile ago, but now that I've eaten at Morgan's, I feel like my loyalties have been divided. My partner, who rarely disagrees with me about food, still doesn't believe that Morgan's is better than the other, but overall I think we'll be seeing more of this place in the future. Given the quick seating, the great service at the bar, and the friendly low-key atmosphere, Morgan's seems a lot easier to dine at.We ordered portions of the pulled pork, fatty brisket, sausage, and ribs -- though they were all outstanding, my favourite by far was the fatty brisket, which melts in the mouth. My partner was a bit miffed by the fact that they had only one or two sauces out at the bar, but I generally prefer to eat BBQ based on its own merits.For sides, we opted for collards, beans, and a baked potato without the meat. The first two were meh, but the baked potato was a standout and I'd order it again. Our bartender commented that the baked potato with meat is a meal within itself, but even this one was pretty hefty with the (real!) cheddar cheese, sour cream, butter, and green onions. Yum.If there's room for dessert, I wouldn't skip out on the key lime pie, which has a fantastic graham cracker crust and that perfect combination of sweet and tart. Do they make these to go?",5.0
"This is a great option to grab a bite before an event at the Barclays center. It's just a couple blocks away, right down the street. Loved this place. Love the decor, the way it's laid out, the service, the food, the drinks, etc. I did the Mac, Cornbread, Pulled Pork Tacos and I loved them all. If you're going to a Nets game, and you stop in here, this place will be the highlight of your night!!!",5.0
There are few times in life where I have ever fallen out of a chair and one time was at Morgan's barbecue. The seats have no backs. The containers they give don't fit in the bottom of the bags. There's no ranch sauce. There's no drink sweeteners. Why serve pink lemonade if it just tastes like lemonade. I don't get it. They need to step their game up. Give people what they want and not what you want! Otherwise the food was good I recommend the pork or spicy brisket tacos. The wings were a lil under whelming. Waitress was friendly. :-),3.0

"This is a tasty, tasty BBQ place. We were a group of 6, easily seated in the HUGE space that they have, and proceed to eat as much of that grub as possible.

And, to top it all off, we had a really fun time with our waitress.Psyched that this place has moved into the neighb. See ya soon, Morgan's!",5.0
"Seriously awesome. Both dinner and brunch are awesome. My fave for dinner is the green bean casserole and cobbler. For brunch: biscuits and gravy. Enough said... But I'll say more. There was ample gravy atop the perfect biscuit. The banana pancakes were huge and perfectly delicious. One of the best brunches we've ever indulged in. As for the comments about the limited brunch menu: yes, there are things on the menu that they don't have yet. They just started serving brunch, so they're not fully ready yet... No big deal. We'll just have to go back. One downside: they stopped playing country music. Boo to that.",5.0
"After reading some reviews, we checked out Morgan's for Sunday brunch. To be blunt, boy were we sorry.  First off, as the server sat us and gave us menus, she proceeded to tell us what she was out of. For the 7 or so egg dishes, they were out of all but 1.  And to clarify, we were there at noon, they opened at 11 and we were one of the only tables there. The server then flipped over the menu to continue to tell us what they were out of.  We should have left right there.  She asked if we wanted drinks and offered Bloody Mary's or Mimosas. Neither were on the menu but since I find it hard to pass up a Bloody Mary I ordered one, my bf ordered a draft beer. Since options were limited we decided to each order sandwiches (I chose the pulled pork, bf ordered the sausage). According to the menu, we were each entitled to a side with sandwiches during lunch hours 11am-5pm. No where did the menu (in the restaurant or online) did it stipulate that sandwiches only come with sides M-F. After we ordered our food, drinks came. My Bloody was weak, both in alcohol and flavor, and was teeny.  Bfs beer was fine.  When meals came they were served on cheap deli rolls. We were disappointed as soon as the food was placed in front of us.  Neither of us was satisfied in the least. The collards were blah, the mac & cheese was  nothing special. In short, the food was mediocre at best. The sides were served in 4 oz cups, $6 for collards and $4 for mac & cheese.The shock came when the bill arrived and my bf said ""that was perhaps one of the most mediocre meals for $50."" I immediately asked to see the bill since $50 seemed way too much.  Each sandwich was $10.50 and the beer, according tot he menu was $6. When I looked at the itemized bill, the teeny Bloody was $9! Now, I'm in now way new to Brooklyn brunches.  I will pay $10 for a good Bloody in a pint glass.  But this was absurd.  Then, as I gazed down, I saw the sides added in separately.  I asked a server who said sides are only included M-F.  Thought I wanted to argue, the bf more wisely said our best show of dissatisfaction will be to never, ever eat at Morgan's again.  With all of the amazing restaurants in Brooklyn, especially in Pros Heights and the Slope, and with BBQ spots being the new Fro-Yos popping up everywhere I'd encourage everyone to check out ANY of the other restaurants in the area.  Dinosaur BBQ is a favorite and I'm bummed we didn't just stick with what we know this morning.",1.0

We decided to go for it, but upon sitting down we were promptly told that the regular brunch menu was not an option. Instead they gave one piece of paper with all new brunch items. Unfortunately, some of the stuff that was on the original brunch menu was what we had wanted, but we figured we'd make do. The waitress (who was a bit weird) came to take our drink orders. I had seen a bloody mary go by and asked how much they were since they weren't listed on the menu. She said she didn't know but that she ""thought"" they were $9.

I got the biscuits and gravy with the mushroom gravy. Really yummy gravy, but the biscuits were too dense. I grew up in the south and know what biscuits should taste like, and these were not that. I also split a side of mac and cheese with a friend. It was fine, but nothing special, and again it was almost cold which is not good for mac and cheese. My other friends liked their food... one got a breakfast burrito and said the brisket was delicious.

The brisket falls apart and has a great smoky flavor, the pulled pork as well, and the side dishes were terrific. The chili in something called ""Frito Pie"" is delicious - I would go there again just for the chili. The peach/blueberry cobbler seemed expensive at $8,  but it was large, it fed three people, delicious, and they obviously used fresh peaches and blueberries.This is a great addition to the neighborhood - there's no BBQ equivalent for miles. Truly, the smoky meat is terrific -- and their sauce - incredible. I also predict that they'll bottle and sell it, it is that good.Every dish had it's own flavor; it wasn't the same piece of meat, covered by different sauces. I recommend it heartily.

"Went there once and they did everything right. Good lighting, comfortable bar, good design. Music was a little cliche but not a big deal. Friendly, relaxed sincere service that didn't feel forced. This is a big thing for me. Service at other bbq joints i find to always be weird- either overly jolly, bitter, or unprofessional. Food comes out FAST.

"I went for the complimentary food during a tasting and was really impressed. Went back again once they got the liquor license and it was even better than I remembered.  I had the pulled pork (moist and delicious) and the brisket (also very good).  I haven't tried all the sides but my favorites so far are the collard greens (a bit spicy), coleslaw, and bean casserole.  The corn bread is also tasty.  The best BBQ that I've had in Brooklyn. The vibe is laid back and friendly.  The staff are all very friendly and hospitable.",5.0

"I have very mixed feelings about Morgan's, following three very mixed experiences. The pork ribs are absolutely incredible, beautifully tender & wonderfully spiced, fall off the bone amazing! The fatty brisket is absolutely phenomenal, ever so delectable and indulgent. These are the best things I've had, far and beyond. I've been hoping to try the beef ribs, and even though we are continually told that they'll be offered ""definitely next week"" and ""most likely next week"" and ""probably next week"" -- we keep trusting them, since they're listed on the menu, and since it's best to give people the benefit of the doubt, so we keep coming back, but we have been continually disappointed, and I am becoming increasingly frustrated, over it. Also, they are constantly out of things, there's no this, there's no that, they really need to prepare better, and get their business in order. Thankfully, the beer selection is decent, and the key lime pie was an absolute knock-out. Lastly, the side dishes -- the cole slaw & collard greens & mac n' cheese & pinto beans are mediocre at best, utterly forgettable, the red chili is pretty good but way too salty, and the lone stand-out is the absolutely terrific potato salad.",3.0
"Because my last experience was pleasant I decided to indulge again.... Well I was pretty disappointed1) The place was Freezing?!? Hello it's winter, where the hell is the heat?!?  We find out via the middle of our meal, that the heating system was broken. WHAT?!? There are places called Home Depot, Loews and Pintchik (which is across the street) that you can buy heaters.... 2) My family loves cornbread and theirs is pretty good, when we ordered our second batch they ran out?!?  A BBQ restaurant w/ no cornbread? Who does that?!  3) what restaurant in NYC during the winter does not serve hot beverages? I asked for a hot tea...no hot water available? Huh? I'm confused and annoyed! Our server Alex was a gem!!! We would have left in the muddle of our meal if it wasn't for Alex....The owner/management has much to be desired in relation to customer service. If u decide to go make sure the heat is working and that they are fully stocked. Good luck!!",3.0
"I believe we have a winner.People are gonna go on all day, but here is the breakdown:[BBQ Thing]: [Adjectives that describe BBQ Thing] || [Whether I happen to like it this way or not] [$ = Too expensive for what it is]Pulled Pork: Tender, salty, smoky, fatty || YesMac and Cheese: Creamy, wet || NoColeslaw: Tangy, crunchy || YesCollard Greens: Spicy, salty, slightly bitter || YesCorn Bread: Moist || Yes $Frito Pie requires a special mention because I've never seen one outside of Texas before. This is also the best one I've ever had, but it is $6 for what is basically a little taste treat.BBQ Sauce sitting in jars at tables also deserves a special mention - it is the heart and soul of the place. It's thin, and heavy on tanginess (vinegar?), but it is absolutely delicious. I suspect they are making it in-house. I predict that before too long they will be charging for it, so definitely go and drink it directly out of the bottle while they still don't see that move coming.",5.0
"Went here last night with a friend, could not be more pleased. Ambiance is solid. The brisket was orgasmic,  there really isn't another word that would do it justice. Mac and cheese and collard greens were pretty good. Then came the pies. Yes three, for two people. They were that good. Prices were great.The bartenders, Kier and and Justin were fantastic, personable, and down to earth.This place was just perfect for what we were looking for. I almost do not want to write this review, in fear that it will become too crowded. I'll stop being selfish and press submit.",5.0

For my main dish I ordered a loaded baked potato stuffed with brisket because at home it's a delicious dish and I was so happy they had it. It was such a disappointment, the potato was small, just regular sized and it was undercooked, the inside was pretty firm, it lacked in the amount of butter and cheese, and the brisket was very subpar. Usually, this particular dish is served and the potato is basically falling apart because of all of the butter and cheese being melted by the hot meat in an already hot potato, it's usually pretty epic but not here.

"We popped into Morgans after deciding not to wait 40 minutes for a seat at a place across the street and I'm glad we did.They were out of a few things on the menu which was a little annoying but I enjoyed what we ordered.  We shared 3/4lbs of fatty brisket, 16 oz of macaroni and cheese, 8 oz of Texas red chile, 8 oz of potato salad and some cornbread.The brisket was delicious! I'm not a big fan of lean brisket so I appreciated the juicy deliciousness of the fatty option. The mac and cheese and cornbread were okay, nothing to write home about, but the cornbread came in handy for scraping the chile container. That was some good chile.I very picky about potato salad so my friend ordered the smallest size, thinking that would be the one dish he didn't have to share. Turns out that was the wrong thing to do because it ended up being my favorite item of all and he barely got any of it. I've been talking about that potato salad ever since.My friend, a new transplant from the midwest, always asks if there are free refills on soft drinks when he orders his ginger ale. Usually, the answer is no, but at Morgans he heard, ""yes"" and was ecstatic. I'll definitely be back!",4.0

The rub was a bit too strong for me and took away from the amazing flavor and texture of the meat. Just a touch lighter on the pepper and it would be absolute perfection. The pork ribs used the exact same rub to the same effect. They were perfectly moist and the meat was great if you scraped off the rub.

"Time of visit: December 29, 2014 @ approx. 10:30pmDeserves no stars because: Disgusting + Terrible ServiceGets 1 star because: Yelp doesnt do half -stars and the potato salad saved the night a LITTLE BIT.This review may differ from other positive reviews because of different restaurant servers and time of eating but this is what I experienced. Fellow Yelpers, take this review with care on your next trip there and avoid the circumstances that are similar to ours. I dont like to waste my time writing but I only write if something got way out of hand. This place was one of them...I HAVE TO LET THE PEOPLE KNOW.Went to Morgan's after a Net's game. Initially wanted to get Dino BBQ but upon arriving there, we found out they didn't have any major meat players (brisket, ribs) so we took a chance and trekked to Morgan's feeling that they would have more selection because they close an hour later than Dino..what a MISTAKE. THEY HAD LESS...Manager of Morgan's, if you actually go on Yelp to read about your restaurant, let me begin by saying that by the end of the night, we still did not know who our server was... There were 2 women rotating with service at our table (why?)... We got our water from one woman, got orders taken from another, and was served by the former. That is not even the lowlight of the night. First off, one server was drinking alcohol while on her shift. She was drinking with what seemed to be her friends who were in to visit. Only helped us reluctantly when her FRIENDS POINTED IT OUT. IMAGINE!? EVEN HER FRIENDS HAD MORE OF AN IDEA TO HELP A PATRON. HER FRIENDS SHOULD HAVE TAKEN HOME THE EARNINGS...Second, the other server was a drama queen who was rather rude and would ignore patrons on purpose, pretending not to have seen an outstretched hand asking for assistance. Im not one to bash on people, but that is quite rude that she decided for herself when and whether she would come over and provide help. What was even ruder was she called out the table next to us when they were about to leave with such attitude. She said in a loud voice, ""sorry I dont know if you guys know, but we didnt include gratuity.."" One of the patrons opened the check holder and showed that they had indeed left the tip. All the server did was say dryly, ""thanks."" That left such a sour taste in my mouth. How rude do you have to be to do that? Who's doing the hiring in this restaurant? Where was the apology at least? Holy Toledo, maybe the person who hired those ladies has an agenda with the boss.. I dont know, Im just saying. You dont hurt your business like that by hiring people like those 2.That night, Morgan's did not have the main meat players as well. Even when they closed at 12... Ok fine, understandable if all Morgan's does is serve alcohol and whatever but do try to let people know that maybe the kitchen would close at a certain time and not serve the main course meat.. We ended up getting macaroni and cheese with potato salad and a sausage. Here is the food breakdown:Both Mac and Cheese (got the mushroom and chicken with avocado) were warm. Mac and Cheese should be hot and gooey. The cheese should be elastic right? BZZZ wrong. It just detached faster than a retina after an eye gouge.... Even if it is late at night, I expect to get my money's worth of food quality. Do you agree? Dont use closing time as an excuse. If you do, you might as well offer a late night discount. The potato salad was the only good thing, know why? Because it's the ONLY thing that needed to be refrigerated. Meaning you cant really screw it up so long as it is in cold air... I did not forget about the pork sausage. Ready for this? Drier than the desert. Obviously it's been kept in the kitchen for quite some time. Absolutely terrible. Eating it made me thirsty and that is no exaggeration. And here is the most HEINOUS crime that night. Ms Drama Queen tried to play us for fools when we called for the check. Let me turn back the clock to let you fellow readers know the situation. We ordered the lean brisket because Ms Drinks on the Job told us that that is the only brisket they had left. Fine, all good in the neighborhood like Mr Rogers. After the order was placed, Ms Drama Queen comes over and tells us that they actually ran out of brisket. Ok FINE. I told her we will cancel the brisket and order the drier than hippo skin sausage. She said ok.Back to the HEINOUS crime. Ms Drama Queen gave us the check and the brisket was there... You, the reader might say, it could be an accident. Well.. I dont think so.. Why was the sausage order listed above the brisket?.. That bugs me more than a fly to an elephant. Boy what a scheme. Unbelievable. Look, Im not saying to not eat at this place. Just please NEVER GO AT NIGHT AFTER 10.. I left only 6% tip because tips are not a privilege. It is earned with hard and respectful work. It is supposed to reflect the quality of work you are doing. Just me, but Im not returning. And others will hear about this",1.0
"2 Morgans went to Morgan's in Brooklyn last night for Texas style BBQ.  We has brisket and you choose fatty or lean...guess which Jr. picked?  I got pulled pork, then we added sides of green bean casserole, mac-n-cheese, coleslaw, jalapeño corn bread with pepper jelly, Frito pie (beef chili, sour cream on Fritos inside the Fritos bag, tequila for me and really perfect hand made sweetened ice tea for Jr....then for round 2 some ribs and then a key lime pie for dessert...voila.We talked to the owner, a young guy from Beaumont Texas with the last name Morgan, and he was pretty happy the place was packed after being open 3 weeks.  I'm super critical so I would give it an 8...could have been a 9 but my pulled pork was too fatty and the portion in the amazing Frito pie (pictured) was a bit light.  They are planning more Louisiana style stuff to like gumbo, crawfish étouffée and brunch soon.  It was marvelous!!!  I'll be back.",5.0
"I've passed this place so many times and vowed to come in and try!  Very casual place, friendly staff and yummy food.  I had the brisket sandwich and it was perfect!  Soft bun, sweet, tender and tasty brisket with perfect crunchy slaw.  Also tried the buffalo Mac n cheese!!  Scrumptious!!!!  I'll be back to try more items on the menu!! :)",4.0
"First time I went to Morgan's a friend and I sat at the bar.  Bartender was great.  My friend and I thought the BBQ was was delicious, and she's a harsh critic from Austin.  (Turns out one of the pit masters was from Austin as well, and certainly knows what he's doing.)  Somehow we managed to close the place, have great whiskey, and meet some of the great staff at this place.  I've been back since, and still find it to be an open air, good vibe, great place with arguably the best BBQ in Brooklyn and NYC.",4.0
Must try the pork ribs! Amazing!!! They even have all the macaroni's from elbow room here!,4.0
"It seems the quality went downhill a little.  I originally gave it 5 stars, but after the last couple of experiences, the brisket was nowhere near as good as it once was, i.e., the moist cuts were pretty dry.  Unfortunately I can't say this place is as consistent as I thought it was, but I do like the vibe and will eventually make my way over here again.",3.0
"I love BBQ and there are some great places to find it in NYC. This is not one of them. I can't believe what I'm seeing from some of these other reviews. Every last bit of meat we ate was improperly cooked.The name of the game here was acceptable/edible, but absolutely 100% not worth the price. At usual New York prices $20/lb for lean brisket and $22/lb for fatty brisket, it better be some of the best damn brisket this side of the mason dixon line. That's the status quo in NYC. Unfortunately, Mighty Quinn's and Mable's both have superior brisket for the same price. (and honestly, I'm not even a huge fan of Mable's brisket, but we'll get to that) This brisket, while beautifully smoked, was cooked to death. Again, it was totally edible, but it was absolutely overcooked. This would have been much easier to overlook if we were talking about $18/lb brisket. But considering it was $20 on the low end, it was really disappointing how dry it was. (we got a half pound each of lean & fatty)  This may have had something to do with the array of heatlamps they employ, but either way, it was absolutely not worth the price. If you want amazing melt in your mouth brisket, go to Mighty Quinn's.The Pork Ribs were well seasoned; I like a bit of heat. But, these were also cooked improperly. I'd guess they were cooked at too high a temp for the collagen to break down allowing the meat to fall off the bone while simultaneously overcooking the meat. This is where Mable's shines. Every single time I've visited Mable's the pork ribs just fall off the bone, literally. You can pick up a bone and the meat will be left on the tray. This is not the case at Morgan's. I wasn't fighting with the bone, per se, but it was unpleasantly tough and not the delightful lip smacking tenderness you expect from properly cooked pork ribs. If you want amazing pork ribs, go to Mable's.Where I do think Morgan's shines is in their pulled pork tacos. These were wonderfully assembled and the pulled pork was tender and juicy as can be. These were fantastic and reasonably priced. Their sides are also reasonably priced and the quality here is high. The Mac & Cheese was delightful, with bread crumbs & topped with parmesan. The collards were fantastic. Really tender, well seasoned, not overcooked. Really nice. And boy-o, that cornbread. The cornbread stole the show, I think. It's easy to fall into a chewy dry mess of cornbread, but this cornbread was light, fluffy, sweet, moist, and tender, yet the outsides were firm. Fantastic cornbread.The two stars awarded are for the sides & for the service. Everyone was friendly as could be, even though it was packed. Lots of attention, great bartenders and reasonably priced drinks.All in all, if you're looking for a place to grab a quick bite and drink, Morgan's is fine. Just don't expect to get high quality BBQ.",2.0
The food is really great the pulled pork is to die for and so is the pecan pie. The only thing I can say is get there early because this place it so popular food does run out . Lastly the macaroni and cheese is not consistent and it's only good when a specific chef makes it,4.0
"I often write verbose reviews, however that is not required in this instance: Pair appalling management, dreadful service and woefully mediocre food and you have a recipe for disaster.The premise is not bad, in theory: A restaurant with a large outdoor seating area on Flatbush serving familiar barbecue favorites? Sounds good to me. The problems, however, begin when you walk through the door whereupon the host put us to the side and helped three other groups of people before seating us. The service was slow (several groups that arrived well after us, received their food before us) and the ambiance...well there was none to speak of.The food itself was abysmal when compared to places like Fette Sau and Mighty Quinn's -- completely different leagues. The brisket was dry and barely edible, the pulled pork was really mediocre. Have you had the pulled pork sandwich from Juniper? Compare the two products and get back to me. The mac and cheese from The Elbow Room was the best thing we ate, by a considerable margin, though it wasn't spectacular and it certainly wasn't schlepp-worthy, considering the price for a rather small portion.Conclusion: As far as barbecue goes, all one expects is honest to goodness flavorful and tender meat. Morgan's Barbecue failed to deliver in that regard. With music blaring at obnoxious levels, service that leaves plenty to be desired and food that falls short of its competitors, one should hop on the train and dash to a purveyor of consistently good fare.",2.0
I guess im bias bc im not crazy about BBQ food and my dumb self shouldn't have went to a restaurant that specializes that BUUUUT that being said I tried a couple different Mac and cheeses and they were all very good. The drinks are watered down tho I just drank beer.,3.0
"Time of visit: December 29, 2014 @ approx. 10:30pmDeserves no stars because: Disgusting + Terrible ServiceGets 1 star because: Yelp doesnt do half -stars and the potato salad saved the night a LITTLE BIT.This review may differ from other positive reviews because of different restaurant servers and time of eating but this is what I experienced. Fellow Yelpers, take this review with care on your next trip there and avoid the circumstances that are similar to ours. I dont like to waste my time writing but I only write if something got way out of hand. This place was one of them...I HAVE TO LET THE PEOPLE KNOW.Went to Morgan's after a Net's game. Initially wanted to get Dino BBQ but upon arriving there, we found out they didn't have any major meat players (brisket, ribs) so we took a chance and trekked to Morgan's feeling that they would have more selection because they close an hour later than Dino..what a MISTAKE. THEY HAD LESS...Manager of Morgan's, if you actually go on Yelp to read about your restaurant, let me begin by saying that by the end of the night, we still did not know who our server was... There were 2 women rotating with service at our table (why?)... We got our water from one woman, got orders taken from another, and was served by the former. That is not even the lowlight of the night. First off, one server was drinking alcohol while on her shift. She was drinking with what seemed to be her friends who were in to visit.

Today, the food came incredibly quickly but I had to ask for water three times before anyone at the table had anything to drink. Someone comes by every 10 minutes to ask how everything is, and the food is great, but the servers don't seem to talk with each other and all have different ideas of what food the restaurant has run out of (or even where you're supposed to order- someone told us to order from the Elbow Room window at one point).

I can't speak to the food quality or quantity as we were seated, given menus, and not spoken to again.

"Was excited to see a new BBQ place near my old apartment. Too bar it wasn't there while I was still living here. Went in with my old roommate and waited 10 minutes before anyone came up to seat us. After finally being seated, it was another 10 minutes before anyone brought over waters or menus. Finally we got to order. When the food finally came- our waitress disappeared again and we were forced to go up to the bar just to ask for napkins and plastic utensils. Once we saw our waitress across the restaurant I had to again get up to ask for real knives. Service aside, I will say the food was amazing. Well-priced and quite delicious.

"Can't say enough good things about Morgan's.  Definitely is my go to spot in the neighborhood.  The BBQ there is fantastic, which for any type of a commercial type establishment is hard to pull off.  The staff is nice.  The drinks are good and cold.  I love that you can sit outside and the front also opens up so it feels like you're outside.",5.0
"I loved my first time here, but it got progressively worse, service-but more specifically the brisket.  They were serving me lean brisket and trying to call it fatty.  Once is bad enough, but two separate times?  Why?  Dishonesty?  Stupidity?  Laziness of the cook?  Such a shame, because when it's good here it's outstanding!  But I don't have time for inconsistency like this.",2.0
"I randomly walked into this place with my boyfriend and I must say we were impressed. The food was definitely delicious and the corn bread was amazing! I do have to agree with everyone else, the portions suck and are overpriced. However, you are getting delicious food and it's worth every dollar. The best part of the meal was the cornbread and the ribs, don't miss out on those. The girls are really nice and very pretty, some eye candy there for the guys.",4.0
"The food is amazing!Seriously, their meat is succulent and great and I love all the sides and will definitely come back here time and time again. But I really, really, REALLY hope they figure out their service. Of the three times I've been here, they've messed up my order every time. Today, the food came incredibly quickly but I had to ask for water three times before anyone at the table had anything to drink. Someone comes by every 10 minutes to ask how everything is, and the food is great, but the servers don't seem to talk with each other and all have different ideas of what food the restaurant has run out of (or even where you're supposed to order- someone told us to order from the Elbow Room window at one point). And there's a weird focus on upselling, which is not something I ever want to run into at a restaurant.I hope to increase my rating in a month or two, when they'll hopefully have figured out some kind of system to manage/train their servers.",3.0
"I tried, twice, to like this place. The first time was within a week of opening - they were out of items on the menu (brisket), the service was poor, and the wine had a strange flavor.

I can't speak to the food quality or quantity as we were seated, given menus, and not spoken to again.

"I live pretty darn close to this restaurant and my two roommates and I didn't want to go far for dinner. One roommate is from Texas, the other from Kansas City so they've got some experience eating some quality BBQ food.Given that this was its opening night, I'm going to give it the benefit of the doubt. However, the quality was really not that impressive. I ordered ribs but they were out so I got brisket instead and I didn't get much flavor from the meat. The sauces were too watery for my taste and I'm not a fan of vinegar based sauces. The potato salad was just okay and I wish the bread it came with was more like toast.

"Delicious. We had brisket, sausage and turkey. Turkey was amazing--tender and peppery. For sides we had coleslaw which was fresh and crunchy, green bean casserole which was super good a d creamy and hamburger mac and cheese. The Mac and cheese was just okay. I would try another flavor if we went back though.However, the environment was a little chaotic. The music was VERY loud. Too loud to hear the person I was dining with and it made our stay less comfortable than it should have been. It's a shame because while it was good music it radically reduced the comfortable atmosphere. Plus, there seemed to be some confusion about who our waitress was and we had one express some annoyance that someone else had taken our order. And then we had to ask for drinks multiple times since they never came. Waitstaff also didn't treat customers very well when navigating the restaurant- bathing past, knocking into to people, etc. just a little courtesy and welcome would go a long way.This place deserves four stars for food but I am giving them three because of the blaring music and chaos.",3.0

"I've been here about 20 times since they opened. My wife and I did a Texas BBQ honeymoon in hill country around Austin. Every time I came, the BBQ was better and better (starting from a good place). At its best, the brisket was better than all but that we found at Franklin and LA Barbecue in Austin. Not coincidentally, when Franklin opened, the three pitmasters were Aaron Franklin, John Lewis (of LA Barbecue) and Morgans' pitmaster, John Avila. As we kept coming to Morgan's the brisket and pulled pork especially got better and better.But starting a few months ago, the fatty brisket started feeling awfully lean. The very friendly manager told us that the organic/grass fed source for their beef was trimming the briskets of fat before delivery, and that was affecting the fatty brisket. It is still delicious, and they seem to be compensating with an abundance of black pepper. Still very good, but a pale shadow of what it had grown to be. Hopefully they can fix their sourcing and go back to a less peppery (but still peppery) recipe. As a result, the pulled pork is now the best meat on the menu. Super juicy, very flavorful, and with a hint of red pepper flake. Easily the best pulled pork in NYC, and yes, I've had them all. When the brisket was at its best, it was also the best in town, but sadly that hasn't been the case recently.The pork ribs are also terrific, among the best in NYC, if not the very best. The turkey tails are a great alternative to buffalo wings, and a unique culinary experience as far as I've ever had. The mac (Morgan's, never had the Elbow Room) is very good. Not nearly the best in the area, but very reliably good. I wasn't a fan of the cornbread, but I've enjoyed most of the other sides. Baked potatoes are very rudimentary and feel mostly microwaved with an oven finish, but they do the job. I wish they had fries, as I bet they'd nail them.Service is almost always a little problematic. Just little things, often with the check, and always resolved to our satisfaction.So why five stars, given these reservations? Because the meat, (pulled pork and ribs always, and especially the brisket when it is at its best) is simply the best you can get outside of Texas for this style of BBQ. Ignore people complaining about the sauce: proper Texas BBQ needs no sauce, and is flavored by the meat, the smoke, and the seasonings alone. I hope they can right their course with the fatty brisket, because when it was at its best, it was truly something special. Check them out, come hungry, and try everything that appeals. You won't regret it!",5.0

"I have by about three times. Each time, I was told by my mediocre staff that they don't have any ribs! What? A BBQ place with no ribs. It was too early in the evening to run out. Then, no more cornbread? What? How do you run out of cornbread so early in the evening. This happened on each visit. The fatty brisket was good. The potato salad was $6 which included a small cup of one heaping tablespoon. The Mac n cheese was bland. We ordered a sweet potatoe, which was $4 and received a half of potato. I asked where the other half was, and the waitress called over a female manager. She was nervously trying to be chatty and friendly but said that was the norm. So, look to spend $8 for a whole potato. By the way, we decided to go to Elbow Room the next day to try the Mac n cheese. The girl at the window acted as we were disturbing her conversation. She was unfriendly and mumbled every time we asked a question. We sat down to eat sitting with other guests who all admitted that the worst part of elbow room is the poor service window. Why can't they train and hire good help and pay a decent salary. I will never order from elbow room again and I tell everyone to stay away.I am giving Morgans the benefit of the doubt by giving it 2 stars hoping they will improve over time.

And their happy hour is something you cannot miss since you can eat like a king for $15. The seats are a bit uncomfortable though since there are no cushions...",5.0
"I went there last weekend. Great atmosphere, friendly staff and incredible food.  I had a fully loaded baked potato and the collared greens.  Both were off the charts good.  Towards the end of of our evening there, I think they let one of their friends be a ""guest bartender.""  He didn't really know where anything was, but was incredibly nice and talked us into another round.  And we liked that that's the type of place it is, you know?  We also liked how a lot of the staff hangs out after their shifts end... pretty good sign that it's a cool place to be.  I mean, when I'm off at my work, I'm OUT OF THERE!!  Oh, and their whiskey selection is pretty decent.  It could benefit from a few extra top-shelf options, but it's a barbecue place, so I'm not taking a star away for that.  Great family place, too. People of all sorts.  I'll be back very soon.",5.0
"Holy cow, batman! Everything is delicious, especially the green bean casserole (I know, I'm pretty shocked that my favorite item at a BBQ place isn't even BBQ). The beer options are limited, but good. The bartenders are nothing short of ""the best bartenders ever."" Seriously. I'm thrilled this place exists.",5.0
"I have by about three times. Each time, I was told by my mediocre staff that they don't have any ribs! What? A BBQ place with no ribs. It was too early in the evening to run out. Then, no more cornbread? What? How do you run out of cornbread so early in the evening. This happened on each visit. The fatty brisket was good. The potato salad was $6 which included a small cup of one heaping tablespoon. The Mac n cheese was bland. We ordered a sweet potatoe, which was $4 and received a half of potato. I asked where the other half was, and the waitress called over a female manager. She was nervously trying to be chatty and friendly but said that was the norm. So, look to spend $8 for a whole potato. By the way, we decided to go to Elbow Room the next day to try the Mac n cheese. The girl at the window acted as we were disturbing her conversation. She was unfriendly and mumbled every time we asked a question. We sat down to eat sitting with other guests who all admitted that the worst part of elbow room is the poor service window. Why can't they train and hire good help and pay a decent salary. I will never order from elbow room again and I tell everyone to stay away.I am giving Morgans the benefit of the doubt by giving it 2 stars hoping they will improve over time. Our blande and disappointing dinner cost $70 without drinks. Keep away.",2.0
"This place awesome! I can't believe I hadn't been here prior, I live right by the place. Will be coming back often for sure. The brisket is I think the best brisket I've had in NYC, and I've been to most of the BBQ spots in the city. The Mac and cheese is ofcourse other worldly, it's the same guy who owns elbow room in Barclays. Had the collards which were also excellent. And the corn, make sure you squeeze the lime on the corn, its crazy good. My new favorite spot in the neighborhood for sure. Easy five stars.",5.0

"I give the food here 4 stars. However, prices are a little high. When I order a $14 sandwich I expect a nice size portion, not a small burger bun with a few slices of sausage and some pulled pork. It was tasty but over priced IMO. Service was very good. Morgans is definitely worth a visit but be prepared for the bill...",3.0
"Fantastic fatty brisket!!! I am a life long lover of BBQ and everything I ate here, potato salad, collard greens, big ole salad, brisket and beef ribs...AMAZING!",5.0
Closest BBQ to Texas I've had outside of Texas! And... those beans are the real deal. Like straight out of the RGV. Brought me back to a long lost home.,5.0
"When we first walked in, we didn't know where to sit because there was no staff available to help.  We then waited for someone to come.  They sat us in the back, right next to the loud speaker.  The music was so loud, we could barely hear each other talk.  Because Elbow Room and Morgans shared a kitchen, we thought that we could also order from that menu, but we couldn't.  I was hoping to order the pulled pork from the menu, but they were out.  We ended up ordering a sweet potato, collard greens, ribs, and briscuit.  The waitress said that this would be enough food for the right three of us.  Once we got the food and tried the collard greens, our mouths were on fire.  There wasn't much meat and all the food was put together on one tray, without any plates.  The meat had too much fat and it almost wasn't enough food.  I would not recommend going here.",3.0
"Finally, real Texas BBQ in New York! We had the pork ribs (amazing), fatty brisket (tender and flavorful), and sides of mac and cheese (ever been to the Elbow Room? Same kitchen, so @#$%ing good!) and cole slaw (addicting). Our server, Ashley, was so sweet and cute (and from Texas to boot! Do they import all their servers along with their pitmaster?) and took great care of us, you should hope she's there when you visit! All in all, 5/5 on food, decor, service, and will be there again soon... go now before the word gets out and it gets too crowded!",5.0
"My girlfriend and I stopped by today during their soft-opening. Our server Jennifer was friendly and attentive, and the food was overall quite tasty. Specifically:- Brisket (you can get fatty or lean; we chose fatty). This was the highlight of the meal: juicy and well-seasoned (though it teeters on the edge of being too salty).- Pork ribs. These were good, but not nearly as good as the brisket.- Collards. Very tasty, but almost too spicy.- Mac 'n cheese. Good and creamy, but a little bland for my taste.- Cornbread. Delicious.- Sweet tea: Extremely sweet but still good.Overall, it was really good BBQ, and I will definitely be going back.",4.0
"Dropped by here yesterday since we've been wanting to try this place out for some time now - really glad we did. I'm no BBQ expert, but this was some of the tastiest stuff I've eaten in a long time. We had the fatty brisket, turkey, pork sausage, pork ribs, big ole salad, Texas two step (bourbon drink) and a jalapeño vodka drink. Everything tasted great! I don't know how long they smoke their meat, but everything was really tender and full of flavor. We'll definitely be going back there to try their other menu items (plus I thought it was very reasonably priced). If you haven't tried it out, I'd definitely suggest it. Just be aware that you can only get sandwiches and sides until 5pm - the full menu starts after 5 (at least on Saturdays, not sure about any other day).",5.0
Pork ribs and fatty brisket were the stars. The smoky queso appetizer was also fantastic. The waitstaff was very friendly/prompt and seemed very knowledgeable re food & drinks.,5.0
"went with friends and, as a group, shared the pork ribs, brisket, turkey, mac & cheese, and collard greens, plus the pecan pie and peach blueberry cobbler for dessert.  everything was very good but there was no consensus among the four of us of which was our favorite -- one of my friends liked the ribs best, two of my friends liked the brisket best, and i actually liked the turkey best -- which was shocking even to me.  (not that i don't like turkey but i love pork and i love beef, and i thought the turkey was going to be a throwaway entree, but it was actually seasoned wonderfully and really moist -- so, as shocked as i was, it was my favorite of the three entrees.  everything was delicious, though i tend to prefer a saucier rib, personally.)  mac & cheese was meh, collard greens were fine.  pecan pie was very good, cobbler was ok.  also, our waitress was great -- personable and friendly, attentive and efficient, and yet never making us feel like we were being rushed out the door despite how many people were waiting for a table.my only complaint is that, as a non-beer-drinker, i wish there were more options on drinks.  their bar actually looked like it had been halfheartedly stocked, but that might have changed since i was there, it could've been a temporary thing.all in all, definitely tasty, and definitely go with a few people so you can try multiple things.",4.0
"Best BBQ in Brooklyn, hands down. No competition. I feel so strongly about this, that I am literally writing the review while I sit here. We had the brisket, pulled pork, beef sausage, beef tacos, jerk Mac n cheese, and chili. The tacos were a mistake, but the owner gave them to us any way and I most say I'm glad he did.  We couldn't even get through half of our meal because we ordered enough for a small army, but I'm excited about my leftovers. The brisket is indescribable really...come eat it for yourself. Oh and no sauce needed, but it is tasty if you are in to that. The chili is probably some of the best I've ever had. I could go on, but I won't. Everything is AMAZING. The owner actually asked us if we wanted to move because a more comfortable seat had opened up. How considerate is that? Great bar menu. I can't say enough nice things. We will definitely be back. Awesome edition to the area. Bravo.",5.0
"Went here last week for brisket and collards. 5 stars for brisket, 5 stars for service, 2 stars for greens. It seems silly to have another BBQ place within walking distance of Dinosaur, but if you don't feel like waiting for two hours, this is a good option!",4.0
"Awesome BBQ and mac and cheese here! As someone who goes to school in NC I very much enjoyed the ribs, fatty brisket, and pulled pork (their BBQ sauce is excellent as well). Also some really cool mac and cheese flavors (we had the original but still great) and a good variety of sides/desserts. Pecan pie was also delicious!",4.0
"Went on a Saturday night with 2 friends and only waited 20 minutes for a table. Everyone was really friendly and helpful, and the food was awesome. Sides weren't anything too special, but the meat, especially the beef rib, was some of the best barbecue I've ever had. Very reasonable prices, too! I can't believe it took me this long to try this place, I'll definitely be back.",5.0
"Good service. Decent BBQ for NYC. Far too salty. As a southerner from Memphis and the Texas hill country it didn't fill me full of rage. Would get 4 stars if the beer wasn't served in Mason jars, which is stupid and kitschy. Best sauce I've had in NYC. Best meat tried was the pulled pork. EXCELLENT spicy collards.",3.0
i was quite surprised the the BBQ was GREAT! you wont be disappointed there. the staff is very welcoming and they make the experience fun. I will be going back here.,4.0

They just started brunch and I'm really excited to try a lot of the new items. We're serious about our BBQ so we're really happy they opened in our neighborhood. In response to some reviews below, they took a little time to find out how much food they needed and to get the staff running, which is why some people fielded those complaints, but it is by no means on a regular basis. They run very well and they have catered to our every need.",5.0

"Finding amazing BBQ is difficult in NYC.  I still prefer Hill Country and Fette Sau but these are not the closest destinations when you live in the Slope.  I finally got around to checking out Morgan's BBQ this week.  I got the fatty brisket.  It was pretty good.  Some bits were too salty though which was disappointing.  I got a huge fat hunk with virtually no meat which was also disappointing.  At these prices, you don't want a slice that is mostly fat.  I had the mac 'n cheese and collard greens.  They don't sell green beans anymore or so they say.  That was disappointing as well.  The mac 'n cheese was ok.  It needed more of a cheesy flavor.  The collard greens were more disappointing.  They tasted like warm spicy shredded pickles.  I've never had collard greens like that.  It was like someone cooked it with pure vinegar and jalapenos.  The corn bread was fine.  The jam was ok.  I've had better.  Personally, I don't think corn bread and white bread should be fancy.  3 bucks for a small hunk is a little ridiculous.  The space itself is on par for the area.  The service is fast and friendly so kudos for that.  Since it's the closest BBQ in my area, I'll probably break down and go there when I'm in the mood for some BBQ.  And I definitely like the idea of it being open late with a limited menu but it's not on my short list of places to go now that it's off my list of to-do's.",2.0
"I decided to write this review after eating at a different barbecue restaurant, need not mention their name.  The brisket at Morgan's is smoky and peppery, juicy and moist....oh man, and the bark....  I'm so full but my mouth is watering just thinking about.  There really isn't another place quite like it, the waitstaff is friendly and helpful, the bartenders are cute and clever, and Pitmaster is serious about his barbecue.  I still haven't even mentioned the ribs... The meat falls right off the bone, I could have eaten an entire rack.  I'm starting to sound like a carnivore.  I'll save the vegetables for my next visit/review.",5.0

"Ok, I'm all for rules but sometime s they just make no sense. I've had the mac an cheese to go and really liked it. This time I wanted to sit and eat. Well you can only get one kind of the many types of Mac if you want to eat at the restaurant and you can't get it to go and sit and order drinks or other food. They had  only 3 or 4 of the 15 to 20 tables occupied and turned away customers who would spend additional money on drinks etc.. Sorry I just don't understand.

"The staff here are really, really nice and probably the best part, but the 'cue didn't do it for me tonight. ""Fatty"" brisket was lean, dry, and not fresh. You go to Hill Country or Mighty Quinns to get brisket and it tastes like the meat just came off the smoker. Unfortunately Morgan's doesn't come close to achieving that. Beef sausage tasted pretty good, but it was cut up into small pieces and all the juice and fat had run out before I took my first bite. It was like eating sawdust. This is easy to fix: give the grown ups a knife and let them cut it up. The best food was the sides, slaw was really nice, pinto beans were awesome. I knew eating here wasn't going to be the second coming of Christ, but I expected more than what I got.",2.0
"As a native Texan, I'm picky about my BBQ, and was skeptical when I heard a Texas BBQ joint was opening in the neighborhood. Needless to say, I had to go the week it opened. Since then, I have eaten at Morgan's almost once a week. Willie Nelson ought to write a song about it, it's that good. The meats are cooked to perfection, the sauce is just right - not too sweet or too vinegary like in some other (inferior) states, and the service is quick and friendly. I would be willing to wager it's the only place north of the Mason Dixon that serves both Frito Pie and Shiner Bock on draft, two Texas favorites. The sides are all good, from green bean casserole to the stuffed baked potato, and the desserts are simple, but done right (don't miss the bourbon pecan pie). My only request is that they serve more pickles, especially with the pulled pork (they're available if you ask). Overall, this is a terrific addition to the Brooklyn restaurant scene - a legit slice of the Lone Star State.",5.0
"The food was really good- fatty brisket very flavorful and the ribs- soooo good.  Smoked the way they should be with a real texas dry rub.   Lean, fall off the bone, tender- you don't feel gross after eating them like some places around here.  They actually reminded me exactly of the ribs I get when visiting the in-laws in texas.  Mac & cheese and slaw were good, collards were very vinegar-y but still good.  Sadly they were out of the green-bean casserole, which was disappointing (it was also only 6:00 at night and not yet full when we ordered).  Our server was super friendly and checked on us a lot, but the kitchen or someone forgot our mac & cheese and we had to ask for it.  It's a cute spot and had nice out-door seating, I would absolutely go back.  Maybe a little expensive for bbq, but not terrible.",4.0
