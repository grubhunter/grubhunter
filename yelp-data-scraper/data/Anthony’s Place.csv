"Great place, wonderful staff and homemade wine, that will keep you coming back any chance you get.This trip, our table ordered...Apps: AWESOME garlic knots, calamari, stuffed artichoke and saladsDinner: A garlic oil and prosciutto pasta, their special- a stuffed fish (halibut I believe) and 2 chicken marsalas.Dessert- Zepolles, Berry tart, chocolate mousse cake! (Looks like a chocolate cheesecake, but its not and a million times more creamy and yummy)Drinks- BEST HOMEMADE WINE EVER (sorry Italian family) and espresso with Sambuka! (If you've never tried it, it's a must! Sambuka is an anise flavored liquor, which makes the PERFECT after dinner drink)OverallIt's a perfect place for every occasion, and I may say some of the best Italian I've found in Brooklyn! People aren't kidding about the wine though...bring a designated driver. It's so good you forget there is even alcohol in it. My only thing that was so-so was the marsala dishes. Though it was good, it wasn't the chicken marsala my Italian friend and I were expecting flavor wise. Now every family is different, and may vary by region, but neither of us were too excited by it. There was a different taste to it, like it maybe had cumin in it? Anyway, last advice is to save room for dessert! Every one was amazing. And the fact they make the zeppoles in small bite size pieces, it made it perfect for sharing.I highly suggest everyone check it out! *I heard they're opening a second location...woo hoo!*",5.0
Can't believe I've never  been here ...well finally got around to it for a friend's bday the other night...Home made wine -sweet and awesome Garlic knots - yum Mixed antipasto -goodZucchini and mushrooms were great eggplant was so good we ordered more for the main... seafood was mehFried Mozzarella - can't go wrong Black pasta with seafood -goodSeafood quality was just ok but pasta was done to perfectionEggplant Rollatini- love! Homemade ricotta Chicken parm - goodCannoli  for the bday girl - also very good Service - felt like part of the family Total was a little over 120 for all of the above,4.0
I find it pretty good. So far having just lunch though to avoid the busy life of dinner. The service from Anthony (jr) is awesome. The food is spectacular in my opinion,5.0
"It's okay. I would say it's a great option for the area since there isn't really any other place like this. I got the squid ink linguini and it fell short of my expectations the texture felt plasticky. The seafood that came with it was good, however. Also ordered the black mussels and they were good but could have used more flavor in the soup (more garlic or butter) but was also a bit on the salty side for me. Also ordered Bob salad which just means it's cut into smaller pieces and it was alright.",3.0
We ordered food from here to go so this is based on at-home taste-testing.Never had a filet parm so I thought I would try it with pasta. It's a fried filet with spaghetti. I enjoyed the flavor of the fish though I would not typically pair that with spaghetti. The bf got an eggplant parm with pasta and thought it was pretty good too. We enjoyed the sauce and the flavors and would come back :),4.0
"FROM HOMEMADE WINE (who does that?) to PIZZA & moreMY BROOKLYN FAMILY & FRIENDS have been coming here for many moons!My brother Pete (Moose) has been coming here forever, he hates going out to eat, but this one of those rare exceptions.  My poor mom who is now in Coney Island Hospital (where they usually do what they do best...that is screw-up), used to come with her friends, but soon no more, since she will be going to hospice.Anyway, my mom & her senior cronies, used to come here while they were still alive & kicking.Even though they the split almost everything, and were as frugal (or cheap) as can be, the owners & workers (bless their soul) welcomed them with an open heart.  Their kindness should not be forgotten.When I visited my family to help out, my brother insisted that my wife & I go here with him.  He claimed that they had fantastic homemade Italian food, and that they loved him.He was right on both accounts, it seems.  As usual,  I ordered a plethora of all kinds of goodies (see pics), and all was outstanding.My wife especially loved the vegetarian Pizza, which is usually difficult for most places to getnice & crispy, as well as, tasty.This place has been there many years & is really a throw back to the happier days of yore.Since my mom was so extremely ill, it was hard to cheer us up, but these wonderful people & their food, managed to take us away from our misery, at least, for a few precise hours.Since I do not yet know my fate of my brother after my mom is gone, I am not sure if we will ever have the pleasure of dinning here again.  My brother now has a house that is only a few blocks away, but he is likely to relocate to Florida.What else is new for NYers (& others who want to go to tax friendly state)?Unfortunately for him (& maybe for us in the future), Florida is unlikely to have an old schoolItalian place right down the street.  If it did, I would be afraid to walk there, since I do not wantto become an appetizer for neither bugs nor gators.",5.0
"I have only gotten delivery or take out here, never eaten in the restaurant. I recently ordered delivery, and I was really impressed with the customer service. Usually I have found the staff at places like this to rush you and be somewhat rude, but not here. For example, I could not hear my phone ringing when the delivery person arrived. I felt HORRIBLE after I saw three missed phone calls. When I called the restaurant back, the woman who answered the phone was very sweet and alerted me that the delivery person was still in my lobby. I expected him to be angry, but he was very nice and patient, a wonderful human being! I tried to tip him extra for being so cool. I'm really impressed by the service. I've had the fettuccine alfredo here and it was very good, so creamy! Really excellent and flavorful. You also get a great sized portion, leftovers for two days every time!  The garlic knots are great, addicting. The chicken francese is good with a rich and flavorful taste, and so is the chicken parmigiana. I have to say I was not impressed with my chicken marsala. The chicken tasted off, almost like the chicken you find in a lean cuisine meal, and the sauce was heavy with no real marsala flavor.",4.0
"Been a few years, time for an update. My family still loves Anthony's! It continues to be the right combination of excellent Italian food, warm welcoming homeyness, and reasonable prices that makes it a perfect restaurant for family dinners with the kids & grandparents. We recently tried their homemade red wine, and it's great -- tastes a bit on the sweet side and gives you a good buzz. It's a big plus that they take reservations for our large group, and when we arrive the table's been set up and we don't wait. We appreciate Anthony's even more now because they've been so wonderfully consistent while other Italian places we know have tended to go downhill.",5.0

"Ok. You won me over. So I asked for eggplant parm, I ask for less cheese (blasphemy, I know) and I get a super filled eggplant parm with less cheese. I don't want any extra carbs, so the place offers me a side salad, which hit the spot, and was a great compliment to the parm!!!The price is right too.",5.0
"Delicious food, but the customer service is horrible! We called to make reservations and was on hold for 10 minutes. We came in for our reservation for 9 and were not seated till 9:30. While two couples who came in just before we did were able to sit first once seats were available. The whole time we sat in the front waiting to be seated, not one worker came over to apologize. It's supposed to be a nice friendly and welcoming place and I did not feel that way tonight. I am very disappointed. I am not sure if I will ever return until they reevaluate their workers and their customer service skills.",1.0

The chicken parm is very good too but not as good as the other 2. People are raving about the fried mozzarella but to me it's pretty standard. I would save room for the entree and dessert.",4.0

"Q the food at Anthony's is consistently good but today Anthony prepared a homemade pasta with apples and chestnuts and it was the best we ever had, unbelievable",5.0
"My boyfriend and I discovered this place about 2 years ago, when we were lucky enough to catch one of their groupon deals.   While I do love groupons, there aren't too many restaurants that I come back to over and over again.  However, Anthony's place is just great, and super convenience since it is not too far from us.It is really small, so I do recommend making a reservation. The service is always quick and friendly. The food is good and traditional (I especially love their sauces). Whenever groups or people (from work or leisure) come to visit us, we usually take them here and they love it. Good stuff!",5.0
"This place is always the tops with me. My brother was in from California and wanted to have a meal with me and my family (wife, 2 young daughters) last week and of course it had to be Anthony's (formally the Pizza Bowl). We ordered some of our favs like Veal parm ( recommended my brother order the Veal parm Special) (it is veal parm with peppers, eggplant topping to the normal delicious veal parm) as well as bowl of mussels (OMG there must have been like 60 mussels in the place) as well as fried mozzarella. Anthony himself came out  with a delicious extra treat (meatballs stuffed with ham I believe) which were amazing of course. I only live about 2 blocks from this amazing place and count myself lucky to have a place that values the people AND the food as much as Anthony does.BTW, the food is delicious everything always tastes fresh and you leave smiling for a week. Prices very reasonable for the quality you get. the specials are a big more but hey that's why they are specials. Oh and the garlic knots on the table as you sit down are legendary as well. Also the homemade wine is delicious if you are so inclined.",5.0

"The food here is average with small portions.  $13 for an arugula and goat cheese salad would be fine if the portion was decent and there was adequate goat cheese.  Not so here, and it didn't even taste that good.  My shrimp fra diavolo was almost too spicy to eat and was covered with mozzarella.  I did not like their homemade red wine.....it was much too sweet.  My date's lasagna was served in one of those oval shaped single serve baking metal pans with an oval shaped dish under it.  I could see the disappointment in my date's face.  It was an awful presentation, like we were in a diner or cafeteria.  It should have been served on a plate.  Again, it was a very small portion.  I was embarrassed because I recommended this place, but I have never been here before.  I wanted to try it since it's in my neighborhood.  I don't like this place and will not return.  There are so many good Italian restaurants in Brooklyn, why bother with this one.  The only things I liked is that they serve garlic knots along with the bread, and the service is good.",2.0
"LOVE this place. their italian food is authentic. their stuffed artichokes could feed an army and are awesome.

Now with the background being set, I have not eaten at this place in over 20 years and I must say it still has it.

"My family ordered takeout here after the restaurant we were originally planning to go to closed early (and our favorite Italian place in the neighborhood is closed due to Sandy).  My mother immediately remembered this place as a restaurant she used to frequent with her girlfriends over 15 years ago.  She said the decor hasn't changed at all: wood paneling on the walls, pictures of famous Italian Americans dispersed everywhere, etc. A typical casual Italian restaurant atmosphere, with about 7-8 tables.  Very small.We were only ordering takeout to begin with but it was a good thing we didn't plan to eat in: on a Saturday night, the restaurant was full.  The only tables that were open were ""reserved"" for long-standing guests.  Don't just plan to walk in on a weekend--this place may look like a dime-a-dozen Italian joint, but its customers are loyal as hell!  I guess you don't stay in business for 20 years without that level of customer appreciation and loyalty.Our orders were pretty typical: Shrimp Francaise, Seafood Fra Diavolo, Chicken Parmesan.  The best meal was the Chicken Parm: perfectly breaded cutlet with lots of cheese and a flavorful, thick sauce.  The Shrimp Francaise could have used more garlic in the sauce, and the Fra Diavolo was only marginally spicy.  Both seafood dishes, however, had big, plump shrimp that tasted fresh, which is more important than the spiciness of the sauce.  The order came with a big bag of fresh Italian bread and garlic knots, which were absolutely delicious.Because it was a Saturday night and we didn't order ahead of time, we waited quite a long time to get our order.  I didn't time it, but I would say over 1/2 hour.  We grumbled a bit about the wait, but it does mean that our food was cooked and prepared fresh to order, which is a good quality for a restaurant.  All in all, the wait was the worst part of the experience, and I would certainly order here again.",4.0
"What can I say. Fresh. Perfect consistency. Fantastic neighborhood service. I'm almost reluctant to review because I'm afraid everyone will come here! But I have to shout out because they are good people, and I am Italian and this GOOD Italian.",5.0
"My all time favorite restaurant. A great neighborhood joint, everything here is excellent. The staff is friendly, and each dish is made to order. Authentic Italian food. Great garlic knots, baked clams, and really everything. I've never had anything here that I didn't enjoy. They're also one of the few restaurants that don't hike their prices on various holiday dinners (Valentine's Day, Mother's Day, Father's Day).",5.0
"Oh my god, where do I even begin? I'd give it a 10 star rating if it was possible!!! Their food is absolutely finger-licking-good! The best chicken Caesar salad I've ever had! Their mozzarella sticks are to die for. Hero's and entrees are amazing! Lunch menu is as cheap as you can get and the food is fantastic!! Very quickly made. It doesn't even matter that they don't deliver, it's worth coming there just to interact with the staff! Cindy is my favorite! Always pleasant and friendly. The place feels like home, ALWAYS! You have to check it out if you want a nice home made food!!!",5.0
I'm shocked that this place has such high ratings. The service wasn't that great. It took awhile for the waitress to take our order. After she dropped off our food she never even came by to check how we were doing. We also had to ask for the check several times and it wasn't even that busy. I ordered a strawberry salad and the strawberries weren't hulled so I had to cut out the inner stem before eating them. There was way too much vinagrette. Considering it was a $12 salad I expected it to be better. The fried calamari was bland. We had to drench it with marinara sauce. The only thing I did enjoy was the red clam sauce. It would have been sad if they messed that one up.,2.0

"Eating at Anthony's is kind of like eating at your friend's Grandma's house. Neighbors mill in and out, yelling compliments to the chef and discussing their favorite dishes. Everyone's relaxed and welcoming. The atmosphere is very casual, but it's clear that EVERYONE is happy to be there. Last night my husband and I stopped by around 6:30p- the restaurant was about half-full. We were given a basket of bread and some seriously delicious garlic knots while we waited for our meals. The waitstaff was friendly and genuine.Our entrees were fantastic- the hubs got a white pizza with the most delicious pesto my mouth has ever had the privilege of eating- the basil was so fresh it was still sweet, perfectly tempered with rich olive oil, tangy garlic and creamy pinenuts. The crust was perfection- chewy, crispy, lightly-browned happiness. I ordered a pasta combo- stuffed shells (traditional deliciousness), rolled eggplant (stuffed with ricotta, breaded and fried and a spinach crepe, smothered in the fabulous house sauce and covered with cheese.  Between the generously sized portions and the delicious bread basket, we left in a severe food coma, mine slightly worse than his, because he wimped-out before me so I ate the last two slices of his pizza... shhhh....My husband and I had been to Anthony's once previously and loved the experience- it was quiet, Anthony himself waited on us and the lunch prices are unbelievably low for such huge portions.A nice, homey, feel-good joint with slammin' Italian comfort classics. Do not come here if you're on a diet. Do come here if you want a happy belly.",5.0
"Around 8pm on Friday, Anthony's was full but not packed. We got a table as soon as we came in and we gave our waitress a heads up about having a Groupon. The exchange that follows is mind-boggling.Waitress: You need to make reservations if you have a Groupon. It even says so on the Groupon.Friend: I know, I called 2.5 hours ago to see if I can make reservations and the woman who picked up the phone told me to just come in and bring the Groupon.Waitress: I'm the only woman working here.  Friend: ...I must have spoken to you...Waitress: You need reservations but I'll take it THIS TIME.Friend: ...So... You told us to come in, no reservations required, and now you are changing the story and acting like you are doing us a favor by taking a Groupon? Thanks...?We order 2 appetizers (buffalo calamari and stuffed mushrooms). The calamari is very tender and the mushrooms are okay. We ask for glasses of water 4 times before they are finally brought to the table.The entrees are okay -- shrimp fra diavolo (I liked the spicy marinara sauce and the shrimp were perfectly cooked but it had a layer of melted mozzarella that it didn't need), mussels over angel hair pasta in white sauce (okay), ziti special (eh), and a shrimp parm which my husband found to be mediocre. All in all, the food is okay. Nothing I couldn't make at home for a fraction of the price.To prove that she truly has a winning personality, the waitress totally padded the bill! Our entrees were suddenly $2 more than they were on the menu. We didn't even bother questioning her and just left a tip based on the prices on the menu, although, now that I think about it, I don't think she really deserved a tip. Definitely not a dining experience worth repeating.",1.0

I have never had anything bad here...I recommend this place to everyone who will listen and if I could I'd buy stock in the place. The chef will make off menu items if available as well. There's a sometime special of pork chops with hot cherry peppers which will blow your mind. He will make it for me when not on the board... Props Anthony! The Buffalo Calamari I haven't had anywhere else and it is slamming, he serves rings only, no tentacles because they turn off some American palates, he'll use them in a fish sauce so as not to waste them. The house salad kicks ass, the mozzarella and tomato salad is delish. Other faves include the pastas of any kind... Linguine with clam sauce, stuffed pastas like manicotti, lasagna, ravioli... garlic knots and bread is served on the table complimentary. Desert unfortunately is nothing special.... Sorry.You will not be disappointed... And if you are the staff or chef Anthony himself WILL make it right!",5.0
"Best Italian food ever!!I used to live five minutes away and literally ate here or ordered in about four times a week.  I have since moved out of Brooklyn and whenever i go back the food never seems to disappoint.  The owner and his wife still remember me and the new waitresses and bus boys are just as friendly.  It is a little more crowded and noisier than it used to be, but the food is delicious so i don't mind.You start off with a bread basket.  This basket contains the best garlic knots i have ever encountered.  There is also regular italian bread, and sometimes they will bring out pizza bread, but the garlic knots top everything. I took a bag home from this weekend and they are in my freezer bc they are that good.Then depending on your entree, it comes with a house salad.  This is the best house salad I've ever had also.  It is just salad, but their dressing is what makes it.  If i could buy a bottle of it i would probably eat salad every day.On to appetizers..If you want to order appetizers I'd recommend the fried zucchini or fried raviolis. I ordered their fried zucchini the other night and was pleasantly surprised. I'd forgotten how much i liked theirs.The entree menu is pretty standard for an italian place, but the food is way above average.  And their specials menu really is special - so many different options you don't normally see.Seriously everything here is delicious.  I havent had the dessert in a long time, so I cant say anything about that.  I'm sure that is all good too though.They are closed on Mondays and Tuesdays, and you might need dinner reservations for the other nights.Enjoy!",5.0
"Anthony's Place provides a very casual and comfortable setting with excellent food and service.  My avocado and shrimp salad appetizer was fantastic.  The veal marsala was outstanding with a side of sautéed zucchini.  I tried a glass of the homemade red wine and it was wonderful.  Finished off with the best cappuccino I've ever had, and a tortoni.  I could not recommend this restaurant more highly.  It's a jewel in Sheepshead Bay.  Anthony and his wife make everyone feel right at home.  You must stop in for a meal!",5.0

There's something about the dressing that is just so on point. The garlic knots are fantastic too.This has been my go-to place every winter. I especially enjoy a hot bowl of soup while watching the snow fall outside.It's been awhile since I've been back here, and the prices have definitely gone up a bit, but I'm planning to return here soon.",4.0

The Buffalo Calamari I haven't had anywhere else and it is slamming, he serves rings only, no tentacles because they turn off some American palates, he'll use them in a fish sauce so as not to waste them. The house salad kicks ass, the mozzarella and tomato salad is delish. Other faves include the pastas of any kind... Linguine with clam sauce, stuffed pastas like manicotti, lasagna, ravioli... garlic knots and bread is served on the table complimentary. Desert unfortunately is nothing special.... Sorry.You will not be disappointed... And if you are the staff or chef Anthony himself WILL make it right!",5.0
"Best Italian food ever!!I used to live five minutes away and literally ate here or ordered in about four times a week.  I have since moved out of Brooklyn and whenever i go back the food never seems to disappoint.  The owner and his wife still remember me and the new waitresses and bus boys are just as friendly.  It is a little more crowded and noisier than it used to be, but the food is delicious so i don't mind.You start off with a bread basket.  This basket contains the best garlic knots i have ever encountered.  There is also regular italian bread, and sometimes they will bring out pizza bread, but the garlic knots top everything. I took a bag home from this weekend and they are in my freezer bc they are that good.Then depending on your entree, it comes with a house salad.  This is the best house salad I've ever had also.  It is just salad, but their dressing is what makes it.  If i could buy a bottle of it i would probably eat salad every day.On to appetizers..If you want to order appetizers I'd recommend the fried zucchini or fried raviolis. I ordered their fried zucchini the other night and was pleasantly surprised. I'd forgotten how much i liked theirs.The entree menu is pretty standard for an italian place, but the food is way above average.  And their specials menu really is special - so many different options you don't normally see.Seriously everything here is delicious.  I havent had the dessert in a long time, so I cant say anything about that.  I'm sure that is all good too though.They are closed on Mondays and Tuesdays, and you might need dinner reservations for the other nights.Enjoy!",5.0
"Anthony's Place provides a very casual and comfortable setting with excellent food and service.  My avocado and shrimp salad appetizer was fantastic.  The veal marsala was outstanding with a side of sautéed zucchini.  I tried a glass of the homemade red wine and it was wonderful.  Finished off with the best cappuccino I've ever had, and a tortoni.  I could not recommend this restaurant more highly.  It's a jewel in Sheepshead Bay.  Anthony and his wife make everyone feel right at home.  You must stop in for a meal!",5.0
Very nice people running the place and good service. Food was alright but kind of a letdown because of all the 5 star reviews here on yelp.,3.0
"4.5 starsI've been going to Anthony's since it was called Pizza Bowl (over 10 years ago). The food was great then, and it's great now. They prepare one of my favorite caesar salads. There's something about the dressing that is just so on point. The garlic knots are fantastic too.This has been my go-to place every winter. I especially enjoy a hot bowl of soup while watching the snow fall outside.It's been awhile since I've been back here, and the prices have definitely gone up a bit, but I'm planning to return here soon.",4.0
Staff was friendly and helpful. Prices are reasonable and the food tastes great. Portions could be a bit larger. Bread and garlic rolls were unlimited. I enjoyed my pasta and we both loved the appetizers. Shrimp Arreganato was good but had more oil than I am used to.,3.0
"I went here for the first time in years with my 2 small children and my husband. It is a great homey family restaurant. The service was so nice and the food was great. I am a big fan of the ""Bob Salad""we'll be back",4.0
Was there last night me my wife & two close friends food was excellent never had before tasty baked clams like Anthony's also the mussel bowl hit the spot shrimp scampi was delicious too but from my side it need more touch of white wine the secret is in his bread crumb fresh tasty crunchy best bread crumb ever taste also I don't want to forget their shrimp avocado salad but don't be surprise if they don't have finally their tiramisu is very tasty good to try this place,5.0
"The only reason why I ever set foot into this restaurant was because my friends worked there as busboys. I know the staff--so of course they were friendly to me but I noticed that they treat all their customers as friends too. It's a casual and friendly environment.I got to go into the kitchen area and see everything in the works. I met Anthony and a bunch of other people whose names I cannot recall. From what I could see, everything was clean and organized.",4.0

"Our neighbors introduced us to this restaurant.  I loved the atmosphere - the decor and coziness of the place.  I loved the Beet and Goat cheese salad, have not stopped thinking about it..  The shrimp and pasta in a pink sauce was scrumptious.  I plan on returning to try out other things on the menu.  Oh Yea - ran into other people we knew while dining.  Whether your dining alone or with friends you will feel at home.",4.0
"I have technically been eating here since I was in the womb!  My parents started eating here when they first got married in the 1970s.  It was called Pizza Bowl then, and was owned by Dominick.  If you ask my parents, they will tell you that Dominick ""invented garlic knots.""  Now, I don't know if this is true, but it just might be.Many years later, when Dominick retired, he sold the restaurant to his chef, Anthony (the current owner).Its a great little neighborhood restaurant, with incredible food and good service.My favorites: the garlic knots (of course!), their homemade fried mozzarella, the lasagna and the chicken parmigiana.",5.0
"now this is a old time, hole in the wall kind of place. Anthony is at one of the tables with his wife reading newspapers as you walk in early enough. It's a small, cozy, simple atmosphere that serves straight forward italian food. actually.. they have unique hot heros i've never heard of before. all under nine dollars.",5.0

Just order the Shrimp Parm dinner.....best ever....great chicken marsala too!,5.0
"I love this place. The atmosphere is comfortable, like you'd want at a favorite neighborhood restaurant.  The wait staff are the best, super sweet. Even the owner/chef is a great, friendly guy, who will come out and bring little extras: fried zucchini, cookies, or wine.  The food is consistently delicious, satisfying and a good deal.  I love the white pizza, stuffed rigatoni, shrimp francese, the red wines, all the desserts, and the cappuccinos.  Everything else is great too, but I have a hard time tearing myself away from my usuals.Anthony's is my go-to place when I need somewhere reliable.  I've gone here with groups of people, on dates, with family and friends. I have a ball every time.",5.0
"The place is great. The homey atmosphere, great service, delicious food, fair pricing all make this restaurant fantastic. I'm from Westchester and my in-laws live in the Sheepshead Bay area. They've been to Anthony's before and I'm glad they suggested it. We had no reservations and it was Saturday night around 8pm. The place was crowded, but they still sat us right away. The garlic knots came quickly and as we devoured them, they kept coming. Our main dishes were all excellent with a home made, fresh taste and feel. I wish there was a place like Anthony's in my area. I will be back, even if it means hanging out with my in-laws (they're great people anyway).",5.0
"Bought a groupon to this place and the service was excellent. The people were very down to earth and you could tell it was a very home style family owned place. We ordered stuffed artichoke and fried calamari as appetizers , both were delicious!! We then ordered 4 entrees, the veal parmagiano, chicken parmagiano special, boneless chicken and fish fillet. Like I said before the service was excellent, and the food came pretty quick. You could tell that the food was freshly cooked and made. It all tasted delicious! The garlic knots were great too! I recommend this place to everyone. Will definitely be coming here again!",5.0
"The best italian place in the neighborhood. Small restaurant where the staff treats you like family. Their appetizers are great! Stuffed mushrooms and buffalo calamari are a must. Entrees are great too~ haven't had a bad dish yet, though there is nothing special about the personal pizzas. Their lunch sandwiches are also excellent.",5.0
