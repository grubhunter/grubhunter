"Super hip, slightly pretentious cafe on Fulton St is a popular destination for young professionals.Think the ""Friends"" coffee shop, no diversity and everyone is too cool for the room.Decent coffee and excellent small plates, fresh and tasty,  I highly recommend the food.Very friendly and prompt service, attentive and kind, high marks for service!!!!Typical terrible art for sale on the walls but not a distraction.Two bathrooms are clean and convenient.Very nice old building houses this shop, stop in and enjoy!!!",5.0
Really good spot for a low-key breakfast/brunch/lunch or just coffee. Food is fairly priced and fresh. Nice atmosphere. Phenomenal almond croissant! Seating can be a challenge when there are 11 freelance somethingrathers working here.,4.0
"What a lovely café (aside from the slight aroma of b-o near the cashier :/). The price is right, the setting welcoming, and service is quick.  Local art hangs on the rustic brick walls. There are coffee shop style seats and couches in the front followed by a long bar with stool seating and tables and chairs in the rear. Service is fast and friendly. Eats: there is something for every eater- omnivore, vegan, and gluten-free. French-inspired pastries for a quick sweet bite, sandwiches, salads, and larger meals. The fig, pear, and goat cheese salad though light is loaded with creamy goat cheese. The veggie chili mac is a perfect stick-to-your-ribs comfort food: mac n cheese topped with bean loaded chili and a dollop of goat cheese. Drinks: alcohol, soft drinks, coffee, and tea. I had a very nicely frothed almond milk cappuccino.",4.0

"Very cute cafe with an even cuter outdoor seating area. Came here to do some work, which to no surprise, so did the rest of the neighborhood. All good because there were plenty seats for everyone! The fig salad was a light size portion but was delicious. You order at the bar and they'll call out your food/drink when it's ready. Besides the usual staples every cafe has, this one also serves some alcoholic beverages. Thumbs up to that!",5.0

"Everything bagel with lox and the works was EVERYTHING!!!Dirty Soy Chai Latte OMG.So amazingly good, presentation popped, portioned well.

Love this place, amazing humor and loved everything that went into my vessel that night!",5.0
"Lemonade apple ginger freshly made drink. Turkey, avocado with balsamic vinaigrette for $12. I got take out. Order was ready in less than 10 min. I ordered at the bar. $10 min on cards.

"The food and coffee at The Outpost are delicious. I love the egg salad sandwich on crusty bread. It's accompanied by a small fresh salad. Yesterday I had a slice of sweet potato pound cake.

The seating is abundant with an additional area outside to enjoy if the weather is nice. There is free wi-fi too. My only complaint is regarding the service. I waited 10 minutes for my Latté only to find out they forgot about my order. The guy taking the orders was completely disinterested.

Great place to sit down and work for a few hours. The vibe is so great and everyone is so friendly. If the weather permits the garden is just an oasis in a middle of the city.

I dropped by here last night since I was craving coffee and have no idea how to make my way around Brooklyn. A quick yelp search for late night coffee shops bought me here. Parking is very difficult in this area but I managed to snag one. People in Brooklyn don't like to give you some courtesy space when you park so if you're over protective over your bumpers you better think twice.. I ordered a chai latte which was 5 bucks. Was it good? Yes. Was it better than starbucks or dunkin donuts? No. I handed over my card but there was a ten dollar minimum. So I grabbed a bread pudding(resembled a blonde but with some cherry and peaches mixed in) and one of these insanely HUGE chocolate chip cookies. I didn't try them till the next day. Bread pudding was decent but I'm not big on cherry. The cookie was complete crack after hearing it up in the microwave for about 30 seconds. It's literally about an inch high and roughly 4 inches wide. It's more of a scone IMO but it still has the consistency of a cookie.,4.0

"Great outdoor patio, plenty of seating, light, plants, and outlets. Unfortunately there are a lot of smokers on a Friday morning...Ordered the oatmeal, delicious, and a dirty chai latte, also delicious. Would totally come back for the atmosphere!",4.0
"Cute spot on Fulton. The beer and wine options are limited, but it counts that they're there.  It's also super cozy with nice tables and couches inside.  I love places that can transition from day to night via coffee to alcohol, with accompanying snacks, and this place was great for that.  It's kind of a far walk for me so I don't know if I'll trek back anytime soon, but I liked it!",3.0
"Ok..the food is OK and there IS beer and wine which is necessary to calm your nerves.Between the obnoxiously loud terrible pop music, terrible acoustics and the completely useless WiFi (after 30 min I couldn't even check gmail) you'll be glad you at least had a drink while waiting 20min for your sandwich on stale bread. In all fairness, the current staff was nice and I should just know better than to ever come here. This is just a warning so you don't make the same mistake.",2.0
"I live around the corner from Outpost. It's my neighborhood coffee shop. But because they have such a high credit card minimum, I never go. This place is convenient, but it is not a place that should cost $10 to get a cup of coffee and a toasted bagel. This is 2015, Outpost. You are not a pop up shop or a food truck. Lower your cc minimum and maybe you'll get a few more customers.",2.0
"I really love this place... no matter what I say below... just know that I really love this place. One Star - great food. I love the food here. It is also decently priced. Two Stars - Good drinks. I've enjoyed everything I've tried here... I make no claim to be a coffee expert, but I've never retched drinking anything at Outpost. Their hot chocolate/chai lattes are delicious! Three Stars - WiFi reliability/plugs - they have them and they work! Also great tables/chairs to work from. Four Stars - great staff and community feel to the place. Minus One Star - ugh credit card minimum, but they will open a tab for you. Also, the music can eb suuuuuuuuuupppppppppppppeeeeeeerrrrrrrr loud at times. It can overpower your own music/make conversation difficult.",4.0
"Outpost is quickly becoming my favorite cafe in Brooklyn. Affordable-priced drinks, salads and sandwiches, there is plenty of seating and a secret-gardenlike back patio area, which is pretty magical! It's right off the A/C Franklin Ave line in Clinton Hill/ Bed Stuy border. Go there! You won't regret it!",5.0
"plusses, good coffee, nice staff, back patio. minusses, annoying music terrible wifi. I mean really, why bother having wifi if it is going to disconnect every time a new person walks in with a laptop?I'm a computer techie guy for a living. So I can do things to  force a connection. All the regular dorks just have to suffer. And will probably go to a starbucks if they need to work, hunt for jobs or a place to live.",3.0
"This place has great vibes (really, what else are you looking for in a coffee shop?) the coffee is good, although varies depending on the barista. The pastries are on point. It's perfect except for the fact that the music is so f-in loud. I don't understand why.",4.0
"this cafe is incredibly wonderful. It has such a beautiful ambiance. All the people who work here are really sweet. it feels like being at someone's home (or being at the coziest library ever, except there's good music playing and delicious food). I don't understand any criticisms of this place honestly! if you're critiquing the price of the food, well, the food is amazing! it's really fresh and again, delicious. the drinks are great too. my favorites are the juices- I usually get 'the grasshopper.'I would say this is the best cafe in Bedstuy to work at (and I have been to MANY a cafe). I have written essays here, and did a film school application here for a good 2 days and I just got into said school. I've braved snow and rain to get here and it's always worth it. the best cafe!!",5.0

"My favorite cafe in the area. Dope vibe. LGBTQ (yes all 5 letters and more) inviting and welcoming - you can't say that about every place in Brooklyn. Good music (Maxwell on a recent visit). Friendly baristas. Coffee's poppin'. Beautiful little yard to enjoy while the weather's still good for it. RECOMMEND.One thing to note, though, if you want to get work done.

"Very chill place with great decor, friendly staff and outdoor seating. Comfy cafe vibe with people sitting around with laptops (free wifi) and books and the right music to accompany it.

"Outpost has grown on me!  I was last there to meet with a colleague to work. It was during the week, yet the atmosphere was warm and bustling.

It's also a good place to get work done and/or socialize.  There is a nice mix of large, communal tables and smaller ones. The staff is friendly as well. All in all, this place is solid.",4.0

"This is one of the coolest cafes in the BK for work and chill.Not only is the staff attentive and fast but even the patrons are cool and that says alot about a place that can attract people on almost the same energy.  Very diverse, cool playlist and good food.I'd recommend their bagel lox, mozzerella/basil/tomato sandwich, cucumber lemonade and any of the pastries on sight.I've come here for over 2 years...my home away from home (literally 5 blocks)Cheers!",4.0
Went here to  get some work done the other day and I do enjoy the coffee shop. There are a lot of people but also decent sitting space. They have to very very nice backyard which was very cool. When I was there they had this 990s music going and it was kind of annoying.their minimum for credit card is only 10 bucks so that was not very convenient. The food was actually okay even though it was expensive. Knowing that this place opens very late makes me do consider to come back again as long as they don't play that playlist anymore,3.0
"Really cute space, prompt service, and of course it's always nice to have a coffee shop that also serves real food. But said food can be uneven - my friend's bagel with lox was delish, my turkey/avocado sandwich looked and tasted like it had been prepared by mom in a rush for a bag lunch. Although the bread was very nice and not too crispy. It was difficult to find a table on a Sunday around brunch time, as most of the spots were occupied by laptop junkies who were probably camped out for hours.

"I haven't been here in while. Today I had a bagel with lox, cream cheese, capers, onion...it was everything. The best one I have had period. The coffee was great too. I highly recommend you try this item on a day when you can sit back and relax on one of their couches and savor your food.",5.0

The employee who was making the coffee wasn't overly friendly, but the one that processed your payment was very friendly. The customers in the cafe were very nice. After being their for a while, I decided to get a bite to eat. I ordered the chili mac and cheese, and it was delicious. And for only $6, you really couldn't beat it. The only annoying thing was the wifi. Thank goodness, the main project I was working on didn't require internet or going there would have been a waste of time. Nevertheless, I understand why they don't put the internet on until later after brunch. But after that, I am not sure if they turn it off again after a certain time, but I didn't have internet for much longer after they put it on.",4.0

This place got so popular and now there is never anywhere to sit...and if you want to plug your laptop in, forget it. There are like two outlets in the entire place.The WiFi also never works and some of the staff is pretty rude as well. Last time I was there, I was completely unable to connect to the internet and when I went up and told the girl at the register that the WiFi wasn't working - her response was, ""That sucks."" She didn't offer to help me out at all. When I asked if she could do something, she merely offered up some snarky response and basically told me to deal with the shi**y internet.

"I should be ashamed of myself for giving this place 4 stars. Honestly the best espresso I have tasted.

I google mapped the walk from my place to Outpost. 1.8 Miles in 35 minutes. (I'm much faster than that) Always worth it. The music can be a little loud but frankly I probably don't want to hear what the people around me are talking about anyways.",5.0

"We took a pit stop here after an afternoon in Brooklyn and it was the perfect coffee boost needed before heading back into the city. Order the speciality drinks if you want a kick of coffee and out-of-this-world flavors all in a mason jar. I ordered the Grand, which was 2 shots of espresso, milk chocolate amaretto and drizzle of caramel on a bed of whip cream. My friend ordered the same but instead of amaretto and caramel, it was raspberry and milk chocolate. We ordered a sweet potato bundt cake to share to tone down the coffees. I would highly recommend coming back even though it's a little out of the way.",4.0

"The space is really nice and there's a really cool backyard. But ... I went there on a Sunday and it wasn't the music was seriously loud, the cappuccino wasn't the best and the sandwich that they made wasn't good at all. Even if you keep on ordering food and drinks, you're allowed to use Internet just for 2 hours. That's definitely bad. Anyway... The price are really ok, they've got a lot of different food and the guys working there are nice too.",3.0

"I went to Outpost on a nice day to enjoy a good cup of coffee and get some work done. Had a cappuccino, found a seat, an outlet and got to work. The employee who was making the coffee wasn't overly friendly, but the one that processed your payment was very friendly. The customers in the cafe were very nice. After being their for a while, I decided to get a bite to eat. I ordered the chili mac and cheese, and it was delicious. And for only $6, you really couldn't beat it. The only annoying thing was the wifi. Thank goodness, the main project I was working on didn't require internet or going there would have been a waste of time. Nevertheless, I understand why they don't put the internet on until later after brunch. But after that, I am not sure if they turn it off again after a certain time, but I didn't have internet for much longer after they put it on.",4.0
"I used to love going to this place until they covered up nearly all of their outlets. This place got so popular and now there is never anywhere to sit...and if you want to plug your laptop in, forget it. There are like two outlets in the entire place.The WiFi also never works and some of the staff is pretty rude as well. Last time I was there, I was completely unable to connect to the internet and when I went up and told the girl at the register that the WiFi wasn't working - her response was, ""That sucks."" She didn't offer to help me out at all. When I asked if she could do something, she merely offered up some snarky response and basically told me to deal with the shi**y internet. It prompted me to leave the cafe. This place sucks now.",2.0

"This place is a gem! Sweet, helpful service, cool cottage-meets-funky decor, and laidback semi hipster crowd. The garden out back is just lovely! I ordered my delicious watermelon lemonade and just soaked in the summertime shade w/a book.The Tuna Salad Sandwich I later ordered was equally tasty, although the bread may've been a day old. I prayed I wouldn't lose a tooth. Luckily, all teeth were intact cause I wasn't going to let that chocolate chip cookie go to waste, either.",5.0
"I should be ashamed of myself for giving this place 4 stars. Honestly the best espresso I have tasted. (Intelligentsia included) I must have had my Classon prepared by four or five different baristas and the execution is always flawless. They even froth the syrup with the half-and-half in the frothing pitcher without you having to ask. (Hey baristas out there, if this is news to you, get it together and stop adding my syrup at the end of my latte!)      I've been to about 20 to 30 different coffee shops in Brooklyn over the last year or so, none better than this one. I google mapped the walk from my place to Outpost. 1.8 Miles in 35 minutes. (I'm much faster than that) Always worth it. The music can be a little loud but frankly I probably don't want to hear what the people around me are talking about anyways.",5.0

"Brooklyn is, simply stated, a haven for coffee shop lovers.  Gripes from ex-pat Seattleites (Seattleians? Does anyone care?) notwithstanding, there's a great selection of big, comfortable cafes with good-to-great coffee, free Wi-Fi (just try that in Manhattan) indoor and outdoor seating, and not horribly-overpriced baked goods, snacks and chow.And although my first visit or two to Outpost--hidden away on a bland, underserved slice of Fulton Ave. near the Franklin stop on the C train--was a little shaky, I'd have to say that it now ranks near the top of my list.  The counter people (I have an aversion to the word barrista) are generally really patient and friendly, and, most importantly, make ridiculously good coffee.  (The one and only time in my life I was tempted to walk back up to the bar and exclaim, like an idiot, ""Holy s%$ that's a good latte!"" was at Outpost.  I've since had to restrain myself from doing the same on subsequent visits.)  There's also a solid selection of inventive baked offerings and the like--muffins, cookies, the obligatory but undeniably tempting red velvet cake.  Like the coffees, nothing is particularly cheap (or ridiculously overpriced, for that matter.)The prepared food is also surprisingly good; in some coffee shops the menu is clearly an afterthought--or worse, an embarrassment--but at Outpost veggie and turkey chili, mac and cheese, sandwiches, soups & salads, etc.--while in relatively limited supply each day--are fresh and carefully prepared.  And unlike many other cafes, Outpost has a not-lousy selection of inexpensive bottled beers and wines by the glass, if y'all wanna get wasted.The room is, of course, on the ""funky"" side, with pleasantly distressed, retro, mismatched tables, chairs, couches (and customers.)  It's usually not terribly overcrowded, especially when it's warm enough to open the back patio, which captures the same relaxed, hipsterish vibe as inside.  There's free Wifi (""withpurchase,"" as their network trumpets) and the music selections vary with the umm...barristas.  I've heard everything from seriously heavy stoner sludge-rock to Phish in a 30 minute block, but the jamz are generally kept at a reasonable enough volume to check your Facebook in peace, or (egads!) do some actual work on your laptop.  (The exception is in the evening, when the turntables and mixer that usually go unattended are in full swing.  Totally different scenario then.)Other pluses: Outpost opens pretty early and stays open pretty late, and there are two truly pleasant and clean bathrooms.  They also take their napkins/stirrers/milk/sugar table seriously.  (It's not an unholy mess, a la Starbucks.)  Minuses: Not great if you're in a hurry, and there's a $10 minimum for credit card purchases.See you there.",4.0

"Brooklyn is, simply stated, a haven for coffee shop lovers.  Gripes from ex-pat Seattleites (Seattleians? Does anyone care?) notwithstanding, there's a great selection of big, comfortable cafes with good-to-great coffee, free Wi-Fi (just try that in Manhattan) indoor and outdoor seating, and not horribly-overpriced baked goods, snacks and chow.And although my first visit or two to Outpost--hidden away on a bland, underserved slice of Fulton Ave. near the Franklin stop on the C train--was a little shaky, I'd have to say that it now ranks near the top of my list.  The counter people (I have an aversion to the word barrista) are generally really patient and friendly, and, most importantly, make ridiculously good coffee.  (The one and only time in my life I was tempted to walk back up to the bar and exclaim, like an idiot, ""Holy s%$ that's a good latte!"" was at Outpost.  I've since had to restrain myself from doing the same on subsequent visits.)  There's also a solid selection of inventive baked offerings and the like--muffins, cookies, the obligatory but undeniably tempting red velvet cake.  Like the coffees, nothing is particularly cheap (or ridiculously overpriced, for that matter.)The prepared food is also surprisingly good; in some coffee shops the menu is clearly an afterthought--or worse, an embarrassment--but at Outpost veggie and turkey chili, mac and cheese, sandwiches, soups & salads, etc.--while in relatively limited supply each day--are fresh and carefully prepared.  And unlike many other cafes, Outpost has a not-lousy selection of inexpensive bottled beers and wines by the glass, if y'all wanna get wasted.The room is, of course, on the ""funky"" side, with pleasantly distressed, retro, mismatched tables, chairs, couches (and customers.)  It's usually not terribly overcrowded, especially when it's warm enough to open the back patio, which captures the same relaxed, hipsterish vibe as inside.  There's free Wifi (""withpurchase,"" as their network trumpets) and the music selections vary with the umm...barristas.  I've heard everything from seriously heavy stoner sludge-rock to Phish in a 30 minute block, but the jamz are generally kept at a reasonable enough volume to check your Facebook in peace, or (egads!) do some actual work on your laptop.  (The exception is in the evening, when the turntables and mixer that usually go unattended are in full swing.  Totally different scenario then.)Other pluses: Outpost opens pretty early and stays open pretty late, and there are two truly pleasant and clean bathrooms.  They also take their napkins/stirrers/milk/sugar table seriously.  (It's not an unholy mess, a la Starbucks.)  Minuses: Not great if you're in a hurry, and there's a $10 minimum for credit card purchases.See you there.",4.0
"Yes, yes, and yes.  This place has really good coffee drinks and decent food.  RoRo had this amazing bar thing with coconut that was gluten free and I even liked it.  I had the weird tasting bread pudding, which was neither bread, nor pudding - discuss!  We sat outside in the nicely lighted porch thingy and it was super cool.",4.0

"Dear Tea Lounge,There were two reasons I continued patronizing your always over-crowded space: your walls are riddled in outlets, and I thought you to be the only coffee shop around that was open late.But coming from Franklin Ave, that 20-minute walk down Eastern Parkway, especially in the snow, has grown wearisome and to be frank, I rather resent your increasingly pre-college crowd.  And what's the deal with BET taking over on Saturdays, lately?This is not an resentful letter - we've had several good times, I got lots of work done on my kneecaps, and I'm sure I'll stop by for a jazz show, sometime.  And true, few places beat your tea selection.  But fuck it - I'm a coffee drinker.  And as for getting a quality coffee shop experience, I'm afraid I've found another...Outpost is everything I liked about you except closer, cheaper, and less crowded (and when it is crowded, it's not full of high school kids).  And the food menu here is SO reasonably priced; it was indeed $7 well-spent on a curried chicken sandwich on a soft baguette and a generously-portioned arugula salad.  You, Tea Lounge, felt it ok to charge $5 on a piece of toast with a cheese dusting, and have never had $1 beers on Mondays, but then again, alcohol and strollers never mixed.Oh, and the wifi here isn't bogged down by a thousand ""freelancers"", which seem to be permanent fixtures in your chairs no matter what time it is.  And you can pay with card, here.  Ok, I'm done.Anyway, back to this excellent chai latté.  Toodles, TL.Sei",4.0

I must move on....and like JM (another reviewer) said there are plenty of fish or better places in the area...my new love is luv tea...just around the corner.  They greet me with a smile and they make the best cappuccino in the area (it's Blue Bottle...nothing left to say) and they fill my belly with an awesome chicken sandwich.  And you know what they say, the way to a man's heart is through his stomach.",1.0

Do I have complaints? Sure, who doesn't? The volume of the music is usually just loud enough to do battle with headphones you might have on, and it's often impossible to get a seat, but hey, what can you do?That hardly outweighs the positives--the strong, delicious brew-the delightful selection of beers-the fantastic staff - all of 'em, A#1!Best of all?

"Dear Tea Lounge,There were two reasons I continued patronizing your always over-crowded space: your walls are riddled in outlets, and I thought you to be the only coffee shop around that was open late.But coming from Franklin Ave, that 20-minute walk down Eastern Parkway, especially in the snow, has grown wearisome and to be frank, I rather resent your increasingly pre-college crowd.  And what's the deal with BET taking over on Saturdays, lately?This is not an resentful letter - we've had several good times, I got lots of work done on my kneecaps, and I'm sure I'll stop by for a jazz show, sometime.  And true, few places beat your tea selection.  But fuck it - I'm a coffee drinker.  And as for getting a quality coffee shop experience, I'm afraid I've found another...Outpost is everything I liked about you except closer, cheaper, and less crowded (and when it is crowded, it's not full of high school kids).  And the food menu here is SO reasonably priced; it was indeed $7 well-spent on a curried chicken sandwich on a soft baguette and a generously-portioned arugula salad.  You, Tea Lounge, felt it ok to charge $5 on a piece of toast with a cheese dusting, and have never had $1 beers on Mondays, but then again, alcohol and strollers never mixed.Oh, and the wifi here isn't bogged down by a thousand ""freelancers"", which seem to be permanent fixtures in your chairs no matter what time it is.  And you can pay with card, here.  Ok, I'm done.Anyway, back to this excellent chai latté.  Toodles, TL.Sei",4.0
"Where has the love gone? I would turn to you on bad days, to celebrate good news or just relax. I left for a fellowship and return to you. What do I find when I return? Attitude from the staff, decline in quality of coffee and food. I understand about the locked outlets, you're a business and can't have someone sit there all day with 1 cup of coffee, I get it! I left the other day wondering was it me. Now I realize it's you! I must move on....and like JM (another reviewer) said there are plenty of fish or better places in the area...my new love is luv tea...just around the corner.  They greet me with a smile and they make the best cappuccino in the area (it's Blue Bottle...nothing left to say) and they fill my belly with an awesome chicken sandwich.  And you know what they say, the way to a man's heart is through his stomach.",1.0
"Outpost!I know neighborhoods are different things to different people, but to me, Outpost is the heart of the neighborhood. I don't get to spend as much time as I want there (I work 11-7, like my mornings at home, and the music there in the evenings is usually a little too loud/upbeat for the writing or reading I am doing) - but when I DO spend time there, it's got a great feel to it. Do I have complaints? Sure, who doesn't? The volume of the music is usually just loud enough to do battle with headphones you might have on, and it's often impossible to get a seat, but hey, what can you do?That hardly outweighs the positives--the strong, delicious brew-the delightful selection of beers-the fantastic staff - all of 'em, A#1!Best of all? The backyard garden. It's a little oasis, with lots of little quirks and touches that are dear to me.I can't imagine the area without Outpost.",5.0
"The atmosphere is great, and there's outdoor seating.The Internet's usually on the fritz at one point or another, but the staff are friendly and helpful, and patient with you as you are patient with their Internet.They've got $1 off drafts happy hour from 4-8 on weekdays, and even better, it's 4-close on Mondays.",3.0
"Dear Outpost Cafe,I dream of returning to you for your vegetarian chili and giant cups of coffee. ALAS! Your tables are always full with people working on their Macbooks and hogging 4 seats - you should really consider a designated laptop bar.The people working in you were fine, if boring and I am very interested in your tea selection.Hope to see you soon,Molly xo",4.0

"This is a fantastic gem of a cafe in the middle of nowhere, Brooklyn.I went there for brunch on a Sunday afternoon and it was packed but despite that I found the staff to very helpful and the service to be very speedy. This was my first time there and I was extremely impressed with the atmosphere, the music playing and the general layout of the cafe. The coffee was terrific and the food was delicious.I started to like the place even more when I saw they serve alcohol and had a well-thoughtout backyard.I would totally recommend this place even if it is out of the way.",4.0
"Decent coffee, chill decor, hip (hipster?) atmosphere & crowd, good music, tantalizing pastries, and kind service.  I'm excited to go back in the evenings (especially during $1 PBR nights) for some alchy and, hopefully, good conversation.  If not I'll just sit at the ""bar"" and ramble to the baristas- they can't escape!",4.0
"Arguably my favorite cafe in Brooklyn. I'm here at least once a week.During the winter, their hot cider and chai lattes have been fantastic. In the summer, the Grasshopper and other lemonade-based drinks are perfect.The staff is wonderful. They're all pleasantly weird and welcoming. Some people are faster than others, but there isn't a huge difference.The fact that they also serve beer and wine is the real clincher. If you need a space to work or think for a bit, and find your afternoon session turning into an evening, having the option of getting a well-rounded dinner is indispensable.",5.0

Thanks fellow yelpers!!!The coffee was delish, the food looking like your typical coffeehouse homemade ""good"" food, not the best value for your money, but I'll try it sometime.The service was slow and disorganized, but friendly-ish.

I stopped at this place and was even thinking of sitting, but it was so packed out, not a seat in the place and it wasn't small. I was surprised too since it was mid afternoon on a Monday. So I just got some oatmeal with walnuts and cranberries, was pretty good for what it was. Will have to come back, it was a cool place to hang out.",3.0

"I live just two blocks from the Outpost and had been there a handful of times prior to my last experience a week or so ago. I was really excited that the Outpost existed as there is almost nothing else like it in my neighborhood and it really needs a good coffee shop type place. This is the kind of place that when I lived in Williamsburg years ago would have become my second home. Now, I hadn't started going regularly because due to the winter weather, I rarely walk out of my way, even if it's a couple of blocks, unless I absolutely have to. Since I have no reason to walk past the Outpost unless it's my destination, I was stoked that the weather was nice and my walks around the neighborhood, especially to the Outpost and the nearby playground would return. Unlike last spring, however, I now have an infant. How dare I? I mean, what kind of nerve to actually move to a neighborhood, establish myself there over a couple of years, and then dare to settle down with my beautiful wife and actually have a child! That's how I felt when I walked into the Outpost with my baby boy strapped to me and my wife alongside. Now, if my son had been making a lot of noise, was crying or just fussy in general, or if I was one of those d*bag parents that makes everyone whisper or change their life around my baby, I could understand a little or even a lot of frustration. After all, I work in a restaurant and kids of all ages, from babies to teens, can often make my shift especially challenging. But he wasn't. In fact, when we went in, he was sleeping. Now, so far, in my son's 10 months on this earth, the last six or so of which he has been almost constantly strapped to me as we wander around on our baby-daddy adventures all over NYC, I have never encountered ANYONE being rude to me, discourteous or judgmental of me and my son. In fact, I noticed quite the opposite and how most people were especially friendly and courteous. It helps that my son, when he's not sleeping, is usually quite happy and cheerful. He rarely, if ever, fusses or cries while we're out and about and when he does, we usually leave or get up and walk around. Well, the staff at the Outpost, in all their grand hipness, with their super cool tattoos (not as cool as my wife's though), and ultra trendy clothes (I was only wearing trendy stuff that day, it gets tiring to stay that trendy with a baby at home), and snide remarks under their breath. Like I said, I work at a restaurant, in fact I'm a bartender, and have been on and off for the last ten years. I was very polite and greeted my barrista with a smile and a hello. I said please, ordered a simple order (a small bottle of coke, and a medium coffee), did so in a normal voice and then tipped $2, which was about 75% of my total. In return I got long sighs about the Coke (which had to be retrieved from another room), a snicker about the plain coffee, and when I asked about food, was told to ""look in dish [next to the register] and it explains itself."" The coke took five minuets and was served was served warm. Not cool. Not cold. But warm. No one told me it was gonna be warm. No one offered me any ice or anything. When I returned to the counter to ask for a glass with ice, before I asked anything, the original girl who helped me rolled her eyes and walked away. I stood there for between 3-5 more minutes, said excuse me numerous times to the several people behind the counter, who simply ignored me and kept talking to each other while doing nothing else. Finally, another woman approached me and said, ""Yes?"" I asked for a glass with ice and was met with a sigh. She returned with a short glass and some half melted ice a minute later and placed it down in front of me, saying nothing. The staff continued to stare at my wife, son and I for the remainder of my stay, which became quite brief. We got the hint. We left, and were outraged. Like I said, I had been there several times before, and while the employees are your stereotypical ""I'm waaaayyy to cool to deal with anyone now that I live in Brooklyn,"" they were pleasant or at least professional enough that it didn't bother me. This time was borderline intimidating. To be treated with such contempt, such rudeness, such discourtesy, because I have a baby, and because I carry my baby with me, is inexcusable, especially after ordering such a simple set of items, ordering as friendly as I did, and with a sleeping baby, making not a drop of noise and tipping as well as I did. I didn't even get a thank you, at all, even as the first girl watched me drop two singles into her tip jar. I'm inclined to never return to the Outpost. I'd rather hike to Tillie's or back to Williamsburg or even into Manhattan than deal with that kind of behavior again and have to pay for it, especially since I take care of my son most days (as I work at night), and am rarely without him when I'm not at work. I wouldn't want to offend or bother the super cool ultra hip employees.",1.0

The salmon, lox bagel is also quite a treat, and 6.50, so pretty affordable. The drinks are fine. Lattes and regular coffee are suitable. The apple cider is also pleasant.

It's still $6 and a beautiful way to drink early in the day and not look like a total lush!I do recommend you order your hot drinks in a to-go cup.

After putting down a deposit to have our wedding at Frankie's an asteroid hit our bank account and we basically had to start looking at non-conventional options. Since Outpost ""rents the space for events"" on their site we asked if we could rent the place for the whole day, bring in our own bartender, our own caterer (completely unheard of in NYC space rental. It was Chavela's to be exact) and invite 75 of our close friends and family.. and they said yes.. Granted it was all DIY but they let us load all of our stuff in early and the staff was there to just make sure everything went well with the space and we didn't damage anything but they were great and wonderfully nice. At one point helped out with some things because they wanted to because they said they were having so much fun.. We moved tables out of the way to dance after dinner, it was great, and the neighbors even called the cops because I guess we were louder than some of the bands that play there... They obviously aren't in the business of doing this sort of thing but I am forever grateful to this place for letting us rent the space and being super accommodating otherwise we probably wouldn't have had a wedding..",5.0

"I used to live in the neighborhood and go to Outpost and it was great... So great infact, they let me have my wedding there! After putting down a deposit to have our wedding at Frankie's an asteroid hit our bank account and we basically had to start looking at non-conventional options. Since Outpost ""rents the space for events"" on their site we asked if we could rent the place for the whole day, bring in our own bartender, our own caterer (completely unheard of in NYC space rental. It was Chavela's to be exact) and invite 75 of our close friends and family.. and they said yes.. Granted it was all DIY but they let us load all of our stuff in early and the staff was there to just make sure everything went well with the space and we didn't damage anything but they were great and wonderfully nice. At one point helped out with some things because they wanted to because they said they were having so much fun.. We moved tables out of the way to dance after dinner, it was great, and the neighbors even called the cops because I guess we were louder than some of the bands that play there... They obviously aren't in the business of doing this sort of thing but I am forever grateful to this place for letting us rent the space and being super accommodating otherwise we probably wouldn't have had a wedding..",5.0

The food is not bad. The menu is great in theory but the actual product is subpar. Just not very fresh or done sloppily.

"The Outpost should work. You got your courtyard outside, a $5 bowl of nuked turkey chili with sprinkled cheese that has saved your pal Johnny a few times when he was too birdbrained or otherwise crippled to slap some bread and cheese together at home, a fairly spacious interior (that is, when you can get a seat), and a music selection that ranges from electro to the same ol' same ol' everywhere else.  Default setting: not bad.  Could be better if there were more idiosyncratic people.Johnny forgives the kids behind the counter for their occasional absentmindedness.  Because they've given your pal Johnny a few conversational laughs and don't seem to wear Napoleon Dynamite T-shirts or telltale sartorial garb that says I AM HERE TO KILL THE NEIGHBORHOOD CHARACTER. I HAVE NEVER SEEN THE HALF-TORN SATIRICAL SIGN TO THE EAST ON THE SOUTH SIDE OF FULTON THAT SAW ALL THIS COMING A FEW YEARS AGO, AND I COULDN'T POSSIBLY UNDERSTAND THE UNDERLYING ACERBIC COMEDY BECAUSE I JUST MOVED INTO THE NABE WITH MOMMY AND DADDY'S MONEY.  I LACK EDGE IN MY LIFE AND SO WILL YOU IN A FEW MONTHS.  Johnny says yes to kids with eccentric piercings, especially those trying to earn a few beer dollars and who pass some of Johnny's conversational intelligent tests, over those limp-wristed layabouts who want to spend all goddam day staring into their laptops looking for God.  (You don't go for a cafe for this.  You go to a church or you give all your spare cash to the Church of Scientology or you figure out some creative way to waste your years.  Johnny's trying to dunk a hell of bread into his turkey chilli.  Why are you shouting so loud on your phones? Why are you one person dominating a table made for four?  Do you get out of your head?  Or do you come here to remain in denial about your loneliness?  I've got a cure for that: conversation.)You see, that's where The Outpost and Johnny part ways.  There's an underlying Brooklyn Law, something that a spectacular bartender named Pete once intimated to me: Forget calculated lifestyles.  You'll have a more enriching life if you keep the flavor marinating in the communal stew.  Or, to put it another way, instead of resisting what's here, keep it going.  Add to it.  If this cafe's clientele would do that arithmetic, then Johnny could unzip his fly and let his rosy sausage stretch out to five stars.  But it's going to have to be four for now, kiddo.  It could be three in three months if we're not careful.",4.0
"Today was my first visit to Outpost, and I have to say I intend to make this place my morning/afternoon/evening espresso and brunch spot from here on out.  I live on the cusp of BedStuy/Clinton Hill so there's only a handful of independent QUALITY coffee spots within reasonable walking distance.  The closest other spot is Bush Baby which is also nice but it's located in the heart of too much riff raff on Fulton Street, so this is a nice alternative.  On it's own little island of an otherwise very busy BK.My pumpkin latte has become a fall favorite of mine from another bigger named coffee spot that shall remain nameless *wink*. So to have that option at Outpost with their own flair to it (real pumpkin pieces) was an added bonus.I'm a writer, so I fully intend to check this place out during the day when it's less busy during the week to really get the full experience but for now it's a win for me.",5.0

"I have to say this is one of my favorite places to work in all of New York City. Yes, I said it. I come here again and again, even after I moved away from the neighborhood. It's definitely a really nice well-kept secret and will probably continue to be since it's not on the main drag of anywhere. This keeps it full of locals, which tend to be down-to-earth, young, friendly, and unpretentious. Queer friendly! The staff are nice (and good looking as well, if I do say). This is the type of place where you will probably have a cool conversation with someone you've never met, and maybe meet a new neighbor. In this vast city, I find this to be a rarity and I love this about Outpost.The music is a little loud at times, but usually fun 80s jams in the afternoon, and chill stuff in the morning. Great coffee! Yummy snacks and tasty eats (check out the Sweet Potato cake. Heaven.) Wi-fi is typically solid, but they will reset the router if it falters - without rolling their eyes like some cafe workers!Also a sweet outdoor patio when its nice out.Yay for Outpost!",5.0
"The Outpost Cafe is cool.  Free wi-fi = cool.  Ok coffee = cool.  Outdoor space = cool.  Brie and green apple sandwich = very cool.  By the looks of the crowd this place screams super cool (the kind of cool that I am not), so I feel a little out of place generally. I can't handle all the coolness, so I can't go too often.  I live along the ""busted stretch of Fulton"" that Scout S. mentions and I honestly don't know where the Outpost Cafe-goers come from.  I never see them on the street.  I presume they trek in from Coolville.  I'm not even cool enough to know where Coolville is.P.S.

You got your courtyard outside, a $5 bowl of nuked turkey chili with sprinkled cheese that has saved your pal Johnny a few times when he was too birdbrained or otherwise crippled to slap some bread and cheese together at home, a fairly spacious interior (that is, when you can get a seat), and a music selection that ranges from electro to the same ol' same ol' everywhere else.  Default setting: not bad.  Could be better if there were more idiosyncratic people.Johnny forgives the kids behind the counter for their occasional absentmindedness.  Because they've given your pal Johnny a few conversational laughs and don't seem to wear Napoleon Dynamite T-shirts or telltale sartorial garb that says I AM HERE TO KILL THE NEIGHBORHOOD CHARACTER. I HAVE NEVER SEEN THE HALF-TORN SATIRICAL SIGN TO THE EAST ON THE SOUTH SIDE OF FULTON THAT SAW ALL THIS COMING A FEW YEARS AGO, AND I COULDN'T POSSIBLY UNDERSTAND THE UNDERLYING ACERBIC COMEDY BECAUSE I JUST MOVED INTO THE NABE WITH MOMMY AND DADDY'S MONEY.  I LACK EDGE IN MY LIFE AND SO WILL YOU IN A FEW MONTHS.  Johnny says yes to kids with eccentric piercings, especially those trying to earn a few beer dollars and who pass some of Johnny's conversational intelligent tests, over those limp-wristed layabouts who want to spend all goddam day staring into their laptops looking for God.  (You don't go for a cafe for this.  You go to a church or you give all your spare cash to the Church of Scientology or you figure out some creative way to waste your years.  Johnny's trying to dunk a hell of bread into his turkey chilli.  Why are you shouting so loud on your phones? Why are you one person dominating a table made for four?  Do you get out of your head?  Or do you come here to remain in denial about your loneliness?  I've got a cure for that: conversation.)You see, that's where The Outpost and Johnny part ways.  There's an underlying Brooklyn Law, something that a spectacular bartender named Pete once intimated to me: Forget calculated lifestyles.  You'll have a more enriching life if you keep the flavor marinating in the communal stew.  Or, to put it another way, instead of resisting what's here, keep it going.  Add to it.  If this cafe's clientele would do that arithmetic, then Johnny could unzip his fly and let his rosy sausage stretch out to five stars.  But it's going to have to be four for now, kiddo.  It could be three in three months if we're not careful.",4.0
"Today was my first visit to Outpost, and I have to say I intend to make this place my morning/afternoon/evening espresso and brunch spot from here on out.  I live on the cusp of BedStuy/Clinton Hill so there's only a handful of independent QUALITY coffee spots within reasonable walking distance.  The closest other spot is Bush Baby which is also nice but it's located in the heart of too much riff raff on Fulton Street, so this is a nice alternative.  On it's own little island of an otherwise very busy BK.My pumpkin latte has become a fall favorite of mine from another bigger named coffee spot that shall remain nameless *wink*. So to have that option at Outpost with their own flair to it (real pumpkin pieces) was an added bonus.I'm a writer, so I fully intend to check this place out during the day when it's less busy during the week to really get the full experience but for now it's a win for me.",5.0
Sandwich was so so.  The joint was uncomfortably hot.  No fans or AC.  Cool decor.Big problem with the staff.  All of them were ice cold and down right rude.I was really looking forward to checking the place out.  Left feeling completely unwelcome.  Not sure what the draw is here...?,1.0
"I like this place a lot. It's relaxed and the employees are pretty nice. However, stay away from their espresso. If you want espresso, go to one of the small handful of places in Brooklyn, nay, New York, that knows how to pull a decent shot. Their drip, iced coffee, teas and juices though, are delicious!",4.0
"I am so happy I found Outpost while searching for a good cup of coffee near the laundromat. I don't know what it is but I could sit here for hours and not realize it had been 10 minutes. Great coffee and great freshly made juices. Try the grasshopper(ginger, apple, lemonade) I can't stop thinking about it. Sometimes it gets a little crowded so be prepared to share a table. This place is awesome, and if I ever moved to long island I would probably travel to Brooklyn just to go to the outpost.",5.0
How can you not love a coffee shop with beer on tap?,4.0
"I have to say this is one of my favorite places to work in all of New York City. Yes, I said it. I come here again and again, even after I moved away from the neighborhood. It's definitely a really nice well-kept secret and will probably continue to be since it's not on the main drag of anywhere. This keeps it full of locals, which tend to be down-to-earth, young, friendly, and unpretentious. Queer friendly! The staff are nice (and good looking as well, if I do say). This is the type of place where you will probably have a cool conversation with someone you've never met, and maybe meet a new neighbor. In this vast city, I find this to be a rarity and I love this about Outpost.The music is a little loud at times, but usually fun 80s jams in the afternoon, and chill stuff in the morning. Great coffee! Yummy snacks and tasty eats (check out the Sweet Potato cake. Heaven.) Wi-fi is typically solid, but they will reset the router if it falters - without rolling their eyes like some cafe workers!Also a sweet outdoor patio when its nice out.Yay for Outpost!",5.0
"The Outpost Cafe is cool.  Free wi-fi = cool.  Ok coffee = cool.  Outdoor space = cool.  Brie and green apple sandwich = very cool.  By the looks of the crowd this place screams super cool (the kind of cool that I am not), so I feel a little out of place generally. I can't handle all the coolness, so I can't go too often.  I live along the ""busted stretch of Fulton"" that Scout S. mentions and I honestly don't know where the Outpost Cafe-goers come from.  I never see them on the street.  I presume they trek in from Coolville.  I'm not even cool enough to know where Coolville is.P.S. The Ryan Ketchum artwork is incredible. Beyond cool.  Even too cool for Coolville.",4.0
"Nice coffee shop.  I had the curry chicken sandwich, which was great, and the breakfast smoothie, which was okay.  The place was packed.  I only have two complaints about the Outpost: 1.) It's grungy as f***.  The table I was sitting and needed a serious deep cleaning.  My forearms were sticking to the table, as was my computer, my iPad, and my iPhone.  2.) They need to either use their air conditioner or get some ceiling fans installed.  It was really hot in there, which only added to the swampiness of it.  I went there to study, and the combination of the grime and the temperature made it difficult to concentrate.  I would go back on a cooler and less humid day to hang out with a/some friends, but I won't be going back to study.",4.0

"I love this place.BUT TURN DOWN THE FRICKEN VOLUME! DJ lacks some serious perspective taking skills this monday night. There are 7 customers, reading papers, with laptops. THEY ARE NOT PARTYING TO CRAPPY 80s SYNTH DANCE MUSIC. THEY ARE NOT GOING TO PARTY. THEY DON'T WANT TO PARTY. There is a couple in the front trying to have a CONVERSATION. Patrons keep looking over at the DJ, but I think everyone suffers from the same discusjockusdictatophobia that I do.The DJ just tried saying something to the barista from 3 feet away, and even the barrista couldn't hear him. My stomach is bouncing involuntarily with the beat.This is not common for Output, but it is seriously annoying tonight. I hope they can hear this yelp review. I think this qualifies as passive aggressive, let's ask wiktionary: ""Showing passive, sometimes obstructionist resistance to following authoritative instructions in interpersonal or occupational situations"". Well, by this account, this doesn't seem to qualify as passive aggressive behavior so ya'll can suck it.Still 4 stars for all the other nights I've been here and it rocked.",4.0
"With everything from their great bed-stuy chai, to super-cheap breakfast and lunch, to beer and music in the evenings, this place rocks! Add sitting in the back patio on a nice day with some of their baked goods and awesome staff - i'm happy as a clam. they also have some pretty cool events at night sometimes. oh and free wi-fi, but i have never used it.the one thing that i just really don't like is the name - did you have to name it outpost? c'mon guys.",4.0

"Yes, indeed, this is the best coffee in the neighborhood. Buy some beans from here and you won't be sad. Not as knockout puckering headachy strong as gorilla can be in the slope, but with the same obvious care taken in the house blend. i like the mood in here a lot, i like the staff a lot. i like biking here. i wish there were a tiny bit more viable lock-up space outside for my bike, but what can you do? it's a nice destination on a sunny day. the back yard is cool, but watch out for the gingko tree dropping some major stink back there. i don't come here as often as tillie's because occasionally the general mood of smug beauty and affluence can be a little more apparent here amongst the clientele and it kind of puts a momentary bad taste in my mouth, whereas i feel like tillie's invites a more diverse crowd different ages, types, shapes and sizes, transplants as well honest-to-goodness residents. but, i readily admit that i could change my mind about all that if i just hung out a little more.also, props for trying to do a movie night and an open mic like every other self-respecting brooklyn establishment must at one time or another try to do. i haven't been to either and i have no idea whether they are well attended or any good, but A for effort. and thanks for the good coffee drinks and a little bit of solitude!",4.0
"I live around the corner and it's been totally hit or miss every time I've stopped in. I've gotten great service with terrible lattes, eye-rolling, snarky cashiers with the perfect macchiato, and everything in between. Watermelon lemonade in the summer is great, especially when enjoyed outside in the backyard, even though it gets very smoky/cell-phone-y. I do wish the music was a little more regulated by the owners, sometimes I want to go in there to get some work done and have a hard time concentrating due to the overwhelmingly loud lady gaga.

It has a very congenial and laid-back atmosphere and the patrons were not overly-hipsterfied -- thank goodness.Too bad it isn't within walking distance and I have to catch the bus to get there. If it weren't for that, I'd be there every single day.",5.0
"This is the business I imagine myself owning someday soon.  Homey, comfy place to chill.  They have something going on every night-movie night, PBR special night (I will never jump on that hipster band wagon), sangria on Sundays, etc.Their iced tea was really good, and i had a blueberry muffin that was very yummy and fresh.  LOVE the outdoor seating and the free wireless.  You have to go to the bathroom while you're here too, so cute.",5.0
"Outpost belongs to my favorite café category: those that are also bars. Monday nights, have coffee and a sandwich while romancing your laptop in the early evening and smoothly transition from work to play with $1 pbr. The barista laptop DJing is excellent, though some of the sweet electric mixes are kind of unexpected for a cute café with wooden tables and a backyard seating. I'm pretty much only knocking a star off for the flakey free internet. I try and fail to get a signal about half the times I go.",4.0

"I came into this place because the place I wanted to go to for breakfast down the street was closed for some reason...so I kinda stumbled across Outpost. The place has a warm feel to it and the garden out back is really nice to sit down and have some coffee and read the newspaper...but unfortunately the day I was there it was just too humid in the morning so I didn't eat outside. I really wanted some eggs and bacon (because thats what I was going to get from the other place), but I was kind of disappointed that they don't really have that kind of breakfast there. They have a few different variations of bagels with toppings and some pastries but thats pretty much the extent of it. Needless to say I was a little bummed...but I didn't know where else to go and I didn't feel like walking too far since I live right around the corner. So I reluctantly ordered a bagel with cream cheese and lox with tomatoes on top. Once I wrapped my lips around that bagel I was pretty happy with my decision. The tomatoes where nice and fresh and the bagel was perfect...and how can you go wrong with lox?! So even though it wasn't what I wanted originally I still left there pretty happy with my breakfast.",4.0

"This morning as my normal routine I made a stop to get my usual coffee with bagel.  To my surprise again, this is at least the third time where I noticed one of your workers have not administered proper or adequate sanitary usage.  This morning your female staff (she wore a yellow bandana on head) was observed sweeping the floor and did not wash her hand before taking my order.  In addition, she appeared to display a negative disposition and appeared annoyed. The customer service proceeded with her asking for me to pay for my order before making the bagel and coffee.  Then she proceeded to make the coffee and abruptly slide it across the counter which could have fell and cause an injury.  Then she went to make my bagel with butter and with such sloppiness placed it in a foil paper not wrapped properly.  She then requested if I wanted the bagel in a paper bag and I stated yes.  She then threw the bagel in the bag and threw it on the counter for me to reach for it. Please note I have been coming to your place of business for two years and have never received this treatment.  Due to this treatment, I've decided to no longer visit Outpost.  Please understand I have been a loyal frequent customer and would not be contacting you if I didn't feel this poor customer behavior didn't need to be addressed. In conclusion, the male worker also displayed unprofessional behavior at time discussing personal intimate behavior during business hours.  I know from past experience if you continue to employ workers who are unprofessional your business will not last in this community.  Please look into this matter by making an observation of these two workers because they are very unprofessional, do not prepare food in an appealing manner and do not practice proper sanitary guidelines.

"I went here yesterday with a few of my friends and I love it! I ordered a tuna salad on bagel which came with a side a fresh salad that was affordable.

"I like the layout of Outpost and their food and coffee is pretty good.  Overall, a good spot.  I have a few gripes, but mainly it drives me nuts that their music is so loud and even worse, it is not at a consistent level between songs.  I've seen a few times when people get startled after the music is quiet then suddenly gets loud.This won't keep me from coming back, and overall I am happy Outpost is here.  The backyard is nice, too.",3.0
"I like to move around a lot when I have to do work I would rather avoid. Coffee shops with Wifi are good locations for such behavior. I trekked over to outpost a few weeks ago (Tillie's was packed, jerks) on a sunny day and found it to be wonderful. No one bothered me as I drank my iced tea and nibbled on my bagel for 3 hours. The atmosphere was bright and sunny with practical tables for laptops (mac of course, we're in Brooklyn, are we not? Doesn't everyone have a BFA here?). Anyhow, as for getting grouchy work done, this place is perfect. Lots of juices and basic food. Lesbians. Ironic tattoos. You know the deal. It may be tough to snag a seat, but after a few vigilant minutes I got lucky. I think it's a lot easier when the back garden is open.",4.0
"Never too crowded, nice big tables to work on, and very friendly service.I like the laid back atmosphere and the curry chicken sandwich was pretty tasty.Wifi was warned to be a little tempermental but it worked without any issues for me.",4.0
The food here is overpriced and the service is bad.  The baristas act too cool to make your coffee and ignore the patrons.  I have no idea why anyone would go here instead of crossing the street to infinitely more pleasant experience of Desserts by Michael Allen.,2.0
"I came into this place because the place I wanted to go to for breakfast down the street was closed for some reason...so I kinda stumbled across Outpost. The place has a warm feel to it and the garden out back is really nice to sit down and have some coffee and read the newspaper...but unfortunately the day I was there it was just too humid in the morning so I didn't eat outside. I really wanted some eggs and bacon (because thats what I was going to get from the other place), but I was kind of disappointed that they don't really have that kind of breakfast there. They have a few different variations of bagels with toppings and some pastries but thats pretty much the extent of it. Needless to say I was a little bummed...but I didn't know where else to go and I didn't feel like walking too far since I live right around the corner. So I reluctantly ordered a bagel with cream cheese and lox with tomatoes on top. Once I wrapped my lips around that bagel I was pretty happy with my decision. The tomatoes where nice and fresh and the bagel was perfect...and how can you go wrong with lox?! So even though it wasn't what I wanted originally I still left there pretty happy with my breakfast.",4.0

"We like this quirky place a lot and we don't know why. The white wine is warm, the red is mediocre and the music is sometimes really strange and sometimes too loud. The coffee and the sandwiches though, are tasty and well prepared. Sometimes it's really delightful to sit in the window seat, open to the street, and watch the neighborhood characters go by. And at times there is a really comfortable feel to the place that's very appealing. A stray cat (we've named her Ms. Clawsson) sometimes comes in to sit and purr on the hassock, and DJ the chihuahua is always glad to sit on your lap. The backyard is scruffy and informal, there are cans of Off! here and there to ward off the bugs, and it feels very homey. But the counter staff sometimes makes us feel like we're imposing, or maybe not really welcome there. It could be us though, we're usually the oldest people there, the crowd is very serious; 20 and 30 somethings hunched over their laptops, transfixed by what's on their screens. I guess I was that serious once, but in retrospect, it was a bad idea. It also seems like Outpost is the center of the local gay scene, maybe, or maybe not, it's hard to tell when the crowd is so serious about editing their Facebook page.I don't know about the night scene, they have a chalkboard with events for every night. The place might have a very different character later at night. This neighborhood seems to be, after all, a night crowd, but us older folk are in bed by 10 so we don't know. This is the kind of place you have to try on for yourself, but we do recommend it, and give Ms. Clawsson and DJ a scratch for us.",4.0

The music mix is a little eclectic I've heard everything from Fiona Apple, to Spanish guitar, and a classical piano piece to old school hip hop.
