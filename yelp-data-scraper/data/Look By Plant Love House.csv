"Second to all my PH/CH neighbors who have been waiting for better authentically Asian food options in the area. We arrived at 930pm and they said we could still order dinner. I feel like showing up so late affected some of the dishes we ordered. The pick knuckle was a home run: perfect use of the Chinese 5 spice with morning glory and pickled veg on the side, this was my favorite dish. The Khao Soi curry was really good although they had way too many dried noodles and way too little curry (I think we got what was left of the evening). Also had the Yun Pak Boon Grab, a crispy watercress salad with pork; although the lightly battered watercress was not crispy at all and was overly chewy, probably again, because we had showed up so late.It's more expensive than Sky Ice, which was my go-to BK Thai, but still a bit less than Pok-Pok. Service was great and it's cash only. I will certainly come back earlier and try other stuff at Look, which seems to have a lot of potential.",3.0
"Finally something authentic in this part of Brooklyn. If I have to see another opening of a ""New American"" place I'm going to shoot myself. Get the pig knuckle. Just like in Thailand except 10x the price :) but good enough for me. Will be back here for sure.",5.0
"So envious of the people who live in this neighborhood because I can not possibly make the 40 minute travel to eat their food every time I want delicious Thai & super friendly waitresses! Thai cuisine is typically known for very savory and spicy dishes. Because I came here the day after I had an upset stomach, I steered clear of the extremely spicy dishes and ordered more mild ones. The Chiang Mai Khao Soy noodles that I ordered, although not indicated on the menu, comes mildly spicy and when I asked for less spicy it did not equate to less flavor. It comes with one giant drumstick that is extremely tender and has meat falling off the bone. The curry sauce was creamy, sweet, and def had some coconut cream/sauce infused. The red onion, cilantro, pickled cabbage and lime comes on the side so you can pick and choose which you want to dump in the bowl. The Num prik phow is something I would get when I'm craving something acidic yet sweet at the same time. It's more acidic than sweet, so if you're a hot and sour or tom yom soup type of person you'll love this. This bowl of noodles reminded me of ramen, but a chili paste soup base substitution instead of a tonkotsu one. Its hard boiled egg was perfectly cooked with its yolk still bright yellow. The khao pad nam prik pla too was the most bang for your buck dish out of the three. It covers your protein, carbs, sauce and veggies all in one pleasing plating. For $15, you get a decent sized mackerel, and something that can speak to each taste bud of your palate. Seafood dishes are rarely this cheap! Lastly, their desserts are priced at $9 a piece except for their toast which is $8 (they warn you that it'll take 10-15 mins to make this beforehand). Love their sizzling platter concept because I love my ice-cream melted and it was great that their fried roti and sizzling brownie was not overly sweet. I gave this place 5 stars because the city will definitely charge you a dollar or two more, and I really appreciate that their dishes don't overwhelm you like how some Thai restaurants do. Extremely cute restaurant that makes you feel like you're eating in a very welcoming home, which is why I might come back for a date night :). P.S. Cash only & expect to be spending in your 20s!",5.0
"Came here on a Tuesday night and it was pretty empty. My boyfriend and I have been to Plant Love House and loved it. This location? Not so much. Food: Since we had eaten a bit before, we came here just to try their corn fritters and a dessert. - Corn Fritters: ~7 to an order, and they're served with lettuce and a sauce for dipping. They are deep fried and taste mainly like some sort of fried dough. I could barely taste the corn in there. I've had corn fritters at a number of other places, so I was pretty disappointed with these. - Fried Roti: 6 pieces of Roti to an order, along with a scoop of ice cream and bananas. As per their signature, it was served on a sizzling hot plate and they poured milk and chocolate over it. It was good, but not good enough to make up for the corn fritters. Ambiance: I can see how this location is supposed to mirror the one in Elmhurst. The furniture was cute and homey. However, it lacks the same appeal because it was so dark in there. It gave the back a more dirty (for lack of a better word) vibe rather than intimate. Service: We were the only ones there, so of course the server was attentive and our food came out very quickly. I do appreciate that everyone greeted us on our way out, though!",3.0
"Very friendly serviceVery attentive serviceCool decorNice, untraditional soundtrackBUT...Really underwhelming food.Our Tuesday early dinner at this new offshoot of the (recently abandoned) Queens OG dnainfo.com/new-york/201… was fine, but we were hoping for a new neighborhood standby:Pad Thai Goong (certainly not your standard rendition. I enjoyed it, but girlfriend -- who ordered it -- didn't)Crab meat fried rice (""good for kid"" meaning tame/non-spicy, not the portion, which is average)Moo Manow (nice kick, but kind of a letdown for a ""Look Signature"")Plant Love Toast dessert (not sure why they don't list any of their three desserts on the website menu, even if some do rotate..our favorite part)",3.0
Thai food with some authentic dishes but average taste. The brownie skillet was cool to watch but resulted in a burnt brownie on the bottom. Friendly and attentive waiters. Interior was average with some posters put up.,3.0
"I've been here twice now and the food is really nice.  I loved the shrimp/pork soup that the servers recommend, but I warn that it is very spicy!  The homemade dumplings are nice, as are the wings.  However, the vermicelli noodles in the green curry were a bit mushy and the curry lacked a depth of flavor that I found in the other dishes.  The crab fried rice, which is advertised as good for kids was tasty as well (and half the price of the even tastier version at Uncle Boons).",4.0
Pork blood noodle soup is super delicious. Zabb wings are also excellent. Looking forward to going back and trying more things.,5.0
"I have recently moved from Jackson Heights to Prospect Heights. I was a little afraid that it was a culinary downgrade, at least for Thai and Chinese food, so I was beyond ecstatic that Plant Love House, one of my favorite restaurants in Elmhurst, was extending to Brooklyn.Aptly named ""look"", which means ""child"" in Thai, the place borrows many menu items from the parent location. Though I haven't been back to the original restaurant for a few months (one-hour train ride away!), the taste and service seemed consistent with their Queens standard.To be frank, I haven't tried (or more accurately, I don't dare try) any other Thai restaurants in this area so I am not quite sure if Look is really the best Thai in Brooklyn. However, from my experience with other popular places in Red Hook, this is by far the best.It is going to be hard to have a better offering in the borough of few Thai residents. In my two visits to Look, I have never seen other Thai customers and the menu features no Thai names. Look has really upped the standard of Thai cuisine in Brooklyn. I hope more will follow.",4.0
"My favorite Thai restaurant has moved to Brooklyn, the original in Queens was my home away from home.  The food is still great, just far for us Queen residents :-P.  The broth is still delicious for Nam Thok :-)  I come when I can trek down to Brooklyn and need home cooking.",5.0

"The food is pretty good albeit unremarkable and the prices are really reasonable, both positives for this Brooklyn outpost of Planthouse. They are cash only which can be super inconvenient. Slow and forgetful service (I had to ask for my Cha Yen twice) but maybe that's because they're new and getting slammed thanks to Eater putting these guys on their heat map (again, not sure why because it is pretty standard). Larb is yummy and the spice levels are on point. Sticky rice is reheated. Unlike a lot of other places they'll actually listen to you if you say you want things spicy and not just assume you're a farang with a love for all things bland and tasteless so that was much appreciated.",3.0
"Came here for lunch, place was pretty emptied was quickly seated in the table towards the back. Read some Yelp reviews before deciding on what to order as the menu selection wasn't too wide. Food came fast since we were the only patrons at the time. The Corn Fritters came out super hot and tasty with that sweet sauce as a condiment. Next was the Pork knuckle rice with vegetables and egg, tasted okay. Pad Thai was on point, I like the sour sauce that surrounds the noodles. But then the Pork Rind with ball of rice doesn't seem like its worth $12. And lastly, the Love Toast with ice cream on top also wasn't worth the $9bucks, its just two toast with lots of butter. It's triple the price of what you get at a gourmet deli. Service wasn't bad, and the place is very artsy",3.0

"I have relatively high threshold for spiciness but I thought I was going to choke to death when I had generous amount of hot chili in my mouth that was on the corner of Pad Thai.

"I really tried to like this place so I gave it a second try. But ultimately I find that their cooking techniques are kind of lazy. I ordered fried rice and it came deconstructed, as in I had to mix the ingredients myself. A scoop of plain rice in the middle, surrounded by scoops of raw scallions, raw onions, and sausage. For $12 I would have preferred that someone had spent the time to cook it for me instead of having to mix myself. It was also missing mango, which was a key ingredient listed on the menu. My noodle dish included vegetables that tasted a little old and again, it felt as if it had been prepared in under 5 minutes. Also, my shrimp pad thai came with only two shrimp. Seriously, two.
