"I have come here several times and I am never disappointed.Also the drinks are STRONG. Take an Uber home.I love that their menu is a repurposed old book!Friendly, helpful service. They comped us a drink after making a mistake and forgetting to prepare a drink we ordered, which I appreciated.Great happy hour. I think it's a few dollars off their cocktails.",5.0
"I had some time to kill and Wolf and Deer seemed like the perfect place to kill it.  They have a great happy hour from 5:00 - 8:00.  I love it when places extend happy hour to 8:00.  They have $9 cocktails and $5 beers.  It was a Tuesday so they also had pork sliders for $2 each that came in orders of two or six.  The place is long and narrow.  Not a lot of space, but they make it work.  Immediately upon entering I was handed a menu that looked like a book.  Well that's because it was a book.  The first bunch of pages were the menu, but the rest was an actual book.  I usually just go for the beer, but since this was a cocktail spot and it was happy hour I decided on the Curious George.  The cocktail was bourbon, scotch, banana, lime, ginger and topped with some nutmeg.  This just sounded amazing and it was.  As I was sitting there I saw someone had ordered the pork sliders and they looked delicious, so I asked the bartender for an order of three.  These came out fairly quickly and were quite amazing.  The bun was just the right size for the amount of meat and they pork was very moist and just melted in your mouth.  If you are there on a Tuesday you need to order these.",4.0
"Wolf and Deer is a small, intimate bar right by Barclays Center that serves delicious cocktails, a good selection of beer and wine, and an assortment of food options - meat & cheese plates, bar snacks, grilled cheese. From the ambience to the menu selections, this is a perfect place for a date night or catching up with a friend. Since it is right by Barclays Center, it is also a perfect place to grab a drink or two and some food before a game or concert (and luckily catch their happy hour). We came in around 10 PM on a Tuesday night looking for drinks and a small bite to eat. We had trouble deciding what to order since all the cocktails sounded appealing. You can tell a lot of thought and creativity went into the menu. Since their cocktails are named after children's books, I based my decisions on my two favorite childhood stories - Where the Wild Things Are and Charlotte's Web. Both were delicious. Where the Wild Things Are was a sweet cocktail with a nice spicy kick - I really loved this one and if it wasn't for the fact that I wanted to try something new, I would've gotten a second one. Charlotte's Web was a creamy egg-white cocktail. We also got a meat & cheese plate and pork sliders (Tues. special - $2 each for pork sliders). The standout was the Sofia cheese. If you love goat cheese and/or blue cheese, GET IT...it's amazing.Can't wait to come back and try more cocktails!",5.0
"We came here literally as the place opened at 5 before our Ranger/Islander game at the Barclays. Our bartender, Jackson, was one of the top 5 bartenders I have ever had make me a drink. Wolf and Deer is a small place, that gets packed once 6:00pm hits so grab a seat at the bar while you can. They are labeled as a wine bar but I think more craft than just wine because of all the cocktails, hand crafted in front of you and a few craft beers on tap. The happy hour deals are the craziest part! Especially Thursdays when they have $1 oysters. However, they did not have any oysters cleaned and shucked til 6:15 when happy hour starts at 5. Our bartender was apologetic that we had to wait over an hour for a dozen oysters but we finally got them 15 minutes before we left. They came stacked on a small plate and we weren't handed small plates so eating them was a little difficult. The cheese and charcuterie are top notch. They do a mix of three usually for $15 but HH, mix of three for $12. We started with that because of the oyster issue and had a couple cocktails to start. The Charlotte's Web was great and smooth mouth feel from the egg white. My girlfriend's cocktail came from the bartender recommendation but I forgot the name but loved the little spice after you sipped it.I would easily come back here but hopefully the oysters are ready. The reason I would come back is the bartending and the menu are easily some of the best in the area, especially with an amazing happy hour.",5.0
"Wow this place is just awesome. A tiny little bar with great happy hour specials, this place caters to wine, beer, and cocktail lovers. The bar is very narrow which gives the place an intimate setting. I came here with my boyfriend before the Rangers game to grab some drinks and a bite to eat. Their happy hour is amazing - special priced house cocktails, $12 cheese and meat board, and $1 oysters!!! We arrived a little after the place opened and sat at the bar. We chatted with the bartender Jackson who was very nice! The menu itself is very cool they're books! I had the drink Where the Wild Things Are and my boyfriend had the Charlottes Web. Mine was sweet with a nice little spice on the end of the drink and my boyfriends was nice and creamy from the egg white. They have a good selection of meats and cheeses on the menu. However, we were a little disappointed with the oysters. We had to wait over an hour for them when they should have been ready by 5. Not sure what was going on in the kitchen - they were very slow. We have another event at the Barclays center and I plan on coming back here beforehand. Jackson was the best bartender! He was very nice and he even took 20% off our bill AND gave us a free beer! This place rocks and I will definitely be back.",5.0
"I can't believe I haven't reviewed this place.  I love it!  Every cocktail I've had has been amazing. Each one is based on a different children's story, and the menus are inside of old books.  These cocktails are creative and well-thought out.  I think they change them periodically as well.  The last time I went, I had ""Where the Wild Things Are"". It was appropriately swampy in color.  I can't remember what was in it, but it was fantastic.  On previous visits, I've had the Alice in Wonderland and the Secret Garden (my favorite).  Their happy hour is such a steal.  Around $8 or $9 for their bartime stories.  Such a good deal for a well-crafed cocktail in a cute venue.",5.0
Wolf and deer must say the face of this place was definitely Jason aka J the man stumbled into this bar and fell in love very attentive greeted with water which I was a bit parched he probably reads minds lol humorous gent plenty of character definitely will be returning for Jason big ups on cocktail the secret garden !! Can't wait to try the food !,5.0
"I made a stop here after my besties  birthday. We were already pretty wasted by the time we stumbled in, what I really liked about this place was how the bar is set up. Its in a semi circle and the bartender is right in the middle. It was very easy to get her attention. Another cool part about this bar is the menus are inside of books. I was given the Spanish version of Harry Potter. The drinks are fun because the ingredients are fresh our bartender....Laura?! Was amazing she made us her take on a long island ice tea, which was amazing. Very light she put some kind of champagne in it. We were there until about 1:45 almost 2 and as the place died down we got to chat with the bartender ( sorry was plastered don't recall her name, I think it was Laura) she was funny and charismatic.A great stop if you are in the neighborhood.",4.0
"Food: split a board of meats and cheeses- the Sofia cheese was my favorite a combination of bleu and goat- amazing.. For meats the best was the fireball, a spicy salami... Didn't try any cocktails but there was a good selection of wine and beer Service: our bartender was really nice and friendly , but she did forget to ring in the salad we ordered, we ended up filling up on the charcuterie plate so it we didn't mention itAmbience: intimate, dim lighting.. Music was a little too loud... I wish the place had more seats! Loved that the menus came as an old fashioned book, cute idea",4.0

"Perfection of ambiance, service, food and drink.I came here solo quite early on (Friday, around 6pm), and stayed for about an hour and a half. This is a terrific place to have a few drinks and a light set of appetizers solo. The design of the bar is intimate, beautiful and very unique. I would delighted to come here on a date, but this is a magical place that was amazing on my own too. I had prosecco, red wine, and 3 cheeses. The cheese selection was chosen with the help of the bartender and was sublime, and the drinks were terrific.

"Wolf and Deer is a hip little bar in Park Slope. I really like the layout of the bar. The venue is pretty narrow - maybe only 10 feet wide. The bar is positioned as a peninsula placed down the middle of restaurant and is against the back wall. This adds extra bar seats due to the U shape.The bartenders are friendly and attentive. They served our drinks quickly and placed our food orders promptly with the kitchen. The service was superb.There's a small selection of excellent craft beers on tap and in bottles. There were about four on tap and eight bottles. There was a nice offering of wines and an outstanding selection of craft cocktails. I didn't order a cocktail, yet I witnessed the skill of the bartenders in making them. Truly a display of wonderful artisanship.We decided to order a couple appetizers. We had the deviled eggs and the beef rollers. The beef rollers were a simple beef taquito with a spicy Russian dressing like sauce. I really enjoyed the deviled eggs. I thought they were are nice pairing with the red wine I was having at the time.",4.0

It's in the middle of a great part of Brooklyn and has a fantastic drink menu with excellent bar staff. It's going to be expensive. It's also not a restaurant, so the lack of a diverse food menu is fine. It's very high-end bar food.I dig the place. The ambience is great. The location is great. The crowd is great.

Definitely try the ""choose your own"" meat and cheese platters (your choice of all meats, all cheeses, or a combination of both).  The meats come with spicy mustard and the cheeses come with spicy cherries.  A great deal for the quality of the selections!They also have excellent Mac & Cheese, which we paired with a fall-themed salad (photo).I would definitely go back!",5.0
"I've lived two blocks away from Wolf and Deer for the better part of three years and never noticed it.

What's not to like?Anyway, I had several of their cocktails. The Barnyard Dance (a spicy tequila based cocktail), the Secret Garden (a cucumber, minty, vodka/St. Germain one), and something else I don't remember because the first two drinks were so strong (something with candied ginger as a garnish). Good cocktails, especially at the happy hour prices ($8 a pop).The bar itself is pretty narrow (with the service area smack dab in the middle), and there's only one bathroom. So expect to have people brushing past you. The bar seats are also strange and not very comfortable (they have this weird narrow metal back).But other than that, I look forward to coming back.

"I've been here twice - once during happy hour (which is optimal based on their specials) and one other time on the weekend.  Nice variety of drinks and a quaint variety of food items.  As far as drinks, I had the Barnyard Dance - very spicy tequila based drink (not for those with mild tastes)... one word - awesome.   Then grabbed their amber ale on tap - again, very good and among three others available on draft.  It is a limited beer selection on tap but they have a few other bottled beers as well.

"I've been here twice - once during happy hour (which is optimal based on their specials) and one other time on the weekend.  Nice variety of drinks and a quaint variety of food items.  As far as drinks, I had the Barnyard Dance - very spicy tequila based drink (not for those with mild tastes)... one word - awesome.   Then grabbed their amber ale on tap - again, very good and among three others available on draft.  It is a limited beer selection on tap but they have a few other bottled beers as well.

"Wolf & Deer is a really cozy, chill, hip bar!!! My boyfriend and I hopped over to this place after work and it greeted us with open space, and dark decor. The open space was very surprising cause this place is TINY!!! They use very smart furniture and layout to accommodate for a large crowd and even a small crowd.The cool parts about Wolf & Deer is the beautiful tin ceiling, the names of the foods/drinks, and the menu!! The menu is inserted and attached into an actual hardcover book!! LOLTonight I had a delicious and beautiful ""James and the Giant Peach"" and a Pull-pork sliders. The drink had mint leaves, bourbon, and a peach .... With various other things. It was DELICIOUS! The sliders were very good. The little burgers came with pulled pork, coleslaw, and some special sauce in between two cute buns. My boyfriend had the 1911 Apply Cider and the Mac & cheese which was a hefty size and it came with a side of bread. I personally think it should have came with a small side salad because cheese and bread is a bit of an overkill on the carbs and fats wagon, Ya know? The crowd, for some reason, was mostly female (I don't know why) and young professionals which I thought was a little odd because it had more of a dark and masculine vibe .... But not masculine in a dive/sports bar kind of way but ....

Not only is it a creative idea, but it gives you something to read while waiting for drinks. I ordered the James and the Giant Peach. I loved the fresh ingredients and bright, fruity flavor.

"Came here for a drink during happy hour. Nothing particularly good or bad about it. It's a bit redundant for the area as there are several bars on 5th where you can get variations of classic cocktails. Personally, I found the drinks were fine, but nothing special (which is what I expect when a cocktail price hovers around $10). I've had better cocktails in the area and it seemed like whatever I had was trying a bit too hard to be unique. The menu is placed inside a book, which I think gives you a good idea of the type of place you are dealing with: if you are looking for a place that has a self-aware amount of pretense, this might be the place for you. Otherwise, it might be best to explore some of the other options in the area.",3.0

"Finally! A cocktail bar in Park Slope that has everything you're looking for in one - and there's no more need to venture out of the neighborhood anymore.Inventive cocktails? Yes. Delicious? Yes.  Atmosphere? Yes.  Unique decor and space? Yes. Happy hour? Yes.This is the place to be if you want to have an amazing cocktail as well as the place to take your friends. My favorite cocktail is definitely the Secret Garden: a mixed concoction of vodka, St Germain, lime, cucumber, mint.  Another interesting drink is the Barnyard Dance: infused spicy tequila, agave nectar, lime - and note, they do make it spicy so if you can't handle it, then you can tell them to make it less so.The space is just as amazing as the drinks.  It is not a typical bar scene and in fact you feel like you're not in Park Slope when you're here.I'm so glad that Wolf and Deer has an extended happy hour - until 8pm and it is every day, including weekends!",4.0

"Came here for a drink during happy hour. Nothing particularly good or bad about it. It's a bit redundant for the area as there are several bars on 5th where you can get variations of classic cocktails. Personally, I found the drinks were fine, but nothing special (which is what I expect when a cocktail price hovers around $10). I've had better cocktails in the area and it seemed like whatever I had was trying a bit too hard to be unique. The menu is placed inside a book, which I think gives you a good idea of the type of place you are dealing with: if you are looking for a place that has a self-aware amount of pretense, this might be the place for you. Otherwise, it might be best to explore some of the other options in the area.",3.0
"I love this place! Staff are amazing, friendly , knowledgable. They do a selection of seasonal cocktails plus any regular bar drink.  I'm not gonna lie, it'll be busy Saturday night but folks do there best to make sure everyone is served quickly, give it a look if you're in the area",5.0

"Finally! A cocktail bar in Park Slope that has everything you're looking for in one - and there's no more need to venture out of the neighborhood anymore.Inventive cocktails? Yes. Delicious? Yes.  Atmosphere? Yes.  Unique decor and space? Yes. Happy hour? Yes.This is the place to be if you want to have an amazing cocktail as well as the place to take your friends. My favorite cocktail is definitely the Secret Garden: a mixed concoction of vodka, St Germain, lime, cucumber, mint.  Another interesting drink is the Barnyard Dance: infused spicy tequila, agave nectar, lime - and note, they do make it spicy so if you can't handle it, then you can tell them to make it less so.The space is just as amazing as the drinks.  It is not a typical bar scene and in fact you feel like you're not in Park Slope when you're here.I'm so glad that Wolf and Deer has an extended happy hour - until 8pm and it is every day, including weekends!",4.0

"Great spot to grab a cocktail for happy hour. I came with my close girlfriend this past Monday March 3rd at 6 p.m. we had a female bartender... Who unfortunately was not friendly with us at all. I loved the atmosphere, music and drinks. But man did this woman kill our vibe.  My girlfriend and I are sincerely nice people. So we didn't understand why we were getting the cold shoulder.Anybody can make drinks but what makes a great bartender is one with the right personality. She kind of ignored us and made it so obvious we were her last priority compared to the other guest. Thankfully the other bartender- I think his name was James ? Tall with dark hair-got behind the bar with her because he was a people person for sure.

"Ok drinks - horrible service .. Came early for happy hour (6pm) a not busy cold Thursday night, 2 girls behind the bar very slow! Ordered 2 cocktails got 1 then the other 7m after. Not even a smile!! Ordered 2nd round ; 1 being a glass of wine and deviled eggs. I ask the girl how much longer for the boiled eggs (waited over 20m) she's like ""I put the order in.. "" as I asked for the check the girl brought it to me (was done w my glass of wine) and told me the eggs are on the way and charged me for something I was not gonna eat. I had to point it out to her. Then she removed it from my check. Hipster spot for people who don't care for any kind of service! Bill for 4 drinks $40 & Bad service!!! Priced less!!! Will not recommend this place ever!!!

"Wolf and Deer is the best: warm and inviting and comfortable, but still beautiful inside, with good music, and a number of fancy, delicious cocktail and food options.

My friend got the James and the Giant Peach which was also excellent, even for someone who's not a huge whiskey fan. We were in a hurry so couldn't order food but the food menu looked and smelled scrumptious and at one point we caught a strong waft of bacon. It was dark but not too crowded or loud on a Thursday night. Will definitely be coming back, maybe with a date.",5.0
"Came here for the happy hour and the food and drink was great. It has a great intimate atmosphere with the long double sided bar and the dim overhead lighting. The happy hour drinks were 8 dollars, the cheese plate, and entrees were 10 dollars. I got the fennel salad, cheese plate, and pulled pork sliders. For drinks we ordered the secret garden and james and the giant peach. I thought the drinks were refreshing and interesting, the salad was great with a good mixture of crunch, texture, sweetness and there was a interesting selection of hard and soft cheeses. My favorite was the sofia, it reminded me of a savory brea. The pulled pork was moist, with a spicy kick after you bite down on it. I think there was a pickled relish in there, it was very good. Thinking back the highlight for me were the in house pickled cherries that came with the cheese plate. It was amazing, it totally elevated the cheese and basically made your mouth water. The cherries was initially sweet but had a surprise burn of spice at the back of your mouth. Its the first time I tried something like it. The service was nice, there was only one bartender so she was busy but overall this is a solid place to check out if you're in the barclay center area.",4.0

"Best happy hour ever!!$8 cocktails, $6 wine, 3 for $10 cheese and charcuterie EVERY DAY from 5pm-8pm. Can it get better than that? The cocktails are expertly crafted, better than some of the hyped up speakeasies I've been to *cough*milk&honey*cough. I loved my drink, the Secret Garden, a refreshing concoction perfect for a muggy summer evening. My boyfriend's James and the Giant Peach was peachy, minty, and deliciously strong! Def take advantage of their bargain cheese and charcuterie. Don't skip the duck breast or Quadrello! The highly reviewed Kunik cheese was sold out for the evening so I'll be back to try that. Wolf and Deer is an excellent place to go with one or two good friends to have a low key drink and share a few bites.",5.0
"Went here for happy hour one night and was very pleasantly surprised. Happy hour is $8 cocktails and $6 wine. I'd wager to say the bartender made me the best cocktail I've had- the Barnyard Dance. Spiced tequila, lime juice, and agave- SO good. Also had the Green Eggs and Ham, and tried the James and the Giant Peach and Secret Garden. All were delicious. The bartender was super sweet and the decor was cool. I'll definitely be going back for their happy hour!",5.0
"This is a place to take THA LADIEZ.Seriously though, this is such a nice place.  Quiet, courteous, and meticulous bartenders (the best kind).  A seriously great happy hour (their pricey but awesome cocktails get slashed to 8 bucks, cheap drafts and wines, and happy hour snack deals).  That cucumber cocktail they do is one of my all time favorites.  The wine list is great too.  I just can't say enough nice things about this place--I had such a nice time here.  Impress women, or your parents, and bring them here for some late afternoon libations.",4.0

"I've been frequenting this wine bar for the past couple of months and I have yet to be disappointed.  The service is impeccable and both the drink and food menu are amazing.  Coupled with the fact that their Happy Hour is one of the best I've experienced.  Who can beat $4 drafts, $6 wine, and $8 cocktails for 3 hours? I initially came here because it was close by, but immediately became a fan because they offer the Left Hand Milk Stout.  Now if you're a fan of Guinness, this absolutely blows it out of the water, in my opinion.  It's the perfect blend of smooth chocolate/coffee flavours, great for winding down after a long day's work.Their happy hour also offers $10 cheese or charcuterie plates, with 3 choices to a set and many selections available.  If this isn't your thing, no need to fret.  Their bites and sandwich menu is nothing to sneeze at.I'd recommend their deviled eggs as a bite, but make sure you're a fan of garlic. It's definitely worth it.As for sandwiches, I would recommend their pulled pork, which unfortunately is only seasonal and is in fact going to come off the menu by the end of this weekend, so don't miss out!  If you can't make it out in time, plan B I would recommend the grilled cheese with truffle oil.  All their sandwiches are served with a kale and apple salad with a light vinaigrette and kettle cooked chips.The best times to come are definitely Thursday and Friday nights.  Thursday has $1 raw oysters and Friday nights are always bustling, especially if the Barclay's Center has something going on.  If you're in the area, Wolf and Deer is definitely not a place to be missed.",5.0

"Wolf and Deer, brought to us by the owners of the fabulous restaurant, Miriam, is a vast improvement over Total Wine Bar. The decor is sleek with hidden door handles, metal seats, and a visually stunning u-shaped bar with upside down wine glasses suspended above it like a chandelier. Although the space is still small, Wolf and Deer makes much better use of it by eliminating the odd tables Total Wine Bar had and replacing them with three rows of seats in the front, in a style similar to that of Bar Veloce.

"Just dropping by the neighborhood, somehow we end up there because of the Happy hour sign.   Very small and tiny place which is OK. However, only two bartenders and very limited service.  You just have to walk up there.  The price for regular wine is a little over price because I can see the bottle do not cause more than $15, but they charge $6 per charge.  So, 50% of benefits easy.   The HH foods was OK.  The decor is simple and nothing special about it.  It's a place for business.  I didn't catch the female bartenders name, but she need to smile and be more friendly to non-local customer.  Bring in the smile and you can get more tips.  U know.",3.0
Great cocktails and great vibe all around. Liz was the our bartender and was attentive & quick. Had the shrimp cocktail and a cheese plate. So delish!,5.0
"Best happy hour ever!!$8 cocktails, $6 wine, 3 for $10 cheese and charcuterie EVERY DAY from 5pm-8pm. Can it get better than that? The cocktails are expertly crafted, better than some of the hyped up speakeasies I've been to *cough*milk&honey*cough. I loved my drink, the Secret Garden, a refreshing concoction perfect for a muggy summer evening. My boyfriend's James and the Giant Peach was peachy, minty, and deliciously strong! Def take advantage of their bargain cheese and charcuterie. Don't skip the duck breast or Quadrello! The highly reviewed Kunik cheese was sold out for the evening so I'll be back to try that. Wolf and Deer is an excellent place to go with one or two good friends to have a low key drink and share a few bites.",5.0
"Went here for happy hour one night and was very pleasantly surprised. Happy hour is $8 cocktails and $6 wine. I'd wager to say the bartender made me the best cocktail I've had- the Barnyard Dance. Spiced tequila, lime juice, and agave- SO good. Also had the Green Eggs and Ham, and tried the James and the Giant Peach and Secret Garden. All were delicious. The bartender was super sweet and the decor was cool. I'll definitely be going back for their happy hour!",5.0
"This is a place to take THA LADIEZ.Seriously though, this is such a nice place.  Quiet, courteous, and meticulous bartenders (the best kind).  A seriously great happy hour (their pricey but awesome cocktails get slashed to 8 bucks, cheap drafts and wines, and happy hour snack deals).  That cucumber cocktail they do is one of my all time favorites.  The wine list is great too.  I just can't say enough nice things about this place--I had such a nice time here.  Impress women, or your parents, and bring them here for some late afternoon libations.",4.0
Yum! Try the James and the Giant Peach (with tequila instead of bourbon!),5.0
Only like $8 cocktails during happy hour. I really like the barnyard dance. Place is quiet and has nice mood lighting for dates. Good place to come catch up with someone.,4.0
"I've been frequenting this wine bar for the past couple of months and I have yet to be disappointed.  The service is impeccable and both the drink and food menu are amazing.  Coupled with the fact that their Happy Hour is one of the best I've experienced.  Who can beat $4 drafts, $6 wine, and $8 cocktails for 3 hours? I initially came here because it was close by, but immediately became a fan because they offer the Left Hand Milk Stout.  Now if you're a fan of Guinness, this absolutely blows it out of the water, in my opinion.  It's the perfect blend of smooth chocolate/coffee flavours, great for winding down after a long day's work.Their happy hour also offers $10 cheese or charcuterie plates, with 3 choices to a set and many selections available.  If this isn't your thing, no need to fret.  Their bites and sandwich menu is nothing to sneeze at.I'd recommend their deviled eggs as a bite, but make sure you're a fan of garlic. It's definitely worth it.As for sandwiches, I would recommend their pulled pork, which unfortunately is only seasonal and is in fact going to come off the menu by the end of this weekend, so don't miss out!  If you can't make it out in time, plan B I would recommend the grilled cheese with truffle oil.  All their sandwiches are served with a kale and apple salad with a light vinaigrette and kettle cooked chips.The best times to come are definitely Thursday and Friday nights.  Thursday has $1 raw oysters and Friday nights are always bustling, especially if the Barclay's Center has something going on.  If you're in the area, Wolf and Deer is definitely not a place to be missed.",5.0

"After an unsuccessful dropoff (boo) at Beacon's Closet, we headed over for a quick happy hour to coddle our disappointment...Wolf & Deer is simple and straight-forward, with quality.  Really love the clean, old-fashioned-with-a-modern-twist to the decor here, the glasses up high reflecting the light beautifully (and the glass apothecary doors are pretty sweet, too).  Normally, I would feel claustrophobic in a narrow place like this, but the room still feels relaxed and airy--the open wall in the front (dogs are welcome to lounge right outside ;) and the gorgeous mirror on the left wall opened it right up.  High ceilings too.  Warm and friendly bartender- doesn't impose and knows the menu well.  We ordered two glasses of Vermentino to start.  I'm normally a red girl, but I've been lightening up to white recently.  This was dry (not too dry) just like I like em, but with a super-subtle undertone of fruit.  $6/glass and generous pours.  He even opened a new bottle to top off my friend's second glass.  Nice service.We ordered a 'mini' charcuterie of Proscuitto and two cheeses for $10.  The Pleasant Ridge reserve was a KNOCKOUT (no wonder it's award-winning) and the Prosciutto had a nice little sweetness to it.  The second cheese (can't remember, I think it was a soft goat's milk) was also really good, and a great counterbalance to the Pleasant Ridge (nutty and smooth, reminds me of a mellower Prima Donna).  The cherries soaked in brandyandchiles were Delish and the bread points strong enough in deft and texture to withstand a variety of cheeses.Overall, a great place.  I didn't think they'd put two bartenders in the same shift (since it's such a narrow bar), but by the time we paid our bill, a second came in and fit right in, no problem.  I wonder how they move when they get busy....

"I loved this cute little wine bar in park slope. I came in on the reocommendation of a friend who lives in the neighborhood.  I was with my boyfriend who commented that it didn't have personality. I couldn't have disagreed more! It hought it was cute and charming. THe bar is a circle in the middle of the room.  The choice seats are definitely around the bar. It's great for people watching, plus it's fun watching the bartender make all the drinks in the center.(I think maybe the bf said that because the decor is minimalist? Not sure, but he changed his mind soon enough.)The menu is brought to you in a book.  It's an oldschool hard back book, and the menu is listed in the first few pages before the book actually starts. LOVE. LOVE LOVE. The happy hour is phenomenal. $6 glasses of wine, $4 beers.  Both the beer and wine selection is solid.  We were both pleased with our choices of beverages.  But the best part is the 3 cheese/meat plate for $10.  Firstly, typically the meat options are all some variation of pork.  I don't eat pork (for the most part.)  But this place had a duck option.  So we got two cheeses and the duck.  The duck is quite possibly the best duck i have ever had.  Yeah. I said that. It was unbelievably tender and not greasy the way duck can sometimes tend to be. Both cheeses were great. We had one hard and one soft.  Can't remember the names, but based on the bartender's recommendation.  Speaking of, he was quite the charming gentleman - very friendly and his recommendations were spot on.Thanks Mike Walters, for introducing me to this place.",5.0

"I think it's really about time I wrote a review for this place...considering I practically live here.This is a great little spot for various occasions: quiet chats with friends, flirting across the narrow bar with other patrons (hopefully for your sake they're flirting back!), sipping on a glass of wine or cocktail after a long day of work to just wind down, small intimate _________ (insert type of party) parties.Their cheese/meats selection is pretty solid. I highly recommend this combo: Saucisson (spicy meat), Finochionna (peppery meat), Kunik (soft creamy cheese).The drinks are good. They have a few staples like James & The Giant Peach but rotate some of the other drinks when they're bored or during a change of season. I, personally, am looking forward to their warm rum cider this winter. It's so damn good.The bartenders are very friendly and know what they're doing. I wouldn't necessarily call them mixologists but the bar has a slight mixology feel to it due to their cocktails.The ambiance is what really does it for me. It's very chic in a Brooklyn kind of way. I don't know if that really makes sense. The other co-owner of the bar works with iron and essentially built the bar (including the amazing wine-glass rack that hangs from the ceiling that wraps around the bar).

"Very cool and romantic little wine bar on the upper end of 5th Ave.  Stopped in here over the weekend for pre-dinner cocktails and was not disappointed.  My wife had the cucumber and St. Germain drink, while I had the spice-infused tequila drink.  Don't remember the names of either, but both were delicious.  They have a nice selection of wines by the glass, as well as some small plates to choose from.  Overall, great vibe, very relaxed and sexy.  We definitely plan to go back!",4.0
"Stopped in for an after dinner drink one Wednesday. Great vibe, great service, and the James and the Giant Peach cocktail was delicious. More than I like to pay on a regular basis, but looking forward to coming back for happy hour/special occasions.",4.0
"Great place. Sleek and modern with steel fixtures, yet warm with brick walls and deer/elk horn for tap handles. Attentive staff , knowledgeable on the wines and willing to draw a sample of each. Signature cocktails are well thought out, with my favorite being the'Secret Garden' which is a vodka base with a cucumber, mint, lime and St Germaine mix. A well thought out selection of diverse cheeses and meats make this a great pre-dinner/ movie stop. Good stuff.",5.0
"I recently was here because of a lovely lesbian wedding that booked the place for their reception. That said I think it is unfair of me to fully judge this place as I was not here during normal hours of service. What I can say is that Frank the bartender is a hot piece (yes, I just said ""Hot piece"") and worth going to Wolf & Deer just to chat him up and have him service you all evening long!!! The decor is also really cute and albeit a very small venue I could imagine good times being had here if I were a resident of Park Slope. Oh! I don't know what they did to the Bellini I was drinking all afternoon but it was definitely be of the most delicious things to ever grace my lips! Hopefully I'll have a chance to go back, visit Frank, and give y'all the full 411 on what I expect is a delightful gem in Park Slope!Deliciously Living,Michael",5.0
"This dimly lit spot is meant for date night or an intimate evening chatting it up with a few friends. It's Park Slope's rendition of ""grown and sexy"" while still attracting a young and hip crowd as well as people who are a little more, um, seasoned! The menus are all stapled inside of full-length novels, which is a fantastic way to keep yourself occupied while awaiting the arrival of a friend (or date), or if you're waiting for one of the fantastic barkeeps to mix you up on of Wolf and Deer's sippable speciality cocktails. My favorite is the Barnyard Dance. It could be the tequila, but it's probably the paprika salt around the rim that keeps me coming back for this spicy delight. Ideal evening: pick three cheeses paired with a baguette and order your choice of cocktail, beer, or wine, then let the good vibes flow. Make it a point to pack light when Wolf and Deer is your destination. There's not a lot of space in this cozy gem so keep the baggage to a minimum!",5.0
"cute little wine/cocktail bar right near barclays center.  awesome happy hour deals that run from 5-8PM and all week!  ($8 cocktails).  i loved james and the giant peach and the secret garden (kind of reminded me of a fancy pim's cup).  we ordered the mac & cheese and it looked amazzzzing when it came out!  but, didnt get a chance to sample it because we had to run to our concert (coldplay!) next time!",5.0
"Wolf and Deer named after the owners' young sons took over the ""Total Wine Bar"" location and opened up just a couple days ago. We came in tonight (day 3) to grab a drink and check the place out. The decor is very industrial but in an interesting way, lots of metal, rough edges, interesting use of wood like the gnarled handles for the beer taps. They have a huge U-shaped bar from where the bar tenders serve up drinks. Menus are embedded in books selected by owners, kind of a quirky/cool touch.The list of wines by the glass are not extensive. They do have a lot of wines by the bottle but at quick glance many are in a more than average price range. We got 2 glasses of nero d'avola and one Spanish wine. We also got an order of 3 cheeses which came out with some spiced dried berries and sliced baguette, (one of many items on their menu). The service was friendly but slightly awkward with the bar tenders still figuring out where things were stored and what was on their menu. The other  thing that was really distracting/slightly disturbing was there were tiny fruit flies zooming around which only got worse when our wines came. The music was also on but was random.I'm not sure if was the flies, the music or the staccato in the service but this place didn't strike me as having the fluid vibe you want in wine/cocktail bar. I feel bad because again, it's always nice to have new places in the neighborhood but I really do think that regardless of whether it's opening day or 2 years in, you need to work hard to make people feel welcome, make sure everyone's prepared and get the mood right.I'm not sure if I'd go back, maybe if they figure out their rhythm.",2.0
"I don't know why it took me 6 months to come here. Wolf & Deer is adorable, the bartenders are incredibly sweet, the atmosphere is awesome, and everything about it is almost pitch perfect. The happy hour deals for their signature cocktails make it even better.If the pear/egg white cocktail is still on the menu, give it a taste run. Will be back many, many times. A welcome addition to the Northern part of the Slope.",5.0

Good happy hour.  $10 cheese platter hit the spot as a pre-dinner snack.  They had well-priced happy hour drink specials but I somehow ended up with a $12 glass of headache-inducing wine instead of the $6 special (if I'm going to feel hungover from one measly glass of wine it may as well be a cheap glass).  Just make sure you clarify what you order and this is an affordable after-work happy hour spot with good cheese (&$1 oysters on Thursdays that I didn't try).,4.0

"New place - so I'll forgive them still working out some kinks. This place might be classified as as 'wine bar', but for me, the draw is the cocktail list. The bartenders seem to know what's up - shaking and stirring some of the better cocktails I've had at extremely reasonable prices. However, the cocktail list is hit and miss, so this place might take some practice. At least they're strong!",4.0
"Love this place - it's just around the corner from our apartment.  Fantastic atmosphere, great menu, great bartenders who take their time with each drink.  I highly recommend the cucumber cocktail (can't remember the name) - but everything I've had here is great.  An ideal date spot.",4.0
"Went by with a couple of friends for some drinks and eats before a show at BAM.  The food and cocktails were quite good.  Unfortunately, the snotty bartender put a damper on our experience.  She was quite rude and short...which is a service industry no-no.  I've been a bartender for many years, so I do expect good service in a place like Wolf and Deer.  The quality of their food and cocktails did not match this girl's crappy attitude.  Luckily the other bartender was quite nice.  But we won't be back.  Wolf and Deer is a lovely place, but some attention should be paid to the quality of their ""hospitality.""",3.0
Always have a nice time here. Staff is friendly. Crowd is cool. I'm a fan!,4.0
"Very friendly, helpful  bartender and cool ambience here. We hit it at happy hour which offered good value.  We didn't eat here but the menu looked very interesting. In fact, the beverage and food menu here is very eclectic.  I would return.",4.0
"I ve been super excited to check this place out,so me and a friend went there on a sunday night around 10:30pm. There were 6 people having drinks at the bar,but the bartender awkwardly said that we can only stay for a ""quick one"". We came all the way from the city and it was really lame. I am a bartender too and i get it,we all just wanna go home,but come on-last call at 10:30 on a halloween weekend? Pretty disappointing.",1.0
"Wolf and Deer is the best. Edwin and Frank, the bartenders, are great. Drinks are amazing. Atmosphere is lovely and the prices are fantastic!",5.0
"Wolf and Deer is a very stylish bar -- maybe too stylish.  I mean, the name is basically the #1 indie rock band name noun of 2005 + the #1 indie rock band name noun of 2009.  Eyeroll.  The ovular bar was beautiful, but throwing the menu into an old book was trying a little hard.  My menu came in a book about menstruation, which didn't exactly whet my appetite, so I opted to not sample the food.  The techno music was unbearable, but the bartender was so friendly that I couldn't bring myself to complain.  It's the kind of bar where people in their 30s who only wear black, gray and denim go to get laid, and anyone in another demographic is there to insecurely exert their coolness.  Which is basically what single 30-somethings who don't wear color are doing, anyway.  I'm guessing this place is better on a weeknight, when it's more about unwinding and less about displaying your feathers.  It's lovely, but the whole thing is kind of a candlelit parody of itself.",3.0
"This was my second time at Wolf and Deer, catching up with a good friend and having a lovely time escaping from the sweltering heat outside. The place is small but nice and great for a long conversation. The meat and cheese plates are super tasty, the happy hour is great, and they even have oysters. But sadly, Wolf and Deer and me had to break up today because when my friend and I looked down at our plate, it turned out we were sharing our prosciutto with a sizable ROACH! He made a pass at the oysters too, at which point my friend shrieked and the bartender took the offensive plate away with Mr. Roach scurrying off down the bar. I'm sure he found a new tasty treat in no time. We were comped the price of the dish the roach sampled but feel like we should have been comped our whole check. I was too frazzled and disgusted to think about it and feel like the bartender was a little too nonchalant about the whole thing. I'm pretty bummed because I did really like this place, but I obviously will not be coming back. They should not be serving food. Guess I have to learn to make my own cool cucumber drink.",1.0
"popped by monday for a catch up nightcap with a gal pal.  i got the pink moon - gin based, which i like to say is a fancier g &t with lime and grapefruit juice.  it was good.  my pal had the james and the giant peach but they ran out of peaches.  i had a sip and that cocktail was pretty sweet.  i like to taste my bourbon.  they have good cheese and meat platters on saturdays, so i might be back to check those out.",3.0
close but no cigar.  should do more with the front area.  food menu not quite big/good enough.  ambiance almost but not quite - the menu/book idea isn't bad per se but execution was just kind of cheap and shoddy.  this place really has potential if they go all in,3.0
"Happy to have this place! in the hood.  Friendly staff, nice wines, had the grilled cheese and a salad and it was tasty.",4.0
"Love this small, but intimate/cute bar. Perfect for a date or for a girls cocktail hour -- never too crowded, always could talk at normal talking voices The mixologists are great, with mixed drinks that could rival some of the more expensive speak easys of Manhattan. Their mixed drink menu has always been different each time I've visited.  The wines are all very crisp and well chosen.  If interested in appetizers, try the charcuterie/cheese plates or their special deviled eggs.",5.0
"Personal. Intimate. Friendly bartenders and staff. Circle seating around the bar. Classy decor. They'll open any bottle if you get at least two glasses. Menus printed in old, dated books that double as hilarious conversation-starters. Really great little wine/cocktail bar for an area without many.",5.0
