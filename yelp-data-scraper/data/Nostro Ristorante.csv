"Well, it looks like I don't have to say too much because everyone has taken care of it. I completely agree with every review here. Have been there twice and both times was treated to delicious, very fresh, authentic Italian fare in a cozy and friendly setting. Prices are ridiculously reasonable and the BYOB is actually kinda nice. (There are two wine stores nearby, FYI.) So great to have this in the neighborhood!!!PS. It looks like they do delivery, too!!!  They're on Grubhub!",5.0
"Can't I give this place 6 stars?? My boyfriend and I have been here 3 times in the past month. We love it! The food is fantastic, the wife is so amazingly hospitable and such a genuinely good woman who wants to serve the best possible food, and it shows! BYOB, but there's an awesome wine shop also on 5th, closer to Prospect Avenue that used to be Adam's. The guys there will definitely set you up with an amazing bottle to complement the food. Do it!",5.0
"Easily some of the best Italian cuisine to be found in Brooklyn! The prices are very reasonable and the portions are pretty large. Don't forget to BYOBCrostini burrata: a wonderful balance of textures and flavors. The fresh burrata is the first thing you notice but the pesto is the star of the show.Fragole e spinaci salad: The strawberries, Gorgonzola and aged balsamic are wonderful compliments to one another. Lasagna bolognese: A classic comfort food. And really warmed me up after the cold weather. The sausage in the bolognese could have a dish of its own (hint hint!)Cannoli: I'm a sucker for cannoli, and this is some of my favorite in the city!",5.0

"Nostro Ristorante - What a delight! The warm ambiance, lovely service, and of course the FOOD.  It is also BYOB which is great, and so we had a bottle ready for poppin upon arrival. Finally, the prices are amazing - what food should actually cost in a restaurant. It's always great when food is reasonably priced and you are not sacrificing it for it quality in any way. I told my wife during the meal that it felt like I was eating at my mother's or grandmother's - that's always a good thing; eating well past the point I was full truly resembled a home cooked experience. Nothing pretentious about the place or the food. There were too many things on the menu that sounded great (kale pesto gnocchi for one) which I did not have a chance to try, so will obviously have to return.So the food. Mamma mia! For appetizers we had the kale Caesar salad and also the crostini spread with pesto and topped with burrata and roasted peppers (crostini burrata). Yes it all tasted as good as it sounds. You can never go wrong with burrata, and the flavors went great together. A must have. As for the kale caesar salad, that was also great. I do not normally order caesar salads but had a feeling they would do it right here, and they did. For entrees we were just in the mood for pasta and it seemed like we couldn't miss on anything we chose. When we asked the owner for her recommendation, she had a hard time narrowing it down as she explained they developed the menu based on their favorite home recipes - I loved hearing that. So we went with the Pasta e Piselli and the owner beamed when we ordered that (their website describes this dish as one of their most loved dishes). We also ordered the lasagna. The lasagna was great, pasta was clearly fresh and light, using béchamel which adds something special. The Pasta e Piselli was equally great, with this dish just reminding me of something my mother or grandmother would make on a week night - have never seen this pasta dish on an Italian menu before but it is supposedly a dish of Naples (where I believe the owners are from).I would have a hard time returning and not wanting to have what we ate again. But I have heard their lamb chops are delicious and for 16 doll hairs!!! I recently had lamb chops at two Italian restaurants in Manhattan and they each were close to $40 bucks - they were delicious but the price gap is just plain nutty. I hope that when people catch on to this gem, they don't up their prices too much.My wife and I shared two desserts which is rare as we don't usually get dessert too much. So this was more of a testament to the atmosphere and overall experience. We had the tiramisu and affogato. Both were delicious. Havent had an affogato since Italy so this was a treat. Look forward to more dinners here and I wish the owners success. Arrivederci Nostro Ristorante!",5.0
"Came New York and decided to spend a few evenings in Brooklyn at an Airbnb to discover a new neighborhood. Luckily we came across Nostro. We had a lovely evening eating authentic Italian food. The highlights for us were the crostini with Burrata cheese, the calamari, and the eggplant parm.",5.0

Just have to say wow....the couple who run the place are amazing. The food is over the top delicious.  The lamb chops are so tender and tasty.  The cannelloni was out of this world good.  I can't wait to go back and try the other things on the menu.,5.0
"This newly opened restaurant  welcomed  us warmly and we went on to enjoy  a great meal. Bring your own wine and be prepared to eat a very delicious seafood dish with risotto (not soggy or gummy), appetizers just perfectly prepared and best of all a charming authentic  Italian hostess. Will we go back? You  bet!!",5.0
"OMG so excited that this hidden gem is just around the corner from my house. The food it SOOOOOOO good! The burrata appetizer & calamari are to die for. The squid ink pasta with lobster, shrimp and pink sauce is amazing. The tiramisu is the hand made there, and it's the best I've ever had! This place is owned by a sweet lady who runs the place, and her equally amazing husband who does all of the cooking! It's a genuine mom & pop with a cozy, romantic atmosphere, and very affordable! Also it's BYOB - great for a small date and large groups! My best friend had her birthday dinner here and the great reviews didn't disappoint. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!",5.0
"Look at all these 5 star reviews people, and believe it! This place is what you want in an Italian spot; mom in the front, pop in the back, everything homemade, etc etc etc. I've recommended this spot to everyone who would listen and the feedback has been universally great. Heck, I suggested this to so many people that groups of my friends actually ran into each other there! Grab a nice bottle or 2, and head on down. Don't be afraid to leave a glass for the kitchen if you're as impressed as I was.By the way the first thing the host/server/owner told us when she approached our table was that they were out of a few things. This is because they make all the pasta daily, so when something is out, it's out! No complaints here; Burrata Caprese, Bresaola Carpaccio, Seafood Risotto, Seafood Fettuccine, and a dish featuring hand cut spaghetti whose name I forget were ALL delicious and warranted us reaching all over the place eating off of each others plates. Top notch addition to the neighborhood.",5.0

"Questo posto e...come sei dice Romini ? A god Send ! A truly delightful addition to the neighborhood. Romini and Agostino ( how's my spelling ? ) this great cpl from Napoli just opened this restaurant and it's dynamito !The food is delicious, the service is passionate; the integrity is palpable. The prices are super smart, they are perfect for the offerings and the market---smart business, from someone who owns a business. I haven't tasted anything yet lackluster, it's all wonderful. I'm at this place all the time now. We need MORE in SouthSlope/Greenwood whatever you want to call it. This place is a class act, take it from someone with taste ! And class !  So refreshing ! Keep it coming south slope and I'll stop fantasizing about moving back to Manhattan or Dumbo ! This place has soul, the food is scrumptious, the service is caring and honest and warm !!!",5.0

"This spot is brand-new (3 weeks old!) and judging by what I experienced tonight... This is, right out of the gate, among the very best Italian food in the neighborhood.  And by neighborhood, I mean Brooklyn.It's run by a husband-and-wife team who clearly care deeply about running a restaurant the right way, and doing justice to the food that is their heritage and their passion.  To think there are so many overpriced and underconsidered restaurants around Park Slope--  It's truly a wonder to walk into a brand-new establishment, sit down, and immediately be served simply the best lamb ragu pappardelle you've ever had, outside of a hole-in-the-wall in Sienna.  And not one single dish exceeds eighteen(!) dollars.  I understand that Milan's (which Nostro replaced) was a beloved neighborhood fixture, but this restaurant isn't some cold corporate cash-in... It's authentic Italian made with love, skill, and care that is truly rare.  This is the restaurant you have been dreaming would open in your neighborhood.  Well here it is, in mine.  And I'm not giving it back.I ate there 4 hours ago, and I'm already jazzed to go back.  If a restaurant this fine doesn't succeed, then it will be because we simply don't deserve them.  Nostro shames all the local joints whose prices have soared as their quality plunged (hello, Sidecar!) and is stiff competition for all the neighborhood gems I adore (you got some serious company, Lot 2!)",5.0

"When I first saw all of these 5 star reviews, I actually thought it looked suspicious but decided to give it a try. I ordered the cannelloni stuffed with ricotta yesterday to be delivered on seamless. It was really good so today I tried the squid ink pasta with shrimp and lobster. It is SO amazing I'm SO so so happy this restaurant joined the neighborhood AND they deliver! Its so good! Portions are on the smaller side but the food is a 10!!",5.0
"They excelled in food and hospitality even if the physical restaurant appears unrefined. Don't let the earnest graphics on the awning deter you. We ate here as a group of four on a Friday evening, about a week after they first opened. The owner -- who is also the host and, for now, the sole waiter -- attended to us intuitively throughout our meal. She wanted us to enjoy ourselves from beginning to end and graciously made sure we did. The Neapolitan food is more specific and refined than any restaurant in this neighborhood. I really enjoyed their bresaola, eggplant parm, seafood risotto, meatballs and pappardelle with lamb ragu. Take advantage of the BYO while you can. They don't even charge for corkage. We brought Falanghina and Aglianico and they each found a connection with the meal. I'm looking forward to tasting the rest of the menu, soon.",5.0
