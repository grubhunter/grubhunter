A great place to get a burger.It can get crowded and loud and there is often a wait but I've always had a good dining experience at the Oxcart.,4.0
"Get here early on the weekend for brunch, or expect to wait. Also, when they call your name, you better be ready to go, or you'll get run over by the next person waiting on the list. After all, this is New York City...not Atlanta.Fish and chips are the best I've ever had. Sit at the bar if it's just you and another - more personalized service you get to see all the hustle and bustle!Have the brunch punch. Wife had the burger and was very happy with it. Ticket time was 45 min, but was well worth the wait. Have your expectations in line.We'll be back. Staff is incredibly hospitable. Great music, too.",5.0
"Went here for brunch. Tiny cozy place, not as packed as I thought. The service was pretty bad. The waitress neglected us, and we had to wait for everything as the waitress stood around by the bar not doing much.The food was great. I had fried chicken and biscuits , and some more biscuits. It was delicious!!!! Especially with an amazing Bloody Mary . Yum I will be back.",4.0
"I had the ""good ole boy"" burger, it was tasty.  The salads are good. The only critisim is that the drinks are not consistently great. The staff is always a pleasure.",4.0
"It was my first time and I will definitely be back. Oxcart is a little spot, so if you've got a big crowd of people just know it's going to be cramped. But honestly, I think that's part of what makes it so charming.Anyway, the food was out of this world. We had the chicken liver patê and the pretzel for appetizers. Thumbs up! For my main dish I had the lamb lasagna and she had one of the burgers. Everything was delicious. For dessert we had their special, which last night was the blood orange tarte. Holy molely, just put it in your mouth. *ps. it looks like a great date spot if you're into that kinda thing",5.0
"This is a true gem in the unpopular streets of Brooklyn. This place has it all: great food, great selection of beer, and great atmosphere. If you are a burger and wing fan this is your spot!",5.0
"Nothing special. Ordered the Mac & cheese and fried pickles to start. Took forever to come. Neither of them were good or memorable. Got the Cali burger. Pretty dry, didn't finish it. Also the fries weren't great either. Everything was edible, not horrible but not what I look for in a meal. Wouldn't return.",2.0
"Interesting and accidental find. Me and my girlfriend were looking for a close by place in Brooklyn to enjoy a quick new years dinner before the big rush.  We stumbled across this place on Yelp and decided to try it out.  To our surprise it was in Newkirk. I never got off at this stop but we decided to just go for it.  We walked two blocs from the train station and saw this place.  It sticks out like a sore thumb because it's the only thing that's not dimly lit. This is a very small and cute place. About 13 tables (mostly two seaters) and a very small bar. They had a simple menu, and attentive servers (despite it seeming like only two people took care of the whole floor). We started off ordering the fried pickles and the pretzels. My girlfriend hates both of those options but decided to let me indulge and get them anyway.  We were blown away by the pretzels. Very soft yet had a great outside texture with the perfect amount of sea salt paired with a delicious cheese sauce.  The fried pickles were... Okay..  Nothing special.  They were fully fried whole pickles... I tend to think pickle chips offer more bite size flavor. The entrees were great.  We got two burgers with bacon cheddar and mushrooms alongside hand cut fries. The fried were very flavorful and delicious.  The burgers were fantastic. Very juicy,  very craft like. We were so full before the entrees came but managed to force the burgers down because they were that good. The place is interesting.. Very small,  but seems to be very popular. Small menu but nails everything. The only downside is the cost of beverages. We got two diet cokes and they were the 8oz mini bottles for 2.50 each... Kinda off-putting. Still try this place out",4.0
"Was planning on eating at another restaurant in the area but they were closed so we decided to come here.  The restaurant is small but the wait wasn't too long on a saturday night.  We ordered chicken liver mousse and wild mushroom turnovers as appetizers and a lamb lasagna and ox burger for entree.  The wild mushroom  turnover was good but not much mushrooms.  Chicken liver mousse was just a little too salty but went well with the bread.  The lamb lasagna was pretty good and tasty.  It was bigger than what I expected.  After awhile, felt like it was a little too much meat in it.  The ox burger tasted juicy and flavorful.  The fries were better than average.  I tried their house ketchup and it good.  Had a slight BBQ taste to it.  Their menu is not too big but I'm looking forward to coming back to try their other stuff",4.0
"I read so many good reviews on yelp about Oxcart Tavern that I had to try it myself. The tavern is small, cozy, and the food smelled delicious from the door. I went on a Saturday and the wait time was about 35 minutes.  15 minutes longer than I was supposed to wait due to a mix up on the wait list but the hostess gave me free drinks to keep me happy. When I was finally seated, it was smooth sailing after that. The burgers was delicious and fresh, appetizers was hot and good, and the deserts was tasty. I definitely will be back and next time I'll bring my friends.",4.0
"When it's Monday and you don't want to eat the turnips and broccoli lying in your fridge (because you promised to eat healthy this week, remember?) the only thing to do is find a good place to order takeout on your way home.Tucked away in the Ditmas Park/Flatbush residential neighborhood, Oxcart is a quick walk from the Newkirk B/Q stop. It's a cute, cozy place with a relaxed atmosphere. There are booths and tables and a bar with two TVs playing various sporting events.The bartender was very welcoming and let me quickly order a Good Ol' Boy ($15) burger that comes with cheddar, bacon, and sautéed mushrooms. He told me about 20 minutes. I took a beautiful walk around the neighborhood and in exactly 20 minutes arrived back at the Tavern. The burger was ready and waiting.Service was great but the food is better. The burger smelled fantastic and tasted delicious. The fries were perfectly salted, potato-y yet crispy. My only complaint is that the price seems high for a burger and fries. Delicious nonetheless.",4.0
"It's a bit loud for conversation for us 90s people, who've been listening to our ""walkman"" for 20+ years now, but other than that, this place rocks in every other way.

"I found the Oxcart Tavern through Yelp while searching for restaurants near the new Kings Theater. It is only about a 10 minute walk from the restaurant to the theater.I stopped in about 30 minutes before the start of the Kentucky Derby so it was a little busy. It only took about 10-15 minutes to wait for a table. During that time we ordered some German beers. The bar tenders were very nice and helpful. To start, we had the fried pickles. You get a generous helping of pickles with a tangy dipping sauce. For my entrée I got the market fish burger which came with a side of pickled cauliflower and carrots. The fish was cooked well and was not dried out. My girlfriend ordered the California style burger which was stacked with sliced avocado, sprouts, and lettuce. To top it all off we indulged in the mixed berry pie which came a la mode style with a scoop of vanilla ice cream which was fabulous! Tip: the ketchup on the table in the red bottles isn't your regular ketchup. It might be something homemade? If you want to slather your burger in traditional Heinz you need to ask your server.",4.0

"It's a very cozy place with great food. You can skip the fried pickles, they were slightly below average but I think it had to do with the way they fried them. The veggie burger was great but a little dry. The chiles rellenos was delicious and i will probably get that instead of the veggie burger next time I'm there. I also love how you can see into the kitchen when you go to the bathroom, it's a quirky feature.",4.0

"This place was absolutely awful. Really disappointed as I wanted to like it being that I just moved less than a block away. I left offended, dissatisfied, and actually mad.I took two friends visiting from out of town here. Food was way over priced and portions were just okay - our appetizer was actually miniscule. Though it was tasty it wasn't anything I couldn't have made better myself at home. The biggest problem was the service. There were several men walking around doing a whole lot of nothing, though obviously being paid. I'm certain one was either the manager or owner, totally oblivious to how poorly the place was running. After finally coming over to us our waitress didn't even say hello and just looked at us like we were a nuisance and asked if we were ready. I ordered a bloody Mary, only after making sure their mix was homemade. I asked to have the bartender make it spicy. When it arrived it was in a tiny glass and not even full. It was also very watery and separated. I tasted  it and it was just awful,  it tasted like water and vile  tobasco sauce (which should never be served anywhere as far as I'm concerned). I usually don't send drinks back but this was just downright gross. When I did I heard the bartender and some other white man standing doing nothing start to complain about me sending the drink back and insinuating that I just didn't know what a bloody marry was. ..I could hear everything they were saying, the place is small. When they brought me my new drink it tasted exactly like the first one they brought me. The waitress was too busy having her ass groped by her boyfriend directly in front of us to check in with us even once after our food came. She sat less than 6 feet away from us counting her money while we waited and waited for the checks. Finally someone else brought them , he also messed them up and charged us wrong but by this point I just wanted to get the hell out of there. He said he hoped we enjoyed everything and I said I didn't and instead of asking what they could do to retain me as a customer he just nervously walked away. Honestly the whole experience was just pathetic . I was raised by a family of restaurateur's and have worked in many myself providing excellent service and I honestly don't see how that place is even staying business .  The only redeemable part of our experience was the bus boy who was polite , friendly,  and refilled our waters for us. Had I saw him before we left I would have slipped him the $30 tip that our waitress  (honestly not even sure who was supposed to be taking care of us) missed out on.",1.0
"We've dined at Ox Cart and placed orders for pick-up several times. The food was always excellent. However, yesterday, when we placed the order for pick-up the burger was completely burnt on the bottom. It looked like charcoal. It's quite unacceptable to serve something like that. When we called them, they told us to bring it in to exchange it. My boyfriend had to drive all the way back (we don't live particularly close) to exchange it. Most establishments would comp the item, but they didn't. However, they were really nice about it and had the replacement ready right away. By the time my boyfriend returned with his burger, my food was stone cold. I wasn't too pleased with that.I don't know if we will return. If we do, we will check the food before leaving. It was a pretty bad experience. The only reason I am giving them 3 stars is because of all the good experiences we had in the past. I've recommended them to several friends. Hopefully they won't let them down.",3.0

Honestly the whole experience was just pathetic . I was raised by a family of restaurateur's and have worked in many myself providing excellent service and I honestly don't see how that place is even staying business .  The only redeemable part of our experience was the bus boy who was polite , friendly,  and refilled our waters for us. Had I saw him before we left I would have slipped him the $30 tip that our waitress  (honestly not even sure who was supposed to be taking care of us) missed out on.",1.0
"We've dined at Ox Cart and placed orders for pick-up several times. The food was always excellent. However, yesterday, when we placed the order for pick-up the burger was completely burnt on the bottom. It looked like charcoal. It's quite unacceptable to serve something like that. When we called them, they told us to bring it in to exchange it. My boyfriend had to drive all the way back (we don't live particularly close) to exchange it. Most establishments would comp the item, but they didn't. However, they were really nice about it and had the replacement ready right away. By the time my boyfriend returned with his burger, my food was stone cold. I wasn't too pleased with that.I don't know if we will return. If we do, we will check the food before leaving. It was a pretty bad experience. The only reason I am giving them 3 stars is because of all the good experiences we had in the past. I've recommended them to several friends. Hopefully they won't let them down.",3.0

"The best surprise at Oxcart is the initial house salad.  It has just the right dash of everything that makes for a circus in your mouth.That Is just the beginning, the beers and wines are quality tasting.  All the meats fish and fowl are well prepared by a diverse culinary staff and last but not least try their fries chicken wings and homemade ketsup.",4.0
"Have to say I am pleasantly surprised by this gem hidden in Newkirk Avenue. Came here on New Years Eve (a Thursday night) a little after 6pm. It was empty when we arrived and within 30 minutes of arrival, it was full. They don't take reservations, and I can easily see why. They're a tiny, intimate restaurant/bar and the seating arrangements are typically tiny booths of two. The service is hit or miss and the wait time is a bit ridiculous (however, will not knock off points on this because as I mentioned before, everyone arrived at the same time. However, my boyfriend and I had the pretzel appetizer and the fried pickle appetizer. The pretzel was so amazingly delicious and soft. The fried pickle would definitely need some improvement. They fried the whole pickle and we weren't too fond of it. For the main entree, my boyfriend and I both had the burger. It was surprisingly delicious and juicy. We both thoroughly enjoyed our meal and definitely will be returning.",4.0

"Decor: Quaint and intimate....Wait Staff: Attentive. Our appetizers were forgotten and when brought to their attention they offered to still bring it out and clear it from the bill. Although an awesome gesture, we didn't feel like they needed to do that the soft baked pretzel with cheese is heavenly! We ate half and took the rest home. It's only right we pay for it! LolBurger: ALAMO (I added fresh guac too) GOOD OL BOYOX BURGER HEAVENLY!!! These burgers are huge, well made and juicy! The only thing I'd change is I do feel like their could be better buns. I usually go bunless with burgers but wanted the full experience. I felt like the bun was too soft and buttery. Kind of started falling apart with the awesomeness that was in the burger (guac, bbq sauce, onion ring, lettuce) Drinks: $11 Lemon Drop Cocktail (not shot) Was tart but drinkable. No buzz was achieved so for me so that was a tad bit disappointing. They are very very light on alcohol. They have great happy hour deals 5-6 and then 10-11. I came around 6:30pm. Place filled up about 7:30.I'd also recommend they build an outside encasement because with it being an 11 degree night every time the door opened we nearly froze to death! Those candles came in handy on the table and at one point we put our sweaters/outerwear back on. I'd say it's a perfect date night or semi-special occasion night. I took my son(8 y/o) and spouse here for pre-valentines dinner. They were happy and full! Can't beat that! Probably wouldn't recommend really small children tho. It's so dark inside and the noise level is low to moderate. They have 2 TVs & a bar in the back. Probably great to catch a game or 2. I'll surely be back. Really light reggae music began to be played around 8:10pm Overalls I'd recommend! Don't leave without trying the pretzels!P.s.

So far I've had the Alamo and Oaxaca burgers, and I've honestly lost the ability to think of a place that has a tastier patty. I can't. I won't.Well-priced drinks, the ability to buy growlers, and those ridiculous burgers would be more than enough, but then they go and add a great brunch menu, maybe just to show off?Anyway, if you don't mind waiting a little bit, this place will make up for that waiting at least 400 times over.",5.0
"I definitely love the place! I would never expect such a good spot in that area (no offense). The only flaw is the size of local. You have no privacy and it's pretty loud in there.

The regular menu is more for a burger fans, but with the daily specials everyone can find something for themselves. Hint: FYI! Carnitas Burrito is huge!!! ;-) enjoy!",5.0
"This is one of my favorite spots. I've been for brunch, lunch and dinner. Everything is cooked amazingly. The homemade ketchup is one of my favorites items because it's unique and tasty.

You will NOT be disappointed. Trust me.",5.0
"My friend and I ended up eating here on a whim one night and were very pleased with the food and the space. We didn't have a reservation and only ended up having to wait in the bar area for about 10 minutes before a table opened up.  We shared a $34 bottle of sauvingnon blanc which was very tasty to accompany our seafood meal of blackened catfish and crispy seat trout.

The turnovers weren't quite the temperature we were used to nor did they taste as phenomenal as they typically do. Not bad, just not to the standards we have become accustomed to. The burgers had issue with them. The veggie was too dry, no sauce. The fries were overdone. My bf asked for a well done fish burger, it was barely coasting to medium. The bread was also a tad stale. However what really got to is was the lousy service. No napkins, no one to clean the tables, no water refills, nobody to check up on us.",3.0

"Cute little restaurant, not so little burger! I got the Alamo Burger, which when assembled, is way too tall to actually bite. Once you manage your way around it in a few bites it is soooooo good. The burger is deliciously seasoned and covered with melty cheese. The onion has a tempura-like batter. The sauce is yummy. I would say the egg however, isn't doing it any favors. I love a good egg on a burger, but this one really didn't need it and it ended up being just one layer too many for me. The fries are awesome and if you get a little side of mayo and mix it with the bbq sauce they bring out - instant aioli! Fancy!",4.0
"To start this off, my last three times coming here have been stellar. The food was great and the service was fantastic. However, all three times I was sitting at the bar. The bartender, the bald guy with the chin beard, is the man. Always incredibly friendly, helpful, and he's always got a handful of good recommendations. The thing that really killed me was when I got table service with a few friends the other night. From the start the waitress seemed pretty cold and uninterested. She took our drink orders, and after asking her about the happy hour, still asked what kind of liquor I wanted in my cocktail as if it weren't obvious I wanted the well. Anyway, we had mussels to start, which are typically delicious and stacked pretty high. This batch was skimpy and about a third of the shells were totally empty. Bust. The rest of the food was to their usual standard, however, the entire time our waitress kept dodging us when we wanted to order more drinks. It happened so often that we ended up ordering drinks with the bus boy, who came around plenty to refill water. We even ordered our food with a separate waitress because ours was nowhere to be found. When she did show up she had no idea we already ordered. As the meal was wrapping up, which I might add was a good hour before their posted bar closing, we wanted a last happy hour round. We flagged down our actual waitress, who asked if we needed the check. We asked for another round and desert menus, to which she said they were closed. That seemed rather abrupt so we just opted for the check. That's when the table behind us asked her for another round. She said the same thing as us, but when they called her out on the posted closing, she got them their drinks! It's one thing if you're trying to wrap it up at the end of the night, but we felt like we were getting pushed out. At one point they even turned some of the lights out.All in all, the food is great, the bar is great, and the bartender is the man, but all other service here sucks. Sit at the bar or take it to go, unless you like being ignored and shoved out.",3.0
"Found this place thanks to a recommendation from a friend who lives in Brooklyn. Nestled away in a quiet neighborhood. We were able to get a table fairly quickly. You should call ahead to get your name on the wait list. But beware that getting through to them on the phone is very difficult, at best.Anyway, it's a small place, but cozy and a nice atmosphere. Had the fried pickles, which I've never had before. LOVED them. We both had the Cali Patty, with sprouts, tom, Am cheese, etc. REALLY good burger. Although the buns are too small, which makes for a messy meal. We saw some other burgers that were even bigger. Fries were awesome. Service was so-so. The waiter was nice, but we had to wait almost 15 minutes for cappuccinos. The waiter was kind enough to comp them (we didn't ask!). So, service is the one thing they need to work on.

"This place is getting worst by the minute. I called, at 5:45pm to places an Oder for delivery and I was told that he can take the Oder. He has to wait until 6pm. Really???? Then I called back and wast told, we're not doing delivery today. The owner open a new restaurant on Cortelyou, he should focus on this one. Bad service. Horrible.",1.0
"My group ordered most of the appetizers.. The fried pickles were a hit, as well as the baby lettuce salad. I went with a 'good ole boy' burger, and was very pleased.. Good size, great taste, and highly recommended.. Pretty good beer selection as well.",4.0
"Really good food. I suggest the warm brussel sprout and bacon appetizer. OMG. The combo is amazeballs. Everybody seemed to like their burgers. The chicken pot pie was said to be a bit too watery. This place is very small. Not the best place for large groups. Double happy hour is nice. $4 wells, $4wines, $2 off drafts. The downside: They only allow cash OR card for large groups, but not both.

"This place is a little known spot in the heart of Brooklyn with amazing food. Breakfast is tasty,  get the German pancake you will love it.

"Oxcart tavern has managed to survive in the area even when it was much more desolate than it is now for a reason.  Because the menu is solid and consistent.  The double happy hour is great and their burger menu is really nice.   It's thoughtful to have the option of regular, turkey or veggie burger first of all.  Secondly they make a mean pretzel.  Something I would never order but had seen at other tables so many times I eventually tried it and was glad I did.   They also have a good selection of wine and beer.   Their homemade ketchup is super tasty, lamb lasagna also, and they often have a round of specials that includes something really delicious. Most of the staff are friendly and professional.  A great option for a neighborhood bar you can walk to.  And I hear they now will sell you draft beer to go.  What more can you ask for!",3.0
"This place was nice and quaint. The service was good and the food was okay. The fried pickles were really good. The mussels were good but they were quite small. The catfish was a little too much tomato sauce. The grits on the bottom I wasn't a fan but my bf loved it. The lamb lasagna was good, a little more gamey than expected. I would definitely come back but order other food.",3.0

"Ok have been meaning to try brunch spots around my place. So I figure I'll come here because of the reviews. Place is a little tight or cramped I should say. I have an infant so at first didn't seem ideal. Owner managed to make room for us. It took the waitress's bit of time to ask for are order and the non alcoholic drinks came in small drink cups. The wings were terrific. The shrimp in grits weren't good. The biscuit was dry and lacked flavor. Just didn't taste authentic. For the price you pay for the food, I expected better.

Love the atmosphere. Awesome (and huge) burgers - and the prices look high but is totally worth it for the amount of food you get. Great wait staff.Only thing that's keeping me from 5 stars is that we waited around for about 45 minutes and weren't allowed to sit at a booth for four people since it was just two of us. And the only reason we had to wait 45-60m in the first place was because a table of three people felt so inclined to sit around for that full hour over coffee while there was a long wait. Jerks.

"The place is small but perfect for a small dinner with friends or a date. The staff was friendly but the service was just okay.

Friends ordered:Fish and chips, came with french fries and pickled veggies which were good. The tartar sauce was on point!!Pork Chop was one of the best I've tried! It was cooked to perfection and full of flavourI ordered the Oxless burger (not sure why but I was in the mood for a veggie burger).... it was OK, but the patty was a little dry! It definitely was missing something. For dessert we got 3 scoops of gelato and a special bread pudding I believe...

"With so many positive reviews on Yelp, my husband and I came to Oxcart to celebrate our anniversary.Without reservations I can say that he and I experienced a complete gastronomic failure.Our server was pleasant and greeted us warmly.  In charge of the whole restaurant floor, she was unable to spend more than a few seconds with us before attending the other patrons.We ordered the fries pickles, onion rings, a burger, and the catfish.  The food arrived in that order, sometimes from our waitress, but most of the time from a frowning expediter who deposited the plates scowling and leaving without saying a word.The pickles were a nice novelty.  Texas state fair, fare.The onion rings.  Undercooked doughy onion beignets.  The chili powder and grossly sweet ketchup (tomato and curry/BBQ jam?) made what should have been a savory bite into a cloyingly sweet dough-nut.  With onions.The hamburger.  The meat was aptly seasoned.  The bun and cheese were cracker crisp.The catfish.  3 ounces of frozen and defrosted fish, covered with 5 ounces of oil and cornmeal.  The rice, vegetables, and room temperature hush puppies all tasted the same; liberally dosed with the same chili spice mixture from the onion dough-nuts.Once the food was deposited by the expediter, we scraped the hardened cheese and bun from the hamburger, split the patty, and waited to send the food back.  30 minutes later we were visited and asked if we wanted our food wrapped up to go.  The plates we still full of food and we voiced our extreme displeasure with the lions share of the meal.  I pointed out that the fish was practically powder, being completely dehydrated old, and off.Our server came back and said that after consulting the kitchen or manager that they also agreed the food was not edible.We were then offered the check.This was the worst part of the evening.  Not a manager in sight or an apology was made.  No offer to have the food replaced was initiated.The admission from the restaurant that we had been served spoiled food was odd.  Without the followup of making arrears for the mistake, we felt marginalized and dismissed.Was this an off night for Oxcart Tavern?It certainly was for us.",1.0
"Cozy and very laid back kinda place. They have great music and I liked the window seating. Our server Rachel was very friendly and attentive. I had the Scallops w/ Grits & Eggs. That came with caramelized pears and a sweet biscuit. My son had the Alamo burger which was piled high with an onion ring and an egg over easy accompanied with fries. My food was delicious. My sons was ""Fantastic"" his words. He absolutely loved his meal and could not stop raving about it. This place is great. I didnt give 5 stars because my water glass had a dry old lipstick print on it, different from my lipstick color. Gross. So I just drank my sons water. I would absolutely come back!",4.0

"This was of my biggest surprices.  I usually a good sense of the quality of the place by reading the reviews, this place had great one and is on my neigborhood.  I was not impressed at all, we tried two differents burger, liver moose, fried pickles, soft pretzel.  everything was just ok, nothing to brag about.  The only thing i would go back for is the fried pickles  everything else is just ok.  i was hoping this place was good because is in my area but i guess is not.  They open for happy hour at 5 and for dinner at 6 we got there at 530 and decided to wait by 555 the place was completely full.  In the menu they have limited coctails.  The place is very family friendly must customers had small childrem with them wich i really liked.  I probably be back for those fried pickels.",3.0
"I went here the other day with my cousin and his two children. We heard great things about this place and had once tried to come in before for dinner, but were asked to wait upwards of 30 minutes for a seat. The restaurant is extremely cramped. The food may be really good, but the surrounding environment downgrades the entire experience. For lack of a better word, it felt extremely icky over there -- and only because of how small the place was.  We ordered the Baby Organic Salad as an appetizer and we clearly stated that we wanted it before our burgers came, but the servers failed to follow our requests and brought it later. For the kids, we got sliders and for us, we got a Good Ol' Boy and an Alamo Burger. They were beyond delicious, probably on my Top 5 Burger List, but again, I didn't feel at all comfortable while eating it. The wait staff was very unpleasant. They didn't shed a single smile during our time there. They failed to follow instructions to bring our salad early. And since there was no space in the restaurant for them to be, they were forced to just standby near the bar and glare at the customers while they ate.

"With so many positive reviews on Yelp, my husband and I came to Oxcart to celebrate our anniversary.Without reservations I can say that he and I experienced a complete gastronomic failure.Our server was pleasant and greeted us warmly.  In charge of the whole restaurant floor, she was unable to spend more than a few seconds with us before attending the other patrons.We ordered the fries pickles, onion rings, a burger, and the catfish.  The food arrived in that order, sometimes from our waitress, but most of the time from a frowning expediter who deposited the plates scowling and leaving without saying a word.The pickles were a nice novelty.  Texas state fair, fare.The onion rings.  Undercooked doughy onion beignets.  The chili powder and grossly sweet ketchup (tomato and curry/BBQ jam?) made what should have been a savory bite into a cloyingly sweet dough-nut.  With onions.The hamburger.  The meat was aptly seasoned.  The bun and cheese were cracker crisp.The catfish.  3 ounces of frozen and defrosted fish, covered with 5 ounces of oil and cornmeal.  The rice, vegetables, and room temperature hush puppies all tasted the same; liberally dosed with the same chili spice mixture from the onion dough-nuts.Once the food was deposited by the expediter, we scraped the hardened cheese and bun from the hamburger, split the patty, and waited to send the food back.  30 minutes later we were visited and asked if we wanted our food wrapped up to go.  The plates we still full of food and we voiced our extreme displeasure with the lions share of the meal.  I pointed out that the fish was practically powder, being completely dehydrated old, and off.Our server came back and said that after consulting the kitchen or manager that they also agreed the food was not edible.We were then offered the check.This was the worst part of the evening.  Not a manager in sight or an apology was made.  No offer to have the food replaced was initiated.The admission from the restaurant that we had been served spoiled food was odd.  Without the followup of making arrears for the mistake, we felt marginalized and dismissed.Was this an off night for Oxcart Tavern?It certainly was for us.",1.0
"Cozy and very laid back kinda place. They have great music and I liked the window seating. Our server Rachel was very friendly and attentive. I had the Scallops w/ Grits & Eggs. That came with caramelized pears and a sweet biscuit. My son had the Alamo burger which was piled high with an onion ring and an egg over easy accompanied with fries. My food was delicious. My sons was ""Fantastic"" his words. He absolutely loved his meal and could not stop raving about it. This place is great. I didnt give 5 stars because my water glass had a dry old lipstick print on it, different from my lipstick color. Gross. So I just drank my sons water. I would absolutely come back!",4.0

"This was of my biggest surprices.  I usually a good sense of the quality of the place by reading the reviews, this place had great one and is on my neigborhood.  I was not impressed at all, we tried two differents burger, liver moose, fried pickles, soft pretzel.  everything was just ok, nothing to brag about.  The only thing i would go back for is the fried pickles  everything else is just ok.  i was hoping this place was good because is in my area but i guess is not.  They open for happy hour at 5 and for dinner at 6 we got there at 530 and decided to wait by 555 the place was completely full.  In the menu they have limited coctails.  The place is very family friendly must customers had small childrem with them wich i really liked.  I probably be back for those fried pickels.",3.0
"I went here the other day with my cousin and his two children. We heard great things about this place and had once tried to come in before for dinner, but were asked to wait upwards of 30 minutes for a seat. The restaurant is extremely cramped. The food may be really good, but the surrounding environment downgrades the entire experience. For lack of a better word, it felt extremely icky over there -- and only because of how small the place was.  We ordered the Baby Organic Salad as an appetizer and we clearly stated that we wanted it before our burgers came, but the servers failed to follow our requests and brought it later. For the kids, we got sliders and for us, we got a Good Ol' Boy and an Alamo Burger. They were beyond delicious, probably on my Top 5 Burger List, but again, I didn't feel at all comfortable while eating it. The wait staff was very unpleasant. They didn't shed a single smile during our time there. They failed to follow instructions to bring our salad early. And since there was no space in the restaurant for them to be, they were forced to just standby near the bar and glare at the customers while they ate. Oh, and the second we finished eating, they rushed over your check to try to get us out of the restaurant as soon as possible. Overall, great burgers. Uncomfortable environment, unpleasant staff.

"New place to add to the list of restaurants I can walk to from my placeIt was packed on a Friday night.  We had to wait outside for about 15mn.  I noticed a couple of tables were being used by people with their laptops.  Like someone else mentioned, they haven't figured out what they want to be (cafe, bar or real restaurant)The soft baked pretzels were excellent, ate them without the mustard. The 2 burgers we ordered were juicy and came in large portions. I wish my Cali-patty had more portions of avocado in it but overall it was good. A couple of faux pas with the service, but they redeemed themselves. We sat down in a large table and later we were asked (kindly) by the waitress to move to a 2 seater table...just so they could fill a table of 4 waiting in line.  I wasn't too bothered by it but I'll say one thing, it's just very blatant that their primary focus is to fill as many seats as possible.

The Chicken was perfectly cooked and the bread they used was really good (and im not a bread fan at all). I wish I swapped out my potato salad for french fries, I wasn't thrilled with the taste of the potato salad. There was way too much dill to it which gave it a bit of a bitter taste.

"really wanted brunch and was going to go to the farm on adderley but the trains weren't stopping there. thankfully found this gem on yelp. it definitely stands out in the neighborhood. the crowd is younger than those with families that go to the farm. definitely the young hipster group. the food. is. great. and very saitsifying for brunch. we had the onion rings, oxcart skillet (ham, potatoes, onions, zucchini, topped with 2 over easy eggs), corn beef hash (with 2 poached eggs, and a salad), a bloody mary, and an iced americano. the skillet and corn beef hash was DELICIOUS. the onion rings were really good too but a little too much for us, will prol try their biscuit or mushroom turnover next time. the iced americano was alright and their bloody mary was okay. wasn't heavy or sour enough. service was a little slow, but the food was worth the wait. the iced americano actually took a while to make and then they forgot it so they didn't charge us for the drinks. they have a pretty legit wine and beer menu. i dont know too much about bourbon, but they apparently have a good selection of that too. will be back for dinner for sure to try their pork confit enchiladas and fried pickles :3",4.0

"I want this place to do well, but they need to step up their game a bit. The chicken fried chicken was really bland and sub-par. One of my friends had the trout special, which she said did not mix well with sweet potatoes. The ambiance is great and service  is good, but food needs more help.",2.0
"Loved this place when it was Pomme de Terre, and still love it as Ox Cart.Less precious than The Farm, with a consistently good product. Staff can be on or off, but never too bad. Well worth a visit",4.0

"I really, really enjoy this place. The food is very good, as is the service. If I may suggest...Check the specials. They are often, special! All the burgers are excellent. You can't go wrong there. The fried pickles and onion rings are also worth a try.",5.0
"really wanted brunch and was going to go to the farm on adderley but the trains weren't stopping there. thankfully found this gem on yelp. it definitely stands out in the neighborhood. the crowd is younger than those with families that go to the farm. definitely the young hipster group. the food. is. great. and very saitsifying for brunch. we had the onion rings, oxcart skillet (ham, potatoes, onions, zucchini, topped with 2 over easy eggs), corn beef hash (with 2 poached eggs, and a salad), a bloody mary, and an iced americano. the skillet and corn beef hash was DELICIOUS. the onion rings were really good too but a little too much for us, will prol try their biscuit or mushroom turnover next time. the iced americano was alright and their bloody mary was okay. wasn't heavy or sour enough. service was a little slow, but the food was worth the wait. the iced americano actually took a while to make and then they forgot it so they didn't charge us for the drinks. they have a pretty legit wine and beer menu. i dont know too much about bourbon, but they apparently have a good selection of that too. will be back for dinner for sure to try their pork confit enchiladas and fried pickles :3",4.0
"This is our favorite spot to eat in our neighborhood in Ditmas Park!  The food is always excellent.  They have great specials every week which goes along with the time of year or season.  Whenever we go there, we feel like we're always treated like an extended family and treated with such care.  It's the place we go to celebrate, really anything.  It's also a great spot just to get a drink and relax.  It's super cute and cozy and I promise you'll want to return!  And make sure you keep room for the pie, oh the pie; it's delicious.",5.0
We walk a mile to get here past all that Cortelyou has to offer. Why?It's unpretentious and laid back. The food is perfect for the price. I never leave wondering where all my money went. It's consistent. Best fried pickles my Arkansan (home of the fried pickle) girl has ever had.If you expect your server to be at your table every 2 minutes then go to The Farm on Cortelyou.....please.,5.0

"I love this place. Every single time I've gone, I've not had a bad experience, and I've ordered take out as well, and it was great. This weekend I finally got to try the brunch menu. Started of with a bloody mary, which was near perfectly mixed. The potato salad was among the best, if not THE best I've ever had in my life, and the biscuit was by far the best I've ever had. I have never tried chicken fried chicken, because the name has always grossed me out, but I decided to be adventurous and give it a shot. It was juicy chicken covered with a good amount of chicken fried (though what do I know, never had it before), and wasn't too heavy. Scrambled eggs were delicious, and the fried apples tasted like the best apple dessert I've ever had. I'm so glad this place is within walking distance from me.

"Worst. Hospitality. Service. Ever.*** In response to John R. ***Only someone who has something ridiculously absurd to say would create a Yelp account to try and defend the honor of an experience they did not have. How would you know I got an extra ranch for free? It was not told to me and wasn't spoken of, how could you have witnessed this unless the waitress I'm speaking of told you or announced this after I left? seems a bit sketchy to me. Either way, I think your attempt to belittle MY experience speaks loud enough on its own. I never claimed to be friends with the owner, I stated I knew him and have spoken with him several times, being as it is a small restaurant. Please keep your comments to yourself. :)As I'm writing this review I'm standing in Ox Cart waiting to pick up my order that I called in for takeout, watching the waitress (Dulce/Dulcy was the name she gave me) that just tried to ""teach me a lesson"" speak to her fellow employee behind the bar and the cooks in the back about how how ""rude"" I am. Let's make one thing clear - I've been coming to Ox Cart for over two years and I used to LOVE the place but recently due to extremely poor customer service I have cut back.Tonight was my last night ever ordering or stepping foot inside. I ordered their fried pickles and a side of fries. The fried pickles come with a side of ranch sauce and every time I have ordered it they always give you very little, so I requested two sides of the ranch. When I came in, I was handed the bill and I saw I was being charged $1 extra for the ranch. Now, I understand some places charge you for extra sauce, in this case I know that the Chef (David) makes everything from scratch, but if you're going to make everything from scratch and not have an option for something you did not make from scratch (such as ranch, mustard, etc) then you can't charge people $1 extra when the sauce comes with the food item and it's being shared! That's ridiculous.(This has also happened before at brunch when I ordered their pancake which does not come with maple syrup, when I asked for it I was charged a $1 extra, but at least I was made aware of it before hand considering it does NOT come with the pancake.)So when I looked at the bill, I asked the waitress why I was being charged for ranch when it comes with the fried pickles. She looked at me and said ""you asked for extra."" So I simply stated ""just take it off the bill then, I'm not paying extra for something that comes with the meal."" Immediately after I said that, she got defensive and loudly for everyone to hear stated ""You don't need to be rude to me, I'm doing my job, if you want to talk to a manager you can speak to them, they're here now."" ... why would I need to speak with a manager? why couldn't this waitress just take it off my bill, I wasn't asking to get her fired because I thought she was trying to pull one over on me.. I didn't want to pay $1 extra, that's it. Clearly this woman has no hospitality training because in the restaurant/bar industry (which I have been in for over 8 years) the last thing you want to resort to is getting management involved, unless there is really something you cannot handle.Anyway, I laughed it off because when I told her if I needed to speak to someone I would speak directly with David who is the chef and owner, she walked away frustrated and grabbed the money out of my hand. I told her to keep the 10¢ change, but instead she threw two nickels in my takeout bag instead of handing it back to me - pretty pathetic.Needless to say, I will not be back. Ever. Ox Cart needs to educate their servers on hospitality and proper etiquette and chill out on the up charges for sauce on the side. Too bad management doesn't read their yelp reviews because if they did, customer service would be different. I'm one of many many people who have reviewed that have commented on how poor it is.",1.0

"So this is what's replaced my beloved Pomme De Terre ?Gone is the cozy french restaurant and in it's place a a livelier gastropub. While I loved , and honestly preferred, Pomme De Terre this place is quite good [1]They extended the bar, put in some TVs, and rearranged tables. While they can probably seat more it doesn't feel cramped.What hasn't changed is the service. I still find servers to be friendly and professional. Since it's a small staff you may wait a bit if it's busy but nothing ridiculous.They beer selection includes Magic Hat, Bass, & Spaten and ranges from $5-6.00. Wines run from $7-10.00 a glass. The $8.50 Shiraz was very good.In terms of food the emphasis seems to be on small bites as opposed to entrees. The small bites are mostly great. The crab cake slider, oyster rockefeller and homemade pretzel with dijon and cheese sauce are my favorites. The warm pretzel is really fantastic and runs out, get there early. The onion rings weren't as impressive but the chili-lime butter it's served is good. Without it onion rings are bland.As far as entrees I liked the burger. The good ol' boy ($13) with cheddar, bacon and mushroom is juicy and decadent but is it as good as Farm Burger at nearby Farm on Adderley ? Not to me. The pan roasted chicken ($16) is wonderful. Strangely enough the pan roast chicken was one of my faves at Pomme and it is one of my favorites here too. It's prepared differently but still excellent. Served over potatoes and vegetables with strong lime seasoning, this is a winner. What's missing ?-- Menu doesn't seem vegetarian friendly.-- A reason for people outside the area to travel here. While it's good it doesn't standout they way i felt Pomme did. I think the goal was  to remake it for younger local residents and to that end it seems successful.While i preferred Pomme De Terre, I'll be a regular here because of quality and proximity.----------------------------------------------------1-How can I not love it when on 3 visits I walk in to hear :Radiohead ""The Bends"" , Foo Fighters "" Times Like These"" and Bob Marley's greatest hits. 2 They now have liquor license and full bar.** Disclosure -- there website is using my photos.

"Solid, solid place to have some grub to kick back a couple of beers. I've been here on two occasions once for lunch and for dinner. Lunch most recently I had one of their burgers and paired it with a Stella cider. The burger was cooked to perfection (medium) and I really liked their homemade ketchup it was very sweet. My date had the fried chicken dish. I'd consider myself a fairly adventurous eater as long as the food isn't spicy. One night at dinner we had the fried calamari with was reasonably breaded. I really enjoyed the ox tail  which was served with bread. I'm having a complete mind blank on the 3rd dish we shared but this will be edited. My only negative is I found the staff to be pushy, already asking what I ordered before I even had a minute to look at the menu. Slow down..just a little.",4.0
"Great service and food. Decided to check this place out over the weekend and definitely enjoyed my experience. I got a cali-burger and my boyfriend got a salmon burger. yum. they allowed us to try samples of the beer on draft, which I appreciated.

I left my take home box and she literally ran after us to hand me my leftovers. very nice! must try!",5.0
"I love this place!! I'm always in the neighborhood because I grew up there and always hang out around there. I order it almost every time that I'm around. It is especially a go to spot on Sundays during football. The food is great, isn't too expensive and they have a great variety to choose from. My personal favorites are the burgers. They are unreal and they make some crazy combinations with the toppings that are soooo good. My absolute favorite is the Alamo burger which has a fried egg on it. Their homemade pretzels are insane and need to be ordered as a side dish. On a little different note their lasagna is damn good and they also make some really good wings. I have tried a lot of their other stuff and all was good. You can't go wrong when you eat at this place.",5.0

"So this is what's replaced my beloved Pomme De Terre ?Gone is the cozy french restaurant and in it's place a a livelier gastropub. While I loved , and honestly preferred, Pomme De Terre this place is quite good [1]They extended the bar, put in some TVs, and rearranged tables. While they can probably seat more it doesn't feel cramped.What hasn't changed is the service. I still find servers to be friendly and professional. Since it's a small staff you may wait a bit if it's busy but nothing ridiculous.They beer selection includes Magic Hat, Bass, & Spaten and ranges from $5-6.00. Wines run from $7-10.00 a glass. The $8.50 Shiraz was very good.In terms of food the emphasis seems to be on small bites as opposed to entrees. The small bites are mostly great. The crab cake slider, oyster rockefeller and homemade pretzel with dijon and cheese sauce are my favorites. The warm pretzel is really fantastic and runs out, get there early. The onion rings weren't as impressive but the chili-lime butter it's served is good. Without it onion rings are bland.As far as entrees I liked the burger. The good ol' boy ($13) with cheddar, bacon and mushroom is juicy and decadent but is it as good as Farm Burger at nearby Farm on Adderley ? Not to me. The pan roasted chicken ($16) is wonderful. Strangely enough the pan roast chicken was one of my faves at Pomme and it is one of my favorites here too. It's prepared differently but still excellent. Served over potatoes and vegetables with strong lime seasoning, this is a winner. What's missing ?-- Menu doesn't seem vegetarian friendly.-- A reason for people outside the area to travel here. While it's good it doesn't standout they way i felt Pomme did. I think the goal was  to remake it for younger local residents and to that end it seems successful.While i preferred Pomme De Terre, I'll be a regular here because of quality and proximity.----------------------------------------------------1-How can I not love it when on 3 visits I walk in to hear :Radiohead ""The Bends"" , Foo Fighters "" Times Like These"" and Bob Marley's greatest hits. 2 They now have liquor license and full bar.** Disclosure -- there website is using my photos. It didn't affect my rating but figured it be fair to let you know.**",4.0
"Great place! I use to live around this traven, would go often. I travel down to Brooklyn just to go back. The service is family friendly. Great for burgers and beers, or breakfast brunch!",4.0
This is one of my favorite places to eat.  I love all the burgers with fries and their special ketchup.  I can't eat it without a liter of beer.  The service kinda stinks though and there are never enough napkins and they don't check in enough on you to make sure everything is fine.  Around dinner time the wait for a table can be awhile but it's all so worth it.  Also check out their clams!  The wine sauce is amazing!,4.0
"Solid, solid place to have some grub to kick back a couple of beers. I've been here on two occasions once for lunch and for dinner. Lunch most recently I had one of their burgers and paired it with a Stella cider. The burger was cooked to perfection (medium) and I really liked their homemade ketchup it was very sweet. My date had the fried chicken dish. I'd consider myself a fairly adventurous eater as long as the food isn't spicy. One night at dinner we had the fried calamari with was reasonably breaded. I really enjoyed the ox tail  which was served with bread. I'm having a complete mind blank on the 3rd dish we shared but this will be edited. My only negative is I found the staff to be pushy, already asking what I ordered before I even had a minute to look at the menu. Slow down..just a little.",4.0
"Great service and food. Decided to check this place out over the weekend and definitely enjoyed my experience. I got a cali-burger and my boyfriend got a salmon burger. yum. they allowed us to try samples of the beer on draft, which I appreciated. They make a homemade ketchup that my boyfriend raved over, it was sweeter than I prefer, but still good. Our waitress was awesome and why i'm giving this place 5 stars. I left my take home box and she literally ran after us to hand me my leftovers. very nice! must try!",5.0
"I love this place!! I'm always in the neighborhood because I grew up there and always hang out around there. I order it almost every time that I'm around. It is especially a go to spot on Sundays during football. The food is great, isn't too expensive and they have a great variety to choose from. My personal favorites are the burgers. They are unreal and they make some crazy combinations with the toppings that are soooo good. My absolute favorite is the Alamo burger which has a fried egg on it. Their homemade pretzels are insane and need to be ordered as a side dish. On a little different note their lasagna is damn good and they also make some really good wings. I have tried a lot of their other stuff and all was good. You can't go wrong when you eat at this place.",5.0

"I never write enough good reviews, so I feel compelled to write about the place I go most often. But, well, um... it's getting hard to get a table. Probably because everything about this place is terrible and awful. Probably that or something. That must be it.  Never, ever go here because it's not at all delicious or cozy, and the servers are most definitely not super-nice and accommodating to your questions and special requests. And they never have different app/entree/dessert specials every night that are never always really really good. Avoid at all costs!",4.0
"Have lived in the neighborhood since the fall and have been to Oxcart Tavern a few times. Went there last Saturday for brunch. If you're looking for solid gastro pub type food this is place. Not to mention there's not much else around Newkirk Ave. -_- Friends got burgers and I got brunch (biscuits and gravy, eggs on the side). The Burgers are much more exciting. Also looking around at neighboring tables reaffirmed that I made the wrong (though cheaper) choice of ordering a la carte.I really like the vibe of this place. Bordering on the line of too hip for me but just right haha.... I like the ""ol timey"" photos and the wine lists in lipstick on the mirror. Service has always been friendly and competent. I like it.A little cramped. Peak times will be crowded.",4.0

"Not like they need another review but it's quite good for brunch. Homey vibe. I'm vegetarian and was pleased with the number of options.  Decent size servings, laidback service.Two things, though. first, the skillet I had they offered a tofu substitute for meat and that's exactly what they did - fot the meat they substituted completely unflavored, unbaked, raw silken tofu. Now you know the meat they use has a flavor and a texture, so why substitute a totally bland flavorless cube of mush for it, into an otherwaise  very tasty skillet?second (rather minor I know) -- they inexplicably put sugar on their buttermilk biscuits - like, the tops of them are crusted with baked-on sugar. This is deeply weird to me. A BISCUIT IS NOT A DESSERT. still I will likely be back.",4.0

The food is pretty good and the place is nice. As it is really one of the only good places around newkirk plaza I can't complain. It's a great place to go grab a burger plus for those of us in Midwood Park it's close by. I love the La Vaca and soft pretzels. Not a fan of the onion rings.,5.0
"Where the hell has this place BEEN? As someone who is regularly in London, and is often bitching about the fact that NYC doesn't have anything like the cozy gastropubs they have in the UK, stumbling upon Oxcart was a revelation. The only reason we found it was that we had a two hour wait ahead of us for a Di Fara pizza, and decided to get some appetizers and a drink while we waited.When we looked at the menu, we all wanted everything, and of what we got, we loved every bite. It was nice and quiet in there with the windows open and a fresh breeze coming in, good music and a relaxing vibe.People who live around here must love this place, and they probably don't want douche-bags like me reviewing it on yelp and ruining it. But like...manifest destiny or something.",5.0

"X marks the spot with this place. I have been looking for a great chill/food spot in my neighborhood....because you know..there are times when you don't want to go far from home and I finally found one! The oxcart is a great cozy place that one can enjoy with friends. The food was Phenominal, I had mussels as an appetizer which came with warm toasted bread and for an entree I had the lamb lasagna.  You can tell everything was made from scratch, the ingredients were fresh and complimented each other well! I was in heaven after that meal! The prices are moderate. It goes go hand in hand with the amount of food your getting. I was stuffed and had enough to make a doggie bag, so you don't feel as if your being cheated. The cocktails are also impressive.

"i love going to this neighborhood joint for brunch/lunch. Everything on the menu is fantastic. A must try item is the german pancakes. I also love their salad and tuna burger. This place is my comfort food for a lazy weekend just to relax and hang with some close friends. The only gripe I have is that the staff doesnt really clean off the chairs and table very well. Beware of the silverware, dishes and cups. They dont clean it very well either. So always check the items and ask the staff to change it if it doesnt look clean. I think the problem with cleanliness is that they have a really small kitchen so cleaning is an after thought and they are always under staffed. I guess that's what you get for a small local joint. But honestly, if they dont beef up their quality of staff, Im sure if a competitor comes into the area, Oxcart will start experiencing some cash flow issues.",4.0

"I first came to this place about 8 or 9 months ago with a friend who is a vegetarian, and who was reluctant to go because according to him taverns don't usually have good food for vegetarians. After having one of their ""ox-less"" burgers he said that it was easily the best vegetarian burger he'd had in his entire life. I am not a vegetarian, but after having their ""good ol' boy"" burger I declared it was probably the best bacon cheeseburger I've had in New York (not to say that it is definitively the best, since sadly I have yet to try every bacon cheeseburger in NYC, but it is certainly the best I've had so far). Since then I've been back at least once or twice a month, and the food has never disappointed, the specials are always great, and the deserts typically amazing. They've got great premium beers too, which is always a big plus on my list. I really only have two gripes about this place.. one is that it is small, with limited seating. Not outrageously so, this being New York, I've certainly been in smaller, more cramped restaurants, but do expect that if it is busy there's a good chance you may have to wait for a table. The bigger problem I have with the place, and the reason I only gave it four stars instead of five, is that somehow it seems to draw the most pretentious a-hole people (see reviewer JUSTIN L below). I'm not sure why, maybe because there are an abundance of people in this neighborhood with enough money to feel way too self-important, but not enough money to live in Brooklyn Heights or Manhattan, so they take their spite at having to live in flatbush out on everyone else in the area by expecting them to bow down servilely and throw roses at them as they pass like the kings and queens they feel like they are (again, see JUSTIN L's review below, basically perfect example of what I mean.. ""transient hipster f*&s""? way to live up to your stereotype, pompous egotistical f*&).  But really that's a problem with the neighborhood in general, and not at all the fault of this establishment.Overall, way above average food, great beers, but you may have to wait for a table, and when you do get one expect to have to put up with the conversation of some vainglorious d-bag with an over inflated ego next you.",4.0

No line, but all the seats were taken, and the line started to form afterwards, so I advise you to get there early for dinner.

I ordered mine without BBQ sauce but with avocado... my friend ordered the Alamo with lettuce and tomatoes. They messed up both our orders. A little annoying, but the burger was delicious. Cooked perfectly and again... lots of flavor. Their home made ketchup is tangy. Sort of like BBQ sauce. Most people like it. Their ranch is nice. Subtle and buttermilk-flavored. It took me awhile to get my ranch, so again... service was not the best. For dessert, my friend got the Gelato Sundae, which looked pretty good. LOTS of chocolate. I ordered a Sour Strawberry to-go. However, when I got home, I'm pretty sure I had the Mixed Berry pie. *sigh* If their food wasn't so good, their service would bring them down, but I'm more about the food than I am about the service, as long as they're not rude.

The servers at Oxcart weren't rude, but they were a bit incompetent. *shrug* I'll still go back. Their food was that good.",4.0
"I live nearby so I inevitably end up here a lot, but I haven't been that impressed.Their beer selection is lacking and is overprices--the glasses are tiny!  The food is good but not worth the price.  Service is spotty.  It's impossible to get a table at dinner and since the bar area is so tiny you end up awkwardly squished in a corner somewhere.  Brunch is mobbed with strollers and crying babies.  And they close really early (12am!).On a positive note, they have 2 happy hours (one late night) which is great, and the french fries and bloody marys are awesome.  Soft pretzel is good too.  In general the brunch is good but I'd go a bit later or maybe on a sunday to avoid the baby crowd.Id be totally psyched about this place if it were cheaper and had better beer.",3.0

"I'm definitely a fan of Oxcart Tavern! I've been here twice, once for dinner and once for brunch and both times I left extremely happy. The burger I ordered was delicious, full of flavor and toppings, and cooked to perfection. Brunch was equally satisfying and I was elated to see almost all of my favorite brunch items on the same menu. I had so many choices I found it hard to choose! And when I did, I was not disappointed.-1 star for the lengthy wait for our meal.....sigh....but it was worth it!!!!!Bottom line: Check this place out if you are waiting for brunch at the Farm on Adderley and can't get in. This is just as good, without a wait!",4.0
"As we desperately tried to find some grub nearby in Brooklyn on a gloomy Saturday afternoon, we stumbled upon another hidden gem.... with happy hour AND no wait! And just as we thought it couldn't have gotten better than this..... it did. We immediately fell in love with their homemade pretzel appetizer that was served warm and came with a side of horseradish dijon mustard and cheesy cheese dip. Delicious!They have a wide range of ox burgers for you to choose from as well as ox-less and other non-meat options. You can also create your own burger and stuff as many toppings as you like inbetween the bun! I ordered the Cali-Patty and topped it off with a fried egg and my boyfriend ordered the Ahi Tuna burger. Both were monstrous in size and came with a generous side of fries and a pickle. They also make their own homemade chipotle ketchup which added the right amount of kick where it was needed!It's the little things that make a restaurant stand out and Oxcart Tavern definitely stood out. On top of the tasty food, the decor and staff at Oxcart were both incredibly welcoming. I can't wait to return again on a nice summer evening. They let the windows wide open on nice days which would be perfect to enjoy a couple of (happy hour) beers while munching on their finger foods.",4.0

I have only been there twice but both times the service was good and we got a table within 5 minutes (on a Friday around 8:30p). Sure, it could be bigger but it's already twice the size of most Manhattan restaurants. I love low-key places like this and am glad to have it near-by.

"4.5 stars.  Just went here with the bf for a tuesday date night.  Pumpkin beer on tap, duck confit pot pie as an app, and the holy winner batman: daily special burger topped with foie gras and welsch cheddar.  AMAZING!  The burger was cooked perfectly medium rare, dripping with flavor, on a sesame seed bun toasted to crispy perfection.  We had tried to come here for dinner on a Saturday night and our hunger couldn't stand the wait; the place was packed and now I know why.  Having this place around the corner is definitely a win.  Super nice and attentive service, and great music on, too.",5.0
"Their burgers are delicious and well made. They always have a great selection of beers and wines as well. My only complaint is that sometimes their staff isn't fully knowledgeable of the menu or drinks.  My friend asked for a manhattan--cocktail staple every bartender should know and the bartender said he didn't have the ingredients. So then she asks for a dark and stormy and he says ""can't do that either, it has the same ingredients are the manhattan"" Um, excuse me? Basically, just stay clear of hard liquor here unless it's straight up!",4.0

For clarification, groups of 6 or more are charged an 18% gratuity which my group did not qualify for. I will definitely be going back to try some more of their fantastic burgers, and support the chef/owner who evidently cares immensely about both his product and custom service, which is getting harder to find now these days.

"So Oxcart is a few blocks from my house. I always wanted to try it and finally got over there on Friday (4-13-12). WHERE DO I BEGIN?The space itself is extremely small.

Tasted like a regular burger. The meat was juicy but that's the only plus. Again, the french fries were disgusting. DESSERT: very limited options so we didn't order anything.

We sent it back - it took around 20 minutes until we got the new one - and it was also overcooked and dry. Also, the french fries had been redunked in oil so they were overcooked and not fresh. When we let the waiter know, he didn't seem to care that much and we felt like they could have done more to try and compensate.",2.0
"This is a phenomenal neighborhood place, BUT also worth going out of your way to  have a great burger, fish and chips, onion rings, with good beer, and wine options and a super friendly staff.That all said, my husband and I decided somewhat last minute to have a casual pre-wedding dinner here, rented the place out, and it was perfection. The set up was great, the food was delicious and kept coming and the staff made everything so easy and pleasant.David was accessible, generous and creative with all food. I wasn't sure about the concept of a burger bar but all the burgers were fresh and tasty and there were more condiments that I could of come up with.The private party really exceeded my expectations... highly recommended.",5.0
"Friendly service,  excellent special of lobster risotto - not too heavy, just delicious with plenty of large chunks of lobster! Yum. And, always, a stellar burger.",4.0
"The Oxcart looks and feels like a place the troops would have eaten at Valley Forge, if someone had invented the hamburger and cable TV.We went here because I was craving a burger.  I was not disappointed.My wife kept going on about the fact that the burgers here are grass-fed.  I mean the cows are grass-fed, not the burgers.  Well, I'll tell you it does make a difference.  Especially when served with a side of fries, spicy dijon, and a can of SixPoint Sweet Action.  (My wife had the ""Ox-less"" burger, which is made with hemp and chia seeds.  It sounded awful, but she enjoyed it.)We went on a Sunday night around 8pm.  The place wasn't crowded, but not empty either.  Service was pleasant and informative.",4.0
Great after work spot. The Happy Hour specials is right on! The decor is laid back. Not very roomie which is why I gave it a 4. Had the veggie burger & it's o'so yummy. Not often would you come across a good veggie burger ya know.....1st time I came to the spot they had lemongrass flan on the menu & HAVE MERCY it was spectacular! Haven't seen it on the menu since. Perhaps it's a summer dessert. Thank goodness it's a right around the corner location cause I dig.,4.0
"If you are a meat eater, this is a good spot for you. Vegetarians may be less than thrilled with the menu. I always go for the roasted chicken -- the five onion truffle sauce is like none other. For brunch I recommend the german pancakes or split the buttermilk biscuits with a friend (2 per order). A cozy spot to catch up with friends or a relaxed date, Ox Cart is neighborhood spot that feels like home.",4.0
"Great pub food and the only place in Ditmas Park that I return to regularly (besides Sycamore). I won't hold it against them that they use the ridiculous term ""gastropub"".  The brunch is fantastic, especially the giant German pancakes.  They have a wide selection of winning appetizers, with the top prize going to the soft baked pretzels, which are as good as they get.  Can't lose with the burgers here but everything is pretty damn good.",5.0

"The burgers are awesome, and its one of the only cozy bar/food spots within walking distance of this area, but their service really sucks, i was coming here regularly, but just got crap service one too many times. From my ""order being lost"" and my food not coming out for 2.5 hours (no joke) to being told theres a 45 min wait when only 2 people are waiting for a table, to the disinterest and lack of friendliness from most of their employees.

"Went here twice. Love their burger. First time rookie mistake - I ordered the ribs. It had way too much BBQ sauce. And their crab cake was burnt. Second time, I ordered the Cali-burger.

I would have loved it more if we had the booth.",4.0
"I tend to be picky about places.  Especially about the quality of service.  When the only complaint I have about a place is that there were Yankees fans at the bar, and even they weren't that bad (they put the game on, but I guess you have to have something on) that says a lot.  The food is amazing, the service is great.  Just go, it's that good.It is small, so if your group is larger than 2-4, or you go after 8, you will be waiting for a table.  But it will still be worth it.",5.0

"Update:I've recently been just ordering from these guys. They can get held up last two times I've called. An hr wait. The burgers were 15 bucks a pop. They are GOOD burgers but it adds up. They at least give you a burger frequent customer punch card so eventually I land a free burger. I have also ordered the Fish and Chips but didn't really dig the vinegar veggies. The Brussel Sprouts Appetizer is 9 dollars and quite overpriced. I'll keep ordering but haven't decided if I want to step back in that tiny place for sit down. Walked in here hoping to have a nice brunch instead dealt with too cool waitstaff adorned with obnoxious shirt ""Don't Tell Me to Smile"". My wife is pregnant asked if we can sit at the booth (one side booth seating other side was a chair). The waitress said no it's only for 3 to 4 people and we had to wait 20 to 25 minutes. We tried milk and honey but it was all bar seating. We come back low and behold they seated two guys that were right behind us in the booth chairs by surprise SPLITTING THE TABLES. We sat at the bar which in this case the bartender, which seemed like the manager, spoke to us and treated us like customers. We got a table but it was tiny next to the window. My wife said she needed a booth obviously the waitress doesn't listen. We went back to the bar paid for our hot chocolates and left. The bartender noticed we weren't happy and comped them for us. She should of worn a shirt that said ""Don't tell me to smile because I'm deaf"". The food menu looks really good and I like the tavern look and feel. But I couldn't enjoy it because of transient hipster f*&s with their stupid shirts and poor service skills. WATCH DOWNTOWN ABBEY! The servers don't smile but at least they are attentive and courteous.Whatever James M. My point is service with a smile is a dying art and to dish out 6 dollars for lukewarm half filled glass of ""hot"" chocolate is a bit of an elbow in the ribs after denying a pregnant patron a comfortable seat TWICE. I will clip my toenails at home watching downtown abbey because it's entertaining, cheaper then a 3 dollar hot chocolate and I can use the change to make my own hot chocolate. Very Well SIR!",3.0
"Dining at this place was like home away from home. It was a nice way to spend our last night on our trip, away from the hustle and bustle of Manhattan. We came here on the recommendation of a friend, and we're so glad we did! Everything about this place was awesome including the decor, the ambiance, the chill music. The chefs and staff were all friendly and the food was delicious.  I had the Alamo burger and it was ridiculously good along with the fries and homemade ketchup.  The spinach pies were petite but delectable.  The drinks, well, if I wanted to indulge, I'd drink more than two.  And, Chef David's pie of the day was strawberry, which he apologized wasn't the prettiest of pies he's ever made.  What was wrong with it? Nothing! It was nothing but pure love in that berry deliciousness. I'd also like to point out that they had longaniza quesadillas which I thought was pretty cool.  Longaniza is a Spain-originated smoked sausage, and if it were spelled longganisa, it'd be a Pilipino sweet sausage (I'm Filipino, and I admit, I perked up when I saw it on the specials board.)  Didn't get to try it, but kudos for using sausages that not a lot of people know about - no matter which country it was from.Upon walking in, you can tell that this is a neighborhood joint where regulars go to unwind, to catch up with friends, get a drink, grub on high-quality fare and relax. It's nice to know that even if you're not a regular, you're still treated with the same quality service.I'll definitely be back, when I'm in the area again!",5.0
"In the world of fancy burgers, this place is tops. Fantastic, if somewhat pricey, burgers with interesting toppings and tasty fries.  Quite frankly, all a girl needs.  I tend to go with La Vaca (fried jalapeno = love), but the Cali-Patty is close second, if I'm feeling healthy (because, you know, adding a bunch of sprouts transforms this burger into a salad).  The pretzels are good as is the duck confit.  If I didn't love their burgers so much I'd probably try more of the tantalizing things on the menu, but alas, I am a burger fiend.  My only complaint is the staff, who can be kind of slow and inattentive.  The place isn't that large (or terribly busy as I often go at off hours).  Please notice my empty water glass or like come near enough that I can hail you down and request more.  And once they failed to present us with our pretzels until after we had our meals (luckily, they were nice about the fact that we were no longer interested in eating them given that we were halfway through our fantastic burgers).",4.0

"Damn. Being, literally down my street, I really really wanted to like this place. But after eating there, I would probably travel to the Bronx on a local train for it.

Although the bartender didn't know what a scotch and soda was, she made my lady's strawberry margarita ($6) with mad love, crushing up real strawberries and using some good booze. Once seated, we couldn't pass up the sweet chili onion rings with the lime dipping sauce ($4), awesome. Keeping with the southwest theme, I got the La Vaca burger ($12), a perfectly cooked, well seasoned, gigantic slab of beef covered in melted Oaxaca cheese and topped with deep fried chipotles...So unbelievably delicious and well executed. Such a good value. I licked the plate. Each burger comes with thick fries and a home-made ketchup worth bathing in. Two strong drinks, amazing burgers and rings all for under $50 including tip...No complaints.Overall, a very eclectic food menu for a tavern, although they need to beef up the drink options if they wanna label themselves as one. Nice atmosphere and nicer wait-staff. An oasis in an otherwise undeveloped south D-park. This place is bound to blow up, hopefully bringing more places like it.",5.0

"I moved to this area two and a half years ago, and my first breakfast was at the old Pomme deTerre.  When I saw that Oxcart Tavern was replacing my brunch standby, I knew I was going to be critical of this new kid that was going to be its replacement.The first time I actually went over to visit was the evening of the 2010 December Snowpocalypse.  Imagine our surprise to find the place not only open, but pleasantly packed!  The football game was on, and we were treated to superbly made burgers, as well as their scrumptious brandied ice cream.  Because nothing is as yummy during a blizzard as a few scoops of ice cream~ this is the truth, believe me.Kudos to Oxcart for being the best troopers this side of Brooklyn!  You are a worthy heir to Pomme de Terre.",4.0
"4.5 Stars. Just moved into the Ditmas Park/ 'Victorian Flatbush' neighborhood a week ago, and Ox Cart Tavern opened several days later. Went there the other night with a few friends for dinner and drinks.The ambiance was nice: Welcoming, flatteringly lit, somewhat rustic, vaguely hip. Wooden or metal rustic and-or vintage tables, many by large windows. A 6-8 person wooden bar in the back overlooking a partly open kitchen.The staff were friendly and accommodating.The food was quite good. (Hope it doesn't go downhill, as sometimes happens, if and when the place becomes popular and stays around for a while.) Though none of us were craving burgers, we were persuaded by the creative and appetizing descriptions of the burgers on their menu, all ended up ordering them and were not disappointed.The fried bologna sandwich looked intriguing-- likely good, because someone would either have to be supremely confident in their craft or delusional to advertise such a seemingly low-grade dish, and the quality of the food we had recommends the former. Ribs brought to another table looked very good. The desserts brought out-- traditional sundaes and floats-- seemed decent. For next time.Beer selection was quality but a bit sparse, they say they are getting more in soon, wine selection good and wine-pours generous. Their liquor license is being finalized, so no liquor as yet. The one aspect I didn't like (hence 4.5 stars) were the two oversized  television screens at either side of the bar-- at the time, showing a baseball game. They seemed incongruous and distracting given the particular low-key dining and hanging-out vibe. The idea is probably to attract the probably relatively high percentage of sports watchers in the area, and it very well might. But sports bars usually aren't my thing, and if this becomes the general vibe, I'll have to make my regular haunts a little farther away on Cortelyou.They also offer free wifi-- although, considering the current vibe, and that they open in the evening, it would seem a bit awkward to sit there working on a laptop. It seems that they're simultaneously trying all channels to see which one is most profitable, and hopefully this experimentation will settle into an atmosphere organic and welcoming rather than unnatural and offputting.Definitely a welcome addition to the neighborhood: so far the only decent bar/restaurant in the southern Ditmas Park area. May it be a harbinger of more.",5.0
"Pretzel was hot and steamy. The mustard and cheese sauce was good. My fish and chips were excellent. My friend's Ox-less burger tasted amazing. The sister got the special of the night, a Scallop Po Boy Banh Mi. It was rather disgusting. I understand they were trying to combine two great sandwiches but it did not work out. Their pickled veggies tasted weird. Service was a little show but I didn't mind so much. It's a small restaurant, I like the feel of it. It's definitely an option in the neighborhood.",3.0
The Oxcart Tavern relishes in the traditions of offering old home atmosphere with an attentive and customer friendly staff.

"i'm in love with this place.2 weekends ago, i met a friend here for a quick drink before catching the train to the city.  it was a sunday during brunch, early, and i saw their new menu (they said they had just changed it over) featuring biscuits and (ahem) sausage gravy.  so of course i had to order that.  biscuits were the best i've ever eaten!  crispy crunchy outside, and all that softness and fluffiness a biscuit should be on the inside.  the gravy is spicy, delicious, with so many herbal notes that perfectly compliment the great sausage-ey flavors.  they served me a side of honey butter too (oh my gawd!!) and all was washed down with a strong, snappy mimosa.  yum.for TWO WEEKS now, i've been dreaming of these biscuits.  these elusive, only-served-at-weekend-brunch-biscuits.  last weekend, i was away, so today, (FINALLY!!! : ) was the first day i could go get me some.  i got two orders AND a sundae (heh heh  : )) - (make the angry birds pig laughing sound here).  confession:  i got a side of sausage, too.the server who helped me out today was super sweet - i had called and they were baking up a new batch of biscuits.  he said they'd be ready in about 20 minutes.  because i was also ordering a sundae, he totally took it upon himself to COORDINATE the timing of my sundae preparation to match precisely the biscuits coming out of the oven, as well as my arrival for pickup!  facilitating this involved him calling me back, and a very complex and perfectly executed plan with absolute success - my sundae had not melted by the time i got home.  (thank you, friend!  : )now, all of these foods (ice cream..  biscuits..) are really simple - they're nothing spectacular or avant garde or anything - BUT - oxcart manages to stamp (not only their personalized service) but their personalized twist on everything, and the results keep me coming back for more.  crispy signature biscuits.  the best sausage gravy i've tasted.  and then there's the sundae.  a whole banana sliced down the middle, lots of gooey toppings (peanut butter, some kind of sticky sweet perfection caramel sauce, chocolate sauce, chocolate ice cream, whipped cream and a perfect, stemmed cherry, all sprinkled with these crunchy, toasty, sweet-salty nuts..5 out of 5 stars, and thank you very, very much for everything oxcart!  amazing food, good prices, fantastic waitstaff = a very happy customer!!! xoxo",5.0
"I live about ten minutes away from Oxcart, and there was a time when I would have given it five stars. At its best, the food is great, the atmosphere is low-key, and we've spent many a lovely evening here.However, in the past six months or so, the service has completely deteriorated.  When we went for brunch recently the waitress couldn't even describe the specials to me, and looked at me like I was an alien for asking her. The time before that, we went for dinner, I was brought the wrong burger, and it took another ten minutes to bring me my correct meal while my husbands food sat there getting cold. But on our last visit, the staff's crowd management really made me vow to never return. The place is small and tables fill up fast. The dinner crowd came in and milled at the bar to wait, crowding around the back tables where people who had long since finished their food sat there loitering. The staff did not try at all to encourage these people to leave, while about 20 or so eager diners waited for tables.A friend told me that he walked into Oxcart on a recent Friday night, and behind him about ten more people arrived, looking for a table. The restaurant was full and the staff ignored the incoming diners. When he finally approached a waitress to ask for a table she laughed and said ""when people come to the door and we're busy, we ignore them and hope they'll just leave."" Nice, Oxcart. The food is good, but not good enough to justify treating your customers like this.",2.0

"I moved to this area two and a half years ago, and my first breakfast was at the old Pomme deTerre.  When I saw that Oxcart Tavern was replacing my brunch standby, I knew I was going to be critical of this new kid that was going to be its replacement.The first time I actually went over to visit was the evening of the 2010 December Snowpocalypse.  Imagine our surprise to find the place not only open, but pleasantly packed!  The football game was on, and we were treated to superbly made burgers, as well as their scrumptious brandied ice cream.  Because nothing is as yummy during a blizzard as a few scoops of ice cream~ this is the truth, believe me.Kudos to Oxcart for being the best troopers this side of Brooklyn!  You are a worthy heir to Pomme de Terre.",4.0
"4.5 Stars. Just moved into the Ditmas Park/ 'Victorian Flatbush' neighborhood a week ago, and Ox Cart Tavern opened several days later. Went there the other night with a few friends for dinner and drinks.The ambiance was nice: Welcoming, flatteringly lit, somewhat rustic, vaguely hip. Wooden or metal rustic and-or vintage tables, many by large windows. A 6-8 person wooden bar in the back overlooking a partly open kitchen.The staff were friendly and accommodating.The food was quite good. (Hope it doesn't go downhill, as sometimes happens, if and when the place becomes popular and stays around for a while.) Though none of us were craving burgers, we were persuaded by the creative and appetizing descriptions of the burgers on their menu, all ended up ordering them and were not disappointed.The fried bologna sandwich looked intriguing-- likely good, because someone would either have to be supremely confident in their craft or delusional to advertise such a seemingly low-grade dish, and the quality of the food we had recommends the former. Ribs brought to another table looked very good. The desserts brought out-- traditional sundaes and floats-- seemed decent. For next time.Beer selection was quality but a bit sparse, they say they are getting more in soon, wine selection good and wine-pours generous. Their liquor license is being finalized, so no liquor as yet. The one aspect I didn't like (hence 4.5 stars) were the two oversized  television screens at either side of the bar-- at the time, showing a baseball game. They seemed incongruous and distracting given the particular low-key dining and hanging-out vibe. The idea is probably to attract the probably relatively high percentage of sports watchers in the area, and it very well might. But sports bars usually aren't my thing, and if this becomes the general vibe, I'll have to make my regular haunts a little farther away on Cortelyou.They also offer free wifi-- although, considering the current vibe, and that they open in the evening, it would seem a bit awkward to sit there working on a laptop. It seems that they're simultaneously trying all channels to see which one is most profitable, and hopefully this experimentation will settle into an atmosphere organic and welcoming rather than unnatural and offputting.Definitely a welcome addition to the neighborhood: so far the only decent bar/restaurant in the southern Ditmas Park area. May it be a harbinger of more.",5.0
"Pretzel was hot and steamy. The mustard and cheese sauce was good. My fish and chips were excellent. My friend's Ox-less burger tasted amazing. The sister got the special of the night, a Scallop Po Boy Banh Mi. It was rather disgusting. I understand they were trying to combine two great sandwiches but it did not work out. Their pickled veggies tasted weird. Service was a little show but I didn't mind so much. It's a small restaurant, I like the feel of it. It's definitely an option in the neighborhood.",3.0

"Any port in a storm, or so the saying goes.Friends wanted to introduce us to this place durning Hurricane Irene, and while the kitchen was working at full-tilt, and seemed to be on par. The front of house was in big trouble.A one hour wait is not unhear of especially when everything around you has closed for the storm. They took our number and said they'd call us. (The bar was full, so there was no place for a party of 6 to wait.). After an hour, we called them. ""Your table should be ready in 15 minutes."" And we were back in 15 minutes -- cell phones make exact timing pretty easy to determine. ""You weren't here, so we seated someone else.""The giving away of the table was disappointing, but the rudeness of the waitress was just inexcusable. ""We're busy, I need you to move.""Let's define busy. Yes, the restaurant was full -- which means 27 people seated not including the bar. (We counted.) Most waitpersons I know, can handle a section that seats 30 without having a meltdown. when we were finally seated, the 6 of us were placed at a 4 top. Okay -- you wanted us to be able to sit, so that's fine. Drink and appetizer orders were made right away. We waited 32 minutes, without so much as being offered water, for us to get up and pick-up our own drinks off the bar which was only a partial order as the waitress hadn't asked the bartender for all of the drinks. (There were only 2 mixed drinks, a soda, and 3 beers.)At that point, after our friend who'd invited us left feeling completely mortified, that the bartender decided to make our table her personal project.

"I've only lived in this area since November, but Oxcart Tavern has quickly become my regular brunch spot. As in, I have been to Oxcart for brunch nearly every weekend since moving here.The best thing about brunch at Oxcart is that there usually isn't much of a wait. I am an early bruncher these days, and I find that as long as you arrive before noon, there is literally no wait. I have waited to be seated at Oxcart once, and even then it was only for 20 minutes.The other best thing about brunch at Oxcart is everything else. Their coffee is delicious, although the presentation is inconsistent...the first couple of times I went, it was brought to the table in a French press...that doesn't appear to be the case anymore (although this might be because of people like me and my boyfriend, who would end up shooting coffee across the table literally every time we pushed down the plunger). The food is great...their brunch menu is large and varied, especially with the addition of the daily specials. Some highlights include the chicken fried chicken and the shrimp and grits, but literally everything I've had so far is delicious.If you go on Sunday and are feeling like something on the lunchier side of brunch, they offer wings on Sunday. The first time I tried the wings I got the hot wings, which were delicious! However, I felt that they could've been a little hotter, so the next time, I foolishly requested the evil wings. BIG MISTAKE. They were literally painful to eat. I managed to get them all down over the course of 2 meals, with the help of large quantities of Oxcart's simply AMAZING homemade ranch dressing (not a blue cheese fan).Oxcart also does a great dinner, but due to the longer waits and the louder atmosphere at night, I'm more inclined to stop by for brunch.",5.0

"AWESOME Alamo burger with egg, sweet onion and BBQ sauce and delish side salad instead of friesAll organic meats, casual atmosphere, great-friendly staff and owner!Prices are reasonable. Excellent happy hours. Going back for the ribs!",4.0
"God, I love this place. I was bummed when Pomme de Terre closed, but the Ox Cart is a great replacement. I come here pretty regularly, so by now I've tried almost everything on the (small, very well edited) menu, and seriously - everything is good. For apps, I love the pretzel with cheese sauce, the chili-coated onion rings (the lime mayo dipping sauce is so good!), and the mini spinach pies. The burgers are some of the best in Brooklyn - I usually go for the Good Ole Boy (cheddar, bacon, sauteed mushrooms), but they have some more unusual variations as well. They recently added an Ahi Tuna Burger which is awesome - order it on the rarer side and it's like a seared tuna tartare patty coated with some kind of amazing spice blend. Also, their tartar sauce is like crack - I have no idea what they put in it, but it is miles above mayo mixed with relish. The spicy BBQ spare ribs are another of my favorites.I'm also seriously addicted to their gelato sundaes (with homemade hot fudge, bourbon caramel sauce, and crumbled praline!), but the entree portions are so huge I usually don't have room. They're open late though, so sometimes I go after the dinner rush and just get dessert. They have a good wine and beer selection, a full bar, and two happy hours - the usual 5-7 and then a later one from 10-closing. They also have daily specials - usually one appetizer, entree, dessert, and sometimes a specialty cocktail. I just wish this place were bigger cause there's sometimes a wait at busy times. They apparently started serving lunch recently, so I'll have to check that out soon.",5.0

On the plus side they promptly offered to remove it from our bill which was a nice gesture. But as far as food quality goes its been hit or miss lately.",3.0
"Like others I was skeptical of Oxcart replacing Pomme de Terre but am now fully a fan and have been multiple times.  The burgers are great, as are the sliders and the chefs specials are always on cue...Chili during ""Snowpocalype"" was exactly what I wanted.  We bonded with our waiter over whiskey selections and football scores, not to mention the service is quick and friendly.The restaurant set-up is cozy and at times you might find yourself eaves-dropping on your neighbor's conversation without trying, but I've always had friendly and pleasant neighbors so it's not a problem.  Luckily for me this place is a five-minute walk, but if you are a burger person it is definitely worth the trip. Plus two happy hours a day is hard to beat.",4.0

"So I had the burger cause that's all the hype, right? (Though it was so hard to pass up on the Duck Confit Pot Pie....) And the hype was right.

"AWESOME Alamo burger with egg, sweet onion and BBQ sauce and delish side salad instead of friesAll organic meats, casual atmosphere, great-friendly staff and owner!Prices are reasonable. Excellent happy hours. Going back for the ribs!",4.0
"God, I love this place. I was bummed when Pomme de Terre closed, but the Ox Cart is a great replacement. I come here pretty regularly, so by now I've tried almost everything on the (small, very well edited) menu, and seriously - everything is good. For apps, I love the pretzel with cheese sauce, the chili-coated onion rings (the lime mayo dipping sauce is so good!), and the mini spinach pies. The burgers are some of the best in Brooklyn - I usually go for the Good Ole Boy (cheddar, bacon, sauteed mushrooms), but they have some more unusual variations as well. They recently added an Ahi Tuna Burger which is awesome - order it on the rarer side and it's like a seared tuna tartare patty coated with some kind of amazing spice blend. Also, their tartar sauce is like crack - I have no idea what they put in it, but it is miles above mayo mixed with relish. The spicy BBQ spare ribs are another of my favorites.I'm also seriously addicted to their gelato sundaes (with homemade hot fudge, bourbon caramel sauce, and crumbled praline!), but the entree portions are so huge I usually don't have room. They're open late though, so sometimes I go after the dinner rush and just get dessert. They have a good wine and beer selection, a full bar, and two happy hours - the usual 5-7 and then a later one from 10-closing. They also have daily specials - usually one appetizer, entree, dessert, and sometimes a specialty cocktail. I just wish this place were bigger cause there's sometimes a wait at busy times. They apparently started serving lunch recently, so I'll have to check that out soon.",5.0
This was the first restaurant I ate at on the day I decided to move to the neighborhood. My soon-to-be roommate and I split the pretzels and I opted for the crab cake sliders. The food was delicious and their burger menu looks pretty appetizing.,5.0
"They kinda fell off from when they first opened. They aren't very consistent, I've had a few disappointing meals there and even one that was inedible. I ordered the blackened cod, took two bites and couldn't eat anymore. My girlfriend tasted it and she also said it tasted really weird. On the plus side they promptly offered to remove it from our bill which was a nice gesture. But as far as food quality goes its been hit or miss lately.",3.0
"Like others I was skeptical of Oxcart replacing Pomme de Terre but am now fully a fan and have been multiple times.  The burgers are great, as are the sliders and the chefs specials are always on cue...Chili during ""Snowpocalype"" was exactly what I wanted.  We bonded with our waiter over whiskey selections and football scores, not to mention the service is quick and friendly.The restaurant set-up is cozy and at times you might find yourself eaves-dropping on your neighbor's conversation without trying, but I've always had friendly and pleasant neighbors so it's not a problem.  Luckily for me this place is a five-minute walk, but if you are a burger person it is definitely worth the trip. Plus two happy hours a day is hard to beat.",4.0
"The place opens at 5 but the kitchen opens at 6, however they advertise that they open at 5, I got there at 440 and they told me to wait till 5 which was fair , at 5 they said they will open at 6 and I never stayed to try any food, guess what? I'm not going back!",1.0

"I loved it! They have a limited menu, mostly burgers and beer. But everything is really good. I'm not sure what they did to the bacon cheese, but it wasn't just dropped on. Maybe they baked it until it was slightly chewy? The meat tasted fresh and was cooked right. The fries tasted like potatoes. The same goes for the banana split. I had it without peanut butter. They used gelato instead of ice cream. The sauce was well made. So the choice is limited, but everything is good.My only suggestion is they should have a kid sized burger for like $2 off. It was a little hard for my 10 year old to get hold of his burger. There were several kids there around 6 PM.

I hope this is the start of a long run.",4.0

"We've been addicted to Oxcart for a while after trying out the Chicken BLT, which is possibly the best chicken sandwich I've ever eaten (bacon, ciabatta, delicious sauce, etc).  We loved the spinach pies and the artichoke/pepper pies that replaced them, the onion rings (crazy!) Alamo burger, and their new steak sandwich is freakin killer.  It's good enough for me to ride the mile out when delivery isn't happening.  Very friendly staff, all around great spot to relax and enjoy a meal in the neighborhood;.  I'd give it 6 stars if I could",5.0
"Stopped in on a Sunday at 5pm for an early dinner and was greeted with Happy Hour instead.  Kind of ridiculous their kitchen wasn't open--especially since they advertise Sunday NFL football.  Also, really unprofessional to see kitchen staff stuffing their faces with food--obviously from the menu--out in the dining area when none of the paying customers could order food until the kitchen opened at 6pm.  My friends and I were simultaneously grossed out and hungry watching that guy...Food was pretty good.  Got the Ox-Cart Burger and homemade pretzels.  Burger was slightly overdone, but still tasty.  The pretzels were delicious.  Come here for those alone.  Great Happy Hour specials--$3 beers and half price wine by the glass.  Cash only.  I'll try Ox-Cart again in a few months when they work out the kinks and get a credit card machine.",3.0
"this is a really nice addition to the neighborhood, good vibe, really nice servers, great happy hour specials, and overall just a great place to hang out. the burgers, crab cakes, ribs, oysters, etc are all phenomenal! my only complaint is that the menu could really use some lighter items - last time i was there they only had one salad (which for my taste is too sweet) and most options are either fried, heavy, or both. some more salads and lighter dishes (chicken or turkey sandwich maybe?) would bump it up to a five for me dor sur!",4.0
"I loved it! They have a limited menu, mostly burgers and beer. But everything is really good. I'm not sure what they did to the bacon cheese, but it wasn't just dropped on. Maybe they baked it until it was slightly chewy? The meat tasted fresh and was cooked right. The fries tasted like potatoes. The same goes for the banana split. I had it without peanut butter. They used gelato instead of ice cream. The sauce was well made. So the choice is limited, but everything is good.My only suggestion is they should have a kid sized burger for like $2 off. It was a little hard for my 10 year old to get hold of his burger. There were several kids there around 6 PM. It was pretty kid friendly for a bar.If you are a foodie and like burgers and beer, this is the place.",5.0
I heard your burgers etc are great. Unfortunately I never was given an opportunity to try your food! I visited your establishment sometime in the summer & again today 9/912. I stood there by the bar for a good 15 minutes waiting to give my order to someone! I was not asked if I needed to order or anything! Until I was ready to walk out your establishment; a man dressed in chef clothing from the kitchen in the back had to ask if I needed to order something. At that point I was ultimately disgusted with your service and walked out!,1.0
what a great neighbourhood spot!  fried pickles were delicious and a late night happy hour....what more could you ask for??!!,5.0
"went here to hang with my boyfriend and his friend for a few drinks. we ordered a bottle of wine and the waitress gave us the wrong bottle, but the wine she gave us was still good lol. i ordered this huge salad with vanilla poached apples, and nuts and a delicious vinaigrette. had a few bites of a lobster roll which was really nice. id def have to visit again before i can give it a decent review, i was only here for a short period of time, but my experience was decent.",3.0
"Popped in and sat next to an open window on a lazy, misty, cool Sunday evening.  This place is perfect for an autumn night.Very tastefully designed, love the low key and warm atmosphere.  I appreciate the TVs, actually.  I like to be able to catch some scores and highlights without being at a loud and ridiculous sports bar on occasion.The burger I had - The Alamo - was so incredible.  After one bite, I forgot all previous burgers I'd had and now there is just that.  I'm smiling just thinking about it.  The beef (well, ox meat) was just-rightly juicy, the homemade ketchup awesome, the fried egg and onion ring on it were excessive and perfect.  My heart will probably burst a few years earlier now, and it will burst with The Alamo.A few more beers and, if they get a strong liquor selection, it'll be 5 stars.",4.0

"This place is outstanding! The food is really great, the interior is quaint but very charming and inviting, the location is convenient (I live in Flatbush/Ditmas Park area, but the place is also a block off the Q and B Newkirk station), and the staff are really down-to-earth and friendly. For meat-eaters and vegetarians alike, there are a lot of choices.  For each burger option, you can substitute the veggie burger, which is probably my favorite vegetarian patty ever. I've tried four different burger varieties here and they have all been delicious, unique, and filling. My boyfriend thinks that the meat burgers are super-delicious and even really likes the vegetarian version. The best time to go here is really right at 6:00, even 5:45 because it's not a big place and can get filled up really quickly. The bar is open at 5:00 and the kitchen opens at 6:00, but check their website to verify which days that this is the case. Note: You MUST try the Soft Baked Pretzel appetizer.  Sooooo gooooooood.",5.0

"my first experience at oxcart tavern was over a year ago for a few drinks & an order of their sweet chili-coated onions rings -- still some of the best onion rings i've had in brooklyn, by the way. while i admit i wasn't entirely in-sync with my environment at the time (a bit enamored as i was interviewing one of my favorite musicians, & his friend recommended this place because it was quieter than the neighborhood's alternatives), upon return i found myself reassured by the modest charms that i did remember it for. their food is relatively dirt cheap for its rather outstanding quality, so you won't bust your wallet even though it may taste like you are. the main thing i took away from oxcart tavern is that it's rather cleanly stylish, yet comforting; this place balances class & comfort better than almost any establishment i've been to in new york. an oasis in the mainly residential ditmas park. a real treat.",4.0
"So yesterday, we went to Oxcart, to get some of our favorite burgers in BK. We are regualrs at the place, and recently I noticed an inconsistency in the burger. Every time the real chef is there the burgers are to die for, however take my advise do not order burgers when you see the dishwashers making your burger. I am paying 15$ for the burger because of the chef, for that much I might as well go to the diner. The meat was dry, for the last 3 times ive been there, all when the owner/chef wasnt there. On top of that the waiter we had had a horrible attitude like he was doing us a favor, he screwed up the order  and then rolled his eyes when I told him its wrong order. This place is getting worse every time I go there, I never write reviews, but I am very upset that this place the way it was is getting worse and worse everytime you go there!!!!  NOTE TO THE OWNER!!! If you want return customers to stay please make the burgers like they are when you make them, and get waiters that are not miserable with their lives!!!",1.0
