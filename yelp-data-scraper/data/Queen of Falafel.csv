"Great hole in the wall falafel restaurant$7 falafels are great and they are freshly made pita's that are microwaved, stuffed with falafel, diced cherry tomatoes, cucumbers, pickles, light sauerkraut and tahini.the eggplant sabbich is a good cold sandwich filled with chewy roasted eggplant and boiled organic eggs sandwich that has a good cool buttery taste with the same citrusy toppings as the regular falafel.They usually also have daily specials like kabob sandwiches and chicken shawarmas which are also great alternatives.They have great sauces including a spicy harissa, pickeled mango chutney, pickled jalapenos, and a green herb hot sauce. All these make the falafel stand out.This place usually doesn't have too long of a line but can get a bit crowded with bar hoppers, locals, and the like. They have about 4 seats that quickly open up, and if the back room is open (usually during the day) you'll have a spot to eat at, or you have to just pick up and eat it outside.",5.0
"There is a reason this place has five stars- simply amazing! Queen of Falafel is a tad hard to find on google maps since it is part of the House of Yes in bushwick - but don't let this deter you! I ordered the falafel pita sandwich and my friend ordered the falafel platter. The sandwich was only $7 and extremely filling. The restaurant is small and only has 8 chairs total - all seating is on a 3 separate counters that are near the ordering counter or in the room directly adjacent. Lots of people get takeout from here too, though we decided to eat in for the full experience. They have a water cooler with cups available - the water has sliced lemons and mint inside which was a nice touch. The sauces were also amazing- added some slice to my already amazing pita. To get really specific, I especially enjoyed the tomatoes. At such a cheap price they very well could have found tiny diced tomatoes that have no flavor but instead the tomatoes (as seen in the photo) were halved cherry tomatoes, super flavorful. Will definitely return here soon!",5.0
"Pretty good food. Not bad falafel at all but somewhat forgettable. I like that they have a variety of sauces... didn't like any of them but that's cool. I want to give this place another half star for being pretty good but I found them grossly over priced which is which sinks this rating.Like...the prices were double those you'd see at oasis or what you typically see in Queens.Additionally I get it, you're part of YES they have cool events I'm an overweight white lady about to bang down the door to middle aged sometime pretty soon but the service I received was just like ""hey what do you want ok cool here it is now"" whereas the handsome European fellow behind me was meeted greeted and treated to samples of like everything... not cool.... but would eat again I guess.",3.0
"When I heard that Rivka Orlin, (owner of the famed East Village Restaurant serving arguably some of the best Mediterranean food since the early eighties) was opening a Middle Eastern, Mediterranean fusion restaurant in my neighborhood, there was no question I was going.Located in the corner of House of Yes... an arial dance and alternative venue well worth checking out... there isn't much space.  This isn't a place durning the winter a large group can come to.  there is only a small bar along the hallway with mirrors lining the wall to sit in front of  and eat. It's a place that is great for yourself or you and a friend to pop in.  When the weather is better you can hangout on the bench out front or by one of the nearby parks.  Many great lil pub/bars in the area allow you to bring in take out as well.The menu is a great mix of sandwiches, plates (including a main and two sides) and soups and desserts.  I went with the famous and I believe the BEST falafel I have ever had!  I also tried their special of Red Lentil Soup which came with homemade croutons.  It was incredible, and to round it out I had the fresh Moroccan Mint Iced Tea... It was a perfect lunch!  I will be back many many times!",5.0
"The food here is excellent. Fresh ingredients, clean preparation, really tasty hummus. Nice ratio of veggies to falafel balls on the sandwich. Friendly staff and really lovely little location with adorable decor and delicious smells-not your typical greasy falafel joint. Strong hipster vibes.That being said, and I truly hate to be that one person who has a less than stellar review, but this isn't the best falafel I've ever had, and it certainly was not worth $7. This is NYC-you can get the best falafel in the world for $2.50. Prices here are obnoxiously high, for a (slightly better than) run of the mill falafel. I appreciate the convenience of this location, and am always into supporting local/small businesses, but I doubt I will become a regular here.",4.0
"SO yummy and fresh.  This place is really cute and tiny.  There's not much seating, but you get to enter into the side where there is a wall covered in flower wallpaper and a mirror across from that and bar stools to eat on a bar table.  The mirror is really weird so when you're eating you're staring at yourself.  I think on the other side of the curtains between the mirrors is a secret club (?) weird!  The food is affordable and so filling!!",4.0
#Holy Moly. The Pita here is so fluffy. I got this Hummus Falafel Plate when I went to the House of Yes for a Bernie Sanders fundraiser. That place is pretty cool. They had aerial dancers. A lot of people thought I was a narc though. #Hippies.,5.0
"I cannot begin to explain how amazing it is to have this restaurant in the neighborhood. Everything on the menu is fresh, healthy, and absolutely delicious!Don't miss out on the red lentil soup (and killer bread to accompany it) or the meatball sandwich. The mint lemonade is fresh and homemade, and the homemade baklava is to die for!",5.0
"Lovely! Well the place is very small and can only accommodate so many people, but the food here makes up for that, could be the best falafel I lve ever had! Also, the chips with the Harissa ketchup was extremely tasty! The staff are really nice too, I went to Brooklyn for this place after reading the reviews and was not disappointed.",5.0

"This place must be new because there's no way it can be this good with so little reviews.  Tiny, unassuming and easy to miss, but you'll be so sorry if you do!  Perfect for a quick bite.Falafel sandwich is amazing.  This isn't your cheap and dirty (yet still delicious) Mamoun's falafel -- they use really high quality ingredients and it tastes so fresh and flavorful and packs so much spice into each bite.  All the different elements in the sandwich come together really nicely, and the pita is so warm and fluffy -- even though it's the whole wheat one.The only suggestion I might have is to cut their raw veggies a little bigger for more texture because their falafel texture is of a courser grade.  Otherwise, A+!  It's quite reasonable at $7 for how big it is too -- 2 meals for someone with a small appetite like me!Love the self-serve sauce bar where you can get harissa, herb green sauce, tahini and pickles.  Mediterrannean salsa bar, here I come!The place is very small, but they have this long narrow hallway with candles and counter seating that give it the authentic, unique Brooklyn vibe.  Workers are chill and down to earth.  They share a bathroom with a performance hall -- which is kind of weird if you walk in while they're performing, but whatever.  Free show!",5.0
"Excellent little spot: Just the right amount of ""authentic,"" just the right amount of innovation/fusion (not much), fantastic quality ingredients, decent price point (for the quality), nice people, and great food politics (owner is Israeli-I believe- but always credits regional foods such as Yemeni, Tunisian, etc... Not to mention Arabic salad rather than Israeli salad!--though Iranians would argue for Shirazi salad and Turks for shepherd salad-- Peace in the Middle East (and North Africa) indeed :)I would agree with the other reviewer that $7 is high for a falafel sandwich, but if it's true that they give 15% to charity, then maybe it's ok?",5.0

"Let's not cut corners. Let me just say it, the falafel here was the best falafel I have EVER had. So If you want some good ass falafel get on that L train! But why not five stars? Well, the place was small. And when I say small, I mean really small, perhaps tiny is a better word.Plus they were charging $8.00 for a plate of labneh?!? Excuse me honey, I saw where that labneh came from, it came from a container, the same brand I have in my fridge right this second, and that entire container is like $3.50! So who you foolin' baby doll? Oh yeah, them oblivious caucasians. And let me tell you a little something something...(there's a lot of white people here)! Just thought I'll give them minorities a heads up!",4.0
"Wow the flavors are so good. I really enjoyed the variety of fresh made sauces, fresh veggies and that that the pita pocket is is literally packed with falafel.

"Great atmosphere, nice date/lunch spot. Super good pricing.Went with a friend spit the Hummus Falafel plate ($10), and a Shakshuka sandwich ($7). Both were extremely delicious.The Hummus Falafel plate was set up very neatly and came with an arabic salad which was very refreshing. One of the best falafels I've had in New York, very crispy and fresh tasting.The Shakshuka sandwich is my favorite by far. Eggs were perfectly poached and tomato sauce was spicy and complimented the sandwich. Also skip the canned and bottled drinks and get the mint lemonade or iced tea!!",5.0
"This place was awesome. My friend and I were looking for places to eat, but couldn't make up our minds. We decided to stop in because it was the nearest location & my friend was vegetarian as well.

Totally recommend this to anyone who wants a good healthy tasty meal in a cute cozy place.",5.0
"Fantastic!  I usually don't go on and write reviews (I didn't even remember my password, had to reset and everything) but I HAD TO for this place.  I love falafel, and am pretty judgie about them.  This was AMAZING!  I had a falafel sandwich and the pumpkin soup. My husband had the turkish meatball sandwich and loved it also.  AND they were sooo kind!  I look forward to going back there- for the amazing food and amzaing positive energy!  Keep it up!!! (Oh, and they give 10% of their profits to an orphanage in Nepal.  housewithheart.org)  I am def. glad to have this in the neighborhood.*My husband told me that I needed to get back on to inform the reader that I stopped mid sandwich to write the review... now off to finish.  SO GOOD!",5.0
