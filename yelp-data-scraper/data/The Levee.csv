"I took her to the Levee...and the Levee was WET! Took a first date here, and got lucky. I owe it to the cheese puffs and the board games that only have half the pieces.

"I don't really have anything good to say about this bar, other than the free cheeseballs and good drink specials that they run all night and not just for happy hour.  They also have a nice outdoor space with some Connect Four stuff going on.  But the really understaffed bar and poor service is the reason why every time I end up back at The Levee, I remember why I haven't been there in so long.It's tiny and mobbed.  It is always mobbed on hot nights, which is great.  The lines for the bathroom get in the way of nearly everything.  I have been here many times, but my most recent (and pretty terrible) experience is probably my last.  I waited at the bar with my boyfriend for about 25 minutes before I was able to get a bartender's attention and get a drink.  All the bartenders were running around, really unfriendly, and seemed generally pissed to be there.  It was obnoxiously loud and the bartenders were bothered when they couldn't hear your order, yet I watched one of them turn the music up several times throughout the night.  It's just nearly impossible to get service or a drink when it's crowded and you're not a single white hipster girl with visible tattoos.  I was too afraid to open a tab because I didn't want to wait 30 minutes before I was able to close it out and another 20 for the bathroom line.  So, we ended up going to another bar.  Ugh, The Levee.",2.0
"Solid dive bar, good music, could eat those cheese balls all day!Unfortunately the bathrooms smell worse than a portapotty. Make sure to tell a friend where you're going in case you pass out from the stench and they can't find you!",3.0
"This is a dive bar so I suppose gnarly stank bathrooms come with the territory. But when I first walked in I noticed the  entire bar smelled, so its not just limited to the bathrooms. It smelled like pits and socks and I kinda felt reluctant to drink from the glass my drink was in. The patrons are understandably hipster the music selection definitely caters to that demographic. I honestly do not think there's one song in that juke box that's made after the 90's. On a nicer note they do have cheese balls but I didn't try it.",2.0

"CHEESE BALLS ! Haha yum!This place is not my cup of tea but it was a nice place to celebrate a friends birthday. I wouldn't see myself driving from NJ just to come here to hang out for a while. When I went it was pretty packed but the bartender did a great job getting out drink orders. The drinks were also made well with the balanced amount of liquor and mixer. The bathrooms are right by the bar so you can smell the bathroom odor, yuck. They have some arcade games and a pool table which is a nice touch.",3.0
"Fun vibe - decent selection of beer and whisky with cool combos (Lone Star + shot of tequila) or the Fratboy (bud (?) + shot of jagermeister).  Also have a selection of late night snacksThe bartenders were great, barbacks were a little standoffishMy only concerns were 1. the bathroom - unisex and dirty as hell, but I guess that is to be expected of a unisex bathroom2. I love places that allow dogs, but there was a super smelly dog roaming around without his owner... like clean dogs only please, I was gagging",3.0
"Cute dive bar tucked in a little corner of Williamsburg on N. 3rd Street. Free cheeseballs on the counter, cheap drinks, good company. Came here for the first time with coworkers for a good night. Tried a frito pie, which is fritos covered in chili. Very delicious and inexpensive comfort food. Another cute gimmick they have is that you can buy a friend a drink on credit. They will write your name on a board and how much money you have left in your ""account"".",4.0

Do you like craft cocktails and molecular gastronomy? I mean who doesn't? But not most days. Most days you want to fight that nasty assed L train nightmare out to Brooklyn and sit at a nice friendly bar with cheap drinks and free cheese balls. oh and maybe a cool dog....and pool....and darts...and games....and some sort of fucking garden I was too lazy to look at cause I was having too much fun sitting at the nice sunny bar sipping boilermaker specials and eating cheeseballs with my girlfriend.Yeah go here....it's a great bar with a great staff. Or you know go somewhere else and be less happy...I don't really care I'm not your fricking dad....I'm just old enough to be him.....,5.0
Run of the mill dive bar with excellent specials and free cheese balls.Dangerous items:$5 beer and whiskey shot$7 tequila and gatorade (what?)$5 tequila and lonestar beerThis is probably the best bar to pregame in the area.

He took my boy friends order and was pretty rude about it. He gave him his drink and immediately asked for him to pay for it. When my boyfriend gave hi, the money, he took it and counted it twice and looked at him as if he didn't get the right amount. He then proceeded to make small comments like ""did you say something,"" getting all macho and what not. My boyfriend was in no way talking to the bartender but to us. Now your probably wondering whats going? Well, I hate to bring race in this but the bartender was white, my boyfriend is a dark skinned latino (he looks black.) Seeing the environment, there was no other ethnic people in the bar but us. The bartender was fine until the moment my boyfriend walked in. He also had side comments with his other bar tender buddy, an it was these taunting comments towards my boyfriend. We finished our drinks and we left.

We all ordered the Texas Two Step, multiple times over (a Lone star bottled beer & a shot of tequila for $5)!! Can't get better than that. We enjoyed the complimentary bowls cheese puffs & red twizzlers @ the bar with refills that seemed never ending. We didnt mind :) They have a $15 minimum on credit card charges but they didnt charge me any tax on my drinks - which was cool.Very chill bar & great for locals & if you're seeking a non-pretentious trendy bar.

Then, when I finally placed my order, which I had a long list for our table, he would run away before I could finish and proceed to yell at me and give me attitude for not telling him in its entirety....There is nothing redeeming enough about this place to ignore what a horrible and not so fun place this is!",1.0
"I would NEVER, EVER go to this bar again.My two male cousins and I were looking for a nice cheap bar to go in and hang, since one of them was visiting from out of town. We googled this place and it got decent reviews so we decided to stop by. When we got there it was not too crowded and we were able to get seats at the bar. The bartender took our order. We paid and drank, like anyone would. This is where it turns very sour. My boyfriend comes and joins us about 15-20 mins later and we noticed a shift in the bartenders attitude. He took my boy friends order and was pretty rude about it. He gave him his drink and immediately asked for him to pay for it. When my boyfriend gave hi, the money, he took it and counted it twice and looked at him as if he didn't get the right amount. He then proceeded to make small comments like ""did you say something,"" getting all macho and what not. My boyfriend was in no way talking to the bartender but to us. Now your probably wondering whats going? Well, I hate to bring race in this but the bartender was white, my boyfriend is a dark skinned latino (he looks black.) Seeing the environment, there was no other ethnic people in the bar but us. The bartender was fine until the moment my boyfriend walked in. He also had side comments with his other bar tender buddy, an it was these taunting comments towards my boyfriend. We finished our drinks and we left. I would never go there again because of the rude racist actions that happen last night. The drinks were cheap but it's not worth going through an experience like that. It's 2015, we should be over this whole race thing.",1.0
"Not far from my job, divey, and I must have had two bowls of cheese puffs.  Is that not how you describe the ideal place to go after work on a Friday ?  The drinks are cheap, there are snacks, and they have some kind of tequila/gatorade drink.  Genius!I know, I want to go now too.",4.0
"Awesome local bar in the heart of Williamsburg. Stopped by here yesterday afternoon with some friends to celebrate a birthday after we got turned down by Radegast beer garden across the street for having birthday balloons that we could not bring inside (lame!). We were the only ones in the bar @ around 4pm but people started trickling in shortly after. This bar has excellent drink specials. We all ordered the Texas Two Step, multiple times over (a Lone star bottled beer & a shot of tequila for $5)!! Can't get better than that. We enjoyed the complimentary bowls cheese puffs & red twizzlers @ the bar with refills that seemed never ending. We didnt mind :) They have a $15 minimum on credit card charges but they didnt charge me any tax on my drinks - which was cool.Very chill bar & great for locals & if you're seeking a non-pretentious trendy bar. Will definitely be back next time I'm in the area to try out some of their other drink specials.",4.0
"I popped my Williamsburg cherry.. first off, what a nice area that actually has cheaper drinks and space.  Manhattan is nice.. but this place is not cheap to live.  Heard it runs people 3k per month which is crazy!Okay.. back to this place.Loved it.  Cheap drinks.  The house box wine was great at $4 per glass.. they have free cheeseballs.. and board games.  Enough said.. I would definitely go again.The minus one was the unisex bathrooms.. boys are just gross.. they like to pee anywhere except the toilet.",4.0
"Awesome spot. Cheap drinks that are strong, cheap snacks, board games, and a pool table. Unique crowd, good music. Open late, til 4am. I wouldn't venture to Williamsburg just to go here, but it's a great bar nonetheless. You can get a good snack for under $5. Tortilla chips with queso, frito pies, hot dogs, a sloppy joe, popcorn, and other stuff I can't remember right now. I got a generous portion of tortilla chips and queso for $4. The drink selection is pretty impressive as well. Many different bottled beers, many I've never even heard of. And their drink specials were great. Particularly their 3 mixed drinks, all served in a pint glass, $7 a piece. They filled a pint glass with ice then filled it up 3/4 of the way with liquor and topped it with the other ingredient. I tried all 3. The Beam Cream - Jim Beam and Cream Soda. Tastes good, lots of Jim Beam flavor.The Dreamscicle - Stoli Vanilla and Orange Soda. Tastes amazing. Doesn't taste alcoholic.The Gatorita - Tequila and Lemon-lime Gatorade. Tastes like a lot of tequila with not much Gatorade. I don't like tequila too much though, so I'd stick with the other 2.They also have the Sportsman Special ($4, bottle of beer+ Shot of Whiskey), the Texas Two Step ($5, bottle of Lone Star + Shot of Tequila), and the Frat Boy ($5, bottle of Buddweiser + Shot of Jager).Cheap drinks, cheap snacks, and games will keep me coming back here, most likely to start off when heading to other Williamsburg attractions.",5.0

"This place could be amazing, if the bartenders were swapped out with some that had a much better attitude.This bar has two bars within and the bartenders must operate on both sides of the wall, which means they constantly have to switch back and forth. I was waiting on one side to order a drink and a bartender came over to this side, didn't make eye contact, didn't say anything, just reached under the bar, grabbed a box of some ingredient for some drink, and left. This happened at least twice. At this point, I'm perplexed, do they not serve over here? Oh wait, they do, you just have to basically yell your drink order at them and then they respond. Wow, it's no wonder they were so pissed and grump-tastic, they were perpetuating their own misery. Awesome.The drinks are what gave these place 3 stars. They were delicious. I fell in love with the Creamsicle. It tasted like its namesake and only cost around 7 bucks. They had a variety of other drinks that were just as amazing.They also offer pool, which we played a few games of, as well as cheeseballs, which I would not recommend eating because well they are on top of the bar and liquid is often splashed on top of them.To summarize, drinks are amazing, service sucks, and stay away from the cheeseballs",3.0
This is a great bar to start or end your night. They give you unlimited cheese-puffs. Just be careful because you might end up having sticky orange fingers.

This is the kind of bar that begs you to get shithammered and crazy without ever asking. Here's why:- Cheap beer+shot combos- A very dark and divey layout that reminded me of the bars near the industrial area I grew up in. At any moment I was waiting for a crew of union ironwokers to come in and kick all the kids out- A pool table- Board games- Very tasty and very unhealthy snacksYou can also buy someone a drink without them being there.

"Today is a day for appreciating the smaller things in life; including the Levee. When the going at Redegast gets expensive, pop across the street to the Levee, and try not to gauge yourself on $3.00 well drinks and unlimited cheese balls. So good and so bad all at the same time. It's dark, it plays a variety of music, and there is food at least during the day time (albeit things like a ham and cheese sandwich or a bag of Ruffles and some onion dip. Or Twizzlers).

"This place could be amazing, if the bartenders were swapped out with some that had a much better attitude.This bar has two bars within and the bartenders must operate on both sides of the wall, which means they constantly have to switch back and forth. I was waiting on one side to order a drink and a bartender came over to this side, didn't make eye contact, didn't say anything, just reached under the bar, grabbed a box of some ingredient for some drink, and left. This happened at least twice. At this point, I'm perplexed, do they not serve over here? Oh wait, they do, you just have to basically yell your drink order at them and then they respond. Wow, it's no wonder they were so pissed and grump-tastic, they were perpetuating their own misery. Awesome.The drinks are what gave these place 3 stars. They were delicious. I fell in love with the Creamsicle. It tasted like its namesake and only cost around 7 bucks. They had a variety of other drinks that were just as amazing.They also offer pool, which we played a few games of, as well as cheeseballs, which I would not recommend eating because well they are on top of the bar and liquid is often splashed on top of them.To summarize, drinks are amazing, service sucks, and stay away from the cheeseballs",3.0
This is a great bar to start or end your night. They give you unlimited cheese-puffs. Just be careful because you might end up having sticky orange fingers. This is a neighborhood bar that brings in a crowd. You can get very cheap drinks. I'd recommend trying the dreamscile. Such a simple but yet delicious drink.,4.0

This is the kind of bar that begs you to get shithammered and crazy without ever asking. Here's why:- Cheap beer+shot combos- A very dark and divey layout that reminded me of the bars near the industrial area I grew up in. At any moment I was waiting for a crew of union ironwokers to come in and kick all the kids out- A pool table- Board games- Very tasty and very unhealthy snacksYou can also buy someone a drink without them being there. There's a chalkboard behind the bar and they have a month to come claim their drink.,3.0

"Today is a day for appreciating the smaller things in life; including the Levee. When the going at Redegast gets expensive, pop across the street to the Levee, and try not to gauge yourself on $3.00 well drinks and unlimited cheese balls. So good and so bad all at the same time. It's dark, it plays a variety of music, and there is food at least during the day time (albeit things like a ham and cheese sandwich or a bag of Ruffles and some onion dip. Or Twizzlers). This, ladies and gentlemen, hipsters and drunks, is the dive bar in its truest form. The ultimate affirmation: there is Big Buck Hunter.",5.0
"Levee is everything anyone could ask for in a dive bar, including the Very Important Cheese Balls. It's strange that the beer specials are all beers that I've never heard of (Lone Star???) but they're pretty good and they have things you know, too, like Budweiser and PBR. Oh, and there's Frito pie. Do you know what that is? Go get some, either way.Their patio has worse hours than my bank.",4.0

Count me in. Not only that, but the beer is served in a cozy. If there's one thing I like more than beer, it is cold beer. I want it so cold that it'll freeze your teeth off and a cozy keeps my beer properly chilled.I was there shortly so I was unable to partake in free cheese balls, but I surely will be back for some.",5.0
"Great spot! Cheap drinks, board games, and free cheeseball....swhat more do you need to have a good time?!? I came here on a Saturday night and really had a good time.

If I lived closer I would definitely be a regular, but since I don't live close, I'll have to try and stop by again when I'm in the hood. Its def not a bar for everybody becuase its pretty divey, but it suits my style well. Full disclosure: if you have a beard you will probably get service at the bar faster than a pretty girl.

"Yikes, how have I not reviewed the Levee?  I see it here in my bookmarks labeled 'to review.'  I hope it feels good to write a positive review.  My last one really left me totally drained.  I'm just now almost recovered.  I'll try.  No promises.This place is fantastic.  For starters, it opens at noon (or possibly 11am) on weekdays, so if that's your jam, you're toast.  The cheese puffs are a nice touch and another argument for not wearing pants to a bar.On top of that the Sportsman is one of the finer deals in this part of town though it's been emulated all over the place.  Jukebox is not bad AT ALL.  Hot dogs I haven't tried yet and rest assured the lack of chocolate starfish is likely to keep fred durst away.They have some games here too like jenga, which can be kinda fun I guess.  They also have a photohunt machine, which is sweet.And a pool table.There are also some other arcade games.  Buckhunter I think.But the real reason to come here is that it's cheap and dark.  It smells like beer and the floors are sticky.  What else do you want out of a bar.  It reminds me of El Rancho (Spanish for ""The Ranch"") in Durango, Colorado.  There are 2 unisex bathrooms.  The credit card minimum is $20 I think, which would normally be a plus.  However, because drinks are fairly inexpensive, if you come with a few friends and take turns buying rounds, making the minimum can be tricky.  Or not I guess if you are awesome at drinking a ton and blacking out.",4.0

"My now-BF, then just friend, told me that all bad things in Brooklyn are blamed on the Levee. This may or may not be true, but any place that has $3 tequila shots can't produce good things afterwards. My story: These $3 tequila shots are what changed my friend into my BF as this is where our 1st kiss was. Damn $3 tequila shots. This is also where my BF got my little sister shit-faced drunk for the 1st time in her life & she threw up in one of the booths (sorry Levee). Their bar snacks are the bestest. Twizzlers. Cheese balls. Blow Pops!. I never knew all this junk combined with multiple tequila shots tasted so delicious. They have board games! Jenga while drunk is very fun. It's the only dive bar I've ever frequented more than once. It's a dive bar you should frequent more than once. It gets the job done & you have still have $$ in your wallet @ the end of the night. The best, most unique thing though has to be the chalkboard. You can buy drinks/shots for a friend today & they will write their name on the chalkboard + whatever you bought them. When said friend comes to the bar on a later date, they can claim it. I haven't tested this out, but it seems like a cool idea. Then again, you might be paying for a drink no body will get.

Didn't rate it 5 stars because it took like 5 minutes ti be served and there were only about a dozen other people and 4 bartenders. Great spot to get drinks and catch up with friends.",4.0

"Yikes, how have I not reviewed the Levee?  I see it here in my bookmarks labeled 'to review.'  I hope it feels good to write a positive review.  My last one really left me totally drained.  I'm just now almost recovered.  I'll try.  No promises.This place is fantastic.  For starters, it opens at noon (or possibly 11am) on weekdays, so if that's your jam, you're toast.  The cheese puffs are a nice touch and another argument for not wearing pants to a bar.On top of that the Sportsman is one of the finer deals in this part of town though it's been emulated all over the place.  Jukebox is not bad AT ALL.  Hot dogs I haven't tried yet and rest assured the lack of chocolate starfish is likely to keep fred durst away.They have some games here too like jenga, which can be kinda fun I guess.  They also have a photohunt machine, which is sweet.And a pool table.There are also some other arcade games.  Buckhunter I think.But the real reason to come here is that it's cheap and dark.  It smells like beer and the floors are sticky.  What else do you want out of a bar.  It reminds me of El Rancho (Spanish for ""The Ranch"") in Durango, Colorado.  There are 2 unisex bathrooms.  The credit card minimum is $20 I think, which would normally be a plus.  However, because drinks are fairly inexpensive, if you come with a few friends and take turns buying rounds, making the minimum can be tricky.  Or not I guess if you are awesome at drinking a ton and blacking out.",4.0

"My now-BF, then just friend, told me that all bad things in Brooklyn are blamed on the Levee. This may or may not be true, but any place that has $3 tequila shots can't produce good things afterwards. My story: These $3 tequila shots are what changed my friend into my BF as this is where our 1st kiss was. Damn $3 tequila shots. This is also where my BF got my little sister shit-faced drunk for the 1st time in her life & she threw up in one of the booths (sorry Levee). Their bar snacks are the bestest. Twizzlers. Cheese balls. Blow Pops!. I never knew all this junk combined with multiple tequila shots tasted so delicious. They have board games! Jenga while drunk is very fun. It's the only dive bar I've ever frequented more than once. It's a dive bar you should frequent more than once. It gets the job done & you have still have $$ in your wallet @ the end of the night. The best, most unique thing though has to be the chalkboard. You can buy drinks/shots for a friend today & they will write their name on the chalkboard + whatever you bought them. When said friend comes to the bar on a later date, they can claim it. I haven't tested this out, but it seems like a cool idea. Then again, you might be paying for a drink no body will get. Who would know?",4.0
"Did I say dive bar with free cheese balls? No. But I'm saying it now. The Levee is a dive bar with free cheese balls. With good music. And board games. It's dirty (in a good way) and loud (also in a good way). The clientele ranges from weird hipsters to your average tolerable hip yet casual bar-goer, all of whom are participating in a melting pot of fun-having drinkers. All goers of (dive)bars, check this place out.",5.0
"Levee rocks. It always has, and always will. The bartenders aren't jerks, if they're mean to you it's just because you're simply not cool enough to be there. That's only half sarcastic, seriously don't come here if you're lame, go to the beer garten across the street with the rest of the yuppies. There are only a handful of things you can do to have a bad time here, so let me save you a trip....The drinks listed on the chalkboard are there for a reason, stick with them and you'll be golden. If you order a Mojito you're gonna look like a jerk, and you may be directed to the long list of novelty drink bars along Bedford where the bartenders aren't burdened with patronage, and have all night to make your girly drink...Also...Do yourself a favor and never try to play pool. This bar has an unfortunate wanna be thug infestation concentrated in the area around the pool table. You can distinguish these vermin from regular patrons due to their color coordinated outfits, aroma of axe body spray, and the following cry (which scientists believe to be some sort of mating call) ""yo it's last pocket dawg""?!?

"Radegast was packed, so I came in here with a big group last weekend.  Two words to sum up this place: GRUNGY, and hipster. Pool is only a dollar.  Since it's not usually too crowded, you can bet you will be able to play.  There's a nice outdoor area, where smoking is permitted- for a non-smoker like myself this was a big downer to the outdoor area.  It has picnic table style seating.They've got free twizlers, cheese-poofs, and board games, so I'd say those are the 3 best qualities of Levee. The bathroom was pretty gross- it smelled awful, and one of the toilets was definitely close to falling off the wall.Decent place to hang out with lots of space and moderately priced drinks on a warm afternoon.  Otherwise, the space is kind of torn up, dark, and kind of a free for all in terms of what/who you find in the bar (people playing banjos, dogs off of their leashes, etc).",3.0

"Being from KY, these are some of the cheapest and best beer specials that I have ever seen, ever!  You can't even get something like The Sportsman for that cheap here in the Commonwealth.The hallmark drink of The Levee is The Sportsman, which consists of a shot of Evan Williams and a beer with a Canadian Maple Leaf, even though the beer is brewed in WI.  This might sound vile and disgusting to the timid and weak, but trust me Evan Williams for a well Bourbon is fantastic and I have had worse beers.  Until I see otherwise, for the price this is the BEST BEER SPECIAL IN THE COUNTRY, raised eyebrow and skepticism welcomed, but prove me wrong.Other great traits include having a whole host of rainy day board games, free cheeseballs, Big Buck Hunter, rocking juke box, friendly bar tenders, hot dogs, an outdoor patio, and any bar that carries Old Overhault Rye whiskey is top notch in my book.Best drink special in the country and only 4 stars?  Well its minor, but the patio closes at 11pm.  Understandable as to not cheese off the neighbors, but its still kind of a bummer to be herded in so early.Without a doubt, one of the most enjoyable bars in the city.",4.0

Anyway I decided to make the trek over the Williamsburg Bridge and visit it again. Needless to say I was very glad I did. It was still happy hour and I was like a kid in a candy store. There were a bunch of metal heads playing tons of Ozzy on the juke and the whiskey was flowing. The jukebox has a great selection of music might I add.

"Surveying Brooklyn's nightlife as a first timer seemed to exhibit many different kinds of bars and restaurants -- ranging from a German beer hall to a small dive bar across the street, The Levee. Take a grain of salt with my excitement since this bar is my style of living, but if bang for your buck and a great welcoming atmosphere with free cheese balls isn't your bag, then you're probably not reading this. Giving the impression of being smaller than it seems The Levee has a whole other side that almost mirrors its front boasting seats, a pool table, and a couple of fun shoot em up arcade games. Don't worry about being bored with just a drink here, free to use board games, condoms and cheese balls will keep you busy! Falling in love with a specific drink order is going to keep me from talking about any others. The Fratboy - a simple Budweiser and a shot of Jägermeister for five dollars flat will keep you flat on your face five orders later. Other similar orders like The Sportsman are sure to keep you coming back. Bartenders were friendly and the bar was surprisingly clean, although I may or may not have gotten stuck in the bathroom when the doorknob fell off. Don't worry, I'm not writing this from the bathroom, I got out and it was fixed the next day. Standing room only busy on the weekends but nice and calm in a booth any other night.

"In addition to the requisite Big Buck Hunter, The Levee will also provide you with a selection of your favorite childhood board games to rediscover while enjoying their $4 or less non-happy hour beer options, (Yuengling), and beer and shot deals.

"Being from KY, these are some of the cheapest and best beer specials that I have ever seen, ever!  You can't even get something like The Sportsman for that cheap here in the Commonwealth.The hallmark drink of The Levee is The Sportsman, which consists of a shot of Evan Williams and a beer with a Canadian Maple Leaf, even though the beer is brewed in WI.  This might sound vile and disgusting to the timid and weak, but trust me Evan Williams for a well Bourbon is fantastic and I have had worse beers.  Until I see otherwise, for the price this is the BEST BEER SPECIAL IN THE COUNTRY, raised eyebrow and skepticism welcomed, but prove me wrong.Other great traits include having a whole host of rainy day board games, free cheeseballs, Big Buck Hunter, rocking juke box, friendly bar tenders, hot dogs, an outdoor patio, and any bar that carries Old Overhault Rye whiskey is top notch in my book.Best drink special in the country and only 4 stars?  Well its minor, but the patio closes at 11pm.  Understandable as to not cheese off the neighbors, but its still kind of a bummer to be herded in so early.Without a doubt, one of the most enjoyable bars in the city.",4.0
"This place is mediocre at best, and I'm only giving it three stars because so many people honestly like coming here.  Personally, I think the Levee is on par with all the young townie bars every city has.  You have your cheap drinks, billiard table, crummy food, and arcade games at the back.  A few booths so you can shout at your friends while sitting down and a handful of incomplete board games to play when you're really far gone.  This place follows a tried and true formula and doesn't offer anything special or unique.  I think the appeal is that the Levee could be anywhere, Cleveland, Ohio, Buffalo, NY, or Des Moines, Iowa, it doesn't matter!  You can feel like you're back where you grew up, hanging out with all the lifers; without worrying about sitting next to your ex girlfriend or bumping into that bully from 9th grade at the urinal.",3.0

"This place is just plain awesome. I just wished I lived in New York so I could go here all the time. No bullshit, just amazingly cheap drinks and drink specials. I was in NYC for a weekend and had come here awhile ago but my memory of it was hazy since I was pretty intoxicated at the time. Anyway I decided to make the trek over the Williamsburg Bridge and visit it again. Needless to say I was very glad I did. It was still happy hour and I was like a kid in a candy store. There were a bunch of metal heads playing tons of Ozzy on the juke and the whiskey was flowing. The jukebox has a great selection of music might I add. The one drawback here is you may get drunker than you intended since its so damn cheap (if you can call that a drawback). So go the Levee you will leave very happy I guarentee it.",5.0
"Cheap beer, chilled-out bartenders, mellow music and plenty of space to breathe. All of these attributes would have landed The Levee a solid 3 stars. But wait...

Hell, across America.My tummy is grumbling just thinking about it...",4.0

"This is the greatest place ever.They carry Sofia (champagne in a can) which instantly makes me happy.The bartenders and patrons alike were incredibly nice, and they have a whole mess of board games (including Apples to Apples).The 'specials' are hilarious, I mean ""Texas 2-Step"" for cheap is a shot of tequila and a Lone Star, I'm a Texan and I didn't even know Lone Star existed in New York, in fact I had heard otherwise from Tex-pats.  I had a Sofia and a ""Dreamsicle"" (Stoli Vanilla with orange soda) and then pretty much the best bar experience of my New York trip here.",5.0
"Surveying Brooklyn's nightlife as a first timer seemed to exhibit many different kinds of bars and restaurants -- ranging from a German beer hall to a small dive bar across the street, The Levee. Take a grain of salt with my excitement since this bar is my style of living, but if bang for your buck and a great welcoming atmosphere with free cheese balls isn't your bag, then you're probably not reading this. Giving the impression of being smaller than it seems The Levee has a whole other side that almost mirrors its front boasting seats, a pool table, and a couple of fun shoot em up arcade games. Don't worry about being bored with just a drink here, free to use board games, condoms and cheese balls will keep you busy!

They offer some awesome board games, and have a fun back yard area with a large scale connect-4.

"The Levee needs a franchise closer to my midwestern home base. I came with a group of friends on a Saturday night and could not have had a better experience. The bartenders are friendly, the beers are inexpensive (AND COME WITH COOZIES) and there are unlimited free cheeseballs. I can't think of anything more satisfying. We also noticed a well-stocked board game selection in the corner, but after a few $4 Sportsmans (a dark beer and a whiskey shot) couldn't see straight enough to play Yahtzee.",5.0
A no frills dive-bar in Williamsburg. The ambiance is definitely hipster. You get free cheese balls and tiwzzlers which is cool. Drinks are pretty inexpensive (I got a shot of Whiskey for $4). Not really my type of scene but the overall atmosphere was very chill.,3.0
"Gotta be 5 stars. Love this place. I think it is the first bar that I went to when I moved to NYC. It became our 'hoodie bar, and still is to an extent. It always feels like home. Great beers, although we tend to stick to the specials. Texas two-step and the classic, The Sportsman. 4$ for a black label and shot of Ev Williams. They offer some awesome board games, and have a fun back yard area with a large scale connect-4. While Fri/Sat have started to become a little hipster-crazy as of late, it's still great any night of the week. Of course they also have the candy and cheese poofs, if you need more of a selling point. Check out the Levee, never fails to disappoint.",5.0

"Cheeeeeeeseballs!  I ate free cheese balls here for about seven hours on a recent weekend night, and I think my hands are still stained orange.  This is a price I am willing to pay, especially because I also got to switch it up with free Blow Pops and Twizzlers.I loved the Levee.  We came in early and they turned on a football game at our request- awesome!  The bartenders are cool and responsive.  This bar has a big variety of beer in the best way possible.  You can order a craft brew bottle for around $7 or go the cheapo route and take advantage of one of the specials- usually a can (with koozie!) of cheap beer with an accompanying shot.The crowd was a bit mustachioed for my usual tastes, but this did mean that there was a guy who tried to pick us up via a half-hour conversation about hair-care products.  Hilarious!  The only downside was the huge crowd as the night got later and, more importantly, the bathroom situation.  There are only two single-person bathrooms for the whole bar, and they get gross and the line gets looooong really quickly.  Other than this, an all-around fun and inexpensive experience.",4.0

"This was my first time to Williamsburg.... (thats just a warning so people aren't all 'wellll... what did she expect??') I REALLY liked this place. The layout is really cool, the outdoor area is awesome (with the exception that it closes at 11) and the drink specials were awesome. You gotta love a shot and a beer and the combos were clever and tasty. ALSO, cheeseballs.... great idea. Can't go wrong with shoving handfulls of puffed rice cheese in your face.

"Man, is this place fun. Frito pie, free cheeseballs, chili cheese dogs and drinks made with Gatorade?!Yes. It's true. The Levee is cheap, has pretty decent food (tho I was sad the bun on my chili cheese dog was not toasted) and they have the Dreamsicle. That is orange soda and vanilla vodka and it is as delicious as it sounds. Comes in a pint glass, drinks like candy...basically trouble in a glass. They also have great shot and beer combos (I particularly liked the Lonestar + shot of tequila combo...yum). I will be going back here frequently and staying forever. The area around the bar is pretty crowded but there are seats in the back and tons of board games.Watch out on those Dreamsicles tho, I had a hell of a headache the next morning. Yeah, must have been the soda...not the 5 drinks.",4.0

"Popped in here for, what else: drinks. Darkly lit atmosphere, decent jukebox, grungy here & there, but not a true dive. Drinks were not dive bar cheap- but they were fairly priced. They also had a decent selection.If you even just skim the reviews, you'll see that cheeseballs are provided as an amenity. You'll also notice people seem to be pretty divided over it, high/low style. I hit it at happy-hourish on Saturday & it got steadily busier as the night went on. I wouldn't wanna hit it at peak weekend time, but as an off-time bar? Within walking distance of the hood i'm visiting? Yes please.",3.0
"The Levee is seriously bad news. I've never walked in here and not stumbled out in deplorable condition. Hell, I've even woken up with dubious tattoos I barely remember getting after starting here too early. The combination of the ridiculously cheap specials (the Texas Two-step especially) at $4-5 for a beer and a shot, the infinite array of activities (from a lovely pool table, to darts, to oversize connect four in the backyard, to videogames, pinball, and board games), the very decent jukebox, the cheap food that deludes you into thinking that you can keep up the pace, and the comfortably dive-y room just tend to hold you here much longer than you meant to stay.Approach with extreme caution. The Levee always seems to win.",4.0
"Cheeeeeeeseballs!  I ate free cheese balls here for about seven hours on a recent weekend night, and I think my hands are still stained orange.  This is a price I am willing to pay, especially because I also got to switch it up with free Blow Pops and Twizzlers.I loved the Levee.  We came in early and they turned on a football game at our request- awesome!  The bartenders are cool and responsive.  This bar has a big variety of beer in the best way possible.  You can order a craft brew bottle for around $7 or go the cheapo route and take advantage of one of the specials- usually a can (with koozie!) of cheap beer with an accompanying shot.The crowd was a bit mustachioed for my usual tastes, but this did mean that there was a guy who tried to pick us up via a half-hour conversation about hair-care products.  Hilarious!  The only downside was the huge crowd as the night got later and, more importantly, the bathroom situation.  There are only two single-person bathrooms for the whole bar, and they get gross and the line gets looooong really quickly.  Other than this, an all-around fun and inexpensive experience.",4.0

"Went here for a date and it was actually quite a fun place with decently priced drinks - $6 for a jack and coke. Not too crowded just the right amount of people. There's plenty to do with darts, pool, deer hunter, and a variety of board games, it provides a lot more fun than most bars. Also pretty easy to meet new friends for the night and just hang out. Definitely recommend it if you're in Williamsburg.The hipster scene wasn't too overwhelming either which was a plus to me.",4.0
"Let's just say that the cheeseballs sold me on my first visit. So necessary.If I could live in The Levee, I would.

"Cheese puffs. No pretzels here. Free cheese puffs and twizzlers, which I have no objections against because it's always a pleasure munching on something while you down brews. Which will only set you back a dollar during happy hour (black label) or two if it's not. The place is large but the amount of people who flux in on the busy nights can make the place feel claustrophobic. That said, it's still a good local spot for people in the williamsburg proper.",4.0

"so, i do this thing. i do this thing where i leave my house with a book, usually a long one. then i go to a bar and read my book.the levee is a good book reading place during the day. there's sun coming in through the windows, if you go on a sunny day. there are plenty of people to watch rolling out of the beer garden across the street, if the book has bored me. and there are interesting people to talk to, if i have finished my book.i also like to stain my books with cheese ball dust. so the levee has that going for it too.",4.0
"I live about 3 blocks from The Levee and frequent it usually a couple nights a week. It's my default watering hole for my neighborhood. While I wouldn't fuck with the food (my buddy swears by the Frito Pie when he's broke) the drink list is quite spectacular. If you're trying to save cash, the Levee is the place to go. $16 will get you 4 shots of Evan Williams + 4 Carslings Black Labels, and still leave you with $4 for tips. Cheese balls are great, Jay Reatard / Torche on the Jukebox, Darts, and Jenga make this a 4 star spot.Bottom line: this is where I compare every other dive bar in Brooklyn to. If you can deal with hipsters you'll enjoy yourself here.",4.0

"Only hours after returning to New York from my holiday vacation, fresh faced and full of newly minted new year's resolutions, I went to the Levee.

(even though it didn't)-Kept pulling up my friends shirt to reveal her 8 tentacle tattoo that covers her entire back and stomach-Threw free cheese puffs at my friends-Made out with my gentleman companion in the middle of the bar-Ordered another frat boyOK, New Year's resolutions start now.",5.0
I came in here on a Tuesday evening for a quick drink with some friends for the first time and it was fun. Its a little dive bar right off of Bedford with very cheap drinks and nice bartenders. They have Lone Star beer and a shot of tequila for $5 and Budweiser and a shot of Jager for $5 as well. Most bars I've been to charge $6 minimum for a Jager shot alone so that deal can't be beat. I'm also pretty sure they had Black Label beer and a whiskey shot for $4. I love the shot and a beer drinking technique so I'll be coming back.,5.0

The few times I have gone there I have met people that were easy to talk to and pretty darn cool. The day bartender with the strawberry blonde hair is very sweet. It is nice in the daytime because they have windows in the front that let in light, but not too much light so the passers-by can see who the alcoholics are sitting there at noon. And at night, it is your favorite kind of dark, rock and roll bar with plenty of room and that ritzy-divey feel that is so very addictive.They are building construction across the street so they have my favorite kind of parking for the bike--scaffolding.",4.0

Scrabble, pinball machine, pool table, jenga, free twizzlers, a REAL jukebox.. and now they just opened up the patio. This is the bar I would open if I had the money.. and the one I still go to even after moving from Greenpoint to the asscrack of Brooklyn (1 hr train ride..)

And people just seem like they are trying too hard- like they spent two hours trying to look dirty. I've been to plenty of awesome bars flooded with these folk- me included, but they are, in fact dirty.

On a low-key night, indulge in Jenga, connect four, or Sorry! One of my favorite aspects of the Levee is the outdoor courtyard, complete with a wall-sized connect four board. It closes at 11 though, so get there early!",5.0
"A good dive bar. Pretty cheap drinks. They only take credit card for more than $15, which is annoying, but the bartender broke my $100 bill because that was the only cash I have, and that was really nice.",3.0
"This is a dive bar that I love (mostly because of the cheeseballs and twizzlers and sometimes blow pops at that bar) There's always weird, young hipsters to watch and the drinks a very cheap. I hardly ever go here for happy hour but its definitely a late night spot.",4.0
"Love this place and will definitely be coming back. A well drink is 5 or 6 bucks, but the pour is HEAVY. My Jack and ginger last night was probably like 80% whiskey. Not to mention awesome deals... a shot of whiskey and a PBR for FOUR DOLLARS?!?! Yes!!!",4.0
"This is a favorite spot in the Burg.  It's exactly one ""walking beer"" away from my house in distance.  The jukebox is excellent.  As many of my fellow Yelpers noticed, the free cheese balls, twizzlers, blow pops, and other candies are an exciting addition, and the small menu of snack items includes Frito Pie (even veg option) and PB&J.  They have great drink+shot combos like the Texas Two-Step (bottle of Lone Star beer and a shot of Tequila) or the Fratboy (bottle of Bud and a shot of Jager).  You can even bring your pooch!  On a memorable night at the Levee, the BF tried to walk in with no shirt on and they said, ""not in here partner"" but when he retorted with a ""it's my 30th birthday"" instead of kicking him out, they bought him a shot (not that he needed it, by any means).  This place rules!",4.0
"Aww man, this bar rocks!! First of all, I found out that they open at noon. Awesome for days you play hookie. Also they have a pretty rockin' jukebox, a pool table (tiny bar table, red felt), great beers, some noshes, booths in the back, art on the walls (probably local artists) and even free candy like Twizzlers and Blow Pops. The few times I have gone there I have met people that were easy to talk to and pretty darn cool. The day bartender with the strawberry blonde hair is very sweet. It is nice in the daytime because they have windows in the front that let in light, but not too much light so the passers-by can see who the alcoholics are sitting there at noon. And at night, it is your favorite kind of dark, rock and roll bar with plenty of room and that ritzy-divey feel that is so very addictive.They are building construction across the street so they have my favorite kind of parking for the bike--scaffolding.",4.0
"The Levee is great if you go at the right day/night. It has become increasingly more popular so can tend to get crowded, but if you're cool with that it's definitely still worth the trip. Why?Bar menu has options such as PB&J and Bologna & Cheese Sandwiches. Done.Beer menu has $3 Yuengling. And while you wait you can munch on free cheeseballs! Done and done.They have board games and video games such as Connect Four, Jenga, and the almighty Buck Hunter. Done, done, and done.It's right off the Bedford Ave. stop on the L.Get there. It's good times.",4.0
"I've been going here for the past four years... that alone should speak volumes. I've also dragged everyone I know here. It's hard to say if it's the cheese puffs or the fact that I can get a beer for a $1 during happy hour that keeps me coming back. let's not forget the PhotoHunt machine and the darts!! Scrabble, pinball machine, pool table, jenga, free twizzlers, a REAL jukebox.. and now they just opened up the patio. This is the bar I would open if I had the money.. and the one I still go to even after moving from Greenpoint to the asscrack of Brooklyn (1 hr train ride..) The clientele is hard to lump... i don't mind the hip kids as much as I mind the random bridge and tunnel teens that pop up every so often. But, still, THE BEST!",5.0
"The Levee really isn't that bad......in the afternoon. at night it is so crowded - no place to sit and a long line to the potty and the bartender. I don't really mind crowded so much, but the front of the bar is really narrow and the back doesn't have seats. I like to sit. And people just seem like they are trying too hard- like they spent two hours trying to look dirty. I've been to plenty of awesome bars flooded with these folk- me included, but they are, in fact dirty. I do like the specials, and their cute menu of kids lunch food, but once the flow of incoming ""im too cool for you"" people come in, i like to go out.",3.0
"Overall the levee is a fun place to drink, eat frito pie and play some Jenga or oversized connect four BUT the bartender they had working the early evening of July fourth was a real witch. Listen honey, i understand nobody wants to work on a holiday but that doesn't mean you have to be rude and dismissive of customers and have a crappy attitude. You would think all the shots of the ""it's like European jaegermeister"" you were downing would have mellowed you out a bit, but it did nothing to wipe that scowl off yr face. I still recommend the levee but only when the staff treats you like a human being",3.0

This is her neighborhood hangout bar and it was employee appreciation day so we decided to head over.Now let me preface this by saying that this is normally not the type of place I would go. I prefer more quiet, upscale places where I can sit & relax and talk over nicely crated cocktails. This, not that type of place but ALL of the bartenders were great, the drinks were SO cheap and the vibe was pretty cool. What eally pushed this from 4 to 5 stars for me was the employee appreciation day. Each bartender works a two hour shift on this day. At the end of the night all of the staff split the tips and all the sales for the entire day! How cool is that! The owner Susanne is super cool to.And before I forget, their bar menu is fantastic- super easy, yummy bar food-Ruffles and home made onion dip. Veggie hot dogs or meat hot dogs for two bugs!

"I was in nYC for a few days and I stayed with a girlfriend in Brooklyn. This is her neighborhood hangout bar and it was employee appreciation day so we decided to head over.Now let me preface this by saying that this is normally not the type of place I would go. I prefer more quiet, upscale places where I can sit & relax and talk over nicely crated cocktails. This, not that type of place but ALL of the bartenders were great, the drinks were SO cheap and the vibe was pretty cool. What eally pushed this from 4 to 5 stars for me was the employee appreciation day. Each bartender works a two hour shift on this day. At the end of the night all of the staff split the tips and all the sales for the entire day! How cool is that! The owner Susanne is super cool to.And before I forget, their bar menu is fantastic- super easy, yummy bar food-Ruffles and home made onion dip. Veggie hot dogs or meat hot dogs for two bugs! Grilled cheese, pb&j-they have got all the classics. i love me some ruffles with dip!",5.0
"I came here on a Saturday night. Maybe that was my mistake. I couldn't even move, let alone order a drink. Too reminiscient of my college days (yet with hipsters instead of college fratsters) so I bounced. Not worth sticking around for the free cheese puffs (they're what, $.60 a bag??). Maybe I'll come back during a weekday or something. They do have Big Buck Hunter (Safari!!) after all.",2.0
"One word: SPORTSMAN. $4 for a Carling Black Label (in a beer cozy, duh) and a shot of Evan Williams. There is just no way you can beat that. And if whiskey ain't your jam you've got the Fratboy (bottle of Bud & shot of Jager) or the Texas Two Step (bottle of Lone Star $ shot of tequila) for $5. I've made the mistake often of mixing all three in larger quantities in the same night, but separate and controlled they are good friends. The vibe in this bar is like no other. There's a few meatheads who wander in here and there but for the most part everyone's just friendly and there to get drunk and enjoy where they are. Killer jukebox (this is important to me) and the most divine frito pie in town. Grab a Sportsman, grab the Jenga and meet me at the big table by Buck Hunter.",5.0

"Love, love LOVE The Levee! I have had some amazing times there. For me this is the place to be in Williamsburg. By far one of favorite bars!

You really have to be aggressive and hold your ground, which I'm not always in the mood to do after a rough day.

A few months back when I was more of a regular it wasn't uncommon for my friends & I to end up at an after party near by.  The drinks are cheap and good.

"What can I say about this place really?!!  It is fucking bad ass.  Went here while on a trip from LA to NYC.  My friend from high school literally lives across the street from this place...so when I suggested we hang out since I haven't seen him in like 10 years, he suggested the Levee.  Man was that a great idea!  Williamsburg is like the hipster Mecca of NYC and as everyone who knows me knows I HATE HIPSTERS!!!  So I was skeptical at first, but the hipster count was tollerable.  THEY HAVE FUCKING COOZIES THAT THEY LET YOU USE FOR FREE!!!!  This is the coolest thing I've ever seen in my life in a bar.  A bar with coozies?!!!  I never thought such a place could exist!  The ""Sportsman"" is a local favorite.  He suggested a round of Sportsmen and we enjoyed them all night that night.  The Sportsman is a can of Carling Black Label which is Canadian beer I'd never even heard of and a shot of whiskey.  I'm sure that beer doesn't exist in Los Angeles.  They had High Life which is always a plus.  They have blow pops, board games, vegan friendly food and all kinds of snacks.  It's open til 4am.  There's pool tables, dart boards, video games and pinball.  There's a cool painting of a lighter on the the wall.  Quaint brick walls and feux tin ceilings.  The one frawback is that there is nowhere near enough seating.  The place was crowded probably due to the amount this place has to offer.  It was SUPER cheap!  And they have a HUGE beer selection.  You can get Sierra Nevada, Corona and Red Stripe for the same price as a Lone Star.  They have ton's of beer/shot combos.  Seriously check this place out if in NYC.  I spent 3 weeks in NYC and this was my favorite bar by far of all of them I went to in NYC.  Go there...you won't regret it I promise.",5.0
