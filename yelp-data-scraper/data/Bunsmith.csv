"Met my #friend here. He said it was the #1 Asian restaurant in Brooklyn according to Four Square or #Swarm. I was like ""never heard of it.""I walked in and it was #packed. The food was really good. Maybe it is the #1 Asian restaurant in #Brooklyn.",5.0
"Stopped in with a few friends after a long day of work followed by a few cocktails. It was a Monday evening so we were immediately seated and on our way to bun heaven though I didn't realize this at first. When my friend suggested that we stop in for a bite, my mouth began to water. I'll be honest,  I have a ridiculous thing going for Korean fried chicken (Yup I said it!). So I was quite disappointed to see that their menu didn't offer any standalone fried chicken options. However, they had no shortage of buns. We tried 2 different types of chicken buns and the kale salad. I was impressed. The kale salad had a great lemony zest. The prices were reasonable, atmosphere was inviting, service was appropriately attentive and the food tasted pretty good.  They did offer non-bun entree options, but with a name like Bunsmith, the buns tend to stand out more. If the buns are any indication of the taste of the entrees,  I'm sure that you won't be dissapointed. The next time a craving for buns kicks in, I'm heading back! *by the way they did offer the wings as an entree with other items, but just not as a standalone item.",4.0
"++- Bulgogi Bun (tongue with drool emoji)- Korean fried chicken bun (thumbs up, high five, and lady dancing emoji) +- Got the bowl equivalents; buns are better than bowls, just less filling (bowl  + sunglasses face emoji)- - No sticky fries (sad face with tear emoji)",3.0
"Came to Bunsmith for date night after walking the block and stumbling upon this place. PROS: The buns are really good. I had a pork jowl bun which I loved, and my boyfriend had the bulgogi bun which was also very good. Prices are super reasonable and on a Saturday night when everything was crowded, we got a table. I'm also hyper-aware of tables that are too close together (it's an annoying New York thing) and this place has them spaced out nicely. Didn't feel like I was on top of the couple next to us. CONS: I was really disappointed by their ""bites"" aka sharing plates. The sticky fries are literally just fast food French fries with a honey-like drizzle on them. The Korean fried chicken nuggets had the potential to be good, but were really bland. I piled on the dipping sauce. Maybe we picked the wrong things? Unclear. Their drink selection is pretty good. They have makkoli - a personal favorite - which is amazing. It can be really hard to find.",3.0
"A date took me here after raving about it, and after our experience, I get the hype!  We sat at the bar on a Saturday night, after the wait at a nearby spot was too long.  We ordered a few cocktails and a bunch of buns.  I was really excited to see sojo cocktails, as I hadn't had or seen any soju since my time in Seoul a few months prior.  My date and I tried the Lemon Fizz and soju Margherita.  I liked the Margherita a lot more than the Lemon fizz.  Now for the highlight, the buns!  I tasted the bulgogi, pork jowl and Korean fried chicken buns.  The pork jowl was simply amazing!  The fried chicken was delicious.  The bulgogi was surprising not that good.  My date said that wasn't typical, so perhaps it was an off-night.The atmosphere was super cute, perfect for a date, an outing with friends or even a solo venture at the bar.  I will definitely be back!",5.0
"Four words: Spam Cookie Butter Bun. I haven't had one bite make angels sing in my mouth in NYC in a very long time. I'm totally obsessed. It's the perfect mix of sweet and salty and it's definitely not for sharing. If your friends aren't gutsy enough to order it themselves, offer to finish it for them - do not offer a bite of yours cuz you'll never get it back! My other faves are the pork jowl, the Korean fried chicken and the shiitake tofu buns. All the bowls I've had are amazing as well. The only thing I've had that I didn't particularly like was the artichoke bun but I'm not a huge fan of artichokes to begin with.",5.0
"Stopped by for dinner after an afternoon at the nearby Brooklyn Museum. Good service and relaxed atmosphere at Bunsmith. I didn't love the soju margarita - I could not taste any alcohol. As for food, my favorite dish of the whole night was the calamari appetizer; it was just lightly fried with sweet peppers and jalapeños and bean sprouts. Also tasty were the sticky fries. As for the buns - our favorites were the spicy Korean fried chicken and the pork jowl. I was not a fan of the artichoke, which was nothing special and tasted mostly of mayo. My mother had the bulgogi bowl and really enjoyed it.",4.0
"I will start by addressing the service here--the people working here are among the friendliest I have encountered in a restaurant! I appreciate that when I asked for a new soda because the one I was given was flat, the server graciously swept the glass away and brought me a new (bigger) one within seconds like it was no big thing. I appreciate the easygoing way each server has described the flavors and their favorite picks on the menu. It seems like talking to friends. I LOVE that you don't wait long for your order to be served.On our first visit on New Year's Day, I had the bulgolgi bun, the spam and cookie butter bun, and the crispy Asian salad. Everything came out within minutes--my buns had generous heapings of toppings inside. The only gripe I have is that each bun is served in a tiny little bowl, so if your toppings fall out, it might hit the table, but I digress. The bulgolgi was perfect! The spam and cookie butter bun was an interesting flavor adventure. They fried the spam so it's crispy and hot, and the cookie butter was a nice play on flavor--but I think I could have done without the speculoos crumbled inside. The crispy Asian salad was just a bed of romaine and kale, with some wontons, almonds, and a tangy dressing drizzled on top--not really worth the $8, but a good enough side.On our second visit, I had the Korean fried chicken and another bulgolgi bun--Korean fried chicken is plenty for two people to share, way better than KFC, and great with the hot sauce. We also ordered the eel bowl...don't be fooled, it's enough to feed a family of four (or just one really hungry boyfriend).I like Bunsmith because it's a bite of flavor that I crave time to time, and it's cheap. My only lingering question is whether the menu rotates--if not, I'd wish to see more choices on the menu. Regardless, I'll be a repeat customer here!",4.0

"Honestly I was pretty disappointed in this place. Seen some great reviews. Passed by a few times. Was with a friend and decided to step in. Atmosphere is cool. Love the chalk mural of Biggie, Steve jobs and an Asian man on the wall (can't think of his name). Music was good. Cozy place was almost full. Service great. Sounds like a winning situation. Wrong. $9 for 4 wings with a minuscule amount of sauce. Even in the city I can get more wings than that for the price. Flavor was good and they had a really nice crispness that I loved. However they were a little on the cool side. Which was so weird to me. Maybe they were sitting waiting to be served. The Buns. With a name like Bunsmith. I was severely underwhelmed and unimpressed. Honestly everything was under seasoned. Lacked basic salt and pepper. The kfc was the worst of all. Unidentifiable cut of chicken. It was stringy, fatty and chewy. Yuck! Not to mention it lacked sauce, the only flavor component.  Must be a shortage on sauce tonight. The bulgogi was okay. For what's it worth the ribeye was tender. But extremely light/non existent flavor.  The pork belly was just okay as well. The pork had a nice crispness to it but again no flavor which is sad. I honestly couldn't believe it. It reminded me of the pork you get in the Chinese food takeout places. Yikes!The pork fat edamame was really bad. Love Edamame love pork. Match made in heaven? Not. The only essence of pork fat being involved with the edamame was the greasiness. Honestly the edamame was so greasy. After eating a few the normal way, I broke them open with my hands out of fear of excess fat intake overload. The ""pork fat"" added no flavor whatsoever. Again no salt, a little would've gone a long way. Maybe they were out for the night. Honestly the best thing on the menu was the Crisp Asian salad. We added tofu so it was a whopping $13. $5 up charge for tofu is a bit much. But clearly this place charges whatever they want. But honestly no complaints. Wontons and pines nuts added a nice touch. Lettuce was fresh and tofu had a nice crispness to it. Drinks were meh. I had the grapefruit soju cocktail. It tasted like juice. Since soju is basically pennies. I couldn't understand the $9 price tag. Waitress said there was vodka in it as well must've been very little. My friend had the lemon fizz soju cocktail. First off there was no fizz, no sparkling component to think of. She also said it tasted medicinal and artificial. I mean how hard is it to juice a real lemon for a cocktail. Overall great service. Very poor execution. I don't know if the chef was having an off night or if the individuals writing these 5 star reviews didn't eat at the same restaurant I did. I don't know. But honestly it left so much more to be desired.",2.0

Unfortunately they were out of the pork when we were there. We also got the fries with rice syrup. Fries were pretty good - crispy and piping hot, but not sure if I was a big fan of the syrup. My favorite was the Korean fried chicken bao - fried nicely and crispy, and flavorful. The bulgogi bao was decent too. However, was not a fan of the artichoke bao (and this is coming from a fan of artichoke) - just doesn't seem to fit in a bun scenario?Service was prompt, friendly, and attentive. There was a slight wait at 9PM on a Friday, but waited no more than 15 minutes. Would definitely be back again to try their other baos!",5.0

I'm used to having Pork Belly buns, so the Pork Jowl was a nice variation. Incredibly tender and fatty.

I got a korean fried chicken and an artichoke bun. For a total of $10, two sad looking buns with not a lot of stuff inside just feels like another pseudo hipster rip off.

"This is my go-to when I'm hungry and want sit-down service amidst old school hip hop and chalk portraits of Gandhi, Steve Jobs, and Biggie. Honestly, the buns are a bit expensive at $4 each but that is to be expected. Anything Korean fried chicken (or ""KFC"" on the menu) - just get it. Try all the buns. Get the eel bowl. Drink some soju. Bob your head to Pete Rock and CL Smooth. Leave full. Leave happy.",4.0
"Food Quality - 4 StarsFood Quantity - 2 StarsI walked in expecting a kimchi grill vibe, but it's actually more of a sit down restaurant with a full bar and a tiny menu. Think fancied up Baohaus but higher prices, lower quality and quantity. (If you've never been, which is likely for all these people leaving good reviews, please do.)All buns are $5 each, except for the grilled eel, which is $7. I got a korean fried chicken and an artichoke bun. For a total of $10, two sad looking buns with not a lot of stuff inside just feels like another pseudo hipster rip off. The redeeming feature was that both tasted pretty good, but unless they change portion size or lower prices, I'm not going back. Also, the place smells fishy, which may be a remnant of the prior tenant, but it sort of kills the vibe they've tried to create.",3.0

"Ordered pork jowl & Korean fried chicken buns and they were bomb!! However, the beef for the bulgolgi bowl was really dry and the rice was a little too sticky. This is definitely a restaurant I would want to come back to but I also hope to see improvements in these areas.",3.0
"Definitely a good place. I think they need to work some kinks out of their menu however. There is a huge disparity in the amount of food you get when ordering buns vs. bowls. The buns are TINY!!! I can eat them in about 2 bites. The bowls however are almost unfinishable because of how large they are, and they are quite expensive. All the food we ordered (2 buns and a bowl) was excellent, well spiced and fresh tasting. The roasted artichoke bun was the standout of our choices, it is delicious!! The fried chicken bun was fine, not great fried chicken but not bad either. The bowl was tasty, but again it was enormous!!! Their hot sauce isn't really that hot (maybe they've got something hotter in the back?), and they have a small but very good tap list (amazing Tank 7 Saison anyone?). I will definitely go back and next time will adjust my order. Good job Bunsmith!!",4.0

"We got the chicken wings and they were very eh. For $10 you get 4 very fried, very undersauced wings. 4 wings for $10 is ridiculous, and then you skimp on the sauce? No thanks. These wings are a cruel reminder that we do not live near Kyocho in Korea town. We also got a pork bun. You get 1 for $4. I was very underwhelmed. Also, some pieces of ""pork"" are actually pieces of pork fat. Gross. I bit into what I thought was a 1 inch long piece of meat, and the piece immediately disintegrated in my mouth because it was just fat. UghI also got the bulgogi bowl for $14. It is very standard. It comes with string carrots, string cucumber, and rice. It's not bad and I'd eat it if it's there, but I wouldn't personally pay $14 again. In sum, this place is way too overpriced for what it is. It prices items as though it's in Manhattan, but it definitely fails to live up to much better Korean places in the city. The service was excellent however.",3.0
"The food is freaking phenomenal but the portions are small and pricey, hence the three stars.The buns are delicious (I've had the vegetarian ones) but they are tiny. I've had bigger ones in Korea town for much cheaper. My favorite is the tofu and shitake bun.The rice bowls are great (again the food is amazing) but it's small and hard to justify the price.Each bun is  $4-$5 and each rice bowl about $14-$17. I eat a lot, especially as a vegetarian and one rice bowl and one bun was not enough to fill me up. I've only gotten take out, but the decor is nice and staff are pretty friendly. They seem to have a great drink menu as well.If the food was slightly bigger portions (especially the rice bowl) I'd definitely eat here more often. It really is freaking delicious food, but $15 for a rice bowl that won't fill me up is a tough sell.",3.0
"Tried both KFC buns -- BOMB. The spicy one is better.Pork jowl bun and fries, good too. The music was on point too: 80/90's hip hop and RnB.

"Love the $4 bulgogi steamed buns, juicy and they don't skimp on the filling. My partner ordered the soy garlic bun and both taste and presentation were on point.

"I'm going to start this review in Spanish because I love Korean food so much, it makes me speak other languages. Mira, sabes que? Bunsmith esta la puneta! Seriously, I would move to S. Korea and marry the first Korean man I saw if he would take me to get samgyeopsal, ttukbegi and kimchi chigae. I used to ask the owners of the Pine Tree bodega if they could get more Korean food - the owner asked me if I was half Korean (I amen not). So you can imagine how excited I was for this place to open steps from my apartment! I love the pork cheek buns ($4) kind of a meld of Korean and Chinese. I like the bulgogi dish that's like bibimbap but mine didn't have the soft egg and enough gochujang, which I think is crucial; but what do I know, I'm a waeguk-saram.Also they serve Hite, which is one of the few beers I like, and they have soju cocktails!

"I live in the neighborhood and came here for dinner with my husband. We weren't planning on having dinner, but we wanted to check out this new place. We both ordered the Korean Fried chicken on a bun...and then we ordered it again! It was delicious, small, but quite filling. I was full after 1, but had to go for the second. We have a new neighborhood spot to visit. I can't wait to go back and try more of the menu.",5.0
"Not going to lie, it's a bit pricey .. Buns should be $4 max not $5 and bowls $12 not $15 BUT on the flip side the food is amazing and very authentic in flavor! The kimchi is some of the best I've had in the city. I'm Korean and have been eating the stuff my whole life and can promise the kimchi here is legit. The fried chicken was crispy on the outside and soft and juicy in the inside. The sweet and spicy sauce was amazing. Definitely will come back and just gotta hope they start lowering the prices! But either way it's worth it . Ps - the service was great as well!",5.0
"This was well worth a diet cheat night! So I had one pork, one KFC and one bulgogi bun. They are small but 3 is filling enough for your average gal. I could've eaten another though because they are delicious! Not sure how long they've been in the neighborhood but man I love a bao so my tummy is happy they're here. I will definitely go back. The drinks looked delish but I got takeout so I'll have to go back and try one.",4.0
"This is one of the best kept secrets in Brooklyn... We came in & it was busy on a Monday night (good sign). We had a bowl and two buns. Everything we had was creative and exquisite so my guess is everything here is great. Nice little selection of canned IPA beers as well :)We just moved here from Tokyo where Asian, fusion food culture is quite advanced compared to most of the  New York fare I have had. If I visit more places like this I'm going have to reassess that...This is one of the best meals I've had since I've been here! Ingredients, preparation & no bullshit attitude of this place makes it perfect for Brooklyn!I highly suggest the tofu and shiitake bun.",5.0
"Pretty solid, but on the pricier end to fill yourself up.  I ended up getting three buns: the fried chicken, pork belly, and bulgogi.  The bulgogi was the weakest out of the bunch -- it's one of my favorite dishes in general, and their version was lacking a bit of flavor.  I also got their pickled beets as a side, which were great.  There were only a few other people while I was there, so don't know how they do when they're busy, but service for me was attentive.  Their Yelp offer had just expired the day before, but the waitress was nice and went and asked the manager if I could use it anyways.  (I couldn't, but I appreciated her checking.)",4.0
"So this was my first Bun experience and I'm hooked! The soft, doughy bun was a perfect compliment to the magical array of flavor explosion that ensued after the first bite. I tried the artichoke aioli and sweet/sour fried chicken buns and I can't wait to go back for more! I also highly recommend the fries.. they are similar in shape and flavor to McDonalds (the only thing McDee's does right in my opinion) but with the sweetness of a thick, almost honey-like sauce and the homemade hot sauce, you really can't go wrong. The prices are a little steep for the quantity, but for the flavor, its worth it!",5.0
"As far as buns go, Not the typical bun.  And truth be told, buns leave little margin for error.  And while that may seem a superfluous comment... actually it is.  Anyhow,  This one takes an innovative turn towards the Open Bun.  It is a light And fluffy texture that never let's you down.  Artichoke bun is delicious",4.0
"There simply isn't another place like it. By far my favorite bar in Brooklyn, maybe even all of New York City. The fried chicken is unreal, the service is perfect and the sake flows smoothly. A bunch of us met here and was planning on going out around town all night. Instead, we stayed at Bunsmith for 7 hours straight. It felt like 10 minutes.",5.0

"I went to Bunsmith on their first opening week with group of my friends. We tried all of the buns including Korean BBQ beef, grilled eel, pork belly with Kimchi and two types of KFCs.  The portions were generous and ingredients were fresh and high quality.  Everything was amazing and my favorite was spicy chicken.  The price is compatible with Chuko and Momofuku.  This is a great addition to Crown Heights! We will be back!!!",5.0
"Really excellent bites here! We tried both kinds of KFC buns (love the name) spicy and soy ginger, as well as the grilled artichoke and pork belly buns. All delicious washed down with some kimchi and french fries. A great bar space and super friendly waitstaff. Writing the review makes me want some more. Next time, the grilled eel.",4.0

"This is not a place you can easily find in Crown Heights.  Very Trendy Korean joint!  First when I walked in, I noticed this very cool doctor and nice vibe.  There was a family with a baby sitting at a table to my left, and some young people enjoying drinks at a bar on the other side.  I immediately thought, ""What a cool place!"".  We started with artichoke bun. It was so simple and amazingly delicious.  then, went onto KFC chicken and Pork jowl which was rich and flavorful.  I also ordered Grapefruit soju cocktail which was nice and strong and went well with my buns.  They offer various soju cocktail drinks and very interesting selection of beer.  Every table gets a bottle of tap water and a small bottle of hot sauce (that you can squeeze).  So you can spice up your bun to your liking.  It was just perfect.The staff is also attentive, friendly and professional.  They made sure that we were comfortable and got what we needed.  Great service!I can't wait to go back there again to try something new :)",5.0

"Loved this little restaurant!! Glassware is identical to what you'd actually get in Korea, authentic soju ads in the bathroom and AMAZING buns. We each ordered two and had to get a second order of the artichoke bun. Definitely a meal I will be dreaming about :-)",5.0
"Food was good, but just good. The buns were not as fluffy as other steam buns I've had. What really irritates me is that the steam buns that are drawn on their chalk mural at the front of the restaurant are such false advertisement. The steam buns don't resemble the mural at all! Kind of wish the buns had lettuce in them. Eel bun was kinda dry. The pork belly bun was only a small piece of belly fat. The pork belly bowl only came with 2 small pieces of mostly fat pork and mostly rice. Feeling really unsatisfied. I thought this would be a great Korean place in the hood, but I'm pretty disappointed. Too overpriced, does not match the quality of food I expected, but because it's the only Korean place on Franklin they can get away with the prices. But I don't think it was worth the price.",2.0
Love this place! Second time in a week we have gone. All the Buns are excellent. Fries have a great twist. Awesome atmosphere.,5.0
Service was weird. Waitress sounded like robot repeating the specials and options and she will definitely guilt you into more food. Friend and I came in last night after our actual dinner because we wanted to try a few buns that bad. We told her we were excited but she on the other hand was not excited we only ordered 2 buns. She got a 15% tip instead of 100%.,2.0

oh the pork buns! and the edamame with pork fat! i tried four buns and was not disappointed. everything was so delicious that we had to order more buns... FOUR MORE BUNS!,5.0
Absolutely delicious. Delicious buns with extremely flavorful toppings. The pork one was especially good! The artichoke wasn't as mind-blowing as other reviews would suggest...but the aioli on it was. The kimchi and pickled daikon sides are also great. Highly recommended!,5.0
This place is exactly what this neighborhood needed and I am so psyched about it! I've had the eel bowl and the tofu shitake bun and both were incredible. I also am really into the sake-in-a-can which is a new thing in solid asian restaurants and the red sake is delicious. I've been here 2 Sunday nights in a row and I am excited to have it as a great neighborhood spot.,5.0
