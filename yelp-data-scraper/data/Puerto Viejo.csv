"This place. So much live for the delicious food, the great drinks, and the kind waiters.First, it's important to note that this place is cash only. That can be tough but the prices are so reasonable, it's not hard to make $20 go a long way here. Sadly both times I've been, I have just missed the happy hours specials, but even the regular prices are extremely reasonable.To start, the berry sangria ($8) is a great buy. Sweet, tangy, and delicious you'll keep wanting more. I promise you. They also have a red and a white sangria, several wine options, and a small beer list. All pretty affordable.When you order food you get fried plantains with an insanely delicious garlic sauce. I could bathe in that sauce. Incredible. The empanadas ($2) are fantastic. I've tried the chicken and will definitely go back to give the beef a chance (they also have cheese for vegetarian types!). The biggest pleasant surprise here was the burger ($9). The meat is phenomenal, the coleslaw sweet and tangy and the yuka fries are deliciously addictive. Definitely check Puerto Viejo out for a drink, appetizers or for dinner. Awesome spot in the Crown Heights/Prospect Heights area.",5.0
"This place is really tiny, but oh so delicious! If you're a fan of Dominican cuisine you should definitely give this place a chance. Full of music and flavor, you're getting your money's worth. Just make sure you bring cash, because it's cash only!I do have one small complaint and its just going to bug me if I don't mention it. I did find a hair in my food. Yeah, yuck but other than that its awesome.",4.0
"This place rocked. The food was great, atmosphere was comfortable..... the people were great and we had a really nice evening. I recommend the cheese empanadas, and the shrimp was great.  Bring cash.... no plastic.",4.0
"This place is a great find! Empanadas, Pastel en Hoja, Pastelon, and Sangria are delicious and fresh. Not that much a fan of the churasco which is what I initially went for. I felt it was missing some flavor. The host/waitress is sweet, attentive, and professional. Bartender was a little tense ... Would go again.",4.0
Liked it so much I went twice IN ONE NIGHT. I have a friend that frequents this spot pretty often and she finally talked me into stopping in because I was in Brooklyn one night.  She described it as a small family owned Dominican  restaurant that only takes cash.  I pretty much had painted a mental picture in my head of what this spot would be like.  The outside had this rustic but warm decor that was inviting.  It is not a large establishment and not a place I would bring large groups of people unexpectedly.  The bar seats about 5 or 6 people comfortably.  The decor inside was absolutely amazing and I was informed by the staff it is all pretty much original.   I ordered the red sangria since it was on happy hour for only $5 bucks and I ordered Pollo a la Parrilla.  To start they brought out some fried plantain chips that had this amazing garlic butter dipping sauce.  The sauce was a great compliment to the chips.  The sandwich was seasoned perfectly and the watercress was a great addition to the sandwich.  The sangria was great and tasted very fresh and not watered down like some establishments.Pureto Viejo completely over exceeded my expectations and the staff was extremely helpful and kind and I WILL BE RETURNING SOON.,5.0
"This is a small restaurant serving up some of the best Dominican food. They start you off with some free plantain chips with a garlic dip. The chips were just perfect. I had: Bacalaitos ($5), which is salt cod fritters drizzled with a homemade sauce. There were two pieces. It's slightly chewy, but you can taste the cod and the sauce compliments well with the fritters.Pollo Guisado ($10), which is chicken stew served with white rice and red beans. I felt the chicken could've been more flavorful. It just taste like chicken with some light seasoning, but it was still good and hearty. The rice and beans were great.Yuca Frita ($3), which is fried yuca. Yuca tastes similar to potatoes, so if you like French fries, definitely order this. For the price the portion is pretty good. Maduros ($3), which is sweet plantains. Plantains are similar to a banana, this is a must order for me, because I love sweet plantains. Although it's sweet, it goes well with the savory items we ordered.Flan ($5), which is like a pudding custard type of dessert. They have coconut or the traditional flavor. We went with the traditional flavor. It was very tasty and perfect to end the meal.The food was wonderful and the price is amazingly inexpensive for dinner. BTW, it is CASH ONLY.",4.0
"A few months ago I made the mistake of letting my best friend taste my sister's cooking and he hasn't stopped bugging me about pastelon since. But my sister lives in the suburbs now so I knew I had to find something to tide him over, otherwise I would have to buy a lifetime supply of duct tape to shut him up. 'Cause it's not like I don't have enough little sister inferiority complex problems ya know!? It took some time and serious research (one does not mess around when it comes to pastelon). I settled on Puerto Viejo because like I said, good food can not be kept under wraps, and certain island foods can not be kept secret. One of those things: PASTELES! THEY HAVE PASTELES! IN THE LEAF! It's a regular menu item! Pastelon AND pasteles! Everybody knows, no one makes pasteles like your great-grandmother does. Luckily, someone's great-grandmother is in the back 'cause this one was awwwwesome. I had the chicken one and was so giddy when it came out, that just like when I was a kid I made a mess while opening it. I remembered why my mom always insisted on opening mine as a kid; I was always so excited I would forget to put a napkin down and would inevitably spill water or grease all over myself as I opened it. Yup....some things never change! Don't care... it was just like I remember my great-grandmother's and I was in heaven. Now every day can be Navidades! Happy day! Happy day!The pastelon was juicy and sweet. I like mine a little sweeter, but this is the age old debate about pastelon so one can not be harsh about these things. My friend was satisfied and felt it was an adequate replacement for my sister's, so I will now get some peace! We also ordered the mofongo. I don't even like mofongo and I liked this one. Ironically, my friend liked the mofongo more than the pastelon! He's so fickle! But then again, it was all so delicious how can you blame him for loving great food. I hear the churrasco is awesome, and as a churrasco fiend I will most certainly be back to try it along with the sangria that was also recommended. Sounds like a perfect happy hour to me! The service was really great too, and the food being so fantastic and reminiscent of happy days spent in my great-grandmother's kitchen high in the mountains of PR, not only will I be back, I'm bringing a lot of friends too!",5.0
"Delicious food with a friendly staff.The picadera appetizer platter ($18) has a good variety and will feed 4 people. Lots of delicious fried food, beef, sausage, and other goodies. We shared a bunch of dishes and I liked the pernil the most. But try to get it with yellow rice instead of the yuca that it comes with. The mains range from $9-$14, so very budget friendly. The oxtail and fried chicken with the bone were misses for me though. I also had an Arnold Palmer which was very sweet. I had to add water to it and it was still super sweet. Not particularly a bad thing, just took me by surprise. We also didn't like the maduro and yuca fries sides. A few other minor cons - the restaurant is a bit small, if it's cold, there will be a gust of cold air when the door opens, they don't seat incomplete parties, and it's cash only.But definitely worth a visit for the appetizer platter and pernil with yellow rice!",4.0
"tight squeeze for the large group that we had for NYE but they were more than accommodating and the food was fantastic!A very home-y feel to the place, the people and the food which I think is what really got me to like the place.And while it did take a while for us to get seated and for the food to come out, I did not mind it at all with the atmosphere (and of the course the ridiculously large crowd we brought in.)Would love to try this place again with a smaller group one day!",4.0

"This place is the real deal. While there are quite a few Spanish style restaurants in my neighborhood, Flatbush, none compare to Puerto Viejo.  I will gladly take the 15 minute drive to Prospect Heights/Crown Heights for some authentic Dominican food. I've gone for both takeout and eat in and service is pretty good. Food is good, love the empanadas as well as the fried chicken chunks.  Had the beef stew as well, was a little overcooked.  The spot is frequented by a lot of gentrifiers, and all you old-school Crown Heights people will know who I'm talking about.  Prices are good, however it's cash only.  No hard alcohol, just wine and sangria. Definitely a good option for authenticity.",4.0
"I love Puerto Viejo for so many reasons: THE FOOD/DRINKS-Omg, the Chimi Burger. I ordered it for the first time this past weekend after a climbing sesh and inhaled it like a madwoman. It comes with tomato, onion, and a Dominican slaw on top, and yuca fries on the side. I have a mad craving for another one!-Mofongo al Pilon. This is what I normally order here. It's mashed green plantains mixed with either chicken, pork or veggies. It's served as a ball with a thing of sauce. I like to destroy that ball ASAP and mix the sauce all up in the plantain mash. So delicious and filling!-Sangria is solid: perfect combo of wine and fruit. -Wine options are on point. Highly recommend the malbec. THE LOCATION-It's in a rando corner surrounded by warehouses and car mechanics, which happens to be just a couple blocks from my apartment. It's slim pickins in my immediate vicinity, so I LOVE that Puerto Viejo is here if I need some delicious food in a pinch without venturing out too far.THE SERVICE-Super chill, welcoming, friendly servers. I strolled in at like 10:45pm on Saturday night knowing that the kitchen was closing at 11pm. I fully expected them to scoff for wanting food so late, but instead I was welcomed with a smile and menu, sans warning. THE AMBIANCE-Dimly lit and intimate. There's a long, narrow table in the middle with stools, surrounded by a few tables and a full bar. I haven't taken a good look at the decor, but for some reason I get the feeling I'm in a pirate ship. On Saturday night they were playing Latin music. During the week it's a bit more chill. Highly recommended!",4.0

"Heard about this place but haven't been until recently for lunch. Felt displaced at first with all the garages nearby but the feeling of ""desertedness"" adds to the charm.

We found the service good & friendly but then again the place was half empty when we went during lunch. Their berry sangria and the monir sorando were delicious and strong. The empanadas.... I mean that's what an empanada should look and taste like. Beef was better than the chicken, and they were so inexpensive!! We had the Pernil Mofongo and Bistec Encebollado with a side of rice and sweet plantains. The garlic sauce accompany the plantains was on point. Our dishes arrived promptly and were both delicious. I preferred the bistec over the mofongo, which could have had better flavor. Good portion sizes without being gargantuesque (too bad if you are super hungry).

Sandwiches were filled with juicy cuts of meats and cheese.Great for sharing!The slow roasted pork (pernil) severed with a crispy piece of the roasted pig skin on top was amazing.

"Found this restaurant because of the review of the day, otherwise I don't think I would have ever known it was there, it's on a pretty secluded area, we drove there from Park Slope and found parking right away, we were actually surprised that this nice restaurant was actually on the block it was on. The hostess was nice and gave us several options on where to sit, the tables are very small! Actually the place is very small, and since we knew we were going to pig out, we needed a bigger table, so we opted to sit at the high table in the middle, with hopes no one sat next to us, which thankfully they didn't. The waitress (Cynthia) came right away and took out drink orders, we decided to get some white sangrias which were very good. For appetizer we had the sampler platter, which was sausage (I loved them!) fried cheese (also very good) my husbands favorite (fried chicken) beef, and tostones. We also ordered the  bacalaitos, which were good, but way to chewy, but the flavor was delicious, we weren't able to finish them because I felt like I was never going to be able to swallow them. For entree I ordered the churassco, yellow rice & red beans, everything was good. My husband got the pork chops, I tasted them & they were very good. As full as we were I still ordered a flan to share, they had regular & coconut, we went with the regular, and wasn't disappointed. The service was great, and so was the food, thanks to review of the day (yesterday) if it wasn't for that I would have never discovered this hidden treasure.",5.0

The oxtail was nice and tender and just so yummy.I was less impressed with the tres leche cake that we ordered for dessert. The piece was rather small for $5 and the cake was too dense for my liking and I didn't really taste the condensed milk.

We came at 1 in the afternoon, and it was still like a Latin party- Wooden decor gives a nice rustic feel- Morir Sonado was probably the best drink I've had in 2015...I'm sure the alcoholic version is even better++- The wife liked the berry sangria, altho I thought it a little strong, which is good if you're trying to get crunk- Homemade empanadas were quite delish+- Altho it was tasty, given all the other positives, I expected more from the bistec and mofongo dishes.

"Went here for lunch on a Saturday. It was wonderful and I am looking forward to going back. - the atmosphere is really nice, with the restaurant design very simple and rustic, and according to my Dominican boyfriend, very authentically representing Dominican Republic and its culture- including the furniture. - the music was great- the service was fast- our food and drinks came out really quickly, and our waiter was very attentive. - the food was fantastic (most important part). My mom has mofongo, I had chicharrones de cerdo and my bf had the chuleta. Everything was amazing. The maduros were also perfectly cooked. idk, I have nothing bad to say about this place. It was great. I only wish I lived closer.",4.0
"Went there on a Friday night. The place is a bit small and tight but they make it work. It was cozy and had a  mellow vibe.  The restaurant takes traditional Dominican food and makes it more upscale.  The food was great.  Empanadas with cheese were delicious.  With chicken -ok. The pernil was yummy.  The pastelon which is meat,  cheese,  and plantain layered- was excellent.  The side salad was a real treat- perfect really.  Try the tres leches cake.  Small but moist and tasty.  I didn't like that they had us pay for our meal before it arrived.  I thought that was in bad taste and awkward.  They did explain that they needed to close out our tab because we had been seated at the bar first and transitioned to a table. That tab included our food order which we placed at the bar. We were encouraged to place our full order at the bar. I 've had many situations where we have moved and never had to pay first.",3.0

Coworkers and I came her for a quick drink while we waited for another location to open up. We each ordered a berry sangria (yummy!) and chicken and beef empanadas. The empanadas were on the dry side but the sauces to accompany them were tasty. It loses a star for being cash only and another star for the dry empanadas. Will I visit again? Yes. Just have to remember to carry cash. And I will make sure to order from their menu for a sit down meal,3.0
Very good food the mofongo was amazing and so was the flan. The rice was tasty but being puertorican you become a bit of a snob when comparing arroz con gandules. Overall a good spot would definitely visit again!,4.0

"Oxtail - more bone than tail - and the chicken - from the freezer to the microwave! Another pretentious ""bistro"" that believes they're actually selling Latin food? Question mark because I still can't believe it. And the hype around this place is ridic!!!Their oxtail is literally - LITERALLY, six bones with barely any bit of meat on it  and straight up tomato sauce from THE CAN !! 16$$$!!! WTF!! Lol Did anybody see that pic of that sad little piece of fish with the fake ass fine dining sauce around it?? That pic reflects everything that's wrong with this place.",1.0
Very good Cuban sandwich.  This place used to be a rice and beans pernil slinging no frills Spanish restaurant. It's now the same thing a little dolled up and sucking up that hipster money. Hey why not? Still good to go for Spanish meals.,4.0
"My boyfriend came across this spot for breakfast one morning and would not shut up about it so he decided to take me for brunch. We were mainly excited to order the grits along with some bacon, sausage, eggs, and toast. Nothing to write home about but it was definitely delicious.

For the mains we got chicharrones de pollo (AMAZING crispy chicken pieces on the bone; really fantastic) and camarones al ajillo (shrimps in what was described as a garlic/white wine sauce but tasted very sea foody; good but a bit unexpected based on the description).

There were 3 empty tables, and the rude hostess was insistent on seating us at the long high top communal table. When I asked if we could use any of the empty tables that I doubted would be occupied in 20 min she refused. I sent my husband to ask the owner and she got even nastier - speaking to the waiters about us! The owner seemed hesitant to get involved, and wasn't much help.  She told me I am the hostess and you cannot sit there.After we finally sat at a table, she continued complaining about us - gesturing towards us. so unprofessional. definitely pur LAST time here.

"Two visits space very far apart and I can tell they've got their act together. Super consecutive. Good was equally delicious as my first bust.

Overall I'd say this is a must try however far you are if your not in the mood to cook yourself.Recommended-steak and onions or the sancocho. Definitely drizzle the spicy heaven on the table in your meal.Cons-they do not drain their fried food properly or at all. I'm use to it from home meals by id like a restaurant to be better and know better. And they are (both visits) slow to bring/take the check. It's  pretty hilarious the amount they charge but as I mentioned above beggars can't be choosers.

We sample all three, and they were all very good.I had the burger, which is the main reason this review is only 3 stars. Put simply, the burger was bad. I asked for it medium-rare, and it came out well done, totally dried out. But the worst offense was the fact that they had compressed the beef as much as humanly possible. A good burger is made with a light touch, delicately working the beef into a loosely formed patty.

"I'll be completely honest: before strolling into Puerto Viejo early one Sunday morning, I had absolutely no idea what to expect from a restaurant advertised as serving Dominican Cuisine. It's simply not something I've experienced before. That being the case, I was so absolutely thrilled at how blown away I was by the service, atmosphere, food and prices at Puerto Viejo. Next to Mile End, this is my favorite spot in Brooklyn hands down. Star 1: How was the service and atmosphere?From the second we started joking with our server about how often Puerto Viejo has been changing their menu I knew I was in for a treat, and the service really did end up making my experience at Puerto Viejo all the better. Combined with a more than comfortable atmosphere, this is a perfect spot for a weekend morning. Star Granted. Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?Amazing prices without a doubt. This sandwich? $9 - yelp.com/user_local_phot…These home fries? $4 -yelp.com/user_local_phot…Magical. As for the menu? Simple, yet it absolutely works. Trying to be a jack of all trades is tough especially within a cuisine that isn't quite defined. With this newest rendition, Puerto Viejo does a fantastic job. Star Granted. Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?Absolutely fantastic. Not only were the hash browns life changing (the seasoning! so good!), but the sandwich had everything I could have ever wanted. Fresh bread, gooey cheese, meats cooked to perfection, and a mustard that brought everything together perfectly. Kudos Puerto Viejo. This was brilliant. Dual Stars Granted. Star 5: Would you eat here every day if you could?What else can I say? I loved absolutely everything about my experience at Puerto Viejo. I'll be back. Star Granted.",5.0
"Do it. Great place to take friends or a casual date. Nice and cozy decor, relaxed vibe, tasty food, and surprisingly inexpensive considering the portion sizes. If you live in the area (as I do), this will definitely be one of your go-to neighborhood spots. I recommend the chicken empanadas as an appetizer. Great flavor, nice size, and only $2! As far as the rest of the menu, I've eaten here on several occasions and ordered something different each time...I've yet to be disappointed :)",5.0

First time in this area. Accidentally find this great Dominican restaurant! Lunch special starts from $6 and happy hours sangria is $5. We are satisfy with the food and atmosphere. yummmmmy! Reminder: Cash Only,5.0

"I'll be completely honest: before strolling into Puerto Viejo early one Sunday morning, I had absolutely no idea what to expect from a restaurant advertised as serving Dominican Cuisine. It's simply not something I've experienced before. That being the case, I was so absolutely thrilled at how blown away I was by the service, atmosphere, food and prices at Puerto Viejo. Next to Mile End, this is my favorite spot in Brooklyn hands down. Star 1: How was the service and atmosphere?From the second we started joking with our server about how often Puerto Viejo has been changing their menu I knew I was in for a treat, and the service really did end up making my experience at Puerto Viejo all the better. Combined with a more than comfortable atmosphere, this is a perfect spot for a weekend morning. Star Granted. Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?Amazing prices without a doubt. This sandwich? $9 - yelp.com/user_local_phot…These home fries? $4 -yelp.com/user_local_phot…Magical. As for the menu? Simple, yet it absolutely works. Trying to be a jack of all trades is tough especially within a cuisine that isn't quite defined. With this newest rendition, Puerto Viejo does a fantastic job. Star Granted. Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?Absolutely fantastic. Not only were the hash browns life changing (the seasoning! so good!), but the sandwich had everything I could have ever wanted. Fresh bread, gooey cheese, meats cooked to perfection, and a mustard that brought everything together perfectly. Kudos Puerto Viejo. This was brilliant. Dual Stars Granted. Star 5: Would you eat here every day if you could?What else can I say? I loved absolutely everything about my experience at Puerto Viejo. I'll be back. Star Granted.",5.0
"Do it. Great place to take friends or a casual date. Nice and cozy decor, relaxed vibe, tasty food, and surprisingly inexpensive considering the portion sizes. If you live in the area (as I do), this will definitely be one of your go-to neighborhood spots. I recommend the chicken empanadas as an appetizer. Great flavor, nice size, and only $2! As far as the rest of the menu, I've eaten here on several occasions and ordered something different each time...I've yet to be disappointed :)",5.0

"Ordered Puerto Viejo off Try Caviar, and had a very good experience.  I was quoted 50-80 minutes and the food arrived within an hour.  For food, I ordered the chicken sandwich, fish sandwich, and side salad.  The sandwiches were warm and very good - I was too full to eat the salad, but the ingredients looked fresh and the side of avocados were drizzled with some very good olive oil.",4.0
SO YUM. Sweetest staff. Get the roast pork.,5.0
"After entering through the heavy black steel door I felt like I was instantly transported to another place.  The decor takes you immediately into an island feel where every piece in the restaurant appears to be a repurposed item from a scarp yard neatly repainted and well selected to furnish the entire restaurant.  An old desk turned into a table, a broken in looking bar counter top and dim hanging lamps.  A very island feel to everything with some music bumping in the background. We were quickly seated for brunch / breakfast and ordered fresh squeezed orange juice with a deep orange color to it; remarkably fresh.  A perfectly ripe avocado with a dash of olive oil across it; munster cheese and bacon over smashed plantains, delicious Dominican comfort food.  The sunny side eggs were perfectly cooked any not one bite was left on the table.The only issue was that the service and server was fine but the food took forever to come out of the kitchen.  Our orders weren't too complex so I'm not sure what happened.  I would definitely go back for dinner.",4.0
"I'm a fan, especially of their happy-hour empanadas and sangria! Their homemade hot-sauce is unbelievable!! (they should seriously consider selling it). Ah yes, and their flan is very very good. I did visit for brunch, but as someone who is not into the brunch scene- it didn't really do much for me. They do have a brunch salad that is amazingly fresh and delicious though. Small, cozy, friendly, and great music- definitely check them out on weeknights for a fun few hours and yummy bites.",3.0

"Real delicious, friendly service, hip artsy decor,with the coolest bathroom in Brooklyn. I had an ice cold Presidente,with a Dominican dish called Pastelon.  The food here is not like your typical Dominican restaurants, so do not come in here expecting mounds of white rice and beans. Nope,this place is definitely gourmet and the portions are for the health conscious. I love the pastelon,it contained lots of beef, and the sweet plantains were smothered in cheese,divine. The plate had a very fresh and well dressed salad. I love the salad with the pastelon,what a great combo. By the way, don't forget the desert, coconut flan,yummy joy for the tummy. My only cons for Puerto Viejo are the following,one the music,and secondly the size of the place. Playing a little bit of Spanish music doesn't hurt nobody. As a Dominican American, I am not saying play Omega or Mozart La Para, but classy merengue,salsa or guaracha. Clubhouse beats are cool, but the above mentioned keeps it authentic.  The space is cozy,but some of the table layouts are bit problematic. I had to move away from the other tables to put my coat on, so that I wouldn't hit the patrons on the side of their heads.With that being said, Puerto Viejo is cool,fast,impressive gourmet style Dominican food. I recommended for dates,and groups. Thank you Puerto Viejo.",4.0

"Came here for Caribbean restaurant week with some colleagues. It was pouring getting here and very humid. When we enter Puerto Viejo, the hosts gives us paper towels to dry off, and the bartender gives us glasses of water. We were a larger group, and told us it would be a few minutes for our table. The overall staff were really great.The ambiance of Puerto Viejo is very interesting. It's a mix of modern, classical and tropical. The design on the walls and ceiling will catch your attention. Since we came during happy hour, the empanadas were $1 each (they are usually 2 each). These are some of the best empanadas I've ever had! They were not too big, not too oil and not too crispy. Sometimes when you eat empanadas, it just breaks apart, but this did not happen. The mayo ketchup complimented the empandads really well.After the empanadas arrived, we obtained complimentary plantain chips for the table. The chips were okay. The sauce that came with it was good. For dinner, I ordered the mofongo with pork, and a side order of yucas fritas, fried cassava (yuca). This was the first time having mofongo. Looks can be deceiving when eating mofongo. It looks kind of small, but it is dense and heavy. Mofongo is smashed plantains filled with some type of filling in this case pork. It is very starchy and fulling. I could only eat half of it. You can definitely taste the plantain. A sauce compliments the mofongo because it is very dry. I don't know if it comes with a sauce at other places, but it definitely needed it. It was a good taste, but it's not something I would get often. The yucas fritas was great, however, I did not like the dipping sauce it came with. I would have preferred the mayo ketchup.  My favorite condiment at Puerto Viejo is the hot sauce on the table. It has a great, spicy taste to it.

"My girlfriend and I walked by this place one night and she thought it was so charming on the outside that we would have to come back for lunch the next day.  And it was great!  The food was delicious, the staff helpful and pleasant, and the interior cultivated a friendly, comfortable atmosphere.Tripe soup:  I just had to order the beef tripe soup, based on other Yelpers' reviews.  It was good, and my favorite part of it was the broth, which was very rich and wholesome tasting.  The carrots and potatoes in the soup soaked up the sauce, and I liked those too.  I appreciated the actual tripe for what it was, but didn't eat too many of the meat pieces.  I like to keep an open mind, but I couldn't get into the earthy flavor or smell of the tripe. For my entrée, I ordered the thinly cut steak from the main menu.  Its seasonings were really good, yet unfamiliar.  The steak was thinly sliced, not unlike roast beef would be on a sandwich, but there was plenty of it, and as thin as it was, it wasn't overcooked.  I chose the red beans and yellow rice for my side dishes.  The beans came in a cup and the rice on the plate with the meat.  I poured the red beans over the rice and ate everything.  It was really good, and authentic from what I could tell (I've never been to S. America).  My gf got the grilled chicken and white rice with black beans.  The chicken, which I tried, was a quite a bit too char-grilled for me, but my girlfriend didn't mind it.  It was also very thin, but was decently proportioned.",4.0
Location is somewhat discreet buy based on how plentiful the customers were you had to assume they are doing something right. Place is rather small but decent ambiance. Though it took forever to get a table (I was with a party of 4) it was somewhat with it. Food too longer than it should buy very flavorful. Price range was great. I would come back but I would probably call ahead. The place is rather small so it fills up quickly and the environment encourages plenty of conversation so no ones rushing to leave.,3.0

"Decided to come here on this snowy evening with hubby and 2 sons in tow(2 & 8 yr old). We got there around 5 :15 pm. The place was  pretty empty(thankfully) .The first thing I noticed was the ""cash only"" sign. Was the credit card/debit machine broken??? Apparently not! This is their policy. They have an ATM in the back but this policy was definitely an inconvenience. We were seated pretty quickly. About 5 minutes after we were seated the waiter brings us a cup of red and white wine. Wow that was pretty quick I told my husband ...maybe it's on the house? WRONG! lol apparently the waiter got the order mixed up and served the wrong table. I happily started sipping my cup but hubby didn't. I told the waiter to just add the wine to our tab. Our waiter was on point and attentive. He totally engaged with my 2 year old and we didn't get any looks from staff or patrons(at least from what I noticed) when they saw kids were entering the restaurant. They served us plantain chips with a garlic dip(very spicy) which was yummy. Our appetizers were empanadas~chicken(hubby loved them....it  was light and flaky). I ordered the pastele en hoja with pork. I thought it tasted okay( not like how Momma makes it). We ordered the following entree's1.pastelon de carne~YUM-O!! The meat was seasoned perfectly the maduros were nice and sweet. This was damn good!2.Chicharrones de pollo~Both my boys tore it up!!! My 8 yr said ""mommy i love the rice!!"" and my 2 yr old kept asking for more.3.Rabo Guisado~ I didnt hear one word from my husband while he was eating which basically means he loved it!!! Not only did he eat his entire plate but he also started taking food from my plate and our sons...greedy!!!!I ordered a tres leche cake to go(it was my first time trying it ...it tasted okay....next time i will get the flan :)The ambiance of the place is cool and laid back. Its dimly light and they were playing Bob Marley. I was pretty relaxed( it may have been the wine I was sipping on or the fact my 2 yr old was playing on his IPAD, my 8 yr old was playing on his DS)I would definitely come back, But please change the cash only policy.",4.0
"This place is awesome! The price point is fantastic and the food is high quality. So glad we came here just moments before Happy Hour ended at 7pm because we started off the night with empanadas for $1 each! These were generously sized with fantastic filling-to-shell ratio! Got 2 each of chicken, beef, and the cheese empanadas, and I feel like I could've eaten these forever or just made a meal out of it, especially because the sauce it comes with is fantastic!For the main dish, I got the Pernil (roasted pork shoulder) with sautéed vegetables. If you've ever gone to Momofuku Ssam Bar in Manhattan, you know what it is - the meat is just so tender and juicy, and you don't stop until all of it is gone. The oily-ness was just right, although I would've preferred the fat-to-lean-meat ratio to be higher, but I think next time I get this I'm just going to ask for more fat meat. I remember my last piece of the Pernil was a crispy skin piece, which came as a surprise after having all that chewy meat - loved the contrasting texture of the crunch.My friend got the pork Monfongo (mashed plantains) and it was so yummy with the tomato-based sauce that I had to wolf down her leftovers, too. Would've preferred the meat to plantain ratio to be higher, but it was still pretty delectable.The garlic sauce they serve with the plantains is pretty awesome.

I must say that every time I come to this place I feel like I am home. This place is a few blocks away from home so it is convenient.

"I was excited to try this place out after reading all the great reviews. Solid food but nothing impressive. I do not find the empanadas that everyone is raving about to be so amazing.

I also had the Bacalao Fritters as an appetizer and I do not recommend getting it. It's two tiny, VERY dry fritters. Not very appetizing. My boyfriend is Dominican, so he knows his cuisine. Neither one of us is looking forward to coming back. Again, the food isn't bad but isn't great either.",3.0
"My girlfriend and I walked by this place one night and she thought it was so charming on the outside that we would have to come back for lunch the next day.  And it was great!  The food was delicious, the staff helpful and pleasant, and the interior cultivated a friendly, comfortable atmosphere.Tripe soup:  I just had to order the beef tripe soup, based on other Yelpers' reviews.  It was good, and my favorite part of it was the broth, which was very rich and wholesome tasting.  The carrots and potatoes in the soup soaked up the sauce, and I liked those too.  I appreciated the actual tripe for what it was, but didn't eat too many of the meat pieces.  I like to keep an open mind, but I couldn't get into the earthy flavor or smell of the tripe. For my entrée, I ordered the thinly cut steak from the main menu.  Its seasonings were really good, yet unfamiliar.  The steak was thinly sliced, not unlike roast beef would be on a sandwich, but there was plenty of it, and as thin as it was, it wasn't overcooked.  I chose the red beans and yellow rice for my side dishes.  The beans came in a cup and the rice on the plate with the meat.  I poured the red beans over the rice and ate everything.  It was really good, and authentic from what I could tell (I've never been to S. America).  My gf got the grilled chicken and white rice with black beans.  The chicken, which I tried, was a quite a bit too char-grilled for me, but my girlfriend didn't mind it.  It was also very thin, but was decently proportioned.",4.0
Location is somewhat discreet buy based on how plentiful the customers were you had to assume they are doing something right. Place is rather small but decent ambiance. Though it took forever to get a table (I was with a party of 4) it was somewhat with it. Food too longer than it should buy very flavorful. Price range was great. I would come back but I would probably call ahead. The place is rather small so it fills up quickly and the environment encourages plenty of conversation so no ones rushing to leave.,3.0

"Decided to come here on this snowy evening with hubby and 2 sons in tow(2 & 8 yr old). We got there around 5 :15 pm. The place was  pretty empty(thankfully) .The first thing I noticed was the ""cash only"" sign. Was the credit card/debit machine broken??? Apparently not! This is their policy. They have an ATM in the back but this policy was definitely an inconvenience. We were seated pretty quickly. About 5 minutes after we were seated the waiter brings us a cup of red and white wine. Wow that was pretty quick I told my husband ...maybe it's on the house? WRONG! lol apparently the waiter got the order mixed up and served the wrong table. I happily started sipping my cup but hubby didn't. I told the waiter to just add the wine to our tab. Our waiter was on point and attentive. He totally engaged with my 2 year old and we didn't get any looks from staff or patrons(at least from what I noticed) when they saw kids were entering the restaurant. They served us plantain chips with a garlic dip(very spicy) which was yummy. Our appetizers were empanadas~chicken(hubby loved them....it  was light and flaky). I ordered the pastele en hoja with pork. I thought it tasted okay( not like how Momma makes it). We ordered the following entree's1.pastelon de carne~YUM-O!! The meat was seasoned perfectly the maduros were nice and sweet. This was damn good!2.Chicharrones de pollo~Both my boys tore it up!!! My 8 yr said ""mommy i love the rice!!"" and my 2 yr old kept asking for more.3.Rabo Guisado~ I didnt hear one word from my husband while he was eating which basically means he loved it!!! Not only did he eat his entire plate but he also started taking food from my plate and our sons...greedy!!!!I ordered a tres leche cake to go(it was my first time trying it ...it tasted okay....next time i will get the flan :)The ambiance of the place is cool and laid back. Its dimly light and they were playing Bob Marley. I was pretty relaxed( it may have been the wine I was sipping on or the fact my 2 yr old was playing on his IPAD, my 8 yr old was playing on his DS)I would definitely come back, But please change the cash only policy.",4.0
"This place is awesome! The price point is fantastic and the food is high quality. So glad we came here just moments before Happy Hour ended at 7pm because we started off the night with empanadas for $1 each! These were generously sized with fantastic filling-to-shell ratio! Got 2 each of chicken, beef, and the cheese empanadas, and I feel like I could've eaten these forever or just made a meal out of it, especially because the sauce it comes with is fantastic!For the main dish, I got the Pernil (roasted pork shoulder) with sautéed vegetables. If you've ever gone to Momofuku Ssam Bar in Manhattan, you know what it is - the meat is just so tender and juicy, and you don't stop until all of it is gone. The oily-ness was just right, although I would've preferred the fat-to-lean-meat ratio to be higher, but I think next time I get this I'm just going to ask for more fat meat. I remember my last piece of the Pernil was a crispy skin piece, which came as a surprise after having all that chewy meat - loved the contrasting texture of the crunch.My friend got the pork Monfongo (mashed plantains) and it was so yummy with the tomato-based sauce that I had to wolf down her leftovers, too. Would've preferred the meat to plantain ratio to be higher, but it was still pretty delectable.The garlic sauce they serve with the plantains is pretty awesome. Good thing I didn't see my girlfriend that night because my breath probably smelled gross (not to mention I was pretty bloated by the end). The sauce doesn't look like much because there's not much quantity, but it's thick and viscous, and really packs some serious flavor oomph.Should've saved room for dessert because the chocolate mousse cake sounded very appetizing...but there's always next time!",5.0

One of the easiest 5 stars. This place is what Brooklyn is all about with a piece of real hispanic food.

"I have been a regular at Puerto Viejo since it first opened, however, it is getting ONE STAR for the horrendous service I received on Saturday evening. I decided to have a group dinner with some girlfriends who aren't from Brooklyn. Upon arrival, I was greeted by the hostess and seated almost immediately. AT first it was 5 of us, then our 6th friend joined us 10 minutes later. When she first came in, the waiter was haphazardly blocking the aisle and impeding anyone from coming into the restaurant. My friend politely said excuse me, and the waiter (I don't know his name because our receipt said Leandro but the manager and hostess refused to give me his name) told my friend that she needed to wait until he finished conversing with a customer. After that, every time he passed our table he rolled his eyes at my friend. When it was time to take our orders, he handed out 5 waters (did not hand one to her) and did not even address her. Because of this waiter's OBNOXIOUS behavior, she refused to order anything. But when the bill came, I noticed gratuity was included. I asked the waiter at what number is gratuity included, he told me that gratuity is added when there are 6 or more guests. When i asked him why was gratuity included when he hasn't even acknowledged my friend, he told me ""i seated 6 guests."" When we asked to speak the the manager, not only would he not get him for us but he said we can walk to the bar and ask for the manager ourselves. When we did that, he called over a woman and told us that she was the manager. After a BRIEF convo with her, she admitted that she was just a DISH WASHER and not in fact the manager. After all of that, we finally found the manager and had the gratuity removed (after a short argument). I WILL NEVER COME BACK TO THIS RESTAURANT AGAIN.

"Puerto Viejo is amazing! It's everything a great neighborhood restaurant should be; delicious, affordable, perfect atmosphere for any occasion... date, dinner with the girls, dinner with the parents.... I've been here a couple times. The owner (I think), is really cool and approachable. He's usually sitting at the bar. The service is also really great.  I always ask 5 million questions when I eat out and the server was able to answer them all, and she was happy to ask the chef the things she couldn't answer. The food that I've tried was amazing.. I've had...Bacalao (codfish stew): Delicious. I've been thinking about it for 2 days.  If you like salt fish stews definitely try this with the boiled yuca... so freaking good... and it's only $9!Monfongo: Starchy, hearty and amazing.... perfect thing to eat before running a marathon.... or if you just want something amazing in your mouth.  Pastelon special: Pastelon is a Puerto Rican Lasagna that's made with sweet plantains instead of pasta, meat, sauce and cheese. If sweet and savory is your thing, you'll love it. Those are the 3 things I've had so far... I can't wait to go back and try the oxtail stew and the pernil.... and have the codfish and monfongo again. Seriously, I could eat here every day. The only things stopping me from giving Puerto Viejo 5 stars are that it's cash only and they only serve beer/wine. I wouldn't be too upset about the cash only thing if the ATM didn't have a $2.00 surcharge. WTF? Don't inconvenience me AND gouge me! ....shady. Also it would be lovely to have a nice cocktail with my meal, but i'm sure that's coming soon. Try this place! You won't be dissapointed!",4.0

The sangria was excellent (I used to live in Spain and have high expectations for sangria) and quite strong.We also shared the burger ($8), which came with incredible, perfectly-cooked yuca fries.

"Some of the food was quite good (the burger, the mofongo, the maduros) and the restaurant clearly has the capability to be good. However, our visit was marred by two things:1) Easily fixable--some items (like the bacalaitos) come doused in what is essentially Russian dressing with no mention of that on the menu (or I'd have ordered it ""on the side"" or not at all). Come on, restaurants. Don't serve surprises. List it on the menu or bring it on the side.2) Not so easily fixable, but pretty important...the service.The water guy was very assiduous and everyone was super-friendly. That's good--great, in fact! However, the time it took for our food to come was insane...and the restaurant was only half-full, at 8pm. (It took more than 20 minutes for one of the two appetizers we'd ordered--a lonely empanada--to arrive. We watched my brother-in-law eat it. Twenty minutes later my (spurted-on) bacalaitos arrived, and everyone watched me eat them. More than twenty minutes after that, the meals arrived, well over an hour after we'd arrived.The staff clearly weren't assholes or bums; there was no lounging around or dirty looks. I think there must be some kind of systemic tweaking that needs to be done so things happen properly. After our food finally arrived (again, more than an hour after ordering), with our drinks exhausted, we asked for two more Cokes. They were clearly visible ten feet away from us in an illuminated bar refrigerator. They were cold and tempting. Five minutes passed and they did not arrive. A server came over and assured us he was getting the Cokes, but they had to ""go through the bartender"" so would just be a moment. We worked through our food and were finished by the time they showed up.I get that restaurants have lockups sometimes, but the weird thing is that at no point did someone come over and say, ""hey, sorry it's taking awhile*"" or ""can we bring you a round of drinks [while you wait over an hour for food]?"". I don't think that's asking too much and, in fact, is kind of standard.* At no point during the pre-food hour; he did seem to recognize that the Cokes were taking way too long, but that was well after the food arrived an hour late.",2.0
"DECENT! And that's huge. Let me explain why. First time here. Came off the strength of...Yelp actually. Didn't know much about the menu other than they seem to have a decent happy hour. Empanadas were solid. Not life-changing. But about one of the best deals you're going to get for $1. I'm serious folks. Don't read over that. We had their most popular dish, as per our extremely helpful server, guide in this case, the bisteca encebollada, and it did not disappoint. ONLY downside is they don't take card. I'm from CA where every place does. That's more my fault than anything. Lessons learned: carry cash, support neighborhood biz, and find more happy hours like this one.",4.0
"UPDATE!My husband gave this place a second shot, going for happy hour last Friday, along with two friends.  We got the same waiter as last time, and he was wonderful.  Friendly and attentive (throughout). We liked the menu offered at happy hour/dinner better than the options on the brunch menu, and the prices are terrific.  This time, it took less than 10 minutes for our food to arrive at the table.Now that I had a full experience here, I will say that the decor is a very nice urban rustic and the restaurant has a great flow to it, adding to the casual and welcoming environment.",4.0

And they threw in an order of crisp plantain chips as a surprise treat. The shrimp and mofongo were both delicious, and I was very happy with my  steak and onions.

I got the $1 chicken empanada (happy hour special), the skirt steak with fried yuca, a side of sautéed veggies, and a coffee - everything was SUPER flavorful and absolutely amazing. Both my friend and I ate for under $45. The ambiance is sexy hipster and would be perfect for date night or girls night. Literally one of my new favorite restaurants!!",5.0
"I came here with my boyfriend after hearing such wonderful things about this place. Eh, I'm not to crazy about it. I ordered Carne Guisada and my boyfriend ordered chicharon de pollo.

Not once did the waiter come to check up on us, and when he did my boyfriend asked for a refill on his sprite with a nasty attitude the waiter said "" you mean another one"" and walked away. we will not be coming back thats for sure. it would also be nice if they let you know from the beginning that its cash only.",2.0

"Some of the food was quite good (the burger, the mofongo, the maduros) and the restaurant clearly has the capability to be good. However, our visit was marred by two things:1) Easily fixable--some items (like the bacalaitos) come doused in what is essentially Russian dressing with no mention of that on the menu (or I'd have ordered it ""on the side"" or not at all). Come on, restaurants. Don't serve surprises. List it on the menu or bring it on the side.2) Not so easily fixable, but pretty important...the service.The water guy was very assiduous and everyone was super-friendly. That's good--great, in fact! However, the time it took for our food to come was insane...and the restaurant was only half-full, at 8pm. (It took more than 20 minutes for one of the two appetizers we'd ordered--a lonely empanada--to arrive. We watched my brother-in-law eat it. Twenty minutes later my (spurted-on) bacalaitos arrived, and everyone watched me eat them. More than twenty minutes after that, the meals arrived, well over an hour after we'd arrived.The staff clearly weren't assholes or bums; there was no lounging around or dirty looks. I think there must be some kind of systemic tweaking that needs to be done so things happen properly. After our food finally arrived (again, more than an hour after ordering), with our drinks exhausted, we asked for two more Cokes. They were clearly visible ten feet away from us in an illuminated bar refrigerator. They were cold and tempting. Five minutes passed and they did not arrive. A server came over and assured us he was getting the Cokes, but they had to ""go through the bartender"" so would just be a moment. We worked through our food and were finished by the time they showed up.I get that restaurants have lockups sometimes, but the weird thing is that at no point did someone come over and say, ""hey, sorry it's taking awhile*"" or ""can we bring you a round of drinks [while you wait over an hour for food]?"". I don't think that's asking too much and, in fact, is kind of standard.* At no point during the pre-food hour; he did seem to recognize that the Cokes were taking way too long, but that was well after the food arrived an hour late.",2.0
"DECENT! And that's huge. Let me explain why. First time here. Came off the strength of...Yelp actually. Didn't know much about the menu other than they seem to have a decent happy hour. Empanadas were solid. Not life-changing. But about one of the best deals you're going to get for $1. I'm serious folks. Don't read over that. We had their most popular dish, as per our extremely helpful server, guide in this case, the bisteca encebollada, and it did not disappoint. ONLY downside is they don't take card. I'm from CA where every place does. That's more my fault than anything. Lessons learned: carry cash, support neighborhood biz, and find more happy hours like this one.",4.0
"UPDATE!My husband gave this place a second shot, going for happy hour last Friday, along with two friends.  We got the same waiter as last time, and he was wonderful.  Friendly and attentive (throughout). We liked the menu offered at happy hour/dinner better than the options on the brunch menu, and the prices are terrific.  This time, it took less than 10 minutes for our food to arrive at the table.Now that I had a full experience here, I will say that the decor is a very nice urban rustic and the restaurant has a great flow to it, adding to the casual and welcoming environment.",4.0

"Finally made it here after having bookmarked it long ago. Ambiance was great. Loud enough to have a private conversation but not crazy or obnoxious in any way. Very very cute. Split the sandwich de pescado and the Cuban sandwich with my date with a side of yuca fries. All were delicious! Seemed to be great quality and definitely sizable. The house hot sauce was spicy and flavorful. Berry sangria was also awesome and I'm not usually a fan of sweet drinks at all!!! The whole bill was $33. Aka, nothing. I will return.",5.0

Very nice to our 1-year old granddaughter, too. Great little empanadas, a buck each during happy hour with reduced price sangria. And they threw in an order of crisp plantain chips as a surprise treat. The shrimp and mofongo were both delicious, and I was very happy with my  steak and onions.

"For many years, your pal Johnny sung the praises of Puerto Viejo in much the same way that virgins screamed on prom night, which is to say loud and orgasmic and sometimes with a bit of blood in a good way and often with a mild whiff of alcohol exuding from the back of the throat.

This covenant is understood.  It is the Brooklyn way.  But Puerto Viejo betrayed me.  And it betrayed the neighborhood.  Because the only people who charge for rice with a reliable dish are venal vultures who want to kill the goddam community, who want to squeeze whatever slim teat remains.  The place went trendy and lost its soul and broke my heart.  And so your pal Johnny hangs his head, remembering a restaurant when, and pushed further east for the true Brooklyn wonders like the Trail of Tears in reverse.  This has been an elegy.",2.0

"Unbelievable experience for a young couple in love. Very undervalued for Brooklyn standards. We came on a rainy Saturday night and were seated immediately. They have a lot of nautical motifs, including the large rope attached to the front door that one can pull to open it as if you were entering this ship. We started off sharing the spicy pork empanadas special. They had a nice balance of meat to pastry and the consistency was moist, easy to cut, and not too crunchy. I have had empanadas before where cutting them open was a project and you either lose half of the insides or the outsides crumble too much and generally make a mess. If you are a red wine drinker, the current 2009 Tempranillo wine is quite good- it has some elegant structure. each of us had a different pork based entrée and I got to say they cooked it to perfection, the sauces that came with them complemented the food very well and it was presented on the plate beautifully. We also tried one flan and Tres Leches for dessert and the entire bill with generously deserved tip was $100. So to sum up, for a very reasonable price, we had excellent waitstaff service, excellent appetizer entrée and dessert, beautiful Spanish wine, and I did not mention the most groovin' lounge type playlist. If you want to eat your Dominican food with Spanish music in the background, the server clued us in that Thursday nights they will have southside and merengue in the like.

Chicharones done with some kind of citrus, tough enough to be challenging (bueno) but not so tough as to be off-putting.There are just a few WTFs mixed in though.* Thousand island with the empanadas?* Starches (yucca fries, plaintains) come with some sort of green sauce that tastes exactly like pureed garlic. I dunno, maybe it's just me, but I want spice, vinegar, and citrus in a situation like that. Garlic I just couldn't get into.Broadly speaking, food is great, and the price is right. Solid place.",4.0
"I have more than one year been a regular a Puerto Viejo. I would say it is the BEST DOMINICAN FOOD in the whole New York Area. Everything is good, from empanadas, tostones, pernil, mofongo, etc ... and the Cuban Sandwich should win ""The Best in NY"" award. Monique, Cinthia and all the guys, will make you feel like you are home. The Brunch? Go and get the ""Tres Golpes""... if you are Dominican, you know what I'm talking about. Puerto Viejo takes me home when I'm craving my grandmother's food.",5.0

"One of the best gems in the neighborhood! Absolutely hidden. I'm actually pissed Yelp let me down and never reported it's existence. My girlfriend and I happened upon it and fell in love.Atmosphere is spot on. The staff is fantastic. The food is really cheap and most importantly - delicious. I like being adventurous. So I ordered the tripe soup and Oxtail. Both were stellar. Felt very home cooked and delicious.The only thing I'd love to see is some signature drinks, and they have mounted fridge with beverages that has fluorescent lights that interfere with the atmosphere and have got to go.

"Came here to celebrate the end of midterms with my boyfriend and it was a very good choice :).

Empanadas are a great value, definitely cannot come during happy hour without trying them. The pernil mofongo, side of maduros, and Completo sandwich all were great. Portions are perfect - generous without being overwhelming.

"Dear friends,If you are looking for authentic Dominican/Puerto Rican food... THIS IS  NOT THE PLACE TO GO.

Sadly, they don't know much about what they are selling and serving. I mean... c'mon! Take a minute to study your restaurant's menu! Ask about what each item means or how it is made!Second, no one in the kitchen, as I learned later, was of Caribbean origin. The cook was Mexican and the rest of Central American and South American background. Now, you may think.. so what? As long as they cook well... thats what matters right? But when you order ""bacalaitos"" and you get two tiny smashed- dry bunuelos de bacalo from last Christmas, and a mofongo with chicken that tastes like an over cooked and over heated venezuelan arepa with, actually, no chicken couple with rice and beans that taste like those you get at an American dinner... you realize you are definitely in the WRONG PLACE. Trust me, I am Puerto Rican. I know how to cook a simple mofongo. It is NOT that difficult. But this place really really sucks! Oh... and dont order a ""Tres Leches"" for dessert.

"So, while visiting Brooklyn (from Sacramento), we ate here twice. Our first day here and our last day here. There is a little back story. The year before, my wife and I got married and went to Costa Rica. We stayed on the east side (caribbean) in a very small town called Cahuita. It was next to a a big town called Puerto Viejo (yes, I know there are many towns called Puerto Viejo in Central America). We loved the area, people and food. It stayed with us.A year later, my wife and I are visiting NYC for two weeks and staying with friends in Brooklyn for one of those. We arrived at their apartment, but they were at work. We dropped off our stuff and went exploring, found them on Yelp (of, course), and hearing calls from Costa Rica went in.For those who don't know, the restaurant Puerto Viejo is located in an improbable place. it borders Crown Heights and Prospect Park. I believe they are trying to call that area ""prospect heights"". It is across from a high school and surrounded by auto mechanics. Were you to drive or walk by during the day, the restaurant's facade may seem uninviting or maybe even closed. You may pass it up. That, my friend, would be a huge mistake.Once you walk through the doors, you are transported to that little town somewhere on the eastern shore of Costa Rica.The place is family owned and after striking up a conversation with two of the sons I learned that the restaurant had been remodeled around two years ago and you can tell it was done with love. These guys get it.Let's get to the food. We had the tostones (fried plantains). They were good but the sauce they serve it with made them a whole lot better. I had the Cuban Sandwich -flat out amazing. My Wife had a salad that kicked her ass. One thing that needs to be mentioned: The hot salsa/sauce with no name.Spicy. Burning, really. But full of flavor. Both times I went I asked what it was. ""It's homemade it doesn't have a name"". My opinion is that if you put that stuff in a bottle and sold it at stores, you could just call it ""money"".Speaking of the staff (family): friendly and outgoing. The second time we was our anniversary night. We stopped in for just a quick drink before having dinner elsewhere (Bar Corvo- i'll be writing that one up too- 5 stars too). We ended up drinking a bottle, making friends with a fairly friendly but a little inebriated fellow at the bar and having another great  conversation with the staff. Summary-Food- Dominican with a slightly spanish feel and full of flavors.Ambiance- Amazing.

Everything is reasonably priced, and very affordable for the large portions! Their plantain chips and homemade garlic sauce will knock you off your bar stool or chair.

No where else in the Crown Heights area will you find a more welcoming place to bring family, friends, revolutionary thinkers, and community activists to enjoy a meal, a drink, and a good time together!5) THE STORY/PERSEVERANCE: Not only did they SURVIVE a major fire in their building, but they are THRIVING in its wake!

I love this place.The food is super tasty and affordable. I have had the delicious pork mofongo which is a heap of garlicky starchy plaintains and chopped  chicharron goodness. I also had the chicharron with rice and beans and maduros. The chicharron are perfectly crispy and have the perfect proportion of meatiness to fatty skin. Yum yum yum.The waitstaff is superfriendly and the decor is a found object industrial vibe. A great neighborhood spot that will make your friends  jealous.,4.0

"I have been wanting to try this spot for a while and I was super elated that I finally had the chance to go. It's a great find in an unexpected street corner. The hospitality was wonderful and the food was delish....the pepper sauce I give it 3 thumbs up! I am Trini and I love spicy and their pepper sauce was true spicy and flavorful. Even though the menu is not long, there's something on the menu for everyone. I will definitely go back!",4.0
"I really enjoy this place, not only is the food really good and priced great. But the service is great. One of the waitress Monica is super sweet and very personable.

"Great service, staff was awesome. Food was delicious, I'm Dominican myself, born and raised. I can say that not all the flavors are super authentic, they totally borrowed some flavor ideas from other Latin cuisine but its still amazing. My only real complaint was that they're cash only. One suggestion I would make to them though is they should add mamajuana to their drinks menu , that's a true Dominican drink people can enjoy . I absolutely recommend this place for a date or a small group going out for dinner, it is kinda small but nice atmosphere and food will not disappoint.",4.0
"Yesss! Shout out to my Dominican people!!! These guys are doing it right! If you want the closet thing to your grandmas home cooked food, you need to go here! The set up of the restaurant is cool, with nice decor and ambiance. Delivery time is good. The food is amazing!!! The only reason i did not give it a full 5 stars is because they could use a more vegetarian options, but then again dominicans love meat so i cant really complain about that. Thank me later once you've visited.",4.0
"ok re-reviewing this place after another superb dinner last night. love that this place is so close to my apt and awesome cheap eatsWe got a few more different items -MP fish (grilled tilapia last night, slightly overdone but tasty)-steak : delicious and $10?! The fries were great -beef empanada- saltfish fritters: i wasn't a huge fan of the texture but the taste was great. -flan & cheesecakeI'm confused by their hours still. Occasionally I'll pass by and they'll be closed... when the same time the following wk, they'd be open. Maybe it's based on the day's business?",5.0
"Good Dominican food, strong sangrias and always great service. Small spot but lively and servers know their stuff. CASH only - which can be annoying because theyre not the cheapest, but still a good time. I wish I would have remembered the very first server's name - she was awesome! Family owned so they care about quality.",4.0
"I have been living in Crown Heights for some years now and was looking for a change to my ""culinary scenery."" I did not want to stray to far from home so I searched Yelp for some options and came across this establishment.  I was not disappointed.  The food and service were great.  And,  what you get for the price... it's a steal.  I will definitely go back to this restaurant!

I grew up in Washington Heights (AKA the Dominican Republic) so I know what great Dominican food tastes like.  Puerto Viejo is the REAL DEAL.  Dishes that I have tried:Pork MofongoChurrasco SteakPernilRice & BeansYuca FriesEverything I've had is SUPER BANGING.  Trust me.,5.0
"I am 100 % dominican and i can truly say the food from here taste straight out of my mothers/grandmothers kitchen !! I've  been to many Dominican restaurants and i can honestly say this one is by far the best i had. The prices are really good too . Very reasonable . I will defitnetly come back here to eat. The service was truly awesome , the waiter a tho was new he knew the menu and made great suggestions .. The Empanadas were to die for !!! Delicious .

"The only disappointing thing about Puerto Veijo is that I hadn't visited it sooner.This is absolutely my new favorite restaurant in the neighborhood (and I am a big fan of a lot of the local restaurants). The decor is charming and comfortable. The staff are friendly and inviting, happy to recommend their favorites and explain menu items. I grew up in a mainly dominican neighborhood and this food is just as good as my friends' mothers'. The grilled chicken was moist, perfectly seasoned, and flavorful. The rice and beans and maduros were absolutely perfect. I cant wait to go back and try more item. I highly recommend Puerto Viejo to everyone and will be returning as soon as possible to further explore the menu.",5.0
"This restaurant has earned it's high rate and not just because of the charming rustic decor. The price is right and the food is delicious.

The food was authentic and the service was excellent. You can be sure that we will be back to enjoy some good homemade spanish comfort food. It has a family owned feel which I like.

"The food was great, the drinks were great, but I don't think they are fully prepared to accommodate large groups for celebrations.  The food took over an hour to be served after we ordered, and to top it off, they realized they undercharged us after the most of the people left.  They made the mistake, and then they couldn't take the hit.  We paid over $400 with gratuity already included, and she had the odasity to ask me for $19 more after we paid the bill they gave us in full.  She even dared to offer me the $1 change on their error.  Really?  A $1?

"One of the best deals in Brooklyn. I've tried probably half the menu and I've enjoyed everything. Wonderful roast pork, wonderful chicken. Love the black beans.

Hoooraaaay!  This is truly a find.  One of my favorite restaurants in Clinton Hill/Crown Heights.  It's kind of in a strange location nestled amongst auto repair shops but you need this place in your life.  Tasty Dominican Food with reasonable prices and portions.  The decor of the restaurant itself isn't bad either so don't be afraid to try and romance that girl you met on christianmingle.com here.  Everything I've had has been great but my personal favorite is the Bistec Encebollado.  Make sure you try their hot sauce too unless you are a wittle bunny wabbit that thinks Franks Red Hot is too spicy.,4.0

Our server was attentive and great. The strangest thing was the crowd and clientele. A definite mix, some sense of community, but some weird goings-on, also. When we got there, we witnessed a loud argument between three patrons and the chef. Before we left, there was a strange group who repeatedly were entering and exiting and having vulgar conversation. Maybe it just comes with the territory/location. And hopefully it's less chaotic during dinner. Kind of put a negative spin on our lunch/brunch.Will we go back? Absolutely.",4.0

"I f found a particular reviewers comments both interesting and particularly disturbing at the same time.  I found insightful the reviewers somewhat romantic view of ""days gone by"", and how the restaurant appealed to the common man.  I am sympathetic to the reviewers concern about how changes, while agreeable to others, tend to dishearten and alienate loyal disciples of this establishment.  However when I hear the phrase, ""But then the white people came."" I cannot help but feel miffed about what I believe is an obvious racist comment.  Sure, the people that now frequent this establishment have enough disposable income to afford the restaurant an extra dollar sign. Sure, the conversations I've had the pleasure of overhearing occasionally have a pseudo-intellectual flavor to them.  And yes, I find it baffling why some of the patrons need to have a southern California affectation in their voice, when you know they've never been anywhere near the west coast. However, despite the white people comment, the people who now actually patronize this place are actually an ethnically diverse bunch, or at least I assume so since you can't always tell someone's race just by looking at them (believe it or not). What it is clear though, the majority of the people that now patronize this establishment have certain tastes, and the ability to spend that's different from before, which then informs the establishment and drives the cost.  On that score, the reviewer may have a point.All I know is the food is good, the service is good, and the atmosphere is to my taste, although a bit pricey. Is it a place that's cheap enough for me to go again: I would say yes.  However, is it a place that I can afford to frequent regularly: Now that's a different story.",4.0
"My best friend recently moved to Brooklyn and has been raving about this restaurant. I was finally able to come visit him this past week for NYE and begged him to take me there. I like the vibe of the restaurant and the food, but the service was HORRIBLE!! I'm convinced that our waitress, Cynthia, just started working at the restaurant that afternoon and had never been a server before. When she brought our menus, a friend and I had questions about some of the dishes. She seemed very uninterested in explaining items to us. WE had to ask to order appetizers and WE had to ask to order our main entrees. There are complimentary banana chips that every table gets and we had to ask her to bring those out. There was a long delay for our main entrees, which can't be blamed on her. But i do fault her for lack of communication. She would walk past our table and not even make eye contact. There was another table near us and we repeatedly saw her walk to them to and ask if they needed anything. She NEVER asked my table if we were ok. When we finally got her attention and asked about our food, she claimed that because we had such a large table our food was delayed. We only had 5 people!! Again, the food was fine but the service was terrible. I would go to this restaurant again but i will run for the hills if Cynthia comes anywhere near my table.",3.0

"Nice Dominican spot located amidst a bunch of auto repair shops. Off the beaten path, with a wonderful interior decor. I ordered the chicken sandwich, but the real winner is their breakfast plate.

"I love the fact that I finally found a traditional Dominican restaurant, where the food taste just like home. We had chicken and beef empanadas, which were seasoned perfectly.

I had the oxtails and I must say I was surprised at how tasty they were.  I might just go back this weekend for some more.They don't have a full bar, but don't worry about it since their sangria is more then enough; you'll be stumbling home by the end of the evening.We left already planning our next visit.  I gave this place 5 stars because of the awesome food, the great sangria, and the excellent service.",5.0

"I f found a particular reviewers comments both interesting and particularly disturbing at the same time.  I found insightful the reviewers somewhat romantic view of ""days gone by"", and how the restaurant appealed to the common man.  I am sympathetic to the reviewers concern about how changes, while agreeable to others, tend to dishearten and alienate loyal disciples of this establishment.  However when I hear the phrase, ""But then the white people came."" I cannot help but feel miffed about what I believe is an obvious racist comment.  Sure, the people that now frequent this establishment have enough disposable income to afford the restaurant an extra dollar sign. Sure, the conversations I've had the pleasure of overhearing occasionally have a pseudo-intellectual flavor to them.  And yes, I find it baffling why some of the patrons need to have a southern California affectation in their voice, when you know they've never been anywhere near the west coast. However, despite the white people comment, the people who now actually patronize this place are actually an ethnically diverse bunch, or at least I assume so since you can't always tell someone's race just by looking at them (believe it or not). What it is clear though, the majority of the people that now patronize this establishment have certain tastes, and the ability to spend that's different from before, which then informs the establishment and drives the cost.  On that score, the reviewer may have a point.All I know is the food is good, the service is good, and the atmosphere is to my taste, although a bit pricey. Is it a place that's cheap enough for me to go again: I would say yes.  However, is it a place that I can afford to frequent regularly: Now that's a different story.",4.0
"My best friend recently moved to Brooklyn and has been raving about this restaurant. I was finally able to come visit him this past week for NYE and begged him to take me there. I like the vibe of the restaurant and the food, but the service was HORRIBLE!! I'm convinced that our waitress, Cynthia, just started working at the restaurant that afternoon and had never been a server before. When she brought our menus, a friend and I had questions about some of the dishes. She seemed very uninterested in explaining items to us. WE had to ask to order appetizers and WE had to ask to order our main entrees. There are complimentary banana chips that every table gets and we had to ask her to bring those out. There was a long delay for our main entrees, which can't be blamed on her. But i do fault her for lack of communication. She would walk past our table and not even make eye contact. There was another table near us and we repeatedly saw her walk to them to and ask if they needed anything. She NEVER asked my table if we were ok. When we finally got her attention and asked about our food, she claimed that because we had such a large table our food was delayed. We only had 5 people!! Again, the food was fine but the service was terrible. I would go to this restaurant again but i will run for the hills if Cynthia comes anywhere near my table.",3.0
"Had chicharon de pollo, sancocho and mofongo. All was delish,  incl the typical cafe con leche to top the experience, at the very end. Good music. Will return!!! :)",5.0
"Nice Dominican spot located amidst a bunch of auto repair shops. Off the beaten path, with a wonderful interior decor. I ordered the chicken sandwich, but the real winner is their breakfast plate. It is $5 for 2 eggs, potatoes and bacon or sausage. Other traditional Dominican dishes abound, and the house made salsa is fantastic.",4.0
"I love the fact that I finally found a traditional Dominican restaurant, where the food taste just like home. We had chicken and beef empanadas, which were seasoned perfectly. My fiancé had the Mofongo and all I have to say is that she refused to share; excellent. I had the oxtails and I must say I was surprised at how tasty they were.  I might just go back this weekend for some more.They don't have a full bar, but don't worry about it since their sangria is more then enough; you'll be stumbling home by the end of the evening.We left already planning our next visit.  I gave this place 5 stars because of the awesome food, the great sangria, and the excellent service.",5.0

"Located in the middle of some construction and a few autobody shops, the location isn't ideal.  I generally avoid that stretch of Grand when it's dark since there are so few people out and about there. I was out with my competitive weightlifter friend and after repeatedly bouncing meal questions off each other like ""what do you feel like eating?"" ""I don't know what are you in the mood for?"" we both stopped being polite and decided something new would be appropriate.   I knew she'd beat down anyone if they tried to mess with us so I mentioned this place and that I wanted to try it.  She said ""empanadas? for a dollar? why the hell not?"" When we walked in we were greeted by a very friendly server who promptly seated us in a charming dining room with lots of aged wood, lit with old fashioned edison light bulbs.  I asked when they had opened and he explained they just re-opened 2 months ago.  He was great about explaining the menu to us (we had no Dominican food prior experience).  The wine list, while small and about $8/glass, had some lovely little surprises that I had never encountered before.  The Portuguese white wine I had was spectacular.  It exploded tart citrus in the mouth with a clean stainless steel finish.  Just lovely and perfect for a sweltering night. There were plantain chips served with a homemade mojito sauce to snack on while we waited for our orders.  When I asked about the sauce I learned it was made of just garlic, salt, and pepper.  I suspect the server neglected to mention the crack that must be in it.  I just wanted to pour it directly into my mouth, onto my face, and let it dribble down my body.  It's that good. Our empanadas arrived next and both my friend and I were surprised at their size. Being $1.50 each ($1 empanadas are happy hour prices) we expected them to be the size of a baby's fist.  These were the size of my fist (admittedly, I have really small hands but i'm an adult, gosh darn it!)  we thought empanadas this size should be $3 each so happy as clams, we tucked in.  They were delicious!  My friend had one of each and reported that the beef ones had olives mixed in.  The chicken ones were familiarly spiced shredded chicken and also done very well.  The cheese ones though, stole the freaking show.  The cheese had this slight lemon tang to them that just made them so awesome, I cannot begin to do them justice.  Just go and try them, seriously!!  AMAZING!! Our main courses came out next and to be honest, the 2 empanadas I had could have been a meal for me, so i could have stopped.  My friend felt the same about her 3 but the entrees smelled so good and we were so happy with the food so far so we dove in anyway.   She had the Chicharrones De Cerdo ($9.50).  It's tender chunks of fried pork  with sauteed vegetables and she loved it.  I got the Rabo De Res Guisado ($11.50) with concon and beans.   As a Korean American, I grew up with oxtail stews and I love the rice that gets stuck to the bottom of the rice pot (which is what concon is).  The oxtail meat was tender and flavorful but a bit too salty for me. I helped it down with a nice glass of fruity spanish red wine.  I had never had concon before so it was a little bit of a letdown for me as I was expecting it to have more crispy bits of toasted rice in it but drowned in the beans and sauce, it pleasingly became a chewy rice and beans side.  Overall, the food was delicious and I almost exploded trying to shovel it all in my mouth over the protests of my already full stomach.Neither my friend nor I could actually finish our meals so we packed up the remaining halves to take home.  The server asked if we were interested in dessert but we were way too full to even contemplate it.  Our original plan was to go to Ample Hills for dessert but for the first time in my life, I didn't have room for ice cream after dinner.When we were leaving the server asked if we lived in the area and I said, I did.  He handed me the delivery menu and then told me that they were launching their dining menu, next week.  I was confused and asked ""then what did we just have?""  He explained that they were currently serving their to-go and delivery menu but that they were planning a separate dine-in menu.  I asked if they were planning more vegetarian options and the server said yes.  I sincerely hope so as I rarely eat meat (7th time in the past 12 months) and 1 of 2 serious downsides to this place is how few vegetarian options there are right now (only 3 starters have the (v) and none of the main dishes are veggie friendly) .  They have a DJ here.  Odd choice but I guess it could go with the hipster vibe.  However, the music was just too loud for me.  Old fogey that I am at 31....I totally need to try their breakfasts.  Their delivery menu shows $5 veggie omelettes with toast and homefries/grits.  I don't know the last time I saw a $5 omelette!?!",5.0
"This is a great little spot, very cozy with a great atmosphere. The food was good, nothing special and the service was not the greatest.

"Just a quick update: the owner emailed me through yelp (glad to see that she checks out the reviews about her place!), and apologized for our experience.

"I'm sorry if this is the first bad review but I have to do it. About two years ago this restaurant caught fire. But Before that it was a Ma & Pop authentic Puerto Rican & Spanish diner that served the community. When it burned the owners thought this was an opportunity to upgrade the restaurant to fit in with a changing neighborhood. So, when I went back to visit the remodeled restaurant I noticed the same family working, the menu items were the same(prices were slightly higher but not too bad)so I guess the only thing that drastically  changed was the decor.. I ordered a few things off the menu but I wanted to substitute starches for salad. And my husband only wanted vegetables. The (waitress) mama said ok. When I received the bill I was charged for the full meal plus the salad. And the vegetables that we were charged $7.00 for came on a small plate & were tasteless and totaled about 4. and when we get the bill its staggering. we were charged separately for everything. I show my receipt to the son(who seems to be running things). He apologizes and explains that his mom doesn't know how to work the new system. He looks at the bill and says I'll adjust it. He brings the bill back, looks at it again and realizes we were over charged for something else. He makes another adjustment. But, because I liked the meat I ordered I say I'm going to try it again. I remember before the fire that I use to order breakfast from them that was pretty good. And I think there should be something on the menu for my husband to eat as well. We go in for breakfast.  Right off the bat the waitress's skills are lacking to say the least. It looks like she just rolled out of bed too(although it was 11am). It takes forever to get our order taken, and to get our coffee(the first thing you do is get NYorkers their coffee)!
