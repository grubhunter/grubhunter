"Based on 2 of my visits -This restaurant is great. Better than any blue ribbon in manhattan by far.I love their bread & butter, oysters, clams - Steak tartar is absolutely delicious, also steamed clams, paella & bone marrow fried rice..Even the drinks are great.Every dish was delicious and it's so rare to find a restaurant like that in Brooklyn.So glad to have this place so close by!",5.0
"I have a bit of an addiction to Chicken Liver Mousse, so when I dropped into Blue Ribbon for a late night snack my choice of appetizer was non-negotiable. It's difficult feel unbiased when you're reviewing just one dish, but I must say that my food was delicious. The texture was dense, but the flavor stayed on the right side of hearty. Simple, creamy, and strong without being overpowering. The bread wasn't as crisp as I would have liked, and the pickles were a bit one-note, but nothing stopped me from spooning up my mousse like ice cream.One person dining on a small plate is probably a sight to make any staff member's heart sink a little, but my waiter was more than polite, helping me choose a drink and even suggesting that I taste-test one of their crushed ice cocktails before committing myself. (He was right, it was far too sugary-sweet to pair well with liver.)In short: no regrets, and I'd be interested in returning for a full meal. For the moment, my verdict is satisfying, but not outstanding.",3.0
"Just like it's sister restaurants in Manhattan, Blue Ribbon offers a good variety of food, but nothing about the restaurant blew me away. I came here on a Wednesday evening at around 6:30pm and the restaurant was mostly empty, as expected on a weekday after work. There were a few parties eating at tables and a few people sitting at the bar, but it was mostly quiet inside. We had a big party with us, 9 in total, so they placed at a large booth.I've passed by Blue Ribbon Brooklyn many times before, but had never stepped in. From the outside, it looked rather ordinary and it was no different inside. There was nothing that stuck out in my mind when I walked in, other than the bar at the front and the 1 TV at the bar. Although the restaurant wasn't bustling, the service was quick and swift throughout the night and the waiters were very friendly to us. We received our menus and immediately began ordering. Since we were sharing family style, we decided to order a plethora of items:Kale Salad - Quinoa, Flax Seed, Avocado & Miso-Tahini Dressing- The salad made for a good start as it was light and small. Although the table agreed it was good, I felt it was a bit flavorless and dry on certain bites. If you're into eating real healthy this would be a dish for you.Braised Beef Brisket - Roasted Fennel , Carrots & Brussel Sprout- The brisket was served on this huge oval dish, but the serving was smaller than expected. The pieces didn't seem like they should have been served on such a large plate. There were about 15 slices thrown on top of each other with some sauce. Even though it didn't look that appetizing, it was soft, tender and pretty tasty.Fried Chicken - Mashed Potatoes & Collard Greens- I didn't get too much of the Fried Chicken, but from the small pieces I had a bite of, the meat was very juicy and the skin was extra crispy. There were 4 pieces to the order so there was plenty to go around. In addition, there was a side of mashed potatoes with gravy on top.Ox Tail Fried Rice - Daikon, Shiitake & Bone Marrow- A big favorite amongst my table, but it was OK for me. The fried rice was cooked very well and there was a fair amount of daikon, shiitake and bone marrow, but it was pretty plain for my pallet. In addition, this item was $24, which was a bit steep for a bowl of rice.Paella Basquez  - Clams, Mussels, Shrimp, Calamari, Chicken & Spicy Chicken Sausage- Not the best paella I had ever eaten, but it was still pretty dang good! The yellow rice was cooked perfectly and there was a ton of seafood mixed in. Every time I scooped up some rice a clam would always find its way onto my plate! I loved that they spared no seafood ingredient for this huge dish.Grilled Branzino- The fish was a thing of beauty! In terms of presentation, it stole the show at our table. It was one huge branzino sitting peacefully on a plate ready to be devoured! Although it was very boney inside, the fish meat was soft and fresh. This one was a real winner.Grilled Asparagus - There's not much to say about grilled asparagus, but these were a nice change to all of the meat and carbs we were eating. The asparagus was very flavorful and my one gripe was that I wish the side was bigger!Blue Ribbon definitely has some things going for it, but at the same time it could do better. There was nothing that was bad, experience wise. However, it feels like they don't take that risk to up their game either. With that said, the food is priced a bit higher than I'd expect based on the quality. Blue Ribbon makes for a good quiet dinner, just don't expect extremely stunning food or presentation.",3.0
"Came here with a Blue Ribbon gift certificate, specifically for this Park Slope location.  It seems to be very popular with families, and they are equipped for children, with high chairs, plastic drink tumblers, and crayons.  My one year-old nephew had a great time even in this very adult space with dim lighting.  Service was attentive and helpful, too.  We brought a cake for a special celebration, and they tucked it away in the kitchen before bringing it out at the end of our meal, lit with candles!    The food is pretty spectacular at Blue Ribbon.  They have a huge range of things on their menu (static1.squarespace.com/…) that will please seafood lovers (absolutely get the FRIED OYSTERS), carnivores (Steak, Surf & Turf), kids, and those looking for a quick bite (burger & fries), or a lite bite (their Kale salad is great).  That said, on pricing, you'd be able to make it work within your budgetary limits.  The portions though not enormous, are good for sharing among a group of maybe 4 adults, which goes for apps as well as main dishes.  They have a full bar, impressive wine list, a fun cocktail menu, and lots of dessert options.  It's a really convenient place to dine as the food comes out quickly, they take reservations and accept credit cards.",4.0
"I definitely plan on giving this place a second chance. I came here on a date night and loved the atmosphere. It was cute and the music was great. We also had great service.Now they lost stars with my food. I ordered the salmon with I believe dill sauce. I ask to have the sauce on the said but when my food arrived it was drenched in sauce. I tasted it and did not like it, which is why I originally asked to have it on the side. The server apologized and sent out for a new one. When the new one arrived it was very charred on the outside. I suffered through A.) because there was enough champagne in my system and B.) I didn't want to wait again.Aside from that this place was good. Will go back eventually.",3.0
"Came here with my girlfriend for Valentine's day. The decor is very nice, and makes for a great spot for a romantic date or for a special occasion. We didn't actually have a reservation, but showed up 15 minutes after the restaurant open and still managed to get seated. For appetizers we ordered oysters (just to try), and the baked clams. Both of us didn't like the oysters but that was because it was our first time trying them, and we just weren't fond of them. ( great opportunity to try them though because you can order as you want with no minimum). The baked clams were exceptional!! Amazing flavor and the added bacon bits really were a nice touch. I had the NY strip for my entree and my gf ordered the catfish. I absolutely loved my steak. I ordered it cooked medium and it was perfect. Very tasty and nicely done. My girlfriend also liked her catfish and was delighted with her dish. I'd definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone celebrating a special occasion or looking for a nice date spot.",5.0
"This spot is back on my list of places to go. For a while last year service was rocky (orders cooked incorrectly and some requests just simply forgotten). The last few times, however, the service has been top notch. On my most recent visit a man who appeared to be a manager went from table to table asking how things were and if everything had been prepared properly.I'd give them 5 stars, but under the new management kids meal desserts are smaller.",4.0
"Amazing. Blue Ribbon has an incredible menu with wonderful service. My friend and I came here on a Saturday night. It wasn't packed but it was certainly busy. We sat instead by the bar. Right now hey have Oktoberfest going on with a special menu and special beers. I loved the German beer - it looks dark like Guinness but it tastes surprisingly mellow and semi light, great flavor to it. Now onto the food -  we made a meal out of appetizers: Beef Marrow and Oxtail Marmalade: Just about the best food you could possibly eat. Best bone marrow ever. DELICIOUS. Fried Oysters: My friend was hesitant to order this as he usually does not like fried oysters, but even he was impressed with this. Well worth it. They were wonderfully plated and just delicious overall. Another standout choice. Special Oktoberfest menu: Weiss Sausage: Surprisingly good! It looks a little underwhelming but the taste is quite there. A tad on the salty side, but hey it's a sausage! Banana Walnut Bread Pudding: Wow was this delicious. I am not a fan of anything banana but this was amazing. Very light banana taste, very tasty. I loved all parts of my meal here at Blue Ribbon Brasserie. At one point though, we ordered something on the new Oktoberfest menu but didn't like it as much. However, our waiter noticed ( since we finished all bits and pieces of other other entress and left this largely untouched) and asked what was the matter. Once we told him we were a little less enthused about this dish, he took if off our bill and asked us to order something different instead. Wonderful service! Amazing food, great service. Not much more you need!",5.0
Awesome place! Great service and Great food ! Southern fried chicken is worth every penny! I will definitely be back.,5.0
"Came for a birthday dinner for my dad. It was fantastic! food is always legit at Blue Ribbon. This is my first time in the brooklyn location. I'll say that though that bone marrow is better at their bakery location in west village because of the bacon bread but other than that; everything was awesome!To start, we had:The ribs, Sauteed Calamari, Fried Oysters, Bone Marrow Main:Red Trout, Paella Basquez (this can feed 3!!!) and NY StripDessert:We split the chocolate and banana bread pudding into one order (1/2 of each) which comes with ice cream and also got their special sundae which was a tres leches cake with ice cream and espresso. for 5 people we were stuffed to the brim and had half the order of the paella to take home. (which was phenominal btw) lots of seafood!",5.0

"I know, I know...my second update and still 5 stars?!?!?! Listen folks you have to give credit where credit is due and I just wanted to let you know a few things about my girlfriends birthday dinner last week:1) Blue Ribbon Brooklyn is still just as awesome as it was the last time I was there!!! 2) Our server Andrew was absolutely amazing (Adam is no longer there). His personality, attentiveness, knowledge of the menu, honesty and suggestions makes him my new favorite! Blue Ribbon knows how to pick top notch servers! Seriously!!!3) The floor manager (I think?...cutie pie with nice smile and glasses) must have been paying close attention to our reactions after we received our food because after I took one bite of my New York Strip and realized it was over cooked (I love my steak medium and this was medium well to well done) it's very possible that made a face of some kind - I know that I definitely cut into the steak again to examine the cook on it but whatever I did caught his attention IMMEDiATELY and he came to ask about the steak! After I explained the issue with the temperature, he collected my plate and had the kitchen re-fire a new steak!!! The second attempt at my medium steak was a success and I truly appreciate him for taking care of me and my entire table!!4) The sangria is a must as well as their desserts... Please do yourself a favor and go. Blue Ribbon Brooklyn is truly a gem!!",5.0
"I came here last night with my boyfriend and his family (about 7 of us) with no reservation. We got seated within 30 minutes, which was awesome, no complaints there.

I tried a bite of the Ny strip steak, it was so flavorful and cooked to perfection. Besides the food, service was great and the staff were so hospitable.

"Went here for an early birthday dinner with my family, and the service was spectacular. Friendly, warm, sweet, and understanding of a toddler's nature, and also understanding of an elderly person's nature (wish my mom read Yelp), which is sometimes very comparable to a toddler's nature. The vibe was just right for eating elegant fare but still very kid-friendly. How'd they do that? I'm always wowed by an upscale restaurant that has fun catering to children. Not only crayons and coloring sheets, but also a free side and free dessert, with his chicken and vegetable paella. The kid's menu, probably the best that we've seen so far, looked so good that I considered ordering from it for myself.But, and imagine me saying this in a hushed tone, my lobster was a tad over. Bite after bite was chewier and chewier, not rubbery but definitely not the tender, melt-in-your-mouth lusciousness I'd hoped. And my mom said her shrimp were rubbery. I think they may have been a bit under cooked. The flavors were on point though. And the portions were a nice size.Dessert--we had to order two hot fudge sundays after watching a 2-year-old endlessly pick at his--was also a bit lacking. Fudge, yes but no where near hot and that is the best part of a hot fudge sundae.Will definitely return and update and hopefully give a higher rating.",3.0

Brussel sprouts were absolutely too salty.Spiked Apple cider- Delicious! Brought me right back to the holidays with the stick of cinnamon floating in the drink.Friendly, attentive service.

It wasn't until 20 minutes had passed, and flagging down the manager that we had realized that the bottle of wine in question must have been warm before having been ordered. The manager tried to give us the go-around, but we asked that he just bring the bottle out immediately as we had been waiting 30 minutes at this point. This was the only ugly mark on their otherwise good track record.",3.0
"This was memorably bad! I normally prefer Brooklyn to Manhattan for most things when given a choice, but in this case the Manhattan location wins hands down.

I think the Manhattan location may have been the original and although Blue Ribbon is a big and diverse chain now, pretty much none of the other restaurants I have been to even come close to the Manhattan location. The food was somehow just lacking, the service mediocre and the decor forgettable. Meh, go to Manhattan instead.",2.0

If you are an oyster fan I suggest you skip this place. I say this because their oyster happy hour which used to feature wonderful oysters from Maine and Canada now offer bivalves from Connecticut.

"I came here for my partner's birthday and could not have been more disappointed. Our waiter was extremely uneducated about the menu and beer list. We would ask questions and kept being met with ""Let me go ask."" I inquired about a beer and he came back 10 minutes later with a half assed explanation. Mind you, we were one of two tables eating dinner at the time. When he did return, he gave me the wrong information and the beer was actually a dark stout and not a light wheat ale like he had guessed. It then took him another 10 minutes to get my partner is canned beer he ordered. We had to remind him we ordered it. Once again, one of two tables. The calamari was super chewy but did have a good squad. We ordered the salmon and friend chicken. The asparagus that came with the salmon was just steamed and the salmon itself was blah. The sauce here was also really good. The fried chicken was fine and the mashed potatoes were great. I'm afraid I missed what everyone else seems to love. If you want diner food, just go to a diner and save yourself about $100.",2.0

"Fun, and local spot. Food is flavorful and hearty. I prefer to go there with my SO, and order a handful of apps in lieu of entrees. My only complaint would be that the service, on occasion, can be lackluster.Example: we asked for a bottle of white wine, only to be told that it was not chilled and we'd have to wait a little while. It wasn't until 20 minutes had passed, and flagging down the manager that we had realized that the bottle of wine in question must have been warm before having been ordered. The manager tried to give us the go-around, but we asked that he just bring the bottle out immediately as we had been waiting 30 minutes at this point. This was the only ugly mark on their otherwise good track record.",3.0
"This was memorably bad! I normally prefer Brooklyn to Manhattan for most things when given a choice, but in this case the Manhattan location wins hands down. This place struck me as some kind of cruel joke, it has a similar menu to the one in Manhattan but somehow everything was just... Not that good. I think the Manhattan location may have been the original and although Blue Ribbon is a big and diverse chain now, pretty much none of the other restaurants I have been to even come close to the Manhattan location. The food was somehow just lacking, the service mediocre and the decor forgettable. Meh, go to Manhattan instead.",2.0

For dinner I got the Bronzino...it was delicious. Simple. Cooked perfectly. My only complaint is that I didn't get the fennel salad that comes with it...I was given mashed potatoes without even a heads up or warning....luckily, I don't discriminate. I love and welcome all versions of potato. Still, it would've been nice to say something. I got the chocolate cake for dessert and overall felt that I ate like a queen...or princess.

I expected a lot more form $15 French onion soup; unfortunately it was no better than what I've had before for half the price. Kids' menu is $14.50, but portions are tiny.  We did not get desert as the kids were getting restless and another 40 min of wait time would be deadly. I was unimpressed overall.

"I finally got to try this place out and I am in LOVEEE!Lately I've been craving bone marrow for some reason and turns out that Blue Ribbon is the only place in Brooklyn that serves it so I had to make a trip down here for some!I booked my reservation through yelp (of course) and when we arrived, the restaurant was packed. We had to wait about 5-10 minutes before getting seated. Our waiter was super friendly and helpful. He came to us every 15 minutes to see how we're doing.We ordered the Bone Marrow, Seafood Paella, Sauteed Calamari, and the Sea Bass.Bone Marrow -  came in three pieces, served with bread and  oxtail marmalade. The oxtail marmalade was delicious, I ate it by itself without bread. Sauteed Calamari - this dish was so popular on yelp, I had to order it! I'm usually a fan of fried foods so when I saw that it was Sauteed, I didn't think I'd enjoy it much. But surprisingly, it was delicious. I liked it more than the usual fried calamari. (Thank you Yelpers!)Seafood Paella - this dish is HUGE!! Definitely enough to feed two people. It was delicious as well, especially the chorizo that was in it. mmm.Sea Bass - There was a special for a whole fish but I didn't get it because I wouldn't be able to finish it so I opted for the regular one on the menu. It was served with a cold spinach salad on top and a buttery sauce. I didn't really enjoy this that much because the Sea Bass was overcooked and the spinach salad didn't compliment the dish. So I do not recommend this dish. Maybe the whole fish would be better? Overall, I give this place Four Stars for their delicious food and fantastic service! Cannot wait to come back again!",4.0

"My review is actually 3.50 stars, but not a 4 since 4 stars means I'll be back and I am not sure if I'll be back.  This place has been on my list of must try restaurants and I'm glad I finally went!  We arrived on a Thursday evening at 7pm and the restaurant was just beginning to fill up.  We had reservations so make sure you make reservations if you are going to go come on a busy night!  We were seated in the booths in the middle of the restaurant and those seats were so uncomfortable!  They really squeeze in the tables and when you sit in the booth, you sink down.  It was very uncomfortable to sit like that and enjoy my food.  We requested to move to a regular table with regular chairs, but our request was denied because they needed the tables for parties of 3+.  I totally understood, but a part of me can't help but wonder if my dining experience would have been better.  You are also really close to the tables next to you and you can hear their conversations.  It was also really hard to get in and out of the booths.  The server we got was very good.  The place is a perfect spot for a date night and they do dim the lights as the evening goes on.  The bread we got was delicious and warm!  It leaves a lot of crumbs when you try to break it apart however.  Our waiter did not come to clean our table of the crumbs and I felt he should have so he could prepare our table for dinner.  The tables were so small we barely had room for our water and dishes much less a bowl for the shells from our paella.  Again, poor planning on Blue Ribbon's part.Paella - this dish was very good and they are generous in the portion size.  I liked it a lot, but it did not blow me away like other paella's I've had in the past.  I don't know what it was missing, but it was missing something.  This dish is good to share between two people and maybe an appetizer.  No need to order to entrees if you are going to get this between two people.Fried chicken - this dish was so disappointing.  The skin was tasty, but the meat itself was dry.  It was not juicy at all.  I requested to change my collard greens for the spinach and they messed up  my order.  Since the restaurant was so dark, it didn't occur to me it was collard greens until I already ate 1/4 of it.  I asked our waiter if it was spinach and he swore it was spinach, but it wasn't.  I didn't press the issue since I already ate some of it.  I know spinach and collard greens are similar looking, but I felt for the price I was paying, they shouldn't be messing up such a simple request.  Overall, this place was just okay.  I think I'll stick to Pio Pio or something for my paella and Flor de Mayo for my fried chicken.  The concept here is great, but I don't think they executed their menu effectively since the dishes we got seemed to be lacking in something.  They also failed in the choice of seating arrangements and for that alone, I won't be back.",3.0
"Came here for a mother's day eve dinner. When I first walked in, I felt a sense of sophistication and a romantic vibe. Lights are dim and they have a candle on every table. Decent size restaurant and very nice decorum. Every staff memeber I encountered had a pleasant attitude. Our waiter was very attentive and knowledgeable about the menu. I had the sweet and spicy catfish w/ mashed potatoes and collard greens,  which was delicious.  My fiancé had the steak with asparagus and mashed potatoes which was also delightful. My drink, ketel one and cranberry,  was not only good, but a decent size, especially for $10. For dessert, I had crème brûlée, also delicious. This was definitely a great dining experience and the only reason I didnt give it 5 stars is because it caters to kids as well and I want to see if my kids would enjoy it.",4.0

I'm usually a fan of fried foods so when I saw that it was Sauteed, I didn't think I'd enjoy it much. But surprisingly, it was delicious. I liked it more than the usual fried calamari. (Thank you Yelpers!)Seafood Paella - this dish is HUGE!! Definitely enough to feed two people. It was delicious as well, especially the chorizo that was in it. mmm.Sea Bass - There was a special for a whole fish but I didn't get it because I wouldn't be able to finish it so I opted for the regular one on the menu. It was served with a cold spinach salad on top and a buttery sauce. I didn't really enjoy this that much because the Sea Bass was overcooked and the spinach salad didn't compliment the dish. So I do not recommend this dish. Maybe the whole fish would be better? Overall, I give this place Four Stars for their delicious food and fantastic service! Cannot wait to come back again!",4.0
"Maybe I ordered the wrong thing? A friend and I had dinner here recently and shared a paella and the corn succotash. The paella was large, certainly enough for two, and not at all skimpy on the seafood. But on the whole, the paella was lackluster, not particularly flavorful or memorable. The corn succotash was surprisingly good as was the service, but neither was good enough to make me want to rush back anytime soon.",3.0

"Thanksgiving dinner here tonight.   Roasted turkey  with apple-bacon caramelized brussel sprouts,  sweet potatoes and cranberries.   All excellent.  Served with plenty of bread.   Buffalo cauliflower starter was special.  Four star food but five star service and management.   A favorite,  must return spot for me.",5.0
"Me and my friends went to this restaurant on a Friday night bc our original planned failed.  First of all parking is sooo easy & that's a plus.  We went in and was seated right away ! #Impressive  .. I like this restaurant and the atmosphere, it's more spacious than most Brooklyn restaurants I've been to.  The only thing with the seating I didn't like was that the table weren't big enough, so we asked for a bigger table.     The menu to me is a bit pricy.  The entrees weren't enticing to me so I ordered off the appetizer menu.  I ordered the salt & pepper shrimp which was more salt than pepper so I guzzled down at least 3 glass of water  .. We didn't enjoy our meal at all.  The serving bread was good tho lolI don't think we're gonna come back here",2.0
"Wow. So disappointing. We hadn't been in a couple of years, and this location hasn't just gone downhill, it's gone off the cliff. Chilled seafood appetizer was tasteless, the ""Greek"" salad was romaine and cucumbers, and I stupidly ordered lobster (I know...) and it cost $40 AND WAS CLEARLY FROZEN!!!You can have two much better meals at any number of places within blocks for the price of one here. A must to avoid",1.0
"My review is actually 3.50 stars, but not a 4 since 4 stars means I'll be back and I am not sure if I'll be back.  This place has been on my list of must try restaurants and I'm glad I finally went!  We arrived on a Thursday evening at 7pm and the restaurant was just beginning to fill up.  We had reservations so make sure you make reservations if you are going to go come on a busy night!  We were seated in the booths in the middle of the restaurant and those seats were so uncomfortable!  They really squeeze in the tables and when you sit in the booth, you sink down.  It was very uncomfortable to sit like that and enjoy my food.  We requested to move to a regular table with regular chairs, but our request was denied because they needed the tables for parties of 3+.  I totally understood, but a part of me can't help but wonder if my dining experience would have been better.  You are also really close to the tables next to you and you can hear their conversations.  It was also really hard to get in and out of the booths.  The server we got was very good.  The place is a perfect spot for a date night and they do dim the lights as the evening goes on.  The bread we got was delicious and warm!  It leaves a lot of crumbs when you try to break it apart however.  Our waiter did not come to clean our table of the crumbs and I felt he should have so he could prepare our table for dinner.  The tables were so small we barely had room for our water and dishes much less a bowl for the shells from our paella.  Again, poor planning on Blue Ribbon's part.Paella - this dish was very good and they are generous in the portion size.  I liked it a lot, but it did not blow me away like other paella's I've had in the past.  I don't know what it was missing, but it was missing something.  This dish is good to share between two people and maybe an appetizer.  No need to order to entrees if you are going to get this between two people.Fried chicken - this dish was so disappointing.  The skin was tasty, but the meat itself was dry.  It was not juicy at all.  I requested to change my collard greens for the spinach and they messed up  my order.  Since the restaurant was so dark, it didn't occur to me it was collard greens until I already ate 1/4 of it.  I asked our waiter if it was spinach and he swore it was spinach, but it wasn't.  I didn't press the issue since I already ate some of it.  I know spinach and collard greens are similar looking, but I felt for the price I was paying, they shouldn't be messing up such a simple request.  Overall, this place was just okay.  I think I'll stick to Pio Pio or something for my paella and Flor de Mayo for my fried chicken.  The concept here is great, but I don't think they executed their menu effectively since the dishes we got seemed to be lacking in something.  They also failed in the choice of seating arrangements and for that alone, I won't be back.",3.0
"Came here for a mother's day eve dinner. When I first walked in, I felt a sense of sophistication and a romantic vibe. Lights are dim and they have a candle on every table. Decent size restaurant and very nice decorum. Every staff memeber I encountered had a pleasant attitude. Our waiter was very attentive and knowledgeable about the menu. I had the sweet and spicy catfish w/ mashed potatoes and collard greens,  which was delicious.  My fiancé had the steak with asparagus and mashed potatoes which was also delightful. My drink, ketel one and cranberry,  was not only good, but a decent size, especially for $10. For dessert, I had crème brûlée, also delicious. This was definitely a great dining experience and the only reason I didnt give it 5 stars is because it caters to kids as well and I want to see if my kids would enjoy it.",4.0
"The service wAs good but the rest was blah. I should have done more research because I really wanted to eat at Blue Ribbon Sushi but alas it's gone ( haven't been there in quite a long time). I have been to this particular restaurant at least 5-7 times over the last few years. Should have read the Yelp reviews before returning. I feel they've become nothing more than the neighborhood diner with midtown Manhattan prices ( ridiculous ). I don't mind the price tag when the food is worth it. The perogies were more like potstickers, the bone marrow oxtail jam was overly sweet and unfortunately for me the special dessert wasn't very special. The seafood tower @ $91.00 wasn't bad. All in all if you have steaks advertised on your window you should have more than one choice on the menu, $5.00 for one scoop of ice cream.......ridiculous!!!

Then he tried it and was like, oh nope, they kind of just dumped 1.5 cans into this dish.  I had wine and the bf had beer.  Needless to say, dinner = underwhelming and very expensive.The bf liked the steak but thought it was not worth what it was priced.

(I did enjoy the sauces that came with it)Baked Clams- These were small, and had too much bacon (I know there can never be too much bacon but in this case it overpowered the baked clam).New York Strip Steak- I described this as something I would say was good if I had it at a wedding, and knew it was mass produced. However knowing it was individually made for us at that moment...well it fell short. Salmon- This was the most disappointing,  absolutely no flavor and in my opinion a little fishy. The mustard sauce looked like mayo and did nothing to add flavor. Shrimp Provencal- This was absolutely delightful. I was on the fence on whether or not I would enjoy this dish, however the cheese filling in the ravioli was delicious!There was also an incident that I can only describe as ""The most awkward conversation of all time""  that happened concerning our drinks.When our drinks arrived we felt that they were watered down. We told our waiter, and moments later we were greeted by someone I will assume is the manager. He informed us that their drinks were all measured and that we were... for lack of better words.. completely wrong about its content . To which I responded with ""Lets agree to disagree"", and this led to what felt like a 2-3 minute conversation /stare off that felt uncomfortable.I understand the business aspect of it, but if a customer is not happy with a product maybe you should, I don't know....ask if they would like something else? Maybe not make them feel uncomfortable for the rest of the night by having this confrontational conversation?

Shrimp cocktail - Large pieces of cleaned and shell off shrimp, always a great appetizer.2. Wakame salad - It's seaweed salad, another great choice for appetizers. 3. Cream of tomato soup - Very strong taste of the tomato and creamy. Entrée4. Sushi & sashimi - Pretty fresh sushi & sashimi, but it wouldn't be my to go spot.5.

Salmon with asparagus, crispy potato & mustard sauce - A big piece of well-grilled salmon.7. Grilled half chicken with mashed potatoes & spinach - This dish was bland.Dessert8. Chocolate bread pudding - It's basically bread, ice cream, and fudge, which was ok. 9. Lemon sorbet & strawberry ice cream, very standard dessert options could've been better. From their regular menu:10. Firefly squid, pricey and was disappointed by the small portions.11. Blue ribbon roll that consist of 1/2 lobster, shiso & black caviar - I thought was just okay and it was also pricey.After trying out a variety of dishes I wasn't impressed.

Steak was cooked perfectly the accompanying fries and green beans were cooked and seasoned perfectly. My wife had the salmon and she enjoyed it.

"Heeding Rex's desire to read it, I have decided to write this review before the rest of my pending reviews.  Disclaimers: 1) I have eaten here before-at this location and the one on Sullivan St.- and I really did love it.  Both times.  2) The food was really good.  Like awesome good.   So, now that I got that out of the way, I can move on to the bigger and better things.  We arrived for dinner at about 7:45 and it was bustling, but not too busy.  I love feeling like a restaurant has a vibe, with regulars, a few couples, and lots of people sitting at the bar.  We were seated right away, and although the hostess seemed surprised at our request for her to hang our coats, she did so quite graciously.As we perused our menus, I was evilly justifying a decadent meal consisting of marrow followed by braised short ribs.  Come on, it was Tuesday after all.  That's a good day for bone marrow.  Any day is a good day for ribs.  Anyway, they were out of both.  My eyes moistened but I decided that it was a good thing.  I didnt really NEED it.  Just wanted it.  So, going back to the meal, after we ordered our drinks, and I was duly impressed with Rex being a Scotch drinker, we decided to start with the special of shrimp and eggs and oysters.   I was swayed towards the skate since apparently its fresher than salmon, and Rex caved for the fried chicken.  We dug into the bread and chatted, while waiting for our food.  I was surprised to see the waiter come up with our main dishes, about 20 minutes later.  We considered having them taken down to sit under a lamp and wait for us to receive and eat our starters, but we decided to dig right in.  We asked for the shrimp but nixed the oysters.  The food was truly excellent.  The skate was lightly fried, and the bacon, potato and shrimp it came with was nothing short of stellar.  The fried chicken was perfect, hot, well breaded and not greasy.  I was so full but I still ate my half of the shrimp, and it was spicy and fresh.  They made a great effort, comping the shrimp dish and getting us creme brulee on the house for dessert.  I think a lot should be said for making the effort to clean up when a mistake has been made.  In life. In food. In everything. I will definitely be back, and totally recommend this place for a date, hanging out at the bar, or just come get oxtail fried rice, marrow, and braised short ribs.  Fried chicken.  Desserts.  You get the picture.  You'll thank me later.",4.0
"Wow.  Obnoxious.  Anyone in the South Slope should definitely boycott this establishment.  The food is good, although overpriced.  But they refuse to deliver South of 15th St because it is a ""bad neighborhood.""  Allen, the manager, said he would deliver to 15th St and 8th Ave but not 16th and 5th Avenue because his drivers have been mugged when going all the way to 16th St.  16th St and 5th Ave is much much closer to Blue Ribbon than 8th Ave and 15th St.  We were about to order $200 worth of food for delivery because we just had a newborn but Allen would not make an exception because it is a bad neighborhood. What an......!!!  Please boycott.  Their snobbiness is exactly when our neighborhoods become obnoxious rather than cool.  Say no to Blue Ribbon and don't buy their food at Brooklyn Bowl either!!!",1.0

"Heeding Rex's desire to read it, I have decided to write this review before the rest of my pending reviews.  Disclaimers: 1) I have eaten here before-at this location and the one on Sullivan St.- and I really did love it.  Both times.  2) The food was really good.  Like awesome good.   So, now that I got that out of the way, I can move on to the bigger and better things.  We arrived for dinner at about 7:45 and it was bustling, but not too busy.  I love feeling like a restaurant has a vibe, with regulars, a few couples, and lots of people sitting at the bar.  We were seated right away, and although the hostess seemed surprised at our request for her to hang our coats, she did so quite graciously.As we perused our menus, I was evilly justifying a decadent meal consisting of marrow followed by braised short ribs.  Come on, it was Tuesday after all.  That's a good day for bone marrow.  Any day is a good day for ribs.  Anyway, they were out of both.  My eyes moistened but I decided that it was a good thing.  I didnt really NEED it.  Just wanted it.  So, going back to the meal, after we ordered our drinks, and I was duly impressed with Rex being a Scotch drinker, we decided to start with the special of shrimp and eggs and oysters.   I was swayed towards the skate since apparently its fresher than salmon, and Rex caved for the fried chicken.  We dug into the bread and chatted, while waiting for our food.  I was surprised to see the waiter come up with our main dishes, about 20 minutes later.  We considered having them taken down to sit under a lamp and wait for us to receive and eat our starters, but we decided to dig right in.  We asked for the shrimp but nixed the oysters.  The food was truly excellent.  The skate was lightly fried, and the bacon, potato and shrimp it came with was nothing short of stellar.  The fried chicken was perfect, hot, well breaded and not greasy.  I was so full but I still ate my half of the shrimp, and it was spicy and fresh.  They made a great effort, comping the shrimp dish and getting us creme brulee on the house for dessert.  I think a lot should be said for making the effort to clean up when a mistake has been made.  In life. In food. In everything. I will definitely be back, and totally recommend this place for a date, hanging out at the bar, or just come get oxtail fried rice, marrow, and braised short ribs.  Fried chicken.  Desserts.  You get the picture.  You'll thank me later.",4.0
"Wow.  Obnoxious.  Anyone in the South Slope should definitely boycott this establishment.  The food is good, although overpriced.  But they refuse to deliver South of 15th St because it is a ""bad neighborhood.""  Allen, the manager, said he would deliver to 15th St and 8th Ave but not 16th and 5th Avenue because his drivers have been mugged when going all the way to 16th St.  16th St and 5th Ave is much much closer to Blue Ribbon than 8th Ave and 15th St.  We were about to order $200 worth of food for delivery because we just had a newborn but Allen would not make an exception because it is a bad neighborhood. What an......!!!  Please boycott.  Their snobbiness is exactly when our neighborhoods become obnoxious rather than cool.  Say no to Blue Ribbon and don't buy their food at Brooklyn Bowl either!!!",1.0

I'll have sushi.No wait the fried chicken. It's so good.But the sushi. Never mind I'll have the sushi.I ate both because WHAT IS SELF CONTROL?!Even after merging the two restaurants their limited sushi menu is rock solid and probably the best you'll find on 5th ave. The Blue Ribbon chicken is their second rock star here and if you're feelin frisky order a couple of specialty nigiri as an app. It's a little sacrilegious but AMERICA!Sit at the bar if you can.,4.0
"Came here for drinks and dessert after an after dinner stroll. Had the chocolate ganache with ice cream and pumpkin spice cake. Both were good but neither blew me away. The ganache was just like any other chocolate ganache, dense and creamy. No complaints but not much inspiration either. Oo, but I did enjoy the toasted pumpkin seeds on the pumpkin cake. I thought that was a nice touch although the cake was cold. The pumpkin cake paired well with coffee...so it was overall satisfying but I've had more elaborate desserts for this price so perhaps that's part of the reason I give a three star rating. Other yelpers were raving and I didn't catch that they yelped mostly for dinner experiences and not dessert so i walked in with certain expectations...but on a side note, our bartender was cheerful and attentive!",3.0

"Pretty good! This was our second time, and  we brought our baby girl. The staff was very nice and accommodating about our giant stroller. The manager also came by several times to check on us and commented a few times on how cute our little girl is. What parent isn't going to call that good service? :-)The food was pretty good - we started with oysters, escargot, and chorizo and shrimp. The oysters were superb and the escargot should just be an entree. They were awwwwwwwesome. I wish I didn't have to share with the table! Seriously.We got the paella magdalena to share, along with grilled fish, a house salad, and sushi. The paella had chicken sausage in it, so it tasted a bit off, in my opinion. I prefer chorizo in my paella. It also tasted coconutty, like they used coconut oil. The only times I've had paella were in Spain and New Orleans, so my palette is limited. It was yum nonetheless. The grilled fish was very tasty and the house salad was a very generous portion. The sushi my husband had and he said it was good. All in all, it was a great night. I'd recommend this place for a nice date or celebratory dinner with friends. Its not hard to get a reservation on a Friday or Saturday night and the service is terrific.",5.0
"This is my first time dining here. My boyfriend took me here after a long day of work and school, plus it was our anniversay, so it was definitely a treat to come here unplanned. Service: We were seated right away without reservations. Our waiter was attentive and patient with us while we took forever to decide what to eat since my boyfriend wasn't in the mood for sushi. After the waiter took our order, we got our food in a timely manner.Food: The beef marrow and oxtail marmalade was delicious. I enjoyed the oxtail marmalade so much I wanted to lick the plate. The beef marrow was bit small but the oxtail marmalade definitely made up for it.The steak tartare was fresh and a bit salty but it was pretty good still with the chips. The sweet and spicy cat fish was a bit disappointing, but it wasn't too bad to try. The fried collard greens and mash potatoes helped compliment the dish a lot. Atmosphere: It was pretty romantic in there. The bar has a tv so you can have a drink and watch the games. Good place for date nights or just to hang out! Overall: I give it four stars since I was pretty happy with everything, and so was my significant other. Definitely recommended if you're in the neighborhood. I would come back again! Cheers!",4.0
"So sad to see them closed! Always a yummy choice, too bad I had to have dinner elsewhere! I used to come here for coffee and dessert all the time! I had the chocolate chip bread pudding which is sinfully delicious. I am pretty obsessed with it, have been for years, now I'm sad!",5.0
"This is actually a 3 1/2 star review, and I feel a little bad not giving them 4 stars. The food is really well made, and my friend who goes there often says it's their high level of consistency she loves. But while the food was really good, except for the pierogies it stopped just shy of that magical feeling that happens when something is incredible, and the food  being so expensive factors into that too. The hummus is fantastic- this is how it should taste. They add little red onion bits to it and that's so nice. But the pierogies were my absolute favorite thing. That may sound weird, and pierogies are usually very simple, but these were the best I've ever had. They were creamy and soft and came with a little sour cream and caramelized red onions. It was just so freaking good. For my entree I ordered the paella basquez. Unfortunately they were out of calamari when I went, so they threw in extra clams. The portion is very large and can definitely be split between two people. They're also not stingy with the seafood! The oxtail fried rice was great. It comes with marrow wrapped in an egg, which you mix all together to create magic. Service was good but very slow at times, especially towards the end of the night., The creme brulee took a good 15-20 minutes to come out and getting the check took another 15 minutes. We also had to ask twice. And while the decor is classy and warm, the seat cushions in the booths were torn up very badly in places. Seemed odd that they wouldn't have taken care of that. Background music is good. I'd love to come back",3.0
"Sweet Lou was there at the beginning, way back in 2001 when the Gowanus meant keeping a baseball bat by your door, and 5th avenue was chock full of Italians and considered ""edgy"". I've been a willing and able Blue Ribbon patron since that time. Great atmosphere, great drinks, great staff, great food and once I saw Rhea Pearlman on a Wednesday night. Couldn't keep me out of that place. 2AM Oysters with first dates. 5PM dinners with visiting relatives. Margaritas walking back from Staples on 3rd ave. All of it. Boom.Things started changing last year with a bellwether moment. They yanked the Blue Reuben off the menu. I looked the other way, onto a different part of the menu and relied on the chicken wings with the little miniburner in the polynesian leaf shape fixings carryall. Or the catfish sandwich that took the Blue Reuben's place. All good, but I sensed that our beloved Blue Ribbon had lost a step. Not lost a step like Kobe Bryant has to change his game and play more on the outside lost a step, but more like Grandma can't remember her pills and is only crashing the car a little bit lost a step.I gave it a few more shots in late 2012, early 2013, and started to look past the little things, and rely on the good memories, and still delicious wings, greek salad, and great bar service. 3.5 stars. Average, and not worth a rare Lou review.Last night was the last time I'll give them my money, time, attention, and love. It was the Altamont of my love affair with Blue Ribbon. Lou is a brusk and stoic man. But not without emotion. I'm moving beside myself, so please accept these bullet points as description of my experience last night as it's all I can muster right now. - We ordered a greek salad, wings, and cheeseburger and sat at the bar. - The bartender ate her dinner and chatted with her pals instead of taking a drink order.- The waiter was extremely and unsettingly weird and had projectile BO. So much so that I didn't want to interact with him. I wanted to ask the manager for a new waiter because I didn't want to end up on his ""list"" and in his freezer. But there wasn't a manager. Those two dudes who kinda looked the same, who had glasses and plaid shirts were no where to be found. The ship was rudderless. - I had to ask for utensils, napkins, and a plate. - The bread was still good, but they brought diner-style packaged butter that was oddly melted and unwrapped. Jammed in the little cup that they used to bring butter in during the good old days. The equivalent of a butter fuck you.- Figured I'd salvage the evening and get wings. NO MORE POLYNESIAN FIXINGS CARRY-ALL OR MINIBURNER. Just a few shitty wings thrown on a plate with a teaspoon of blue cheese something and oddball greens stuffed on top. If I wanted shitty wings I'd go to ANYWHERE ELSE.- There are no longer any sandwiches on the menu. No catfish, no brisket. - Settled on a burger, and it was definitely from a frozen patty. I could have made a better burger using a clothes iron.  The bun was stale, and the whole thing was cold. They're doing everything they can to go out of business. Bad menu changes, bad service, and worst of all? They're going to be closing at midnight from now on, even on weekends!Lou's recommendation? Let them go out of business.

Attentive and available without being annoying. We did not feel rushed at anytime and he made sure to stop by periodically to make sure we were okay. My Aunt has a dairy allergy and the waiter took the time to go through the menu with her and even went back to the kitchen to be 100% sure the dishes they discussed did not include dairy.

"One of our favorite spots. Great kids menu and the staff is accommodating. My daughter loves the cat fish sticks. I love the sweet and spicy catfish my husband loves the oxtail rice. Drinks, the honey margarita and sangria are the best.",4.0
"I have been to Blue Ribbon several times, and as a whole I'm a fan.  I do however feel that the appetizers fall a bit flat (haven't had one that really wowed me yet), so I have begun to stop order them.  I get a drink (maybe a few drinks ;) who's counting anyway), an entree, and a dessert (most of the time).  If I liked the appetizers better, this would more likely be a 5 star review because everything else is spot on.",4.0
This place must not have a real sushi chef anymore. I came here expecting good sushi but they have a very limited menu for fresh fish. I think they only have rolls now (no sushi/sashimi a la carte). I had two rolls and they both sucked. Really bad. Their saving grace (and the reason I didn't give them one star) is that their service is extremely courteous and their bone marrow is YUMMY. My boyfriend enjoyed his steak too. But I thought this place was known for their raw fish! So disappointed.,3.0
"I'm not gonna lie... I've been questioning when I was gonna come here, but finally came yesterday with my cousin, his girlfriend, and my fiancé and had deliciously good food and great service!  started with a large and tasty Ceasar salad (worth every cent). Ordered the grilled half chicken with mashed potatoes and spinach, fiancé had oxtail fried rice, cousin and his girlfriend ordered shrimp ribs, escargot and sushi to share.   While I don't eat red meat the ribs looked and smelled absolutely decadent! The escargot was not for me but the shrimp looked amazing as well.My fiancé loved his meal as well!  We finished our mains and went to dessert: I had a cappuccino, fiancé has banana split and cousins gf had the strawberry sundae. They both were to die for!  My fiancé and I don't usually go out and spend a lot on dinner but this place was worth the price!  HIGHLY recommended!",5.0

"Five stars for happy hour - let's just say it's been a while since i had fresh oysters in NYC.  The Malapeque oysters and Caraquet oysters were so amazingly delicious and fresh.  The oysters paired well with the happy hour white wine selection.  And to top it off, it was a great deal.  Now, I only ask that the happy hour be extended for another hour so we have enough time to come here from work in the city.  Three stars for dinner - I've been here twice for dinner and honestly not that impressed with the food.  It is not bad but it wasn't that memorable or spectacular.  I certainly expected better considering it is Blue Ribbon.In terms of the ambiance and design of the restaurant, it certainly is modern and spacious - although I heard they recently closed down the Sushi location next door and moved it over to this location.  I haven't visited since so I'm not sure if the layout has changed or if it became more crowded.If you go here, at least go for the happy hour - you won't be disappointed!",4.0
"Another awesome find! This place is superb! Food is excellent as well as the service! Place is pretty busy so go with reservations.

We had the steak tartar, raw bar, tomato bisque soup, brisket and the oh so yummy oxtail bone marrow fried rice!

"I had the greatest experience here. Made a reservation via urban spoon and was seated promptly. I ordered duck confit work potatoes and arugula salad. The flavored blended so well.

And for desert mmmmmm chocolate bread pudding with cream. Delicious.  I will definetly order visit again. I'm a sucker for great cuisine, ambiance and customer service. 5 stars!!!",5.0
The best sushi I have ever had...and I am a true seafood lover! The lobster and crab are expertly cooked and the flavour simply bursts through in their Blue Ribbon Roll. Don't be intimidated by the $24 price tag! It is worth every single hard earned penny. They have a great oyster special of $1.50 each until 6:30pm that is most worthy of a pitstop on your way home from work. And sit at the sushi bar! The chefs are brilliant. Will be back...probably by Monday.,5.0
One of my favorite restaurants! I've been coming to this place for over 13 years and the quality holds up. Great food and service. I particularly love the bone marrow appetizer and the fried chicken. And their chocolate chip bread pudding is the best dessert I've ever had in NYC.,5.0
"Blue Ribbon Brasserie coulda' been a contender. I wanted to love this place after discovering its existence on YELP.  I really did. Ate here for the first time last night with The Boyfriend for my birthday dinner so here goes. THE GOOD: My grilled New York Strip covered in sauteed onions and sliced mushrooms was flawless. It was one of those perfectly cooked steaks that make me wonder what I'm doing wrong at home in my own kitchen. The Pu Pu platter was a treat (sticky pork ribs, crispy fried wontons, mini egg rolls, candy-sweet, little chicken drumsticks and something awesome on skewers). My Dark and Stormy specialty drink put me right where I needed to be. THE BAD: Although our server was pleasant enough, no birthday girl wants to hear a checklist of the menu items that are unavailable for the night, ESPECIALLY if a few of those items are on her list of dishes that she MUST try. Garlic shrimp with chorizo, I'll taste you in my dreams... Also, I mentioned that it was my birthday  to a few of the restaurant staff (more than once) with the hopes that I would be surprised with a complimentary dessert and maybe the requisite lone birthday candle. I didn't even need the birthday serenade! As pricey as this place is I just thought it would be a nice touch. I guess no one here feels the same way I do.THE UGLY: This restaurant's look is like a gorgeous runway model with a missing front tooth. Soft, romantic lighting, with candles flickering on every table. Smooth hardwood floors, crisp white tablecloths, groovy funk and disco tunes wafting through the air and seats that look and feel like they belong in Fred Sanford's living room. The cushions were busted open in some places and dusty. When the hostess first sat us down, I could feel some of the wood framing poking out through the fabric and right against the back of my leg.Based on the overall deliciousness of my meal, I'm willing to give Blue Ribbon Brasserie another shot but they definitely need a to make a few minor (very minor) improvements.",3.0

My favorites are as follows:appetizers - chicken wings and shrimp with chorizoentrees - any of the paellas, Catfish, Braised Short Ribs, fried chickenAll I can say is take the time out to go see Blue Ribbon when you are in BK and enjoy some of the best food you will ever have!!!",5.0

Even better what if you want a little sushi and something else? On Friday we had a sushi regular as a app and I had the fried chicken and my wife had the hanger steak. It was amazing!",4.0
"The place is eye-candy. Hardwood floors, candles, and exposed brick. The seating was worn out and torn, which I thought was a little odd since so much effort was put into everything else. I got there early and waited at the bar for my date. The bartender was friendly and attentive. The manager made it a point to tell me to get my bag off the back of my chair and hang it off a hook, which I thought was a little rude and off-putting, but whatever. It didn't ruin my night.My date arrived. We finished our drinks at the bar and were seated promptly. I know it's summer in the city, and some humidity and mugginess is to be expected, but we were absolutely sweltering in there. My date had to ask the waiter if they could crank up the A/C a little. It didn't help.While service is attentive, at times, it could use a little polishing. Our waiter was friendly enough, but I couldn't get over how dirty his clothes were. Food stains all over his white shirt and black apron. I could barely make out any of the specials he was listing because his unkempt look was so distracting. And I can't even begin to imagine why he was so dirty because we had two or three different bus boys bringing out our food and clearing dishes. See, here's the thing. It's attentive, but not very friendly. They were taking away platters we were still eating from. There wasn't much communication. They just sorta showed up and started clearing things away, while we're sitting there chewing. Then, the crumb scraper comes out and we're lifting up our glasses to get out of their way. Weird.The food itself was pricey and a little on the petite side. Granted, we ordered lightly because it was just so hot in there, our appetites started to dwindle. We had the oysters to start. They were divine and one of  the specials of the day. It was a great suggestion made by our waiter. My date ordered a crab roll and I ordered the spider roll, both off the specials. If you know your way around sushi and rolls, you'd expect these to be monster-sized, thick rolls. These were petite, but executed very well. Very tasty, perfectly balanced, and the perfect mouthful. I just found them to be priced a little high for the portion sizes were get getting (based on what we ordered.)It was a light dinner for us both, but we weren't offered a dessert menu, coffee, or after-dinner drinks. After our plates were cleared away (in record time), they just sort of let us sit there and stew in this unbearable heat. It was fine, since we were sort of engrossed in each other and our conversation. However, it took some time to flag down anyone in order to get our check.So, here's the deal:Food: Good, but expensive.Service: Not exactly rude, but unpolished. Not very warm or friendly.There are so many great restaurants along 5th Ave. I think I'd like to try out every single one of them before coming back to Blue Ribbon.",2.0

Like i've said before i'm a blue ribbon ran. however this blue ribbon is even more casual then the location in manhattan. I love that this location is a combination of the brasserie and sushi. Its like 2 restaurants in one! however i dont like that they dont offer the foie gras here! They really need to put that on the menu. Also they have a great menu for children!,5.0
"Service was very good. The ribeye was good too, cooked exactly to temperature. Not good for vegetarians. The veggie burger left a lot to be desired, I ate it.... But would not order again.. 4 stars because the overall experience. Have been to other places much better in the same price range.",4.0
Nice ambiance and good service. But the food is overpriced for nothing special. For the same price as an entree here you can get a 3 or 5 course price fixe at a Michelin-rated restaurant.,3.0
"Food is average. My husband and I came on a Thursday night for dinner.As appetizers we ordered the ravioli especial and a sushi roll, which were amazing!As entree we ordered lobster and the NY steak. The Lobster tasted fresh and delicious, but can't say the same about the steak. We ordered th steak MR and it came more like M to MW (should have ordered R given the fact that the meat can be always cook more).For dessert we ordered the chocolate bruno which was okay.  It could have been better if the cake was warm so in that way with the ice cream melts on your mouth!Service was good and the ambience is perfect to take a date.",2.0
One of my favorite places in Brooklyn  and the service is is a10** cAnt ever go wrong with this place.,5.0
"A bit tired and standard decor, this place was probably awesome when it first opened in 2001. Now with the other Blue Ribbon restaurants all over NYC (and now Vegas and London) including the Brooklyn Bowl, their fried chicken and even wedge salad dishes can be had $5-10 cheaper at their other restaurants. Overall though, the beef ribs here were great, service awesome, just needs a bit more TLC to bring up the rating.",3.0
"Extraordinary! Food was on point and service was exactly as expected (considering the final bill).We had the sushi/sashimi combo...and everything was fresh and wonderful! My favorite was the salmon...yum! And the spicy scallop roll was probably the best I've ever had.The steamed lobster was delicious, but a bit too chewy for my taste. If it were higher quality/fresher, then it shouldn't be as rubbery...but the flavor was still good so I can't complain.The bone marrow fried rice was my favorite. It was so decadent and flavorful...I felt guilty eating every bite but it was totally worth it. If you love fried rice, you'll be blown away! I love that they even bring out some Sriracha with it! They know what they're doing.I had the house Pinot Noir and I thought it lacked a bit of flavor. It was lighter than how I like it, but it wasn't bad.Overall, LOVED our food and when I go back, I'll definitely be having more of their sushi and the fried rice. Decor can be improved as well as their wine.Big bill in the end, but worth the experience.",4.0

"Blue Ribbon, has to be one of my absolute favorite spots in Park Slope. If you are just a party of two, I recommend getting cozy by the bar and order the humming bird as a drink while chewing on some chicken wings, which can be grilled at the bar. Really cool spot, menu is great and most of all the bartenders are very friendly and make the bar scene a fun one.

Like i've said before i'm a blue ribbon ran. however this blue ribbon is even more casual then the location in manhattan. I love that this location is a combination of the brasserie and sushi. Its like 2 restaurants in one! however i dont like that they dont offer the foie gras here! They really need to put that on the menu. Also they have a great menu for children!,5.0
"Service was very good. The ribeye was good too, cooked exactly to temperature. Not good for vegetarians. The veggie burger left a lot to be desired, I ate it.... But would not order again.. 4 stars because the overall experience. Have been to other places much better in the same price range.",4.0
Nice ambiance and good service. But the food is overpriced for nothing special. For the same price as an entree here you can get a 3 or 5 course price fixe at a Michelin-rated restaurant.,3.0
"Food is average. My husband and I came on a Thursday night for dinner.As appetizers we ordered the ravioli especial and a sushi roll, which were amazing!As entree we ordered lobster and the NY steak. The Lobster tasted fresh and delicious, but can't say the same about the steak. We ordered th steak MR and it came more like M to MW (should have ordered R given the fact that the meat can be always cook more).For dessert we ordered the chocolate bruno which was okay.  It could have been better if the cake was warm so in that way with the ice cream melts on your mouth!Service was good and the ambience is perfect to take a date.",2.0
One of my favorite places in Brooklyn  and the service is is a10** cAnt ever go wrong with this place.,5.0
"A bit tired and standard decor, this place was probably awesome when it first opened in 2001. Now with the other Blue Ribbon restaurants all over NYC (and now Vegas and London) including the Brooklyn Bowl, their fried chicken and even wedge salad dishes can be had $5-10 cheaper at their other restaurants. Overall though, the beef ribs here were great, service awesome, just needs a bit more TLC to bring up the rating.",3.0
"Extraordinary! Food was on point and service was exactly as expected (considering the final bill).We had the sushi/sashimi combo...and everything was fresh and wonderful! My favorite was the salmon...yum! And the spicy scallop roll was probably the best I've ever had.The steamed lobster was delicious, but a bit too chewy for my taste. If it were higher quality/fresher, then it shouldn't be as rubbery...but the flavor was still good so I can't complain.The bone marrow fried rice was my favorite. It was so decadent and flavorful...I felt guilty eating every bite but it was totally worth it. If you love fried rice, you'll be blown away! I love that they even bring out some Sriracha with it! They know what they're doing.I had the house Pinot Noir and I thought it lacked a bit of flavor. It was lighter than how I like it, but it wasn't bad.Overall, LOVED our food and when I go back, I'll definitely be having more of their sushi and the fried rice. Decor can be improved as well as their wine.Big bill in the end, but worth the experience.",4.0
"Mmmm you can't go wrong with Blue Ribbon!Consistent, delicious comfort food with a really nice staff and chill vibe. The perfect date place! Fresh oysters and Great drinks too! Reasonably priced.Enough said, just go!",4.0
"Blue Ribbon, has to be one of my absolute favorite spots in Park Slope. If you are just a party of two, I recommend getting cozy by the bar and order the humming bird as a drink while chewing on some chicken wings, which can be grilled at the bar.

"I've been to Blue Ribbon Brooklyn a few times, most recently on special occasions as they're not what one would call cheap food. But as I've never, ever been disappointed by anything served, its well worth it. My husband and I made a reservation for my birthday dinner there and I went with a dish in mind; I had to try the beef marrow and oxtail marmalade. I LOVE oxtails and ossobuco and the appetizer was featured on 'The Best Thing I Ever Ate' on the Food Network. It was super tasty, mellow but flavorful with an extra punch if you sprinkle on some of the sea-salt that its served with. We also had the pu-pu platter which was a sampling of shrimp, skewered chicken, bbq ribs (a pleasant surprise), pierogies and spring rolls which were good, but not as amazing compared to the former dish. For the entree we shared the oxtail fried rice (yes, loooooove oxtail) which was nothing I could have imagined and quite delicious. For drinks, hubby had a Brooklyn lager and I had a French martini. Excellent, excellent stuff! Our server was attentive but not cloying and the atmosphere was quite and relaxing with none of the snooty that comes with some of the places that know how good their food is. Highly recommended.",5.0
"Pretty good food here with fresh ingredients. We had the bone marrow, warm goat cheese salad, onion soup, escargot, and oysters as appetizers for our table of 4. The bone marrow with the oxtail marmalade was excellent and oh so good. It was a huge portion and totally worth the price. The oysters were very fresh and they were nice and plump. Escargot was also really good and was a nice sized portion and they did not skimp on those tasty little snails. Onion soup was solid but my dad said he had had better at other restaurants. Goat cheese salad was also pretty solid. As for entrees, we had the fried chicken, rib eye, salmon and the duck confit. The duck confit was OK, there was more fat than meat but the sauce was very good. The fried chicken was a huge portion but it was not as special as some reviewers said it was. Salmon was just OK, portion size was very small. Rib eye was very tasty and cooked to perfection, sauce was excellent with the rib eye. Service here is impeccable and they were very attentive.",4.0
"I was not very impressed after my first visit so I gave it a second try. I wasnt impressed the second time either.  In general I would say blue ribbon is mediocre.  It is a bit pricey and over rated.  Some of the better parts of my dinner were the 1/2 bottle of red wine the waiter recommended, the bone marrow appetizer, and all 4 desserts my friends and I ordered.  I highly recommend the chocolate chip bread, banana walnut bread and the chocolate bruno.  Some of the things that were disappointing are the spicy lobster roll, french onion soup and the ribs.  The roll was $12 and came with 6 not so special pieces.  The soup was decent at most and was 13.75.  Im def not cheap and sometimes even spend my money stupidly, but thats crazy.  Isn't french onion soup, peasant soup... lastly, the ribs were 13.00 also and tasted like ribs from a local chinese food spot.  Im not saying I don't like ribs from the chinese food restaurant near my house, but thats not what I expected here.   The only differences were that there were only 4 and the price.   I can not say that my time at blue ribbon was bad, but it most definitely was not memorable or special.",3.0
"Although they've been around for a while, this was my first visit. It was super busy, so I suggest reservations. We waited for a table and it was worth it. The food was excellent. For a starter we chose oysters, fresh, clean and briny, served with the traditional accompaniments.  Next, we had requested salmon nigiri and even though it's not on the menu, they accommodated us.  The quality was incredible, it had a satisfying buttery quality. Two rolls followed and we added tobiko to the yellowtail, again no problem and both rolls were delicious. Sake was a little pricey, but again quality overshadowed the price.  Chocolate Bruno for desert, don't miss it!  We'll be back to explore their menu further.",4.0

"This is my second time at Blue Ribbon Brasserie and I would say my experience at Blur Ribbon is just mediocre. My boyfriend took me the first time about a year ago and we thought the the food was good but a little pricey. The desserts at Blue Ribbon are another story, they are exceptional. We decided to give Blue Ribbon a second chance and brought our friends this time. I have been wanting the French onion soup for a while now and I very much enjoyed it this past Saturday. We also ordered the bone marrow which I myself was not too crazy about, but It all depends on what you like. Along with the bone marrow we ordered the ribs. I am not saying they are bad, but they were typical ribs that you could get anywhere else. I was expecting something a little more different. The last meal we ordered was a roll of lobster sushi. I usually do not eat sushi, but even I could tell the that roll was way too small for how much it cost. One thing that I really enjoyed at Blue Ribbon are the desserts. They are off the hook! We ordered the Chocolate Bruno, chocolate bread pudding, banana bread pudding and the creme brûlée. All four desserts were fantastic. I especially enjoyed the chocolate Bruno because I LOVE chocolate mousse. The service at Blue Ribbon is pretty good. Our waiter came over several times to make sure that we had everything we needed. Overall I would say Blue Ribbon has decent food, but is a bit pricey for what you get!",3.0
Overpriced. Service was decent but was not blown away by the quality or preparation of the meat. Wouldn't return.,2.0
"Good solid meal all around.  The oysters were super clean and fresh.  If you order before 630p, they have a great special on the oysters.  We also had the smoked trout appetizer, which was very good and fun to eat.  The drinks were good and the service was very good.  I had the grilled half chicken which was very good, my daughter had the the shrimp roumelade, which was also tasty, my wife had the wild stripped bass wish was tender and flaky and my youngest had the penne.  To end the meal we had the chocolate chip bread pudding, which was more like chocolate chip brioche with ice cream on top, it was still tasty, but wasn't what is call a bread pudding.  My youngest had the strawberry sundae.  The price definitely fit the meal, so no complaints there.  Overall, we enjoyed our meal and we'll definitely be back.",4.0

"After coming here a few times, I'm finally writing a review. This review is the result of a group dinner to celebrate my sister's birthday. Needless to say, we were stuffed! We made reservations for 7:00pm and were seated promptly even though our party was not complete until 7:20pm.Appetizers: Chicken Liver Pate, Bone Marrow & Oxtail Marmalade and sauteed calamari.  The Pate was very rich and smooth. Absolutely deelish on the toast. The green apple salad complimented the pate perfectly. I've had the bone marrow twice before. The marrow is gooey and tastes like clumps of fat (in a yummy and good way). It goes well with the marmalade and a sprinkle of the sea salt. I didn't think much of the calamari. It was a bit on the salty side. Entrees: -40 oz. Rib Steak (medium) with mushrooms & fries. The steak was a lil' bit dry but the steak sauce was very tasty. It was excellent with the steak. The fries could have been crunchier. The mushrooms were good but that's certainly because it was sauteed with butter. -Sweet & Spicy Catfish. We (all 7 of us) agreed that the sweet and spicy catfish was okay.-Calves Liver.  The calves liver was only okay to me but if that's your kinda thing then I'm sure it's REAL good! -Land and Sea. The fried chciken was very flavorful. Whatever the breading/coating was, it was deeelicious.-Paella Basquez. The paella was delicious. The spicy chicken sausage gave it a slight kick. And a lot of seafood too. Very nice!And yes, we did still have room for dessert.-Banana Walnut Bread Pudding-Chocolate Chip Bread Pudding-Banana SplitThis part is a no brainer. FIVE STARS!

"Blue Ribbon, I'm reluctant to give you 4 stars since what I ordered was so hit or miss, but the hits really saved your ass.Hits:1. Spicy tuna roll - the best I've ever had. I didn't think a spicy tuna roll could be this good. Well worth the $11.2. Fried oyster roll - also very good. I don't have anything to compare this one to, but this roll was just about perfect.3. Tuna belly sashimi - melt-in-my-mouth good. Best part of my meal.Misses:1. Blue crab roll - MISTAKE. Stay away; this roll is just not good. They put shiso in it, which made it taste like soap. Even after removing the shiso, I thought the roll was very bland, just mediocre. Not worth $13.2. Alaskan salmon sashimi - Since I love salmon, I was hoping this would be even better than the tuna, but this was a huge letdown. I ignored that it was a poorly cut piece, but it was impossible to ignore the strands of fat, tissue, or whatever it was that was woven in there. Not cool.In the middle:My friend ordered the red trout. The green beans, mushrooms, almonds, and bacon they dress the fish with are awesome, but the fish itself was overcooked. My mother knows how to cook fish perfectly each time, so it may just be that I have exceptionally high expectations. Nonetheless, fish meat should just never be tough.",4.0
"Came here for dinner as part of Dine in Brooklyn partially because of a name. Apparently, everyone else wanted to eat there that Friday night as well. The restaurant takes reservations for parties of 5+. So couples like us had to wait 45 minutes that night. The decor and lighting of the restaurant was very romantic. Great to take someone out on a date.When you first get seated they present you with this circular loaf white bread (no wheat bread). Definitely listen to the special for tonight as we found out specials for the dine in brooklyn deal. Another surprise,for a fancy place, we were expecting meager portions. Instead, we got a very very good portion. We ordered the following: Apps: Shrimp cocktail and the Potato Gruyere crochet (special for that night). Entrees: Salmon and Braised Short Ribs. I enjoyed the shorts ribs as the meal just fell off. Also the side of mushroom, barley, and leek was extremely good (creamy and savory). Dessert: We had to try the Bread Pudding and the mango sorbet (there are different sorbet flavors). It was a traditional bread pudding with ice cream topped with melted chocolate.The mango sorbet was delicious. It had all the mango taste, not too sweet, and was creamy. Overall, this is a great date place except for the wait. The food was pretty good however didn't blow me off my chair. But for the price for dinner, it was worth it!",4.0
"I came on a Saturday night with the family (no reservations) and we were promptly seated. Started off with the oysters and bone marrow. Great starter choices. I ordered the special of the day - seafood gumbo. Very tasty and it was topped w/ a lump of fried crab meat. The cod was a miss in my opinion. Skip it! The salmon dish was a bit too creamy for me. The paella was loaded w/ seafood, sausage, and chicken. Mmmmm!! It was way too much food for the 4 of us. The paella was wrapped up to go and it was still good the next day.The house cocktails were strong!",4.0
"I had been waiting to get a chance to come here for awhile.  This week, with this location participating in Dine-In-Brooklyn, I had no excuse to delay any longer.  Gathering 4 of my friends, including my Yelp friend Sandy C., I tried to get a reservation by phone before heading out there.  That was a no go because I found out that they only do reservations by phone for parties of 5 or more.  Instead we waited an hour to get our table.  The wait wasn't too bad since Saturday was such a beautiful day and the neighborhood was a pleasure to walk around in to kill the time.  Sandy and I bought ourselves a cup of lemonade for 50 cents each from a little girl selling lemonade in front of a house a block away.  So cute.  This helped to quench our thirst for a little while.Love the ambiance of the place.  The staff was very polite and friendly.  They constantly checked up on us throughout the meal to make sure that we had everything we needed.  In fact, half the time, we had one of the managers waiting on us personally.  We know he was because I asked.For this meal, I had:Bread with butter on the side:   Wish I could figure out what kind of bread it was but boy was that a good loaf of bread.  A nice flaky, chewy exterior with very soft fluffy interior.  The best thing about the bread is that it comes with every meal and they constantly asked if we wanted more so it seems like they would continue to give you more till you say stop.Beef Marrow and Oxtail Marmalade:  Not part of the Dine-In-Brooklyn menu but common, how could I be at Blue Ribbon and not order this?  It was everything that people said it was.  Wow. Our whole group was in agreement, this was amazing.  The fatty marrow was so buttery soft and combined with the Oxtail Marmalade spread into the accompanying bread... words fail me ( which is not a good thing when I am trying to write a review but I can't help it with this dish ).Chicken Wings:  Such an understated name for this appetizer.  Again not part of the Dine-In-Brooklyn.  What we received was a dish of about 8 or 9 wings.  Lightly fried with a light smattering of a sweet BBQ sauce on them.  This comes with a small flaming burner where you could cook one wing at a time to make them crispier if you wanted to.  It was accompanied with a small cup of BBQ sauce, really good chunky blue cheese and cream cheese.  Such a fun dish, almost like having a small personal BBQ, and it was delicious too.Appetizer- Grilled Asparagus:  Simple but effective dish.    As the named implied, the asparagus is grilled.  Perfectly cooked with a light coating of balsamic vinaigrette.  Main- Sweet and Spicy Catfish:  The fish was nicely flaky yet soft.  It is only very mildly sweet and spicy.  Comes with a house made tartar sauce that I liked but only in very small dosage because it was so sharp tasting and would have over powered the delicate fish taste itself.  This was all accompanied by some perfectly done mashed potatoes and collard greens.Dessert- Chocolate Chip Bread Pudding:  No chips at all in this dessert.  No pudding either.  What it consists of was a very nice, soft pudding bread on the bottom, topped with a scoop of vanilla ice cream all covered in fudge.  The soft bread on the bottom combined with the pudding reminded me a little of Smores.  Highly recommended.This place was so good, and I enjoyed my experience so much, I am currently debating on whether I should go back there again before Dine-In-Brooklyn is over after four more days from this review.  If I don't make it back in time, I will have no trouble convincing myself to come back even without this event.  The Paella looks so good and besides, as other Yelpers mentioned, Bone Marrow, Bone Marrow, Bone Marrow.  I think I'm addicted.**************************I had a taste of Sandy's tomato soup (it was soooo amazingly creamy and delicious) and sorbet (tasted like a fluffier, frozen mango.  That is a good thing ).  Yummy.",5.0
"Located in a very cute neighborhood. Very lovely brownstone houses lined the streets with small cafes and restaurants along the avenue. Came here with Wing L. and friends. It was about an hour wait, so it wasn't too bad. The waitstaff are really friendly and attentive and the ambiance is pretty nice. We sat by the wine cellar towards the back of the restaurant, which was pretty nice. At the start they gave us a boule, which was pretty good. But it was hard to cut, almost felt like we were dissecting it. Wing L. kept talking about the infamous bone marrow, which I was iffy to try. But turns out it was really really delicious! The oxtail marmalade really goes well with the marrow. We also had an order of chicken wings, which was deliciously good! The wings were crispy and there's also a variety of cheeses on the same platter.On to the dine in Brooklyn course that I had. For appetizer I had the tomato soup, which was really creamy, yet so good! For my entree I had the sweet and spicy catfish, which to me the spiciness was very faint. But the fish itself was done really nicely - it is really flaky. And the mashed potatoes underneath the fish was very scrumptiously good! For dessert I had the mango sorbet, which I like very much too.I stole a bite of chocolate chip bread pudding from Wing L. and wow it was amazingly delicious! My mango sorbet was jealous of the chocolate chip bread pudding. I really like the food and I will come back again to try other foods on the menu.",5.0
"5 Stars for EXCELLENT service. My fiance and I dined at Blue Ribbon in Park Slope this past Christmas Eve, not surprisingly the place was packed but that didn't stop the general manager from coming over after he saw the wine we just ordered. He politely introduced himself and continued to give us some interesting notes on our wine. The food came in a timely fashion and it also was good. Our waiter visited our table frequently and was extremely knowledgable on the menu. Upon leaving, the manager greeted us near the door and thanked us for coming in. Well done guys, we'll be back.",5.0

"Blue Ribbon Brasserie is a diamond among gems for restaurants in the Park Slope neighborhood. It may go unnoticed by the casual non-Yelper walking by because there's no extravagant calling sign or flashy lights screaming for you to come in. Just another quaint place located on Fifth Ave. But because you're as fortunate to have discovered Yelp, you should definitely put this on your places to check out.Next to their sister restaurant Blue Ribbon Sushi, Brasserie serves a mix of modern American cuisine. There is a spacious waiting area and adjacent bar cozy enough to grab a drink, watch the game, without disturbing the rest of the diners. They did a really good job with the layout, placing the kitchen in the basement, and providing more ample space for dining without losing a sense of privacy. How? Through a half-wall partition and 3 semi-private areas for dining. It doesn't yell cafeteria which is good for a romantic evening without the loud echoing chatter. Seating varies from red velvet booth seats and wooden chairs against white linen-clothed tables. Exposed wooden beams stretch across the ceiling and an assortment of differently shaped lights on the walls and partitions. Bathrooms are a unique twist with single person closet-like stalls and a communal stone trough-like sink. Although it may sound a bit dressy, the ambiance is a bit more casual and relaxed. Through it all, it still maintained a certain level of family friendliness, with an extensive kid's menu. That was also proven with about 1/5 of the tables had children dining with their parents.For starters, I ordered 4 Malpeque Oysters which were a part of their Happy Hour Specials (until 6:30 pm): offering half-price ($1.50 Malpeque) oysters, $1.00 clams,  beer, and wine. The Malpeques, from off the coast of Nova Scotia / Prince Edward Island, were shiny and bright, and very fresh. They were served on a bed of ice and complemented with 3 sauces, a lemon wedge, and a small plate of thin crostini-like bread.I also ordered:- Steak Tartare ($15.50) - this raw beef shaped like a patty was delightfully seasoned and made for a very delectable appetizer. And the side of potato chip ridges tasted like they were homemade, right out of the deep fryer, with just the right amount of crunchiness and saltiness.- Skate ($28.00) sitting on a bed of cubed potatoes, bacon, chopped shrimp, and capers. The skate, which is a winged fish (think sort of like manta ray), was breaded and fried trapping in the juices, making for the fish to hold fairly well together yet still maintaining a moist and flaky texture. Add that to the bits of bacon, oh my gosh!! Mmmm...- Chocolate Chip Bread Pudding ($13.75) - Make sure to order this in advance as it takes about 10 minutes to prepare. Not really sure why they call it pudding, as it was more of a cake-like chocolate chip bread, topped with chocolate syrup and a scoop of melted ice cream. This was a tasty concoction but I went head over heels when I tried the Creme Brulee.- Creme Brulee ($10.00) - divine! The top was caramelized to perfection with a soft and custardy filling underneath. It was soo creamy and ooohh sooo heavenly. A must try!Service was exceptional here. Our waiter was friendly, attentive, funny, and down-to-earth. He didn't just serve us, but actually waited on us. I can't really put enough words to describe him and the rest of the staff, but they are representative among a handful of extremely pleasant waitstaff that I have experienced. For a restaurant of this caliber, I was taken by surprise. They had a waiter specializing in each thing from drinks, to water refills, to busboy, to entree serve, and even the manager came by to chitchat with us. They just seemed to do everything right, and would suddenly appear at the exact moment that you would think or expect them to come.Yelp, thank you for opening my horizons to places I would never otherwise venture to. And Blue Ribbon, thank you for such a wonderful meal. I will be sure to return and try your sister restaurant, Blue Ribbon Sushi!!",4.0
"Where do I start? I made a reservation at Blue RIbbon for my brother's birthday. I originally made it for 6 people, but because my family is prone to unexpected changes in plan, we ended up with 7 people. When I called to update the reservation, the manager who I spoke with not only gave me a hard time, but essentially refused to accomodate us or help me find any sort of solution. I offered to sit at two tables if need be--nope, those were only for walk-ins and couldn't make split 7 people into the two groups of 5 required for a reservation. Basically, he was not helpful in anyway, and  in the end, I just said ""ok, so I'm going to show up with 7 people, and we're just going to figure it out when we get there."" Totally unprofessional.So we get there. We have a table. It's a small table, even for a party of 6. It's 92 degrees outside and they don't seem to know how to turn their air conditioning up. Ugh.Besides that, the service was just so-so. Our server had no idea what was on the beer menu (and Blue Ribbon, you again let me down with a downright embarrassing beer list. How can you call yourself a real restaurant with nothing decent on tap?), and forgot to tell us the specials, until we asked multiple times. He forgot one of the appetizers we ordered (though it didn't show up on he bill), and our entrees took forever.The food was the one redeeming thing, and it was only ok. The appetizers were good--fried oysters, baked clams, Kanpachi Usuzukuri--but my salmon entree was uninspired.

"Server: How would you like that hanger steak cooked?The Girl: Medium, please.Peter D: Are you sure about that?Server: (glances at me) Hanger steak is a lean cut of meat, and if it is cooked anything past medium rare, it has a tendency to dry out.The Girl: OK. Medium rare then.YES. I love you, Blue Ribbon Brasserie Server. And I love your restaurant, too. As it was 7 pm on a Saturday night, we were fully prepared to sit at the bar, or wait up to an hour if necessary. However, the Patron Saint of Open Tables smiled upon us, and we were seated immediately. Drink service was prompt, and I was happy to see that their martini glasses are of the sensible, grounded variety. Prior to the hanger steak, we made a mess of our table as we gorged ourselves on a nice loaf of crusty bread, one order of the Pu Pu Platter and the String Bean Vinaigrette.The Pu Pu happily consisted of a BBQ Rib (juicy and succulent enough that I will most certainly return for a full order), a wing (also tasty, but not a Buffalo wing as the waiter had reported), delicious shrimp, and some unidentified straight meaty things on skewers that she repeatedly insisted were the best things on the platter. I enjoyed the accompanying BBQ sauce immensely, so much that I kept it around for her hanger steak, which was a great decision as it was perfectly executed, but needed a little kick of flavor.Sadly, the Poo Poo (see what I did there?) also included an awful pierogie, and a forgettable spring roll. It was also unclear why there was butter on the platter, and the flaming hibachi wasn't really necessary, and kept threatening to catch us on fire, so we blew it out. The String Bean Vinaigrette was not bad by any means, but neither was it worth the $10 price tag. It's steamed green beans and diced tomatoes, drizzled with dressing. You can do this at home.Since I'm trying to cut down on all the unhealthy food, I ordered fish for my main course. The skate seemed to be a nutritious, low-fat choice. Imagine my surprise when it was served with bacon, shrimp and potatoes. Oh, it's listed on the menu like that? Weird. Either way, it's wonderful, even if the fish's intrinsic flavor is slightly overwhelmed by the accompaniments.I suppose I'll have to return to Blue Ribbon for that healthy meal. I hear good things about the fried chicken.",4.0

Our first time here. This place is so good. Had some oysters followed by the sweet and spicy catfish. By far the best meal we have had in a long time. My girlfriend had the veggie burger and I tasted it and it was so good crispy outside and great flavor inside. The waiter recommended the catfish and it did not disappoint. Everything was excellent. I would definately come here again!!,5.0
Please Read:I love Blue Ribbon! the food is great.However as of last night my favorite Bartender and frankly the reason why most people go on the weekend to Blue Ribbon got let go. Sad to hear because now I have really no reason to sit at the bar  hang out and order tons of drinks and food. I will probably sometimes get take out. But that will be it. Adam will be very missed and frankly this is the worst thing they could have done... Blah....,4.0
Great atmosphere and great food. The raw oysters are amazing. You must try the Duck confit dinner as well as the fried chicken dinner. End of with the chocolate Bruno or the Creme Brûlée and you're in heaven! I also had the Hummingbird cocktail that was amazing.,5.0
"I was more than excited to try Blue Ribbon--specifically the sushi. Didn't make it when the two restaurants were separate, and after last night I wish I had. We were greeted warmly by the hostess and seated in a corner table. The booth was so soft! Service was decent--our waiter was there when we needed him and we didn't have trouble flagging someone down for assistance. We split the Rock Shrimp Tempura (best tasting tempura ever!) and I had the Kaki Fri roll (fried oyster). Our meal was pleasant, but we were expecting a more intimate setting. The restaurant feels as if it caters more towards families, and it was noisy and dark. Perhaps this is because it it a restaurant in Park Slope.

"Server: How would you like that hanger steak cooked?The Girl: Medium, please.Peter D: Are you sure about that?Server: (glances at me) Hanger steak is a lean cut of meat, and if it is cooked anything past medium rare, it has a tendency to dry out.The Girl: OK. Medium rare then.YES. I love you, Blue Ribbon Brasserie Server. And I love your restaurant, too. As it was 7 pm on a Saturday night, we were fully prepared to sit at the bar, or wait up to an hour if necessary. However, the Patron Saint of Open Tables smiled upon us, and we were seated immediately. Drink service was prompt, and I was happy to see that their martini glasses are of the sensible, grounded variety. Prior to the hanger steak, we made a mess of our table as we gorged ourselves on a nice loaf of crusty bread, one order of the Pu Pu Platter and the String Bean Vinaigrette.The Pu Pu happily consisted of a BBQ Rib (juicy and succulent enough that I will most certainly return for a full order), a wing (also tasty, but not a Buffalo wing as the waiter had reported), delicious shrimp, and some unidentified straight meaty things on skewers that she repeatedly insisted were the best things on the platter. I enjoyed the accompanying BBQ sauce immensely, so much that I kept it around for her hanger steak, which was a great decision as it was perfectly executed, but needed a little kick of flavor.Sadly, the Poo Poo (see what I did there?) also included an awful pierogie, and a forgettable spring roll. It was also unclear why there was butter on the platter, and the flaming hibachi wasn't really necessary, and kept threatening to catch us on fire, so we blew it out. The String Bean Vinaigrette was not bad by any means, but neither was it worth the $10 price tag. It's steamed green beans and diced tomatoes, drizzled with dressing. You can do this at home.Since I'm trying to cut down on all the unhealthy food, I ordered fish for my main course. The skate seemed to be a nutritious, low-fat choice. Imagine my surprise when it was served with bacon, shrimp and potatoes. Oh, it's listed on the menu like that? Weird. Either way, it's wonderful, even if the fish's intrinsic flavor is slightly overwhelmed by the accompaniments.I suppose I'll have to return to Blue Ribbon for that healthy meal. I hear good things about the fried chicken.",4.0

"Lesson in overkill:An all-expense paid dinner at Blue Ribbon Brasserie led me to one of the most over indulgent meals I've ever had in my life.  There was a serious food baby rumbling in my belly after my dinner, and it was ready to burst at any moment.Appetizers:  My guest and I ordered both the beef marrow & oxtail marmalade AND the foie gras terrine.  Our waiter even suggested we try one or the other instead of both, since they're incredibly rich dishes, but no, we wanted to go all the way.  This was my first experience with marrow and it was a deliciously, rich and fatty delight.  The foie gras was a little difficult to spread, but I would say it was on par with my other foie gras experiences.  Both appetizers were served with nice crusty bread.Main dishes:  No holds here folks, I ordered the Surf & Turf which comes with a strip steak, whole steamed lobster, and a side of fries for good measure.  The lobster was perfectly steamed and accompanied with the requisite tin of melted butter, but the strip steak was surprisingly the star of the platter.  A nice medium-rare, the meat was flavorful and juicy.  The fries were delish but there was no way I could finish the whole serving without killing myself.  My guest ordered the Land & Sea, which consisted of fried chicken, fried catfish, and mashed potatoes with gravy.  I had a few bites of her food and couldn't find any reason to complain.  Then again, how often do you ever complain about anything fried?Desserts:  After our extremely gluttonous appetizers and meals, our waiter jokingly seemed surprised when we didn't order the most expensive options off the dessert menu.  We instead went with the creme brulee, fresh berries, and profiteroles.  The creme brulee was nice and creamy and paired perfectly with the fresh, tart berries.  The profiteroles, which came with vanilla, chocolate, and strawberry ice cream, were a hit as well.  It's hard to go wrong with scoops of ice cream sandwiched with airy puffs and covered in chocolate sauce.  So good.Our experience at Blue Ribbon was phenomenal-- the service is incredibly helpful and friendly, and I'm sure our waiter had a good time seeing how much food two girls could shove into their faces.  He even let me sample a couple of wines before letting me settle on a glass, how generous!  I had the meal of a lifetime at Blue Ribbon and would highly recommend it to my friends.  It's tucked away on an incredibly cute street in Brooklyn and could envision a wonderful date beginning at the restaurant.  While I'd only recommend my overkill dinner menu to highly seasoned eaters, they have enough options for any food lover.  Go, go to Blue Ribbon Brasserie and eat your hearts out!  You only live once!",5.0

"The woman I'm seeing introduced me to her best friend and her best friend introduced me to her sister and her husband Saturday night for dinner just after 30 minutes her best friend completely devoured the unagi nigiri (eel sushi) I prepared for them.  She's a beast.We sat in the front booth as there weren't any seats in the back since we didn't make reservations or anything.  I think it was a bit of a shock to me that this couple would sort of eat here on a ""regular"" basis as the food isn't cheap and everthing is indeed fancy.  Me and my girl were full so we didn't really want to order anything, but as the husband was gracious as he was generous ordered a few things for everyone to share.Two bottles of Shiraz who's name I can't remember but it was limited edition, 53x2Beef Marrow and Oxtail Marmalade, 16.75Butternut squash ravioli (special?), ?Paella Basquez, 32.5040 oz Rib Eye, 70Banana Split, 12.75Chocolate Bruno, 11.75Banana Walnut Bread Pudding, ?Final bill came out to be a little over $300 for the five of us.Richard, the husband was known to be a foodie and a great cook so I trusted him to do right and indeed everything was.  The wine was awesome and I pretty much knew he wanted to go for steak even before he ordered it.  Red wine + the fact that the wifey doesn't eat red meat.  The beef marrow and oxtail marmalade was out of this world and I'm pretty damn sure it was something I saw on teevee!  We all snicker about the fact that the ""marmalade"" was made of oxtail which was sweetened of course.  Twas very rich but oh so damn good I have to have it again next time I come here.  My girl asked if I was ok and I don't think she understood how excited I really was I got to have this ""tasting menu"".  I then proceeded to ninja the ravioli (really, I'm not hungry!) and split her half.  Wowza this was yummilicious.  Onto the main course.The Paella was passed down to the ladies and although I'm sure it really was appetizing, I was eyeballing the ginormous rib eye.  O_O  Richard opted for the fries while I coulda gone for the sweet potato or yukka alternative.  Still - no regrets.  The steak was perfectly done medium and the fries were salted and crispified to perfection.  The only gripe was the sauteed spinach tasted sort of burnt.  The fig bbq sauce was also very nice.  Although I didn't remember much of the Paella (as I already had rice earlier in the evening), I do remember that the rice was well done (which is the most important thing about paella) and the seafood was also fresh.  However I wasn't a fan of the spicy chicken sausage in it.As we finished up the main courses and Richard was pouring more wine for everyone the beast inside me kept staring at the bone of the rib eye - we all agree that's the very best part!  Of course we talked about dogs (I don't have one) and if they'd want it but they all passed.  So I whispered to the waiter, can I doggie bag that?  He responds, ""oh for your dog?""  ""Yeeeah...  that's it... my dog""  Woot!The desert came and even though everything looked nice, I knew the ice cream was melting already (that's the thing I don't like about restaurant ice cream - melts too fast) I was thinkin about the awesome bone of the rib eye I was gonna have tomorrow while watching some manly show on my couch in my underwear (j/k).  Alas, the waiter told me he accentally threw it away.  Dudes, I was completely bummed.  The girl-beast of course asks if we'd get another steak and I being the guy whom Elaine talks about was new, I didn't make a scene.The banana split was spot on, however it could have been a little bigger and the banana should have been more evident visually instead of having to go through the entire scoop of ice cream to get to it.  They just need a slightly bigger ice cream scooper and a bigger boat.  The Bruno was good - thick brownie like structure is always a good accompaniment to ice cream.  The bread pudding was my least favorite as it reminded me the first time I actually came there (just for dessert).This place would have gotten a full five stars if it weren't for the spinach and throwing out of my awesome rib eye bone.",4.0
"Came here with a friend because he heard great things about this restaurant. It was also during NBA Finals and they had a TV so why not... hah. We ordered the Kaki Fri (Fried Oysters and Lettuce), Karai Kaibashira, and the Ise Ibi Sashimi (Whole Maine Lobster Sashimi) which are all House Specialities. They were all very delicious and fresh - I usually have a very bad allergic reaction to bad seafood, but the lobster was very fresh.

"While I appreciate the fact this restaurant has a vegetarian section on their menu (with only 2 items), I truly regretted ordering from it. You would think with ONLY two vegetarian items they would be good. Not! Okay, now I know this is not a vegetarian place but still. The food is not cheap & one would hope you at least get what you pay for. Not here, this veggie burger was THE worst I EVER had. Ever! It's made with lentil beans, has grain bread & is topped with a generous supply of leafy-sprouts. It sounded okay until I saw it. To begin, the patty looked liked like a deep fried hockey-puck of damp bread crumbs and that's EXACTLY what it tasted like. It had zero consistency & completely fell apart, like sand, when touched. It was the MOST disgusting thing I ever had. I would have sent it back but my boyfriend would not let me. He was embarrassed and tried to eat it himself. However, he could not eat it because (he agreed) it was HORRIBLE. We also ordered the hummus platter, nothing spectacular at all, and my boyfriend had a fish dish (just okay). Definitely not worth the money. Brooklyn has MUCH better spots that both vegetarians & carnivores can enjoy. So, Blue Ribbon Brassierie, if you read this, get it together! Do not put something on your menu just for the sake of having it there if it's disgusting. This is New York City! A better veggie patty could have come from my ars!!",1.0

"The woman I'm seeing introduced me to her best friend and her best friend introduced me to her sister and her husband Saturday night for dinner just after 30 minutes her best friend completely devoured the unagi nigiri (eel sushi) I prepared for them.  She's a beast.We sat in the front booth as there weren't any seats in the back since we didn't make reservations or anything.  I think it was a bit of a shock to me that this couple would sort of eat here on a ""regular"" basis as the food isn't cheap and everthing is indeed fancy.  Me and my girl were full so we didn't really want to order anything, but as the husband was gracious as he was generous ordered a few things for everyone to share.Two bottles of Shiraz who's name I can't remember but it was limited edition, 53x2Beef Marrow and Oxtail Marmalade, 16.75Butternut squash ravioli (special?), ?Paella Basquez, 32.5040 oz Rib Eye, 70Banana Split, 12.75Chocolate Bruno, 11.75Banana Walnut Bread Pudding, ?Final bill came out to be a little over $300 for the five of us.Richard, the husband was known to be a foodie and a great cook so I trusted him to do right and indeed everything was.  The wine was awesome and I pretty much knew he wanted to go for steak even before he ordered it.  Red wine + the fact that the wifey doesn't eat red meat.  The beef marrow and oxtail marmalade was out of this world and I'm pretty damn sure it was something I saw on teevee!  We all snicker about the fact that the ""marmalade"" was made of oxtail which was sweetened of course.  Twas very rich but oh so damn good I have to have it again next time I come here.  My girl asked if I was ok and I don't think she understood how excited I really was I got to have this ""tasting menu"".  I then proceeded to ninja the ravioli (really, I'm not hungry!) and split her half.  Wowza this was yummilicious.  Onto the main course.The Paella was passed down to the ladies and although I'm sure it really was appetizing, I was eyeballing the ginormous rib eye.  O_O  Richard opted for the fries while I coulda gone for the sweet potato or yukka alternative.  Still - no regrets.  The steak was perfectly done medium and the fries were salted and crispified to perfection.  The only gripe was the sauteed spinach tasted sort of burnt.  The fig bbq sauce was also very nice.  Although I didn't remember much of the Paella (as I already had rice earlier in the evening), I do remember that the rice was well done (which is the most important thing about paella) and the seafood was also fresh.  However I wasn't a fan of the spicy chicken sausage in it.As we finished up the main courses and Richard was pouring more wine for everyone the beast inside me kept staring at the bone of the rib eye - we all agree that's the very best part!  Of course we talked about dogs (I don't have one) and if they'd want it but they all passed.  So I whispered to the waiter, can I doggie bag that?  He responds, ""oh for your dog?""  ""Yeeeah...  that's it... my dog""  Woot!The desert came and even though everything looked nice, I knew the ice cream was melting already (that's the thing I don't like about restaurant ice cream - melts too fast) I was thinkin about the awesome bone of the rib eye I was gonna have tomorrow while watching some manly show on my couch in my underwear (j/k).  Alas, the waiter told me he accentally threw it away.  Dudes, I was completely bummed.  The girl-beast of course asks if we'd get another steak and I being the guy whom Elaine talks about was new, I didn't make a scene.The banana split was spot on, however it could have been a little bigger and the banana should have been more evident visually instead of having to go through the entire scoop of ice cream to get to it.  They just need a slightly bigger ice cream scooper and a bigger boat.  The Bruno was good - thick brownie like structure is always a good accompaniment to ice cream.  The bread pudding was my least favorite as it reminded me the first time I actually came there (just for dessert).This place would have gotten a full five stars if it weren't for the spinach and throwing out of my awesome rib eye bone.",4.0
"Came here with a friend because he heard great things about this restaurant. It was also during NBA Finals and they had a TV so why not... hah. We ordered the Kaki Fri (Fried Oysters and Lettuce), Karai Kaibashira, and the Ise Ibi Sashimi (Whole Maine Lobster Sashimi) which are all House Specialities. They were all very delicious and fresh - I usually have a very bad allergic reaction to bad seafood, but the lobster was very fresh. The wait for the food was painfully long though and the portions were very small. Definitely not the place to go if you are starving. I would come again and try the other specialities!",4.0
"While I appreciate the fact this restaurant has a vegetarian section on their menu (with only 2 items), I truly regretted ordering from it. You would think with ONLY two vegetarian items they would be good. Not! Okay, now I know this is not a vegetarian place but still. The food is not cheap & one would hope you at least get what you pay for. Not here, this veggie burger was THE worst I EVER had. Ever! It's made with lentil beans, has grain bread & is topped with a generous supply of leafy-sprouts. It sounded okay until I saw it. To begin, the patty looked liked like a deep fried hockey-puck of damp bread crumbs and that's EXACTLY what it tasted like. It had zero consistency & completely fell apart, like sand, when touched. It was the MOST disgusting thing I ever had. I would have sent it back but my boyfriend would not let me. He was embarrassed and tried to eat it himself. However, he could not eat it because (he agreed) it was HORRIBLE. We also ordered the hummus platter, nothing spectacular at all, and my boyfriend had a fish dish (just okay). Definitely not worth the money. Brooklyn has MUCH better spots that both vegetarians & carnivores can enjoy. So, Blue Ribbon Brassierie, if you read this, get it together! Do not put something on your menu just for the sake of having it there if it's disgusting. This is New York City! A better veggie patty could have come from my ars!!",1.0

Then, the food was SO EXPENSIVE, I ordered a ""ruben"" for 14 bucks with really nothing in it, and even more crusty bread. Then, for some reason we ordered bread pudding that had you guessed it, more bread. Although it wasn't crusty. But I guess at one point it was... Don't waste your time. I saw the ""fried chicken"" and it looked like it was from a box of KFC. And for 29 bucks, I'd expect at least a bucket of it. Horrible. I'll never go back.

They have a very eclectic menu from oysters, sushi, steak, grilled fish and bone marrow to matzo ball soup. We had fresh oysters, steak tartare, sunomono, shrimp in salt, grilled branzini, duck confit and bone marrow. Everything was superb. They have a full bar and a big sake selection. We even got dessert on the house. Overall a great experience. Definitely will be back. I gave it 4 stars cause the bar does not make martinis.",4.0

"At 8:45, we realized we weren't going to make our 8:30 dinner reservation.

Drink orders went in and delicious (and endless) homemade bread came out. Six ladies went for the prix fix special (the lone ranger went for the fried chicken) and the food was received very well across the board. I can personally speak for the sushi/sashimi entrée as being a standout - a nice selection, large and varied, with super fresh and tasty soosh. The service was great (keeping my water filled to the brim, etc.) but the timing of dishes was off. Those who ordered the salmon and sea bass received entrees about 15 minutes before we sushi orderers. Though unfortunate, the staff was apologetic and the meal and experience was overall quite enjoyable. Definitely another great place to dine in Park Slope.",4.0

"My first review of Blue Ribbon was a little over three years ago.  My wife and I are still going to BR and still enjoying it as much as ever.When I wrote my original review our habit was to get there early and go for a good table and then relax and let the stellar service do its magic.  Now we generally sit at the bar (where we've come to know most of the bartenders) instead of at a table.  No particular reason, just a change in routine.  We try to get there early so that (a): there are actually seats at the bar, and (b) we can take advantage of their oyster/clam special, which extends from opening (5:00 PM during the week, 4:00 PM on weekends) to 6:00 PM or 6:30, can't remember which.  Oysters are a buck and half each and clams are a buck each, so a dozen oysters and a half dozen clams, all on the half-shell, come to $24, which is pretty damned good.  The same order at full price would be $51.Other dishes to try include:- the fried chicken (why, O Lord, why did you make me wait so long to try the fried chicken?)- the oxtail fried rice, which includes daikon, shiitake and bone marrow- the hamachi tataki for something really different and really delicious (we tried it on a whim one night and now we have it every time we go)- the sashimi deluxe platter for some of the best sashimi this side of Tokyo- the whole fish prepared as you like (I prefer grilled, but I don't care for the fennel salad which accompanies the fish so I get a different side dish)- the hummus appetizer for some terrific hummus (try it, you'll see)- the sauteed calamari appetizer for perfectly prepared (and unbreaded) calamari -- it's easy to overcook calamari so that it ends up tasting like rubber bands, but that hasn't happened yet to me at BR.  The sauteed calamari has always been perfectly cooked, thus tasty and tender.Many of the waitstaff have been at BR for years, so they know the menu well and they know their customers.  As a result, the service is still top-notch. The managers pay attention and it all makes for a great dining experience. The wine prices are still too high in general but you can keep it under control if you order carefully.  The food prices are also high, but that still doesn't seem to deter anyone, judging by the crowds. BR still packs them in every night. It's a somewhat upscale restaurant (as the prices indicate), but it's also casual and relaxing, at least to us.  It always seems to have a nice vibe.If you have kids you will be impressed by their kids menu, on which every item is ten bucks.  That's a bargain for a lot of the items.My suggestion is to get there early and grab a seat at the bar (if you don't have kids with you) or take a table, whichever you prefer, and try the oyster and clam special with a glass of wine.

"I went here last night with a party of 5 for dinner.  We were seated right away on a Friday night at 7:30 which was great.  There were a lot of children which was fine for us as we have kids at home but if you are looking for a little more sophistication well just note that it is a family friendly restaurant which I liked but could see it being off-putting.  The service was excellent and everyone enjoyed their cocktails (French 75 was really good!) and a really nice bottle of Tempranillo.  The main reason I only gave this place 3 stars is because while everything we had was solid, I don't think anything really stood out for me and the meal was quite expensive.  My raw oysters were very good and the sauces provided with them were nice but one would hope that would be the case since it was $18 for 1/2 dozen and the sweet and spicy catfish was kind of meh.  I would probably go back especially if I was with my kids and would definitely try the sushi and some of the other items that have gotten rave reviews like the chorizo and shrimp or escargot.",3.0
"My brother, sister-in-law, friend, and I went to Blue Ribbon last Friday for my SIL's and my joint birthday dinner (we always go somewhere fancy). The service was completely disorganized and horrendous from the jump: our waiter introduced himself, then disappeared for 20 minutes (well, not really; he was 2 tables over, ignoring us); we ordered drinks from a maitre d', simple ones, and they took 20 minutes to arrive; ditto the second round. The busboys were totally on top of it with the bread and water, but...bread and water. This restaurant is not cheap.When the food it took forever to order finally arrived, it was effing amazing, as always. Everything kicked palate ass (...ew, sorry; just go with it), from bread to oyster plate to dessert. It just took forever and was super-irritating, so I approached a manager and asked if we could get some free-dessert consideration for the fact that the server team seemed to be stoned at best. Not only did he agree, but he apologized profusely; explained that the transition into one single restaurant is causing some growing pains; AND threw in the oysters for free. So, for the time being I would have to tell you to steer clear of the place, at least on weekend nights, while they get their acts together and nail down their process -- but the food is still fantastic and totally worth the price, and we all really appreciated that the management admitted to the problem and made it right pronto.

It made it difficult to justify spending that much money for sushi. Although the quality was amazing, I'd rather go to a smaller and less crazy sushi place.",3.0

"I went here last night with a party of 5 for dinner.  We were seated right away on a Friday night at 7:30 which was great.  There were a lot of children which was fine for us as we have kids at home but if you are looking for a little more sophistication well just note that it is a family friendly restaurant which I liked but could see it being off-putting.  The service was excellent and everyone enjoyed their cocktails (French 75 was really good!) and a really nice bottle of Tempranillo.  The main reason I only gave this place 3 stars is because while everything we had was solid, I don't think anything really stood out for me and the meal was quite expensive.  My raw oysters were very good and the sauces provided with them were nice but one would hope that would be the case since it was $18 for 1/2 dozen and the sweet and spicy catfish was kind of meh.  I would probably go back especially if I was with my kids and would definitely try the sushi and some of the other items that have gotten rave reviews like the chorizo and shrimp or escargot.",3.0
"My brother, sister-in-law, friend, and I went to Blue Ribbon last Friday for my SIL's and my joint birthday dinner (we always go somewhere fancy). The service was completely disorganized and horrendous from the jump: our waiter introduced himself, then disappeared for 20 minutes (well, not really; he was 2 tables over, ignoring us); we ordered drinks from a maitre d', simple ones, and they took 20 minutes to arrive; ditto the second round. The busboys were totally on top of it with the bread and water, but...bread and water. This restaurant is not cheap.When the food it took forever to order finally arrived, it was effing amazing, as always. Everything kicked palate ass (...ew, sorry; just go with it), from bread to oyster plate to dessert. It just took forever and was super-irritating, so I approached a manager and asked if we could get some free-dessert consideration for the fact that the server team seemed to be stoned at best. Not only did he agree, but he apologized profusely; explained that the transition into one single restaurant is causing some growing pains; AND threw in the oysters for free. So, for the time being I would have to tell you to steer clear of the place, at least on weekend nights, while they get their acts together and nail down their process -- but the food is still fantastic and totally worth the price, and we all really appreciated that the management admitted to the problem and made it right pronto. Goes a long way. Good luck with the refit, BRBB. We'll totally be back.",4.0
"I'd been wanting to eat here for the longest time, finally went when my mom came to town.- super nice waiter, very attentive (almost, overly so). - fantastic raw oysters- sauteed calamari was delicious and peppery, albeit a bit rubbery- tomato soup very yummy, although certainly not work $8- grilled whole fish of the day, Branzino- tasteless, bland, dry...reminded me of something a cardiac patient would eat in the hospital. Did i mention it was flavourless?- nice atmosphere to take a date, saw loads of couples getting (too) cozy in the tiny corner booths. Decent appetizers, way over priced- and skip the grilled fish (unless your doctor has you on an ADA or AHA diet). I'll be back, but only if my date is paying.",3.0
"We came here for a birthday dinner. It was very casual - about 9pm on a Tuesday, just 2 of us. Aside from our waiter acting awkwardly and an interesting vibe in the restaurant. We were treated very nicely as a couple and seated quietly in a back booth, despite the rest of the room being fairly empty.The food was awesome - we split beets, I had the market salad & he had brisket. A beer or two and the sweetest Hummingbird cocktail. For dessert, the crazy fudge sundae. There was a table of rowdier men near us who weren't too bothersome, but complained loudly about the price of drinks. One thing that bugged me a lot was the TV screen over the bar - it was so distracting throughout dinner and made the restaurant's atmosphere more confusing.I was excited to come here having heard great things. Our server was very attentive and helpful, if a bit creepy, and the food was great. I left a little disappointed with our overall experience.",3.0
"Had a close to perfect experience here. Very sweet staff, terrific company and yummy food. Yes, try the bone marrow everyone talks about. I had a small sliver, it was tasty.

"Our experience here was pretty uneven. We started off strong: I had the bone marrow & oxtail marmalade, and my boyfriend got a half dozen oysters. The oysters were perfect. They had a wonderful mouthfeel and tasted like the sea. The bone marrow was deliciously fatty and well-seasoned. The serving was a bit large, but that's not really a problem. Unfortunately, it was downhill from there. I had ordered the shrimp provencal, which is served with cheese ravioli and spinach. The cheese ravioli was pretty straightforward, and I don't mean that as a compliment: it was just a handful of floppy ravioli filled with ricotta. There were also a few small shrimp, one of which still had a bit of its shell. The dish came coated in a sauce that I would describe as thick and brown. It tasted strongly of butter and flour, which are good things, but shouldn't be standout flavors in a sauce. Sauce is supposed to be subtle but beautiful, to improve everything it touches, to ensnare the mind and bewitch the senses. This was not that. My boyfriend had the duck confit, which he liked despite the fact that the skin wasn't very crisp. His potatoes were nice, toothsome and tasting brightly of lemon. But the salad that accompanied the dish was bizarre: large pieces of lettuce with thin strips of tomato rind, completely undressed. For dessert, we decided to share the ""Chocolate Bruno,"" which the waiter described as a cross between chocolate mousse and flourless chocolate cake. It tasted awful, and the texture was worse, like taffy or stale jello or old gum, clinging to the back of my teeth and the roof of my mouth. It came on a very hard white chocolate base, which was reminiscent of plastic. The scoops of vanilla ice cream on the side tasted like off-brand low-fat grocery store garbage. It was not just underwhelming but actively bad. The service also left something to be desired, on a number of a levels: - As we entered the restaurant, a guy in cargo pants and a checkered shirt leapt from his bar stool and asked, ""How many?"" I know it's not a fine dining establishment, but I was still kind of thrown by how underdressed the host was. - At the beginning of the meal, they brought out a crusty loaf of bread on a undersized wooden board with a dull small knife. We hacked at the bread for a while and got crumbs all over the table. The crumb situation was not rectified until after we had ordered dessert. - When we ordered, our waiter praised the choices we made a little too enthusiastically (""Wonderful!"" ""Magnificent!""), as if we were slow children who had made him a finger painting. - Several of the waiters had made rather unorthodox decisions about their grooming. A number of them looked unwashed. One looked like he had gotten tired of introducing himself to his neighbors as a registered sex offender, so he chose a mustache that could say it for him. - The check was accompanied by a solicitation spiel, something about a bike ride for multiple sclerosis. Charity is good and MS is bad, but I found it hugely inappropriate and kind of unpleasant. I'm tempted to demote them to one star on the basis of that, but the oysters were really very good.",2.0

"I have been to Blue Ribbon a few times before  years ago (good experiences) and knowing that both of our moms like seafood, my husband and I decided to take them there, albeit with some delay, in celebration of International Women's Day. In the past, I ordered from both meat and fish sides of the entree section, but this time around we all went for fish dishes, and also had oysters (special deal for $1.50 apiece) and two salads to start. Moms were not the fans of oysters, but then it's an acquired taste. I did not think they were bad, I just thought that two out of the three sauces that came with them were completely useless. They did not, in any way, add to the flavor. The only sauce that gave a little kick to the oysters was the cocktail sauce. Perhaps coming up with some interesting condiment for the oysters would be a good idea? [wink] Caesar and Greek salads were standard salads. We got Chardonnay and Riesling (local)  to drink, and the latter went much better with the fish offerings on the menu. Chardonnay was not memorable, sadly. Now onto the entrees - moms each had the red trout with mushrooms and greens, hubby had the sweet and spicy cat fish and I got the skate. All fish was absolutely wonderfully cooked, although moms had to peel the skins off their trouts. I tried mushrooms that came with the fish and they were really good, although I would have paired that  particular fish with something more grainy, like rice or buckwheat (may be mushroom fried rice? [wink]). Husband was also happy with his entree and mashed potatoes. Now as for my skate, I appreciated the opportunity to try this creature (it was cooked in some kind of batter, so it was crunchy on the outside, but soft on the inside :)), but the side it came with - vaguely described on the menu as ""potatoes, bacon and shrimp"" - could simply be called ""lots of bacon"". ""Potatoes"" were miniscule hash browns, and there were few of them. ""Shrimp"" were tiny mini shrimps you see in Ramen noodle soups. The side was overwhelmed by bacon fat, while, I thought I'd have more potatoes and shrimps, sprinkled with a few pieces of bacon. That would have been a logical combination for me, and probably for most people [wink]. Profiteroles we got for dessert were really good and we also liked how our tea was served in individual pots. We had to dip tea bags into the pots ourselves though. :) Also, pots had openings for the bags and no lids, so the water got cold pretty quickly. Service was, overall, fast and more or less attentive, though our particular server was sort of ""in the clouds"", and had to be called to the table twice. For a dinner worth close to $300 for the party of four, I would have really appreciated more creativity in side dishes and a more attentive staff.",3.0

Prices are ok considering the quality.Good selection of raw oysters - 4 kinds ranging from 1.50-3.50 in price, fresh and tasty.

Try the smoked scallops, i did today and was blown away, sooo tender and good, comes with a dip to die for ;) all of their smoked fish is actually made in house . Salad - warm goat chees. Very fresh and tender warm goat cheese spread on buttered up toast under fresh salad - yam ;).Cat fish iz also very good.

"Tough to pinpoint what stands out most about Blue Ribbon: the warmth of the staff, the delicious food, or the intense richness of every dish. Truly, all three are superlatives, but unfortunately, it's the the butter assault that is always most memorable, it really needs to be turned down a notch. It's borderline oppressive.You can't go wrong with most items on the menu: the paellas are generous and unique, the short ribs wonderfully tender, and lamb shank is jaw-dropping. My favorite item is the sauteed calamari appetizer. Save some of your free bread to sop up the buttery salty herby juice.Once in a while, Blue Ribbon is an absolute must-go.",4.0

"I have been to Blue Ribbon a few times before  years ago (good experiences) and knowing that both of our moms like seafood, my husband and I decided to take them there, albeit with some delay, in celebration of International Women's Day. In the past, I ordered from both meat and fish sides of the entree section, but this time around we all went for fish dishes, and also had oysters (special deal for $1.50 apiece) and two salads to start. Moms were not the fans of oysters, but then it's an acquired taste. I did not think they were bad, I just thought that two out of the three sauces that came with them were completely useless. They did not, in any way, add to the flavor. The only sauce that gave a little kick to the oysters was the cocktail sauce. Perhaps coming up with some interesting condiment for the oysters would be a good idea? [wink] Caesar and Greek salads were standard salads. We got Chardonnay and Riesling (local)  to drink, and the latter went much better with the fish offerings on the menu. Chardonnay was not memorable, sadly. Now onto the entrees - moms each had the red trout with mushrooms and greens, hubby had the sweet and spicy cat fish and I got the skate. All fish was absolutely wonderfully cooked, although moms had to peel the skins off their trouts. I tried mushrooms that came with the fish and they were really good, although I would have paired that  particular fish with something more grainy, like rice or buckwheat (may be mushroom fried rice? [wink]). Husband was also happy with his entree and mashed potatoes. Now as for my skate, I appreciated the opportunity to try this creature (it was cooked in some kind of batter, so it was crunchy on the outside, but soft on the inside :)), but the side it came with - vaguely described on the menu as ""potatoes, bacon and shrimp"" - could simply be called ""lots of bacon"". ""Potatoes"" were miniscule hash browns, and there were few of them. ""Shrimp"" were tiny mini shrimps you see in Ramen noodle soups. The side was overwhelmed by bacon fat, while, I thought I'd have more potatoes and shrimps, sprinkled with a few pieces of bacon. That would have been a logical combination for me, and probably for most people [wink]. Profiteroles we got for dessert were really good and we also liked how our tea was served in individual pots. We had to dip tea bags into the pots ourselves though. :) Also, pots had openings for the bags and no lids, so the water got cold pretty quickly. Service was, overall, fast and more or less attentive, though our particular server was sort of ""in the clouds"", and had to be called to the table twice. For a dinner worth close to $300 for the party of four, I would have really appreciated more creativity in side dishes and a more attentive staff.",3.0

"I love this place! This has become our special occasion go-to. The food is excellent, which is rare for a place with such  an expansive menu. However, the thing that impresses me the most is the service. Every time we have ever dined here, our waiter has been amazing and the  management has come by our table to ensure that we are pleased. I once dined there and didn't eat the potatoes that came with my dish. The manager came to my table to make sure that everything on the plate was satisfactory and inquired about the sides. I explained that it was just a large portion and as a side it was a little basic. He thanked me profusely for my input and sent out free dessert. Every time we go there we are made to feel like VIPs and that will keep us coming back!",5.0
"What a place!!! Not only is it right next door to blue ribbon sushi which is the best in town, but the food and service are amaizing here also!!Quick staff,very freindly. The decor is nice for both family , a romantic evening or a quck eat at lunch by the bar. Prices are ok considering the quality.Good selection of raw oysters - 4 kinds ranging from 1.50-3.50 in price, fresh and tasty. Stake tartar is Very gooood but different, has a lot of flavor and mixed in stuff,but still very delicious. Def. Try the smoked scallops, i did today and was blown away, sooo tender and good, comes with a dip to die for ;) all of their smoked fish is actually made in house . Salad - warm goat chees. Very fresh and tender warm goat cheese spread on buttered up toast under fresh salad - yam ;).Cat fish iz also very good. Sweet and spicy comes with mashed pitatos, delicious filet caramelized in spicy sauce.Over all very good eating experience a must try!!!!!",5.0

"Tough to pinpoint what stands out most about Blue Ribbon: the warmth of the staff, the delicious food, or the intense richness of every dish. Truly, all three are superlatives, but unfortunately, it's the the butter assault that is always most memorable, it really needs to be turned down a notch. It's borderline oppressive.You can't go wrong with most items on the menu: the paellas are generous and unique, the short ribs wonderfully tender, and lamb shank is jaw-dropping. My favorite item is the sauteed calamari appetizer. Save some of your free bread to sop up the buttery salty herby juice.Once in a while, Blue Ribbon is an absolute must-go.",4.0

"Dine-in Brooklyn: $25 for 3 course meal at Blue Ribbon? I AM DOWN.After sending a mass text to like nine people (funny story #1: I didn't realize everybody could see that I sent the exact same message to like 8 other people, awkward) I finally managed to end up here with ONE person (funny story #2: another friend who wanted to come ended up at 280 5th Ave in Manhattan instead of Brooklyn; poor guy). Anyway, yes, that is how lame and unresponsive my friends are. HOW DOES A SANE PERSON TURN DOWN A CHANCE TO EAT A THREE COURSE MEAL AT BLUE RIBBON FOR A MEASLY $25?!??! Okay, moving on (friggin their loss).SERVICEI came at 6:15 because I called a day ahead and was told before 6:30 is a good time to come and avoid the wait. Whoever told me that was not lying; we were seated straight away. Our busser was a rather lanky, tall lad with a boyish charm and a mass of dark curls...stfu Lena, I say these things to be awkward, he was cute though. ANYWHO. Wonderful service, our glasses were NEVER empty, and these were not very large glasses (by American standards, anyway). And he came in between courses with a little crumber to ""you know, scrape crumbs and stuff."" I consider myself a very nice patron, and I really like nice, friendly, humorous, (cute) servers because when everybody is nice IT JUST MAKES THE WORLD A BETTER PLACE. I would have left a 25% tip if he was our waiter; unfortunately he was not (he deserves a promotion though, seriously--I know you managers read this stuff, do it). Our waiter on the other hand, was this short middle aged man with glasses and kind of a Brooklyn-hipster-y too-good-for-you attitude. It wasn't like an obnoxious in your face kind of attitude, but it was reminiscent of the 'tude I get from middle-aged homosexual men with thick plastic framed glasses at the magazine I intern at, except he was, you know, a waiter, not someone who gets to mingle with celebrities at the Oscars and then write about it. And I was his customer, not his intern. So he deserved the standard 15% but we evened it out with the busser's percentage so it was all okay in the end.FOODBread:This round loaf...soft, warm, rather chewy white bread inside, with a lightly crunchy crust. Pretty good, but I would have preferred colder butter--theirs is just over room temperature so it's easy to spread, but I like slightly chunky, super silky butter. Nougatine has it.Appetizers:I ordered these croquettes (forget what exactly they were; I'll upload pics later). They were recommended by our server, and they were pretty decent but nothing mind-blowing, and they came with this weird watery-ish creamy dip that didn't have much flavor. I don't think they are on the usual menu. My friend got the shrimp cocktail; very fresh, firm shrimp--solid.Entrees:I got the duck confit with orange sauce, potatoes, arugula salad, which was pretty delicious--the meat was saturated with flavor--if not a little salty, and the skin had some crisp to it. The orange sauce was really sweet though--but overall it was a pretty decent dish. My friend got the Sweet And Spicy Catfish with mashed potatoes, collard greens and tartar sauce, which I tried a little bit of. It was a good texture but a little lacking in flavor, and I thought it was kind of unimpressive, but she seemed to like it so I didn't say anything. Dessert:We both got the chocolate chip bread pudding, duh, and obviously it was the best thing of our lives. Well okay, that's an overstatement, but after my first bite I was having a foodgasm. It's so rich though, so after a third of it I had to stop (it's a pretty big portion too though). My theory is you have to eat it with the vanilla ice cream to balance out the richness, or it'll just make you sick. But it was really delicious.So this would technically be a 3 star experience, but it gets a 3.5 (rounded up to 4) because of the amazeballz deal we got. I'm looking forward to going to Blue Ribbon again sometime though, to try the marrow, oysters, chocolate bruno, and if I come to Brooklyn again, the ice cream profiteroles.",4.0

"3.5 stars... This was my third and last restaurant I tried for Brooklyn's restaurant week this year (3 courses for $25). I'm actually probably not going to do the Brooklyn restaurant week again though. The places on the list usually charge $22-25 for their entrees normally and when I go out I usually just get an entree and a drink or two so I don't need the the little appetizer and dessert they give me in exchange for an extremely limited selection of their entrees. When we first got there we had to wait at the bar until a table opened up (because they only take reservations for 5 or more) so we ordered a beer ($7) and a bloody mary ($9.50). Blue Ribbon's appetizers were limited to tomato soup, salad, green beans, or asparagus. Given the bleak options I opted for the soup. The entree I wanted (which was the only thing on the restaurant week menu I was interested in) were the short ribs but they were out of them. Fortunately they opted to offer 3 other entrees from their menu as a replacement so I went for the Lamb shank with white beans. The lamb didn't come with a sauce and didn't really seamed seasoned but was cooked to perfection and was incredibly tender. My date got the salmon burger which she claimed was just ok but a tad small and she found a tiny fish bone in it. I doubt this is like Charlie finding that golden ticket because we didn't end up getting any prizes, except for the bone that is. The dessert selection was weak. She got the ice cream which was a tiny scoop of vanilla in a dish. I went for their well known chocolate chip bread pudding which everyone seems to love. The portion was pretty small and I found it to be spongy and fairly dry like a cake and not at all like a bread pudding. So I found the prices here to be a little too high, the portions to be a smidge too small and that's mostly why I wrote 3.5 stars. On the other hand though everything was cooked to perfection, the flavors were great, the space was beautiful, and the service was impeccable.",4.0

"If you want a classically enjoyable dining experience while in Park Slope, come eat here.  Upon entering and being seated, I noticed the atmosphere was elegant and the serving staff was courteous, attentive and well spoken.My first cocktail, an old fashioned, wasn't too impressive in taste for the high price of over $12.  I can't really blame them since their specialty is in the foods they make.I was very pleased with the two different oysters that we sampled.  The mixed green salad was fresh and well dressed, but I don't usually feel pressed to spend over $10 on a small dinner salad.  The main course of duck confit was cooked perfectly for me since I enjoy the fat as a nice gooey glaze- perfect for eating with their oven-fresh bread.  The duck skin was perfectly crispy for me- you can trust my word on that since I'm a typical Filipino when it comes to loving crispy pig skin.The wine selection seemed pretty standard, with a small selection that served its purpose but didn't catch my eye. Their banana bread pudding was exactly how I wanted to end my meal.  The creme brule is so rich that you definitely need a coffee to balance it out.",4.0
"None of the Blue Ribbons take reservations for parties with fewer than five diners, but it was late on a Wednesday night with rain in the forecast. Surely we wouldn't wait long, right? Well, the wait was about a half hour for our party of three. There's not much waiting room besides a small bench but luckily we are small people. The Knicks game was on at the bar so our male diner was occupied while the ladies had lady talk.Once we were seated we were given truly great service. Inobtrusive but helpful, our waiter was humorous when the occasion called for it but never hokey. Both the BK Blue Ribbons were participating in Dine In Brooklyn, which is a fair deal there. Our waiter assured us the portions were the same as the regular menu and they included special options nightly. He barely flinched when I asked if the salmon burger was grilled alongside the meats (I know I'm a jerk, but keep in mind the other special was ribs and I really don't like meat or meaty sauce) and he suggested that he ask the cook if they could prepare it separately. I assured him it was not a big deal, but I could tell the neighborhood had conditioned him for these kinds of assanine concerns. They are willing to accommodate.We started with one each of the three oysters available, $3-3.50 each, one from New Brunswick and two from Washington. Delicious hama hamas and a textbook mignonette. Two of us got salads for our first course: one the mixed greens and another the Ceasar. They are large but mostly unadorned, though well-executed. I had the shrimp cocktail: a good portion and exceptionally fresh. The pacing was perhaps a tad slow so that by the time I received my salmon burger I was not particularly hungry. Two of us had the salmon and agreed that while it wasn't mind-alteringly good, it was comforting just as a burger of any kind should be. Dessert options were chocolate bread pudding, ice cream, or sorbet. Again, unadorned but tasty.We were never rushed through our meal. In fact, dinner lasted close to 2 hours nearing the midnight mark. I believe we were the last table standing. The manager stopped by mid-meal to make sure everything was ""enjoyable."" And our waiter was incredibly apologetic when we pointed out we'd been charged for filtered water we had not ordered (NB: $8 bottle of water alert, y'all). I left very satisfied witt the hope of returning some time in the future.With all that in mind, my friend put it succinctly when we first opened the menus and he remarked, ""This place is effing expensive."" The service is what sets them apart. And though there is a kids' menu on offer, I didn't see a single stroller or wee person the entire time we were there. And in Park Slope, that just may be priceless.",4.0

My friend got the shrimp cocktail; very fresh, firm shrimp--solid.Entrees:I got the duck confit with orange sauce, potatoes, arugula salad, which was pretty delicious--the meat was saturated with flavor--if not a little salty, and the skin had some crisp to it. The orange sauce was really sweet though--but overall it was a pretty decent dish. My friend got the Sweet And Spicy Catfish with mashed potatoes, collard greens and tartar sauce, which I tried a little bit of. It was a good texture but a little lacking in flavor, and I thought it was kind of unimpressive, but she seemed to like it so I didn't say anything. Dessert:We both got the chocolate chip bread pudding, duh, and obviously it was the best thing of our lives. Well okay, that's an overstatement, but after my first bite I was having a foodgasm. It's so rich though, so after a third of it I had to stop (it's a pretty big portion too though). My theory is you have to eat it with the vanilla ice cream to balance out the richness, or it'll just make you sick. But it was really delicious.So this would technically be a 3 star experience, but it gets a 3.5 (rounded up to 4) because of the amazeballz deal we got. I'm looking forward to going to Blue Ribbon again sometime though, to try the marrow, oysters, chocolate bruno, and if I come to Brooklyn again, the ice cream profiteroles.",4.0
"This place is as consistent as restaurants get.  The service is always excellent, and while the food isn't extraordinary, there is always something for everyone and once you learn what your preferences are, they execute everything well.  There is something comforting about knowing what you are going to get time and time again.",4.0
"We stumbled in by default, as it was the only place with an open kitchen (it was post 11pm).  We were greeted by a friendly bartender who advised the kitchen's open till midnight. The friendliness of the place didn't end there - as our waiter (whose name I forget, dang) couldn't have been friendlier.  Even the bus boys were upbeat and attentive!You would've thought it was 6pm, not 11:30pm, as we never felt rushed and the food was certainly made with love (except for the asparagus dish, which was a bit bland), especially the ribs and mashed potatoes. It should be mentioned that it's ""Dine In Brooklyn"" week, so we got a great $25 deal, but still, the food, service and cleanliness of the place was certainly 5-star worthy. We'll certainly be back!",5.0
"Plain & Simple:  It's a Blue Ribbon restaurant.  It's delicious.  Everything I have ever eaten here has been fantastic.  Good lighting, warm decor, great service and staff.  Calamari is fresh and flavorful.  Skate is great and the fried chicken is awesome.  All the sides were good too.  Even the bread is great.  The chocolate chip bread pudding is the way to go for dessert.  It's not cheap, but it is well worth it.  Honestly, you cannot go wrong coming here.  Highly recommended.",4.0
"3.5 stars... This was my third and last restaurant I tried for Brooklyn's restaurant week this year (3 courses for $25). I'm actually probably not going to do the Brooklyn restaurant week again though. The places on the list usually charge $22-25 for their entrees normally and when I go out I usually just get an entree and a drink or two so I don't need the the little appetizer and dessert they give me in exchange for an extremely limited selection of their entrees. When we first got there we had to wait at the bar until a table opened up (because they only take reservations for 5 or more) so we ordered a beer ($7) and a bloody mary ($9.50). Blue Ribbon's appetizers were limited to tomato soup, salad, green beans, or asparagus. Given the bleak options I opted for the soup. The entree I wanted (which was the only thing on the restaurant week menu I was interested in) were the short ribs but they were out of them. Fortunately they opted to offer 3 other entrees from their menu as a replacement so I went for the Lamb shank with white beans. The lamb didn't come with a sauce and didn't really seamed seasoned but was cooked to perfection and was incredibly tender. My date got the salmon burger which she claimed was just ok but a tad small and she found a tiny fish bone in it. I doubt this is like Charlie finding that golden ticket because we didn't end up getting any prizes, except for the bone that is. The dessert selection was weak. She got the ice cream which was a tiny scoop of vanilla in a dish. I went for their well known chocolate chip bread pudding which everyone seems to love. The portion was pretty small and I found it to be spongy and fairly dry like a cake and not at all like a bread pudding. So I found the prices here to be a little too high, the portions to be a smidge too small and that's mostly why I wrote 3.5 stars. On the other hand though everything was cooked to perfection, the flavors were great, the space was beautiful, and the service was impeccable.",4.0

"If you want a classically enjoyable dining experience while in Park Slope, come eat here.  Upon entering and being seated, I noticed the atmosphere was elegant and the serving staff was courteous, attentive and well spoken.My first cocktail, an old fashioned, wasn't too impressive in taste for the high price of over $12.  I can't really blame them since their specialty is in the foods they make.I was very pleased with the two different oysters that we sampled.  The mixed green salad was fresh and well dressed, but I don't usually feel pressed to spend over $10 on a small dinner salad.  The main course of duck confit was cooked perfectly for me since I enjoy the fat as a nice gooey glaze- perfect for eating with their oven-fresh bread.  The duck skin was perfectly crispy for me- you can trust my word on that since I'm a typical Filipino when it comes to loving crispy pig skin.The wine selection seemed pretty standard, with a small selection that served its purpose but didn't catch my eye. Their banana bread pudding was exactly how I wanted to end my meal.  The creme brule is so rich that you definitely need a coffee to balance it out.",4.0
"None of the Blue Ribbons take reservations for parties with fewer than five diners, but it was late on a Wednesday night with rain in the forecast. Surely we wouldn't wait long, right? Well, the wait was about a half hour for our party of three. There's not much waiting room besides a small bench but luckily we are small people. The Knicks game was on at the bar so our male diner was occupied while the ladies had lady talk.Once we were seated we were given truly great service. Inobtrusive but helpful, our waiter was humorous when the occasion called for it but never hokey. Both the BK Blue Ribbons were participating in Dine In Brooklyn, which is a fair deal there. Our waiter assured us the portions were the same as the regular menu and they included special options nightly. He barely flinched when I asked if the salmon burger was grilled alongside the meats (I know I'm a jerk, but keep in mind the other special was ribs and I really don't like meat or meaty sauce) and he suggested that he ask the cook if they could prepare it separately. I assured him it was not a big deal, but I could tell the neighborhood had conditioned him for these kinds of assanine concerns. They are willing to accommodate.We started with one each of the three oysters available, $3-3.50 each, one from New Brunswick and two from Washington. Delicious hama hamas and a textbook mignonette. Two of us got salads for our first course: one the mixed greens and another the Ceasar. They are large but mostly unadorned, though well-executed. I had the shrimp cocktail: a good portion and exceptionally fresh. The pacing was perhaps a tad slow so that by the time I received my salmon burger I was not particularly hungry. Two of us had the salmon and agreed that while it wasn't mind-alteringly good, it was comforting just as a burger of any kind should be. Dessert options were chocolate bread pudding, ice cream, or sorbet. Again, unadorned but tasty.We were never rushed through our meal. In fact, dinner lasted close to 2 hours nearing the midnight mark. I believe we were the last table standing. The manager stopped by mid-meal to make sure everything was ""enjoyable."" And our waiter was incredibly apologetic when we pointed out we'd been charged for filtered water we had not ordered (NB: $8 bottle of water alert, y'all). I left very satisfied witt the hope of returning some time in the future.With all that in mind, my friend put it succinctly when we first opened the menus and he remarked, ""This place is effing expensive."" The service is what sets them apart. And though there is a kids' menu on offer, I didn't see a single stroller or wee person the entire time we were there. And in Park Slope, that just may be priceless.",4.0

"My husband and I have lived in Park Slope for about two years now but have been leery of eating at Blue Ribbon. We've heard rave reviews and total pans. We've heard it's expensive but worth every penny and so outrageously overpriced and overrated as to be utterly avoided.

Apparently, they trained at Le Cordon Blue and decided to open their own spot that brought excellence to all their favorite comfort foods. Hence the very eclectic menu...and the excellence that comes close to justifying the high prices.One thing we noticed about the menu at Blue Ribbon is that *everything* is expensive. From the fried chicken all the way up to the lobster, you can plan on paying in the ballpark of $30 bucks for an entree. So, why not get the most luxurious foods? I mean, even if the fried chicken totally rocks the house (which I hear it does), you might feel cheated paying $26 bucks for it. But an awesome steamed lobster seems like a fairly good deal at $30 bucks.

Now that i live in the area i had to try it.As always for the BL franchise the decor is beautiful, simple and clean. The menu at this location (i guess owing to the modern american offerings) is over twice as extensive with must more modest offerings (like fried chicken and a KIDS Menu!!) but they have all of the BL favorites (amazing oysters/the best steak tartar, marrow/grilled sardines etc.)  Anyway i tried to stop my heart with the Beef Marrow and Oxtail Marmalade. Of course it was amazing - tasty, rich and almost disgustingly rich. I loved it. the toasted bread and flavorful/crunchy sea salt were great and the marmalade is enough to make your cardiologist scream ""whhhhhyyyyyy?"" but it's oh so good. My only gripe is that they changed the prep and instead of the three (2"") sections of bone cut into sections there were three (4"") sections of bone cut laterally...which amounted to DOUBLE the amount of marrow - i was Stuffed after the ap!For the main i had the Skate (""potatoes, bacon, shrimp"" what are you fn kidding me?"") which was amazing even if i had to take it home and sadly found that outside of the spell of the wonderful atmosphere (read: wine) it was a little salty....but seriously ""potatoes, bacon, shrimp"" (!!)",5.0

Now that i live in the area i had to try it.As always for the BL franchise the decor is beautiful, simple and clean. The menu at this location (i guess owing to the modern american offerings) is over twice as extensive with must more modest offerings (like fried chicken and a KIDS Menu!!) but they have all of the BL favorites (amazing oysters/the best steak tartar, marrow/grilled sardines etc.)  Anyway i tried to stop my heart with the Beef Marrow and Oxtail Marmalade. Of course it was amazing - tasty, rich and almost disgustingly rich. I loved it. the toasted bread and flavorful/crunchy sea salt were great and the marmalade is enough to make your cardiologist scream ""whhhhhyyyyyy?"" but it's oh so good. My only gripe is that they changed the prep and instead of the three (2"") sections of bone cut into sections there were three (4"") sections of bone cut laterally...which amounted to DOUBLE the amount of marrow - i was Stuffed after the ap!For the main i had the Skate (""potatoes, bacon, shrimp"" what are you fn kidding me?"") which was amazing even if i had to take it home and sadly found that outside of the spell of the wonderful atmosphere (read: wine) it was a little salty....but seriously ""potatoes, bacon, shrimp"" (!!)",5.0
Came here for my friends bday and for Brooklyn Dine Out week. I was so happy she chose this place.  We waited a while to be seated and to be served but the waiter knew he was wrong and hooked us up with fress drinks.Not only was my croquettes perfectly crispy and soft in the inside. My salmon was succulent and juicy. The mash potatoes that it sat on was divine. To make things even better we had dessert that was bread pudding from heaven ...........try it out and if you have a chance go during dine out week. I'm hoping to come back again,4.0

"Some of my friends love this place, and after having visited a few times, I have to say that it does not live up to all the hype.  I think that my friends love Blue Ribbon, more for its' ambience, the friendly staff with whom they are on a first-name basis, and the ""idea"" of the place.  Overall , the food is just okay and yes, some dishes are quite flavorful, but definitely overpriced.  I had one of the worst appetizers there, that literally consisted of 3 teeny-tiny little bites with a roasted, stringy green onion.  You could barely fill a thimble with what was on this plate.   I'm all for artistry in food, but at $12, it was truly an insult to serve me this appetizer (it sounded so good, and was the special of the day).  I should have said something about this, but didn't.  I have enjoyed the salmon, though again, the portion could have been slightly better.  The side dishes of veggies and potatoes were flavorful.If you go, you may want to skip some of the overpriced appetizers and instead order an extra entree to split.  The wine selection is fair but also somewhat overpriced.",3.0
"We had dinner here earlier in the summer. We took advantage of the ""Yelp Eats! Restaurant Week in Brooklyn"" promotion. 3 courses for $30 bucks. I ordered the smoked trout, the salmon, and finished with the bread pudding. The salmon was delicious and the bread pudding was on point!",4.0
"I can't say enough good things about Blue Ribbon.  If I go a week without eating here, I feel like something is missing form my life.  Everything on the menu is good.  Their sushi is very fresh and the staff is absolutely great.  If you come here as often as we do, sooner or later the dessert will be on the house :)",5.0

good stuff. no more sushi on the menu. but the fried chicken is very good,4.0
"Best service EVER! While waiting for our table we got drink at the bar and the bartenders were so friendly and attentive. He made us a specialty drink and really took his time mixing it right. It was an awesome drink.If there was an academy awards for waiters, our server would get best picture. :) So nice, attentive and even gave a free appetizer. He also recommended a great wine and refilled our glass for free too. He was attentive without being annoying or fake. I loved him to pieces. So polite!I had the skate fish that was butterflied beautifully and tasted so good. Man the food was delicious. The whole experience at Blue Ribbon is what you want every time you go out to eat. Great food and service!I will come back again over and over.",5.0
"I recently went back and should update the review!The kids' menu was better. The manager was great with kids. And the sushi was good. I didn't get the paella basquez though.It used to be really really good. It seems they revised the ingredients and portions due to the economy...- burgers: still excellent- paella basquez: no more good seafood. Instead of seafood, greasy chicken. If you love paella with oily chicken and sausages, why not- kid's menu: completely DOWNSIZED - it was so good that I envied my children. Now, it's small, pale, not delicious. Looks like a cheap box meal with all frozen food. Avoid grilled salmon, string beans, yellow rice if you can.Still like the service and clients. Hopefully, they can bring their old style back...",4.0
"Let me start with saying this was my first time @ Blue Ribbon in general.  The recommendation was based off of their fried chicken, of which I had been craving in general for what seems like months.Upon escaping the extreme humidity, we entered a trendy yet casual establishment which was well laid out and had a feeling of comfort.  The host advised us that there would be a minimal wait for a table to be cleaned, so we used this time to scope out the spot.  When we were finally sat, we were placed next to a table with 2 kids who were out of control.  After 10 minutes the kids were driving us crazy so we requested to move.The staff promptly moved us and our food came out shortly thereafter.  The chicken was delicious and while the first impression wasn't great, it was no fault of the establishment.  Stop by and enjoy the deliciousness of the fried chicken:)",4.0
"It's, for some reason, very hard for me to get very excited about Blue Ribbon.  Let's say that what we ate was sufficient for what we paid, and leave it at that.  I mean, for what we paid, which was substantial, it damn well should have been good.  Anything less would have been criminal.  So that's not so thrilling, right?  It's so highly praised in the neighborhood that, I sometimes wonder whether anyone would actually notice if it really wasn't all that good.  Do any of these people actually know the difference between good food and $200-for-2 food?  If a tree falls in the forest and no one hears it, did it really fall? What if Blue Ribbon just served ""good food"" and priced it at $200-for-2, would anyone know the difference?

"This place has really gone downhill.  This used to be our family destination, but for the second time in a row the service was bad and the food lousy.  Fried calamari was soggy to the point of being inedible, then a 45 minute wait for our meal which had clearly been sitting there waiting for us, as it was stone cold. The worst part is it was early and there restaurant wasn't even near capacity. I'm not sure what the problem was.   The veggie burger is a major skip it.  Mushy, tasteless, vile.  when they finally brought our food out, I asked for creme brulee (which our kids love) while we were eating. The waiter told me it comes out fast.  We finish eating, get the check, pay the check, ten minutes later the creme brulee arrives and it is stone cold.  A REALLY bad meal.  Goodbye to our favorite restaurant.",1.0
"My husband and I used to visit Blue Ribbon for date night on occasion and always loved it. Absolutely loved it. They offered great service, nice cocktails, a huge assortment of menu items, and a very, very, pleasant night out--even a little romantic. Tonight we went back and found what felt like an upscale Bennigans. It was packed with Park Slope families and zillions of kids. It was a little less than sexy to order a martini with a mass of sippy cups surrounding us. We usually split a ceasar salad and the lobster/ny strip platter so we've got room for dessert. Every time we do this, the chef splits the portions prior to the plates' delivery to our table--that courtesy is no longer. They delivered one platter, and I had to do the honors. It was seriously annoying. The steak, ordered medium rare, came in at medium. The lobster was slightly overcooked. They gave us one cracker for the lobster shell instead of two. It all just felt cheap. It felt like we'd walked into some wealthy version of the neighborhood diner. Sad.",2.0

"Terrific stuff.Went here recently to celebrate my anniversary with my guy, and had a really lovely meal.  We sat at the bar, which was a good idea, I think.  We got to watch our oysters being shucked, and it was easy to make conversation with others at the bar.  (Another reason I love Brooklyn.)We had the plateau - which is a multi-layered feast of oysters, clams, shrimp (New Orleans and cocktail style), crab, and a 1/2 lobster.  We skipped clams in lieu of more oysters (oysters sooooooo good).All of the seafood was amazingly fresh - it was like the ocean had arrived at our tongues, minus all that pesky seaweed.  This would certainly be a place to return to.  I love the warmth of the room, the affable white-aproned staff, and the quality of what is on the table.",4.0
"We've been here many many times and have never had a bad meal. Service has always been great. It's one of the best restaurants to bring kids to in my opinion -- extensive reasonably priced childrens menu, crayons, etc. The staff are all very accommodating with kids - they are aware they may not have the longest attention span and offer to bring out their entrees first which is very thoughtful. Everything on the menu is great, all of the desserts fantastic (we've tried them all!). Highly recommended.",5.0
"Went there tonight with 3 other people.  Food was excellent and so was the service.  We had Salmon, grilled chicken and steak.  All were excellent.  Appetizers and desserts were great.  Everything was great all around.  Have to rave about the waiter.  He made you feel so comfortable.  For sure we will be going back.  You won't be disappointed.",5.0
"From a great selection of seafood to an eclectic mix of Southern and other Americana food, Blue Ribbon is one of the very best restaurants in Brooklyn. Their raw bar is compares favorably to top raw bars in Manhattan. They always have at least 4 different oysters and also have sea urchins, Louisiana shrimp and scallops. All extremely fresh and market priced. Then, for the meat lovers, you can't go wrong with their Hanger Steak.

"High prices and great recommendations may have unfairly heightened my expectations, but I was generally disappointed by Blue Ribbon.The Bad: The prices are really, really high - like you're in Manhattan, not in a still-gentrifying portion of Brooklyn.

Too over-fried and crispy - it just tasted like oil and was difficult to eat. My date's NY Strip was a tough, chewy bummer.The Good: Blue Ribbon clearly excels at fish. The calamari and the catfish were killer and well worth their high price tags. Even my expensive wine by the glass was pretty good. The space is pretty and Manhattan-y - it feels very high brow - and it has the service to match.

"""Why are we going back if the service was so bad?"" I asked.I had been to Blue Ribbon right after they first opened and remembered the perfection of their fried chicken, their New Orleans shrimp (though I don't think that's what it was called on the menu at the time) and their good wine by the glass list.  I did not remember their service.  It's not in my nature to have any observations beyond the flavor of food.We had just talked about going to Brooklyn Fish Camp, one of my favorites, so this change surprised me, especially because just the day before one of my compadres was telling me that he sort of had it out with the manager there because he asked three different people over the course of an hour and a half if he could get a dozen oysters to take home to his wife (at $3-3.50 a piece) and finally after that time they came back and said because of health regulations they couldn't do it.  So all that time he thought he was waiting for the raw bar guy to shuck them, he was actually waiting to get turned down.I assumed he was exaggerating.  Some people are just complainers.""So... why are we going back?"" I asked again.My three companions turned to look at me, puzzled.  ""Oyster shooters,"" one answered.  ""Fried chicken,"" said another.  ""I'm thinking lobster,"" replied my roommate.We did apps and drinks at the bar, going through two bottles of champagne and about 6 beers.  We asked if we could move to our table for our entrees.  We walked over to a table set for four.  The busboy walks over, looks at the four of us and takes away a place setting.  My champagne induced giggles had set in at this point and I joked that maybe they don't serve women here.""Can I have a setting?""The busboy comes back with three glasses of water. ""Sir, can I have water and a setting?""The busboy comes back with a napkin and a knife.Our waiter comes by.  We explain that we ordered more apps at the bar that we were waiting for.  I ask for a glass of champagne.  And a fork.  And a glass of water.  And a share plate.  Nothing happens.We call over to the bartender to ask where our appetizers are.  He points to the end of the bar opposite to where we were sitting.More of the same, more of the same, more of the same.  I eventually got everything I asked for, one item from every member of the staff individually.  The food was very good, as always, but quite frankly I just don't have the kind of time it takes to eat here.",3.0

"I made a mess of things here. You get a small loaf of bread at your table and god knows that once I've had a few drinks in me, my hand-eye coordination becomes less than stellar. Luckily, this is the type of place where children are also present (welcome to Park Slope!) so my mess of breadcrumbs as I sawed into the loaf was quickly forgiven. Regarding the food, everything was solid. My friend and I came during Dine-In Brooklyn so we opted for the prefix and a bottle of red wine. My appetizer of croquettes came off the specials list and was comforting and my companion loved his chicken liver pate. For entrees, we had the catfish and pasta with squid in its own ink. Both dishes had a lot of kick, lots of pepper and spice, that made them more interesting. I also had the chocolate chip bread pudding for dessert which was less custardy than I would have liked. Tasty, but not something I would order again.  Quality and execution of each dish was tops but innovation is kind of missing. Basically, this is your standard but excellent bistro fare.   What really cinched the experience though and made it worth it was the service. The host was attentive and our waiter, though a bit new and bumbling, was friendly and really cared about our dining experience. He was very excitable as he attempted to call from memory the specials of the night-- I thought it was very cute. After a half hour wait on a busy Saturday night, we were seated at a nice corner table giving us plenty of room to sprawl out. Our glasses were never empty and service from both the waiter and busboys was great. We were not rushed during our meal and languished post-meal with our wine and dessert, feeling right at home with the rest of the dining room. There are basically three areas to sit. The bar, the line of booths adjacent to the bar, as well as the main dining-ish area. Sit in the latter to feel part of it all for a better experience.  At $23 for three-courses and whatever it was for a bottle of wine, Blue Ribbon wins four stars. But I can't imagine returning to pay for the full-priced menu... unless, you know, I lived in the neighborhood and had the money to spend. Quality, dependable, and solid are three apt words to describe this upscale-yet-laidback bistro.",4.0

The crawfish was $12/lb and really good hot or cold, there were also some good east coast oysters (and the best saucing of the night came with them). The chicken liver pate was everything it should be and a small side salad.The entrees, mackerel and pasta, gnocchi in tomato/basil/mozzarella, trout and mushrooms, were all just fine. None of it  memorable though. The mango sorbet was underwhelming, but the bread pudding was good. The beer list is better than many.Stick to the raw bar.",3.0

Tasty, but not something I would order again.  Quality and execution of each dish was tops but innovation is kind of missing. Basically, this is your standard but excellent bistro fare.   What really cinched the experience though and made it worth it was the service. The host was attentive and our waiter, though a bit new and bumbling, was friendly and really cared about our dining experience. He was very excitable as he attempted to call from memory the specials of the night-- I thought it was very cute. After a half hour wait on a busy Saturday night, we were seated at a nice corner table giving us plenty of room to sprawl out. Our glasses were never empty and service from both the waiter and busboys was great. We were not rushed during our meal and languished post-meal with our wine and dessert, feeling right at home with the rest of the dining room. There are basically three areas to sit. The bar, the line of booths adjacent to the bar, as well as the main dining-ish area. Sit in the latter to feel part of it all for a better experience.  At $23 for three-courses and whatever it was for a bottle of wine, Blue Ribbon wins four stars. But I can't imagine returning to pay for the full-priced menu... unless, you know, I lived in the neighborhood and had the money to spend. Quality, dependable, and solid are three apt words to describe this upscale-yet-laidback bistro.",4.0
"This is a lovely restaurant - great place for families. There is a good variety of items on the menu (especially now that Blue Ribbon Sushi has moved in!). The  $1 oyster happy hour is also a pleasure. The place can get crowded and beware of the loud children if you're there early (i.e. happy hour). While I wish this location had the fondue of the Blue Ribbon in the West Village, I'll certainly be back for the oysters!",3.0
"I just don't get it, I guess. Maybe an off-night given the other reviews here. The menu is huge, mostly very simple. The prices are pretty steep, but par for the slope. The crawfish was $12/lb and really good hot or cold, there were also some good east coast oysters (and the best saucing of the night came with them). The chicken liver pate was everything it should be and a small side salad.The entrees, mackerel and pasta, gnocchi in tomato/basil/mozzarella, trout and mushrooms, were all just fine. None of it  memorable though. The mango sorbet was underwhelming, but the bread pudding was good. The beer list is better than many.Stick to the raw bar.",3.0

Been to Blue Ribbon on many occasions.   Last nite I was disappointed.   The service was great but the paella was not up to par.   I've ordered this dish previously and it was always great.   I think the prices have gone up and the quality has gone down.   I remember having prawns in the paella and last nite I received only two little hard shrimp.   Also the glass of wine is a joke for $14.00 the glass and its the size of a juice glass.  My husband and I thought this was our favorite place but I guess that's why it was on the empty side last nite.,3.0
"Sorry, I just had to.  I used to love you guys.  But last night I ordered the grilled salmon, a baked potato, and a mixed green salad.  Sounds pretty simple, right, for a midweek meal?First off, ok, so the guy arrived within 40 mins.  That was reasonable.But...1) Their ordering system SUCKs:  delivery phone number is different from the main restaurant, it's in the kitchen.  You have to shout at the top of your lungs to be heard over the shouting chefs, banging of pots and pans, and they ALWAYS get either the name, the telephone number, the address or the credit card info wrong.  It takes more time and patience to order here than any other place ever.2) Once the food arrives, here's what happens:  the delivery guy takes your credit card, takes an ""imprint"" of it by running his pen over the receipt with your card underneath, and then gets you to sign.  Why can't they just do it like every other place?3) The food:  salmon was about the size of a 1990's cellphone (how's that for specific?), the lettuce in the salad was browning on the edges and it looked like they'd thrown the ingredients in the box from the other side of the kitchen.  Finally, the free bread they include in the order is always yesterday's leftovers... so stale and hard that if I'd thrown it against the wall it would have smashed like porcelain.4) ... And here's the punchline:  the PRICE:  Paid nearly 50 bucks for a measly piece of (not-even-fancy) fish and a side salad?  After all that?  Just so disappointing.I felt guilty for days that I'd even let myself do this.  Sorry Blue Ribbon, never again.",1.0

"With this week being Dine In Brooklyn week, I thought it would e a good idea to check out Blue Ribbon, since its a little on the pricey side, and it would be a good primer to see if we wanted to go back.  Needless to say, our experience was fine, but nothing more.  Seems like a place with such an extensive menu should be offering a bit more on the DIB menu for this event...3 apps, 3 entrees & 3 desserts.  Their menu is longer than most restaurants I go to, and that's all they offer? The DIB menu mentioned 'no substitutions' & didn't even give you the oppty to get something else with a supplemental charge.  However, they did offer up 1 or 2 other specials (croquette app, mussels/fries & lamb shank).  We started with the asparagus vinaigrette & the croquettes...meh...both were boring & didn't have much flavor in my opinion.  My wife is very particular about food & doesn't eat much meat or fish, so she got the veggie burger, which they might as well have called a big flat falafel since all I could taste was chick peas when she gave me a bite.  I can't believe they normally charge $15 for that thing.  (If you are looking for a great veggie burger, Mullanes on Lafayette & S Elliott has the best I've tested in a loooong time). I had the catfish, which I ordered simply because I get the lamb shank half the time when I go to a restaurant that has it, and figured this was the type of place that would do fish well.  Unfortunately, I didn't find it particularly sweet or spicy.  Greens were good, but potatoes were not anything special.  I decided to go for the catfish Desserts (raspberry sorbet & choc chip bread pudding) were good, but not nearly enough to make up for what I considered a boring meal...and one that I'm really glad I didn't pay full price for.

"You know it's a bad sign when you walk into a restaurant and within the first 30 seconds you can tell they are in the weeds.  But I wasn't the decision maker (read, picking up the check) this evening so I kept my mouth shut.  The sign?  A manager climbed up on the bar and lifted the chalk board to snag a box o' wine.  The restaurant was packed and loud but  our party of four was seated immediately, once the host was able to catch up with the line of people waiting.   Then there was the rancid smell of something burning.  I kept thinking it was a menu, but it turns out it's the PuPu platter, served with a sterno flame so you 'crisp up' some of the items.  GROSS!  We started with potato croquettes with a creamy dill sauce that needed a lot more flavor and sauteed calamari which was cooked perfectly and had a great sauce, perfect for the bread on the table.  I ordered the whole red snapper fried, which was ok, maybe a little overcooked.   It was served with a shaved fennel salad that needed some more umph, maybe some acid? and a bizarre oily tomato thing that was posing as a chutney?  It was inedible.  My fellow diners had the catfish (good review), lamb shank (good, too many beans), and the skate (excellent).  We reviewed the dessert menu and decided not to order anything, why are they so expensive?  And nothing really grabbed out interest anyway.  At that point the service completely fell apart.  I don't know what happened to this place.  I used to really enjoy the food, the service, the ambiance.  It's changed.  It felt like I was in a TGIF or Chili's, with the volume, the chaos, and hot and cold service.  Being in the weeds happens to every restaurant.  Surviving isn't good enough, especially if you want your customers to come back.  I'm on the fence.",2.0

"You know it's a bad sign when you walk into a restaurant and within the first 30 seconds you can tell they are in the weeds.  But I wasn't the decision maker (read, picking up the check) this evening so I kept my mouth shut.  The sign?  A manager climbed up on the bar and lifted the chalk board to snag a box o' wine.  The restaurant was packed and loud but  our party of four was seated immediately, once the host was able to catch up with the line of people waiting.   Then there was the rancid smell of something burning.  I kept thinking it was a menu, but it turns out it's the PuPu platter, served with a sterno flame so you 'crisp up' some of the items.  GROSS!  We started with potato croquettes with a creamy dill sauce that needed a lot more flavor and sauteed calamari which was cooked perfectly and had a great sauce, perfect for the bread on the table.  I ordered the whole red snapper fried, which was ok, maybe a little overcooked.   It was served with a shaved fennel salad that needed some more umph, maybe some acid? and a bizarre oily tomato thing that was posing as a chutney?  It was inedible.  My fellow diners had the catfish (good review), lamb shank (good, too many beans), and the skate (excellent).  We reviewed the dessert menu and decided not to order anything, why are they so expensive?  And nothing really grabbed out interest anyway.  At that point the service completely fell apart.  I don't know what happened to this place.  I used to really enjoy the food, the service, the ambiance.  It's changed.  It felt like I was in a TGIF or Chili's, with the volume, the chaos, and hot and cold service.  Being in the weeds happens to every restaurant.  Surviving isn't good enough, especially if you want your customers to come back.  I'm on the fence.",2.0

"Blue Ribbon may not be a 5-star spot, but to rate it anything less than 4 stars is questionable in my opinion and probably represents a grudge of some sort.It's true that in comparison to other Park Slope eateries the prices are on the higher side, but the level of service is nowhere near the same, and the variety on the menu and wine selections are obviously prepared by a staff that know how to craft a fine and varied dining experience.The problem for most of the folks here giving Blue Ribbon a 1- or 2-star rating is they are expecting an orgasmic experience when they lay down $75-$100 per person for dinner.When you have dinner at Blue Ribbon, you're going there for the whole experience, so price DOES NOT equal value.  If you take to time to engage with the wait staff, you will find they are smart, charming and attentive.Generally speaking, when I eat here, one of the things I love is that the regular crowd here has currency as well as money, and the snot-nosed 20-somethings with their latest support check from mommy/daddy don't tend to show up as often as at places like the now-tits-up Patois.",4.0

"I had been to Blue Ribbon Sushi in Manhattan and loved it, so I was dying to try the Brasserie.  However, I was extremely disappointed with the food.  My college friend was kind enough to organize a fun-filled Brooklyn Restaurant Week dinner for a large group of us.  First, the restaurant would not accommodate us when we wanted to add an extra seat to the table...ridiculous!  Granted, the place was packed when we arrived, but still, it was ONE seat!  I was happy to see my friends and in a great mood as we were taken to our table.  However, my Blue Ribbon bitterness began to creep over me again as I sampled the food...Going along with the restaurant's dark wood atmosphere, we received a rustic wooden cutting board topped with a circular loaf of white bread.  I have heard great things about the Blue Ribbon bakery, so I was expecting to be blown away with crusty, doughy goodness.  However, the bread was dry, stale, and reheated.  What a letdown!  When it came to the Restaurant Week menu, I was thrilled to be receiving 3 courses for $23, but the quality definitely lived up to the price.  For the first course, I opted for the Mixed Field Greens Salad.  The leafy greens were served without any additional vegetables and were soaked in a lemony vinaigrette.  I tried to go healthy with a main course of Grilled Salmon, but the dish was accompanied by a tartar sauce and mashed potatoes topped with fried onions.  Four sticks of steamed asparagus were the healthy saving grace on the plate.  I always like when my grilled salmon is presented in a square-shaped piece, rather than a long, thin strip as it was that evening.  I do not know if these are two different standard cuts or from different parts of the fish or what, but I find the lengthy version more mushy and fishy-tasting.  The mashed potatoes were powdery and bland.  While i do not like creamy sauces or onions, the mustardy goo and crispy fried onion slices were the most flavorful components of the dish.  For my final course, I went with the Chocolate Chip Bread Pudding.  Bread pudding is one of my favorite things to bake, and I consider myself a connoisseur of sorts.  Normally, this sweet dessert is presented in a doughy mound, but this version was very thin and more like a blondie than anything else.  It was packed with chocolate, but a bit dry for a pudding.  The dish was topped with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and doused in chocolate sauce.  You would definitely have to love chocolate to appreciate this dish.Moving on from the food, the service was friendly, and the wine list was extensive.  Our bottle of Savignon Blanc was fruity and bold, though a bit acidic.  One of the restaurant walls tastefully housed a glass wine cellar, adding some class to the wooden pub decor.Blue Ribbon seemed like a great place to grab a drink with friends.  You could taste the affordable food if you desire, but I would recommend heading next door to their sushi outpost instead.",2.0

"Blue Ribbon is the kind of place that makes me want to move to Park Slope.  Late-night dining is something that is seriously lacking in DUMBO, and Blue Ribbon is so cozy and warm and comfort-foody...sigh. It's just really, really nice there.One VERY cold Sunday eve a little while back a friend and I were stumbling around the Slope looking for some post-movie dinner, and the first 42 places we went were closed, or had just closed their kitchens.   What is this, the suburbs? we wondered as again and again we were turned away into the freezing air.  Finally, we stumbled into Blue Ribbon, and the angels started singing, the sun rose above the mountain, you get the picture.To warm up, we ordered hot toddies and matzoh ball soup.  The hot toddy was one of the most expertly made I've had, and I'm no softy when it comes to cocktail evaluation.  It was delicious--sweet but not too sweet, honey, lemon, cloves, good whisky...just  perfect.  The matzoh ball soup rivaled my mom's, and they were really nice about splitting the order into two bowls for us.  Next we had the salt-and-pepper shrimp, which come with the shell on, but you can eat the shell!  At first I was a little apprehensive, but it really wasn't any different from eating soft-shell crab--just gave a nice crunch.  Another bonus of eating the shell is that you get more salt, and I've long been of the opinion that more salt = better.Finally, we split the fried chicken, which I think may have been an actual ENTIRE CHICKEN, plus mashed potatoes, gravy and spinach.  Ridiculous amount of food, and all of it insanely delicious.  I am so serious, if I lived in the nabe I'd be here twice a week, easy.  I'd also probably be about 20 lbs heavier, but it might actually be worth it.  Please Blue Ribbon people--Blue Ribbon DUMBO has such a nice ring to it!",5.0

"After a long night at work, all you really want sometimes is a bottle of champagne and a dozen and a half oysters. Maybe some french fries or a grilled shrimp remoulade with fried celery root, but mostly the oysters.

Sitting down in the restaurant part of Blue Ribbon is a different experience, though; the servers in their white shirts and ties milling about in a comfy red dining room serving booths and banquettes is a sight to behold in the wee hours of the morning.I'm more a fan of the appetizers at Blue Ribbon than the actual entree courses, and more and more I've been finding myself having a huge meal consisting of just small plates and pass-arounds rather than having a big honking plate of steak or a surf-and-turf platter.The wine selection is pretty bomb (don't miss the South African Sauvignon Blanc, which is a STEAL), and the beer selection is always good (Anchor Steam on tap is a plus for ll you Bay Area ex-pats).And there's also the one server I can never tell is a guy or a girl (I've not had the [dis?]pleasure of being served by shim), so you tell me.

"The very kind waiter started reading the specials ""Appetizers: Peel & Eat Crawdads"" ...that's all I heard and I was SOLD! We started with yes - the crawdads, 4 oysters and a bottle of Vionger. I'm not an expert in Oysters - so we went with the waiters recommendations. They were GREAT! Served with some nice lemon, garlic and other dips/sauces. Then tackled the crawdads (given the choice - hot or cold. We took'em hot!) with a chipotle butter/mayo dip. My friend had the sole (I believe -  I don't remember.) It was good. My ""Sweet & Spicy Catfish"" was perfect! Melted in my mouth. Served with mashed potato's and greens. We left full but not stuffed. It was perfect...The atmosphere? Awesome. Dimly lit, lots of dark natural wood. Casual/formal - could go either way. There's a bar in front. We walked in without a reservation on a Saturday night around 7:30 PM. Had a drink at the bar (I was happy to order my hometown fav Anchor Steam), chatted with some local strangers that claim to be regulars and strongly suggested we get the raw bar platter (but that was a bit too steep for our wallets - looked great though), and sat down maybe 20 - 30 minutes later. Service? Excellent. Great wine selection - a large but definitely not overwhelming menu. Price? Totally fair for what it is - to do it right expect to spend $75 - $100 per person (including drinks, appetizers, entree and some tastings from the raw bar).

Me and a group of friends went to blue ribbon for a birthday dinner. The atmosphere is relaxing but I immediately disliked how dark it was. Went straight to our table in the back next to the wine room. We all ordered and it took FOREVER to get any kind of appetizer out of the kitchen. They didn't even offer us any bread while we waited-we had to ask. After waiting for awhile we were told that the calamari we ordered was no longer in stock so we ordered the shrimp. I HATE waiting for my food especially when I was hungry but the shrimp was very good and worth the wait. I just wish they would have communicated better with us. The cocktail menu isn't very impressive. I had the hanger steak which was pretty yummy. Cooked perfectly to my liking. The onion rings were EXTREMELY salty though. My friend had sushi and I tried a piece but wasn't very impressed. For the price I expected more. Not a very memorable restaurant but it was worth trying out. Don't see myself going back there.,3.0

"Blue Ribbon is the kind of place that makes me want to move to Park Slope.  Late-night dining is something that is seriously lacking in DUMBO, and Blue Ribbon is so cozy and warm and comfort-foody...sigh. It's just really, really nice there.One VERY cold Sunday eve a little while back a friend and I were stumbling around the Slope looking for some post-movie dinner, and the first 42 places we went were closed, or had just closed their kitchens.   What is this, the suburbs? we wondered as again and again we were turned away into the freezing air.  Finally, we stumbled into Blue Ribbon, and the angels started singing, the sun rose above the mountain, you get the picture.To warm up, we ordered hot toddies and matzoh ball soup.  The hot toddy was one of the most expertly made I've had, and I'm no softy when it comes to cocktail evaluation.  It was delicious--sweet but not too sweet, honey, lemon, cloves, good whisky...just  perfect.  The matzoh ball soup rivaled my mom's, and they were really nice about splitting the order into two bowls for us.  Next we had the salt-and-pepper shrimp, which come with the shell on, but you can eat the shell!  At first I was a little apprehensive, but it really wasn't any different from eating soft-shell crab--just gave a nice crunch.  Another bonus of eating the shell is that you get more salt, and I've long been of the opinion that more salt = better.Finally, we split the fried chicken, which I think may have been an actual ENTIRE CHICKEN, plus mashed potatoes, gravy and spinach.  Ridiculous amount of food, and all of it insanely delicious.  I am so serious, if I lived in the nabe I'd be here twice a week, easy.  I'd also probably be about 20 lbs heavier, but it might actually be worth it.  Please Blue Ribbon people--Blue Ribbon DUMBO has such a nice ring to it!",5.0

"Amazing!  I treated my husband to his birthday dinner at Blue Ribbon and we were both blown away by the food.  For starters we had the potato and gruyere croquettes and the spare ribs - delicious.  The croquettes were light and perfectly fried, and the meat just fell off of the ribs.  For the main course I had the whole grilled fish of the day with vegetables and my husband had the surf and turf - also fantastic.  The fish was very fresh and my husband's steak was excellent. We ended the meal with profiteroles with ice cream and hot fudge - wow.  The wait staff and host were very friendly - always key in my book.Can't wait to go back!",5.0
"After a long night at work, all you really want sometimes is a bottle of champagne and a dozen and a half oysters. Maybe some french fries or a grilled shrimp remoulade with fried celery root, but mostly the oysters. And of course it's all you want at midnight on a weekday, but there's this place, you see, called Blue Ribbon Brooklyn...Not just all of the above, but you can do all of the above at the bar, which, in my book, is a wonderful, wonderful blessing. Sitting down in the restaurant part of Blue Ribbon is a different experience, though; the servers in their white shirts and ties milling about in a comfy red dining room serving booths and banquettes is a sight to behold in the wee hours of the morning.I'm more a fan of the appetizers at Blue Ribbon than the actual entree courses, and more and more I've been finding myself having a huge meal consisting of just small plates and pass-arounds rather than having a big honking plate of steak or a surf-and-turf platter.The wine selection is pretty bomb (don't miss the South African Sauvignon Blanc, which is a STEAL), and the beer selection is always good (Anchor Steam on tap is a plus for ll you Bay Area ex-pats).And there's also the one server I can never tell is a guy or a girl (I've not had the [dis?]pleasure of being served by shim), so you tell me. Three yeses (food, drinks and atmosphere!) and a big maybe (that server...)!",4.0

Then tackled the crawdads (given the choice - hot or cold. We took'em hot!) with a chipotle butter/mayo dip. My friend had the sole (I believe -  I don't remember.) It was good.

"now, blue ribbon, it's time to come clean.  you're all hype, right?  arencha? i mean. honestly, let's get it out there.  and in this review, i shall present evidence.  first of all, i was led to believe one cannot get close to this place on a given night unless one is willing to either a) abide a copious wait or else b) is willing to eat dinner at 530pm (which, if i do, I am most assuredly passed out by 9).  but, my boyfriend and i sauntered in with nary a delay on a friday night at 8pm.   where are the droves blue ribbon?  did you make them up?second, i think all fancy restuarants should admit they are chintzy with their ""bargain"" meals.  which, by the by, are not such a bargain.  restaurant week and yelp eats, this means you.  while $30 or $40 seems like a great deal for 3 courses, I'd much rather spend $25 on one entree and actually enjoy it.Yelp eats: some standout disappointments were the short ribs.  mostly gristle, the meat i could pull off was chewy and bland. and, despite having high hopes for the shrimp and chorizo, it ended up being totally unbalanced, with the chorizo completely overwhelming the shrimp (although the sauce that came with it--par excellence!) i've found that restaurants that disappoint during resto week are much improved when i order off the regular menu, so i'm not completely writing off blue ribbon yet.  but it's lost some of it's previous cache.",2.0
"I was in Park Slope trying to find a place to eat. I had really wanted to eat at Blue Ribbpon Sushi but it would have been a longer wait so we decided on the Brasserie instead. I ordered the hanger steak with wild mushrooms and onion rings which was delicious! My friend ordered the red snapper special with a side of rice and beans. Then for dessert, we ordered the profiteroles. I thought the food was great, the atmosphere was date, family, friend oriented. We had to wait about 20 mins for our table and so we just ordered water at the bar and the bartender was nice enough to keep refilling our water,which is rare for a bar.

"After reading the reviews, I was quite excited to try this place out. The service and atmosphere were great. Casual, yet classy. Good and attentive wait staff who took care of our large group expertly. The fish soup - with a mix of octopus, salmon and white fish - was very tasty. Reminds me a lot of the Southeast Asian style of fish soup (with noodles or rice).. quite delicious. Something to take note of: It doesn't say so on the menu, but they put shrimp in the fish soup as well. Since I'm allergic (very sad about this), I had to send it back and get one without any shrimp. I ordered the hangar steak over onion rings and mushrooms, medium-rare to rare... and it came medium-rare to medium. Very unimpressed. The meat was quite tough as well, and the seasoning wasn't as good as it could be. The mushrooms and onion rings were very well prepared though.. too bad the highlight of the dish paled horribly in comparison. In general, most of the table seemed ""okay"" with their dishes. No one was really raving about how good the food was.. what a pity, especially for the hype and the price. Will not be going back.",3.0

"This has been a favorite since I moved here almost 3 years ago, and it's become my go-to place when I have out-of-town visitors. Why? Excellent service, good food, fun atmosphere. Everyone we've ever brought here has truly enjoyed the experience.I really love the chilled seafood tower - it's not cheap, but it's such a fun, interactive meal. Another favorite on the apps list is the calamari - it's sauteed with garlic in white wine, and it's to die for. It's a must-have for us every time! Usually you get fried calamari when you eat out, but this is such a wonderfully flavorful (and hopefully a little healthier) alternative!Also tried the escargot traditional (garlic, butter) - never thought I'd like eating snails, but this was great. The fried oysters, foie gras terrine, whole roast garlic, garlic shrimp and chorizo, everything has been wonderful. And they serve bread that is warm and crusty, like it's fresh out of the oven - this is great for soaking up any sauces from your apps! On the entrees list, I've tried the paella royale, which was tasty and could feed a small family, the striped bass, the lobster, sweet and spicy catfish, skate, and hanger steak, and all have been delicious. I've yet to have a bad meal here.Wine list is great, and servers all seem fairly knowledgable about the selections, which gives Blue Ribbon's service the extra edge.And last but not least, dessert - you MUST try the chocolate chip bread pudding. They put it on a griddle so that it gets a nice crust on the outside, and it's served a la mode with hot fudge. Be sure to save room for this, as it's rich and heavy, but oh-so-worth-it! We've also tried the chocolate bruno (very very rich and chocolatey), fresh berries (served w/ whipped cream), profiteroles, hot fudge sundae, and a special bread pudding that was served with a port sauce. That last one was a hit with my parents when they visited from SF. It's not cheap to eat at Blue Ribbon Brooklyn, but I know I'm guaranteed amazing service, great food, and overall, a great evening. And if you're lucky, you might spot a local celeb from the neighborhood!",5.0

"now, blue ribbon, it's time to come clean.  you're all hype, right?  arencha? i mean. honestly, let's get it out there.  and in this review, i shall present evidence.  first of all, i was led to believe one cannot get close to this place on a given night unless one is willing to either a) abide a copious wait or else b) is willing to eat dinner at 530pm (which, if i do, I am most assuredly passed out by 9).  but, my boyfriend and i sauntered in with nary a delay on a friday night at 8pm.   where are the droves blue ribbon?  did you make them up?second, i think all fancy restuarants should admit they are chintzy with their ""bargain"" meals.  which, by the by, are not such a bargain.  restaurant week and yelp eats, this means you.  while $30 or $40 seems like a great deal for 3 courses, I'd much rather spend $25 on one entree and actually enjoy it.Yelp eats: some standout disappointments were the short ribs.  mostly gristle, the meat i could pull off was chewy and bland. and, despite having high hopes for the shrimp and chorizo, it ended up being totally unbalanced, with the chorizo completely overwhelming the shrimp (although the sauce that came with it--par excellence!) i've found that restaurants that disappoint during resto week are much improved when i order off the regular menu, so i'm not completely writing off blue ribbon yet.  but it's lost some of it's previous cache.",2.0
"I was in Park Slope trying to find a place to eat. I had really wanted to eat at Blue Ribbpon Sushi but it would have been a longer wait so we decided on the Brasserie instead. I ordered the hanger steak with wild mushrooms and onion rings which was delicious! My friend ordered the red snapper special with a side of rice and beans. Then for dessert, we ordered the profiteroles. I thought the food was great, the atmosphere was date, family, friend oriented. We had to wait about 20 mins for our table and so we just ordered water at the bar and the bartender was nice enough to keep refilling our water,which is rare for a bar. OVerall, I believe that Blue Ribbon lives up to its name.",4.0
"After reading the reviews, I was quite excited to try this place out. The service and atmosphere were great. Casual, yet classy. Good and attentive wait staff who took care of our large group expertly. The fish soup - with a mix of octopus, salmon and white fish - was very tasty. Reminds me a lot of the Southeast Asian style of fish soup (with noodles or rice).. quite delicious. Something to take note of: It doesn't say so on the menu, but they put shrimp in the fish soup as well. Since I'm allergic (very sad about this), I had to send it back and get one without any shrimp. I ordered the hangar steak over onion rings and mushrooms, medium-rare to rare... and it came medium-rare to medium. Very unimpressed. The meat was quite tough as well, and the seasoning wasn't as good as it could be. The mushrooms and onion rings were very well prepared though.. too bad the highlight of the dish paled horribly in comparison. In general, most of the table seemed ""okay"" with their dishes. No one was really raving about how good the food was.. what a pity, especially for the hype and the price. Will not be going back.",3.0

"This has been a favorite since I moved here almost 3 years ago, and it's become my go-to place when I have out-of-town visitors. Why? Excellent service, good food, fun atmosphere. Everyone we've ever brought here has truly enjoyed the experience.I really love the chilled seafood tower - it's not cheap, but it's such a fun, interactive meal. Another favorite on the apps list is the calamari - it's sauteed with garlic in white wine, and it's to die for. It's a must-have for us every time! Usually you get fried calamari when you eat out, but this is such a wonderfully flavorful (and hopefully a little healthier) alternative!Also tried the escargot traditional (garlic, butter) - never thought I'd like eating snails, but this was great. The fried oysters, foie gras terrine, whole roast garlic, garlic shrimp and chorizo, everything has been wonderful. And they serve bread that is warm and crusty, like it's fresh out of the oven - this is great for soaking up any sauces from your apps! On the entrees list, I've tried the paella royale, which was tasty and could feed a small family, the striped bass, the lobster, sweet and spicy catfish, skate, and hanger steak, and all have been delicious. I've yet to have a bad meal here.Wine list is great, and servers all seem fairly knowledgable about the selections, which gives Blue Ribbon's service the extra edge.And last but not least, dessert - you MUST try the chocolate chip bread pudding. They put it on a griddle so that it gets a nice crust on the outside, and it's served a la mode with hot fudge. Be sure to save room for this, as it's rich and heavy, but oh-so-worth-it! We've also tried the chocolate bruno (very very rich and chocolatey), fresh berries (served w/ whipped cream), profiteroles, hot fudge sundae, and a special bread pudding that was served with a port sauce. That last one was a hit with my parents when they visited from SF. It's not cheap to eat at Blue Ribbon Brooklyn, but I know I'm guaranteed amazing service, great food, and overall, a great evening. And if you're lucky, you might spot a local celeb from the neighborhood!",5.0
"This is one of my staples! I have been a patron since they opened their doors and I will be a devoted customer for as long as they are open. The food is delicious and the service is on point.

"Absolutely love this place! They're open late, the wait staff is on point, the food is delicious.  Every time I go there I gotta have the sauteèd calamari as an appetizer. That sauce is to die for! If you're a couple, they seat you in a cozy conner. It's the best. Very cool and casual.",5.0

"I brought my bf here for his bday and was extremely happy with the ambiance, menu selection, food and service.  Perhaps due to the BK location, the restaurant was surprisingly low-key and unpretentious - which is saying more than certain Park Slope venues.  We ordered some of the featured oysters, shrimp cocktail, paella magdalena and chocolate brouno for dessert and not only would I gladly order the same items next time, but I would also recommend the dishes our neighbors ordered as well (they looked so yummy!  and I could easily tell they were happy with their food too).  Our server was very attentive and when he started getting busy with a big group halfway through our meal, someone else (I think the manager or sous-manager?) started filling in for him so it was all nice and seamless.  If anything, I probably could've used an extra 10 minutes to digest before dessert!In any case, I can't wait to go back for our next special occasion.",5.0
"One of the most overpriced restaurants around! Outrageously expensive, particularly for what you get. We were a party of four and had a host of dishes and wine. Not one stood out, not one was memorable, not one was worth the price. There is no justification to pay these kinds of prices for what this place has to offer. Really. The main reason I came was to try their 40oz steak, after reading rave reviews about it. Honestly, the entire group agreed that the steak I prepare, in my humble apartment, is far superior. The meat wasn't great and the preparation seriously lacking (don't they know the difference between rare and medium rare?). We all agreed that Convivium's steak blows this one out of the water without a doubt, in terms of qualify, preparation, flavor, and value. The salads were mediocre (aside for the dollop of warm goat cheese which was good), the bone marrow, while quite good, was ridiculously overpriced, the chicken wings abysmal, the pierogies nothing to write home about, some other dishes were just ok. Overall, the food wasn't awful (hence the two stars) but the appropriate price for that level of food should have been 40-50% cheaper. When you spend that kind of money on a meal, you expect to be blown away, but this was a far cry from that. I should note that the service was good (though not great, but I won't take off points for that because service is not a big deal for me). We all left disappointed and with a big hole in our pocket. Bottom line: ""Meh. I've experienced better."" I cannot recommend this place and I will not return.",2.0
"What has become of Blue Ribbon?  I write this review as someone who used to list BR among his favorite restaurants in all of NYC...it seems silly now but it's true.   But in any event it has slid way down hill.Went there last night and was disappointed at every turn.  The bartender poured a weak, but expensive, pre-dinner cocktail to start me off.  Once seated, I ordered the paella basquez for dinner and while it was totally fine, it was nothing to write home about, and certainly not worth the price.  The flavors were generally pretty decent, but the extremely spicy sausage was a misstep given the flavor profile of the rest of the dish.  My friend had the salmon and it was totally lackluster, and the portion too small.But the biggest problem at Blue Ribbon, without question, is the prices.  BR is basically doing (only slightly upscale) comfort food.  But their prices are truly insane.  Fried chicken for $24?  Huh?  Pretty much every dish is five to ten dollars more than it should be.  The prices have definitely gone way up since the glory days of Blue Ribbon.  It was never cheap, but, in the past, I never felt like I was getting ripped off.  Unfortunately, last night, that's exactly how I felt.  Maybe that explains why the place was 2/3 empty?Last night's meal was worth 2 stars, but I'll throw in an extra star because I can't help but reflect on how good BR used to be and because, as others have noted, the service is still very friendly and attentive.",3.0
"I gave this place three stars because is just not ""My Thing"" but I think on the whole what Blue Ribbon does what they do extremely well. The service is outstanding and the management was very perceptive to our subtle displeasure in one of our en-trees. I think the problem is that were not use to eating food that heavy and rich. We eat heavy food and rich food, but not the both. I got the skate expecting a lighter meal and it was breaded and everything was laden in garlic and butter which is delicious, but not my thing.

We also split the special app: roasted tomatoes & eggplant with mozzarella... can't go wrong with a combo like that, especially when they serve an XL portion!  our waiter was pretty enthusiastic too.. maybe bc it was a slow monday night? talkative without being overbearing, but knows the menu and wine list inside-out..

"i wanted to give it 5 stars, i really did, and i'll tell you why i didn't coming up.  first and foremost, you have to try the beef marrow and oxtail marmalade.  i think when it comes to food you can never judge a book by it's cover and this dish is no exception.  had it not been for friends who ordered the dish for the table, we probably would have been guilty of not following the above cliche.  AND, had it not been for their friends doing the same for them, they would have missed out.  so i'm quite thankful we have friends who have friends who like oxtail.  simply put, it's amazing.the fifth star i reserve for restaurants where you can't really go wrong with anything on the menu.  unfortunately, i have had a couple dismal dinners here and the verdict all hung on the entree.  everything else about this restaurant is top-notch; even the bread & butter is 5 star quality.  thankfully there's a wide selection on the menu.remember, beef marrow and oxtail marmalade.  trust me, and my friends, and their friends.",4.0
"We waited an hour for a table for 4 on a busy Saturday night, but it was so worth it!  Try the Escargot Bourguignon (it's a chef's special).  My hanger steak was excellent and my friends also enjoyed their meals.  I tried someone's skate and it was cooked perfectly (tender and juicy).  Next time I'm in the area, I would definitely go back.  Yum!",4.0
"This place has rocked for years. The drinks are great, the lighting makes everyone look hot. They have delicious sauteed collard greens and the best sparkling water ever.

"Ok... I guess its safe to say that you like a place if u go there frequently. What more can I say, I have never been disappointed with a meal from this restaurant. So lets start with the appetizers. I love, love their calamari. Its sauteed to the ultimate goodness. And as my S.O. at the time taught me, if you dip their bread in the sauce, You have tasted heaven. I really do enjoy their calamari. So lets move over to their appetizing wings, which come with ur own little kettle to grill it for a smoked, crusty taste. I LOVE IT!!! The sauce on the wings, tend to be an acquired taste, but this Chica definitely loves it. Since I have gone here on different occasions, I can say I love their mashed potatoes as well.  MY SO said to me"" I wished u looked at me the way I looked after my first bite of the potatoes"". Just imagine Land of Creamy. I love it. Was pleased with the Fish of the Day on two occasions. And also their Paella (there are three) whichever one u can not go wrong( talk about generous leftovers). Its enough to feed three in my opinion. One place I will continue to go to and definitely left happy and satisfied.",4.0
"Delicious food... I looove the fish stew. You guys must try it! The escargo is also extremely good. Desserts are fantastic, especially the creme brulee and chocolate bruno.

"Oh. Dear. Gods. The escargot at the Blue Hill is amazing. Little tiny snails (I know, I know, and I just don't care) absolutely swimming in their individual little pots of butter and garlic. You can charge me whatever you want for a fancy French name for a gardener's hated nemesis, and I will pay it, because they are tasty. I know all you who are squeamish will think I'm crazy, but that is all right. I will eat your escargot as well. And dip my bread in the little cavern of buttery deliciousness left behind. And then I will let out my belt three notches, and vow that I will rock-climb on the morrow as punishment for my indulgence. But I won't. And that will be my secret. Also, our waitress never wavered when my friend and I told her a) we'd be ordering a bunch of appetizers instead of an appetizer and entree and b) that she was not drinking wine (a teetotaller, that girl. Madness, I tell you). I know I always got a little skeptical about my tip when those things happened, and kudos to the waitress for not letting her fear show in her service. She was a doll. Tip your waitresses well. Spread the word.",5.0
"NEWBIE! this was my first meal on my first night of moving to New York. which was a while ago, but it still remains in my noggin very vividly. the ambience is very nice and the room oozed ""energy"" from servers, customers, and even the food. i love their portions b/c you can easily split it between two and still be satisfied. i had a classic burger w/ salad. the cocktail i had was a bit strong (but that's how i like it) and i spilled my glass of water all over the table. Oops! but nobody huffed and puffed about it. they gladly cleaned up the mess and didn't make me feel like an idiot. how nice for this tipsy girl! haha. i love the neighborhood, the location, the people, and vibe altogether. it's one of those places that you instantly fall inlove w/ Brooklyn. but if you're already there... you find that you have a crush on Parkslope.",4.0
"Dine-in-Brooklyn dinner. When I tried the tomato soup as appetizer my jaw dropped. Amazing! I also had lamb shank which was OK. Good size.  Bread pudding OK too.I came at 9 pm on a Sunday without reservations, and was seated immediately.  Service is truly good.  The decor is fair.  I ended the night full, and glad to have tried this place out.   All in all it seems an above average restaurant for Brooklyn, worthy to be recommended.  Try to tomato soup!",4.0

"This is one of my favorite restaurants in NYC.  The first time I went there was at 2am on Tuesday and it was as if it was 8pm on a Saturday in there.  Large groups of people eating and drinking, having a great time.  For a night owl like me, this is what I like to see.  If you sit at the bar, they are VERY good to you.  My girlfriend comes in here with some of her hot friends sometimes and they sit at the bar; she swears she pays for every other drink.  Myself- they're sent me over extra raw bar before - I'm not complaining.  The tomato soup is incredible,  The chocolate chip bread pudding, the raw bar is fantastic, I usually get some west coast oysters and a glass of prosecco and I'm quite pleased.  The attention to detail is excellent - they manage to pull off the hard tails on they're shrimp cocktail while leaving the meat perfectly intact, and they serve budweiser in actual budweiser pilsner glasses.I love this place.They don't take reservations for small parties, expect a wait at premium hours, and parking is really difficult here.  Expensive!",5.0
I meant to go to the sushi place next door and ended up here. The menu looked good and it was crowded so I figured it would be great. First off it was overpriced. I have no problem paying for a good meal but this was a little ridiculous. I had the Hanger steak and asked for it to be medium rare. There were 3 pieces on my plate and 1 piece was close to medium and the other 2 were burnt. The only part that redeemed the meal was the delicious mushrooms and onion rings that came with it. The husband got a tofu ravioli and it was pretty good. The plate was filled with tons of veggies.

"I hardly ever write reviews, but felt compelled to this time. I used to love this restaurant, the fried chicken is amazing. Service was always top notch and not too crowded if you go early. But unfortunately the owners ended the lease on Blue Ribbon Sushi next door and decided to merge the 2 restaurants together. What has resulted is an overly crowded restaurant unable to keep up with the the flow of customers and level of service. Our waiter, who seemed very inexperienced, didn't come by for at least 15 minutes. He then forgot to give us menus and proceeded to tell us specials and then asked us, ""is there anything else I can get you?"" We told him he can give us some menus! It then took over 30 mins to get our appetizers and more than an hour for the food. When I walked through the restaurant on the way to the restroom I noticed many tables who were still waiting for their food. Once we got our order, however, the taste and quality did live up to it's standards. Other waitstaff did also come by to check how the food was, etc, but I was still really disappointed at how different the restaurant felt prior to the merge. Blue Ribbon Sushi was a pretty nice restaurant, with it's own decor and setting, and it's a shame to see it water downed to a side menu at the Brasserie. Last but not least, the busboy clearing the table dropped utensils twice on me and my daughter when clearing the table. Thank goodness one was just a butter knife and not a steak knife! He tried to apologize but was so embarassed just ran away after the second time! I'm not sure if they just got a bunch of new waitstaff, but I was pretty appalled. C'mon Blue Ribbon guys - you gotta work on training - while you're at it, bring back Blue Ribbon Sushi!!",3.0
"Blue Ribbon is ok, just ok.  I would not go out of my way to eat here again.  The staff was gracious, but I found the timing of the food to be lacking.  The food is nothing more than ok.  The mixed salad seemed like a handful of the stuff from the box.  The steamed artichoke was pretty bland.  One of us ordered a steak that was good, but salty.  The other ordered salmon, tasty once I found it on the plate.  Truly it could not have been more than 2 ounces of fish.  The mashed potatoes and fried potatoes were good, but the dish should have been called carbs with salmon on the side.  And ok, I know I am not a 20 something, but it was so damn dark at my table I had to ask for a flashlight to read the menu--and I wasn't the first since they in fact had a flashlight.  Oh and no booze, coffee or dessert, no bottled water and 2 apps and 2 dinners was a hundred bucks with tip.",3.0
The food and service are awesome.  My favorite restaurant in Park Slope.,5.0
"Recently celebrated my birthday here.  Went all out and everything we ordered was great; highly recommend the salt and pepper shrimp (appetizer), and the fried chicken was AMAZING.  You just can't imagine how good it is until you give it a try.  We couldn't decide on desserts... so we had two.  The chocolate chip bread pudding was one of the most amazing desserts I've ever had.  Portions were huge and service was excellent.  The only reasons why I give it 4 out of 5: a bit on the pricey side (but you taste the quality and care in the food) and dining room is loud - not the most romatic setting.",4.0
"Ok, I might be going at this the wrong way. The service is great here. They have a large wine selection and fresh clams/oysters but the price is just way too much for me to wrap my head around. I've ordered the steak several times with varying degrees of success but the one meal that has actually been worth the price was the trout dish I recently ordered. This place is too much for the food when you've got an al di la or stone park on either side so I'm giving it three stars for that. But it's a fun environment that's not pretentious so that's cool.",3.0

"Amazing food.  Moderately priced for the fantastic variety.  Aside from the predictable seafood and carnes there are random listings pierogos, artichokes, fried chicken- who the heck put together this menu a mind reader???  Best place to go for fun americana in Park Slope.Warm, impressive atmosphere, great staff...",5.0
"I had a good, fun time at Blue Ribbon last night. Hubby and I shared the pork ribs, shrimp cocktail, raw clams, fried oysters and a bottle of Sauvigon Blanc. The whole dinner of appetizers was $92 and really tasty. To my mind, there was nothing sophisticated or innovative about what we had --the ribs were a bit too sweet; the cocktail sauce was a touch bland-- but overall everything was balanced and perfect for a 1 AM dinner.",4.0
"I have tried so many different dishes here and have only been disappointed once, which is pretty damn impressive. They also do restaurant week which is super tasty and satisfying.",4.0
"I actually prefer this location, and similar to how I feel about Bar Tabac on Smith Street, this place captures the energy of its neighborhood and I make special trips to hang out with my BK friends. I can always count on a great night out here. I won't get into the food, as that's pretty self-explanatory, but I will say this place bustles, so prepared to be flexible on sitting at the bar. Isn't that more fun anyway?",5.0
"I hardly ever write reviews, but felt compelled to this time. I used to love this restaurant, the fried chicken is amazing. Service was always top notch and not too crowded if you go early. But unfortunately the owners ended the lease on Blue Ribbon Sushi next door and decided to merge the 2 restaurants together. What has resulted is an overly crowded restaurant unable to keep up with the the flow of customers and level of service. Our waiter, who seemed very inexperienced, didn't come by for at least 15 minutes. He then forgot to give us menus and proceeded to tell us specials and then asked us, ""is there anything else I can get you?"" We told him he can give us some menus! It then took over 30 mins to get our appetizers and more than an hour for the food. When I walked through the restaurant on the way to the restroom I noticed many tables who were still waiting for their food. Once we got our order, however, the taste and quality did live up to it's standards. Other waitstaff did also come by to check how the food was, etc, but I was still really disappointed at how different the restaurant felt prior to the merge. Blue Ribbon Sushi was a pretty nice restaurant, with it's own decor and setting, and it's a shame to see it water downed to a side menu at the Brasserie. Last but not least, the busboy clearing the table dropped utensils twice on me and my daughter when clearing the table. Thank goodness one was just a butter knife and not a steak knife! He tried to apologize but was so embarassed just ran away after the second time! I'm not sure if they just got a bunch of new waitstaff, but I was pretty appalled.

"Mmmmm. I'm so happy I went here for restaurant week--unlike some other places, they don't serve the prix price menu people second-rate stuff (and if this is second rate, then bravo!) I got the pork belly for my appetizer, a mistake as it was too fatty even for my cholesterol loving ways. Have to say the appetizers seemed a little bland (selections include Caeser salad, lentil soup). Wish they would have taken more risk here. Moved on to a most tasty and generously sized grilled salmon, which was accompanied by buttery mashed potatoes, fresh asparagus and crumbly fried (but not greasy) potatoes. Surprisingly, the real standout was my dessert. I never hold high expectations for desserts unless I go to a place that is known for their sweets--too often, the dessert is treated as an afterthought or imported from a bakery and marked up a lot. But I got the bread pudding and was blown away by how good it was (God bless the pastry chef that makes me salivate at the thought of biting into bread pudding!) It had a smore-like, smoky flavor, as though it had been slowly toasted over a fire. Came smothered in a rich chocolate sauce and was topped by a ball of fine vanilla ice cream. Such a perfect end to a great meal. Oh and our waiter was really great in that he took the time to answer our questions and patiently explained what was on the menu.",4.0
"I came here with a friend and we dined on her expense account, so I can't really account for the prices.  I do know that our bill came to nearly $200, but that the food was fantastic.  The bread was warm and fresh and delicious; the paella is huge and has an ocean's worth of seafood in it.  Our waiter was really helpful with the wine selection, and the service was great overall.",4.0
"really disappointing. i've enjoyed blue ribbon in manhattan, but i won't be coming to this location again. the decor and the service were both great, but our fish dishes were a bust. our waiter recommended the salmon as his favorite fish on the menu, but it was a tad overcooked and didn't have much flavor. my friend had the trout with mushrooms, but i swear the fish was close to leather, and she ended up having stomach problems for most of the night afterwards. and what up with ""sweet and spicy red snapper"" on the menu? give me one or the other (preferably spicy), but not both.",2.0
"Blue Ribbon Brooklyn was just okay, which I'm sad to say.  I had such high expectations because of everything I had read and heard.  Ryan ordered the pork belly, which was a 1.5 inch thick piece of fat with a tiny piece of meat attached.  Disgusting to say the least.  My appetizer and entree were fine but not exciting, and though the service was great (they even took Ryan's fat away and got him soup instead), that's not enough to get me to return.  The prices are way too high for the quality of food (c'mon, we're in Brooklyn, remember?) and the wait for a table was long.",3.0
