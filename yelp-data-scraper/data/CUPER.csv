"We dropped by here on a Wednesday night for drinks and nibbles.  We ordered the Cuban sandwich and Caldo Verde soup with a smoked salmon starter.  The starter was a very generous portion of smoked salmon on a slab served with a few pieces of crostini, mustard and mayo spreads.  We were impressed with the quality of the salmon and when paired with the mayo ( which I think was homemade) it melted in our mouths.  The kale and potato soup was simple and nourishing.  The kale still was cooked perfectly and still had bite.  The broth was hearty and slightly creamy.  I wish we had ordered two servings of it--one wasn't enough.  My partners Cuban sandwich was huge and was press grilled nicely-- toasty on the outside soft on the inside.  The inside was filled with slices of roast pork and ham.  We could only finish half of it.  Service was excellent.  The owner / manager looked after us well.  The atmosphere was warm and inviting--we will be back.",5.0
"This place feels like the last secret in DUMBO - it's the perfect place for a lowkey work lunch, an afternoon coffee, or a panini to go if you feel like eating at your desk. I'm partial to the Bruno (their sliced chorizo and cheddar panini), but I hear they do a mean Cuban too. Sandwiches are $9 - $10, everybody who works here makes you feel like family and seems to genuinely enjoy what they do, and the space itself is the perfect mix of hip and inviting. Cuper is the real deal.",5.0
"I admit I hesitated to write this review because Cuper feels like a wonderful DUMBO secret and I don't want it to become a zoo like everywhere else in the neighborhood... But they are doing a great job and deserve more business.I first dropped in by accident at the end of last year. I had noticed Cuper but thought it was only available to the IFP center -- not true, I quickly learned! Since then I have used Cuper as my #1 meeting spot. The team is incredibly friendly and very accommodating, whether I am just meeting for coffee or staying around to eat, they always offer a warm welcome. They do a great coffee, I love the paninis and If you ask nicely, they also whip up a great hot chocolate. It's also a good spot if you want to grab low key drinks after work. Overall, this place is a calmer alternative to the crazy of BRC around the corner, and a great option for getting work done while enjoying some tasty food. I hope they stick around, so please check them out (but then let's keep it our little secret, OK?).",5.0

"Very nice sandwich, very nice place and very nice people. But like everyone else has said, I'd like to keep it a secret. You don't come by places like this anymore where people actually want to know who you are and what you're about. Loved everything.",5.0
"I went to Cuper with friends & family for dinner before seeing a performance at the GK Arts Center around the corner. It was an excellent choice. The food was good and reasonably priced; Johnny, our host (owner?) was charming; atmosphere was relaxed. Check it out!",5.0

"My new favorite spot. Just moved to The neighborhood and stumbled upon this awesome little place right by the water. Nice large, open, modern space with a surprisingly intimate atmosphere. Came in for dinner after work once I saw the bar through the floor to ceiling Windows while driving past. Small crowd inside, but bustling for a Tuesday night. Grabbed a seat at the bar and was instantly greeted by Johnny behind the bar. Cool guy who will make you feel instantly welcome and knows his product. He took the time to go over both the beer and wine menu with me, both had solid selections. Ended up with a bottle of pretty things Jack D'or, delicious if you haven't tried. Took a glance at the menu and found they had a nice and simple menu of sandwiches, paninis, soups, and charcuterie. Had Maria, the manager I believe, give some recommendations and went with the caldo verde (tasted like they shipped it straight from Portugal) and the imperioli (named after Johnny behind the bar). Both pretty damn delicious. Hung out for a bit and ended up chatting with all of the employees working that night. Great group of people who will make you feel welcome and part of their crew instantly. Good times all around. Will definitely be back.",5.0
