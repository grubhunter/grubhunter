"Yun Nan Flavor Garden's dumplings with rice noodles in hot and sour sauce is possibly one of the best things I've eaten in my life--the dumplings are tender and springy on the outside and fatty, porky, and juicy on the inside. The vinegary broth is flecked with roasted chili bits and chili oil pools around scallions and cilantro leaves and stems. Get the noodles too for added carby happiness. The price has recently increased (by 50 cents) and the portion size has decreased (not really a bad thing because you will continue to eat these dumplings until they are gone, way past the point of being full), but at $5.75 it's still a pretty good deal. Also delicious is the Crossing the Bridge Soup, the raw ingredients--meat, tofu skins, quail egg, scallions, cilantro--mixed at your table into a rich hot chicken broth, noodles added just after. At around $10, this is the most expensive item on the menu.I love to order the cold noodles in summer--crispy ground meat on top of rice noodles with cilantro, coriander seeds, peanuts, and a salty, vinegary sauce you mix in with the noodles. And try the cucumbers. I've taken professed cucumber-haters here and they have raved about this salad. Expect to share a table with others, and be prepared to wait a while for your food if the restaurant is busy. Oh, and cash only. It's all worth it! If only they delivered.",5.0
"unique noodle soup spot that you don't see anywhere else.Love their specialties, like cross-bridge series and the spicy noodle soups.Too bad it's bad away from where I live now or else I would go there once a week.There, don't expect a fancy decor or attentive services, it's like a local spot you would see in China.  All they care is providing you yummy food and go about your days.Would recommend you.",4.0
"My siblings and I love this place! I would crave it once in a while, but I would usually only get it when I'm around the area. I have only tried their #11 Rice Noodles with Crispy Meat Sauce and #37 Dumplings with Hot & Sour Sauce (which are really wontons). I like how you can choose the level of spiciness for your noodles so you can adjust to your tolerance. I usually get it less spicy, but it didn't taste spicy at all (in my opinion) so I think I will go a level up next time. #11 comes with rice noodles, sliced pig intestine, and crispy meat which is basically fried pork skin. The noodles are nice and chewy which is a major element that I look for in noodles. I like pork intestines so it was a plus, but people that think it is gross may not enjoy it as much. The crispy meat is more of a crunchy fried pork skin and barely has any meat on it, but its still good. Overall, its a savory and addicting bowl of noodles that is a must try! #37 is basically wontons in hot and sour sauce. I like almost anything that is hot and sour and this this did not disappoint. It was a perfect amount of spicy and sour. Like I said, I come here once in a while so of course I will be returning. Definitely recommend this place for anyone that is looking for cheap and delicious eats.",5.0
Amazing place!! There noodles are great I always order noodles with crispy meat sauce. It's a great place for afternoon lunch or quick dinner. The service is also great. I've been to the store so many times I can't even count. I also think this store is for everyone I saw a lot of good views online and I think it's one of he great restaurants in 8th ave,5.0
"Bookmarked this place and finally gotto try it this wkend. My sis intro me to the Crossing Bridge noodle soup (we got w/beef only) and it was so good! Especially yday was a very cold day so this definitely warmed us up!!! We also tried to wontons w clear soup and it was the tastiest wontons i've ever had anywhere.They only accept cash, and customer service was only moderate. It does get busy especially Sundays. Definitely a good spot if ure craving noodle soups and even if ure hung over",5.0
"Go get the Crossing the Bridge Noodle Soup!!!It should be the main reason you should come here. This noodle soup is the BIGGEST bowl of noodles you will ever have. Yes I can guarantee it unless you can prove me wrong. When you order it, you can get the plain, fillets, or beef/lamb. We ordered the fillet, which was chicken and fish fillets. The ingredients comes out separately. First came out the fillets and the plate of egg, bean spouts, scallions, and tofu skin. Next came out the already cooked noodles. Final part is the boiling hot bowl of chicken stock soup with the chicken.The staff will make the dish for you in front of you. First the egg goes in first. Second the fillets go in. Third the bean spouts, tofu skin, and scallions. Finally the bowl of noodles and chicken. All that makes one huge bowl of noodle soup. It's almost like hot pot because they put all the ingredients into a hot bowl of soup stock and let all the ingredients cook.The soup itself is very tasty. The noodles, which are a little thick, soaks up the flavor of the soup nicely. This is the type of noodle soup where it isn't a fatty dish to have. Great noodle soup!!Another dish we got was the hot and sour dumpling soup. Definitely hot. Had a little bit of a sour taste. There was some spiciness in it. I like the scallions and cilantro which gives it more depth and taste. The dumplings itself was very good. Definitely think the restaurant makes it themselves. I like this dish.Overall this is a great place to try especially when it is cold outside. The noodles are a must try. Definitely better than a bowl of pho.",4.0
"Woots! Crossing Bridge Rice Noodles! Rice noodle soups are their greatest strength here!  This is a real hidden gem in Brooklyn and what makes it so special. This is most definitely worth the travels for it. No Chinese necessary. All you need to do is point! Crossing Bridge Noodle is a presentation of a different way to eat your noodles. This is what they are famous for. The idea here is that the servers present you this dish with the fresh ingredients like rice noodles, pork, fish, tofu skin, chives, bean sprouts, and a huge bowl of very hot broth. The server will actually put each ingredient into the hot broth to cook it right in front of you. I would describe this as to where hot pot and pho cross. Hot Pot being putting fresh ingredients into cooking and pho being its a bowl of rice noodle soup topped with fresh ingredients still being cooked. The broth is chicken based and it tastes home made and really good! It is the type of broth where you put the entire chicken into the hot boiling water for hours to produce. Crispy Pork Rice Noodle Soup was perhaps my favorite rice noodle soup here. Generous amount of marinated pig intestines and pork meat make up the salty broth which I found so flavorful and so amazing!  The silky rice noodles itself is a bit of a difficulty because it is so slippery, so don't be shy and ask for a fork! Eat with confidence! A-Rating (Not that matters to me anyway!) as of 07/05/2015!",4.0
"Despite its good reviews, it was very quiet when I came here on a Saturday night. I've tried it once a couple of years ago and it was nothing special. However, this time I had dried noodles ($5.50) and it is to die for. Never had anything like that before in all my years of experience with Chinese food. If your unsure of what to get, get that!!! I will definitely be back for more:",4.0
"saw such great reviews so we stopped in for dinner recently and to begin, service is horrible. there were just 2 girls working the cashier for take out and walking thru to take orders. we were never served drinks, or maybe they just dont do that. their menu has english but u basically cant ask questions because neither of them were able to understand. we tried the cold noodles as the pics showed because i felt it was one of those obligatory things here that are must try, but wouldnt taste good - but it was surprisingly good because the flavors weren't what i had expected. the only thing is i wish i knew what kind of minced meat i was consuming. we also tried beef nom with hand pulled noodles - which were absolutely tasteless. from the broth to the beef nom, no taste at all. the restaurant is also quite odd - nothing is in the fish tank but newspapers, the walls have shelves with nothing on it.",3.0
Omg I love the sweet and sour dumplings. I remember when I was in after school in 8th ave and I went to their older location for those delicious dumplings. Prices have gone up since then and the space is a lot bigger now but the food is still delicious. My friend from california loved it as well!,5.0
"This is their Signature dish "" crossing bridge noodle soup "" , it consist of chicken , raw pork meat, sprouts beans , raw egg and scallion. Served with noodle.

Yay!I wanted to see how their dumplings actually taste like so I went for their Dumplings in Clear Soup instead of the Dumpling with Hot and Sour Sauce this time. The pork filling in the delicate dumpling skin was so amazing--plumped, juicy, flavorful, oh so tender.Instead of the Crossing Bridge Noodles, I went for the noodles thinking that they were smaller in portions, think again! The bowls were almost as big as the Crossing Bridge, still something that needs to be shared! The smell of the fried pork fat in the Rice Noodle with Crispy Meat Sauce was so savory, the tender pieces of pork intestine was chewy, and fatty, in a good way. The plate of the Mixed Lu Mien was scrumptious, a must have at the table.Coming back again and again for more, especially for their dumplings!",4.0
"They use to be in a tiny store front and expanded to a pretty decent size restaurant, which is a lot better. It's so much more enjoyable, cleaner, and spacious. It's great that the prices remain low. It's around $5 for a bowl of noodles, makes a cheap lunch or dinner. It's hard to find good noodle soup and this place does it right. Broth is great and the meats are flavorful and tender. Get the rice noodle version one. It's my favorite type of noodle with the meat of your choice. They even have the dry rice noodle, which I thought was okay. For some reason it was a little too sweet for me. And their dumplings in hot and sour sauce was a little too sour for me. It really depends on an individual taste bud. But, I'll stick to their rice noodle soup. If you like spicy noodle soup they make some of the best spicy noodle soup in the area.",4.0
"This is one of my favorite places to eat whenever I crave for spicy noodles. It's a small place located on 8th ave with extremely affordable prices.

My all time favorites are:Crossing Bridge noodle soup: Served in a very large bowl (enough for 2) Light broth, comes w/ black chicken, quail eggs, sliced pork & side of bean sprouts. Rice stick noodle with spicy meat sauce: I usually do this as a dry noodle. W/ the soup on the side because mixing the noodles and meat together is still very flavorful. Wonton in hot & sour soup is definitely worth trying. I believe it's about 10 dumplings in an order. It's spicy, sour, & filling.

"Yunnan is a southwestern Chinese province bordering of Myanmar, Laos, and Vietnam, and they specialize in wonderfully chewy, white rice noodles served in large bowls of rich broth with cilantro and fiery hot sauce.Having been a devout customer at their original location on 49th St. for years, I am happy to see that their business expanded but their noodle soup are as tasty as ever. In fact, the same chef/owner is running the kitchen, and this is all for the best: a larger space means more chances to sit down to savor their wonderful dishes.Most cold appetizers are around $3. The cold sliced cucumber salad was an excellent (and refreshing!) way to start our meal.Our first choice for noodle soup was a new item on their menu: Crossing the Bridge rice noodles ($8.75). This is described as ""the most famous dish of Yunnan"". Ingredients are delivered to the table raw, and then added to the bowl with piping hot light bone broth directly at your table. They include tofu skin, bean sprouts, Chinese chive, sliced chicken, large pieces of squab, a quail egg and, of course, the silky white noodles. The overall flavor of the broth is delicate, and you may want to season it with chili oil (and perhaps some vinegar too). Be advised that the bowl is the size of a kitchen sink...Next, we had the noodle with crispy meat sauce ($5.50). Flour noodles were served with round slices of crispy pig intestine and pork meat. This was a deliciously satisfying noodle soup: the noodles were firm and chewy, the broth rich an tasty, the meat wonderfully crunchy on the outside and very tender on the inside. I absolutely loved this dish.I'm also happy to see they still serve on of my favorite dishes: House-made cold rice noodles with ground pork, roasted peanuts chili oil, vinegar and soy sauce ($5.50). The dumplings with hot and sour sauce are also another great choice ($5.25).-----------------Side note about service:If I could give them an extra star for service  and bring their rating to 6 stars, I would: during my visit there a very annoying customer insisted that she did not want to pay for the dish she ordered because she thought it was a different dish.Yep: the dish she got was the one she ordered, and she wanted it for free.

"I had their special ""crossing bridge"" noodles and hot and sour dumpling soup. Awesome broth! Their homemade noodles are perfectly cooked. There was such a big contrast of flavor between the crossing bridge noodle broth and the hot and sour, making it the perfect combination to eat together. Noodle broth tasted very clear of any artificial ingredients. If you are a spicy food lover, definitely try adding their vinegar and hot chili oil. It's just amazing! Personally, found the hot and sour broth to be too much on the sour side. A bit overwhelming to chug down like soup. Dumplings were perfect.You know the food is good when it tastes homemade, and leaves you warm after the meal. I don't think they used any MSG neither because I didn't have that insatiable wave of thirst you typically get afterwards.Don't be confused like me and sit there for the waitress to serve you water or hand over the bill because that's more of a self serve. Go up to the front, super casual restaurant.",5.0

Never judge a book by its cover for sure.  You walk into this restaurant and it looks either run down or a place that's being closed. You seat yourself where ever there is an open seat.  I was brought here cause their spicy dumplings and their beef stew noodles were recommended. And I have to say for sure that both dishes did not disappoint.  There's a lot of flavor and if you love spicy yep the dumpling are on point.  If you're freezing this place will warm up your tummy and you'll leave happy,4.0

"Crossing the bridge to get some Cross Bridge Noodles. Funny? No? Okay.But seriously though, do come from other boroughs to try this authentic dish that this restaurant has perfected. I ordered the 3rd type of CBN [shortened for cross bridge noodles because who wants to type that out?]. It came with thinly slices of beef and lamb, bean curd, a quail egg, chopped parsley and scallion. Another bowl of rice noodles [lai fun] was separated in another bowl and brought out with the soup. The waiter will come and help you prepare all these items. When he/she is done you will want to start slurping, but don't! The soup is really hot, so hot that it will be able to cook your meat and your tongue if you're not careful. I slowly enjoyed my soup and noodles and I must give compliments to the chef because this is not my favorite type of noodle, but it does not disappoint. Personally I like chewier noodles but the broth from this place along with the other ingredients defiantly make up for it. These noodles are round and made from rice and they are sort of stiff and smooth. It had a sort of flat texture, kinda like gnocci except in long thin rice noodle form.I stupidly added too much hot oil to my soup and ended up sweating bullets. But don't worry you can get yourself some chinese soft drinks to wash it all down. I got myself some herbal tea.",4.0

"I've been a little disappointed by the Chinese food in Brooklyn's Chinatown so far. One exception has been Yun Nan Flavor Garden, which stands out in my mind for serving delicious, interesting dishes at a downright confusing price point (as in, ""damn I hope you own this space and aren't paying rent because how are you making any profit"").We ordered:- Crossing the bridge noodlesTheir most talked-about dish, and for good reason. A huge bowl of boiling hot broth is brought to your table with several plastic-wrapped plates of raw ingredients: shabu-sliced chicken, tofu skin, bean sprouts, greens, a cracked egg, cooked black chicken (silkie! so cute but so delicious, aw) pieces, plus a heap of cooked noodles. This famous Yun Nan dish is so named because each item is transferred ceremonially to the broth using chopsticks by the chef, still wearing her bright red apron. When she finishes, what you have is a wildly flavorful (from the silkie, well-known to create amazing broths) noodle soup that can easily feed 2.- Cold noodlesTheir signature dish. It's unlike any cold noodle/liang fen/liang pi I've ever had, despite the similar flavor profiles (garlic, soy, vinegar, chili, cilantro). And it's relentlessly slurpable: Just like the crossing the bridge noodles, the rice noodle used here is perfectly round, springy, and slippery rather than chewy. Not optimal for coating with sauce, but good for how clean this dish tastes, even with ground meat and a spoonful of chili oil on top. (Looks deceive: It's not very spicy.)- Dumplings with hot and sour sauceThis is the one that really impressed me! Anticipating that the above items wouldn't be enough for two hungry people (despite the timid warnings of our server), we expected just a side of dumplings with generic hot and sour soup. No sirree! We knew it was trouble when it [was] walked in - a huge bowl of fat wontons with puckered skin, soaking in a hot bath of tart vinegar, chili oil, Szechuan peppercorn, and overall magic. This turned out to be one of the most delicious treatments of wontons I have ever experienced.The tables are mostly large round banquet tables, which is odd if you're two people and haven't managed to snag one of the only two 4-seaters. As a result, the place felt empty, even though most tables surprisingly had some people at them for what an awkward time of day it was (3pm on a Sunday in October). The bathroom isn't the cleanest, the tiles on the floor are a little chipped, and there's a chandelier almost shrinking back into the ceiling... I know Yun Nan Flavor Snack (yelp.com/biz/yun-nan-fla…) expanded into this larger space very recently, but it's still nothing gorgeous to look at. Concentrate on the great food instead.",5.0

Then I'd chug a bottle of soy milk right after.",5.0
"Crossing the bridge to get some Cross Bridge Noodles. Funny? No? Okay.But seriously though, do come from other boroughs to try this authentic dish that this restaurant has perfected. I ordered the 3rd type of CBN [shortened for cross bridge noodles because who wants to type that out?]. It came with thinly slices of beef and lamb, bean curd, a quail egg, chopped parsley and scallion. Another bowl of rice noodles [lai fun] was separated in another bowl and brought out with the soup. The waiter will come and help you prepare all these items. When he/she is done you will want to start slurping, but don't! The soup is really hot, so hot that it will be able to cook your meat and your tongue if you're not careful. I slowly enjoyed my soup and noodles and I must give compliments to the chef because this is not my favorite type of noodle, but it does not disappoint. Personally I like chewier noodles but the broth from this place along with the other ingredients defiantly make up for it. These noodles are round and made from rice and they are sort of stiff and smooth. It had a sort of flat texture, kinda like gnocci except in long thin rice noodle form.I stupidly added too much hot oil to my soup and ended up sweating bullets. But don't worry you can get yourself some chinese soft drinks to wash it all down. I got myself some herbal tea.",4.0
"DEFINITELY RECOMMEND! I, as a Chinese native, must say that this is one of the best Yun Nan rice noodles I've ever had. The soup is absolutely hearty and rich in flavor. I brought my American friend with me and he LOVED every bite of it, especially the hot and sour dumplings. A must must must. Even the neighborhood is quite lovely and authentically Chinese.",5.0
"3.5 stars. On a steamy, sultry summer day when cooking is the last thing on your mind, you can't go wrong by getting the cold noodle and the cold spicy cucumbers here. The noodles are slurpylicious and mix well with the spicy meat sauce with peanuts and cilantro. Add an order of dumplings from Wong Wong Noodles nearby and 2 people can eat like kings for under $15.",3.0
This is my Flavor food in  ny city the noodles taste is so staff if you epicure you need to come here to try soup so delicious yummy!!,5.0
"I've been a little disappointed by the Chinese food in Brooklyn's Chinatown so far. One exception has been Yun Nan Flavor Garden, which stands out in my mind for serving delicious, interesting dishes at a downright confusing price point (as in, ""damn I hope you own this space and aren't paying rent because how are you making any profit"").We ordered:- Crossing the bridge noodlesTheir most talked-about dish, and for good reason. A huge bowl of boiling hot broth is brought to your table with several plastic-wrapped plates of raw ingredients: shabu-sliced chicken, tofu skin, bean sprouts, greens, a cracked egg, cooked black chicken (silkie! so cute but so delicious, aw) pieces, plus a heap of cooked noodles. This famous Yun Nan dish is so named because each item is transferred ceremonially to the broth using chopsticks by the chef, still wearing her bright red apron. When she finishes, what you have is a wildly flavorful (from the silkie, well-known to create amazing broths) noodle soup that can easily feed 2.- Cold noodlesTheir signature dish. It's unlike any cold noodle/liang fen/liang pi I've ever had, despite the similar flavor profiles (garlic, soy, vinegar, chili, cilantro). And it's relentlessly slurpable: Just like the crossing the bridge noodles, the rice noodle used here is perfectly round, springy, and slippery rather than chewy. Not optimal for coating with sauce, but good for how clean this dish tastes, even with ground meat and a spoonful of chili oil on top. (Looks deceive: It's not very spicy.)- Dumplings with hot and sour sauceThis is the one that really impressed me! Anticipating that the above items wouldn't be enough for two hungry people (despite the timid warnings of our server), we expected just a side of dumplings with generic hot and sour soup. No sirree! We knew it was trouble when it [was] walked in - a huge bowl of fat wontons with puckered skin, soaking in a hot bath of tart vinegar, chili oil, Szechuan peppercorn, and overall magic. This turned out to be one of the most delicious treatments of wontons I have ever experienced.The tables are mostly large round banquet tables, which is odd if you're two people and haven't managed to snag one of the only two 4-seaters. As a result, the place felt empty, even though most tables surprisingly had some people at them for what an awkward time of day it was (3pm on a Sunday in October). The bathroom isn't the cleanest, the tiles on the floor are a little chipped, and there's a chandelier almost shrinking back into the ceiling... I know Yun Nan Flavor Snack (yelp.com/biz/yun-nan-fla…) expanded into this larger space very recently, but it's still nothing gorgeous to look at. Concentrate on the great food instead.",5.0
Their #11 Rice Noodles with Crispy Meat Sauce and Hot and Sour Wontons are a must try.,4.0
"Ordered the crossing the bridge noodle soup and was pleasantly surprised! This broth had a very strong and peppery flavor without being too salty. The broth, meat, veggies, and noodles come in separate bowls, then you put everything in the broth! Huge bowl and great taste!",4.0
"This place is... interesting. If you order the crossing the bridge noodles, they bring you uncooked slices of meat and a raw egg on a plate. Then 10 minutes later, a guy with heat protection gloves brings out gigantic bowls of steaming hot broth. Then the wait staff mixes it all up for you. Is it sanitary? Who knows. But it's a crap-ton of food. The bowls are gigantic. It's basically like doing hot pot but with noodles. An interesting experience, to be sure. Worth going to, but probably not more than once.",3.0
"Today I walk in to order my noodle soup like usual. I always get the number 11 spicy. I tell the guy at the counter that I want number ""sup yut"" (cantonese for 11) then pay and wait. I walk to the bathroom while the food is being prepared and realized that a table had left with 2 full bowls of noodles on the table. I ignore it and continue toward the back to use their bathroom. After coming back out and waiting a little longer i decide to go across the street to get some malaysian food for my sister. When I came back I saw 2 orders on the counter and asked which one is the my order for number 11 (in English). This time the girl was in the front. She looked at the 2 bags and probably recognizes me and asked big spicy right? Yes. She gave me the order and I took it home. The order i got has no soup! Just noodles and spicy meat on top. I was furious and called the restaurant. I ask why did my order of number 11 come with no soup. I asked in English and she said can you speak chinese or mandarin. I spoke to her in broken mandarin this time and she said you ordered number 18, of course there is no soup! WTF?!!?! I said NO! How can you possible hear 18 when I say 11. I don't' even know what number 18 was. The guy in the back ground said yea she ordered 18. That was the last straw. I just hung up the phone and decide to look up their menu. Number 18 is the same ingredients with no soup. The guy put in the wrong order and decided he didn't want to take blame for it. The girl doesn't understand English decides to not take the blame either. If they had apologized, I would've said forget it and just be careful next time. This is outrageous for them to blame the customer! I placed my order in Cantonese (which sounds nothing like 18) and then again in English when I picked it up. This is the reason why this place is never full and people leave behind their food.When the Yun Nan lady was by herself in her hole in the wall, everything was fantastic and people will wait half an hour for their food. These young people are nasty and ruins the whole experience. They need to learn their NUMBERS in English and Chinese!  I won't be surprised if this place shuts down in half a year.",1.0
"This restaurant is the embodiment of several stories, the most prominent being the American Dream of an immigrant coming here with nothing but the clothes on his back and some skills in the kitchen in an attempt to find opportunities for his family.The second is the perpetual conveyance of a long lost culture through food and custom....I came here with a group of friends to try out some dishes, out of curiosity from a co-worker's recommendation, and yes I was surely impressed.We ordered several dishes as listed below:#40 - Hot and sour dumplings on top of noodles.  Wonderful pork wontons served on top of noodles in pork based vinegar and spiced broth.  The sour and spice was perfectly balanced with the salty savory wonton meat.  Let the noodles sit at the bottom of the bowl to absorb the broth's and you will have tasted the courage of an immigrant braving a new world with his passion for culinary arts.#11 - Noodles with crispy meat sauce.  This is the biggest mystery of all.  HOW DID THE CRISPY PORK SKIN STAY SO CRISPY?!!!  It's a very simple dish of pork based broth, noodles, braised thinly sliced pig intestines, and crispy fried pork skin (cracklin).  The attraction isn't the flavour as it is salty and savory.  The attraction is the conflict of crunchy cracklin texture with the smooth liquid broth noodles and chewy intestines.  Seriously, leave your religious and dietary beliefs at the door and try this dish, no one in Borough Park will judge you.#1 - Crossing the Bridge Noodles.  A little back story -===============================================================A long time ago in the province of Yunnan, a scholar was studying for exams on a small island to become a government official.  His wife was trying to help out by bringing him some food, however it was a long way from their house to the island, and the soup would turn cold by the time she had crossed the bridge.  She finally had an idea... or maybe it was his idea... but the idea was to use an earthen clay pot, layer the top of the broth with fat, and separate the other ingredients from the soup until serving time.  When she finally crossed the bridge to her husband, the soup was still piping hot, hot enough to cook the ingredients she had brought over in a separate container, and provided a fresh taste to the dish.===============================================================So back to the dish at the restaurant, it came with a few things, first the noodles came out, then sliced ham and black chicken pieces, then some bean sprouts and a quail egg.  After about 10 minutes, the owner comes out with the soup, and personally sets it infront of you.  DO NOT TOUCH THE BOWL OF SOUP, YOU WILL BURN YOURSELF.  Then one of the waiters will start placing the ingredients into the super hot broth allowing for time to cook.  Does anyone else see the correlation of the story to the service in the restaurant?Now do yourself a favour, get over to Yunnan Flavour Garden and eat some noodles",5.0
"Hot and Sour dumplings are amazing and the seaweed salad is great as well. I would skip their famous Over the Bridge.

"This is such a big upgrade to the previous location they had. There are actual tables and seats. The menu has increased. I tried the traditional crossing the bridge rice noodles, rice noodle with crispy meat sauce, hot and sour dumplings, dumpling with clear soup, and pickled cucumbers. Everything was delicious! The traditional crossing the bridge rice noodle soup base was heavy with black and white pepper. Plus it's very filling! The hot and sour dumplings is the same as I remember from the previous location. The meat in the dumpling is flavorful and the skin is thin enough to hold everything together without breaking. The sauce/soup is flavorful too. The rice noodle with crispy meat sauce is delicious! I like how there are different types of meat, some boiled and some fried. The meats compliment the noodles very well! I greatly enjoy the soup base too! It's very flavorful! The dumpling with clear soup is dumplings with I think their homemade chicken broth. This is a good dish for kids. The pickled cucumbers compliment the meal very well overall since practically everything is hot and high in flavor. It's very refreshing.Compared to the first location, I think the portions got bigger. They used to serve their food in containers. But now the foods are served in bowls and plates.",5.0

"I have had a clipping, raving about this restaurant, on my kitchen cabinet door for YEARS, and I finally got around to making the trek to Sunset Park in Brooklyn, where there is a very substantial Chinese neighborhood and Chinatown row of restaurants.  I've come to this area before for Chinese food and, in general, it kicks Manhattan Chinatown butt, as does the other Chinatown in Flushing (It just occurred to me that NYC is so large that it has Chinatowns in three out of five of its boroughs!  Most cities are happy to have just one!) but this time around, I am sad to report that my expectations were let down.  It was just not that great of a place.  First of all, it's a dirty, ugly, plain as planks, warthole of a place, with a ""C"" rating emblazoned in the window.   We paused at the site of that, but we've seen other, crowded Chinese restaurants similarly marked by the City Department of Health and Hygiene.  It must be all the duck carcasses in the window, we have always thought, but no doubt it's about vermin and sanitation too.  Still, I am a food adventurist and sometimes you gotta roll with the punches if you want to be delighted.So we sauntered in and were shown to an empty, 8 person table.   The place was deserted, which I thought was little off, but I figured that had to do with the fact that it was 3 PM on a Sunday.  After awhile, a young man came out and took our orders, explaining what everything was very gregariously and patiently.   I chose to have the Rice Noodle Soup with Beef (at  his recommendation) and Kim selected the Hot and Sour dumpling soup.  As an appetizer, we chose the Pickled Cucumber Salad.  We also ordered up a couple of kid's ""Milk Drinks"", which our waiter said were delicious and worth a try.The cucumber ""salad"" came out quickly, and I could see why, it was a fresh, not pickled, cucumber that someone chopped up in the kitchen moments before and doused with soy sauce.  That was it.  No joke.  It took a fairly long time for the rest of food to arrive and while we waited and picked at our cucumber chunks, we examined our surroundings.  It really couldn't be more plain.  Spoons and forks in a plastic soup container on the table, another container for chopsticks, truck stop style paper napkin dispenser, a complete absence of tableclothes or even paper place-mats, empty shelves, dusty trophies, dirty floor, flickering flourescents.  Not great.Eventually the food arrived.   Large white bowls brimming with noodles and broth, plus herbs and seasonings and dollops of meat in my case, or dumplings, in Kim's case.  We grabbed some chopsticks and spoons and began to tuck into our soups.Mine was completely, and I mean completely, unspectacular.  I wonder if the noodles were even rice noodles.  They seemed more like egg noodles to me.  The broth had some nuance but nothing like some other Noodle soups I have enjoyed in my travels.  The noodles were flavorless and thick, unappealing.  The beef, of which there were precious few bits, was tough and also fairly flat in flavorings.  I resorted to dousing my soup with chili oil, to give it some more presence.  That worked to a degree but I shouldn't have had to do that.Kim's was much better - a more complex broth with a little kick to it, surrounding a solid portion of delicate dumplings containing sumptuous pork filling.   It was rich and good but again, not some holy grail of soupdom at all.  It was basically above average cheap eats.  The Milk Drink, which was in reality Borden's Condensed Milk watered down and repackaged, was a tasty antidote to the bland broth in my case, and the kick from Kim's dish.  I think I might have enjoyed the beverage most of all.We didn't finish our soups but did take Kim's home for someone's lunch later in the week.  We paid, we took a menu, but I don't think I'll be back anytime soon.  So disappointed.  I so wanted this to be great.",3.0

"Best Yun Nan flavor I've tried in US, nothing less than 一坐一忘 in Beijing. 卤味拼盘 was cool, especially the pig's trotters and ears, just like savoring mom's cooking at home. Crossing the bridge noodles is the most famous cuisine ever in Yun Nan, and this restaurant provides you the genuine process of making it. They provided you the fish/noodles/veges, and after a pretty long while came the soup - then mixed them. Loved the fish, so tender and the soup was a bonus point. I ended with finishing all the soup, lol. If I would point out some drawbacks, it would be they don't serve all the things on the menu, and there were pretty a lot of them.",5.0
It's an extension of their Yun Nan Flavour Snack location a few blocks away. This offers the same items plus a few more spicy dishes including pig ear Lo mein.  Try their signature dish (IMO) which is their cold rice noodle with extra spicy sauce which won't disappoint. Make sure to eat it right away for take out since the noodles will soak up all the broth and it won't taste as chewy :)Once I try the other items I will be sure to update this review.   I've been doing mostly take out.,4.0
"My friend says ""the service is subpar, we waited five minutes for service before getting our own menu and sat ourselves in an empty restaurant. Somehow they make it feel understaffed even though there were three customers.

"Best Yun Nan flavor I've tried in US, nothing less than 一坐一忘 in Beijing. 卤味拼盘 was cool, especially the pig's trotters and ears, just like savoring mom's cooking at home. Crossing the bridge noodles is the most famous cuisine ever in Yun Nan, and this restaurant provides you the genuine process of making it. They provided you the fish/noodles/veges, and after a pretty long while came the soup - then mixed them. Loved the fish, so tender and the soup was a bonus point. I ended with finishing all the soup, lol. If I would point out some drawbacks, it would be they don't serve all the things on the menu, and there were pretty a lot of them.",5.0
It's an extension of their Yun Nan Flavour Snack location a few blocks away. This offers the same items plus a few more spicy dishes including pig ear Lo mein.  Try their signature dish (IMO) which is their cold rice noodle with extra spicy sauce which won't disappoint. Make sure to eat it right away for take out since the noodles will soak up all the broth and it won't taste as chewy :)Once I try the other items I will be sure to update this review.   I've been doing mostly take out.,4.0

"I'm originally from Kunming, Yunnan. I've been eating my hometown favorite rice noodles since this place opened in Brooklyn several years ago . In recent a few months I went to the old location several times but found the door was closed until one day I saw the sign of a different restaurant that totally freaked me out. Didn't pay enough attention when I drove back along the 8th Avenue, sadly thinking this place closed down. Luckily a friend asked me to go to the 8th Avenue to have dinner tonight and he told me to YELP some good restaurants. In a few minutes I saw that my old favorite restaurant moved down 2 blocks away, to a larger and the new location how thrilled I was! I took my friends there for dinner and we all love the food. We ordered three types of rice noodles including the most well-known YUNNAN food crossing the bridge rice noodles. I said hi to the owner couple in the kitchen they were happy to see me back again. Everything is as tasty as usual. See they even have some cold dish items. The owner told me they would be more hot items to come in future. My friend was so impressed with the quality and the price of their food. I've been living in New York City for the past 11 years and this is the second authentic Yunnan restaurant I have found- the first while I was in Flushing which close down about 9 years ago. Nothing can comfort a nostalgic soul than eating your favorite childhood food in a restaurant more than 10000  miles away from your hometown. I'm definitely bringing more guests back over and over again. I sincerely wish their expansion would make the business prosperous and stay as an iconic restaurant in the neighborhood.",5.0

Cheap and tasty! I'm a big fan of their dumplings with hot and sour sauce. Now that is a five star item. Everything else are still good but I feel like they are heavy with the MSG. Most of their good is spicy so if you cannot take it ask them to make the soup for the noodle mild.,4.0

In a few minutes I saw that my old favorite restaurant moved down 2 blocks away, to a larger and the new location how thrilled I was! I took my friends there for dinner and we all love the food. We ordered three types of rice noodles including the most well-known YUNNAN food crossing the bridge rice noodles. I said hi to the owner couple in the kitchen they were happy to see me back again. Everything is as tasty as usual. See they even have some cold dish items. The owner told me they would be more hot items to come in future. My friend was so impressed with the quality and the price of their food. I've been living in New York City for the past 11 years and this is the second authentic Yunnan restaurant I have found- the first while I was in Flushing which close down about 9 years ago. Nothing can comfort a nostalgic soul than eating your favorite childhood food in a restaurant more than 10000  miles away from your hometown. I'm definitely bringing more guests back over and over again. I sincerely wish their expansion would make the business prosperous and stay as an iconic restaurant in the neighborhood.",5.0
Very interesting dishes and BYOB.,4.0
Cheap and tasty! I'm a big fan of their dumplings with hot and sour sauce. Now that is a five star item. Everything else are still good but I feel like they are heavy with the MSG. Most of their good is spicy so if you cannot take it ask them to make the soup for the noodle mild.,4.0
