"This place is so awesome. From the decor and cleanliness to the menu and quality of food. I had the grilled chicken breast dijonaisse sandwich, and it was so good I ordered a SECOND SANDWICH, but this time it was the Roast Beef Aioli with pickled beets and horseradish. Another kick ass sandwich. It's like a work of art, I tell you. The only thing that sucked a little was the invasion of baby carriages around 11am (on a Tuesday). There are almost 10 tables in the place (singles can sit at a counter up by the front window) and there were 5 babies in there at one point. Madness. I'd totally go back, though.",5.0
"One dish that tops them all, their tater tots! Okay, maybe you shouldn't just eat tater tots as a meal, but if you so decide to or decide to get them as a side, they're definitely a treat. They are a crisp and garlic-y perfection.Aside from the delicious tater tots, their menu is generally healthy, home-y food. I've gotten their steel cut oats and eggs with kale/quinoa - these dishes definitely have more subtle flavours but I enjoyed them and leave Stocked feeling good and not regretting what I've eaten.",4.0
"Shockingly GoodOh that Roasted Pork sandwich!!!!  This is a very small 10 seater narrow eatery serving all scratch made, locally sourced food items (mainly sandwiches).This is simple review where we ordered one amazing item.  The Capicola Roast Pork.  A crafted sandwich on a wonderful crusted fresh artisan ciabatta roll with sharp provolone and broccoli rabe.  Absolutely delicious.  Now the place does make other great sandwiches, but this is the one to order.  One drawback is the sandwich is a bit small and will run you about 13 bucks, but it's worth it.  Next time I visit Brooklyn, I'm going back.  So good.  Thanks",4.0
"Great community cafe restaurant owned by a wonderful family who has generously opened their doors to everyone-mommies, students, professionals. Food is awesome! Coffee delicious. Service wonderful. It's the perfect morning afternoon spot to relax or work:) Fir the vegetarians reading this-I love the veggie burger (get it on a roll) and the scones. The eggplant sandwich rocks. Enjoy!",5.0
"Super slow sandwich shop, but typically tasty which you'd expect for $12+ sandwiches. Today was an off day though, the grill guy was so fried he was missing orders and when I eventually got my sandwich the chicken was not just overdone, but charred black. Didn't realize til I was back at work. Unfortunate as it is one of the better lunch spots in this area...guess I'll start making the trek back down to ChickP and Bklyn Larder.",2.0
"The pork sammie with provolone is out of sight! I wanted to try the other sandwiches as well as a couple of salads. Great menu! The atmosphere is kind of like a coffee café, with a funky kick to it.",5.0
I had a kale salad that was amazing!!  We also tried the ham and swiss sandwich. Just a heads up the dijon mustard has a serious kick. I'm not into spicy food so it had me crying.,4.0
"Tony and I took a Zip car to Home Depot this weekend and got to explore areas of Brooklyn we don't get to very often. So, when it was time for lunch, we pulled out Yelp! and saw that Stocked had some good reviews. The rest of the story appears below...People on Yelp! have raved over the Stocked Capicola pork sandwich, which I ordered... and, sure, it was OKAY. However, it did not change my life. In fact, it was super oily and bland-ish. I wish I had thought to add deli mustard to the sandwich because it seriously needed some flavor help. Tony tried the fried chicken sandwich, which featured a fried patty made of ground chicken (like a crab cake but made with chicken instead of crab). He described it as tasty enough but complained of the small portion size.A few other disappointments to note:1) Don't order diet coke is you're thirsty. It's one of those super small 8oz bottles.2) The sandwich prices are expensive for the portion size3) Although the restaurant is cute and modern looking inside, there is this giant kids' toy oven and kitchen set in the main dining area. What an eye sore! Oh, don't get me wrong because I love kids.... but this is the first time I've ever seen something like this in NYC. The best menu item we tried was the Tater Tots. However, these weren't that hot, which was, of course, another disappointment.Overall, I give his place 2 stars because I feel there are probably some good things about this place... and possibly I missed them. Also, the interior is inviting (except the tony kitchen set), and the staff was nice. Unfortunately, the rest just didn't add up for me.",2.0
Dropped by around 5pm to an incredibly loud cafe-like space (including a woman reading to her child at an absurd volume and the staff just ignoring it) to drop $4.63 for a decent polentina soup (small) with piece of bread.,3.0
"I came to Stocked looking for a good, above average sandwich for lunch the other day. Their menu is relatively small, offering a number of classics with a bougey twist, as well as a few vegetarian options including a cauliflower steak sandwich and an eggplant sandwich. I went for the house-made roast turkey w/ bacon aioli, tomato jam, and arugula, on a grilled baguette.Holy. Jeebus. It was AMAZING. I was not expecting, nor prepared to eat one of the best sandwiches of my LIFE. It was a perfect marriage of ingredients; all complimenting one another and none of them out-shining the others. Kind of like the cast of Friends!It's not cheap, but you get what you pay for. The roast turkey was $11 and I'm pretty sure the baguette it came on was at least 12-inches long. If you're small like me, you can save half of it for dinner :)I did some quick reading on Stocked before coming and it looks to be family owned. The service is friendly, casual, and quick. They had some children's toys in the back, so they must be catering to the family crowd. Oh and there's free wifi.In addition to sandwiches, they offer a few salads, a full coffee/espresso menu, and a number of breakfast items including homemade muffins, scones, and sandwiches that I must come back to try ASAP.",5.0

"Stocked is superlative. It is staffed by the nicest of folks* serving the freshest of food. They put the utmost care into their food, and it shows because the sandwiches are excellent.

It is topped with the brightest of broccoli rabe, and the most flavorful of espelette, and the crispiest of provolone (not sure how that happens but it does). The grilled ciabatta seems to be the most excellent of all possible carby vehicles for the flavor combination, and I will brave the coldest of days and the most unreliable of trains for so balanced a bite.They are not the cheapest of sandwiches to be sure, but quality is worth paying for._____________*Although I've enjoyed the healthy and fresh turkey option, and while I appreciate the flavors of the Bacon Reuben (despite disagreeing with its classification as a reuben and my desire for more bacon), those options don't justify the high (for a small to mid-sized sandwich) price tag as easily as the pork.",4.0

The grilled cheese sandwich I ordered  had a very thick and crispy bacon, thought the mustard sauce was a little overpowering.  At our table, the best meal seemed to be  the crispy chicken. sandwich with sriracha sauce. In terms of service, the staff was very friendly but I feel there was a bit of disorganization the day we were there. Like I said, many specials/ staples from the menu were missing in action.

"Something about this places name and look really made me want to hate it.  This wasn't helped much by the fact that one of my first visits coincided with some sort of nightmarish yuppie mommy and me singalong.  Once I relented and tried the food however, I was instantly a fan.  The hype on this site about the capicola style roast pork is fully legitimate, and it ranks among the boroughs best sandwiches.  The pork is cooked in a manner that gives it both a fast and consistency as decadent and delicious as really amazing bacon, with the perfect amount of bitter broccoli raab giving its saltiness the perfect counterbalance.

This is our go to deli in the area. They let us in just as they were closing and were so accommodating. Their roast beef sandwich is something my husband and I crave!,5.0
"I love the food at stocked, and repeatedly come for soups and sandwiches (I have loved every sandwich I've ever ordered) as well as their delicious kale salad. I do find the experience slightly less than pleasant during peak hours, however--there are often a lot of children running around so it's rarely a relaxing experience. The tables by the counter are also often crowded by people waiting to get their food. (I am glad to have a family friendly place in the neighborhood, but I also love a spot where I can sit and read a book, and this isn't it). Their A/C also doesn't seem to work well in the summer and it gets a bit hot inside-- they do have a nice backyard, but again, there are often a lot of children playing outside as well. With all of that said, I think their food is fantastic and I highly recommend giving it a try.",4.0
"Three words: crispy chicken sandwich. Awesome.Loved the sides we got, too, esp. the kale salad. Very healthy. It's worth paying the money for what you get - healthy, fresh, delicious food with a lot of heart. The space is warm and inviting, and very kid friendly.",5.0
"I've only ever had their egg & cheese sandwich and let me tell you--it's great! Four stars, though, because coffee prices are more expensive than Starbucks ($3.50 for an iced coffee? Really?)",4.0
The egg sammy is the bomb.  Legit goodness.,5.0
"Mostly great sandwiches, one big gripe though: the crispy chicken is about 2x too small for the price and had really crappy bread compared to their other stuff. Make it twice as big or charge $6 for it. Otherwise their sandwiches are pretty great",4.0
"Very active place during lunch hours. Lots of strollers. The day I went  they were out of a lot of their main signature dishes. So I had to settle for their specials.  The soup of the day was polenta with sweet Italian sausage. I found it lacked flavor and was a bit watery. The grilled cheese sandwich I ordered  had a very thick and crispy bacon, thought the mustard sauce was a little overpowering.  At our table, the best meal seemed to be  the crispy chicken. sandwich with sriracha sauce. In terms of service, the staff was very friendly but I feel there was a bit of disorganization the day we were there. Like I said, many specials/ staples from the menu were missing in action. I was told  2 items I really wanted weren't available, wayyyyy after I ordered them. Nevertheless, it was a only a first visit and this place seems to have lots of potential.",3.0
"Chicken is so, so good and great for dinner when you're not in the mood to cook.",5.0
"Something about this places name and look really made me want to hate it.  This wasn't helped much by the fact that one of my first visits coincided with some sort of nightmarish yuppie mommy and me singalong.  Once I relented and tried the food however, I was instantly a fan.  The hype on this site about the capicola style roast pork is fully legitimate, and it ranks among the boroughs best sandwiches.  The pork is cooked in a manner that gives it both a fast and consistency as decadent and delicious as really amazing bacon, with the perfect amount of bitter broccoli raab giving its saltiness the perfect counterbalance.

Absolutely live this place. They have great quality food at a fair price. On Thursdays there is a sing along for kids. The space is quite open with a nice outdoor patio space. It is very conducive for small children like the ones we have.  There is even a small play space for kids to keep themselves preoccupied. I think the blueberry muffin and the egg sandwich are the two best things on the menu. Though  you really can't go wrong with anything you order as its always made fresh.,5.0

"What a disappointment. I'm angry I wasted money there. A woman at blue marble recommended it to me when I asked where I could get a sandwich. I ordered the turkey and cheese. It was almost $10 and then I asked about adding avocado since it seemed kinda plain and with not much on it for the price. She charged me an additional $1.50 for the addition, bringing my sandwich to practically $12. And then it was bland as can be. I had to add salt and mustard, and ate it because I was hungry, but I was mad. If you're gonna charge $10 and up for a sandwich, it better be pretty special and at the least could include the avocado and some chips or a pickle. Why do these places think it's ok to charge so much for mediocrity? Because we'll pay it? I am not falling for it next time and sticking to a damn deli.",1.0

"3.5 StarsSandwiches are not difficult to come by on Vanderbilt: from our fine friends at Milk Bar, serving ""classic"" Australian fare, to 606 R&D Food's venture into the world of sandwiches. The sandwiches at 606 R&D Food, however, are not worth your calories or your hard-earned money. No sir.

Think: a hearty lentil soup and a delicious vegetarian sandwich/roast beef sandwich. Be warned, beyond consistently good food, there is only one other constant: children. Of course that's wonderful and to be expected in Prospect Heights but take care, should you walk in there with a hangover on a Sunday morning, for example.In this regard, it is wonderful to find a restaurant that is not in denial about the population of children in this neck of the woods - they offer a children's menu with things that sound delicious and have a little play area in the back with a couple of toys (which can get a little trying at times, when the children decide that banging the block against a series of surfaces is the single-most joyful thing in the world).They also stock roast chickens, mac 'n cheese muffins and similar goodies you can take home for family consumption though,  as far as roast chicken goes, I think we prefer the options at 606 R&D Food.Conclusion: Sometimes you want an honest-to-goodness sandwich, salad, or soup.

"I feel like I should eat here more than once to give it a 5 star review, but I'm pretty confident this place is solid all around.I've been wanting to try the sandwiches here for a while now, so some friends and I called in to get some for take out. 1) The sandwiches are all great. We tried the grilled eggplant, the roast beef, and the pork with broccoli rabe. All were fantastic. So different in textures and flavors, but very enjoyable.2) The staff was extremely friendly. I only got to talk to the woman working the register, but she made my day with how sweet and enjoyable our interaction was. I really want to come here for a sit down meal at some point.A nice place to grab an easy bite with friends or family. The rest of their food looks delicious too, so I plan on coming back again, especially for the roast beef sandwich.",5.0
"Returned for dinner, and tried the Coppa sandwich with broccoli rabe and provolone. I also ordered a side of the macaroni and cheese, served in what almost seems like a muffin profile. I took it home, poured a glass of wine, and dug in. The Coppa was juicy, the brocolli rabe great, and the roll was grilled and lightly oiled. The sandwich was good enough to completely distract me from my wine, and I had no room for the Mac&Cheese after that. Definitely ranks in the top two of my favorite sandwiches in the neighborhood.They also have a nice looking back patio.",4.0

"This quaint and new sandwich shop that just opened up a few blocks away from my place has always intrigued me and i finally got to try their sandwich and soup lately...and it was just heavenly! What everyone has been saying about their roast pork and broccoli rabe sandwich is true - it is an absolute must have! Hot, juicy, and flavorful slices of meat pressed with crunchy greens and provolone in their crispy bread....yum! The surprise for me was their cauliflower almond puree soup - this thick buttery and nutty concoction was just what i needed on a cold wintery afternoon. Their kale chips are really light and healthy as well. All three of these things made for a perfect meal. Not to mention that their service is fast, efficient, and very friendly! I can't wait to come back and try more of their menu!",5.0
"Paid $4 for a thing of regular iced coffee. I asked where the coffee comes from and I was less than satisfied. As a protect-the-world junkie, I was disappointed to find out that I was paying for ridiculously overpriced non-organic, non-fair trade coffee. Why the hell am I stretching 4 dollars to get some Joe? I'm just too lazy to walk a couple blocks further for Starbucks. Regardless of the ridiculous price vs. quality correlation, the place is pretty nice.

"I've been to Stocked 3 times already.  This is not your average sandwich/takeout store.  The chefs here have cooked at some of NYC's best restaurants.  The Sandwiches are a cut above the rest.  I started with the Capicola Pork Sandwich. The Brocolli Rabe is a great crunchy touch with the melted provolone.  The bread was fresh and delicious.  At my next visit I ordered a Bacon, Romaine and Blue Cheese salad. This is not an unusual salad by any means, but the ingrediants were fresh and the salad was not over or under dressed, like I find at most restaurants.  This was a salad I'd like to have with a 14oz  New York Strip Steak.  At the last visit I tried the BLAT.  Bacon, Lettuce, Tomato and Avocado Sandwich, again the ingredients were fresh, the tomatoes ripe and sweet, and the aloli just right.  They pay close attention to the preparation as well as the different breads used on each sandwich, every one is spectacular.  Before I left, I couldn't resist getting a take home order of the Meatballs.  They should put these on a sandwich or serve with pasta.  Some of the best meatballs I've ever had.This is a welcome addition to Vanderbilt Ave.  which already has plenty of so-so restaurants.  This place is a cut above the rest.",5.0
"I have eaten here twice and both meals were great. Between myself and the rest of my family, I have tried most of their sandwiches as well as the kid plates. Everything is excellent. The ingredients are fresh and high quality and everything is well prepared. The smoked bacon BLT is particularly tasty. One nice touch is serving kale chips on the side instead of the usual potato chips etc. The kale chips are nicely made and very good. The outdoor space is small but serene. The interior is well laid out, clean, and simply but attractively designed. Overall a five star sandwich shop (with prices commensurate with its quality, alas).",5.0

"I was about to write my review when I saw Stephanie H's review, and mine was going to be pretty similar.I've been to Stocked three times. I really wanted it to do well and succeed - the concept is great, the location is perfect for this neck of the woods, and it's a local young family (or families?) running it, which means I'd rather support it than a chain.However, it's just disappointing. The first time, I had a coffee and a pastry or muffin or something. That was fine, hard to mess up. The second time, my husband and toddler ate in and it was ok. Nothing mindblowing but fine. I do like that it's kid-friendly and there's a play area for children. The space is really dark in the back, kind of depressing.That time, I had the arugula/peach/prosciutto salad. It was decent enough to order again (see below), my husband had a VERY mayonnaise-y BLT and we got a kids meal for my daughter with a grilled cheese sandwich using extra sharp cheddar cheese. Tip: children don't generally like sharp cheddar cheese. Use mild cheddar or even American. I went back with my daughter to grab a quick lunch before running home for her nap. Prepared food should be pretty fast right? I ordered the arugula salad again, a piece of meatloaf, and an iced coffee. I was told that I couldn't be rung up until the meatloaf was weighed. My salad arrived next to the cash register and then the cashier/counter person rung up FIVE orders ahead of me. And by rung up, I mean getting all these people drinks, pastries, bagging everything up, financial transactions, the whole deal. All while my salad sat there sadly.When he'd finished helping everyone else in the free world, he decided to get my meatloaf. Then had to be reminded of my coffee. Meanwhile, people who came in after us were already leaving. When I asked why he helped everyone else before finishing our order, I was told it was ""easier for [him] to finish all the other orders before getting to mine"". This made no sense whatsoever. I could see helping other people while my salad was being prepared but it sat there, in plain sight, for about 10 minutes while everyone else got served. $25 later ($25??!) we were out of there and on our way. OK, so the saddest part of all: I got home and tucked into my itty bitty $9 salad only to find that it had literally -- LITERALLY -- less than a teaspoon of prosciutto in it. It felt like a bad joke. This place is way too expensive and not nearly dynamic enough to last. Which is sad, because I love local businesses that reflect the neighborhood.

"I want to like Stocked.  I want to find a place to get reasonably priced prepared food in Brooklyn.  I want to find a good place to find a sandwich.I've been there twice now, the first time soon after they opened.  I walked in and found a harried woman at the front counter and a somewhat comically limited selection of foods in the refrigerator case and display case considering their name is, well, ""Stocked.""  I figured they were still getting their stuff together considering they had just opened.  I got a muffin- it was good, but not as good as the price (I don't remember what it was, but even for living in New York it seemed a bit steep).2nd chance: a beautiful day, two of us wanted to get some food for a picnic in Prospect Park.  A turkey sandwich, kale salad, breakfast empanada, and two ice coffees came to 32.00.  Again, not insanely expensive, but enough that the food has to rise well above your average deli.I am sad to say that the sandwich did not.  It was a heap of turkey, disintegrating bread, and a few condiments that just couldn't keep up with the huge amount of protein.  This is forgivable, however.  Maybe the salad would redeem?  But the salad was just...insulting.  The container was half-way full, mostly with wilted leaves, some of which were kale most of which were not.  There were maybe 5 chickpeas (very salty) and two or three small pieces of beet.  That was it.  There was a comically large amount of ranch dressing included which would have drowned the paltry salad 10 times over. I just felt cheated, like they had forgot to put something in the salad.  There are so many good food options in Brooklyn, I wonder how long this place will stay open. It also took a long time to actually get the food- maybe 15 minutes.  That can't really work for a prepared food place.  I'm sorry to say.",2.0

"Delicious roast pork sandwich, which, for some reason, they call homemade capicola. Never the less, the porcine has a nutty/meaty taste, it's moist without being fatty and mildly seasoned. The broccoli rabe has a nice 'green' taste and is crunchy. The provolone is sharp without being overly pungent and the bread (I believe it may be sourdough) has a riight-out-of-the-oven taste and texture, even though it was cool.

Although they did put a little bit too much granola in the yogurt so I would recommend asking for the granola on the side. Nevertheless it was absolutely delicious.  The coffee was freshly brewed and the service was excellent. Definitely a good breakfast stop or anytime of the day stop. Very friendly with families. I saw a lot of young families there.  I will definitely go back there and I recommend this to everyone.,5.0
"Food is great, if a little pricy. Staff is friendly even though they move a little slow. Biggest downside is all the baby strollers that flood this place on the weekend -- feels like you're eating breakfast in a preschool.",3.0
"I have been going here every weekend since I found this place!  I visit my sister in the hood and have been tired of overpriced sandwiches from places that won't even take my Amex!  Stocked is DELICIOUS, reasonably priced, and they take my Amex.  The crispy chicken is AMAZING.  And they even have a little play area for my nephew to play at.  Finally, the staff has always been very courteous.  I always feel welcome and comfortable.  I look forward to eating here ever week.",5.0
"Stocked is a huge coup for the neighborhood. Sensible, delicious, homemade food -- great salads, sandwiches, empanadas, roast chicken. Incredibly friendly and welcoming to families with children. Open play area in the back with play kitchen, chalkboards, books, high chair etc. Gorgeous outside patio/garden. A lovely, casual, no fuss place. Bravo, Stocked, and thanks for coming to Prospect Heights!",5.0
Just got back to my apt and inhaled the pork broccoli rabe sandwich. After the first bite I couldn't resist. SOOO GOOOD!!!!! From the bread to the meat to the veg. Awesome. I'll be back.,5.0
"Stocked is a great option to have for days when you feel like home cooking, but just don't have the time to do it yourself. Menu is a little limited, yet everything is delicious, well prepared, and made with quality ingredients. Try the capicola style roast pork sandwich and you'll understand. It's also easy to keep it healthy too, there's multiple veggie sides sold by weight, and their rotisserie chicken (either the barbeque or the herb) is seriously incredible (beats my own chicken roasted a la T Keller).",5.0
"Massively disappointed.  I had the grilled eggplant which was their lone vegetarian offering.  The hummus tasted like it was from Costco; the feta cheese was barely present; and the eggplant was oily.  The only thing that made the sandwich edible was the scant sliced cucumber and the lone grape tomato plastered to the greasy bread with the aforementioned hummus.  My girlfriend had a bacon rueben, or something, that was even greasier and mostly mustard.  We both left feeling a bit queasy with a cloying taste in our mouths that lingered for an hour or so.  I think I'm going to have nightmares about this place.",1.0
"Just stopped in for a blueberry muffin and I have to say this is the best muffin in the neighborhood. I also recommend the soups, the granola... overall a fantastic cafe.",5.0
"Super-yummy sandwiches and salads made with top-quality ingredients - nothing deli-ish about this place. Everyone who works there is really friendly. My new go-to dinner take-out place. The BLT with avocado was ridiculously good, as was the roasted peach salad.",5.0
"This place is awesome! Great breakfast empanadas, fantastic coffee and awesome lunch and dinner options too. Staff and owners are really friendly and make you feel right at home. This is a great business that fills a niche in the neighborhood. Really happy they are just around the corner!",5.0

"Great place for lunch. Super nice people, great sandwiches and salads, good coffee and a little kiddo play area makes it a great addition to the neighborhood. I will be back!",4.0
"I love this place. The sandwiches are terrific (esp. the pork/broccoli rabe, but also the eggplant, and the steak), the staff is friendly, and there's a cute back patio. Pricey, but the neighborhood is getting pricier in general (which is another story), so that's not unexpected. It's kid friendly - there's a little play area in the back and, as I discovered this morning, they're trying out a weekday morning sing-a-long for kids (with a super talented and adorable singer/guitar player). I probably won't bring my laptop here to work, because the seating is a little limited, but there's a few nice bar stools in the window, and it's a great place to stop in and pick up a sandwich on the way home. I do wish there were a few more prepared food options - I assume they're rolling them out gradually as they find their footing - but the ones they do have are solid. Overall, great place, and I hope it does well.",5.0
