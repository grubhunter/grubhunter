Excellent. Ordered delivery and it came to our door - a good two miles away - in about 30 minutes.The small margarita pie was a decent size. The apple salad was a very nice mix of cold and warm elements. I split the pizza and salad with another person and we both filled up for $30 total with tip + delivery. Solid. Would for sure order again.,5.0
"Went here on a tour, and the pizza was delightful!  Would definitely return here for a more leisurely meal.  Had some outdoor seating which was nice. It was just street side, but was a nice respite from the warm day. Also had good selection of local beer.",4.0
"As you may know, I consider myself the foremost expert on pizza (doesn't everybody?). I have searched for something on this side of the Atlantic to compare to my experiences in Italy, and they never compare.Table 87 made a nice pizza pie. It was tasty, well-cooked, and had that crust and dough you expect. I prefer wood-fired, but still, the burnt crust (in a good way), and the melted cheese had great flavor.The service was good, they had us seated quickly despite knowing it might be too busy. The restaurant was a bit warm, but that was due to the way I was dressed.All-in-all, it was a great experience, and good pizza!",4.0
"Stopped in right before they were closing to grab some 'za after a show in the neighborhood. Their kitchen had closed but they were still making pies, so my friend and I split a 12 in. mushroom and truffle pizza at their small bar. Delicious! Small space, but quaint and friendly service! Would definitely recommend to go for affordable pizza in the Gowanus neighborhood.",4.0
I had high hopes and expectations before I came to Table87. I've heard and read such good things about their pizza. They sell their slices and pies by mail around the US from their deal on shark tank. When I got to table 87 I was excited to chow down on some coal fired pizza. The pictures posted on social media really hyped it up. So we sat down in the back room and ordered our food. The Margherita pie was tasty but was lacking salt. The pizza was good but I've had better living in  Brooklyn my entire life. We enjoyed the pizza but wouldn't run back so fast. The service wasn't great either. Our waitress was not very attentive and we never got refills of water or napkins.,3.0
"We passed by this pizzeria many times while driving in the area and finally tried it; a good decision. The service was great, we were seated right away, and the food was marvelous. The sauce was just sweet enough and you could tell the toppings were fresh. Had the Burrata Margherita and House Made Sausage personal pies. Excellent experience, would come back.",5.0
"Grilled watermelon salad with crumbled goat cheese, basil, and balsamic was tasty and refreshing!Fontina and truffle pizza is delicious with more cheese than sauce which is just how I like my pizza. Margharita was good, better than average. What made the meal was the roasted spicy red peppers and garlic served on the side!Service was courteous and fast!",4.0
Order three slices. Slices were very good. Because I have my dog with me I got him a little piece of chicken which he loved. They threw it on the grill just for him.,5.0
"Absolutely delicious pizza, and the waiter Jason was amazing and attentive. I want to return to try the rest of the menu, I hear the baked clams are worth the drive from marine park...",5.0
"We love the thin-crust pizzas, particularly the mozz, prosciutto, arugula for take out and scoop up a side of yummy roasted garlic to top it off.  Just had lunch there with a friend and loved, loved, loved the short rib burger - satisfied a hankering for beef with rich flavor in every bite - and perfectly cooked to order.  The flat bread v. bun is a great idea.  One complaint: the side of salad with burger is not a salad but just over dressed lettuce leaves some of which are not as fresh as they should be.  One small thing, our waiter who has been there since it opened is a bit forgetful - kept coming back to the table to ask about parts of the order - this has happened before.  Pleasant guy but not as focused as you might hope.A great addition to the neighborhood and so happy for their success on 3rd Ave in transition.",4.0
"Came here on a Brooklyn Food and Culture tour. We got the 20 Coal Oven Margherita Pizza.  The pizza had good taste but the amount of cheese was so meager. It really needed a lot more on it. Sauce was good. The roasted garlic they had as a condiment was ok but the pepper condiment was too hot for a pizza in my opinion. We sat at the small bar and the bartender was really promoting their frozen pizza's after appearing and getting a deal on the show Shark Tank. I personally would not purchase the frozen pie based on what I had at the restaurant. For the price, I want something that fills me up.  More cheese please!!!!",2.0
"Pizza is fine. I think I'm spoiled by the many excellent places that we have access to in the city, but this place just isn't as good as many of the reviews will have you think. Crust is pretty dry and the rest of the pie is unremarkable. Have been here many times and it's pretty consistent. For reference, I really like Lucali across the canal and Speedy Romeo in Bed Stuy. They do get points for serving their pizza with those tasty peppers and roasted garlic though!",3.0
"Went for lunch yesterday around 1:45 and we were quoted a 15 minute wait. We ended up waiting about 40 minutes and when we got seated, the dining room was practically empty! I don't know if this was just bad time management, but it definitely did not make us feel like valued customers. The hostess was aloof and seemed very distracted and uncaring.Thankfully, our server was warm and attentive, and the pizza was good. We shared the small margherita and the small prosciutto. Both were good. The margherita had a soggy center, but away from the center was crisp. If they fix that, then the pizza would be way better. We also shared the apple crunch salad and the orrechiete pasta. The pasta was fine, nothing special. You can definitely make this dish at home easily. I didn't like the apple salad at all. The apples were grilled but instead of adding flavor, I think that just dried out the apples. The dressing was very sweet. Not a fan.Overall, I would come back if there's no wait and I would just get the pizza. The large looks really impressive. They also have roasted garlic served on the side to go with the pizza!",3.0

"Let me add my 5-star review to the pile of like-minded reviews. I came with a party of hungry (and discerningly Italian- American) gentlemen and had an excellent experience. We shared a number of dishes, in addition to checking out a Margherita pie, which was perfect. Standouts included: eggplant rollatini, orichette with broccoli rabe and sausage, cappelini with clams.Our server was Jason, who could not have been better - attentive, friendly, knowledgeable.  I'll definitely be back!",5.0
"This restaurant is bigger and roomier than the one on Atlantic Avenue.  The staff are awesome and accommodating. The food is always outstanding and remarkable.  I brought my two toddlers to the restaurant and they had space to walk around without interfering with the wait staff.  The pizza is delicious, fresh and oh so tasty - ask for extra sauce so you can dip the pizza. I had the special for the day, which was shrimp stuffed with crabmeat on a bed of linguine.  I enjoyed it as much as my kids did, which tells you something about their food and my kids are picky eater.This restaurant is very accessible by bus and train and not too far from the city.  It's a must go NYC pizza restaurant that you do not want to miss out on.  Authentic thin slice NYC pizza that cannot be missed. The staff are awesome.  My husband knows most of the staff and they go back n forth btwn the Atlantic Avenue and this restaurant.  We will be back with a bigger empty stomach to eat more of their delicious food.  Come and join us.....",5.0
"Checked this place out the other week fairly close to their closing time on a week night so we were 1 of only 2 tables and eventually the last ones in the back room.  We had a great experience!  Our waiter was pleasant and helpful with good recommendations when I asked his favorite pizzas.  We had the truffle mushroom pie, which I appreciated had red sauce.  So many mushroom pies are white and I always like the red sauce for flavor!  We also had the one with prosciutto and arugula.  Everything was delicious and I loved the crispy thin crust.  We do eat a lot of great pizza so to be nit-picky, my only slight complaint was the ratio of topping to crust.  I wouldn't have minded a little more sauce, toppings, etc for flavor.  At times felt it was a bit too weighted on the crust side but we'll definitely be back and try some other pies and possibly other non-pizza items on the menu!",4.0
"Have ordered from here a couple times and ate in twice. Pizza is consistently good - well crafted and balanced with right amount of ingredients. Fungi pizza is always my go to. 4 stars for having quality food and Wednesday movie night, where they project onto a wall across the street (movies like Ferris Bueller and Jumanji!) Reason why this place doesn't get a 5 star is they only serve beer and wine - wouldn't mind a short list of cocktail options! Table 87 also sells frozen slices at whole foods - just waiting for the Park Slope Co-op to carry it!",4.0
"I recently had a party here for work and everyone was CRAZY about it. I had such a wonderful experience. The food was absolutely incredible.

Would be so happy to have another event here!",5.0
"Let's build a pizza comparison case:1.  Are they better than Dominos?  Definitely.  That's the bar.  You gotta at least be above the bar to make it in this neighborhood.2.  Are they better than Giuseppina's?  No.  They make a similar style of pizza, but at Giuseppina's you get a few more options and a little more style.3.  Are they better than Pauline & Sharon's?  Well it depends.  I apparently like my pizza with a touch of condescension and a dash of bad attitude, so I'd say no, but hey I appreciate that not everybody likes to feel scolded when buying their pizza, so if you're one of those people, then Table 87 is your solution.There are some serious Italians at this place... just call in and you'll see what I mean.  ""Shure hun.  Okaayy hun.""  Right outta Sopranos.  Love it.  Friendly staff and old school Italian style.  I've gone in here just to grab a slice, and also ordered a whole pie for takeout.  Getting a fresh pie is of course the way to go.  It looks like they have some nice seating in the back and some other good things on the menu besides pizza so I'll have to give those a try some day.  The calzones look delicious too.Also, don't forget the complimentary roasted garlic and the chili oil!",4.0

"Great Pizza and Great Service.My friends and I stumbled upon this cute little pizza joint in the neighborhood and we're happy to say that we will for sure come back again.We started off with the calamari appetizer. Simple and to the point. Crispy and light.For our mains we ordered the margherita pizza and the fontina cheese pizza to share. Both were very well made and super tasty. The crust was perfect and the tomato sauce they use was very flavorful. They provided us with a complimentary side of roasted garlic and spicy peppers that add a huge kick to the pie. A huge upgrade from garlic powder and red pepper flakes. We had such a great experience that we could not turn down their dessert. I ordered their homemade tiramisu. The waitress had made a comment about how one of the girls who worked their make them every day and it was well worth it. My friend ordered the key lime pie which was also good, but mine was better.Overall our waitress was really nice and funny.

"Not sure what the fuss is about. Pizza is definitely not Up to par by NYC standards . Crust is soggy and doesn't holdup to the sauce and cheese.

Way too thin and too small. it doesnt do the restaurant justice!The pizza is excellent, the garlic and spicy pepper sauce is awesome!",4.0
"The pizza is great.  But, the service is terrible. Both in-house and delivery.  I ate here not long after the place opened and had a pretty bad experience - appetizers never came, my dinner was served 25 minutes before husband's was, etc... no apologies, nothing was comped.  We were kinda pissed but, we figured it was due to a new restaurant starting out and having some issues getting it together.  Since then we've ordered delivery a handful of times and it's been fine.  It always takes a about 30 minutes longer than most other pizza shops, but no big deal.Tonight we ordered a pizza for delivery.  90 minutes later a mess showed up.  Cold, soggy, and totally mangled, folded over, etc.  (I wish I could post a photo to this review) My husband called to see what happened and the first person he spoke to said, ""we can give you a new pizza but we have to pick up the old one first."" As if we were lying!! We were shocked. Asked to speak to the manager.  He was rude on the phone.  My husband asked for a refund and he said he couldn't do that because we ordered through grub hub.  ""It's refund or replacement.  Those are the only options.  And you can't get a refund so the only option is we can send someone to pick it up."" No ""sorry for the inconvenience"" or ""we'll give you a credit on another pizza"" or anything that any normal, respectful, restaurant would offer a repeat customer.  My husband ended up driving there with the pizza to show them so we didn't have to wait another 2 hours to eat. And then, they offered a him refund and a new pizza to save face in front of the other customers there.  In the end they made it right (hence 2 stars) but it took my husband driving there and confronting them in person in front of customers for them to do so.",2.0
"With such great reviews and only a few blocks from my apartment, I was excited to make this my go-to pizza place. Unfortunately, I was less than impressed by the pizza. I've tried their pizzas twice, and both times, it fell flat. There was nothing special. The prosciutto pizza is too dry and the toppings were just flying off the pizz.However, the prosciutto/ricotta cheese calzone was delicious - the perfect amount of prosciutto and cheese. With so many great pizza places nearby, I won't be revisiting for any of the slices - but the calzone - worth a trip back.",3.0
"Just the best. Amazing pizza that haunts me in my dreams. Have never had a bad thing here. Came here once and ordered the stuffed pepper special, which may or may not have changed the course of my earthly existence. Had a cannoli that made me question if I should have kids just so I could introduce them to something so wonderful. If I had to eat all the carbs, I would like to eat them here.",5.0
The Pizza was not bad. There's something disappointing about ordering from a place that's highly rated on Yelp only to find out that's it's subpar. What's more frustrating is for the pizza to arrive more than an hour later (at least double the promised time) tasting like something you could have bought from the deli across the street. Good luck running a business like that in this great city!,2.0

I've had most of the known greats around here! Cooked to perfection and perfect sauce. Place is cool, clean, and the people are friendly. If it was closer to my house, I'd be there every day.",5.0
Amazing everything. From the salat to the coffee and everything in between. Pizza is one of the best I ever had. Must try.,5.0
"The absolute best!!!!!!! The food is incredible. What makes it even better is the service. Jason is the star of Table 87. We have never had a server more attentive and fabulous as he. We ask for him every time. If I were to open a restaurant I would make him manage it in a heart beat. Love this place. Try everything, there isn't anything that is below exceptional here.",5.0
"REALLY good.. Stopped in today for a few slices, went with two margherita.. They were awesome.  Light, a lil crisp on the crust, a fresh sweet marinara sauce, and just the right amount of cheese and basil. If you liked Lombardi's, you'll enjoy here too without the headache commute!! They also gave a nice bar inside, so maybe a great place for a nightcap and end of night slice!",5.0
"Ever since I moved away from the neighborhood the main thing I miss is my old pizza joints... and this is the one I miss the most!The pizza is excellent, the sides perfect.The only reason not 5 stars is because of the frozen pizza that you can buy in the grocery store - its very disappointing. Way too thin and too small. it doesnt do the restaurant justice!The pizza is excellent, the garlic and spicy pepper sauce is awesome!",4.0
"The pizza is great.  But, the service is terrible. Both in-house and delivery.  I ate here not long after the place opened and had a pretty bad experience - appetizers never came, my dinner was served 25 minutes before husband's was, etc... no apologies, nothing was comped.  We were kinda pissed but, we figured it was due to a new restaurant starting out and having some issues getting it together.  Since then we've ordered delivery a handful of times and it's been fine.  It always takes a about 30 minutes longer than most other pizza shops, but no big deal.Tonight we ordered a pizza for delivery.  90 minutes later a mess showed up.  Cold, soggy, and totally mangled, folded over, etc.  (I wish I could post a photo to this review) My husband called to see what happened and the first person he spoke to said, ""we can give you a new pizza but we have to pick up the old one first."" As if we were lying!! We were shocked. Asked to speak to the manager.  He was rude on the phone.  My husband asked for a refund and he said he couldn't do that because we ordered through grub hub.  ""It's refund or replacement.  Those are the only options.  And you can't get a refund so the only option is we can send someone to pick it up."" No ""sorry for the inconvenience"" or ""we'll give you a credit on another pizza"" or anything that any normal, respectful, restaurant would offer a repeat customer.  My husband ended up driving there with the pizza to show them so we didn't have to wait another 2 hours to eat. And then, they offered a him refund and a new pizza to save face in front of the other customers there.  In the end they made it right (hence 2 stars) but it took my husband driving there and confronting them in person in front of customers for them to do so.",2.0
"With such great reviews and only a few blocks from my apartment, I was excited to make this my go-to pizza place. Unfortunately, I was less than impressed by the pizza. I've tried their pizzas twice, and both times, it fell flat. There was nothing special. The prosciutto pizza is too dry and the toppings were just flying off the pizz.However, the prosciutto/ricotta cheese calzone was delicious - the perfect amount of prosciutto and cheese. With so many great pizza places nearby, I won't be revisiting for any of the slices - but the calzone - worth a trip back.",3.0
"Just the best. Amazing pizza that haunts me in my dreams. Have never had a bad thing here. Came here once and ordered the stuffed pepper special, which may or may not have changed the course of my earthly existence. Had a cannoli that made me question if I should have kids just so I could introduce them to something so wonderful. If I had to eat all the carbs, I would like to eat them here.",5.0
The Pizza was not bad. There's something disappointing about ordering from a place that's highly rated on Yelp only to find out that's it's subpar. What's more frustrating is for the pizza to arrive more than an hour later (at least double the promised time) tasting like something you could have bought from the deli across the street. Good luck running a business like that in this great city!,2.0

"Very nice pizza slice, price $ 4 or 4.50 but I guess in this City you can't excape from high prices... I would cut the slice a bit larger at least! Enjoy.Ps. Maybe the slice is so expensive so you buy a whole pizza which might be worth?! I'll think about it.",4.0
"Great addiction to the neighborhood, and so glad they offer delivery, unlike other so called fancy pizzerias in the neighborhood.The pizza is simply delicious! Cole cooked, thin sliced, delicious cheese, good amount of sauce, and fresh basil on top. Just the way I like my pizza, a true New York pizza! Reminded me a lot of difara's & grimaldis, which is a HUGE compliment, considering there considered to be the best. Welcome to the neighborhood, and for a delicious dinner :-)",5.0
"I love the food here. I've come here about three times and have eaten the margarita pie, the orecchiette pasta dish and linguine with white clam sauce and all dishes were fantastic. Service is friendly and personable even though the restaurant gets busy you never feel like you're being rushed out. The only reason it's not 5 stars for me is because of how loud it is, usually because of screaming/ wandering kids (there was a boy flossing at his table last time I went). If this doesn't deter you then go for it, I will definitely be returning here!",4.0
"Just happened to stumble upon this gem.  First, the atmosphere is charming and inviting.  The staff was very knowledgable and kind.  Did i mention thier draft beer list, is impressive for a pizza joint.  CANT FORGET THE FOOD!  Thier pizza has a classic and delicious flavor, but with a modern twist.  We ordered the prosciutto and arugula pizza, delicious and expertly crisp.  Just like pizza should be.  The baby greens salad is simple, but simply delectable.  So fresh!  We had a great time here, and are very glad we stumbled into this place.  Will definitely frequent this spot!",5.0
"This is a place that cares for their food. Every plate comes out fresh and presented with care. I would give this place 5 stars but they advertise a pizza with Sicilian fried eggplant but it is not the Sicilian version (it was supposed to be thick slices and the skin included).With that being said I am hooked, great food and great service.",4.0
"Food is good, but the pizza did not stand out compared to their food. Their pastas were delicious as were their appetizers. Their pizza tasted fine but it got soggy fast or right away. We got plenty of the 12"" and one 20"" pies and we were unable to hold them in our hands at all. That's a big no no for NYC pizza I think. The price was fair for the pizza and when you add toppings, they put a good amount. The different pizzas all tasted similar. The flavors weren't that distinctive. They are still getting 4 stars because their other foods were better and service is great. We had their clams appetizer which was delicious, but small. Seafood salad is so good. Lasagna, pappardelle with steak tips, and the ossobucco were DELICIOUS! We also had the fennel sausage roll which was okay.",4.0
"I love Table 87's food, decor and service.  Dine in or take out, the food is always on point.  I don't know why I haven't been coming to this place longer - it is of the best pizza I've ever had in any borough.What's makes 87 unique, is their classy menu and garlic oil accouterments. This stuff is out of control.  It makes me wish there was more crust to spread the garlic on.  Everything we had was great.  The salad was crisp and not over dressed.  The calamari was tender and not over breaded.  The pizza... I mean - wow.  Piping hot, cripsy, cheesy, fresh ingredients.  It was a symphony.  87 is great for dine in or take out.  What's neat, too, is that we got a parking spot across the street.The service was attentive and warm.  I will definitely be back.",5.0
"Makes me sad to write this review because I so badly wanted to like it here! I've driven by and walked by a bunch of times and decided to finally walk in last night. The service was just really bad - even if the food were amazing they would get 3 stars.We were forced to eat at the bar and not given an option to wait for a table. Ignored by the bartender for 5 minutes at an empty bar as well. Girlfriend ordered what may have been the most expensive salad in all of Brooklyn. If you're curious, 10 bucks gets you a small amount of steak, not even enough to fill up a 100 pound woman. The timing of the food delivery topped it off. The steak salad came out first, ten minutes later I got a side of sauce for my calzone. 5-6 minutes later I got my meal. As you might imagine, watching my girlfriend eat for 15 minutes, then having her watch me eat wasn't too enjoyable. Honestly it doesn't take much to impress me at a restaurant and I rarely leave negative reviews. An ""I'm sorry"" any time through dinner would have gone far.",2.0
Delicious to dine in and delicious to take out.  I love this pizza. It's not your typical 2am slice -- and thats what I love about it. It's upscale without being pretentous and the coal oven really makes the difference. Toppings are high quality and the dough is great -- not too chewy!,4.0

The server checked in a couple times, but left us waiting for a long time for the check. Meanwhile, our neighbors couldn't stop raving about their server.

"I've had two of their pizzas: The first one was their vegetable, and the second was their margarita. To qualify a bit, I'm a professional pastry chef instructor who actually teaches pizza, I also have eaten  the best pizza's NYC has to offer, as well as sampled pizza in Italy, Chicago, SF, etc.   Here's my opinion. They do a good job in general by using good, fresh ingredients, and their oven does the job nicely. Two issues: the vegetable pie veggies are underdone & under-seasoned. Underdone because they are applied raw and the oven is so hot the pizza is done well before the veggies get a chance to cook. The margarita is tasty but IMO they take the thin crust concept too thin.

Hello NY Pizza!!!!  I loved the pizza and the delivery was super fast!,5.0
"Hey! I found this place from Shark Tank. I live in California and I was ECSTATIC to get my pizza in the mail! I bought 8 slices and I was thrilled to open the box. It was sent with overnight shipping with ice packs, I was so thankful. The  I got home, popped it in the freezer and had it the following night for dinner. The packaging is very nice. However, there is a slight problem... I want to go ahead and say it is NOT about the flavor of the pizza because it is AMAZING and not the quality either, but the single slices unfortunately have a tendency to break because they are so thin and fragile. I've had 4 pieces of my 8 break in multiple pieces and 1 flat out broke in half and fell onto the floor. One was cracked in the package and the crust completely came detached from the pizza itself. Not a major issue, still edible of course, just an inconvenience. But, I understand it is very difficult to delivery across the country without there being any cracks.

"Hey! I found this place from Shark Tank. I live in California and I was ECSTATIC to get my pizza in the mail! I bought 8 slices and I was thrilled to open the box.

"I can't believe I waited so long to try this amazing place! This is in my opinion the best pizza in the city! I'm Italian and I moved to NYC 8 years ago. It has been a constant struggle to find a decent pizza in this city. I can say I've tried all the most popular places and always left disappointed.While tonight I was so happy and satisfied with my choice!First of all the ingredients are fresh and top quality. Mozzarella and tomato sauce are delicious and don't taste like usual NY stuff.The dough is great, crust is thin without being too thin.I'm really excited I found this place!The delivery was a bit slow, but I ordered on Halloween night so I should consider myself lucky that I received my pizza at all!",5.0
This place is wonderful - definitely a neighborhood joint! Their pizzas are always crispy and delicious and their pastas are great as well. They have a great beer selection and usually a decent cheaper option. On Wednesdays they do outdoor movie nights which are always packed! I would recommend either eating in or taking away - don't let the delivery reviews deter you from checking out this gem.,5.0

They also have Panini's, pasta , beer, wine etc plus the workers are so pleasant! Best in Brooklyn",5.0
"Love the pizza, however 2 hours and counting as I type for a delivery is unacceptable.   Take a tip from Dinosaur BBQ and don't deliver on weekends if you can't handle the work load.  First it was leaving in 5 minutes after an hour when Seamless stated 30-45 minutes, after another 30 minutes the delivery guy supposedly was in an accident (Dique) that only damaged the pizza.  Now 2 hours and 10 minutes later we still wait for a pie and a meatball roll.  How nice",3.0

""Whateves"")my neighbor told me these guys had opened, so we hopped it over on a Sunday night, and sat at the bar (i highly recommend it, you'll see why :)first off, excellent beers on tap, and they are served ICE Cold...but it's hard to pass up the ridiculously cheap Coors Light at Happy Hourmy buddy and I started off splitting the homemade sausage one... delicious, great chewy crust, excellent cheese, just about perfect (12"" is not super large)then the gorgeous bartender (ok ok, i gave it away) leaned down and grabbed two jars, one with roasted garlic ""jam"" and one with hot peppers (i believe in vinegar)to steal a line from a tv chef, you can put that garlic on a shoe and it would make said shoe delicious!!i didn't care if we would smell like garlic for three days - that stuff is unreal, and they should just sell jars of that!we soon polished off our 12"" pizza and realized we could do another, looking over - we saw another two dudes sitting at the bar eating the breakfast one (egg and pancetta)... well monkey-see... and boy was this monkey happy with the subsequent monkey-do!! just awesomeso good that i dragged the mrs back there w/ the kid, a week later (even though neither eat pizza!)on special that night was none other than her favorite dish... orechiette with broccoli rabe and sausage... same homemade sausage that was used on our pizza - she loved iti ordered the breakfast pizza again, this time just for myself... but paid extra and had them add truffle oili proceeded to douse it in roasted garlic ""jam"" and i was in heaven -until that is, i thought, hey, lemme try a slice as-is, you know, without using half a jar of garlic-jam and half a jar of hot-peppers on itguess what? stunning on its ownjust stunning...like you know who...:)",5.0
"Awesome slice, maybe the best in Brooklyn. Worth the money. Used to live around the corner and consistency was top notch, slice or whole pie, take out or dine in. Nice staff too, family restaurant vibe. Decor is a little too Hip Brooklyn vs Cracker Barrel for my taste, but that doesn't matter in the least when the pizza is so good.

"Table 87 opened a few years ago on Atlantic Ave in Brooklyn Heights, they recently added this second location in Gowanus which has a lot of space but is ultimately a near duplicate of the original. The pizza is excellent and the prices are ok. I stopped by for a slice and a beer. A plain margherita slice runs $4 (tax included) and drafts are $4-6.

"Got a personal sized homemade sausage pizza (they give the option of hot or sweet, so I went for hot) to go and enjoyed a draft while waiting. The pizza was the real-deal spectacular! Thin crust with both that crispy texture you get from a seriously hot coal oven, yet with that slight chew of truly great pies. The toppings were evenly spread across each slice, and the ingredients were obviously of excellent quality.I'd had slices before and knew they had chops, but the full pie fresh out of the oven is on another level.* The draft I had was an IPA from The Other Half; bonus points for carrying a local brew and serving it through clean lines! This place single-handedly put the other local pizza joints on notice that they'd better up their game or go quietly into the night. Overall highly recommended.",5.0

"Our friends and I came to Table 87 yesterday to try out the slices here. I wasn't expecting a lot, but we all came away thoroughly impressed and wanting to return again soon.We had a vivacious and enthusiastic server who was more than happy to explain a lot of the ingredients on the pizzas and appetizers. It was slightly over the top, but he was friendly and attentive, and gave us a few handy tips about what to order. In the end, we opted for the grilled watermelon salad and two pies: the burrata margherita and the fig-speck-arugula.The grilled watermelon salad was really tasty, with nice char marks on the watermelon and fennel, and the balsamic vinaigrette drizzle lent a nice compliment to the sweetness of the fruit. It also came with goat cheese, which is a favourite topping of mine on salads. Great salad, guys!I was also utterly happy with our burrata margherita pizza. This is one of their pizzas that's on the special menu, but I'm crossing my fingers it gets promoted to the regular menu because of how amazing it was. I'm a huge fan of burrata, and the creaminess of this cheese was an outstanding contrast to the fragrant sauce and the basil. The crust is pretty thin, but not so thin that it couldn't hold the ingredients on the pie. Yum. The fig-speck-arugula pie was also a great combo and highly recommended, though a bit too heavy-handed with the arugula.Alongside the pies, Table 87 also brings over marinated peppers and roasted garlic. DAT GARLIC. I think between the four of us, we ate half the jar (and lived to tell the tale later that night with our dragon breath). I usually don't eat my crusts, but that roasted garlic was amazing with the pizza crusts and amg love. Apparently you can also request the peppers and roasted garlic for delivery if you're ordering pies through Seamless, yesss.",4.0
I quite enjoyed the margarita.  The place itself had a very homey vibe with a general store feel because of all the canned and jarred goods for sale. The chicken roll violated basic BK chicken roll standards. The chicken was grilled which is a no no because all true born Brooklynites know it's gotta be parmed or just cutlet. It also had broccoli rabe in it. Don't get me wrong because I love my rabe but it has no place in my roll which inevitably made it soggy. I would come back for a slice and maybe a beer. They had a wide range on tap but I did take out.,3.0

The portions were a nice size the calamari was a nice size the sauce that came with it was like no other sauce i had before it looked like it was homemade .

My wife and I find ourselves going a lot. In the first place the people make you feel like your part of the family. We are always welcomed when we come. The food is always good. From the specials to the staple on the menu. The roasted garlic and hot peppers are the best.,4.0

The idea is great and I'm sure eat-in is better but I've ordered twice online and both pies looked the same - folded over from sliding while delivery guys are biking around the neighborhood.

"The service is terrible. The food is good, but definitely not so good to overcome an over 1 hour wait for take out which was placed 30 mins before we got there to pick up our pie and hot antipasto.

When we got there, we were told that they might have forgotten our order ""b/c it happens here occasionally."" So we were gracious and got a beer at the bar. We were asked to pay for our order and our beers at the same time. If we hadn't already paid, we would have angrily walked out after 30 mins when we were told about our order, ""I don't know if they started it yet."" By the time our order was ready, we were starved, frustrated, and shocked at how bad the customer service was.

"While spending the weekend in NY, our favorite dinner was here. The drinks were delicious--the locally brewed IPA was top notch. Chris, our bartender & server, was excellent--so friendly, knowledgeable, helpful and hospital. We had the Margherita Pizza (cooked to perfection) and the calamari--excellent! The organic Chianti was a perfect pairing with dinner. I also like how they screen movies outside, such a cool neighborhood event. We loved this place & hope to return again!",5.0

An exciting addition to the pizza options in Gowanus and South Slope.  We got the special of the day and were not disappointed.

Excellent Margherita pizza. Great crisp tender crust. Nice sauce.  Burrata pizza very rich with spicy porkey sauce.  Grilled octopus tender though some what sandy.  Go all in with pizzas.  Nutella with strawberry and marshmallow pizza unique and loved by the kids.,4.0
This place is the best !   You walk in and Chris at the bar is gracious and a Prince !   The food is phenomenal.  I particularly love the lasagna!   The salami platter is the best I've ever had.  They have an organic chianti on tap that is smooth and delicious.  I know Italian food and they are one of the best in Brooklyn.  Which is NOT a casual comment.,5.0
Abbas is the nicest waiter. Food was really good. A bit on the pricier side but I guess you could say it fits into the neighborhood. I love the marinated garlic and peppers that accompany your pizza.,5.0
"I just move back to brooklyn and am so happy for doing this. Why you're asking me? Pizza. It seem like every neighborhood has at least 1 good place for having a slice, and in gowanus table 87 is this place. I try the margherita and a special octopus kind of pizza, it's perfect. The service is casual, but very attentive, and the boys are knowing their stuff and it shows. I'm getting hungry as I write this, like very hungry. They have no liquor, but have a good selection of wine and beer. Okay, enough review, I'm heading over to grab another slice.",5.0
"My boyfriend and I were in the neighborhood running a few errands on a cold, rainy afternoon and decided to pop in for a quick bite.  Since Gowanus isn't our usual stomping ground, we didn't quite know what to expect from this place but it turned out to be such a great delight.  We share the baked clams and burrata margarita pie which were simply delicious!  Not only was the food amazing, but the service was impeccable.  Our server Jason was extremely personable and very knowledgeable about the menu.  It was refreshing to be served by such a nice and genuine person, definitely made our experience that much better.  The atmosphere was cozy and charming, perfect for brightening up a gloomy day.  Overall we had a lovely experience I will definitely be back for sure!",4.0
I ordered from here last night and it was outstanding! I've never had better delivery pizza!  Get the spec and arugula pizza you will not regret it particularly if you get the table 87 salad on the side.,5.0
This is a delightful place. Lovely wait staff and very good food at reasonable prices. We shared an order of pasta primavera made with fresh vegetables that was very authentic -- just delicious! Also tried the margarita pizza and loved it. Coal oven crust as good as the old Grimaldi's. Comfortable seating too. Recommend it!,5.0
"burnt, overpriced pizza, bad service.  I went to this place with a couple friends.  I love New York thin crust pizza, and this place came recommended.  The pizza, sadly, was burned on the bottom.  It was blackened and bitter.  Not only did it not taste gross, but it isn't safe to eat anything burnt.  It's carcinogenic - it may cause cancer.  I brought it to the attention of the server that the pizza we received was burnt on the bottom, and he told me that next time I should tell them how I want the pizza cooked.  Seriously?  I have to TELL the server not to screw up the pizza? How would that conversation go, I wonder?  ""Hi, I'd like a large pizza please.""""Okay."" ""Oh, by the way, I have a special request."" ""Yes?""""Please don't burn it.""""Oh, you DO NOT want us to BURN your pizza?  I'm glad you mentioned that, because otherwise we would've burned that mother to the ground.  Yeah that's how we do it here.  We serve you blackened scraps unless you explicitly tell us not to.""

The prices are about the same as other neighborhood places.",4.0
Had dinner this weekend. Pizza and calzone were awesome. For desert we had tiramisu that was homemade by the girl behind the bar and was absolutely incredible (with shaved chocolate on top).

"This is a great new addition to the neighborhood! The atmosphere is pleasant and the pizza is delicious- thin and crispy crust with very tasty sauce. In addition, the waitstaff is friendly and accommodating, which always makes for a more pleasant dining experience. That being said there was a bit of a ""situation"" when I was dining there that made me question whether or not I would go back... The table behind my table (I was sitting with two other people) was made up of two VERY loud and (hopefully, based on their behavior) drunk couples who ruined the whole experience. Not only was the small seating area in the back filled with their screeching (worse than shouting, I swear) but they were having elaborate conversations about- I kid you not- spreading feces all over walls. This of course was among other unspeakable things... Now, I am no prude, I enjoy more than my fair share of beers on a night out, but this was on another level. I understand that this is not to the fault of the restaurant but I believe the situation could have been handled differently- where was the manager?! My table, as well as a number of the other tables in the small space complained and nothing was done...

Pizza was pretty good but want to mention that the size of the 20 inch pie only consists of 8 regular slices - not sure why the other reviewer said it was so large.  And there certainly could have been more sauce and cheese - had there been I would have given it 4 stars.  Had 2 pies delivered but was disappointed it didn't serve more people.,3.0

"The pizza looks delicious (though I did not try it,) but the two stars are for the panini I ordered. I had the grilled chicken panini and it was absolutely bland. It's not a good sign when you reach into your own fridge to make a sandwich better. The chicken was dry and not seasoned enough. I didn't realize you could choose between baguette or ciabatta so they automatically gave me ciabatta bread which was also dry. The only reason I'd come back here would be to try one of their slices.

It's not a good sign when you reach into your own fridge to make a sandwich better. The chicken was dry and not seasoned enough. I didn't realize you could choose between baguette or ciabatta so they automatically gave me ciabatta bread which was also dry. The only reason I'd come back here would be to try one of their slices. If you want a sandwich, though, I'd go somewhere else.",2.0
