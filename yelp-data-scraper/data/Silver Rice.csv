"Wow. I love this place. Don't get scared about the healthy slant to their sushi - it's absolutely delicious. It's fresh, served at the right temperature, and their rice alone is so, so delicious - slightly stick, slightly sweet.The prices here are also quite reasonable, and they have a nice range of options, including some great desserts. I hiiiighly recommend this place.",5.0
"Unbelievable delivery time! We ordered at around 6:05pm, the guy who took the order said it would take about 30-45 minutes to have our food delivered. I can understand that as it was dinner time and it's a weekend. But about 10-12 minutes more or less after I hung up the phone, our door bell rang. We all gave each other the look and were thinking the same thing, ""don't me it's the food guy"". And it was!! Arrived nice and got in a neat package.Next, we wondered if the food would taste good since they made it so quickly. Oh, by the way, we are located only about 5 blocks away from them. But still, it was super fast, and the food was GOOD. The containers of food looked small when we took them out of the bag - or maybe we were just famished. But halfway through, our bellies were filled. So glad we found this place today. We just wish that the menu or food selection would increase/expand. But then again, we don't want the quality of food to be compromised if they offer too large a variety. I think we'd rather they keep the menu small if it means the food will remain delicious forever.",4.0
"Silver Rice is a well curated Japanese spot serving a limited menu of your favorite rolls, salads, 'cups' (basically DonBurri Eel and Salmon cups) and other favorites with a post-gentrification price tag. Don't get me wrong the menu was solid, the sushi and the cup flavors were spot on and absolutely satiated my sushi craving, but it wasn't cheap. Although, is there a place that does cheap delicious sushi? I don't think so,  if so please DM me ASAP.Silver Rice is incredibly popular, and so seating is very limited and kind of annoying to snag.  Everything is served in paper cups or plating, and on a tray. It's a counter service restaurant, place, get your sauces, sit (or more likely, stand) until your order comes out. The eel and salmon were delicious and good quality. I couldn't help but feel like I was missing out as I hadn't ordered the Macrobiotic (beets instead of sushi!) as other folks were raving about it. I'll get it next time.I would give this place THREE stars if I were to compare it to other Japanese restaurants which have full menus, but there isn't much competition in the area.Big Plus is I heard they are opening another location down Flatbush Ave in PLG!",3.0
"This past weekend, I had an amazing craving for Sushi. In my usual manner, I took to YELP to find a restaurant that I've never tried before. Yelp is wonderful for finding hidden gems. So, I perused a few options within my area and decided to try Silver Rice. I decided to walk over to Silver Rice, given the fact that the rain had letup and I need the fresh air. The plan was for me to get some sushi before heading over to Bam Rose Cinemas to watch ""Where Do We Invade Next"" (A must see movie by Michael Moore)When I go to new places, I make it a habit of letting my waiter or waitress know that it's my first time. This is import to me because it gives them an opportunity to showcase their best both personally and what's on the menu. The beautiful lady who took my order was extremely patient as she explained my options and all the possible combinations. I reviewed the menu before I arrived and so I had an idea of what I wanted to order. I ordered the yellow tail roll and the veggie cup! I'm going back this week to have another and that just about sums up how excellent my meal was. I highly recommend Silver Rice - 100%",4.0
"I'm so relieved Silver Rice came into my life. It's different from any other sushi restaurant I've been to. It's more of a coffee shop kind of feel rather than a sit down waiter service restaurant. The sushi is still high quality even though it's served in disposable paper cups. The dinning seating is very snug and limited, so a lot of customers order to-go or even order delivery (which is amazing). They have a great variety on their menu, filled with different rolls, cups, bowls, sides... even saki. All unique and overall great quality. I ordered the Silver Rice spicy salmon cup, which is a cup of rice topped with salmon tartar, avocados, cucumbers, and spicy sauce. I've never had anything like it--so so good. My friend got the Fisherman's bowl, which looked amazing. It was filled with a variety of different raw fish and veggies over rice. A little on the pricey side compared to most of the options (Bowls are $14 as cups are $6), but you get what you pay for. Pros: Awesome quality sushi, great variety, cute clean atmosphere, option for delivery and take-out, and very nice employees.Cons: Cramped limited seating if you want to eat-in, sushi on the pricey side, and that's about it :)",5.0
"Silver Rice is not your typical sushi restaurant. The quality is high, it is set up with very limited seating and all of the food is served in disposable cups and take out containers even if you dine in. It has a coffee shop feel even though you are eating sushi.I came on a Saturday during the day and there was a limited brunch menu. There were not that many choices on rolls or other items. I got a crab and kale miso soup which had a surprisingly large amount of crab.I also got the spicy salmon cup and a California roll with real crab. (Normally I would never get a California roll but there were not many choices and it was not imitation crab so it was pretty good).The quality of the food is excellent and the choices are more innovative than your run of the mill sushi joint. The food feels healthy and fresh and the service is pleasant. This is a post - gentrification restaurant and I don't mean that in a bad way. The reason I give four stars and not five is that I would like the dine in experience to be a little less casual. If I am spending a bit more on this quality, I would kind of like to sit and enjoy it out of something that isn't cardboard,",4.0
"If you're a salmon sushi/sashimi fan, the Alaskan bowl is as good as it gets.  It's $14, and comes with a large portion of uber-fresh sliced salmon on top of white or flaxseed rice (it's amazing what a difference good rice makes), with some sliced onions and soy to add.  This is one of my favorite quick Seamless or pickup meals in the area.  If you're dining in, the ambiance is definitely casual, as others have noted.  I've had some of the rolls as well, which are fine, but the bowl is where it's at if you want a filling meal without breaking the bank on multiple rolls.",5.0
"OK pals, if you want great sushi and/or unique sushi, this is the place. I can't count how many times I've come here, because it draws me in all the time. If I want to go with a friend to eat dinner, or go somewhere alone and read while I eat, this always pops into my mind first.The inside isn't very big, but the seating areas both outside and inside are welcoming and casual. The staff is super nice and the bathroom is clean, too, which are huge bonuses! I usually get the Alaskan bowl because it's so freakin' beautiful (I want to attach a photo, but I can't figure it out). My first and only Instagram photo of food was of that darn Alaskan bowl, because I'm in love with it. I will always recommend this place. Silver Rice forever.",5.0
I really liked this place right after they opened. They used generous amount of real fresh fish. My recent experience has been not so great. They became so popular and did not maintain initial high quality. The amount and the quality of the fish has been siginificantly decreased. They hired Asian sushi cook sushi like strangling the rice. They should rather make pressed rice sheet and wrap fish inside. I stopped going lately because it's not worth the price.,2.0
"Best sushi ever. The ratio of fish to rice is how it should be! Had the Alaska bowl with tempura crunch. Heaven. Same with the unagi cup - comes with crunch, avocado and mango -- so so delicious!! The miso ice cream is a must try.",5.0
"This place is definitely my newest obsession. I've passed it by a million times and finally my optimism overruled my doubt. I was pleasantly surprised at how fresh the fish tasted, I had the spicy salmon roll and spicy tuna roll. They were both uber oralgasmic enough to bring me back two more times the same week (don't judge me lol). I also had the miso soup which is flavored just as it's supposed to be. I've had some miso soup that tasted like water. I also had the spicy tuna bowl which was delicious, tough to choose whether I like it or a roll better. I hope to try more items my next visit. This place is definitely added to my list of local faves.",5.0
"Wow. I got the Alaskan bowl, and I am pretty speechless at how fresh the salmon was! Definitely will try other sashimi options.",5.0
I am totally addicted to their spicy salmon cup. It's what my dreams are made of. The rice is warm and sweet and sticky. The salmon is perfectly smashed up and spicy with a decent spicy salmon to rice ratio. They also top is off with a little bit of avocado and cucumber. I kind of wish they would add a bit more veggies to it. I'm also obsessed with their pickled veggies. They're so tangy and crunchy!There's two complaints I have about this place. First is that they're only open for dinner and second I've had some issues with consistency in the quality of the fish. Usually it's great but occasionally the salmon is fishy and has those brown spots you see in lox. That's why they don't get 5 stars from me,4.0
"Great little place if you're having sushi cravings. I ordered the macrobiotic roll, which included beet pate (cashews, ginger, agave), avocado, and steamed kale. If you're looking for something healthy, this is a great option. I personally prefer having raw fish in my sushi though. I also ordered chirashi, specifically the Fisherman's Bowl since I was starving. This came out as a large bowl of sushi rice with the chef's choice of sashimi (salmon, tuna, etc.,), snow crab, scallops, eel, fish roe with a large assortment of vegetables (picked daikon radish, cucumber, scallions, and avocado). If you've never had this before, I recommend to try! Very tasty bowl of happiness. The way I like to eat it - take a bite of fish, and have some rice right after. And then alternate with different items. As I was waiting for my orders, they let me try hot sake. If that's not good customer service, then I don't know what is. Definitely would come back!",4.0
"Cute cramped and oh so delicious! This is the type of place that makes Brooklyn one of the best cities to eat in... It's sushi with a not your average healthy twist. They offer fresh selections you can't find else where!Their rice cups are the perfect light bites and you have a choice of regular white rice or flaxseed rice. If you are Vegan or gluten intolerant they have plenty of choices and offer lots of alternative sauces to cater to your needs. Still not convinced this isn't your average sushi spot??? What if I told you they offer a macrobiotic roll that's filled with beet paste, avocado, steamed kale and cucumber!!! That's one of the many unique options you will find at Silver Rice and no where else. The pickings here even stretch as far as to offer quinoa salad and organic miso soup! This place isn't a sit down place the seating is very limited but if your on your way home and you need something fresh and healthy that your body will thank you for then this is the place!",4.0

"Overpriced & Over-rated!!? Went here after a nice long day spent in Brooklyn, hoping to top it off with a nice sushi dinner with the family. But this ended being just another overpriced Chirashi bowl with a very thin slice of tuna, salmon, yellowtail, one scallop, 3 tiny thin strips of eel and a sprinkle masago roe for $17!!? Seriously,  this was more of an appetizer Chirashi bowl that's valued at $11 maybe $12 at most, that left me wanting something more substantial.  I would've given Silver Rice 3 stars, cuz the fish was fresh, but I just feel that I need to evenly weigh the rest of the overrated reviews here.",2.0
"Delicious! I ordered the spicy tuna cup and the spicy salmon roll. Both had incredible fish. Flavorful, tender, perfectly succulent and fatty. The cup had the tuna with avocado and spicy mayo over some perfectly cooked rice. Perfect fish to rice ratio. And the salmon roll was exploding with salmon, so much that the roll couldn't contain all of it. Bright popping delicious flavors and textures. Far better than other sushi in this price range.",5.0

Think of it being a broken down spicy tuna roll, but twice as filling. The fish completely melts in your mouth!I also enjoyed the edamame, which seemed salted without the actual salt.

Good fresh Japanese food. Randomly went here after looking for a spot to grab a quick bite. I've passed by and even went in this spot before just to check out the interior.

They've also singlehandedly ruined sushi for me because I can't find any other affordable sushi that comes close to matching.

"When I read that two Japanese guys who had been thinking about opening a food joint for years finally opened this place, I was super curious/excited even though we have really great options for sushi with Taro and Gen within walking distance.  We ended up ordering in two chirashi bowls -- the Alaskan (salmon- $13.75) and the FIsherman's Bowl ($15.95) which has several different fish, avocado, eel, eggs, sort of like a tiny sushi combo in a bowl.The food ended up being very Japanese.  The bowls and fish pieces are pretty petite, but everything was perfectly prepared.  We ordered the flax rice and were blown away by how well prepared the rice was.  It's crazy addictive.  I wanted to swim in a vat of that rice eating my way through it.  The fish was super fresh, and the farmer's bowl was delicious.  We made a pact to eat half and then switch, but I secretly ate way more than half, tunneling underneath the sashimi to get more rice.  Let's be honest, a hungry me could easily eat both bowls in one sitting.The food is really spectacular and worth the bit of a splurge.  Next time, I may secretly order a second bowl all for myself.P.S. Look at the hours!  Thinking that since this place is casual, I thought it'd be open for lunch, but I found the guys hard a work making the perfect rice for dinner instead.",5.0

"Excellent rolls for a great price, from $7-12. Each role comes with an ample amount of fish. We loved the basic rolls, spicy tuna, salmon, real crab California, and their specials were delicious. Seating is tight. Service is five stars. Silver Rice is the local go-to sushi place.",4.0
"This place is so good, reasonably priced (for vegetarians) and it is dangerously close to my apartment. They have great vegetarian/vegan options like the Macrobiotic Roll (I have to learn how to make that beet pate because it is too good!!!). The vegetable version of their signature Silver Rice cup is also cheap, delicious, and a great option for a light lunch (great for first-timers). Their lotus root side dish and hijiki salad are also great! Have their hoji hot tea on a chilly night. The service is also very friendly but think twice about sitting inside to eat as the space is very small and can be uncomfortable.",5.0
"What a cool spot.We snagged a table in the heated tented entryway and dove face first into rice cups, rolls and bowls. If you want something filling (not to mention portable) on the cheap, the rice cup is calling your name. Sure, it's mostly rice, but there's a healthy serving of fish on top and boy, is it tasty. If I lived/worked in BK I'd be getting these all the time.Quick, casual, decently priced. Check it out.",4.0
"I'm a huge fan of their spicy salmon cup. The sushi rice is perfect and served at the ideal temperature. The fish is fresh and quite good. At $6.50 for a decent sized lunch? Count me in!The miso ice cream, like everyone says, is amazing. Very much like salted caramel, but lighter and more refreshing.",5.0
"One of the best ice cream deals around, and with two great flavors on our visit -- $6 for many ounces of miso (icier but tastier) and green tea ice creams, with crunchy bits mixed on top for texture.",4.0
"When I read that two Japanese guys who had been thinking about opening a food joint for years finally opened this place, I was super curious/excited even though we have really great options for sushi with Taro and Gen within walking distance.  We ended up ordering in two chirashi bowls -- the Alaskan (salmon- $13.75) and the FIsherman's Bowl ($15.95) which has several different fish, avocado, eel, eggs, sort of like a tiny sushi combo in a bowl.The food ended up being very Japanese.  The bowls and fish pieces are pretty petite, but everything was perfectly prepared.  We ordered the flax rice and were blown away by how well prepared the rice was.  It's crazy addictive.  I wanted to swim in a vat of that rice eating my way through it.  The fish was super fresh, and the farmer's bowl was delicious.  We made a pact to eat half and then switch, but I secretly ate way more than half, tunneling underneath the sashimi to get more rice.  Let's be honest, a hungry me could easily eat both bowls in one sitting.The food is really spectacular and worth the bit of a splurge.  Next time, I may secretly order a second bowl all for myself.P.S. Look at the hours!  Thinking that since this place is casual, I thought it'd be open for lunch, but I found the guys hard a work making the perfect rice for dinner instead.",5.0
"Recently moved to the area and was craving sushi. Silver Rice does not disappoint. Not super fancy, but not gross and cheap. I had their miso soup, spicy tuna cup (AMAZING) and a California roll. I can't wait to go back and try more!",5.0
Shockingly great quality in a small cramped environment. Was turned off by sushi in a cup ? But actually enjoyed the flavor. Would give them a 5 just a lil to cramped to be comfortable. Bathroom wasnt dirty but could be updated. I be back,4.0

So far have only gotten take out and delivery so can't comment on the service but the food is on point. Love that it's a sushi place with well-crafted veggie options.

"Probably one of my favorite parts of living in the neighborhood. Amazing sushi at not very steep prices. If I'm hungry I'll get one of their seafood bowls (so delicious!) or my other favorite is the macrobiotic roll - I've never been much of a fan for vegan sushi but this one is truly delicious. Their spicy tuna roll is also delicious. The cups are pretty cool, but a little weird to eat because the stuff is at top and all the rice is at the bottom and its a pretty narrow cup. Also I highly recommend getting the flaxseed rice - it's just white rice with bits of flaxseed in it and I feel like it makes it even more delicious. The menu isn't huge and most of it is very basic, which I think helps with the quality. They have a great sake selection as well. Service is pretty minimal, you just order and pay at the counter and then they bring out your order. Part of the reason I love going here by myself as well.",5.0

"Love love love Silver Rice. I crave it like every day. Really delicious, fresh fish. The rice cups are really good. Also the Fishermans Bowl. Holy cow. Good prices. Good saki. It's awesome.",5.0
Spicy salmon rice cup and rolls are delicious. However they run out of fish quite early in the evening. In fact call ahead to see what's still fresh and available. They have a card that they begin to cross out as soon as it hits 7pm on a week night. I went around 8:45pm on Weds and they are all out of spicy salmon and yellowtail. The cashier promised they will order more fish. Right now they can't deliver on a three mains on the menu. How can a sushi place run out of salmon?! Sake and beer available.,3.0

Think the spciy salmon you get in a roll, but on top of rice and with a few vegetables on top creates the perfect medley of flavors. I wish I lived nearby, so I can come and stuff my face, every damn day. I'll have to remember to stop by here the next time I'm in the neighborhood and order a few more things on the menu.

It's really hard to come by some mo fawkin quality sushi in nyc unless you got mad bread ya dig. That tuna literally melts in your mouth like your first girl. One thing I don't know how they do is that Macrobiotic Roll. It literally tastes like it's sushi but it's vegetarian or vegan or one of those diets for anal nut cases. All I know is that fish they harvested had a life full of meth and crack cause I am addicted. They even had a california roll with ACTUAL crab. Enough said.Service: Pretty nice and willing to help staff. I was lost on what to order cause it mainly consisted of special rolls and chirashi. The cashier was willing to help.Decor: Simple and well executed. I liked the logo. Well designed. Quite small and cramped though.Would I go back?Ohh yeah.

I'm sad (ashamed,surprised?) to report that I've never had a California roll with real crab before Silver Rice--it's excellent.

"There have been so many new places to eat popping up in Crown Heights recently, and Silver Rice does not disappoint. The fish is fresh, they make their own house Sake, and it's run by Japanese people.

At the end of the day, it's about he quality of the fish and the overall experience. Silver Rice get's it right.",5.0
"Fantastic fresh fish in Crown Heights. The decor was charming and clean, seating available inside and outdoors under string lights, the service friendly. I ordered to-go and one of the chefs walked into the seating area and personally handed me my order!Out of curiosity, I had the hijiki salad, made from hijiki, carrots, and tofu. Later googling told me hijiki was a type of prepared seaweed. The rich sea flavor was unexpectedly good. Definitely recommend it.I also had the salmon kombu, made from salmon, avocado, scallions, celery, and cucumber. The roll doesn't taste like the usual roll one might order, but it was unique and yummy. It has a light flavor. With so many different ingredients, it was hard to get a balanced bite with each. I felt that all the ingredients overpowered the actual salmon, so I wish the roll was made with a thicker slice of it.The food was more expensive than I prefer, given the portion sizes, but I'll be visiting again.",4.0

We shared the nonohana roll (broccoli rabe, cucumbers, egg, pickled daikon- so tasty!) and the salmon kombu roll (salmon, kombu, honey ginger vinaigrette, jalapeño -highly recommend!).

"I have been going to Silver Rice (mostly for take out), 1-2 times per week since they opened. Things I love about Silver Rice include but are not limited to:-Alaskan bowl with ground  flax seed rice. Wow, that fact that they grind up flax seeds to add omega-3's to the rice is simply brilliant. Our body needs this essential alpha-linolenic acid, which means we must eat it in order to get it in our diet.-All of their soups. Miso with fresh crab is my favorite.-Anago roll (the saltwater eel) Anago has a much better flavor then unagi (freshwater eel).-Nanohana roll- the bitterness of the broccoli rabe paired with the crunchy cucumber and picked daikon is simply amazing. What an awesome flavor combination.Ask what the special soups of the day are. You will not go wrong with whichever one you decide to try. I cannot imagine life without Silver Rice.",5.0

Keep in mind we are still in Crown Heights. We had the spicy tuna ( it is spicy. It has the delayed kick. The tuna is rare, fresh, soft and easy going down and the kick hits you mid peristalsis); California roll with real crab ( thank you. Why do California rolls have fake crab?? It's a complete opposite); a house special spicy salmon roll ( the fish roe were the size of pomegranate pieces. The pop in your mouth was very satisfying); and lastly, a crunchy yellowtail ( just enough crunch that you don't feel guilty ordering a crunchy roll. It's sushi after all).All of it was dumb delicious and incredibly  fresh. They make it fresh to order and the service is quick and efficient. Most importantly, the price is right. Four rolls and one house salad came up up 32 dollars. Please stop changing to much Crown Heights.",5.0
"Franklin Avenue has needed a good sushi place for awhile.  When I saw Silver Rice was opening I was hopeful we were finally getting one. Silver Rice is way, way beyond what would have met my wishes for a new sushi place. The sushi is some of the best I've had anywhere in NYC. The rolls are creative (and big), and the fish is very high quality.  The interior design of the place is really cool as well.",5.0
"Way better than your average sushi place. The salmon and tuna cups are a staple of my diet- good, fairly heathy, quick dinner for under $10. Plus the service is great, the food is mostly all gluten free, and they have gluten free soy sauce available. Better for takeout since there's not a lot of seating.",5.0
"I am not an easy 5-star person, but after my fourth visit to silver rice in 4 weeks, I decided it was only right. Franklin ave has been in desperate need of some good sushi, and Silver Rice hits the spot. For what it does Silver Rice does an amazing job. The fish is fresh, the rice is perfect, the takeaway appetizers are tasty. The rice bowls and chirashi bowls are delicious. There are no inside seats, which makes the patio all the more sweet in the summer months. Excited to see where these guys go in the future!",5.0
"I have been going to Silver Rice (mostly for take out), 1-2 times per week since they opened. Things I love about Silver Rice include but are not limited to:-Alaskan bowl with ground  flax seed rice. Wow, that fact that they grind up flax seeds to add omega-3's to the rice is simply brilliant. Our body needs this essential alpha-linolenic acid, which means we must eat it in order to get it in our diet.-All of their soups. Miso with fresh crab is my favorite.-Anago roll (the saltwater eel) Anago has a much better flavor then unagi (freshwater eel).-Nanohana roll- the bitterness of the broccoli rabe paired with the crunchy cucumber and picked daikon is simply amazing. What an awesome flavor combination.Ask what the special soups of the day are. You will not go wrong with whichever one you decide to try. I cannot imagine life without Silver Rice.",5.0
"This is the best sushi I've had in New York. Period. The rice cups are great if you're on the go, and the flax rice tastes like heaven. Everything I've tasted is dreamy, but I'm partial to the spicy tuna and the miso. The owners and people who work there are insanely pleasant. Go here. Treat yoself.",5.0
"Very welcome addition to the neighborhood.A little pricey, but high quality. The more creative rolls e.g. Macro-B, vegan, etc) are great. As are the bowls you can get (Alaska, Farmers, etc). Good soup too! the side salads are small and expensive, but they're a tasty 2 spoonfuls.Friendly service. Reasonably quick. Parting of the emerging Asian food corner -- Bahnmigos next door, Sweet Basil (thai) and J's Wong (standard cheap Chinese )across the street. :)",4.0

"Real Japanese food by real Japanese people. Very cool modern decor with reasonable prices.

It comes in a medium-sized coffee cup, and it's a rice base topped with a generous scoop of salmon or tuna, finished off with a delicious spicy mayo (better than your usual) and some scallion and avocado. The only problem is that the layering combined with the full and narrow cup makes it a bit difficult to get at the rice for even fish/rice distribution. If you're taking it home, it's better to pour it all out into a bowl of sorts. The flaxseed rice is really tasty and basically just gives your standard sushi rice a little pizzaz. The chirashi is okay, but it was mostly rice and not a whole lot of fish. I'd go with two rice cups or a rice cup and a roll over the chirashi.",4.0

I can never eat more than two rolls usually. but after splitting this with my husband I was dying for more!

"The most delicious and authentic sushi I've had in Brooklyn, and I've tried quite a few. I love the flax seed rice option. I could eat that by itself all day. The fisherman bowls are an excellent combination of delicious rice and some of the freshest fish you'll get your sticks on.",5.0
This place is absolutely amaze. I now refuse to eat sushi anywhere else in this area. They are reasonable priced for the very high quality ingredients! They even sell their own fresh green juices that are also delicious.,5.0

"So good !  The rolls are fresh , delicious & a generous size .  The staff is always friendly and informative regarding the menu & ordering suggestions   .

I love their rolls. I mostly get take out and I feel they don't  skimp on the quality just because it's take out.  The rolls are filling and meaty. I really don't like getting sushi anywhere else.,5.0
Wow. Rice cup with sashimi on top. So delicious. One is not enough unless you eat all the rice. The fisherman's bowl was too real for me. It felt like I was eating a bowl of... well... dead fish. But I highly recommend the rice cup of salmon or tuna with the condiments on top.,5.0
"I think I'm addicted.  Been ordering to go from here for the last 4 months.  The macrobiotic roll is heavenly, even though I'm not a vegetarian.  The cashew beet paste in that roll is so creamy and umame, I'm getting hungry just thinking about it.  One weekend, I went right when they opened for brunch, and had the most fantastic spicy salmon roll I've ever had.  The rice must have been freshly cooked, because the consistency of this roll was extra soft and sticky on the outside, contrasting with the chewy seaweed and fish center. I was like, OK *this* is the difference between Japanese-made sushi and all the average sushi counters around the city.  This place has spoiled me.  Friendly owner, cool and chatty people at the register.  Just beware, they aren't open for lunch on weekdays.  It's all the better though because I'd be tempted to spend my leftover $ all the time...",5.0
"Fantastic!!! Got the Sushi cup and a bunch of rolls and some really great beer and sake. The fish was fresh, full of flavor, and perfectly cut. Also, when you get a spicy roll the fish is hand ground and flavorful (not pureed into mush like horrible chains). And most important: THE RICE! THE RICE!! Finally, an affordable Sushi joint that really cares about the quality of rice! It's so flavorful and delicate and it became the star of everything I ate.On top of that it's got a great layout and the guys who work there (actually Japanese!) seem really great and dedicated. Really wish I had a place like this in my neighborhood. Crown Heights is lucky to have Silver Rice.",5.0

"Brilliant scheme. The freshest fish TO GO! The quality of the fish here is, far and away, better than most places we are used to in Brooklyn. But the rice. THE RICE. That is what gets me.

"This is a wonderful little take-out sushi spot. Rare to find a take-out sushi place that has restaurant quality sushi. They make the rolls big here, which makes it unique.

"This place is amazing - the fish is fresh to an unreal degree, the people who run the place are lovely and sweet and and helpful and knowledgeable about everything on the menu, and the atmosphere is simple and refreshing. They have clearly put a lot of thought into the place and it shows. It's not super fast (nor is it 'slow'), but it's charming and tasty and well worth it. No comparison to the back of Pine Tree Grocery (which is fine for Crown Heights sushi, but a sad thing to settle for otherwise) - Silver Rice is really above and beyond in a completely quiet and unpretentious way.",5.0
This place is great when they actually have food but I have now been here twice when they had to stop serving because they were out of sushi rice. This past time was just before 9pm when they aren't supposed to close until 10:30pm. I'm now going to call to make sure they still have rice left before I make the trip there and I suggest you do the same.,2.0
"In actuality, this place deserves 4.5 stars for an overall job well done. The menu was just lovely. I wanted one of each! Initially, judging by the prices, I thought I'd have to order one of each but looking over others' orders, it became clear that this place was not only awesome with adorable staff but it was good value for not so expensive prices! I had the spicy tuna rice bowl and it was divine! Lots of delicious tuna to mix well with the rice. Shared a vegetable roll with flax seed rice and it was so fresh. Also had a side green salad with great miso dressing. I'll definitely be back to try everything else!

"3.5 StarsTl;dr: Great takeout spot on Franklin, albeit a little pricy.There are very few consistent options on Franklin -- thankfully, this has become a mainstay for those evenings on which we think, ""Cooking -- who needs it? Am I right?"" Regrettably, that happens all too often.Of course, the rice part should be emphasized, lest you be lured into thinking that this is high-end sushi, for that is not the case. Not at all. No, in this tiny store (approximately six bar seats available indoors, though there is more seating outside during the warmer months), you will find sushi ranging from the curiously beloved cucumber-avocado roll to spicy tuna rolls. More interesting, however, are the cups/bowls, which incorporate a healthy serving of both rice and toppings (either fish or vegetarian options). The ingredients are always fresh and the Alaskan Bowl, for example, is always served with a liberal helping of salmon sashimi. The one point of contention is the pricing: How is it that a bowl of rice topped with salmon sashimi is $13.75, but a bowl topped with only vegetarian delights runs you $12.95? It doesn't take a scholar wise in the ways of advanced pricing techniques to realize that one of these things is not like the other, but the prices are. Curious indeed. Conclusion: With friendly staff, consistently good fare made with fresh and tasty ingredients, this is a great little spot for a ""healthier""* takeout on Franklin. This is not the best sushi you've had and it's probably not the best rice you've had either, but it serves its purpose and is a welcome addition to Crown Heights.----------------------------*Rice is healthy, right?
