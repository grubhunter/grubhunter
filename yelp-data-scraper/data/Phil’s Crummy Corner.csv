Came here on a Sunday afternoon with my family. I ordered the bake chicken and rice and beans. I also had tostones on the side. Nice mom and pop restaurant. The food was great and so was the service.,5.0
"Let me start by saying, i never give 5 stars. U must blow me away. But this place is probably one of the best Puerto Rican spots I have been to in Brooklyn.FOOD:Amazing, i mean i felt like my little old Puerto Rican grandmom was in the back cooking. I literally had every  traditional dish. Shrimp and pulpo emapandas has so much flavor, as did the beef and the chicken ones were  so juicy. Plaintains, perfectly sweet, tostones fried just right. Yuca fries were very greasy, but i still enjoyed it. Alcapurrias and Pasteles were AMAZING, fresh and filled with Puerto rico, i missed my grandmom with every bite. Everyone  ordered a different entree. The pernil entree with rice and beans, fyi the arroz con gandules is just yummy.. i had the skirt steak and salad, and my Bf the skirt steak and pulpo salad. Our  steak was very good, cooked perfect w/a little bit charred for that extta flavor. He didnt like his pulpo salad, said it was to chewy, but he also expected  it to be warm and grilled, not cold. Two  friends ordered the chicharron de pollo, chicken was juicy and the bistec, steak was so soft, and so many onions, i love that.AMBIANCE:I stepped into Puerto Rico. Music, beers flowing. Along with many older Puerto Ricans there, i knew this place  was authentic. Some of them were loud and drunk, but not rowdy. Hey, we Puerto  Ricans are loud, passionate  people:)  But i hope this place doesn't attract  the rowdy ones. SERVICE:This male Bartender was amazing. Sweet, polite, always smiling. But i felt like he was the bartender and waiter. Even though  there was a female walking around, who was friendly, she didn't know that  she didnt take our order after almost 20 min. The Bartender  came buy and took it. We basically  had to ask her for everything, if we caught her, but along to the rescue came the bartender, he definitely was tipped well.FYI- if you want to order the appetizer of ""puerto rican sampler"", u must ask for it. Its not on the menu. Best part is u get to pick what stuff u want to come on it.  We learned that mistake after we ordered  them separately.",4.0
"Great food and prices! We got the cod cakes (good), maduros (excellent), pernil (amazing) and pork chunks (very good). Everything was authentic, at least compared to our trip to San Juan in October. The service was good, although it wasn't busy when we went. The only downside was our water kinda lasted like a mixed drink, but no big deal. Overall, I highly recommend this place for Puerto Rican food in Carroll Gardens/Red Hook.",4.0
"Food was good and bartender was very friendly and helpful. The ambiance was set very well and the music had me dancing in my seat. I would've given this restaurant a five star review, but it took the waitress twenty minutes after we were seated before we were helped. Our table was helped more by the bartender than by our waitress.",4.0
"Phils crummy corner is the furthest thing from crummy!  The best churrasco in NYC, best service and best atmosphere!",5.0
Pasteles are slamming! I ordered 2 dozen and picked them up curbside. I will be back for drinks and dinner.,5.0
"Came last night for a quick bite, we heard so much about this place and how authentic the food was to Puerto Rico that I had to see what the hype was all about. We were greeted by the owner, I believe her name was Joanna, very sweet woman, she recommend some items on the menu, and made us feel as if we were family. The food was delicious! Especially the Mayo/ketchup which if you ever go to Puerto Rico they give you that with everything!!!! The churassco was so flavorful, and the rice & beans were like my grandmas! They were absolutely correct about being authentic. I love the fact that they treat you as if they know you forever, I've never felt more welcomed in a restaurant before! The best of luck to this family, they have the customer service, and food down packed!",5.0
Super duper friendly and amazingly tasty foo.  Authentic iOS.  Wepa!  This is my second time be I will be back agin!  Atmosphere is relaxed and service I great!,5.0
"This is one of those gems that is really nice to have in your hip pocket.  I found Phil's on Yelp and figured that, at 4.5 stars, it has to be worth the try.  I wasn't really sure what to make of Phil sitting outside at first, but as soon as we sat down and had wonderful hospitality and food - the whole thing was worth it!The prices are phenomenal, the service is attention and everyone is exceptionally friendly.  It almost feels like you are in your momma's kitchen - the portions are just as large, too! Authentic Puerto Rican food with authentic Puerto Rican hospitality.  I can't speak for the crowd in general, but it was pretty tame when I went in there on a Wednesday evening - but I am sure it gets pretty wild on the weekends.This is one of the last places in this part of Brooklyn that hasn't turned into a hipster hangout / poetry slam joint.  I hope it stays that way.",5.0
"The food is amazing  and authentic Latin cuisine for sure  !!!! The restaurant is clean, customer service is on point, it's family friendly (as a mom that's a plus in my book), and you definitely get your money's worth. Will definitely be coming back again",5.0
When you need to have that authentic Puerto Rican food fix this is definitely the place to get it. Very casual and friendly atmosphere. No intimidation......locals are really cool and make you feel right at home. Tonight my husband and I had the alcapurrias made with the choice of beef or crab filling. Next on the menu was the empanadas one with beef and one with lobster.......yummy! Wait can't forget the Bacalaitos too. For the main we shared the churrascos with a nice mixed salad with avocados and some maduros on the side.You can't go wrong here....everything is so delicious!!!! Gotta go and enjoy this food....bye!,5.0
Delicious I enjoyed every bite. my husband loved the flan I brought home... I will be visiting again soon.,5.0
Authentic Puertorican food. This is the place to be if you want some delicious food!  Small and quaint location.,5.0
This place has amazing food. First time and I can honestly say this is one of the best meals I have had in the city. The chef knows what he is doing !! Great atmosphere and service !! I will be back for sure !!,5.0
"Looking for real authentic Puerto Rican food? This is definitely the go to spot. Food is amazing and flavorful. Just like grandma/mom use to make it. Definitely will be back soon. The prices are fair. Honestly if they were a little more, I'd still pay. They're that good. They also have a bar which is also good.",5.0
"Authentic Puerto Rican food .Love this place .Great people,Great service and friendly environment! Love,Love,love",5.0
"Best prices around, for both good beers on tap and good food til late night. In particular the flan and octopus salad are excellent. I also like the lobster empanada when they have it. Always a baseball or basketball game on, hope they have the World Cup this summer, and it is run by a nice family that always have their kids or parents around to help out. The sort of small business to support that you don't see that often.",4.0
I'm not a fan of the crowd of people that hang out here however the food is DELICIOUS! My first time here I was welcomed by the owner & treated like a regular and since it was my birthday I was given 2 drinks on the house & continuous shot-outs from the DJ. If your just going for the food trust me you won't be disappointed but to hang out I think I'll pass (not my type of crowd),4.0
Attended a friends birthday party at this location on a Saturday night and it was a happening rocking fun fun place. The food was outstanding -my compliments to the chef especially the pernil and the arroz con gandules was delicious ! The DJ and the music was off the hook!  I enjoyed the diversity of the crowd and the owners were very responsive to our needs and pleasant to work with.  This is the type of small family-owned business that makes America great!,5.0
The food is so good -so authentic -what a food findBut the atmosphere -the warm family feeling -you walk in a stranger and leave a friend - have been here 5 times once was for a quick midweek birthday celebration-Once they heard it was a Birthday they had someone run  out and buy a delicious cake for the occasion - just like family -,5.0

"Not only do they have brooklyn summer ale on tap in early Arpil, its on sale here- very strange, also a bar in brooklyn showing Baseball on TV- borderline even stranger., thrid, I came in with 2 girls and they didnt get jeered at- just some very polite words in Espanol were exchanged when we walked in.
