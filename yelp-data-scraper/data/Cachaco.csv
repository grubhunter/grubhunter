"After a night of tooooo many drinks, my husband and I woke up with a hankering for some delicious rib sticking kind of breakfast.My husband, braved the sub-arctic temperatures and came home with 2 PropellersO-M-G!!!!!!!!! This is the best bodega that I've ever had the pleasure of eating from.The wrap itself included, egg, cheese, avocado, AND a hash brown.The perfect breakfast, regardless of your night before activities!!!!!",5.0
"Possibly the best bodega in the world.  Any deli that has Tates cookies is an automatic winner in my book.  Such an unassuming little place too.But that sandwich.  The chipotle chicken, red cabbage, onions, tomato, cucumber, and tzatziki sauce on pita bread.  My bf and I could eat that thing all day long, and he wanted another one.  Ughhh craving it even now.I can definitely see this as a place I'd go to every week during the late summer afternoons to get my fix and then wander over to the Wburg bridge afterwards.",5.0
"I am willing to bet this is the best bodega in the entire world. Ever.I am so sad I no longer work in this neighborhood, but you can bet my ass will be riding 20 minutes out of the way just for the perfect sandwich.The propeller is the ultimate breakfast sandwich, and I will forever cherish it's avocadoey hashbrowney cheesey eggy deliciousness. Always.Also, if you're not in the mood for breakfast- the cuban, the falaffel and the chicken tzat are freaking delicious.Note: I saw someone say that this place changed ownership? Please say this isn't true!! I haven't been in for a month or so, but the owners and staff were so incredible!!!",5.0
"I have to stop myself from coming every day to get the Propellor. its very likely, and easily the best sandwich i ever had. I come here with my co-workers and I have never heard anything bad about any of the other sandwiches as well. Falafals are good too. Tons of drink and snack options. The guys who work there are so incredibly kind and lovely as well and after coming in twice they knew what i wanted (this is not something that happens often, especially in NY)'Could probably talk about how much i love this place for the next 4 pages so ill just stop now.",5.0
"My friend and I stopped in here for a late lunch before heading to go record shopping and oh man the sandwich I got was so good that I'm adding this place to my regular rotation even though I don't usually end up on this end of Greenpoint. I was pretty starving so I ordered a large Cuban sandwich while my friend got a small Tzat Chipotle Chicken. A guy entered right after I ordered and asked for a Stuffed Knish, which had me nearly regretting my decision but I'm so glad I stuck with the Cuban. The carnitas are amazing!! They are definitely made fresh with some care and love. They were so tender, juicy, and deliciously pork-y. My sandwich came with Swiss cheese so perfectly melted that long strings appeared when I pulled apart the two halves. Truthfully, I'm not even a big fan of pickles or mustard, but the flavors melded perfectly with the Swiss and carnitas, with just the perfect amount of acidity to cut through the hearty meat. The sandwiches do take some time to make so be prepared for a little wait, but boy is it worth it! I was pretty stuffed after eating a little over half so I saved the leftovers for later. Even two days after, the sandwich was every bit as good as I remembered and enough to fill me up for a second lunch. I tried a bite of my friend's Tzat Chipotle Chicken and I remember it being pretty good, but more on the ""fresh/light"" side than my hearty one (which was definitely perfect for my craving since I had been starving). Even fresh sandwiches, etc aside, the chips/drinks/condiments here are clearly well-curated to fit a hip, young Brooklyn crowd. (As is the cute chalkboard menu). My only wish is that there would be a bodega as good as this near Columbia.",4.0
"Is this the best bodega food in New York? It's definitely the best bodega food that doesn't serve a ""classic"" Mexican menu alongside bottles of seltzer and Tylenol. Mexican and deli food is the jumping off point here, and make no mistake, you can get sliced meat sandwiches and tacos here. But the operators of this place have taken the basic ingredients into some unexpectedly, global inflected places. There's The Austrian, which is a chicken cutlet, pickles, mayo and ketchup and a chipotle chicken sandwich with tzatziki, cabbage, cucumbers, tomato and red onion.Frequent specials are even stranger, making liberal use of the fryer and bringing in Asian, African and Latin American flavors to wraps and sandwiches. It's still a deli so there's just a counter to eat, but it's very satisfying to eat something at a bodega that's made there and actually tastes good. Frankly, I didn't even know this was possible.",5.0
"I've been coming here for a few years now, mainly for breakfast but sometimes lunch. Even though the owners keep changing, the cook has remained the same, which is why I continue to come back.Nothing beats their fresh Colombian coffee. I also love to order a slightly toasted roll with a hint of butter, red onions, melted mozzarella cheese, topped with avocado slices. Yum! I gave them a four star because there has been several occasions where something as simple as a toasted cream cheese and jelly bagel has been messed up, or has taken twenty minutes to make. Otherwise, I have no complaints. Did I mention they have really decent Colombian coffee?",4.0
"When I saw Cachaco had five stars, I knew that I had to check it out. I have very high expectations for a place with five stars, and I walked in expecting to have a five star experience. We stopped in a Monday evening, and there was one person waiting and another ordering before us. They seem to be inundated with phone orders, which prevents them from serving walking in customers in a timely fashion. I decided on the chipotle chicken in a pita, and he got the buffalo chicken on a hero. His sandwich was huge and looked really tasty. My pita was a mushy mess. It was good, but did not meet my very high expectations. I also don't like tzatziki sauce that much, and it was doused in it. We ended up waiting almost half an hour for our two sandwiches, which I thought was way too long for a corner deli. I may be back because they do seem to have a following, so it must be good, but my experience just didn't live up to the expectations.",3.0
i have not been paid yet from this place. i am still waiting for my pay money. all the original crew has quit. now he has all new people. this guy alex the owner is financially struggling and he is not paying any of his employees. i've made a report with department of labor and i'm waiting for the response.,1.0
GREAT DELI!!!Love the bagel and jam that i had here!!! My friend lives very close by so she put me onto this place and I'm glad. The bagels are fresh not like most places in GP.,3.0
"The Tzat chipotle chicken sandwich is a must try! Super cheap for the quality ($6.50 including taxes). I did not expect the sandwich to be that good. After taking one bite, I just fell in love with it. I ordered the ""small"" portion, but it is enough for lunch/dinner. The staff is really nice too. I will definitely go back again for a quick bite.",4.0
"How many places will make you Tacos de Carnitas for breakfast at 9am? Based on how few ppl will actually eat them for breakfast, you can bet it's not many!  But, I'm that guy who goes above and beyond for my first meal of the day in order to make a celebration of my having woken up once again! Because it wasn't that busy at that moment, they made me carnitas, 3 tacos, and they were completely authentic, y que ricos. Yumi!It's a small place designed for take-out, with only 3 seats at a small counter by the window, and those seats are right next to the door (which kind of sucks when it's cold out, but is better than no seats at all). Just beware that you're not really heading to a ""restaurant"" when you visit Cachaco.  Good stuff, though. I would return.",4.0
"Welp -- the time has come for my update. The original owner sold it and the place hasn't been the same since. The cooks stayed the same, and for that I am eternally grateful (much love to the morning dude). However, the new owner does NOT go to the same bakery for the Colombian pastries and they're disgusting. The arepas are inedible. You can tell because they are always available now, whereas before, they would sell out before 11am. The buñuelos are also pretty bad now. When I addressed this issue with the new owner, he said the original bakery was too far for him to travel to in the morning. He also lied to me and told me the pastries were fresh, but they were consistently hard, which leads me to believe he buys in bulk once or twice a week and fills the case with old pastries all week.",2.0
"This place is an absolute staple for me. Way better quality and slightly more interesting offerings than your typical Brooklyn corner deli. The carnitas tacos, spicy eggplant spread and house-made hummus are all delicious and not items I'd usually order at a bodega. They crank out solid egg sandwiches and coffee is way better than expected for the price ($1 for a small), so breakfast is probably the best meal here.The level of service does seem to have dropped off slightly since recent change in ownership, but cooks are still incredibly quick and I've never waited more than 5 minutes for food.",4.0
"New owners..... Extremely not customer focused, unfriendly and overall poor attitudes. Sorry it was sold now i must find a new deli.",2.0
The people are some of the friendliest people you will ever meet. I have never had a dispute that was not handled appropriately and I greatly appreciate that. The food is something I have come to dreaming about. I may be biased because I live close but I will eat here all the time! The chicken tacos are fantastic and flavorful a and cheap. They have small treats like grape leaves that are health conscience decisions. My all time favorite food here is the Huron hero. I have never had such a flavorful sandwich. Give these kind people all your money.,5.0
This place is so fire. The chipotle chicken with tzatziki is life changing. For sure my favorite sandwich on this planet.,5.0
"They are not speed demons by any means, and tend to get a little stacked up at lunch time (calling your order in can help with this), but, they are easily the best deli sandwich joint in the neighborhood. Each and every sandwich on the menu is really, really good, with great/fresh ingredients, unique composition and generous portions. I hope they never change a thing.",4.0
"The tuna melt here is bangin.  Oddly, sometimes they charge me $4.00 for my melt and sometimes they charge me $5.00. Either way, it's a great price and I happily pay whatever the cashier asks me to. She's very friendly, and I'm their slave.",5.0
"Cachaco looks like any other sandwichy bodega, but these sandwiches would easily hold their own in a Best Sandwiches of Greenpoint competition (or even North Brooklyn). The Huron Hero is a titan.

The Italian sub I had was loaded with cold cuts. The Tzatziki Chipotle Chicken is awesome. The Double Agent (warm roast beef, melted cheese, Russian dressing, pickled jalapenos) has probably been the most flavorful--a nice twist on a steak and cheese sorta thing.Would recommend to anyone who doesn't feel like cooking, but doesn't want to go out and pay the ridiculous prices at a lot of Brooklyn eateries.",4.0
