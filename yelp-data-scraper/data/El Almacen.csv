"A generous 4 stars... Closer to 3.5...Ambiance/vibe - 5 stars, loved the rustic inside, great for cool trendy dinner. Food - 3.5-4 stars...the menu didn't offer a huge variety between small appetizer to full on steak plate. We ordered the fish tacos and special pasta (seafood, tomato sauce, spaghetti) to share with avocado fries to start. Seafood was fresh, avocado fries were pretty good... Dipping sauce was salty. The fish tacos were great! Definitely recommend. Service - 3 stars, while very kind and sweet... they did give us a 30 min estimate and ended up calling us for our table about 1.5 hours later.. And the waitress, as my bae so lovingly put it thought she was ""on drugs"". Happy drugs though... Like the kind that makes you smile and move slow... Overall our dinner took about 1.5 hours (slow to come out for entree portion)... However, would recommend as a place to try if you ever escape the island.",4.0
"This is my second and last time at this restaurant.There are other places with good steaks and much better service. Service is just horrible and rude.My order was 1 guacamole which came right away, and 4 steaks which came 45 min. after... and the place wasn't busy for Sat night 7:00. Waitress standing and chatting to each other without paying attention to the table, asked the bussboy to call  for the waitress. For my question ""we waiting over 30 min for main course, how long?"" the answer was ""in any minute"" it took approximately another 15-17 min for food to come... But when we asked for  the bill,it  came faster then Flash Gordon.Good food doesn't justify poor service!",3.0
"Pros: the chicken, the churros, the atmosphere, the vibe, the waitstaff and bussers, the parking Cons: the wait time for a table w/o reservations, even with reservations can't get seated earlier and no room at the bar so had to hang out somewhere else two blocks away, the wait time for food (over 45 min) Overall: will be coming back!!!!!",4.0
"TL;DR - Excellent service, delicious food, and a charismatic interior.A friend and I dined here on a Saturday afternoon after biking over Williamsburg Bridge.  We walked in with ravenous appetites and left extremely satisfied.  To the Yelper we met at the Citi Bike station--thank you for this recommendation!  Let's be best friends.Food - I ordered the 10 oz skirt steak with poblano puree.  The steak was high-quality, grass-fed beef and was cooked perfectly.  The steak was extremely tender and red in all the right places.  I dunked each bite into the accompanying sauces, both of which were delicious (chimichurri and another peppery sauce).  The poblano puree had a deep flavor and the consistency of mashed potatoes.Service - Our waitress was extremely knowledgeable about every item on the menu and answered our litany of questions with patience and authority.  Our waters were consistently refilled and the food came out promptly.Ambiance - The interior feels like a divey house/bar.  Shabby chic done right...it's Brooklyn, after all.Price - I would not describe this place as cheap, but I would say that it is worth the price.Five stars and I would definitely come back.",5.0
"Came here after a day at the BB. Walked in and out of so many places that could not accommodate a group of 6 for another 1-2hours. SO glad we stumbled upon this place! Great food & service!I had the Aji Relleno and shared guac & chips. My friends had the Pulpo y Rusa, Empanadas, Tacos de Costilla and Tacos de Pescado. EVERYONE WAS SO HAPPY. I can personally recommend the Aji Relleno and say that it can easily be shared! ITS HUGE (see Pic). I've had many similar dishes and this is easy top 3. It was very well done! The Aji was crisp and the inside was mushy delicious cheesy goodness! Im not usually a betting person, but I believe the other reviewers who claim the steaks truly resemble an authentic Argentinian dish. OHHHHH & the red sangria looked AMAZING, I regret not ordering it. Don't make the same mistake!",4.0
AMAZING PLACE EVER this place is a foodies dream they are amazing beyond words the paiya is brilliant and the ambiance is with out question really cool for lovely evening out its def a place that I recommend and the sangria was great complimenting everything just right .,5.0
"Had the parillada with my boyfriend on Easter, sangria and coffee.Parillada was good and cooked exactly the way I requested. The sangria was on the dry side which is better than overly sweet versions you get everywhere else. The coffee was strong the way I like it. Service was good, I just wish the two tops were a bit larger because between the pitcher and the parillada we barely had space for our silverware. All in a good experience but I would rather come back with a group to get a larger table.",4.0
This place used to be so great. Now it's barely 1/3 full for Saturday brunch. A great place to go if you want to wait a mysteriously long time for rare steak while watching Argentinean waitresses socialize with each other and ignore your table for 30 minute stretches at a time.And the guacamole is flavorless with barely a pinch of cilantro and ridiculously priced at $9 for a tiny cup!,3.0
This place was great. I ordered a skirt steak which was so juicy. At the time I went it was BYOB. I don't know if it still is.,4.0
"Mediocre food and mediocre service. Got avocado fries, ribeye steak and the fish of the day (pollock)--and 2 bottles of wine. The steak was decent, but the fries were stale. The pollock was overcooked. Everything just seemed to lack seasoning and heart. The space itself has potential to be a great space, but it's disjointed from the front room tables and the back room tables. The ambiance was dark and rustic... and we sat in the back closer to the garden outside, but there was no getting in or out of your seat without making everyone at the table stand up to shuffle. And then the waitress couldn't give more of a sarcastic and forced smile whenever she came around. I guess the upside is... At least she tried.If you're looking for similar, go to Tabaré which I think is much better.",3.0

"We waited for over an hour and a half for a table for three. Thankfully we had a nice seat at the bar with good drinks and a kooky bartender. That was the highlight. The food was nothing to write home about; steak tacos came with two, fatty meat and lots of onions and two slithers of avocado. The drinks and food took forever to be served and every time we asked for an update , the hostess have is a tude. At the end of the day , we waited for two hours to eat octopus and potatoes. The place is cozy, but that's about it. They are successful because they're in a cool area. I wouldn't come back here.",2.0
"My favorite meat place in the city, and probably in my Top 5 of the world, I discovered through a friend and now I go there once a month. Food is delicious, service is friendly and quick and the environment is rustic but classy. Every person I've taken there LOVED it. My only complaint would be the price (it's kind of expensive) but since I have such a great time every time I go, I don't mind paying.",5.0
"I love El Almacen, the best steak ever! I always have a great time here! My favorite is the skirt steak and the truffle fries which are soo yummy!

We sometime wait for more than 30min after 7pm, but worth the wait!",5.0
"Skirt Steak had great flavour and the chimichurri sauce was great, The corn was grilled and liked the creamy sauce on top, palm heart salad had lots of truffle oil sauce on it so depending if you like the taste of truffle or not, it was pretty good, the guacamole was a good portion and fresh but they could've given more chips with it, the calamari was okay and we liked the fried plantains included. The churros came with a chocolate and a dulce de leche sauce. The Dulce was great but the chocolate was just so-so. The Churros were a bit undercooked in the middle so they could've been better. We came for dinner a bit early, 5:45pm but it was perfect as there were just a few other tables filled in the restaurant. By the time we left, it was a bit harder to get the waitress' attention. Overall pretty good food but a few small misses.",3.0
"I have found my Go-To Spot for Anniversaries, Birthdays or just a romantic night out!I found El Almacen on yelp a few months ago. So far i have been to this lovely establishment 2x. Each time I received amazing service. Its an adorable nook with antique decor, including chairs mounted on the ceiling. I've had appetizers, entree and dessert each time. Let me break it down:Appetizer:   - Pulpo y Rusa - grilled octopus with potato salad - great flavor!!! I am not a seafood lover but this was delicious. the texture was firm with beautiful grill marks.    - Guacamole - yummy! i've had a lot of guacamole which requires extra salt, but not this one.Entree:   - Entrana - skirt steak with poblano mash - my absolute favorite!!! The steak is strategically seared and the mash is to die for.    - Churrasco - rib eye with truffle fries - delicious alternative to the entrana.Dessert:   - Flan - texture is firm but not too firm with a sweet glaze.   - Churros - i asked for no chocolate sauce b/c i'm allergic but the dulce de leche is divine.Drinks:   - Sangria - its good but not the best i've had. it appears its made on the spot so the fruits do not infuse the alcohol.Overall, I love this restaurant! If you are in Williamsburg, I suggest you pass by.  They have outdoor seating, but both times its been closed due to weather.",5.0
"We came here for a casual Sunday lunch with my best friend. Let me start with the positive, the food was amazing every single dish looked and tasted great. We had the entraña and the octopus potato salad and both were delicious. The steak was really tender and cooked to perfection and my girl friend loved the purée side dish . As a dessert we had dulce de leche crepe. It looked amazing but one side was a little burned and there were too much filing inside (not really a French crepe). I wouldn't order it again. The place decor is very ""woody"" and a little dark, but it goes well with the Argentinian menu. The service was mitigated. Some waiters really enjoy working while others not so much and it shows. Overall I would definitively come back to try other dishes and for the entraña!",4.0
"Disappointed once again! Argentinian but not even close. Why? Because the milanesa was dry, they didn't know how to do a fried egg! (Say what?) Yes, the brought a second egg and guess what... drier than the first one. The panqueques which are Argentinian pancakes more like a crepe with Dulce de leche was very far from an average not to say poor pancake, so awful, yes...The people there don't know how to serve nor how to cook or run a restaurant. It doesn't surprise me that they are the same owners of rip off Shelter and rip off number 2 Rosarito. What is it with these guys that they think they cook awesome food and put it closer to a 3 figure number in the menu?

The food, wholesome, rich and tasty. We got the special Provolete and Pulpo, both perfectly prepared and savory. The main courses were stacked with flavor : crab meat pasta and gnocchi .

"First, I'd like to start by saying that there was a michelin star sticker on the door of this restaurant that I noticed. (I've been here twice, it escaped by notice the first time.)I've gotten the Parrillada ($54) twice now, as well as the steak empanadas (choose 2 types of empanadas for $10), and the churros (4 piping-hot sticks and two dips for $8). I also had a bottle of Finca Pedernal Malbec (2008) ($46). Parrillada: It was essentially about five different types of meat/sausage, each type was enough for two servings. There is one blood sausage to share, one chorizo to share, two slabs of sweetmeats, one length (approx 6 bones) of short rib, one giant rib eye on the very bottom, and a side of fries and roasted peppers. There's also a small pile of salt and two different types of, I guess the closest word I can think of is ""salsas""?All of this for $54 (it was enough to make both me and my boyfriend very full) was a steal, I think. Also, when we first ordered it, we asked for it medium rare, it was a bit too raw, actually. (I typically ask for medium rare for any steak and was never really disappointed.) So, this time we asked for it medium and it was perfect. Not too bloody, and the waitress' recommendation for the finca pedernal malbec was amazing. A hint of frutiness and full bodied. The empanadas are amazing as well; very delicious and the eggs were fluffy inside! I was very impressed.Do NOT skip on the dessert here. The table next to ours got the crepe, which looked amazing. We ended up ordering the churros which was probably the best churros I've ever had in my life. Maybe even the best dessert; which is amazing for me to say, since I have a HUGE sweet tooth. It came with a dark chocolate and dulce de leche sauce to dip, in a tiny cute basket, and the churros were four sticks covered in sugar and very hot. It was just amazing, I can't say enough about it.I also want to point out that this is a no-frills place, so you don't have to go above and beyond your way to dress up. Cocktails also seem to be a real hit here. And a lot of their food is underseasoned; but as a person who tries to get as much home-cooking when I can, I really appreciate it. By not bombarding your taste buds with saltiness, you get to appreciate the actual taste of MEAT. whoo, who would've guessed? I definitely recommend coming here for any sort of occasion, or even for just the churros!",5.0

My brother's skirtsteak and mash were impressively different and delicious (I usually don't enjoy steak). Overall, way way way too good to not come back!

There's plenty of mediocre and a lot of bad, but stellar places are few and far between. This place is one of the few.Beautiful decor, a great outside patio, and terrific food. We ordered the Avocado fries to start. Different, fun, and tasty. I also got the steak served with poblano Mashed Potatoes. It was the best thing I've had in a long time. Nice presentation and unbelievably amazing taste. When I first saw the dish I thought, ""ah that's a small piece of steak."" But as I ate I quickly realized it was the perfect size and incredibly filling when pair with the poblano mash. Thank you for a great dinner and a new favorite restaurant. I will be back with family members and friends in tow.",5.0

The only complaint was my dads, about portion size, but thats more about him being a glutton than there not being enough food. Very reasonable prices for the quality you get, i think.",5.0

"Gave this place a try the other day with my wife. It's not often that you come across a really incredible restaurant in NY. There's plenty of mediocre and a lot of bad, but stellar places are few and far between. This place is one of the few.Beautiful decor, a great outside patio, and terrific food. We ordered the Avocado fries to start. Different, fun, and tasty. I also got the steak served with poblano Mashed Potatoes. It was the best thing I've had in a long time. Nice presentation and unbelievably amazing taste. When I first saw the dish I thought, ""ah that's a small piece of steak."" But as I ate I quickly realized it was the perfect size and incredibly filling when pair with the poblano mash. Thank you for a great dinner and a new favorite restaurant. I will be back with family members and friends in tow.",5.0
"Great entree choices, the Sangria is great but pricey. Have had the ribeye on three occasions, need to experiment with the menu on the next visit. The truffle fries are addictive. El Almacen is small and seating is tight so you need to be respectful and patient with your fellow diners. Keep your elbows tucked in.",4.0

"""Best steak in Brooklyn!!""Amazing steak was referred here by a friend 5 years ago, steak is always perfect and delicious, this is my favorite place when in the mood for meat, sides are delicious and always fresh. Only negative is that table can be very close to each other and is uncomfortable if you go late, I learned my lesson and always go late in the afternoon were restaurant is quiet and I can enjoyed",4.0
"Love this place! Me and a few friends winged it and came her and boy we were not disappointed! Cute place with a nice calm ambiance. Let's talk about the food that's most important.....Everything we ordered was great. For appetizers we did the tacos, calamari, and guacomole. Yummy! Entrees we had the 10 Oz Skirt steak deliciously seasoned and cooked just right. Rib eye was spot on and they're was another meal that was big enough for 3 ppl had an assortment of meats all tasty. Would definitely come to this place again.",4.0
What a gem! We went here for dinner and were pleasantly surprised. Super romantic atmosphere. We split a bottle of wine and shared the steak. Would def recommend for a Brooklyn date!,5.0
Fried avocados = amaze balls.!  Fish tacos are a must have at this place. Atmosphere  was great.  Staff was great.  I would definitely come here again!,5.0
"From the outside looking in, El Almacen looks like a pretty intimate, well-rounded restaurant. While the decor is rustic, the food is good and the mood and ambiance are pretty comfortable, I do have to say that the organization and service are definitely lacking. I would say 3.5 stars, but I'm rounding down due to the rudeness of the waitstaff. Also, the disorganized way they take down reservations HAS to change. Get OpenTable, son.We entered with our group of 4 and there were about 3-4 empty 4-seater tables, yet the hostess told us to wait a moment for our table to be ready. We were slightly puzzled, but waited anyways. For another 10 minutes, we were getting a little impatient, and the hostess seemed pretty indifferent to our impatience. We were finally seated, but right by the bar, where the bar ledge cut into the seating space and it was kinda uncomfortable. Seeing other tables open, we asked if we could switch to another table, but our hostess was pretty unaccomodating and refused to move is, so we remained in uncomfortable silence. We refused to let it ruin our night. So we just ordered a few drinks and let our conversation lighten the mood. Also, our waitress was pretty good about getting us drinks, but failed to check up on us for things like water and extra seasonings and condiments.Despite all the unfortunate events, the food was good, yet also not well priced. We decided to get a bunch of small plates and a couple mains. Short rib tacos were pretty great, but very small and you only get 2 for $9. Grilled octopus was the same situation, delicious but bout the size of sashimi for $15. Avocado fries were pretty interesting and was actually a bit more reasonably priced at $6. Choclos (corn on the cob) were very well done, but the cheese was a bit too sharp for my tastes. The churrasco was actually a good portion of ribeye steak, and the truffle fries were perfectly cooked and seasoned.I would recommend coming here on a weekday night. It seems that when it's crowded, the staff can't adequately or flexibly accommodate customers correctly. However, if you can look past that, it's a solid place for some well-cooked food. That being said, there are many other places in Williamsburg that have good food/ambiance AND good service, so this place not might be worth frequenting.",3.0
"One of the best South American I've been to! The empanadas are absolutely delicious, and the entrees are also well done. It's busy inside and seems like quite a hip spot, but service is good and effective. Very nice for a first date or an intimate dinner with someone. I would go back!",4.0
"The entrana was to die for, although when I said medium well it was cooked more like medium. the sangria was fine not the best nor was it the worst. for appetizer we had empanada which was so good my favorite was the onion and cheese empanada!!overall I would recommend people to try this place!!",4.0
"El pulpo, empanadas were good as appetizers. Although the ceviche was tasty do not expect your traditional one in a tostada. Both the churrasco and entrana  I would highly recommend",4.0
"A cramp quaint place was my first impression of El Almacen. This Argentinian restaurant had a colonial American feel to it as the interior was mostly wood and iron. I believe that the bar had an old typewriter on the corner of it too. The restaurant was already packed and it was only a little bit after 6:00 p.m on a Saturday. Could this be a result of overpriced Manhattan restaurants?Although El Almacen was located in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, it had the tight seating arrangements of Manhattan establishments. Oh well, at least the waitress was nice enough to let us take a reserved table for four, given that we finish our meal in 45 minutes. It was safe to say it took over an hour (because of dessert).Anyways, I didn't really look at the menu as my dining mates chose the dishes to share family style. I didn't really care what we ate either. Because we were in a rush to get our food, we placed our order within 5 minutes of being seating. The main dishes were as followed: Avocado fries, brussel sprouts, Ceviche de Hamachi, Aji Relleno, Pulpo Y Rusa, Morcilla, Dry Aged Porter House, and Entrana. Without looking at the menu, I believe that these were the main courses we feasted upon that night. All our food was accompanied by some bomb wine, which I didn't inquire as to what it was called. I don't really enjoy alcohol of any kind, but this wine paired well with our food.The first dish to arrive was the Ceviche de Hamachi. It was Hamachi (fish), seasoned with yuzu flavoring, shishito peppers, sea salt and truffle oil. Fish was fresh and seasoning was great, but I'm not sure where this fit along with the Argentine theme. Oh well, as long as it's good that's all I care about!Next was the Puplo Y Rusa, a grilled octopus placed on top of potato salad. Another solid dish thus far. The octopus was different from the Japanese style I usually eat, but it was interesting nonetheless. I would have to say compared to Japanese style octopus dishes, this one was meatier and less chewy. I believe this is mainly attributable to the different octopus used and cooking style.I like peppers used to flavor my foods, but I'm not a fan of pepper based dishes. This being said, I was reluctant on eating the Aji Relleno, a stuffed pepper dish, but as a foodie, you have to try it all at least once. I would have to say this was probably the best dish of the night. It did not taste like Chipotle, but it reminded me of it for some reason. It must be because the pepper was stuffed with spinach, cheese, corn, rice, and black beans. The end result was a burst of deliciousness in your mouth! I would say this is a must order as I haven't tasted anything quite like this before. Also, the pepper they grilled and used was huge!Probably more interesting than good tasting, the avocado fries are exactly as the name implies. Avocado fries. Pretty much just a thick slice of avocado deep-fried. Not sure if I would order this at any restaurant again. Interesting though however.This may have been my first time eating brussel sprouts. Not sure what to say about this other than it was a vegetable lol. I suppose it was good grilled with the cheese sprinkled on top.What was supposed to be the best part of this meal was actually the worst in my opinion. My dining mates did not share the same opinion, but I felt that most of the meat was nothing to rave home about. The porter house was properly cooked medium rare, but I just didn't really enjoy any flavor that it had. It had some juices, but it wasn't what you would imagine a juicy steak to taste like. The skirt steak was a bit better, but yet again, not up to par with expectations. Surprisingly enough, the best thing on that platter was the green potato salad that everyone mistook for guacamole. The Morcilla (blood sausage) was something different, but I think I'd prefer regular sausage over that. I wouldn't be against trying blood sausage again somewhere else though. I should also include that I think upon reviewing the pictures and my memory, there was a short rib and possibly rib eye in there too. I prefer the korean style of short rib and this one was a big disappointment to me. The rib eye might have been number two next to the skirt steak due to it being slightly more juicy than the porter houseTo celebrate my cousin's birthday we had to get some dessert, although it wasn't really a birthday style dessert. Our choices were churros and flan. The flan was my preferred of the two, although both were sweet and tasteful. I generally just like fruit, which is probably why the flan came out on top.

"Went here with a few friends last night after hearing rave reviews. We made reservations and were seated immediately. It had a really nice and relaxed atmosphere, so it seemed like a great place for a date. Apparently in the warmer months it has a beautiful back patio for dining also.I sampled a few of the steaks because I'm the kind of friend who likes to eat other peoples foods. The steaks I tried had were decent but not phenomenal. Maybe the place had been talked up too much that my expectations were shattered. The cocktails were also good but phenomenal.The real prize came with dessert. I ordered panqueque, which was mind blowing and after a few bites of my friends chocolate cake, I decided to order one also. Did the cocktails/wine cloud my judgement and make me fall in love with the desserts? It's possible. Regardless, they definitely left a good impression and I'll probably go back and order something other than the steaks so I can have some more of those desserts.",4.0
"This restaurant's around the corner from my home, and they have the best steak choices ever. We had skirt steak, rib eye, and other one that was $36 (with the bone). They were all really good, but skirt steak had the smallest portion of all ( doesn't mean it's small, but compared to other two which where HUGE). Rib eye was juicy, but a bit greasy. The one with the bone was really good and worth the money. We also had avocado fries--pretty good, but literally fried avocados. Personally wasn't so thrilled about it but my friends liked it. Will definitely come back whenever I want",5.0

The appetizers came in a timely manner. Which is good, because when food comes out too early I am concerned . The entries came out and we were very excited. Then we started to devour the food. My sister had told me the aji rellao was good - not great but only because she had had it the past two nights in a row.  However, my dad said that his food was a phenomenon of flavour. I replied and said the huevos rancheros werr also great. At this point we were full but we were not done. If there is a God, then he must have been the one who made this french toast. TRUST ME WHEN I SAY WE ARE COMING BACK.",5.0
Seriously overrated! 4 stars for this place? I hail from cow state and we have better Latin American food than this establishment.  People in Brooklyn must have different expectations. I guess the concept of garden dining automatically makes an establishment trendy. For starters the place was way too hot and dark. I guess it's supposed to be romantic but I just can't imagine staring into the eyes of my beloved with sweat dripping down the side of my face. Definitely not a fan. I'm not used to restaurants that don't have AC. I'm from an area where dining areas are equipped with AC or mist systems. Services was okay. I was with a group and there was a baby there with us. Service wasn't that at tentative.  The menu was a lengthy menu. To be honest way too long!!  I don't think anything really jumped out at me. I ordered the organic chicken because I don't normally buy chicken myself. My meal was decent but not amazing. Others got steak and fish. I dabbled at their meals and won't be running back anytime soon to have dinner here.,3.0

"Five stars to a five star steak I had at El Almacen in late December. It's a small, very dark restaurant on Driggs Avenue. I recommend making a reservation, no matter they say on the phone. I called the restaurant and wanted to make a reservation for two, but they said it's not necessary. However, when we arrived to the restaurant it was full, over the top full. We were asked to wait for an hour and first we though we'd find somewhere else to have dinner, but we saw a plate with a delicious looking steak and returned to the restaurant the steak in our minds and finally got a table after a 15 minute or so wait. The food was excellent, but the service was very very slow. Be aware of that on a busy night if you are hungry. Luckily the grilled veggies and steak were EXCELLENT. They also have good cocktails, I recommend trying the Pimms one.",5.0

I came for a friend's goodbye dinner as she wanted to have a last chance to eat steak in the US, and El Almacen was her place of choice. Pros:-Loved the dark wood/ rustic decor and friendly servers -Must haves are the churrasco and parrillada dishes!! The churrascco was especially delicious-Drinks are solid here, ordered the michelada which was goodCons:-Too dark! The only con is that the lighting here is too dark and a little over the top. Throughout the night I wasn't too sure what I was going to be eating until I tasted the food - the lighting can definitely be brighter.",4.0
Heard great reviews about this cute little restaurant so I decided to try it out. It wasn't a super busy night so we were seated immediately. I have to admit the decor seemed a little bit ran down but the food made up for it.Things we ordered -That rib eye steak...That steak was big enough to feed a family of four. It was cooked to perfection (medium rare as I requested). Avocado fries!! There needs to be more fried avocados in the world.Seared cod - really fresh and flavorful.Didn't see anything I wanted off the dessert menu but the wine selection was great.,4.0
El Almacen is a charming little restaurant in Brooklyn with a really cool courtyard. I was here for brunch and enjoyed a very satisfactory meal in their enclosed outdoor courtyard with low hanging trees and sunlight. The servers were all very nice though it did take about 20 minutes to get our food. The hanger steak and 2 eggs was delicious. It also came with home fries and a mini salad. The sangria was generous (full glass) and tasty. Great place to come for a intimidate sunday date :),4.0
"Came here to celebrate the boyfriend's promotion based on the 300+ yelp reviews. First the positive...the food was incredible. We had the empanandas, 10oz and 18 oz steaks with truffle fries and if I wasn't afraid of getting a splinter on my tongue I would have licked the board clean. The ambiance is rustic and romantic or at least it would had been had it not been for these annoying little factors that diminished it from a 4 star rating to 2...1. Our table was unbalanced and shaky. The host, a waiter and my bf all tried to stabilize it so that our drinks wont go sliding off.2. the tables were so closely joined together it might as well been a family style setting. not to mention when the waitress was taking the next tables orders, her ass was literally on my head 3. it was extremely LOUD. in order to have a decent conversation we had to talk above the 4 drunk men (i'll get to them in a second) sitting next to us and the high pitched woman who made my ears bleed with her shrilling and cackling the entire night4. we got there at 10 pm put our app and entree order in...did not get our app until 1/2 hr later and the only reason I think we got our meal is because I had to flag our waitress down twice and asked her to check on our order...meanwhile, the 4 drunk men that came stumbling (literally) to the table next to us got their 3 bottles of wine, 4 different orders of appetizers and their steaks all before we got our appetizerswhat was meant to be a romantic celebration turned out to be a frustrating dining experience with me trying to distract my bf from all the annoying factors listed above so that he can enjoy his meal. I would love to come back here at a time when it's not crowded so that we can actually enjoy the atmosphere and the food without an ass in my face or a drunk guy stepping on my food to squeeze into his table.",2.0
"Big fan of this (new to me) spot in Williamsburg.  Inside of a house-like space that is cozy and warm, there is a great staff and lots of good drinks/food.  We had a beautiful full Argentinian wine (Reservas Terrazas?) which was great and reasonably priced, and then we avoided having the main meat-course.Instead we opted to share mostly everything else, which worked great in terms of a full meal and also in terms of having tasty food on our table for ages.  New dishes kept coming out and there wasn't pressure for us to hurry out.I think we didn't have a rez but there was no wait on a thursday night in mid-Fall.For three guys, two bottles of wine and a full meal of food, the price (including tip) was about $100each.",5.0
"Visited El Almacen for Valentines Day dinner. The place is very small and cozy so if you need space between tables this isnt the place for you. the decour is romantic with low lighting and low music, real comforting but maybe because it was Valentines Day. The service isn't what I expected, dissappointing. We were sat about 6 inches away from another couple and asked if we could be sat at another table which were all empty, but the server had a ""special layout"" and didn't want to mess it up. There were 6 empty tables! As a server you're suppose to accomodate the guests but I guess her ""layout"" was too important. We sat next to the patio that brought a cold draft next to us. Not a pleasant way to start. Anyways, the server took a while to attend to us. For appetizers we ordered the calamari which was HEAVILY covered in the lemon vinigrette, after a couple biutes became unedible because of the sourness. I ordered a Moscow mule which has 3 ingrediants and after 10 minutes of waiting they didn't couldn't make it which is confusing if they have a full service bar. I ended up ordering sangria which took another 15 minutes to come out because they were now making it. At this point I was annoyed and just wnted my food. For entrees we both ordered the Entrana (Steak), mine was cooked medium and hers well done. They brought out our entrees and mixed up our orders giving my girlfriend my medium steak and giving me her well done. I'm not one to quarrel because mistakes happen but after the poor service in the begining i would expect them to have the correct order and everything to be prompt after. The steaks were well seasoned and cooked and juicy. For dessert we ordere the churros which were more ike thick cookies. Not enough crunch more soft than what a churros should be so I wasn't impressed.Overall I was very dissappointed with the service and because of this I would not be back.

"Five stars to a five star steak I had at El Almacen in late December. It's a small, very dark restaurant on Driggs Avenue. I recommend making a reservation, no matter they say on the phone. I called the restaurant and wanted to make a reservation for two, but they said it's not necessary. However, when we arrived to the restaurant it was full, over the top full. We were asked to wait for an hour and first we though we'd find somewhere else to have dinner, but we saw a plate with a delicious looking steak and returned to the restaurant the steak in our minds and finally got a table after a 15 minute or so wait. The food was excellent, but the service was very very slow. Be aware of that on a busy night if you are hungry. Luckily the grilled veggies and steak were EXCELLENT. They also have good cocktails, I recommend trying the Pimms one.",5.0
"Cosy and even romantic atmosphere, the interior transported me somewhere else. We had the parrilada. It was really good. Everything on it was a pleasure. I'll come back to Brooklyn just to eat here again.",4.0
"I'm most definitely coming back! Being a meat lover - this place has the best value for the quality of steak provided here. I came for a friend's goodbye dinner as she wanted to have a last chance to eat steak in the US, and El Almacen was her place of choice. Pros:-Loved the dark wood/ rustic decor and friendly servers -Must haves are the churrasco and parrillada dishes!! The churrascco was especially delicious-Drinks are solid here, ordered the michelada which was goodCons:-Too dark! The only con is that the lighting here is too dark and a little over the top. Throughout the night I wasn't too sure what I was going to be eating until I tasted the food - the lighting can definitely be brighter.",4.0
Heard great reviews about this cute little restaurant so I decided to try it out. It wasn't a super busy night so we were seated immediately. I have to admit the decor seemed a little bit ran down but the food made up for it.Things we ordered -That rib eye steak...That steak was big enough to feed a family of four. It was cooked to perfection (medium rare as I requested). Avocado fries!! There needs to be more fried avocados in the world.Seared cod - really fresh and flavorful.Didn't see anything I wanted off the dessert menu but the wine selection was great.,4.0
El Almacen is a charming little restaurant in Brooklyn with a really cool courtyard. I was here for brunch and enjoyed a very satisfactory meal in their enclosed outdoor courtyard with low hanging trees and sunlight. The servers were all very nice though it did take about 20 minutes to get our food. The hanger steak and 2 eggs was delicious. It also came with home fries and a mini salad. The sangria was generous (full glass) and tasty. Great place to come for a intimidate sunday date :),4.0
"Came here to celebrate the boyfriend's promotion based on the 300+ yelp reviews. First the positive...the food was incredible. We had the empanandas, 10oz and 18 oz steaks with truffle fries and if I wasn't afraid of getting a splinter on my tongue I would have licked the board clean. The ambiance is rustic and romantic or at least it would had been had it not been for these annoying little factors that diminished it from a 4 star rating to 2...1. Our table was unbalanced and shaky. The host, a waiter and my bf all tried to stabilize it so that our drinks wont go sliding off.2. the tables were so closely joined together it might as well been a family style setting. not to mention when the waitress was taking the next tables orders, her ass was literally on my head 3. it was extremely LOUD. in order to have a decent conversation we had to talk above the 4 drunk men (i'll get to them in a second) sitting next to us and the high pitched woman who made my ears bleed with her shrilling and cackling the entire night4. we got there at 10 pm put our app and entree order in...did not get our app until 1/2 hr later and the only reason I think we got our meal is because I had to flag our waitress down twice and asked her to check on our order...meanwhile, the 4 drunk men that came stumbling (literally) to the table next to us got their 3 bottles of wine, 4 different orders of appetizers and their steaks all before we got our appetizerswhat was meant to be a romantic celebration turned out to be a frustrating dining experience with me trying to distract my bf from all the annoying factors listed above so that he can enjoy his meal. I would love to come back here at a time when it's not crowded so that we can actually enjoy the atmosphere and the food without an ass in my face or a drunk guy stepping on my food to squeeze into his table.",2.0
"Big fan of this (new to me) spot in Williamsburg.  Inside of a house-like space that is cozy and warm, there is a great staff and lots of good drinks/food.  We had a beautiful full Argentinian wine (Reservas Terrazas?) which was great and reasonably priced, and then we avoided having the main meat-course.Instead we opted to share mostly everything else, which worked great in terms of a full meal and also in terms of having tasty food on our table for ages.  New dishes kept coming out and there wasn't pressure for us to hurry out.I think we didn't have a rez but there was no wait on a thursday night in mid-Fall.For three guys, two bottles of wine and a full meal of food, the price (including tip) was about $100each.",5.0
"Visited El Almacen for Valentines Day dinner. The place is very small and cozy so if you need space between tables this isnt the place for you. the decour is romantic with low lighting and low music, real comforting but maybe because it was Valentines Day. The service isn't what I expected, dissappointing. We were sat about 6 inches away from another couple and asked if we could be sat at another table which were all empty, but the server had a ""special layout"" and didn't want to mess it up. There were 6 empty tables! As a server you're suppose to accomodate the guests but I guess her ""layout"" was too important. We sat next to the patio that brought a cold draft next to us. Not a pleasant way to start. Anyways, the server took a while to attend to us. For appetizers we ordered the calamari which was HEAVILY covered in the lemon vinigrette, after a couple biutes became unedible because of the sourness. I ordered a Moscow mule which has 3 ingrediants and after 10 minutes of waiting they didn't couldn't make it which is confusing if they have a full service bar. I ended up ordering sangria which took another 15 minutes to come out because they were now making it. At this point I was annoyed and just wnted my food. For entrees we both ordered the Entrana (Steak), mine was cooked medium and hers well done. They brought out our entrees and mixed up our orders giving my girlfriend my medium steak and giving me her well done. I'm not one to quarrel because mistakes happen but after the poor service in the begining i would expect them to have the correct order and everything to be prompt after. The steaks were well seasoned and cooked and juicy. For dessert we ordere the churros which were more ike thick cookies. Not enough crunch more soft than what a churros should be so I wasn't impressed.Overall I was very dissappointed with the service and because of this I would not be back. I would think for Valentines Day they would accomodate a little more than usual but this wasn't the case. The food was mediocore at best. I don't recommend taking someone your significan other here, more of a friends hangout place.",3.0

"Let me preface this by saying that almost all restaurants in this country buy domestic beef.  Beef is typically NOT imported from South America just b/c the restaurant is Brazilian or Argentine.  Unless you want to pay $95 for your steak...don't expect a regular restaurant to be importing something that you can get high quality and often better versions of right here in the U.S. --- especially from Argentina which is a 12 hour flight away.  Where did that idea come from anyway --- that the ingredients come from the country whose food the restaurant is selling?  I feel bad for so many restaurants who get negative reviews on here that actually affect them, when they are coming from misinformed or uneducated consumers who aren't qualified to critique cooking or know what service is supposed to be. Almacen is romantic and cute, reminds me of Europe with the very close-together tables.   If I am craving super-authentic Argentinian food I'll just go to Queens, especially since I found this to be somewhat over priced however, for a nearby good-enough experience, Almacen fits the bill and then some.   It seemed like it was date night for a lot of people when I went with my husband and this place is perfect for that.   Some of the menu items were weird to me and I could tell the tables around me that ordered them didn't enjoy them such as the avocado fries.  We kept it simple and found our food was pretty tasty.  Oddly enough, I tried the taco appetizer b/c the short rib was calling my name and I have to say it's one of the best tacos I've ever had.  Yes, at first I too was thinking ""what the heck is this doing on this menu"" but boy was it worth it.  Better than most Mexican restaurants' short rib taco and I've eaten quite a few including those at famous locales in Texas and Cali.  Overall Almacen is adorable and they are doing something right, sure beats all the new American, farm to table redundant spots in the area.",4.0

"I wish we'd gotten to sit outside in the garden. Of course, on a beautiful summer day it's difficult. The inside is really dark, but charming. We were there at 6:30pm on Saturday. As expected, the inside was pretty quiet.Now I didn't order the steak because it cost my future first born (okay just kidding, my child will be priceless), but my point is that the menu is kind of expensive. My boyfriend ordered two appetizers. The tacos de costilla which was filled with beef ribs, chimichurri, and avocado. The taco itself was tasty, but the tortilla was not as soft and more dry than I'd prefer. He also got the chorizo o morcilla. The chorizo was quite delicious, but we noticed it went better with the chimichurri sauce that came with the tacos, rather than its own complement.  It's only one sausage, so if you're sharing just that appetizer it might be too little. My dish was the matambrito de pollo - organic chicken roulade  with spinach regianito cheese, and prosciutto. It's accompanied with a side of truffle mashed potato. I liked the cheese, spinach, and prosciutto. Pretty simple flavors and by default it was good, but the chicken was overcooked and kind of bland. Truffle mashed potato was delectable. At first, I thought let me take it easy on the carbs, but nope I wiped them clean so fast.Overall, I'm not sure if I'd come here again, unless maybe it was a really special occasion and I was prepared to go HAM on steak.",3.0

"The air here is literally laced with the scent of truffle oil. Everything about this spot feels rich from the deep flavors to the low lit rooms with dark wood and deep red sconces. It was a warm and welcome spot to spend a child rainy evening.El Almacen is one of those spots that I've been waking by for years and never actually tried, so last I suggested it as a meet up spot for dinner with a good friend although I was little nervous about trying to eat dinner on a Friday night anywhere that close to the Bedford L stop. We met a little before 8pm and were able to get seats at the bar for dinner, although the dining room was packed. The bar tender took great care of us and recommended a fantastic temparnilo by the glass that was beautifully dry, and full bodied. We ordered the hamachi ceviche, calamari, an orecchiette special and the short ribs. The ceviche with shisito peppers and truffle oil were a knock out, so full of clean flavor - I would have been satiated with this alone. The rest of the meal was good, but not quite as memorable. The short ribs were tasty, and I particularly liked the salad that was served along side although I was a little bummed by the chimichurri which was oily when I was wanting for something as fresh and flavor forward as the ceviche. But regardless the dining room was cozy and a thoroughly enjoyable spot to relax on a Friday night. Plus when we settled our check we realized we'd been sitting at the bar for over 2.5 hours and never once did we feel rushed by the staff.

"I ate at this place twice, and both times I was disappointed.On both visits the server took ten minutes to show up for our drink order, then an additional ten minutes to take our food order, at which time we were informed (on both visits) that they were out of the meals we had selected.  I thought that informing your tables what you were out of (especially when you only have 7 entrees) was serving-101. The server then took an additional ten minutes (on both visits) to come back and take our revised food order.The food was fine the first time, but the second time my $40 steak was an oily, bland mess.I didn't raise the issue with our server or the management because I didn't care enough about returning to seek a remedy.  I simply won't come back.",2.0
Their steaks are top notch. Wow! The waitress was very friendly and she was able to describe the menu to me in full detail. Their fries were delicious too. The steak and fries were served on this wooden slab. Really cool.I came back for brunch and got their huevos rancheros (very good too). I'll come back soon.,5.0
"This is a small restaurant, not ideal for big groups. It's big enough to go with a group but difficult to hear everyone, and move around. Their food is good. Personally loved the spinach empañada over steak! It was the first time I ever had empañadas but it tasted great. The meat platters were cooked well but their empañadas were over the top.",4.0
"The brunch steak and eggs may be the best around. My over-easy eggs were perfect, yolks runny. The steak was bigger than you tend to get at these kind if brunch dealios. And tasted it tasted fantastic: intriguingly spiced and cooked a perfect medium rare. The garden out back is really sweet.",4.0
"Came for the first time this evening.  I like the ambiance and the food was really good. We had the guac, fish tacos and the entrana.  The guac was good and the chips fresh. The tacos were small and a little heavy on the dressing/slaw but had a wonderful sour note that I enjoyed.  The skirt steak was a decent portion and seasoned well and cooked to our likeness (medium). It's served with a small side of poblano mashed potatoes which weren't out of this world but I like potatoes with my meat. My boyfriend had a margarita which was good as well. Prices weren't terrible but if I had to choose a similar meal here or at Bogota in Park Slope, I'd choose Park Slope (especially during happy hour). If I'm in Williamsburg,  however,  I would come back and try some other dishes.",4.0
"I came here twice and both visits were fantastic. The decor/space is really nice. I was able to sit in the half-outdoor and backyard the two times I came. Servers were really attentive(but not overly attentive)- there is a very fine line and it definitely was not crossed. Now, onto the food!First visit: Avocado Fries - oh my god... texture/flavour party in my mouth!Hanger steak and two eggs - steak was a bit overdone, but it was still good!Lomito Completo - outrageous Margarita - didn't get to try this, unfortunatelyRed Sangria - about as good as sangria gets!Second visit: Avocado Fries - (same as before- stupidly good)Hanger steak and two eggs - perfectly MR this time, amazing!Special of the Day- something about toast, smoked trout, eggs, cheese, and avocado!

"I LOVE this place. Really - I could eat here every night.  Every time I dine here I get the Hamachi appetizer - padrons, truffle, and sea salt.  I've had meat here twice and each time it has been cooked perfectly.  Extremely generous portions.  The wine list is also solid.  What adds to the experience though is the ambience, atmosphere, and service.  Low-lighting, dark wood tables, and decor make for an intimate dining experience. In addition, the soundtrack/background music is awesome.  The atmosphere created by the decor is wonderful - and you never feel rushed.  That feeling is employed all times by the service staff.  You can tell that they really love their jobs and are truly customer-friendly, and have great senses of humor.  I will dine here again and again.",5.0

"One of my favorite spots in BK. Would be 5 stars, but they definitely reduced their portion sizes dramatically a while ago and it bummed me out bc now it's kind of overpriced for what serving sizes.

"After I ate dinner, I couldn't believe it took me so long to have dinner here. It was just one of those places that no one ever really talked about, wasn't featured in magazines or television, and is just hidden away on Driggs that it was always forgotten. Sad, but true.I had read a lot of reviews about the food at El Almacen as well as the ambience excepted, so I knew what I was getting involved in. Avocado fries were as advertised. I had read they were a must order based solely on how different they were. After a taste test, I could definitely do without them, but I was glad I gave them a shot. The texture difference from the crispy outside to the creamy inside just wasn't what I was hoping for.I ordered the Costillitas de Cerdo ($23), which are braised baby back ribs served with a delicious avocado salad and half a corn cob with traditional Argentinian sauce all over. Everything on this plate was delicious and I attacked it like a wild dog that hasn't had food in days. The meat from the ribs were falling off in the fingers to the delicious, smooth taste of the avocado salad that was needed after some hearty bites of ribs then the corn is a perfect place to settle in for a few crisp, crunchy bites.All around, El Almacen is a great little spot. It's a little cramp and they keep it pretty dark, but what they've got works and I definitely wouldn't mind taking a seat and enjoying that meal again.",4.0
"Went there last night (9-7-13) with my family the atmosphere is very nice. The entrance is a few steps up to a cozy ""shack"" - a bar and tight long corridor of seating and at the back is a patio with additional seating that rests over a courtyard with more seating. A very open floor plan. The food was excellent - we ordered a variety of dishes. The malbec braised short ribs was my personal choice (very tender), and when paired with its side of sweet white potatoes and brussel sprout leaflets, it was superb! We had a malbec wine to go with it. I can't recall the name.. started with an N. The empanadas were excellent too: steak, and spinach-corn-cheese. Didn't taste the others, but I'm certain they're just as delicious. If you love cheese, they have a grilled provolone dish - highly recommend it!We were all satiated by our meals that we didn't opt for dessert - perhaps next time! They have a crepe that is appealing.Bathrooms - I didn't go, but I heard there was a line.

"We had brunch here on Sunday and didn't have the best experience. Service was horrifically slow (I had to ask for menus and flag the server down to take our orders). It looked like they only had two servers for the packed restaurant, though, so I was cutting them some slack. Our food took forever to come. My boyfriend's steak was overcooked but tasty (though small), and his eggs were so oily that he didn't eat them. My burger was raw (I'd asked for it well-done). It was literally cold in the middle. I asked them to cook it more (and I NEVER send food back). It came back burnt. They'd put the entire burger, bun, toppings, and all, on the grill and burnt it to a crisp. (But somehow, it was still pink in the middle.) It was over an hour since we arrived at that point, so I tried to just eat it. It was disgusting. The server was very kind and ordered me something else, but I was just over it by that point. I'm hoping this was just an infrequent screw-up by someone hungover in the kitchen, but between the slow service and the undercooked/burnt food, we didn't have a good experience. It took literally two hours for both of us to eat.",2.0
"Been back to this restaurant quite a few times since 2013, and i have to upgrade their review to a full 5 stars. Their steaks are consistently delicious - so well marinated and cooked. The entrana is a MUST and truffle fries never hurt anyone ;). if you are a fan of non-sweet sangria, their red is a good option.

"Wow! This unassuming little restaurant on Driggs Street in Williamsburg, Brooklyn is a little gem and a great find! First off, Brooklyn keeps surprising me time and time again with all of their great things going on. This place, has a an extensive wine list and a full bar plus excellent, attentive service. The space is really cute too. In the back they have a deck which is covered which was good because it was raining, and they also have an outside area. Really cute intimate and also romantic.We had their chips and guacamole to start. Great chips and excellent guacamole. I was very pleased it's hard to find good guacamole and chips sometimes in New York. We followed it up with their fish tacos which were fried -I wish they had mentioned that on the menu- other than that they were great.

"This is a high quality Argentine restaurant with really good food and wine. The meat is very authentic and the empanadas are delicious.

"One of Williamsburg's finest! We came here for a hot summer night with a big group of people. The staff was super accommodating and gave us a big table outside in the garden. The garden is beautiful and lit overhead by a string of lights - totally picturesque and romantic.The meat there is my personal favorite (although I have ordered their Aji Relleno - stuffed peppers with spinach, cheese, corn, rice and beans - which are also increíble.)

"TWO CHECK-INs IN ONE DAY! WOO!We went here for brunch and love it so much that we came back to try their dinner menu. Both meals were outstanding. And the best thing was that they remembered us from the morning! This place is intimate, romantic, homey, casual, friendly, delicious...the only bad word to describe this place would be...cramped. But I forgive you because at least I am too busy stuffing my face with your delicious food to care about my food neighbors.Ceviche de Bife -- SO GOOD. Practically like awesome beef sashimi if that makes any sense...It just thin slightly raw slices of tasty meat heaven. To be more specific, it is seared rib-eye.Hanger Steak & 2 Eggs -- YUM. Nothing to complain about here. Price point is $11 for two perfect eggs, a piece of great tasting meat, salad, and potatoes? Just yum.Avocado Fries -- INTERESTING. I love avocado so therefore I like this. It basically slices of avocado in some sort of breading that's been fried? baked? I don't know. But it's good. Warm avocado, and a crunchy exterior mmm. Of course I was fat and just ate all of it myself, it would have been better to share because avocado=fat. Steak/some sort of beef -- Sadly I forget which one we ordered but it was so good!! And it came with two sauces that paired so well with the meat. I never really like eating beef but I just wanted to eat more and more!Price point is not bad either :)",4.0

"Wow! This unassuming little restaurant on Driggs Street in Williamsburg, Brooklyn is a little gem and a great find! First off, Brooklyn keeps surprising me time and time again with all of their great things going on. This place, has a an extensive wine list and a full bar plus excellent, attentive service. The space is really cute too. In the back they have a deck which is covered which was good because it was raining, and they also have an outside area. Really cute intimate and also romantic.We had their chips and guacamole to start. Great chips and excellent guacamole. I was very pleased it's hard to find good guacamole and chips sometimes in New York.

"Everything about this place was great. The ambiance is cool. Very dark and intimate feel. The waitress was super attentive and adorable. The spinach and cheese and steak empanada was absolutely delicious. I would go back just for the empanada. I ordered the entrana skirt steak that came with poblano mash. The waitress let me know if I wanted well done, it would take a bit longer. My friend got the braised baby back ribs (costillitas de cerdo). The steak was well done like I asked but delicious and tender. The mash and sauces were soooo good. The ribs fell of the bone and was so flavorful. The corn that came with it was great as well as the avocado salad, despite the big chunks of tomato (not a tomato fan). Overall the food was incredible.

"Having heard mixed reviews of this place, I decided to try it out to see for myself on a Monday night as it's just down the street and I didn't feel like cooking.  I sat at the bar and was a bit apprehensive when I saw they had tshirts and tote bags for sale...for a second I thought I stepped into the Stonewall Inn.  Merchandising just seemed out of place here, but hey anything for a buck I guess. The bartender was very nice, and from Buenos Aires which I liked gives the place a bit of street cred.  I had a couple of things from the Parrilla - sausage and steak which were both good.  I had a glass of the Malbec - a nine dollar one which wasn't my favorite but oh well.  I mean obviously the beef wasn't as good as you'd find in Argentina but hey whatever it was still tasty and cooked well.  I thought the chorizo was really tasty.  The chimichurri was ok, I thought it'd have a bit more flavor.  Overall a pleasant experience.  I also liked the ambience and I bet the outdoor area is nice when it's not winter time.  I will say the clientele was odd, I experienced the thing of holding the door for a couple on their way out and they didn't even acknowledge me, maybe they thought I was homeless in my jeans and hoodie but I thought that was norm core?

It was not bad. We ordered medium well and they did a good job. They grilled it just right. The meal is enough to share for two people. The place is alright.

"We've been meaning to check out El Almacen for a while.  The first time we tried the wait was two hours on a Saturday at 7 and we had plans later so had to bail.  Went back on a Saturday at 5 with the kids and got seated no problem.They were very accommodating with the little ones, which was nice, though I would not say this is a great place to take children.  Its a little too close quarters and the service was a little too slow. Service was friendly overall.The food was quite good.  We started with empanadas, which were very flavorful and appeared fried, which wasn't what I was used to eating empanadas when I was in Buenos Aires they were generally baked.  The filling was authentic and delicious.We got a milanesa de carne for the kids, I had the rib eye and my wife had the shortribs, which had been highly recommended.  The short ribs were OK, but no where near as good as the rib eye.  The sauces were excellent, they had a nice selection of inexpensive and delicious Malbecs, and overall I felt transported back to Argentina with the food and drink.We will definitely be coming back again.",4.0

"Service is always spotty here.  Waiting forever for our apps, so when it was taken to the wrong table, and we saw a bunch of confused customers looking at each other, we politely said it was ours and we would take it--waitress had dropped it and split already.  When she returned and the other customers told her, she said ""oh"" and not a word more.  3 minutes later our steak came; again, no acknowledgement despite the poor timing.Food is ok, but not as good as I remember.  Skirt steak was disappointing.  Most food was oversalted...some was underseasoned.  Happy hour is a good deal, but every place has happy hour, so I am not giving a lot of credit for that.  On that note, the sangria is nasty.Overall, think I'm going to give up on this place for a while.",2.0
"We've been meaning to check out El Almacen for a while.  The first time we tried the wait was two hours on a Saturday at 7 and we had plans later so had to bail.  Went back on a Saturday at 5 with the kids and got seated no problem.They were very accommodating with the little ones, which was nice, though I would not say this is a great place to take children.  Its a little too close quarters and the service was a little too slow. Service was friendly overall.The food was quite good.  We started with empanadas, which were very flavorful and appeared fried, which wasn't what I was used to eating empanadas when I was in Buenos Aires they were generally baked.  The filling was authentic and delicious.We got a milanesa de carne for the kids, I had the rib eye and my wife had the shortribs, which had been highly recommended.  The short ribs were OK, but no where near as good as the rib eye.  The sauces were excellent, they had a nice selection of inexpensive and delicious Malbecs, and overall I felt transported back to Argentina with the food and drink.We will definitely be coming back again.",4.0
"Excellent vibe - cozy, warm atmosphere with nice interior designRelatively limited variety but everything was tasty and nicely presentedPulpo y rusa, empanadas and the chevice were great - tacos slightly disappointing",4.0
"I'm glad to say the place is back to what I knew the first time I went, was there with my friend we order the dry age steak and the tacos were unbelievable, is being a while since I last wrote a review about them, I check my inbox today to found out over a year ago when I had a bad experience one of owners messaged me and apologize, it's nice to see they care about good service, bad experience is a thing from the past",5.0

"How did I not write a review about this place yet?  They have the best steak in all of NYC and I've been to the usual suspects (Peter Lugers, Sparks, etc).   The skirt steak with the chimichurri on the side & sea salt, plus the mashed potatoes sprinkled with amazingness are soo good and if memory serves me correctly, only $21.The avocado fries for appetizer are a MUST. They are always crunchy on the outside (yay panko!) and smooth and creamy on the inside. The spicy ketchup-like dipping sauce is amazing.  I've also tried their fish tacos, calamari, side salad, rib eye, stuffed pepper and flan.  ALL are soo good.  You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu.When I can, I grab a seat at the bar, because table seating can be tight.  There is also one waitress there that can be a little bitchy, but I'm totally overlooking that because no amount of rudeness could keep me away from the amazing steaks!!Also, as in other reviews.

"Not recommend! We paid $40 for a steak that was obviously not argentinian. It was just a regular steak, nothing better than the usual steak, and it was a bit overcooked.

"El Almacen is both delicious and with great atmosphere. Situated right near the Bedford L stop at Driggs and North 7th, it's totally unassuming and quite cozy. El Almacen boasts cuisine from Argentina, steaks, seafood, everything. The food is amazing, the inside and outside is so cute and welcoming (especially for happy hour). The stuffed peppers, the massive carving-block style steaks, the fiambres y quesos, the himachi, try it all. The prices are so reasonable as well.Great for with friends, great for a date. I'd highly recommend the steak most of all, if you see them they are just huge and juicy and you could literally take a nap on one.To be brief, El Almacen, which has been around for a bit, has served as a pioneer for Williamsburg restaurants. What so many institutions have attempted to do, El Almacen has done and with ease. They have a niche, they know what they want to serve, they serve it with grace and expertise, and they know how to provide an ambiance. Overall, newly opened restaurants in the area should be looking to landmarks like El Almacen (or Tabare) for how to best provide a unique and crave-worthy experience.

I miss the oxtail pappardelle that was on the menu. :(We took the family here for my baby bro's birthday (he loves this place so much he went here two times in one week a few times) and everyone enjoyed what they ordered.

"Love this place! I have never seen or tasted Avocado fries at all. That was just one of the highlights of this meal. The Avocado fries are a must in my own opinion. The Braised Short ribs and the spare ribs were outstanding as well and I was very surprised of the amount they gave you. The corn with cotija, and chopotle mayo called Choclo was probably the best way I have tasted corn in my life. So obviously the food is great here and different. Now about the place. The restaurant is very dark and has a great backyard for seating and it's kind of romantic in a way. Very comfortable. The service could have been better though. A little forgetful and we had to remind them a few times of things we ordered and didn't get. But in the long run it was all worked out and it still deserves 5 stars. I would come back here to try other things on their menu. It must be great cause what we had was really good.",5.0
"I'm by no means a food critic...yet. The food at El Almacen was excellent, but it could never cover for the service. This place definitely had a case of the absent server. I was dining alone and I noticed that other tables were getting more consistent service than I was, but that's not the problem. The problem is I saw my waitress once the entire meal, to take my order. After the meal she dropped the check. I'm a waitress myself, I get it, sometimes you don't want to work, but a cheesy, ""how is everything?"" is definitely better than nothing. I hate to be picky about service seeing as I work in the industry, but even the bussers were supbar. He came to clear the table and left my knife and dirty napkin. This is a small place, it wasn't crowded on a Monday, there is no excuse not to be able to do your job well. On to the food, I ended up getting avocado fries and the rabas (which was amazing). At the beginning of the meal, I was considering going back to try the entrana which a lady next to me was having and it looked soooo goood, but I'd rather not after that service experience.",2.0

"Hey!don't read reviews bellow 4 starts - not worth your time ;)I have lived in Billyburg for about 5 years - i come to this place religiously - diner, brunch, you name it - food is always awesome. they have great steaks, sangria chicken, deserts, coffee is good too - sauces are awesome...just go!their newer, sister restaurant Rosarito Fish Shack is also good and has an great atmosphere. ;)",5.0
"El Almacen is one of the few places I like to go to in Williamsburg often. It's unfortunate that my husband is a pescaterian (peskyterian as I like to say) because he misses out! He enjoys the chile relleno, the fish special & the calamari which I enjoy as well.  I've had almost everything here.  I don't crave steak often, but if I do, this is where I would go. The waitresses are friendly & cute. I need to eat everything on the menu. I miss the oxtail pappardelle that was on the menu. :(We took the family here for my baby bro's birthday (he loves this place so much he went here two times in one week a few times) and everyone enjoyed what they ordered. If you're looking for a fail-safe delicious place, this is a good place to go.",5.0
"I had such a great experience here! They have an adorable outdoor seating area with a beautiful garden, and the food was fresh and delicious. Also, the staff was friendly and attentive, I would definitely come back!",5.0
"Love this place! I have never seen or tasted Avocado fries at all. That was just one of the highlights of this meal. The Avocado fries are a must in my own opinion. The Braised Short ribs and the spare ribs were outstanding as well and I was very surprised of the amount they gave you. The corn with cotija, and chopotle mayo called Choclo was probably the best way I have tasted corn in my life. So obviously the food is great here and different. Now about the place. The restaurant is very dark and has a great backyard for seating and it's kind of romantic in a way. Very comfortable. The service could have been better though. A little forgetful and we had to remind them a few times of things we ordered and didn't get. But in the long run it was all worked out and it still deserves 5 stars. I would come back here to try other things on their menu. It must be great cause what we had was really good.",5.0
"I'm by no means a food critic...yet. The food at El Almacen was excellent, but it could never cover for the service. This place definitely had a case of the absent server. I was dining alone and I noticed that other tables were getting more consistent service than I was, but that's not the problem. The problem is I saw my waitress once the entire meal, to take my order. After the meal she dropped the check. I'm a waitress myself, I get it, sometimes you don't want to work, but a cheesy, ""how is everything?"" is definitely better than nothing. I hate to be picky about service seeing as I work in the industry, but even the bussers were supbar. He came to clear the table and left my knife and dirty napkin. This is a small place, it wasn't crowded on a Monday, there is no excuse not to be able to do your job well. On to the food, I ended up getting avocado fries and the rabas (which was amazing). At the beginning of the meal, I was considering going back to try the entrana which a lady next to me was having and it looked soooo goood, but I'd rather not after that service experience.",2.0
The good is great here but the service was a HUGE turn off. It was incredibly slow I was seriously dozing off. We had to remind the waiter a few times to check on our appetizers that we placed about 40 mins after we put in our main order. Then our entrees came 30 mins after. We were there for 2 hours! And it was just me and my husband. It wasn't even a busy evening. We were seated outside on the terrace with great ambiance. This was really weird considering we were in NY and not NC where service is normally slower than the rest of the country.,3.0
Met up with some friends here on a Friday night.  The restaurant was very busy but the service was still friendly and efficient.  The soup on special was butternut squash and I was very excited to hear this because butternut squash is my favorite and this soup did not dissapoint.  It had huge chunks of buffalo mozarella on top and anything with huge chunks of any type of cheese is going to make me happy.  I do not eat meat so I ordered the two empanadas one was cheese and onion and the other was spinach cheese corn. They were so good and it took all self control to not order another two!,5.0
"YUM!  The food and wine were very good.  Everything we ordered was fresh and delicious.We ordered all the ceviche, & guacamole and they were great.  Enchiladas were tasty.It is a bit on the dark side and not too roomy, but the service was friendly and professional.  I would definately return.",4.0

"Very cute inside that never imagined from outside. Waitresses were friendly and place was packed around 7PM on Thursday night.We ordered Chocro (grilled corn with chipotle mayo & cotija), fried avocado & Ensalada de Ramolacha to start, then had Churrasco (18 oz. rib eye steak) as a entrée. Everyone talked about Fried avocado on Yelp, but we thought it was not so exciting. Maybe it would be nice if they serve with different dipping sauce, not like simple ketchup. Chocro was very juicy and had perfectly seasoned. Churrasco was tender and juicy and loved truffle fries.  We had 2 bottled beer & a bottle of Malbec, and our bill was around $100. Not bad at all. We will come back :)",4.0
"Adorable restuarant in a really great location for people coming from manhattan. I went here for my birthday a couple months ago (and remembered I never left a review) on a week day and the service was pretty good. A little slow, but attentive.Malbec Braised Short Rib was to die for. I could eat that over and over and I am not even a huge beef fan. The Matambrito de Pollo was also very very good but not as good as the short ribs.The Sangria was a weak point, but I can get past it due to how good the food is. I will just try a different drink next time.Definitely one of the best in the area.",4.0
Excellent food... Not much more to say.  Went for the second time Sunday night and it was just as good as the first time. We started with the tacos de costilla and avocado fries. Both pretty tasty.  I got the Costilla de res which was very tender and tasty. My boyfriend got the entraña which he said was cooked perfectly at medium rare. The chimichuri sauce had a kick of spice which really added to the awesome flavor of the steak.  Another friend got the enchilada which was exactly what he was looking for. I didn't try it but looked like it had a lot going on. When I turned around it was all gone so must have been delicious. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone around the neighborhood. It's crowded during prime dinner time and the tables are very close together but hey you have to make some sacrifices sometimes for great food!,5.0
Exactly what I was looking for in a cool and different Williamsburg restaurant! Food is awesome and the atmosphere is great! I highly recommend the fiambres y quesos platter! It is absolutely delicious! The sangria is so tasty and refreshing! And another must is the grilled corn!,5.0
"Just tried out El Almacen with the hubs. I give it an A. Nice interior (a bit dark), quick and friendly service, good food. If you want a tasty slab of meat in Brooklyn, this is the place.We ordered the guacamole (good) & the avocado fries (interesting, but not amazing). I ordered the baby back ribs, and let me tell you. THIS IS THE DEAL OF THE CENTURY!!!!!!!!!You get a huge slab of perfectly cooked ribs, a side of that mexican style corn on the cob (grilled with mayo and cheese), and a side dish of avocado & tomato for $23!!!! The BBQ'ed ribs were tender, and the meat fell right off the bone. I asked for extra napkins but they weren't necessary at all. Also from looking at other customers orders - the paella looks delicious, and their $60 meat plate for couples also looks amazing. We will definitely go back.",4.0

"Went in on a Saturday around 8pm for dinner. We were told there was a 90 minute wait, so we went and got a couple drinks at Hotel Delmano (yum) and came back. Upon our return, the hostess apologized and told us that there was still a bit of a wait. She must have sensed our disappointment, because she disappeared for a moment and came back offering us a seat at the bar, if we didn't mind. At that point, we were half drunk and ravenous, so we took it. The bartender was a doll, just as sweet as the hostess had been. To start, we got a round of micheladas and an order of guacamole, and all of it came out right away and was quite tasty. For entrees, we ordered the churrasco and the tire de asado. The churrasco: I ordered it medium-rare. It came out so perfectly medium rare. This steak was so beautiful that I wanted to sing to it gently and pet it and bring it home with me. But instead, I ate it. Nay, I devoured it. It was glorious. The chimmichuri sauce was oily and spicy and was a delicious compliment. The fries were plentiful and yummy.The tire de asado: Cooked perfectly, tender, lovely. The salad was dressed with just the right amount. We loved it. For desert I had a Partida Anejo neat. A great ending to a great meal.Then I went home and tried to digest for the next few days. Steakkkkkkkk. Looking forward to my next meal here!",5.0

"Ate here last week during the snow storm. Evening got off to a great start when we got a parking spot right in front, but that probably won't happen to you. This place is meat galore, but not at the expense of the fish: hamachi ceviche was excellent, ""cooked"" in juices but served strained of said liquid, with a drizzle of oil and razor-thin slices of hot pepper. The result: fresh, tasty fish whose flavor has been lightly accentuated, not overpowered. Highly recommended. The mixed grill seems pricey, but it's a big portion. My wife and I split it, sharing some with our 3 year old son, and still brought home maybe 10 ounces and made cheesesteaks the next day. Morcilla is the star of the dish--good offal, tons of flavor, falls apart on the tongue. Fries are pretty tasty dipped in the sauces. Salad with the beets and watercress is really nice--some purple cress I haven't happened upon before. Our son devoured the ham and cheese empanadas--not earth-shattering (empanadas, after all) but pretty tasty. Instead of trying one of many Malbecs, we opted for a couple of cocktails, which were excellent--well-balanced, fresh ingredients. Finished with the chocolate cake. Cake itself is not too special--90s molten variety, but the dulce de leche ice cream is most capital. Not to sweet, with a delicate salt accent. Atmosphere is convivial: this is a place where people come to unwind, have a couple of good drinks and eat good food. On that note, service was very friendly, with zero attitude. Seemed to be real porten~os workin' up in here. Only minor complaint: paradoxically, if you want to be warm, don't get a table near the fireplace. It's not a working fireplace, and it's rather drafty. Overall, very good experience.",5.0

IT WAS DELICIOUS. The white sangria they served was perfect. Great taste and gave me a buzz. I also had the taco dish which came with 2 tacos. The beef inside it was succulent and juicy.

"Came here on a Sunday night and the place was packed (good sign!). However that meant a wait by the bar with people trying to squeeze by. Finally got a table by the front door but asked to be moved because of the draft. Waitress was accommodating and moves us to the covered patio in the back. Once there we ordered pretty quickly but waited for an hour for anything to come, even the guac. But alas when the food did arrive it was worth the wait-the steak was delish and the chimichuri sauce made me want to drink it and not just dip the meat in it, it was that good. Overall going to write the long waits to an off night and will be back.",4.0
"I came here on a Thursday night to meet up with my favorite girlfriends.  The place is so cute and low-lit and romantic, and though it's filled with people, it's not overly loud or unpleasant at all.  If this is meant to evoke Argentina, my guess is it would be Argentina in the 40s -- stained glass lamps in the back and gold lettering in the windows make the ambience classic, elegant and tastefully understated.  The staff here were very nice and offered to seat our party of 3 right away, even though our third was running late. To start, we ordered some guacamole and some fried calamari with sweet plantains. I've never seen calamari done quite like this before and was delicious! Our meal was well-orchestrated.  Bar staff was prompt with refilling our wine glasses.  We were big fans of an $11 per glass malbec that was ""complex"" and went great with the food.  For my entree I ordered the paella.  Unlike the paella in Spain, this paella came in a very tiny, cute little cast-iron pan.  Lots of different varieties of seafood and it was all tasty and fresh.  In the end, I appreciated the fact that the paella wasn't a huge portion, because I got to order it as an entree without having it take over my entire dining experience.  We had some truffle fries also that were quite tasty.  My girlfriends shared the skirt steak and they said it was great!We had a leisurely meal, chatting the night away and savoring the food,  The staff never rushed us through and were efficient without being overly present at our table.  My only complaint about the place was the seating -- where we were, it was impossible for either us or our neighbors to get in and out of our seats without having to get up and move out of each other's way.  I'm used to cramped places in NYC, but having to get up every time someone at the table next to me has to get up isn't quite the perfect dining experience.  This place does a lot with the tiny amount of space they do have, however, and because they're so nice and the food is tasty, it's worth putting into the rotation of Williamsburg dining choices.",4.0
"Rating this one was tough (between 3 and 4 stars), the food was very good but our server was just horrible. Came here with the bf for my birthday. Loved the decor. Two girls were sat near us after we sat down. Our server gave them bread but forgot about us, she kept checking up on them but for some reason kept forgetting about us. When she took our order she wasn't pleasant either. To start we had the grilled corn --it was delicious, and expected as it was priced at $5. The bf had the Entrana (skirt steak) which was very tasty. I had the Costillitas de Res (Malbec Braised Short Ribs), mine was ok.To drink I had a blackberry cocktail --this was the highlight of the experience. Too bad it was tiny and was priced at $10!For dessert, the churros --they tasted too much like egg and were too crunchy. Churros are supposed to be slightly crunchy on the outside and spongy on the inside. The dulce de leche and chocolate sauce that accompanied the churros were pretty good.",3.0

The eggs were cooked PERFECTLY and while the steak was also very good, I ordered mine medium rare and it was more medium well and he ordered rare and it ended up coming out more medium-medium rare.

Finally got a table by the front door but asked to be moved because of the draft. Waitress was accommodating and moves us to the covered patio in the back. Once there we ordered pretty quickly but waited for an hour for anything to come, even the guac. But alas when the food did arrive it was worth the wait-the steak was delish and the chimichuri sauce made me want to drink it and not just dip the meat in it, it was that good. Overall going to write the long waits to an off night and will be back.",4.0
"I came here on a Thursday night to meet up with my favorite girlfriends.  The place is so cute and low-lit and romantic, and though it's filled with people, it's not overly loud or unpleasant at all.  If this is meant to evoke Argentina, my guess is it would be Argentina in the 40s -- stained glass lamps in the back and gold lettering in the windows make the ambience classic, elegant and tastefully understated.  The staff here were very nice and offered to seat our party of 3 right away, even though our third was running late. To start, we ordered some guacamole and some fried calamari with sweet plantains. I've never seen calamari done quite like this before and was delicious! Our meal was well-orchestrated.  Bar staff was prompt with refilling our wine glasses.  We were big fans of an $11 per glass malbec that was ""complex"" and went great with the food.  For my entree I ordered the paella.  Unlike the paella in Spain, this paella came in a very tiny, cute little cast-iron pan.  Lots of different varieties of seafood and it was all tasty and fresh.  In the end, I appreciated the fact that the paella wasn't a huge portion, because I got to order it as an entree without having it take over my entire dining experience.  We had some truffle fries also that were quite tasty.  My girlfriends shared the skirt steak and they said it was great!We had a leisurely meal, chatting the night away and savoring the food,  The staff never rushed us through and were efficient without being overly present at our table.  My only complaint about the place was the seating -- where we were, it was impossible for either us or our neighbors to get in and out of our seats without having to get up and move out of each other's way.  I'm used to cramped places in NYC, but having to get up every time someone at the table next to me has to get up isn't quite the perfect dining experience.  This place does a lot with the tiny amount of space they do have, however, and because they're so nice and the food is tasty, it's worth putting into the rotation of Williamsburg dining choices.",4.0
"Rating this one was tough (between 3 and 4 stars), the food was very good but our server was just horrible. Came here with the bf for my birthday. Loved the decor. Two girls were sat near us after we sat down. Our server gave them bread but forgot about us, she kept checking up on them but for some reason kept forgetting about us. When she took our order she wasn't pleasant either. To start we had the grilled corn --it was delicious, and expected as it was priced at $5. The bf had the Entrana (skirt steak) which was very tasty. I had the Costillitas de Res (Malbec Braised Short Ribs), mine was ok.To drink I had a blackberry cocktail --this was the highlight of the experience. Too bad it was tiny and was priced at $10!For dessert, the churros --they tasted too much like egg and were too crunchy. Churros are supposed to be slightly crunchy on the outside and spongy on the inside. The dulce de leche and chocolate sauce that accompanied the churros were pretty good.",3.0

"We used a HowAboutWe for brunch at El Almacen. 5 stars for the atmosphere - the garden in the back was so cute! I ordered the ribeye and eggs, which they were out of (hence the 4 stars) and so we both ended up ordering the hanger steak and eggs. The eggs were cooked PERFECTLY and while the steak was also very good, I ordered mine medium rare and it was more medium well and he ordered rare and it ended up coming out more medium-medium rare. We weren't so much a fan of the avocado fries. I also had higher hopes for the mimosa (it said fresh squeezed orange juice but didn't really taste like it..). Also perfect location - right off the L.

The skirt steak is a large portion of juicy and flavorful meat and the mashed poatoes it was served with was buttery and amazing. The steak was a little chewier than I expected but still very good. They forgot to give us the fish tacos so we had to request them again -service overall was very friendly but not always on top of things.

The shishito peppers aren't the first thing that comes to mind when you think Argentinian food but they were seasoned perfectly and the portion was enough for four people to share. Their truffle fries are perfectly crispy with sufficient truffle essence; they are obviously not hand cut but for their texture and taste it's excusable.  The grilled corn is tasty but its kinda hard to mess that up considering were in the height of the corn season, grill it up, slap on some butter, cheese and lemon; done! I did have a bite of the blood sausage, that shizzz was delicious!!! The casing had the snap you expect in a sausage and the filling was perfectly smooth and rich...This would have been a three star review except that our food took 1.5hrs to reach the table.

"I brought my parents and boyfriend here a few weeks ago because I was craving Baja-style fish tacos, and thought El Almacen would be a nice introduction to these simple, cheap eats. In Cali, I could get a good-sized fish tacos (ie, substantial enough to be filling but to the point of being stuffed), with fresh, quality fish, and simple, clean flavors for under $3 apiece. And that's from a taco *chain*--California Fish Grill.But no...El Almacen managed to make their fish tacos the complete opposite--tiny, expensive ($9 for two that, when squished together was the same size as the ones I got in Cali), and to top it off, and not tasty at all. I wouldn't mind if they were expensive, tiny and GOOD. But the lack of quality here was just absurd.The fish taco had a piece of fish so small and so completely covered in spicy salsa and onions that the taste and texture of the fish was overpowered. I had to open up the taco just to make sure there was really fish in it. The beef tacos were no better. The meat tasted like overcooked BBQ rib meat that had been left out too long, nestled in a sea of orange oil atop the tortilla. I'm sure even Taco Bell doesn't offer this kind of stuff.On the upside, the ceviche mixto (shrimp, calamari, yellowtail, etc) was good. My boyfriend liked his Aji Relleno (stuffed pepper with spinach, cheese and corn over rice and black beans). The Choclo (grilled corn, chipotle mayo and cotija cheese) was ok, but wildly expensive at $5 for one cob ($8 for two), which they can't even do you the favor of cutting. (I asked, and they said no.

"i came here for a birthday dinner on a Saturday. At first glance, I really liked the decor and vibe of the place. I would say this place is less for dates and more for group dining. The service wasn't great, not so attentive, but not poor. The 3 stars is for the food. The menu is a bit all over for me since I thought it was a steakhouse. The menu was Mexican/Cuban/Brazilian/Wine bar, a bit confusing.  If the food was good, then all the praises for an extensive menu. Unfortunately, I would say sub par for the food and all dishes are really small for the price you pay.Rabas - Great acidity, but the portion was really small.Avocado Fries - I've had avocado fries before and these were not great. They were small and they served it with BBQ sauce, I mean really??? Truffle Fries - Weak. Gimmick. Props for making them crispy, but wheres the truffle flavor?? You get a hint of it, but absolutely no truffle flavor once consumed. Please add some more truffle oil, if you're going to call them Truffle Fries. Papardella  con Rabo - Oxtail was brasied well and the parpardella was cooked to my liking. But i didn't taste no coffee flavor and it was way too sweet, almost tasted like BBQ sauce. Another poorly executed dish.Paella - Again great technic, nice socarrat, cooked well. For $22 you get an appetizer size plate. It's suppose to be an entree, i mean it's just rice, definitely another fail.Porterhouse - Let me remind you it was $63!!! It was way to small for $63, at a winebar??? maybe it was worth $40. It came with Truffle Fries, again ehhhhhk. The sausage was bland and boring. The chimichurri was a plus, the steak itself had flavor but the dish overall was a 6/10.",3.0

I am adding to this review 9.11.12.  I continue to have greta experiences at El Amacen.  I have never had a bad meal there and I have been well over a dozen times.  The staff is beautiful and friendly and the steaks are on par with the city's top steak houses.   This last time I went I had my 1 year old and the staff was patient with us, even stopping to play with the baby.",5.0
I can;t remember how many times i have been in this place and no matter who i was with and what we have ordered  the food has always been excellent !!! The place is very nice with a nice garden . The wine list is also great and they have full bar . Service is OK not great or this place would have get a 5 stars but i do not think it will happen . Anyway if you want to eat great food that is the place for Williamsburg :)Update on Sept 20 : for 1st time i was seriously disappointed about the food and the over 40 minutes wait for the entrees !! And the Churrasco was very very fatty ( the 4 extra oz compare to the Entrana are just fat )! they use to do nice Pappardelle now they have those over overcooked linguini .... Hope they go back to the good food !,3.0
"I really like the ambiance, the exquisite truffle fries, the empanadas, and the churros.  The ""ribeye"" here is the toughest steak I've ever had though.  I think it was a shoe leather, because it was nothing like even the worst ribeye I've seen.  If I didn't like the restaurant for the many good factors, I'd rate the ribeye negative stars.",3.0
"i came here for a birthday dinner on a Saturday. At first glance, I really liked the decor and vibe of the place. I would say this place is less for dates and more for group dining. The service wasn't great, not so attentive, but not poor. The 3 stars is for the food. The menu is a bit all over for me since I thought it was a steakhouse. The menu was Mexican/Cuban/Brazilian/Wine bar, a bit confusing.  If the food was good, then all the praises for an extensive menu. Unfortunately, I would say sub par for the food and all dishes are really small for the price you pay.Rabas - Great acidity, but the portion was really small.Avocado Fries - I've had avocado fries before and these were not great. They were small and they served it with BBQ sauce, I mean really??? Truffle Fries - Weak. Gimmick. Props for making them crispy, but wheres the truffle flavor?? You get a hint of it, but absolutely no truffle flavor once consumed. Please add some more truffle oil, if you're going to call them Truffle Fries. Papardella  con Rabo - Oxtail was brasied well and the parpardella was cooked to my liking. But i didn't taste no coffee flavor and it was way too sweet, almost tasted like BBQ sauce. Another poorly executed dish.Paella - Again great technic, nice socarrat, cooked well. For $22 you get an appetizer size plate. It's suppose to be an entree, i mean it's just rice, definitely another fail.Porterhouse - Let me remind you it was $63!!! It was way to small for $63, at a winebar??? maybe it was worth $40. It came with Truffle Fries, again ehhhhhk. The sausage was bland and boring. The chimichurri was a plus, the steak itself had flavor but the dish overall was a 6/10.",3.0
"Just altogether fantastic. We stumbled on this restaurant after doing a little shopping in Williamsburg. We had short ribs and a grilled skirt steak with mixed drinks. Everything was just bursting with flavor. The service was completely professional and the place had an intimate and inviting atmosphere. We loved it and can't wait to return. The portions were too large to accommodate a dessert, but who cares, the meal was just completely delicious.",5.0
"i see a lot of people saying this is a good place to go with friends. Since this space is extremely tight, i dont think that would work well. They sat someone with their back (and hair) directly next to my arm. i was afraid if they moved, their hair would get into my food. They were extremely close to me.The wait staff was mediocre at best. my wife and I were not given bread. Other tables around us got bread. they seem to be more intent on moving the tables, than providing a good dining experience. FOOD:Food was pretty good. little beef ribs were excellent. skirt steak was not bad, but not great.",2.0
"I really do like the food here, and the décor is cozy, a great date spot for sure.  The backyard is wonderful in the summer.  Here's what I hate about this place that takes it down to 3 stars.1.  How do you really get away with charging about $20 per entree and still be a cash only spot?  A place can be cash only, but when this place ALSO has an ATM in the actual restaurant that charges a whopping $1.75 to take money out to PAY THEM, I find that insulting.  Not only are they making you pay fees to take out cash, but they're clearly hitting you on both ends.  A real dick move if you ask me.2.  The hosts are very good at forgetting that you're waiting for a table.  Being that it's a small restaurant, it's not uncommon to come in, get told you have 5-10 minutes to wait, and then end up sitting at the bar for 30-40 minutes while people who came in after you get sat.So the food is great, though, and that is their redeeming factor.  They have a full bar now (used to be beer/wine only).  I'd love this place a little more if they weren't blatantly screwing their customers over with the ATM fees and terrible hosting.",3.0

I don't particularly like chicken, but again, I was in no mood to try to flag the waitress down. (No, no chance of her checking in on us. Of course not.)For my entree, I got the paella.

Not a huge deal , and they were good, but again service.The avocado frites for $5 - to be honest were good but nothing to write home about. The grilled chorizo was really good and the steak tacos were drenched in oil but delicious.Overall the food (and I didn't have a steak) was good the service lacked a bit of attentiveness and quality.

"Went for breakfast. Decor, nice. Real 'hip'. I wasn't hungover, but I could have been, and was very glad they had booze. A got a mate margarita, which, despite the hefty price tag, was unbelievably good. Sadly, I think I drank the whole thing in a minute or two, from two tiny straws. I got my caffeine fix AND alcohol fix, I could not have asked for more. If I was a richer man, I would have ordered about 4 or 5 more of these. I have never seen or heard of this but will imitate and repeat, due to my love of both mate and tequila. This drink alone made the trip a good one (the sad words of a drinker).Everything seems more expensive than it should, but it is both unique and delicious, therefore, acceptable. It was breakfast, I got potatoes and empanadas, both top notch. I wish I had about 12 of those empanadas, and I wish I got the meat laden egg sandwich. Salty side salads (not in bad way). The only complaint was the overcooked burgers, however, still delicious. I don't understand avocado fries but it doesn't seem like a good idea because YOU SHOULDN'T COOK AVOCADO. I think if you don't eat meat you should not bother; just go lay on some train tracks (absorbs iron).Cash only with ATM inside. Haters gonna hate but credit cards kill small businesses. Fact.They give you a postcard with the bill. NICE TOUCH. I used to work at a place that gave you the handwritten check in an old leather-bound classic novel. Also a nice touch.

"My beau and I found ourselves here on a cloudy, post-rain Saturday afternoon for brunch.  We visited here once before and had a lovely time and although this wasn't our first pick for brunch, we were very happy to find ourselves seated at the bar again.We ordered our drinks: he got the Red Sangria which has a tremendous amount of fruit in it and is extremely tasty.  It's more than just red wine with apple chunks in it; there's a bit of fruit juice splashed in and a good helping of orange really heightens the flavor of the fruit of the wine.  I was feeling adventurous and ordered the ""El Gauchito"": a gin cocktail served with a puree of cucumber and jalapeno, a squeeze of lime juice, and a slice of cucumber as garnish.  At first taste, there is a giant wave of refreshing cucumber, then the jalapeno kicks the back of your mouth for a bit of a surprise, then finally is soothed by a burst of lime.  It is a journey for your taste buds, incredibly refreshing, and very addictive.For our appetizer we shared the ""Rabas"", which is corn-meal encrusted calamari served with fried sweet plantains (or maduros) radishes, grape tomatoes, red onions, and topped with their home-made vinagre (vinegar with various vegetables in it to alter/enhance the flavor).  This dish is awesome!  The calamari is cooked perfectly and the cornmeal crust keeps it crunchy.  The maduros and other veggies balance out the saltiness of the vinegar but do try to eat all of the ingredients at once, your mouth with thank you for it.I ordered the ""En Canzuela"" which is a baked egg dish topped with cheese and underneath is a spicy chorizo.  This dish was also topped with their home-made vinagre but since the rest of the ingredients were very rich, the vinegar flavor took a back seat.  The chorizo was spicy, the eggs were runny, and the cheese was a melted layer of happiness.  I devoured my dish and then asked for some bread to sop up some of the cheese & egg mixture leftover.  And as if the dish itself wasn't rich and flavorful enough, they serve their version of home-fries with it.  The home-fries were very tasty and did not need any condiments.  My beau ordered the ""Choripan"", which is a chorizo and peppers sandwich served on a crusty bread and paired with a mixed green salad.  This was simple, tasty, and just right.The atmosphere here is a cozy one.  Pots, pans, and old photographs adorn the walls here which give it an ""old-timey"" feel.  Very quaint and very close to the subway station.  Be prepared to either wait for seating or feel cramped, it's a small restaurant!I would absolutely go back and actually look forward to my next visit.",4.0

"A cute rustic restaurant with little charms here and there. I came here in the summer and sat in the back patio. The patio is a little cluttered, the tables and seats are a little too close together for my comfort, but thankfully, not many other couples chose to sat outside so we had a little corner to our 2 person party. When it gets kinda dark though, they turn on these pretty stringed lights that give such a romantic vibe. For DRINKS we ordered the red sangria. We were contemplating whether to order a glass each or a pitcher so we asked to taste..... and ordered the PITCHER of  sangria. I was a little tipsy by the end of the dinner, but the sangria was so worth it. It was sweet and fresh and perfect for a summer night. It came with pieces of strawberry, mango, grapes, and apples. For the APPETIZER we had the special for the day which was a balsamic-y but sweet ceviche that had proscuitto, red & yellow tomatoes, red onions, capers, and peppers. It was refreshing & a great way to start the meal. For the ENTREE we ordered the the Parrillada and shared. Perfectly medium-rare grilled short rib & rib eye, as well as chorizo came out on a wooden cutting board, accompanied by a generous helping of truffle fries that were crispy and flavorful. 2 types of sauces(?) (I can't really say sauces cus they were more of a salsa like consistency) came with the entree, and paired well with the meats. To describe the most accurately would to compare them to salsa verde & regular salsa. IN ADDITION!! to all this food, we ordered the avocado fries.. which are essentially slices of avocado that are deep fried and come with a BBQ like dipping sauce. The breading is great & the crispiness of the outside make the inside (the avocado) that much creamier and more delicious. However, thought we would get more for the $5 they were priced at. Just when I thought I could not eat anymore... we decided to order dessert (at the insistence of the hostess/waitress). She recommended the Panqueque which is a light thin crepe filled with dulce de leche and sliced bananas. Honestly, it didn't blow me away. But definitely a great ending to the wonderful dinner. One last thing I would like to suggest. As I was leaving the restaurant, my legs were insanely itchy. I have no known food allergies, and upon examination, I realized I had many... (about 15 to count) mosquito bites all over my legs. I guess this would be the only unfortunate thing about my meal here (SO BRING YOUR REPELLANT if you're dining here in the summer) However, I realize I did not even notice the mosquitoes biting me while eating... food was THAT good I guess...

Actually she can ask for real coffee! Coffee here was terrible. No better than instant. I'd mug rather get coffee from a street cart!   Their backyard garden is small and quaint with old rusty tools scattered about the walls. The trees did not provide a good enough shade for a hot sunny day.  I peeked over at another table and they were having parilla served on a chunk of tree (age rings and all)! I'm definitely going back to try some of this.",5.0
"** Brunch Review ** Although the tables were VERY cramped together in the back porch, the food was delicious. Here were the highlights and lowlights:Highlights -- we both ordered a special omlette of the day which had bacon, tomato, parmesan and spinach and it was DELISH. Ingredients were fresh, potatoes were cooked just right and the greens that came on the side were dressed really well (I pay attention to the greens on the side, something that lots of restaurants DON'T pay attention to).Our waitress was wonderful, funny and nice. There seemed to be an issue with the kitchen for the table behind us (they were complaining about the wait) but we had no issue. Special thanks to her for getting our order in and out to us!Lowlights -- this place is a bit stingy when it comes to ice/drinks. My friend ordered an iced coffee which came luke-warm with no ice. I ordered an iced tea (which had a few small cubes in it). I would have loved a second iced tea, but was never given the option to ask for it.Overall, a worthy brunch spot. Food was VERY tasty, but a few small kinks keeps it out of the 4-star range.",3.0

It was refreshing & a great way to start the meal. For the ENTREE we ordered the the Parrillada and shared. Perfectly medium-rare grilled short rib & rib eye, as well as chorizo came out on a wooden cutting board, accompanied by a generous helping of truffle fries that were crispy and flavorful. 2 types of sauces(?) (I can't really say sauces cus they were more of a salsa like consistency) came with the entree, and paired well with the meats. To describe the most accurately would to compare them to salsa verde & regular salsa. IN ADDITION!! to all this food, we ordered the avocado fries.. which are essentially slices of avocado that are deep fried and come with a BBQ like dipping sauce. The breading is great & the crispiness of the outside make the inside (the avocado) that much creamier and more delicious. However, thought we would get more for the $5 they were priced at. Just when I thought I could not eat anymore... we decided to order dessert (at the insistence of the hostess/waitress). She recommended the Panqueque which is a light thin crepe filled with dulce de leche and sliced bananas. Honestly, it didn't blow me away. But definitely a great ending to the wonderful dinner. One last thing I would like to suggest. As I was leaving the restaurant, my legs were insanely itchy. I have no known food allergies, and upon examination, I realized I had many... (about 15 to count) mosquito bites all over my legs. I guess this would be the only unfortunate thing about my meal here (SO BRING YOUR REPELLANT if you're dining here in the summer) However, I realize I did not even notice the mosquitoes biting me while eating... food was THAT good I guess... Bravo El Almacen!",5.0
"My favorite brunch spot.The food is always great, the stuff is very friendly, the decor is beautiful, it's just a great place.I've been there for dinner a couple of times, and it's also really wonderful though a bit pricey for a casual dinner. Try the Cazuela, and the lomito completo sandwich, great bloody merry to.",5.0

I took my boyfriend here for his birthday on 5/13/14 and the service was excellent. The food and presentation was fantastic. I am looking forward to visiting them again. In closing please try the white sangria its so good.,5.0
"I love the food here- literally, I salivate when I think about it.I don't love seeing managers yell at their staff members, which I've witnessed on more than one occasion. So, if the owner(s) is reading this- allowing this kind of juvenile degradation of your staff to occur within the public eye is TERRIBLE FOR BUSINESS.Get it together so I can feel good about coming back here!",2.0
"The brunch food here is absolutely perfect! We ordered the huevos rancheros, avocado fries, steak empanadas, and the ribeye and eggs. Everything was perrrfect! The beef was juicy and flavorful, the eggs perfectly runny, the fries not overly greasy, the empanadas were empanada-y! What more can a girl ask for on a Sunday morning. Actually she can ask for real coffee! Coffee here was terrible. No better than instant. I'd mug rather get coffee from a street cart!   Their backyard garden is small and quaint with old rusty tools scattered about the walls. The trees did not provide a good enough shade for a hot sunny day.  I peeked over at another table and they were having parilla served on a chunk of tree (age rings and all)! I'm definitely going back to try some of this.",5.0
"** Brunch Review ** Although the tables were VERY cramped together in the back porch, the food was delicious. Here were the highlights and lowlights:Highlights -- we both ordered a special omlette of the day which had bacon, tomato, parmesan and spinach and it was DELISH. Ingredients were fresh, potatoes were cooked just right and the greens that came on the side were dressed really well (I pay attention to the greens on the side, something that lots of restaurants DON'T pay attention to).Our waitress was wonderful, funny and nice. There seemed to be an issue with the kitchen for the table behind us (they were complaining about the wait) but we had no issue. Special thanks to her for getting our order in and out to us!Lowlights -- this place is a bit stingy when it comes to ice/drinks. My friend ordered an iced coffee which came luke-warm with no ice. I ordered an iced tea (which had a few small cubes in it). I would have loved a second iced tea, but was never given the option to ask for it.Overall, a worthy brunch spot. Food was VERY tasty, but a few small kinks keeps it out of the 4-star range.",3.0
I'll make this short and sweet. Been here for both dinner and brunch and for both I am a fan.

"Good food,  good atmosphere, and on balance, good service.One caveat, don't be late for your reservation or you will be scolded.  A hostess told us we were late and our table was given to someone else.  She even told us she knew we would be late.  We were put outside in the very hot weather.  When people left we asked for a table inside but we were told we could not have such a table, but one was ready at our reservation time.  I will say this is a comment on one hostess, not service overall.  This happened two summers ago, so it may not happen again.Don't be concerned you have to order red meat, as is the case in some other Argentine restaurants.  There is plenty on the menu if that is not your fancy.",4.0
"I recently vowed to cook more at home with enough portions to pack for lunch. How has that worked out for me? It hasn't. I haven't made dinner in over 2 weeks O_O Fatty1: I'm hungry. Let's eat.Fatty2: Me too. Let's. Where should we go? It has to be good food.Fatty1: Give me a neighborhood.Fatty2: Williamsburg. A place we both haven't gone to.Suggestions were made and we even thought of hitting our personal fav spots but we ended up here. Conveniently right outside L train Bedford stop.  Like many of you, I have a checklist. Mine consists of restaurants and bars I pass by when walking around or ones I've read about or heard of. It's an extremely long list... and last night I got to check off El Almacen. Why it took me more than a year to try this place out, I have no clue. But I'm glad I finally freakin' did. It was great!To start, we had ceviche mixto and grilled sweetbreads, special of the night. The ceviche of shrimp and octopus which came with 2 fresh oysters were just okay. The grilled sweetbreads were amazing. It came with minced tomatoes, onions, parsley with a touch of lime.  This accompaniment balanced the richness of the sweetbreads. I could eat another plateful of those. YUMMMM!!! I had the braised short rib dish called costilla de res. It was lovely. Served over mashed potatoes with brussel sprouts. Flavorful and tender. This dish however was on the sweet side. Hence, I was yearning for more brussel sprouts instead of a number leaves scattered on the dish. The slight bitterness of sprouts would've balanced the flavors better. I also got to try the pappardelle con rabo and churros with caramel and chocolate dip. They were good as well.  Oh and I almost forgot about the avocado fries. They were bangin'! Panko crusted on the outside, rich and creamy inside. Came with a bbq dipping sauce which worked well. YUMMMM!!!Impromptu dining is the best. I don't expect too much from the experience so when it all goes well, I end up happy and smiling ear to ear.  This is exactly what happened at El Almacen. With good food, great ambiance and great service, without a doubt I will come back.Note: Cash only; has a communal table for 8 in the back garden.The portions are enough for sharing.

Then she looks at me funny ( as if ""Ughh, i don't know if we can seat you"") But she grabs some menus and brings us over to the last table of the restaurant, the one before you go outside to their garden seating. I wanted to ask her if we could be seated outside, but she disappeared before we got the chance to even sit down.The rest of the night went pretty okay. The waitress was alright.  The portions were small for the price you pay. Also towards the end, my dad was debating whether or not to try the Mate. I told him he probably would not like it cause its bitter tea ( Ive had it in Argentina when I studied abroad) But i said let me ask the waitress if they have any different Mate flavors. Cause in Argentina they had an Orange flavor which tastes delicious and the taste isn't so bitter.So I ask the waitress, and she seemed confused as if to say, ""No we dont have any other flavors."" So I proceeded to tell her that mate comes in different flavors such as orange, and she then said in what seemed to be an annoyed tone, ""Oh I dunno, all we have is that"". So i was like okay. And we ordered dessert. We had the banana one. It was very good. Only  that its tiny. On our way out, my brother went outside to the garden area to check it out, and he was like come here so I could see it too. At that moment a hostess passed by escorting a dinner party down to the outdoor tables, and she verbally pushed us out of the way.

"This place is known for their steak and I'm not really sure why. We ordered the porter house ($65) medium rare and it arrived overcooked. While it had some decent flavor (thanks to salt served on the side and chimichurri), it was pretty chewy and dry. The chorizo that was served with the meat was tough as well and the truffle fries were under seasoned. What was great was the ceviche, beet salad, cocktails and ambiance. I'd go back but not order steak as my entree. In fact I'd been twice before and had the fish specials which I enjoyed much more. Summary: yummy apps and cocktails, cute place, not great steak. Disclaimer: if you go on a Saturday night, get there before 8pm if you'd like to sit right away. Otherwise, expect at least an hour wait.",3.0
"I give this place 5 stars for ambience0 stars for food0 stars for serviceWow, this place is terrible1. Appetizer: We ordered the Ceviche Mixto and it tasted like low tide in Jamaica Bay without the charm. They also served a ""Toast"" that was the leftover bread from the last week sliced thinly. The oysters...i think we are going to die. Tasted like rancid bad. I really think we might die. 2.Entrees- Me: had the Paella which was a repeat of the appetizer but a little saltier and seemed as though it had festered in the sun for a while. They also served bread that was probably going to become the ""Toast"" in a few days to be served with the ""Ceviche Mixto""Him: The Ribeye. $28 dollars. Tastied like $4 steak from C-Town. 60% fat. They love the truffle oil here. I suspect it also comes from C-town.The Sangria--sub parDid not even attempt to try the desert. Felt nauseous.Cash only.

"Smooth, sexy, sleek and inviting, I popped into El Almacen after I was abruptly turned away from The Brooklyn Winery since I was about 20 mins early for the Elite event that night. A little bummed, and waiting for my friend Natalia O. I walked down the street and found El Almacen's inviting windows with Queseria hand painted on the windows. I asked to sit at the bar for a drink and maybe a little food. I was warmly welcomed and promptly served with a wine list and a nice suggestion based on my taste. A nice red coupled with chips and guacamole, it was the perfect pre-Elite Event snack.The atmosphere is dark, calm and alluring.

The service is laid back and attentive and the decor is beautiful. Though the cliantele is mostly young hipsters when I brought my parents they had a great time. I love this place!,5.0
"Smooth, sexy, sleek and inviting, I popped into El Almacen after I was abruptly turned away from The Brooklyn Winery since I was about 20 mins early for the Elite event that night. A little bummed, and waiting for my friend Natalia O. I walked down the street and found El Almacen's inviting windows with Queseria hand painted on the windows. I asked to sit at the bar for a drink and maybe a little food. I was warmly welcomed and promptly served with a wine list and a nice suggestion based on my taste. A nice red coupled with chips and guacamole, it was the perfect pre-Elite Event snack.The atmosphere is dark, calm and alluring. It's perfect for a romantic night for two or a glass of wine and a good book. A little pricey but, it all comes together nicely. Definitely recommended.",3.0
"I've been here twice now and have always wondered why I don't come back more often.I don't usually eat a lot of meat, but when my carnivorous side gets a hold of me this is a great place to tame it.I've gotten the same thing both times; blood sausage with a side of brussel sprouts. I die. The sausage is small in size, but has big, rich flavor If it were any bigger it would probably be gross. And the brussel  sprouts are perfectly roasted and seasoned. The service and staff were friendly and attentive. I love the decor. I will definitely make more attempts to come back.",4.0
"YES! Wandering around Williamsburg on Valentine's Day, looking for a nice place to eat dinner, we stumbled upon El Almacen, literally one block from the Bedford L train. It was an intimate, candle-lit atmosphere, with complimentary champagne for the holiday. We got a bottle of wine and started with a cheese plate. The Aji Relleno made a great main course, and afterward we found ourselves pleasantly full and slightly sloshed. For a cozy date spot, El Almacen is not terribly expensive, but it is cash only. There's an ATM in the back in case you forget!",5.0
"A friend of mine took me here a few weekends ago when I came to Williamsburg to check out the area and see an apartment that I was thinking of moving into.  As soon as we walked in, I felt at home.  It's small, intimate and cozy... not to mention packed, which is a good sign!  We had to wait about 10 minutes for a table since it was a Saturday night and we found a spot at the bar and ordered a pitcher of Sangria.  The bartender misunderstood us and only poured two glasses instead of setting us up with a pitcher.  We mentioned it to her that we wanted a pitcher and she apologized, made us a pitcher and then told us she wouldn't charge us for the two glasses she initially poured - that was very nice!  We sat down and although the tables are small and close together, it  managed to feel intimate.  The music was Spanish and amazing as well and all of the waitresses had accents.  We asked ours where she was from and she's actually from Argentina.  Gotta love it when the employees are authentic.  I ordered the corn-fed pork chop with carmalized apples and vanilla glaze.  My friend ordered the lamp chops with chipotle BBQ - both dishes were fantastic!!  We also ordered the avocado fries and shishito peppers to start, both of which were amazing!  We ended up hanging out until they were about to close, it was that great of an atmosphere.  I fell in love with this place and so last night I went back into Williamsburg with another friend of mine and took her there to share the experience.This time, I ordered the short-rib with malbec reduction, oh my!  The meat just fell off the bone and it was served with a mashed potato dish that tasted a little bit like sweet potatoes.  My friend ordered the chicken roulade stuffed with spinach and proscuitto which was also delicious.  We had a bottle of Malbec with for $32 was a terrific value for the way it tasted.  Again, the music was amazing and the waitress was adorable.  This is already a favorite.The best part?  When the bill came it was $81!!  For two people to eat an entree each, 2 apps and a bottle of wine.  Can't beat that!  Another cute thing they do, is hand you the bill paper clipped to a postcard that has El Almacen on it with pictures of horseback riders.  I've been saving the postcards and plan to make some sort of collage out of them, they are very cute.  I can't wait to go back!!",5.0
"The stuffed poblano is the perfect dish for a white vegetarian like myself. I don't like spicy, so when I eat a cooked pepper I feel like a bad ass. I can look like a tough guy who eats spicy peppers, without the heartburn. Sometimes a seed will creep into a bite and I get burnt, but they're easy to avoid. The churros with dipping sauce are good for desert too.",5.0
"First impressions mean a lot to me. If something rubs me the right or wrong way within those first moments of meeting a new person or trying something new, it's definitely going to shape the rest of my experience. That said, upon walking into El Almacen I was taken by how warm and cozy the decor was. It was a lovely looking place and obviously a lot of thought had gone into the layout . The waitress smiled and told us to sit wherever we wanted. Oh good, the staff is pleasant and easy going-- check! We were still getting situated and taking our coats off when the bartender/owner/manager (Honestly I have no idea who she was, but she seemed in charge) rushed over and pointed to a bottle of seltzer on the table that my friend had been carrying with her. Keep in mind, this was on the table along with her purse and other things one might set on the table as they are JUST SITTING DOWN. With the cuntiest scowl I had ever seen,  she pointed at the bottle and said ""what is this?"" And in an extremely passive aggressive, almost sarcastic manner, asked if we would like her to pour it for us. This is where we almost walked out. The fucking nerve of this person. I'll never understand why some new businesses feel they can treat their patrons like shit. I figured someone was having a bad day or maybe an exceptionally heavy flow. Whatever, I'll give it a chance. But only because our actual waitress was a sweetheart and I was fucking starving.So on to the food. There's not much to say about it, so I won't write much. We ordered the guacamole appetizer first. It was very tasty, if not very small. The steak for two was just ok. A bit undercooked for medium rare, if you ask me. The potatoes were very dry, as was the sausage. Overall, I would give the food 3 stars, but that lady rubbed me so wrong this place gets one shitty star.

A group of us went to eat at this place and we were not aware that you needed to make reservations to eat brunch since most all places in Williamsburg do not take reservations at brunch time.  The person managing the place that day was not the least bit accomodating to us and treated us as he could not be bothered.  It seemed like we were annoying him with wanting support his business.  I wonder if the owneres of the place know that this is happening or do they not care when hiring.  He did not offer to put our name on the list.  We had to ask him to place our name on the list and he seemed to not want to do it.  So we all left and went to Walters Food which treated us like paying customers.  I have heard from several friends that the food might be good but the service is not great or friendly. I would even go as far as saying that they rather cater to a specific race in their establishment but can't be sure.  I hope they make changes to their staff sooner rather than later because eventually it will affect their business.,1.0

"This place is solid. I went for the second time last night and while it was still cash only, we enjoyed ourselves. The food was delicious!  We started with the special appetizer which was ribs with a sweet and spicy barbecue sauce and a piece of corn that had what I hope was cheese on the outside of it. It was INCREDIBLE. That corn was INCREDIBLE!   We also split the avocado fries which were tasty. For dinner we had the enchiladas and the stuffed chicken with mashed potatoes. Both were delicious! The enchiladas had a great taste to them.  We didn't get dessert, but I had a cup of coffee and it was just as good. The atmosphere is very cute and perfect for a date, or even a smallish gathering with a friend.  My friend and I sat next to a film crew from Argentina that asked us to taste some of the food they were sampling and tell them what we thought. It was hilarious and who knows, I could be famous in Argentina in a few months. It was fun!",4.0

"Um...excuse me? I'm still in Brooklyn, right? No? Yes?Restaurants like El Almacen remind me why Williamsburg rocks, why I HEART NYC. I don't have to go on vacation because I can walk into places like this and be on vacay. It's the ultimate staycation. So, I walk in and it's very cute, romantic but since I was with my BFF, we'll leave the romance out. (Side note: We cut out of Vutera b/c their garden screamed of sweet-whispered nothings, gazing into each other's eyes and hand-holding. Gah!) So yeah, you can do that here too but at least you don't feel compelled to.  Anyway, the backyard is lovely and left me feeling that I could have a lot of fun here with bottles of vino and my bestest friends or that special someone. It walks the line well. It's a twofer! Yay!The food is delicious. Based on reviews here and by our server, Rachel, I went with the Entrana. It's deserving of the praise and I do believe it melts like butter in your mouth, well that could be all the butter its swathered in but mmmm, mmmm, mmmm. My friend had the Tilapia and judging by how quick that was finished, I gather she enjoyed it and thought it was tasty. Appetizers were chips and guoc and they were solid. The wine was excellent especially for the price! We got a bottle of the Hacienda di Playa 2007.Deliciously buzzed, we moved inside to listen to the live music. I wouldn't say it was the best band. They were doing their best to acoustically cover 70s rock songs. That's when I knew I was on vacay b/c it's terrible to listen to it in your own country but when vacationing, you get into it. The crowd of Argentinian expats were and if I had one of those special Cola drinks, I would've been singing along with them.Another thing to love: The ridiculously HOT staff and owners. I think the night I came in, the owner's friends were there too and though they were not equally as good-looking, their proximity definitely made it feel that way. FYI-Someone needs to warn a girl about this before she goes in after walking 5 miles through Brooklyn! So reader, you're duly warned. Hot people in this place so don't go in with a deflated ego or gawk. Oh and bring cash b/c they don't take card. I don't know why people complain so much about that.

"Really enjoyed my time at this restaurant. A friend and I were able to stop in on a weekday night and grab an impromptu table without too much fuss.

"I went with my husband and mother in lawWe sat at the bar waiting for a table: 2 very Small Margaritas $30!! Everything seems more expensive than it should. Appetizers: Fried avocado, not my preference, it mostly tastes like breading and the BBQ sauce they give you to dip it in.Rabas: Very small pieces of calamaretti. Rabas should be big rings of calamari like in Argentina (or like bone Fish in Bermuda!!! )My husband asked for the entrania: the meat was RAW. We didn't notice at first because the darkness of the place, but when my husband started chewing his face told me everything. We used the IPhone flashlight app and OMG it was RAW RAW, way far from rare! There is NO WAY that was 10oz and COLD. The mashed potatoes cold as a salad.My order was wrong, so I had to wait 15 more minutes for my dish. The milanesa was good, but COLD. The mashed potatoes COLD. The eggs were COLD.My mother in law ate enchiladas. Provably it was her fault to ask for a Mexican dish in an Argentinean restaurant, but still, if you are going to do it, do it right. They were soggy and tasteless. And COLD.We had to ask twice for a basket of bread, everyone got their bread basket but us. And the bread wasn't the nice crispy French bread they use in Argentina.The girl at the bar was very nice, the waitress too as the buzz boy, none of them were from Argentina.

"This place is solid. I went for the second time last night and while it was still cash only, we enjoyed ourselves. The food was delicious!  We started with the special appetizer which was ribs with a sweet and spicy barbecue sauce and a piece of corn that had what I hope was cheese on the outside of it. It was INCREDIBLE. That corn was INCREDIBLE!   We also split the avocado fries which were tasty. For dinner we had the enchiladas and the stuffed chicken with mashed potatoes. Both were delicious! The enchiladas had a great taste to them.  We didn't get dessert, but I had a cup of coffee and it was just as good. The atmosphere is very cute and perfect for a date, or even a smallish gathering with a friend.  My friend and I sat next to a film crew from Argentina that asked us to taste some of the food they were sampling and tell them what we thought. It was hilarious and who knows, I could be famous in Argentina in a few months. It was fun!",4.0

"Um...excuse me? I'm still in Brooklyn, right? No? Yes?Restaurants like El Almacen remind me why Williamsburg rocks, why I HEART NYC. I don't have to go on vacation because I can walk into places like this and be on vacay. It's the ultimate staycation. So, I walk in and it's very cute, romantic but since I was with my BFF, we'll leave the romance out. (Side note: We cut out of Vutera b/c their garden screamed of sweet-whispered nothings, gazing into each other's eyes and hand-holding. Gah!) So yeah, you can do that here too but at least you don't feel compelled to.  Anyway, the backyard is lovely and left me feeling that I could have a lot of fun here with bottles of vino and my bestest friends or that special someone. It walks the line well. It's a twofer! Yay!The food is delicious. Based on reviews here and by our server, Rachel, I went with the Entrana. It's deserving of the praise and I do believe it melts like butter in your mouth, well that could be all the butter its swathered in but mmmm, mmmm, mmmm. My friend had the Tilapia and judging by how quick that was finished, I gather she enjoyed it and thought it was tasty. Appetizers were chips and guoc and they were solid. The wine was excellent especially for the price! We got a bottle of the Hacienda di Playa 2007.Deliciously buzzed, we moved inside to listen to the live music. I wouldn't say it was the best band. They were doing their best to acoustically cover 70s rock songs. That's when I knew I was on vacay b/c it's terrible to listen to it in your own country but when vacationing, you get into it. The crowd of Argentinian expats were and if I had one of those special Cola drinks, I would've been singing along with them.Another thing to love: The ridiculously HOT staff and owners. I think the night I came in, the owner's friends were there too and though they were not equally as good-looking, their proximity definitely made it feel that way. FYI-Someone needs to warn a girl about this before she goes in after walking 5 miles through Brooklyn! So reader, you're duly warned. Hot people in this place so don't go in with a deflated ego or gawk. Oh and bring cash b/c they don't take card. I don't know why people complain so much about that.

I understand this, I worked in a small family rest. in E. Vill for three years. However, still ruined my time. I was treating myself, a rare thing, and had almost a perfect experience.

The first time I came here I came for a birthday dinner before we went to dance. no reservation needed for a group less that 5 people.  It is a small place with lots of tables so you seat pretty closed to your neighbor. it also gets pretty crowded and you might have to wait a bit for a table. They have a small deck and a patio so if the weather is nice try to seat out there plus you get more elbow room. The only thing I dont like about the patio is the leaves from the tree failing on your food. its not something that happens all the time so dont worry.

They were the kind of thing I could have eaten 20 of.To eat, my wife got the Aji Relleno, which was perfectly done. Warning that it is a tad spicy, which I love, but just so you know. I ordered the Costilla de Res (braised short rib and Brussel sprouts over boniato puree). The boniato was so creamy, and the short rib was so tender and was so devoid of fat (maybe just one tiny piece) that everything just went well together. So we batted 3 for 3 on food, can't complain.On top of that, the service was great. As all restaurants should do, we were given an old wine bottle full of water for the table. As Latin/South American food can get spicy, you always want some water around. The staff was attentive and filled out glasses for us (we never touched the bottle).

I didn't even realize this was possible with squid, which made me a very very happy camper. I can't stand gummy seafood! It was tangy, and the sauce it came in was not a traditional lemon/lime/water/oil mixture.. it was thicker.. I wish i could figure out what it was exactly- all I know is that it was delicious. I think they put tomato sauce in it. Actually, it was the best ceviche I've ever had. The appetizer portions were small, I was left wanting a little bit more- then again, I'm a hog.I ordered the pork ribs as my entree and the presentation was great! they came on a huge chopping block with corn on the cob, rolled in sweet cornmeal, and an avocado and tomato salad on a bed of lettuce. My entree filled the void that the small appetizer portion had left. The service is a bit slow, which is surprising because it's such a tiny place, but the ambiance and the food made up for it. It's very intimate and dim- perfect for a relaxed, slow-paced evening. I'd definitely dine here again.",4.0
"Nice atmosphere and great food. I went with my wife and another couple. We ordered octopus salad and meat and fish tacos as apetizer and they were amazing. After this one order of parrillada was enough for the four of us. The parrillada was perfect and tha sauces were superb! Also, they have several very good Malbecs which paired the meat to perfection.  The price was really reasonable. Four stars well deserved.",4.0

"I FINALLY got my butt out to Williamsburg on a nice sunny winter day. We had actually gone with the purpose of eating at Egg but it was PACKED so we headed here. Really cute, small, rustic decor, and on weekends not only is there a brunch menu to order from, but you can also order anything from the regular menu. Servers were all very friendly, quick to make suggestions, and I'm pretty sure they were all native Spanish speakers (this is an Argentinian restaurant after all!) I LOVED this place, loved the food. We shared empanadas to start out, one order came with two; one spinach, cheese and corn, and the other with hand cut steak. It also came with a chimichurri dipping sauce which was amazingly delicious. The empanadas themselves were really good, with a thicker sort of crust. Since I am a huge hater of eggs I ordered from the regular menu; - Entrana 10oz skirt steak, potato gratin, criolla It came with two different sauces, a chimichurri and another type of salsa, and also came with a little mound of coarse salt on the side. The steak was absolutely tender, soft, juicy, bloody, so satisfying, I was (surprisingly) able to eat the entire plate (and it was pretty darn big!). The avocado mashed potatoes were so interesting and complimented the steak very nicely. Okay, maybe it was all so good I forced myself to eat the entire plate. My only problem was the steak was just warm- not that hot, and also that it is CASH ONLY. But other than that I LOVED the meal, loved the restaurant and would come back here to try the rest of the menu any day of the week. Also, the dessert looked SO delicious, too bad I was way too full to eat another bite at that point.",4.0
"Probably the best meal in Williamsburg in all of my 10 years living here. This is a gem in a neighborhood over run with countless restaurants that do not deliver to be as good as they claim to be. Along comes El Almacen and surpasses all of my expectations.Atmosphere: Very cozy - great for groups as well as a romantic dinner. Very lively and social (as well as packed) on a Saturday night.Food & Wine: Had the Argentinian Pinot Noir - absolutely delicious and smooth. Words cannot describe the Ceviche de Hamachi - just bursted with the perfect combination of flavors and melted in my mouth. The Entrana Skirt Steak entree was perfect! It came with chimichurri and some other kind of dipping sauce and a side of a green spicy mashed potato (believe it was watercress..?). For dessert I had the flan and which was topped with passionfruit and was creamy and not too sweet. All in all, a very satisfying and excellent meal. Will be back for more!",5.0
"Put it this way - I wore badge shorts and my waitress spilt a little Sangria on me while she was sturring at the table's edge (not to smart to begin with) and I am giving it a 5.  The few dots did not remain and I was given club soda to apply.  The Octopus for starters were amazing and the Empeladas as well.  As far as the meat, well you can tell it is Argentinian steak - rib eye, skirt steak and shell steak - all amazing! Dessert - well let's just say you could consider this a dessert cafe if you happen to be in the neighborhood eating at a place that may not serve the best after dinner treats.  Take a seat in the back garden underneath grape vines and an array of landscape that sets your night up to be a most memorable one and enjoy any of the desserts on the menu - may have been the best part!!",5.0
"my main reason for giving El Almacen 4 stars is VALUEif you're looking to eat a good piece of meat and not have to spend half your paycheck, this is the place to go!- we ordered the parrillada, and it was great! good cuts of meat and the chorizo and morcilla were surprisingly tasty- as sides, truffle fries and yes, the AVOCADO FRIES, which are as magical as they sound!- finally, dessert. and since we were 3, we of course had to order 3 desserts. all were yummy!!! the churros, the chocolate molten cake and special bread pudding with mango sauce were the perfect end to a delicious meal.great ambiance as well, dim and cozy. great for a date or dinner with friends!I will be back!",4.0
"It takes a whole lot to impress me when it comes to food, and during a recent stop in this Brooklyn Argentinean restaurant, this place did not disappoint.  Based on a whim, another foodie friend and I went to this place hoping for something reasonably priced and delicious.  After a few scours of the area, we ended up here.  We ordered the avocado fries, guacamole, and the Parrillada.   We were seated in the back area outside seating, which is pretty, although not necessarily so functional with the evergreens that tend to shed on your plate if a wind blows through.  The avocado fries, ingenious, was very good.  Breaded in what seemed like panko breading, was rather delicious.  The guacamole was rather interesting, with a slight bacon aftertaste.  The big winner however was the parrillada, which consisted rib eye, short rib, chorizo, and fries, ordered up medium rare, as we requested it, and it was DELICIOUS!Always order the grilled meat at an Argentinean restaurant.  We shared the meat plate and it did not disappoint.  The taste was subtle and wonderfully juicy and flavorful.  The price was also really reasonable at $38 for the plate.  This is a serious date spot and will generally be busy whenever you go.  A great sign of good business.",5.0
"I have walked by this cute little restaurant hundreds of times and for whatever reason had not checked it out until last night.  I was pleasantly surprised- there are not many reasonably priced, cute places to go on a date around this area (you must go south into Tabare' territory for something like that).   The steak was succulent, the ceviche was good but nothing amazing.  If you go here, definitely order one of the steaks and wash it down with one of the many excellent Malbecs on the menu.",4.0

"Holy hell. Holy hell. Holy hell. If I could give this place negative stars I would.  I can not even begin to describe how awful this place is.  I really am disgusted!!!We waited for over an hour for our food.  The waitress kept saying ""five minutes"" and informed us that it wasn't her fault.  The people sitting behind us who got seated about the same time we did, got their dinner and even had dessert while we still waited for our dinner.  We all got steaks and when they finally arrived they were cold.  Honestly, I really wish I could say that waiting forever for cold food was the worst of the experience but unfortunately the worst was yet to come. Within minutes after getting our ""food"" there was an overwhelming stench of vomit permeating the back room where we were seated.  The girl sitting at a table next to us threw up (probably from the disgusting food she ingested)!! One would think that they would offer to move us to another table, or something.  But all they did was move the vomit around with a mop hence spreading the smell out even more intensely.  I can not express this statement enough THERE WAS VOMIT ALL OVER THE FLOOR OF THE BACK ROOM...HOOOOORRRRIIIIBBBBBLLLEEEE.  Needless to say my table of peeps obviously lost their appetite and asked to leave immediately.  They gave us our bill IN FULL....I'm sorry but honestly If I'm at Chucky Cheese or some other children's restaurant where vomiting is accepted that's fine...but for an ""authentic Argentinian"" grown up dining establishement, I don't expect to have to deal with vomit.Since most of us had barely touched our food we expected to at least have some portion of bill taken care of but all they offered was to wrap it up for us to take home (mmmmmm yeah that sounds nice, I'd love to go home and curl up with the cold vomit steak).In conclusion...If you enjoy waiting over an hour for half-ass steak and vomit on the floor, by all means come to El Almacen!!!P.S.

For dinner we had the Entrana, a perfectly prepared skirt steak with chimichurro sauce and accomanied with a nice polenta. All was superb. The others had the ribs which were great and they were complimented with a tomato and avocado salad and grilled corn. We got a side of Avocado fries and grilled corn, both superb.

"Came here with the bf on a date while revisiting some of our old Brooklyn haunts. I want to stress something right from the beginning: the food and wine was great. In fact, I didn't feel that it was overpriced at all! The outdoor patio was nice too. Service, however, was terrible and did not do the great location and skillfully prepared food any favors. It is for this reason that I had to take one star away.  We shared a hearts of palm, red cabbage, and endive salad with truffle vinaigrette and  cheese. The flavors all fit perfectly together, with just the right balance of each ingredient. I had the stuffed pepper with spinach, cheese, and rice and beans. It was just the right amount of food, so that I felt satisfied but not stuffed. All of the ingredients tasted fresh. However, here are some service no-no's:1. The hostess seated us at a horribly cramped table squeezed in next to an obnoxiously loud group of people when there were many other un-occupied two tops in more intimate settings. 2. The waitress was not capable of offering a useful wine description. When you have four different malbecs by the glass, it would be nice to be able to help your customer differentiate between them. She obviously had no clue about any of them. 3. After ordering, our waitress disappeared. We saw her once more when it was time for the check.

I ate here last weekend for an early dinner with a date and I was impressed. The decor is the usual willy b hipster friendly shabby chic style--you know random old looking shit and a few chairs glued to the ceiling. The gal wasn't hungry so we just ordered two appetizers and a main. The beef rib tacos were spot on but I wasn't a fan of the ceviche hamachi...I'm not too keen on anything remotely fishy and the ceviche had the slightest hint of it that wasn't appealing to me. For the main I had the Malbec braised short rib...let me tell you that fucker was insanely good. The meat was juicy and tender and the whole mashed potato like starchy mixture it sat on soaked up all those juices perfectly. I'll be back!,4.0

this place is greatttttt. Definatly need reservations. We waited about one hour.. very small pace. The drinks very cheap and quite strong. The sangria was ok had better. The skirt steak was delish and it was served on this block with green mash potato. I had the stuff pepper. no meat stuffed with rice and black bean delish.. the empanadas stuffed with spinach and cheese was DEVINE... Let down on dessert the dulce de leche was pasty... but overall love this place,5.0
"The atmosphere is adorable. The menu is reasonably prices and the food was to DIE for. I had the prime rib, cooked to perfection. The truffle fries were insane perfectly cooked. Two sauces came on the side. I have no idea what they were but they were amazing. The guac was beyond fresh, chips were good. Also the Margs are insane. My only complain is the cash only. The ATM simply didn't give me money the first transaction for no reason at all. So thats one transaction, then i had to check to make sure there wasn't a problem with the bank account ( 2 transactions) only to find out there was no reason the ATM didn't give me money the first time. SO 3rd transaction actually took the money. SO i ended up spending a good 6$ on ATM fee's which i think is somewhat sketchy. Also the ATM was beyond loud so I felt bad that i had to disrupt the people eating in that area. The waitress was a little snobby for my taste. I get it you live in brooklyn and work at a cool restaurant - lose the tude. She only came by once to see if we needed anything and took our guac and chips before we were done without asking.   That was the biggest downfall to the experience she really just had a bad attitude and made us feel like she was DYING for us to leave. I can honestly say the food was amazing. I would go back to eat to spite the cash only and waitress I wont let one bad apple spoil it for me.",3.0
"El Almacen is so cute and cozy - perfect atmosphere and delicious food.  I am usually not one for your typical Spanish fare - empanadas, guacamole, etc.  But not here!  The food was amazing and I am hoping to head back soon for brunch.  I am excited to have another ""go-to"" spot in the burg - although the secret is definitely out about this place.    This place is - do I dare say - trendy and more of a hot spot rather then your local hangout.  My roommate and I went on a Sat night - we live about 5 seconds away and just rolled up there in chill clothes (it was a snowday afterall - however we were the only people not dressed in our Saturday night's best.)   We get there, and there are no tables available and it seemed one wouldn't open up for a while so we sat a the bar, scarfed down our food, and left.

The decor is the usual willy b hipster friendly shabby chic style--you know random old looking shit and a few chairs glued to the ceiling. The gal wasn't hungry so we just ordered two appetizers and a main. The beef rib tacos were spot on but I wasn't a fan of the ceviche hamachi...I'm not too keen on anything remotely fishy and the ceviche had the slightest hint of it that wasn't appealing to me. For the main I had the Malbec braised short rib...let me tell you that fucker was insanely good. The meat was juicy and tender and the whole mashed potato like starchy mixture it sat on soaked up all those juices perfectly. I'll be back!,4.0

"I had been anticipating the opening of El Almacen for months and months (and months and months and months) and it was so worth the wait!Everything our party of six had was incredible - for starters, the ceviche de bif was mouth-watering, as was a roasted beet salad.The empanadas were um...delicious.Main courses, such as possibly the best chicken enchiladas con salsa verde i've ever eaten, pasta with coffee braised oxtail and chicken milanesa were all completely...you guessed it, delicious.Plus, the restaurant is just so cozy.  Everybody go here; you won't want to leave.",5.0
"AMAZING! This place definitely lives up to the hype as the space, food and service are all top notch. It's so cosy inside, the perfect place to be on a cold winter night when it's freezing outside. We ordered a bunch of food to share but I would definitely recommend the cava with strawberries as a drink, together with the ceviche hamachi (wow), avocado fries, chicken empanada, beet salad and shishito peppers. Winner by far!!!",5.0
"If you like steak, then you need to go here. It's a nice ""hole in the wall"" in that you wouldn't tell it's a good restaurant until you have a dining experience here. The restaurant has other items than steak.Definitely try the avocado fries, you will not disappointed, promise.Service is great, seems like every staffer will stop by your table and ask if everything is ok.My only knocks with the place are that there is only one bathroom, and it's a cash only spot, but they do have an ATM.",4.0
"Like steak?  Definitely check out El Almacen.  It can get crowded, but when the weather's right and the patio is open. . .aaaaahhhhh.  Can't be beat.The ceviche is excellent but people come here for the steak.  The steak fries in truffle oil aren't too bad, either.They serve a dessert here, I forget the name of it but it's like a crepe with fried banana slices on top and dulce de leche in the middle. . .it is beyond delicious.  Un-friggin-real!Brunch is pretty good, too.  French toast like you have not seen before.Check it out.  Soon.I had to take a star because they are cash only.  there is an ATM in the back of the restaurant, but I feel like every place should take card these days.  Just a preference.",4.0
this place is greatttttt. Definatly need reservations. We waited about one hour.. very small pace. The drinks very cheap and quite strong. The sangria was ok had better. The skirt steak was delish and it was served on this block with green mash potato. I had the stuff pepper. no meat stuffed with rice and black bean delish.. the empanadas stuffed with spinach and cheese was DEVINE... Let down on dessert the dulce de leche was pasty... but overall love this place,5.0
"The atmosphere is adorable. The menu is reasonably prices and the food was to DIE for. I had the prime rib, cooked to perfection. The truffle fries were insane perfectly cooked. Two sauces came on the side. I have no idea what they were but they were amazing. The guac was beyond fresh, chips were good. Also the Margs are insane. My only complain is the cash only. The ATM simply didn't give me money the first transaction for no reason at all. So thats one transaction, then i had to check to make sure there wasn't a problem with the bank account ( 2 transactions) only to find out there was no reason the ATM didn't give me money the first time. SO 3rd transaction actually took the money. SO i ended up spending a good 6$ on ATM fee's which i think is somewhat sketchy. Also the ATM was beyond loud so I felt bad that i had to disrupt the people eating in that area. The waitress was a little snobby for my taste. I get it you live in brooklyn and work at a cool restaurant - lose the tude. She only came by once to see if we needed anything and took our guac and chips before we were done without asking.   That was the biggest downfall to the experience she really just had a bad attitude and made us feel like she was DYING for us to leave. I can honestly say the food was amazing. I would go back to eat to spite the cash only and waitress I wont let one bad apple spoil it for me.",3.0
"El Almacen is so cute and cozy - perfect atmosphere and delicious food.  I am usually not one for your typical Spanish fare - empanadas, guacamole, etc.  But not here!  The food was amazing and I am hoping to head back soon for brunch.  I am excited to have another ""go-to"" spot in the burg - although the secret is definitely out about this place.    This place is - do I dare say - trendy and more of a hot spot rather then your local hangout.  My roommate and I went on a Sat night - we live about 5 seconds away and just rolled up there in chill clothes (it was a snowday afterall - however we were the only people not dressed in our Saturday night's best.)   We get there, and there are no tables available and it seemed one wouldn't open up for a while so we sat a the bar, scarfed down our food, and left.

"I rarely get an opportunity to venture into Williamburg, so finding a place like this was, most certainly, a welcome surprise.  The renovated former general store is a cozy, vibrant and hip place right next to the Bedford Ave. L Train.  The ""modern Agentine"" menu is well executed and provides a good variety at a reasonable price.To start, their baked empanadas, which come in ""hand cut steak"" and spinach, cheese and corn are superb.  I could have eaten half a dozen of them.  The Ceviche Mixto, however, missed the mark - the selection of seafood was not very good and the civiche marinade of choice was far too thick (too much avocado was the culprit).  That, however, was the only miss of the night.The ""14 oz Rib Eye"" seemed more like a gargantuan 24 oz and was probably one of the best rib eye's I've had in the past few years.  Cooked perfectly with an excellent char on the outside, but nearly so tender that you didn't need a knife.   It is served on a round, wooden cutting block with truffle potatoes and two kinds of salsas, which are not really necessary as the meat stands very well on its own.   Lamb chops (available in servings of 2 and 4) were tender as could be and served atop a tangy avocado, onion and tomato salad - Pretty wonderful.  The lightly friend ""avacado fries"" with a chili ketchup were a great accompaniment.Despite what you might be reading, they do now have a full liquor license, although they will still allow you to BYO for a $10 corkage fee.  We opted for a pitcher of white sangria, followed by a glass of red.  Both were suitable for the meal, but quite dry - which was fine for me, but I suspect would be a bit less satisfying for those who are looking for that traditional sangria sweetness.The food is a solid 3-4 stars, but the service, while not poor, was mediocre.  We did wait a bit too long between our appetizers and main and a re-shuffling of tables next to us caused a series of kitchen delivery mishaps, where food kept being delivered to the ""old"" table and then sent back to the kitchen, even though I pointed to the server where the people had moved to.   The table on the other side of us never got their appetizer and they fumbled in trying to fix it.  Nothing major, nothing that would cause me to not come back again - just not 4 star service.All in all a tremendous find right off of Bedford Avenue.  Twelve hours later and I am still craving that rib eye...",3.0

I got the homemade paparedelle with Ox tail rue (al dente and spicy ox tail chunks... oh my!) She got the braised short rib (tender off the bone goodness. A bit sweet, could have used more raw veggies or something a little bitter to counter the sweetness). Pair with 2 glasses of  an aromatic Syrah. Finished off with coffee and churos!

This place is incredible. I'm still drooling thinking about my birthday dinner I just had here. They had no problem giving us reservations for 6 the same day, but it was full when we arrived so it's good we called ahead. Guac is good too. They brought me a dulce de leche crepe thing with banana for dessert which was pure heaven and I was on a caramel high (the kind I care to engage often.) I wanna try the ceviche but I can't stop ordering the avocado fries because perfection, and that's all. Pro-tip: If you don't want sweet sangria, which is delicious regardless, get the wine blend with your dinner...it's on the menu and it's called a malbec/cabernet blend.

"Such a beautiful place! And still comfortable, to boot. I went with a large group, so I can attest to the excellence of the skirt steak, pork chop, seafood ceviche (they have a couple other kinds of ceviche that seem more tartare-ish), and paella (which I got personally because traveling with a butcher-cum-meat-curer can get digestively exhausting. And Almacen isn't exactly known for vegetarian options, so seafood seemed like a good idea). You can bring your own wine and they'll decant it into these silly penguin pitchers, with which they keep topping off your glass. Service was great; the only downsides to this place are the aforementioned vegetarian-unfriendliness and the fact that I'm not rich enough to eat here everyday.",4.0
"Note to Yelp: Don't sit at the back table. We should have known when the waiter asked if we would rather sit at a different table, but hey - live and learn.Definitely a new favorite. So cute inside, decent prices and a unique menu. The fish tacos I had were basically perfect (maybe a little heavy on the chipotle mayo, but delicious) and my bf's chicken tacos were really tasty too. Good portion size - not too big, nicely presented. I would definitely order both again. The other food we saw on plates looked amazing too.We also got the mini churros served with a chocolate & caramel sauce for dessert - wow!! Sooooo good!!! Again, perfect portion size, and super super tasty. This would be a 5-star, but since we sat at the back, behind the bar area where the servers hang out, we got forgotten about. In such a small space, this was almost impressive. My bf who was facing the rest of the restaurant said that all the other tables were getting great service, but we had to flag down someone every time ... even to order in the first place. That's kind of ridiculous, and if the food hadn't been so awesome I might not want to go back soon because of that.Cash only, no alcohol, sit near the bar. Try the churros, you can thank me later.",4.0
"Lots of choices for the Argentinian meat fans but also beautiful, tasty vegetarian and fish options, all with fresh ingredients. The food is original, and inspired, but not as daunting as recent trends (foam--stop with the foam). One recent ceviche dish had Hamachi collar, which was in a light citrus sauce, sliced thinly, with scallion shavings. So simple, and a nice small portion, yet so delicious. The poblano dish on the menu is incredibly good. The tables can seem crowded but just tune others out. A small business needs to get as much turnover as possible.No longer are they BYOB but they are still cash only. Their wines were a bit on the pricey side.",5.0

"I've had my eyes on El Almacen for quite some time. A couple of months ago I came across a recipe for avocado fries. Rather than trying to cook them on my own I decided to search yelp for restaurants in the city that serve them. El Almacen seemed to be the only one. After much anticipation a friend and i decided to check it out. We were seated immediately and approached by our server shortly after. I ordered the baja fish tacos, my friend ordered the enchiladas and we decided to split the avocado fries. Everything was going well up until this point.I noticed the server explain to not one but three nearby tables specials that we were never informed of. The avocado fries came out first when i asked for all the dishes to come out together. They were alright. Not what i had expected and nothing to rave about. The fish tacos were alright. The cole slaw was very mayo heavy causing the deep fried fish to get soggy pretty easily. The $9 order only comes with two mini tacos so i was still pretty hungry afterwards. While my friend was still eating his enchiladas (which i got to try and was probably my favorite part of the night, very meaty with a delicious salsa verde) i decided to order the ceviche mixto. The ceviche was not bad at all but once again the gave baby portions. As i was eating my ceviche, my friend, who had finished his enchiladas a while earlier, decided to order desert. When asking the hostess, who walked by at that moment, for a menu she gave him a nasty look that seemed as if she was annoyed he would even ask. The manager, who was nearby, quickly came over with one. My friend decided to order the chocolate cake while i was still eating because he knew i was not going to get desert. The waitress had a similar annoyed attitude when we explained to her just to bring the desert out when it was ready. The desert came and my friend left a little so i could try when i was done with my ceviche. My plate was empty so we swapped as to make it easier for me to try his desert. The manager, assuming i did not understand spanish (I speak fluently), approached the waitress and asked her to explain what was going on with our table. As they were standing right next to us they began cracking jokes, in spanish, about the order of which our food came out. I could care less about what they were saying. However, i was so offended that they would find it appropriate to talk about patrons loud enough from them to hear simply because they're not talking in english. All in all, the food was ok, portions were too small, and the staff we encountered was extremely rude. I would've given the food a second chance if the people there weren't such snobs.",2.0

We got the grilled sweetbreads special (yum! not overcooked and the chopped peppers/tomatoe and lemon really took the dish to another level), the avocado fries (droool - crispy panko-like breading on the outside, smooth buttery avocado goodness on the inside with just the right hint of bitterness dipped in a sweet and tangy bbq-like sauce). I got the homemade paparedelle with Ox tail rue (al dente and spicy ox tail chunks... oh my!) She got the braised short rib (tender off the bone goodness. A bit sweet, could have used more raw veggies or something a little bitter to counter the sweetness). Pair with 2 glasses of  an aromatic Syrah. Finished off with coffee and churos! Cripy fried on the outside, doughy on the inside, dipped in dark chocolate or semi-sweet caramel.... what a night!yes!... I'm a fan =)PS: Cash only, but there's a convenient ATM machine in the back patio.",4.0
"A teeny tiny bit under 5 stars.I dream of the skirt steak and avocado fries.  I try to limit myself to coming here once a month, but crave it every..single...day.  God help me.The only bad thing about this place is the consistency.  I've ordered the exact same thing (don't judge) for the past half-dozen trips, and it tends to be cooked differently each time.",4.0
"Update: There's literally no reason to do this update at all. But I am obsessed with this food and I logged in today so why the hell not? Every damn time I've come here the ribs were SO DELICIOUS.... My friend's boyfriend thought he knew the best ribs elsewhere in the city, so I convinced him to try these, and his jaw literally dropped when he ate them. They fall off the bone. This place is incredible. I'm still drooling thinking about my birthday dinner I just had here. They had no problem giving us reservations for 6 the same day, but it was full when we arrived so it's good we called ahead. Guac is good too. They brought me a dulce de leche crepe thing with banana for dessert which was pure heaven and I was on a caramel high (the kind I care to engage often.) I wanna try the ceviche but I can't stop ordering the avocado fries because perfection, and that's all. Pro-tip: If you don't want sweet sangria, which is delicious regardless, get the wine blend with your dinner...it's on the menu and it's called a malbec/cabernet blend. It's the perfect medium wine with the steak or ribs.",5.0
"My favorite stake joint. I have tried all the meat cuts and they are all delicious, even comparing to steak places in Buenos Aires!!! Make sure you ask for Alfahor for dessert (the one in chocolate)",5.0
Steak Steak Steak Steak. Came here the other night and sat at the bar and my experience was just wonderful. I haven't had a meal this good in a long long time the food came out swiftly and the service was exceptional(beautiful). I strongly recommend the steak tacos which are mouthwatering. The  rib eye and the grilled corn on the cob. So fulfilling it makes me wonder why I haven't been here before. Just amazing.,5.0
"Such a beautiful place! And still comfortable, to boot. I went with a large group, so I can attest to the excellence of the skirt steak, pork chop, seafood ceviche (they have a couple other kinds of ceviche that seem more tartare-ish), and paella (which I got personally because traveling with a butcher-cum-meat-curer can get digestively exhausting. And Almacen isn't exactly known for vegetarian options, so seafood seemed like a good idea). You can bring your own wine and they'll decant it into these silly penguin pitchers, with which they keep topping off your glass. Service was great; the only downsides to this place are the aforementioned vegetarian-unfriendliness and the fact that I'm not rich enough to eat here everyday.",4.0
"Note to Yelp: Don't sit at the back table. We should have known when the waiter asked if we would rather sit at a different table, but hey - live and learn.Definitely a new favorite. So cute inside, decent prices and a unique menu. The fish tacos I had were basically perfect (maybe a little heavy on the chipotle mayo, but delicious) and my bf's chicken tacos were really tasty too. Good portion size - not too big, nicely presented. I would definitely order both again. The other food we saw on plates looked amazing too.We also got the mini churros served with a chocolate & caramel sauce for dessert - wow!! Sooooo good!!! Again, perfect portion size, and super super tasty. This would be a 5-star, but since we sat at the back, behind the bar area where the servers hang out, we got forgotten about. In such a small space, this was almost impressive. My bf who was facing the rest of the restaurant said that all the other tables were getting great service, but we had to flag down someone every time ... even to order in the first place. That's kind of ridiculous, and if the food hadn't been so awesome I might not want to go back soon because of that.Cash only, no alcohol, sit near the bar. Try the churros, you can thank me later.",4.0
"Lots of choices for the Argentinian meat fans but also beautiful, tasty vegetarian and fish options, all with fresh ingredients. The food is original, and inspired, but not as daunting as recent trends (foam--stop with the foam). One recent ceviche dish had Hamachi collar, which was in a light citrus sauce, sliced thinly, with scallion shavings. So simple, and a nice small portion, yet so delicious. The poblano dish on the menu is incredibly good. The tables can seem crowded but just tune others out. A small business needs to get as much turnover as possible.No longer are they BYOB but they are still cash only. Their wines were a bit on the pricey side.",5.0

"I've had my eyes on El Almacen for quite some time. A couple of months ago I came across a recipe for avocado fries. Rather than trying to cook them on my own I decided to search yelp for restaurants in the city that serve them. El Almacen seemed to be the only one. After much anticipation a friend and i decided to check it out. We were seated immediately and approached by our server shortly after. I ordered the baja fish tacos, my friend ordered the enchiladas and we decided to split the avocado fries. Everything was going well up until this point.I noticed the server explain to not one but three nearby tables specials that we were never informed of. The avocado fries came out first when i asked for all the dishes to come out together. They were alright. Not what i had expected and nothing to rave about. The fish tacos were alright. The cole slaw was very mayo heavy causing the deep fried fish to get soggy pretty easily. The $9 order only comes with two mini tacos so i was still pretty hungry afterwards. While my friend was still eating his enchiladas (which i got to try and was probably my favorite part of the night, very meaty with a delicious salsa verde) i decided to order the ceviche mixto. The ceviche was not bad at all but once again the gave baby portions. As i was eating my ceviche, my friend, who had finished his enchiladas a while earlier, decided to order desert. When asking the hostess, who walked by at that moment, for a menu she gave him a nasty look that seemed as if she was annoyed he would even ask. The manager, who was nearby, quickly came over with one. My friend decided to order the chocolate cake while i was still eating because he knew i was not going to get desert. The waitress had a similar annoyed attitude when we explained to her just to bring the desert out when it was ready. The desert came and my friend left a little so i could try when i was done with my ceviche. My plate was empty so we swapped as to make it easier for me to try his desert. The manager, assuming i did not understand spanish (I speak fluently), approached the waitress and asked her to explain what was going on with our table. As they were standing right next to us they began cracking jokes, in spanish, about the order of which our food came out. I could care less about what they were saying. However, i was so offended that they would find it appropriate to talk about patrons loud enough from them to hear simply because they're not talking in english. All in all, the food was ok, portions were too small, and the staff we encountered was extremely rude. I would've given the food a second chance if the people there weren't such snobs.",2.0
"It was my first time there couple of weeks ago and I just LOVED El almacen.  There was a bit of a line but we just went to the wine store down the road to pick out a bottle of wine since the waitress kindly told us they have BYOB for open bottle fee for $5.  When we finally sit down, we were sitting at a cozy table next to an old wall lamp and that was secluded despite it's sucha busy restaurant.  The menu was totally worth the wait.  EVERYTHING on it looked good!  I got the chilli relleno and my bf got the Tilipia and they were both excellent.

"This place was highly recommended by a neighbor. I found it disapointing. The decor and interior was cute, I enjoyed it very much, the music was great- but my good times stopped there. The table was off by like an inch on one leg, which caused a very severe ""rocking"" back and forth... the woman who seated us said she'd be ""right back to fix it"" then never did, even though the place had 6 other patrons in it, and 4 staff. Our lovely waitress was near useless. She saw the table moving violently at one point, and just walked on by. My bf put his foot on on leg, to steady it- for the entire meal. Thank God for big feet, eh? So yeah. I didn't know what to get, so I asked our waitress. She said ""everything is good."" Yeah, I said- but what about these two? I pointed between the chirizo/eggs and the heuvos rancheros. She just snidely said ""the huevos is more Mexican, the chirizo more Argentinian"" Yeah. Ok, like I didn't know that. I just wanted to know which one the chef cooked better. My bf picked the rancheros, me the chirizo, and a coffee. The coffee wasn't bad at all. The chirizo dish was pathedic. The rancheros, near perfect, my bf reported. Of course, I thought. The sausage was paste-dry, served with completely DRY bread with hard crust, and some overcooked scrambled eggs. Yes, I ordered them scrambled, but geez, not scrambled plus 5 minutes. Then the potatoes. So, let's recap. dry, dry, dry, dry and er... dry. The flavors were decent, and of good quality, but it was apparent the chef didn't cook well, or didn't care that particular moment. My bf happily ate the entire rancheros plate, and offered me one delicious bite. Turns out the Chef is Mexican. What a surprise! (no, really, he is, and whoo boy can he cook awesome Mexican food, but I would avoid the chirizo ""Argentinian"" style stuff at all costs) The waitress really did me in though. She simply ignored us most of the meal, and when we directly asked for the check after 30 minutes of sitting there waiting for eye contact (with maybe 14 patrons at this point) she still ignored us another 10 minutes. We asked again, and the bill came. I was still hungry. I couldn't stomach the whole plate, and it wasn't much to begin with. I really wanted what my bf had- but wasn't about to spend another $10 here for such crappy service and overpriced food. Plus, we'd been there a loooong time just waiting for the bill.

"I have been to this place twice - once for brunch, once for dinner - and have a serious crush.  Starting with brunch. I had the huevos rancheros, which is something I'm forced to do every time the menu has them.  The portion is on the small side, but oh so good. Beans, eggs, mildly spicy tomatillo sauce - what more could a girl ask for? Good coffee? OK. They had that, too. My friend had the omelet which she said was basic, but tasty, and it all looked very hearty.After that I just HAD to try dinner, especially because I read they have their liquor license now (who wants dinner w/o booze?). I started with the sangria, the Mr. had Quilmes, and beer from Argentina. Next time we go, I'm forcing him to get the sangria in pitcher form with me because I will not stand for having an empty glass of that.There were so many choices, but I settled on the fish tacos wand one choclo. The fish tacos were melt-in-your-mouth awesome and I had to fight to keep the Mr. off of the choclo until I was finished. Once he finished the corn on the cob, he continued to sweep up remnants from the chipotle mayo and cojito that were still on the plate.  He was rather thrilled with his choice of the stuffed pepper. Huge pepper, tasty filling, beans, rice...you name it.  The avocado fries are everything you have heard them to be. The service here was very friendly, and it was nice to see that even though they don't take credit cards, they do have an ATM on the premises for those who forget cash.

"Friday night and we were seated right away on their quaint little patio (sweet!).  10 minutes later we were approached by a hostess, ""who sat you here!?"" (suggesting we sat our selves).  "" well this table is reserved for some VIPs!"" (suggesting we were chopped liver!?) Situation handled very poorly and unprofessionally.  Not wanting to ruin the night and make a scene, accepted a table in their very loud and cramped dinning room (not sweet).  The food really wasn't bad.  It is one of those places that you would want to return to to try other things, and I totally would if not for the extremely low level of service.  Other reviews have it pegged when they say you will never see your waitress more than 2x's.  Which is fine with me since their attitude made me feel as if I should stand up and serve them drinks!  Who you will see allot of is the overly eager bus boys.  We ordered the corn and every time I took a bite and placed it back on the plate I would hear ""finished sir?"".  I wouldn't mind it so much if it didn't happen 10x's in 15 minutes, no exaggeration.  However, this is still better than the waitresses who will decide for you when your done!  I suppose the bread was just there for me to admire for a second and not to eat!?  I am someone who thought that by deep-frying, anything can be made better.  Avocados, are not one of those things.  The mild flavor of an avocado really has no chance against the thick salty crust.  Imagine the disappointment of biting into an onion ring with no onion inside.  The empanadas were stellar.  Maybe not authentic but very tasty.  Nice texture to the skin without being thick.  The famous $5 corn is ok if you really like spicy mayo. Of all the Coffee braised ox-tail I tried this one had the best flavor.  Nutty and chocolatey goodness over egg noodles, but where's the beef?? The blood sausage was also up there,  great herbal undertones in a loosely packed link.  Imagine pate in a tube, buttery and delicious spread on bread (wait, where did my bread go!?!). Short rib + msg + grill = good?  Short ribs were cooked very precisely to order.  Medium actually came out medium!!  Could it be they actually have a chef that grills by feel and not by timer?? The food would have deserved another star or two but dinning is about the overall experience and the service just leaves a bad taste in your mouth that overshadows the slightly above average food here.",2.0

"This was a great find for a pre-concert meal. Because it's an Argentine place, they specialize in the grilled meats, especially the cuts of beef. But I just wasn't in a beefy mood. So we had the Ceviche Hamachi, Avocado Fries, the Tilapia Tacos, and the Hearts of Palm salad, all of which were winners. The ceviche was really light and flavorful, and the hamachi was really fresh-tasting (aka not fishy). The avocado fries were crispy on the outside and buttery on the inside and weren't greasy at all, and they came with a great spicy ketchup that I basically wanted to lick off the bowl afterwards.The portions aren't super-huge, but we ordered plenty enough to satisfy for a final bill of around $50 for two. Definitely cap of your meal with an order of the fresh churros and dip them in the dulce de leche while enjoying a coffee. They have a nice (but small) outdoor seating area, too, although the tables are a little cramped.

And of course for dessert, the churros. The cocktails were great, the wine list was appropriate and pleasing and the service was stellar.",5.0
"This is a super cute little place. I love the tiny outdoor garden seating section and all the tables with little cups of flowers and candles. They're a little pricey but if you order the right things you can fill up for not entirely too expensive. The choclo corn is delicious: grilled corn cob with spicy mayo slathered all over and rolled in cotija cheese-$5 for 1 or $8 for two. The flan is also pretty tasty for $6 and comes with some diced strawberries. The guacamole and avocado fries are nice too, and I believe they're $6 each as well. Just remember they are CASH ONLY! They do have an ATM inside, but who wants to pay $2 and their bank fee to pull out cash?",4.0
"Went to the restaurant last night 6/19 with Jeff, around 9.30PMThe place was packed but we only waited 15min.The atmosphere was great, decor is really nice, the waiter was very cool and relaxed, even though the place was really busy. Only thing is that it was very noisy, but i guess it's expected, being a small place, and the tables are quite close to each other. They told us it's BYOB ($5 corking fee) until Monday when they'll get their liquor license.The food was delicious: empenadas, chorizo, corn, and the entranas. All were worth it. Also, very easy to get to from the L train.Overall, great place, great food, not expensive (entranas were $18). I will go back and recommend to friends.",4.0
"I went here for dinner last week and would absolutely go back. They have a charming (but small) garden in the back with Christmas lights - a great spot to eat if it's nice outside. We ordered chips and guacamole for an appetizer and it was good but not fantastic. We both really liked our main courses: Chicken Enchiladas and Tacos De Pescado (talapia). And the sangria was delicious (and strong). Only downside is that it's cash only, but they do have an ATM in the back if you don't have any cash handy.",4.0
"Friday night and we were seated right away on their quaint little patio (sweet!).  10 minutes later we were approached by a hostess, ""who sat you here!?"" (suggesting we sat our selves).  "" well this table is reserved for some VIPs!"" (suggesting we were chopped liver!?) Situation handled very poorly and unprofessionally.  Not wanting to ruin the night and make a scene, accepted a table in their very loud and cramped dinning room (not sweet).  The food really wasn't bad.  It is one of those places that you would want to return to to try other things, and I totally would if not for the extremely low level of service.  Other reviews have it pegged when they say you will never see your waitress more than 2x's.  Which is fine with me since their attitude made me feel as if I should stand up and serve them drinks!  Who you will see allot of is the overly eager bus boys.  We ordered the corn and every time I took a bite and placed it back on the plate I would hear ""finished sir?"".  I wouldn't mind it so much if it didn't happen 10x's in 15 minutes, no exaggeration.  However, this is still better than the waitresses who will decide for you when your done!  I suppose the bread was just there for me to admire for a second and not to eat!?  I am someone who thought that by deep-frying, anything can be made better.  Avocados, are not one of those things.  The mild flavor of an avocado really has no chance against the thick salty crust.  Imagine the disappointment of biting into an onion ring with no onion inside.  The empanadas were stellar.  Maybe not authentic but very tasty.  Nice texture to the skin without being thick.  The famous $5 corn is ok if you really like spicy mayo. Of all the Coffee braised ox-tail I tried this one had the best flavor.  Nutty and chocolatey goodness over egg noodles, but where's the beef?? The blood sausage was also up there,  great herbal undertones in a loosely packed link.  Imagine pate in a tube, buttery and delicious spread on bread (wait, where did my bread go!?!). Short rib + msg + grill = good?  Short ribs were cooked very precisely to order.  Medium actually came out medium!!  Could it be they actually have a chef that grills by feel and not by timer?? The food would have deserved another star or two but dinning is about the overall experience and the service just leaves a bad taste in your mouth that overshadows the slightly above average food here.",2.0
"Oh yes. This place is great: cozy and delicious. I went with a good friend, and we split the following: avocado fries (meh), buttered and cheesed corn on the cob (pretty good), 2 beef tacos (yum), and entraña (skirt steak). GET THE ENTRAÑA. I am still thinking about it. Our Malbec was delicious, too. But seriously, that steak. Final damage: $42 each with tip. Our server was charming and competent, too. No complaints, other than that I wish I'd had room to try that blood sausage.",4.0

"IM ARGENTINEAN and I HATE THIS PLACE...  why? i'll tell ya...    I just moved to brooklyn and Iwas looking for an Argentinean spot to simply goand have lunch at least three times a week...  So i Tried some in manhattan but it's to far... Went to EL ALMACEN and sat down.. pretty nice place I haveto say..  but everything else from then on was just a wreck..I ordered a Palmito Salad and a ""Asado de Tira"" which is a short rib steak..  20 minutes later the salad came... and there was two other tables only... well the salad had NO palmitos!?!?i was like WTH!??!  they did bring more palmitos on request after she told me that the kitchen didn't want to give me more.. lol.. 20 mins after that by watch, my steak came and it was RAW...  i ordered Medium-Well  but this was RAW RAW...  so It grossed meout...  I immediately ordered the check...  Payed $38 plus $8 tip.. and left, crossed the street and got some PIZZA...    geez... I hope that thatwas just a bad day for them..  but for sure i'm not coming back...",1.0
"i knew it. it knew it was too good to be true! i went here on a monday night, with my boyfriend this time, so he could try their steak deliciousness. instead of ordering the entrana however, we ordered the parrillada for two (which i've tried before). but instead of the steak melting in your mouth, it was dry and tasteless. i was thoroughly disappointed and more disappointed that my bf couldn't experience the steak deliciousness as i did.",3.0
"This was a great find for a pre-concert meal. Because it's an Argentine place, they specialize in the grilled meats, especially the cuts of beef. But I just wasn't in a beefy mood. So we had the Ceviche Hamachi, Avocado Fries, the Tilapia Tacos, and the Hearts of Palm salad, all of which were winners. The ceviche was really light and flavorful, and the hamachi was really fresh-tasting (aka not fishy). The avocado fries were crispy on the outside and buttery on the inside and weren't greasy at all, and they came with a great spicy ketchup that I basically wanted to lick off the bowl afterwards.The portions aren't super-huge, but we ordered plenty enough to satisfy for a final bill of around $50 for two. Definitely cap of your meal with an order of the fresh churros and dip them in the dulce de leche while enjoying a coffee. They have a nice (but small) outdoor seating area, too, although the tables are a little cramped. A great little place to keep in mind for all those dinners before a show at the Music Hall of Williamsburg or at the Williamsburg Waterfront.",4.0

TRUST ME, they said. it's a special and you need to get it.

"So, my uncle brought me here after my MCAT as a treat (Lord knows I needed it) and oh my god, from the endless Sangria pitchers to the warm churros at the end the meal was a real treat. The decor was really nice and since it was summer, we sat in the garden area out back. I realized that with the candle light and everything it could actually be a really great date spot!Anyway, our server was really nice and we started with the red wine sangria.

Now, onto my favorite part...FOOD: -Guacomole - it was good. Very fresh avocados and decent flavor.-Tacos de Pescado - so good! I love love love fish tacos and I have to say, this was my FAVORITE dish at El Almacen. The flavoring was really good and the fish was very well-cooked.-Ceviche de Bife - very different from what I've normally had in a ceviche (which tends to be some kind of fish) it was nice and cooling and generally not bad. -Tira de asado - I liked my steak and thankfully it was actually cooked MEDIUM RARE (and not medium which is how I normally find my steak despite specifying how I want it cooked). The flavor was nice and the chimichurri was nice accompaniment with the steak. -Churros - so so so so good. You know the churros you have at Universal Studios or Six Flags? After you try these you will never order churros at a theme park again. The dulce de leche sauce and churro melt in your mouth leaving you craving for more! And the warm chocolate sauce isn't bad either (but I like caramel better).

"My friend who lives around the corner brought me here with the enticement of avocado fries, but upon stepping in and checking out the decor (and the cool backyard patio area), the fries weren't even necessary.  I was expecting some hole in the wall, reggatone blasting -actual- Argentinean place, but I was glad to find an safely Americanized establishment.Of course, started with the avocado fries which were really awesome.  Not too much breading but just enough to give a light crunch consistency.  There was also a spicy ketchup served with it, that I thought was somewhat of a conflict (ketchup + avocado?), but the spice kind of made it work.  My friend told me that they brought him some type of cool spicy mayo the last time he was there, but when we requested it, all we got was plain mayo. Which was fine, because the fries alone were just awesome.We went for brunch, and had a memorable night before, which led us to less-than-memorable head/stomach aches for the proceeding morning (when we ate the brunch that I'm currently typing about). So I was thinking about getting the skirt steak and eggs (I read a ton about the delicious meatiness of the skirt on Yelp, and figured it'd be an obvious choice - FACT: the skirt steak for brunch, is the same the use for dinner, or so I was told by our waitress), but she suggested I up to the Ribeye and eggs, which was not only one of their daily specials but came with truffle fries.  I mean, truffle fries?  That's like asking someone if they want a million dollars or a Sacagawea coin... I did have a little guilt on my shoulders, and stomach, knowing that I had already had a type of fry no less than 15 minutes prior, but I was hungover. End of story.  Well, not really, but end of THAT story...Anyway, my friend got the huevos rancheros, and I'm not usually a fan of that dish, but I tasted it and it was pretty salacious - a whole lotta cheese.  My steak was really good, but, and maybe this is because I'm just not used to ribeye, had kind of a lot of fat at one end. So maybe it's not the same quality as their dinner, or maybe I just don't know my ribeye.  It came with eggs that I got scrambled, and of course the truffle fries that weren't actually fries. They were more like a cross between breakfast potatoes and those thick fries (not steak fries, but the ones with the skins still on them, akin to the 'fries' they serve at KFC, if you've traveled down that dark road like I have in the past).  But whatever the hell they were, they were just full of truffle salt, some of which got on to my eggs, which was just amazing.  It was way too much food to finish, but the bill wasn't so bad (I think it was $13/15 for my steak and eggs [and truffle fries!], and my friend's dish was somewhere between $9-12).",4.0

"This is my go to spot in the neighborhood hands down. Their meat selection and the quality of the cuts are top notch and the vibe inside is casual and authentic. Overall, El Almacen is a well thought out addition to the northside of Williamsburg.",4.0
"I really can't figure out why this place only has 3 1/2 stars. In fact it's only gotten better since my original review, since they now have a liquor license and a charming little garden to boot. What's not to like? The food is incredible - It's all about the short ribs in any form. The short rib tacos and appetizers are incredible. I crave them everyday. It saddens me to see that such (at least for me) amazing service and hospitality isn't being rewarded, but everyone has different experiences and opinions so... But they've all been overly kind, and the owner, Diego, always stops by my table to chat. It doesn't seem the negative reviews are hurting them then cause they're always packed. Whatever, I'm pledging my loyalty to El Almacen!",5.0
"YES, very yummy, very cozy. And YES, it's true, the owners of this place are basically the best looking family in the world. I know that should have no bearing on the worth of a restaurant, but, I'm obviously not the only person who has noticed. Try the Milanesa De Pollo. Salty in the best way, so crisp, with amazing mashed potatoes.",4.0
"My friend who lives around the corner brought me here with the enticement of avocado fries, but upon stepping in and checking out the decor (and the cool backyard patio area), the fries weren't even necessary.  I was expecting some hole in the wall, reggatone blasting -actual- Argentinean place, but I was glad to find an safely Americanized establishment.Of course, started with the avocado fries which were really awesome.  Not too much breading but just enough to give a light crunch consistency.  There was also a spicy ketchup served with it, that I thought was somewhat of a conflict (ketchup + avocado?), but the spice kind of made it work.  My friend told me that they brought him some type of cool spicy mayo the last time he was there, but when we requested it, all we got was plain mayo. Which was fine, because the fries alone were just awesome.We went for brunch, and had a memorable night before, which led us to less-than-memorable head/stomach aches for the proceeding morning (when we ate the brunch that I'm currently typing about). So I was thinking about getting the skirt steak and eggs (I read a ton about the delicious meatiness of the skirt on Yelp, and figured it'd be an obvious choice - FACT: the skirt steak for brunch, is the same the use for dinner, or so I was told by our waitress), but she suggested I up to the Ribeye and eggs, which was not only one of their daily specials but came with truffle fries.  I mean, truffle fries?  That's like asking someone if they want a million dollars or a Sacagawea coin... I did have a little guilt on my shoulders, and stomach, knowing that I had already had a type of fry no less than 15 minutes prior, but I was hungover. End of story.  Well, not really, but end of THAT story...Anyway, my friend got the huevos rancheros, and I'm not usually a fan of that dish, but I tasted it and it was pretty salacious - a whole lotta cheese.  My steak was really good, but, and maybe this is because I'm just not used to ribeye, had kind of a lot of fat at one end.

"There are 2 sides to every story and I want Yelpers to have enough information to decide to whether or not to try El Almacen. I am the one that caused at least 2 recent bad reviews of El Almacen - I'm ""the chick"" who threw up. On 2/18, my boyfriend and I were on our way to a show after dinner and I stopped on the steps outside of El Almacen because I was experiencing some serious stomach pains. After resting for about 15 mins, I went in to see if I could use their bathroom. I WAS NOT drunk and in the end turned out that I had a mild case of food poisoning. The manager and the staff were completely understanding, kind and above all HUMAN. The manager saw that I wasn't doing well and let me sit down in the back room so that i wouldn't block the traffic until I gained my strength. She stood by me the entire time asking if I was ok and also gave me some sprite to settle my stomach. Unfortunately, the food made it's way back up. Before I knew it, someone was mopping and the manager was on the phone trying to reach my boyfriend for me. When he arrived, she asked her friend to stand outside to see if I was ok and also called 911 for me. The manager was genuinely concerned that I had kidney stones or something serious that needed medical attention. I couldn't have asked for a kinder soul to help me that night. I put her in a very bad position but she handled it with grace and I hope people reading this would understand that if they were put in that situation. I went back a few weeks ago to express how grateful I was for all that she did and to apologize for making a scene. She was so extremely nice when I saw her - she gave me a hug and sat down to talk to us. I wanted to buy her a drink but she was extremely gracious and it wasn't even recorded on the bill. We had a few snacks there and they were all DELICIOUS - avocado fries were to die for, short rib tacos hit the spot, and dulce de leche crepe with bananas to top it off nicely. I highly recommend this place with all my heart. The food is delicious, ambiance is intimate and above all, the people and the place has character.

"The first time I came here was more than a year ago and I was quite impressed, mainly due to the fact it was one of the first restaurants I visited in the area and I found myself breathing freely, meaning it felt finally so human (cozy and nice) as opposed to the majority of places across the East River. That time I hadn't eaten much and so I can't really recall the food impressions. I visited the place again recently and somewhat unfortunately I found it simply not so great: food was very mediocre, but priced not less than some much better places in the area. Corn was good, but what can go wrong with a corn anyway? Enchilada would probably be better in any Mexican fast food spot, fried avocado was pretty bad (the taste of oil too strong, the oil was bad?), chorizo was quite fine.  The decoration this time I found a bit too extreme and maybe not of the finest style possible (a chair hanging from the ceiling ? how do they dust that? ).

"Used to be a favorite, now I'm horrified. Since this place opened, my partner and I have gone regularly and have enjoyed the food.

After another party came and went also using the other end of the bench, two of us suddenly found ourselves on the GROUND and my leg was trapped between two pieces of broken wood from the bench. In the midst of broken glass, we were shocked at first and this quickly turned to anger. The waitress brought me a bag of ice because immediately there was a large bruise on either side of my ankle/calf where it was trapped in the broken bench. I wasn't sure if it was broken, or how badly hurt it was, but they brought me a small glass of wine on the house and then NEVER returned. After 30 minutes of getting over the craziness of the situation, I hobbled up the stairs to leave. My friends vehemently complained about the treatment and the waitress responding by walking away!!!! The owners were there drinking and absolutely no one said anything as if such a thing is a regular occurance. They offered to take off the cost of a bottle of wine from the bill but left us in such a weird position.

"This place is SO GOOD. Everyone talks about the avocado fries, but I'm all about the meat and the wine. And the staff are all uncommonly goodlooking. I didn't realize they had a brunch until my friend and I passed by one weekend and it was open. So glad we did that! Thirty seconds after we sat down, there were mimosas in front of us and fresh flowers on the table. I don't remember what I had, I just remember it tasting amazing. Dinners are great, but expect a wait. Totally didn't mean to rhyme just then, but El Almacen is worth waiting for.",4.0
"the place is ok...porterhouse was good and chorizo and morcilla as well... appetizers are kinda of TOO small...the ceviche was just TINY and 14$...and honestly..pretty bad...""spanish"" style octopus (i add the quoations bc i am from spain and had never eaten pulpo like that..) was ok...just an ok place...fine quality meat but that is it...i dont think i will go back...but you never know",3.0
"My boyfriend and I went there for dinner recently and had a great meal.  The place is small and tables were a bit too close together, but since the place was so cute and romantic, I would have to describe it as ""cozy"".  Unfortunately, we did not know it was BYOB so we had nothing to drink, so be sure to bring your own bottle.  We had the special that night, the lobster taco and it was EXCELLENT!  We loved it so much we wanted it again instead of desert.  I had the ox tail and it was very good.  My boyfriend had the roasted pork and that was even better.  If we lived in Williamsburg we would be there all the time.",4.0
"what a gem!  the food here is surprisingly good.  yes, it's a little crowded, but, you know, deal with it.  i went there quite a while ago when they were in limbo between byob and legitimacy (congrats on the license, guys) and i was worried that a no alcohol policy would kill them, but they've pulled through!",5.0
"Authentic Argentine in Williamsburgh.  Close to the L train, fair prices, wish they took credit cards.  We had empanadas which were delicious, although not what I had in Argentina.  No matter, because they mixed typical ingredients well, and the beef had hard boiled egg, which you don't always see.  GREAT asado de tira, my favorite cut of beef (short ribs grilled: fatty, salty, delicious).  the others in my group ordered the churrasco and the entrana, and they were perfectly prepared and delicious too.  Had El POrtillo Malbec, perfect with the food, lighter in body than many malbecs but great nose and vegetal-fruit combination.  Quibbles: truffle oil on the fries?  Really?  Was that necessary?  Service was good enough, prices are fair.  Desserts were too yummy, and even though I had planned to forgo it, who was I kidding?  Get the panqueque with dulce de leche and grilled bananas and DO NOT SHARE IT.  It's too good.  we sat in the garden, which was a bit cramped but the night was beautiful and it was a treat to be able to sit outside instead of begging to sit under the air conditioner.  Also: could they please play Argentine music?  It would have been nice.  My complaints are minor, can't wait to go back.  One review said it was not good for kids, but we had our teenager with us and he loved it too.  (He's a great restaurant goer...)  They only take reservations for groups larger than 5, but we went early (7:30) and had no problem getting a table.  However, when we left, at around 9, the place was completely full.  The chef is Mexican, by the way, so there are some Mexican items on the menu (sangria?  in Argentina?  Hello?  And tacos?  What are they doing there?)  Don't get them; get the BEEF!  Argentina is about the beef, and maybe the non-Argentine items are good, but the beef was great.  The Argentine menu choices were varied, authentic and delicious.  This place is a find and a keeper!",4.0
