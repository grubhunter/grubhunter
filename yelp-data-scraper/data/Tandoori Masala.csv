"Becoming my favorite Indian Grubhub spot - really great, standard Indian dishes for reasonable prices. Delivery time is always more than reasonable. I'm a happy girl! I've never gone in to eat, but the place looks well designed from the outside.",5.0

"Spent an impromptu weekend in Brooklyn this past weekend, and among the shenanigans we found this little place to eat. I am not a New York native, it having been at least three years since my last visit. However, Yelp never fails. If you find yourself in this part of Brooklyn and would like some authentic and delicious Indian cuisine, you should look no further than this. Reasonably priced by what I consider to be NY standards, and what the place lacks in ambiance - literally a gold plated box with a windowed door - it makes up for in the richness and quality of the food. This place is best for dinner, although I suppose some might be able to make a lunch meal out of it.My party was a size of 6, and the place is a little small - but we were able to push two tables together. They have the standard selection of indian cuisine any reputable place would offer, and of the six different dishes we ordered (tandoori chicken, lamb vindaloo, chicken shawarma, etc) all of them were excellent!I dont think there is a bad dish in this joint. The Okra appatizer dish was the highlight of the meal, and do yourself a favour and order a double portion of the garlic naan. (it comes out nice and hot). Things can get spicy in Indian cuisine, and this one is no exception. Not everything on the menu will burn, but those with a cats tongue be advised that Indians mean spicy. Portion sizes are filling, especially if you do what we did and shared amongst the six of us, sampling a little of everything. The Mango Lassi was amongst the best that I have had in a while. There are good vegetarian options, and all the meat dishes were tender and flavorful. I doubt a person could go wrong.The food doesnt take too long to come out, and for those feeling like staying in, there is a delivery option available.",4.0
"This is a great little Indian restaurant.  I ordered here because it was near my niece but it was a great find for the neighborhood.  I had the samosas which was very good.  I had the crab curry.  Great flavors and sauce.  The best part was the coconut naan.  The was ordered it directly from yelp while riding the J train, and it was ready when I got there.",4.0
I ordered a delivery from that place and I was 100% satisfied. It took barely 20 min to receive our meal. It was still hot and so delicious. We had the Samosa as an appetizer. Totally recommend it! We then had the chicken Makhani and Peas and mushrooms curry for entrees. Loved both of them.,5.0
"I've never been to the location but I always order from them on Grubhub. The food is always spot on and they've never been late getting to my house to deliver. I always get the Chicken Makhani, Naan, and Samosas, occasionally i'll get a mango lassi. I love this place!",4.0
My favorite Indian restaurant! I mostly order from them through Grubhub and they are always on time. They even come into the building instead of waiting outside. They have the best saag paneer I've had so far and the staff is always friendly. There's not much variety in my neighborhood as far as food goes so Tandoori Masala is my go to option. No regrets.,5.0
"Seriously the BEST Indian food of my life! The Saag paneer is made with fresh spinach!! Who makes it with fresh spinach?! These guys! The Jasmine rice with Saffron and peas is a perfect accompaniment. Ambiance: I do takeout. Staff: Super friendly! The man took my order remembered my name after the second order! I was very impressed! Call ahead or order on Yelp app, great for takeout. One day I will eat in but in the meantime I will enjoy the best Indian food ever in the comfort of my own home!",5.0
"Love this place. Best restaurant in the neighborhood.  Sai (the manager) is super nice and helpful.  I get take out and delivery mostly. The food is some of the best Indian I have ever had.

"Was there about a week ago but didn't have time to leave a review. Was in the neighborhood and found this place in Yelp reading the review, my friend and I decided this would be a now place to have lunch. This place as fantastic!

Would go back if I'm ever in the neighborhood again!",5.0

"Our family of 3 enjoys Indian, eats it often, 2 of us have taken an authentic Indian cooking class.  Needless to say, we enjoy Indian food (in and out), so any restaurant getting consistent 5 stars we had to try.  Bushwick is hipster hot of course, so we figured even if it's 4 stars we'd be happy.  The interior is minimalist as it should be - after all it is 2015!  The tables, glasses, dishware and utensils all SPARKLE.  We came early, before sundown, so the view out the large window that runs the entire storefront is across to the lovely row houses across Broadway.Service was excellent, served with a smile.  Here's what we tried this go around:Gratis for the table:Papadum served with 3 relishes - tamarind, mint cilantro, and tomato. Our preference would be a little less salt in the papadrum and cut the tomato with some onion.  But as it was, it was still yummy.AppetizersSamosas - They could not have been better.Bhel Puri - Absolutely delicious.  We were fighting over the last rice crisps!We tried 2 different NaansKandhari Naan (Naan stuffed with pistachios, raisins and almond chopped red onion) - This was so yummy, it could easily be used as a dessert item.  It doesn't indicate that there was coconut in it, but we certainly thought there was a hint of coconut flavor in there somewhere.  We should have asked, but we just forgot.Spicey Naan (Chicken, Cilantro and some Chili powder) done to perfection - kick it up a notch by putting some of Saag or Curry on it (see below).Lamb Saag, and Shrimp Saag (not on the menu, just asked for it) - The Saag here has to be the best ever.  Not at all salty with a hint of spiceyness.  Truly perfect.  The Shrimp were fresh, done to a turn.  The Lamb was excellent quality, melt in our mouth, no grizzle.  Both contained a sufficient amount of protein.Crab Curry - This was another yummy dish.  Spicey but not too spicey.Dessert - 3 pieces on the house: Gulab Jamuun - A pleasant and absolutely delicious way to end the meal.*Even the Basmati rice was yummy!We WILL DEFINITELY go back.  Wishing this place SUCCESS, and wish we lived closer so we could take advantage of them on a steady basis.",5.0

"I'm a huge fan of this restaurant!!!  I've been living in Bushwick for 2 years and we don't have a wide array of restaurants to choose from.

However, being that I love Indian food, my curiosity eventually pushed me in.  I started going last month and we've ordered from there at least five times.I lovve the saag paneer, it's spicy, creamy and delicious.  The naan always tastes as if it's come fresh out of the oven. Everything I've had from here has always been well seasoned and bursting with flavor.  The delivery man is fast, which is a plus!  I haven't dined inside yet, normally we either pick up or deliver but I'm sure my husband and I will eventually dine in.I hope this review encourages more people to check it out, you won't be dissapointed.  I took way too long to give it a try but I can assure you that the food is worth it.",4.0

"This is like a good version of the generally awful Indian food that proliferates in Brooklyn. Basically, I might consider ordering again because all the other options are worse, but this doesn't come close to comparing to the actually good Indian food I have eaten in Manhattan, elsewhere in the country, and in India.I ordered the prix-fix. My Ragraa Chaat appetizer had a decent flavor profile. The potato component was prepared wonderfully and was cooked perfectly. The chickpeas, unfortunately, which form the bulk of the dish ranged from significantly under hydrated to barely hydrated enough. I assume they were using dry chickpeas and didn't rehydrate them adequately. The dish was edible but highly unsatisfying.My main dish was the Rogan Josh. The lamb is good quality lamb and was well-cooked. The sauce was solid but uninspiring. Overall, the main curry dish was a solid entree.The naan is excellent, especially for delivery naan, which tends to be rubbery even when done right.The rice, on the other hand, was both undercooked and tasted cheap. A good basmati has an intoxicating aroma and a rich flavor profile. The rice at Tandoori Masala has neither.Overall, this is a solid restaurant for delivery if you are really craving Indian food. However, it compares poorly to the mid-range of quality for Manhattan Indian food and can't hold a candle to the small list of places in the city that serve really great Indian food.",3.0

The delivery often comes within the estimated time but one time it came extremely late but I guess it was because the rain. They should have called though just to say they were running behind schedule. Nonetheless I will definitely order from here again because the food is great!",4.0

"So glad this gem of an Indian restaurant is right around the corner. My vegetarian girlfriend and I checked this out the other night, and it was really nice. Tasty, rich chicken makhani (aka butter chicken), excellent crispy okra (though it could use a few less onions). My girlfriend ordered a cauliflower appetizer as one of her main entrees; she asked about it, and the server said if she didn't like he'd pay for it. She loved it so we paid (and I really don't like cauliflower, but I tried it and even I liked it a lot).I think this is a newer place and I think they may be still hitting their groove, because though the food was excellent, the service leaned heavily to the slower side (the only reason this review gives it four instead of five stars), but mostly it was toward the end when we were ready for the check. The dining room is clean, neat, but spartan, and they seem to do a pretty active take-out business.Slowish or not, we'll definitely go again. Can't wait to try one of the tandoori specialties. Totally worth a trip.",4.0

They didn't smile....they didn't say hello....they were unfriendly.  I've patronized other restaurants for take out, and they usually offer a glass of water at the bare minimum, as you wait for your order. Since no one else was in the restaurant besides myself and the staff, the atmosphere was very uninviting to say the least. I can't say that I'll EVER go back, because ambiance is VERY important in the restaurant business.",4.0
"Really fast, friendly service. Prices aren't cheap but they are very reasonable (especially for an Indian place!). I had the chana masala, and my friend had the rogan josh. Both really, really good. Great portions, delicious naan, limitless rice! Definitely will be coming back here.",5.0
So yummy! We loved our chicken and lamb curries. The naan is amazing and the same goes for the lassi. The service was wonderful and fast.,5.0
"This is like a good version of the generally awful Indian food that proliferates in Brooklyn. Basically, I might consider ordering again because all the other options are worse, but this doesn't come close to comparing to the actually good Indian food I have eaten in Manhattan, elsewhere in the country, and in India.I ordered the prix-fix. My Ragraa Chaat appetizer had a decent flavor profile. The potato component was prepared wonderfully and was cooked perfectly. The chickpeas, unfortunately, which form the bulk of the dish ranged from significantly under hydrated to barely hydrated enough. I assume they were using dry chickpeas and didn't rehydrate them adequately. The dish was edible but highly unsatisfying.My main dish was the Rogan Josh. The lamb is good quality lamb and was well-cooked. The sauce was solid but uninspiring. Overall, the main curry dish was a solid entree.The naan is excellent, especially for delivery naan, which tends to be rubbery even when done right.The rice, on the other hand, was both undercooked and tasted cheap. A good basmati has an intoxicating aroma and a rich flavor profile. The rice at Tandoori Masala has neither.Overall, this is a solid restaurant for delivery if you are really craving Indian food. However, it compares poorly to the mid-range of quality for Manhattan Indian food and can't hold a candle to the small list of places in the city that serve really great Indian food.",3.0
"Food was delicious, best Indian food in Bushwick! And... Still warm at delivery. What more could you ask for?!",5.0
"I've had the best Indian food in NYC from here. I order from Tandoori Masala quite often because it's near my job and so delicious. I love the samosa so much it's just yummy! I've ordered the Channa Masala, Channa Saag, and Matar Mushroom on different occasions. But I keep going back to the Channa Masala. It's just so tasty with the special house spices. The delivery often comes within the estimated time but one time it came extremely late but I guess it was because the rain. They should have called though just to say they were running behind schedule. Nonetheless I will definitely order from here again because the food is great!",4.0
Excellent Indian food. Quick to deliver.,5.0
"Excellent food and fast delivery, no problems at all, would definitely order from here again, the garlic naan was excellent and I had the chicken tikka masala, also very good.",5.0
"So glad this gem of an Indian restaurant is right around the corner. My vegetarian girlfriend and I checked this out the other night, and it was really nice. Tasty, rich chicken makhani (aka butter chicken), excellent crispy okra (though it could use a few less onions). My girlfriend ordered a cauliflower appetizer as one of her main entrees; she asked about it, and the server said if she didn't like he'd pay for it. She loved it so we paid (and I really don't like cauliflower, but I tried it and even I liked it a lot).I think this is a newer place and I think they may be still hitting their groove, because though the food was excellent, the service leaned heavily to the slower side (the only reason this review gives it four instead of five stars), but mostly it was toward the end when we were ready for the check. The dining room is clean, neat, but spartan, and they seem to do a pretty active take-out business.Slowish or not, we'll definitely go again. Can't wait to try one of the tandoori specialties. Totally worth a trip.",4.0
They would get more stars if their delivery guy would actually buzz in the damn building. Would it kill you to get off your little scooter home slice?,4.0

"Sweet and unassuming, Tandoori Masala creates a prefect atmosphere for dinner with friends. The staff was polite, friendly and quick! I have allergies to certain spices and the kitchen was accommodating and provided excellent service. The food is top notch!

"Stopped in for lunch and was not disappointed. I was the only customer and service was a bit slow, but the bhartha (eggplant) and naan were delicious (though the frozen peas didn't improve the dish).

"This is a very new restaurant and I hope the best for them since the food is authentic and the service is friendly.  The bhel puri is better than thelewala in city.  It is sweet, sour, a hint of spices, and deliciously garnished with cilantro.  The samosas are savory and delicious.  The crab curry is authentically south indian, meaty with crab, has mustard seeds, curry leaves, chili powder, just like a south indian crab curry should have.  The papadum in the beginning is slightly salty, but nothing else is too salty which is a big plus.  The meal concludes with a complimentary gulab jamun, which is sweet yet succulent, it literally oozes saffron, rosebud syrup.  Great novel place in bushwick, i recommend it to all.",5.0
"This place is AMAZING! We ordered take out because it was pouring outside. Everything was fresh and so flavorful. We ordered stuffed naan, vegetable platter, bhel puri and fish tikka. The naan!!! Omg! Stuffed with pistachio, raisins and almond. I will be craving this when I go back to Florida. I'm so full, I've yet to crack open the rice pudding we ordered. I'm sure it will be just as good as everything else. This is a must food stop if you're in Brooklyn! Eat. Here. Now!",5.0

"Went here for lunch in the middle of the week, we were the only customers so service was prompt and the server was very warm and friendly.  We ordered samosa to start, it came with two sauces and it was delicious.  Order comes with two so good for splitting.  For our main courses we got paneer tikka masala and saag paneer.  Both meals came with basmati rice and a huge basket of delicious, warm naan.  The tikka masala sauce was SO GOOD.  I order this dish in every Indian restaurant I go to (and I go to a lot of them), and this was among the top three best I've ever had.  It came with a great amount of fresh, light paneer and there was lots of extra sauce which was great for dipping all that soft buttery naan into.  Overall a great meal, quick service, food was clearly fresh and made to order, nice atmosphere, and enough to take leftovers home all for a reasonable price.  Competes with some of my favorite places in Manhattan (I only say this because I know it matters to some people, I'm not that pretentious).  I would definitely come back!",5.0
This is simply excellent Indian food...perhaps some of the best if not the best I've had in Brooklyn (I am Indian for what it's worth).  The preparation has perfect balance of masala/spicing and richness w/out being bogged down in oil.  The prix-fix is a great deal as well.  I hope the neighborhood catches on to this spot b/c it deserves to become a fixture in an area that needs quality Indian food.,5.0
