"This very unassuming hole in the wall restuarant has a secluded feel to it, with bare brick walls and no windows inside, rustic decor and a simple menu. We came here for a romantic night out and were pleased with the atmosphere allowing for private conversation and intimacy. The menu was as I said simple, but the waiter had a laundry list of about 50 specials and dishes of the day, etc. so keeping track of that was rather confusing and we asked him to repeat himself several times over. The waiter was averagely nice, with an air of pompusness to him, as if he had no time for us. We ordered fried mozzarella as an appetizer, the lobster pasta dish and risotto. The appetizer was delicious, basically a glorified mozzarella stick. Lobster was perfectly cooked but extremely messy to eat because it was slathered in pasta sauce. For a meal that will undoubtedly require hands, it should not have been that messy. We went through four table napkins!! The risotto was aboslutely delicious, perfectly seasoned, yummy meat to go with it. All in all, a very nice dinner. But be careful with the specials- our entire bill was a surpise because we didn't order one thing from the menu.",5.0
"NOT impressed with this place. I love Italian food and I'm always looking to find a cute spot to get real authentic italian. This was truly disappointing. The place had a nice look to it, super cozy and small but it has only about 10 tables maximum.SERVICEA little weird. The waiter was semi standoffish and had a problem controlling his facial expressions. We informed him we didn't want wine and he looked like we just said I hate you. Then when we ordered calamari to split as an appetizer he asked thats it?...followed by another facial expression. However, they were so cheap with the amount I can see why he may have been shocked. Additionally, the waiter barely came around when we needed him.FOODNot that good. The steak was VERY dry and when we asked for steak sauce the waiter didn't know what that was/if they had any-they didn't. I asked for the spinach and ricotta ravioli it was not that great. You get about 6 raviolis I left two of them untouched because of how bland it was. The sauce wasn't that good, the pasta oddly was dry. The total was about 60 for a not so great meal- could be worst. There prices aren't too bad, just not worth it.Bottom line: I would NOT recommend nor would I go back.",3.0
"Came here with a couple of buddies of mine for dinner. They wanted Italian and we ended up finding this spot.Had one of the specials that they mentioned, it was a salmon dish. I wished they had a special menu so you could just easily look it over instead of trying to memorize every dish she memorized. Good piece of salmon topped with sauce and a few pieces of potatoes and broccoli. The waitress also served bread, olive oil, and cheese.They do have a nice wine selection, but they only have a very limited amount of beer to select from. I ended up getting the only IPA that they serve.Overall not bad at all. It did cost $20 for my meal, in my mind I paid a little too much for it. The beer I got costed $8. The waitress also did ask us for more tip money because of the certain tip expectation percentage. This was what left a sour taste in my mouth and would make me reconsider coming back again.",3.0
"I came here at 7 PM after not eating a single thing for the entire day, so if they hadn't done well, I would've really let them have it! But my dinner was excellent. I've walked past PT Restaurant a million times and never tried it. It's also been on my list of bookmarks since the dawn of my Yelp account and every time I walk by, I end up opting for something else in the area. We arrived at a prime dinner time and there were only two other people (at one table) in the entire place. Not the best sign, but at least I knew they'd have no excuse to not be timely with our food. My girlfriend and I split the fried mozzarella antipasti special, she had the spinach and buffalo ricotta ravioli, and then I went for the short ribs entree special. She finished up with dessert here, while I was in the mood for something chocolate and they were fresh out of chocolate, so I passed on the sweets.Fried Mozzarella--pretty good, should be served with a bit more marinara sauce. I have to say when I make my own high-quality fried mozzarella at home, I certainly season it more. This could have used a little more love in the salt and fresh pepper department and maybe they want to sprinkle the cheese with a bit of oregano before they fry it up. Just a thought. Ravioli-- not mine, but absolutely delicious! I had one pasta pocket stuffed with spinach and ricotta, tossed in marinara and it was light, perfectly seasoned, pasta had a great texture. Good thing this is on their regular menu because I definitely will want my own order. Short ribs special-- OMFG. These beer-braised babies were so juicy and so tender (I would've been pissed if you sold me something you claim is braised and it was anything other than fall-off-the-bone). Seasoned very well and served on a small bed of mashed potatoes. They could've thrown me a veggie here, but fine. The potatoes were a  bit scarce, but there was a giant honking amount of beef on the plate, so all is forgiven. I used my butter knife only as a polite formality since we were out in public, but the fork was really all I needed to force the meat to fall off into perfect mouthfuls. Cooked perfectly, had a really nice jus that complemented the whole thing- YUM!My friend ordered a slice of pumpkin cheesecake, which was pretty good, but not my personal cup of tea. I should have come here many years ago, and now that I know, I'll be making at least occasional visits to hear the specials, or grab ravioli. Thanks, PT!",4.0
Good traditional Italian food! Nice ambiance and great service. Are waiter Johnathan was very nice and gave us great recommendations! Pasta was aldente and flavorful. Could use some better dessert options bread pudding was a bit dry.,3.0
"How to fall in love at PT with someone or simply with PT's contemporary Italian fare:Step 1: ""Dress for success."" Or wear something sexy that will stretch easily, and still look good on you after you inhale your spicy lobster pasta dish, a particular fave amongst PT's fans/patrons. My date was planning our second P/T visit while he was still eating this huge dish of pasta (looked like it could feed two), and I nodded in approval, savoring my soft-shell crabs. They were everything you could ask for in a fresh, buttery, sweet soft shell crab. And they were served with broccoli that was married off to garlic and lived happily ever after. Step 2: Go there on July 4th after watching the spectacular fireworks show, and make some fireworks of your own. Not hard to do in PT's quaint, intimate setting perfect for the 3rd or 4th date. The golden lights draped across the wall is my favorite thing about the romantic, rustic, old-world charm of this Williamsburg restaurant.Step 3: If your date is three or more mins late--late is late and three minutes with a near-dead mobile is like an eternity--don't hesitate to ask the waiter/ bartender/manager for anything, really. I couldn't get a signal and my phone was dying quickly, so they offered me the restaurant's phone to call my date. I ordered a glass of white wine during ""the wait,"" and they gave me bread as well, and after my date came they gave us cheese, olives, olive oil and more bread. Simple and standard touches that showed me they put effort in to making their patrons feel as comfy as possible. Step 4: Drink lots of wine. We were enamored with the wine that our server/bartender recommended for us, especially the sizes of the glasses that he poured for us. We couldn't even finish them. My first experience leaving wine on the table. Step 5: Leave PT with a smile, knowing that you'll be back.",5.0
"This place is rated so well on yelp, we thought for sure we were gonna love it. Not just that, you could not find a more cozy spot.  Unfortunately, we had a negative experience here in almost every respect.  First, our order was not put in so the food did not come out until I finally asked someone to check on it.  It took forever.  Second, when the food finally did come out, it was not good.  How bad can chicken parm be?  Well, in this case, pretty bad. I don't know if the chicken was fully cooked.  Despite this, by the time the food came, I was starved and ate more of it than I should have. My gf's pasta was overcooked and just kinda meh. Every restaurant can have an off night, maybe this was the case here.  On a positive note, I can say that the staff was very nice and did not end up charging us for the entrees (just the wine and app).  We won't be back, but based on the yelp reviews, maybe our experience was just a one-off.",2.0
"Spaghetti pomodoro was pretty good -- very clean and fresh tasting.  Most people would probably say it was a little bland even, but I generally enjoy a bit more bland food.  Vongole pasta was decent as well.  The fresh pasta noodles were well cooked to al dente.  Overall food was good, but I wouldn't say this is one of the best Italian in Brooklyn by any means.Service was weird and below par.  When asked for some recommendations on wine, server listed one fairly pricey option, and when prompted for any others, he just stared at me blankly.  Didn't really check up on us or make any real effort during the meal and brought the check without asking about dessert or even clearing our plates, and then claimed someone at the table asked for it when they didn't.  Weirdo. Pretty cool vibe, downstairs cellar.  Dark and intimate, not too loud.",2.0

"The hubby and I came in on a Saturday at 8:30pm. No reservations can be made for a party of two but we were assured we'd be able to be seated without an issue. Indeed the wait was less than 5min.Ambiance: typical Williamsburg spot. Can fit about 20 people. Cozy with dim light Service: excellent - very attentive Food: we had the toast with topping of the day (grilled peppers and caramelized onions) with a salad ($9.50) as an appetizer. We then both had the full lobster and spaghetti (mildly spicy) ($32) Both the appetizer and the main dish were tasty and nice in size.For Desert, we had the bread pudding and ice cream ($8) and the homemade tiramisu ($8). The tiramisu was average, and I wasn't a fan of the bread pudding but my date liked it.Overall it was a pleasant experience and we will most likely be back for the lobster",4.0
"My friend had hyped this place up a lot and I was really looking forward to having an outstanding low key dinner. We came in around 7:30 on a Tuesday night and besides us the place was completely empty. I will say service was amazing but the food was underwhelming. We split the artichoke sausage appetizer, which I thought was yummy but a little too vinegar-y. I ordered the pasta with tomato sauce and homemade sausage (yes again) and my friend had the salmon. The pasta was just OK, and was missing that special kick I was hoping for. According to my friend the salmon was amazing, but he did get sick after so I'm not too sure on how fresh it was. Overall, was it a decent meal? Yes. Would I go back? Probably not.",3.0
"I love this place. It's unassuming from the outside - I walked past it a bunch of times and thought it was closed before I realized it's just kind of submerged. That makes it a cute, intimate date spot. Everyone who works there has been so great and nice and they can impressively remember a hundred specials. Everything I've had has been on point. Bolognese, linguine with clams, this pasta with spicy sausage my bf always gets, really everything. The bread is also good. If I could get away with eating pasta every day, they would see me, well...every day. I really want to come back on a Sunday for the lobster pasta, I saw someone else order it once and it looked amazing.",5.0

"What a great spot! We went here on a recommendation the Saturday night before Mother's Day and were not disappointed.  First off let me say if you can plan far enough in advance to make reservations than do it, we had a party of 4 and I was so glad we called ahead.  This place was packed with a constant stream of patrons from 7-10.  We chose to sit inside, which was nice and cozy.  They also offer seating out back in their patio which was cute, quiet and green.Our waiter was so nice and friendly, he helped us make some choices and were very happy with the food and service.  We started off with the calamari and fried mozzerella specials- both were standard, nothing overly great about them but still enjoyable.  For our dinners we ordered the fusilli pasta special, ravioli special, lamb chop and Gnocchi al gorgonzola.  All were fabulous- just the right size and all the flavor!!We shared a bottle of wine, which they had many bottles that I never heard of so it was nice to try something new, which we did on our waiter's recommendation.  I would most certainly go back! Yum!",5.0
"Stopped for happy hour before dinner, just as they opened. Amazing service!!! Even better food!!!The beef carpaccio was perfect!The cheese plate was great, and the toasted crostini had the best roasted red pepper topper I think I've ever had.

"I came to PT for the first time last night. Reading the reviews of other reviewers that have more then one experience at PT I wish I had visited PT before the changes other reviewers state that has happened. Anyway me and my bf came to PT after going to cubana social and not being able to get a table, we called PT before walking over there since it's far from the L train station. The woman who answered the phone was very nice and said they had tables that they would be able to squeeze us in. Great! We were cold and hungry, it was a very cold night last night lol. We got there and we were seated immediately near the door there's two tables it's very nice and romantic. We ordered the calamari and the Taglier Insaccati I think it was called its a platter of meats. The calamari was nice with a spicy tomato sauce. The waiter took a very long time to bring the meats out, our calamari came out first. The waiter brought out the bread and cheese, we ate all the bread and cheese then the meats came out. I was disappointed because I grab the prosciutto took a bite and it was frozen, it tasted like the freezer yuck! I became uninterested to try any of the other meats because I was disgusted with how bad the prosciutto tasted. On to the main course I got the penne bolognese and my bf got the malloredus sapori. My pasta was okay it wasn't mind blowing goodness, it was kind of hard and yes I know it's supposed to be Aldente but it tasted so dry. My bf liked his he said the sausage was good and spicy. The service was great though they are very friendly and even if your kind of secluded from the restaurant when you sit up near the door they still come and ask you if your okay, the receipt said our waiters name was Claudio. I like the place and the food was okay. I want to make another visit just to give it another try.",3.0
"Very nice atmosphere with outdoor seating in the back. The food and service were both excellent. To start you off they serve you bread with Pecorino truffle cheese, a mild cheese that went great with the thin chips they also served. I got a mista salad which was a nice appetizer, just your basic salad.  For my entrée I got the spaghetti pomodoro, which I couldn't be happier with. The pasta was very easy to bite into and can tell it was prepared fresh in the kitchen. The sauce was a nice touch to it and not to heavy so you feel satisfied after eating it. I would recommend it to people in the neighborhood for a nice meal.",4.0
"We've been here yesterday night and we found it a bit disappointing. We've been seated in the garden outside, which is really nice, and we ordered Mallureddus and gnocchi with Gorgonzola and mushrooms. We are Italians an I can say they were nothing special. Mallureddus were fine, even if the sauce was a bit too salty, and gnocchi were a bit too much done and I couldn't find a single mushroom. When we asked for the bill we also realized the had applied a 20% tip at the total... I don't know if that's common but it was the first time that happened to me in U.S. and I found it the worst way to end the dinner.",3.0
"Holy yum.Stopped into this quaint spot late on a Tuesday evening after a nightlong adventure in Brooklyn. We were one of only three tables seated and we came HUNGRY. Our waiter was attentive and super friendly, immediately picking up on the stomach growls and rushing to get us a basket of delicious bread.We ordered the caprese as our starter, and it was amazing. The mozzarella was perfect and the basil tasted so fresh. For our mains, we ordered the spaghetti and the penne with meat sauce. While I absolutely LOVED the simplicity of my spaghetti, the real winner at the table was the meat sauce on the penne. Super meaty, incredibly flavorful...truly ah-mazing.All an all, a great first experience at PT. There's also an awesome outdoor patio dining area that I will absolutely be hitting up this summer.

"Very hole in the wall for sure. You would never expect it to be what it is until you walk it.

Especially with the lights and flowers in the back. Service was great, very nice & genuine Italian people who own the place might I add! Food was great, not the cheapest but worth it! Will definitely be going back soon!",4.0
"Yummy!Went out for dinner a few weeks back, and it was great. A bit of a wait, no biggie. We were seated and began to take a look at the menu, which was extremely difficult to see in the dim lighting.. I don't wear glasses and have perfect vision, so I'm not blind. Ordered some mussels in white wine sauce which was delicious!I got salmon which was a special, the bff got linguini with clam sauce, auntie got the lamb chops. My salmon was delicious, I just wish it had more sauce to go with it.The linguini was cooked perfectly, and the clams were fresh and fully opened.The lamb chops were yummy also.For dessert we had bread pudding with some ice cream, delish!Will return!",4.0

"A powerhouse of flavor hidden inside this modestly sized restaurant. IT has a very rustic feel, as does its cuisine. The quality in the ingredients really shine through! We had the Lobster Special, the 20oz Porterhouse Steak, and the Prince Edward Mussels.Lobster Sunday Special - This dish is a 1.5 lb lobster atop a bed of perfectly al dente spaghetti. The lobster was cooked in a tomato-based sauce and tasted fresh and succulent! The spaghetti was perfect as well, I loved the flavor that the lobster contributed to the sauce; which really made this dish. Basically, this dish was perfect and is definitely worth ordering. 20 oz Porterhouse Steak came with a bed of salty spinach and roasted potatoes. We ordered this medium rare, and it came out moist, tender and flavorful.  I would definitely recommend the Prince Edward Mussels, as it seems it is a very popular appetizer here. The broth is tomato-based with a hint of cilantro and lemon. Topped with their delicious crusty bread to dip in the broth, it is such a satisfying appetizer!This restaurant is great for a sophisticated dinner or casual catch-up meal with friends. PT is definitely a well-hidden Brooklyn Gem.",5.0

"Came here for dinner one evening and fell in love. It is seriously a little gem in Brooklyn. We sat outside in the garden area and it was perfect and very atmospheric. They gave us bread and parmesan cheese as soon as we sat down and my husband and I split a bottle of Chianti. We had the calamari to start with which was delicious and not at all frozen. It came with a sweet pepper sauce that added a nice kick to the dish. I had the spaghetti pomodoro which was spaghetti with tomato sauce, basil and buffalo mozzarella. It was amazing, I am not certain but I believe the pasta was homemade. My husband ordered the gnocchi with cream sauce and mushrooms and we ended up splitting both of our dishes because we liked them both so much! The cream sauce on the gnocchi was amazing and hit the perfect spot. Our waiter was super sweet and attentive. If I lived in the area this would def. be a spot of mine to frequent.",4.0
"I went to PT this past Valentine's Day with my boyfriend. I must say, from start to finish it was an absolutely wonderful experience. When we walked in the host suggested we wait so we could get a better seat. Five minutes later we were sat. At first we were served this delicious bread and oil, of which we couldn't get enough. For appetizers we got calamari and caprese salad, which were delicious! For dinner I had the rib eye, and he had the gnocchi. The steak was cooked to perfection and the gnocchi melted in your mouth. For dessert we shared the ricotta cheesecake. At first, I was a bit bummed that they didn't have something chocolate oriented for Valentine's Day, but the cake was excellent. Service was also very good despite the dinner rush. Will definitely be coming back!",5.0
"Really cute restaurant with fantastic service! Our waiter was attentive, friendly and helpful. Good wine and food prices. Both the clam spaghettini and spaghetti pomodoro were simple - could've used a little salt but it was much better than getting a salty dish. Calamari and mushroom crostini were both good. The best was their dessert - poached pears a la mode and the cheesecake. One of the best cheesecakes I've had! They gave us limoncello shots and it was awesome! Better than what I had in italy!",4.0

Least preferred food to eat outside of my house? Italian. PT has redefined how I feel about Italian food and how good a little unassuming downstairs place can be. The calamari was the best I've ever had and the marinara had quite a spicy kick to it. 26 ounce porterhouse special? Maddening and grilled to perfection I don't think they used anything other than salt and pepper and the natural beef flavor was amazing. Whole lobster fra diavolo special had the perfect amount of spicy heat and served with excellent angel hair. Complimentary pecorino romano cheese slices and great bread and finished with with complimentary limoncello shots.  Can't wait to come back. Sit at the bar.,5.0
"Wow... Where do I begin. I will keep it short and sweet because I want everyone to read this review.

"The food was tasty, but I wasn't the biggest fan of the serviceWe got mussels for appetizer. I hat seafood, but I was able to tolerate this dish. The sauce is great for dipping the bread. The crispy bread it comes with, is pretty damn good as well. I got the bolognese for dinner. It was pretty alright, I didn't think anything special (admittedly I don't have an Italian food palate and I was super hungry). The wife got the lobster special. It was a lot of food. She got two extra lunches out of it. The bread pudding for dessert was pretty alright as well. I did like the fact they have wine carafes. More places should do that.The head waiter was kind of pushy IMO. He didn't allow me to make my own decision and pretty much ordered for me. I was too indecisive to fight back. And, it seemed there's only one waiter to work the whole room. He pretty much forgot about us once the place because crowded. We were there two hours plus (Dinner shouldn't be over 1.5h, unless you want it be) and more than 20 minutes passed between my final bite and when they asked to deliver the final check.The ambiance was cool though, dark, romantic, indiscreet (you could walk right by it if you're not looking for it). I do think the drinks are a little to expensive to come here as a casual hang out.In all, I don't know how this place maintains a 4.5 star average. I was expecting to be blown away. Sadly, it was my experience, that was blown.",3.0
"Been here on several occasions and the experience was fantastic every time!  The service is always amazing and the food is ALWAYS on point!  (Very fresh, flavorful, and you can tell that it is made with love).  Even the complimentary bread is delicious (they give you a variety to choose from too).In addition to the awesome food and service, the atmosphere is also a plus.  Really good place for a date.  Especially if you can grab a table near the window.  This place gets pretty packed after 8 or so either make a reservation or come early.",5.0
Atmosphere is nice but food was below average. The lobster special is nothing special: it's just a lobster served with average pasta and covered in subpar tomato sauce. The gnocchi was bland despite being smothered in cheese.,2.0

"It pains me to have to post this update but as others here have alluded, PT has taken a nasty slide downward. Was there with out of town friends in August and the experience was downright unpleasant. Especially sad as PT had been one of my favorite New York restaurants. I didn't recognize any of the staff so there obviously has been some sort of change in management or ownership. Still, we were seated by a very nice waitress out back but given menus heavily stained with olive oil. Ick. My wife's mussels in white wine sauce were flavorless as the kitchen forgot to include any garlic. We'd both had it numerous times before and know what it should have tasted like. I ordered the PT salad but was given mixed greens instead. They were out of most beers so I had to settle for a humdrum Peroni. Pacing was way off and the food arrived haphazardly. Some at the table had nearly finished before entrees for others arrived. Temperature was off for half of our dishes. On the way out, I witnessed the kitchen staff arguing about botched orders. Didn't appear to be a chef on duty. I waited two months to post this review as I first relayed my experience to the restaurant via their website. Wanted to be fair and give them a chance to respond. Unfortunately, didn't get a reply. Oh, well. Another once-exceptional Brooklyn eatery bites the dust.",2.0

"Really yummy and simple Italian food.Came here not too long with the boyfriend for a fairly late dinner on a Sunday night. We were seated outside in their lovely backyard. I was a big fan of the complimentary bread that they had served to us before the meal, which included some great crispy sesame flatbread.I got the spaghetti al pomodoro for my meal and the bf got the gnocchi al gorgonzola for his. The spaghetti was amazing and the portion was humongous. The bf also loved his dish, though it's a bit too heavy for myself. Both pasta dishes were flavorful and ""honest"" tasting.

"I've been eating at PT for over three years now and it just has a special place in my heart and stomach. I love so many of their dishes, the cozy feel and above all the service. Ari and Nick have been there for as long as I've been going there and they both are just superb!! They make you feel like family and really keep me coming back. Location - it's located on Bedford Ave on the North side of Williamsburg, which I suppose was the last part of the Burgh to become hipsterized. Lots of restaurant options in the immediate area. You can easily miss it since it isn't on street level, more like a cellar, but def not a basement. not sure if that makes sense to anyone reading this but its the best way i can describe. Decor - lots of rustic charm, the old clock that is above the unassuming bar area is at a stand still, which is symbolic of how I feel everytime I go there. The light fixtures are all industrial looking and minimalist. Overall the decor makes the place super cozy and warm. They also have a garden, which is quiet and nice to sit in on warm days or nights. Crowd - out of all the places I've been to in the Burgh it is def one of the classiest and also one of the less hipster infused. I feel like it is one of those places where you bring your family when they are in town cuz you want to impress them with your good taste in food and NYC restaurant finds. Ari and Nick - for a long time I actually thought they were the owners of this place because it is just uncommon to have two people who care so much about pleasing their customers as these two guys. They really go above and beyond - they give great wine recommendations, food suggestions and descriptions, they've comped some desserts and after dinner drinks (I know there is a name for these drinks I just don't quite remember) - I assume cuz they appreciate that I frequently bring new people to eat there. Food - their food is ahhhhmazing!! I'd give descriptions for each but that would just make this a very long review. My fav of all is the salmon - it's just perfect every single freaking time and for dessert I Always get two and one of them is always the pears with ice cream. Reservations - so last time I called I was directed to make reservations on their website, which requires a credit card to make a reservation and also a $30 charge which will deducted from your bill or charged if you are a no show. Never heard of this anywhere and was not so happy about that. Regardless I just showed up on a Friday night and was seated.",5.0

The pasta is fresh and I could easily eat a different one each day of the week. There was a delicious salmon special too that night we loved (baked with a toasty breadcrumb crust).Saved a little money with an $18 carafe of Montepulciano which was actually more than decent.It filled up and got a little warm -- definitely make reservations well ahead. And when the spring comes around, take advantage of the beautiful back yard.One last point on why they get bumped up to 5 stars. There was a little confusion with our order (99% sure it was our own fault) and we got an extra order of osso bucco instead of the salmon. The waiter apologized and offered to leave the osso bucco to share amongst us and the salmon would be out quickly. We enjoyed that and the salmon did come quickly. Not a word of complaint by them, and in fact, they didn't charge us for either of those two dishes -- and even brought us two desserts on the house to share.

"I am very sad to report a bad experience at PT. The last couple times I have felt like things are going downhill here but last weekend may be the last time I visit. One happy surprise before the bad news. PT has this amazing garden! It is huge and beautifully dimly lit. The food was the problem - I do hate to say it. We have a few menu favorites so we ordered those - the lobster special & the tagliatelle with peas and ham. There was also a short rib special so I jumped on that one as well! The lobster was always the BF's favorite. It was served in a spicy sauce with pasta. YUM. Now they are making it with a regular tomato sauce that was watery and completely flavorless. :( My fav pasta was also a bit below par.. The plate seemed smaller than usual. The short ribs were the worst. I LOVE cooking braised short ribs so I was excited about it but then soooo disappointed. I would say they needed an extra hour cooking. Don't get me wrong, they were cooked just they didn't fall off the bone. I had to pick it up with my hands and attempt to knaw it off the bone.... My friend was so grossed out by the extra fat that hadn't cooked away yet she couldn't even eat it. Oh well, PT was good while it lasted. It is a bummer though because this was one of the few spots I frequented!",2.0
I had an excellent appetizer and pasta plate with many different cheeses. It was a daily special I believe. Service was incredible and the atmosphere was very nice.,5.0
"I went to PT Restaurant once and am already in love with it. The restaurant has a very cozy and intimate feel, which makes it ideal for a date night. We ordered the Spaghetti Al Pomodoro ($14), Penne Bolgnese ($15), and a carafe of Merlot ($18). Everything was delicious! Can't wait to come back.",5.0

"I brought my sister here for her birthday dinner and we had an incredible evening. The space is intimate with candlelit wooden tables. They have these adorable tables for two in the front that are perfect for a romantic date.  The larger tables with the bar stool chairs are not the most comfortable in the world, but the experience more than makes up for it. The overall atmosphere is classy, without the pretentiousness.The food here is authentic Italian cuisine. Everything is extremely fresh and the pasta is made in house. I highly recommend the organic pasta bolognese for an entree and the outrageously good caprese salad for an appetizer. I've had caprese salad a million times before, but PT's is exceptional. The chocolate moose with vanilla bean ice cream for dessert was a party in my mouth. The prices are on the higher side, but nothing out of hand. A perfect Williamsburg restaurant for a nice evening out.",4.0
"As so many others have done-- I need to update my review because the quality of PT has really declined in the last few months.Thought they might be having an off night, but it seems that bland food and really poor service are their new normal.

"Loved it! I'm quite a fan of Italian food and it didn't disappoint. The place is authentic and  has a great atmosphere. The ricotta ravioli were as delicious as the chocolate panacotta we had for dessert. The owner seemed to care a lot about our opinion. The barman was really nice too as he offeredme a glass of wine when I didn't l like what I had ordered. Overall, one of my favourite Bedford restaurants.",5.0
"Very friendly and good service, but while good the food is nothing special.  The squid appetizer had very little flavor and the pasta dish I had while rich was also lacking in the flavor department.  The space is cool and rustic, but the bar stools and chairs are uncomfortable.  And their limoncello is weird and not my favorite, but it was free so there's that.",3.0
"Three stars but we would definitely go back.This place is small (but charming) and if you sit at one of the two-tops near the front, getting in and out of your seat is a little tight. It was busy around 7pm on a Sunday night so I'm glad we had a reservation. We had the lobster special and the gnocchi. The lobster was a whole one on a plate covered in spaghetti type pasta. Not the prettiest thing to look at and the pasta was pretty bland and basic. The gnocchi was interesting but very rich. Nearby patrons ordered the steak which I would order next time.  We enjoyed walking around this neighborhood before our reservation.",3.0
"Went here for dinner with my boyfriend on a Friday night, I called to make a reservation and when we got there we got a nice seat on the balcony looking down into the restaurant. We each for a glass of wine, he got a Chianti and I went with the Merlot both were perfect for us. We started with the calamari and the cause actually had a bit of a kick to it which both my boyfriend and I like. We are also cheese lovers and really enjoyed the bread and cheese that they put on the table. For our main course I went with the special which was lobster fradiavlo it was delicious just what I needed. We will definitely go back!",4.0

"Cute and relatively quiet little Italian restaurant with some traditional and not as traditional dishes.  Came here for date night and similar to Jae C, we were seated in a very tight and cozy table up near the entrance that has a view of the rest of the restaurant.  I would say this place is best suited for groups of 2-6, not sure there would be much more for larger groups.  We asked for some assistance from the waiter, who was attentive and had a great handle on the menu and specials.  A few things that were not on the menu (daily specials) that may alter your decision to come here if you were skeptical at first glance.  Entree specials were a pork shank under a bed of risotto, full lobster (split) sitting on top spaghetti and tomato sauce, and a 20oz porterhouse served with potatoes, broccoli, and a light mushroom sauce.  We decided on a carafe of Chianti ($18 for approx 3 glasses), Artichoke and sausage with parmigiano reggiano, Penne Bolgnese, the 20oz porterhouse that is cut into slices prior to serving, and bread pudding for dessert. All were excellent! I would say that the artichoke and pasta dish were worth getting again. I normally do not order dessert but the bread pudding was perfect; like sliced french toasted and roasted raisins served with ice cream and light chocolate sauce. The steak was delicious and affordable ($26), don't get me wrong, but I see it as something I may forget about a week from now. Check it out!",4.0
"The location is good, and the atmosphere is lovely / cozy / intimate. Our service was good. But the food was terrible. I had a pastry wrapped pork tenderloin, and it was totally overcooked to the point of tough and hard to chew. My husband ordered a pasta, and it had almost no flavor at all. Our friend ordered a pasta dish with lobster. The lobster came inside the shell and was pretty much all shell / no meat. Bad food - we won't go back to eat.

"Oyster Happy Hour: Wednesdays 6 for 5 oysters (Blue Point) Not bad oysters (but they were not great), super cute ambiance, amazing service I love this place!

Once, I went with my friends for some tapas, wine and 6 for 5 dollar oysters happy hour (weds I think!) and the hors dvrs dishes were huge! We ordered two, and they filled us right up. The calamari could have been done better, they were a bit cold so the he'd reheated it on the stove for us but lost the delicious sauce (which might have been the reason it was a bit cold in the first place.) our waitresses insisted it was on the house and gave us a round us a round of limoncello shots.

"PT is everything you have ever been looking for in an Italian restaurant. Authentic food, reasonable prices, and large pours of wine. ""The kind of place you'd want to stumble upon after returning from a trip to Italy"" - New York Mag, and I couldn't have said it better myself. PT also offers a daily happy hour with half price appetizers and wine, and $1 oysters on Wednesday. Go on a Wednesday for the best of both worlds. The best thing here: Their linguini with lobster. Now quickly get the image of a small portion of over priced pasta and five tiny pieces of skimpy lobster out of your head. PT does it right, with a 1.5 pound whole lobster over a plate of glorious al dente linguini with homemade spicy marinara, claw n' all. It's amazing. The lobster is succulent and the pasta is fresh and cooked to al dente perfection. Be sure to try to calamari, and any of their appetizers. My favorite is the Caprese (the mozzarella is so fresh), and Carciofi, grilled artichokes with home made sausage and parmigiano. The pork shoulder and saffron risotto special they had one night was also phenomenal... Best part of this place, is after indulging and leaving stuffed and happily tipsy on vino, the bill won't cost you more than $50 a person max.Shout out to my good friend, Corinne from Brooklyn Munch for taking me here and introducing me to a piece of Italian heaven right here in Williamsburg.",5.0

"Came here after walking by Bistro Petit which was full on a Sunday evening. The first thing you notice is that is quite warm and cozy inside. We were seated in a slightly awkward and tight two seater near the entrance. These seats were elevated above the rest of the restaurant. Great restaurant for a date or small group of friends.We shared a carafe of merlot, calimari, tagliolini and pork shank, which was one of the specials for the evening. The calimari and tagliolini came out first. Calimari was as expected--though I felt it had a nice but not overdone crunch. It came with a tomato sauce which had a slightly spicy kick to it. The tagliolini was extremely rich. The waiter sprinkled some additional cheese on top of the already buttery/cheesy concoction of stringed pasta with ham and green peas . The pork shank came served on top of a bed of saffron risotto. The meat fell right off the bone. The saffron risotto on its own would've made for an excellent dish too but it all came together as a lovely duo.Would've had dessert but was way too full to eat any more. I'll be back for sure.",5.0

"I don't know if it is as good as it gets per se but PT gets every facet of a dining experience right and for that I give it 5 stars.I have lived in Williamsburg for over 4 years and one block from PT for around 2 of those years. I've walked by it more times than I can count and just had never made it in. Last night, for the first time, I went to PT and I am so happy I did.We started off with the shrimp special (shrimp wrapped in bacon and fried, with dijon mustard to dip) and the carpaccio. Both were very good and for completely different reasons. She got the lobster special (lobster over angel hair pasta with marinara) and myself the ravioli (ravioli, stuffed with spinach and buffalo ricotta, served with marinara and basil). The lobster special was phenomenal, a whole lobster on a bed of pasta, and the ravioli was good and very filling.  Combine that with a couple of glasses of wine at reasonable prices ($9 for a solid pour) and some digestifs and you have a fantastic night on Williamsburg's southside.

"Great looking restaurant. Exposed wood, dark, intimate, just the right level of music. Wait staff is informed and very friendly. We started with the calamari appetizer, couple of glasses of wine. For the entree we had the branzino and the spaghetti with fish eggs. Mine was a bit rich with butter/oil paired with roasted potatoes and string beans. The spaghetti with fish eggs was VERY fishy tasting, so not for everybody.Overall good, with pretty reasonable prices.",4.0
"Would give PT six stars if possible. Amazing dinner there tonight, simply could not fault it.We started with an olive selection and a dozen natural oysters.

All dishes were perfectly prepared and presented.Two of us followed with desserts...pear and ice cream for me and choc mousse for my daughter, both fab!Service was intelligent, helpful and warm, without being intrusive. Our host (owner too I think) gave sparkling dessert wines to my wife and I on the house.",5.0
"Ambience was comfortable and Romantic. Waitstaff was warm and welcoming which was a good start but as soon as we received our menus ( which were soiled) we knew we were in for a bad experience. We ordered the cheese and charcuterie boards to start and were disappointed. The bread that accompanied our cheese plate was stale and the cheese and sliced meats were on top of wilted greens. Some of the leaves were rotten and completely unnecessary. We started with ordering a bottle of barbera D'alba that was way over priced. The quality of the wine did not match the mark up on the wine list. A lot of the items on the menu were completely out of season, such as peas, asparagus and mango on a salad, mid winter? Their pastas were obviously all dry, there was nothing fresh about them. The gnocchi was greasy and lacking the mushrooms that the menu had claimed was in the dish . Overall very disappointing Italian food .",1.0
"Great space, intimate underground type. Had a carafe of wine, the eggplant special (great portion size, delicious, and only $8!), linguine with clams, and the 16 oz Porterhouse special for Thursday nights.

"Came here for dinner tonight, and was very impressed.  Me and my fiance are staying in Brooklyn for the weekend, and it is her birthday on monday, and we both love Italian food.

"Came here after walking by Bistro Petit which was full on a Sunday evening. The first thing you notice is that is quite warm and cozy inside. We were seated in a slightly awkward and tight two seater near the entrance. These seats were elevated above the rest of the restaurant. Great restaurant for a date or small group of friends.We shared a carafe of merlot, calimari, tagliolini and pork shank, which was one of the specials for the evening. The calimari and tagliolini came out first. Calimari was as expected--though I felt it had a nice but not overdone crunch. It came with a tomato sauce which had a slightly spicy kick to it. The tagliolini was extremely rich. The waiter sprinkled some additional cheese on top of the already buttery/cheesy concoction of stringed pasta with ham and green peas . The pork shank came served on top of a bed of saffron risotto. The meat fell right off the bone. The saffron risotto on its own would've made for an excellent dish too but it all came together as a lovely duo.Would've had dessert but was way too full to eat any more. I'll be back for sure.",5.0

"I don't know if it is as good as it gets per se but PT gets every facet of a dining experience right and for that I give it 5 stars.I have lived in Williamsburg for over 4 years and one block from PT for around 2 of those years. I've walked by it more times than I can count and just had never made it in. Last night, for the first time, I went to PT and I am so happy I did.We started off with the shrimp special (shrimp wrapped in bacon and fried, with dijon mustard to dip) and the carpaccio. Both were very good and for completely different reasons.

"Small, dark, intimate, amazing food. This is now my favorite Italian restaurant in New York City. My date & I ordered a carafe of wine (note: they are small carafes so we ended up getting two, just go for a bottle) calamari (fresh & delish), linguini con vongole (I wanted more clams they were so good!), and the Pork shank over risotto (AH-MAZING). The wait staff was so nice and did not keep coming over to check on us every 15 minutes. A true Italian meal is not rushed or bothered & it is clear at PT they serve by this rule. I LOVE IT. I will definitely go back to PT for a date night & as a place to bring my friends that can appreciate a true Italian dinner.",5.0

"I think this will become my new favorite restaurant haha. The food is soo delicious here.     There were only two waiters here when I came in on a Monday. They were both very helpful with everything. Although the weather was really bad and it was a Monday night there were a good amount of people in the restaurant which just shows that the food is good. The decor is very cute  and intimate, this place looks like it should be in the east village honestly.     Out waiter chose a wine for us that was similar to a Malbec but tasted better. My loud and obnoxious date and I shared the ravioli for an app and it was really good.... I also love when an Italian restaurant gets the ratio of the filling and size of the ravioli right. My date had the salmon which was a special that night with roasted potatoes and broccoli and he loved it. I had a special for the night as well which was a T-bone steak with potatoes and broccoli that was really good. My steak was cooked almost perfectly. I do wish the knife they gave me wasn't so dull because it was a pain to cut the steak. I made my date get dessert because I wanted to try two lol and the waiter helped me convince him. We got the creme brûlée and they did not disappoint.  We also got the chocolate ricotta, I think that's what it was, with a berry jelly. That was ok but if you not a fan of really sweet stuff that dessert would be for you. All in all I'm looking forward to the next time I come here!",5.0
"Went on a Saturday evening with no reservations but luckily they were able to squeeze us in at the end of the bar. Very cozy place with a romantical feel. The bread was served with olive oil for dipping. There were also these large, crispy crackers in the bread basket. Oh, and I can't forget the cheese. Each person got a small wedge to try. No idea what kind it was but it was yummy!  Went with one of the specials for dinner, the duck with a strawberry sauce. It came with roasted potatoes and sauteed kale. Would have preferred the duck skin to be crispier, and the meat more tender. The sweetness of the strawberry complimented the duck perfectly. I never would have put the 2 flavors together but it worked well in this dish. The portions were generous and the price ($20) was very reasonable. Also tried the ravioli, which was delicious. There was a shot of Sambuca on the house offered to each guest at the end of the meal. Went down sooooo smoothly.",4.0
"I've been here twice in a row this weekend and love this place.  The staff is incredibly warm and attentive.  The food is great, and the atmosphere is beautiful.  The only strike may be that it's slightly too dark.

"We have become somewhat regulars at this place. We just love it so much. Also, living a block away doesn't hurt. We love how the menu changes seasonally.

"Uninspired but acceptable.I would caution any who is brought here on a first date. Sure sign that the person taking you out is just that, uninspiring but acceptable. You should avoid this person as an invitation here is an clear indication of boring taste. You know the conversation will be cordial but monotonous, and the sex satisfactory but nothing to write home about. This is a restaurant for safe people, leave your daring at the door. He will probably be wearing khakis. But based on the reviews here I guess that works for some. Of all the fantastic and diverse Italian wines available at affordable prices, their wines by the glass show a distinct lack of effort. They seem lazily picked without a thought towards guest enjoyment. The bottle list isn't that much better. The food was decent but unmotivated. The long dull menu left me indifferent so we just ordered a few things. They were done decently but they were fundamentally boring. Even classic dishes can be exhilarating if done with careful preparation and quality ingredients. These just felt lazy. Service was professional. Ambience good. But its all for naught if the cuisine is a yawn.",3.0

"I came here with my girlfriend on a Thursday night. The place was not packed which was perfect. The thing I didn't really like was that there were only two staffs working the front. I stood there for seats while one staff was taking orders and the other one was inside the back. Eventually I just walked for a table instead of being seated down. The place is pretty romantic with candles and dimmed lights. I would say the Blue Point Oysters were the best we had that night. 2 dollars each and we both had half a dozen. Should of ordered more but we had entrees coming, which took 45 minutes for spaghetti and mozzarella and the gnocchi with creamy sauce. Everything was up to standards according to the ratings that were posted for PT. Oh yeah, the bathroom door is a bit messed up. I don't think they will fix that, as well as the clock above the bar.

"I love Italian food. I could eat pasta every day of the week. And don't even get me started about my obsession with basil (I seriously eat the leaves on their own). So when my sister told me about this quaint little Italian restaurant that she found where she lives, I knew I had to have her take me there when I went to visit. Consider this my love letter to PT.PT is located at 331 Bedford St. in the Williamsburg area of Brooklyn. As a bonus, you can walk down Bedford and browse the funky little shops they have which will help you work up an appetite! We walked into the restaurant, past a few tables right by the open windows, and down a couple of steps into the establishment. I immediately fell in love the with place (and all without seeing the menu yet)! Its dimly lit with small candles on each table & the bar. The tables are all a dark wood which fits in nicely with the rest of the place. There is a brick walll and a fireplace that has tiny Christmas lights lit in it. The bar is sleek & clean and very inviting.  You really can't help but feel at home in this establishment.So lets discuss the most important thing - the FOOD! All I can really say is OH MY GOD. I don't think I will ever have Italian this good, unless I actually decide to hop a flight to Italy. The meal always starts with imported, organic goat cheese flown in from Italy. You also get a basket of bread & seasoned oil, along with these wafer crisp, almost potato chip like things that I have yet to ask about but I should because they are addicting! Between the cheese & bread, I could easily fill up quickly on just that and wine.I've actually eaten at PT 3 times in the past 3 months (yes, I visit NY as often as possible)!  Each time I've had something different and each time I've been completely floored by the excellence of the food. On my first visit I had the rigatoni bolognese. I'm picky about my sauce and this did not disappoint. The sauce had a nice zest and you could tell the meat was very fresh! This isn't sauce that sits around for months on end. I've also had the spaghetti pomodoro, which comes with fresh mozzarella & fresh basil (refer back to the first paragraph and know my excitement of this feature). Perfect dish and I ate the whole thing, leaving satisfied but not feeling disgustingly full! Last dish I tried was the tagliolini all'emiliana - a nice homemade pasta with ham, peas, parmigiano & a cream sauce. It is so rich and creamy with flavor exploding on your taste buds from the first bite to the last!I've also had the caprese salad and the calamari. Both excellent starters that will not disappoint. If you save room for dessert, make sure you get the tiramisu. It is one of the BEST tiramisu's I've had...period. The sweet flavor isn't overbearing and I believe they use something other than lady fingers in their recipe. Its light & fluffy yet decadent with that lovely espresso soaked kick. Trust me...get the tiramisu when you go.The food, the service, the ambience - you couldn't ask for a better place to eat. I am taking my husband there in a few weeks for his first time. I almost feel guilty that I've eaten there three times without him. With food that good though I can try to erase that guilt though.Mangia!",5.0

"The back garden in this cozy Italian place is lovely. It's a shame the service ruins a big portion of the experience. We were left alone for 25 minutes without attention or service from our waiter. In addition, his style was aggressive, which is not congruent with the laidback vibe of the place. Either the wait staff is severely understaffed or our friendly Italian waiter isn't much concerned about paying attention of his patrons. Unusually long waits for every part of the experience made an otherwise nice evening frustrating. We had the artichoke and caprese appetizers, which were the best part of the meal. Very tasty indeed. Our main dishes were OK. I recommend the tagliolini with ham and pea. But I can't recommend PT unless they seriously rehaul their service. Well, it was mostly this one waiter, the others were very accomodating.",2.0
"The first thing I noticed about PT was that there was no one there at 8 pm on a Thursday. Usually not a good sign, but I was hungry and we were already there.* We walked outside to the secluded garden, which was quiet and perfect for a low-key meal. And in truth, everyone there was destined to eat well: the three of us, another couple in the corner, and the mosquitoes. No one else wanted to eat a house like I did, so we just shared three dishes. 1. The parmesan asparagus appetizer had wonderful flavor, even if they were the saddest, skinniest specimens I've seen in a long time. 2. I found that I enjoy my buddy's mom's linguine with clam sauce** more than PT, but theirs is still very nice. The clams were a bit tough, but there certainly were a decent amount of them. 3. The generous portion of pork tenderloin wrapped in puff pastry was actually juicy and well cooked, and the potato, carrot and zucchini accompaniments were also well-executed. My only complaint would be that the sauce between the pork and puff pastry seemed to be dijon mustard, straight out of the bottle. This would've been fine, but it was decidedly reminiscent of a ham sandwich. Also, in the darkness, one of my companions asked if it was wrapped in bacon, and after that I was disappointed it was merely puff pastry.Overall, PT is a solid Italian spot with a lovely garden. Just beware the mosquitoes in summer. *This is how many of my decisions are made.**Not a euphemism.",3.0

"We came here for a family dinner and was lucky enough to get a reservation for 9 on an hour notice. The service was nearly perfect overall, but then again we did go over the top with 3 bottles of wine and 2 bottles of champagne. Anyhow service wise, the servers were enthusiastic, very attentive, checked up on each set of dishes in a timely manner, they were very polite and gave us excellent treatment.The calamari was my favorite of our appetizers. Lightly crisp, but still chewy on the inside. Absolutely mouthwatering. My next favorite were the mussels which was a special for the day. Well cooked, all the mussels were open and easily accessible with a light sauce. For my entree I got Paillard di pollo. The chicken was completely flattened, tender and juicy, and packed with flavor. My only regret was not ordering the porterhouse which was a daily special and looked absolutely mouth watering! I wasn't a fan of the tiramisu, but the chocolate mousse dessert was amazing!",5.0
"What a wonderful evening! We had such a pleasant time and the food was excellent. With such an extensive wine list we were having trouble choosing which to try. The waiter asked if he could surprise us with two glasses of red. They were both delicious and we enjoyed the element of surprise. While we ordered plain pastas (spaghetti pomodoro and penne bolognese) the waiter asked again if he could surprise us with a more interesting pasta to go with the bolognese. He brought tortellini and it was another excellent choice! To top off the night he brought is two glasses of dessert wine on the house. The place was charming, the food was great, and the dinner was full of surprising treats! I'll definitely be returning for more",5.0
"Well, I have found my favorite Italian restaurant in NYC. Best News? It's less than a block from my house. I must have walked past PT thousands of times; I've walked past it at least twice a day, every day since I've moved to Brooklyn. Totally unassuming from the outside, I must admit I never really felt compelled to go. Last week I was walking past on a weekend night and it was totally packed. I took a look at the menu and figured it was definitely time to go. What I experienced last night was absolutely 100% amazing; everything about PT is perfect. It's the quintessential Italian restaurant in every category possible. First off, the atmosphere is amazing. It's in a ""basement"" and so it's very quaint and cozy. It's all wood in there, and flowers and a big bar. The tables are close together but I didn't mind. It's a good thing we made a reservation because there were people having to wait throughout the night. The service is also impeccable. Our server was great and everyone is on their game, has great timing and is just so friendly. We took a look at the wine list, totally extensive with lots of inexpensive options. Including by the glass, bottles, and caraffes / half caraffes. I opted for a $9 glass of Nero D'Avola, and what was put in front of me was the tastiest and biggest glass of wine ever. The pours there are very generous. How Italian! When the waiter listed the specials I almost fell off my chair. A hangar steak (which I got a glimpse of when I was walking out, holy crap), a duck in strawberry glaze, a meat lasagna, and a whole lobster over linguini. Appetizer specials included mussels and a shrimp, stuffed with fontina cheese and wrapped in bacon. This is not one of those restaurants where you go and you get what looks good and that's it; it's one of those where you have to go back ASAP because you wanted everything. The regular menu seemed equally as inticing; caprese, carpaccio, calamari, proscuitto and cheese platters, everything. We ultimately went with the carpaccio and the stuffed shrimp special for appetizers, and then I got the whole lobster over linguini and my boyfriend got the ravioli. Additionally, they also brought out a bread basket with so many (unique) amazing kinds of break, and olive oil (so good) and the freshest and almost creamy pecorino romano ever. Before we even got our food I was sold. Okay, so the shrimp comes and is unlike any way I've ever had shrimp, I definitely likd it. The filet carpaccio was lemony and olive-oily and so fresh and phenominal. At this point I am buzzed, stuffed and haven't even gotten my food yet. Then the food came: when I say the lobster was massive and my entire plate (probably a foot across) was stuffed with pasta and lobster. The pasta's sauce was nice and clean and spicy with lots of basil and parmesan. So amazing. The lobster. Was. So. Good. I ate the whole thing and was literally so full I couldn't move for the rest of the night. Thank the lord our houses were only a block away. The ravioli was equally as good and filling. After we declined dessert for fear of literally exploding, the waiter came over and gave us some shots of Sambuca. All of this ended up being about $80, and we gave the guy a big tip because we loved him / everything so much.All in all, you must go here. It's the best and I can't wait to go back like every day. They have an outdoor area during warm weather and have specials during the week; like lobsters or 6 for $5 oysters, $5 glasses of wine for happy hour. Just everything is so authentic and absolutely delicious. I can't believe this went untried for so long, it's right under my nose! I recommend making a reservation, and you've got to go there for yourself to see this food. It was too dark in there for great pictures! Walk around the corner to Dram to finish the night off right.",5.0

"Went here on the recommendation of yelpers and really enjoyed the experience overall, just a few things dropped it from a solid 4 to a 3.First the good, the garden in back is so nice. We really loved the setting hidden away in the back.  The restaurant was empty when we arrived, but the garden had a pretty good crowd.The food overall was quite good and the service was very friendly.The things that brought down the rating were that both pastas we tried were just underdone (not al dente, which I like, but truly undercooked).  And though the service was friendly, our waiter completely disappeared for a very long stretch of time after checking on us once when our entrees arrived.  So long, in fact, that we were about to get up and go looking for him so we could get our check before he reappeared.  This despite a not too busy night and other waiters working with him. Overall, a good but not great neighborhood spot.",3.0
"Despite all these reviews I didn't have crazy expectations.. But when the bread is stale, the mussels not too fresh, the wine tasting like box wine, and the food took a whole hour and a half to arrive, it's hard not to be disappointed! I do admit, the place is gorgeous! We sat in the garden area and it was extremely charming, perfect lighting, and the seating very comfortable! If I were to rate the setting alone I will give it a 5 stars hands down! But the food and the service were waayy too bad to go back to the restaurant! Yes we were a large group.. 7 of us.. And maybe since the tip was included already the waiters didn't care but there is no excuse for the bad food and wine!",2.0
"Visited in October 2013, ordered the gnocchi and lobster spaghetti special, both which were delicious and expertly cooked.  Prices were very reasonable considering the quality and quantity of the food. Love the decor, hip but cosy at the same time. Excellent service without being intrusive, especially from the attentive restaurant manager. Still having dreams about that lobster! Visited this on the recommendation of Yelp and was not disappointed.",5.0
"The back garden in this cozy Italian place is lovely. It's a shame the service ruins a big portion of the experience. We were left alone for 25 minutes without attention or service from our waiter. In addition, his style was aggressive, which is not congruent with the laidback vibe of the place. Either the wait staff is severely understaffed or our friendly Italian waiter isn't much concerned about paying attention of his patrons. Unusually long waits for every part of the experience made an otherwise nice evening frustrating. We had the artichoke and caprese appetizers, which were the best part of the meal. Very tasty indeed. Our main dishes were OK. I recommend the tagliolini with ham and pea. But I can't recommend PT unless they seriously rehaul their service. Well, it was mostly this one waiter, the others were very accomodating.",2.0
"The first thing I noticed about PT was that there was no one there at 8 pm on a Thursday. Usually not a good sign, but I was hungry and we were already there.* We walked outside to the secluded garden, which was quiet and perfect for a low-key meal. And in truth, everyone there was destined to eat well: the three of us, another couple in the corner, and the mosquitoes. No one else wanted to eat a house like I did, so we just shared three dishes. 1. The parmesan asparagus appetizer had wonderful flavor, even if they were the saddest, skinniest specimens I've seen in a long time. 2.

This was my first visit and I was pleased with the excellent service provided by Erik. He did a amazing job of recommending a red wine (can't locate on the menu) which was a perfect complement to COSTOLETTE D'AGNELLO (lamb) my friend ordered as well as the chicken and vegetables dish I ordered. The muscles we ordered as an appetizer were delicious.The only sad part of it all is that my phone died and I didn't get to take note of the wine I ordered. I have to find out and there is only ONE solution, I must got back and get this review right. I'm absolutely sure I will be delighted with anything on their menu.

"I usually do not write a positive review for restaurants but I wanted to write a small piece of comment about PT in williamsburg. PT has been one of my favorite places for dining out for quite some time. When I dine out, I look for quality food, quality service, and atmosphere. PT has it all. I love the food, atmosphere, friendly service and many more that PT offers. They have lobster pasta, which is my favorite (highly recommend). It is somewhat spicy but perfect for my taste. Their red wines can be perfect pairing! Also, their price is more than reasonable. Keep up the good work, PT.",5.0
"This is a very, very conflicted review. I went here for a romantic dinner with the hubby-to-be, and the wait looked like it would pass. The hostess said that we could sit out back in the garden area and we'd go inside when a table opened up. The ambiance, gotta say, is just gorgeous. The radio even played our song. Before I go further--the Maitre 'D SAVED the meal for us. We ended up spending 4 hours waiting for our food. But, the gracious and hilarious guy would come out, crack a fatigued joke, bring us a complimentary carafe of wine, and apologize for the wait. Apparently they were trying out a new chef, and his frankness was extremely refreshing. After being to countless restaurants with servers that bullshit to cover their ass, this guy just stood there and said, ""I'm not proud to come out here. I could punch the cook tonight. Here's more wine."" ...all told, 3 carafes and a shot of sambuca later, (none of which showed up on our bill), we were shitfaced.

"This is our third time in this incredible place, and it never fails. The quality of food compared to the price is ridiculous- one of the best places to get your steak on!

"Came here to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday. We got the carpaccio and oysters as appetizers. Both were delicious! I got the spinach ravioli for my entree and he got the lobster special. Everything was very yummy and the presentation was great too! The portions were just right and prices are very reasonable for Williamsburg. The service was quick and very pleasant. They picked out the perfect wine for us and even brought out my boyfriend's dessert with a candle. They also treated us to homemade limoncello. We'll definitely go back, soon! Thank you for a great night!",5.0

"My review of PT was overdue. I had been trying to find out the name of the dishes I had that night so I could share that with you, but unfortunately they were the special of the day.Let me just say that I had a complicated commute to Brooklyn that night and all was forgotten once I entered this lovely cozy restaurant. This was my first visit and I was pleased with the excellent service provided by Erik. He did a amazing job of recommending a red wine (can't locate on the menu) which was a perfect complement to COSTOLETTE D'AGNELLO (lamb) my friend ordered as well as the chicken and vegetables dish I ordered. The muscles we ordered as an appetizer were delicious.The only sad part of it all is that my phone died and I didn't get to take note of the wine I ordered. I have to find out and there is only ONE solution, I must got back and get this review right. I'm absolutely sure I will be delighted with anything on their menu. The food and service is a GREAT.",4.0

"This was a wonderful restaurant. I took my fiancee here for Valentine's Day because it was recommended to me by a friend and I couldn't have been more happy. He had steak and I had the chicken with green salad. It was all cooked to perfection. For dessert he had the creme brulee and I had the mousse. I couldn't get enough of either one of them. I wish we had asked to meet the chef because he deserves a standfing ovation. Our waiter was unbelievable. Such a personable gentleman that was very attentive and always checked to make sure we were doing okay. The only down side was the hostess. She I felt was very unprofessional. When I walked in she just stared at me from the bar. My fiancee got there 2 minutes before me and sat down. Once I sat down, she didn't even walk over to bring us menus she just stood at the bar eating. Mind you when other people behind me walked in she greeted them helped them to a seat and all. I found it to be very rude and unacceptable. All customers should be treated the same no matter what ethnicity but it seemed that my ethnicity didn't deserve any type of attention from her. Overall I give the experience a B+. I just wish that the hostess had made us feel as welcomed as the waiter did.",4.0
"Its rare that I am so impressed with an establishment given my somewhat captious demeanor when it comes to food/wine/hospitality. My nitpicking is due in part to my work experience in high-end and Michelin Star rated restaurants, so the standard has been set pretty high (occupational hazard). Still, I find no areas to critique when reviewing my dining experience at PT. This weekend was no different when I had a casual, comfortable and delicious dinner solo at the bar - a moment that has become a weekly habit. Whether you're enjoying a proper dinner or stepping in for a quick bite/glass of wine at the bar, the service is unwaveringly on the mark, friendly and respectful, even during their busiest moments. It is clear that the staff genuinely wants you to enjoy your experience to the max and will do their best to accommodate you. In regards to the food - Before I had been to PT, I never experienced Italian food in NYC that rivaled that of my Italian grandmother's. The food is exquisite and clearly made with love. I recommend the Salmon Special, Gnocchi Gorgonzola, Steak Special, Lobster Special, Bread Pudding, Chocolate Mousse and Calamari Appetizer, to name a few. If I had the time I'd go on. The wine list is extensive enough but not overwhelming and the selection is well rounded. Staff is knowledgeable about the wine in addition to the food.

"My good friend and I just had a great dinner here tonight. The ambience was perfect... rustic, dimly lit, nice furniture, candles... and they sat us in a little two-person enclave right by a window so we could watch people walk by. The waiter was reaaallly nice and funny. He was so warm and welcoming and kept making us laugh throughout all of our interactions. He let us try one of their wines before we ordered, which we ended up choosing, so he kindly poured the taster into both of our already generously filled glasses.  They first brought us tasty bread / crackers and olive oil with balsamic. Then we split two appetizers: a beet/apple/carrot/gorgonzola/celery salad, which was light and refreshing, and a filet mignon carpaccio with asparagus and parmesan, which melts in your mouth! Excellent stuff.For entrees, we split one of the specials they had tonight: a three mushroom risotto cooked in parmesan and white truffle oil. It was honestly phenomenal. So flavorful, perfectly cooked... also melts in your mouth.We didn't order desserts but he brought us a wonderful red sparkling dessert wine after which was lovely. Spicy and tangy but just the right amount of sweet.We each spent about $40 including tip and it was definitely worth it. Perfect for dates or small groups.At 7:30 the place was pretty calm but by 9 it was hopping.Highly recommended!",5.0

"as far as italian restaurants go, this one doesnt reinvent the wheel. i came here for a friend's birthday with a party of 12. they quickly brought out some delicious breads and olive oil (though curiously no balsamic vinegar - maybe i'm wrong but i thought all italian restaurants serve this by default). our server was quick to take down our drink orders and recommended a decent red wine - it was ok, but as tastes differ, the next one was chosen a bit less arbitrarily. food.... i think the food here was good, but some of my dinner companions felt it was less so. let's begin..the burrata - amazing. if there was one appetizer i could eat nonstop from here it would be this... the cheese was amazingly fresh, and the whole dish smelled of success. barbabietole - a fantastic beet & gorgonzola salad... enough saidrib-eye steak - cooked perfectly medium, with good flavor. hard to mess up at any place worth its salt, but still, this was a fantastic dish. lamb chops - not too gamy, perfectly cooked, and well seasoned. the broccoli rabe was a bit too bitter for my taste, but it acted very well to balance out the fattiness of the lamb.overall, a very good dinner that i would not hesitate to recommend",4.0

"I was really excited to go to PT since it had so many great reviews! My boyfriend was getting back from a work trip late on Saturday which happened to be our anniversary so we wanted a nice place but a place that was also low key and close to home. After reading the menu I was pretty much sold once I saw the asparagus gratin. There was no problem getting a reservation and the place was pretty crowded for late on a Saturday night so I'm glad we made one, but they didn't even ask when we came in - just sat us. It's like whats the point? What if they sat another couple who didn't have a reservation? But really it kind of went with the whole vibe of the place - ""hello we have a table waiting for you, welcome friends!""I got the mixed green salad and we split the asparagus gratin. Salad was delicious, I mean you really can't mess up a basic salad. The asparagus was really really good but when I think of gratin I think of something more casserole like - this dish was literally 5 pieces of asparagus on a plate with cheesy sauce over it. Like I said, it was really good - but also $14 for a handful of asparagus stalks. The boyfriend got the carpaccio, and said it was awesome once he seasoned it a little more.A lack of seasoning is really what brought our meal down. I got the spinach ravioli and he got the pork osso buco and we were both really satisfied but we both thought the meals were bland. I always thought salt and pepper should be to taste, not to season in general. With our meals I definitely felt like there was no thought put into the seasoning which is sad because everything was actually really good. Just bland.The wine list was really extensive and had a wide price range. Went with a carafe (cause I didn't really need to drink a whole bottle myself) of a wine I've never heard of before. I like carafes, I think it's better to take a risk on that rather than a full bottle.Overall, the service was great, the food was good (but totally had potential to be better) and the price was totally reasonable (minus that stupid asparagus gratin). Plus the space is really cute and cozy - I would go back for wine and appetizers at the bar anytime!I would much rather give this a 3.5 and the service is definitely worth a 5 - but I think the lack of seasoning brings it down to a solid 3 stars overall.",3.0

It's an ideal restaurant for a date because of the intimate setting with dim lighting, but it's also great to go with a friend/s. It has authentic Italian food. The waiter made wine recommendation based on our taste and even poured a free round on the house. I would definitely recommend this restaurant for foodies that have high standards for Italian food like myself!",5.0

"I really enjoyed this restaurant. Came here on a date, and it was super intimate and romantic in the garden. The food was awesome and the service was good. I only give it four stars because they ran out of a bunch of entrees and desserts on the menu - they only make a certain amount of each, and when they run out for the night thats it - which was disappointing.",4.0
"Eri runs the floor in this little quaint restaurant on the south side of Williamsburg. The friendliest and most competent waiter I've ever come across. The Thursday night porterhouse special is not happening anymore which was a bummer but I stayed anyway and had the short ribs which was delicious. Super nice Nick, behind the bar, filled my glass with a little more red wine and said 'Eri said to take good care of you.' It's nice to be remembered as I eat there at least once a month and always bring friends along. The garden is beautiful once the warm months kick in. Excellent food, excellent service in a cozy setting.",5.0
"I had two really great experiences here. I was really impressed with the decor, the service and the wine but the food totally blew me away! I am so happy I found this place because it's so close to my house. It's perfect for a friend dinner, a family dinner and even can be a romanic yet casual dinner. The fish I had was fantastic and I can't wait to go back!",5.0
"PT had some the best Italian I've had in New York. I ordered the lasagna (one of the specials of the night) and I literrally could not stop talking about how good it was. Different from other lasagnas, this one didn't use ricotta cheese but instead had a creamy goodness between it's layers. I went for a birthday dinner and our server went above and beyond to accomodate us and our needs. The ambiance was also top notch - perfect for a cold winter night. PT provided a cozy winter/holiday setting. 5 stars all around - food, service, atmosphere. I'm excited to go back.",5.0
"Really loved this place. It's a smaller, dark, candle lit place with a really nice staff. Moderately priced. Calamari was amazing, I was actually pleasantly surprised by how spicy the sauce was. I ordered the Sicilian shells with sausage which was great, but couldn't keep my fork out of my friends special of the day, a whole lobster with linguini, so good! The only thing that could have been better was dessert, Bread pudding was alright, nothing to write home about. Overall I'd return",4.0

"I came here with a big group for someone's birthday, and this restaurant was incredibly accommodating. The group kept getting bigger, and the owners were so willing to pull over another table, and didn't blink at the suggestion. Luckily it was a quieter night there.Our server was amazing. He was sweet and actually Italian. He was completely unafraid to make suggestions, and offered very good pros and cons between dishes. One of my biggest pet peeves is waitstaff that is afraid or unable to help make decisions.I tried the wild boar dish with pasta and chocolate in the sauce. I was very nervous to try ""wild boar,"" afraid it might be too gamey for my tastes. Luckily I gave it a go, after the waiter's assurance that it was their signature dish, very authentic italian, and that the chocolate curbed the strength of the flavor. It was delectible. I got a smaller plate, which was nice when paired with a delicious spinach mushroom and cheese salad. The desserts (we shared a bunch) were all fantastic, and well worth trying.

It's tucked away under the bedford ave stomping ground and the dark decor adds a nice vibe to the already offbeat mood. The food was succulent and delicious.

The service was excellent, and the food was really solid. I had the tagliatele pasta with ham, peas & a light cream sauce, and it was great. The asparagus with cheese side dish was OK, maybe a little boring or out of season, I don't know. Chocolate mouse for dessert was totally solid.Though they had a great wine list, I was super psyched that the beer list was also quite good - Smuttynose IPA is what I had, but they had some german stuff, Smuttynose Robust Porter and others. Good on ya, PT. Hope you get some customers this Thursday night. Totally worth a visit.",4.0
"Absolutely wonderful. This is by far the best nu-Italian restaurant I've ever been to. Porterhouse Thursdays are TOTALLY worth it. The staff is generous, kind, polite, funny, awesome. Complimentary bread and cheese. Great wine selection. Our waiter even gave us a free shot of aguardiente after dinner because we didn't have room for dessert, and we were genuinely upset about it. I had the gnocchi with gorgonzola and it was perfectly creamy, tangy, delicious. They had another special on the menu that sounded great, although I didn't order it since I went for dinner: strawberry risotto. Wtf? So summery and predictably AWESOME. If you want a nice dinner, GO. HERE. I love it.",5.0
"I can't tell you how much I was looking forward to visiting PT during Brooklyn's Restaurant Week. If not for Dine-In Brooklyn and the various reviews, I would have never found this gem.[ Imagine my anxiety then, when my date showed up 20 minutes late. I really have to give the men at PT props for not bothering me about whether the other half of my reservation was on his or her way. They never once pressured me to give my table away when other couples without reservations showed up together ::cough::on time*ahem*whatever.

With its unassuming location on Bedford Avenue, you'd think it was just another spot to be filled with trendy and/or obnoxious hipster folk. Not so. The dim lighting, exposed wood and brick interior make for quite the romantic meal. It was beautiful! Contrary to what other people have mentioned, I didn't find the stools to be cumbersome at all. I felt that, considering the area, PT managed to find a nice balance between vintage and rustic design.If not for the ambiance, I will definitely return for the food. Their menu is fantastic. I started with an organic beet salad and can probably say it was my favorite part of the meal. I love beets and was impressed by the way they showcased them in this nutty little starter... yum!  My main dish was a light fish wrapped in thinly sliced zucchini. Good, but nothing to write home about. The desserts, however, were tantalizing!We are by no means big on wine, but both of us thoroughly enjoyed the glasses suggested to us by our server. They complemented our dishes very well. Their carefully selected wine list was informative in that it detailed the origin and what kind of grape was used, which I liked.I highly recommend this spot for your next date.

"If Yelper reviews are to be believed in the first place, PT has taken a serious slide straight into the toilet.  After a very tasty crostini and a decent appetizer of eggplant layered with sheep's-milk ricotta, I was shocked by how underwhelming everything else was. The bolognese was tasteless and the pasta was a mushy mess. The sad sliver of branzino they served was also overcooked and unpleasant to look at. A paltry  portion, especially for the price, was accompanied by an off-putting duo of supermarket quality cherry tomatoes and black olive slices that were clearly straight from a can. The aggressively average wine list resulted in a white that was inappropriately served just below room temp and a piss-poor red recommendation from the server.

"Great atmosphere, simple decor, very dim lighting and cozy.Delicious branzino, pasta, and special soup.  Only miss was the waiter. We came in for a late dinner (after 9 pm) but he spent most of the night on the sidewalk chatting with another table and having cigarrettes with them.  As they were smoking near the doorway, lots of nasty smells were blowing in.  And since he was smoking too, got to get another whif whenever he graced us with his presence (which was far too rare).  very unprofessional.",3.0

"Having eaten here on a number of occasions, I can honestly say that I have never been even a tad disappointed.  At my last visit with a few friends, we were promptly greeted, seated and offered a drink and wine list.  Our meals were outstanding - salad (not drenched in some awful bottled dressing), delicious bread, gnocchi, an incredible branzino, a super chicken dish.  The wine list has many moderate choices and we were lucky enough to choose a fine wine at a most reasonable price.  I can't wait to go back!",4.0
"I don't often travel out to Williamsburg, but for an old friend I made the exception.  I actually like the neighborhood quite a bit, but I don't think it really likes me much. I'm too corporate, plus I don't have a trust fund.  But anyhow, PT is a cute little Italian restaurant in Williamsburg and if you did live there, I'm sure it would be a good standby.  The pastas were delicious; we had ravioli in tomato sauce and the gnocchi in gorgonzola.  What can I say, we were feeling indulgent.  The gnocchi was not too heavy and the sauce was decadent.  It was a good meal to catch up with old friends. I wouldn't run back, but it was definitely a decent place.",3.0
"Thank you Brooklyn restaurant week! Out of the long list of choices on the enormous list of participating restaurants, my friend and I randomly chose to venture to williamsburg for some Italian at PT.  The food is excellent.  I am usually not a fan of pri fixe menus, but the choices were well thought out and complimentary.  Everything was very fresh, with distinctive flavors. It's a very relaxing, non threatening environment which is a bit unusual in williamsburg, but most certain welcome. Apparently they have patio service once the weather gets warm, which I am very much looking forward to!",5.0
"I like this place a lot -- really great food and wine.  I don't even drink wine, but I drank it at PT, and it was good.  Crowd is hit or miss - sometimes it's super packed, sometimes it's totally empty.  Piece of advice though- get appetizers.  The entree portions aren't huge.  There was also a wine special of 1/2 bottle of something I had never heard of, which was really tasty, but it didn't quite seem like the quantity was correct. Whatever, this place is cool, and the owners are really friendly and accommodating.  I'll definitely go back.Update:  Went here today for brunch - very good.  Again, smallish portions, but whatever.",4.0
"This isn't family style Italian, so don't expect huge plates of spaghetti and meatballs. This is authentic Italian food, with some modern twists. All the pasta is homemade, and you can tell - yum. Everything I ate here was great and reasonably priced ($10-25 for pasta/entrees). The environment has a dark European cafe feel to it. It loses 1 star because the stool-style seating has a cool aesthetic, but gets a little bothersome by the end of your meal.",4.0
"If Yelper reviews are to be believed in the first place, PT has taken a serious slide straight into the toilet.  After a very tasty crostini and a decent appetizer of eggplant layered with sheep's-milk ricotta, I was shocked by how underwhelming everything else was. The bolognese was tasteless and the pasta was a mushy mess. The sad sliver of branzino they served was also overcooked and unpleasant to look at. A paltry  portion, especially for the price, was accompanied by an off-putting duo of supermarket quality cherry tomatoes and black olive slices that were clearly straight from a can. The aggressively average wine list resulted in a white that was inappropriately served just below room temp and a piss-poor red recommendation from the server. Their Dolcetto, while affordable, is not worth any price. The service was very rushed, not rude exactly, but not welcoming either.  Overall this was a huge disappointment. We'll never go back.",1.0

"Wow!  What a great place!  It's my new favorite.  My husband took me here for my birthday last night and it was such a great surprise.  We ordered the Prix Fixe (3 courses).  We were told that you should only do this towards the beginning of the week.  The chef made us three amazing courses and threw in dessert for good measure.  It was really fantastic.  The service was great and the backyard garden is so freaking cute.  We had the whole place to ourselves.  The waiter recommended a great bottle of wine that I had never tried before and that was delish with the dinner.  5 stars, I really recommend this place.",5.0
"Had a really good dinner here. We arrived really late (so I'm sure the kitchen loved us), but our food was very good and service was really nice. You sit at these tables that can seat maybe 6-8 people each. But even with that, it can still seem intimate for two people (I guess as along as you don't care about eavesdroppers).

"We went here a while ago for Brooklyn Restaurant Week and it was fantastic.  We actually live right down the street, and would definitely go back more often if we could afford it.  As some others have noted, it's almost always completely empty, and I'm not even sure how they've stayed open this long.  Even though the food is delicious, the atmosphere is kind of a bummer because you're usually the only one there.  Maybe it's just too expensive for this part of the neighborhood.  But yeah, the food's great.",4.0

"disappointing. after an old roomate declared she had one of the best meals of her life there, i was anticipating a hearty pile of nuanced and delicious italian! what i received was a small portion of gnocchi the consistency of mashed potatoes in a greasy, gooey, bland cheese soup sauce. my friend's pesto sauce suffered a similar affliction. ew. the atmosphere was warm, the service friendly, but for good italian food at these high-for-williamsburg prices i would heartily recommend D.O.C. or even fiore over PT anyday.",2.0

"I've heard nothing but good things about this place so I don't know if this was just an off night for them or what. I went with a friend and we split the cheese plate which was excellent. My friend ordered the roasted pork and I ordered the linguine with seafood. The portions were skimpy and the prices were relatively high. Her dish was ok but mine was absolutely horrible. The white wine sauce the linguine came in was completely flavorless and the pasta was super al dente bordering on uncooked. Not to mention the squid was akin to chewing on a pencil eraser. There was no salt or pepper on the tables which exacerbated the feeling of being culinarily tortured. Additionally, this sinking dish was without a parmesan life raft which made the whole situation really unpleasant. You can tell that this place is owned by the DOC wine bar folks. Same great ambiance but small, crappy portions at high prices. Never setting foot in PT or DOC again. Learned my lesson.",2.0
