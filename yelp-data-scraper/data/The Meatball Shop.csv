"So Tracy from Customer Service reached out to me and asked me to please give them a second chance. My reviews are completely unbiased and i will always give a business a chance to redeem themselves if they ask. Saturday night I did just that after a fun night of hopping around The Meatball Shop was our fifth and final stop. time was around 2:00am and it was still fairly busy. i sat down with two of my friends and this time i was armed with knowledge.Ordered: 1 Stout-like tap beer (don't remember the name but it was delicious) 2. Meatball Hero with classic meatballs, Mozzarella cheese with spicy meat sauce. 3. Tried the Buffalo Chicken Balls 4. Ice Cream Sandwich, Chocolate chip cookies with classic vanillathe food:my god my hero was amazing. absolutely full of flavor. HOT (Balls were at a good temperature) the cheese was melted and the hero bread was charred nicely with a great crunch but also a nice moist texture from the tomato sauce. the buffalo chicken balls were just okay, they don't heat these balls enough, the center was kind of cold so it meant for a mealy, consistency. Ice Cream sandwich and beer: Damn good. No complaints. even after being ridiculously full i managed to finish them both.I am glad I gave this place a second chance and now armed with what you really should order when at TMS I know what I have to get after a long night of bar hopping. I will be back!",4.0
"Restaurant next door was closed so I decided to give this place a try. I walked in with friends at 2 am on a Friday night and this place was EVERYTHING I needed! Great selection of music playing, very energetic and helpful server, and cozy environment. The meatballs were cooked very well; they were tender and well-seasoned! I recommend the chicken meatballs.Have been craving this place ever since my first visit!",5.0
"Stopped in late on a Friday night, sitting at the bar. Enjoyed the hip hop culture and music surrounding us. Â They had Various meatball options, which was nice as I love meatballs. They had a nice mix of cocktail options as well.I had 4 (small-medium sized) beef meatballs w spicy sauce: came out quickly, were nicely flavorful and spiced. Came w bread, which was fine. Burnt orange margarita: nice, well flavored, not too bitterBuzzed Lebowski: White Russian w coffee beans and one giant ice cube: strongly flavored of kahluaDrinks were small, maybe a bit more expensive than they should be, though I don't know the area and what's comparableOverall interesting and worth trying if you like meatballs and character",4.0
"Let me preface by saying the meatballs themselves are amazing. I've had various samplings at other Meatball Shops, and they were THE BEST. In fact, that's why when I walked past here last Sunday, I couldn't resist stopping in and trying them out for brunch. I decided to have the Eggs Florentine with the Breakfast Special Meatball (Sausage). The Egg Florentine was tasty, but the wet spinach, sauce, and egg yolk combined made the meal a little soggy. I had a mimosa that was also delicious but small in size for $10. My boyfriend's order was messed up, but our waiter was really great, and there were no hard feelings there. He even gave us a jello shot for our wait. Many of the other servers were eating Dunkin' Donuts right in front of us. I get that it was 1pm and they might be hungry (believe me, I'm ALWAYS hungry), but perhaps this could've been eaten more discreetly in the back. All-in-all I like this place, and if you just get the meatballs, it's a 4-star rating. Unfortunately, today's meal was just average, and I was expecting more. Seeing as this was my first time eating in the Brooklyn location, I can't verify whether or not this was just an off day or typical for the location; hopefully it was the former.",3.0
"Came through here really late last night, around 1am. Had my heart set on ramen but that spot was closed plus I've passed Meatball shop so many times and never stopped in. I loved the old school decor as soon as I walked in, the tables kinda reminded me of desks in a classroom. I really liked their system as far as how ingredients are classified for you to make your decisions and order. It's really simple. I had chicken balls with classic tomato sauce and provolone on brioche and OMG it changed my life!!!! This was the most memorable meatball sandwich I've ever had. It was so good I will now have to just not walk down Bedford so I'm not led into temptation lol But seriously, I'm so happy I stumbled in here and will definitely return.",5.0
I have been wanting to try this place for a long time. Interesting decor. Friendly staff. Went in around noon on Saturday when they were still serving brunch. I think we made a mistake and ordered brunch items. I got the breakfast sandwich (beef) and my husband ordered the Benedict( pork). They were both mediocre. Nothing out of ordinary. Sandwich came with a side salad. I felt the best part of my lunch was the salad dressing. Maybe we didn't order the right items. We will probably go back and try their lunch menu. I refuse to think this place is not up to our standards.,3.0
"The Meatball Shop gets four stars because the manager was kind enough to change the vulgar music playlist upon request. As a black woman who walked in with a black 15-year old male and his mother, we didn't need to hear the n-word constantly being blared from the speakers, as well as what the rapper would do to a female rear-end. Then to top it off, have a sea of white patrons bobbing their heads to it. It just made for a very uncomfortable setting for me as an African-American and as a woman. Not all black people enjoy the genre of gangsta' rap. With that said. The meatballs with pesto sauce was amazing, as well as the meatballs with parmesan cream! We also had brown sugar ice cream sandwiches, which consisted of a decadent chocolate chip cookie and it was amazingly soft but still had a crunch to it. The other cookie holding it all together was an oatmeal raisin. In all, the food was a dream. However, since the manager stated that type of music is played in all the Meatball Shops I'm giving you a heads up - if your threshold is low for vulgarity you may want to order take out if possible. Other than that, amazing staff since I guess they understood how we felt and gifted us two free appetizers, so thank you Meatball Shop!",4.0
"The Meatball Shop has awesome meatballs. I am sure that comes as a shock to you, given the fact that it is CALLED the meatball shop!! lolTheir meatballs are great, their meatballs should be great!The combinations are traditional, yet inventive, bringing you places you never thought you'd go with a meatball. This brooklyn location is spacious, cool and has a nice vibe to it. I would highly recommend, and personally, I like the classic meatballs with sauce. Can't go wrong.",4.0

"Are you under the age of 30?Do you like eating in lively places?Do you like a loud dinner crowd?Are you a fan of sauces? Do you crave that urban, hipster appeal?I sure do, and if you answered yes to most of the above, head on over to Williamsburg's The Meatball Shop. I really like to come here when I'm in the mood for good hip-hop music, being surrounded by a younger crowd, and eating delicious vegetarian meatballs. No, for reals, vegetarian meatballs are the bomb. They're made primarily from lentils and they're heavenly. I usually get them doused in pesto, which can be oily but oh-so-flavorful. Drinks must be good too because the bar is usually packed. To be honest, I come her more for the ambience and environment than the food. Great for dining before going to a party, will definitely put you in the mood to get ""turnt"", if you will. A must try (at least once).",4.0
"It was my first time visiting this branch of TMS restaurants, I usually go to the Greenwich one. It was more spacious but difficult to see the specials board. Staff were really friendly and helpful with translating a few things on the menu. Our food also came out really fast. I ordered beef meatballs w/spaghetti underneath & the daily special salad. I normally stick with 1 side but the salad just sounded so good with little gem, black beans, cilantro, tomato & lime. It was really good! My fellow diner had spicy pork meatballs w/tomato sauce and cheesy grits. They enjoyed them, but thought the grits were a bit too creamy & rich after eating half the portion.Overall good all round. I have noticed TMS has recently put their prices up, adding $1 per item for meatballs, sides & dessert. So your bill will probably be $5-6 more than it used to be bringing it in line with other similar places and no longer such a bargain price.",4.0
"Probably the best meatballs I've ever had! It was so moist and so full of flavor!Was a spur of the moment decision to grab some Italian food in Williamsburg. There was a short wait, but they take your phone number down and text you when your table is ready. Service was fast. You mark the menu with dry erase pens. There are no pasta dishes, although you can order the pasta as a side dish in addition to your meatball dish. The space is relatively a good size for it's location. There are community tables near the bar area, counter seating, as well as tables if you'd rather done in a more traditional sense. I ordered the spicy pork meatballs with the traditional sauce over a bed of spaghetti. Best decision ever. Also ordered a carafe of their Peach Sangria... OMG it was delicious! So refreshing for a warm summer night. If you are ever craving some Italian. Or just some good ol' spaghetti and meatballs, do come to The Meatball Shop. You'll thank me later. Enjoy!",4.0
"I finally made it to meatball shop!!!! The restaurant is decorated really nice with a modern vintage barn feel if that makes any sense lol. My friend and I came today and got there a little while after the opened, we went to the back and grabbed a table. the menus are set at the tables already and they are menus that you can write on with a dry erase marker and check off what you want to order.Our server came over explained the menu and told us their special ball of the day. The menu isn't huge, but it's definitely hard to choose what you want because everything sounds soo delish. I ended up going with the chicken ball topped with Parmesan sauce and the market salad as a side. My friend got the chicken balls with the mushroom gravy and a side of sautÃ©ed broccoli. We also ordered their special ball to split which was a beef mac & cheese ball. The balls were awesomeeeee, so tasty. They serve them in a bowl with a piece of warm bread uhhhhh so good. The one thing I didn't like is they serve the balls out of small bowls, so it's hard to cut them up. Our server was really nice and the restaurant had a fun atmosphere. They seemed to have a crazy amount of takeout orders, and by the time I was leaving so many more people had already walked in to eat. I'll 1000000% be back for some more balls!",4.0
"I apologize. I exhausted all of my ball entendres at the original location in the LES.* So this time, we're actually just going to have a nice, grown-up, mature conversation about balls.

I know some people are into naked balls, but I'm partial to the spicy pork smash myself; I like a good sandwich, and I can handle having my balls smashed. You should get whatever balls you're into though. Don't let anyone tell you your ball preference is obscene, depraved, or disgusting. You do you.Quite simply, this joint offers a reliably delicious, hearty, affordable late night meal that you can count on.

I made the suggestion to try Meatball Shop because well I've heard great things previously and I've been wanting to check this place out for awhile. I've tried all the different balls on the menu, I usually stick with the veggie or the chicken though. My favorite order has probably been the veggie balls, pesto sauce and the simple salad. It's really good and a total twist on a dish that is usually served with pasta. The chicken balls with the parmesan cheese sauce and the white beans is also a great combo to try. My boyfriend on the other hand gets a pretty standard dish beef balls, classic tomato sauce and mashed potatoes. I haven't been here for brunch yet but that is on my to do list as of now.

"The Meatball Shop provided me with one of the best meals I had in New York!! I ate here on the first night of my vacation and contemplated eating here a second time every single night - it was that good!This restaurant is a build-your-own meatball dish establishment with a few pre-determined menu items for those who are challenged at making their own combinations. After contemplating the thousands of options that I could create, I settled on having a spicy pork meatball over polenta with pesto sauce. Oh my goodness, everything was perfect!!! The meatball was a perfect consistency and was not overloaded with bread crumbs and the polenta was sooooo creamy and delicious. Everything was executed perfectly. Now that I am back in California, I am forced to make my own meatballs and polenta and it sadly doesn't measure up.",5.0
"This place is clearly past its prime and just cashing in on its former good food and experience. Just had dinner at the Bedford Ave location and could not have been more disappointed. Not only was the spicy pork meatball I had barely warm when it hit the table, it barely had any flavor. And the music was so loud we could barely communicate with the server, let alone have a conversation. I used to love this place and have eaten there at least 50 times, but I will think twice before going in again. Definitely not as good as it was before.",2.0
"$12 for three meatballs with sauce and four veggie sides. The platter served reminded me of Westville market sides- which is not a bad thing. I was a bit disappointed with the mushroom sauce; in my mind I may have hoped it was mushroom gravy. I should have went with the spicy tomato sauce. Meatballs are good but I've had better. Not bad to pop in if one is hungry because it is still a solid choice which is exactly what we did. Do not order the carafe size drinks, not worth it!",3.0

"Spent weekend in NYC, and this was the first place me and my buddy stopped. Don't get me wrong... I'm no fool; I GET the place has ""Meatball"" in its name. But dammmmmnnnn, all they have is pretty much meatballs. Meatball sandwich.. Meatballs in a bowl... Meatballs with bread on the side.. Meatball brunches with egg and Hollandaise sauce..Not a French fry to be served.. Not a ""normal"" type of appetizer to be sold... Straight up meatballs (of different varieties) and alcohol. We went with the ""Fool Aid"" , this is basically adult grape flavored kool-aid. Definitely not bad, but pricey for what is was. After our quart of drink we became a wee bit hungry. So we ordered two meatballs each. He got the spicy pork meatballs with marinara and I got two classis meatballs with marinara. This is where I got disappointed.. I mean the extremely limited menu hurt me a little... But when all you sell is meatballs, I expect that meatball to make me beg for more... OooolalaI didn't get that feeling. We traded one meatball for another so we each had one of the two flavors... At best these meatballs where half decent drunk good. But I've had better sauce from a jar, and the meatballs honestly were disappointing. They tasted no different to me than ones I buy frozen at bj's for a pasta dinner. Overall OK drinks. Very limited menu. Yet pricey. So if all that adds up to a good night out for you then go for it.... Otherwise I'd save this place for your last drunk stop so you can have one last drink and a meatball",2.0
"Pretty darn good, though I didn't feel that the tomato-based sauce was tangy enough to offset the meatiness. Also, I would prefer more bite-sized meatballs instead of the giant mounds they serve you. I would also order some veggies on the side to balance out the meal...you get kind of tired of just eating meat by itself.",3.0
"Jam packed location with same delicious menu of succulent, simple, and over-priced food. But it just tastes so so good. You will not leave disappointed. Be sure to save room for a dessert. The ice cream is delicious, and the cookies are fresh baked.There's something about being here that makes everyone so chatty. The restaurant is bigger than the LES location, but the seats are just as crowded. So you might find yourself chatting with your neighbors or making conversation when you're waiting to use the restrooms. There is definitely a share of partiers here, too, as it's close to some of the bigger clubs. (It helps that the menu is relatively simple!) There's such a buzz.

As far as the balls go, big fan of the spicy pork.The other sides that we got - namely the cauliflower - that was a bit lackluster, hence the 4 stars instead of a resounding 5. Still, vis-a-vis the meatballs, it's an amazing execution on what is a tried and true, amazing concept",4.0
"Went here with friends after a night out at the bar. One word: AMAZINGLYDELICIOUSNESS! Â We sat at the bar and it was quick, friendly service. You choose the type of meatball, with your choice of pasta (or rice I think? Can't recall), and you choose a sauce. I got the spicy pork meatball with rigatoni and Parmesan cream sauce and it was just out of this world great. I could've licked the bowl. Great for a date night or out with friends, for the munchies, or after a night out drinking! 5 stars baby",5.0

"Spent weekend in NYC, and this was the first place me and my buddy stopped. Don't get me wrong... I'm no fool; I GET the place has ""Meatball"" in its name. But dammmmmnnnn, all they have is pretty much meatballs. Meatball sandwich.. Meatballs in a bowl... Meatballs with bread on the side.. Meatball brunches with egg and Hollandaise sauce..Not a French fry to be served.. Not a ""normal"" type of appetizer to be sold... Straight up meatballs (of different varieties) and alcohol. We went with the ""Fool Aid"" , this is basically adult grape flavored kool-aid. Definitely not bad, but pricey for what is was. After our quart of drink we became a wee bit hungry. So we ordered two meatballs each. He got the spicy pork meatballs with marinara and I got two classis meatballs with marinara. This is where I got disappointed.. I mean the extremely limited menu hurt me a little... But when all you sell is meatballs, I expect that meatball to make me beg for more... OooolalaI didn't get that feeling. We traded one meatball for another so we each had one of the two flavors... At best these meatballs where half decent drunk good. But I've had better sauce from a jar, and the meatballs honestly were disappointing. They tasted no different to me than ones I buy frozen at bj's for a pasta dinner. Overall OK drinks. Very limited menu. Yet pricey. So if all that adds up to a good night out for you then go for it.... Otherwise I'd save this place for your last drunk stop so you can have one last drink and a meatball",2.0
"Pretty darn good, though I didn't feel that the tomato-based sauce was tangy enough to offset the meatiness. Also, I would prefer more bite-sized meatballs instead of the giant mounds they serve you. I would also order some veggies on the side to balance out the meal...you get kind of tired of just eating meat by itself.",3.0
"Jam packed location with same delicious menu of succulent, simple, and over-priced food. But it just tastes so so good. You will not leave disappointed. Be sure to save room for a dessert. The ice cream is delicious, and the cookies are fresh baked.There's something about being here that makes everyone so chatty. The restaurant is bigger than the LES location, but the seats are just as crowded. So you might find yourself chatting with your neighbors or making conversation when you're waiting to use the restrooms. There is definitely a share of partiers here, too, as it's close to some of the bigger clubs. (It helps that the menu is relatively simple!) There's such a buzz. This spot is great for people watching - and eating!",4.0
"I love me a fat, juicy ball. What better place then to get them at The Meatball Shop?The concept is simple, really. Step 1: Choose your ball - Classic beef, spicy pork, chicken, veggie or special.Step 2: Choose your sauce - Classic tomato, spicy meat sauce, mushroom gravy, parmesan cream, pesto or special.Step 3: Step 3 is totally optional but you can pick a side, to be put under your balls or to the side of them.One order will get you 4 balls, served with Focaccia bread and Parmesan cheese. At $2 a pop, I was expecting some extraordinarily delectable balls.Classic Beef w/ Spicy Tomato Sauce -- Spicy balls, just how I like 'em. The meatballs were generously humongous. I was completely stuffed after eating 1.5 of them. The bread was a perfect pairing as I used it to scoop up all the leftover spicy tomato sauce.

I got the beef meatballs with spicy sauce and the meatballs were good, but I'd expect more being that this is the top draw here and their price. $8 for the meatballs and piece of bread.

"I really wanted to like this place. But certain things aren't meant to be. Came in on Wednesday night. Decent crowd not too busy. Great music mix of r&b, pop and indie. We were seated immediately. Our table was too small so we opted to sit at the bar area facing the kitchen. Big MISTAKE! Server came over immediately to tell us about the special ball of the night (Mac & cheese balls with cheese sauce). He then said he would be back to take our orders. He took longer than expected to come back and take our orders. He asked us if we wanted something to drink we told him to come back while we looked at the menu. Meanwhile he didn't give us any water. We ordered the buffalo chicken balls, I got the beef balls with the spicy meat sauce Â my friend got the special balls with spaghetti. We received the buffalo chicken balls super fast. I mean so fast I questioned were they correct. The flavor was decent. Would've better if the would've coated them and if they were hot. The temperature was warm at best. I mean literally the balls were room temperature. That's why we got them so fast they forgot to heat them up. Â Soon after the entrees came out. The server still hadn't returned to get our drink orders so we finally asked the runner who brought the food for water. The beef balls in the spicy sauce were okay. For a place to be named the meatball shop I expected better. I felt like I could've made the same meatballs in my kitchen. The mac & cheese balls were good and unique. I couldn't see myself eating more than 1. But they did taste like Mac & cheese and contained pasta which was very clever. The spaghetti was plain and only covering was the cheese sauce that was with the balls. Blah. Half way into our entrees the server came and asked for our drink orders we just got 2 Jell-O shots I was very annoyed. Jell-O shots were good. Should do other flavors. If the mediocre food wasn't bad enough the service and staff made it worse. Work should be fun. But when you have guest sitting at the kitchen area and can see and hear everything that's going on, staff should know how to conduct themselves. First the conversations the kitchen staff were having were ridiculous full of profane, derogatory, obscene, explicit language. I won't write what I heard but it shouldn't be repeated or ever be said in a professional environment. Second were the health code violations I witnessed. Â 1 girl had her long gray weave hanging down her back in a ponytail. The scarf she wore did nothing for all the hair hanging out with no hair net. Â Next was a guy with his hair hanging out of his baseball cap with no hair net on. Â Neither should've be been in the kitchen let alone preparing food. Then at one point a guy was sitting on the pick up area for food. At another point a guy was swatting some type of bug with his apron. They were stopping in the middle of making dishes to talk. Not changing gloves frequently enough. The list goes on. The were all just loud rambunctious talking across the restaurant. Totally unacceptable, unprofessional behavior. The server was just slow, clueless and barely checked in. There's a fine line between relaxed, cool hipster vibe and lazy, lack of care unprofessional atmosphere and this place was definitely the latter. I don't ever see myself returning.",1.0
I went here with my family and friend. Overall it was a good experience. We went right when it opened so there were no lines but I could see how it would get loud since the music was quite loud. Overall the food was good. I ordered 4 meatball sliders- all different types of balls and sauces so I could taste and see. I wish they allowed you to have different types of balls in the heros and other dishes so you could taste it. It is a tad on the expensive side. It's $6 for a side which I think is a little bit expensive.,3.0
"The meatballs are amazing!!! This place is great. Meatballs are my fav and this place satisfies the craving. It is busy so you will have to wait, but they have a system in place where they text you when your table is ready. My favorite sauce is pesto. So I pair my pasta with pesto and the meatballs. Omg is this delish. And the drinks aren't to far behind. The drinks are great and of course strong. I've tried the Hemmingway. It was a great compliment to the food. A great experience. Definitely go for the meatballs and the drinks.",4.0
"Couldn't fill ourselves up at the YEE (Fushimi) last night, so we had to find dinner on our own. Ended up seeing TMS right by the L train, so why not? Pretty busy for a late Monday evening, plus this place is much more spacious than the location on the LES. Adeline L. and I were pretty much hungry, but surprised we both couldn't finish either of our meal? The balls are just as good as I remember having them at their other locations. I had the Spicy Pork in Mushroom Gravy. Tasty, tender balls of pig with a kick, which would have been better if only had I chose them to go with their Classic Tomato Sauce. The gravy was good, don't get me wrong. The pesto from Addy's dish was outstanding, wish I could have gotten that, too. Haha, can't always have everything. Sides were on our table as well, Daily Risotto was a creamy spinach risotto topped with parmesan cheese, tasty, but so heavy! I didn't enjoy the Horseradish Turnips as much as by buddy did, the root itself was way too pungent for me. We also shared an ice cream sandwich, so satisfying that we hoped that it would never be the end. The Blueberry Cheesecake tastes exactly like blueberry cheesecake. The Snickerdoodle cookie was sweet, soft, yet chewy.The place felt pretty chill, and I love the rustic chairs. They look exactly like the ones my mom use to sit in, she use to bring me with her to work when I was little, at those Chinese sewing factories. Our meal wouldn't have been so smooth and relaxed if it wasn't because of the friendly pretty lady in a cute red dress attending us for the evening, thank you.",4.0

"I mean who doesn't like balls, really? They're round, meaty, and just fun to eat. Easy fellas, I'm talking about MEATBALLS.Being in Williamsburg, it's no surprise you'll find yourself in the company of hipsters in this bar-like establishment. The vibe is fun and full of energy even at 4PM on a Sunday. Well, it is the weekend after all. We sat straight at the bar and our casual yet cordial bartender greeted us instantly with their drink and food menus. He asked if we were first timers but nope, we've already been to other TMS locations and knew the drill. Order from their laminated menu with a dry erase marker by checking what you want.Each ""Naked Balls"" order consists of 4 balls with parmesan cheese and focaccia bread. 1st: Pick your type of meat---Classic Beef, Spicy Pork, Chicken, Vegetarian, or Special. Unfortunately you cannot mix and match your meats.2nd: Choose your sauce---Classic Tomato, Spicy Meat Sauce, Mushroom Gravy, Parmesan Cream, Pesto, Special3rd: Add family jewels---Fried egg if you will, for an extra $1. Or not.I'll stop there but mind you, their menu still has so much to offer. Sides of starches and greens with an option of having it under or on the side, as well as a selection of sandwiches that you can customize to your liking. Here's what I tried from the Naked Balls section:Classic beef + Mushroom Gravy + Fried Jewel = Perfection! It reminds me of eating a Salisbury steak, only better. The egg adds a richness to this bowl that you can do with or without. I for one am already happy with just the robust and earthy flavor from the mushroom gravy sauce. Classic beef + Parmesan Cream = Amazing! Probably my favorite combo. The sauce is lusciously creamy and oh so delicious. I almost licked my bowl clean. Spicy Pork + Special = Very ballsy! Probably in tribute to Oktoberfest, the sauce itself was made out of beer and mustard. Atleast that's all I remember from everything the bartender said. The spicy pork itself was packed with flavor and just the right heat, while the sauce complemented the balls so well with all its savory goodness--spicy, sour, tarty, and sweet. Mhhmmm..The Meatball Shop...surely the name speaks for itself.",4.0

The bartender who's name is Oj is super attentive. She gives such awesome service. I order the same thing every time which she remembers as soon as I sit down. I'm veggie so I always have the veggie balls. They are the shizzle. Service here is super fast. You can be in and out in less that half an hour.",5.0

The spaghetti was plain and only covering was the cheese sauce that was with the balls. Blah. Half way into our entrees the server came and asked for our drink orders we just got 2 Jell-O shots I was very annoyed. Jell-O shots were good. Should do other flavors. If the mediocre food wasn't bad enough the service and staff made it worse. Work should be fun. But when you have guest sitting at the kitchen area and can see and hear everything that's going on, staff should know how to conduct themselves. First the conversations the kitchen staff were having were ridiculous full of profane, derogatory, obscene, explicit language. I won't write what I heard but it shouldn't be repeated or ever be said in a professional environment. Second were the health code violations I witnessed. Â 1 girl had her long gray weave hanging down her back in a ponytail. The scarf she wore did nothing for all the hair hanging out with no hair net. Â Next was a guy with his hair hanging out of his baseball cap with no hair net on. Â Neither should've be been in the kitchen let alone preparing food. Then at one point a guy was sitting on the pick up area for food. At another point a guy was swatting some type of bug with his apron. They were stopping in the middle of making dishes to talk. Not changing gloves frequently enough. The list goes on. The were all just loud rambunctious talking across the restaurant. Totally unacceptable, unprofessional behavior. The server was just slow, clueless and barely checked in. There's a fine line between relaxed, cool hipster vibe and lazy, lack of care unprofessional atmosphere and this place was definitely the latter. I don't ever see myself returning.",1.0
I went here with my family and friend. Overall it was a good experience. We went right when it opened so there were no lines but I could see how it would get loud since the music was quite loud. Overall the food was good. I ordered 4 meatball sliders- all different types of balls and sauces so I could taste and see. I wish they allowed you to have different types of balls in the heros and other dishes so you could taste it. It is a tad on the expensive side. It's $6 for a side which I think is a little bit expensive.,3.0
"The meatballs are amazing!!! This place is great. Meatballs are my fav and this place satisfies the craving. It is busy so you will have to wait, but they have a system in place where they text you when your table is ready. My favorite sauce is pesto. So I pair my pasta with pesto and the meatballs. Omg is this delish. And the drinks aren't to far behind. The drinks are great and of course strong. I've tried the Hemmingway. It was a great compliment to the food. A great experience. Definitely go for the meatballs and the drinks.",4.0
"Couldn't fill ourselves up at the YEE (Fushimi) last night, so we had to find dinner on our own. Ended up seeing TMS right by the L train, so why not? Pretty busy for a late Monday evening, plus this place is much more spacious than the location on the LES. Adeline L. and I were pretty much hungry, but surprised we both couldn't finish either of our meal? The balls are just as good as I remember having them at their other locations. I had the Spicy Pork in Mushroom Gravy. Tasty, tender balls of pig with a kick, which would have been better if only had I chose them to go with their Classic Tomato Sauce. The gravy was good, don't get me wrong. The pesto from Addy's dish was outstanding, wish I could have gotten that, too. Haha, can't always have everything. Sides were on our table as well, Daily Risotto was a creamy spinach risotto topped with parmesan cheese, tasty, but so heavy! I didn't enjoy the Horseradish Turnips as much as by buddy did, the root itself was way too pungent for me. We also shared an ice cream sandwich, so satisfying that we hoped that it would never be the end. The Blueberry Cheesecake tastes exactly like blueberry cheesecake. The Snickerdoodle cookie was sweet, soft, yet chewy.The place felt pretty chill, and I love the rustic chairs. They look exactly like the ones my mom use to sit in, she use to bring me with her to work when I was little, at those Chinese sewing factories. Our meal wouldn't have been so smooth and relaxed if it wasn't because of the friendly pretty lady in a cute red dress attending us for the evening, thank you.",4.0
"*** Extremely delicious, Friendly staff, Filling food options *** SO GOOD! They have a location in the city too that I've been to. The servings are always very filling, food is decently priced, and the ambiance is casual, comfortable. I just wish there were more meatballs and more sauce options.",3.0
"Sit at the bar if you can, and get the white beans. Really good (not dry at all) meatballs with options for every sort of diet. Also they were playing a Ja Rule centric playlist which really spoke to my soul.",5.0
"I mean who doesn't like balls, really? They're round, meaty, and just fun to eat. Easy fellas, I'm talking about MEATBALLS.Being in Williamsburg, it's no surprise you'll find yourself in the company of hipsters in this bar-like establishment. The vibe is fun and full of energy even at 4PM on a Sunday. Well, it is the weekend after all. We sat straight at the bar and our casual yet cordial bartender greeted us instantly with their drink and food menus. He asked if we were first timers but nope, we've already been to other TMS locations and knew the drill. Order from their laminated menu with a dry erase marker by checking what you want.Each ""Naked Balls"" order consists of 4 balls with parmesan cheese and focaccia bread. 1st: Pick your type of meat---Classic Beef, Spicy Pork, Chicken, Vegetarian, or Special. Unfortunately you cannot mix and match your meats.2nd: Choose your sauce---Classic Tomato, Spicy Meat Sauce, Mushroom Gravy, Parmesan Cream, Pesto, Special3rd: Add family jewels---Fried egg if you will, for an extra $1. Or not.I'll stop there but mind you, their menu still has so much to offer. Sides of starches and greens with an option of having it under or on the side, as well as a selection of sandwiches that you can customize to your liking. Here's what I tried from the Naked Balls section:Classic beef + Mushroom Gravy + Fried Jewel = Perfection! It reminds me of eating a Salisbury steak, only better. The egg adds a richness to this bowl that you can do with or without. I for one am already happy with just the robust and earthy flavor from the mushroom gravy sauce. Classic beef + Parmesan Cream = Amazing! Probably my favorite combo. The sauce is lusciously creamy and oh so delicious. I almost licked my bowl clean. Spicy Pork + Special = Very ballsy! Probably in tribute to Oktoberfest, the sauce itself was made out of beer and mustard. Atleast that's all I remember from everything the bartender said. The spicy pork itself was packed with flavor and just the right heat, while the sauce complemented the balls so well with all its savory goodness--spicy, sour, tarty, and sweet. Mhhmmm..The Meatball Shop...surely the name speaks for itself.",4.0
"This place is awesome. If you don't like loud atmospheres then don't eat here as the music is normally pumping. I have noticed a few 'oldies' whinging about it but lets get real here... When you walk in, you pretty much get the gist. Why would you order food then moan about it!!!I often am in a rush and sit at the bar on my own during the daytime. The bartender who's name is Oj is super attentive. She gives such awesome service. I order the same thing every time which she remembers as soon as I sit down. I'm veggie so I always have the veggie balls. They are the shizzle. Service here is super fast. You can be in and out in less that half an hour.",5.0
"Dope concept, good food, good drinks, I like it.They got all kinds of balls and sauces. I got the Original Beef Balls and Spicy Pork Balls, both were on point, full of flavor and decent quality meat. Â Full bar with many cocktails, I got the Moscow Mule and it was made to perfection.",4.0

"They must have just deep-cleaned the whole restaurant, because this place smelled real funky upon arrival, to the point where I almost walked out, but alas...ice cream sandwiches...Skipped their ""#NationalBurgerDay version of meat on a bun: THE MEATBALL SMASH!"" and went with the Williamsburg special ice cream (strawberry) between their special cookies (peanut pretzel), an order that confused the hell out of the cashier (as did using a gift card toward the transaction)*. The ice cream was sadly a bit overfrozen and had crystallized, and the peanut pretzel cookie was very lackluster, but ice cream sandwiches are inherently satisfying.*Also, presumable trainee, no need to label the Pean Pretz when you're the lone employee, and it was the lone item, and I was the lone customer, but hey, way to delay the takeout process.",3.0
"The meatballs here are pretty good, which is the whole point of coming here I suppose.The mashed potatoes are a must.

I saw someone order a quinoa plate and I wondered how to order it since I didn't see it on the menu.

"Wanted to check this place out for the longest and finally got a chance to this time around. Took us almost 2 hours to find this place by train and foot.

They stay open til 2AM so this is a go to stop for late night eats for sure. I ordered the kitchen sink w/ a fried egg. 3 original beef meatballs with mushroom gravy over a salad and side of potatoe salad w/ a fried egg on top. I didn't finish my plate, I didn't like it at all. I should've gotten the spicy pork meatballs. My sis ordered it and I was able to taste hers. It was pretty damn good. My friend who went for the special meatball and special sauce was very disappointed. Basically it was cover with BEANS!!! Â Not so good! One of the other friend ordered Risotto which was quite tasty.

And I had the special lemonade, which was rhubarb - bit on the sweet side, but tasty nonetheless. Our waitress was super sweet and genuine and overall we were pleased with our experience!

It was a little lettuce with pickled carrots, pickled fennel, apple, pickled cucumber, etc. It was good, but all the vinegar mixing with the sauce wasn't the best combo and the bottom of the salad was really soggy by the time I got to it. Luckily, I'm fine with pickled things, but I wish something had indicated what was in it before I ordered, as I would have preferred a traditional salad. I guess I could have asked what was in the ""chef's selection"" of choices, but my last guess would have been a plate of pickled veggies.Guess I'll just have to come back and try some different combos then!",3.0

"LOVE THIS PLACE! I'm a vegetarian so it's great to be able to experience a ""meatball"" once in a while!! I ordered the veggie meatball hero with mushrooms & a creamy sauce (forgot what it was called) on a whole wheat roll and it was DELICIOUS!!! Â My boyfriend got meatball parm on a roll and loved his too. I would definitely recommend this place to ANYONE! Â Atmosphere is chill & laid back, wooden walls & candle mason jars everywhere.

"This was like, the 2nd best time I've had putting balls in my mouth (and that's saying a lot!).No but seriously folks...holy shitsnacks is this place legit! Literally every single thing we ordered was perfect. I was with 2 friends, so the 3 of us each ordered different balls in different sauces (hey-o!) and 3 different sides, and I could not have been more pleased with our ball choices.(I am having more fun writing this review than I ever have before)We closed out our experience by building our own ice cream sammiches. The brown sugar ice cream is frickin' the business!The website says they deliver, which must be cool, if you live in Brooklyn. I am, alas, in Milwaukee, and unless they add drone delivery so I can FINALLY get teabagged by a robot, I guess I'll have to wait to get more (meat)balls in my mouth!(please don't tag this as inappropriate) (or you do you, whatever, i can't stop you)",5.0
"Biggest icecream sandwiches ever.By big I mean HUGE and oh so perfect.I tried the chocolate cookie sandwich with mint icecream and my person got the snickerdoodle cookie with brown sugar icecream. In my opinion, mine was better because the mint icecream was just so good and tasted like fresh mint and cream. Yum! He also loved his but the brown sugar icecream was very very sweet. A little too sweet for me but perfect for others.I love how you can customize your sandwich however you like by picking from a variety of about 6 cookies and many types of delicious icecream flavors. Their menus are plastic like mini white boards, you check off what you would like from the menu with erasable markers. So fun and really cute for a date.This was a spontaneous sweet tooth craving adventure but next time we'll have to try the much raved about meatballs. They looked great on everyone else's plates.

Great recommendations and the Daily Menu is a must try because it only appears daily LOL  Â  Â  So I visited this Meatball twice in a week. First time was a sit in and the second time was a takeout.

The second time I ordered take out, which I had the Daily Naked Balls, Steak bacon cheddar with Parmesan Sauce. The daily balls was one of the best meatball I had ever tried. It was a great taste of meaty beef. I also had the Naked Balls of Spicy Pork with rigatoni under and the sauce was Parmesan sauce. It tasted amazing, the spicy pork wasn't too spicy but the combine of rigatoni and balls in a Parmesan sauce is great! (You can tell that I always ordered the naked balls with Parmesan sauce because that sauce is so creamy and velvety). The side was the Daily Risotto Corn, leek, and chives. It tasted creamy and delicious flavor of corn with leek. I ordered a Daily special Drink which was a lemonade plum. The drink was bubbly with fizz and the tasted sweet with a hint of sour from the lemonade. It was a the best lemonade soda type.

I ordered the meatball sliders so I could get a sample of their different flavors: beef with spicy meat sauce, pork with parmesan cream sauce, and chicken with pesto sauce. The spicy meat sauce was OK it was nothing special, and the beef meatballs were a little bland. The pork was probably the best meatball but the parmesan cream sauce was a little cold and not very flavorful.. just salty. The chicken meatball too was alright, however, I did very much enjoy the pesto sauce (you can never really go wrong with pesto). On top of that, the bread lacked any sort of flavor. It was very plain. I also sampled the spaghetti side dish, again bland and nothing spectacular about the flavor.There are plenty of tables as well as bar seating, great ambience and music too.Perhaps it was the fact that we ate here at 2AM, but still I was expecting better quality.

Good restaurant concept and it's obviously very popular but it didn't blow me away. It also takes a while to get your food.

"One of my favorite stops in Brooklyn is the Meatball Shop.I love the ambience here, it's a bar type atmosphere along with great service and of course delicious meatballs. When you place your order, you're given a laminated menu with a dry erase marker and then check marking your preferences. You choose 1 kind of Ball + Sauce choice. There is five ball choices to choose from: Classic Beef, Spicy Pork, Chicken, Veggie and Special. The Sauce flavors they offer were: Classic Tomato, Spicy Meat Sauce, Mushroom Gravy, Parmesan Cream, Pesto and Special.We went with Spicy Pork with Spicy Meat Sauce. This combination was very tasty. The Spicy Pork Meat was tender and it had that seasoned peppered touch to it. Â The Spicy Meat Sauce had a rich tomato flavor and it complimented the meatballs and mozzarella cheese well. Overall it was tasted like a pizza. The bread stick that came with it, had me dipping into the meat sauce to the last scrape. Our other custom meatball choice was with Classic Beef with Mushroom Gravy and topped with Family Jewels = fried eggs. This one tasted simple, but the added mushroom gravy and fried eggs turned out to be as hearty like a breakfast meal all in one bowl. I had to go with a cocktail drink while enjoying what was to me an awesome stop over snack for the day. So I went with the Hot Buttered Rum. Its warm, sweet, it was an absolute delight to have with the meatballs and the atmosphere.The stuff here is pricey but well worth it, if you're ballin'!",5.0
"This place is a bomb spot. The service was great the moment we walked up to the hosts. They greeted us and tried to get us he first seats available and were in communication with us the whole wait.

I have never been to a place that plays 2pac, eminem, and Jay-z. The food is really fun and just as delicious. You can customize your order in every way from the meat to the sauce to your sides (we did this for dessert too; the brown sugar and chocolate chip cookie ice cream sandwich hit the spot). In general, let's just say I can't wait to go back.",5.0
I've been here a few times and I could surely say that they have pretty good meatballs. They usually have pretty good market salads to go along with your meal and for dessert the ice cream sandwich is a must! The restaurant has very cool hipster decoration and is in a great spot.

"Seeing as this is my 10th visit I decided it was time to do a review. As far as popular expanding restaurants go, this place is still very much true to its roots. You get an awesome meatball with some tasty sides. They do this very well and I hope they open up some more locations in the NY area (Long Island and Queens please). There really isn't anything bad to say. Just some tips. It gets very busy so for dinner hour on the weekend be prepared to wait. The BK spot is bigger than the Manhattan one but there is still an hour wait after 9pm. Call ahead but I do not think they take reservations. Try everything at least once. They always have special menu items so try them. They may not make it back on the menu for a while if ever. Price is not too damaging to your wallet and I would say its a much cheaper meal then some of the casual and fancy fare in the area. The staff is really really nice and I have never had a problem with service. Meatball shop is one of the best and they deserve all the kudos.",5.0
"The place was cute, nice little hangout.Tables are cramped.Food is pricy, portions are small. And on top of that, it's pretty bland.$20 dollars for four tiny meat balls and a little pasta and sauce that literally to me resembled a microwave TV dinner, also, not to mention in that $20 was a $3 Coke that was barely half a can.

When you place your order, you're given a laminated menu with a dry erase marker and then check marking your preferences. You choose 1 kind of Ball + Sauce choice. There is five ball choices to choose from: Classic Beef, Spicy Pork, Chicken, Veggie and Special. The Sauce flavors they offer were: Classic Tomato, Spicy Meat Sauce, Mushroom Gravy, Parmesan Cream, Pesto and Special.We went with Spicy Pork with Spicy Meat Sauce. This combination was very tasty. The Spicy Pork Meat was tender and it had that seasoned peppered touch to it. Â The Spicy Meat Sauce had a rich tomato flavor and it complimented the meatballs and mozzarella cheese well. Overall it was tasted like a pizza. The bread stick that came with it, had me dipping into the meat sauce to the last scrape. Our other custom meatball choice was with Classic Beef with Mushroom Gravy and topped with Family Jewels = fried eggs. This one tasted simple, but the added mushroom gravy and fried eggs turned out to be as hearty like a breakfast meal all in one bowl. I had to go with a cocktail drink while enjoying what was to me an awesome stop over snack for the day. So I went with the Hot Buttered Rum. Its warm, sweet, it was an absolute delight to have with the meatballs and the atmosphere.The stuff here is pricey but well worth it, if you're ballin'!",5.0
"This place is a bomb spot. The service was great the moment we walked up to the hosts. They greeted us and tried to get us he first seats available and were in communication with us the whole wait. Our wait wasn't bad (5 min), but I could see how it could easily be 15-20 min at a busy time. The music was on point, for my taste at least. I have never been to a place that plays 2pac, eminem, and Jay-z. The food is really fun and just as delicious. You can customize your order in every way from the meat to the sauce to your sides (we did this for dessert too; the brown sugar and chocolate chip cookie ice cream sandwich hit the spot). In general, let's just say I can't wait to go back.",5.0
I've been here a few times and I could surely say that they have pretty good meatballs. They usually have pretty good market salads to go along with your meal and for dessert the ice cream sandwich is a must! The restaurant has very cool hipster decoration and is in a great spot. Their sangria is also perfectly on point and so is the Jell-O shots !!!,5.0
"I've never been disappointed by this place, no matter what time I go! It's always a friendly atmosphere with good simple food. Shout out to the market plate, it's always a safe bet!",5.0
"Seeing as this is my 10th visit I decided it was time to do a review. As far as popular expanding restaurants go, this place is still very much true to its roots. You get an awesome meatball with some tasty sides. They do this very well and I hope they open up some more locations in the NY area (Long Island and Queens please). There really isn't anything bad to say. Just some tips. It gets very busy so for dinner hour on the weekend be prepared to wait. The BK spot is bigger than the Manhattan one but there is still an hour wait after 9pm. Call ahead but I do not think they take reservations. Try everything at least once. They always have special menu items so try them. They may not make it back on the menu for a while if ever. Price is not too damaging to your wallet and I would say its a much cheaper meal then some of the casual and fancy fare in the area. The staff is really really nice and I have never had a problem with service. Meatball shop is one of the best and they deserve all the kudos.",5.0
"The place was cute, nice little hangout.Tables are cramped.Food is pricy, portions are small. And on top of that, it's pretty bland.$20 dollars for four tiny meat balls and a little pasta and sauce that literally to me resembled a microwave TV dinner, also, not to mention in that $20 was a $3 Coke that was barely half a can. Safe to say I won't be going there again.",1.0

"Good price, good good. Â The broccoli cheddar risotto was delicious, the spicy pork meatballs were very good seasoned.

Â The Cantaloupe Lemonade was tasty and refreshing. Â Id definitely go back.",4.0
"Fast service on a Thursday night! Their restaurant service is very friendly and efficient. I had their special lemonade of the night...cantaloupe lemonade! (I got a refill, it was so good)I got meatball sliders (spicy pork with classic tomato sauce, and chicken with mushroom gravy) Delicious! My favorite was the chicken with mushroom gravy. The sliders were $3 each and were pretty small. (Think one meatball on a tiny tiny bun.) It's a cheap eat if you're not very hungry. I HIGHLY recommend the chocolate chip cookie ice cream sandwich with BROWN SUGAR ICE CREAM!!! HUGE scoop of cold ice cream, not melted and not frozen solid, and 2 big, fresh chocolate chip cookies. Priced at $6, that might have been the best ice cream sandwich I have ever had. (And I've had a lot of ice cream... it's an obsession.) I'll be back... :)",5.0

"My friend was excited about exploring Williamsburg, but we were hungry and used Yelp to find a highly rate place that has a bit of the ""hipster"" vibe she was looking for. Definitely a cute little place and great ambient lighting as well as a skylight. Love the decor! Food was pretty good. A bit expensive for the portions, especially the sides. Overall good experience.",4.0
"I adore this place. The food is to die for! From the various meatballs to diversity of sauce choices to the ice cream cookie sandwiches, I always satisfied after a visit. My favorite meal is the ""everything and the kitchen sink"" which is a salad topped with meatballs and mixed vegetables. It's awesome!!! The ice cream cookie sandwiches are awesome especially since you can mix and match cookie flavors. You must go here if you haven't been. The wait can be long on Friday or Saturday nights but if you can wait, you won't be disappointed. I highly recommend the Brooklyn location. They play old school hip hop and has a cooler vibe than the Manhattan locations in my opinion.",5.0

"Rustic, antique setting to hit up some awesome meatballs both in the classical sense and along with some pretty cool ideas. I had the regular, spicy beef, spicy pork and chicken. For sauces, I had spicy meat and the pesto. I had a side of broccoli which was seasoned perfectly to compliment my meatball overload. But the best dish I had was their appetizer special - mini buffalo balls. It is by far the best balls of chicken I've ever had in my life. The price was on point for this joint. Very lively with friendly service. Al Capone is not rolling around in his grave.",4.0
"I've been going to this Meatball Shop regularly since they opened. The food is solid but what really keeps me going is their excellent service. Â Sometimes a new person will be a bit slow, but every single person I've encountered - every cashier, cook, host, and bartender - has been beyond friendly. Â The menu is deceptively simple. Â A lot of thought goes into each of their dishes, especially their market salad, daily veg, and risotto specials, which take advantage of seasonal ingredients. Â Their kitchen sink salad also changes with the seasons, and I usually get it with the special balls and sauce. Â Which ball do I prefer? Â I love all of their balls and all of their sauces, so it really depends on what kind of mood you're in. Â But I don't think you can find a juicier chicken meatball anywhere. Â The sides are delicious too - the pasta is always perfectly al dente and they are very generous with the aged parmesan cheese, which I cannot say of every other Italian restaurant Â I've ever been to. Â My family loves the hero and brioche sandwiches and they come with a generous salad, which I am grateful for, so that nobody tries to eat any of my salad.I usually get my order to go but the dining room is casual, fun, and high energy, with an open kitchen and a lively rap and r&b soundtrack. Â It's the perfect place for a date or dinner with friends or family or even just drinks, as they do have a full bar and constantly changing cocktail specials.",5.0

"I've finally visited The Meatball Shop (for my birthday) and it was just as amazing as everyone told me it would be! We arrived on a Monday at 7pm and were immediately seated. We ordered drinks, and then our waitress went over the specials and explained how to order. Our food came out maybe 5 minutes after we ordered. So fast! I got the spicy pork meatballs over spinach and leek risotto with the parmesan cream sauce. I was a little stressed out because I wasn't sure if I ordered the ""right"" combination but the dish ended up being phenomenal! The flavors blended together really well, the risotto was cooked perfectly and the cream sauce brought everything together. So good! I don't even remember what the boyfriend got. My dish was better though. For dessert, we shared an ice cream sandwich - chocolate chip with vanilla ice cream - which was the perfect ending to an excellent meal.Everything was perfect! Service was super fast. Easy to get to. Definitely one of the best birthdays dinners I've had and I'm looking forward to going back soon.",5.0
"I visited on 09/09/15 for a pre-bday dinner with my bff at around 5:30pm- she is a regular here so she suggested it. Normally, i am not a fan of meatballs, however, i was blown away.

I also had a side of roasted veggies and green beans; the green beans were delicious as well - I wasn't a fan of the roasted veggies because it was zucchini, I hate zucchini. I was too full for dessert, but My friend got some, she had a snickerdoodle brown sugar ice cream sandwich (and she ended up ordering me a cornbread cookie so they could sing happy birthday for me- all the sweets were delicious.

"I was visiting New York and went here on a recommendation as a ""must try"" from friends in the area.The menu has everything you'd imagine - meatballs of various meats with different sauces (from marinara to mushroom). You can order them ""naked"" with a side of focaccia, on a roll, on some veggies etc.I ended up ordering ""the kitchen sink"" which was my choice of meatballs and sauce over chef's selection of veggies. I opted for the classic beef meatballs with meat sauce, per my friend's recommendation. Overall, it was very tasty but not out of this world. If I hadn't already eaten my weights worth of pizza on my trip, I might've opted for the meatball sandwich.There was no wait on a sunny Sunday afternoon. Prices were decent for the area.

Â Rusty and all the servers were so great, the food was delicious, and the even gave us some extra vegetarian balls for one of our non-pork eaters. Â I can't recommend this place enough.",5.0
"So to start off - even before there BALLS, I really have to leave this 5 stars for Mark. I sat at the bar today an tho I have been here many times, I have never had mark as my bartender, and today the customer service was through the roof!!! - a full bar and taking tables he managed to take care of us all and amazingly. He is so hospitable I would come back just for his service! - but now on to the greatest meatballs. Very tender and flavorful. I had the classic balls with spicy sauce! And O M G! If I had any room I would of ate some more! Love this place! And keep up the good work mark! I earned it!!!",5.0
Please try this place!!!! I cannot say enough of this place!!! If you love Motown music and meatballsAll kinds and the spaghetti and fantastic drinksDon't miss this place!!!,5.0
"I went here in windy day around 2 weeks ago, lunch was perfect, Â naked meat balls and side of risotto. also I tried spicy pork slider and ginger lemonade. A little comment that risotto a bit over cooked, but still yummy!",5.0
"This was one of the cutest places I have been to!The place is pretty small but has very intimate lighting. its good for a date. So if you wear glasses, bring them!They are definitely a little pricey and their portions are small depending on what you order. This place is somewhere you do not go with a lot of people due to its size.I ordered meatballs with cheese, and literally the cheese came on the side which was beyond me since I would have melted the cheese on top? I guess I'm different. Nonetheless, it was yummy. There wasn't anything extremely special about the place but I would definitely go again. If I am in the mood for meatballs I would definitely return, but I would not say this place is to ""die for.""The service is definitely amazing, they are really nice. I had the brownie cookie ice cream sandwich and I hated it. They swapped out the cookie without any problem which I truly appreciated.",4.0
"Yum! Chicken balls under risotto with creamy Parmesan sauce was super delicious. Burnt orange margarita was also awesome. Our server, Johnston, was great which is refreshing since every time I eat out in Williamsburg, the service always sucks, I don't know if that's due to all the entitled rich kid residents of WillyB or what but they always suck and they're rude so thanks for not sucking! I'll be back for that ice cream sandwich!! Oh and decent prices too, got an app, 2 entrees, and 2 drinks for $60 before tip.",5.0
"I got the kitchen salad which is 3 balls plus sauce over a bed of greens and vegetables for $11. I sampled the veggie balls and they were tiny but yummy. We went in the early evening so the place was pretty deserted, but by the end of the meal people had started to fill in adding to the ambiance.I haven't been back since and don't see myself going out of the way to do so because it was just okay.",3.0

I ordered 2 meatball sliders (chicken with parm cream and classic beef with spicy meat sauce) along with a side of spinach. The portion size was just enough to leave me full without being stuffed.

Luckily they obliged.My server wasn't exactly attentive but she wasn't down right terrible. I will say it was enough to make the leap from a four to a three star. Good thing I liked the meatballs. ;)I ended up ordering 5 naked balls separate (i wanted to try different flavors!) but it ended up being way too much! The balls are medium sized, tender and flavorful but dense for a meatball. I got 3 classic beef with tomato sauce and 2 classic beef with mushroom gravy. I actually preferred the mushroom gravy, the tomato was a bit lackluster. A diner next to me said she loved all the other sauces compared to the tomato ironically as well.Several sides to choose from like mashed potatoes, risotto, spaghetti, polenta, etc. They also have salads so the Yelpers who said otherwise clearly didn't read the menu. I do find them to bit expensive though, $5. The daily risotto I got was broccoli and cheddar. It was creamy cheesy goodness but a few grains where underdone.TMS also has some interesting cocktails. There's one that's supposed to taste like a ""grown up""version of Kool-Aid named Fool-Aid, I will have to try that next time!

"First you get a menu where you mark what you want. You can something that's already created or create your own. It's an interesting concept. For specials look at the chalkboard and it'll have listing of everyday specialsFood:I ordered spicy meatballs with mushroom gravy sauce and mashed potato on the bottom. I liked the mashed potato but wish I got it on the side instead. The food overall was good but it wasn't great.My husband ordered spicy meatballs with Parmesan sauce and grounded polenta on the side, I thought the sauce was bit salty. The spicy meat isn't that spicy.Drinks: my husband ordered virgin Bloody Mary which he loved because it was spicy and I ordered the cranberry lemonade. I could not taste the lemon or the cranberry. It was just sweet and sparkly. Dessert: we got the ginger cookie and brown sugar ice cream and I think their dessert is much better than the food. The cookie was soft and melted in our mouth.Service: I really liked the service, our waitress was attentive and nice. The food comes out pretty fast.Overall we loved the concept and the atmosphere but food was mediocre/ok. It's worth checking out at least once. Would come back for dessert though.one star for the concept and atmosphere, one star for the service and one star for the dessert.",3.0
"My first meal in Williamsburg and my first time having meatballs specifically for dinner! Â This joint was packed on a Tuesday night. Â Hipsters and young families everywhere you turned. Â Not necessarily drawn to any particular dish off their menu, so I decided to go with their sliders so I would be able to try a variety of meatballs. Â I should have ordered 3, rather than 2 because they were on the tiny side. Â I believe the vegetable side special I had ordered was separate from the sliders -- it was a combination of zucchini, squash... and some other veggies. Â The two sliders were chicken and pesto & spicy meat and beef... Â I was pleased with the flavors of the two. Â I thought the veggies were a little on the salty side though, I did eat them all. Â I wish the sliders were a tad bigger... I had pictured them differently.",3.0
"Great place to eat and hangout with friends. I been here a couple of times. I really enjoy their food and mix drinks. I started with the salad it was so fresh. Â I love it!Then I got the classic meatball sandwich it was delicious. The bread, sauce and meat were fresh ingredients which made then taste even better. I also like the decor so unique. Then I got one the shots they had on special. It was a jello shot not bad for $5 my table got several. Â Good times. Will be back to try out more stuff.",4.0

"First you get a menu where you mark what you want. You can something that's already created or create your own. It's an interesting concept. For specials look at the chalkboard and it'll have listing of everyday specialsFood:I ordered spicy meatballs with mushroom gravy sauce and mashed potato on the bottom. I liked the mashed potato but wish I got it on the side instead. The food overall was good but it wasn't great.My husband ordered spicy meatballs with Parmesan sauce and grounded polenta on the side, I thought the sauce was bit salty. The spicy meat isn't that spicy.Drinks: my husband ordered virgin Bloody Mary which he loved because it was spicy and I ordered the cranberry lemonade. I could not taste the lemon or the cranberry. It was just sweet and sparkly. Dessert: we got the ginger cookie and brown sugar ice cream and I think their dessert is much better than the food. The cookie was soft and melted in our mouth.Service: I really liked the service, our waitress was attentive and nice. The food comes out pretty fast.Overall we loved the concept and the atmosphere but food was mediocre/ok. It's worth checking out at least once. Would come back for dessert though.one star for the concept and atmosphere, one star for the service and one star for the dessert.",3.0
"My first meal in Williamsburg and my first time having meatballs specifically for dinner! Â This joint was packed on a Tuesday night. Â Hipsters and young families everywhere you turned. Â Not necessarily drawn to any particular dish off their menu, so I decided to go with their sliders so I would be able to try a variety of meatballs. Â I should have ordered 3, rather than 2 because they were on the tiny side. Â I believe the vegetable side special I had ordered was separate from the sliders -- it was a combination of zucchini, squash... and some other veggies. Â The two sliders were chicken and pesto & spicy meat and beef... Â I was pleased with the flavors of the two. Â I thought the veggies were a little on the salty side though, I did eat them all. Â I wish the sliders were a tad bigger... I had pictured them differently.",3.0
"Great place to eat and hangout with friends. I been here a couple of times. I really enjoy their food and mix drinks. I started with the salad it was so fresh. Â I love it!Then I got the classic meatball sandwich it was delicious. The bread, sauce and meat were fresh ingredients which made then taste even better. I also like the decor so unique. Then I got one the shots they had on special. It was a jello shot not bad for $5 my table got several. Â Good times. Will be back to try out more stuff.",4.0

I moved to NYC in April 2014 so for only being in this area for 8 months and having been here around 10 times, you can probably tell this is one of my favorites.I tend to bring visitors from out of town here, because the prices are reasonable and it's also a bit of a culinary experience. It's hard to please my dad from suburban Philadelphia but he LOVED this place. Always feels good to take the papa somewhere he doesn't feel like he's being ripped off!That day we both had the kitchen sink. A great deal and decent amount of food. What I love about this place is you can always have a different experience because they always have a seasonal special cooked up. My favorite single items, which as you know you can pair any which way, are the spicy pork meat balls or the chicken meatballs (when I'm feeling more on the healthy side), and the Parmesan cream and mushroom sauces.To be honest, since meatball shop is open until 4 am on weekends, the first time I was here was super late nice (circa 3 am) in the summer and man did I pig out. I had the meatball smash sandwich - which is a reasonable price (around $11), with ""Crown Jewels"" - a fried egg - on their delicious brioche bun and just for the hell of it an ""Affogato"" - espresso shot with a scoop of brown sugar ice cream.

"Pros: very friendly service, very fast service, good tasting foodCons: uncomfortable chairs, not a large menu selection (but that's not surprising considering the name of the venue) The Meatball Shop has 6 locations around NYC and this was my first visit to one.

"3.5 stars...I love the design and concept of this place. I especially like that this location is twice the size of their original location in Manhattan. For those not familiar with these guys, this is how it works: After you're seated, you get a dry erase menu and a black marker to check off whatever you want before handing it to your server. The meatballs come in classic beef, spicy pork, chicken, vegetarian and special (rotating flavor). You can get them in a number of sauces (classic tomato, spicy meat, mushroom/onion, cream, and pesto). You can get your meatballs naked (4 in a bowl) for $7, on a slider for $3 each, a hero (has 3) for $10. They have about a dozen side options ($5 each) that can be served on the side or below the meatballs (which is case primarily for a side of spaghetti or rigatoni). They also have a full bar as well with everything from cheap cans of beer to fancy cocktails. I ordered a bowl of rigatoni and classic beef meatballs in a spicy meat sauce ($12). The portion was just right and the pasta was cooked perfectly. The sauce was solid but Â the meatballs weren't all that great. They tasted very much like pork, it was very dense with a smooth texture and tiny Â bit of Â gristle to it. I thought there had been a mix-up with the order but the server assured me that he took my order correctly for classic beef. Whether it was a mix up or just not that great of a meatball, I took away a full star. As much as this place focuses on meatballs, they should be known just as much for their dessert. Ice cream sandwiches! Sandwiches are $5 (ice cream alone is $3 and cookies alone are $1.50 each). You can choose two different cookies (Chocolate Chip, Peanut Butter, Brownie with walnuts, Snickerdoodle, Ginger Snap, and Special) and the ice cream to go along with it (Chocolate, Vanilla, Espresso, Mint, Caramel, Special). I went with chocolate ice cream with a chocolate chip cookie and a graham cookie (special). The graham cookie tasted nothing like a graham cracker and was a little too spongy. The chocolate chip cookie was really good though. Overall the cookies were too small and the ice cream was too much to eat this thing like a sandwich but I enjoyed eating the pieces separately anyway. The ice cream was one of the best scoops of ice cream I've ever had, it was quite remarkable. The place had more pluses than minuses but between the prices being a tad high and the meatballs being a little disappointing, I may have to give the shop a little break before I come back.",3.0
"Great place! LOYAL customer. Always get the Kitchen Sink with a spec lemonade. Also read the review below and have to say I love the curly ""smile averse"" host. I also like the other curly haired host! Always give me an accurate seating time. The bartenders are on point too! Moscow mule ftw. The line can move slow at times but the dish is well worth it. Always bring friends that aren't from NYC here. Kudos, Meatball Shop.",4.0

"This is the place you come to if you want good meatballs. It doesn't get much simpler than that. I got spicy pork meatballs with mushroom gravy and arugula and apple salad. Great meal... no complaints.The logistics were great. It was super crowded on Friday night, but it only took 30 minutes to wait for a table. In the meantime, I sat at the bar.

"Craving a late night meatball in Brooklyn? Â Well lucky you... the Meatball Shop is one of the better late night options in the Williamsburg area.

Â Delicious pesto sauce. Â The friends went with the spicy pork meatballs with red sauce over mashed potatoes. Â Both types were great, although I do think the pork balls are a bit tastier.Price wise it's not too bad either. Â $7 gets you four hefty meatballs.

This place is so yummy! Great place for comfort food. You have the option to order a variety of meatballs with different sauces and sides such as pasta or even a salad. I especially love their floats and ice cream sandwiches are the best. Try the snickerdoodle cookie with brown sugar icecream,5.0

"Love that we have TMS in the neighborhood! I eat here regularly and find everything pretty dang good. We love to order the ""Kitchen Sink"" to load up on fresh and pickled veggies.

Only thing I wish is that they'd offer a quality ginger beer, or let me BYOGB to wash down those meatballzz.",4.0

"3.5 stars...I love the design and concept of this place. I especially like that this location is twice the size of their original location in Manhattan. For those not familiar with these guys, this is how it works: After you're seated, you get a dry erase menu and a black marker to check off whatever you want before handing it to your server. The meatballs come in classic beef, spicy pork, chicken, vegetarian and special (rotating flavor). You can get them in a number of sauces (classic tomato, spicy meat, mushroom/onion, cream, and pesto).

"In the past week that I have been in NYC I have been thinking about all of the great food places that I have visited and The Meatball Shop is definitely at the top of my list. Â This place is AMAZING!! Â The idea of having a restaurant centered around meatballs is such a smart idea. Â The way it works is you choose the type of meatball you want, they have classic beef, chicken, Turkey and two others to choose from. Â Then, you choose the type of sauce you want your meatballs smothered in; I got the spicy meat sauce, and I loved it. Â It's not very spicy, but it has enough of a kick that it definitely adds a great taste. Â The meatballs and the sauce (also comes with a slice of bread) is $8, but you have options to add to your meatballs. Â You can add a fried egg for $1 and even though it may sound a bit weird, trust me it was a great choice. Â They also have other toppings such spaghetti, ravioli, and mashed potatoes that you can add for $5. Â I chose the mashed potatoes because well, I love mashed potatoes. Â The meatballs with the spicy sauce, fried egg, mashed potatoes and cheese made for a creamy, yet not heavy, combination. Â Even though it seems like it won't be enough, trust me when I say that it is more than enough to fill you up. Â They also have all kinds of beers and combinations, such as a whiskey float, that are available to choose. Â The beers and sangria run for $6, which is standard price I'd say. Â Overall my meal, plus a beer was roughly $21, but it was worth every cent. Â I highly recommend this place Also there may be a wait, we waited about 20 minutes before we were seated to eat.",5.0
"I've been wanting to come eat at The Meatball Shop for a while now, every time I try the wait is too long. Finally got to try it, but in BK. When we got there, there was a wait of course. We headed to a bar across the street. When we came back because they told us our table was ready, we waited for another good 20 minutes. Liars. So we grabbed a pitcher of beer for $20 at the bar. Beer helps everything.I like the ambiance of the place. It was dim with candles, a good place to take a date. The menus were unique, They were laminated and you just check off what you want with dry erase markers. Genius! Surprised more places don't do this. I ordered the ""Special"" balls with the ""Special"" Sauce ;) over rigatoni. Basically it was reuben ball with a Thousand Island type sauce. Pretty interesting/good if you like Thousand Island dressing. I enjoyed it. Will definitely try a more normal ball next time. I did feel the portions were a bit small though.I recommend this place for people looking to have a nice dinner and eating some delicious meatballs.

"During our day trip to Williamsburg I was ecstatic to find the Meatball Shop !!!

I know, I know you've got lots of jokes for that one.... Everything is choose your own in that you can choose your style of meat balls (beef, pork, spicy, mild) as well as sauce (alfredo, pesto, tomato). They have a great bar that you can hang out at with smaller tables right near by. I thought this was wonderful because if you're not in the mood for a sit-down dinner you can stop in for a beer and an easy appetizer. It's casual comfort without being divey! My favorite part of the experience? The oatmeal coconut cookies w/ caramel ice cream!!! It was cray cray kind of good and you'll have to take a peak at the photo.

I went back with the same two friends this time because one of them didn't eat yet that day.

"Besides some obvious, and tiring double entendres there isn't much going for it. We ended up sitting at the bar because there was no one at the host stand, our bartender/server did a good job of handling the full bar plus because people were pulling up stools but he seemed a little harried. Fortunately, the ordering system is an easy one since it's all checklists. I got the special ball, the Jambalaya which was supposed to be andouille and shrimp, but no special sauce instead, the plain marinara was recommended so I went with that. I figured I should just get the 'naked balls' so I could taste them without any fancy dressing. The Jambalaya ball was okay, I couldn't really taste anything more than andouille, no shrimp or other seafood.The gf got the regular beef balls with the 'Family Jewels' (see how worn out it gets?) which was an over easy egg. You know, I've really had better. If you're going to be a 1 item restaurant it better be the best damn meatball I've tasted, which was not the case. Maggiano's has a better meatball, seriously.

"The Meatball Shop is an all around great restaurant. The food here is delicious- you really can't go wrong with pretty much anything you order. Of course, the meatballs are bomb, but so are the sides. My absolute favorite dish to order is the beef meatballs with spicy meat sauce (it's mild), with polenta either on the side or underneath. The combination of a perfectly creamy polenta with sauce is divine. I have also ordered the meatball sub, which is good but better on white Italian bread (not as good on wheat, in my opinion). The salads are also pretty tasty. They also have a really yummy, refreshing plum lemonade that I love. That about does it- I haven't really tried the other dishes except for the spicy pork meatballs. The traditional beef with sauce and polenta is Italian comfort food, so that's what I end up ordering pretty much every time. As for the ambiance, it's casual and usually pretty busy. The waiters have all been attentive and service is reasonably quick. I like to stop by once in a while when the meatball craving strikes.",4.0

The bartender gave great service, was totally cool about me walking in with a redbull (that I got for free from a redbull truck nearby) and drinking it and the food came very fast.I got 3 sliders-- pork with mushroom sauce, beef with pesto and beef with spicy meat sauce. The flavors were pronounced, buttery toasted bread, and the meat was so tender it was insane. I got a market salad on the side, with greens, raisins, pickled fennel barley and a lemon - jalapeno vinaigrette. I can't say I tasted much of the jalapeno but the salad was a nice fresh bite with all that buttery juicy meat.

"Definitely above my expectations. I had heard about its deliciousness for a long time but had never made it out there. Went in expecting a deli meat counter set up but instead got a sit down restaurant with a really cool decor instead. The menus are fun, they're laminated and you get to mark your selections on the menu with a marker. They have about 4 or so meatballs (beef, spicy pork, chicken, and veggie). I got the spicy pork with the Parmesan cream sauce with mashed potatoes. My friend got three different slider combos (beef/mushroom sauce, pork/Parmesan cream, and chicken/pesto). Everything was delicious! The Parmesan cream literally blew my mind. I got my combo based upon our waitresses recommendations and the spicy pork had a nice kick to it (may do the beef next time though) and the chicken with pesto was amazing too. Â Then to top it off, we got a giant ice cream sandwich which was extremely tasty.

I didn't realize how much Williamsburg had changed it was awesome, Bedford Avenue had everything you can think of from bars, restaurants of all kinds of food and people everywhere just walking and strolling around it was really nice! About 30 minutes later they finally called us and we got a small table, the place is not that big and theres a bar area then the cooking area where you can actually see the cooks making your food and even eat close to them with of course a huge glass blocking you off, but it was nice.The way you order is that they give you a menu and you choose what type of meatballs or as they say ""balls"" you want and then you check it off with a marker and then they come and take your order. They had meatballs with regular sauce, pesto, spicy sauces, sweet and even had veggie, chicken and beef balls. The meat balls either came with a nice salad or you could order sides like risotto, pasta, salad, or veggies. We also tried this drink called Fruit Aid Punch not sure if I spelled it correctly and it was SO GOOD! Didn't taste the alcohol it was like grape juice and that can be a bad thing haha. Cheers! I had the pesto meatball sandwich with mozzarella and a side salad, DELICIOUS! So soft and tasty and I am obsess with pesto and it was that damn good, and the salad was so good too, my bf had the veggie meatballs with regular tomato sauce with a side of pasta and it was really good! I loved every single bite, this place was just that damn good!The waiters were awesome, food was quick and delicious, they played awesome music, the place was packed and the drinks were coming in handy.

I always try the special when coming here, the chef really knows what he is doing when he mixes and matches wacky ingredients to make the perfect meatball. They are so good you don't need bread!

They were cooked to perfection, served at the right temperature with the perfect amount of sauce, with a piece of foccacia bread to clean your plate. The portions are generous.

"Holy great meatballs!!! Â Why is there no place like this in Charlotte, NC!?!?! Â Everyone who is in NY needs to experience this place. Â No joke. Â When I first saw the place from the street, I didn't think too much of it. Â My friends were insisting that this was a really good place to check out. Â When I walked in, I felt like I was in a store tucked away in a small countryside. Â Where I was seated with my friends, we were at the end of a big table set for 10. Â It was nice, similar to a picnic table. Â The decorations were wonderful with a touch of flowers in a jar to make you feel like you're dining in the country.Okay, I usually don't judge a restaurant by their bathroom, but it was just too adorable I have to mention it!!! Â The set up is a little dark in the bathroom, but it gave you an old time feel. Â They have old pictures set up, a cool old looking sink, and it was just so nice and clean in there.Alright, now for the food. Â One word...AMAZING. Â I had ordered two sliders, where you can order a kind of meatball, and what sauce you would like with it. Â Mine were just delicious. Â I suggest to try the sliders because you are given a variety of meatballs and sauces to choose from. Â The sliders are also small, and not that expensive so you can try out more if you wish! Â Upon coming to this place, I know that it's found a place of love in my belly. Â Meatballs, you rock! Â I would also like to point out that while I was eating, I kept thinking of Little Richard's Meatball Song...sorry really random!",5.0

Â I asked for more sauce, which apparently costs 0.50$, haha?The balls are good, they have the right amount of spices, and they are not too salty which is good.The vegetables were good, can't go wrong.I am never going back during the day, but if I'm in Bedford, and it's 1am, maybe.",3.0
"First time here...love the relaxed atmosphere, friendly staff and delicious food. Â The White Peach Sangria was refreshing and light. Â Enjoyed the hint of mint! The kitchen sink salad with chicken meatballs, pesto sauce and the family jewels was the perfect accompaniment! If you are looking to relax and feel like a local. ..this the place. Â Looking forward to coming back :)",4.0
"The chicken meatballs with classic tomato I got were very good, but I felt that the daily specials were where it was really at.The market salad was excellent with green leaf, carrots, plums, and honey cumin vinaigrette. Â Definitely not a boring salad and a good choice for the pickier salad eater. Â Too many bland, limp salads out there but this is not one of them.Their chili ball with cheddar cheese sauce and sweet pepper risotto were also very flavorful and inventive.Fun restaurant with creative and flavorful dishes!",4.0
Been to the meatball shop many times and they haven't disappointed. The classic meatballs with spicy meat sauce are a must and their mashed potatoes are on point!! Only downside is the portions are not huge and it is a bit overpriced for meatballs and mash.,4.0
"I ordered the Classic Beef meatball with the Mushroom Gravy sauce and the risotto as a side. Gotta say the meatballs lived up to its reputation, can't say the same about the risotto. It was a bit thick for my liking.",4.0
"I think the best part of moving to NYC was discovering The Meatball Shop. I come here with friends, lovers, coworkers, everyone. Get family jewels on your balls and finish your meal with cinnamon sugar ice cream between two snickerdoodle cookies and rediscover what pure happiness feels like. If any desert could cure cancer, it would be that one. Fellas, take your lady to the Meatball Shop and thank me later.",5.0
"Damn...a restaurant dedicated to meatballs...why didn't I think of that?Delicious, custom ordered meatballs. The spicy ones have a kick (which is great). Cute little shop in Williamsburg, but I know they have other locations in the LES and the village. It's places like these that make me really miss living in NYC.",5.0
The food here is on the money! The atmosphere was on point.....they played 90's Hip-Hop which is right up my alley. The only negative I can give it is they only had one waitress working and it was brunch time which you know for a restaurant in Williamsburg it is not enough. Other than that I'll keep coming back.,4.0
"Holy great meatballs!!! Â Why is there no place like this in Charlotte, NC!?!?! Â Everyone who is in NY needs to experience this place. Â No joke. Â When I first saw the place from the street, I didn't think too much of it. Â My friends were insisting that this was a really good place to check out. Â When I walked in, I felt like I was in a store tucked away in a small countryside. Â Where I was seated with my friends, we were at the end of a big table set for 10. Â It was nice, similar to a picnic table. Â The decorations were wonderful with a touch of flowers in a jar to make you feel like you're dining in the country.Okay, I usually don't judge a restaurant by their bathroom, but it was just too adorable I have to mention it!!! Â The set up is a little dark in the bathroom, but it gave you an old time feel. Â They have old pictures set up, a cool old looking sink, and it was just so nice and clean in there.Alright, now for the food. Â One word...AMAZING. Â I had ordered two sliders, where you can order a kind of meatball, and what sauce you would like with it. Â Mine were just delicious. Â I suggest to try the sliders because you are given a variety of meatballs and sauces to choose from. Â The sliders are also small, and not that expensive so you can try out more if you wish! Â Upon coming to this place, I know that it's found a place of love in my belly. Â Meatballs, you rock! Â I would also like to point out that while I was eating, I kept thinking of Little Richard's Meatball Song...sorry really random!",5.0
"Cute place, unique decor, reminding me of the industrial period, I initially hoped to try one of their meatball dishes since that is their namesake, but I wasn't a fan after learning that the meatballs were often mixed with pork. It's truly unfortunate for diners like myself who doesn't eat pork. I played it safe. I kept to the desserts and ordered an ice cream sandwich made of two snickerdoodle cookies and chocolate ice cream. Thumbs up!",4.0
"This place was great. My kids and I loved it. It was fun, comfortable and a bit rowdy in a good way. The servers we super friendly and when I came time for dessert (brown sugar ice cream) they even weighed it so that I could give my type 1 diabetic son insulin to cover it safely. I got meatballs with salad (so good with a fried egg!) my kids got meatballs, spaghetti with broccoli and salad.",5.0
Ordered a spicy meatball and spicy meat sauce and during the eating of the meal noticed that the meal was more spicy than normal. Later on that night realized that the cook didn't remove all of the acid from his sauce that was made that night. The heart burn was unbearable. Had to sleep sitting up to control it. Went to the pharmacy in the morning and had to invest in Tums and Zantac that was recommended from the pharmacist to cure it. I recommend that the manager should of tested that sauce before it was served to the public for acid levels. If someone had a stomach problem this could of created serious damage to there system. If the health inspector ever had a ruling on acid levels that could be served this would of failed right away.,1.0

I got the veggie option and was not disappointed in the least bit.Good spot to check out for a quick bite and maybe a drink on the fly.",4.0
i'm a HUGE fan of TMS. I usually go to their LES location but I was in Brooklyn a couple of months ago with a group of friends so we decided to come by and check out the brooklyn location.

"Great balls of fire! I've been here a couple of times and it's been great! I even had a birthday gathering here. Their specials change regularly and their risotto is so good. I've had the chicken, beef, lamb, turkey and veggie balls here. The lamb is my favorite but unfortunately it's a special so you never know when it's coming back. The sauces are great. I love the Parmesan creme but the pesto, mushroom and tomato sauces will have you happy. All in all a great place to get your Ball on!",4.0
"I was given a table outside and I heard this guy passing by saying...""So, what do you eat here? Balls?"" Yes, exactly! Delicious, flavorful, juicy, MEAT balls. You know this place is good when you sit outside and all you hear is people passing by saying ""Is this THE meatball shop?"" The line was forming out the restaurant. I'd advise you to get there early, because there's usually a small wait. I never knew I would be such a fan of meatballs. The atmosphere at the Williamsburg location is really chill and hipster. I love their menu concept where you check what you want on the menu with a marker. You can meatballs naked, as sliders, on a hero, or with sides. I can't pick a favorite but I've had the classic beef, the spicy pork, and chicken meatballs. All of the meatballs are really good and the sauces are just as good. My favorite would be the pesto, but if you want something more rich, go for the parmesan cream. I also love their polenta, it's so creamy and rich. Whenever I go, I always ask the server what all of the specials are that day. They usual feature more unique items if you're looking for something different. Also, please make room for their dessert. I'm begging you to get the ice cream sandwich. They have the best cookies...I mean, the PERFECT chewy cookies. I ordered the special that day, which was a graham cracker cookie and key lime pie ice cream. I mean, truthfully, the ice cream was good but I got tired of the key lime taste after a while, but their cookie was BOMB. I really love this place.",5.0
"Great meal, awesome service, strong drinks. I had the spicy pork meatballs with classic tomato sauce over spaghetti (it was linguine, not spaghetti). My friends both had the kitchen sink and we each got a cocktail: the white russian, hemmingway daiquiri, and moscow mule. We also had an espresso, snicker doodle, and brownie walnut ice cream sandwich which was pretty good. Our waitress was awesome and the atmosphere was nice and for somewhere in the middle of williamsburg it was decently priced. This is definitely a safe bet in the neighborhood but I'll probably come back here for lunch rather than dinner.",4.0
"I still don't get it. As I have eaten at the other location on Stanton Street, and came away from that experience feeling totally underwhelmed, and now recently at the Bedford Ave outpost, I can only assume one of a few things - A) Most people don't really know what good meatballs really taste like.B) Most people never grew up in a household with an Italian family that made amazing meatballs and sauces - and still does.C) People are sheeple and just want to gush about this place like many others and play follow the leader.Now don't get me wrong. I feel these meatball emporiums are decent enough, but it's become a trend now that is already being duplicated. To me, these spots are good as a snack food option, or even better, a drunk food meal to fill your belly when bar hopping along Bedford Ave.Still, I came away underwhelmed with my meal here just as I had previously at the other location. We actually sauntered into this spot on New Year's Eve after a night of partying at the Whiskey Bar. Yes, a few of us were kinda drunk, a few of us were a bit buzzed, and a few were pretty borderline sober. As the place was mostly empty they were able to seat our party of seven easily. It's a bigger location than the other with a nice open layout and decor. I have to give props to our waitress who was very patient with our group of misfits on this evening. She helped us with our orders and quickly accommodated our request for meals to go when a few of our group had to leave abruptly.I ordered the classic beef hero - Il Forno baguette with 3 balls, sauce and mozzarella cheese served with a small side salad for $9. Now, for the amount of food here the price is right. As for the taste - lacking. To me, the meatballs were very dry, and the sauce just did not stand out. Also, there is just not enough sauce Â included to compensate for the dry baguette. There was just too much ""dryness"" overall in this meal. Meatballs should be big, juicy, and tender. The salad was a tasty side I have to admit. Also, Abita root beer on tap is something you don't see too often, along with a small but decent enough mix of beers and wines.So now I have tried their meatballs at two of their locations. Both times have been underwhelming. Maybe I expect too much. Maybe I need to lower my meatball standards. Anyway, I don't think I will give their other location on Greenwich Ave a shot at strike three. Unless I am down there and really drunk, which does happen on occasion. Never say never.",3.0

Stopped here for some impromptu food to take into the park and eat. 4 meatballs for $8.. not that shabby. You get a little delightful piece of bread to eat with it so its actually very good.

"Like most places in New York, there's not much else to be said. I came here with my friend who lives in the area. It really reminds me of the vibe of lots of places in Denver, believe it or not. I like the white board idea for ordering, and the cocktail menu was really interesting and creative. I ended up getting the kitchen sink salad, and that is a great deal. Unfortunately it came out wrong initially but it was quickly fixed. I was a little surprised that some salad items are hot and some are cold and some are not the temperature you're expecting, so that was a bit surprising. Everything on the plate was really tasty, though I found the kale salad to be a bit salty. The quinoa, and sweet potatoes were both very delicious on their own. I'm not the type to mix my foods together but everything would have gone well mixed up as well. My only other gripe would be that they charged me for the items they incorrectly brought me to begin with. Again, it was rectified but our waitress acted like the kitchen screwed up our order but since she charged me for the wrong item she clearly ordered it wrong and chose to not own up to it, which is crappy for the kitchen staff.

It is so freaking good!Of the sides I've had, the risotto was surprisingly good and cooked properly.They have a decent bar selection here, too. I appreciated that they actually had some decent scotch on hand as that was what I was in the mood for and sometimes places will just have whiskey. Dessert cookies are just okay.",5.0
Stopped here for some impromptu food to take into the park and eat. 4 meatballs for $8.. not that shabby. You get a little delightful piece of bread to eat with it so its actually very good. The marinara sauces are better than the cheese ones in my opinion but then again I don't recall eating meatballs with cheese sauce in my lifetime so maybe I was being a bit touchy. I got two orders .. one with chicken meatballs and one with beef... yum,4.0
"I ate my first meal of 2014 here. I was super hungover and they were blasting music obnoxiously, but hey, it was New Year's Day and the staff seemed to be in good spirits. Â They were dancing around to singing with customers. If you have to work on New Year's day, why not turn your restaurant into a club? I might have been more into it if my ears weren't still ringing from the night before.I settled for this place because I didn't want to wait in line anywhere else.I got meatballs with spaghetti. Very basic, but that was about all my stomach could handle at that point. It was good. My partner in crime got the mashed potatoes with the pork meatballs. He liked it. Seems like a good place to grab food before going out.",4.0
"I'll take you to The Meatball Shop. It's cool if ya mouth just dropped. This food definitely hit the spot. Spicy pork baaaaalls all up in ya mouf! Drizzled wit a lil bit o' dat white stuff The Pilgrims called mashed potatoes.But you know what the pilgrims ain't have that you'll have here?A menu where you check off the balls you want with a dry erase maker.So, if one minute you want some traditional balls but then you're like...naaaw lemme get some other type o' balls...some special balls...you just wipe off that X and X something else.X whatever balls is gonna hit the spot. You know what spot I'm talkin' about.That spot you hit when you eat a big meal after a long fast.If you're ever on Bedford, you gotta come through and eat some balls.Wash 'em down with a beverage and then go ""Aaaaaahhhhhhh....refreshing.""I don't always eat balls...but when I do...I'm in Brooklyn.",4.0
"Like most places in New York, there's not much else to be said. I came here with my friend who lives in the area. It really reminds me of the vibe of lots of places in Denver, believe it or not. I like the white board idea for ordering, and the cocktail menu was really interesting and creative. I ended up getting the kitchen sink salad, and that is a great deal. Unfortunately it came out wrong initially but it was quickly fixed. I was a little surprised that some salad items are hot and some are cold and some are not the temperature you're expecting, so that was a bit surprising. Everything on the plate was really tasty, though I found the kale salad to be a bit salty. The quinoa, and sweet potatoes were both very delicious on their own. I'm not the type to mix my foods together but everything would have gone well mixed up as well. My only other gripe would be that they charged me for the items they incorrectly brought me to begin with. Again, it was rectified but our waitress acted like the kitchen screwed up our order but since she charged me for the wrong item she clearly ordered it wrong and chose to not own up to it, which is crappy for the kitchen staff. There's a ton of places in Williamsburg to try before I'd need to come back, but this place is yummy and I'd happily return.",4.0
"I would go back to this place over and over again.Meatballs are delicious and you can get them with salad, mash potatoes or spaghetti.

"The wait can be a bit crazy, but it's worth it!

I've only stopped by for lunch at odd hours (around 3pm) so I never had a hard time finding a seat but always opted for a seat at the bar. The bartenders are very friendly and helpful for those who don't know what to order.

I like the classic beef and spicy pork balls and have only tried the spicy meat sauce because I liked it so much. Next time, I will try the chicken with a new sauce, perhaps the mushroom gravy. The restaurant is filled with old ghost pictures (which at first fooled me into thinking that the restaurant was 200 years old but my bf later pointed out that he saw the same creepy photo of a baby at the antique store a few stores down....) but it sure gives it a cool vibe.

I WAS IN HEAVEN. the sauce was a little spicy but it blend in well with everything. it was a mixture of awesomeness and hunger. the cheese wasn't too melted it was a slice of mozarella. the meatballs just tasted really soft and awesome. my friend had one with mushroom sauce which i really like as well so that would be something i would recommend as well. i think next time i would go for the heroes... its bigger portion with just $1 more..

"First experience of eating meatball as main dish I never thought meatball could have a restaurant. (being a star of a restaurant) Since when I was little, meatballs were always in the part of dish but not main if there were meatball in. It is loud closer to door because they have music and full bar in front, but if you go in there are tables with rather quiet space. I liked that they offer unique order system here that also I enjoyed. Basically you custom and write down what you would like on their laminated menu with marker. We tried beef meatballs of 4 with traditional tomato sauce, and Salad with chicken meatball with mushroom sauce. I personally enjoyed their vegetable and mushroom than the meatballs. Â The meatballs were biggerOpening pretty late as they have bar, that is very plus point since we came after 11p.m. and could stay until 2a.m.The place itself is 4 stars, experience is 4 start, I for my record it is 3 stars for myself because for the first place meatball is not my favorite food, it's very heavy and too soft, and very american if I distinguish them from asian or european dishes. I will not come here by myself, but I will love to come with friend who would like to share dishes and enjoy drink as well.As I'm slow drinker and I will take only one or two glass of beer or wine, I like to have someone who is strong at alcohol and can drink in good speed, otherwise we will feel bad staying longer here especially at night. (even though the staffs are friendly) I liked their veggie:) that's what I will remember of this place.",4.0
"I have been to this location about a handful of times and every time I was promptly seated and served a delicious meal in a timely manner. Going to the meatball shop would have you believe that you would see huge lines and be rushed, usually you get a fairly large crowd in the evenings but you're never rushed through a meal. The food matches the service which is consistent and refreshing, I haven't had a bad item off of the menu yet. I'll be back again soon.",5.0
This is my favorite Meatball Shop location. I've visited many times and they do not disappoint. It's spacious and the staff is great. I'm always happy with the food and drinks at the Shop. My favorite ball is still the Chicken with Pesto but I keep an eye out for their Cajun ball with Spicy Tomato sauce and Steak and Bacon Cheddar ball with Mushroom gravy. The Fool Aid Punch is good enough to attempt to make at home and you can't go wrong with finishing any meal with one of their ice cream sandwiches (you can even order one with two different cookies). They are also very helpful to people with allergies which is important to me. Now who wants some balls?,5.0
"I love this place! It can be crazy crowded, even at 10 p.m., but it's an inexpensive and super delicious meal. I always get the meatball smash, which is two meatballs on a brioche bun with your choice of sauce and cheese. It comes with their side salad of arugula and apple slices. The whole thing is super yummy, and only about $10. My favorite is the spicy pork meatball, and I really like the pesto sauce (though I've also tried the meat sauce and the parmesan, and those aren't bad either). They always have a special lemonade with some really weird flavors (pomelo, grape, blackberry, tarragon, etc), but it's great to try. A good time to go is right when they open on the weekends at 12. It seems to be pretty empty when I've gone then.",5.0

Â If that's how you arrive at The Meatball Shop, you'll never be disappointed.I always get the same thing, because it's never failed me. Â Everything But the Kitchen Sink with Spicy Pork balls and either Pesto or Spicy Meat Sauce, add Family Jewels (fried egg). Â It's fun and risky, since you never know what you're gonna get as far as the veggies are concerned. Â But it's not really risky at all, because you know it will be amazing, fresh, and tasty.Whiskey, vanilla liqueur, root beer float for $7? Â God yes. Â I suppose we'll just keep this buzz going.",5.0
"First experience of eating meatball as main dish I never thought meatball could have a restaurant. (being a star of a restaurant) Since when I was little, meatballs were always in the part of dish but not main if there were meatball in. It is loud closer to door because they have music and full bar in front, but if you go in there are tables with rather quiet space. I liked that they offer unique order system here that also I enjoyed. Basically you custom and write down what you would like on their laminated menu with marker. We tried beef meatballs of 4 with traditional tomato sauce, and Salad with chicken meatball with mushroom sauce. I personally enjoyed their vegetable and mushroom than the meatballs. Â The meatballs were biggerOpening pretty late as they have bar, that is very plus point since we came after 11p.m. and could stay until 2a.m.The place itself is 4 stars, experience is 4 start, I for my record it is 3 stars for myself because for the first place meatball is not my favorite food, it's very heavy and too soft, and very american if I distinguish them from asian or european dishes. I will not come here by myself, but I will love to come with friend who would like to share dishes and enjoy drink as well.As I'm slow drinker and I will take only one or two glass of beer or wine, I like to have someone who is strong at alcohol and can drink in good speed, otherwise we will feel bad staying longer here especially at night. (even though the staffs are friendly) I liked their veggie:) that's what I will remember of this place.",4.0
"I have been to this location about a handful of times and every time I was promptly seated and served a delicious meal in a timely manner. Going to the meatball shop would have you believe that you would see huge lines and be rushed, usually you get a fairly large crowd in the evenings but you're never rushed through a meal. The food matches the service which is consistent and refreshing, I haven't had a bad item off of the menu yet. I'll be back again soon.",5.0
This is my favorite Meatball Shop location. I've visited many times and they do not disappoint. It's spacious and the staff is great. I'm always happy with the food and drinks at the Shop. My favorite ball is still the Chicken with Pesto but I keep an eye out for their Cajun ball with Spicy Tomato sauce and Steak and Bacon Cheddar ball with Mushroom gravy. The Fool Aid Punch is good enough to attempt to make at home and you can't go wrong with finishing any meal with one of their ice cream sandwiches (you can even order one with two different cookies). They are also very helpful to people with allergies which is important to me. Now who wants some balls?,5.0
"I love this place! It can be crazy crowded, even at 10 p.m., but it's an inexpensive and super delicious meal. I always get the meatball smash, which is two meatballs on a brioche bun with your choice of sauce and cheese. It comes with their side salad of arugula and apple slices. The whole thing is super yummy, and only about $10. My favorite is the spicy pork meatball, and I really like the pesto sauce (though I've also tried the meat sauce and the parmesan, and those aren't bad either). They always have a special lemonade with some really weird flavors (pomelo, grape, blackberry, tarragon, etc), but it's great to try. A good time to go is right when they open on the weekends at 12. It seems to be pretty empty when I've gone then.",5.0
"I cannot begin to describe how much I regret returning to The Meatball Shop. Â  I was in the neighborhood, I was hungry and it wasn't terribly crowded around 1 in the afternoon.

We had to ask the waiter what the specials were, he didn't offer them. The salad was fresh but came with a lot of very thinly sliced apples in it. I don't care for apples or any type of fruit in my salad, so I asked the waiter if I could get a salad without apples in it. He was very accommodating and got me a new salad.",1.0

The ice cream sandwiches at The Meatball Shop are very good. I have had them many times at the LES location. Sometimes I stop in for just that and no meatballs! Back to the food, it was all excellent. The chicken pesto balls were my favorite. Very juicy and flavorful. Ironically, it was the turkey ball that was drier.

Â I loved that we could order single sliders in order to really sample the menu. Â The sides were all yummy, we'll-portioned and fresh: carrot-thyme risotto, collard greens, and the most scrumptious mashed potatoes--just like mom's! Â Dessert was a heavenly ice cream sandwich: a healthy scoop of brown sugar ice cream nestled between a snickerdoodle cookie and an oatmeal raisin cookie...so ridiculously good!

"First of all, I saw this on Food Network and immediately wanted to try it. Second, we decided to venture out to the BK location instead of the one in Manhattan (BK's the new Manhattan right?)Upon walking into the restaurant, I immediate fell in love. The decor was breathtakingly beautiful, simple, rustic/vintage and just oh so hipster. I loved it!! We sat in the back by the skylight, the lighting was just perfect.Now for the meatballs. I should warn you that the menu is confusing as anything. I think we stared at it for a good 15 minutes because we didn't understand it....too many choices and combinations. We ended up getting some naked balls. Mind you these are tapas style, small plates meant for sharing. This is where the ratings go down...Classic beef with spicy meat sauce - this is a meatball place. The classic beef should be perfection. Sadly, it was not. It was dry and not moist at all. No one wants a dry ball of hamburger meat. The spicy meat sauce was good but there was not enough of it. Spicy pork with parm cream - Probably because it's a pork meatball, this one was a tad moister, but still slightly dry. It could've used a bit more fat because it was so flaky. The parm cream sauce was divine.Special with mushroom gravy - Same as above, was disappointed in how dry and normal these meatballs tasted. And they were not huge honkers either, just normal size meatballs.Risotto - Cheesy and cream, this was a good dish. Complimented well with the dry meatballs.Maybe we'll try the Manhattan location next time. Saw a lot of people eating meatball sandwiches, so maybe that's the way to go.",4.0

I got to satisfy my craving and enjoyed a glass of Cabernet which paired perfectly. Even though it was pretty packed, the restaurant has a cosy and comfortable vibe which is really inviting and calm. This place is a great take on simple and hearty dishes that ushers in the comfort food vibe. Like being home for the holidays.",4.0

"Stopped in for dinner after a recommendation from a family member and I'm glad I did. Simple menu with meatballs , meatballs and more meatballs. The traditional is a solid choice and the sauce is definitely not from a can. Pricing is very reasonable and worth every penny. Finish it all off with a home made cookie ice cream sandwich.

"I ordered beef meatballs in classic tomato sauce with rigatoni and a pitcher of Sixpoints Bengal I shared with my friend. Â The beer was awesome but I'm a sucker for locally brewed IPA's. I thought the meatballs were a little dry. The sauce was bland. Â The rigatoni was a little undercooked. Â Pretty disappointing considering that dish is one my personal favorites. Practically grew up eating meatballs and rigs. There were alot more interesting things I could've ordered on the menu, like spicy pork in mushroom gravy over polenta or something.

"So I have fully resisted the meatball trend but I broke down one night in the Burg and tried this locale. Â Ummm the salad plate with meatballs was aweosme. Â One of the most delicious things I heave eaten in a while. Â I love that you customize what time of balls/ sauce and all the veggies made this an awesome healthy meal. Â This spot is super busy, service was fast and I was super happy for $11 with the generous portion.",5.0
"Stopped in for Sunday lunch and were seated quickly, which we appreciated. Â Tried a few different meatballs and sauces: Â chicken with pesto was really good and fresh tasting, classic with tomato sauce over spaghetti was disappointingly bland and the pasta was overcooked but the shaved Parmesan was a nice touch, Â veggie balls with Parmesan cream sauce was good, spicy pork with spicy tomato was good too, and the best was the special buffalo chicken with bleu cheese sauce--delish! Â I loved that we could order single sliders in order to really sample the menu. Â The sides were all yummy, we'll-portioned and fresh: carrot-thyme risotto, collard greens, and the most scrumptious mashed potatoes--just like mom's! Â Dessert was a heavenly ice cream sandwich: a healthy scoop of brown sugar ice cream nestled between a snickerdoodle cookie and an oatmeal raisin cookie...so ridiculously good! Â The service was great and the prices were reasonable. Â If we could eliminate the hipsters, I'd eat there every day.",4.0
"First of all, I saw this on Food Network and immediately wanted to try it. Second, we decided to venture out to the BK location instead of the one in Manhattan (BK's the new Manhattan right?)Upon walking into the restaurant, I immediate fell in love. The decor was breathtakingly beautiful, simple, rustic/vintage and just oh so hipster. I loved it!! We sat in the back by the skylight, the lighting was just perfect.Now for the meatballs. I should warn you that the menu is confusing as anything. I think we stared at it for a good 15 minutes because we didn't understand it....too many choices and combinations. We ended up getting some naked balls. Mind you these are tapas style, small plates meant for sharing. This is where the ratings go down...Classic beef with spicy meat sauce - this is a meatball place. The classic beef should be perfection. Sadly, it was not. It was dry and not moist at all. No one wants a dry ball of hamburger meat. The spicy meat sauce was good but there was not enough of it. Spicy pork with parm cream - Probably because it's a pork meatball, this one was a tad moister, but still slightly dry. It could've used a bit more fat because it was so flaky. The parm cream sauce was divine.Special with mushroom gravy - Same as above, was disappointed in how dry and normal these meatballs tasted. And they were not huge honkers either, just normal size meatballs.Risotto - Cheesy and cream, this was a good dish. Complimented well with the dry meatballs.Maybe we'll try the Manhattan location next time. Saw a lot of people eating meatball sandwiches, so maybe that's the way to go.",4.0

"I'm still dreaming about their meatballs! I came in with 2 friends and the service was immediate from the point we entered to receiving our check. I ordered the spicy pork meatballs with their meat sauce, alongside their daily risotto..which included a great amount of parmigiano reggiano. I got to satisfy my craving and enjoyed a glass of Cabernet which paired perfectly. Even though it was pretty packed, the restaurant has a cosy and comfortable vibe which is really inviting and calm. This place is a great take on simple and hearty dishes that ushers in the comfort food vibe. Like being home for the holidays.",4.0

"Their specials can be quite spot on. I had their turkey meatball special as it was around Thanksgiving. It was perfect to remind me of how good Thanksgiving dinner was.

I would probably get 3 bals in a bowl and then hoard up on some bread and sides.The highlight of the place are the rotating specials. Keep an eye out for what the specials of the day are and order those.As for drinks, they have their own Sixpoint beer, Wheatball, which is pretty good for wheat ale lovers.

I was really expecting heaven when I came here. I mean... It's THE meatball shop. I think next time I would order differently. I ordered a hero on wheat but.. Did u ever eat a sandwich and it just felt so bready? It was just a lot of bread. I had the chicken ballz with Parmesan cream sauce. It was of course great. Next time id like to try out tue veg ballz! Friends said the sangria was poppin' and ice cream sandwich is rave worthy. Anyway... I'll be back.,3.0
absolutly love this place. If you want a home cooked meal go here. They cater to vegetarians too which i thought was very considerate considering the name of the place.

And it couldn't have been a better idea.Being new'ish to NYC, we were just looking to do some perusing through the neighborhood, so weren't trying to do the sit down thing. Well it was perfect..we sat at the bar, and all 3 just did our own sets of sliders. All of them were amazing, but my favorite was the chicken w/ parmesan sauce! Great texture for the meatball, nicely cooked, and were perfect in portion. They were just enough to tide us over until our next stop.

"My new absolute favorite spot in Williamsburg. The nicest wait staff, for small parties I have yet to experience much of a wait (even on the weekend) and the food is so good. It's loud and their portions are a bit on the small side, but damn it's filling. As a vegetarian, I still find there are plenty of options, all of which are delicious. Perfect place for a late night drink and bite to eat.",5.0
"What a freakin' awesome bar. MEATBALLS made to order with some unexpected options for sides and desserts. The cocktails are outstanding, and even though it's smack in the middle of Williamsburg, the bartenders aren't too hip to learn a new drink recipe from this Midwestern girl. There were a few regulars sitting near me at the bar, and their banter with the servers and other customers made the atmosphere even more comfortable and enjoyable. The simplicity of this concept restaurant is brilliant and inspired.",4.0
I was really expecting heaven when I came here. I mean... It's THE meatball shop. I think next time I would order differently. I ordered a hero on wheat but.. Did u ever eat a sandwich and it just felt so bready? It was just a lot of bread. I had the chicken ballz with Parmesan cream sauce. It was of course great. Next time id like to try out tue veg ballz! Friends said the sangria was poppin' and ice cream sandwich is rave worthy. Anyway... I'll be back.,3.0
absolutly love this place. If you want a home cooked meal go here. They cater to vegetarians too which i thought was very considerate considering the name of the place. Great food and amazing desserts. The ordering system is very unique. You can choose from a wide variety of selections using a wipe board type menu and marker. If you have any questions the waiters are happy to help.,5.0

"Simply amazing! Me, the girlfriend, & a friend stopped in here yesterday after just walking by and my girlfriend saying ""OH, meatballs!"" (for whatever reason, she's under the impression she's a meatball aficionado). But we figured what the hell. And it couldn't have been a better idea.Being new'ish to NYC, we were just looking to do some perusing through the neighborhood, so weren't trying to do the sit down thing. Well it was perfect..we sat at the bar, and all 3 just did our own sets of sliders. All of them were amazing, but my favorite was the chicken w/ parmesan sauce! Great texture for the meatball, nicely cooked, and were perfect in portion. They were just enough to tide us over until our next stop.

I loved the sauce and the balls were juicy, although super-dense. The DC had the spicy pork meatballs with classic tomato sauce. The pork meatballs had a softer, lighter consistency (NB: with your bill, there's a Meatball Shop postcard with the recipe -- tried it at home and it's pretty easy to recreate!).

"I have been to a number of the Meatball Shops across NYC and my recent experience at the Bedford Ave. location has me worrying that the chain might be experiencing issues with expansion. Usually the service from sitting down to food on your table is relatively quick, especially for someone who knows how the menu system works.I was with a group of six people and our waitress was on us for drinks before I had a chance to pick up my order pen. Fortunately someone in the group was quick to order a bottle of wine for the table. She disappeared and within a minute was back to collect our menus. Far too quickly for my taste, but I was able to mark my order quickly. For the next 20 minutes we waited for that bottle of wine however. When it finally came after prompting her, she claimed the delay was over all the wine glasses were in use, despite the restaurant being half-full on a Friday night. But I'll give her the pass on that issue.While our group chatted, another 30+ minutes went by and our food was still nowhere to be found. Again an inquiry to the waitress yielded a response that the kitchen was backed up, yet again, the restaurant remained half empty and I've been to other Meatball Shops that were crammed to the gills with people, yet food was prompt. She attempted a appease us by offering the table some bread. Yet as time passed, no bread.After another 10 minutes, our food finally arrived. However, a number of side dishes were noticeably absent, however, after speaking with the waitress, the lost dishes were quickly made and brought to us, along with the aforementioned bread, which turned out to be two extra pieces of their focaccia bread. Hardly enough for a group of six and far too late to be a meaningful gesture.While most food was as expected, the risotto was noticeably sub-par, approaching inedible. After a few people tasted we all agreed that someone had forgotten to include salt in the dish, leaving it tasting more of dry, tasteless, pile of starch than of a risotto. In the end, I'll likely go back to a different Meatball Shop, hoping that the service issues may only be a one-time fluke, but if they spread to other locations.

"Apparently meatballs are in. I have no issues with that.

I ended up chowing down on the beef meatballs with the spicy meat sauce--classics that this place does right. They have a fairly nice variety, including a vegetarian option for that one friend everyone has in New York. They've also got a special each night--that night was BBQ pork.

This place has the food, the music, the service, and the cool factor.I ordered my balls naked with the family jewels, which means I got my choice of meatballs, my choice of sauce, a piece of focaccia bread, and a fried egg. $8 for all that is not bad at all. I ended up chowing down on the beef meatballs with the spicy meat sauce--classics that this place does right. They have a fairly nice variety, including a vegetarian option for that one friend everyone has in New York. They've also got a special each night--that night was BBQ pork. You Â also have your balls over some potatoes, in a roll, on a salad, etc.There's plenty of indoor seating, but get there too late and expect a line at the door. There's also a bar where you can get your grub and drink on, but this place might be best enjoyed with friends at a table.All in all, this place is great. The idea is solid and the ambiance in the place is great. Prices are in everybody's budget, too. I can't say that the meatballs are the best thing I ever ate, but they're pretty damn good.",5.0

"A vegetarian giving a meatball shop 4 stars?!This Williamsburg location is chuckin' out the exact same goods as the LES locale.

No wait at any hour on a weekend is unheard of at the LES location so this is definitely a defining feature here!

"AlbÃ³ndigas I wish I could hear you all saying this word because it even sounds funny from a native Spanish speaker. It seems like easy jokes goes on the house which such a name/speciality: meatballs. Have you seen the ""Ball Jokes"" section on their web site? themeatballshop.com/indeâ¦ . No kidding. But I don't know. You people can think about guys and stuff, but honestly is all about grandma. The homey taste. I think its the first thing will cross everyone's mind ... ok, the second one for some maybe, but it is unquestionable that a comfy feeling comes up on your first bite. The texture. Firm yet juicy. Forget about being sloppy, undercook, overcook or like a stone in texture which I find common mistakes in other's. As for the sauces, those are key. Thick and creamy. Smooth and comforting. Savory and filling. You can find same quality balls in many other places but let me explain. Only in terms of execution and meat quality because the concept here is a brilliant idea and not many probably will offer this meatballs innovation and flavors profile on the sauces. Do one thing and do it the best. Once, I heard Adria explaining how he reach his creations. Simple yet genius. Choose one ingredient, only one, and think about how to change everything on it, under any perspective. Obviously, things are more simple here, there is not deconstruction, but the idea seems to be the same.Therefore I like the approach to the patron offering a customize menu. It seems short at first but if you spin around the balls enough there is not much chances to repeat same meal even for frequent visitors. Take the sharpie and mark on the menu, which meatball, with which sauce and which format: naked (4 balls) on a bun (1) on a baguette (3) or smashed (2) over a brioche. Now, coming back to the traditional? aspect. The size is by the grandma measurement. Those things are enormous and they gave you 4 per order when naked is chosen. Come on. Don't tell me the biggest food coma is not been when family gatherings...right? therefore 2 people can share 2 orders and left satisfied enough. Suffering from gluttony? up to you. 4 per person its a lot. A lot, even under those circumstances. You are warned. At $7 per dish for the naked ones I find it more than reasonable. We choose the spicy pork with pesto sauce and the special with mushroom gravy. Loved the light spicy hint. And the cheese on the sauces. On a side we opted for polenta and the risotto. And once again both were comfy taste, creamy, rich and delicious. Â On the fail side, our special meatballs I find it occasionally dry and I would have like less sauce over it. Since it was so delightful I was ok with that. There is also a wait, probably always. On a pouring Friday night in this location, 2 people waited 20 min to get a table. It clear up around 11pm. I was ok with that too. And if you catch seats on the bar, you keep them. The decor, using one of my faves quotes, is very Brooklyn. Its like taking the L train and somehow you automatically know is going to Willi. You know what I mean? Somehow it also resembles to me to a 1950's style. Like if the Mad Men crew were hanging here after work. But without the smoke. The wall filled with old machines to ground meat can be a little disturbing at first but look charming after a little bit. This loft industry style is surprisingly well organize and bigger that you think. The lighting made it cozy even being noisy and pack. The individual tables would need to be bigger and not as close each other but I was ok with that even when it made us to drop one of our forks three times. Three. But the service was outstanding. More things to like is that its right at the L train station and its open later serving food until 2 (weekdays) or 4 am (weekends). Maybe its not worth it to wait on the Manhattan location. If you haven't try it yet, you know you have to do it. I remember thinking, come on, this is just meatballs .. what is the whole thing about it? Well, its not just regular meatballs and it tells you how the most simple things can fairly become everyone's crush. And you know what?

"I really wanted to love The Meatball Shop. We were so excited about this experience we even waited for the L train for a long, stuffy and sticky 25 minutes without bailing (this is a big deal for two impatient new yorkers on a hot summer day). Forewarned by my fellow yelpers, we headed over around 5:15 p.m. for an early dinner to avoid the crowds. The restaurant had ample available seating and was charming. I loved the menu, which allows you to customize your meal and check off your order specifications. You'd think this method would prevent mistakes. Unfortunately, although I explicitly asked for my mashed potatoes on the side, they were served ""under"" my meatballs. So much for sharing them with boyfriend! The waitress apologized but made no effort to rectify the situation by offering me a complimentary side of mashed potatoes. I had the spicy pork meatball with the mushroom gravy. Both were quite tasty. I would've have appreciate a little more spice, though. Boyfriend had the beef meatball with classic tomato sauce and mozzarella on wheat bread sandwich. My stolen bite was bland. The meatball was wildly under-seasoned and had no punch to it. And then, to make matters worse--just as we were about to order dessert, a patron beside us found a grasshopper in his salad! The waiter promptly grabbed the plate, but the grasshopper fell onto the floor and remained there for the rest of the evening ... Awkward, much?We decided to stick it out for dessert since we had heard so much about the ice cream sandwiches. Boyfriend and I, however, hate hard cookies so we asked the waitress if the sandwich cookies were soft. She nodded and said ""Yes, absolutely. They're definitely soft."" Not only were the cookies hard, but the mint ice cream was just vanilla ice cream with bits of chopped mint--it was inedible. Given the bad service, issues with sanitation and somewhat bland flavors, we left feeling really disappointed and wishing the meatball shop had lived up to the hype.",2.0
"I can finally say this where it applies...HOLY BALLS! I am a fan. Obviously, since I visited this place twice while in New York. Not this particular location twice but still twice. This Meatball Shop is located in Williamsburg and if hipsters had an epicenter, Williamsburg would be it. And again, I'm not complaining. We were seated at the bar where a cute server with a little swag and another server with a whole lotta crack (as in butt crack) attended to us as they were cleaning up. The service was very attentive but if it wasn't that would just be outrageous seeing as how my friend and I were the last ones in this place, coming from a late night roaming around NYC. I ordered what I enjoyed at my first visit at the Lower East Side location which were the Spicy Pork Naked Balls with a Spicy Meat Sauce. Still delicious the second time around.

I loved the menu, which allows you to customize your meal and check off your order specifications. You'd think this method would prevent mistakes. Unfortunately, although I explicitly asked for my mashed potatoes on the side, they were served ""under"" my meatballs. So much for sharing them with boyfriend! The waitress apologized but made no effort to rectify the situation by offering me a complimentary side of mashed potatoes. I had the spicy pork meatball with the mushroom gravy. Both were quite tasty. I would've have appreciate a little more spice, though. Boyfriend had the beef meatball with classic tomato sauce and mozzarella on wheat bread sandwich. My stolen bite was bland. The meatball was wildly under-seasoned and had no punch to it. And then, to make matters worse--just as we were about to order dessert, a patron beside us found a grasshopper in his salad! The waiter promptly grabbed the plate, but the grasshopper fell onto the floor and remained there for the rest of the evening ... Awkward, much?We decided to stick it out for dessert since we had heard so much about the ice cream sandwiches. Boyfriend and I, however, hate hard cookies so we asked the waitress if the sandwich cookies were soft. She nodded and said ""Yes, absolutely. They're definitely soft."" Not only were the cookies hard, but the mint ice cream was just vanilla ice cream with bits of chopped mint--it was inedible. Given the bad service, issues with sanitation and somewhat bland flavors, we left feeling really disappointed and wishing the meatball shop had lived up to the hype.",2.0
"I can finally say this where it applies...HOLY BALLS! I am a fan. Obviously, since I visited this place twice while in New York. Not this particular location twice but still twice. This Meatball Shop is located in Williamsburg and if hipsters had an epicenter, Williamsburg would be it. And again, I'm not complaining. We were seated at the bar where a cute server with a little swag and another server with a whole lotta crack (as in butt crack) attended to us as they were cleaning up. The service was very attentive but if it wasn't that would just be outrageous seeing as how my friend and I were the last ones in this place, coming from a late night roaming around NYC. I ordered what I enjoyed at my first visit at the Lower East Side location which were the Spicy Pork Naked Balls with a Spicy Meat Sauce. Still delicious the second time around. I don't find many places that can make really good meatballs in LA so maybe that's what had me coming back for more.",4.0
Whiskey Floats made by the hands of angels .... or some dude at the bar. Â Pretty effin' delicious. Â The meatballs are awesome too. I'd suggest just trying a couple different ones (the slidders). Bon'appetite,5.0
"My roommate and I don't get sick eating anywhere but the Meatball Shop, and yet it happens every time we go. now at the point where I don't care if it's 1 AM on Monday and there's nowhere else to eat, I'm never coming here again.",1.0
I really loved this place. You need to go with plenty of time since there it's always a wait for a table.I had naked balls with Parmesan cheese and risotto on the site and everything was so delicious. You need to try the Fool Aid which is grape Kool Aid with different types of liquor,5.0
"I love this place. Â The Meatball Shop is great pretty much any time of the day.I think their menu is really clever and I like the way that they let you mix and match what you want. Â The service is always nice, but on popular nights (i.e. Friday, Saturday) be prepared to wait. Â Because this place is awesome, it's often packed for dinner. Â I've been here for brunch and the wait wasn't bad.I'll definitely be coming back!",4.0
"I came back! I still dont love EVERYTHING on the menu but i like that there is something for everyone. When i last dined here I tried the smash and I was sorely disappointed. A mush sandwich with mush innards. Not the mouth feel i was going for. So when i came back this time around I decided to stick with what worked from me and go from there. The Naked Balls are definitely the way to go for me. You choose the meat you like (beef, spicy pork, chicken, veggie, or special) followed by the sauce to cover the balls (tomato, spicy tomato, mushroom, parmesan, or the special sauce) and then you choose a side. I wanted to be different and get something other than the spicy pork and spicy sauce but that fear that I would not like it gnawed on me. The beauty here is the slider option! I really wanted to try the chicken meatballs with the mushroom sauce so i got it on a slider. I didnt love it. Back to the naked balls. The beef meatball with spicy sauce is now my favorite combination. That plus a side of their creamy polenta and Im in comfort food heaven. For a seriously cozy experience, i got the balls on top of the polenta and i loved it. I spied a meatball hero and if you are a big eater- this baby is hefty! and it comes with a salad. The best part is that its not a mush fest! Bon Apetit!I was here around 6pm on a weekday and it was relatively empty.

We finally made it to a Meatball Shop! Place is very cool but a little heavy on the typical Burg hipsters. Service was very good and food came out quickly.

"My two stars are based on the type of service I received. Â Even though I had a delicious ice cream sandwich, the service was so bad that I'm writing a review a week later after thinking about the bad experience. To start off, me and a group of friends dropped in around 11 pm to get some desserts and drinks. We weren't even approached by our server until we looked around and realized he was serving other people but not us. ( Our server was Thomas btw, and yeah, I'm putting u on blast because coming from a person who works in the service industry, your service was horrendous). Even after we flagged him down, he approached us with a bad attitude. He didn't explain the menu, or ask if we had any questions. Before we even finished our drinks, he dropped the checks on the table ( mind you, he didn't ask if we wanted anything else, nor was there a line at the door, nor was the restaurant near closing). We were actually trying to flag him down because we wanted to order more shots, literally yelling for his attention at this point, and he blatantly ignored us. Just nasty! Had this attitude like "" I already made enough money, why bother over a few extra dollars"". Again, I'm not trying to crap on the whole restaurant. The restaurant had a nice vibe and their desserts were amazing. And if their meatball reflect the quality of the desserts then ur definitely in good hands. Hopefully the rest of the staff does not mirror the service of this gentlemen.",2.0
"Amazing meatballs! Being Swedish I know my balls of meat, this was something else. I had the spicy pork and sautÃ©d broccoli with a mushroom sauce and I was in heaven. The meatball was cooked just right which made it juicy and fullOf flavour. The sauce went well with it and the broccoli had a little sting to them. Great service and a relaxing atmosphere makes this place a five star establishment.",5.0
"After a ton of friends hyping this spot up to me, I was not one bit disappointed. This place is super tasty. I can and will say the best meatball mini sandwiches that I've ever had in my life. Yeah this is the spot you want to kick it at for a perfectly made cocktail and some super bomb grub.We tried about 6 different types of meatballs and all had a different type of taste, but all leaving you saying WOW. The simple salad was on point also. So I had this taste for Jameson but had no clue on what to drink, so our waiter/server/bartender made me his special drink and it was mind blowing. Â Then we switched it up to the watermelon margarita and it was just what the doctor ordered.Our whole experience at the meatball shop was mad awesome.

"I hate to do this. Look at my record - I'm a positive reviewer! But the meatball shop sucked a big one this time, and I need to finally reveal this. I want to love the meatball shop SO BADLY. it is always my first suggestion when brainstorming dinner spots (ALWAYS shot down....should have seen that as a warning....) and I can so easily get a meatball boner super fast. That's the thing, you eat there once and it's like, zoing! The slightest scent in the air and you're dripping (from your mouth, sicko) for more balls! So I dragged my boyfriend there the other night, finally, and was sadly not surprised to receive the same embarrassingly shitty service as the last (and only!) time I was there. (Those people will not got back with me!) It's like not even halfway through the meal and you completely lose your server. I noticed that both tables next to us managed to be seated twice while we were there, though they had a random array of servers as well? This made me feel very confused and extra shafted.So many things on our order were wrong, but that doesn't even bother me! But having to leave our table after 20 minutes to get a waiter's attention was the worst. It honestly felt like once one server realized something was wrong with our order, they all avoided us for the rest of the evening. It was uncomfortable and awful and the worst part is that now my boyfriend will never go back there with me!!Meatball shop, I want to love you SO BADLY. You have so much going for you. If my boyfriend finishes his meal before a server looks at me long enough to relate to them that my meal is incorrect, something is wrong. When things are this wrong, you should fix it. Â A simple cookie would have done the trick. But instead we sat for another almost half an hour before we went up to the register and got our bill ourselves. I worked at a restaurant in Times Square....I know how much it can suck....but when you mess you, you own up. I just want you. You make it so damn difficult. It's annoying.",2.0
"Wholey guacamole! My friend and I came here on a whim since Sweet Chick was closed today and it was so close to The Meatball Shop. The ambiance is very friendly and the music is quite on point according to my friend. We went in, sat at 2 seats by the bar. The bartender was super nice, asked us what drinks we wanted and was really approachable. He asked us if it was our first time here and when we answered yes, he tried to strike a conversation with us which was great! I love the small talk but we also ended up getting some jello shots which were amaze-balls! It's been years since I've taken Jello shots but it brought back some really good memories. Â The menu is super simple and their kitchen is pretty small. They make the food basically in front of you with their meatballs of many varieties. Their special meatball of the day was a venison, veal, and some other meat mixed with a cumberland sauce. When I heard venison and veal, my mind was blown and I knew that I absolutely had to order this hopefully juicy delight. All you had to do was check a bunch of things off on a laminated menu and hand it off to them to do their magic and 15 minutes later, a plate and bowl of magical goodness shows up in your face! You can also order sides for $5 extra and I ended up getting a market salad along with 4 meatballs and bread. The meatballs were just what I expected and hoped and dreamed it would be.

"My two stars are based on the type of service I received. Â Even though I had a delicious ice cream sandwich, the service was so bad that I'm writing a review a week later after thinking about the bad experience. To start off, me and a group of friends dropped in around 11 pm to get some desserts and drinks. We weren't even approached by our server until we looked around and realized he was serving other people but not us. ( Our server was Thomas btw, and yeah, I'm putting u on blast because coming from a person who works in the service industry, your service was horrendous). Even after we flagged him down, he approached us with a bad attitude. He didn't explain the menu, or ask if we had any questions. Before we even finished our drinks, he dropped the checks on the table ( mind you, he didn't ask if we wanted anything else, nor was there a line at the door, nor was the restaurant near closing). We were actually trying to flag him down because we wanted to order more shots, literally yelling for his attention at this point, and he blatantly ignored us. Just nasty! Had this attitude like "" I already made enough money, why bother over a few extra dollars"". Again, I'm not trying to crap on the whole restaurant. The restaurant had a nice vibe and their desserts were amazing. And if their meatball reflect the quality of the desserts then ur definitely in good hands. Hopefully the rest of the staff does not mirror the service of this gentlemen.",2.0
"Amazing meatballs! Being Swedish I know my balls of meat, this was something else. I had the spicy pork and sautÃ©d broccoli with a mushroom sauce and I was in heaven. The meatball was cooked just right which made it juicy and fullOf flavour. The sauce went well with it and the broccoli had a little sting to them. Great service and a relaxing atmosphere makes this place a five star establishment.",5.0
"After a ton of friends hyping this spot up to me, I was not one bit disappointed. This place is super tasty. I can and will say the best meatball mini sandwiches that I've ever had in my life. Yeah this is the spot you want to kick it at for a perfectly made cocktail and some super bomb grub.We tried about 6 different types of meatballs and all had a different type of taste, but all leaving you saying WOW. The simple salad was on point also. So I had this taste for Jameson but had no clue on what to drink, so our waiter/server/bartender made me his special drink and it was mind blowing. Â Then we switched it up to the watermelon margarita and it was just what the doctor ordered.Our whole experience at the meatball shop was mad awesome. Â Best service Best MeatballsBest adult cocktailsIt's your best choice!",5.0
"I hate to do this. Look at my record - I'm a positive reviewer! But the meatball shop sucked a big one this time, and I need to finally reveal this. I want to love the meatball shop SO BADLY. it is always my first suggestion when brainstorming dinner spots (ALWAYS shot down....should have seen that as a warning....) and I can so easily get a meatball boner super fast. That's the thing, you eat there once and it's like, zoing! The slightest scent in the air and you're dripping (from your mouth, sicko) for more balls! So I dragged my boyfriend there the other night, finally, and was sadly not surprised to receive the same embarrassingly shitty service as the last (and only!) time I was there. (Those people will not got back with me!) It's like not even halfway through the meal and you completely lose your server. I noticed that both tables next to us managed to be seated twice while we were there, though they had a random array of servers as well? This made me feel very confused and extra shafted.So many things on our order were wrong, but that doesn't even bother me! But having to leave our table after 20 minutes to get a waiter's attention was the worst. It honestly felt like once one server realized something was wrong with our order, they all avoided us for the rest of the evening. It was uncomfortable and awful and the worst part is that now my boyfriend will never go back there with me!!Meatball shop, I want to love you SO BADLY. You have so much going for you. If my boyfriend finishes his meal before a server looks at me long enough to relate to them that my meal is incorrect, something is wrong. When things are this wrong, you should fix it. Â A simple cookie would have done the trick. But instead we sat for another almost half an hour before we went up to the register and got our bill ourselves. I worked at a restaurant in Times Square....I know how much it can suck....but when you mess you, you own up. I just want you. You make it so damn difficult. It's annoying.",2.0
"Wholey guacamole! My friend and I came here on a whim since Sweet Chick was closed today and it was so close to The Meatball Shop. The ambiance is very friendly and the music is quite on point according to my friend. We went in, sat at 2 seats by the bar. The bartender was super nice, asked us what drinks we wanted and was really approachable. He asked us if it was our first time here and when we answered yes, he tried to strike a conversation with us which was great! I love the small talk but we also ended up getting some jello shots which were amaze-balls! It's been years since I've taken Jello shots but it brought back some really good memories. Â The menu is super simple and their kitchen is pretty small. They make the food basically in front of you with their meatballs of many varieties. Their special meatball of the day was a venison, veal, and some other meat mixed with a cumberland sauce. When I heard venison and veal, my mind was blown and I knew that I absolutely had to order this hopefully juicy delight. All you had to do was check a bunch of things off on a laminated menu and hand it off to them to do their magic and 15 minutes later, a plate and bowl of magical goodness shows up in your face! You can also order sides for $5 extra and I ended up getting a market salad along with 4 meatballs and bread. The meatballs were just what I expected and hoped and dreamed it would be.

"I had a great lunch here with the husband. I love that you can pick your meatball type and sauce separately and then get sides either in the same bowl or separately.

The meatballs were pretty good but not as good as I was expecting. They had a nice variation. I had the beef with spicy meat sauce and spicy pork with tomato sauce sliders.

I was excited after finding out they were opening an NYC location in my hood, but after all the fanfare, it's doesn't seem to worth the wait. That's not to see it's not a good place to get your meatball on. It is. You go in, you check off your requested balls and accompanying sauce and sides on their menu and your food comes out super quickly.

Personally, I like to sit at the bar and enjoy easy chit chat with a round of drinks while doodling on the cute dry erase menus but also would like to check out the back garden, looks like it would be a good spot for a loud group.

This dish wins second place in my heart, and is exactly what you think it may be. A brilliant chefs choice mish-mosh of greenmarket veggies & salad, with your choice of balls. The special market salads and sides are always fantastic, but the ice cream sandwich specials are really what did it for me.

"Based on service alone.Unfortunately, sometimes places that may have a solid reputation in great and simple food Â may lack in service. I was with a party of 3. I was there on a early friday night and decided to check this place out in my beloved Williamsburg instead of the lower east side. Seated right away by the bartender/ waiter and never saw him again. 2 of our glasses were dirty, 1 with lipstick, which was not a big deal. However no one ever came to check up our table after we were finally served with food. It's a fun messy meatball sandwich with a fried egg and we needed napkins! We asked a random waitress for a napkins and she hangs us the napkin right next to our table. It appears that no one was assigned to our table and we kept waiting and waiting and asked random servers for things ... Such as napkins, dessert menu, check .... Ironically the tables around received better service than us , which leaves me puzzled why???The food lived up to the hype!!!

All in all, it was worth it.After the first meal, I got meatballed out but now that I've had a long break, I'm ready to return even if there is a wait.",4.0

"Based on service alone.Unfortunately, sometimes places that may have a solid reputation in great and simple food Â may lack in service. I was with a party of 3. I was there on a early friday night and decided to check this place out in my beloved Williamsburg instead of the lower east side. Seated right away by the bartender/ waiter and never saw him again. 2 of our glasses were dirty, 1 with lipstick, which was not a big deal. However no one ever came to check up our table after we were finally served with food. It's a fun messy meatball sandwich with a fried egg and we needed napkins! We asked a random waitress for a napkins and she hangs us the napkin right next to our table. It appears that no one was assigned to our table and we kept waiting and waiting and asked random servers for things ... Such as napkins, dessert menu, check .... Ironically the tables around received better service than us , which leaves me puzzled why???The food lived up to the hype!!! Love my snicker noodle ice cream sandwich. 4 stars for food I love food and I am sure I can great food anywhere in NY with better service. It's NY so that should not be hard!",2.0
Some of the best meatballs around town. Suggest you try out all the meatballs and sauces.,5.0
"I love the concept of the menu. You are given a marker and the menu and you check your type of meatball and sauce and how you would like it naked, hero, salad, etc. I came on a late Friday afternoon. It was crowded but we were able to get a table for two in the back. I got the naked beef meatballs and spicy tomato sauce along with a side of vegetables and a glass of their house white peach sangria. The meatballs and sauce were delicous.I will definitely be back to explore different meatball and sauce combinations. I also highly recommend saving room for dessert. The ice cream sandwich is the same kind of concept, pick your type of cream and cookie and it was so good!",4.0
"Put our names down, was told 10-15 minute wait. Got the text message saying we were on the list.

"I visited this place with a few friends on a trip to NYC and was so pleasantly surprised that it killed me. The food was delicious, the service was great, and it was amazingly reasonably priced. LOVE IT, and wish that we had something similar in Vancouver. I am also going to make a few recommendations about this place:(1) you can either order 4 meatballs with a piece of focaccia (regular way to order their meatballs), or you can order a ""meatball smash"", which is two meatballs on a brioche bun with a bunch of greens on the side. ORDER THE MEATBALL SMASH. Â (2) There is also a large selection of sides available ORDER THE MASHED POTATOES. They are pure heaven. I also ordered the broccoli, which was good, and if you want more veggies and are sharing with someone, those two side might be awesome. Ordering more than one side for one person would be way too much food. (3) Lastly, get an icecream sandwich. Just do it. You will be so full at the end of the meal that you will want to die, but they are absolutely wonderful. You get to make your own selection of cookies (or different cookies for each side) as well as your icecream flavour. The day I was there, the flavour of the day was creme fraiche. HOLY SHIT, ARE YOU KIDDING ME?! So good.They also have a jello shooter of the day, which is hilarious and kind of awesome.",5.0
"Love the ambiance and overall feel of this place -- laid back and casual. Had the spicy pork meatballs with tomato sauce and a side of rigatoni with parm cream sauce.

I could've made a meal out of a large order of just the rigatoni with parm cream sauce. A little pricey for the size of the portions. Worth trying just to give the Meatball Shop a try.",3.0

"Mushroom sauce, spicy meatball, provolone on a hero. JUST DO IT. And if you're debating between a hero/slider and the ""everything but the kitchen sink salad"", always go for the carby option.

"What a bust! I'd heard only good things about the Meatball shop and was super excited to check it out. What is the deal with all the raving Yelpers? Have none of you ever had a good meatball before? I'm going to put it out there - if you're thinking about going to The Meatball shop, save yourself the $8 and shoot me a message instead - I'll make you a great meatball and only charge you $5. But seriously - these were the most underwhelming meatballs that I've ever had. For one, one of my meatballs had a bone, or a stick, or something, in it. That was kind of gross but I guess that's the risk you run when you're grinding your own meat, and you gotta give respect for them grinding their own meat. Unless they weren't, in which case this is just horrible. Meatballs, when properly done, can be one of the most wonderful expressions of meat out there. You can have a great depth of flavors in one little ball, with the perfect texture, and firmness. It can be a real joy. On the other hand, a meatball can be a bunch of ground meat that tastes like it's just a ball of meat, with little much else for flavor and is either too chewy or kind of mealy. The meatball shop definitely errs on the side of blah. Couple this with their completely unexciting sauce and you've got yourself a real bummer.",2.0
The concept of a meatball sounds so simple YET I made it a point to return here again. I am obsessed with The Meatball Shop. My friend brought me here and explained how to order and build your plate. Anytime I see Polenta and Kale on the menu I am sold. This place is amazing and I did not get sick of it. In fact I had it twice while I was on holiday and picked up an order to go for dinner at home. If you like crafted cocktails then come here.. They have a small bar but the drinks are impressive.

"I visited this place with a few friends on a trip to NYC and was so pleasantly surprised that it killed me. The food was delicious, the service was great, and it was amazingly reasonably priced. LOVE IT, and wish that we had something similar in Vancouver. I am also going to make a few recommendations about this place:(1) you can either order 4 meatballs with a piece of focaccia (regular way to order their meatballs), or you can order a ""meatball smash"", which is two meatballs on a brioche bun with a bunch of greens on the side. ORDER THE MEATBALL SMASH. Â (2) There is also a large selection of sides available ORDER THE MASHED POTATOES. They are pure heaven. I also ordered the broccoli, which was good, and if you want more veggies and are sharing with someone, those two side might be awesome. Ordering more than one side for one person would be way too much food. (3) Lastly, get an icecream sandwich. Just do it. You will be so full at the end of the meal that you will want to die, but they are absolutely wonderful. You get to make your own selection of cookies (or different cookies for each side) as well as your icecream flavour. The day I was there, the flavour of the day was creme fraiche. HOLY SHIT, ARE YOU KIDDING ME?! So good.They also have a jello shooter of the day, which is hilarious and kind of awesome.",5.0
"Love the ambiance and overall feel of this place -- laid back and casual. Had the spicy pork meatballs with tomato sauce and a side of rigatoni with parm cream sauce. The meatballs were just ok, but maybe I had too high of expectations to have my mind blown. The rigatoni with parm cream sauce was REALLY good, though. I could've made a meal out of a large order of just the rigatoni with parm cream sauce. A little pricey for the size of the portions. Worth trying just to give the Meatball Shop a try.",3.0
This is my favorite meatballs in the world :) experiencing this during my vacation in NYC was the best thing that ever happen. I love how they are open late at night and you can easily stroll in after getting out of the bars.,5.0
"Mushroom sauce, spicy meatball, provolone on a hero. JUST DO IT. And if you're debating between a hero/slider and the ""everything but the kitchen sink salad"", always go for the carby option. The salad seems like a good idea (I mean, it's got greenmarket veggies and is less likely to clog your arteries!) but it will ultimately be supremely unsatisfying when you see the guy sitting next to you eating an aromatic cheese-loaded baguette stuffed with balls of deliciousness.(Also, this is probably to most incredible drunk food you can find in the LES. Re: Just do it.)",4.0
"This place specializes in meatballs, go/come and order meatballs. Â This location is much more spacious and much less busy, or at least it seems that way due to the increased space, as compared to the Manhattan location. There are a lot of things on a the menu, but don't pass up on the meatballs. They even have veggie meatballs, so your annoying vegan/vegetarian friends can't complain about how they don't want to eat the charred and burnt flesh of a cute puppy or whatever. I almost always get the special meatball when I go there, I've plowed through all the regulars, the spicy pork is my favorite (that's a reg. not a special). The last time I was there, they had pizza meatballs. They got meatballs. You want meatballs, go get meatballs. Meatballs.",5.0
"Good experience. I came in on a wednesday night (before thanksgiving) and was surprised to see there was a decent sized crowd. Didn't take long for us to be seated or to have a waiter approach us looking at the menu which are two things I pay close attention to anywhere I go. I ordered a spicy meatball sandwich. I can't remember if it were pork or not. Nevertheless it was pretty good and it did include a side of salad. I definitely would come back here and recommend it to friends. The decor is typical Williamsburg, and the music was great! I'm not giving 5 stars because I didn't feel like it was a memorable experience.. Just a good night out.",4.0

"What a bust! I'd heard only good things about the Meatball shop and was super excited to check it out. What is the deal with all the raving Yelpers? Have none of you ever had a good meatball before? I'm going to put it out there - if you're thinking about going to The Meatball shop, save yourself the $8 and shoot me a message instead - I'll make you a great meatball and only charge you $5. But seriously - these were the most underwhelming meatballs that I've ever had. For one, one of my meatballs had a bone, or a stick, or something, in it. That was kind of gross but I guess that's the risk you run when you're grinding your own meat, and you gotta give respect for them grinding their own meat. Unless they weren't, in which case this is just horrible. Meatballs, when properly done, can be one of the most wonderful expressions of meat out there. You can have a great depth of flavors in one little ball, with the perfect texture, and firmness. It can be a real joy. On the other hand, a meatball can be a bunch of ground meat that tastes like it's just a ball of meat, with little much else for flavor and is either too chewy or kind of mealy. The meatball shop definitely errs on the side of blah. Couple this with their completely unexciting sauce and you've got yourself a real bummer.",2.0
The concept of a meatball sounds so simple YET I made it a point to return here again. I am obsessed with The Meatball Shop. My friend brought me here and explained how to order and build your plate. Anytime I see Polenta and Kale on the menu I am sold. This place is amazing and I did not get sick of it. In fact I had it twice while I was on holiday and picked up an order to go for dinner at home. If you like crafted cocktails then come here.. They have a small bar but the drinks are impressive. Possibly the best Old Fashion that I have had in a while and extra kudos for carrying Yamasaki..

Visited this place for the first time last week and i was so pleasantly surprised. I'm usually not a fan of meatballs at restaurants but I loved them.

Our waitress, Jennette, never apologized for her negligence, tell us the specials of the day, give us utensils, or check to see if the meal was OK. We asked the busboy (who should have been our waiter because he was attentive as hell) for the check. How long did it take for the waitress to return with our check? Oh, that took another 10 minutes.

"Five stars for the food, negative two stars for the horrible hostess.My friend planned her birthday party here (a whole month before hand, by the way) Food was paid in advance for eight people. We had the pork, chicken and beef meat balls. With BBQ, classic, spicy and parmesan sauce. Yummmmm the meat balls and each sauce tasted soooo good. We also had roasted parsnips, arugula salad, and rigatoni pasta, which equally satiated my hunger. Â The sangria was amazing, while the harvey wallbanger jello shots were a pass for me. We ended the dinner with a chocolate chip cookie with mint ice cream; the ice cream tasted like fresh mint which was so refreshing after having such a heavy meal.So why do you ask is the rating three stars? As I had mentioned, my friend planned her birthday a month in advance. Our reservation was for 8pm, when we got there the hostess said it would be a 5 minute wait. After 10 minutes, she said it would be another 5 minutes. By 8:20 the hostess finally admitted that they had seated a 4 person party at a 8 person table and was waiting for them to leave to seat us. If you had reservations set at 8 pm, why would you seat someone without mentioning ""we can seat you but you need to be out by 8 for a reservations""? Meanwhile, the hostess kept walking away from her post so NO ONE was getting seated. by 8:40 my friend the (birthday girl) was upset; so much so that she wanted to leave but we had already prepaid for the dinner since we had such a large party. Â If we were told we would be waiting so long we would've atleast sat at the bar and had a drink.

Â She asked me what I wanted & I told her I wanted what I originally ordered & she told me that if I was getting the spicy meat sauce I should get the pork meat balls. (Insert a long string of profanities here) (#&$%(&*@$!!Why wouldn't you just let me order what I wanted crazy lady? Â The meatball I wanted had pork in it anyway. Â I saw her return the plate to the chefs & she told them I didn't like it without explaining that it was her forced suggestion.She was creepy as well. Â She would pass by & stare at our plates & waddle away a few times. Â When she asked if we were ordering dessert I told her we weren't & she said with her annoying voice ""So that's a negative?"" Â Her strangely negative reiterations of what we were saying were completely unnecessary. Â I don't really want to know what it is like inside of an inconsiderate looney.An important factor in this situation is that she had asked us if we had been to The Meatball Shop before. Â We answered ""Yes."" Â We didn't ask for suggestions & we had been there before. Â I don't understand why she was trying to change my order twice. Â She wasn't even making suggestions. Â She was actually just acting like she knew better & I should do what she told me to do. Â I honestly wonder how this woman got hired because I cannot see the slightest trait in her that could be likable.I'm not trying to be mean, but honest because I want to save anyone from having such an unpleasant experience ingrained in their mind. Â Avoid this waitress at all costs!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",3.0
"Perfect casual spot for under 10 dollar meals. Â I tried the spicy pork meatballs with mushroom gravy on a bed of arugula salad and assorted veggies which were tasty, albeit a bit oversalted. I felt adventurous so I tried the spicy mint lemonade (just so-so, and I could skip it next time). Â Nice enough ambience so that cheap dates could conceivably bring their dates without being embarassed.",4.0
"A place that specializes in making balls of meat? Sold. You can choose from a meatball sandwich, salad, or entree. As an entree, you select the type of meatball, the sauce, and add a side ($4 each). I got 4 spicy pork meatballs in mushroom gravy over a bed of risotto. Not very spicy but they were good, though I would've preferred the risotto a bit softer. My boyfriend's pick of beef meatballs in a parmesan cream sauce on rigatoni was the clear winner of the night. The sauce makes the meal a filling one, and the prices aren't bad. Can't wait to try all the other combinations.",4.0

"Twice in two days = Love at first Bite! The Meatball Shop has a great concept / affordable comfort food / in a truly inviting environment!

Off we went to the Meatball Shop and I fell in love! The way the menu is presented - your choices / your plate. Simple and personable. Five meats (well, one of the choices is vegan - so proper) / five sauces - put an X on the grid and voila! - no more than 20 minutes later you have your own personalized meatball plate! The same goes, by the way with the sliders and even the cocktails - choose gin, vodka, prosecco,rum and then four choices of fabulous spices - one feels like a mixologist in the making! I chose a Prosecco with Lavender and was not disappointed.

"You know, I'm always pretty hungry. I'm a fan of your usual run of the mill, big meals like cheeseburgers and fried chicken and such. I never really got into all these hip, specialized places popping up all over the place. Well, my girlfriend and I gave The Meatball Shop a shot after she started a list of all the best pesto places in NYC without having any idea that we were actually inside one of the city's most popular eateries.First off, this is a type of place where you pick every single thing that's going to appear on your plate. You pick what kind of meatball, what kind of sauce, what kind of side, right down to where the dudes in the kitchen will pit your meatball on. I had a traditional beef meatball with a mushroom sauce and some risotto on the side. Two small bowls of food barely the side of your hand but wow, does it fill you up. The meatballs were so flavorful and juicy. I think I was little embarrassed that I scarfed down four of them like a vacuum. Really, the small portions of this place doesn't matter because it will fill you up with how good those pieces are. Although I saw a guy get a hero sandwich and that was pretty huge so there's that.We also had some pretty great and tangy lemonade which I guess changes every night. Some nights they have grapefruit lemonade, some nights others. Refreshing stuff. Awesome touch.Now here's the killer. They have a pretty mouth-watering ice cream sandwich menu. Keeping true to the you-pick-everything format of the place, we got to pick what kind of cookie and ice cream our desert will be made with. I ordered a brownie walnut cookie with vanilla ice cream and HOLY JESUS. It was so delicious that I almost wish I didn't eat so many meatballs. PRO TIP: Leave room for the ice cream sandwich because it's as big a star in this place as the meatballs. The one drawback is that this places is ALWAYS full, I heard. Sometimes, it's over an hour wait. If you're planning to have dinner here, do it at an odd later time or early like 5-6pm.",5.0

The only issue I have with the meatball shop is them calling their gravy ""mushroom gravy"". Â Once my waiter saw that I ordered veggie balls he told me that the ""mushroom gravy"" included chicken stock and therefore wasn't vegetarian.

Constructing your meal is always a lot of fun; no one had the same permutation of balls/bread/starch/veg. My usual MO is to order the spicy pork balls, which did not disappoint - spicy, juicy, tender, meaty. Just the way I like my balls. I got them naked, smothered in pesto, which was actually quite mild but fresh and rustic. Lots of basil and pine nuts, not too much garlic or oil - all of this goodness was on top of rigatoni. Â Oh, and I gilded the lily with some family jewels, aka a fried egg. My meal was perfect; the pesto compliments the spice and fat of the pork quite nicely. I also ordered the veg of the day, the roasted squash with orange zest and breadcrumbs, and it was nicely done. My ice cream sandwich was a delicious gingerbread/brown sugar ice cream concoction.

"I have friends over from out of town and they wanted to go to Williamsburg. I've never been there before but luckily my co-worker lives there. So I asked him what were nice places to go to nd he told me about this place. Intrigued by the 'meatballs with different sauces served in different ways menu, I decided to bring my friends there. Â The restaurant was easy to find since we were walking across the street. We were lucky enough to get seats outside, so we could enjoy the fresh air and Williamsburg's uniqueness. The waiter gave us the menus right away and was helpful in suggesting the good stuff, but when he left us to decide what we were gonna get, he didn't come back to get our orders at all. My friend had to go inside and call the waiters attention - that was turn off #1. So finally we tell him what we want and waited for the food. We kept talking so we didn't really notice that 20 minutes has passed and we still didn't have our food. Plus, we were there at 8ish on a TUESDAY night. Anyway, when the food came, we enjoyed EVERYTHiNG. We got the spicy meatballs with mushroom gravy and spaghetti, the chicken slider with parmesan cheese, and the smashed beef sandwich with pesto. The food was amazing!!! But then, we realized that we forgot to order drinks! (we were all hungry and excited for the food.) So before the waiter left, we asked for some soda. He nodded and repeated our order and disappeared into the restaurant. We were halfway through our meal and still no drinks. :( also, we wanted to get more sliders so we tried to catch the waiters attention but he prolly didn't see us Â after like 5-8 mins of trying to catch the waiters attention, he came to our table and we asked for our drinks again and asked how long the sliders would take if we wanted to order more - guess what he said? He shrugged and said 'i don't know how long its gonna take.' tsk tsk. Anyway, so we asked for our drinks again and he said he'd be right back with them. unfortunately, our drinks arrived after the meal. It felt more like we had soda for dessert. So as soon as he served the drinks, we asked for our bill and the waiter was back in 2 minutes! Wow, if only the delivery of food and drinks was that fast. After giving us the bill, instead of waiting for us to pay, he left again! And we had to wait another 10 minutes and ended up giving our payment to some other waiter. So yeah, I'd give the food 5 stars but the service could've been so much better. I'm definitely coming back though. :)",3.0
"Let me be clear, I love the meatball shop in West Village and Lower East Side. The food is amazing, the service is friendly, and everyone working there is very aware that they are wearing flannel and bandanas in the town that will sentence someone to death for wearing the wrong shoes. Their location in Brooklyn (Brooklyn being a place where flannel and bandanas was born) is terrible and disappointing. I hate long yelp reviews so here's why it sucks in list form:1. Consistently, repeatedly mess up takeout orders and act like it's your fault. About nine times theyve taken my order, not given me part of it, and after I checked and asked for my side of noodles they charge me for it and say I never ordered it. But I did. It's happened nine times so yeah, I did. 2. Their mushroom gravy is soupy and they pour it over the balls and noodles and it's DISGUSTING. 3. The service people are beautiful, but assholes. I forgive them for this because it's not that original to be both beautiful and asshole. 4. They have a B rating. 5. It's just not as fun as the Lower East Sides.

My friend had to go inside and call the waiters attention - that was turn off #1. So finally we tell him what we want and waited for the food. We kept talking so we didn't really notice that 20 minutes has passed and we still didn't have our food. Plus, we were there at 8ish on a TUESDAY night. Anyway, when the food came, we enjoyed EVERYTHiNG. We got the spicy meatballs with mushroom gravy and spaghetti, the chicken slider with parmesan cheese, and the smashed beef sandwich with pesto. The food was amazing!!! But then, we realized that we forgot to order drinks! (we were all hungry and excited for the food.) So before the waiter left, we asked for some soda. He nodded and repeated our order and disappeared into the restaurant. We were halfway through our meal and still no drinks. :( also, we wanted to get more sliders so we tried to catch the waiters attention but he prolly didn't see us Â after like 5-8 mins of trying to catch the waiters attention, he came to our table and we asked for our drinks again and asked how long the sliders would take if we wanted to order more - guess what he said? He shrugged and said 'i don't know how long its gonna take.' tsk tsk. Anyway, so we asked for our drinks again and he said he'd be right back with them. unfortunately, our drinks arrived after the meal. It felt more like we had soda for dessert. So as soon as he served the drinks, we asked for our bill and the waiter was back in 2 minutes! Wow, if only the delivery of food and drinks was that fast. After giving us the bill, instead of waiting for us to pay, he left again! And we had to wait another 10 minutes and ended up giving our payment to some other waiter. So yeah, I'd give the food 5 stars but the service could've been so much better. I'm definitely coming back though. :)",3.0
"Let me be clear, I love the meatball shop in West Village and Lower East Side. The food is amazing, the service is friendly, and everyone working there is very aware that they are wearing flannel and bandanas in the town that will sentence someone to death for wearing the wrong shoes. Their location in Brooklyn (Brooklyn being a place where flannel and bandanas was born) is terrible and disappointing. I hate long yelp reviews so here's why it sucks in list form:1. Consistently, repeatedly mess up takeout orders and act like it's your fault. About nine times theyve taken my order, not given me part of it, and after I checked and asked for my side of noodles they charge me for it and say I never ordered it. But I did. It's happened nine times so yeah, I did. 2. Their mushroom gravy is soupy and they pour it over the balls and noodles and it's DISGUSTING. 3. The service people are beautiful, but assholes. I forgive them for this because it's not that original to be both beautiful and asshole. 4. They have a B rating. 5. It's just not as fun as the Lower East Sides. I always forget how awful these people are and then I order from them again. I made myself come on here and write about this because I had to remember!",2.0
"I love this place!! I come here at least once a week. I love coming on Friday/Saturday evenings..the music and crowd is always good! No complaints at all... good food, good prices. Â oh and you HAVE to try their turkey meatball special..it is the best!!",4.0
"This place has such a variety for only serving one specialty: MEATBALLS. Â You can get classic balls, beef, pork, chicken, and veggie!Many gluten free, vegetarian, or vegan options.You can make it a very hearty meal, by getting the meatballs on top of risotto with a side of bread, or you can get three naked balls and the daily trees. Â If you feel up to it, don't leave without eating one of the ice cream sandwiches!",5.0
I had the classic meatballs with spicy tomato sauce. They come 4 in a bowl. Delicious!!! The music is fun. Mostly hip hop while we were there. Waiters were friendly! We were there at about 3:30 on a Saturday and the wait was about 15 mins. Â  Will definitely return.,4.0
Horrible people!!!!! Waitress comes outside fighting for a Tip after we already paid a 20% gratuity!!! Just te worse service ever' and horrible horrible people' don't recommend it and wil never come back again!!!!,1.0

"I've been to their LES and West Village locations several times each and enjoyed them, so after moving to Williamsburg I figured their Bedford location would be a safe bet for a good late afternoon lunch. Whoops--wrong.Service was lackluster at best: though my food came quickly, no one bothered to refill my water or ask about my food. Given that it was only 4pm (hardly peak hour) and they're well staffed, I don't see a reasonable excuse.As for my lunch (*ugh*): I ordered four sliders (one vegetarian, one beef, two chicken) and a side of collared greens with squash. Though I enjoyed the side and the vegetarian slider was okay, my beef slider was slightly undercooked and both my chicken sliders were pink all the way through. Given that chicken needs to be thoroughly cooked to kill off bacteria, this is pretty gross.I've had great meals at their other locations, but I'd stay clear of this one.",1.0

"Horrible!Came here last night @ 7:45 looking for a table of 6 and was told it would be a 90 minute wait. Ouch, that sucks but I get it.. we are a somewhat large group and it's prime time for dinner.

We didn't get a missed call or a voicemail, nothing.She tells us that a table is paying up their bill and the table will be ours in 10 -15 minutes. Ok no problem, we can wait another 15 minutes. After 20 minutes we go and check with the girl and she says that the table just ordered desert and it will be another 15 minutes. UGH, I thought you just said they were paying their bill?!?! We wait another 20 minutes and still nothing.This girl was not apologic at all and had a very 'screw you' attitude. I understand places can get busy and all but you need to give people accurate waiting times. It's not acceptable to keep 'dicking around' people. I highly doubt they tried to call us (as they claim they did).I've been to the West village location a bunch of times and have never experienced attitude like this. I 100% won't be going back.

I chose the classic beef balls with mushroom gravy. While individually they were great as a combination I wouldn't go for it again. But you pick and choose your combination so that is great. The naked balls are essentially 4 balls served with sauce. For an additional price you can order a side.When I got the risotto it was a special favor of fennel I think. It was really zesty. Not too big of a problem but I just didnt expect it to be that way.Summary: Its a fun atmosphere with good food. Worth trying and sampling different combinations.,4.0

"*Sigh* Not sure why I even came here, as I wasn't too much of a fan of the LES one. It was a Saturday night and a 40 minute wait. I loved that they use a site that gives you an update on your wait time. The music was loud, but not annoying.I had the chicken marsala special in a mushroom sauce, the polenta, and kale. The chicken marsala was dry and the polenta was way too watery. I am not a fan of the mushroom sauce at all. The kale had a bitter flavor and it was cold. The snickerdoodle cookie was good, although I couldn't figure out what the flavor was - tasted like nothing except the cinnamon sprinkled in it.On a different note, the kitchen vent had farm animal decals on the vent. They had a chicken, cow, duck, rabbit and goat. Yet they don't offer three of those five animals on the menu. They offer pork meatballs but I didn't see a pig. Either offer them as a different types of meatballs or take them down. I claim false advertisement! ....Apparently, this bothered me enough to Yelp about it.",2.0
"The Meatball Shop is one of the best things that's ever happened to me. Â The only reason it's not 5 stars was the insanely slow service, but I'll get to that later. I've been dying to go to the location on the LES, but the wait is NEVER less than 2 hours - so when in Brooklyn for the afternoon, I jumped at the opportunity to visit this less-crowded but same-menu location....and it absolutely lived up to expectations.I went with sliders so that I could sample as many different combinations as possible- the spicy pork with tomato sauce, beef with spicy meat sauce, chicken with parmesan cream, and the special which was turkey with cranberry sauce. Â Each one was better than the next. Â I'm in love with the spicy pork choice and the parmesan cream sauce, and plan to return to combine these two options immediately.

"*Sigh* Not sure why I even came here, as I wasn't too much of a fan of the LES one. It was a Saturday night and a 40 minute wait. I loved that they use a site that gives you an update on your wait time. The music was loud, but not annoying.I had the chicken marsala special in a mushroom sauce, the polenta, and kale. The chicken marsala was dry and the polenta was way too watery. I am not a fan of the mushroom sauce at all. The kale had a bitter flavor and it was cold. The snickerdoodle cookie was good, although I couldn't figure out what the flavor was - tasted like nothing except the cinnamon sprinkled in it.On a different note, the kitchen vent had farm animal decals on the vent. They had a chicken, cow, duck, rabbit and goat. Yet they don't offer three of those five animals on the menu. They offer pork meatballs but I didn't see a pig. Either offer them as a different types of meatballs or take them down. I claim false advertisement! ....Apparently, this bothered me enough to Yelp about it.",2.0

Â Each one was better than the next. Â I'm in love with the spicy pork choice and the parmesan cream sauce, and plan to return to combine these two options immediately.

"I've heard so much about the illustrious Daniel Holzman, especially with the debut of his Meatball Shop Cookbook, so when my plans to go tour the Brooklyn Brewery with a few friends fell through today (for future reference: only Fridays / Weekends) we turned around and walked to the Bedford Ave. location for a bite. Seeing I just made meatballs, I was eager to experience a new realm of meatball-making.I got the special of the day with the special sauce: buffalo chicken meatball with bleu cheese sauce. It was tender and juicy; the sauce wasn't overpowering; the flavors blended well together. I wish there was a bit more actual heat in the meatballs, however. They weren't particularly spicy, but then again ""buffalo chicken"" usually isn't all that spicy. Or perhaps I just have only minimal taste buds left after dating a guy from Sichuan (a province in China full of VERY spicy food). The sauce was great though--not too thick or heavy as many times the bleu cheese can overwhelm the actual meatball. My friend who didn't also get the special got the classic meatball quartet with spicy meat sauce and a side of risotto. He said the meatballs were delicious but the risotto was so-so. I guess you should only order what the shop is known for.Ambiance was funky and fun, with vintage meat grinders on the wall and photos of (I think?) relevant people. Service was great, the waitress was super friendly and actually gave her opinion on what she liked to eat there (it was rather complicated and detailed, clearly not just a run-of-the-mill answer). I really liked the ""write on the menu"" system as I had to request no bun and it was so easy to just write it on the menu itself, minimizing a chance the waitress would forget.

""What is this place made for? Midgets!""Short wait time. We were seated within five minutes (on a weekday afternoon). The food was palatable, and the polenta was some of the best I've had (I've had a lot of crappy polenta). Â I ordered classic beef, lamb and spicy pork. My friend ordered 'everything but the kitchen sink salad'. The meatballs were moist, and well seasoned. I couldn't recommend any one of them to you b/c I was thinking the whole time, I'm starving and this is not enough food for me. The meatball sliders were ping pong sized. The man next to me was even more livid 'This cannot feed me! I am a growing man! This is food for midgets!' I laughed and pointed at my dish. ""What about this food?"" After the meatballs, I ordered the polenta- which was rich, creamy, and had a pleasant viscosity when I spooned it up.The best part was the ginger cookies and their vanilla ice cream sandwich.

We tried classic beef with spicy tomato sauce, and spicy pork with classic tomato sauce. Both were amazing. They were flavorful and juicy. I never thought meatballs would be noteworthy. Meatball Shop, you have put me in my place. The salad was pretty fantastic too; tossed with pear, blue cheese, and walnuts. Even the broccoli was delicious. I had something called a Warm and Cozy to drink; hot spiced apple cider with whiskey. It was definitely on the strong side but delicious nonetheless. We finished our meal with a homemade ice cream sandwich. Homemade cookies. Homemade ice cream. Pure joy.The atmosphere is trendy, homey, upscale comfort food.

Mine was meat with tasteless red sauce, my friend got the veggie & thought the same.

"Just had dinner here for a double date with my college friend Michele W.I really like the concept of The Meatball Shop with it's old timey decor with a nod to modern design.For our table of four I think we got a little bit of everything, spicy pork w/spicy tomato sauce on hero, spicy pork on spaghetti with fried egg, beef with tomato sauce hero and beef meatballs with mushroom sauce and side of leek risotto. Everything was very tasty- not mind blowing but good comfort food. The prices are pretty reasonable that you can try a little of this and that from the menu and its created in way that makes ordering really simple to mix and match. It's really ingenious that you get a dry erase menu to check off your own order.They had a pretty good drink menu with some specials.

The have a good number of cookie and ice cream choices and once again score big in my book with the mix and match option.

When my friend invited me out to the Meatball Shop I was skeptical because I never thought of meatballs as a restaurant concept.The big wood community tables were really fun. It's a cozy restaurant where its difficult to have an intimate conversation but a great place to make new friends.When you sit down you are given a laminated menu where you check off with a magic marker what you would like to eat. I had the pork meatballs on mash potatoes with a Thai basil lemonade. It was amazing. Such a good experience.,4.0
Awesome meatballs. Â Duh it's in the name. Â  Homemade ice cream was great in the brown sugar flavor. Â Make it a cookie sandwich and u may have to change shorts. Â Loudish place but fun crowd. Â People who work there seem too laughy Â like they are high but are really just good at laughing at stuff that isn't that funny. Â And the drinks are really good. Â Don't forget those.

They had a special ""Jerk"" chicken meatball that was great and the spicy pork with meat sauce was pretty good.  Some of the sides were good too.

Â I thought the mix-and-match your own cocktail flavor combinations was an awesome idea, but I didn't particularly care for mine. Â And a bit pricey. Â However - the food really was pretty good.

"This place is pretty good. I like it better than the Manhattan location, mostly because it's larger. Both places look great. Really nicely decorated.  The basic meatball with regular sauce was just OK. Not bad, but nothing extraordinary.  The secret to enjoying your time here seems to be mixing things up in unusual ways. They had a special ""Jerk"" chicken meatball that was great and the spicy pork with meat sauce was pretty good.  Some of the sides were good too. A friend ordered the the mashed potatoes, which I thought it was a mistake but it turned out to be delicious. Sadly, the ice cream sandwiches weren't as good as they sound, still try them out and judge for yourself.  This place is worth a visit, just pull a ""Costanza"" and do the opposite...

Â But being made fun of at the door, having bottles of water slammed down on the table in a fly-by serve, getting ignored then served a check as soon as our food came out, and watching our neighbors get the sass for noticing an error in their favor was too much. Â I know we were there pretty late (after midnight) but the crew they have working there on a saturday night is insufferable.For the owner's reference, the date was 2/11/12!",1.0
"I am so excited that these guys have opened their Williamsburg, Brooklyn location half a block from the Bedford L subway station-- **they have a full cocktail menu!**The one in Manhattan currently serves beers, but the new Brooklyn location serves specialty cocktails as well. I was so amazed at the service. I ate here the week it opened, and we got our food in 3 minutes, no joke. Their lineup was so efficient I was baffled. Our server ran around like a racehorse but was super sociable.-Same great taste as the LES location! Still the delicious ice cream and cookie desserts.-Different meatball specials-Slightly bigger location-Open Kitchen layout where you can sit at the kitchen bar and watch your food being made.Bravo, these guys know how it's done. *FAV*",5.0
"One word to describe this place: delicious.We tried the naked beef meatballs and the reuben meatballs - which was the special meatball of the night. Â The beef meatballs had great flavor and were great with risotto. However, the reuben meatballs really took the prize. They were corned beef, sauerkraut and caraway seeds all balled up into pure deliciousness. Â On top of that was a little cold 1000 Island dressing as sauce. Â I got a side of the rigatoni pasta on the side - which came covered in a fantastic red sauce. Â Overall, everything Â was absolutely perfect. Â But, I would recommend trying the special meatball they offer on any given night - because I think it really wet above and beyond.",5.0
"People rave about how great The Meatball Shop is. Â I don't really see it.I actually think the side salad that they serve with your sub is much better than the actual sandwich itself. Â I have had their sandwiches on two occasions--both on a hoagie bun. Â One time I had the beef with the regular sauce, the other time I tried chicken with the mushroom gravy. Â Both times, I found the sauces to be overly greasy, and there is just too much bread. Â  It's just....too much. Â The balls weren't even that flavorful, and I've had much better at some standard Italian restaurants. Â I'm not saying they were bad. Â I just think, if you are going to call yourself The Meatball Shop and specialize in meatballs, then you should make the best damn meatballs in town. Â These were okay. Â They weren't great.",3.0

I would recommend the sliders because you can mix and match, always try something new! You can never go wrong with the risotto either! For dessert I always order the cookie ice cream sandwich, where you can mix and match 2 different homemade cookies with their homemade ice cream. My favorite is brownie cookie with vanilla ice cream. The homemade sangria is probably the best sangria I've ever had. Sangria is usually made with red wine, but in their case, they make it with rose wine. Rose is not my favorite kind of wine, but it is perfect with this sangria! Must try! This restaurant is located in Williamsburg, Brooklyn and has that artsy and laid-back atmosphere.

"Surprisingly not so surprising. Sat at the bar, preparing to be wowed by lusty little bits of meat nourishment and was instead meh'd by bland little bits of blandy blandness. Shared three orders of Naked Balls ($7 for four) - Mediterranean Lamb (on special) with the special sauce (I don't know what it was but it doesn't matter because it didn't taste like nuthin'), the vegetarian (which turned out to be the best of the bunch because there was actually some flavor flav) with classic tomato sauce (meh), and the classic beef with Parmesan cream (eh). I wanted them to be delightful, for serious, but they just weren't. The Freshly-Milled Polenta side ($4) was divine, however.

"The meatballs here are delicious, but a tad on the salty side. We ordered the naked chicken meatballs with mushroom gravy and spicy pork meatballs with spicy tomato sauce, and the roasted veggies, sauteed broccoli and mashed potatoes on the side. I really loved the mushroom gravy, and the naked meatballs do come with a small slice of focaccia. I think since the meatballs were a little salty, it would have been helpful to have more bread -- the amount they give is about two fingers in width and about the same length. The sides were great! I really enjoyed that the sauteed broccoli had crushed red chili flakes for a mild kick and the cauliflower for the roasted veggies tasted slightly pickled (delicious!) and the mashed potatoes were well done too. Dessert was also great. We got the chocolate chip ice cream sandwich with espresso ice cream -- and the espresso ice cream was to die for.

The flavour was great, but the balls were a bit dry. The gravy was very tasty and made up for the dry mouthful of balls. My friend had the spicy pork balls with mushroom gravy and seemed to enjoy it. It isn't easy making moist veggie balls, I guess. Beer selection is underwhelming, but they have creative cocktail concoctions.

The flavour was great, but the balls were a bit dry. The gravy was very tasty and made up for the dry mouthful of balls. My friend had the spicy pork balls with mushroom gravy and seemed to enjoy it.

"I've heard enough about the Meatball Shop to decide to try it myself. It must have been good if they could expand from a rinky dink shop in the LES to the hipster neighborhood but it absolutely did not disappoint. The first thing you have to realize about this place is that it is loud. Secondly, you get to use petri dish pencils as you mark off what you want. I believe the staple of the Meatball shop would be the Spicy Pork balls. They had just enough heat, combine that with the Spicy Meat sauce and you've got quite a combination. You can add the combo on top of rigatoni or on the side, but I will warn you that it is quite al dente. Personally I am not a fan of al dente pasta so I got the spaghetti, my friend got the mashed potatoes which were quite good. . Add in the reasonable price, and I'd say it was well worth the trip to Williamsburg and is a welcome addition. Happy dining",4.0

"(Why the 2 star rating? Â Skip to the 4th paragraph)I visited The Meatball Shop for lunch on a whim because my friend and I were checking out furniture and antique stores in Williamsburg. Â We walked in and were immediately greeted by a friendly hostess. Â The layout of the restaurant is very appealing. Â It's designed to look like a hybrid between a tavern and diner. Â It's clean and the lighting is both warm and inviting. Â The hostess explained that they were about to have a staff meeting, but we were welcome to have a seat.We both took a seat at the bar counter. Â While we waited, I watched the staff interact with each other and I really got the feeling that everyone was very close, like a family. Â And despite some of the anti-hipster sentiment by some of the reviewers, it was a cool window into the lives of people who live a different lifestyle than myself. Â Who am I to judge how other people enjoy their lives? Â But I digress.I originally ordered the ""Special Meatball"" of the day which was Mediterranean Lamb, but apparently the board featuring the day's specials was incorrect (not very professional and a bit annoying) so I ordered the spicy pork meatball sandwich with mushroom sauce and provolone on whole wheat which came with a side salad for $9. Â Being from an Italian family, I have to say that the meatballs were pretty good. Â Not my favorite, but very tasty. Â The spicy pork wasn't really spicy. Â However, the meat, cheese and sauce blended well together and the bread tasted fresh. Â The side salad was also crisp and fresh with greens, apples, and (I think) olive oil for dressing. Everything was going well, until my friend began having an allergic reaction. Â He is allergic to nuts and he wasn't sure if he was just being paranoid at first. Â So he asked the bartender if the salad had any nuts in it. Â She said no, then realized that the Veggie Meatballs were made with Walnuts. Â My friend understandably became agitated upon realizing what had happened. Â As we searched for answers, I looked at the menu and at the very bottom in fine print read something along the lines of, ""Allergies? Ask your server."" Â The bartender then began defending the restaurant and essentially blaming my friend for not taking the proper precautions by asking her if his meal contained nuts. Â Not angrily, mind you, but she was seemingly unwilling to hear out my friend who had to duck out to pick up some medicine from the pharmacy around the corner. Â Here's the problem with her argument:1) Â No one would reasonably expect a meatball, even a veggie meatball, to contain nuts. Â If it was something like pesto, then, yea, you would ask because most people make it with pine nuts.2) Â I've worked in restaurants and have a degree in Hospitality. Â In the realm of customer service, the onus falls on the establishment to inform the guest of a potential health hazard, such as the existence of nuts in a meatball. Â Some restaurants even make it a point of service to ask every table if anyone has allergies that they should be aware of. Â Compared with that, having an allergy question written in fine print at the bottom of the menu seems lazy.3) Â The menu was poorly labeled. Â One would think that for safety's sake the establishment would do everything within its power to protect the guest and cover their own ass by simply adding ""Contains Walnuts"" next to the Veggie Meatball on the menu. Â The owners could have had a lawsuit on their hands had the situation turned deadly.On top of this, when my friend asked to speak to the manager (not to berate him, but simple to provide feedback so as to avoid this potentially deadly situation in the future) she acknowledged his request, but proceeded to finish her cleaning duties instead of going to get the manager. Â It was only after his second request that she abandoned her side work to fetch the manager. Â I couldn't really hear his conversation with the manger, but it didn't seem like he got it either.In conclusion, the food was pretty good, but unfortunately the service and complete lack of understanding regarding the severity of the situation was a bit shocking. Â People make mistakes. Â It's how you go about redeeming the mistake that's important. Â I hope the owners consider providing the staff with some customer service training and that they label the menu properly.",2.0

"I've heard enough about the Meatball Shop to decide to try it myself. It must have been good if they could expand from a rinky dink shop in the LES to the hipster neighborhood but it absolutely did not disappoint. The first thing you have to realize about this place is that it is loud. Secondly, you get to use petri dish pencils as you mark off what you want. I believe the staple of the Meatball shop would be the Spicy Pork balls. They had just enough heat, combine that with the Spicy Meat sauce and you've got quite a combination. You can add the combo on top of rigatoni or on the side, but I will warn you that it is quite al dente. Personally I am not a fan of al dente pasta so I got the spaghetti, my friend got the mashed potatoes which were quite good. . Add in the reasonable price, and I'd say it was well worth the trip to Williamsburg and is a welcome addition. Happy dining",4.0
"I go on off hours so i dont have to wait in the rediculous line to just eat meatballs so I cannot complain, but I hear the line can be rediculous! Â Anyhoo...the food is solid. Â I actually like to order the kitchen sink and 1 additional slider and share it with my dining companion! Â Cheap and filling and a great time out! Â Maybe if I'd spent more on all the additions I would not be as impressed but for what i got and what i paid it was a good deal.",4.0
"(Why the 2 star rating? Â Skip to the 4th paragraph)I visited The Meatball Shop for lunch on a whim because my friend and I were checking out furniture and antique stores in Williamsburg. Â We walked in and were immediately greeted by a friendly hostess. Â The layout of the restaurant is very appealing. Â It's designed to look like a hybrid between a tavern and diner. Â It's clean and the lighting is both warm and inviting. Â The hostess explained that they were about to have a staff meeting, but we were welcome to have a seat.We both took a seat at the bar counter. Â While we waited, I watched the staff interact with each other and I really got the feeling that everyone was very close, like a family. Â And despite some of the anti-hipster sentiment by some of the reviewers, it was a cool window into the lives of people who live a different lifestyle than myself. Â Who am I to judge how other people enjoy their lives? Â But I digress.I originally ordered the ""Special Meatball"" of the day which was Mediterranean Lamb, but apparently the board featuring the day's specials was incorrect (not very professional and a bit annoying) so I ordered the spicy pork meatball sandwich with mushroom sauce and provolone on whole wheat which came with a side salad for $9. Â Being from an Italian family, I have to say that the meatballs were pretty good. Â Not my favorite, but very tasty. Â The spicy pork wasn't really spicy. Â However, the meat, cheese and sauce blended well together and the bread tasted fresh. Â The side salad was also crisp and fresh with greens, apples, and (I think) olive oil for dressing. Everything was going well, until my friend began having an allergic reaction. Â He is allergic to nuts and he wasn't sure if he was just being paranoid at first. Â So he asked the bartender if the salad had any nuts in it. Â She said no, then realized that the Veggie Meatballs were made with Walnuts. Â My friend understandably became agitated upon realizing what had happened. Â As we searched for answers, I looked at the menu and at the very bottom in fine print read something along the lines of, ""Allergies? Ask your server."" Â The bartender then began defending the restaurant and essentially blaming my friend for not taking the proper precautions by asking her if his meal contained nuts. Â Not angrily, mind you, but she was seemingly unwilling to hear out my friend who had to duck out to pick up some medicine from the pharmacy around the corner. Â Here's the problem with her argument:1) Â No one would reasonably expect a meatball, even a veggie meatball, to contain nuts. Â If it was something like pesto, then, yea, you would ask because most people make it with pine nuts.2) Â I've worked in restaurants and have a degree in Hospitality. Â In the realm of customer service, the onus falls on the establishment to inform the guest of a potential health hazard, such as the existence of nuts in a meatball. Â Some restaurants even make it a point of service to ask every table if anyone has allergies that they should be aware of. Â Compared with that, having an allergy question written in fine print at the bottom of the menu seems lazy.3) Â The menu was poorly labeled. Â One would think that for safety's sake the establishment would do everything within its power to protect the guest and cover their own ass by simply adding ""Contains Walnuts"" next to the Veggie Meatball on the menu. Â The owners could have had a lawsuit on their hands had the situation turned deadly.On top of this, when my friend asked to speak to the manager (not to berate him, but simple to provide feedback so as to avoid this potentially deadly situation in the future) she acknowledged his request, but proceeded to finish her cleaning duties instead of going to get the manager. Â It was only after his second request that she abandoned her side work to fetch the manager. Â I couldn't really hear his conversation with the manger, but it didn't seem like he got it either.In conclusion, the food was pretty good, but unfortunately the service and complete lack of understanding regarding the severity of the situation was a bit shocking. Â People make mistakes. Â It's how you go about redeeming the mistake that's important. Â I hope the owners consider providing the staff with some customer service training and that they label the menu properly.",2.0

"Delicious food and what a great atmosphere! Â I've been to a few of The Meatball Shop locations and Brooklyn, by far, is the best.

I love how you can hear the music and easily maintain a conversation, which makes for a fun dinner!! Â My husband and I sat at the bar and the bartender was always ready to pour us another round and the food came out quick. Â Their spaghetti is under-rated, as it's one of my favorites and the risotto is always excellent and has a unique twist. Â The wait can be a little long, but there are many bars around the corner to visit while you wait and I recommend chillin at the bar for some excellent chianti so we don't mind the wait at all.This place is perfect for a romantic dinner and I'd imagine it being a hipster's dream ($2 PBR and a cheap dinner for a GREAT value!!) and it's a fun place to go with friends and quite interactive. Â You can sit in front of the cooks and watch them cook which is pretty cool. Â And TMS stays open until 4am....even though I'm not a night owl, I imagine this being the BEST drunk late night snack ever and a great place to wind the night down.The best part was our bill - we had 2 large meals, a few drinks each, and took some meatballs and spaghetti home....total bill for 2 = $65.

Only thing that I hate is the wait - once was seated within 30 mins and another time it took us an hour and a half. I've tried the spicy pork, chicken and classic meatballs. All were really good. The sauces are so yummy. I've had them all - even a cranberry sauce last year during thanksgiving. Always get the rigatoni, market salad, and mash potatoes and i'm always delighted! I tried the risotto and didnt like it but dont take my word for it - i dont like risotto, period. I was just giving it a try cuz someone else at the table ordered it. The desserts are big and i cant ever finish it alone so we always split the brownie and espresso dessert.",4.0
"Though a bit too noisy for me (why must all the good place be noisy?) Â This place was pretty darned good. Â I had the Spicy Pork meatballs with a simple tomato sauce and on the side had roasted potat, vidalia, and chorizo. Â Nice combo. Â  It's all very tasty, but what I appreciated most was the portion. Â I'm a big guy and I thought all this was perfect. Â Wasn't full or stuffed and had room for dessert. Â Had the Honey Graham cookie with Rasberry Swirl ice cream. Â That didn't push me over the edge but after that I felt full. Â Nothing more was needed. Â I want to go back a few more time and try their other kinds of meatballs and side salads. Â It all look damn yummy. Â  Â If your a lover of the meatball, Â give this place a try, I doubt it will disappoint even the hardest of critics.",5.0
Already love the LES location but this one is nearly three times the size AND has a full bar with amazing mixed drinks! Can't get much better. Service is on point from night one and food is every bit as fabulous,5.0

"Oh mannnnnn. The chicken meatballs are AMAZING. So tender and juicy and flavorful. I like how you can sorta customize your dish by picking what type of meatball and what type of sauce you want. I got to try their special, the buffalo meatballs with blue cheese sauce. I wasn't a big fan of it. Meh. Their spicy pork tasted good and my friend got Parmesan cream over it which was gooey deliciousness. I got the chicken meatballs with pesto sauce. MMMMMM! YUMMY! They also give you a piece of bread with your meatballs. We got a side of mashed potatoes and a side of risotto. The mashed potatoes tasted so good we got a second order of them and finished it off quickly. Risotto wasn't bad but not great either. Then we decided to try their chicken meatballs with mushroom cream sauce served over rigatoni. It was delightful. I'm salivating now just thinking about it. All the while we were sipping white peach sangria, it was good but not anything special in my opinion. For dessert we got their mint? ice cream cookie sandwich. I didn't like the ice cream, but the cookies were alright. Our waitress was nice and smiled a lot. :) I also like how the kitchen is out in the open!",5.0
Just ate here tonight (Monday) and I'm definitely a fan of the place. We had a party of 6 so we had to wait 30-40 mins or so but the hostess was very courteous. They take your phone number so they'll call you when your table is ready.I had the special (Buffalo Wing meatballs) with the bleu cheese sauce. On the side I had roasted Jerusalem artichokes which were surprisingly good (I never had artichokes before).,4.0

"From my past review you could tell that I was very excited about this place. I came back for dinner with my chef-sister and, to say the least, was completely unsatisfied. We decided to order tons of different sliders to try everything that caught our eye from the menu. Absolutely nothing was well executed. And don't get me started on the sides such as the risotto, the 3 of them that we ordered were extremely flat, no salt, no flavor. I was very disappointed.

"This place has gone downhill, both in service and atmosphere. The only reason I'm giving it 2 stars as opposed to 1 is because I like the food, although that has declined a bit too. The atmosphere of this place has turned into a douchey, drunken frat boy nightclub. Last night, they were playing terrible hip hop music (so ironic!) so loud that I wanted to bash myself in the head. Don't get me wrong--I love me some hip hop--but I don't enjoy hearing some fuckhead rapping (poorly at that) about pussy, weed, and bitches while I'm trying to enjoy my meal. The service was inattentive and mediocre--didn't see our waiter again until we asked for the check--that seems to be the standard now.

"All Meatballs. Completely customizable menu. You can pair anything from beef, pork, and vegetable meatballs with your choice of sauces; classic tomato, parmesan cream pesto, and mushroom gravy.

"Super cool specialty place! Tried the chicken meatballs on whole wheat with mozzarella and tomato sauce. Comes with salad greens. Delicious! Lots of food... Regret I couldnt try the homemade cookie ice cream sandwiches. In house limeade special was tart and sweet, maybe a little less lime-y than I was expecting. Mozzarella is fresh on the hero, scrumptious. The chicken meatballs were good, but a little under seasoned. Delicious nonetheless. Worth a try. Ambiance is great, and the place oozes character.",3.0

"Yum.I had been dying to try this place out for months. I finally dropped in this afternoon and it was really good.You have a choice of pork, beef, chicken or vegetable meatballs. They're regular sized meatballs. You get to choose what type of sauce you'd like on them too. Options included cream sauce, mushroom gravy, tomato sauce, pesto and a spicy meat sauce.You can't mix the types of meatballs you order unless you order sliders. The other options include meatballs and sauce over of your choice of a side, in a hero, with a salad or mashed up and put on a bun sloppy joe style.I had the chicken meatballs (there are four to an order)with pesto sauce and their house salad and split it. This was more than enough food to keep me full for hours. The meatballs were amazing. I wasn't sure about ordering chicken, because I was afraid they would be dry, but these were sooooooo goodddddd. They weren't dry and they were really flavorful. The pesto sauce was also perfect and fresh and there was lots of it. There was parmesan cheese sprinkled on top. The salad was decent, but I would return just for the meatballs!!!!The only drawbacks were the volume of the music, which alternated between fairly heavy rock and hip hop, but it was all so loud that we had to shout, which isn't normally the type of atmosphere I'm into for lunch on Saturday afternoon. It was also a bit at odds with the decor: sun streaming in from a big skylight and Ball jars full of sunflowers on the table. I'm not saying I need to eat in a library, but bringing the volume down several notches would make the experience a lot more enjoyable.The waitstaff were attentive and maybe stretched a little thin. They were very friendly though and our waiter explained the menu at length whenhe asked us if we'd been there before and we said no. He had a lot of tables though and our iced tea got lost in the shuffle.All in all, I really like this place. Next time, I will somehow save room for dessert, because the homemade ice cream sandwiches the tablenext to us ordered looked amazing!",4.0
"This place was unbelievably greatJaclyn was our server and she was great. All three of us commented on how warm and cool and helpful she was before we even placed our orders, after a minor beets related brouhaha, we became converts for life! After informing us that it was no problem to ask that beets not be included in the ""kitchen sink"" vegetable medley and insuring that she had placed the order that way, beets did turn up on the side of the plate, which was not a big issue. Not only did Jaclyn notice, she had the manager send over some free goodies and apologize profusely. Completely unnecessary but SO appreciated and awesome of her. Also the hostess was great and the ""give us your cell phone number"" system was highly appreciated and convenient. The food itself was amazing. There was a beef smash with tomato sauce and mozeralla cheese, a chicken and parmesean cream sauce with a side of spinach and a veggie kitchen sink with parmesean. Everyone was incredibly pleased, so much so that we decided to go ahead and order some dessert, which is something we almost never do, but the ice cream sandwiches (wow) and whiskey floats (woww) were definitely worth it!The drinks would have been the highlight had the food not been so good! From the choose your own concoctions to the Fool Aid and the Jello Shot of the day, everyone left dinner with a solid buzz and extremely impressed and pleasantly surprised.

"I'd been waiting for this place to open for a while now. Finally got to try it out last night.A few things that struck me before I make it to the food. The atmosphere was not what I expected. A little to stiff and trendy for the type of food...It's a meatball place for god's sake, not momofuku. Speaking of stiff, the management here has their priorities completely off. The entire time we were there, the managers were bitching at waiters for not having the menus lined up properly and for the tables not lining up with ""the fifth line of the wood in the floor"" (I'm not exaggerating), and the menus perfectly lining up to the borders of the table facing out. It was soooooo ridiculous. Then both managers stood at the table next to ours, carefully looking at the menus deciding if they should be laid out vertically or horizontally. Our waiter asked us, what do you guys think? I replied that they were wasting way too much time concerning themselves with the orientation of the menus, to which one of the managers replied, ""I'm a stickler for this stuff"", and didn't even ask how our experience was. While I appreciate attention to detail his time would be better spent walking around and asking people if they like their food, and not bitching at his wait staff. I don't know what kind of place these guys think they are running... once again, it's a meatball place not blue hill at stone barns. And the meatballs are fine, not the best I've ever had but did the job for a late night meal. I had the spicy pork meatballs with tomato sauce over polenta. I'd try something else next time but I'm in no rush to go back. Hopefully when I make it back these dudes will have figured out the orientation of the menu (god knows that's what keeps customers coming back) and will be having a bit more fun with the place. RELAX dudes, it's fuckin williamsburg.",3.0

It deserves one so here goes...It was the end of a free screening of Jurassic Park in McCarren Park and I was already a little tipsy after having 2 cans of the Six Point they were selling at the movie. Anyway that's beside the point. I was hungry and my friend and I passed The Meatball Shop and I drunkenly/classily said ""OMG there is one of those on the Lower East Side!"" So we went in and I just got a normal bowl of the meatballs and traditional sauce. It's a nice place but it was also great drunk food. Saucy and messy and just right. My friend got a meatball sandwich which also satisfied me. This was a few months ago, but I still remember the drinks. They are unique, fruity, and interesting. Seriously, I told the guy I liked gin and pomegranate or something and he recommended me one of their specialty drinks (I don't remember what it was, but it was good). They had a giant vat of sangria out too. I need to go back and try an ice cream sandwich. I recommend this place wholeheartedly. You can't lose there. They do simple really well. Also, the ambient lighting was up to par, and I have high standards for that.",4.0

"Late night snacks! I was actually cruising on Yelp last night just for fun and I came across this place. I went to their site and as soon as I saw the picture of the meatballs I got hungry. I showed the hubby and it made him even more hungry and so the trip was born. For a Tuesday at 11:30pm there was a crowd at the bar and a few people at the dining tables. We were seated immediately and our waitress came and asked if we had ever been there before. She explained how the ordering process worked and the specials for the night. Hubby and I both went with the smash (beef balls, tomato sauce, and mozz cheese-hubby went without cheese). It came with an arugula and apple salad on the side. I was super impressed with the service. Everyone was really nice and the food came quickly. The sandwich was delicious. It was on Brioche bread and the flavors of the sauce, meat, and cheese really came through. I thought the meatballs were light but flavorful. I don't eat pork but I might just dare try the spicy pork meatballs! The decor of the place was country kitch meets LES/Williamsburg cool and I thought it was really adorable. It sure Â was cheap too. I enjoyed this place and will be back soon.",5.0

"The meatballs were ""okay"" Â I guess I expected more from this place. Â For how late it was open, I didn't mind the price.

Â I will probably end up at this place again since surf bar stopped serving food 2 hours before advertised. Â What a cluster f**K!",2.0
Try this place. It's filled with hipster's and I don't think the hostess smiled once but the food and drinks were great.,4.0
Good food and good service. I had the beef meatballs with tomato sauce and my friend had the spicy pork meatballs with alfredo sauce. we both thought the beef meatballs tasted better. It comes with 4 meatballs and it was pretty filling. Looking forward to trying other things here.,4.0
"I'd been waiting for this place to open for a while now. Finally got to try it out last night.A few things that struck me before I make it to the food. The atmosphere was not what I expected. A little to stiff and trendy for the type of food...It's a meatball place for god's sake, not momofuku. Speaking of stiff, the management here has their priorities completely off. The entire time we were there, the managers were bitching at waiters for not having the menus lined up properly and for the tables not lining up with ""the fifth line of the wood in the floor"" (I'm not exaggerating), and the menus perfectly lining up to the borders of the table facing out. It was soooooo ridiculous. Then both managers stood at the table next to ours, carefully looking at the menus deciding if they should be laid out vertically or horizontally. Our waiter asked us, what do you guys think? I replied that they were wasting way too much time concerning themselves with the orientation of the menus, to which one of the managers replied, ""I'm a stickler for this stuff"", and didn't even ask how our experience was. While I appreciate attention to detail his time would be better spent walking around and asking people if they like their food, and not bitching at his wait staff. I don't know what kind of place these guys think they are running... once again, it's a meatball place not blue hill at stone barns. And the meatballs are fine, not the best I've ever had but did the job for a late night meal. I had the spicy pork meatballs with tomato sauce over polenta. I'd try something else next time but I'm in no rush to go back. Hopefully when I make it back these dudes will have figured out the orientation of the menu (god knows that's what keeps customers coming back) and will be having a bit more fun with the place. RELAX dudes, it's fuckin williamsburg.",3.0

"i've been to all the meatball shop locations, and this location and the village one is my favorite.

I always feel like i have gotten my daily dose of greens when i eat here without feeling like you have spent $10 on a vegetable side to only get 3 pieces of wilting green beans with butter on it. i was debating on taking 1 star off b/c their vegetarian meatballs really, really could use some work (i don't mind it being grain based instead of soy, but it's rock hard and dry) BUT it's nice that this place has thought of the vegetarians. its a place where the veggies and meat lovers can dine at an an affordable price. as far as ambience goes: this bedford location as you can guess is hipster, full of hipster parents with their little ones",5.0

"Make no mistake, I love dishes involving meat, cheese and bread as much as the next person (though I've subsequently become a vegetarian for want of anything better to do) however, I feel as though the quality of fare on offer at The Meatball Shop has become a debate for the ages amongst friends. There appear to be many esteemed Yelpers who have written glowing reviews for said establishment and they are not entirely unjustified in doing so - the food is good. Is it fight-your-fellow-patrons-to-the-death-to-get-your-name-on-the-waiting-list good? I contend that this is a bit of a stretch.I've tried several dishes on the menu as I'm a glutton (the primary reason) who really wants to understand the aura of hype that surrounds this place. My first experience involved the naked balls, which appears to suggest something other than what I'm trying to convey. But I digress. In any event, coupling said balls with a side of polenta and topping it off with a thick sauce results in something that is tasty. However, the meatballs themselves lack any subtle or interesting flavors and I believe that one would be hard-pressed to explain how this meatball is different from any other meatball being offered by many other restaurants (this is a question posed at all too many a Passover Seder these days). I think that The Meatball Shop relies a lot more on the finished product (which incorporates inherently tasty things) than the quality of their namesake. Perhaps I'm just missing the point, which is entirely possible. If I'm running a meatball shop, surely those items should steal the show? In this instance, they don't.Similarly, the hero sandwich incorporates bread, cheese, sauce and meatballs, which results in something that is - inevitably - satisfying. Again, however, my primary response tends to be towards the sauce and cheese rather than the meatballs which were dry and rather flavorless on the two occasions on which I ordered them.Conclusion: This is a popular place with a comfortable and vibrant atmosphere, together with decent food.

"Me and 3 friends are visiting the city from Las Vegas and heard of this great restaurant in Brooklyn, so we go all the way out there to try it out. We had a great experience while we were eating and the food was amazing! When it was time to pay we asked the waitress if we could get separate bills, she told us no. Also, I had bought a cookbook that was added to the bill as well. We all payed our shares and left the tip on the table. BEFORE we got up to leave she comes and takes the tip off our table and says, ""Is this it for the tip? You left 8 dollars for a 108 dollar tab. C'mon on guys."" Granted, yes, she was right; but, the cookbook shouldn't have been added to the tip and our bills should have been separated. I was so appalled that she would say that to guests in her workplace. She also should have waited until we were out of the building to take our tip. If I were to ask anyone in my workplace, ""is that all your going to tip me?"" I would be fired. Not only is it rude, your job isn't to make the guests feel like you're there just for tips. Your job is to be accommodating and polite. We were so angry we didn't ask for her name nor did she introduce herself.",1.0
"The first time I visited this place was with my girlfriend. We were treated by a smiling hostess that immediately took us to our table. The waiter first asked if this is our first visit and explained how the ordering process goes (you use a marker on the plastic menu card). At first the menu looks confusing but it's really pretty simple when you know what you are doing. You first choose type of meatball (spicy pork, beef, chicken), sauce and side dish. The food is fine, just enough to fill up a grown man. Prices are very reasonable and service is good. I would not recommend this spot for a business meeting, but it's a great place to meet friends and have a quickie (lunch, of course ;-)",3.0
"Amazing variety of meatballs and local/fresh ingredients. I liked the beef balls with tomato sauce over spinach. I also tried their seasonal slider (meatball on a bun), which was so tasty! Turkey ball on bread with cranberry sauce. I ordered the Brussels sprouts and they turned out to be a little on the dry side. Overall, ambiance is great with old-timey pictures and decor. The place is warm and cozy with super friendly staff. The food tasted fresh and creative. I will definitely return.",4.0
"Serious. Â The balls are amazing! Â I actually had seconds. Â My wife got the intro plate: beef meatballs with tomato sauce and spaghetti + side salad. Â I went head first into a sample of sliders. Â I had the special ball: lamb + mint + something else + something else. Â it was amazing. Â The other sliders were: beef + tomato sauce, spicy pork + parm. Â Holy shit the spicy pork + parm sauce was f'n so amazing! Â The combo really gets the job done. Â I had to get 2 more balls for seconds: beef + parm and another spicy pork + parm. Â The spicy pork beat out the beef again. Â We had the brownie cookie sandwich + vanilla ice cream. Â This was the only bad part of the meal. Â I'm an ice cream freak and was excited. Â It was just ok. Â Overall, it was kinda flat. Â I think it just needed more sugar and salt to bring out the flavor. Â I've made desserts and forgot to put salt or didn't put as much sugar and it reminded me of how this tasted. Â I could see the natural vanilla specs in the ice cream so I could see some indication that it was homemade and natural which is all good, but the overall taste was ok. Â I think maybe I got a bad batch. Â I will probably try the chocolate chip next time. Â Don't let this hold you back though. Â I will defo be back to chomp on some of those spicy pork balls. Â That's where its at, for serious. Â I'm probably going to order a plate of spicy pork balls with parm sauce and bury my face in it until the plate is bone dry. Â I can't wait.",4.0
"I am obsessed with this place. Â I love the fact that you can have an entirely different meal every time you come, or stick with a favorite.

Â they catered to her every question and didn't throw her out on the curb like i was expecting when you bring a vegan to a place with meat in the name. Â they took the time to create things for her to order and made her special drinks from the bar.my brother (not a vegan thankfully) and i had the pork and chicken meatballs and they were both amazing. Â the sides here are wonderful and the homemade ice cream was to die for.I've read several reviews about the hipster service and the bland meatballs but neither of those things were true for our experience. Â we sat at the bar and our servers were attentive and really cool about us asking them 57 questions.I'm putting this place in my regular WB rotation and i'm coming back for some ice cream right away now that i'm writing about its tastyness.",4.0
"I've only been here once and I really want to go again. I went on a Friday night around 5 and wasn't that busy, but when I left an hour later (ish) it was starting to pack up. I really enjoyed the old vintage photos all over the wall too; it set the mood of good Italian food. Â My brother and I both had the sampler plate, where you pick 3 or 4 meatballs and they were all delicious. Â Also we had a small dessert of icecream and cookies (which is always yummy)",4.0

"Me and 3 friends are visiting the city from Las Vegas and heard of this great restaurant in Brooklyn, so we go all the way out there to try it out. We had a great experience while we were eating and the food was amazing! When it was time to pay we asked the waitress if we could get separate bills, she told us no. Also, I had bought a cookbook that was added to the bill as well. We all payed our shares and left the tip on the table. BEFORE we got up to leave she comes and takes the tip off our table and says, ""Is this it for the tip? You left 8 dollars for a 108 dollar tab. C'mon on guys."" Granted, yes, she was right; but, the cookbook shouldn't have been added to the tip and our bills should have been separated. I was so appalled that she would say that to guests in her workplace. She also should have waited until we were out of the building to take our tip. If I were to ask anyone in my workplace, ""is that all your going to tip me?"" I would be fired. Not only is it rude, your job isn't to make the guests feel like you're there just for tips. Your job is to be accommodating and polite. We were so angry we didn't ask for her name nor did she introduce herself.",1.0
"The first time I visited this place was with my girlfriend. We were treated by a smiling hostess that immediately took us to our table. The waiter first asked if this is our first visit and explained how the ordering process goes (you use a marker on the plastic menu card). At first the menu looks confusing but it's really pretty simple when you know what you are doing. You first choose type of meatball (spicy pork, beef, chicken), sauce and side dish. The food is fine, just enough to fill up a grown man. Prices are very reasonable and service is good. I would not recommend this spot for a business meeting, but it's a great place to meet friends and have a quickie (lunch, of course ;-)",3.0
"Amazing variety of meatballs and local/fresh ingredients. I liked the beef balls with tomato sauce over spinach. I also tried their seasonal slider (meatball on a bun), which was so tasty! Turkey ball on bread with cranberry sauce. I ordered the Brussels sprouts and they turned out to be a little on the dry side. Overall, ambiance is great with old-timey pictures and decor. The place is warm and cozy with super friendly staff. The food tasted fresh and creative. I will definitely return.",4.0
"Serious. Â The balls are amazing! Â I actually had seconds. Â My wife got the intro plate: beef meatballs with tomato sauce and spaghetti + side salad. Â I went head first into a sample of sliders. Â I had the special ball: lamb + mint + something else + something else. Â it was amazing. Â The other sliders were: beef + tomato sauce, spicy pork + parm. Â Holy shit the spicy pork + parm sauce was f'n so amazing! Â The combo really gets the job done. Â I had to get 2 more balls for seconds: beef + parm and another spicy pork + parm. Â The spicy pork beat out the beef again. Â We had the brownie cookie sandwich + vanilla ice cream. Â This was the only bad part of the meal. Â I'm an ice cream freak and was excited. Â It was just ok. Â Overall, it was kinda flat. Â I think it just needed more sugar and salt to bring out the flavor. Â I've made desserts and forgot to put salt or didn't put as much sugar and it reminded me of how this tasted. Â I could see the natural vanilla specs in the ice cream so I could see some indication that it was homemade and natural which is all good, but the overall taste was ok. Â I think maybe I got a bad batch. Â I will probably try the chocolate chip next time. Â Don't let this hold you back though. Â I will defo be back to chomp on some of those spicy pork balls. Â That's where its at, for serious. Â I'm probably going to order a plate of spicy pork balls with parm sauce and bury my face in it until the plate is bone dry. Â I can't wait.",4.0
"I am obsessed with this place. Â I love the fact that you can have an entirely different meal every time you come, or stick with a favorite. Â Yes, there is a wait alot of times, but the food comes out fast and the line moves quickly. Â The food is always amazing, fresh, and very consistent. Â If you can get the steak, bacon and cheddar ball you will be in heaven!! Â I totally recommend this place.",5.0

Â I had a feeling $5 risotto might not be good. Â It was undercooked, which might not be the worst thing if it tasted good, but it did not. Â My honest recommendation is to avoid this place. Â There are much better places in Williamsburg. Â Go to Diner, Traif, Rye, Dressler, if you want to eat out and have a good time.

I orded 2 small plates with the intention of ordering more, but my wine glass and plates were empty for at least 15 minutes before I finally asked the cook (I was at the kitchen bar) if I needed to go to the register to pay my tab. The place was pretty full, but with the amount of servers on staff, there was no excuse for how shitty the service was. Total bummer, cause the food was decent. I will not recommend this place to any friends visiting Williamsburg, but I am also aware this doesn't really make a difference given the location and super cool concept. I do hope the management makes some sort of effort to let the staff know more is expected of them. Even if the job is nothing more to them than expendable income cause their parents pay their rent, it should be instilled in them that everything you do in life should be done to your maximum potential.",2.0
this is a great spot!!! It's to crowded!!! If you wait fot a table prob be like an hour or 2 wait.. just do take out.. they have great stuff youll enjoy it.. great staff very helpful for first timers.. They also have awesome salads.. its a bit pricey but i didnt mind it..,4.0
"This is the second location of The Meatball Shop, the first one being in the lower east side. The Meatball Shop is one of those places that does one thing really well. It's a restaurant you walk into and wonder why you didn't think of the idea first because they are absolutely killing it. They serve meatballs, obviously. You can get them on a hero or naked (in a bowl with sauce and no bread). You can get them over polenta, pasta, or salad or have one of these items on the side. The options are spicy pork, beef, chicken and veggie balls. I believe they also have a special meatball every night. My wife and I chose to get the spicy pork meatballs and the beef both naked. They come in a bowl of 4 meatballs covered in the sauce of your choosing (classic tomato, spicy meat sauce, etc.). We chose to get one with classic tomato sauce and the other with spicy meat sauce. We also ordered polenta and spinach as a side. Everything was great, the classic beef to me were the clear winners. The pork were good, but had a little bit of a Frank's Red Hot sauce taste to them I wasn't too psyched about. The polenta was excellent. it had cheese mixed in and was highlighted when you put some meatballs and sauce over it. The spinach was a little bland, but you can't expect much from steamed spinach. The service was spot on and the owner was there going from table to table asking for input. I can't wait to return and try their home made ice cream sandwiches and a cocktail or two.",4.0
