"So Tracy from Customer Service reached out to me and asked me to please give them a second chance. My reviews are completely unbiased and i will always give a business a chance to redeem themselves if they ask. Saturday night I did just that after a fun night of hopping around The Meatball Shop was our fifth and final stop. time was around 2:00am and it was still fairly busy. i sat down with two of my friends and this time i was armed with knowledge.Ordered: 1 Stout-like tap beer (don't remember the name but it was delicious) 2. Meatball Hero with classic meatballs, Mozzarella cheese with spicy meat sauce. 3. Tried the Buffalo Chicken Balls 4. Ice Cream Sandwich, Chocolate chip cookies with classic vanillathe food:my god my hero was amazing. absolutely full of flavor. HOT (Balls were at a good temperature) the cheese was melted and the hero bread was charred nicely with a great crunch but also a nice moist texture from the tomato sauce. the buffalo chicken balls were just okay, they don't heat these balls enough, the center was kind of cold so it meant for a mealy, consistency. Ice Cream sandwich and beer: Damn good. No complaints. even after being ridiculously full i managed to finish them both.I am glad I gave this place a second chance and now armed with what you really should order when at TMS I know what I have to get after a long night of bar hopping. I will be back!",4.0
"Restaurant next door was closed so I decided to give this place a try. I walked in with friends at 2 am on a Friday night and this place was EVERYTHING I needed! Great selection of music playing, very energetic and helpful server, and cozy environment. The meatballs were cooked very well; they were tender and well-seasoned! I recommend the chicken meatballs.Have been craving this place ever since my first visit!",5.0
"Stopped in late on a Friday night, sitting at the bar. Enjoyed the hip hop culture and music surrounding us.  They had Various meatball options, which was nice as I love meatballs. They had a nice mix of cocktail options as well.I had 4 (small-medium sized) beef meatballs w spicy sauce: came out quickly, were nicely flavorful and spiced. Came w bread, which was fine. Burnt orange margarita: nice, well flavored, not too bitterBuzzed Lebowski: White Russian w coffee beans and one giant ice cube: strongly flavored of kahluaDrinks were small, maybe a bit more expensive than they should be, though I don't know the area and what's comparableOverall interesting and worth trying if you like meatballs and character",4.0
"Let me preface by saying the meatballs themselves are amazing. I've had various samplings at other Meatball Shops, and they were THE BEST. In fact, that's why when I walked past here last Sunday, I couldn't resist stopping in and trying them out for brunch. I decided to have the Eggs Florentine with the Breakfast Special Meatball (Sausage). The Egg Florentine was tasty, but the wet spinach, sauce, and egg yolk combined made the meal a little soggy. I had a mimosa that was also delicious but small in size for $10. My boyfriend's order was messed up, but our waiter was really great, and there were no hard feelings there. He even gave us a jello shot for our wait. Many of the other servers were eating Dunkin' Donuts right in front of us. I get that it was 1pm and they might be hungry (believe me, I'm ALWAYS hungry), but perhaps this could've been eaten more discreetly in the back. All-in-all I like this place, and if you just get the meatballs, it's a 4-star rating. Unfortunately, today's meal was just average, and I was expecting more. Seeing as this was my first time eating in the Brooklyn location, I can't verify whether or not this was just an off day or typical for the location; hopefully it was the former.",3.0
"Came through here really late last night, around 1am. Had my heart set on ramen but that spot was closed plus I've passed Meatball shop so many times and never stopped in. I loved the old school decor as soon as I walked in, the tables kinda reminded me of desks in a classroom. I really liked their system as far as how ingredients are classified for you to make your decisions and order. It's really simple. I had chicken balls with classic tomato sauce and provolone on brioche and OMG it changed my life!!!! This was the most memorable meatball sandwich I've ever had. It was so good I will now have to just not walk down Bedford so I'm not led into temptation lol But seriously, I'm so happy I stumbled in here and will definitely return.",5.0
I have been wanting to try this place for a long time. Interesting decor. Friendly staff. Went in around noon on Saturday when they were still serving brunch. I think we made a mistake and ordered brunch items. I got the breakfast sandwich (beef) and my husband ordered the Benedict( pork). They were both mediocre. Nothing out of ordinary. Sandwich came with a side salad. I felt the best part of my lunch was the salad dressing. Maybe we didn't order the right items. We will probably go back and try their lunch menu. I refuse to think this place is not up to our standards.,3.0
"The Meatball Shop gets four stars because the manager was kind enough to change the vulgar music playlist upon request. As a black woman who walked in with a black 15-year old male and his mother, we didn't need to hear the n-word constantly being blared from the speakers, as well as what the rapper would do to a female rear-end. Then to top it off, have a sea of white patrons bobbing their heads to it. It just made for a very uncomfortable setting for me as an African-American and as a woman. Not all black people enjoy the genre of gangsta' rap. With that said. The meatballs with pesto sauce was amazing, as well as the meatballs with parmesan cream! We also had brown sugar ice cream sandwiches, which consisted of a decadent chocolate chip cookie and it was amazingly soft but still had a crunch to it. The other cookie holding it all together was an oatmeal raisin. In all, the food was a dream. However, since the manager stated that type of music is played in all the Meatball Shops I'm giving you a heads up - if your threshold is low for vulgarity you may want to order take out if possible. Other than that, amazing staff since I guess they understood how we felt and gifted us two free appetizers, so thank you Meatball Shop!",4.0
"The Meatball Shop has awesome meatballs. I am sure that comes as a shock to you, given the fact that it is CALLED the meatball shop!! lolTheir meatballs are great, their meatballs should be great!The combinations are traditional, yet inventive, bringing you places you never thought you'd go with a meatball. This brooklyn location is spacious, cool and has a nice vibe to it. I would highly recommend, and personally, I like the classic meatballs with sauce. Can't go wrong.",4.0

"Are you under the age of 30?Do you like eating in lively places?Do you like a loud dinner crowd?Are you a fan of sauces? Do you crave that urban, hipster appeal?I sure do, and if you answered yes to most of the above, head on over to Williamsburg's The Meatball Shop. I really like to come here when I'm in the mood for good hip-hop music, being surrounded by a younger crowd, and eating delicious vegetarian meatballs. No, for reals, vegetarian meatballs are the bomb. They're made primarily from lentils and they're heavenly. I usually get them doused in pesto, which can be oily but oh-so-flavorful. Drinks must be good too because the bar is usually packed. To be honest, I come her more for the ambience and environment than the food. Great for dining before going to a party, will definitely put you in the mood to get ""turnt"", if you will. A must try (at least once).",4.0
"It was my first time visiting this branch of TMS restaurants, I usually go to the Greenwich one. It was more spacious but difficult to see the specials board. Staff were really friendly and helpful with translating a few things on the menu. Our food also came out really fast. I ordered beef meatballs w/spaghetti underneath & the daily special salad. I normally stick with 1 side but the salad just sounded so good with little gem, black beans, cilantro, tomato & lime. It was really good! My fellow diner had spicy pork meatballs w/tomato sauce and cheesy grits. They enjoyed them, but thought the grits were a bit too creamy & rich after eating half the portion.Overall good all round. I have noticed TMS has recently put their prices up, adding $1 per item for meatballs, sides & dessert. So your bill will probably be $5-6 more than it used to be bringing it in line with other similar places and no longer such a bargain price.",4.0
"Probably the best meatballs I've ever had! It was so moist and so full of flavor!Was a spur of the moment decision to grab some Italian food in Williamsburg. There was a short wait, but they take your phone number down and text you when your table is ready. Service was fast. You mark the menu with dry erase pens. There are no pasta dishes, although you can order the pasta as a side dish in addition to your meatball dish. The space is relatively a good size for it's location. There are community tables near the bar area, counter seating, as well as tables if you'd rather done in a more traditional sense. I ordered the spicy pork meatballs with the traditional sauce over a bed of spaghetti. Best decision ever. Also ordered a carafe of their Peach Sangria... OMG it was delicious! So refreshing for a warm summer night. If you are ever craving some Italian. Or just some good ol' spaghetti and meatballs, do come to The Meatball Shop. You'll thank me later. Enjoy!",4.0
"I finally made it to meatball shop!!!! The restaurant is decorated really nice with a modern vintage barn feel if that makes any sense lol. My friend and I came today and got there a little while after the opened, we went to the back and grabbed a table. the menus are set at the tables already and they are menus that you can write on with a dry erase marker and check off what you want to order.Our server came over explained the menu and told us their special ball of the day. The menu isn't huge, but it's definitely hard to choose what you want because everything sounds soo delish. I ended up going with the chicken ball topped with Parmesan sauce and the market salad as a side. My friend got the chicken balls with the mushroom gravy and a side of sautéed broccoli. We also ordered their special ball to split which was a beef mac & cheese ball. The balls were awesomeeeee, so tasty. They serve them in a bowl with a piece of warm bread uhhhhh so good. The one thing I didn't like is they serve the balls out of small bowls, so it's hard to cut them up. Our server was really nice and the restaurant had a fun atmosphere. They seemed to have a crazy amount of takeout orders, and by the time I was leaving so many more people had already walked in to eat. I'll 1000000% be back for some more balls!",4.0
"I apologize. I exhausted all of my ball entendres at the original location in the LES.* So this time, we're actually just going to have a nice, grown-up, mature conversation about balls.

I know some people are into naked balls, but I'm partial to the spicy pork smash myself; I like a good sandwich, and I can handle having my balls smashed. You should get whatever balls you're into though. Don't let anyone tell you your ball preference is obscene, depraved, or disgusting. You do you.Quite simply, this joint offers a reliably delicious, hearty, affordable late night meal that you can count on.

I made the suggestion to try Meatball Shop because well I've heard great things previously and I've been wanting to check this place out for awhile. I've tried all the different balls on the menu, I usually stick with the veggie or the chicken though. My favorite order has probably been the veggie balls, pesto sauce and the simple salad. It's really good and a total twist on a dish that is usually served with pasta. The chicken balls with the parmesan cheese sauce and the white beans is also a great combo to try. My boyfriend on the other hand gets a pretty standard dish beef balls, classic tomato sauce and mashed potatoes. I haven't been here for brunch yet but that is on my to do list as of now.

"The Meatball Shop provided me with one of the best meals I had in New York!! I ate here on the first night of my vacation and contemplated eating here a second time every single night - it was that good!This restaurant is a build-your-own meatball dish establishment with a few pre-determined menu items for those who are challenged at making their own combinations. After contemplating the thousands of options that I could create, I settled on having a spicy pork meatball over polenta with pesto sauce. Oh my goodness, everything was perfect!!! The meatball was a perfect consistency and was not overloaded with bread crumbs and the polenta was sooooo creamy and delicious. Everything was executed perfectly. Now that I am back in California, I am forced to make my own meatballs and polenta and it sadly doesn't measure up.",5.0
"This place is clearly past its prime and just cashing in on its former good food and experience. Just had dinner at the Bedford Ave location and could not have been more disappointed. Not only was the spicy pork meatball I had barely warm when it hit the table, it barely had any flavor. And the music was so loud we could barely communicate with the server, let alone have a conversation. I used to love this place and have eaten there at least 50 times, but I will think twice before going in again. Definitely not as good as it was before.",2.0
"$12 for three meatballs with sauce and four veggie sides. The platter served reminded me of Westville market sides- which is not a bad thing.

Not bad to pop in if one is hungry because it is still a solid choice which is exactly what we did. Do not order the carafe size drinks, not worth it!",3.0

"Tl:dr; amazing execution on such a simple concept.

As far as the balls go, big fan of the spicy pork.The other sides that we got - namely the cauliflower - that was a bit lackluster, hence the 4 stars instead of a resounding 5.

"Spent weekend in NYC, and this was the first place me and my buddy stopped. Don't get me wrong... I'm no fool; I GET the place has ""Meatball"" in its name. But dammmmmnnnn, all they have is pretty much meatballs. Meatball sandwich.. Meatballs in a bowl... Meatballs with bread on the side.. Meatball brunches with egg and Hollandaise sauce..Not a French fry to be served.. Not a ""normal"" type of appetizer to be sold... Straight up meatballs (of different varieties) and alcohol. We went with the ""Fool Aid"" , this is basically adult grape flavored kool-aid. Definitely not bad, but pricey for what is was. After our quart of drink we became a wee bit hungry. So we ordered two meatballs each. He got the spicy pork meatballs with marinara and I got two classis meatballs with marinara. This is where I got disappointed.. I mean the extremely limited menu hurt me a little... But when all you sell is meatballs, I expect that meatball to make me beg for more... OooolalaI didn't get that feeling. We traded one meatball for another so we each had one of the two flavors... At best these meatballs where half decent drunk good. But I've had better sauce from a jar, and the meatballs honestly were disappointing. They tasted no different to me than ones I buy frozen at bj's for a pasta dinner. Overall OK drinks. Very limited menu. Yet pricey. So if all that adds up to a good night out for you then go for it.... Otherwise I'd save this place for your last drunk stop so you can have one last drink and a meatball",2.0
"Pretty darn good, though I didn't feel that the tomato-based sauce was tangy enough to offset the meatiness. Also, I would prefer more bite-sized meatballs instead of the giant mounds they serve you. I would also order some veggies on the side to balance out the meal...you get kind of tired of just eating meat by itself.",3.0
"Jam packed location with same delicious menu of succulent, simple, and over-priced food. But it just tastes so so good. You will not leave disappointed. Be sure to save room for a dessert. The ice cream is delicious, and the cookies are fresh baked.There's something about being here that makes everyone so chatty. The restaurant is bigger than the LES location, but the seats are just as crowded. So you might find yourself chatting with your neighbors or making conversation when you're waiting to use the restrooms. There is definitely a share of partiers here, too, as it's close to some of the bigger clubs. (It helps that the menu is relatively simple!) There's such a buzz.

As far as the balls go, big fan of the spicy pork.The other sides that we got - namely the cauliflower - that was a bit lackluster, hence the 4 stars instead of a resounding 5. Still, vis-a-vis the meatballs, it's an amazing execution on what is a tried and true, amazing concept",4.0
"Went here with friends after a night out at the bar. One word: AMAZINGLYDELICIOUSNESS!  We sat at the bar and it was quick, friendly service. You choose the type of meatball, with your choice of pasta (or rice I think? Can't recall), and you choose a sauce. I got the spicy pork meatball with rigatoni and Parmesan cream sauce and it was just out of this world great. I could've licked the bowl. Great for a date night or out with friends, for the munchies, or after a night out drinking! 5 stars baby",5.0

"Spent weekend in NYC, and this was the first place me and my buddy stopped. Don't get me wrong... I'm no fool; I GET the place has ""Meatball"" in its name. But dammmmmnnnn, all they have is pretty much meatballs. Meatball sandwich.. Meatballs in a bowl... Meatballs with bread on the side.. Meatball brunches with egg and Hollandaise sauce..Not a French fry to be served.. Not a ""normal"" type of appetizer to be sold... Straight up meatballs (of different varieties) and alcohol. We went with the ""Fool Aid"" , this is basically adult grape flavored kool-aid. Definitely not bad, but pricey for what is was. After our quart of drink we became a wee bit hungry. So we ordered two meatballs each. He got the spicy pork meatballs with marinara and I got two classis meatballs with marinara. This is where I got disappointed.. I mean the extremely limited menu hurt me a little... But when all you sell is meatballs, I expect that meatball to make me beg for more... OooolalaI didn't get that feeling. We traded one meatball for another so we each had one of the two flavors... At best these meatballs where half decent drunk good. But I've had better sauce from a jar, and the meatballs honestly were disappointing. They tasted no different to me than ones I buy frozen at bj's for a pasta dinner. Overall OK drinks. Very limited menu. Yet pricey. So if all that adds up to a good night out for you then go for it.... Otherwise I'd save this place for your last drunk stop so you can have one last drink and a meatball",2.0
"Pretty darn good, though I didn't feel that the tomato-based sauce was tangy enough to offset the meatiness. Also, I would prefer more bite-sized meatballs instead of the giant mounds they serve you. I would also order some veggies on the side to balance out the meal...you get kind of tired of just eating meat by itself.",3.0
"Jam packed location with same delicious menu of succulent, simple, and over-priced food. But it just tastes so so good. You will not leave disappointed. Be sure to save room for a dessert. The ice cream is delicious, and the cookies are fresh baked.There's something about being here that makes everyone so chatty. The restaurant is bigger than the LES location, but the seats are just as crowded. So you might find yourself chatting with your neighbors or making conversation when you're waiting to use the restrooms. There is definitely a share of partiers here, too, as it's close to some of the bigger clubs. (It helps that the menu is relatively simple!) There's such a buzz. This spot is great for people watching - and eating!",4.0
"I love me a fat, juicy ball. What better place then to get them at The Meatball Shop?The concept is simple, really. Step 1: Choose your ball - Classic beef, spicy pork, chicken, veggie or special.Step 2: Choose your sauce - Classic tomato, spicy meat sauce, mushroom gravy, parmesan cream, pesto or special.Step 3: Step 3 is totally optional but you can pick a side, to be put under your balls or to the side of them.One order will get you 4 balls, served with Focaccia bread and Parmesan cheese. At $2 a pop, I was expecting some extraordinarily delectable balls.Classic Beef w/ Spicy Tomato Sauce -- Spicy balls, just how I like 'em. The meatballs were generously humongous. I was completely stuffed after eating 1.5 of them. The bread was a perfect pairing as I used it to scoop up all the leftover spicy tomato sauce.

"Sounded interesting so we went here before a show, I do like the style and which you order - marking your selections on laminated menus. I was thrown off because you have to order everything specifically along with your meatballs. Want a salad or pasta, you have to order it separately.

I got the beef meatballs with spicy sauce and the meatballs were good, but I'd expect more being that this is the top draw here and their price. $8 for the meatballs and piece of bread.

"I really wanted to like this place. But certain things aren't meant to be. Came in on Wednesday night. Decent crowd not too busy. Great music mix of r&b, pop and indie. We were seated immediately. Our table was too small so we opted to sit at the bar area facing the kitchen. Big MISTAKE! Server came over immediately to tell us about the special ball of the night (Mac & cheese balls with cheese sauce). He then said he would be back to take our orders. He took longer than expected to come back and take our orders. He asked us if we wanted something to drink we told him to come back while we looked at the menu. Meanwhile he didn't give us any water. We ordered the buffalo chicken balls, I got the beef balls with the spicy meat sauce  my friend got the special balls with spaghetti. We received the buffalo chicken balls super fast. I mean so fast I questioned were they correct. The flavor was decent. Would've better if the would've coated them and if they were hot. The temperature was warm at best. I mean literally the balls were room temperature. That's why we got them so fast they forgot to heat them up.  Soon after the entrees came out. The server still hadn't returned to get our drink orders so we finally asked the runner who brought the food for water. The beef balls in the spicy sauce were okay. For a place to be named the meatball shop I expected better. I felt like I could've made the same meatballs in my kitchen. The mac & cheese balls were good and unique. I couldn't see myself eating more than 1. But they did taste like Mac & cheese and contained pasta which was very clever. The spaghetti was plain and only covering was the cheese sauce that was with the balls. Blah. Half way into our entrees the server came and asked for our drink orders we just got 2 Jell-O shots I was very annoyed. Jell-O shots were good. Should do other flavors. If the mediocre food wasn't bad enough the service and staff made it worse. Work should be fun. But when you have guest sitting at the kitchen area and can see and hear everything that's going on, staff should know how to conduct themselves. First the conversations the kitchen staff were having were ridiculous full of profane, derogatory, obscene, explicit language. I won't write what I heard but it shouldn't be repeated or ever be said in a professional environment. Second were the health code violations I witnessed.  1 girl had her long gray weave hanging down her back in a ponytail. The scarf she wore did nothing for all the hair hanging out with no hair net.  Next was a guy with his hair hanging out of his baseball cap with no hair net on.  Neither should've be been in the kitchen let alone preparing food. Then at one point a guy was sitting on the pick up area for food. At another point a guy was swatting some type of bug with his apron. They were stopping in the middle of making dishes to talk. Not changing gloves frequently enough. The list goes on. The were all just loud rambunctious talking across the restaurant. Totally unacceptable, unprofessional behavior. The server was just slow, clueless and barely checked in. There's a fine line between relaxed, cool hipster vibe and lazy, lack of care unprofessional atmosphere and this place was definitely the latter. I don't ever see myself returning.",1.0
I went here with my family and friend. Overall it was a good experience. We went right when it opened so there were no lines but I could see how it would get loud since the music was quite loud. Overall the food was good. I ordered 4 meatball sliders- all different types of balls and sauces so I could taste and see. I wish they allowed you to have different types of balls in the heros and other dishes so you could taste it. It is a tad on the expensive side. It's $6 for a side which I think is a little bit expensive.,3.0
"The meatballs are amazing!!! This place is great. Meatballs are my fav and this place satisfies the craving. It is busy so you will have to wait, but they have a system in place where they text you when your table is ready. My favorite sauce is pesto. So I pair my pasta with pesto and the meatballs. Omg is this delish. And the drinks aren't to far behind. The drinks are great and of course strong. I've tried the Hemmingway. It was a great compliment to the food. A great experience. Definitely go for the meatballs and the drinks.",4.0
"Couldn't fill ourselves up at the YEE (Fushimi) last night, so we had to find dinner on our own. Ended up seeing TMS right by the L train, so why not? Pretty busy for a late Monday evening, plus this place is much more spacious than the location on the LES. Adeline L. and I were pretty much hungry, but surprised we both couldn't finish either of our meal? The balls are just as good as I remember having them at their other locations. I had the Spicy Pork in Mushroom Gravy. Tasty, tender balls of pig with a kick, which would have been better if only had I chose them to go with their Classic Tomato Sauce. The gravy was good, don't get me wrong. The pesto from Addy's dish was outstanding, wish I could have gotten that, too. Haha, can't always have everything. Sides were on our table as well, Daily Risotto was a creamy spinach risotto topped with parmesan cheese, tasty, but so heavy! I didn't enjoy the Horseradish Turnips as much as by buddy did, the root itself was way too pungent for me. We also shared an ice cream sandwich, so satisfying that we hoped that it would never be the end. The Blueberry Cheesecake tastes exactly like blueberry cheesecake. The Snickerdoodle cookie was sweet, soft, yet chewy.The place felt pretty chill, and I love the rustic chairs. They look exactly like the ones my mom use to sit in, she use to bring me with her to work when I was little, at those Chinese sewing factories. Our meal wouldn't have been so smooth and relaxed if it wasn't because of the friendly pretty lady in a cute red dress attending us for the evening, thank you.",4.0

"I mean who doesn't like balls, really? They're round, meaty, and just fun to eat. Easy fellas, I'm talking about MEATBALLS.Being in Williamsburg, it's no surprise you'll find yourself in the company of hipsters in this bar-like establishment. The vibe is fun and full of energy even at 4PM on a Sunday. Well, it is the weekend after all. We sat straight at the bar and our casual yet cordial bartender greeted us instantly with their drink and food menus. He asked if we were first timers but nope, we've already been to other TMS locations and knew the drill. Order from their laminated menu with a dry erase marker by checking what you want.Each ""Naked Balls"" order consists of 4 balls with parmesan cheese and focaccia bread. 1st: Pick your type of meat---Classic Beef, Spicy Pork, Chicken, Vegetarian, or Special. Unfortunately you cannot mix and match your meats.2nd: Choose your sauce---Classic Tomato, Spicy Meat Sauce, Mushroom Gravy, Parmesan Cream, Pesto, Special3rd: Add family jewels---Fried egg if you will, for an extra $1. Or not.I'll stop there but mind you, their menu still has so much to offer. Sides of starches and greens with an option of having it under or on the side, as well as a selection of sandwiches that you can customize to your liking. Here's what I tried from the Naked Balls section:Classic beef + Mushroom Gravy + Fried Jewel = Perfection! It reminds me of eating a Salisbury steak, only better. The egg adds a richness to this bowl that you can do with or without. I for one am already happy with just the robust and earthy flavor from the mushroom gravy sauce. Classic beef + Parmesan Cream = Amazing! Probably my favorite combo. The sauce is lusciously creamy and oh so delicious. I almost licked my bowl clean. Spicy Pork + Special = Very ballsy! Probably in tribute to Oktoberfest, the sauce itself was made out of beer and mustard. Atleast that's all I remember from everything the bartender said. The spicy pork itself was packed with flavor and just the right heat, while the sauce complemented the balls so well with all its savory goodness--spicy, sour, tarty, and sweet. Mhhmmm..The Meatball Shop...surely the name speaks for itself.",4.0

The bartender who's name is Oj is super attentive. She gives such awesome service. I order the same thing every time which she remembers as soon as I sit down. I'm veggie so I always have the veggie balls. They are the shizzle. Service here is super fast. You can be in and out in less that half an hour.",5.0

If the mediocre food wasn't bad enough the service and staff made it worse. Work should be fun. But when you have guest sitting at the kitchen area and can see and hear everything that's going on, staff should know how to conduct themselves. First the conversations the kitchen staff were having were ridiculous full of profane, derogatory, obscene, explicit language. I won't write what I heard but it shouldn't be repeated or ever be said in a professional environment. Second were the health code violations I witnessed.  1 girl had her long gray weave hanging down her back in a ponytail. The scarf she wore did nothing for all the hair hanging out with no hair net.  Next was a guy with his hair hanging out of his baseball cap with no hair net on.  Neither should've be been in the kitchen let alone preparing food. Then at one point a guy was sitting on the pick up area for food. At another point a guy was swatting some type of bug with his apron. They were stopping in the middle of making dishes to talk. Not changing gloves frequently enough. The list goes on. The were all just loud rambunctious talking across the restaurant. Totally unacceptable, unprofessional behavior. The server was just slow, clueless and barely checked in. There's a fine line between relaxed, cool hipster vibe and lazy, lack of care unprofessional atmosphere and this place was definitely the latter. I don't ever see myself returning.",1.0
I went here with my family and friend. Overall it was a good experience. We went right when it opened so there were no lines but I could see how it would get loud since the music was quite loud. Overall the food was good. I ordered 4 meatball sliders- all different types of balls and sauces so I could taste and see. I wish they allowed you to have different types of balls in the heros and other dishes so you could taste it. It is a tad on the expensive side. It's $6 for a side which I think is a little bit expensive.,3.0
"The meatballs are amazing!!! This place is great. Meatballs are my fav and this place satisfies the craving. It is busy so you will have to wait, but they have a system in place where they text you when your table is ready. My favorite sauce is pesto. So I pair my pasta with pesto and the meatballs. Omg is this delish. And the drinks aren't to far behind. The drinks are great and of course strong. I've tried the Hemmingway. It was a great compliment to the food. A great experience. Definitely go for the meatballs and the drinks.",4.0
"Couldn't fill ourselves up at the YEE (Fushimi) last night, so we had to find dinner on our own. Ended up seeing TMS right by the L train, so why not? Pretty busy for a late Monday evening, plus this place is much more spacious than the location on the LES. Adeline L. and I were pretty much hungry, but surprised we both couldn't finish either of our meal? The balls are just as good as I remember having them at their other locations. I had the Spicy Pork in Mushroom Gravy. Tasty, tender balls of pig with a kick, which would have been better if only had I chose them to go with their Classic Tomato Sauce. The gravy was good, don't get me wrong. The pesto from Addy's dish was outstanding, wish I could have gotten that, too. Haha, can't always have everything. Sides were on our table as well, Daily Risotto was a creamy spinach risotto topped with parmesan cheese, tasty, but so heavy! I didn't enjoy the Horseradish Turnips as much as by buddy did, the root itself was way too pungent for me. We also shared an ice cream sandwich, so satisfying that we hoped that it would never be the end. The Blueberry Cheesecake tastes exactly like blueberry cheesecake. The Snickerdoodle cookie was sweet, soft, yet chewy.The place felt pretty chill, and I love the rustic chairs. They look exactly like the ones my mom use to sit in, she use to bring me with her to work when I was little, at those Chinese sewing factories. Our meal wouldn't have been so smooth and relaxed if it wasn't because of the friendly pretty lady in a cute red dress attending us for the evening, thank you.",4.0
"*** Extremely delicious, Friendly staff, Filling food options *** SO GOOD! They have a location in the city too that I've been to. The servings are always very filling, food is decently priced, and the ambiance is casual, comfortable. I just wish there were more meatballs and more sauce options.",3.0
"Sit at the bar if you can, and get the white beans. Really good (not dry at all) meatballs with options for every sort of diet. Also they were playing a Ja Rule centric playlist which really spoke to my soul.",5.0
"I mean who doesn't like balls, really? They're round, meaty, and just fun to eat. Easy fellas, I'm talking about MEATBALLS.Being in Williamsburg, it's no surprise you'll find yourself in the company of hipsters in this bar-like establishment. The vibe is fun and full of energy even at 4PM on a Sunday. Well, it is the weekend after all. We sat straight at the bar and our casual yet cordial bartender greeted us instantly with their drink and food menus. He asked if we were first timers but nope, we've already been to other TMS locations and knew the drill. Order from their laminated menu with a dry erase marker by checking what you want.Each ""Naked Balls"" order consists of 4 balls with parmesan cheese and focaccia bread. 1st: Pick your type of meat---Classic Beef, Spicy Pork, Chicken, Vegetarian, or Special. Unfortunately you cannot mix and match your meats.2nd: Choose your sauce---Classic Tomato, Spicy Meat Sauce, Mushroom Gravy, Parmesan Cream, Pesto, Special3rd: Add family jewels---Fried egg if you will, for an extra $1. Or not.I'll stop there but mind you, their menu still has so much to offer. Sides of starches and greens with an option of having it under or on the side, as well as a selection of sandwiches that you can customize to your liking. Here's what I tried from the Naked Balls section:Classic beef + Mushroom Gravy + Fried Jewel = Perfection! It reminds me of eating a Salisbury steak, only better. The egg adds a richness to this bowl that you can do with or without. I for one am already happy with just the robust and earthy flavor from the mushroom gravy sauce. Classic beef + Parmesan Cream = Amazing! Probably my favorite combo. The sauce is lusciously creamy and oh so delicious. I almost licked my bowl clean. Spicy Pork + Special = Very ballsy! Probably in tribute to Oktoberfest, the sauce itself was made out of beer and mustard. Atleast that's all I remember from everything the bartender said. The spicy pork itself was packed with flavor and just the right heat, while the sauce complemented the balls so well with all its savory goodness--spicy, sour, tarty, and sweet. Mhhmmm..The Meatball Shop...surely the name speaks for itself.",4.0
"This place is awesome. If you don't like loud atmospheres then don't eat here as the music is normally pumping. I have noticed a few 'oldies' whinging about it but lets get real here... When you walk in, you pretty much get the gist. Why would you order food then moan about it!!!I often am in a rush and sit at the bar on my own during the daytime. The bartender who's name is Oj is super attentive. She gives such awesome service. I order the same thing every time which she remembers as soon as I sit down. I'm veggie so I always have the veggie balls. They are the shizzle. Service here is super fast. You can be in and out in less that half an hour.",5.0
"Dope concept, good food, good drinks, I like it.They got all kinds of balls and sauces. I got the Original Beef Balls and Spicy Pork Balls, both were on point, full of flavor and decent quality meat.  Full bar with many cocktails, I got the Moscow Mule and it was made to perfection.",4.0

The food is consistently good and it's affordable. There is usually hip hop music playing.",3.0
Disappointing meal tonight. Food uninspired and rather unpleasant. Waiter ok. Worst part by far was the non stop rap music only for the 90 minutes we were there. Had to yell across the table to be heard. Pathetic evening. Turn the music down a few decibels from ear splitting. Won't be back.,1.0

"They must have just deep-cleaned the whole restaurant, because this place smelled real funky upon arrival, to the point where I almost walked out, but alas...ice cream sandwiches...Skipped their ""#NationalBurgerDay version of meat on a bun: THE MEATBALL SMASH!"" and went with the Williamsburg special ice cream (strawberry) between their special cookies (peanut pretzel), an order that confused the hell out of the cashier (as did using a gift card toward the transaction)*. The ice cream was sadly a bit overfrozen and had crystallized, and the peanut pretzel cookie was very lackluster, but ice cream sandwiches are inherently satisfying.*Also, presumable trainee, no need to label the Pean Pretz when you're the lone employee, and it was the lone item, and I was the lone customer, but hey, way to delay the takeout process.",3.0

I saw someone order a quinoa plate and I wondered how to order it since I didn't see it on the menu.

"Wanted to check this place out for the longest and finally got a chance to this time around. Took us almost 2 hours to find this place by train and foot.

They stay open til 2AM so this is a go to stop for late night eats for sure. I ordered the kitchen sink w/ a fried egg. 3 original beef meatballs with mushroom gravy over a salad and side of potatoe salad w/ a fried egg on top. I didn't finish my plate, I didn't like it at all. I should've gotten the spicy pork meatballs. My sis ordered it and I was able to taste hers. It was pretty damn good. My friend who went for the special meatball and special sauce was very disappointed. Basically it was cover with BEANS!!!  Not so good! One of the other friend ordered Risotto which was quite tasty. Overall food was blah...I guess u just have to order the right thing. (spicy Pork)",3.0
"Food: Juicy, scrumptious, and tasty meatballs. The best options, in my opinion are the meatball sandwich on a brioche bun and the creamy parmesan sauce with mashed potatoes...SO GOOD!  Also be SURE to try out some samplers. Those little burger bites will blow you mind. They have a whole bunch of flavors to choose from. I suggest the spicy sauce, parmesan, and the pesto. Finally, the dessert is amazing.

And I had the special lemonade, which was rhubarb - bit on the sweet side, but tasty nonetheless. Our waitress was super sweet and genuine and overall we were pleased with our experience! One big downside is that the bathroom was kind of smelly and gross - and you know how they say the cleanliness of a restaurant bathroom reflects the cleanliness of its kitchen.

The spicy pork meatball is too soft and not spicy at all. It tasted very mushy and the white sauce has a strong smell that made me totally lose my appetite after few bites.

"LOVE THIS PLACE! I'm a vegetarian so it's great to be able to experience a ""meatball"" once in a while!! I ordered the veggie meatball hero with mushrooms & a creamy sauce (forgot what it was called) on a whole wheat roll and it was DELICIOUS!!!  My boyfriend got meatball parm on a roll and loved his too. I would definitely recommend this place to ANYONE!  Atmosphere is chill & laid back, wooden walls & candle mason jars everywhere. Definitely a spot you would expect when you think of Williamsburg! You won't regret trying this place out!",5.0
"This was like, the 2nd best time I've had putting balls in my mouth (and that's saying a lot!).No but seriously folks...holy shitsnacks is this place legit! Literally every single thing we ordered was perfect. I was with 2 friends, so the 3 of us each ordered different balls in different sauces (hey-o!) and 3 different sides, and I could not have been more pleased with our ball choices.(I am having more fun writing this review than I ever have before)We closed out our experience by building our own ice cream sammiches. The brown sugar ice cream is frickin' the business!The website says they deliver, which must be cool, if you live in Brooklyn. I am, alas, in Milwaukee, and unless they add drone delivery so I can FINALLY get teabagged by a robot, I guess I'll have to wait to get more (meat)balls in my mouth!(please don't tag this as inappropriate) (or you do you, whatever, i can't stop you)",5.0
"Biggest icecream sandwiches ever.By big I mean HUGE and oh so perfect.I tried the chocolate cookie sandwich with mint icecream and my person got the snickerdoodle cookie with brown sugar icecream. In my opinion, mine was better because the mint icecream was just so good and tasted like fresh mint and cream. Yum! He also loved his but the brown sugar icecream was very very sweet. A little too sweet for me but perfect for others.I love how you can customize your sandwich however you like by picking from a variety of about 6 cookies and many types of delicious icecream flavors. Their menus are plastic like mini white boards, you check off what you would like from the menu with erasable markers. So fun and really cute for a date.This was a spontaneous sweet tooth craving adventure but next time we'll have to try the much raved about meatballs. They looked great on everyone else's plates.

"Love this Meatball Shop location in Brooklyn. The food and service is much better than when I first went to The Meatball Shop in Manhattan.     The service is quick and the staff is very friendly. I like how the menu is like a mini blackboard. You can mark you order with a dry eraser marker  and give your order to the waitress/ waiter when you are ready to order. When I asked what they recommend is best to try, I was not disappointed at all! Great recommendations and the Daily Menu is a must try because it only appears daily LOL      So I visited this Meatball twice in a week. First time was a sit in and the second time was a takeout. Overall all both time my food was excellent. When I ate in, I had Naked Balls of classic beef with Parmesan Sauce and a side of the Daily Kale Salad. The second time I ordered take out, which I had the Daily Naked Balls, Steak bacon cheddar with Parmesan Sauce. The daily balls was one of the best meatball I had ever tried. It was a great taste of meaty beef. I also had the Naked Balls of Spicy Pork with rigatoni under and the sauce was Parmesan sauce. It tasted amazing, the spicy pork wasn't too spicy but the combine of rigatoni and balls in a Parmesan sauce is great! (You can tell that I always ordered the naked balls with Parmesan sauce because that sauce is so creamy and velvety). The side was the Daily Risotto Corn, leek, and chives. It tasted creamy and delicious flavor of corn with leek. I ordered a Daily special Drink which was a lemonade plum. The drink was bubbly with fizz and the tasted sweet with a hint of sour from the lemonade. It was a the best lemonade soda type.  I would totally recommend this place to anyone who love meatballs!",5.0
This place is definitely over hyped. Waited 30 mins to get inside. The food is okay but the meatballs seem frozen and for what it is one can make better food at home. I think even IKEA Swedish frozen meatballs beats this.,3.0
"Service and food doesn't seem to be on par as their other city locations like the LES one.Came in with 5 people for lunch and started off with a pitcher of Sangria.

Instead he just past a bunch of paper towels to do it ourselves... Ok sure that's fine. 15 minutes later... We still have that whole pile of paper towel with ice melting thru it now in the middle of our table. I had to call him over myself to take it away.Risotto and rigatoni were a little too undercooked for me. I understand al dente, I like al dente, but I can't say this enough, timing is important. Sent the rigatoni back because it was too cold, hard and chewy then ended getting spaghetti which was better and even came to us hot. The risotto wasn't creamy even and the rice was too hard as well.

To my disappointment the food here was just alright... and my meal was cold. I ordered the meatball sliders so I could get a sample of their different flavors: beef with spicy meat sauce, pork with parmesan cream sauce, and chicken with pesto sauce. The spicy meat sauce was OK it was nothing special, and the beef meatballs were a little bland. The pork was probably the best meatball but the parmesan cream sauce was a little cold and not very flavorful.. just salty. The chicken meatball too was alright, however, I did very much enjoy the pesto sauce (you can never really go wrong with pesto). On top of that, the bread lacked any sort of flavor. It was very plain. I also sampled the spaghetti side dish, again bland and nothing spectacular about the flavor.There are plenty of tables as well as bar seating, great ambience and music too.Perhaps it was the fact that we ate here at 2AM, but still I was expecting better quality.

I'm a fan of TMS especially when they offer the Pizza specialty ball with the cheesy parmesan cream sauce.  Also try the buffalo chicken served with bleu cheese--its a hot wing without the bones!

Good restaurant concept and it's obviously very popular but it didn't blow me away. It also takes a while to get your food.

One of my meatballs was also a little burnt and the texture was tough.

"One of my favorite stops in Brooklyn is the Meatball Shop.I love the ambience here, it's a bar type atmosphere along with great service and of course delicious meatballs. When you place your order, you're given a laminated menu with a dry erase marker and then check marking your preferences. You choose 1 kind of Ball + Sauce choice. There is five ball choices to choose from: Classic Beef, Spicy Pork, Chicken, Veggie and Special. The Sauce flavors they offer were: Classic Tomato, Spicy Meat Sauce, Mushroom Gravy, Parmesan Cream, Pesto and Special.We went with Spicy Pork with Spicy Meat Sauce. This combination was very tasty. The Spicy Pork Meat was tender and it had that seasoned peppered touch to it.  The Spicy Meat Sauce had a rich tomato flavor and it complimented the meatballs and mozzarella cheese well. Overall it was tasted like a pizza. The bread stick that came with it, had me dipping into the meat sauce to the last scrape. Our other custom meatball choice was with Classic Beef with Mushroom Gravy and topped with Family Jewels = fried eggs. This one tasted simple, but the added mushroom gravy and fried eggs turned out to be as hearty like a breakfast meal all in one bowl. I had to go with a cocktail drink while enjoying what was to me an awesome stop over snack for the day. So I went with the Hot Buttered Rum. Its warm, sweet, it was an absolute delight to have with the meatballs and the atmosphere.The stuff here is pricey but well worth it, if you're ballin'!",5.0
"This place is a bomb spot. The service was great the moment we walked up to the hosts. They greeted us and tried to get us he first seats available and were in communication with us the whole wait. Our wait wasn't bad (5 min), but I could see how it could easily be 15-20 min at a busy time. The music was on point, for my taste at least. I have never been to a place that plays 2pac, eminem, and Jay-z. The food is really fun and just as delicious. You can customize your order in every way from the meat to the sauce to your sides (we did this for dessert too; the brown sugar and chocolate chip cookie ice cream sandwich hit the spot). In general, let's just say I can't wait to go back.",5.0
I've been here a few times and I could surely say that they have pretty good meatballs.

"Seeing as this is my 10th visit I decided it was time to do a review. As far as popular expanding restaurants go, this place is still very much true to its roots. You get an awesome meatball with some tasty sides. They do this very well and I hope they open up some more locations in the NY area (Long Island and Queens please). There really isn't anything bad to say. Just some tips. It gets very busy so for dinner hour on the weekend be prepared to wait. The BK spot is bigger than the Manhattan one but there is still an hour wait after 9pm. Call ahead but I do not think they take reservations. Try everything at least once. They always have special menu items so try them. They may not make it back on the menu for a while if ever. Price is not too damaging to your wallet and I would say its a much cheaper meal then some of the casual and fancy fare in the area. The staff is really really nice and I have never had a problem with service. Meatball shop is one of the best and they deserve all the kudos.",5.0
"The place was cute, nice little hangout.Tables are cramped.Food is pricy, portions are small. And on top of that, it's pretty bland.$20 dollars for four tiny meat balls and a little pasta and sauce that literally to me resembled a microwave TV dinner, also, not to mention in that $20 was a $3 Coke that was barely half a can. Safe to say I won't be going there again.",1.0

This one tasted simple, but the added mushroom gravy and fried eggs turned out to be as hearty like a breakfast meal all in one bowl. I had to go with a cocktail drink while enjoying what was to me an awesome stop over snack for the day. So I went with the Hot Buttered Rum. Its warm, sweet, it was an absolute delight to have with the meatballs and the atmosphere.The stuff here is pricey but well worth it, if you're ballin'!",5.0
"This place is a bomb spot. The service was great the moment we walked up to the hosts. They greeted us and tried to get us he first seats available and were in communication with us the whole wait. Our wait wasn't bad (5 min), but I could see how it could easily be 15-20 min at a busy time. The music was on point, for my taste at least. I have never been to a place that plays 2pac, eminem, and Jay-z. The food is really fun and just as delicious. You can customize your order in every way from the meat to the sauce to your sides (we did this for dessert too; the brown sugar and chocolate chip cookie ice cream sandwich hit the spot). In general, let's just say I can't wait to go back.",5.0
I've been here a few times and I could surely say that they have pretty good meatballs. They usually have pretty good market salads to go along with your meal and for dessert the ice cream sandwich is a must! The restaurant has very cool hipster decoration and is in a great spot. Their sangria is also perfectly on point and so is the Jell-O shots !!!,5.0
"I've never been disappointed by this place, no matter what time I go! It's always a friendly atmosphere with good simple food. Shout out to the market plate, it's always a safe bet!",5.0
"Seeing as this is my 10th visit I decided it was time to do a review. As far as popular expanding restaurants go, this place is still very much true to its roots. You get an awesome meatball with some tasty sides. They do this very well and I hope they open up some more locations in the NY area (Long Island and Queens please). There really isn't anything bad to say. Just some tips. It gets very busy so for dinner hour on the weekend be prepared to wait. The BK spot is bigger than the Manhattan one but there is still an hour wait after 9pm. Call ahead but I do not think they take reservations. Try everything at least once. They always have special menu items so try them. They may not make it back on the menu for a while if ever. Price is not too damaging to your wallet and I would say its a much cheaper meal then some of the casual and fancy fare in the area. The staff is really really nice and I have never had a problem with service. Meatball shop is one of the best and they deserve all the kudos.",5.0
"The place was cute, nice little hangout.Tables are cramped.Food is pricy, portions are small. And on top of that, it's pretty bland.$20 dollars for four tiny meat balls and a little pasta and sauce that literally to me resembled a microwave TV dinner, also, not to mention in that $20 was a $3 Coke that was barely half a can. Safe to say I won't be going there again.",1.0

"Good price, good good.  The broccoli cheddar risotto was delicious, the spicy pork meatballs were very good seasoned.  I had the pesto sauce, over done on the olive oil, bext tume I won't get that sauce.  The special summer squash with Moroccan yogurt sauce was ok.  The Cantaloupe Lemonade was tasty and refreshing.  Id definitely go back.",4.0
"Fast service on a Thursday night! Their restaurant service is very friendly and efficient. I had their special lemonade of the night...cantaloupe lemonade! (I got a refill, it was so good)I got meatball sliders (spicy pork with classic tomato sauce, and chicken with mushroom gravy) Delicious! My favorite was the chicken with mushroom gravy. The sliders were $3 each and were pretty small. (Think one meatball on a tiny tiny bun.) It's a cheap eat if you're not very hungry. I HIGHLY recommend the chocolate chip cookie ice cream sandwich with BROWN SUGAR ICE CREAM!!! HUGE scoop of cold ice cream, not melted and not frozen solid, and 2 big, fresh chocolate chip cookies. Priced at $6, that might have been the best ice cream sandwich I have ever had. (And I've had a lot of ice cream... it's an obsession.) I'll be back... :)",5.0

"My friend was excited about exploring Williamsburg, but we were hungry and used Yelp to find a highly rate place that has a bit of the ""hipster"" vibe she was looking for.

Overall good experience.",4.0
"I adore this place. The food is to die for! From the various meatballs to diversity of sauce choices to the ice cream cookie sandwiches, I always satisfied after a visit. My favorite meal is the ""everything and the kitchen sink"" which is a salad topped with meatballs and mixed vegetables. It's awesome!!! The ice cream cookie sandwiches are awesome especially since you can mix and match cookie flavors. You must go here if you haven't been. The wait can be long on Friday or Saturday nights but if you can wait, you won't be disappointed. I highly recommend the Brooklyn location. They play old school hip hop and has a cooler vibe than the Manhattan locations in my opinion.",5.0

"Rustic, antique setting to hit up some awesome meatballs both in the classical sense and along with some pretty cool ideas. I had the regular, spicy beef, spicy pork and chicken. For sauces, I had spicy meat and the pesto. I had a side of broccoli which was seasoned perfectly to compliment my meatball overload. But the best dish I had was their appetizer special - mini buffalo balls. It is by far the best balls of chicken I've ever had in my life. The price was on point for this joint. Very lively with friendly service. Al Capone is not rolling around in his grave.",4.0
"I've been going to this Meatball Shop regularly since they opened. The food is solid but what really keeps me going is their excellent service.  Sometimes a new person will be a bit slow, but every single person I've encountered - every cashier, cook, host, and bartender - has been beyond friendly.  The menu is deceptively simple.  A lot of thought goes into each of their dishes, especially their market salad, daily veg, and risotto specials, which take advantage of seasonal ingredients.  Their kitchen sink salad also changes with the seasons, and I usually get it with the special balls and sauce.  Which ball do I prefer?  I love all of their balls and all of their sauces, so it really depends on what kind of mood you're in.  But I don't think you can find a juicier chicken meatball anywhere.  The sides are delicious too - the pasta is always perfectly al dente and they are very generous with the aged parmesan cheese, which I cannot say of every other Italian restaurant  I've ever been to.  My family loves the hero and brioche sandwiches and they come with a generous salad, which I am grateful for, so that nobody tries to eat any of my salad.I usually get my order to go but the dining room is casual, fun, and high energy, with an open kitchen and a lively rap and r&b soundtrack.  It's the perfect place for a date or dinner with friends or family or even just drinks, as they do have a full bar and constantly changing cocktail specials.",5.0

"I've finally visited The Meatball Shop (for my birthday) and it was just as amazing as everyone told me it would be! We arrived on a Monday at 7pm and were immediately seated. We ordered drinks, and then our waitress went over the specials and explained how to order. Our food came out maybe 5 minutes after we ordered. So fast! I got the spicy pork meatballs over spinach and leek risotto with the parmesan cream sauce. I was a little stressed out because I wasn't sure if I ordered the ""right"" combination but the dish ended up being phenomenal! The flavors blended together really well, the risotto was cooked perfectly and the cream sauce brought everything together. So good! I don't even remember what the boyfriend got. My dish was better though. For dessert, we shared an ice cream sandwich - chocolate chip with vanilla ice cream - which was the perfect ending to an excellent meal.Everything was perfect!

"I visited on 09/09/15 for a pre-bday dinner with my bff at around 5:30pm- she is a regular here so she suggested it. Normally, i am not a fan of meatballs, however, i was blown away.

I also had a side of roasted veggies and green beans; the green beans were delicious as well - I wasn't a fan of the roasted veggies because it was zucchini, I hate zucchini. I was too full for dessert, but My friend got some, she had a snickerdoodle brown sugar ice cream sandwich (and she ended up ordering me a cornbread cookie so they could sing happy birthday for me- all the sweets were delicious.

"I was visiting New York and went here on a recommendation as a ""must try"" from friends in the area.The menu has everything you'd imagine - meatballs of various meats with different sauces (from marinara to mushroom). You can order them ""naked"" with a side of focaccia, on a roll, on some veggies etc.I ended up ordering ""the kitchen sink"" which was my choice of meatballs and sauce over chef's selection of veggies. I opted for the classic beef meatballs with meat sauce, per my friend's recommendation. Overall, it was very tasty but not out of this world. If I hadn't already eaten my weights worth of pizza on my trip, I might've opted for the meatball sandwich.There was no wait on a sunny Sunday afternoon. Prices were decent for the area. Paid around $17 with tip for my balls and a cold brew.Bottom line - If you're in the area and like balls of meat, give it a shot. You won't regret it.",4.0

This place is somewhere you do not go with a lot of people due to its size.I ordered meatballs with cheese, and literally the cheese came on the side which was beyond me since I would have melted the cheese on top? I guess I'm different. Nonetheless, it was yummy. There wasn't anything extremely special about the place but I would definitely go again. If I am in the mood for meatballs I would definitely return, but I would not say this place is to ""die for.""The service is definitely amazing, they are really nice. I had the brownie cookie ice cream sandwich and I hated it. They swapped out the cookie without any problem which I truly appreciated.",4.0
"Yum! Chicken balls under risotto with creamy Parmesan sauce was super delicious. Burnt orange margarita was also awesome. Our server, Johnston, was great which is refreshing since every time I eat out in Williamsburg, the service always sucks, I don't know if that's due to all the entitled rich kid residents of WillyB or what but they always suck and they're rude so thanks for not sucking! I'll be back for that ice cream sandwich!! Oh and decent prices too, got an app, 2 entrees, and 2 drinks for $60 before tip.",5.0
"I got the kitchen salad which is 3 balls plus sauce over a bed of greens and vegetables for $11. I sampled the veggie balls and they were tiny but yummy. We went in the early evening so the place was pretty deserted, but by the end of the meal people had started to fill in adding to the ambiance.I haven't been back since and don't see myself going out of the way to do so because it was just okay.",3.0
"What a cool concept Meatball plates and meatballs done well!  Sit at the bar more Action Jackson,  I went in totally sh$t faced from the surf bar round the corner....It was busy as hell but  we got served quickly!  So glad I did not get thrown out for chanting On top of Mushroom gravy all covered with love I lost my poor meatball when Michael Jackson swiped it with his sparkly glove....It rolled off the table and on the the floor, my poor little meatball shop meatball rolled right out the door..Then I grabbed my crotch and screamed weeeehhhhh whhhhhho chica con....Seriously though I would like to thank the staff for putting up with my drunk lavish ways!  I believe the ice cream sammich calmed me down and then every one sipped on there perfectly poured glass of wine and carried on! Mary S. From Dallas was here....Yeeeee-hawwwww Lets do this again! Don't forget to grab a cookbook- I have a signed copy sitting in my reading room!",5.0
Amazeballs. (see what I did there?) I had a couple of sliders and the daily roasted vegetables. Phenom! And the way you order allows you to pick the right portion for you which is so convenient.The drink special was a blueberry and blackberry margarita which was so refreshing. Sorta wished I ordered another after I left. Can't wait to go back!,5.0
"Perfect spot for late night food.  Couldn't be happier with our decision to eat here.  Great food and atmosphere.   The best combination is the chicken meatball in Parmesan sauce over risotto.  I promise.  Plus, Customize your own ice cream sandwich with different flavors of ice cream and cookies!!",5.0
"It's yummy, but it's way overpriced. $8 for 4 small meatballs without a side it's insane. Make your portions bigger or lower your prices. But I guess you won't because stupid hipsters don't mind paying that much of their parents' money.",2.0

"I'd visited The Meatball Shop a few times at their Chelsea location and had positive experiences, so had a good idea of what to expect as far as casual ambiance and good quality of food. We were seated immediately at about 12:45 on a Sunday afternoon and received our food about 15 minutes after ordering. I ordered 2 meatball sliders (chicken with parm cream and classic beef with spicy meat sauce) along with a side of spinach. The portion size was just enough to leave me full without being stuffed.

"Went to The Meatball Shop after going to the Music Hall of Williamsburg one night a few weeks ago. The place is really great. They have kind of a rustic design going on inside and they were playing great old school hip hop.Aside from the ambience, we got the naked classic meatballs, risotto and daily roast veggies.

I found the mustard greens with cherries to be a bit too sweet & the mashed potatoes were just ok.

"Love coming here for lunch! My favorite thing to get are the spicy meatballs with classic tomato sauce, along with rigatoni and sautéed broccoli on the side. Ahhhh SCRUMPTIOUS! For drinks, try the pineapple blood orange bitches brew, which is pretty much pale lager mixed with pineapple (duh), blood orange (duh), strawberry, lemon juice, some other citrus-y flavors. Meatballs are huge (with parmesan cheese on top if you wish) and a piece of focaccia bread. It's always pretty crowded, but in my experience, the wait has never been long and the service is fairly quick. Prices are great as well.",5.0
"I wasn't sure what to expect, but the Meatball Shop gave me a new perspective on meatballs and their use!

"The Meatball Shop is one of those places I've been wanting to go to for years after hearing and seeing this place all across the tv on Food Network, Cooking Channel and various foodie magazines. After spending part of the day strolling in Williamsburg, I accidentally stumbled upon the restaurant and decided to go in for lunch.The restaurant is small and has a nicely set up bar. I was alone and asked for a table but they kind of kept pushing me to sit at the bar or the counter area by the window. (Note to establishments: Lone diners don't always want to sit at the bar!) Luckily they obliged.My server wasn't exactly attentive but she wasn't down right terrible. I will say it was enough to make the leap from a four to a three star. Good thing I liked the meatballs. ;)I ended up ordering 5 naked balls separate (i wanted to try different flavors!) but it ended up being way too much! The balls are medium sized, tender and flavorful but dense for a meatball. I got 3 classic beef with tomato sauce and 2 classic beef with mushroom gravy. I actually preferred the mushroom gravy, the tomato was a bit lackluster. A diner next to me said she loved all the other sauces compared to the tomato ironically as well.Several sides to choose from like mashed potatoes, risotto, spaghetti, polenta, etc. They also have salads so the Yelpers who said otherwise clearly didn't read the menu. I do find them to bit expensive though, $5. The daily risotto I got was broccoli and cheddar. It was creamy cheesy goodness but a few grains where underdone.TMS also has some interesting cocktails. There's one that's supposed to taste like a ""grown up""version of Kool-Aid named Fool-Aid, I will have to try that next time! Meatballs were awesome and I WILL be back but I think the original or Manhattan Meatball Shop may be the way to go.

"I get the Pizza is delicious in New York but the best food I had in my entire week of visiting New York was The Meatball Shop, hands down. I think about the Meatball Shop everyday.",5.0
"First you get a menu where you mark what you want. You can something that's already created or create your own. It's an interesting concept. For specials look at the chalkboard and it'll have listing of everyday specialsFood:I ordered spicy meatballs with mushroom gravy sauce and mashed potato on the bottom. I liked the mashed potato but wish I got it on the side instead. The food overall was good but it wasn't great.My husband ordered spicy meatballs with Parmesan sauce and grounded polenta on the side, I thought the sauce was bit salty. The spicy meat isn't that spicy.Drinks: my husband ordered virgin Bloody Mary which he loved because it was spicy and I ordered the cranberry lemonade. I could not taste the lemon or the cranberry. It was just sweet and sparkly. Dessert: we got the ginger cookie and brown sugar ice cream and I think their dessert is much better than the food. The cookie was soft and melted in our mouth.Service: I really liked the service, our waitress was attentive and nice. The food comes out pretty fast.Overall we loved the concept and the atmosphere but food was mediocre/ok. It's worth checking out at least once. Would come back for dessert though.one star for the concept and atmosphere, one star for the service and one star for the dessert.",3.0
"My first meal in Williamsburg and my first time having meatballs specifically for dinner!  This joint was packed on a Tuesday night.  Hipsters and young families everywhere you turned.  Not necessarily drawn to any particular dish off their menu, so I decided to go with their sliders so I would be able to try a variety of meatballs.  I should have ordered 3, rather than 2 because they were on the tiny side.  I believe the vegetable side special I had ordered was separate from the sliders -- it was a combination of zucchini, squash... and some other veggies.  The two sliders were chicken and pesto & spicy meat and beef...  I was pleased with the flavors of the two.  I thought the veggies were a little on the salty side though, I did eat them all.  I wish the sliders were a tad bigger... I had pictured them differently.",3.0
"Great place to eat and hangout with friends. I been here a couple of times. I really enjoy their food and mix drinks. I started with the salad it was so fresh.  I love it!Then I got the classic meatball sandwich it was delicious. The bread, sauce and meat were fresh ingredients which made then taste even better. I also like the decor so unique. Then I got one the shots they had on special. It was a jello shot not bad for $5 my table got several.  Good times. Will be back to try out more stuff.",4.0
"I was exploring Williamsburgh and decided to stop in here for dinner after seeing how many locals seemed to be walking in. The place was full with the after-work crowd and the drinks here seem to be very popular.Nonetheless I sat myself down at the bar and ordered the spicy pork meatballs with tomato sauce over a salad.I think the big attraction people have to meatballs is that it reminds them of being a kid. Show me one kid who DOESN'T like meatballs, I doubt there is one out there. That said, the meatballs were huge, flavorful and quite filling. and came on a bed of greens and a side of hummus and veggies. It wasn't the most amazing meatballs I've ever had (I save that space for the ones I had in India and in Turkey,  they are called ""Kofta"" or ""Kofte"" there) but they were enjoyable.I was too full to try out their ice-cream and ice-cream sandwiches but several people around me had ordered them and they definitely look like something worth trying out for the next time.If you're in Williamsburgh, hungry and thirsty, this is as good a place as any to sit down, take a breather and tuck into comfort-food eats.",4.0

"First you get a menu where you mark what you want. You can something that's already created or create your own. It's an interesting concept. For specials look at the chalkboard and it'll have listing of everyday specialsFood:I ordered spicy meatballs with mushroom gravy sauce and mashed potato on the bottom. I liked the mashed potato but wish I got it on the side instead. The food overall was good but it wasn't great.My husband ordered spicy meatballs with Parmesan sauce and grounded polenta on the side, I thought the sauce was bit salty. The spicy meat isn't that spicy.Drinks: my husband ordered virgin Bloody Mary which he loved because it was spicy and I ordered the cranberry lemonade. I could not taste the lemon or the cranberry. It was just sweet and sparkly. Dessert: we got the ginger cookie and brown sugar ice cream and I think their dessert is much better than the food. The cookie was soft and melted in our mouth.Service: I really liked the service, our waitress was attentive and nice. The food comes out pretty fast.Overall we loved the concept and the atmosphere but food was mediocre/ok. It's worth checking out at least once. Would come back for dessert though.one star for the concept and atmosphere, one star for the service and one star for the dessert.",3.0
"My first meal in Williamsburg and my first time having meatballs specifically for dinner!  This joint was packed on a Tuesday night.  Hipsters and young families everywhere you turned.  Not necessarily drawn to any particular dish off their menu, so I decided to go with their sliders so I would be able to try a variety of meatballs.  I should have ordered 3, rather than 2 because they were on the tiny side.  I believe the vegetable side special I had ordered was separate from the sliders -- it was a combination of zucchini, squash... and some other veggies.  The two sliders were chicken and pesto & spicy meat and beef...  I was pleased with the flavors of the two.  I thought the veggies were a little on the salty side though, I did eat them all.  I wish the sliders were a tad bigger... I had pictured them differently.",3.0
"Great place to eat and hangout with friends. I been here a couple of times. I really enjoy their food and mix drinks. I started with the salad it was so fresh.  I love it!Then I got the classic meatball sandwich it was delicious. The bread, sauce and meat were fresh ingredients which made then taste even better. I also like the decor so unique. Then I got one the shots they had on special. It was a jello shot not bad for $5 my table got several.  Good times. Will be back to try out more stuff.",4.0
"I was exploring Williamsburgh and decided to stop in here for dinner after seeing how many locals seemed to be walking in. The place was full with the after-work crowd and the drinks here seem to be very popular.Nonetheless I sat myself down at the bar and ordered the spicy pork meatballs with tomato sauce over a salad.I think the big attraction people have to meatballs is that it reminds them of being a kid. Show me one kid who DOESN'T like meatballs, I doubt there is one out there. That said, the meatballs were huge, flavorful and quite filling. and came on a bed of greens and a side of hummus and veggies. It wasn't the most amazing meatballs I've ever had (I save that space for the ones I had in India and in Turkey,  they are called ""Kofta"" or ""Kofte"" there) but they were enjoyable.I was too full to try out their ice-cream and ice-cream sandwiches but several people around me had ordered them and they definitely look like something worth trying out for the next time.If you're in Williamsburgh, hungry and thirsty, this is as good a place as any to sit down, take a breather and tuck into comfort-food eats.",4.0

"Pros: very friendly service, very fast service, good tasting foodCons: uncomfortable chairs, not a large menu selection (but that's not surprising considering the name of the venue) The Meatball Shop has 6 locations around NYC and this was my first visit to one.

"3.5 stars...I love the design and concept of this place. I especially like that this location is twice the size of their original location in Manhattan. For those not familiar with these guys, this is how it works: After you're seated, you get a dry erase menu and a black marker to check off whatever you want before handing it to your server. The meatballs come in classic beef, spicy pork, chicken, vegetarian and special (rotating flavor). You can get them in a number of sauces (classic tomato, spicy meat, mushroom/onion, cream, and pesto). You can get your meatballs naked (4 in a bowl) for $7, on a slider for $3 each, a hero (has 3) for $10. They have about a dozen side options ($5 each) that can be served on the side or below the meatballs (which is case primarily for a side of spaghetti or rigatoni). They also have a full bar as well with everything from cheap cans of beer to fancy cocktails. I ordered a bowl of rigatoni and classic beef meatballs in a spicy meat sauce ($12). The portion was just right and the pasta was cooked perfectly. The sauce was solid but  the meatballs weren't all that great. They tasted very much like pork, it was very dense with a smooth texture and tiny  bit of  gristle to it. I thought there had been a mix-up with the order but the server assured me that he took my order correctly for classic beef. Whether it was a mix up or just not that great of a meatball, I took away a full star. As much as this place focuses on meatballs, they should be known just as much for their dessert. Ice cream sandwiches! Sandwiches are $5 (ice cream alone is $3 and cookies alone are $1.50 each). You can choose two different cookies (Chocolate Chip, Peanut Butter, Brownie with walnuts, Snickerdoodle, Ginger Snap, and Special) and the ice cream to go along with it (Chocolate, Vanilla, Espresso, Mint, Caramel, Special). I went with chocolate ice cream with a chocolate chip cookie and a graham cookie (special). The graham cookie tasted nothing like a graham cracker and was a little too spongy. The chocolate chip cookie was really good though. Overall the cookies were too small and the ice cream was too much to eat this thing like a sandwich but I enjoyed eating the pieces separately anyway. The ice cream was one of the best scoops of ice cream I've ever had, it was quite remarkable. The place had more pluses than minuses but between the prices being a tad high and the meatballs being a little disappointing, I may have to give the shop a little break before I come back.",3.0
"Great place! LOYAL customer. Always get the Kitchen Sink with a spec lemonade. Also read the review below and have to say I love the curly ""smile averse"" host.

"This is the place you come to if you want good meatballs. It doesn't get much simpler than that. I got spicy pork meatballs with mushroom gravy and arugula and apple salad. Great meal... no complaints.The logistics were great. It was super crowded on Friday night, but it only took 30 minutes to wait for a table. In the meantime, I sat at the bar.

"Craving a late night meatball in Brooklyn?  Well lucky you... the Meatball Shop is one of the better late night options in the Williamsburg area.  I love the fact that you can mix and match the meatball types with the sauce and the side.  The last time I was in town I went with the beef meatballs, in pesto sauce, over pasta.  Delicious pesto sauce.  The friends went with the spicy pork meatballs with red sauce over mashed potatoes.  Both types were great, although I do think the pork balls are a bit tastier.Price wise it's not too bad either.  $7 gets you four hefty meatballs.  The sauce and the side bring you up to about $14 total.  It's a good size meal and fairly standard New York pricing.",4.0

"Love that we have TMS in the neighborhood! I eat here regularly and find everything pretty dang good. We love to order the ""Kitchen Sink"" to load up on fresh and pickled veggies. I actually find the food rather healthy and balanced, although I frequently indulge in their cookies and ice cream. Only thing I wish is that they'd offer a quality ginger beer, or let me BYOGB to wash down those meatballzz.",4.0
"Great late night snack, especially on the weekends. 4 meatballs (one kind, no mix and match) for $8. I got the chicken with mushroom sauce. They have heroes, sandwiches, and ice cream sandwiches too. Saw Anne Hathaway at this spot.",4.0
Came here for the first time on Saturday and I'm so glad that I did! The veggie meatballs are out of this world! I recommend pairing this with mashed potatoes and red sauce. Your tummy will be so happy!,4.0
"3.5 stars...I love the design and concept of this place. I especially like that this location is twice the size of their original location in Manhattan. For those not familiar with these guys, this is how it works: After you're seated, you get a dry erase menu and a black marker to check off whatever you want before handing it to your server. The meatballs come in classic beef, spicy pork, chicken, vegetarian and special (rotating flavor). You can get them in a number of sauces (classic tomato, spicy meat, mushroom/onion, cream, and pesto). You can get your meatballs naked (4 in a bowl) for $7, on a slider for $3 each, a hero (has 3) for $10. They have about a dozen side options ($5 each) that can be served on the side or below the meatballs (which is case primarily for a side of spaghetti or rigatoni). They also have a full bar as well with everything from cheap cans of beer to fancy cocktails. I ordered a bowl of rigatoni and classic beef meatballs in a spicy meat sauce ($12). The portion was just right and the pasta was cooked perfectly. The sauce was solid but  the meatballs weren't all that great. They tasted very much like pork, it was very dense with a smooth texture and tiny  bit of  gristle to it. I thought there had been a mix-up with the order but the server assured me that he took my order correctly for classic beef. Whether it was a mix up or just not that great of a meatball, I took away a full star. As much as this place focuses on meatballs, they should be known just as much for their dessert. Ice cream sandwiches! Sandwiches are $5 (ice cream alone is $3 and cookies alone are $1.50 each). You can choose two different cookies (Chocolate Chip, Peanut Butter, Brownie with walnuts, Snickerdoodle, Ginger Snap, and Special) and the ice cream to go along with it (Chocolate, Vanilla, Espresso, Mint, Caramel, Special). I went with chocolate ice cream with a chocolate chip cookie and a graham cookie (special). The graham cookie tasted nothing like a graham cracker and was a little too spongy. The chocolate chip cookie was really good though. Overall the cookies were too small and the ice cream was too much to eat this thing like a sandwich but I enjoyed eating the pieces separately anyway. The ice cream was one of the best scoops of ice cream I've ever had, it was quite remarkable. The place had more pluses than minuses but between the prices being a tad high and the meatballs being a little disappointing, I may have to give the shop a little break before I come back.",3.0

"In the past week that I have been in NYC I have been thinking about all of the great food places that I have visited and The Meatball Shop is definitely at the top of my list.  This place is AMAZING!!  The idea of having a restaurant centered around meatballs is such a smart idea.  The way it works is you choose the type of meatball you want, they have classic beef, chicken, Turkey and two others to choose from.  Then, you choose the type of sauce you want your meatballs smothered in; I got the spicy meat sauce, and I loved it.  It's not very spicy, but it has enough of a kick that it definitely adds a great taste.  The meatballs and the sauce (also comes with a slice of bread) is $8, but you have options to add to your meatballs.  You can add a fried egg for $1 and even though it may sound a bit weird, trust me it was a great choice.  They also have other toppings such spaghetti, ravioli, and mashed potatoes that you can add for $5.  I chose the mashed potatoes because well, I love mashed potatoes.  The meatballs with the spicy sauce, fried egg, mashed potatoes and cheese made for a creamy, yet not heavy, combination.  Even though it seems like it won't be enough, trust me when I say that it is more than enough to fill you up.  They also have all kinds of beers and combinations, such as a whiskey float, that are available to choose.  The beers and sangria run for $6, which is standard price I'd say.  Overall my meal, plus a beer was roughly $21, but it was worth every cent.  I highly recommend this place Also there may be a wait, we waited about 20 minutes before we were seated to eat.",5.0
"I've been wanting to come eat at The Meatball Shop for a while now, every time I try the wait is too long. Finally got to try it, but in BK. When we got there, there was a wait of course. We headed to a bar across the street. When we came back because they told us our table was ready, we waited for another good 20 minutes. Liars. So we grabbed a pitcher of beer for $20 at the bar. Beer helps everything.I like the ambiance of the place. It was dim with candles, a good place to take a date. The menus were unique, They were laminated and you just check off what you want with dry erase markers. Genius! Surprised more places don't do this. I ordered the ""Special"" balls with the ""Special"" Sauce ;) over rigatoni. Basically it was reuben ball with a Thousand Island type sauce. Pretty interesting/good if you like Thousand Island dressing. I enjoyed it. Will definitely try a more normal ball next time. I did feel the portions were a bit small though.I recommend this place for people looking to have a nice dinner and eating some delicious meatballs.

"During our day trip to Williamsburg I was ecstatic to find the Meatball Shop !!! I'd already visited their original location on the LES a few days ago and was even more enchanted with this location because of it's size and layout.First off they serve their signature crumptious meatballs that practically melt in your mouth! I know, I know you've got lots of jokes for that one.... Everything is choose your own in that you can choose your style of meat balls (beef, pork, spicy, mild) as well as sauce (alfredo, pesto, tomato). They have a great bar that you can hang out at with smaller tables right near by. I thought this was wonderful because if you're not in the mood for a sit-down dinner you can stop in for a beer and an easy appetizer. It's casual comfort without being divey! My favorite part of the experience? The oatmeal coconut cookies w/ caramel ice cream!!! It was cray cray kind of good and you'll have to take a peak at the photo.

"Besides some obvious, and tiring double entendres there isn't much going for it. We ended up sitting at the bar because there was no one at the host stand, our bartender/server did a good job of handling the full bar plus because people were pulling up stools but he seemed a little harried. Fortunately, the ordering system is an easy one since it's all checklists. I got the special ball, the Jambalaya which was supposed to be andouille and shrimp, but no special sauce instead, the plain marinara was recommended so I went with that. I figured I should just get the 'naked balls' so I could taste them without any fancy dressing. The Jambalaya ball was okay, I couldn't really taste anything more than andouille, no shrimp or other seafood.The gf got the regular beef balls with the 'Family Jewels' (see how worn out it gets?) which was an over easy egg. You know, I've really had better. If you're going to be a 1 item restaurant it better be the best damn meatball I've tasted, which was not the case. Maggiano's has a better meatball, seriously.

"The Meatball Shop is an all around great restaurant. The food here is delicious- you really can't go wrong with pretty much anything you order. Of course, the meatballs are bomb, but so are the sides. My absolute favorite dish to order is the beef meatballs with spicy meat sauce (it's mild), with polenta either on the side or underneath. The combination of a perfectly creamy polenta with sauce is divine. I have also ordered the meatball sub, which is good but better on white Italian bread (not as good on wheat, in my opinion). The salads are also pretty tasty. They also have a really yummy, refreshing plum lemonade that I love. That about does it- I haven't really tried the other dishes except for the spicy pork meatballs. The traditional beef with sauce and polenta is Italian comfort food, so that's what I end up ordering pretty much every time. As for the ambiance, it's casual and usually pretty busy. The waiters have all been attentive and service is reasonably quick. I like to stop by once in a while when the meatball craving strikes.",4.0

The flavors were pronounced, buttery toasted bread, and the meat was so tender it was insane. I got a market salad on the side, with greens, raisins, pickled fennel barley and a lemon - jalapeno vinaigrette. I can't say I tasted much of the jalapeno but the salad was a nice fresh bite with all that buttery juicy meat.

"Definitely above my expectations. I had heard about its deliciousness for a long time but had never made it out there. Went in expecting a deli meat counter set up but instead got a sit down restaurant with a really cool decor instead. The menus are fun, they're laminated and you get to mark your selections on the menu with a marker. They have about 4 or so meatballs (beef, spicy pork, chicken, and veggie). I got the spicy pork with the Parmesan cream sauce with mashed potatoes. My friend got three different slider combos (beef/mushroom sauce, pork/Parmesan cream, and chicken/pesto). Everything was delicious! The Parmesan cream literally blew my mind. I got my combo based upon our waitresses recommendations and the spicy pork had a nice kick to it (may do the beef next time though) and the chicken with pesto was amazing too.  Then to top it off, we got a giant ice cream sandwich which was extremely tasty. One chocolate mint sugar cookie (their daily special), one ginger cookie, with espresso ice cream in between, which had real tiny bits of espresso beans in it!I can't wait to go back and try some different combos.",4.0
"This place was awesome! Once again my boyfriend never seems to fail me on good food!Came here on a Tuesday night for some dinner before work (wahhh) and when we got here the place was crowded and they didn't take reservations. We gave our name and the hostess was nice and perky and she told us she will call us when the table is ready so we had a seat outside since there was benches on the sidewalk. I didn't realize how much Williamsburg had changed it was awesome, Bedford Avenue had everything you can think of from bars, restaurants of all kinds of food and people everywhere just walking and strolling around it was really nice! About 30 minutes later they finally called us and we got a small table, the place is not that big and theres a bar area then the cooking area where you can actually see the cooks making your food and even eat close to them with of course a huge glass blocking you off, but it was nice.The way you order is that they give you a menu and you choose what type of meatballs or as they say ""balls"" you want and then you check it off with a marker and then they come and take your order. They had meatballs with regular sauce, pesto, spicy sauces, sweet and even had veggie, chicken and beef balls. The meat balls either came with a nice salad or you could order sides like risotto, pasta, salad, or veggies. We also tried this drink called Fruit Aid Punch not sure if I spelled it correctly and it was SO GOOD! Didn't taste the alcohol it was like grape juice and that can be a bad thing haha. Cheers! I had the pesto meatball sandwich with mozzarella and a side salad, DELICIOUS! So soft and tasty and I am obsess with pesto and it was that damn good, and the salad was so good too, my bf had the veggie meatballs with regular tomato sauce with a side of pasta and it was really good! I loved every single bite, this place was just that damn good!The waiters were awesome, food was quick and delicious, they played awesome music, the place was packed and the drinks were coming in handy. I would def. come back to this place and even recommend it as a awesome cute date night! Prices are pretty good too and they also offer awesome desserts, missed out on them but next time for sure I will have them! I love this place!",5.0
"Love, love, love this place. The vibe, style, food, and drinks make me come back time and time again!. I tried the chicken pot pie last time, the special, so delicious. I always ask the waiter/tress there opinion on the food they like and our waiter steered us in all the right ways. I always try the special when coming here, the chef really knows what he is doing when he mixes and matches wacky ingredients to make the perfect meatball. They are so good you don't need bread! It is also great to eat with old school hip hop playing on the radio. Everyone should try this place at least once.",5.0
"I had no idea this place existed until yesterday and boy, was I excited to go. As a kid from an Italian family, I grew up eating fried meatballs on Sunday and saucy meatball sandwiches on Monday, so I have high expectations for any Italian food. Let me say that these meatballs exceeded those expectations. They were cooked to perfection, served at the right temperature with the perfect amount of sauce, with a piece of foccacia bread to clean your plate. The portions are generous. I recommend you order the naked balls and a side. What I like about this place is that they offer a ""special"" option for everything which they change every day. (Special lemonade, risotto, etc.) The music was a little too loud, but it did not take away from how amazing the food and service was. I will definitely be coming back here.",5.0

We ordered 3 sides (polenta, rigatoni and a salad) and 2 'naked balls' (both were classic beef in spicy meat sauce). Everything came out in less than 30 minutes and it was delicious! I also had their bitches brew which is pretty much heaven in a pint glass.

"I happened to be in Williamsburg and walked past The Meatball Shop.  The buzz for this place had been crazy, so I decided that it was time to give it a shot.  The server was super friendly and even made himself at home by sitting at our table to review the menu with us.  Once he read it through, we were able to mark our selections right on it with a black marker.  I was thrilled to learn that Abita had expanded beyond alcoholic beverages and offered a Root Beer on tap.  I immediately opted for this sweet and syrupy brew.  I had a sip of my friend's Pineapple Lemonade, which was a tart and sour addition to the daily specials menu.  Later in the meal, I succumbed to the cocktail list and ordered another daily special, the Freshwater, which included gin, cucumber, basil, lime, and muddled pink peppercorns over crushed ice.  The tiny glass cost a steep $9 and was pretty watery.          Now let's get down to the real deal here - the meatballs!  I am not the hugest pork fan, and I know that many cannot even eat it due to religious reasons, so I was surprised to see that a majority of the balls included this variety of meat.  I tried the Everything but the Kitchen Sink Salad.  This included your choice of 3 balls and sauce, served over a chef's selection of greenmarket veggies and salad.  For this, I selected the special ball of the day -  Greek Lamb with a feta, mint, cucumber, and yogurt relish.  While the balls were tender, they were nothing special taste-wise.  The salad was the true highlight with its chickpeas, radishes, cucumbers, arugula, and marinated grilled zucchini.  The Naked Balls plate offered your choice of 4 balls and sauce over a piece of Focaccia Bread.  We opted for the Classic Beef Ball and Classic Tomato Sauce. Despite being labeled as ""beef"", this Creekstone all-natural beef had been ground with prosciutto.  The blend also incorporated herbs and fresh ricotta cheese.  We found these pretty terrible, as they included way too much prosciutto, making them overly smoky.  The sauce was full of sugar and tasted like canned Chef Boyardee.  Our mid-day snack at the Meatball Shop included some great beverages, but was sadly disappointing food-wise.   I just did not understand the hype.",2.0

"I'm normally a fan of The Meatball Shop, but it must be a Manhattan specialty for today I was in Williamsburg and grabbed some meatballs To Go before heading home to Upper Manhattan (Washington Heights): Naked balls of the day (Turkey & quinoa) pesto sauce, on top of mashed potatoes. When the bag came I checked the receipt, it had my name and all the proper typing of my order. Cool. I leave. I go home. I get home. Grrr. It's in the mushroom gravy sauce. Which would be fine, if mushrooms didn't make me feel ill. I contact my friend thinking maybe she got my pesto seeing as how she ordered the mushroom gravy. Nope. Hers were right. I scrapped as much gravy away as I could, but being mashed potatoes it was pretty much useless. A meal I couldn't eat. Too bad, too, because the flavoring of the balls were great! HOWEVER, the quinoa was not fully cooked. Perhaps they wanted a bit of a crunch? Very possible because there were also almond pieces in the meatballs....which was not mentioned on the board or while ordering. Good thing I don't have a nut allergy. I seriously can't believe how disappointing this experience was. I'm now out $15 (kind of a lot for me) and still have an empty stomach.

"Holy great meatballs!!!  Why is there no place like this in Charlotte, NC!?!?!  Everyone who is in NY needs to experience this place.  No joke.  When I first saw the place from the street, I didn't think too much of it.  My friends were insisting that this was a really good place to check out.  When I walked in, I felt like I was in a store tucked away in a small countryside.  Where I was seated with my friends, we were at the end of a big table set for 10.  It was nice, similar to a picnic table.  The decorations were wonderful with a touch of flowers in a jar to make you feel like you're dining in the country.Okay, I usually don't judge a restaurant by their bathroom, but it was just too adorable I have to mention it!!!  The set up is a little dark in the bathroom, but it gave you an old time feel.  They have old pictures set up, a cool old looking sink, and it was just so nice and clean in there.Alright, now for the food.  One word...AMAZING.  I had ordered two sliders, where you can order a kind of meatball, and what sauce you would like with it.  Mine were just delicious.  I suggest to try the sliders because you are given a variety of meatballs and sauces to choose from.  The sliders are also small, and not that expensive so you can try out more if you wish!  Upon coming to this place, I know that it's found a place of love in my belly.  Meatballs, you rock!  I would also like to point out that while I was eating, I kept thinking of Little Richard's Meatball Song...sorry really random!",5.0

"Holy great meatballs!!!  Why is there no place like this in Charlotte, NC!?!?!  Everyone who is in NY needs to experience this place.  No joke.  When I first saw the place from the street, I didn't think too much of it.  My friends were insisting that this was a really good place to check out.  When I walked in, I felt like I was in a store tucked away in a small countryside.  Where I was seated with my friends, we were at the end of a big table set for 10.  It was nice, similar to a picnic table.  The decorations were wonderful with a touch of flowers in a jar to make you feel like you're dining in the country.Okay, I usually don't judge a restaurant by their bathroom, but it was just too adorable I have to mention it!!!  The set up is a little dark in the bathroom, but it gave you an old time feel.  They have old pictures set up, a cool old looking sink, and it was just so nice and clean in there.Alright, now for the food.  One word...AMAZING.  I had ordered two sliders, where you can order a kind of meatball, and what sauce you would like with it.  Mine were just delicious.  I suggest to try the sliders because you are given a variety of meatballs and sauces to choose from.  The sliders are also small, and not that expensive so you can try out more if you wish!  Upon coming to this place, I know that it's found a place of love in my belly.  Meatballs, you rock!  I would also like to point out that while I was eating, I kept thinking of Little Richard's Meatball Song...sorry really random!",5.0
"Cute place, unique decor, reminding me of the industrial period, I initially hoped to try one of their meatball dishes since that is their namesake, but I wasn't a fan after learning that the meatballs were often mixed with pork. It's truly unfortunate for diners like myself who doesn't eat pork. I played it safe. I kept to the desserts and ordered an ice cream sandwich made of two snickerdoodle cookies and chocolate ice cream. Thumbs up!",4.0
"This place was great. My kids and I loved it. It was fun, comfortable and a bit rowdy in a good way. The servers we super friendly and when I came time for dessert (brown sugar ice cream) they even weighed it so that I could give my type 1 diabetic son insulin to cover it safely. I got meatballs with salad (so good with a fried egg!) my kids got meatballs, spaghetti with broccoli and salad.",5.0
Ordered a spicy meatball and spicy meat sauce and during the eating of the meal noticed that the meal was more spicy than normal. Later on that night realized that the cook didn't remove all of the acid from his sauce that was made that night. The heart burn was unbearable. Had to sleep sitting up to control it. Went to the pharmacy in the morning and had to invest in Tums and Zantac that was recommended from the pharmacist to cure it. I recommend that the manager should of tested that sauce before it was served to the public for acid levels. If someone had a stomach problem this could of created serious damage to there system. If the health inspector ever had a ruling on acid levels that could be served this would of failed right away.,1.0
"This place is great, whether you're grabbing dinner or an after the bar snack. My favorite thing to get is the kitchen sink- a little sampling of everything. They have really unique cocktails too.",5.0
"went here solo on my first day in NY- bar like seating which is cool for someone all alone like I was, made some quick friends when they asked me what my awesome looking drink was.  Great drink a little weak on the booze but great on flavour, had to order 2 and still didn't catch much of a buzz. Portions are really big for the price and taste amazing. I got the veggie option and was not disappointed in the least bit.Good spot to check out for a quick bite and maybe a drink on the fly.",4.0
i'm a HUGE fan of TMS. I usually go to their LES location but I was in Brooklyn a couple of months ago with a group of friends so we decided to come by and check out the brooklyn location. Great spot! Very hipster area (williamsburg) but can't complain. Drinks and Ice cream are always on point as usual. Definitely worth checking out!!!,4.0
"Great balls of fire! I've been here a couple of times and it's been great! I even had a birthday gathering here. Their specials change regularly and their risotto is so good. I've had the chicken, beef, lamb, turkey and veggie balls here. The lamb is my favorite but unfortunately it's a special so you never know when it's coming back. The sauces are great. I love the Parmesan creme but the pesto, mushroom and tomato sauces will have you happy. All in all a great place to get your Ball on!",4.0
"I was given a table outside and I heard this guy passing by saying...""So, what do you eat here? Balls?"" Yes, exactly! Delicious, flavorful, juicy, MEAT balls. You know this place is good when you sit outside and all you hear is people passing by saying ""Is this THE meatball shop?"" The line was forming out the restaurant. I'd advise you to get there early, because there's usually a small wait. I never knew I would be such a fan of meatballs. The atmosphere at the Williamsburg location is really chill and hipster. I love their menu concept where you check what you want on the menu with a marker. You can meatballs naked, as sliders, on a hero, or with sides. I can't pick a favorite but I've had the classic beef, the spicy pork, and chicken meatballs. All of the meatballs are really good and the sauces are just as good. My favorite would be the pesto, but if you want something more rich, go for the parmesan cream. I also love their polenta, it's so creamy and rich. Whenever I go, I always ask the server what all of the specials are that day. They usual feature more unique items if you're looking for something different. Also, please make room for their dessert. I'm begging you to get the ice cream sandwich. They have the best cookies...I mean, the PERFECT chewy cookies. I ordered the special that day, which was a graham cracker cookie and key lime pie ice cream. I mean, truthfully, the ice cream was good but I got tired of the key lime taste after a while, but their cookie was BOMB. I really love this place.",5.0
"Great meal, awesome service, strong drinks. I had the spicy pork meatballs with classic tomato sauce over spaghetti (it was linguine, not spaghetti). My friends both had the kitchen sink and we each got a cocktail: the white russian, hemmingway daiquiri, and moscow mule. We also had an espresso, snicker doodle, and brownie walnut ice cream sandwich which was pretty good. Our waitress was awesome and the atmosphere was nice and for somewhere in the middle of williamsburg it was decently priced. This is definitely a safe bet in the neighborhood but I'll probably come back here for lunch rather than dinner.",4.0
"I still don't get it. As I have eaten at the other location on Stanton Street, and came away from that experience feeling totally underwhelmed, and now recently at the Bedford Ave outpost, I can only assume one of a few things - A) Most people don't really know what good meatballs really taste like.B) Most people never grew up in a household with an Italian family that made amazing meatballs and sauces - and still does.C) People are sheeple and just want to gush about this place like many others and play follow the leader.Now don't get me wrong. I feel these meatball emporiums are decent enough, but it's become a trend now that is already being duplicated. To me, these spots are good as a snack food option, or even better, a drunk food meal to fill your belly when bar hopping along Bedford Ave.Still, I came away underwhelmed with my meal here just as I had previously at the other location. We actually sauntered into this spot on New Year's Eve after a night of partying at the Whiskey Bar. Yes, a few of us were kinda drunk, a few of us were a bit buzzed, and a few were pretty borderline sober. As the place was mostly empty they were able to seat our party of seven easily. It's a bigger location than the other with a nice open layout and decor. I have to give props to our waitress who was very patient with our group of misfits on this evening. She helped us with our orders and quickly accommodated our request for meals to go when a few of our group had to leave abruptly.I ordered the classic beef hero - Il Forno baguette with 3 balls, sauce and mozzarella cheese served with a small side salad for $9. Now, for the amount of food here the price is right. As for the taste - lacking. To me, the meatballs were very dry, and the sauce just did not stand out. Also, there is just not enough sauce  included to compensate for the dry baguette. There was just too much ""dryness"" overall in this meal. Meatballs should be big, juicy, and tender. The salad was a tasty side I have to admit. Also, Abita root beer on tap is something you don't see too often, along with a small but decent enough mix of beers and wines.So now I have tried their meatballs at two of their locations. Both times have been underwhelming. Maybe I expect too much. Maybe I need to lower my meatball standards. Anyway, I don't think I will give their other location on Greenwich Ave a shot at strike three. Unless I am down there and really drunk, which does happen on occasion. Never say never.",3.0

Everything on the plate was really tasty, though I found the kale salad to be a bit salty. The quinoa, and sweet potatoes were both very delicious on their own. I'm not the type to mix my foods together but everything would have gone well mixed up as well. My only other gripe would be that they charged me for the items they incorrectly brought me to begin with. Again, it was rectified but our waitress acted like the kitchen screwed up our order but since she charged me for the wrong item she clearly ordered it wrong and chose to not own up to it, which is crappy for the kitchen staff. There's a ton of places in Williamsburg to try before I'd need to come back, but this place is yummy and I'd happily return.",4.0
"I would go back to this place over and over again.Meatballs are delicious and you can get them with salad, mash potatoes or spaghetti. You can get them in sandwiches and in sliders.My favorite thing is the white peach sangria.

Was really cool place.  Went in with my dad at around 11 pm on a thursday and every table was full. Had the beef meatballs over spaghetti with the spicy meat sauce.  was great but two of the meatballs had a bone or something in it.  Despite this we would both come back again because they were GREAT!,4.0
"The wait can be a bit crazy, but it's worth it! The dry erase menu was a pretty cool concept, especially in such a noisy place, it was nice to not have to shout out my order to the waiter.They have an INSANE amount of ""meatball"" options, which I was glad to see isn't limited to the typical pork or beef meatball (they also had chicken, veggie, and others) with pasta (sandwich and other options were available).Snag an ice cream sandwich for dessert!

"What girl doesn't love to stuff her face with balls? Especially when they are juicy, flavorful, and accompanied by delicious sides?? My brother lives in Brooklyn so I've driven down here a few times to study at Toby's Estate (great coffee!). I didn't realize that I was only a few blocks away from TBS until I got hungry and yelped for food. I've only stopped by for lunch at odd hours (around 3pm) so I never had a hard time finding a seat but always opted for a seat at the bar. The bartenders are very friendly and helpful for those who don't know what to order. My favorite is the meatball salad (everything but the kitchen sink salad $10), which comes with three meatballs over a bed of arugula and seasonal veggies (usually some form of chickpeas, beets, zucchini, eggplant, broccoli, and other vegs), and definitely get the family jewels (fried egg +$1) for some ooze action. I like the classic beef and spicy pork balls and have only tried the spicy meat sauce because I liked it so much. Next time, I will try the chicken with a new sauce, perhaps the mushroom gravy. The restaurant is filled with old ghost pictures (which at first fooled me into thinking that the restaurant was 200 years old but my bf later pointed out that he saw the same creepy photo of a baby at the antique store a few stores down....) but it sure gives it a cool vibe.

"Heard so much about the Meatball shop from friends and other yelpers, after our meal I was very disappointed. The setup is compact and the food is bland.

For desert we had the vanilla chocolate chip ice cream sandwich. For the price you pay (nearly $70)  to the serving size ratio is CRAZY. By the end of the night my girlfriend had food poisoning. She got really sick and started throwing up. Not a pleasant evening. I'm not sure if it's because they used old meat or if it was sitting out for a while but that may be the reason.",2.0

He had an IPA  and I had a glass of reisling ($8)We sat in the back, at first service was a little disorganized first were approached by a guy and then our server ended up being Rachel and she took good care of us. My boyfriend had a the special salad with spinach, almonds,cranberries and mandarin oranges. I had the house salad that was included apples and arugala in a vinaigrette.  We opted for sliders  I had  the spicy pork meatball in a tomato sauce and chicken meatball with spicy meat sauce. Yummy! Delicious! And all those others good adjectives that I can't think of off the top of my head. I ordered a 3rd slider of the chicken meatball in the spicy meat sauce. The spicy pork meatball was just a little too spicy for me, you definitely felt the jalapenos in there. He had the buffalo chicken with bleu cheese, spicy pork meatball with tomato sauce and  chicken meatball with spicy meat sauce. Dessert: Brownie walnut ice cream sandwich. Safe to say.. we were full.   Very chill ambiance,  candles on tables, it was a little crowded and I liked you were able to see the cooking in front of you.

My GF thought it was great but then again she was hungry. I thought it was OK but then again I was stuffed. Texture was good but the tomato sauce was too acidic.

(so far soooo good... waiting makes all reviews go down )it was my first time here so the way menu and the way you order was cute to me. my friend who had been here before told us that we mark what we want on the menu. I asked one of the waiter what the special meat was and he said it was buffalo chicken. i proceeded to order a meatball smash. which is 2 meatball on a brioche bun with sauce+cheese served with the salad. i ordered the beef balls with the special sauce and mozzarellaperhaps i was hungry.. but ONE BITE... I WAS IN HEAVEN. the sauce was a little spicy but it blend in well with everything. it was a mixture of awesomeness and hunger. the cheese wasn't too melted it was a slice of mozarella. the meatballs just tasted really soft and awesome. my friend had one with mushroom sauce which i really like as well so that would be something i would recommend as well. i think next time i would go for the heroes... its bigger portion with just $1 more..

"First experience of eating meatball as main dish I never thought meatball could have a restaurant.

I will not come here by myself, but I will love to come with friend who would like to share dishes and enjoy drink as well.As I'm slow drinker and I will take only one or two glass of beer or wine, I like to have someone who is strong at alcohol and can drink in good speed, otherwise we will feel bad staying longer here especially at night.

This is my favorite Meatball Shop location. I've visited many times and they do not disappoint. It's spacious and the staff is great. I'm always happy with the food and drinks at the Shop.

The Fool Aid Punch is good enough to attempt to make at home and you can't go wrong with finishing any meal with one of their ice cream sandwiches (you can even order one with two different cookies). They are also very helpful to people with allergies which is important to me. Now who wants some balls?,5.0

They always have a special lemonade with some really weird flavors (pomelo, grape, blackberry, tarragon, etc), but it's great to try. A good time to go is right when they open on the weekends at 12. It seems to be pretty empty when I've gone then.",5.0
"I cannot begin to describe how much I regret returning to The Meatball Shop.   I was in the neighborhood, I was hungry and it wasn't terribly crowded around 1 in the afternoon.  I went to the counter and ordered ""The Kitchen Sink.""  The young lady behind the counter politely reminded me that it might take a while to prepare and I sat down excitedly thinking about someone preparing a fresh meal for me.  But before I settled into my seat my food was done!  Just like on Star Trek.  What I found in my takeout box when I got home five minutes later was the saddest, most unappetizing, cold pile of (leftovers?)

"Sorry guys not impressed. Nice to be able to customize what type of plate you want. but felt the food was just alright. You can lose your hearing at this place. Turn down the music! If you happen to get stuck eating at one of the high bar tables it is not easy to read the black board announcing the specials of the day by the bar. We had to ask the waiter what the specials were, he didn't offer them. The salad was fresh but came with a lot of very thinly sliced apples in it. I don't care for apples or any type of fruit in my salad, so I asked the waiter if I could get a salad without apples in it. He was very accommodating and got me a new salad.",1.0

"I drank the Kool-Aid or ate the balls, rather.I remember waiting in the snow for two hours on the Lower East Side for The Meatball Shop when the first location was in it's heyday. Then we ate outside in the cold and didn't complain once because it was glorious to have those meatballs and all those sides.The Meatball Shop is good, hands down.When The Meatball Shop opened up in Williamsburg, it was just another restaurant from Manhattan in Brooklyn but with half the wait time, if any whatsoever. Expansion is good especially when it spans boroughs and not just waistlines. It took me awhile to set foot in this location but after watching countless commercials of The Meatball Shop for Chase and hearing about American Express Small Business Saturday, The Meatball Shop became my dinner goal. I was brainwashed and I could think of no better place to spend my free $25 from Amex.We strolled in at 10:30 PM for a late night bite and were seated at the bar. The place was pretty packed but the whole bar area was empty. The bar is not a bad place to sit. The area is huge and you have a clear view of what goes on in the kitchen. Front row seats!Dinner was three sliders (2 chicken pesto and 1 gobble gobble with mushroom gravy), one bowl of spicy pork with cream sauce, risotto, and candied pecan Brussels Sprouts. We had no room for dessert (pumpkin ice cream with pie dough cookies AUGHHHHH!) because we were full and also I didn't want to go over too much on my $25 budget. The ice cream sandwiches at The Meatball Shop are very good. I have had them many times at the LES location. Sometimes I stop in for just that and no meatballs! Back to the food, it was all excellent. The chicken pesto balls were my favorite. Very juicy and flavorful. Ironically, it was the turkey ball that was drier. The spicy pork did have a kick to it but thankfully the sides which were on the lighter side in taste balanced things out. Nothing was left. It was all devoured happily.I'll be back and to this location. It's much more spacious and nicer than the LES one.",4.0

"First of all, I saw this on Food Network and immediately wanted to try it. Second, we decided to venture out to the BK location instead of the one in Manhattan (BK's the new Manhattan right?)Upon walking into the restaurant, I immediate fell in love.

This is where the ratings go down...Classic beef with spicy meat sauce - this is a meatball place. The classic beef should be perfection. Sadly, it was not. It was dry and not moist at all. No one wants a dry ball of hamburger meat. The spicy meat sauce was good but there was not enough of it. Spicy pork with parm cream - Probably because it's a pork meatball, this one was a tad moister, but still slightly dry. It could've used a bit more fat because it was so flaky. The parm cream sauce was divine.Special with mushroom gravy - Same as above, was disappointed in how dry and normal these meatballs tasted. And they were not huge honkers either, just normal size meatballs.Risotto - Cheesy and cream, this was a good dish.

"I ordered beef meatballs in classic tomato sauce with rigatoni and a pitcher of Sixpoints Bengal I shared with my friend.  The beer was awesome but I'm a sucker for locally brewed IPA's. I thought the meatballs were a little dry. The sauce was bland.  The rigatoni was a little undercooked.  Pretty disappointing considering that dish is one my personal favorites. Practically grew up eating meatballs and rigs. There were alot more interesting things I could've ordered on the menu, like spicy pork in mushroom gravy over polenta or something. Or maybe the ""smashed"" meatballs on a brioche bun. But you won't get a great review from me if you can't nail the simple classics.  3 stars for the experience and the creative and customizable menu and dishes.",3.0

I ordered the spicy pork meatballs with their meat sauce, alongside their daily risotto..which included a great amount of parmigiano reggiano. I got to satisfy my craving and enjoyed a glass of Cabernet which paired perfectly. Even though it was pretty packed, the restaurant has a cosy and comfortable vibe which is really inviting and calm. This place is a great take on simple and hearty dishes that ushers in the comfort food vibe. Like being home for the holidays.",4.0
"Wow! The meatball sandwiches are exactly what you expect! Perfectly seasoned, sauce just right and the bread, while ciabiatta was very soft.Loved them, loved the vibe there too. We sat at the bar and had the nicest server who was super efficient.The music is way too loud for a dining experience though, you have to turn it down for customers, especially if they are there before 8pm - PLEASE!!!!",4.0
"Today was my second visit to The Meat Ball Shop and the food is always wonderful. The big problem with this place is that the music is too loud, it wasn't a relaxing dinner because the people next to you need to scream over the music.",3.0
"Stopped in for dinner after a recommendation from a family member and I'm glad I did. Simple menu with meatballs , meatballs and more meatballs. The traditional is a solid choice and the sauce is definitely not from a can. Pricing is very reasonable and worth every penny. Finish it all off with a home made cookie ice cream sandwich.  A great little place and I'm glad I stopped in. Ask for Asif he knows what's good and was very attentive.",5.0
"I ordered beef meatballs in classic tomato sauce with rigatoni and a pitcher of Sixpoints Bengal I shared with my friend.  The beer was awesome but I'm a sucker for locally brewed IPA's. I thought the meatballs were a little dry. The sauce was bland.  The rigatoni was a little undercooked.  Pretty disappointing considering that dish is one my personal favorites. Practically grew up eating meatballs and rigs. There were alot more interesting things I could've ordered on the menu, like spicy pork in mushroom gravy over polenta or something. Or maybe the ""smashed"" meatballs on a brioche bun. But you won't get a great review from me if you can't nail the simple classics.  3 stars for the experience and the creative and customizable menu and dishes.",3.0
"The vibe of this place makes you feel like its a ""Hang out"" nothing but cool vibes and music playing. Everyone who works there is lax and ready to help. I had the pesto beef meatballs and the pesto sauce was so succulent I was using my bread to get the last drops of it. They have coqui for the holiday season! and it is GOOD. Definitely reminds me of my aunts coqui for holiday functions. The sides are mediocre. I'd go just for meatballs and coqui. OH and they have $3 PBR on draft!",4.0
The atmosphere is dope. The music is on point and so is the food. Don't order takeout. Grab a seat by the bar and you'll  get your food faster.,5.0
"Went here for dinner last night.  It's hard because I really wanted to like this place.  And if I was reviewing just the food, I'd definitely give it at least a 4.  Alas, due to the service...or the lack thereof, it gets a 3.  It's definitely a cute little place on Bedford and definitely busy.  We walked in put our names down and left.  Got a text message about 10 minutes later and headed back.  We got seated at the front by the windows - which I normally don't mind, but they completely forget about you.  People swarm in and stand behind where we were sitting so we were completely blocked.  The only time we saw our server was to get our order, drop off our food and drop off the check.My friend Z ordered the spicy pork balls over the polenta with mushroom gravy.  YUM.   The polenta was cooked perfectly and was super creamy.  The spicy pork balls were actually spicy (yay!), and the mushroom gravy was super flavourful.  I just got two sliders.  Spicy pork with classic tomato and chicken with Parmesan cream.  Pretty tasty, the buns were soft and pillowy and the balls were well cooked.  We got roasted veggies to balance out our meal, but it was roasted potatoes with onions and radicchio(?).  I was thinking since it was under ""greens"" there might actually be some greens.  Now don't get me wrong.  I love potatoes in all forms and of course I still ate them.  But I was a little disappointed.  Also, ordered a coke, never came, still on my bill.  But I'm willing to give it another shot.",3.0

"YES. They're sooo good! And so sweet.Finally, an Italian restaurant that is cute, quirky, not expensive, laid back, appropriate for dates, appropriate to bring Mom, appropriate for a quick snack.

The food here is SUPER good and not expensive at all. We've tried the classic and buffalo meat balls. The parmesan cream sauce is really good. The simple salad is a WIN. The polenta is my favorite.

"I went here for the first time over the weekend, and I was blown away.  I had the spicy pork with spicy meat sauce, and it was delicious.  In fact, delicious may not even do it justice.  It was a rare experience of perfection in taste, smell, sight, and texture.  My meal was uniquely enjoyable.  It was more than just good food, it was food that left me in awe.  I'm not kidding.",5.0

"So good! They have veggie meatballs, yay! I was really pleasantly surprised by that option on the menu. If you are a meat-eater, my SO loves the spicy pork ball ""smash"" which comes on a brioche bun with melted mozzarella cheese and sauce. I think the ""smash"" is a little smaller (also cheaper at I think 9 or 10 bucks) than the sub (which is 11 bucks)... There's a whole wheat option for the sub which I thought was a nice touch if you're health conscious. I got the sub and it was definitely reasonably priced and delicious!

"I live right near the Brooklyn branch, and had heard great things. Sadly, my experience hasn't been so good.I was meeting an old colleague for dinner and we thought this place sounded fun.

Ten minutes later I did, and she then added me to the list and told me it would be ten to fifteen minutes. I didn't expect to be seated before she arrived, but that is terrible service.The rest of the night wasn't good.

"Their specials can be quite spot on. I had their turkey meatball special as it was around Thanksgiving. It was perfect to remind me of how good Thanksgiving dinner was. Granted, I'm not wild about the prices as a little slider of meat cut with bread crumbs and filler can be $3. I would probably get 3 bals in a bowl and then hoard up on some bread and sides.The highlight of the place are the rotating specials. Keep an eye out for what the specials of the day are and order those.As for drinks, they have their own Sixpoint beer, Wheatball, which is pretty good for wheat ale lovers. I would recommend trying a large quart of the grape Kool Aid punch. My friend and I shared it and it is seriously dangerous stuff. We were quite wasted from it. It's amazing how delicious Kool Aid and rum can be. I wouldn't drink it everyday, but definitely try it.",4.0
"Wonderful service, great ambiance and delicious food.We wandered in and quickly seated at 2 PM. We were there for about an hour and this place is pretty busy on a weekday late lunch time.

Thank you!I ordered the beef meatballs with mushroom gravy on top of their risotto with their ""House Jewels"" aka fried egg. My friend got the spicy meatball with spicy sauce also on top of the risotto and with a fried egg. He loved his and I loved mine. We also ordered a side of rigatoni and it was okay.. I thought my meatballs were good but the gravy was a little bland even with the shaved parmesan on top. The risotto wasn't as creamy as I've had before but I liked how they added diced zucchini and mushrooms-- love thinking I'm being healthy. For me this place was all about their cantaloupe frozen yogurt in cream soda. It was fizzy yummy heaven!!!! My friend got another kind of float and said mine was pretty good too. I slurped mine up in no time and I'm usually the type who drinks slowly. The portions don't seem that big but after a few bites, I was full. Heavy food is oh so good. It came out to be $20 a person before tip.",4.0

The special of the day was buffalo meat which I had a piece from my girlfriend. It falls apart so easily, I prefer the spicy pork or classic beef they both tasted pretty similar.. the spicy pork wasnt too spicy. I also liked the concept of it.

"Hmm, I like how The Meatball Shop is listed as ""Canadian"" on Yelp;) I came here for a late lunch on a weekend and even ~3pm it was packed!! Luckily, we didn't have to wait and got stools by the window where we could people-watch. I like the cozy atmosphere here and the efficient ordering system (you check off your order using a dry erase marker on the menu). Both my DC and I had the ""Everything but the kitchen sink salad"", which is filling and full of veggies. I had the classic beef meatballs with mushroom gravy. I loved the sauce and the balls were juicy, although super-dense. The DC had the spicy pork meatballs with classic tomato sauce. The pork meatballs had a softer, lighter consistency (NB: with your bill, there's a Meatball Shop postcard with the recipe -- tried it at home and it's pretty easy to recreate!). I also had a glass of their white wine sangria, which was refreshing and light, although the glass is pretty small! I would come back on my next visit to NYC and try some of their other options! I also like how the kitchen is open late.",3.0
I love this place... One of my favorites.. Best veggie balls ever.... But they definitely need to have at least two bartenders... Too busy for only one,5.0
"Likes: Spicy pork meatball with mushroom sauce slider is SO GOOD.  Special meatball (corned beef) with the special sauce was okay, didn't really care for the coleslaw in it.  You get to pick your own combos like beef, spicy pork, chicken etc meatballs with pesto, tomato, mushroom, spicy meat, or special sauce.  No line in mid-afternoon.Dislikes: Meatball sliders were the size of golfballs.",5.0
"This place is so fantastic!  I had just gotten into town from DC and was starving so my friend brought me here.  The atmosphere is great, the staff is great, and the balls are great.  I loved the simplicity of their menu and the veggie balls with mushroom sauce was divine!!!  I hope they expand down to DC next :)",5.0
"Since I'm vegetarian, I wasn't too fond of going there at first, but since the reviews of this place were mainly really good, I thought I'd give it a shot.And it was definitely worth it! I had the veggie meatballs (made out of whatever) with Parmesan and classic tomato sauce and they were solid!It was quite crowded when we got there (Sunday), but after about 5mins we were seated and the waiter was super attentive and helped us out. I appreciate the idea of the 'specials', which are always put up on a chalkboard and vary every day(?)I also had a salad as a side dish, maybe a bit overpriced for 5$ for plain arugula, but not too bad. The prices are imho really fine, always around the 10$ line.Amazing is that they also serve some yummy desserts such as floats.Altogether a solid place to have dinner/lunch/brunch and definitely worth more than one visit.",4.0

I was able to get a kitchen sink special minus the meatballs on top. It came with fennel, beets, steamed broccoli. All the vegetables were extremely fresh and tasty. I would definitely go back just for this plate. Although this isn't the highlight of the place, but I can make-do. I also really enjoyed their dry erase menus. You just mark off what you like.

"Hmm, I like how The Meatball Shop is listed as ""Canadian"" on Yelp;) I came here for a late lunch on a weekend and even ~3pm it was packed!! Luckily, we didn't have to wait and got stools by the window where we could people-watch. I like the cozy atmosphere here and the efficient ordering system (you check off your order using a dry erase marker on the menu). Both my DC and I had the ""Everything but the kitchen sink salad"", which is filling and full of veggies. I had the classic beef meatballs with mushroom gravy. I loved the sauce and the balls were juicy, although super-dense. The DC had the spicy pork meatballs with classic tomato sauce. The pork meatballs had a softer, lighter consistency (NB: with your bill, there's a Meatball Shop postcard with the recipe -- tried it at home and it's pretty easy to recreate!). I also had a glass of their white wine sangria, which was refreshing and light, although the glass is pretty small! I would come back on my next visit to NYC and try some of their other options! I also like how the kitchen is open late.",3.0

"I have been to a number of the Meatball Shops across NYC and my recent experience at the Bedford Ave. location has me worrying that the chain might be experiencing issues with expansion. Usually the service from sitting down to food on your table is relatively quick, especially for someone who knows how the menu system works.I was with a group of six people and our waitress was on us for drinks before I had a chance to pick up my order pen. Fortunately someone in the group was quick to order a bottle of wine for the table. She disappeared and within a minute was back to collect our menus. Far too quickly for my taste, but I was able to mark my order quickly. For the next 20 minutes we waited for that bottle of wine however. When it finally came after prompting her, she claimed the delay was over all the wine glasses were in use, despite the restaurant being half-full on a Friday night. But I'll give her the pass on that issue.While our group chatted, another 30+ minutes went by and our food was still nowhere to be found. Again an inquiry to the waitress yielded a response that the kitchen was backed up, yet again, the restaurant remained half empty and I've been to other Meatball Shops that were crammed to the gills with people, yet food was prompt. She attempted a appease us by offering the table some bread. Yet as time passed, no bread.After another 10 minutes, our food finally arrived. However, a number of side dishes were noticeably absent, however, after speaking with the waitress, the lost dishes were quickly made and brought to us, along with the aforementioned bread, which turned out to be two extra pieces of their focaccia bread. Hardly enough for a group of six and far too late to be a meaningful gesture.While most food was as expected, the risotto was noticeably sub-par, approaching inedible. After a few people tasted we all agreed that someone had forgotten to include salt in the dish, leaving it tasting more of dry, tasteless, pile of starch than of a risotto.

"Pretty bummed out ! Was So excited as I read the yelp reviews finally deciding to drive  all the way from bushwick ! Really wanted to try the meatballs but guess what ...for all of us non pork eaters out there stay away . No substitute AT ALL and was almost kinda rude about it ! Sorry lady not everybody likes That ""pink meat""!!  And screw your Kool AiD lol . Went down the block to Sweet Chick and had some bomb chicken and waffles ! TRIP and GAS Not wasted !",1.0
"We f***ing love this place. They have a excellent variety of meatball dishes there's literally something for everyone. Apart from the fantastic meatball dishes, the bartenders seem to take great pride in their drinks making them with great precision. The only complaint we have with meatball shop is the small food portion you receive, we weren't exactly full but maybe that's the plan ""give them just enough to want more"" if so it worked and we will be returning again and again.",4.0
"Looking for a new sort of comfort food? I've found it here at THE Meatball Shop. I just can't get enough. Every day there's a meatball of the day. Aaaaand if you're not sure what to have, the experienced expert staff is always willing to assist. There's just one thing you should keep in mind, it gets crowded quickly, so there may be a wait. Hope you enjoy!",4.0
"You really can't go wrong with any combination here. My personal fave is the chicken meatballs with pesto over risotto, but keep an eye on the specials because they can be great, too.This is a fabulous restaurant for out of town guests and picky eaters, because a lot of the menu will look safe and familiar to them (you can always get pasta and meatballs), and you can mix it up with interesting combos for the more adventurous types. For any starch-free folks, you can get meatballs with a vegetable, which is seasonal and delicious.Save room for an ice cream sandwich at the end of the meal, if you can.Also, nice ambiance and decor; their bathroom always has a Mrs. Meyers candle--totally turned me onto the brand.",4.0
"I really loved this concept. I wish we had it on the west coast, I would def frequent it. The specialty meatball I had was absolutely delicious, along with everything else I ate. The best part is you can skip any kind of carbed out side if you want and just go straight for the meatballs. The atmosphere inside was cool and the staff was friendly and nice. I'm glad I got to go here when I was in NYC and would def go back next time I'm out there.",5.0
"Hate.Not just me.Pretentious.Good luck getting a server to actually serve.Made two visits, that's enough.Hated the nice brioche buns with the mushy over-rated meatballs.Had to literally get up and approach the counter and ask to be served. More than once. Same visit.Won't even go into more details the reviewers below can probably fill in the blanks regarding all their failings.I refuse to waste any more time on them.Too bad I have to assign a star..sigh.",1.0
I had much higher hopes for this place meatballs were dry and not all that spectacular The idea of the place is really cool but the actual taste of the food was a little off the assortment of meatballs we got were all so hard and dry everything needed salt The whiskey milkshake however with root beer was great highlight of the meal,3.0

Got an order to go one night and popped out with a 1yr old trying to get everything settle for bedtime. My order was wrong, I called and the lady was so rude.

"Came with my sister and two cousins for a joint belated/early bday dinner. Made reservations so didn't have to wait long.

Since it wast first time I decided to stick to familiar and got the beef meatballs in marinara served over risotto (I know, weird twist right?). While waiting for our food, got us a pitcher of white wine/peach sangria--amazeballs!  Food came quickly--amazeballs squared!  Four mutant sized golf balls heaped on a bowl of perfectly cooked risotto.

"A vegetarian giving a meatball shop 4 stars?!This Williamsburg location is chuckin' out the exact same goods as the LES locale. I'm impressed by the consistency between the two locations, and the consistency in general. The parm sauce always comes out perfectly, exactly the same flavor, richness and consistency as my first time. :) The LES location seems to have been designed a little more romantically, and tis location is a little more laid back with a couple long park bench tables in the back. There was no wait when we came for a weekend lunch after some tasty nibbles at Smorsaburg. No wait at any hour on a weekend is unheard of at the LES location so this is definitely a defining feature here! The vegetable balls are good (and don't taste like a weird healthy vegetable-y dish you would get at a lot of vegan restaurants). Nice seasoning. I love that for the ""heroes"" (meatball sandwiches) you get your choice of each of the different ingredients, so you can have variety and get something a little different every time.Of the sauces, I've tried the Mushroom, Parmesan cream, tomato and pesto sauces and they are all good. Parmesan is my favorite!! Too heavy for some people, just right for me. If you want something a little less heavy but equally as flavorful, go for the pesto or mushroom. I like the simplicity, the balls are tasty and a good price.The dessert ice cream cookie-wiches are good but not amazing.

We decided on the lamb meatballs in yogurt sauce. It was decent. I've had better. The ice cream was also decent.. I've had better. Would I return?

"I love the concept of this place. The 'tick what you want' menu to the simple, homely food done well and at an affordable price. It's a little try-hard with the decor.

I LOVE meatballs. When my friend told us of this place We knew we had to come here. The concept of choosing 4 different kinds of meatballs and different sauces and then different pairings is genius. All of our food came out delicious. I myself got the beef meatballs with classic marinara over spaghetti. Also on the side was a spicy pork slider with spicy meat sauce. Everything was delicious and even the spaghetti was pretty good. I wish they either opened one up in SF or the next time I'm back in NY I will have to make sure to come back and try more dishes.,4.0

"Meatballs and jello shots ... it's a classic combination. Next to balls of meat and liquor hidden in dessert, my next favorite thing is sauce. Sauce and butternut squash. And anything creamy. Okay, so sauce, creamy stuff, butternut squash, balls of meat, and liquor that counts as dessert are ALL my favorite things. Oh, and risotto. Can't forget the risotto. I think that is what I said to the waitress when I ordered bolognese balls with cream sauce over risotto, a side of the squash, and a jello shot. Then I think I had a heart attack from a combo of excitement/caloric intake. Did I mention I finished up this meal with a custom ice cream cookie? I need help, people. I need help.",4.0
"Came with my sister and two cousins for a joint belated/early bday dinner. Made reservations so didn't have to wait long. Ambience was cool--rustic farm-y feeling meets Brooklyn hipster, which I guess are synonymous lol. Menu was pretty straightforward. Choose your balls then you choose what sauce it's served in and on the side or over what. Or you could go ""healthy"" and choose from their salad entrees or opt for the sandwiches. Since it wast first time I decided to stick to familiar and got the beef meatballs in marinara served over risotto (I know, weird twist right?). While waiting for our food, got us a pitcher of white wine/peach sangria--amazeballs!  Food came quickly--amazeballs squared!  Four mutant sized golf balls heaped on a bowl of perfectly cooked risotto. So yum. Everyone else loved their meals too, including my cuz who got the ""healthy"" salad.  Would definitely return, maybe in the cooler months because July was seeing flies all over the restaurant (only downside).",4.0
"Ok, let's get the ""bad"" out of the way... the crowd trends towards a combination of people on ""hipster safari"" and new Williamsburg residents taking their parents out to a local spot. However, sometimes the crowd doesn't matter. This isn't a place for a romantic date or an intense conversation with friends... so what?  Meatball shop is a casual spot to get a delicious,  relatively cheap meal and a couple of drinks. The meatballs are great, the drinks are great (20th Century is my current favorite) and the service is friendly and efficient. Most of the time good food, drink and service is all you need. Dinner for two with a couple drinks is going to run you less than $50.",4.0
"A vegetarian giving a meatball shop 4 stars?!This Williamsburg location is chuckin' out the exact same goods as the LES locale. I'm impressed by the consistency between the two locations, and the consistency in general. The parm sauce always comes out perfectly, exactly the same flavor, richness and consistency as my first time. :) The LES location seems to have been designed a little more romantically, and tis location is a little more laid back with a couple long park bench tables in the back. There was no wait when we came for a weekend lunch after some tasty nibbles at Smorsaburg. No wait at any hour on a weekend is unheard of at the LES location so this is definitely a defining feature here! The vegetable balls are good (and don't taste like a weird healthy vegetable-y dish you would get at a lot of vegan restaurants). Nice seasoning. I love that for the ""heroes"" (meatball sandwiches) you get your choice of each of the different ingredients, so you can have variety and get something a little different every time.Of the sauces, I've tried the Mushroom, Parmesan cream, tomato and pesto sauces and they are all good. Parmesan is my favorite!! Too heavy for some people, just right for me. If you want something a little less heavy but equally as flavorful, go for the pesto or mushroom. I like the simplicity, the balls are tasty and a good price.The dessert ice cream cookie-wiches are good but not amazing. I usually save dessert for elsewhere that specializes in my favorite course!",4.0
"I stopped by this place not because I'm a huge fan of meatballs or even if meat in general, but because they had malted milk ice cream! LOL. Anyways, the hubby and I decided to check out a meatball or two while we were there since you got 4 big balls, in your choice of sauce, and some foccacia bread for $7. We decided on the lamb meatballs in yogurt sauce. It was decent. I've had better. The ice cream was also decent.. I've had better. Would I return?

"Albóndigas I wish I could hear you all saying this word because it even sounds funny from a native Spanish speaker. It seems like easy jokes goes on the house which such a name/speciality: meatballs. Have you seen the ""Ball Jokes"" section on their web site? themeatballshop.com/inde… . No kidding. But I don't know. You people can think about guys and stuff, but honestly is all about grandma. The homey taste. I think its the first thing will cross everyone's mind ... ok, the second one for some maybe, but it is unquestionable that a comfy feeling comes up on your first bite. The texture. Firm yet juicy. Forget about being sloppy, undercook, overcook or like a stone in texture which I find common mistakes in other's. As for the sauces, those are key. Thick and creamy. Smooth and comforting. Savory and filling. You can find same quality balls in many other places but let me explain. Only in terms of execution and meat quality because the concept here is a brilliant idea and not many probably will offer this meatballs innovation and flavors profile on the sauces. Do one thing and do it the best. Once, I heard Adria explaining how he reach his creations. Simple yet genius. Choose one ingredient, only one, and think about how to change everything on it, under any perspective. Obviously, things are more simple here, there is not deconstruction, but the idea seems to be the same.Therefore I like the approach to the patron offering a customize menu. It seems short at first but if you spin around the balls enough there is not much chances to repeat same meal even for frequent visitors. Take the sharpie and mark on the menu, which meatball, with which sauce and which format: naked (4 balls) on a bun (1) on a baguette (3) or smashed (2) over a brioche. Now, coming back to the traditional? aspect. The size is by the grandma measurement. Those things are enormous and they gave you 4 per order when naked is chosen. Come on. Don't tell me the biggest food coma is not been when family gatherings...right? therefore 2 people can share 2 orders and left satisfied enough. Suffering from gluttony? up to you. 4 per person its a lot. A lot, even under those circumstances. You are warned. At $7 per dish for the naked ones I find it more than reasonable. We choose the spicy pork with pesto sauce and the special with mushroom gravy. Loved the light spicy hint. And the cheese on the sauces. On a side we opted for polenta and the risotto. And once again both were comfy taste, creamy, rich and delicious.  On the fail side, our special meatballs I find it occasionally dry and I would have like less sauce over it. Since it was so delightful I was ok with that. There is also a wait, probably always. On a pouring Friday night in this location, 2 people waited 20 min to get a table. It clear up around 11pm. I was ok with that too. And if you catch seats on the bar, you keep them. The decor, using one of my faves quotes, is very Brooklyn. Its like taking the L train and somehow you automatically know is going to Willi. You know what I mean? Somehow it also resembles to me to a 1950's style. Like if the Mad Men crew were hanging here after work. But without the smoke. The wall filled with old machines to ground meat can be a little disturbing at first but look charming after a little bit. This loft industry style is surprisingly well organize and bigger that you think. The lighting made it cozy even being noisy and pack. The individual tables would need to be bigger and not as close each other but I was ok with that even when it made us to drop one of our forks three times. Three. But the service was outstanding. More things to like is that its right at the L train station and its open later serving food until 2 (weekdays) or 4 am (weekends). Maybe its not worth it to wait on the Manhattan location. If you haven't try it yet, you know you have to do it. I remember thinking, come on, this is just meatballs .. what is the whole thing about it? Well, its not just regular meatballs and it tells you how the most simple things can fairly become everyone's crush.

"***Review Based On Delivery ALONE***When my co-workers were all huddled around the computer at 8:00 AM, I KNEW it wasn't work related - it was food menu related.  They were all discussing about the amazing wonderment of meaty, yummy, balls - served anyway you like them!  Saucy, juicy - just a mouth full in general!  I've bookmarked this for a while, so I hopped on the bally bandwagon and ordered the spicy pork ball hero for $9.The anticipation totally KILLED me, but my expectations were wayyy too high unfortunately.  I didn't think the balls were all that spicy nor that orgasmic.  I was also hoping they would have been a bit crisper on the outside, but I could clearly tell that they were cooked in the sauce.  Presentation made it look like the hype, but my sense were underwhelmed.  I'm still not sure what I was missing out on, or, if my choice wasn't the best one?  Maybe I would try it again - maybe.",3.0
"Wow, I never know you can come up with various way of preparing meatball.  I really like this place's creativity on using a single type of food.I ordered the meatball smash sandwich with the special meatball.  The special was pizza (sausage,perperoni and mozzarella).  I added mushroom sauce and mozzarella cheese.  The portion was perfect and wasn't too overwhelming.  The bun has a little sweet complimentary taste, and I love the mushroom sauce.  The salad was a good compliment that had pear to give it a little sweetness.I found the ordering style unique.  You mark your choices on a laminated menu with a dry erase marker.  This is very useful in getting the order correct and useful for regulars.  Ambiance might not be great.  During my visit, please note two things: it was very busy, and I was ordering the bar.  I felt ignored by the bartender.  He seemed reluctant to answer my questions, but focused on the (ahem female) customers beside me.  For example, he told me that the special was meatball, but didn't give me any further details.  Also, he didn't tell me the popular meatball.  Without his clear recommendation, I think I missed out on the spicy pork.  However, in the end, he made up the bad service, after the bar got less busy.In general, if you are going there for the food, I highly recommend it, and you should go there with an idea what you want.  Your server might be too busy to give you any recommendation or has better (ahem attractive) customer. :)",4.0
"I really wanted to love The Meatball Shop. We were so excited about this experience we even waited for the L train for a long, stuffy and sticky 25 minutes without bailing (this is a big deal for two impatient new yorkers on a hot summer day). Forewarned by my fellow yelpers, we headed over around 5:15 p.m. for an early dinner to avoid the crowds. The restaurant had ample available seating and was charming. I loved the menu, which allows you to customize your meal and check off your order specifications. You'd think this method would prevent mistakes. Unfortunately, although I explicitly asked for my mashed potatoes on the side, they were served ""under"" my meatballs. So much for sharing them with boyfriend! The waitress apologized but made no effort to rectify the situation by offering me a complimentary side of mashed potatoes. I had the spicy pork meatball with the mushroom gravy. Both were quite tasty. I would've have appreciate a little more spice, though. Boyfriend had the beef meatball with classic tomato sauce and mozzarella on wheat bread sandwich. My stolen bite was bland. The meatball was wildly under-seasoned and had no punch to it. And then, to make matters worse--just as we were about to order dessert, a patron beside us found a grasshopper in his salad! The waiter promptly grabbed the plate, but the grasshopper fell onto the floor and remained there for the rest of the evening ... Awkward, much?We decided to stick it out for dessert since we had heard so much about the ice cream sandwiches. Boyfriend and I, however, hate hard cookies so we asked the waitress if the sandwich cookies were soft. She nodded and said ""Yes, absolutely. They're definitely soft."" Not only were the cookies hard, but the mint ice cream was just vanilla ice cream with bits of chopped mint--it was inedible. Given the bad service, issues with sanitation and somewhat bland flavors, we left feeling really disappointed and wishing the meatball shop had lived up to the hype.",2.0

We were seated at the bar where a cute server with a little swag and another server with a whole lotta crack (as in butt crack) attended to us as they were cleaning up. The service was very attentive but if it wasn't that would just be outrageous seeing as how my friend and I were the last ones in this place, coming from a late night roaming around NYC. I ordered what I enjoyed at my first visit at the Lower East Side location which were the Spicy Pork Naked Balls with a Spicy Meat Sauce. Still delicious the second time around.

"I came back! I still dont love EVERYTHING on the menu but i like that there is something for everyone. When i last dined here I tried the smash and I was sorely disappointed. A mush sandwich with mush innards. Not the mouth feel i was going for. So when i came back this time around I decided to stick with what worked from me and go from there. The Naked Balls are definitely the way to go for me. You choose the meat you like (beef, spicy pork, chicken, veggie, or special) followed by the sauce to cover the balls (tomato, spicy tomato, mushroom, parmesan, or the special sauce) and then you choose a side. I wanted to be different and get something other than the spicy pork and spicy sauce but that fear that I would not like it gnawed on me. The beauty here is the slider option! I really wanted to try the chicken meatballs with the mushroom sauce so i got it on a slider. I didnt love it. Back to the naked balls. The beef meatball with spicy sauce is now my favorite combination. That plus a side of their creamy polenta and Im in comfort food heaven. For a seriously cozy experience, i got the balls on top of the polenta and i loved it. I spied a meatball hero and if you are a big eater- this baby is hefty! and it comes with a salad. The best part is that its not a mush fest! Bon Apetit!I was here around 6pm on a weekday and it was relatively empty.

Perfection.I had the special special, which was chile Relleno meatballs with salsa verde and queso sauce. So darn good. I also tried the kale on the side and didn't like it. My server took it off the bill without my asking, which I thought was awesome. Then I had the special special ice cream sandwich, hazelnut cookies with pumpkin ice cream. The cookies were a little hard for my taste, but still yummy.I will def be back!!",5.0
"5 stars...why not?!  Place was fantastic.  Really cool vibe playing 90's hip hop and the servers were real chill.  It was bustling.  They don't take reservations, so keep that in mind.  Concept is great and fairly inexpensive.  I like how you check off what you want to order on the menu itself.  Look for their blackboard specials as well.  Some pretty cool concoctions.I had the smash with spicy pork, classic tomato and mozzarella served on a brioche bun ($8).  The smashed meatball had a little kick and side salad was delicious.  Everything meshed or shall I say smashed perfectly.  I loved it, but might opt for a hero next time because the baguette they serve em on looked awesome.  Curious where they get their bread from.  If they ever expand to Astoria, you can count me in as a regular.  I'll dip my balls in it!",5.0

I really loved this place. You need to go with plenty of time since there it's always a wait for a table.I had naked balls with Parmesan cheese and risotto on the site and everything was so delicious. You need to try the Fool Aid which is grape Kool Aid with different types of liquor,5.0
"I love this place.  The Meatball Shop is great pretty much any time of the day.I think their menu is really clever and I like the way that they let you mix and match what you want.  The service is always nice, but on popular nights (i.e. Friday, Saturday) be prepared to wait.  Because this place is awesome, it's often packed for dinner.  I've been here for brunch and the wait wasn't bad.I'll definitely be coming back!",4.0
"I came back! I still dont love EVERYTHING on the menu but i like that there is something for everyone. When i last dined here I tried the smash and I was sorely disappointed. A mush sandwich with mush innards. Not the mouth feel i was going for. So when i came back this time around I decided to stick with what worked from me and go from there. The Naked Balls are definitely the way to go for me. You choose the meat you like (beef, spicy pork, chicken, veggie, or special) followed by the sauce to cover the balls (tomato, spicy tomato, mushroom, parmesan, or the special sauce) and then you choose a side. I wanted to be different and get something other than the spicy pork and spicy sauce but that fear that I would not like it gnawed on me. The beauty here is the slider option! I really wanted to try the chicken meatballs with the mushroom sauce so i got it on a slider. I didnt love it. Back to the naked balls. The beef meatball with spicy sauce is now my favorite combination. That plus a side of their creamy polenta and Im in comfort food heaven. For a seriously cozy experience, i got the balls on top of the polenta and i loved it. I spied a meatball hero and if you are a big eater- this baby is hefty! and it comes with a salad. The best part is that its not a mush fest! Bon Apetit!I was here around 6pm on a weekday and it was relatively empty. I have known it to be kind of crowded so this was a pleasant dining experience.",4.0
"Every Tuesday, like clockwork, I get take out from here before my weekly bar trivia night.  I've actually stopped referring to Tuesday night as ""Trivia Night"" and instead call it ""Meatball Night"", because I start craving these things at least 24 hours prior to eating them.  Sometimes I feel like they have to put heroin in them because I've clearly developed a dependence.  Also, the staff is amazing, they remember me every week and are SUPER sweet and good at what they do.  Huzzah! Williamsburg Meatball Shop, I love you!",5.0

We finally made it to a Meatball Shop! Place is very cool but a little heavy on the typical Burg hipsters. Service was very good and food came out quickly. I had the wheat hero with classic meatballs and the parmesan sauce. Wife had some sliders with mashed potatoes. We both thought the sandwiches needed way more sauce. Mashed potatoes were excellent! I think the real star of the meal is the dessert. The ice cream sandwiches are outstanding. We will be back.,4.0

I'm sure the employees were tired at this point but the food took 30 minutes to get to our table and they didn't even all come at the same time. Once I got my food though - it was amazing. I got the spicy pork meal balls with gravy on top of some mashed potatoes. It was delicious, but wasn't so ""spicy"". I was kind of expecting a bit of heat but maybe my taste buds are jaded.

"3 starsDECOR: It's definitely very neat inside! There's the front section with the bar and several tables against the wall, and then the back area with the open kitchen and several tables.

SERVICE: Yes, the glass of PBR is $2, but it's super tiny and if you don't specify that that's what you want, they will assume that you want a pint for $4. The waitresses are not very friendly, and it's kind of chaotic with about four employees hovering over you, trying to accomplish different tasks (ex: fill up your water, take away dishes, serve, etc). Since there isn't much space between me and the tables next to me, I would prefer to just be taken care of by one person.FOOD: Meh. I've had better meatball subs at Subway! The meatballs here are very mushy and kind of mesh together with the hero and the sauce. They're nothing special either, in terms of taste. The heroes come with a side salad (arugula & sliced apples) though, which I liked. The meal, although disappointing, was still very filling. DESSERT: MMM. Their ice cream sandwiches are pretty awesome. You can choose 2 cookies (chocolate chip, brownie, macaroon, peanut butter, etc) to sandwich the ice cream (chocolate, mint, vanilla, etc). The ice cream is homemade and it was very delicious.

"Came to this place for lunch on Sunday around 3 pm and sat by the bar.  The bartender was friendly and attentive.  Like how we get to write on the laminated menu with a marker as to what we want.  We got the special meatballs with the special sauce, vegetable meatball with pesto sauce and a side of greens. Everything was delicious... Never thought vegetable meatballs could have so much flavor and the pesto sauce went great with it.  We also got 2 chicken sliders for free!!! Definitely a cool and laid back place!",5.0
Definitely overrated.The meatballs are pretty tasteless and mushy. Tried all of them except the veggie.

"I hate to do this. Look at my record - I'm a positive reviewer! But the meatball shop sucked a big one this time, and I need to finally reveal this. I want to love the meatball shop SO BADLY. it is always my first suggestion when brainstorming dinner spots (ALWAYS shot down....should have seen that as a warning....) and I can so easily get a meatball boner super fast. That's the thing, you eat there once and it's like, zoing! The slightest scent in the air and you're dripping (from your mouth, sicko) for more balls!

If my boyfriend finishes his meal before a server looks at me long enough to relate to them that my meal is incorrect, something is wrong. When things are this wrong, you should fix it.  A simple cookie would have done the trick. But instead we sat for another almost half an hour before we went up to the register and got our bill ourselves.

"Wholey guacamole! My friend and I came here on a whim since Sweet Chick was closed today and it was so close to The Meatball Shop. The ambiance is very friendly and the music is quite on point according to my friend. We went in, sat at 2 seats by the bar. The bartender was super nice, asked us what drinks we wanted and was really approachable. He asked us if it was our first time here and when we answered yes, he tried to strike a conversation with us which was great! I love the small talk but we also ended up getting some jello shots which were amaze-balls! It's been years since I've taken Jello shots but it brought back some really good memories.  The menu is super simple and their kitchen is pretty small. They make the food basically in front of you with their meatballs of many varieties. Their special meatball of the day was a venison, veal, and some other meat mixed with a cumberland sauce. When I heard venison and veal, my mind was blown and I knew that I absolutely had to order this hopefully juicy delight. All you had to do was check a bunch of things off on a laminated menu and hand it off to them to do their magic and 15 minutes later, a plate and bowl of magical goodness shows up in your face! You can also order sides for $5 extra and I ended up getting a market salad along with 4 meatballs and bread. The meatballs were just what I expected and hoped and dreamed it would be. It definitely had a different texture compared to your normal beef or pork meatballs in that it was a tad bit gamier but the incorporation of the veal definitely mellowed out the gaminess. The cumberland sauce was also something I had no idea about but my current motto being YOLO, I decided to give it a chance. The slight fruitiness paired so well with everything from the bread to the meatballs. It was great! The salad was a bit lackluster compared to the meatballs. Overall, I would definitely come back for the service and the food. The location is quite good and seems to be an up and coming area in Williamsburg so I thought you can't really go wrong with eating here!",5.0

"I want to give this place a fair review. I don't want to give it one star. But if you think like I do, you'll appreciate this review and you won't come here.You walk in here, and it's like a frat/hipster party joined forces and created one really loud restaurant. Certainly not a place for a date, for anyone ofter 40, or for your mother. Someone told every hipster in Williamsburg that this was the ""cool"" place to eat, so they started instagraming photos, and now no one can really enjoy it.The menu is ridiculous. I'm sorry, but making references to ""balls"" and penises every 5 seconds does not make me hungry for an Italian Sub. Grow up, get a grown up menu, and maybe I'll come back.

"This ain't the Manhattan Meatball ShopI might be saying that bc I came here on a Saturday night at 3am. I understand, the quality may not have as been as top notch. I felt my food was luke warm and not as fresh as it could've been. The service, specials, prices, and options are all the same as the MH location. I just think it was better over there. The positive that this place has, is that it's not overcrowded on a weekend night at 3am, and the bathroom line is not 20 ppl deep.",3.0

If my boyfriend finishes his meal before a server looks at me long enough to relate to them that my meal is incorrect, something is wrong. When things are this wrong, you should fix it.  A simple cookie would have done the trick. But instead we sat for another almost half an hour before we went up to the register and got our bill ourselves. I worked at a restaurant in Times Square....I know how much it can suck....but when you mess you, you own up. I just want you. You make it so damn difficult. It's annoying.",2.0
"Wholey guacamole! My friend and I came here on a whim since Sweet Chick was closed today and it was so close to The Meatball Shop. The ambiance is very friendly and the music is quite on point according to my friend. We went in, sat at 2 seats by the bar. The bartender was super nice, asked us what drinks we wanted and was really approachable. He asked us if it was our first time here and when we answered yes, he tried to strike a conversation with us which was great! I love the small talk but we also ended up getting some jello shots which were amaze-balls! It's been years since I've taken Jello shots but it brought back some really good memories.  The menu is super simple and their kitchen is pretty small. They make the food basically in front of you with their meatballs of many varieties. Their special meatball of the day was a venison, veal, and some other meat mixed with a cumberland sauce. When I heard venison and veal, my mind was blown and I knew that I absolutely had to order this hopefully juicy delight. All you had to do was check a bunch of things off on a laminated menu and hand it off to them to do their magic and 15 minutes later, a plate and bowl of magical goodness shows up in your face! You can also order sides for $5 extra and I ended up getting a market salad along with 4 meatballs and bread. The meatballs were just what I expected and hoped and dreamed it would be. It definitely had a different texture compared to your normal beef or pork meatballs in that it was a tad bit gamier but the incorporation of the veal definitely mellowed out the gaminess. The cumberland sauce was also something I had no idea about but my current motto being YOLO, I decided to give it a chance. The slight fruitiness paired so well with everything from the bread to the meatballs. It was great! The salad was a bit lackluster compared to the meatballs. Overall, I would definitely come back for the service and the food. The location is quite good and seems to be an up and coming area in Williamsburg so I thought you can't really go wrong with eating here!",5.0

"I want to give this place a fair review. I don't want to give it one star. But if you think like I do, you'll appreciate this review and you won't come here.You walk in here, and it's like a frat/hipster party joined forces and created one really loud restaurant. Certainly not a place for a date, for anyone ofter 40, or for your mother. Someone told every hipster in Williamsburg that this was the ""cool"" place to eat, so they started instagraming photos, and now no one can really enjoy it.The menu is ridiculous. I'm sorry, but making references to ""balls"" and penises every 5 seconds does not make me hungry for an Italian Sub. Grow up, get a grown up menu, and maybe I'll come back. But don't worry, the hipsters will still all be there.",1.0
"This ain't the Manhattan Meatball ShopI might be saying that bc I came here on a Saturday night at 3am. I understand, the quality may not have as been as top notch. I felt my food was luke warm and not as fresh as it could've been. The service, specials, prices, and options are all the same as the MH location. I just think it was better over there. The positive that this place has, is that it's not overcrowded on a weekend night at 3am, and the bathroom line is not 20 ppl deep.",3.0
The pesto meatballs were fantastic. Also great service!,4.0
"I had a great lunch here with the husband. I love that you can pick your meatball type and sauce separately and then get sides either in the same bowl or separately. I wasn't in the mood for something super heavy so I got the spicy pork with spicy meat sauce and had some collard greens with garlic confit on the side. It was just the right amount of food. Hubs had the special-Cuban meatballs with a cornichon/mustard cream sauce and white beans on the side. He said the beans were ""eh"". He also ordered a single slider so he could try the mushroom sauce and said that was really good. Service was pretty good-slightly slow but it was really busy. Bonus points for clean bathroom with cool old Victorian photos and a nice smelling Mrs Meyers basil candle.",5.0
The meatballs were pretty good but not as good as I was expecting. They had a nice variation. I had the beef with spicy meat sauce and spicy pork with tomato sauce sliders. The spicy pork was the better of the two. I look forward to going back and trying more sauces and the special meatballs. Hoping that when I go back that it will live up to the hype and that I was there on an off night.,3.0
"Excellent spot, but doesn't live up to the hype. I like seemingly every other NY'er tried to go to the Meatball Shop's LES location several times, and each time, was greeted with a wait of 2+ hours, so I'd end up finding a new locale. I was excited after finding out they were opening an NYC location in my hood, but after all the fanfare, it's doesn't seem to worth the wait. That's not to see it's not a good place to get your meatball on. It is. You go in, you check off your requested balls and accompanying sauce and sides on their menu and your food comes out super quickly. Everything is pretty good and tastes better than your average meatball. That being said, it's just a place that serves meatballs. Nothing more, nothing less. Not worth the wait sadly.",3.0
"My friends and I were in New York only for 3 nights, but we liked TMS so much that we went to 2 different locations during our stay.Our first night I had a slider of the classic beef with spicy meat sauce as a post-bar hopping snack.  When we went back for dinner I chose to get the same combination as the naked balls with a side of spinach.4 meatballs doesn't sound like much but it's pretty deceivingly filling.  I actually liked it as a slider more but maybe I was just hungrier that time.",4.0

"Ahhhhh, The Meatball Shop.  A place where the purp drank flows, the jello shots are always changing, and the bartenders know your name (because you're actually friends with them).  I am into everything about The Meatball Shop, from the throw-back playlists, to the attractive staff (and loyal clientele), to the daily specials that stop me in my tracks while strolling down Bedford Ave. Literally, once I was so excited over some green kale vegan ball special I ran into the sign on the street, knocked it over, and dragged my friend out of the road for an afternoon early dinner snack. Personally, I like to sit at the bar and enjoy easy chit chat with a round of drinks while doodling on the cute dry erase menus but also would like to check out the back garden, looks like it would be a good spot for a loud group. Also, props to the bathroom. I dig the bathroom, here and someday hope to have one just like it.Now, on to the good stuff, the go to order : NAKED VEGAN* BALLS (similar to falafel) with pesto sauce over a bowl of creamy polenta.

Maybe someday? Not really concerned.A second option, in case you are prepping for bathing suit season or some ""cleanse"" : Everything But The Kitchen Sink. This dish wins second place in my heart, and is exactly what you think it may be. A brilliant chefs choice mish-mosh of greenmarket veggies & salad, with your choice of balls. The special market salads and sides are always fantastic, but the ice cream sandwich specials are really what did it for me. Let me just explain the freedom you are grated at The Meatball Shop to pair your voice of ice cream with not one, but TWO different cookies. Top & bottom baby, switch 'em up. Get messy, get creative. My last concoction was a toasted brown sugar ice cream smashed between a dark chocolate cookie & a peanut butter choco chip. Heaven.So long story short, bring your mom, dad, bro, bestie, boo, (or ex-boo) to The Meatball Shop. There is something here for anyone whose opinion is worth having. And holy hell, try and save room for dessert. Or just remember to wear your fat pants.*Additional props to their vegan consciousness as during a recent visit when I ordered the waiter warned me the polenta was made with chicken stock, and made sure that was okay.

"Meatball Shop is a hit or miss depending on one's innate ability to choose the right ball and sauce combinations.  Unless you are tipsy/drunk and starving then all combinations will taste amazing.  To test my theory... it's no coincidence the storefront is smacked right on Bedford Avenue in the Burg and the other location carefully placed right in the heart of the LES; both neighborhoods are synonymous with their great bars and both locations are opened until 4 am.. strategically operated I must say to cater to the drunk masses of course!  ...hence the stellar reviews.Mash potatoes and foccaccia are always tasty but meatballs are never memorable or flavorful.  However, I did try a daily meatball special with special sauce which turned out pretty decent.  I believe they were Parmesan balls, but then again everything tastes great cheesy.Avoid the Purple Punch at all cost unless you want to reminiscent back to your childhood favorite cough syrup Dimetapp.  The failed concoction on grape kool-aid jungle juice would probably taste better if the red fruit punch version was used.If you must insist on trying their food, may I suggest you to order for takeout and enjoy on the front stoop across the street.  It beats waiting an hour+ for subpar food.",2.0

"I like this place! Mostly for the music. So annoying seeing people come in just to get ice cream sandwiches, I mean, GEEZ - what a fucking BRILLIANT idea!!!! No, really! Just brilliant. You can build your own ice cream sandwich and even put two different cookies on it... And choose from different ice creams such as vanilla, chocolate, mint, ricotta strawberry (do I lie? Perhaps I do lie) and brown sugar was last night's special... I didn't get it because I got one the night before!!!!!!!! With Chocolate walnut brownie cookie (omg sticky like a real brownie) and a chocolate hazelnut cookie!!!!! AHH!!! SO GOOD!!!! With a Narragansett Tall Boy - what could be dreamier?!?!?!?!??!!? I tell ya - Saturday night, they played Portishead and TV on the Radio. Dreamy. Just been getting the veggie meatballs - really quite delish. They taste like thanksgiving which makes me suspect they're made of STUFFING. But who knows? Next time will get the pesto - which is chunky and dark green basil and pine nuts. Been getting the tomato sauce which is good. The foccacia is just meh. PRO TIP: make the markers RED so that it's easier to see what we order. Fun to mark off on the menu directly what you want.

"It's obvious from the star I'm not a fan of this place. My boyfriend & I went in on a Saturday night trying to grab a bite to eat before having some drinks elsewhere. The first thing we noticed was the smell of vomit and cleaning chemicals. Stupidly, we decided to ignore it and still grab a bite to eat because the place had rave reviews and it was a Saturday so who knew what happened earlier.Big mistake. The first problem was that all of their meatballs are somehow involved with pork in the cooking process. I asked for a beef meatballs and was told all meatballs except vegetarian would involve this cooking process with pork. I reluctantly decided to go on with my order and got the spicy sauce. My boyfriend also got beef balls with the pesto sauce.The balls came out after about 15 minutes, lukewarm and looking unappetizing. We gingerly dug in and found they tasted as bad as they looked. My spicy sauce wasn't even mild. I enjoyed my boyfriend's pesto sauce more but it was still nothing to write home about. All and all the food was not up to par for a place that ONLY makes meatballs. They should be right every single time.Service was also horrible. Our server wandered around the empty restaurant but hardly ever seemed to make it to our table. It was very annoying. In fact, when we wanted to get the check we had to flag down the bartender in the front because we refused to wait anymore.The only okay thing about this place was the purple punch drink we got.

"Meatball Shop is a hit or miss depending on one's innate ability to choose the right ball and sauce combinations.  Unless you are tipsy/drunk and starving then all combinations will taste amazing.  To test my theory... it's no coincidence the storefront is smacked right on Bedford Avenue in the Burg and the other location carefully placed right in the heart of the LES; both neighborhoods are synonymous with their great bars and both locations are opened until 4 am.. strategically operated I must say to cater to the drunk masses of course!  ...hence the stellar reviews.Mash potatoes and foccaccia are always tasty but meatballs are never memorable or flavorful.  However, I did try a daily meatball special with special sauce which turned out pretty decent.  I believe they were Parmesan balls, but then again everything tastes great cheesy.Avoid the Purple Punch at all cost unless you want to reminiscent back to your childhood favorite cough syrup Dimetapp.  The failed concoction on grape kool-aid jungle juice would probably taste better if the red fruit punch version was used.If you must insist on trying their food, may I suggest you to order for takeout and enjoy on the front stoop across the street.  It beats waiting an hour+ for subpar food.",2.0

"I love this place and make a point to come regularly.  Great food, locally sourced when possible, and hot damn the chicken balls are amazing (coming from a red meat lover that's serious).  The only point off is for wait time that's just due to it being so busy/tasty.   Top off your meal with some cheap PBR and/or jello shots to do it right.",4.0
"This is a very laid back place, can be good for a date or a lunch/dinner with a friend.  A friend of mine put me on to it, I don't eat meat n he's like don't worry. Guess what, they have veggie meatballs, no meat. Vegetarians come hither. Sooo it's not pricey, a little hipster vibe to it. Come try it, it's a pretty good spot. Y I'm not giving it a five IDK, don't want to be too liberal.  And the selection of drafts at the bar are quite vast if I recall correctly. Can't think of any cons. Bon Appetit.",4.0
"I like this place! Mostly for the music. So annoying seeing people come in just to get ice cream sandwiches, I mean, GEEZ - what a fucking BRILLIANT idea!!!! No, really! Just brilliant. You can build your own ice cream sandwich and even put two different cookies on it... And choose from different ice creams such as vanilla, chocolate, mint, ricotta strawberry (do I lie? Perhaps I do lie) and brown sugar was last night's special... I didn't get it because I got one the night before!!!!!!!! With Chocolate walnut brownie cookie (omg sticky like a real brownie) and a chocolate hazelnut cookie!!!!! AHH!!! SO GOOD!!!! With a Narragansett Tall Boy - what could be dreamier?!?!?!?!??!!? I tell ya - Saturday night, they played Portishead and TV on the Radio. Dreamy. Just been getting the veggie meatballs - really quite delish. They taste like thanksgiving which makes me suspect they're made of STUFFING. But who knows? Next time will get the pesto - which is chunky and dark green basil and pine nuts. Been getting the tomato sauce which is good. The foccacia is just meh. PRO TIP: make the markers RED so that it's easier to see what we order. Fun to mark off on the menu directly what you want.

"I visited this place with a few friends on a trip to NYC and was so pleasantly surprised that it killed me. The food was delicious, the service was great, and it was amazingly reasonably priced. LOVE IT, and wish that we had something similar in Vancouver. I am also going to make a few recommendations about this place:(1) you can either order 4 meatballs with a piece of focaccia (regular way to order their meatballs), or you can order a ""meatball smash"", which is two meatballs on a brioche bun with a bunch of greens on the side. ORDER THE MEATBALL SMASH.  (2) There is also a large selection of sides available ORDER THE MASHED POTATOES. They are pure heaven. I also ordered the broccoli, which was good, and if you want more veggies and are sharing with someone, those two side might be awesome. Ordering more than one side for one person would be way too much food. (3) Lastly, get an icecream sandwich. Just do it. You will be so full at the end of the meal that you will want to die, but they are absolutely wonderful. You get to make your own selection of cookies (or different cookies for each side) as well as your icecream flavour. The day I was there, the flavour of the day was creme fraiche.

"Saturday night, and the restaurant was booming like a loud hip hop club. Really?  I came for meatballs,  not for loud hip hop ruining any ability to converse.Food was ok. My plain beef meatball with red sauce was nice, with just the right amount of sauce. My man's dish, on the other hand, was nearly inedible. A recommended combo of the special, lamb with pine nuts, and pesto sauce. It was so oily that his face was dripping with oil, literally. Despite that, the lamb was very mild and lacked flavor.On the plus side, portions are pretty decent and most dishes are about ten bucks. Decor is also cute, diy old black and white pictue style.",3.0
Visited this place for the first time last week and i was so pleasantly surprised. I'm usually not a fan of meatballs at restaurants but I loved them. I had the classic beef with the classic tomato sauce and it was so yummy. I tasted some of my boyfriends chicken meatball and they were delicious as well. I would definitely recommend trying this place out. I also had the vanilla ice cream sandwich and it was out of this world.,5.0
There was an hour wait and it was crazy crowded BUT I was with good friends so we had a few drinks and laughs while we waited. I had the spicy pork with spicy meat sauce...very good! The braised kale was good as well. I will definitely return and try the mushroom gravy. Good eats at a good price.,3.0

"Dont get me wrong, i appreciate their food, especially the kitchen sink dish, its great. And the service is good as well, but daaaaang its loud. I've never walked out of a restaurant cause they were too loud. They blast their music, which makes it so customers have to yell. If i wanted loud music and people yelling all around me, i would just go to a dive bar, but i wanted this to be a dining experience. The first time i noticed it was when i was on a date there and couldnt hear a word my date was saying. I thought to myself ""well, at least i can just bring my dudes here since it might not be the best date spot"". But it was the same, we were just yelling at each other all night. And the final time I went in there was with a friend from out of town, i warned her it was loud, we walked in, the hostess said something i couldnt quite hear, so i said ""excuse me what did you say?"" and she replied with ""Im sorry, what did you say?"". I laughed to myself and we left. It pains me to only leave 2 stars to an establishment i actually like, but i havent had to just walk out of a place, and ive walked out of this place a couple times.",2.0

"We frequent The Meatball Shop quite often. We thought today's meal would be on par with our past experiences. Wrong.We sat by the window because there were no tables for two available. After waiting 10 minutes, I asked the hostess for a change of seat. There still weren't any ""tables"" available so she suggested to get the waitress for us. It took us another 15 minutes for the waitress to tend to us after she took care of all the people that sat down AFTER US. Our waitress, Jennette, never apologized for her negligence, tell us the specials of the day, give us utensils, or check to see if the meal was OK. We asked the busboy (who should have been our waiter because he was attentive as hell) for the check. How long did it take for the waitress to return with our check? Oh, that took another 10 minutes. If I walked out without paying, I'm almost positive Jennette would have never notice. Worst experience ever!",1.0
"Came here for a Sunday lunch around 12:30 with my husband .  The place is inviting, the service is good.  The reason for average rating:- Got vegetarian and beef meatballs, both were DRY and rather uninspiring, although the sauces (marinara and pesto) and the sides (mashed potatoes and sautéed spinach) were very good.  - Loud music.  For 12:30pm on a Sunday, neither us, nor several tables around us were looking to be pumped up.  We wanted a relaxing brunch and a light background music to allow us to enjoy conversations.  After we asked to turn the music down, twice, nothing happened.  Apparently the response was ""they can leave if they don't like it', which one table ended up doing.  Owners/managers - please recognize that Wburg is not all young kids, who were probably not even up from the night before.  It looks like families with children and couples who've left partying years behind are disrespected.  I will not be back and will not recommend this place for lunch.",3.0
"Five stars for the food, negative two stars for the horrible hostess.My friend planned her birthday party here (a whole month before hand, by the way) Food was paid in advance for eight people. We had the pork, chicken and beef meat balls. With BBQ, classic, spicy and parmesan sauce. Yummmmm the meat balls and each sauce tasted soooo good. We also had roasted parsnips, arugula salad, and rigatoni pasta, which equally satiated my hunger.  The sangria was amazing, while the harvey wallbanger jello shots were a pass for me. We ended the dinner with a chocolate chip cookie with mint ice cream; the ice cream tasted like fresh mint which was so refreshing after having such a heavy meal.So why do you ask is the rating three stars? As I had mentioned, my friend planned her birthday a month in advance. Our reservation was for 8pm, when we got there the hostess said it would be a 5 minute wait. After 10 minutes, she said it would be another 5 minutes. By 8:20 the hostess finally admitted that they had seated a 4 person party at a 8 person table and was waiting for them to leave to seat us. If you had reservations set at 8 pm, why would you seat someone without mentioning ""we can seat you but you need to be out by 8 for a reservations""? Meanwhile, the hostess kept walking away from her post so NO ONE was getting seated. by 8:40 my friend the (birthday girl) was upset; so much so that she wanted to leave but we had already prepaid for the dinner since we had such a large party.  If we were told we would be waiting so long we would've atleast sat at the bar and had a drink.  Not until we started complaining to the manager were we seated, the whole seating issue ruined the night for my friend :(   so although I loved the meatballs, I'll never be going back with a large party.",3.0

We asked her if we received the right one & although we liked the lemonade we gave feed back that there was no orange taste in it.  If you are going to say something has orange in it, it should taste of orange.  The waitress decided that she needed to summarize our feelings out loud by saying ""So you're saying you like it, but there is no orange in it?"" with a sour attitude.  After, I ordered the special meatball which she called the sausage  & peppers meatball (it was actually pork sausage  & fennel) with the spicy pork sauce.  She literally erased what I had marked down & told me to get the special sauce which was the pepper sauce.  I like going to the meatball shop because I can customize my meal.  Why are you telling me what to order crazy lady?I told her I didn't like the sauce & she made a face at me.  She asked me what I wanted & I told her I wanted what I originally ordered & she told me that if I was getting the spicy meat sauce I should get the pork meat balls.

"Twice in two days = Love at first Bite! The Meatball Shop has a great concept / affordable comfort food / in a truly inviting environment! I was visiting New York - specifically Williamsburg in Brooklyn and my son told me of this wonderful restaurant in his neighborhood - I knew it had to be affordable because he is a post-graduate trying to earn his keep in the city! Off we went to the Meatball Shop and I fell in love! The way the menu is presented - your choices / your plate. Simple and personable. Five meats (well, one of the choices is vegan - so proper) / five sauces - put an X on the grid and voila! - no more than 20 minutes later you have your own personalized meatball plate! The same goes, by the way with the sliders and even the cocktails - choose gin, vodka, prosecco,rum and then four choices of fabulous spices - one feels like a mixologist in the making! I chose a Prosecco with Lavender and was not disappointed.  Next day we were in the Village - in the city - and between the rain and cold (being from Miami these two can kill the mood very quickly) I saw from afar - like a person lost in the desert for couple of days - the Meatball Shop once again! Ran for it and its delish comforting meatballs, sat at a family-style table and enjoyed a fantastic time with my son and soon enough our table neighbors.  Thanks to Meatball Shop for making my 3-day stay in NYC so pleasant! Like Meatloaf would say ""2 out of 3 ain't bad"" with so many restaurant choices!",4.0

"the williamsburg location of meatball shop is just as good as the original in LES.with 3 people around 1:45pm on a rainy saturday afternoon, we didn't have to wait for a table! unheard of! got the veggie meatball mash (parmesan sauce on the brioche sandwich)  which was perfect. just amazing. every bite was awesome. of course, had to get the ice cream sandwich. huge ass scoop of brown sugar ice cream, with a snickerdoodle on top, brownie walnut cookie on bottom. mouthgasm.that being said, i am someone who refuses to wait over an hour to be seated. meatball shop is famous for the insane wait, and i feel lucky i came at an off-time . i would never wait that long, no matter how good the food is, same goes for clinton street baking.so, come at an off time and enjoy.",5.0

"I'm a sucker for balls in my mouth. Unfortunately since my cholesterol intake has been wonky since last year, I've had to cut down on my meat consumption. While I enjoy veggies as much as the next girl, they shouldn't replaced a scrumptious and juicy ball of beef. A lentil ball with cucumber sauce isn't the sauce as a genuine meatball with chunky tomato sauce!That aside, the Brooklyn location of The Meatball Shop is great. It's a lot roomier than the Stanton location, our waitress was crazy chill, and the vibe was a lot authentically cooler for me.

"This was really good. I went on a Saturday night.  The hostess looked at us and was like, come with me, but tell everyone you were waiting an hour. We were promptly seated. She became me and my date's favorite person. I got just a straight up meatball sub. Oh and a spicy pork slider with mushroom gravy, which was amazing. Both were really good. My date got the special meatball (a steak cheddar and bacon meatball) in parmesean cheese sauce. That was absurdly rich. It was good, but really really decadent. I couldn't do more than half of one. My favorite part was dessert. Ice cream sandwich. Snickerdoodle cookie with caramel ice cream. It was awesome. There's just something about eating an ice cream sandwich that makes you feel good. Service was great, mark what you want on the menu. It was fast once we put an order in, but there was no rush to get us to leave and we were able to enjoy our meal.",4.0
"Hello Delicious!!  What A nice find.  Meatballs done fresh, tasty and fun.  Prices are fair, staff is friendly and helps you through the menu if you're new and the food is wonderful.  Portions are a nice size and everything was clean.  I went here with a friend and we got two meatball sandwiches.  All customized and yum!  I certainly recommend this place for a quick or long meal.  Decorations are fitting and you feel comfortable from the moment you walk in.Enjoy!",4.0
"I've never tried the meatballs here.  I can't.  It kind of sucks (gluten intolerant).HOWEVER, they have great cocktail specials, with fresh herbs and a choice of liquors.  Really refreshing. I remember having a whiskey with honey, lemon and lavender that was amazing, if I recall correctly.  These are worth the visit, alone.I've been here twice and the sides were really nicely done.  The polenta was cheesy, soft and tasty.  The Daily greens that I had were nicely spiced and prepared.  The roast veggies were very tasty and not overcooked, with just the right spice balance.My only sticking point here was the risotto.  Although the flavor and parts of cheese-to-rice were very nicely done with just the right tang, Risotto really needs to be cooked longer.  However, it was not overly heavy, which was very nice.I highly recommend trying the freshly made ice creams.  I have sampled a few and they are out of this world.  Apparently they make a fabulous cookie ice cream sandwich, but it's off limits to me.I like the waiter-ing style here, where they pull up a seat and get you familiar with the menu.  It's kind of a fun twist.",4.0
"I was asked by my family to look for an inexpensive yummy place not too far from my home so that we all could all go out and eat on a Friday night.  I used my food bible.... Yelp!  I came across this place and it had great reviews!  Only reason that I won't give it the extra star is because the wait was crazy!  We waited almost an hour to get a table for 6.   Honestly though we were all happy that we waited.  Food was great, prices were good and service was excellent....... Music was also perfect for me!  Old school hip hop playing plus a friendly clientele.... Awesome!  Go! Go! Go!  Word of advice maybe go on a weekday when Williamsburg isn't so hectic!",4.0
"Twice in two days = Love at first Bite! The Meatball Shop has a great concept / affordable comfort food / in a truly inviting environment! I was visiting New York - specifically Williamsburg in Brooklyn and my son told me of this wonderful restaurant in his neighborhood - I knew it had to be affordable because he is a post-graduate trying to earn his keep in the city! Off we went to the Meatball Shop and I fell in love! The way the menu is presented - your choices / your plate. Simple and personable. Five meats (well, one of the choices is vegan - so proper) / five sauces - put an X on the grid and voila! - no more than 20 minutes later you have your own personalized meatball plate! The same goes, by the way with the sliders and even the cocktails - choose gin, vodka, prosecco,rum and then four choices of fabulous spices - one feels like a mixologist in the making! I chose a Prosecco with Lavender and was not disappointed.  Next day we were in the Village - in the city - and between the rain and cold (being from Miami these two can kill the mood very quickly) I saw from afar - like a person lost in the desert for couple of days - the Meatball Shop once again! Ran for it and its delish comforting meatballs, sat at a family-style table and enjoyed a fantastic time with my son and soon enough our table neighbors.  Thanks to Meatball Shop for making my 3-day stay in NYC so pleasant! Like Meatloaf would say ""2 out of 3 ain't bad"" with so many restaurant choices!",4.0
"I came here for the first time on 2/28 and it was amazing.  Everyone was so friendly, the atmosphere was cool and the food was great.  I had the spicy pork meatballs on a hero with mozarella and sauce.  The amount of food is perfect.  The cookies were soooo good too.  I definitely would come here again.",5.0
"the williamsburg location of meatball shop is just as good as the original in LES.with 3 people around 1:45pm on a rainy saturday afternoon, we didn't have to wait for a table! unheard of! got the veggie meatball mash (parmesan sauce on the brioche sandwich)  which was perfect. just amazing. every bite was awesome. of course, had to get the ice cream sandwich. huge ass scoop of brown sugar ice cream, with a snickerdoodle on top, brownie walnut cookie on bottom. mouthgasm.that being said, i am someone who refuses to wait over an hour to be seated. meatball shop is famous for the insane wait, and i feel lucky i came at an off-time . i would never wait that long, no matter how good the food is, same goes for clinton street baking.so, come at an off time and enjoy.",5.0
"This place is overrated. The meatballs are small and dry, they never give you enough sauce and the bread is dry and stiff.

(Un Forgettable Food) at the Meatball Shop.  There is so much to choose from, so many flavor profiles to create and there are even specials of the day.  Special meatball, special sauce, special salad, special risotto, special lemonade, special cocktail, special jello shot and the best thing of all...ice cream sandwiches and of course, an option for special cookie and ice cream!  I will continue to be a follower of the Meatball Shop.  My rep is on the line for great recommendations and I'm still gravy baby!!",5.0
"I'm a sucker for balls in my mouth. Unfortunately since my cholesterol intake has been wonky since last year, I've had to cut down on my meat consumption. While I enjoy veggies as much as the next girl, they shouldn't replaced a scrumptious and juicy ball of beef. A lentil ball with cucumber sauce isn't the sauce as a genuine meatball with chunky tomato sauce!That aside, the Brooklyn location of The Meatball Shop is great. It's a lot roomier than the Stanton location, our waitress was crazy chill, and the vibe was a lot authentically cooler for me. The highlights of my meal were my special rhubarb cocktail, white beans, and mint/brownie ice cream sandwich. Truly brilliant specs in my overall meal.

"You know, I'm always pretty hungry. I'm a fan of your usual run of the mill, big meals like cheeseburgers and fried chicken and such. I never really got into all these hip, specialized places popping up all over the place. Well, my girlfriend and I gave The Meatball Shop a shot after she started a list of all the best pesto places in NYC without having any idea that we were actually inside one of the city's most popular eateries.First off, this is a type of place where you pick every single thing that's going to appear on your plate. You pick what kind of meatball, what kind of sauce, what kind of side, right down to where the dudes in the kitchen will pit your meatball on. I had a traditional beef meatball with a mushroom sauce and some risotto on the side. Two small bowls of food barely the side of your hand but wow, does it fill you up. The meatballs were so flavorful and juicy. I think I was little embarrassed that I scarfed down four of them like a vacuum. Really, the small portions of this place doesn't matter because it will fill you up with how good those pieces are. Although I saw a guy get a hero sandwich and that was pretty huge so there's that.We also had some pretty great and tangy lemonade which I guess changes every night. Some nights they have grapefruit lemonade, some nights others. Refreshing stuff. Awesome touch.Now here's the killer. They have a pretty mouth-watering ice cream sandwich menu. Keeping true to the you-pick-everything format of the place, we got to pick what kind of cookie and ice cream our desert will be made with. I ordered a brownie walnut cookie with vanilla ice cream and HOLY JESUS. It was so delicious that I almost wish I didn't eat so many meatballs. PRO TIP: Leave room for the ice cream sandwich because it's as big a star in this place as the meatballs. The one drawback is that this places is ALWAYS full, I heard. Sometimes, it's over an hour wait. If you're planning to have dinner here, do it at an odd later time or early like 5-6pm.",5.0
"I love this place! So tasty. As a vegetarian I order the veggie meatballs with parm sauce and it's always amazing. I used to always order the risotto underneath, but lately I've been ordering everything but the kitchen sink salad and it's so good! So many different veggies and it's always a different mix. The only issue I have with the meatball shop is them calling their gravy ""mushroom gravy"".  Once my waiter saw that I ordered veggie balls he told me that the ""mushroom gravy"" included chicken stock and therefore wasn't vegetarian. I tweeted to the meatball shop about it and they told me they call it mushroom because it's mostly mushroom with some chicken... I still think that they should change the name to chicken gravy or change their stock to veggie stock... Also they have amazing cocktails and ice cream sandwiches! All around good time.",4.0
"One of my girlfriends wanted to have her birthday brunch here, for 15. She'd never been to the Meatball Shop on Stanton Street, but I told her there was NO WAY the 15 of us would ever get in there. 'd heard that this location was bigger, so we planned it for a Sunday afternoon.First of all, the staff was super friendly and patient. They gave us ample time with the menu and came quite frequently to check on us and offer help. Even though part of our party was missing, they didn't rush us at all and let us take our sweet ass time. Constructing your meal is always a lot of fun; no one had the same permutation of balls/bread/starch/veg. My usual MO is to order the spicy pork balls, which did not disappoint - spicy, juicy, tender, meaty. Just the way I like my balls. I got them naked, smothered in pesto, which was actually quite mild but fresh and rustic. Lots of basil and pine nuts, not too much garlic or oil - all of this goodness was on top of rigatoni.  Oh, and I gilded the lily with some family jewels, aka a fried egg. My meal was perfect; the pesto compliments the spice and fat of the pork quite nicely. I also ordered the veg of the day, the roasted squash with orange zest and breadcrumbs, and it was nicely done. My ice cream sandwich was a delicious gingerbread/brown sugar ice cream concoction. Everyone else was very satisfied with the food, and the price.

"I have friends over from out of town and they wanted to go to Williamsburg. I've never been there before but luckily my co-worker lives there. So I asked him what were nice places to go to nd he told me about this place. Intrigued by the 'meatballs with different sauces served in different ways menu, I decided to bring my friends there.  The restaurant was easy to find since we were walking across the street. We were lucky enough to get seats outside, so we could enjoy the fresh air and Williamsburg's uniqueness. The waiter gave us the menus right away and was helpful in suggesting the good stuff, but when he left us to decide what we were gonna get, he didn't come back to get our orders at all. My friend had to go inside and call the waiters attention - that was turn off #1. So finally we tell him what we want and waited for the food. We kept talking so we didn't really notice that 20 minutes has passed and we still didn't have our food. Plus, we were there at 8ish on a TUESDAY night.

He shrugged and said 'i don't know how long its gonna take.' tsk tsk. Anyway, so we asked for our drinks again and he said he'd be right back with them. unfortunately, our drinks arrived after the meal. It felt more like we had soda for dessert. So as soon as he served the drinks, we asked for our bill and the waiter was back in 2 minutes! Wow, if only the delivery of food and drinks was that fast. After giving us the bill, instead of waiting for us to pay, he left again! And we had to wait another 10 minutes and ended up giving our payment to some other waiter.

Given that it was only 4pm (hardly peak hour) and they're well staffed, I don't see a reasonable excuse.As for my lunch (*ugh*): I ordered four sliders (one vegetarian, one beef, two chicken) and a side of collared greens with squash. Though I enjoyed the side and the vegetarian slider was okay, my beef slider was slightly undercooked and both my chicken sliders were pink all the way through.

"Horrible!Came here last night @ 7:45 looking for a table of 6 and was told it would be a 90 minute wait. Ouch, that sucks but I get it.. we are a somewhat large group and it's prime time for dinner. The girl at the front told our name and number and said she would call when our table was ready.We would have liked to grab beers at the bar and but there was no room and it was a zoo! We went to a bar down the street and waited. After an hour and 15 minutes we walk back to TMS to see where we were in the 'queqe'. According to the girl she called us 10 minutes ago and gave up our table. WHAT???? We didn't get a missed call or a voicemail, nothing.She tells us that a table is paying up their bill and the table will be ours in 10 -15 minutes. Ok no problem, we can wait another 15 minutes. After 20 minutes we go and check with the girl and she says that the table just ordered desert and it will be another 15 minutes. UGH, I thought you just said they were paying their bill?!?! We wait another 20 minutes and still nothing.This girl was not apologic at all and had a very 'screw you' attitude. I understand places can get busy and all but you need to give people accurate waiting times. It's not acceptable to keep 'dicking around' people. I highly doubt they tried to call us (as they claim they did).I've been to the West village location a bunch of times and have never experienced attitude like this. I 100% won't be going back.

"I've been to their LES and West Village locations several times each and enjoyed them, so after moving to Williamsburg I figured their Bedford location would be a safe bet for a good late afternoon lunch. Whoops--wrong.Service was lackluster at best: though my food came quickly, no one bothered to refill my water or ask about my food. Given that it was only 4pm (hardly peak hour) and they're well staffed, I don't see a reasonable excuse.As for my lunch (*ugh*): I ordered four sliders (one vegetarian, one beef, two chicken) and a side of collared greens with squash. Though I enjoyed the side and the vegetarian slider was okay, my beef slider was slightly undercooked and both my chicken sliders were pink all the way through. Given that chicken needs to be thoroughly cooked to kill off bacteria, this is pretty gross.I've had great meals at their other locations, but I'd stay clear of this one.",1.0
Good Prices.,4.0
"Noisy and seemingly busy, but great that they will text/call when they are ready for you.  I'm definitely not a meatball lover so I am no expert here.  In my view, fairly good meatballs but would not go out of my way to get some.  I prefer the sides to the meatballs ;) polenta and risotto was pretty good!",3.0
"Come one, come ALL!!! They have the Balls...Spicy, vegan, pork, hold a fork. Order red wine it goes fine with the men on the walls, who have the balls, to be recognized for this gluttony of food. Bring a date but don't be late, or she will eat your plate. There isn't a plate you can't create! Just have the balls to be creative. I might be a regular if they expand, to upper manhattan. the menu In hand I will be. I tip my hat to this chain without any hesitation. Bravo MeatBall. Yes I will never say Balls anywhere else...",4.0
I had tried their other location in lower Manhattan last year and found it much better other than the crapped seating.Here I found some fatty bristle in the meatball and the pasta was served cold. Sorry to say I was not impressed with this location.,2.0
"Horrible!Came here last night @ 7:45 looking for a table of 6 and was told it would be a 90 minute wait. Ouch, that sucks but I get it.. we are a somewhat large group and it's prime time for dinner. The girl at the front told our name and number and said she would call when our table was ready.We would have liked to grab beers at the bar and but there was no room and it was a zoo! We went to a bar down the street and waited. After an hour and 15 minutes we walk back to TMS to see where we were in the 'queqe'. According to the girl she called us 10 minutes ago and gave up our table. WHAT???? We didn't get a missed call or a voicemail, nothing.She tells us that a table is paying up their bill and the table will be ours in 10 -15 minutes. Ok no problem, we can wait another 15 minutes. After 20 minutes we go and check with the girl and she says that the table just ordered desert and it will be another 15 minutes. UGH, I thought you just said they were paying their bill?!?! We wait another 20 minutes and still nothing.This girl was not apologic at all and had a very 'screw you' attitude. I understand places can get busy and all but you need to give people accurate waiting times. It's not acceptable to keep 'dicking around' people. I highly doubt they tried to call us (as they claim they did).I've been to the West village location a bunch of times and have never experienced attitude like this. I 100% won't be going back.

"I came here on a saturday night and it was a 2.5 hour wait.WHAT. THE. FUCK.Thankfully, one of the people I was eating with lived nearby, so we got take-out. The restaurant might be a completely different experience. It could have great service, terrible service, shitty bar, awesome staff etc. I just don't know, so this is a review purely of their food, eaten about 15 minutes after it should have been.I got the Kitchen Sink Salad and the smash. The salad had the spicy pork ball and mushroom gravy sauce, with a million fresh veggies and tasty little treats, topped with a fried egg. It was perfectly, exactly what I wanted, evoking the sense of flavor and gorging that is so reminiscent of Thanksgiving and other mass eating holidays.The Smash was the traditional meat with red sauce and mozzarella. As meatball sandwiches go, this was one of the best I've had. Well-cooked and juicy, the meat, sauce and cheese formed this messy mass of flavor, that I'm fairly certain I would eat everyday if I lived a bit closer.Will go again.",4.0
"I picked up dinner before going to a friend's place and he suggested The Meatball Shop. The idea of a meatball dinner was only mildly appealing to me, but the food, and moreover the sauces, convinced me that I could eat a meatball dinner the rest of my days. I ordered the special naked balls of the day - steak, bacon & cheddar - with the classic tomato sauce and the spicy pork meatballs with the spicy sauce and was impressed. I am a big eater, so two orders of four meatballs plus a side of spinach was the right amount of food for me. I wish the portion sizes were larger.If you're ordering takeout, stroll right back to the rear of the restaurant where you'll find menus and the desk where you can place your order. I did not avoid the awkwardness of hanging out by the hostess desk while reading the menu and feeling generally in the way of folks.That feeling of being in the way continued at the takeout desk, but there I at least knew I had a purpose for hanging out and staring with hungry eyes at the glorious meals being prepared in the open kitchen.",5.0

"Pro's--I like that there's a place where I can get a lot of awesome seasonal veggies that arn't overcooked.

I was skeptical of this relative newcomer to the bedford business lineup.  I didnt even know about the LES location.  Silly me to have deprived myself of this feast for sooo long.  Came Memorial day weekend and enjoyed the kitchen sink plate.  MORE IMPORTANTLY however the ICE CREAM SANDWICH ROCKED MY WORLD.  with a scoop of Strawberry Balsamic vinegar between chocolate chip cookies tasting like the most soulful flavor combination ever invented.,4.0
"Today was my first visit to the Meatball Shop and I have a feeling that this could be the beginning of a beautiful relationship. I kept it simple and had the beef meatballs with tomato sauce and spaghetti. The meatballs had the perfect blend of seasonings and textures. The spaghetti was cooked al dente just they way I like it. The tomato sauce was perfection. Finally, on top of this bowl of deliciousness was some wonderful shredded parmesan cheese. To wash it all down I had the special lemonade of the day, cranberry. This was a nice combo of tangy, tart and sweet.The only reason I did not give the place 5 stars was for the service. I sat at the bar which is generally a crap shoot to begin with. The waiter/bar tender was nice, but I would have appreciated a little more attentiveness.I will definitely be back.",4.0
I have to say I like this place. When I heard of it I thought it would be a novelty place that has a good concept but you would forget the food a week later. This wasnt the case.The Bedford location is convenient for me being from Greenpoint but of course it was crowded when I got there with my friends. And usually I would have a rant on hipsters overtaking every inch of the area but interestingly it was a diverse mix of people. The seating is communal for larger groups. I dont quite get it... But the point of coming here is the food. The balls speak for themselves. You have multiple options of how you can order them. I opted for the naked balls with a side of risotto. I chose the classic beef balls with mushroom gravy. While individually they were great as a combination I wouldn't go for it again. But you pick and choose your combination so that is great. The naked balls are essentially 4 balls served with sauce. For an additional price you can order a side.When I got the risotto it was a special favor of fennel I think. It was really zesty. Not too big of a problem but I just didnt expect it to be that way.Summary: Its a fun atmosphere with good food. Worth trying and sampling different combinations.,4.0

Also, the bread was chewy, like it was microwaved, how do you mess up bread?

"We were on our way o Five Leaves, but when we walked past a huge red sign ""MEATBALL"" had to come in and try this place. First of all, I had a huge crush on our server. He was absolutely adorable, fun and easy going. I had a beer/two on an empty stomach so was slightly tipsy and pretty overwhelmed by all the menu options so he just picked what he liked for me. And boy, did he pick something amazing. I can't remember what kind of meatball I had, but it was with the mushroom gravy and pasta. I also got the market salad, which was delicious with lemon zest, greens and BEETS. All and all, very impressed by the food, laid back service. My friends got the sandwich and the spicy meatballs and pasta which was also delicious. The desserts looked good, but unfortunately, I was too full.Location wise, pretty accessible and the space had a lot of natural light. I also really liked the communal, long tables too. Would totally consider coming back the next time I am in town.",5.0
"We consistently enjoy the Meatball Shop.  One of the few places we go to multiple times.  The food is always good, the specials are interesting, the cocktails are nice.  The service is what it is, not the best, not terrible.  Its actually not a terrible place to bring the kids either, though it can be very crowded (and occasionally plays music that isn't so great for little ears).  Still, the kids love the food and they don't seem to notice the music much.",4.0
"Good service, we got seated quickly, I really liked the risotto and the water.  The meatballs on the other hand were quite disappointing to say the least.  I ordered the beef meatballs with mushroom gravy, the meatballs had no flavor and the mushroom gravy tasted like it was Campbell soup cream of mushroom.  I tried some of my girlfriends beef meatballs with tomato sauce, the sauce tasted like tomato soup. Also, the bread was chewy, like it was microwaved, how do you mess up bread? What a joke.  For a place that claims to be a meatball shop, they're lacking in the meatball department.  You'll get better meatballs from subway or in a can of spaghetti-o's.",2.0

"I've heard so much about the illustrious Daniel Holzman, especially with the debut of his Meatball Shop Cookbook, so when my plans to go tour the Brooklyn Brewery with a few friends fell through today (for future reference: only Fridays / Weekends) we turned around and walked to the Bedford Ave. location for a bite. Seeing I just made meatballs, I was eager to experience a new realm of meatball-making.I got the special of the day with the special sauce: buffalo chicken meatball with bleu cheese sauce. It was tender and juicy; the sauce wasn't overpowering; the flavors blended well together. I wish there was a bit more actual heat in the meatballs, however. They weren't particularly spicy, but then again ""buffalo chicken"" usually isn't all that spicy. Or perhaps I just have only minimal taste buds left after dating a guy from Sichuan (a province in China full of VERY spicy food). The sauce was great though--not too thick or heavy as many times the bleu cheese can overwhelm the actual meatball. My friend who didn't also get the special got the classic meatball quartet with spicy meat sauce and a side of risotto. He said the meatballs were delicious but the risotto was so-so. I guess you should only order what the shop is known for.Ambiance was funky and fun, with vintage meat grinders on the wall and photos of (I think?) relevant people. Service was great, the waitress was super friendly and actually gave her opinion on what she liked to eat there (it was rather complicated and detailed, clearly not just a run-of-the-mill answer). I really liked the ""write on the menu"" system as I had to request no bun and it was so easy to just write it on the menu itself, minimizing a chance the waitress would forget. She did forget to refill our water though...hm. I would definitely come back again. It's such a great place to get a full meal, a small bite (1 meatball) or even customize your drinks (you can build cocktails where you pick the kind of alcohol and the kind of flavoring). Just an all-around crowd pleaser.",4.0
"I finally got the chance to come here after hearing all the fuss about it. I had Parmesan cream sauce over spicy pork balls with mash potatoes on the side. The sauce was fantastic. My bf had the spicy beef sauce over classic meatballs with rigatoni. Rigatoni was under-cooked! For dessert, we ordered a ice cream sandwich. We had the brownie cookie with ""mint"" ice cream.

"Just had dinner here for a double date with my college friend Michele W.I really like the concept of The Meatball Shop with it's old timey decor with a nod to modern design.For our table of four I think we got a little bit of everything, spicy pork w/spicy tomato sauce on hero, spicy pork on spaghetti with fried egg, beef with tomato sauce hero and beef meatballs with mushroom sauce and side of leek risotto. Everything was very tasty- not mind blowing but good comfort food. The prices are pretty reasonable that you can try a little of this and that from the menu and its created in way that makes ordering really simple to mix and match. It's really ingenious that you get a dry erase menu to check off your own order.They had a pretty good drink menu with some specials. I liked the blackberry lemonade that was the special of the day.We were pretty full after dinner but I couldn't leave without trying their ice cream sandwich. The have a good number of cookie and ice cream choices and once again score big in my book with the mix and match option.

"Just had dinner here for a double date with my college friend Michele W.I really like the concept of The Meatball Shop with it's old timey decor with a nod to modern design.For our table of four I think we got a little bit of everything, spicy pork w/spicy tomato sauce on hero, spicy pork on spaghetti with fried egg, beef with tomato sauce hero and beef meatballs with mushroom sauce and side of leek risotto. Everything was very tasty- not mind blowing but good comfort food. The prices are pretty reasonable that you can try a little of this and that from the menu and its created in way that makes ordering really simple to mix and match. It's really ingenious that you get a dry erase menu to check off your own order.They had a pretty good drink menu with some specials. I liked the blackberry lemonade that was the special of the day.We were pretty full after dinner but I couldn't leave without trying their ice cream sandwich. The have a good number of cookie and ice cream choices and once again score big in my book with the mix and match option. We split a sandwich with a snickerdooodle cookie on one side, chewy cocoa on the other with a really delicious scoop of espresso ice cream. I was in heaven after the first taste. That ice cream is killer and I would go back just for that.",4.0
"I was doing a bit of late night bar hopping when I came upon this place and the meatball loving cortex of my brain lit up like some synaptic 4th of July. My expectations were equal parts wearied by Williamsburg's plethora of kitschy restaurants and giddy with the possibility of a meatball Valhalla for late night bar hoppers. Suffice it to say to say that I wasn't disappointed. Great food, cozy decor, cool menu and awesome service!",5.0
"Not so great. The service rocked. So did the risotto. The meatballs the other hand...eh. I ordered the regular beef with tomato sauce, which should be a staple if you boast yourself a meatball shop. Meatballs should be either tender all around or crispy on the outside, tender the inside. These were all spice, chewy on the outside, and the sauce tasted like tomato soup. Imagine subway's meatball marinara with extra garlic. Even the bread was chewy. This place needs a NY Italian grandma. At least it was cheap.",2.0
"Maybe this place was so good because I spent the day at Comicon and hadn't eaten for more than 8-9 hours, but, regardless -- the balls hit the spot! I got the ""kitchen sink"" which came with 3 special meatballs, special sauce and a variety of yummy vegetables (beets, cucumber, etc). I don't remember exactly what was in the special meatballs but I think some kind of cheese and fennel? Not sure, but they were delicious! My husband got 4 naked balls over butternut squash risotto, which he enjoyed but he was still a little hungry (as he had Comicon'd with me much to his chagrin). And, my friend got 4 spicy pork balls on a hero. We all enjoyed and ordered ice cream sandwiches afterward -- apple cinnamon ice cream on top of ginger snap cookies. Yummy! Nobody ordered the whiskey float but I was damn curious. Give it a try and let me know how it is!Also, the atmosphere, while a little loud, is very fun. You get to fill out a menu order form with a wipe away marker and talk about balls a lot!",4.0
"Spicy pork meatballs! Delicious, dude. My friends got the veggie meatball, which I tried and had a nice nutty (almond?) taste to it, and the beef meatball, which was reported to be tasty as well. I had my meatballs on a bed of salad, which was a mix of greens, beets, and some warm roasted veggies, topped with the pesto sauce - everything was so delicious together in a tangy mix of bright freshness and umami warmth. I also got the Violet & Sage rum cocktails, which was tasty and had the perfect hint of sage.This place is a hipster mecca (obv), and you can expect a wait for tables if you stroll in for a later dinner.

"I've been excited to try the Meatball Shop since it opened, so I stopped by on a Tuesday evening for take out (dinner service was crowded). Since the hero was only $1 more than the smash I got the hero with spicy pork meatballs with the creamy parm sauce (per the recommendation of the person taking orders) with no cheese (seemed like it would be an overload) on whole wheat bread.The sandwich was pretty good and everything worked really well together, but it was not necessarily a stand out compared to other neighborhood meatball heroes. But what did stand out was the creativeness and inventiveness of the food choices. I don't know where else I could get this specific sandwich. As an added plus the side arugula sandwich was really good.Finally in terms of portion size, they gave me a generous amount of salad and I only finished half of my sandwich.

"I wasn't blown away by the food, but the i definitely enjoyed my hero and would go back any time.  We got here before 1pm on a sunday and there was no wait.  My girlfriend and i split 2 heros, one beef with tomato sauce and one spicy pork with parmesan cream.  The spicy pork hero was definitely the stand out.  It's soft and light and has a great taste, although not a lot of spice.  I thought the parmesan cream sauce was going to be much heavier, but it was nice and light, i really loved this sauce.  The beef meatball was ok, but i wouldn't get it again.  I think there are better places to get a standard meatball.  The hero bread is awesome, hard a crunchy outside and a soft inside, and they use great cheese.  For $9, the hero comes with a side salad, and is the perfect sized lunch where you aren't stuffed after.",4.0

"I've been excited to try the Meatball Shop since it opened, so I stopped by on a Tuesday evening for take out (dinner service was crowded). Since the hero was only $1 more than the smash I got the hero with spicy pork meatballs with the creamy parm sauce (per the recommendation of the person taking orders) with no cheese (seemed like it would be an overload) on whole wheat bread.The sandwich was pretty good and everything worked really well together, but it was not necessarily a stand out compared to other neighborhood meatball heroes. But what did stand out was the creativeness and inventiveness of the food choices. I don't know where else I could get this specific sandwich. As an added plus the side arugula sandwich was really good.Finally in terms of portion size, they gave me a generous amount of salad and I only finished half of my sandwich.

"One word to describe this place: delicious.We tried the naked beef meatballs and the reuben meatballs - which was the special meatball of the night.  The beef meatballs had great flavor and were great with risotto. However, the reuben meatballs really took the prize. They were corned beef, sauerkraut and caraway seeds all balled up into pure deliciousness.  On top of that was a little cold 1000 Island dressing as sauce.  I got a side of the rigatoni pasta on the side - which came covered in a fantastic red sauce.  Overall, everything  was absolutely perfect.  But, I would recommend trying the special meatball they offer on any given night - because I think it really wet above and beyond.",5.0
"People rave about how great The Meatball Shop is.  I don't really see it.I actually think the side salad that they serve with your sub is much better than the actual sandwich itself.  I have had their sandwiches on two occasions--both on a hoagie bun.  One time I had the beef with the regular sauce, the other time I tried chicken with the mushroom gravy.  Both times, I found the sauces to be overly greasy, and there is just too much bread.   It's just....too much.  The balls weren't even that flavorful, and I've had much better at some standard Italian restaurants.  I'm not saying they were bad.  I just think, if you are going to call yourself The Meatball Shop and specialize in meatballs, then you should make the best damn meatballs in town.  These were okay.  They weren't great.",3.0
"Reasons why I visit The Meatball Shop:-special naked balls (never disappoints!)-$2 glasses of blue ribbon beer (great with any dish)-the whiskey float (yes, it is amazing and I don't even like whiskey)-the cool dry erase markers and laminated menus used to place orders-the always friendly bartenders and servers-the market salad specials (the vinaigrette is light and I like the use of argula)-affordable comfort food-the neat decor especially the coat hangers in the front-create your own ice cream sandwiches",5.0
"With all the publicity this place has gotten on food network and the travel channel, I wanted to check it out. And now I completely understand why these shows featured this restaurant. IT IS NOW ONE OF MY FAVORITE PLACES TO EAT AT IN NEW YORK! Every single time I'm there, I want to come to The Meatball Shop. It's so unique, definitely one-of-a-kind! I would recommend the sliders because you can mix and match, always try something new! You can never go wrong with the risotto either! For dessert I always order the cookie ice cream sandwich, where you can mix and match 2 different homemade cookies with their homemade ice cream. My favorite is brownie cookie with vanilla ice cream. The homemade sangria is probably the best sangria I've ever had. Sangria is usually made with red wine, but in their case, they make it with rose wine. Rose is not my favorite kind of wine, but it is perfect with this sangria! Must try! This restaurant is located in Williamsburg, Brooklyn and has that artsy and laid-back atmosphere. The staff is super nice, which you don't find often in NY. I LOVE THIS PLACE!!!!!!!!!!",5.0

"From start to finish, my experience was just horrible!Theres no one to take you to your table because everyone is doing everything which obviously means they are short on staff and so they have people just standing around waiting and waiting, which one woman actually walked out because no one was paying attention to the fact that she was waiting and the cooks were the ones letting the ""waiters or servers"" know and they just brushed her off and continued to ignore her!! In front of her face!! I couldn't believe that...It was like self service, I had to go ask for a menu, go let them know I was ready to order, go let them know everything instead of waiting on us. To make things worse, they messed up my boyfriend's order and when I took it back, the guy asks me if I'm sure, what kind of question is that?? Obviously I'm sure.. WTF.They also forgot my drink which he took off the receipt which is the best thing that happened because I ordered a Sprite and it taste like crap! It wasn't Sprite, it was Seltzer water and once he brought the correct order out, he just threw it on the table and as I was telling him about the drink, he just walked off!! By that point, I was soooo done with this place and my bread was soggy and the chicken meatballs taste more like Pork Sausage......I just wrote HORRIBLE on the receipt and left.  For everyone else who enjoys this place, I'm just glad to know they didn't experience what my boyfriend and I did because I wouldn't want this to happen to anyone.If I regret anything, it would be the fact that we actually paid.",1.0

"Surprisingly not so surprising. Sat at the bar, preparing to be wowed by lusty little bits of meat nourishment and was instead meh'd by bland little bits of blandy blandness. Shared three orders of Naked Balls ($7 for four) - Mediterranean Lamb (on special) with the special sauce (I don't know what it was but it doesn't matter because it didn't taste like nuthin'), the vegetarian (which turned out to be the best of the bunch because there was actually some flavor flav) with classic tomato sauce (meh), and the classic beef with Parmesan cream (eh). I wanted them to be delightful, for serious, but they just weren't. The Freshly-Milled Polenta side ($4) was divine, however. In total 2.5 Stars (when can we do half stars already?!) - .5 for the hipster- cozy atmosphere and the tattooed bartenders, 1 for the polenta, and 1 for the mixy-matchy drinks ($9, you choose your spirit and your juice-like, fruit-like, bitter-like substance - ranges from blackberries and mint, fresh grapefruit juice and cherries, bitters and vermouth, etc. Tasty and simple). I'll probably go back again, though, primarily to see if those ice cream sandwiches warrant another star. Or just to add a fried egg on top of some naked balls because that just sounds amazing (especially for only $1 more).",2.0
"The meatballs here are delicious, but a tad on the salty side. We ordered the naked chicken meatballs with mushroom gravy and spicy pork meatballs with spicy tomato sauce, and the roasted veggies, sauteed broccoli and mashed potatoes on the side. I really loved the mushroom gravy, and the naked meatballs do come with a small slice of focaccia. I think since the meatballs were a little salty, it would have been helpful to have more bread -- the amount they give is about two fingers in width and about the same length. The sides were great! I really enjoyed that the sauteed broccoli had crushed red chili flakes for a mild kick and the cauliflower for the roasted veggies tasted slightly pickled (delicious!) and the mashed potatoes were well done too. Dessert was also great. We got the chocolate chip ice cream sandwich with espresso ice cream -- and the espresso ice cream was to die for. There were actual espresso bits in the ice cream and it was had a very strong, very dense, decadent coffee flavor. Definitely don't forgo the dessert!",4.0
"Okay, I go to this place so many times the guy who works the door at The Charleston told me he thought I worked there. Cheap, delicious cocktails, jello shots, crazy meatballs, really good sides, I usually get the daily roast veggie or the mashed potatoes. Just to give you an idea, aside from your normal beef or pork with mushroom or parm or spicy meat sauce you MUST try the chicken w pesto I get one of the sliders every time I go. Here's some of the special's I've tried turkey meatball w stuffing and cranberry sauce, DELICIOUS, Moroccan with a yogurt sauce one of my favs, buffalo was alright but im not the biggest fan of hot wings, cordon bleu sooo yumm, southeast asian amaziiinnnggg. i cant wait for the mediterranean one to be the weeks special. Oh and they sell their cookbook too, it's worth at least a peek for sure.I always sit at the bar, the bartenders are friendly and one guy suggests a new type of whiskey cocktail every time I come through. My favs  have been whiskey with pear and spices, the whiskey with violet and sage was AMAZING, the whiskey with rhubarb and iced tea was pretty good as well.Def try their dessert...ice cream and cookies made in house, both of which they have weekly specials. They are also open weekends until 4am and weekdays until 2am. Not just the bar, the kitchen too!!",5.0

They were corned beef, sauerkraut and caraway seeds all balled up into pure deliciousness.  On top of that was a little cold 1000 Island dressing as sauce.  I got a side of the rigatoni pasta on the side - which came covered in a fantastic red sauce.  Overall, everything  was absolutely perfect.  But, I would recommend trying the special meatball they offer on any given night - because I think it really wet above and beyond.",5.0
"People rave about how great The Meatball Shop is.  I don't really see it.I actually think the side salad that they serve with your sub is much better than the actual sandwich itself.  I have had their sandwiches on two occasions--both on a hoagie bun.  One time I had the beef with the regular sauce, the other time I tried chicken with the mushroom gravy.  Both times, I found the sauces to be overly greasy, and there is just too much bread.   It's just....too much.  The balls weren't even that flavorful, and I've had much better at some standard Italian restaurants.  I'm not saying they were bad.  I just think, if you are going to call yourself The Meatball Shop and specialize in meatballs, then you should make the best damn meatballs in town.  These were okay.  They weren't great.",3.0
"Reasons why I visit The Meatball Shop:-special naked balls (never disappoints!)-$2 glasses of blue ribbon beer (great with any dish)-the whiskey float (yes, it is amazing and I don't even like whiskey)-the cool dry erase markers and laminated menus used to place orders-the always friendly bartenders and servers-the market salad specials (the vinaigrette is light and I like the use of argula)-affordable comfort food-the neat decor especially the coat hangers in the front-create your own ice cream sandwiches",5.0
"With all the publicity this place has gotten on food network and the travel channel, I wanted to check it out. And now I completely understand why these shows featured this restaurant. IT IS NOW ONE OF MY FAVORITE PLACES TO EAT AT IN NEW YORK! Every single time I'm there, I want to come to The Meatball Shop. It's so unique, definitely one-of-a-kind! I would recommend the sliders because you can mix and match, always try something new! You can never go wrong with the risotto either! For dessert I always order the cookie ice cream sandwich, where you can mix and match 2 different homemade cookies with their homemade ice cream. My favorite is brownie cookie with vanilla ice cream. The homemade sangria is probably the best sangria I've ever had. Sangria is usually made with red wine, but in their case, they make it with rose wine. Rose is not my favorite kind of wine, but it is perfect with this sangria! Must try! This restaurant is located in Williamsburg, Brooklyn and has that artsy and laid-back atmosphere. The staff is super nice, which you don't find often in NY. I LOVE THIS PLACE!!!!!!!!!!",5.0
"Had a late lunch with one of the girlfriends, we were both disappointed with the food. Both of us wanted to try this spot for a long time but haven't had the chance because every time we try to get in for dinner it would be a 45 min wait! When we had it for lunch, we had REALLY high hope that it would be the greatest meatball ever... Our hope sank into a deep hole.. I really don't know what the hype is about the meatballs, but I know for sure it's not worth the wait.",2.0
"From start to finish, my experience was just horrible!Theres no one to take you to your table because everyone is doing everything which obviously means they are short on staff and so they have people just standing around waiting and waiting, which one woman actually walked out because no one was paying attention to the fact that she was waiting and the cooks were the ones letting the ""waiters or servers"" know and they just brushed her off and continued to ignore her!! In front of her face!! I couldn't believe that...It was like self service, I had to go ask for a menu, go let them know I was ready to order, go let them know everything instead of waiting on us. To make things worse, they messed up my boyfriend's order and when I took it back, the guy asks me if I'm sure, what kind of question is that?? Obviously I'm sure.. WTF.They also forgot my drink which he took off the receipt which is the best thing that happened because I ordered a Sprite and it taste like crap! It wasn't Sprite, it was Seltzer water and once he brought the correct order out, he just threw it on the table and as I was telling him about the drink, he just walked off!! By that point, I was soooo done with this place and my bread was soggy and the chicken meatballs taste more like Pork Sausage......I just wrote HORRIBLE on the receipt and left.  For everyone else who enjoys this place, I'm just glad to know they didn't experience what my boyfriend and I did because I wouldn't want this to happen to anyone.If I regret anything, it would be the fact that we actually paid.",1.0
i wish i could give this place no stars.This place had the worse customer service ever. I came in this place starving and feeling sick and i came out pissed.1. They took over 30 mins to sit me and my Gf.2. They sat us and took another 20 mins to give us our menu which my gf had to go get from them.3. They fucked up my order and had the nerve to act like they didn't.4. The sprite taste like shit.5. The food taste like shit.The staff sucks.I will never come back to this place.,1.0
"Surprisingly not so surprising. Sat at the bar, preparing to be wowed by lusty little bits of meat nourishment and was instead meh'd by bland little bits of blandy blandness. Shared three orders of Naked Balls ($7 for four) - Mediterranean Lamb (on special) with the special sauce (I don't know what it was but it doesn't matter because it didn't taste like nuthin'), the vegetarian (which turned out to be the best of the bunch because there was actually some flavor flav) with classic tomato sauce (meh), and the classic beef with Parmesan cream (eh). I wanted them to be delightful, for serious, but they just weren't. The Freshly-Milled Polenta side ($4) was divine, however. In total 2.5 Stars (when can we do half stars already?!) - .5 for the hipster- cozy atmosphere and the tattooed bartenders, 1 for the polenta, and 1 for the mixy-matchy drinks ($9, you choose your spirit and your juice-like, fruit-like, bitter-like substance - ranges from blackberries and mint, fresh grapefruit juice and cherries, bitters and vermouth, etc. Tasty and simple). I'll probably go back again, though, primarily to see if those ice cream sandwiches warrant another star. Or just to add a fried egg on top of some naked balls because that just sounds amazing (especially for only $1 more).",2.0
"The meatballs here are delicious, but a tad on the salty side. We ordered the naked chicken meatballs with mushroom gravy and spicy pork meatballs with spicy tomato sauce, and the roasted veggies, sauteed broccoli and mashed potatoes on the side. I really loved the mushroom gravy, and the naked meatballs do come with a small slice of focaccia. I think since the meatballs were a little salty, it would have been helpful to have more bread -- the amount they give is about two fingers in width and about the same length. The sides were great! I really enjoyed that the sauteed broccoli had crushed red chili flakes for a mild kick and the cauliflower for the roasted veggies tasted slightly pickled (delicious!) and the mashed potatoes were well done too. Dessert was also great. We got the chocolate chip ice cream sandwich with espresso ice cream -- and the espresso ice cream was to die for. There were actual espresso bits in the ice cream and it was had a very strong, very dense, decadent coffee flavor. Definitely don't forgo the dessert!",4.0
"Okay, I go to this place so many times the guy who works the door at The Charleston told me he thought I worked there. Cheap, delicious cocktails, jello shots, crazy meatballs, really good sides, I usually get the daily roast veggie or the mashed potatoes. Just to give you an idea, aside from your normal beef or pork with mushroom or parm or spicy meat sauce you MUST try the chicken w pesto I get one of the sliders every time I go. Here's some of the special's I've tried turkey meatball w stuffing and cranberry sauce, DELICIOUS, Moroccan with a yogurt sauce one of my favs, buffalo was alright but im not the biggest fan of hot wings, cordon bleu sooo yumm, southeast asian amaziiinnnggg. i cant wait for the mediterranean one to be the weeks special. Oh and they sell their cookbook too, it's worth at least a peek for sure.I always sit at the bar, the bartenders are friendly and one guy suggests a new type of whiskey cocktail every time I come through. My favs  have been whiskey with pear and spices, the whiskey with violet and sage was AMAZING, the whiskey with rhubarb and iced tea was pretty good as well.Def try their dessert...ice cream and cookies made in house, both of which they have weekly specials. They are also open weekends until 4am and weekdays until 2am. Not just the bar, the kitchen too!!",5.0
"I literally found myself going here 5 times a week, usually late at night. Wasn't always there for a full meal, but everything from the sides to salad to drinks to ice cream sandwiches were top notch. I'd recommend the smash, with beef--the beef is my favorite of all the meatballs that I've tried, but I never seem to be there on days with specials that intrigue me. It's the perfect amount of food, and comes with a nice salad on the side to make you forget that what you're eating is pretty unhealthy. For drinks, the fool aid punch is fantastic--grape kool ade!--and the ice cream sandwiches are a must. The ice cream is unbelievably fresh and almost light, and the brownie cookies are delicious. I didn't love some of the other cookies that I tried (too hard in texture, though I understand that they need some sturdiness to hold the sandwich together).Yeah, the wait is obnoxiously long during peak hours. It's New York, it happens. Go at an off-time, you won't be sorry.",5.0

One of the favorite things I've gotten here.I've definitely hit the original location in the LES many a time, but I really like this Williamsburg location. Decor is similar, but there are two bars at this one, which is really nice.Bottom line -- you need to go here.",5.0

"With five other people in tow, I needed a place to eat in Williamsburg that lacked pretension, was affordable, pleased both vegetarians and meat eaters, and most of all, accommodating to six people on a Saturday evening. Meatball Shop fulfilled all of these needs.The service was fantastic. Everyone form the hostesses to the bar staff to the waitresses were extremely helpful and incredibly friendly. I knew fitting six people into any restaurant on a Saturday evening was a bit of a risk, especially one on Bedford Ave, but i arrived a little early, put my name in, and settled into the bar for a delicious Blackberry, mint, and gin cocktail.  (They have a list where you pick the base and then pick the type of liquor you want in your drink. Genius. Also seen on the menu, for those who enjoy floats: A whiskey float with ice cream and Abita Rootbeer.) The hostesses even seated our party while two people were MIA and added a table after they arrived. This is unheard of. And amazing.The food was great. All the menus at the Meatball Shop consist of laminated paper in which you use a dry erase marker to mark down what you want to eat. The concept is fun, especially when you realize you can use said dry erase marker to write immature plays-on-words like ""balls"" on other people's drinking glasses. Anyways, a friend and I shared the veggie balls with the red sauce, the veggie balls with pesto, a daily market salad (that included almonds, peaches, and arugala), and the daily roast vegetable (a garden fresh ratatouille). Everything was great and extremely fresh. Our friends ordered pork balls, beef balls, and pasta and everyone seemed extremely impressed with their choices.

The first thing you have to realize about this place is that it is loud. Secondly, you get to use petri dish pencils as you mark off what you want. I believe the staple of the Meatball shop would be the Spicy Pork balls. They had just enough heat, combine that with the Spicy Meat sauce and you've got quite a combination.

"(Why the 2 star rating?  Skip to the 4th paragraph)I visited The Meatball Shop for lunch on a whim because my friend and I were checking out furniture and antique stores in Williamsburg.  We walked in and were immediately greeted by a friendly hostess.  The layout of the restaurant is very appealing.  It's designed to look like a hybrid between a tavern and diner.  It's clean and the lighting is both warm and inviting.  The hostess explained that they were about to have a staff meeting, but we were welcome to have a seat.We both took a seat at the bar counter.  While we waited, I watched the staff interact with each other and I really got the feeling that everyone was very close, like a family.  And despite some of the anti-hipster sentiment by some of the reviewers, it was a cool window into the lives of people who live a different lifestyle than myself.  Who am I to judge how other people enjoy their lives?  But I digress.I originally ordered the ""Special Meatball"" of the day which was Mediterranean Lamb, but apparently the board featuring the day's specials was incorrect (not very professional and a bit annoying) so I ordered the spicy pork meatball sandwich with mushroom sauce and provolone on whole wheat which came with a side salad for $9.  Being from an Italian family, I have to say that the meatballs were pretty good.  Not my favorite, but very tasty.  The spicy pork wasn't really spicy.  However, the meat, cheese and sauce blended well together and the bread tasted fresh.  The side salad was also crisp and fresh with greens, apples, and (I think) olive oil for dressing. Everything was going well, until my friend began having an allergic reaction.  He is allergic to nuts and he wasn't sure if he was just being paranoid at first.  So he asked the bartender if the salad had any nuts in it.  She said no, then realized that the Veggie Meatballs were made with Walnuts.  My friend understandably became agitated upon realizing what had happened.  As we searched for answers, I looked at the menu and at the very bottom in fine print read something along the lines of, ""Allergies? Ask your server.""  The bartender then began defending the restaurant and essentially blaming my friend for not taking the proper precautions by asking her if his meal contained nuts.  Not angrily, mind you, but she was seemingly unwilling to hear out my friend who had to duck out to pick up some medicine from the pharmacy around the corner.  Here's the problem with her argument:1)  No one would reasonably expect a meatball, even a veggie meatball, to contain nuts.  If it was something like pesto, then, yea, you would ask because most people make it with pine nuts.2)  I've worked in restaurants and have a degree in Hospitality.  In the realm of customer service, the onus falls on the establishment to inform the guest of a potential health hazard, such as the existence of nuts in a meatball.  Some restaurants even make it a point of service to ask every table if anyone has allergies that they should be aware of.  Compared with that, having an allergy question written in fine print at the bottom of the menu seems lazy.3)  The menu was poorly labeled.  One would think that for safety's sake the establishment would do everything within its power to protect the guest and cover their own ass by simply adding ""Contains Walnuts"" next to the Veggie Meatball on the menu.  The owners could have had a lawsuit on their hands had the situation turned deadly.On top of this, when my friend asked to speak to the manager (not to berate him, but simple to provide feedback so as to avoid this potentially deadly situation in the future) she acknowledged his request, but proceeded to finish her cleaning duties instead of going to get the manager.  It was only after his second request that she abandoned her side work to fetch the manager.  I couldn't really hear his conversation with the manger, but it didn't seem like he got it either.In conclusion, the food was pretty good, but unfortunately the service and complete lack of understanding regarding the severity of the situation was a bit shocking.  People make mistakes.  It's how you go about redeeming the mistake that's important.  I hope the owners consider providing the staff with some customer service training and that they label the menu properly.",2.0

"When I saw that Meatball Shop was moving to Brooklyn, I was very excited.  What can be better?  Excellent meatballs, fun atmosphere, and really easy to get to (not that the one in the LES wasn't easy to get to but I don't spend a lot of time in downtown Manhattan...).My beau and I found ourselves here on a Monday afternoon ready for lunch.  There was a lot of seating available (dead time for dining out) but I could see how uncomfortable it can get if it gets packed.  There are antique photos of Italian families and vintage meat grinders hanging on the walls; it has a very rustic/intimate feeling about it.  It kinda feels like you're sitting in a country kitchen of sorts with all of that natural lighting and unfrosted incandescent lighting.The service was great.  We sat at the bar and our bartender not only had an extensive knowledge of the alcohol he was serving but was patient with us (first-timers to the menu).  I ordered the Smash with chicken balls, mushroom sauce, and mozzarella cheese.  I couldn't have been happier with my selection!  The balls were perfectly crafted; not dry or too moist.  The sauce?  It was a mushroom lover's delight.  My beau ordered Naked Balls, they were plain ground beef served with the spicy meat sauce.  It's just like your grandma made... if your grandma was Italian and her hands made meatballs every Sunday for dinner.We will be back... it's just a matter of how soon!",4.0
"I went to New York with my girlfriend to visit my uncle but being my fourth time to New York, I had already run the gamut of typical touristy attractions and just went out into the city to explore with a friend who lived in Brooklyn. The greatest treasure we found was the Meatball Shop in Williamsburg. This place is a cute little shop where you order meatball sandwiches on a laminated menu with a dry erase marker. THAT IS SO QUAINT! To me this is the quintessential New York restaurant because the level of specializations (they specialize in MEATBALLS) is so exact, but that niche is so well executed that the shop is able to thrive. There are daily specials from seasonal greens, but there are also stalwart options like a traditional meatball.",5.0
"Delicious food and what a great atmosphere!  I've been to a few of The Meatball Shop locations and Brooklyn, by far, is the best.  Laid back atmosphere, best meatballs ever, great service, excellent wine selections along with great beer (even $2 PBR is on tap!!) and fun music. I love how you can hear the music and easily maintain a conversation, which makes for a fun dinner!!  My husband and I sat at the bar and the bartender was always ready to pour us another round and the food came out quick.  Their spaghetti is under-rated, as it's one of my favorites and the risotto is always excellent and has a unique twist.  The wait can be a little long, but there are many bars around the corner to visit while you wait and I recommend chillin at the bar for some excellent chianti so we don't mind the wait at all.This place is perfect for a romantic dinner and I'd imagine it being a hipster's dream ($2 PBR and a cheap dinner for a GREAT value!!) and it's a fun place to go with friends and quite interactive.  You can sit in front of the cooks and watch them cook which is pretty cool.  And TMS stays open until 4am....even though I'm not a night owl, I imagine this being the BEST drunk late night snack ever and a great place to wind the night down.The best part was our bill - we had 2 large meals, a few drinks each, and took some meatballs and spaghetti home....total bill for 2 = $65. NOT bad at all!Our Valentine's Day dinner was ruined at another restaurant in Astoria and my husband and I wish we would've come to The Meatball Shop instead!!We'll probably be back this weekend again!",5.0

"I would give this place 4 stars because I like idea, but there are just a few things that were bothering me.Walked in and was handed some menus without even being explained what to do with the marker and menu. Our waitress then asked us if we wanted anything to drink, but all I wanted was water and I can feel her energy like she was pissed that I wasn't ordering more.Not my cup of tea.Anyways,  the concept was nice where you literally can create your meatball sub and choose what you want in it without being bombarded with too many options.I tried the classic beef balls (hehe) with the spicy meat sauce with mozzarella. It was alright. Came with a little side salad that was uninspired. Pretty average.Grade: B-",3.0

"Always heard about TMS from a friend, but finally the opportunity arose when my girl suggested we go before hitting up her friend's Bday event. The wait was about a half an hour, so I grabbed myself a Three Philosopher from the bodega across the street and brown bagged it around the corner (I'm from the Bronx, this is what I do). Eventually received the text that our table was ready, so we made our way back. First we ordered our drinks, my girl got the IPA, and me the stout. Unfortunately, they were out of the infamous Sixpoint Wheatball, which is brewed specifically for TMS. My girl, being a vegetarian, ordered 3 vegetarian meatball sliders. I got the beef meatballs, in spicy sauce, over rigatoni, and under the fried egg. Safe to say, the food was very good. Our waitress was very nice and attentive, and we ended our experience with a whiskey float, two straws. Had an awesome time..",4.0
"I must say I was more in love with the place than I was with the food.  It's so charming!  The 6 of us ordered a variety of food.  I wasn't that impressed with the flavors; ie. risotto was bland & not creamy, pasta with tomato sauce was cooked al dente but the taste was just okay & the greek meatballs were watery.  However, the spicy pork meatballs were great!  In fact, I received a recipe at the end of the meal that I hope to replicate.  I'm currently in love with macaroons so seeing that on the menu was a plus for me.  I didn't think they could make a macaroon into a ice-cream sandwich, but they did and it was tasty though the espresso ice-cream was more like sweet coffee than espresso. (not a fan)  Overall I wasn't impressed but it's still a fun place to check out.  We were lucky and didn't have to wait but I can imagine being really frustrated had we needed to wait for a table.",3.0
I came with a friend who's really picky with her food so you can only imagine her enlightement when she noticed that she can check off exactly what she wants. The sliders were pretty tasty but a bit pricey. The cookie ice cream sandwhich was nice but not anything I would kill for. The waitress was super helpful and patient. Overall it was a good/fun experience. I think it would taste considerably better if I came drunk at 2 am.,4.0

"When I saw that Meatball Shop was moving to Brooklyn, I was very excited.  What can be better?  Excellent meatballs, fun atmosphere, and really easy to get to (not that the one in the LES wasn't easy to get to but I don't spend a lot of time in downtown Manhattan...).My beau and I found ourselves here on a Monday afternoon ready for lunch.  There was a lot of seating available (dead time for dining out) but I could see how uncomfortable it can get if it gets packed.  There are antique photos of Italian families and vintage meat grinders hanging on the walls; it has a very rustic/intimate feeling about it.  It kinda feels like you're sitting in a country kitchen of sorts with all of that natural lighting and unfrosted incandescent lighting.The service was great.  We sat at the bar and our bartender not only had an extensive knowledge of the alcohol he was serving but was patient with us (first-timers to the menu).  I ordered the Smash with chicken balls, mushroom sauce, and mozzarella cheese.  I couldn't have been happier with my selection!  The balls were perfectly crafted; not dry or too moist.  The sauce?  It was a mushroom lover's delight.  My beau ordered Naked Balls, they were plain ground beef served with the spicy meat sauce.  It's just like your grandma made... if your grandma was Italian and her hands made meatballs every Sunday for dinner.We will be back... it's just a matter of how soon!",4.0
"I went to New York with my girlfriend to visit my uncle but being my fourth time to New York, I had already run the gamut of typical touristy attractions and just went out into the city to explore with a friend who lived in Brooklyn. The greatest treasure we found was the Meatball Shop in Williamsburg. This place is a cute little shop where you order meatball sandwiches on a laminated menu with a dry erase marker. THAT IS SO QUAINT! To me this is the quintessential New York restaurant because the level of specializations (they specialize in MEATBALLS) is so exact, but that niche is so well executed that the shop is able to thrive. There are daily specials from seasonal greens, but there are also stalwart options like a traditional meatball.",5.0

I got the regular beef with spicy sauce my wife got the special lamb and pork meatballs in a pesto sauce with mash potatoes let  me start off and say  the servers were very good and friendly the place it self the chairs hard and not comfortable well in two words the meatballs sucked my wife's lamb meatballs had very little lamb and the pesto sauce was drowning in in oil she hated it my Italian style meatballs were tough not tender over mixed or needed more egg or breadcrumbs in it the pasta was not bad the spicy sauce not bad but nothing special she turn to me and said your meatballs and Sunday Gravy is 1000 times better all hype but the hipsters never growing up with the real thing seem to like it its a nice place for drinks and to hang out but the food if your Italian your not going to like it",1.0
"Passing by the Meatball Shop on Williamsburg's Bedford Ave you can feel the happening-ness pulsing out through the restaurants winter vestibule.  Standing just inside, your attention is steeped in the crackling and simmering that is the pleasant discord of an impromptu orchestra of laughter and conversation, warm colors and flickering shadows, enchanting smells and viral smiles.  Good vibrations abound.  As you close your eyes and focus on exactly what it is that is happening here, you can almost imagine that you are in the bellows of some great beast.  The Meatball Shop exhales the exhaust of spent conversation and satisfied patrons into the streets of Williamsburg, now rejuvenated and quenched by the emulsion of sauteed, ground flesh and camaraderie.   As the door swings shut and then inward the crisp, cold, clean slate of winter ether and the hungry spirits of Bedford Ave are sucked into the deep as The Meatball Shop draws a breath.  Whether by intent or by chance, a few blessed souls are caught up in the inhalation into this beating furnace to be transfixed and replenished. The life blood of culture infuses the talent of the chefs in the open kitchen behind the dining bar and the genuine attitudes of the waitstaff as it does the meatball-based platters, sandwiches, sides and to-die-for ice cream sandwiches which are prepared therein.  In the melee of food and sounds and sights and ideas the banter and the minds of the staff and patrons and air and thoughts mix and spill over again and again and again ad infinitum.   A common thing is being thought behind the facade of individuality and is churned into existence in the freely flowing interactions in The Meatball Shop.  As food and thoughts and smiles and greetings and meetings and dollars and cents and touches and glances and numbers and songs and perceptions and memories and hopes and dreams are exchanged, the question must be begged... Who here is the patron and who is in service?  Who came to meet whom?  Who is dining with whom and who is not?  Who is giving and who is receiving in this exchange of money and attention, food and thought, meatball and companionship... this strange mix of salads and salutations that we call a restaurant?The Meatball Shop on Williamsburg's Bedford Ave gets 5 stars in my book for serving delicious food in a stylish and hip setting and for being much more than just a place where food is prepared and exchanged for currency... for being one of the many beating hearts of life and culture that makes ""the hip scene"" in Brooklyn one that continues to draw the attention of the entire world.",5.0
"All Meatballs. Completely customizable menu. You can pair anything from beef, pork, and vegetable meatballs with your choice of sauces; classic tomato, parmesan cream pesto, and mushroom gravy. All amazing. I must say ordering the meatballs in slider form is definitely the way to go. The entire drink menu can be personalized, too. You choose you spirit: whiskey, gin or vodka and flavors like blackberry and Mint, bitters and vermouth, or lavender honey and thyme. Keeping with the mix-n-match theme the desserts are pretty awesome as well, ice cream sandwiches and floats, you pick your cookie, ice cream, and soda. If you're not stopping in with a larger group, I would recommend sitting at the counter, they have an open kitchen and you can watch your food being prepared, which is always entertaining.",4.0

I remember when this place first opened, and the service was much, much better. The wait time for food is hit or miss. I would recommend going to the LES location.",2.0

"Went to the one on 9thave when I was in the city last week saw the story about theses guys who started this place they now have 5 places in NYC being Italian American and having eaten and also made very good meatballs but only Italian style I said lets try it, was with my wife. I got the regular beef with spicy sauce my wife got the special lamb and pork meatballs in a pesto sauce with mash potatoes let  me start off and say  the servers were very good and friendly the place it self the chairs hard and not comfortable well in two words the meatballs sucked my wife's lamb meatballs had very little lamb and the pesto sauce was drowning in in oil she hated it my Italian style meatballs were tough not tender over mixed or needed more egg or breadcrumbs in it the pasta was not bad the spicy sauce not bad but nothing special she turn to me and said your meatballs and Sunday Gravy is 1000 times better all hype but the hipsters never growing up with the real thing seem to like it its a nice place for drinks and to hang out but the food if your Italian your not going to like it",1.0
"Passing by the Meatball Shop on Williamsburg's Bedford Ave you can feel the happening-ness pulsing out through the restaurants winter vestibule.  Standing just inside, your attention is steeped in the crackling and simmering that is the pleasant discord of an impromptu orchestra of laughter and conversation, warm colors and flickering shadows, enchanting smells and viral smiles.  Good vibrations abound.  As you close your eyes and focus on exactly what it is that is happening here, you can almost imagine that you are in the bellows of some great beast.  The Meatball Shop exhales the exhaust of spent conversation and satisfied patrons into the streets of Williamsburg, now rejuvenated and quenched by the emulsion of sauteed, ground flesh and camaraderie.   As the door swings shut and then inward the crisp, cold, clean slate of winter ether and the hungry spirits of Bedford Ave are sucked into the deep as The Meatball Shop draws a breath.  Whether by intent or by chance, a few blessed souls are caught up in the inhalation into this beating furnace to be transfixed and replenished. The life blood of culture infuses the talent of the chefs in the open kitchen behind the dining bar and the genuine attitudes of the waitstaff as it does the meatball-based platters, sandwiches, sides and to-die-for ice cream sandwiches which are prepared therein.  In the melee of food and sounds and sights and ideas the banter and the minds of the staff and patrons and air and thoughts mix and spill over again and again and again ad infinitum.   A common thing is being thought behind the facade of individuality and is churned into existence in the freely flowing interactions in The Meatball Shop.  As food and thoughts and smiles and greetings and meetings and dollars and cents and touches and glances and numbers and songs and perceptions and memories and hopes and dreams are exchanged, the question must be begged... Who here is the patron and who is in service?  Who came to meet whom?  Who is dining with whom and who is not?  Who is giving and who is receiving in this exchange of money and attention, food and thought, meatball and companionship... this strange mix of salads and salutations that we call a restaurant?The Meatball Shop on Williamsburg's Bedford Ave gets 5 stars in my book for serving delicious food in a stylish and hip setting and for being much more than just a place where food is prepared and exchanged for currency... for being one of the many beating hearts of life and culture that makes ""the hip scene"" in Brooklyn one that continues to draw the attention of the entire world.",5.0
"All Meatballs. Completely customizable menu. You can pair anything from beef, pork, and vegetable meatballs with your choice of sauces; classic tomato, parmesan cream pesto, and mushroom gravy. All amazing. I must say ordering the meatballs in slider form is definitely the way to go. The entire drink menu can be personalized, too. You choose you spirit: whiskey, gin or vodka and flavors like blackberry and Mint, bitters and vermouth, or lavender honey and thyme. Keeping with the mix-n-match theme the desserts are pretty awesome as well, ice cream sandwiches and floats, you pick your cookie, ice cream, and soda. If you're not stopping in with a larger group, I would recommend sitting at the counter, they have an open kitchen and you can watch your food being prepared, which is always entertaining.",4.0
"I've been wanting to go to the location in the city but randomly stumbled upon the brooklyn store while looking for a place to get more drinks and food.The store was pretty big and clean (i love their long tables) and they even have an interesting selection of drinks. I have to say that the meatball sliders were good but nothing out of this world. The ice cream sandwiches were really good though, it was everything I expected..soft cookie and delicious ice cream.I would go back to try other things on the menu and to have the jelly shots and that alcohol purple cool aid drink again haha.

"Excellent food, great prices, open late, fast service, but loud.I love the meatball shop because I know I can get something quick, reasonably healthy, at almost any hour of the day.  I especially love their ice cream sandwiches!  You can pick your cookie and your ice cream for a custom dessert...yum!  The only thing that I will say is that it is loud - especially if you sit at one of the high tables in the front where the speaker is mounted right next to your ear.  Because they keep the music fairly loud, I wouldn't recommend it for a date where you want to talk and take your time.  If you are looking for a quick and amazing bite and don't mind yelling, go for it.",4.0

"I'm moving away from NYC in a week, and I have to say, from the bottom of my heart, I am going to miss the Meatball Shop!

My favorite dish was the espresso ice cream sandwich on brownie cookies- easily the best espresso ice cream I've ever tasted- I couldn't stop eating it! And the brownie cookie complemented it so well, being so chocolatey and generously filled with walnuts. I wish the buffalo chicken special was permanent! It was INSANE. It had the perfect kick, and the blue cheese sauce was sinful. The veggie ball filled me up and left me so satisfied I didn't miss eating meat.

I was SO disappointed.  I ordered the spicy pork meatballs with spicy sauce on the server's recommendation, had them over the white beans with steamed spinach on the side & my friends had the beef with spicy sauce.The meatballs were TOUGH and the sauce was so over salted. The white beans were under cooked and the spinach was also over salted.  I couldn't eat more than one meatball out of the 4 that were served. When the server came by to pick up my full plate at the end of the meal and asked how it was, I replied ""the meatballs were tough and the sauce and veg was over salted"".  Her response was ""oh, would you like dessert?"".   No, I would NOT.   I cannot recommend this place.  Great Concept,  Lousy Execution.",1.0

This plate consists of multiple cold side salads, topped with meatballs and sauce. My one wish would be that in the winter, that they would switch out some of the cold sides for a couple warm ones. Usually, I find myself pleased with all but one of the dishes, which is perfectly fine with me, its a ton of food. PS it is important that you do not order this if you aren't in the mood for cold food, if you don't love veggies, if you don't like your food touching, or if you don't like having a complete surprise for a meal. Enjoy! :)",4.0
"Not fantastic at all.Got dragged here by friends after the buzz about it, and I don't understand it. Mediocre food, ultra tiny portions (no, really, really tiny - like six bites of food, maybe), and average price. Really noisy. Uncomfortably noisy.It's packed though, so someone's liking it.",2.0
"This place is really over rated. The food isn't as good as people say. The meatballs are small and average tasting. The sides have a lot to be desired, and when I say that, I mean bland. And for a flat $5/per side is way too expensive. So you pay a premium for the environment? Which brings me to the service : poor. I've given this place a shot a few times. Never again.",2.0

"Went with friends for my birthday on 1/7/13. Had very high expectations after everything I'd heard. I was SO disappointed.  I ordered the spicy pork meatballs with spicy sauce on the server's recommendation, had them over the white beans with steamed spinach on the side & my friends had the beef with spicy sauce.The meatballs were TOUGH and the sauce was so over salted. The white beans were under cooked and the spinach was also over salted.  I couldn't eat more than one meatball out of the 4 that were served. When the server came by to pick up my full plate at the end of the meal and asked how it was, I replied ""the meatballs were tough and the sauce and veg was over salted"".  Her response was ""oh, would you like dessert?"".   No, I would NOT.   I cannot recommend this place.  Great Concept,  Lousy Execution.",1.0
"Meatballs are generally pretty good, and this place is no exception.  The Meatball Shop was one of the highlights of my visit of NY.  FOODI ordered the spicy pork with meat sauce in the brioche.  It was a little difficult to eat as a sandwich as the bread was a little soft, but good nonetheless.  The meatball itself was great, nice and moist with good flavor.  The prices are more than reasonable for what you get.  SERVICENo complaints here.  Everyone was nice. HIPSTERSAll over the place.  Not sure why that's a problem, though.  There's something wrong with you if you're turned off by an establishment because of what other patrons are wearing.  Pay attention to your food and the person/people you came with.  Try that.",4.0
"The worst ever.  Who puts eggs on a meatball?  I have to admit I am a bit biased because I have an Italian mother who knows how to make the real thing, but because I know what the real thing is supposed to be like does not excuse this sad, pathetic imitation.  Also...I found the double-entendre laden menu to be as disgusting as the actual meatballs.  My girlfriend at the time was smart enough to only order a soda.  The only explanation that I could possibly think of for people's general approval of this restaurant is the general level of cluelessness of people in this neighborhood...and the general mediocrity of most restaurants in this neighborhood.",1.0

"I must say that this place is a terrible example of what williamsburg has to offer in terms of great food.               I came here about a week ago with a friend around midnight as it was the only sit down place open that wasn't Anna Maria or Oasis. Not knowing barely anything about the manhattan location, We sat down and were given our menus where we were told to check off what we wanted with a dry erase marker? CLASSY. But upon seeing the oh so clever genital puns all over the menu I shouldn't have expected that to be a characteristic of the restaurant in the first place. So I ordered the white beans, the roasted veggies to share and the special of the night which was a bolognese meatball in classic red sauce. My friend ordered the classic meatballs with mushroom gravy and the risotto.             The whitebeans were tasteless and just doused with bread crumbs making it seem as though I were eating sawdust. The risotto was so forgettable I barely even remember eating it. But truthfully the roasted veggies were close to being good; onions, fennel and celery a great combination but the celery was way too salty because it is naturally alot salitier than onion and fennel so as a result  the seasoning was uneven. The bolognese meatballs were tasteless and the texture was that of my old highschools meatballs they served us for lunch, really smushy and unpleasant mouth feel. The beef meatballs'  mushroom gravy was the only saving grace. (unfortunatly i didn't order it). Also the decor and ambience made no sense, old photographs with rap music playing and you're typical too-cool for school pretentious hipsters talking about what they bought at beacons closet the day before.                 I'm sure the owners of this place don't give a fuck about this review considering how much money they're pulling in from these restaurants but i still think i needed to let some people know what i think.

"Yum.I had been dying to try this place out for months. I finally dropped in this afternoon and it was really good.You have a choice of pork, beef, chicken or vegetable meatballs. They're regular sized meatballs. You get to choose what type of sauce you'd like on them too. Options included cream sauce, mushroom gravy, tomato sauce, pesto and a spicy meat sauce.You can't mix the types of meatballs you order unless you order sliders. The other options include meatballs and sauce over of your choice of a side, in a hero, with a salad or mashed up and put on a bun sloppy joe style.I had the chicken meatballs (there are four to an order)with pesto sauce and their house salad and split it. This was more than enough food to keep me full for hours. The meatballs were amazing. I wasn't sure about ordering chicken, because I was afraid they would be dry, but these were sooooooo goodddddd. They weren't dry and they were really flavorful. The pesto sauce was also perfect and fresh and there was lots of it. There was parmesan cheese sprinkled on top. The salad was decent, but I would return just for the meatballs!!!!The only drawbacks were the volume of the music, which alternated between fairly heavy rock and hip hop, but it was all so loud that we had to shout, which isn't normally the type of atmosphere I'm into for lunch on Saturday afternoon. It was also a bit at odds with the decor: sun streaming in from a big skylight and Ball jars full of sunflowers on the table. I'm not saying I need to eat in a library, but bringing the volume down several notches would make the experience a lot more enjoyable.The waitstaff were attentive and maybe stretched a little thin. They were very friendly though and our waiter explained the menu at length whenhe asked us if we'd been there before and we said no. He had a lot of tables though and our iced tea got lost in the shuffle.All in all, I really like this place. Next time, I will somehow save room for dessert, because the homemade ice cream sandwiches the tablenext to us ordered looked amazing!",4.0
"This place was unbelievably greatJaclyn was our server and she was great. All three of us commented on how warm and cool and helpful she was before we even placed our orders, after a minor beets related brouhaha, we became converts for life! After informing us that it was no problem to ask that beets not be included in the ""kitchen sink"" vegetable medley and insuring that she had placed the order that way, beets did turn up on the side of the plate, which was not a big issue. Not only did Jaclyn notice, she had the manager send over some free goodies and apologize profusely. Completely unnecessary but SO appreciated and awesome of her. Also the hostess was great and the ""give us your cell phone number"" system was highly appreciated and convenient. The food itself was amazing. There was a beef smash with tomato sauce and mozeralla cheese, a chicken and parmesean cream sauce with a side of spinach and a veggie kitchen sink with parmesean. Everyone was incredibly pleased, so much so that we decided to go ahead and order some dessert, which is something we almost never do, but the ice cream sandwiches (wow) and whiskey floats (woww) were definitely worth it!The drinks would have been the highlight had the food not been so good! From the choose your own concoctions to the Fool Aid and the Jello Shot of the day, everyone left dinner with a solid buzz and extremely impressed and pleasantly surprised. Overall I would reccomend The Meatball Shop to anyone looking for an awesome meal in a very warm and welcoming environment, and all three of us are looking forward to going back soon!",5.0
"I have to begin by stating that since the owners graduated my high school (LA GUARDIA ARTS!) I will be extremely biased in my opinion. That aside..I love you meatball shop!If I could marry a restaurant on Bedford ave, this would be it! The decor is funky and charming. The bar is busy but at a nice distance from those of us wanting to eat and not mingle with the 'Billyburgians who are busy having their happy hour cocktails.The menu itself is a novel idea! Marker and pad allows you to costum create the meatball and spaghetti or bread or *gulp* salad match!I had the salad with spicy pork meatballs and pesto sauce. HUUUUGE portion, but the greens were *gasp* GREEN. This is rare for anything that costs under 10 bucks in williamsburg. The meatballs were tender and the dressing wasn't overwhelming. The veggies were fresh and I was in heaven.No cons, everything here is amazing. I'm glad the boys finally made the move from Manhattan over the bridge to Brooklyn. Meatball shop, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful relationship.",5.0
"Great late night stop for a drink and a bite.  Went straight to the bar, as the place was packed and fortunate enough to find a bar seats right away.  Ordered some kind of whiskey float and a meatball sandwich (beef, mozzarella and classic tomato sauce).  Was pleased with both my food and my drink.  No complaints here.",4.0
"Two things I try to avoid, hipsters and buying meatballs.  I grew up with an Italian father, made sauce (or gravy if you prefer) every Sunday, and I would never ever ever try another meatball other then his own.  So when I heard of this here ""Meatball shop"" and the raving reviews I thought maybe I might, but in Williamsburgh, Bedford Ave the ""Fifth Avenue"" of Hipster Central oof that would be tough.  I swallowed my pride but saved enough room for some most delicious food.  The owners spent a long time in planning out the menu and the decor, both are great. Meatballs and their many different flavors, so many my head began to spin.  I've been here twice now and the last time I went solo, sat at the bar and was greeted by a very nice bartender, long black hair, tattoos.  She didn't have to sell be too much when she described with love her opinion of the days special meatball, steak, bacon & cheddar.  Had me a pint of Brooklyn Brownstone, kicked back and enjoyed a most delicious meatball sandwich one of which my dad would have approved of.",4.0

Options included cream sauce, mushroom gravy, tomato sauce, pesto and a spicy meat sauce.You can't mix the types of meatballs you order unless you order sliders. The other options include meatballs and sauce over of your choice of a side, in a hero, with a salad or mashed up and put on a bun sloppy joe style.I had the chicken meatballs (there are four to an order)with pesto sauce and their house salad and split it. This was more than enough food to keep me full for hours. The meatballs were amazing. I wasn't sure about ordering chicken, because I was afraid they would be dry, but these were sooooooo goodddddd. They weren't dry and they were really flavorful. The pesto sauce was also perfect and fresh and there was lots of it. There was parmesan cheese sprinkled on top. The salad was decent, but I would return just for the meatballs!!!!The only drawbacks were the volume of the music, which alternated between fairly heavy rock and hip hop, but it was all so loud that we had to shout, which isn't normally the type of atmosphere I'm into for lunch on Saturday afternoon. It was also a bit at odds with the decor: sun streaming in from a big skylight and Ball jars full of sunflowers on the table. I'm not saying I need to eat in a library, but bringing the volume down several notches would make the experience a lot more enjoyable.The waitstaff were attentive and maybe stretched a little thin. They were very friendly though and our waiter explained the menu at length whenhe asked us if we'd been there before and we said no. He had a lot of tables though and our iced tea got lost in the shuffle.All in all, I really like this place. Next time, I will somehow save room for dessert, because the homemade ice cream sandwiches the tablenext to us ordered looked amazing!",4.0
"This place was unbelievably greatJaclyn was our server and she was great. All three of us commented on how warm and cool and helpful she was before we even placed our orders, after a minor beets related brouhaha, we became converts for life! After informing us that it was no problem to ask that beets not be included in the ""kitchen sink"" vegetable medley and insuring that she had placed the order that way, beets did turn up on the side of the plate, which was not a big issue. Not only did Jaclyn notice, she had the manager send over some free goodies and apologize profusely. Completely unnecessary but SO appreciated and awesome of her. Also the hostess was great and the ""give us your cell phone number"" system was highly appreciated and convenient. The food itself was amazing. There was a beef smash with tomato sauce and mozeralla cheese, a chicken and parmesean cream sauce with a side of spinach and a veggie kitchen sink with parmesean. Everyone was incredibly pleased, so much so that we decided to go ahead and order some dessert, which is something we almost never do, but the ice cream sandwiches (wow) and whiskey floats (woww) were definitely worth it!The drinks would have been the highlight had the food not been so good! From the choose your own concoctions to the Fool Aid and the Jello Shot of the day, everyone left dinner with a solid buzz and extremely impressed and pleasantly surprised. Overall I would reccomend The Meatball Shop to anyone looking for an awesome meal in a very warm and welcoming environment, and all three of us are looking forward to going back soon!",5.0
"I have to begin by stating that since the owners graduated my high school (LA GUARDIA ARTS!) I will be extremely biased in my opinion. That aside..I love you meatball shop!If I could marry a restaurant on Bedford ave, this would be it! The decor is funky and charming. The bar is busy but at a nice distance from those of us wanting to eat and not mingle with the 'Billyburgians who are busy having their happy hour cocktails.The menu itself is a novel idea! Marker and pad allows you to costum create the meatball and spaghetti or bread or *gulp* salad match!I had the salad with spicy pork meatballs and pesto sauce. HUUUUGE portion, but the greens were *gasp* GREEN. This is rare for anything that costs under 10 bucks in williamsburg. The meatballs were tender and the dressing wasn't overwhelming. The veggies were fresh and I was in heaven.No cons, everything here is amazing. I'm glad the boys finally made the move from Manhattan over the bridge to Brooklyn. Meatball shop, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful relationship.",5.0
"Great late night stop for a drink and a bite.  Went straight to the bar, as the place was packed and fortunate enough to find a bar seats right away.  Ordered some kind of whiskey float and a meatball sandwich (beef, mozzarella and classic tomato sauce).  Was pleased with both my food and my drink.  No complaints here.",4.0
"Two things I try to avoid, hipsters and buying meatballs.  I grew up with an Italian father, made sauce (or gravy if you prefer) every Sunday, and I would never ever ever try another meatball other then his own.  So when I heard of this here ""Meatball shop"" and the raving reviews I thought maybe I might, but in Williamsburgh, Bedford Ave the ""Fifth Avenue"" of Hipster Central oof that would be tough.  I swallowed my pride but saved enough room for some most delicious food.  The owners spent a long time in planning out the menu and the decor, both are great. Meatballs and their many different flavors, so many my head began to spin.  I've been here twice now and the last time I went solo, sat at the bar and was greeted by a very nice bartender, long black hair, tattoos.  She didn't have to sell be too much when she described with love her opinion of the days special meatball, steak, bacon & cheddar.  Had me a pint of Brooklyn Brownstone, kicked back and enjoyed a most delicious meatball sandwich one of which my dad would have approved of.",4.0
"nom nom nomspicy pork meatball with pesto, mozz, provolone, on a brioche bun.theyre open late. i got in here at like 1am on a saturday night. I've heard the location in the city is always mobbed.

"$70 of mediocrity. shocking this place has four stars. It was totally decent. nothing special at all. I am a food connoisseur and an avid carnivore and I couldn't honestly tell the meatballs apart. It was weak, guys! The service was friendly and the place was ok. Go if you want. Otherwise, go to Teddy's at N8 and Berry and LIVE",3.0

"I've eaten at the Meatball Shop twice.  My first experience was pretty good.  I like the fact that they have some veggie balls on the menu for those of us who do not eat meat, and the sauce of the day was pretty creative.  Going back a few weeks later I was really disappointed.  The music was so loud that the three of us eating just wanted to leave as soon as possible.  Our waitress was too busy dancing to the obnoxiously loud music to notice that we were through with our meal and waiting for the check.  Not only was the music really loud, but vulgar as well.  I don't want to hear the lyrics to ""but I got high"" when I'm taking friends or family out to eat.  Don't have any interest in going back.",2.0
"I've been here two times.  The meatballs are okay, but the thing that I really love is the ice cream sandwich- you get to choose the ice cream and the cookies used.  I also enjoy the cocktails- you get to choose the mixer and the type of liquor.  I recommend the spice and lime with vodka.  It can get pretty crowded so I'd recommend going at off hours if possible.",3.0
"Quick update:  Just received a courteous note from TMS regarding my review.  I am amazed that they actually read and respond to reviews... I thought that was very cool.  Just because of that, I will give TMS another shot the next time i'm craving meatballs in Wburg... maybe my experience there was just an off-night.. We all have 'em, right?",3.0
"I love a good homecooked meatball, I love a good gourmet meatball. These fall somewhere in between. They're good, don't get me wrong, but they just don't stand out like they do to a lot of reviewers. But I do go back, as it's way easier than making meatballs yourself. But one thing seriously bugs me about the ordering process (not enough to minus stars or anything). I call the Bedford Ave place and what I want is four meatballs, a sampler if you will: two of the classic, one of the pork, one of the chicken. And this always trips them up! It's so bizarre - you can get meatballs by the four - the Naked Balls special - but they have to all be the same type. Try and order a mix of four, and they'll be like, ""you know you can get four of the same and save a dollar."" Ha, OK, but I want all the types, and I have a dollar to burn. Except, there's no dish that includes four DIFFERENT meatballs, so you have to get singles. Then they ask what sort of sauce I want for each individual meatball. And I suppose I could be that guy who gets a single meatball with a different sauce times four. But I say, no, just put them all in one box, it's fine. And this seems confusing to them!Guys: all I want is four stupid meatballs in sauce! I might want five someday! I might want three! I just don't understand why they sound so confused over this order. Maybe I should just be the guy who orders four different meatballs in four different sauces.",3.0

"I'd been waiting for this place to open for a while now. Finally got to try it out last night.A few things that struck me before I make it to the food. The atmosphere was not what I expected. A little to stiff and trendy for the type of food...It's a meatball place for god's sake, not momofuku. Speaking of stiff, the management here has their priorities completely off. The entire time we were there, the managers were bitching at waiters for not having the menus lined up properly and for the tables not lining up with ""the fifth line of the wood in the floor"" (I'm not exaggerating), and the menus perfectly lining up to the borders of the table facing out. It was soooooo ridiculous. Then both managers stood at the table next to ours, carefully looking at the menus deciding if they should be laid out vertically or horizontally. Our waiter asked us, what do you guys think? I replied that they were wasting way too much time concerning themselves with the orientation of the menus, to which one of the managers replied, ""I'm a stickler for this stuff"", and didn't even ask how our experience was. While I appreciate attention to detail his time would be better spent walking around and asking people if they like their food, and not bitching at his wait staff. I don't know what kind of place these guys think they are running... once again, it's a meatball place not blue hill at stone barns. And the meatballs are fine, not the best I've ever had but did the job for a late night meal. I had the spicy pork meatballs with tomato sauce over polenta. I'd try something else next time but I'm in no rush to go back. Hopefully when I make it back these dudes will have figured out the orientation of the menu (god knows that's what keeps customers coming back) and will be having a bit more fun with the place.

"I went to this place over the summer and totally forgot to write a review about it. It deserves one so here goes...It was the end of a free screening of Jurassic Park in McCarren Park and I was already a little tipsy after having 2 cans of the Six Point they were selling at the movie. Anyway that's beside the point. I was hungry and my friend and I passed The Meatball Shop and I drunkenly/classily said ""OMG there is one of those on the Lower East Side!"" So we went in and I just got a normal bowl of the meatballs and traditional sauce. It's a nice place but it was also great drunk food. Saucy and messy and just right. My friend got a meatball sandwich which also satisfied me. This was a few months ago, but I still remember the drinks. They are unique, fruity, and interesting. Seriously, I told the guy I liked gin and pomegranate or something and he recommended me one of their specialty drinks (I don't remember what it was, but it was good). They had a giant vat of sangria out too. I need to go back and try an ice cream sandwich. I recommend this place wholeheartedly. You can't lose there. They do simple really well.

Hubby and I both went with the smash (beef balls, tomato sauce, and mozz cheese-hubby went without cheese). It came with an arugula and apple salad on the side. I was super impressed with the service. Everyone was really nice and the food came quickly. The sandwich was delicious. It was on Brioche bread and the flavors of the sauce, meat, and cheese really came through. I thought the meatballs were light but flavorful.

Stopped here with a friend when we were walking around Williamsburg and we were both pleasantly surprised. She got the kitchen sink and I got a sandwich.

"Who doesn't love meatballs?  My friends and I were sat fairly quickly at about 9:00 on a Sunday night.  We all tried different balls, with different sauces, on different bases.  None of us were disappointed.  You write your order down with dry-erase markers, so there is little room for server error.  I was looking forward to desert (pick your cookie, pick your ice cream), but the ice cream was icy, not creamy, and didn't have a ton of flavor.  But the meatballs more than made up for the last course :)",4.0
"pretty good food; great drinks; awful service.i wouldn't travel for it, and if there were a wait to get in, i would go elsewhere... but if i found myself in the neighborhood craving balls of meat one early afternoon, i'd do it again.",3.0
"The atmosphere here is awesome and so is the whole concept of this place. I love their menu and how its lets you pick and choose what you like. Of course the meatballs here are phenomenal. I had the chicken meatballs with the Parmesan sauce and it was just perfect! The sides here are amazing: arugula and apple salad, green beans, white beans, mashed potatoes, polenta! I can't wait to come back and try the sliders, sloppy joes, and heroes because they all looked amazing. O yeah did I mention they have jello shots!!!!!!",5.0
Stopped here with a friend when we were walking around Williamsburg and we were both pleasantly surprised. She got the kitchen sink and I got a sandwich. The veggies on both were fresh and well prepared. She said her only disappointment was that the 'spicy pork' with the 'spicy sauce' were not spicy as the same would suggest. My sandwich/salad was fantastic. My only complaint was that the service was fairly slow. I would definitely go there again for a leisurely lunch!,4.0
"i've been to all the meatball shop locations, and this location and the village one is my favorite. (LES one needs a little help and organization) i always get the vegetarian meatballs, and although its not all that great (dry, hard, cold) i can appreciate the fact that they even put vegetarian meatballs on their menu! the meat/poultry based ones all have pork was what i was told by the waiter..they seems to come fresh and hot unlike the vegetarian ones which taste and seem frozen i LOVE their vegetable sides esp when they have fennel. the arugula salad is so fresh . I always feel like i have gotten my daily dose of greens when i eat here without feeling like you have spent $10 on a vegetable side to only get 3 pieces of wilting green beans with butter on it. i was debating on taking 1 star off b/c their vegetarian meatballs really, really could use some work (i don't mind it being grain based instead of soy, but it's rock hard and dry) BUT it's nice that this place has thought of the vegetarians. its a place where the veggies and meat lovers can dine at an an affordable price. as far as ambience goes: this bedford location as you can guess is hipster, full of hipster parents with their little ones",5.0

I've been coming here on all occasions. But mainly on those Friday Saturday late nights when you get out of a bar and need some comfort food before bed. I also love their homemade ice cream sandwich.

"Me and 3 friends are visiting the city from Las Vegas and heard of this great restaurant in Brooklyn, so we go all the way out there to try it out. We had a great experience while we were eating and the food was amazing! When it was time to pay we asked the waitress if we could get separate bills, she told us no. Also, I had bought a cookbook that was added to the bill as well. We all payed our shares and left the tip on the table.

Granted, yes, she was right; but, the cookbook shouldn't have been added to the tip and our bills should have been separated. I was so appalled that she would say that to guests in her workplace.

"I honestly tried this place with an open mind.  The positive: everyone is genuinely nice, like not from New York nice (which is common in Williamsburg).  The negative: the food is absolutely terrible.  I don't understand how anyone can like it.  Maybe if you're not Italian, but anyone who has had good meatballs, cannot say these are up to par.  The classic beef meatballs taste like sausages.  Beef meatballs shouldn't have pork, which is why you would specifically designate it a ""beef"" meatball, otherwise it's just a meatball.  Because of how they make their balls, the texture is so odd, and far from appetizing.  The sauces they serve are also akin to some neighborhood average pizzeria.  The classic tomato is disappointing, the mushroom gravy is nauseating, and the parmesan sauce is way too overpowering.  The sides.  The sides are ridiculous.  I had a feeling $5 risotto might not be good.  It was undercooked, which might not be the worst thing if it tasted good, but it did not.  My honest recommendation is to avoid this place.  There are much better places in Williamsburg.  Go to Diner, Traif, Rye, Dressler, if you want to eat out and have a good time.  OR, just stay home and make your own meatballs, because I promise, they will be 100% better.",1.0

We also got cocktails which were very good. The service was great, everyone was friendly and helpful, and they were quick. I can't wait to go back!",5.0

"early dinner. started with a watermelon margarita special cocktail. didn't have much watermelon taste, mostly tasted like tequila :) it was my first time at a meatball shop so i got the sliders to try a few different balls. had the beef with mushroom gravy, chicken with creamy parmesan, and spicy pork with spicy meat sauce. they were all very good, the beef being my fav. for dessert i went with the chocolate chip cookie/vanilla ice cream sandwich. can't go wrong with a traditional ""chipwich"" style. it was great. will definitely be back to do some more ballin'!",4.0
"I honestly tried this place with an open mind.  The positive: everyone is genuinely nice, like not from New York nice (which is common in Williamsburg).  The negative: the food is absolutely terrible.  I don't understand how anyone can like it.  Maybe if you're not Italian, but anyone who has had good meatballs, cannot say these are up to par.  The classic beef meatballs taste like sausages.  Beef meatballs shouldn't have pork, which is why you would specifically designate it a ""beef"" meatball, otherwise it's just a meatball.  Because of how they make their balls, the texture is so odd, and far from appetizing.  The sauces they serve are also akin to some neighborhood average pizzeria.  The classic tomato is disappointing, the mushroom gravy is nauseating, and the parmesan sauce is way too overpowering.  The sides.  The sides are ridiculous.  I had a feeling $5 risotto might not be good.  It was undercooked, which might not be the worst thing if it tasted good, but it did not.  My honest recommendation is to avoid this place.  There are much better places in Williamsburg.  Go to Diner, Traif, Rye, Dressler, if you want to eat out and have a good time.  OR, just stay home and make your own meatballs, because I promise, they will be 100% better.",1.0
I've heard this from A LOT of people but I got food poisoning from the beef meatballs.It was not pretty and I couldn't eat solid foods for days after it.Consider yourself warned.,1.0

I went here the other night for a quick bite before hitting Brooklyn Bowl for a show. The food was great and the staff was super friendly. I order the pork balls with classic spicy tomato sauce over a bed of veggies while my friend ordered the veggie balls with pesto sauce. They were both delicious!

"I got a veggie sandwich on wheat with pesto sauce. The veggie ""meat""balls were very dry and too bready. The wheat bread tasted stale.

"I was expecting a long wait after it was impossible to barely step in at the LES location but once we entered it was pretty much empty. Service was great except when i received mozarella instead of provolone. Wasnt very happy about that since im lactose intolerant and my lactaid can only help me so much lol. The meatballs are ok. Not amazing, not bad. I got the beef meatballs with the creamy sauce on a hero. I expected only 3 but i think i got either 4 or 5 so that was cool. The side salad that came with the meatball was a nice touch, probably the most enjoyable part of the meal. It was an arugula and apple salad and tasted pretty delicious for something as simple as it was. The major disapointment of the meal had to be the ice cream sandwich. I got the peanut butter with vanilla and the cookies were rock hard. On top of that the ice cream was crystalizing. Maybe because it was at too low a temperature or maybe not stored properly. Who knows. Oh also, no communal table like the other location. Plus for me as I like my own personal space especially when eating messy food like a meatball sandwich.",3.0
"Took a drive out to Williamsburg yesterday (Labor Day) to see if the great reviews equaled AMAZING meatballs.  It didn't disappoint.  Based on my review of the menu before I went, I had a plan all set!!!  I'd have the Naked Balls (beef) with the classic tomato sauce and an ice cream sandwich.  And that's JUST what I did!  But after having my first 4 meatballs and thinking it would be enough for me (they looked much bigger on the website) I ordered 4 more (I was hungry and didn't have breakfast).  The beef are perfectly seasoned and the sauce was JUST PERFECT with the fresh grated cheese on top.  My second round were the spicy pork with the parmesan cream sauce - this sauce was HEAVEN!!!  Spicy pork was good... but I liked the beef better.  My bf had a sandwich of beef meatballs with mozzarella cheese and pesto sauce on white bread.  I loved my meal but was reeeeeeally jealous of his.  The pesto sauce was the best I ever had and the white bread they use is crispy and chewy - mmmmmm....  Wish I had that sandwich RIGHT NOW!!!!  He loved the small salad that was served with it.  Greens with pieces of apples and a simple olive oil dressing.  My only disappointment were the drinks we had.  He had the red sangria which was served in a really small glass with lots of ice (for $6) and I had the special which was called Waterfelon Margarita ($9).  It was way........ too strong (also served in a really small glass with LOTS of ice) - I would have liked more of a sweet watermelon taste to balance out what must have been at least 4 different alcohols in it.  I know this because we were sitting at the bar and he made it right in front of us.  It was either the bar or a 20 min. wait.  Next time I'll wait for a table.  Bar stools can get REALLY uncomfortable for me after 10 mins.  The guy at the bar that took our order was really nice and attentive and had lots of suggestions for us being that it was our first time.  The menu's reminded me of The Bistro Burger (the way you check off what it is you want).  Or is it the Meatball Shop that had that style menu/ordering first???  Well, whatever!!  I was diggin' that!!!  Their ice cream sandwiches were also VERY similar.  Only I loved The Meatball Shop's better because the cookies they use are softer.  They also let you have any 2 cookies you want.  I had one  half ginger snap cookie and the other half brownie with vanilla ice cream.  The brownie was far..... better!!  I will ALWAYS save room for this ice cream sandwich when I go there because they're just so good!!!!  You have 5 different cookies and 6 different ice creams to choose from and that's not counting the special of the day that they have in BOTH the cookie and the ice cream.  So next time I go back - IT'S ON!!!!!  The neighborhood is extremely congested with people on small sidewalks and we were very lucky to find parking right away.  I'm not going to lie.  I would love to get in on the action of congestion and explore the neighborhood a bit the next time I go back.  And believe me.....

"I'm visiting NY as a previous resident from SF. I get really excited about food and have worked in the service industry for 7 years.

I will not recommend this place to any friends visiting Williamsburg, but I am also aware this doesn't really make a difference given the location and super cool concept. I do hope the management makes some sort of effort to let the staff know more is expected of them.

"This is the second location of The Meatball Shop, the first one being in the lower east side. The Meatball Shop is one of those places that does one thing really well. It's a restaurant you walk into and wonder why you didn't think of the idea first because they are absolutely killing it. They serve meatballs, obviously. You can get them on a hero or naked (in a bowl with sauce and no bread). You can get them over polenta, pasta, or salad or have one of these items on the side. The options are spicy pork, beef, chicken and veggie balls. I believe they also have a special meatball every night. My wife and I chose to get the spicy pork meatballs and the beef both naked. They come in a bowl of 4 meatballs covered in the sauce of your choosing (classic tomato, spicy meat sauce, etc.). We chose to get one with classic tomato sauce and the other with spicy meat sauce. We also ordered polenta and spinach as a side. Everything was great, the classic beef to me were the clear winners. The pork were good, but had a little bit of a Frank's Red Hot sauce taste to them I wasn't too psyched about. The polenta was excellent. it had cheese mixed in and was highlighted when you put some meatballs and sauce over it. The spinach was a little bland, but you can't expect much from steamed spinach.

"Have been to Meatball Shop a handful of times and have always enjoyed the food, ambiance and service. Until last night when we went around 6:30pm. I understand that you are popular and busy, but that doesn't give you the right to be rude and dismissive. We were seated and able to make all of our food and drink choices and still no one came over so we flagged someone down and gave him our filled out menus. Fine, no big. He was very pleasant and (I assume) quickly input our order. However the entire time waiting for our food we never received our drinks (the super delicious non alcoholic iced tea) so when the food came I politely informed the runner that our drinks hadn't come yet. His response: a very snotty ""well the bar makes the drinks and it's slammed so you'll get it eventually"". UHH WRONG ANSWER. The proper way to respond would be ""sorry bout that, let me check on it for you"". I was honestly so stunned by how rudely he responded over a simple request that I just stared at him dumbfounded. Am I really supposed to believe that pouring 2 non alcoholic iced teas takes longer than 2 meals + a side to come out of the kitchen? Thankfully another random waitress happened to witness this dudes attitude problem and quickly popped over to assure us the drinks were coming right up. Which they did. Go back to hospitality school, angry hipster.",3.0
"I was visiting from out of town and had lunch here with a friend who lives in the neighborhood. I loved the plethora of options on the menu -- you can mix and match and have a different experience every time you go. I stayed traditional with the beef meatballs and the spicy tomato sauce over spaghetti. It was absolutely delicious, incredibly filling, and I was astounded at how reasonable the prices were. I would definitely stop in again.",4.0

"The service was fine on a Tuesday evening at the bar, and it wasn't ridiculously loud, so they must be listening.  Still the beef meatballs with meatsauce  were way TOO salty.  And the Six Points tasted off as well, chemically.",2.0

"Went here for my first time out dining in Brooklyn with a friend. The atmosphere was friendly and relaxed and the place was designed with a great eye. Our waitress Jackie was awesome and helped give my friend and I great suggestions. The sliders were awesome and so were the baguettes and thank god I left room for dessert. Great prices, fresh delicious food, friendly great service - can't go wrong - highly suggest",5.0
"Everyone always raves about their grandma's meatball recipe. And for some reason or another, they claim to never try any other that comes from another cooks kitchen. I wish my grandmother could make meatballs like this place. (She's Puerto Rican) That doesn't mean I don't know what one should taste like. The Meatballs here are perfectly balanced in size and taste. Their balls (yeah, I had to go there) are not too meat-y, but not too bread-y, not too spicy, but not too bland. Their sauce was mildly tart, but not sweet, and the rest was just what you should expect from someone who claims to be 'The Meatball Shop.' Overall, I had a pleasant experience having going past midnight, everything is Williamsburg-ly priced but in this instance the hype should be there.",5.0

"Have been to Meatball Shop a handful of times and have always enjoyed the food, ambiance and service. Until last night when we went around 6:30pm.

"I probably would have given 4 stars had the staff been a little more friendly. I visited this place on a tuesday around midnight. Place was not too crowded but an ok crowd. I decided to take out. Ordered my food and the cash register girls tells me to ""wait over there"" over there being immediately to your right if you are facing her. No problem. I wait  ""over there"" About 2 minutes into my wait i am asked to move because i am blocking the way or the compost bin or whatever. Fine... i move again. This time by one of the waiter stations. One of the workers was on her laptop and evidently thought i was in her business. So she looked at me and then changed her position so as not to have her laptop in my view. Like i really gave a flying fvck. However she keeps turning around looking at me. Finally she opens her mouth in an arrogant way and says ""can I help you? are you waiting for something?"" I just looked at her and said yes... takeout. She says... ""oh.. ok"" Needless to say the staff needs some customer services lessons. Other than that the meatball hero was small but tasty. I will be back. Hopefully the staff will be a little more customer friendly.",3.0
"This place was huge disappointment. I came with my husband and young child and was forgotten about as soon as we were seated.  As the surrounding tables buzzed with service and plates of food, we had to make someone stop and help us. The waitress proceded to tell us that her shift was ending and some other guy was actually our server (thanks but, not our problem). She was, in fact, in our section working the whole time we were seated (which was way too long due to the lack of attention we received) and was not responsible for us apparently. Super long story short. We didn't actually meet our alleged ""waiter"" until we asked for our check. The only reason we got food at all was by passing our order through someone who said they would tell our waiter who remained a mystery until we were finished eating. Not once did anyone ask if all was ok or if we needed anything. All was not ok, and we DID need things. Dealing with the heartbreakingly poor service with a toddler in tow is a combination that is best left unvisited, just like The Meatball Shop in Williamsburg should be. This makes me very sad to say because I really wanted to like it.  Unfortunately, the food did not make up for the complete lack of professionalism we experienced or the cookies the manager offered us as consolation when we brought our experience her attention. We were too defeated and just wanted our time and money back, which we won't get. Oh well, we learned the hard way.",1.0
"I love meatballs.  Honestly, they're one of my favorite foods. An entire restaurant devoted to them sounds like a fantastic idea in theory.    I've eaten here about three times now, and I am underwhelmed every single time.  I honestly think that a meatball parm hero from the local pizzeria is way more flavorful, delicious and cheap.  If you do go, I would recommend at least getting things that you can't typically get at the local pizzeria - I usually do the spicy pork meatballs or the classic beef (the spicy pork aren't necessarily that spicy) and pair it with either the mushroom cream sauce or the pesto and mozzarella cheese.  I usually get whole wheat, but their whole wheat bread is super heavy. The salads that come with the heroes are actually delicious - fresh arugula with crisp apple slices.    The drinks are okay - they have some interesting mixed drinks, but they are kind of pricey.",3.0
