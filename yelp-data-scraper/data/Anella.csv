"Nice, charming little place. Got there at about 1pm (on a Monday with light snow) and there were only 1 or 2 other tables occupied. One server, polite and attentive. I was sad that I couldn't get the dinner plates shown in some of the pictures here on yelp, but I chose the most interesting thing I could find on lunch. I got a ham sandwich with a melted cheese. The sandwich actually came topped with 2 eggs sunny side up. I chose mesclun salad on the side (not much of a fries-guy), and the whole plate was clean like within 10 min. The server appears to be in control of the music, and it made for a really relaxing lunch. It could hardly have been any better.",5.0
"This was just awful! The bread was old, the waiter could not smile once!! Total let down. How can you serve old bread for the chicken sandwich as well as for the Croque Madame or Monsieur. How embarrassing. Also the ham was way too salty. Will never go back there.It is my first review. Was soo upset I had to inform you all.",1.0
"Absolutely delightful ... I've made a note to visit Anella a while ago and had a chance to follow through last night.  Walking in, you get a cozy feeling, a narrow space with a few wooden tables and a long bar (with quite a selection); as you walk back, you're pleasantly surprised by additional seating around the corner that is just as inviting.  Staff are friendly and welcoming. The scents that are coming out of the kitchen are very enticing.  And then you get your food ... Mmhhmmm.  Oh the freshly baked bread that is served in little flower pots with a side of delicious butter.  We ordered the evening's special appetizer, prosciutto and sausage with some pickled vegetables that are ""pickled for a year"" and toasted bread with parmesan button - absolutely delicious! The curried butternut squash soup with roasted pumpkin seed and sage - great balance of sweetness and nuttiness, and having used the waiter's advise, dipping the bread into the soup - simply delectable.  For entrees - Pappardelle with Short Rib Ragout, Shitake Mushrooms, Créme Fraiche, and Pecorino; as well as Bucatini a la Carbonara with Pancetta, Poached Egg, and Parmesan.  Pasta was perfectly al dente and great flavor.  My only slight complaint is that the ragout was a bit too salty (though I certainly enjoyed the left overs today).  Unfortunately, did have enough room for dessert but determined to try some next time.I've been raving about Anella all day at work today and can't wait to go back for more.",4.0
"I am not a reviewer who gives three stars either I love hard or hate hard. The thing with our anella experience though was meh... some shades of brilliance followed by stomach pains and upset all night! :( The warm bread in. flower pot- is unique and delicious, the burrata salad was excellent, the lobster ravioli was ok ok and the chicken ... the skin was crispy but nothing else to write about the food. To sum it up but for the bread nothing wowed me and I wasnt too happy with the stomach upset.",3.0
"This is one of those meals that I categorize under ""One of the Best Meals of My Life."" It also happened to be my first meal in New York, so it set a pretty high precedent.After walking around Brooklyn a bit I decided it was time for some dinner. I passed a couple of nice looking spots, all of which were packed, and then saw Anella on an opposite street corner. With the rain threatening to drop any moment overhead, I decided to eat here.Anella is small and intimate, with seating also available in a patio area out back. Inside is warm and inviting, with candlelight, warm, worn wood, and a rustic, modern feel. The menu has a lot of different options depending on your mood, but when I see pasta my eyes zero in and there's sort of no turning back. I went with the pappardelle in a lamb ragu, despite the fact that I'm not a big fan of lamb, and a side of the broccoli cooked in garlic and chili flakes. Freshly baked bread served in a terra cotta flower pot was brought to the table with butter, and it got devoured. So delicious, but unfortunately when I asked the waitress for another pot she said, ""Oh, we've sort of gone through a lot of bread today so, uh - "" I wasn't sure if that was her way of saying they only wanted to give one pot per table, or if she was embarrassed to say they were running short on bread, so I just spared her the rest of the explanation and politely told her thank you but never mind.The pasta came and it was some of the best I've ever had, anywhere. The pappardelle was handmade, and compared to other places I've been to where pasta is usually served in skimpy portions, especially if it was made by hand, the serving size was pretty decent. The ragu was incredible, the lamb was extremely tender, and I wished I had an endless supply of the dish. The broccoli was a fresh accompaniment to the pasta and very well flavored.I went with a slice of orange olive oil cake for dessert, and just like with the pasta, this cake is in the top three best cakes ice ever eaten. So moist, in a Grand Marnier sauce and a dollop of cream with orange zest - it inspired me to find a recipe to make at home because I'm officially obsessed. I generally prefer pie to cake, but if this was the only dessert I could ever eat again, I'd have zero complaints.Anella won't break the bank (entrees averaged about $13-16 dollars a plate) and the quality of food was outstanding. If I lived in Brooklyn, or anywhere near it, I'd be at Anella all the time.",5.0
Good burger no much different from the orders little expensive but is ok the brunch is good too,3.0
"Anella is an adorable little spot in Greenpoint that serves wholesome dishes with pride. The menu is simple and not Brooklyn-hipster intimidating (unlike some of the fashionable patrons) and the waitress was happy to give suggestions. I visited after the refinery29 exhibit and the staff of this quiet neighborhood joint were a bit overwhelmed. None the less, we were seated and served promptly. If you can, sit in the garden outside. It's beautiful even when it's slightly raining. The bread is baked in a cute flower pot and is served warm. The half chicken I ate here was so deliciously juicy I could've ordered seconds. Worth a trip to Brooklyn. And please get the chicken!",5.0
"This was our third time at Anella, and it just keeps getting better and better. We had the burrata with fig jam and butternut squash soup to start - the soup was perfect for the weather. Main dishes were the fettuccini and the pumpkin gnocchi - both of which were absolutely outstanding and delicious and are why I'm giving Anella 5 stars. Also got a side of perfectly crispy Brussels sprouts and ordered drinks. Decent prices, friendly, not overbearing staff, and cozy atmosphere make this a place we keep coming back to.",5.0
"*This is a review based on food I tried from TASTE Williamsburg Greenpoint*Spicy Chilled Corn Soup from AnellaThere is nothing better than a cup of (or, in this case, a shot of) chilled soup on a hot day. While I could not taste much spiciness from the ""spicy"" chilled corn soup, the little shot of creamy soup contained so many natural ingredients like the corn, parsley, and crab meat that played well together.",4.0
Service spot on. Reservation ready. Lovely backyard. Good and strong drinks: dark and stormy and a Moscow mule. Music is old school rock and Motown. Bread in flower pot smells better than it tastes but it's just fine. Butter with salt is yummy. Spicy corn chowder with crab was delicious. All puréed with crab spoonful in center. Would return just for the hot soup.   Burrata is good but I didn't like the sweetness. I prefer savory. Crostini was chewy. Had 1/2 portion of homemade gnocchi with pork bolognese and broccoli rabe. Perfect portion and flavor. Hubby had burger with bacon jam. Perfectly cooked medium rare with great roll. Will tell friends and will be back.,4.0
"YUMMY!! Mostly a brunch place for me on a Saturday.. Food: 1. Anella Burger-  Amazing 2. Smoked Salmon Benedict-- THE BEST!! 3. French Toast-- MUST HAVE 4. They have amazing fries Pros: 1. Love the venue of the place-- very old style and cozy 2. You are separated from the other people around you so that you can have a conversation without hearing everyone else. 3. The staff is great 4. Love that the kitchen is an open area so you can see in Cons: 1. I came in for brunch one time with friends and they asked if we made reservations, we didn't so they made us wait about 15 mins mind you the place had about 3 tables only full the rest were empty and we got sat next to the window coming in and during the hour and a half we spent there no one come in with a reservation and during the entire time the place was about half full. I was very upset and the treatment-- i would understand if they were packed but the place was never more then half full the entire time. Still recommend you going-- During dinner they give bread served in a flower pot very cute!",4.0

"This place has been serving fresh, imaginative, delicious food for years.  The kale salad continues to be a standout, and now they've added a great cauliflower one as well.

"I recently had the pleasure of dining at Anella.  It was everything I hoped and expected it would be.  Somewhat off the beaten path up in the northwestern corner of Greenpoint, Anella is an unassuming, rustic and inviting establishment on a quiet street.  We went on a frigid Sat night, and it provided the perfect escape from the cold, snowy reality outside.We started with cocktails at the bar while we waited for our friends to arrive.  The list is well-curated and offers a little something for every taste.  I had a drink with mezcal and green chartreuse (I think) and it was bonkers.  The bar keep was friendly and knowledgeable, which was a good start to the evening.Once seated, our service was prompt, attentive and helpful.  Our meal started with the delicious and often-cited dinner rolls, which although a little campy/kitschy, come served in a flower pot.  As a party of 4, we opted to share everything to try to leverage the menu as much as possible.  We had the following:- Risotto fritters, Mussels and Tagliatelle to start- Monkfish, the Burger, Lamb and Roasted Chicken for our mains- Fries and Brussels sprouts as sides- Dessert (sadly, I don't remember what we had, but I do remember enjoying it)Everything was delicious.  Nothing was just sort of 'meh' or a miss.  I can't remember the last time I went to a restaurant and enjoyed every single thing that I consumed.  What's more, their wine list is really well-considered and approachable with modest prices.  Overall, we had a great dining experience and really enjoyed the atmosphere.  Although I don't make it to this part of Brooklyn very often, I'm glad to know this place is here, holding it down strong for the neighborhood.  They apparently offer lunch and brunch service as well, so there is ample opportunity to check them out.  It's not really the type of place you'd go with a large group, but if you're 4-6 people, or just a pair, Anella is a great option that you shouldn't miss out on.",4.0
"I love Anella and go almost every weekend. It's a little down the road on Franklin towards not much else, but it's a great gem of a place.I've had both brunch and dinner here, and it's been amazing every time. For brunch, I tend to like my good old fashioned American Breakfast (though their egg biscuit is pretty damn good too.) The bacon is nice and thick, eggs perfectly made, and nice crunchy potatoes every time.

"To quote the legendary ad - ""I can't believe I ate the whole thing.""Following Nadia Z's glowing review, my newly-designated fiancée and I (we got engaged NYE, forgive me if I mention her a little too often this time) came in here for brunch. We were particular about our selection - it needed mimosas, and it needed smoked salmon benedict. Anella absolutely delivered!First of all, the place is absolutely charming. The decor is run-down-on-purpose, giving it a cozy, relaxed feeling. Everyone we encountered was very polite, no complaints there! Their brunch menu is a perfect size - enough options to stay interesting for a few more trips, but not so large as to be dizzying.For my part, I tried the blueberry brioche french toast, and the fiancée had the smoked salmon benedict - we also ordered the mysterious pastry basket, which came first. The contents apparently rotate by the day, but the warm donut holes are not to be missed! That said, it's definitely to be split, because the basket + an entree would probably make any single diner explode.The portions are generous. Which is a gentle way of saying that they're ridiculously large, but my french toast was so tasty it was well worth the ensuing stomachache I got from stuffing my face. It's a very sweet french toast, so it suits me fine, but might not be to everyone's taste. Make sure to spread the cream around - it's absolutely vital to the dish! The candied pecans were also a nice touch, even though I'm not really a pecan man.The smoked salmon benedict got two thumbs up, and my girl knows her brunch salmons. She said it was fresh and tasty, though far too much to finish - I helped her on the home fries that came with it, which were also very good.Mind, you get what you pay for. While not exorbitant, it's easy to order more than you can manage, and you may end up with a check to match. Expect large portions though, and you'll do just fine.",5.0

(Love at first sight, what can you do?)I found it by chance - simply because my company could not make their minds about food they wanted and decision to find something in that particular area fell on my shoulders. Boy, I am glad it did.It is simple set up, tables up front, bar area - and most gorgeous backyard covered by pergola. There is a garden at far end of the yard, very lovely to sit next to. Tomatoes growing, and strawberries ready to pick (don't you dare!).Very friendly hosts and owner, quick, polite, nice.Drinks are good - I tried Revolver and one more, with french name that escapes me, they were both on level. They have several beers and wine list as well.But what is worth to rave about...food. Artisanal is a right term for it. Short menu is seasonal, local, and everything is so freaking delicious you want to try everything. Every single thing.They start you with fresh bread - and when I say fresh, it is fresh - piping hot and freshly baked, in most adorable clay pot. (The shape of it reminded me of Russian babka breads)For appetizers, Burrata with roasted beets and oranges is amazing. Homemade, soft, creamy, and sliced roasted beets are great base to it. It also topped with arugula, perfect pairing. Really liked that it was light.You can also get side dishes for starters - brussels sprouts with pecorino breadcrumbs were pretty good!Their pastas are handmade as well. I tried Tagliatelle with peas, pork shank and creme fraiche - it was really, really good. Even half-portions are decent size and filling.The Ricotta Gnocchi they have tho is the best item on menu (so far). Delicious. With wild fresh mushrooms (morels, yum! Have not seen those in a long, long time!), truffled parmesan broth and poached egg on top - that is something worth ordering every time you here. Trust me. Gnocchi have nice bite to it, broth mixed with runny egg after you cut it open, and the taste of mushrooms will make you swoon.Absolutely worth visiting. A must. Get in here and try it. I am coming back, soon. Very, very soon.~officially in love with Anella~",5.0

"Anella is one of my favorite restaurants in Greenpoint. There is literally nothing I don't like about this place. The ambiance is awesome--it is super warm and welcoming. I usually like eating at the bar, because the bartenders are usually really friendly and strike up good convos while we wait for our meals. The cocktail menu is great change regularly (the bartenders are always coming up with delicious new concoctions), and the bar is always stocked with the best selections of liquor and wine. One of my favorite things about this place is the house-made bread--it is TO DIE FOR. You might have to throw your low-carb diet out the door for this one meal alone so you can taste what is surely the bread of the gods. The standout dishes are as follows (in order of meal course): the brussels sprouts app, the broccoli app, the mussels app, the chicken entree and the sausage entree. Everything on the menu is great, but those are the dishes I always go back to.",5.0
"We sat in the covered garden in the back, which was extremely charming and romantic. I love the atmosphere and can see why they get such good reviews. Tables were well spaced out, which was a relief, considering how tightly squeezed places force you to be when they're this popular!Bread came out in a lovely little mini flower pot. Enjoy them slowly, though - only one pot per customer! They were nice enough to refill us with some country-style bread later on when we asked, though. Service isn't especially fast, but the atmosphere is casual and laid-back - it promotes a relaxing and slow dining experience, so I didn't mind the slow pace when ordering each course.I enjoyed a spectacular beer by the bottle - forget the name of it, but it came in a large format and I had a bottle and a half (split the second one) - was more than enough for the meal. Price was right too for a high ABV! The food itself was fantastic. Each course was better than the last. I tried the spring onion soup as a starter, which was incredible - though might not be as ideal now that the weather is heating up. I had the sea bass as my main and it was SO GOOD. I highly recommend it for a main. Also split the Brussels Sprouts -- equally delicious and a great accompaniment to the sea bass!",4.0
Amazing food and reasonably priced. Went here on an impromptu date and it was a good mix of casual and classy. The service was good and the atmosphere was pleasant. Highly recommend the Gemelli and buratta.,5.0

"This was the best meal I had in awhile. Homemade bread was awesome. Hamburger with bacon jam was amazing.The donut desert was pretty good, albeit  simple.The only minor things were:1) The wine wasn't as good as I wanted it to b (the Pinot), 2) I did take my kid with me- it was early and empty but still did feel uneasy about it when walked in and asked for a table. But whatever - maybe it was just me. I knew I was taking a risk.",4.0
"Good ambience and music. The drinks and good as well and they have a nice outdoor seating. However if you want some epic.. Or even good food, skip this place.

Grab a drink, enjoy the ambience and bounce.",2.0
"Cute brunch spot!Came here a couple times for brunch this summer, the outdoor seating is Iovely!I ordered a chicken biscuit which was amazing, and my sister had the prosciutto and spinach omelette which was okay. On another occasion, I was underwhelmed by my burger, so I'd pass on it. They have loose tea here which was great, the coffee was okay. There's a lot of great brunch spots around here, I'd give this one a shot!",3.0
Third times a charm. I just love this place. Everything we have tried here the three times we've been here has been really tasty and cooked to perfection. My mom has always taught me to never order chicken but I ordered chicken and wow!!! Was totally blown away with the flavor and how perfectly cooked it was. My husband had the burger with the bacon spread and that was also amazing. We also ordered the pancetta tagliatelle and Brussel sprouts to share.,5.0

I thought the portion sizes were slightly smaller scale especially considering the sizes of the dishes, which is what ultimately knocked off the star.Service 5/5. Drinks were also very yummy and they have their own specialty cocktails which are well made and unique.If you want to get stuffed to the brim with food it might not be the best place for you but this is definitely a place to bring friends to enjoy a good quality meal in an adorable environment.",4.0
They have an outdoor seating area in the back which I love! The server was very helpful with recommendations. Their spicy corn soup was so delicious! Had it with their homemade bread. Ordered the steak frites- was barely room temperature by the time it was served to us but tasty regardless. Also had the half chicken. The salad went so well with the flavor of the chicken! It was a great dining experience but don't think I'd venture all the way out here for this place.,4.0
"I'll start by saying from a cool factor standpoint, they get 5 stars.  Intimate dimly lit bar, unisex ""water closets"", a Brooklyn backyard/garden for dining.

(See what I did there?)....annnnywayyyy.....everything was awesome until the food arrived.Burratta cheese was limp and flat, not a ball of rich and creamy goodness that I've become accustomed to, and a rather small portion.  Maybe the worst burratta I've ever had.  Burger blend was of a meatloaf consistency, which is a pet peeve of mine when chefs do this, because it lacks the juiciness I love.  Also the ""bacon jam"" wasn't a jam so much as a pile of mush, and I wasn't really digging it. And I love bacon.  Fries were good though.  Pasta dishes weren't anyone's favorite either.  Best thing we had was a side of Brussels sprouts.I hear their brunch is good, so I'd give Anella another shot for that.  But dinner, not so much.  Definitely lacked any wow factor.",3.0
"Visiting from out of town and this place was recommended to us. Reviews on Yelp were good so we decided to try it out. All four of us ordered something different.Spicy Corn Soup was delish, and the bread served in a clay pot that I believe it was also baked in was also scrumptious.Steak was so tender I could cut it with a fork!  Burger was a burger,  no real greatness there.  1/2 chicken was juicy and tender.  My order of gnocchi was an altogether different story. Having learned to cook italian gnocchi   from my mother-in-law who is Italian, I know these were not made correctly. They were too big and not curled (for lack of a better term). The meat in the sauce was pretty much flavorless.When our meal came we asked if we could have more bread,  answer was sorry but no! Really,  you can't give me more bread.  Now let's get to the service,  they came to take our appetizer plates away before we were even done.  Then while we were finishing up or dinner I had to stop them from taking away the dinner plate that one of us had not even finished. Great way to make you feel welcomed,  I felt like they were rushing us!  I think we could have done better. ..",3.0
"This spot is super cute. I love the darkness, the wooden tables, the narrow dining rooms, and the long bar. It's situated on a quiet corner in Greenpoint, and was easily missed by me if it weren't for one of my dining party having been there before. I was with a relatively larger group of 7 of my favorite people in the world-the perfect set up for a great meal. We were seated in the back dining room, next to the kitchen. Perhaps if we weren't immediately next to the kitchen it wouldn't have been so smoky, but my first complaint was that the restaurant had no circulation and was smoky the whole meal. It's one of those places you leave a smell like for the rest of the night/the next morning when you wake up. Our waitress informed us that there were no specials this evening, and took our drink orders. Most of us got something off their cocktail list, all of which were really good. The champagne cocktail was surprisingly not too sweet. One of my friends recommended the burger, but a) I don't eat beef, and b) I can't order a burger at a place like this! That being said, there were three burgers ordered and the plates were all cleaned. The gnocchi was what I ordered and I, too finished it. Really awesome flavors and large pillowy potato gnocchi. I liked that the pastas all came in appetizer portions, as well. I honestly don't eat/order pasta as a main dish frequently and this is a great option.Complaint number two had to do with extreme slow service. It was fortunate that I was there with a fabulous group and we just laughed and enjoyed each others company while waiting, but even then I noticed that there was a huge delay in service.

"It's arguable that Brooklyn became a restaurant destination a long time ago. It really didn't until recently.It started when a handful of young, well-funded restaurateurs left Manhattan in search of not just cheaper rent, but of a place where experience didn't matter, and success could come without much effort. For a while, Brooklyn was that place.Brooklyn mastered atmosphere early on. Its style -- emerging from glowing candles in rundown windows and the resurrection of abandoned infrastructure -- became a dazzling patchwork of culture that we now consider commonplace. Today, what we know as 'Brooklyn' serves as an often-obnoxious, artisanal theme that's mimicked all over the world.Nevertheless, at first, food and service in Brooklyn took a back seat. People were willing to compromise basic hospitality for a cool vibe and something strangely new. It worked. But as Brooklyn's market became flooded with inexperienced rich kids looking to pursue their dreams, and the price of living quadrupled (literally in Williamsburg's case), the customers started having standards. The exchange between bohemia and paying customer resulted in the weeding out restaurants that were too stubborn or inexperienced to evolve. The best Brooklyn restaurants survive. Now, food and service each play as critical a role in a restaurant's success as atmosphere does. And while new places like Talde in Park Slope or Littleneck in Gowanus understand that, it's the remaining pioneers that offer the best experience, and Anella is one of them. Anella is to Greenpoint what al di la is to Park Slope, what Motorino used to be for WIlliamsburg. It's a real neighborhood restaurant where all of the fundamentals, including that unique, special Brooklyn vibe, glow like a candle in a window. The food and drinks are excellent, and the staff will do whatever they can to accommodate your requests. On your way out, if you can make it past the door without being thanked by just about everyone, be surprised. One of my favorite restaurants in the borough.",5.0

I eat here maybe three or four times a week but I'm an extravagant dude. This place has a strong menu of food that may give you the itis. They've got what is sometimes the second best burger in NY after Spotted Pig's. The vibe is all varnished wood and high ceilings with a real cozy clubhouse atmosphere. The staff are friendly and knowledgable folks. They change the special house drinks seasonally. Right now they are all Wu Tang themed. After you get used to eating here most other Greenpoint eateries seem bland and unexciting in comparison.Depending on your tastes and whether you get appetizers and drinks expect to spend between 20 and 60 per person.,5.0

My friend had the Ravioli, and that too was incredible. I can't wait to try the Chicken, and the Filet.    The other day I went for brunch and that meal sealed the deal on my decision making process of my favorite restaurant.  THE CHICKEN BISCUIT.  THE. CHICKEN. BISCUIT!  THE FRENCH TOAST.  That's life right there. This place is a must try, even if you're three trains away from it like me. Totally worth the trek, the food is outstanding.  Not to mention the staff is great and I love the cozy, unpretentious vibe.",5.0
"THIS IS THE PLACE.Their menu is simple, their ambiance is cozy and their service never fails. They have the cutest little backyard - perfect for the spring and summer months.

And for the food to be good when you get it to go, it has to be good. Also, hosted a little birthday party for a coworker there. It was such a pleasure dealing with their staff, our servers.Portions aren't HUGE but pretty generous - very fitting for their prices.I believe their menus may be seasonal - right now, def recommend the Smoked Turkey Sandwich - it's freaking awesome.

I thought the dinner i had last time was only ok, so was protesting brunch plans here. i was (fortunately) vetoed and besides, all other spots nearby were not serving at 3;30p. the backyard area was so cute & breezy i loved my Fried Chicken Biscuit. gravy and sauce on the side so got to really taste the chicken - not greasy at all! the rest of the brunch menu looked fantastic",4.0
"This restaurant is solid, I've been here 20 times over the past 4 years, and have never had a bad experience, except having to deal with crowds for brunch.The pastry basket is really good here, I like to get it while waiting for the food, the scones (which they heat up) are to die for.........the dinners and wine selections deserve 5 stars, but I am only giving 4 because I think the brunch could be even better.  The food they have is good, but it is sooooooooo limited.  They have eggs 5 ways, a salad, a hamburger...I think that is it, not much variety at all.  And they don't give bread or any other nibblies while you wait...if it isn't crowded and you want to sit and chat longer, there really aren't any small items to order during the day.  I think they don't mind this from a business perspective, because they are always crowded, but I don't go to brunch there anymore..",4.0
I eat here maybe three or four times a week but I'm an extravagant dude. This place has a strong menu of food that may give you the itis. They've got what is sometimes the second best burger in NY after Spotted Pig's. The vibe is all varnished wood and high ceilings with a real cozy clubhouse atmosphere. The staff are friendly and knowledgable folks. They change the special house drinks seasonally. Right now they are all Wu Tang themed. After you get used to eating here most other Greenpoint eateries seem bland and unexciting in comparison.Depending on your tastes and whether you get appetizers and drinks expect to spend between 20 and 60 per person.,5.0

"I've decided that this is my favorite restaurant. I like it more than Market Table, ABC Kitchen, Charlie Bird, Rosemary's, more than any other place anywhere. When I went for dinner I had the Pork Chop. I don't even really like Pork Chop and let's just say that I can't wait to have that Pork Chop again. Unbelievable. My friend had the Ravioli, and that too was incredible. I can't wait to try the Chicken, and the Filet.    The other day I went for brunch and that meal sealed the deal on my decision making process of my favorite restaurant.  THE CHICKEN BISCUIT.  THE. CHICKEN. BISCUIT!  THE FRENCH TOAST.  That's life right there. This place is a must try, even if you're three trains away from it like me. Totally worth the trek, the food is outstanding.  Not to mention the staff is great and I love the cozy, unpretentious vibe.",5.0
"THIS IS THE PLACE.Their menu is simple, their ambiance is cozy and their service never fails. They have the cutest little backyard - perfect for the spring and summer months.

And for the food to be good when you get it to go, it has to be good. Also, hosted a little birthday party for a coworker there. It was such a pleasure dealing with their staff, our servers.Portions aren't HUGE but pretty generous - very fitting for their prices.I believe their menus may be seasonal - right now, def recommend the Smoked Turkey Sandwich - it's freaking awesome.

The cocktails are always great and change seasonally. A charm is the delicious piping hot bread they serve which is baked in a terra-cota pot and always brought without asking.They always accommodate us when we bring the baby in the stroller, and for the record I am a conscientious diner and my kid sleeps through meals if he starts making noise I go outside with him.

"Anella definitely caught my attention with its $5 bloody marys -- they're generously sized, very spicy, and a fantastic way to start off brunch. Unfortunately, they were also what kept us from getting hangry, as service was incredibly slow and the food subsequently took awhile to get to us.My croque madame was very good, though I wished they'd cooked the eggs more since they came out on the undercooked side. My partner's pork belly biscuit was also delicious, albeit a bit on the sparse side.Good coffee, very good prices, very meh on the service side. I'm not quite sure that this would be my first pick in the future, but will keep it in mind if we're in the area.",3.0
"I decided to go to Anella's because I heard good things from locals, and my group did enjoy the food itself. Everything tasted pretty good. The service, however, was atrocious. We were sat quickly, and that was the end of the positive service experience. 10 minutes later we didn't even have water or even see a single server. My girlfriend got up and found a waiter to get us water. When the waiter with a dark ponytail and facial hair finally came by to take our order I asked specifically about a $16 entree's portion size. He said it was a ""good portion for one."" I am 6'2"" and was quite hungry. When the food came by my dish was 6 large-ish pieces of Gnocchi filling 1/3rd of a giant bowl. I asked the waitress as she dropped it down: ""Is this the right portion? I ordered the large"" and she said yes. We did not see our waiter for another 15-20 minutes, but since I finished my ""meal"" in 2 minutes, about 10 minutes in my girlfriend had to get up again to flag down a different waitress to ask for water and bread. Her response: ""I can get you water but the kitchen is too busy to serve more bread""Needless to say this was already a bad experience. But the waiter didn't come until long after we were all done with our food (at least 15 minutes after I was done with mine) and asked ""Is everything ok for the check?"" and I stated that I was shocked at how little the portion was. He said ""Well, yeah, that one does come pretty small."" I reminded him that I had asked about the portion beforehand, and how he said it was ok. He said ""Oh yeah I guess I could have been more clear."" I expected him to offer something, even bread, but instead he just said ""Would you like to order more food?"" We obviously said no.The bottom line is, this was a potato and cheese dish that cost $16. A burger was $13 with meat and a healthy portion of fries. They even have the gall to make a $9 option with 3 pieces of gnocchi. This was appetizer portions in the entree section. The food itself was good. But don't expect to be served like it's a restaurant with $16 tiny entrees. Expect 1/5 star service, and 4/5 star food in variable portions (only my food was tiny).",2.0

"I came here a couple of months ago with the BF and a couple of friends. We decided to check it out after reading good reviews about it on Yelp and also since the menu looked pretty good.Since it was still summer time when we had gone, we chose to sit in the backyard. It was nicely decorated and felt very rustic and cozy. Several Yelpers had mentioned this before, and I'll have to mention it as well: the bread is phenomenal. It comes in a little terra cotta flower pot and is served in quarters. We all enjoyed our meals, though I did wish the portions were slightly bigger considering their price. I would like to check this place out for brunch one day and I would love to check it out perhaps during the winter as the menu seems to change seasonly.

"Ok so I've been coming to Anella since it opened what like 2-3 years ago? Every visit has been a 5 star rating, not a single bad bite as other reviewers have posted. This is my go to neighborhood place - no doubt it's been the best food in Greenpoint for years. I bring out-of-towners here first.But I have to tell you about dinner tonight.For my 2nd Father's Day I want something special, so we go here. I spring for the NY strip steak. Wife gets the tagliatelle pasta. So the steak comes - its salty. Like, saltier than your Chinese food take out salty. Wifey agrees. And I *hate* being that guy, but I send it back. I'm like ""I'm really sorry but it's just too salty to eat"". Waiter (Ben, who rendered perfect service throughout) comes back a bit later with this gem:""The chef took a sample and disagrees with the salt level but he'd like to know what you'd like him to do"".This is like saying ""the chef thinks you're crazy and he's sorry but how can he help?"". Well, what a super guy. Maybe this was my Pinot Grigio talking, but I thought that was just the most arrogant thing I'd ever heard in a restaurant as a customer, ever. It totally ruined my special dinner. I was fuming! Yes Ben thank you, I'll take a less salty steak, that'd be great. Meanwhile wifey's pasta is amazing. But I can't get over the a-hole chefs comment. So new steak comes after a reasonable wait: it's raw. Not rare, which I like just fine (I'd ordered medium rare). Purple and red about an inch in the from the edge, totally cool to the touch. Also was devoid of any seasoning whatsoever. This guy had taken it personally and now it was time for fun...Ben checks in ""how is everything""? I just lift the plate ""you tell the chef I said 'Don't cook aaaaangry' which he clearly is. Just take it off the bill and bring the check, please"". Ben saw the problem immediately and was obviously embarrassed. He comped the steak and our app - Salt cod fritters, delicious - as well. We left him 25%. I got to leave feeling all was right with the world. But a little sad I had to write this review after such a long amazing streak at this place.I told Ben I will be back.",3.0

As far as the service I have had good nights and bad nights here, it seems like they get people in rushes and sometimes it harries down the waitstaff.As for the food, most of the time everything is great here, though I have had undercooked eggs on my Benedict before, but we go here a lot so what's an occasional undercooked poached egg right?They will have variations on a steak, roast chicken, a fish, chop and a burger always, but with a seasonal preparation of vegetables. The cocktails are always great and change seasonally. A charm is the delicious piping hot bread they serve which is baked in a terra-cota pot and always brought without asking.They always accommodate us when we bring the baby in the stroller, and for the record I am a conscientious diner and my kid sleeps through meals if he starts making noise I go outside with him. Like many businesses in Greenpoint there is one step up at the entrance.",4.0

"Anella definitely caught my attention with its $5 bloody marys -- they're generously sized, very spicy, and a fantastic way to start off brunch. Unfortunately, they were also what kept us from getting hangry, as service was incredibly slow and the food subsequently took awhile to get to us.My croque madame was very good, though I wished they'd cooked the eggs more since they came out on the undercooked side. My partner's pork belly biscuit was also delicious, albeit a bit on the sparse side.Good coffee, very good prices, very meh on the service side. I'm not quite sure that this would be my first pick in the future, but will keep it in mind if we're in the area.",3.0
"I decided to go to Anella's because I heard good things from locals, and my group did enjoy the food itself. Everything tasted pretty good. The service, however, was atrocious. We were sat quickly, and that was the end of the positive service experience. 10 minutes later we didn't even have water or even see a single server. My girlfriend got up and found a waiter to get us water. When the waiter with a dark ponytail and facial hair finally came by to take our order I asked specifically about a $16 entree's portion size. He said it was a ""good portion for one."" I am 6'2"" and was quite hungry. When the food came by my dish was 6 large-ish pieces of Gnocchi filling 1/3rd of a giant bowl. I asked the waitress as she dropped it down: ""Is this the right portion? I ordered the large"" and she said yes. We did not see our waiter for another 15-20 minutes, but since I finished my ""meal"" in 2 minutes, about 10 minutes in my girlfriend had to get up again to flag down a different waitress to ask for water and bread. Her response: ""I can get you water but the kitchen is too busy to serve more bread""Needless to say this was already a bad experience. But the waiter didn't come until long after we were all done with our food (at least 15 minutes after I was done with mine) and asked ""Is everything ok for the check?"" and I stated that I was shocked at how little the portion was. He said ""Well, yeah, that one does come pretty small."" I reminded him that I had asked about the portion beforehand, and how he said it was ok. He said ""Oh yeah I guess I could have been more clear."" I expected him to offer something, even bread, but instead he just said ""Would you like to order more food?"" We obviously said no.The bottom line is, this was a potato and cheese dish that cost $16. A burger was $13 with meat and a healthy portion of fries. They even have the gall to make a $9 option with 3 pieces of gnocchi. This was appetizer portions in the entree section. The food itself was good. But don't expect to be served like it's a restaurant with $16 tiny entrees. Expect 1/5 star service, and 4/5 star food in variable portions (only my food was tiny).",2.0

"I came here a couple of months ago with the BF and a couple of friends. We decided to check it out after reading good reviews about it on Yelp and also since the menu looked pretty good.Since it was still summer time when we had gone, we chose to sit in the backyard. It was nicely decorated and felt very rustic and cozy. Several Yelpers had mentioned this before, and I'll have to mention it as well: the bread is phenomenal. It comes in a little terra cotta flower pot and is served in quarters. We all enjoyed our meals, though I did wish the portions were slightly bigger considering their price. I would like to check this place out for brunch one day and I would love to check it out perhaps during the winter as the menu seems to change seasonly. Cute restaurant, good service, and very tasty food.",4.0
"Ok so I've been coming to Anella since it opened what like 2-3 years ago? Every visit has been a 5 star rating, not a single bad bite as other reviewers have posted. This is my go to neighborhood place - no doubt it's been the best food in Greenpoint for years. I bring out-of-towners here first.But I have to tell you about dinner tonight.For my 2nd Father's Day I want something special, so we go here. I spring for the NY strip steak. Wife gets the tagliatelle pasta. So the steak comes - its salty. Like, saltier than your Chinese food take out salty. Wifey agrees. And I *hate* being that guy, but I send it back. I'm like ""I'm really sorry but it's just too salty to eat"". Waiter (Ben, who rendered perfect service throughout) comes back a bit later with this gem:""The chef took a sample and disagrees with the salt level but he'd like to know what you'd like him to do"".This is like saying ""the chef thinks you're crazy and he's sorry but how can he help?"". Well, what a super guy. Maybe this was my Pinot Grigio talking, but I thought that was just the most arrogant thing I'd ever heard in a restaurant as a customer, ever. It totally ruined my special dinner. I was fuming! Yes Ben thank you, I'll take a less salty steak, that'd be great. Meanwhile wifey's pasta is amazing. But I can't get over the a-hole chefs comment. So new steak comes after a reasonable wait: it's raw. Not rare, which I like just fine (I'd ordered medium rare). Purple and red about an inch in the from the edge, totally cool to the touch. Also was devoid of any seasoning whatsoever. This guy had taken it personally and now it was time for fun...Ben checks in ""how is everything""? I just lift the plate ""you tell the chef I said 'Don't cook aaaaangry' which he clearly is. Just take it off the bill and bring the check, please"". Ben saw the problem immediately and was obviously embarrassed. He comped the steak and our app - Salt cod fritters, delicious - as well. We left him 25%. I got to leave feeling all was right with the world. But a little sad I had to write this review after such a long amazing streak at this place.I told Ben I will be back.",3.0

"This is the best meal we've had since moving back to New York from Barcelona one year ago. Hands down. And it's surprising; the menu is quite your basic NY charming independently owned neighborhood restaurant fare but where most restaurants try to pass off meals a reasonable cook can pull of at home - and better - they just hit each morsel out of the ballpark. And despite how annoying this may sound, I have to say, having just lived in Paris and Barcelona (facing the Santa Caterina market, the heavenly market of all markets) over the past five years, I've become really easily irritated with bland overpriced food. So this was just an amazing experience for me and for my husband.Bread - is a disgrace most places. An afterthought. They warm it up or warm the butter but the bread is average. At Anella, they bring you a small loaf in a clay pot (like a potted plant) that is absolutely to die for. It either is or is very much like a brioche but I remember a brioche being spongey and not very nice. This was soft and melted in your mouth. They serve it with a garlic or shallot butter, can't remember which. The bread is worth the trip.Bibb Salad - weirdly perfect with dates and crumbled blue cheese, pecans (I think) and a light lemony dressingBurrata Mozzarella - also came with an extraordinarily dressed salad. I actually would rate it OVER the Bibb but that's because I'm not very keen on blue cheeses. (Yes, it was hard in Paris, I stuck with the creamy soft cheeses). And who doesn't like Burrata? (that's why the invented Italy).Hangar Steak - we both ordered this. The meat was so tender, so delicious and for the first time in eons that I've ordered steak in a restaurant, cooked perfectly. It came with a pesto, fingerling potatoes, and (what I think were) chanterelle mushrooms. I know, I know, it sounds so easy to just buy this at the local gourmet shop and I cook. a lot. and cook this very thing often enough, but they just made everything perfectly. It was so delicious. Every bite we idiotically exclaimed how good this was. The waitstaff probably thought we didn't leave the house much.And then dessert was ridiculous. I don't even like dessert but they brought out 2 desserts for our anniversary that were out of this world. (A surprise to us.) One was like a round very very soft cinnamon donut hole of the highest order that you dip in a coffee cream. The other was a little cake that I can't describe but it was caramelly and white chocolatey but not too sweet at all with a nice creamy thing on the site. And they brought it out with candles and a sparkling red wine because it was our wedding anniversary. It was the perfect end to a perfect day.Thanks Anella. We can't wait to try your other 2 restaurants (Calyer and Jimmy's Diner ) asap!The kindness and overall service and attention to detail they showed us was first class. We felt almost sheepish and undeserving by the end. To the staff at Anella, we say thank you for making our anniversary an amazing night. This is real customer service and truly outstanding quality.xoxoxoxoxo",5.0
"Came here for brunch recently. Got here for 11:30 - zero wait time. The menu is small but everything sounds super good, and they usually have one or two specials on the weekends. My egg white frittata with ricotta and squash was great. The bloody mary was actually one of the worst I've ever had - waaaaay too much horseradish. Legit, chunks of it just floating around. The mimosas were great though. My friends (who also got egg dishes) were both happy. I would definitely come back here again, despite the bloody mary miss. And the service was great too, despite one slightly slow transaction which was made up for. :) PS. They have a $19 prix fixe which includes coffee, one drink and one entree.

And despite how annoying this may sound, I have to say, having just lived in Paris and Barcelona (facing the Santa Caterina market, the heavenly market of all markets) over the past five years, I've become really easily irritated with bland overpriced food. So this was just an amazing experience for me and for my husband.Bread - is a disgrace most places. An afterthought. They warm it up or warm the butter but the bread is average. At Anella, they bring you a small loaf in a clay pot (like a potted plant) that is absolutely to die for. It either is or is very much like a brioche but I remember a brioche being spongey and not very nice. This was soft and melted in your mouth. They serve it with a garlic or shallot butter, can't remember which. The bread is worth the trip.Bibb Salad - weirdly perfect with dates and crumbled blue cheese, pecans (I think) and a light lemony dressingBurrata Mozzarella - also came with an extraordinarily dressed salad. I actually would rate it OVER the Bibb but that's because I'm not very keen on blue cheeses. (Yes, it was hard in Paris, I stuck with the creamy soft cheeses). And who doesn't like Burrata? (that's why the invented Italy).Hangar Steak - we both ordered this. The meat was so tender, so delicious and for the first time in eons that I've ordered steak in a restaurant, cooked perfectly. It came with a pesto, fingerling potatoes, and (what I think were) chanterelle mushrooms. I know, I know, it sounds so easy to just buy this at the local gourmet shop and I cook. a lot. and cook this very thing often enough, but they just made everything perfectly. It was so delicious. Every bite we idiotically exclaimed how good this was. The waitstaff probably thought we didn't leave the house much.And then dessert was ridiculous. I don't even like dessert but they brought out 2 desserts for our anniversary that were out of this world. (A surprise to us.) One was like a round very very soft cinnamon donut hole of the highest order that you dip in a coffee cream. The other was a little cake that I can't describe but it was caramelly and white chocolatey but not too sweet at all with a nice creamy thing on the site. And they brought it out with candles and a sparkling red wine because it was our wedding anniversary. It was the perfect end to a perfect day.Thanks Anella. We can't wait to try your other 2 restaurants (Calyer and Jimmy's Diner ) asap!The kindness and overall service and attention to detail they showed us was first class. We felt almost sheepish and undeserving by the end. To the staff at Anella, we say thank you for making our anniversary an amazing night. This is real customer service and truly outstanding quality.xoxoxoxoxo",5.0
"Came here for brunch recently. Got here for 11:30 - zero wait time. The menu is small but everything sounds super good, and they usually have one or two specials on the weekends. My egg white frittata with ricotta and squash was great. The bloody mary was actually one of the worst I've ever had - waaaaay too much horseradish. Legit, chunks of it just floating around. The mimosas were great though. My friends (who also got egg dishes) were both happy. I would definitely come back here again, despite the bloody mary miss. And the service was great too, despite one slightly slow transaction which was made up for. :) PS. They have a $19 prix fixe which includes coffee, one drink and one entree. Entrees mostly run around $11-$12, alcoholic drinks around $7-$8.",4.0
I've been here for brunch and dinner.  Both meals were solid.  Drinks are strong.  Menu is creative and tasty.Never had an issue with service and like the fact that I can stop in without a reservation and not have to wait.They have an outdoor space which is cute when the weather is nice.  Can't find much to complain about this place.  Check it out.,4.0
"I had read rave reviews about this place for ages and finally went for dinner last night.  We had the burrata, the hangar steak with pesto sauce and the carbonara, and everything was definitely decent.  Anella is a cute place with lots of recycled wood surfaces and an extraordinarily standard menu at at reasonable a price point (mains from high teens to mid twenties).  Service is unassuming but good, and the ambiance is warm and intimate.The burrata was good, but I had had some mindblowing stuff at Gjelina in Venice and at Cotagna in SF recently, and Anella's version didn't quite measure up. As for the carbonara, it was much more redolent of leeks than the pancetta, and the pasta was quite thick -- maybe 2-3x width of a standard spaghetti, and it made me long for the orgasmic carbonara at Otto, where the guanciale makes its porky smoky presence known.Anella is a nice neighborhood joint in Greenpoint, and maybe worth swinging by if you lived in the nabe for a meal.  But as folks who trekked across Brooklyn, our dinner was merely pleasant, and at the end of the meal, I really was wishing we were able to get a reservation at Bistro Petit where my last meal was truly extraordinary.",3.0
"I really want to like Anella, and they have some great things going for them - I love the space, the staff are very friendly/helpful, cocktails are interesting and tasty. But the food. It's not bad. It's just not great. And I've eaten here several times; for dinner and for brunch. Every time the food is missing something. I hope they're able to figure it out. I will say this: the bread is really great - both in presentation and taste. But that's not enough to make me come back to eat. Drinks maybe?",3.0
"I live nearby and Anella is hands-down the very best restaurant in the area. I have had consistently good service and excellent food.  I'm a vegetarian and, while they always have at least one vegetarian-friendly dish, they are always willing to make modifications if it doesn't quite suit me. And it is always delicious. I come in sometimes for an early dinner with my boisterous four year old and without fail, the staff has engaged him and entertained him everytime they visit the table.  For a tired mom who just wants to get through a nice meal without her kid blowing up or wanting to leave, that's huge. And many have spoken here of the flowerpot bread that comes with salted butter but let me also say - it is to die for.  My son usually eats the entire thing.  I also highly recommend the burrata appetizer- right now it comes with beets and oranges but they change it up a lot. All in all, a true neighborhood gem.",5.0
"Since I wrote my last review a year ago my boyfriend & I have been back for brunch and dinner a number of times. We love it here.

I recommend it to everyone, so if you're in the area make sure to go.",5.0
"Went on a Saturday night and had to wait for 10 minutes for a seat outside. But we sat at the bar. There was a great selection of wine and beer. They had my favorite, Tempranillo, which always warms my heart. They set you up with a flower pot of bread and a little bit of butter. Both were warm and amazing. We got the sunchoke soup and the calamaris as appetizers. After that and the bread, we regreted getting entrees, we were SOOO full. The waiter vastly underestimated the size of the appetizers. The calamari was actually in a pot and I would have considered it entree size, if you considered the flower pot of bread as well. I got the pork cheek taga...something (a pasta). It was fantastic.  My boyfriend got the burger, which he said wasn't super memorable, but wasn't bad. We had to sit for about an hour in order to fit some of the food into our bursting stomachs. I was disappointed I was so full because I wanted to try the desserts which sounded great. But we decided on a cocktail instead. Boyfriend got the mule, which has Great, Bursting flavors of ginger. If you don't like ginger, don't get this. But we do! I got the ""ginza"", which tasted like a lovely fruity iced tea! Probably the best cocktails I have had in awhile. Comfort food! Fast! and quiet! I will go back.",4.0
"I would kick you in the head for this french toast. I'm really appreciative of the ""crispy-coated"" genre of french toast, so this version pleased me immensely. I'm also very appreciative of the ""more than enough food to make me fat/sleepy/diabetic"" genre of french toast, so they've got my heart on that front as well. With roasted strawberries? SHUT THE HELL UP.Service is kind of bored and wandering, or maybe I'm just not cool enough to know that bringing people more coffee or cream quickly is ""so 2006"" or something. In fact, my only complaint is about the clientele, but that has more to do with my lack of understanding as to why people insist on carting their children to non-romper-room restaurants, when everyone knows that children's tiny hands make them excellent coal miners, and they should be working in a coal mine when I'm having brunch, not taking up 80 square feet with their tanker truck of a stroller or tripping the waitstaff with their ""cute antics.""What was I saying? French toast for the win.",4.0
Dinner began with a playful twist from the chef that will bring you back here again and again. The bread is baked & served in clay flowerpots.  It was delicious and sliced just so it looks like leaves of a plant.  The rest of the meal was not as quirky and I'm glad because this food is seriously  amazing. The octopus was so tender and perfect.  The chicken was beautiful.  The  bronzino had skin so crisp that it didn't need more than the couscous beneath to complete it.  Anyone who has reviewed this place and didn't like it because of an attitude...maybe you should have checked yours at the door.  Our server was polite attentive and pleasant.Dessert well...I could have skipped the olive oil cake...it wasn't terrible but just not as good as the rest of the meal.,5.0

"Really fantastic dinner on a Saturday evening. I had two appetizers as my main: a grilled baby octopus with chickpeas and hummus, chorizo, and salsa verde, as well as a grilled radicchio with anchovy dressing, mint, and thinly sliced cheese. The octopus was grilled perfectly, crispy and not chewy in the slightest, and paired very nicely with the textures of the verde and bean puree. The radicchio was even more delicious than i was expecting; perfectly salty, soft, and crispy all at the same time. All of my friend's dishes looked equally as good (they ordered some of the handmade pastas). The cocktail list was inventive without being uninviting and the wine list offered up some great selections. Also, I didn't eat it, but the bread came in a little clay flower pot in which it was baked. That's right, home baked bread and soft salted butter. My friends were all very impressed and it smelled delicious.The only minus was that the environment was really empty and the staff could be a bit more attentive.I will absolutely be coming back.",4.0

Bartender was seriously multitasking while chatting with patrons - I can't blame him for that but his first priority should be filling orders. But again - it's a busy night. At least our drinks order wasn't forgotten. And he delivered them with a friendly cool attitude. DINNER - A mix of apps and entrees. The homemade cheese is amazingly beautiful. The calamari is great but not great for sharing. On its own its wonderful but you need to hog it for yourself to really appreciate it (not saucy). The whole bronzino (my entree) was standard for New York  (which means damn good i guess). My girlfriend's gnocci - i think pumpin - was --- I guess I'm supposed to use the word ""sublime""...

I had the vegetable hash and it was delicious.  Lots of fresh veggies,  hash browns topped with 2 poached eggs.  My friend got the special: eggs, pork belly and roasted cauliflower and broccoli.

"My husband and I went to Anella for dinner after having drinks with a group at t.b.d. next door.  We were walk-ins and the staff were really gracious, seating us after 10-15 minutes, which we spent at the bar having a great cocktail.Dinner was excellent, both the service and food.  I had the beet tart and my husband has a special that consisted of a poached egg, chicken skin, and cauliflower.  His description?  ""This is like food crack.""  A great start to the meal.  For our main courses I had a sea bass special that was delicious and seasonal.  They got the crispy skin on the fish just right and the juicy simplicity of tangerines and fennel were perfect in the accompanying salad.  My husband for the chicken and he definitely picked the winning dish - crazy juicy, flavorful, and just overall a delicious dish, especially with the seasonal ramps.  Anella is the perfect mix of sophisticated, but not pretentious American food in a laid-back elegant (but not stuffy) physical space.  We will definitely be back.",4.0
"This is my third review on yelp and though I have never wrote a bad review before I have to say this one is simply for the service here ... My friends got to the restaurant around 1:20 pm we were meeting for brunch as I was recommended to come here because the food was to die for , we arrived 10 mins after them and while they were waiting they kept getting asked 'where the rest of their party was ?' When we arrived we were seated right away at a table near the door which was a bit drafty and no one came back for us until another 10-15 mins later we put our drinks in first because the man said out waitress would come to take our food order .... We ordered two mimosas and two cocktails literally waited 25-30 just for our drinks ! The waitress said there was a drink shortage behind the bar of bloody Mary's even tho we didn't order them ??....Then finally  they took our order for the food which now I can understand why it had been recommended the French toast was to die for ! We had ordered that as an appetizer which was good for four ppl and than we put in a second drink order which we figured we wouldn't get until the rest of our brunch came and shocker I was right ! I mean I get that they're busy and it's a Sunday very small space with ton of hungry ppl filling in but , to have one waitress running around taking everyone's order and serving is ridiculous .. I felt really bad but they don't come to check on u like the previous reviews have said until ur meal is completely finished ! I swear my friend said it ...they fastest thing they brought us was the check !! To get that next party in , not sure if well be back in the future ... 3 stars for food ... But 2 for service .. Oh and they did comp out second round of drinks so that was cool .",3.0

"Found Anella from the reviews on Yelp and we were blown away.  We were expecting good, we got great.  The Greenpoint cocktail is a wicked wicked beast of a drink. Potent, strong, wonderfully balanced flavors. I would go back for that alone.The Sunchoke salad was great, as was the fried artichoke salad.  The crostini were certainly good, but I was hoping for a bit more from that dish. The Pork Chop & Belly was rediculous.  If you could manage to incorporate all of the components into one bite, it was a wonderful sensation. The Mackerel was light and wonderfully complimented by the roasted brussel sprouts in the mix of salad greens.  The duck was a complete other flavor profile and was equally as good as the other two dishes.The home made bread in the flower pot is just the right amount of kitsch. The bread inside the pot is impossible to describe accurately. Light, fluffy, doughy, crisp, warm. We had three servings throughout the meal.Desert was ridiculous. Caramel tart with salted caramel ice cream? Oh yes.  And a cute take on bread pudding with vanilla ice cream and cherries... and the olive oil cake is fluffy and moist and the candied lemon and orange was a sweet treat.Go, you'll love it.",5.0
"Italian food?  You wouldn't know that from their brunch menu.  Which is fairly limited, but everything we had was really, really good.I was sad to discover that Queens Hideway is gone!  But they remodeled, expanded, and made the inside way prettier, so that's nice.  The brunch menu is small and kind of standard, but really fresh, quality ingredients.  I tried the ham and egg biscuit, which was great, and the BLT, which was also great.  Heavy, greasy, fatty farm-fresh goodness.I sort of hate places where you can't just get a cup of coffee, though.  You get an Americano, and then if you want a refill, you have to purchase another one, so before you know it you've spent $6 on coffee.  Kind of annoying.  And they didn't have skim milk or Splenda, which is a big problem for me.The service was AWFUL.  For no reason.  She was just painfully slow.  I know she was the only one working but it wasn't at all busy!  That being said, it's nice to walk into a restaurant at peak brunch time and snag a table in the back garden.  But - we waited for eons during every stage of the meal, and literally had to flag her down for everything.  Minus one star for bad service, I'm afraid.  But I'd love to go back and try the dinner menu (and the dinner staff!)",3.0
"I've only been here for brunch, but boy, was it is brunch to remember. My roommate has the eggs benedict, and I had the egg biscuit meal. Both were extremely fresh, full of flavor, and good-sized portions. We also split some of the side dishes which were equally pleasing. Who knew I loved brussel sprouts? Apparently the chef at Anella. Their use of local, fresh veggies is awesome. The decor is really cute and the atmosphere was laid back. The waitress was really attentive, and they didn't rush us out.

"Delightful. Anella achieves that rare restaurant feat when you realize some time during that meal that, yes, everything is as it should be and everything is good. It's style, which in many ways echoes the vibe out on Franklin: the few but rich selections on the menu, the lack of pretension among staff and clientele, the wine (even the cheapest white was praiseworthy), the house-baked bread in the flower pot, the terrace in the back and its garden, the unexpected joys of things like fennel or white chocolate with strawberries. For the record, we had dinner here and tried the steak tartar, bucatini with clams, potato-crusted cod, and white chocolate dessert, and that's only scratching the surface.

"I've only been here for brunch, but man, I can't wait to come back for dinner. Their food is mouth-watering delicious, in that amazingly fresh and minimal way. I can vouch for both the Eggs Benedict and the BLT, as well as the crispy side potatoes (seriously...they're amazing).

"Boyfriend and I dropped in this evening for dinner.  We were seated promptly and had a lovely meal composed of the following:-Bread in a pot  Does it have crack in it?  Maybe.  After we finished the bread, I just wanted more. Definitely a great way to start off a meal.  -Asparagus Terrine (special)I was not expecting this to be so delicious.  We absolutely loved it.  Asparagus terrine... who knew?-ScallopsBoyfriend ordered this.  I got one bite of it because he wouldn't give it up.-GnocchiI've eaten a lot of gnocchi in my life.  Look at my face, do I look like I've ever passed on a bowl of gnocchi?  It was sublime.  I'm still thinking about it.  Drooling on my plate.-Chocolate Bread PuddingSoft and gooey.  Yum.Boyfriend enjoyed his cocktail.  Service was good.  Perfect for a romantic date.  Definitely going back.",4.0
"I just went here for the 1st time.  After a 20min wait the friendly waitress gave Us a complimentary appetizer of really good parsnip/carrot/tangerine salad, and we went on to enjoy their delicious Terra cotta planter baked bread.  The food here is superb, I got the duck and my date got the homemade pasta special. Both were worthy of savoring every bite.  They also have a great craft beer selection, by the way. The music was well selected but not too Loud to make a conversation difficult.  Nice decor too, i like the wood bar and exposed walls. What are you waiting for?",5.0
"My husband and I went to Anella for dinner after having drinks with a group at t.b.d. next door.  We were walk-ins and the staff were really gracious, seating us after 10-15 minutes, which we spent at the bar having a great cocktail.Dinner was excellent, both the service and food.  I had the beet tart and my husband has a special that consisted of a poached egg, chicken skin, and cauliflower.  His description?  ""This is like food crack.""  A great start to the meal.  For our main courses I had a sea bass special that was delicious and seasonal.  They got the crispy skin on the fish just right and the juicy simplicity of tangerines and fennel were perfect in the accompanying salad.  My husband for the chicken and he definitely picked the winning dish - crazy juicy, flavorful, and just overall a delicious dish, especially with the seasonal ramps.  Anella is the perfect mix of sophisticated, but not pretentious American food in a laid-back elegant (but not stuffy) physical space.  We will definitely be back.",4.0
"This is my third review on yelp and though I have never wrote a bad review before I have to say this one is simply for the service here ... My friends got to the restaurant around 1:20 pm we were meeting for brunch as I was recommended to come here because the food was to die for , we arrived 10 mins after them and while they were waiting they kept getting asked 'where the rest of their party was ?' When we arrived we were seated right away at a table near the door which was a bit drafty and no one came back for us until another 10-15 mins later we put our drinks in first because the man said out waitress would come to take our food order .... We ordered two mimosas and two cocktails literally waited 25-30 just for our drinks ! The waitress said there was a drink shortage behind the bar of bloody Mary's even tho we didn't order them ??....Then finally  they took our order for the food which now I can understand why it had been recommended the French toast was to die for ! We had ordered that as an appetizer which was good for four ppl and than we put in a second drink order which we figured we wouldn't get until the rest of our brunch came and shocker I was right ! I mean I get that they're busy and it's a Sunday very small space with ton of hungry ppl filling in but , to have one waitress running around taking everyone's order and serving is ridiculous .. I felt really bad but they don't come to check on u like the previous reviews have said until ur meal is completely finished ! I swear my friend said it ...they fastest thing they brought us was the check !! To get that next party in , not sure if well be back in the future ... 3 stars for food ... But 2 for service .. Oh and they did comp out second round of drinks so that was cool .",3.0
"I went here yesterday with my husband for dinner.It was great!! Service is excellent , food was great and atmosphere was great love the garden. The reason for 4 stars is not much variety on the small menu. I would defiantly go back.",4.0
"Found Anella from the reviews on Yelp and we were blown away.  We were expecting good, we got great.  The Greenpoint cocktail is a wicked wicked beast of a drink. Potent, strong, wonderfully balanced flavors. I would go back for that alone.The Sunchoke salad was great, as was the fried artichoke salad.  The crostini were certainly good, but I was hoping for a bit more from that dish. The Pork Chop & Belly was rediculous.  If you could manage to incorporate all of the components into one bite, it was a wonderful sensation. The Mackerel was light and wonderfully complimented by the roasted brussel sprouts in the mix of salad greens.  The duck was a complete other flavor profile and was equally as good as the other two dishes.The home made bread in the flower pot is just the right amount of kitsch. The bread inside the pot is impossible to describe accurately. Light, fluffy, doughy, crisp, warm. We had three servings throughout the meal.Desert was ridiculous. Caramel tart with salted caramel ice cream? Oh yes.  And a cute take on bread pudding with vanilla ice cream and cherries... and the olive oil cake is fluffy and moist and the candied lemon and orange was a sweet treat.Go, you'll love it.",5.0
"Italian food?  You wouldn't know that from their brunch menu.  Which is fairly limited, but everything we had was really, really good.I was sad to discover that Queens Hideway is gone!  But they remodeled, expanded, and made the inside way prettier, so that's nice.  The brunch menu is small and kind of standard, but really fresh, quality ingredients.  I tried the ham and egg biscuit, which was great, and the BLT, which was also great.  Heavy, greasy, fatty farm-fresh goodness.I sort of hate places where you can't just get a cup of coffee, though.  You get an Americano, and then if you want a refill, you have to purchase another one, so before you know it you've spent $6 on coffee.  Kind of annoying.  And they didn't have skim milk or Splenda, which is a big problem for me.The service was AWFUL.  For no reason.  She was just painfully slow.  I know she was the only one working but it wasn't at all busy!  That being said, it's nice to walk into a restaurant at peak brunch time and snag a table in the back garden.  But - we waited for eons during every stage of the meal, and literally had to flag her down for everything.  Minus one star for bad service, I'm afraid.  But I'd love to go back and try the dinner menu (and the dinner staff!)",3.0
"I've only been here for brunch, but boy, was it is brunch to remember. My roommate has the eggs benedict, and I had the egg biscuit meal. Both were extremely fresh, full of flavor, and good-sized portions. We also split some of the side dishes which were equally pleasing. Who knew I loved brussel sprouts? Apparently the chef at Anella. Their use of local, fresh veggies is awesome. The decor is really cute and the atmosphere was laid back. The waitress was really attentive, and they didn't rush us out.

"After our dinner experience at Anella, there is a good chance that we will never go back.  Restaurants have ""off"" nights, but having everything ""off"" at the same time completely inexcusable.  I am not a person who gives low ratings, but I wanted to share my thoughts.  The breakdown is below.The FoodAs we were starving, we ordered a Fritto Misto with our drinks so that we could get a coating in our bellies.  Fortunately, the bread arrived (in a flower pot) to sate the hunger.  Unfortunately, there was very little ""meat"" to the bread.  It was mostly crunchy, seemingly stale crust.  The butter was rich and delicious, but the idea was to put a little butter on my bread rather than coat the bread with butter to make it edible.  When the Fritto Misto arrived, it looked delicious.  As I sunk my teeth into the first piping hot bite, I was let down to find an overly doughy coating hiding the flavor of the main attraction inside.  I am no Fritto Misto expert, but I have always experienced a light, crunchy exterior that enhances the flavor of whatever is inside.  What we got was reminiscent of fried food from a Fair.  No big deal, that was just appetizer 1.Next we ordered seared mackerel over couscous.  This one turned out quite well.  The fishy mackerel was complemented by the gigantic semolina (we will assume they were semolina) pearls.  The red peppers were quite hot, so those who are not into spicy food might want to avoid this dish.  The skin was left on the fish to create a bit of a crust.  While a crispy skin could be delicious, the flavor is overwhelming (and not pleasing) on such a potent fish.  However, things were shaping up, so we were really excited for what would come next....Over an hour later, nothing arrived (more on this later).  When our cicatelli with baby octopus and mussels showed up, we could not wait to dig in.  The experience left us in utter dismay.  The mussels had soured.  Growing up by the coast, I have been eating mussels all of my life, and I have never smelled mussels like this in a dining establishment.  I chalked it up to craziness and decided to look further; the crustaceans were actually stuck to both sides of the shell and were literally ripped apart in the crock.  Again, assuming I was crazy, I decided to try one.  Bad move.  Well, again, I thought maybe a little of the sauce would cure any flavor woes.  Alas, there was nothing in the bottom of the pot.  Ugh.  We sent the mussels back to avoid being sick.  We might have ordered something else, but by this time we had already tasted the cicatelli.  The baby octopus tasted fine (nothing outstanding, but cooked to a good texture, so that there was no chewiness) and went well enough with the pasta.  However, the pasta was so under-cooked that it would not be worth eating, had we not been waiting over an hour for the food....The ServiceWe arrived at a busy time, and waited until two seats opened at the bar (the wait for a table was too long for our level of hunger).  We had a bit of a wait to get our drinks, but, as I mentioned, it was busy.  The bartender was very pleasant and took our drink order and first appetizer order right away.  After some serious attempts to get her attention again, she took our food order.  It's busy, and I am completely sympathetic to the struggles of trying to keep all of the patrons happy at the same time...no big deal.  The problem was that after a healthy wait for the Fritto Misto and the mackerel, nothing else arrived.  We ordered more drinks, the bartender suggested that the food would be right out, and nothing.  After sitting for an hour and a half, we finally inquired about the whereabouts of our dinner.  When the bartender went to check, it seems that our ticket was lost (presumably, someone else got our food).  There was no apology or explanation, and I only knew what happened because I could see the kitchen from my seat.  Not cool.Okay, so when the food arrived and we sent the mussels back, a waiter came over to ask if we wanted something else.  We declined and explained that there had been a long wait.  The waiter acknowledged our wait, but offered no apology.  A simple, ""I am so sorry for your experience"" would have been really nice at this point.  But, not this time.Where does that leave us?  I am very forgiving of long waits and poor service.  We are all human, and people have bad days.  But, I am going out to experience delicious food.  When someone messes up almost every part of my meal, I am not so forgiving.  I am sorry, Anella.  I wanted to love you, but you are just not the right one for me.",1.0

"The service was perfection; although a bottle of water was placed on the table, my glass was never less than 1/3 full before it was filled for me. This attention to detail remained consistent throughout the meal, and the food was exemplary. The freshness of the house-grown herbs really stood out, and only highlighted how perfectly everything was cooked.  For appetizer, we got the fried calamari, which, given it's popularity as an appetizer, was anything but ordinary.  Perfectly battered and fried so that it wasn't even greasy, the anchovy mayonnaise dip was an impeccable accompaniment. The pork cassoulet entree was delicous, with all the flavors of beans, kale, pork and bacon complementing each other without any element overpowering.  The beef short ribs were standout; served boneless, the meat fell to pieces the moment the fork touched it, and the potato and cabbage were the perfect sides. Lastly, for dessert we tried the flourless almond cake, with a poached pear filling.  This was better than any 5-star apple pie, and served in it's own baking dish, fresh from the oven.All this perfection plus a glass of my favorite (and rarely served) Gruner Veltliner came to a mere $70.  fantastic!",5.0

"3.5I had been wanting to go to Anella for quite some time so when a my boyfriend's birthday presented itself we rushed ourselves and friends to this warm little Italian restaurant. We were a little surprised at how adamant the staff was about not seating us until our whole party was there, but it worked out as our friend was a mere three minutes behind us (one of the perks of almost all your friends living in the same hood). While waiting we ordered a couple beers for the boys, and a Dark and  Handsome for myself. A Dark and Handsome (aw yeah) tastes just as good as the name sounds. Fresh ginger, dark rum, and a splash of Prosecco make Briana a happy, happy lady. Upon being seated in a cozy back corner, we pored over the delectable sounding menu, and found it hard to choose. The risotto with wild mushrooms and ""crispy prosciutto"" and a poached egg caught my eye, and was about $5.00 less than other entrees. I went for it. My friends ordered the cod in potato cream (not entirely sure of other components besides a leek), the wild alaskan salmon (a nice piece of sockeye, and the pork chop. Oh, disappointment. I am not usually one to order something sub par, but damn. This was pretty much bad. The risotto lacked flavor, the prosciutto was in no way crispy, and the poached egg merely added to the gooey blandness. I know risotto is gooey, but come on. I want it to taste like something! I shouldn't have to fill my mouth with wild mushroom bits to get a flavor fix. Poo. I have been forgiving because everyone else truly loved their dishes.

"3.5I had been wanting to go to Anella for quite some time so when a my boyfriend's birthday presented itself we rushed ourselves and friends to this warm little Italian restaurant. We were a little surprised at how adamant the staff was about not seating us until our whole party was there, but it worked out as our friend was a mere three minutes behind us (one of the perks of almost all your friends living in the same hood). While waiting we ordered a couple beers for the boys, and a Dark and  Handsome for myself. A Dark and Handsome (aw yeah) tastes just as good as the name sounds. Fresh ginger, dark rum, and a splash of Prosecco make Briana a happy, happy lady. Upon being seated in a cozy back corner, we pored over the delectable sounding menu, and found it hard to choose. The risotto with wild mushrooms and ""crispy prosciutto"" and a poached egg caught my eye, and was about $5.00 less than other entrees. I went for it. My friends ordered the cod in potato cream (not entirely sure of other components besides a leek), the wild alaskan salmon (a nice piece of sockeye, and the pork chop. Oh, disappointment. I am not usually one to order something sub par, but damn. This was pretty much bad. The risotto lacked flavor, the prosciutto was in no way crispy, and the poached egg merely added to the gooey blandness. I know risotto is gooey, but come on. I want it to taste like something! I shouldn't have to fill my mouth with wild mushroom bits to get a flavor fix. Poo. I have been forgiving because everyone else truly loved their dishes. I'm not really a fan of cod (I find it to be flat out boring), but the presentation was lovely, the fish was cooked perfectly, and the sauce was delicious.

In a neighborhood where image/vibe are key, Anella is fighting for both. Suggestion: 1. Take down the ""Roman"" friezes in the dining room. They're a misguided addition - too clean and polished for the otherwise rustic decor.2. When really good music is playing please don't swap it out for cheesy easy listening radio - that was a huge disappointment.We ended up here one Sunday afternoon because Greenpoint Coffee House was bursting at the seams and I just wasn't up to the loud echo of Brooklyn Label.I like Anella, I want it to succeed. The food is good - not enough vegetarian options. Being Italian, I know, there are tons of authentic Italian dishes that don't include cheese or meat.

"Anella is a beautiful restaurant with great food. We love it there. In the warm months they have a nice patio. I've particularly enjoyed their fish sandwich and burger there. Prices are reasonable. Service is pretty good. My girlfriend is a little sensitive and she got their french toast which was ridiculously rich, like soaked in eight eggs and three pounds of butter and sugar rich, and I tasted it and it did indeed taste like a wet cinnabon. It was too much. But that said, it was still frigging tasty if heavy and sweet. She was nauseous afterward but honestly the girl gets nauseous after drinking a normal cup of tea so take that with a grain of salt.I sound like I'm saying we didn't have a good time but we really do like Anella and will be back. They take credit cards now which I dont think they did in the past, and even though our food was delayed (by some kind of kitchen hijinx I'm sure, I am imagining a knife throwing competition where the chefs tried to reproduce that scene in 1992's the Bodyguard where Kevin Costner starts out crappy throwing knives but then starts throwing head shot after motherf$#king headshot and you're like this dude is kind of a  badass). Tangent. Sorry. Point of the story is after 30 minutes our waitress apologized to us and gave us their $7 basket of baked goods for free. I'd never had a straight up right out of the oven chocolate croissant but it was stellar. Our food came shortly after. My biscuits and gravy were decent, nothing wrong with them, but unfortunately I've had that dish at another restaurant which makes all biscuits and gravy pale in comparison (perhaps I should turn to that review next). It can be a little too hip for us. One time outside on the patio we counted four newsboy caps and three pairs of suspenders on patrons, and countless mustaches.

"OK let me start by saying that I am from Napa and a total food snob (but in a good way ;) . I grew up with the best of the best, so I know good food! And this was GOOD.Went here for dinner last night, and had a great date :) Octopus appetizer was perfect, the Buccatini amazing, super tasty.. Halibut cooked to perfection and flavorful as ever. All the flavors combined perfectly in every dish, and I must mention the bread- home baked, warm and delicious. Perfect for sopping up the last bit of sauce on our plates. The decor was homey and unpretentious, the server attentive and super nice. Over all GREAT experience. I cant wait to come back and try the cocktails and brunch. I am so happy to have found such an awesome restaurant in my hood. OH and the doughnuts... how could I forget!! SO good!!!",5.0

"2.5 - but that wasn't an optionThe service was very good. Sad to see it so empty. The food is flavorful, a lovely open kitchen, and a chef that seems to really care about the diner's experience. In a neighborhood where image/vibe are key, Anella is fighting for both. Suggestion: 1. Take down the ""Roman"" friezes in the dining room. They're a misguided addition - too clean and polished for the otherwise rustic decor.2. When really good music is playing please don't swap it out for cheesy easy listening radio - that was a huge disappointment.We ended up here one Sunday afternoon because Greenpoint Coffee House was bursting at the seams and I just wasn't up to the loud echo of Brooklyn Label.I like Anella, I want it to succeed. The food is good - not enough vegetarian options. Being Italian, I know, there are tons of authentic Italian dishes that don't include cheese or meat. All the restaurants in the neighborhood offer vegetarian options for a reason - there is a critical mass who wants the option.",3.0
ok so we came here with high expectations given all the awesome yelp reviews especially about the french toast and for me it was a disaster..the french toast was completely drenched in a sauce making it very very... extremely .. soggy!! & I hate soggy bread! yuckyyy!! ..But if your into sogginess then this is your go to brunch french toast!?!?! =/  ummm so why three stars?? because our waitress was soo nice!! & my husband really enjoyed his eggs benedict =D ...sooo I haven't banned this place forever..i'll just stay away from the french toast =(,3.0

"Anella is a beautiful restaurant with great food. We love it there. In the warm months they have a nice patio. I've particularly enjoyed their fish sandwich and burger there. Prices are reasonable. Service is pretty good. My girlfriend is a little sensitive and she got their french toast which was ridiculously rich, like soaked in eight eggs and three pounds of butter and sugar rich, and I tasted it and it did indeed taste like a wet cinnabon. It was too much. But that said, it was still frigging tasty if heavy and sweet. She was nauseous afterward but honestly the girl gets nauseous after drinking a normal cup of tea so take that with a grain of salt.I sound like I'm saying we didn't have a good time but we really do like Anella and will be back. They take credit cards now which I dont think they did in the past, and even though our food was delayed (by some kind of kitchen hijinx I'm sure, I am imagining a knife throwing competition where the chefs tried to reproduce that scene in 1992's the Bodyguard where Kevin Costner starts out crappy throwing knives but then starts throwing head shot after motherf$#king headshot and you're like this dude is kind of a  badass). Tangent. Sorry. Point of the story is after 30 minutes our waitress apologized to us and gave us their $7 basket of baked goods for free. I'd never had a straight up right out of the oven chocolate croissant but it was stellar. Our food came shortly after. My biscuits and gravy were decent, nothing wrong with them, but unfortunately I've had that dish at another restaurant which makes all biscuits and gravy pale in comparison (perhaps I should turn to that review next). It can be a little too hip for us. One time outside on the patio we counted four newsboy caps and three pairs of suspenders on patrons, and countless mustaches. But the laugh was worth it, I think.",5.0

"Since my first experience dining at Anella, last summer, it has been a mainstay in my dining rotation. The food is always outstanding, the ambiance hip yet welcoming, and the waitstaff is always phenomenal. I tend to be a bit of a bar dweller and have always had a pleasurable experience dining at the bar-which is rustic and charming. The signature cocktails are creative and unique to Anella. My favorite cocktail off the menu is The Franklin which is a bourbon based drink with apple bitters and maple. I am also partial to the Old Square which is also a bourbon based drink with Cognac, sweet vermouth, and Benedictine. I have tried most (if not all) of the drinks on the cocktail menu and all are well thought out, perfectly balanced, and delicious. More standard cocktails (such as Manhattans, Martinis, and Gimlets) have all been palate pleasers as well. On occasion the bartenders are inclined to share new cocktails they are working on and welcoming of thoughts and opinions-which I find really engaging and a fun addition to the dining experience. The staff is very knowledgable and always willing to offer their expertise  on the more unique ingredients and liquors used throughout the process of cocktail crafting. They are more than happy to let you taste anything you find intriguing. Recently Anella expanded their hours offering a late night food menu (they are now open until 1am!). The vibe at night is fun and the bar menu is stellar. Anella is a wonderful place to wind down after a full day. The music is upbeat, eclectic, and, often, nostalgic. The mix is obviously a collaborative effort of many music enthusiasts (whom, I am assuming, are also members of the staff). The last time I dined late the mix was mostly 90's hip hop and everyone was into it. The vibe is low key but incredibly fun. As for the food, it never disappoints. I highly recommend starting with the Homemade Burarrata which is perfectly rich and a little salty. The texture is incredible and it is accented with young beets and pistachio. Also, the Grilled Radicchio should not be missed. The charred and bitter flavor of the radicchio is accentuated by a rich and buttery anchovy dressing (fear not, it is not fishy in the least!). The Butternut Squash Soup with toasted faro and sage is also very tasty. As for pasta, the Ricotta Gnocchi is to die for. It has the melt-in-your-mouth consistency that comprises everything a good gnocchi should be. I also love the Steamed Mussels with white wine and Chorizo. I have had them a few times now and they are always very fresh. Be sure to ask for extra bread to soak up the extra broth-it's TOO good. I really love a good glass of wine with dinner and the Anella wine menu is great. The bartenders are very knowledgeable of wine and wine pairings and are always willing to consult and offer tastes. The last time I was there a new Montepulciano had recently been added to the menu and it is divine. It is moderately acidic with notes of dark fruits and a delightfully long finish. I enjoyed sipping it on it's own. As for the late night menu, get the Fried Mozzarella. It is the same mozzarella used for the Burrata only battered and fried served with home made marinara. For $6 it is a steal. The French Fries are also really good. Time spent at Anella has always been time well spent. Sometimes I bring a few pals. Sometimes I bring a book. The atmosphere is hip yet unpretentious which is conducive to taking time to relax and enjoy a good meal in the company of a very agreeable staff. I highly recommend the late night happy hour and look forward to spending more time exploring the late night menu.",5.0
"Great little place. Went there for brunch, expecting in the back of my mind to pay a lot for very little. I now stand corrected. Our waitstaff was very efficient and friendly, and the menu was both reasonable and well thought out. After ordering our meals (Prosciutto and Poached Egg Bruschetta , and Bacon and Cheese Frittata), our waiter came over with an ""offering from the chef"" of two cherry scones, which were delicious, with excellent seasonal cherries and powdered sugar. This stands as the first scone I have ever actually enjoyed, and not just endured, which I find to be a noteworthy feat in and of itself. I'm not sure if this is standard practice, or was just because I was with an attractive woman, but either way, a big plus. Our meals come quickly and were even better than I expected. The eggs were well cooked, the bacon fresh, and the potatoes were seasoned perfectly, with just the right amount of oil, something that seems to elude 99.999% of chefs. The greens on the side (cheerfully boasted as local rooftop grown produce) were fresh and dressed with a very light oil based dressing that complimented the natural flavor nicely. Our drinks (grapefruit and lemonade concoctions that I forget the exact makeup of) were both well considered and delicious. All of this was enhanced by the very relaxing backyard garden dining area, which is shaded enough to not worry about being burnt in the sun, but open enough to allow you to feel as though you are actually outside. The meal and beverages came to under $40 for two people, which is entirely reasonable, especially for the quality of the food, and the waitstaff. I'm excited to go back and try the diner menu. If brunch is any indication, I expect it to be better than average in every respect.",4.0
"Anella has a nice atmosphere and I admittedly went here on their opening night so I'm sure they have some kinks to work out still. I will give them a second chance for sure. But for now... I got the salmon which was really delicious, but if you get a $12-$16 entree, you are told that it doesn't come with a side. The sides are $5 extra. My friend pointed out that this would be fine if the sides were served family style so everyone can try, but I just felt as though I wasn't getting enough food for what I was paying. The incessant water-refilling was driving me nuts and interfering with conversation. The desserts were really great. When they get their liquor license this may be a go to place for a glass of wine and dessert.",2.0

I enjoyed sipping it on it's own. As for the late night menu, get the Fried Mozzarella. It is the same mozzarella used for the Burrata only battered and fried served with home made marinara. For $6 it is a steal. The French Fries are also really good. Time spent at Anella has always been time well spent. Sometimes I bring a few pals. Sometimes I bring a book. The atmosphere is hip yet unpretentious which is conducive to taking time to relax and enjoy a good meal in the company of a very agreeable staff. I highly recommend the late night happy hour and look forward to spending more time exploring the late night menu.",5.0
"Great little place. Went there for brunch, expecting in the back of my mind to pay a lot for very little. I now stand corrected. Our waitstaff was very efficient and friendly, and the menu was both reasonable and well thought out. After ordering our meals (Prosciutto and Poached Egg Bruschetta , and Bacon and Cheese Frittata), our waiter came over with an ""offering from the chef"" of two cherry scones, which were delicious, with excellent seasonal cherries and powdered sugar. This stands as the first scone I have ever actually enjoyed, and not just endured, which I find to be a noteworthy feat in and of itself. I'm not sure if this is standard practice, or was just because I was with an attractive woman, but either way, a big plus. Our meals come quickly and were even better than I expected. The eggs were well cooked, the bacon fresh, and the potatoes were seasoned perfectly, with just the right amount of oil, something that seems to elude 99.999% of chefs. The greens on the side (cheerfully boasted as local rooftop grown produce) were fresh and dressed with a very light oil based dressing that complimented the natural flavor nicely. Our drinks (grapefruit and lemonade concoctions that I forget the exact makeup of) were both well considered and delicious. All of this was enhanced by the very relaxing backyard garden dining area, which is shaded enough to not worry about being burnt in the sun, but open enough to allow you to feel as though you are actually outside. The meal and beverages came to under $40 for two people, which is entirely reasonable, especially for the quality of the food, and the waitstaff. I'm excited to go back and try the diner menu. If brunch is any indication, I expect it to be better than average in every respect.",4.0
"Anella has a nice atmosphere and I admittedly went here on their opening night so I'm sure they have some kinks to work out still. I will give them a second chance for sure. But for now... I got the salmon which was really delicious, but if you get a $12-$16 entree, you are told that it doesn't come with a side. The sides are $5 extra. My friend pointed out that this would be fine if the sides were served family style so everyone can try, but I just felt as though I wasn't getting enough food for what I was paying. The incessant water-refilling was driving me nuts and interfering with conversation. The desserts were really great. When they get their liquor license this may be a go to place for a glass of wine and dessert.",2.0
"Service was excellent, ambiance was lovely, and food and drinks were FANtastic.  Possibly the best bread I've ever had.  had calamari and tomato salad for appetizers.  both were soooo fresh. I got mussels for dinner and can't stop thinking about them - perfectly cooked with tender chunks of bacon and garlic...h'oh my god.  tasted my friends meals too - also fantastic. new york strip steak was cooked to perfection.  for dessert we had the banana bread...great size to share.  banana and chocolate mousse, moist bread, homemade ice cream...Ah!pricing for quality is also exceptional.  i highly recommend.",5.0
"F what you heard. This place is pretty good. Not cheap, but they use good ingredients and that's hard to find these days. Their menu is much more ""high post"" than anything else nearby. It's not a long list, but it's cushioned by daily specials. Dinner and Brunch. i recommend.",3.0
"My last experience at Anella was less than satisfactory.  I finally went back to try them again, and man o man did they get it right this time.  I had one of the best chicken dishes I have ever eaten.

"Anella is the type of restaurant I seek; it makes living in New York such a treat.Our party was seated in a lovely backyard garden. Our waiter was knowledgeable and engaging.  We started with a side of homemade meatballs, a light and flavorful rooftop salad (a Greenpoint specialty), chicken livers and salmon bruschetta.  Entrees ranged from a yummy brick oven Truffle Cheese & Onion Pie, chicken paillard, and a mouth watering double pork chop.  One of our party had a non-dairy restriction; the kitchen was very accommodating and she had a light and delicious pasta dish with fresh vegetables.We were absolutely delighted and plan to return!  A true gem in Greenpoint.",5.0

The portion was huge, and I couldn't finish it - but if I wasn't going out straight from there I would have stuffed it into my purse.Will definitely be back to try out the other dishes on the menu.Also, it's adorable.

"I love Anella. I've probably been about 8 times. And of those 8, I've had a couple of experiences that were less than ideal.  I think one night we came in, the place was really packed, and we waited two hours for our food, and when it came it wasn't very good. The waitress made it up to us with free drinks and a couple of extra appetizers. And because she treated us so well, we did not hold the poor service against her or the restaurant. If she hadn't acknowledged and tried to make things better, we likely would not have been back. Things happen, it's about how you handle it.

"I tried Anella for brunch recently. The interior was inviting but it's summer! We ate on the backyard patio, which is perfect for warm weather dining. Their flower/herb/vegetable garden borders the dining area, a very pleasant touch. Brunch entrees were decently priced: $10-$12 at the most. Anella had an intriguing selection of non-alcoholic brunch beverages. However, since they did have their liquor license in action, we decided on regular brunch drinks. Mimosa for me, a (very) spicy bloody mary for my friend. Caveat: Hopefully Anella puts the price list for brunch drinks on the menu soon. They were more expensive than anticipated. (We also could have asked but didn't, so that was our shortcoming). I ordered the cheddar scramble on bruschetta, cooked with truffle oil and came with roasted sliced potatoes. My companion got the salmon and cream cheese scramble on bruschetta with Rooftop farm greens. Both delicious; I like the bruschetta twist and I like that the potatoes are roasted, not being a huge fan of home-fries. And fresh greens are always, always a good thing.While the cocktails made brunch pricier than anticipated ($40+), overall, it was a good experience. I like having a new spot to go to when I'm feeling like something different. Would definitely like to try them for dinner because Anella has some imaginative twists to the usual Greenpoint brunch menu. I'm curious to see what else they do.",3.0

"I went for my first visit last week and it was a positive experience.  They are still sans liquor license which is nice on the wallet, but It will be nice when their bar is stocked.  I had a beet salad which was tasty and a cheese and herb pizza that was tasty as well.  They put a lot of care into the design of the space ( I'm usually hard to please in that area), but the music could use some help (I am a music snob, what can I say).  Most importantly, the food was worth the price, the staff was friendly and I left knowing I would go back.",4.0
"I have been here twice now and ate like a king at least once. We go to TBD and have a bunch of drinks get nicely tanked up and squiffy and then we stroll in here, ignorant and bladdered.

First time was better than the second, but after all - as I remarked to my dining companion - isn't that after all how life is?      Better first time around.      The service was good on each occasion, and so was the amatriciana. I can't fault it; I just have to fault my own disgusting cowardice in ordering. My dining companion had the clam pizza, which dish seems to have caused something of a stir across the five boroughs. It's okay if you like clams.      If not, not.      Incidentally, who refers to their dining companion as ""boy""? Weird affectation!      Franklin Street is transforming before our very eyes. It's like Reading in the early nineties. Every building on Friar Street reopened as a mega-pub.

I take this not as a sign of going too much ;), but of people actually caring. Thank you, Anella, for that, and for all the great evenings. See you again soon!",5.0
"Anella is way better than sucky Queen's Hideaway that used to be here.  I've been here a bunch of times already, it's definitely the best option for good food in this side of Greenpoint (I miss Paloma so much!).  The meatballs are great, most everything else I've had here is good, but not that special.  The service is very good and it's never too crowded and they are open late.  I would have probably given them 5 stars if they still didn't have their liquor license (or didn't charge $15 corkage fee).",4.0
I never can why there are not more people in this place because it is amazing. I have never had a bad dish or drink at Anella. I love eating here because I always get what Im looking for.,5.0
"One of the best meals I've had in NY.  You could taste the pure freshness of all the ingredients, especially the vegetables which are supplied by a backyard garden and nearby rooftop garden.  The service was extremely attentive and the ambience of the outdoor garden was great. Check this gem out!",5.0
"I tried Anella for brunch recently. The interior was inviting but it's summer! We ate on the backyard patio, which is perfect for warm weather dining. Their flower/herb/vegetable garden borders the dining area, a very pleasant touch. Brunch entrees were decently priced: $10-$12 at the most. Anella had an intriguing selection of non-alcoholic brunch beverages. However, since they did have their liquor license in action, we decided on regular brunch drinks. Mimosa for me, a (very) spicy bloody mary for my friend. Caveat: Hopefully Anella puts the price list for brunch drinks on the menu soon. They were more expensive than anticipated. (We also could have asked but didn't, so that was our shortcoming). I ordered the cheddar scramble on bruschetta, cooked with truffle oil and came with roasted sliced potatoes. My companion got the salmon and cream cheese scramble on bruschetta with Rooftop farm greens. Both delicious; I like the bruschetta twist and I like that the potatoes are roasted, not being a huge fan of home-fries. And fresh greens are always, always a good thing.While the cocktails made brunch pricier than anticipated ($40+), overall, it was a good experience. I like having a new spot to go to when I'm feeling like something different. Would definitely like to try them for dinner because Anella has some imaginative twists to the usual Greenpoint brunch menu. I'm curious to see what else they do.",3.0
"First visit was for brunch and it was amazing, great food (pancakes rocked) and relaxing homey vibe. The waitstaff was extremely nice and fun to talk with. The second visit was 5 hours later with a friend to eat an amazing dinner. I absolutley loved the vibe! It's refreshing to have a place like this in greenpoint.",5.0
"The food was pretty great, but what sets Anella apart is the service. Each and every employee in the restaurant was warm, friendly and very personable.  Our waitress was adorable and attentive and I really can't think of another restaurant withs such impeccable service.  Great dining experience overall.",5.0
"really great local spot.  the female bartender is a NOT friendly, but the wait staff is absolutely amazing and completely makes up for it.  the bread in clay pots is out of this world, as is the lamb papperdale, and gnocchi.  i realize the menu changes seasonally so those items are likely not available, however considering how delicious they were, i wld guess anything from that kitchen would be amazing.",4.0
"I went for my first visit last week and it was a positive experience.  They are still sans liquor license which is nice on the wallet, but It will be nice when their bar is stocked.  I had a beet salad which was tasty and a cheese and herb pizza that was tasty as well.  They put a lot of care into the design of the space ( I'm usually hard to please in that area), but the music could use some help (I am a music snob, what can I say).  Most importantly, the food was worth the price, the staff was friendly and I left knowing I would go back.",4.0
"I have been here twice now and ate like a king at least once. We go to TBD and have a bunch of drinks get nicely tanked up and squiffy and then we stroll in here, ignorant and bladdered. I ordered the amatriciana both times. First time was better than the second, but after all - as I remarked to my dining companion - isn't that after all how life is?      Better first time around.      The service was good on each occasion, and so was the amatriciana. I can't fault it; I just have to fault my own disgusting cowardice in ordering. My dining companion had the clam pizza, which dish seems to have caused something of a stir across the five boroughs. It's okay if you like clams.      If not, not.      Incidentally, who refers to their dining companion as ""boy""? Weird affectation!      Franklin Street is transforming before our very eyes. It's like Reading in the early nineties. Every building on Friar Street reopened as a mega-pub. People came out of their offices at 5:30 and plunged into these places til eleven o-clock rolled round.      Their lives passed - then they died.     Perhaps you remember.",4.0
"Visually the food looks amazing. But it was just too salty for me--especially the parpadelle. The mussels were served very generously, but too meaty for us so we barely ate any. Best was the complimentary bread (served in pot), mozzarella crostini, staff (friendly as hell), and drinks (had 4 different ones, all were excellent). But food? Meh.",3.0
"I went to Anella's after a friend recommended it the night before and fed me her leftover's.  She gave me a taste of her sauteed summer vegetables (over I believe rigatoni) which was spectacular.  Armed with a bottle of Telepraphe we decided to head over for a special dinner.  The service was very attentive and we were served a nice canape to start.  My cocktail order had to be changed because they couldn't find an orange for my old fashioned.  Also, we asked the wine be decanted when we came in to allow it to breathe some but was only decanted when the entrees were served.  Since they already had a liquor license at this point (unbeknown to us) and they still allowed us our wine, I couldn't be very upset.    One of the entrees was spectacular (the pork belly pasta) but the seafood black pappardelle  was a little plain.  They could have allowed the sauce to simmer more to concentrate the collection of shellfish flavors.  But the service, ambiance and menu concept were definitely spot on.  And judging what they did what the rigatoni from the night before it still definitely deserves a special trip to Greenpoint.",4.0
"Wonderful dinner experience -- we went here this past weekend and found it packed and cozy, which is a nice place to be on a very chilly night. We ended up having to wait about a half hour, but that was no problem as there was space at the bar and a very tasty selection of wines and cocktails -- I had the rye and absinthe concoction, which was perhaps a touch more absinthe-y than I had been expecting, but great. The table we were seated at was awesome and there's plenty of mood and atmosphere in the dining area -- dark but not too dark, and also quiet enough to talk while not being still as a tomb. Bread baked in a clay pot was a totally new one on me and was delicious. We were really impressed with our entrees -- mussels, and pork-on-pork awesomeness. My only sorrow is that we were too stuffed for dessert. To top it all off, a bill that was cheaper than I expected. Great place to have in the GPT, will definitely go back.",4.0
"I adore Anella.  The back garden is great, but, unlike some places, that's not all it has going for it.  When the weather is not appropriate for outdoor dining, I also appreciate the environment indoors.  I love the food, especially the pastas, but I've never had anything there I didn't like.  I kind of miss it being BYOB, but their wines are well-chosen and there is the quartino option, which I like.  The service is always impeccable: the wait staff are knowledgeable, personable, and always on top of their game.  It's so wonderful to have a ""special occasion"" place in Greenpoint and this fits the bill.  We enjoyed both New Years Eve and Valentine's Day there this year, but we've had many fun, casual nights with friends at the same spot.  Definitely try Anella.",5.0
"ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS. Went here last night on a recommendation from a friend. 3 of us sat outside and enjoyed well-made cocktails to start. Fresh baked bread with butter was a nice start.

You know how once you have a place you like to go you just end up getting the same thing over and over cos you know it'll be good?

"This is my first Yelp review, and I'm not a pro. It's worth noting, I'm not here to shill for Anella, either.  I'm giving three stars, described by Yelp as ""A-OK"", though, I think, for the sake of accuracy the ""A"" should be left out. Rather, I'd say this place is just ""OK"" at best. Anella is a C student on the Brooklyn/Queens restaurant scene, and I'll tell you why. Anella has all the pretense and menu-source hyperbole of a so-called world class neighborhood joint, but on my visit for brunch there was all of the price and none of the quirky ingredients and spot on prep. To start, I ordered a glass of orange juice. I swear I was served some kind of consumer variety Tropicana. To be fair, the menu didn't boast fresh juice, but it was $3, and the rest of the menu indicated attention to fresh and local. I feel like if a place is going to cut corners, or break consistency, it should at least be proud of the fact. I don't want a rooftop grown salad on my plate and jug OJ in my glass!For whatever reason, I decided to order the burger. I suppose a burger is something of my litmus test for whether a place is going to thrive. I ordered my burger medium rare, another test of whether service is adequate. I asked for cheese and was given two options: blue and fontina. I opted for fontina, though it's not my first choice for burger topping. After a long wait, after other diners had arrived, ordered and been served, my burger arrived, cooked nearly well done. After all the waiting I certainly wasn't going to send it back. I asked for mayo and ketchup. I was given ketchup and an apology instead of mayo. I persisted. I took my first bite of burger, and, to my surprise, it wasn't half bad! I'm not saying there is any excuse under the sun for serving an overcooked burger, it's not rocket science, but it tasted pretty decent. The menu said something about an ""angus blend"" which I assume means they're careful to control the fat content of the patty. It was fat content that saved this burger. Had it been 90 percent lean, no amount of non-existent mayo would have saved it. As it turned out, it was still juicy and flavorful, despite being poorly cooked and kinda hard. Loved the bun (toasted brioche) and actually loved the fontina. I wasn't impressed with the accompanying mixed greens, they were of the gourmet deli variety, common to all middle-class New Yorkers, though, they weren't offensive. Worth noting, greens arrived well seasoned. I was initially told the burger was served with lettuce/tomato/onion which wasn't the case. My burger was served with a few leaves of salad mesclun over the top and a couple of slices of uninspiring tomato on the plate. All this for $13, not an uncommon price in greater New York City, but no bargain for what I got.My wife ordered the caprese sandwich. According to the menu it's made with house made fresh mozzarella. If the mozzarella is indeed house made, they should give it up. By no means was it fresher than so many other mozzarellas. Certainly wasn't more tasty. So, the question is, would I go back? I suppose I would. I wasn't impressed, and I kinda think this place is DOA, but I wasn't offended. I just think they don't get it. They need a lesson in details and consistency. If my friends suggested this place, I'd tag along. I sense all the 5 star reviews are bogus somehow, but whatever, I'd eat there again. This is as honest a review I can think to write about a place. Will it make the Yelp cut? Remains to be seen. Hope so, cause it's the truth as I see it.",3.0
"This place was such a welcome surprise! In the neighborhood for a concert, I picked the most promising restaurant I could find, and I was not disappointed. We sat in the garden, which is lovely, and were treated to a glass of Brooklyn Lager each. We shared the roasted beet salad, served with apple slices, a light touch of olive oil and salt. Perfect. I had a seemingly bottomless bowl of spaghetti with meatballs (special that day). The meatballs were the size of baseballs, but nevertheless very moist and flavorful. The sauce was good. My friend had the halibut in a salsa verde, served with oven-roasted tomatoes, which was also very good; a well-cooked piece of fish. We were too stuffed with food and wine(byo for the time being) for dessert, and could not have been happier with the final bill (roughly $25pp).  The service was refreshingly pleasant and normal. I'm looking forward to my next trip out to Greenpoint.",4.0
"Being that I live in Manhattan I rarely get out to Brooklyn much, but this restaurant managed to get me into Greenpoint 3 times in one week, and this was pre-liquor license!  It's a lovely little space with a natural decor and an outstanding, relaxing back garden with fresh herbs and flowers.  Everything I love about New York restaurants!  The manager, Andrew, is absolutely delightful; friendly, welcoming and professional, while deftly managing incoming guests on a busy Saturday night.  I have never been disappointed with the food here.  I am absolutely in love with their arugula salad with pears and blue cheese!  Their cheese plate changes regularly--I had different cheeses every time I ordered it.  Their crudo is one of the best I had--delicate and lightly dressed.  Their pastas and pizzas are savory and served in a manageable portion, which I love.  The spinach linguine is a must have!  I am definitely looking forward to coming here for brunch soon!",4.0

I asked for mayo and ketchup. I was given ketchup and an apology instead of mayo. I persisted. I took my first bite of burger, and, to my surprise, it wasn't half bad! I'm not saying there is any excuse under the sun for serving an overcooked burger, it's not rocket science, but it tasted pretty decent. The menu said something about an ""angus blend"" which I assume means they're careful to control the fat content of the patty. It was fat content that saved this burger. Had it been 90 percent lean, no amount of non-existent mayo would have saved it. As it turned out, it was still juicy and flavorful, despite being poorly cooked and kinda hard. Loved the bun (toasted brioche) and actually loved the fontina. I wasn't impressed with the accompanying mixed greens, they were of the gourmet deli variety, common to all middle-class New Yorkers, though, they weren't offensive. Worth noting, greens arrived well seasoned. I was initially told the burger was served with lettuce/tomato/onion which wasn't the case. My burger was served with a few leaves of salad mesclun over the top and a couple of slices of uninspiring tomato on the plate. All this for $13, not an uncommon price in greater New York City, but no bargain for what I got.My wife ordered the caprese sandwich. According to the menu it's made with house made fresh mozzarella. If the mozzarella is indeed house made, they should give it up. By no means was it fresher than so many other mozzarellas. Certainly wasn't more tasty. So, the question is, would I go back? I suppose I would. I wasn't impressed, and I kinda think this place is DOA, but I wasn't offended. I just think they don't get it. They need a lesson in details and consistency. If my friends suggested this place, I'd tag along. I sense all the 5 star reviews are bogus somehow, but whatever, I'd eat there again. This is as honest a review I can think to write about a place. Will it make the Yelp cut? Remains to be seen. Hope so, cause it's the truth as I see it.",3.0
"This place was such a welcome surprise! In the neighborhood for a concert, I picked the most promising restaurant I could find, and I was not disappointed. We sat in the garden, which is lovely, and were treated to a glass of Brooklyn Lager each. We shared the roasted beet salad, served with apple slices, a light touch of olive oil and salt. Perfect. I had a seemingly bottomless bowl of spaghetti with meatballs (special that day). The meatballs were the size of baseballs, but nevertheless very moist and flavorful. The sauce was good. My friend had the halibut in a salsa verde, served with oven-roasted tomatoes, which was also very good; a well-cooked piece of fish. We were too stuffed with food and wine(byo for the time being) for dessert, and could not have been happier with the final bill (roughly $25pp).  The service was refreshingly pleasant and normal. I'm looking forward to my next trip out to Greenpoint.",4.0
"Being that I live in Manhattan I rarely get out to Brooklyn much, but this restaurant managed to get me into Greenpoint 3 times in one week, and this was pre-liquor license!  It's a lovely little space with a natural decor and an outstanding, relaxing back garden with fresh herbs and flowers.  Everything I love about New York restaurants!  The manager, Andrew, is absolutely delightful; friendly, welcoming and professional, while deftly managing incoming guests on a busy Saturday night.  I have never been disappointed with the food here.  I am absolutely in love with their arugula salad with pears and blue cheese!  Their cheese plate changes regularly--I had different cheeses every time I ordered it.  Their crudo is one of the best I had--delicate and lightly dressed.  Their pastas and pizzas are savory and served in a manageable portion, which I love.  The spinach linguine is a must have!  I am definitely looking forward to coming here for brunch soon!",4.0
i have eaten here for dinner and brunch and every experience has been awesome. the food is great the service is really good.,5.0
"i love this place.  i know it gets mixed reviews and i probably won't order the pizza again but i love it.  the salads are so fresh and i've only had the same waiter every time i go but he could not be nicer.  there is a cold host who i suspect is also the owner who could take a lesson in customer service, but everyone else is so nice.  the brunch is delish and every dinner i've had there has been so good.  i'm sad it's not byob anymore because now it's going to be much more expensive.  i didn't mind spending 20 bucks on an entree if i knew i was getting a bottle of wine for ten.  oh well...i will still go!",4.0
