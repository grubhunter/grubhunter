"DEFINITELY A 5 STAR WORTHY RESTAURANT! Chavela's is a cute corner spot restaurant with quaint and inviting decor. We came in and it was busy, but we were just a party of 2 so we got to sit without a wait. I wanted to try the brunch when I came here on Sunday, but we had just missed the end of brunch so we ordered off the regular menu. As appetizers we got the guacamole and the chicken quesadilla. The  guac was heavenly, seriously so delicious, and the fried tortillas they serve it with makes it so much better. The quesadilla was small as our server us when we ordered it, but we wanted to try it anyway. It was delicious, but next time we will order two, because it's too small to split. As an entrees we got a salad with grilled chicken and the PLATO DON! The Plato Don is such a great idea for taco lovers because what's better than building your own tacos. The chicken and steak the Plato Don came with was outrageous, the taste was just spot on. The service was great, regardless of who took our order anyone other worker who was around would come over to see if we needed anything else or a refill of a cocktail. I can not wait to come back here, it's worth the trip if you're not from this part of Brooklyn!",5.0
"My friends and I came here Sunday morning. It was packed. They guided the four of us to the high table at the entrance where the cold wind was blowing; we asked if there was table in the side room, they briefly checked. Nope, not going to happen because we are not one of the esteemed patrons deserving of a booth table.Okay cool, whatever man, it's cool.It was pleasant seeing the menu and seeing so much Oaxaqueno influences. I saw mezcal, michelada, mole, and quesillo. Unfortunately, there was no chapulines, hallucinogenic mezcal worms, hot chocolate.Tip for those who want to come here for happy hour or a night out, you cannot get a hangover from mezcal unless you get a fruity variety or drink shitty mezcal.I decided to go with the chilaquiles with chorizo. It had tortilla chips with queso fresco, Oaxaca queso, and refried beans, chorizo, and two fried eggs all drowned in a mole sauce. I wanted to ask the waitress what kind of mole sauce (rojo, negro, colorado, etc) it was, but I had a feeling she would not know what I meant so I forego asking.When I ordered it, there was no quesillo! It was crema! I was upset. I miss quesillo. The quesillo they sell in international markets here just aren't good. They are often hard and quite bland.The food was okay. The mole tasted most to mole rojo, but really not as tangy as I would have wanted.The problem with trying to get a taste of a place you have been is that you just should not go to begin with. In Ratatouille, Igor was automatically transported to the past when he ate his mom's ratatouille. When I tasted my chilaquiles, I was not transported anywhere.#takemeback#basicwhitegirlIt was about $13. Decent value for the amount of food, but not a decent value for a typical Mexican restaurant.",2.0
"Brooklyn used to be a lot different before all the white girls took over. Brooklyn was once a rough place to be.With this change, Chavela's moved in in 2007.So we're strolling through the Brooklyn Botanical Gardens, admiring the bonsai trees, rekindling our former interests in botany and plant physiology (the effect of iron on the primary root elongation of Arabidopsis during phosphate deficiency), then all of a sudden two of our friends are really worried because we need to walk faster, hurry up, we can't waste time, we have to leave this dank botanical place ASAP so that we can get some overrated Mexican food by 12pm so that we can catch our Megabus.Y'all need to chill.The food is overhyped. Anyone from San Diego or Mexico need not come here. I ordered the huevos rancheros. It just didn't taste good. The kicker is that two of our friends liked the food here more than that of Sarge's Jewish deli. God damn they are schmacked.This place is really popular. Packed on a Sunday morning. I don't have any suggestions in terms of how this restaurant can improve.",1.0
"The food was excellent, I had the crab filled enchiladas and it was delicious. The guacamole was creamy and flavorful just the way I like it. I decide to have the tres leche cake for dessert and it was so good. The place was cozy and the service amazing. My favorite part was the drinks a smoky mescal on the rocks!!!!!! It was exact what I need after a full work schedule !!!",4.0
Finally got around to trying this spot. It was actually really good. For the chicken and steak taco platter which was a lot of food for two to share. More so because we ate like 2 hrs ago and just wanted something light. Food cameOut really fast. And the meat was very tender and flavorful. Even when running out of shells we made a light taco bowl on the plate lol. The only negative thing I would say is that the two seater tables were a little too close together my butt was in someone's face just trying to sit down. And then the bus boys and waitresses seemed to be in a rush. Every Time I turned  around they were trying to take my plate and I wasn't even done. Had to tell them at one point stop asking I will tell them when I was finished.,5.0
"A great place to get brunch or lunch. Traveling as a couple, we decided to come here for a meal on a late Saturday afternoon. The restaurant was very crowded and a lot smaller than I expected, however, the hostess was attentive and we were seated promptly after 5 - 10 minutes. For our appetizer, we tried the ""Empanadas."" This dish was very rich in flavor, and the combination of shrimp, crab, and baby spinach made this appetizer a great starter for seafood lovers. One problem that I had to note was that this dish only came with two pieces of empanadas. Afterwards, our entree came out promptly. We had the ""Plato Don Carne"" and ""Aurelia's Mole."" Both dishes mainly consisted of rice, black beans, tortilla, and chicken, however, the Plato Don Carne came with an additional salsa and guacamole. The Aurelia'a Mole tasted amazing and the chicken meat was very tender. Overall, the price for everything was reasonable and I would come back again.",4.0
"So I'm of the fortunate disposition of having a best friend who understands that tacos = LIFE and part of the task in planning her wedding is TACO TASTING because she's going to have a taco buffet at her wedding next fall. Pretty freakin' awesome, right?So off we go to eat tacos and drink agua fresca and pack ourselves in with the rest of Brooklyn for the long haul. My appetite is way bigger than my stomach but we definitely made it happen and I had to roll myself out of there and into a cab home. Worth it? Totally. Definitely get the horchata agua fresca. Cinnamon and coconut go unbelievably well together.",5.0
"Their Chile Relleno Torta was THE BEST SANDWICH I HAVE EVER HAD! I came here after reading about their tortas, but I was not expecting this! The bread was crispy right at the surface, and then incredibly fluffy and light inside, some of it soaking up the tomato sauce. That sauce and the peppers had so much flavor and the cheese was super gooey and delicious.We also shared a chicken mole tamale and a cactus taco, and they were both good, though nothing compared to the torta. Mostly they just sounded interesting compared to anything I've ever had in Sweden. The aguas frescas were also really good, though I don't have anything to compare them to.Out of everything I ate in NYC during my visit, this was definitely my favorite meal. I can't wait to be back!",5.0
"Really great Mexican food in Brooklyn. Friend and I split the PLATO DON CARNE - with chipotle chicken & marinated steak for $17. Definitely recommend this plate because it has a little bit of everything (rice, corn tortillas, beans, meat, guac, pico di gallo). So good!!The food came out quickly and service was very efficient. This place is tiny, but they really try to maximize the space by moving around tables and chairs. My friend also got one of their house sangria's and drank every last drop of it!",4.0
"I'm not in Crown Heights too often, but Chavela's makes a very convincing point to come back. Definitely some of the best Mexican food that I've had in NYC...sorry Bushwick!Their brunch is everything and anything you could ever want. Order the prix fixe brunch menu to load up on caffeine (coffee or tea), get some carbs to soak up the hangover (Mexican sweet bread), and then nom one of their fantastic meals. We shared the guacamole, breakfast enchiladas, and eggless plato don brunch specials, which were all delicious (and huge). Definitely try their mole sauce, which is sweet, spicy, and perfect for smothering everything.Their eggless plato don was 10x larger than I expected it to be, but no regrets. It's perfect for vegetarians and/or those who love rolling their own tacos with a huge variety of ingredients, including beans, vegetables, guac, pico, and even chilaquiles on the side. I ended up taking most of mine home because I was too full, but it was certainly a welcome change to the regular huevos rancheros/breakfast burritos you find at most Mexican brunches.Service started dropping off towards the end, when we were in need of more water/coffee (one cup just doesn't do it on a weekend), but otherwise, everything was fantastic. Definitely coming back soon to try some of their regular menu offerings.",4.0
"Really impressed with this place! The seating is tight as its on the small side, but they offer a really great menu. I've been for brunch and dinner and both were very unique and delicious. The service is awesome and food comes fairly quickly. Their coffee is also amazing, highly recommend checking it out if you haven't been.",4.0
Couldn't believe the price we paid for 3 meals. Almost unheard of in Brooklyn these days as restaurants give you bite-sized food for an outrageous amount. Thank you Chavela for giving me great food and not breaking my pocket in the process. I was also equally shocked that we got a table and service was what it was (awesome!!!!). It was very crowded in there but the waitress was still attentive and our dishes did not take forever.Will totes return.,4.0
Wonderful mexican Food! We had something called plato with carne where you can make and fill your own tacos. Perfect Mixture. Also The guacamole was The best i ever tried.The music is pretty loud and the waiters are hectic but all in all it was a wonderful evening. Also loved the churros for dessert and the homemade lemonade!,4.0
"Monday evening here was sure packed. Good thing we came a bit after 630p and were able to get seated right away. I had a big lunch so sadly I didn't get chance to order entree. My dinner mate who lives here ordered Tilapia which she of course knew she would like.I stayed with empanadas. Two were in the order. I liked the crust texture. The filling was a slight bit on the bland side but I thought the sauce would make up for it but the sauce was even more bland.Who serves bland sauce with empanadas? Jazz it up..spice it up. Halfway through I figure I could have asked for a spicy sauce but I was like ""meh"". Just let me continue my convo. For drinks, I had the cucumber Don Pepino and Doña Paloma..both tasty.",3.0
"Great place !! 5* I have been here 3 times so far. And never dissapointed with food or service. Always so good ! Today i had a Thursday special. Some great steak with tacos & cactus . Greatly decorated interior, really cozy with just right temperature and music. Not loud but not soft either. Perfect to have a chat and not try to hear what person next to you is saying. Nice spot to have a date. Staff is really friendly and knowledgable. Place worth coming even if you live in different area of Brooklyn, like i do (prospect park south)Come and try it out, you will not be dissapointed.",5.0
The food is delicious and the drinks are pretty good. It does get crowded and feels cramped at times. Still a cool spot to get some string drinks and filling food.,4.0
"Went with my cousin to celebrate her last day of cancer treatment. This place is so tiny, but the hostess was quite nice and welcoming ( this determines the vibe in most experiences). Anyway, we got to our table the waitress was friendly as well. We ordered the don Plato, the queso jalapeño tamale, and empanadas. Unfortunately, they did not have any that day which left me disappointed. It was happy hour so for drinks we ordered the sangria margarita & a basic red sangria. The drinks very decent to be honest. We shared a chocolate covered bread pudding that was so delicious, but wasn't sweet. The bill came to $40 and that was so clutch. Price- reasonable, I dig it.Food- well seasoned & tastes good, but I wasn't wowed. It was basic, but the desserts though...Customer service- the staff is on point and they are swift.Vibe-Aztec figures, salsa/bachata was playing , loads of hipsters ( gentrifiers ) were in attendance, and there was rustic/colorful decor.",3.0
"I love this place. It's absolutely gorgeous inside and I loved spending time there. It's just beautiful. Their classic margarita pitcher was good, I'll have to try the sangria next time! I got the aguacate taco, which was amazing but had a little bit too much of a kick for me to fully enjoy (not very hot, I'm just super wimpy about it). I hadn't asked about that when ordering, so it's my own damn fault! Gotta ask next time :) Awesome place. I'll be back for sure.",4.0
I've been here twice and enjoyed both times. First time I came was in a Saturday and it was packed. They have a waiting area at the side where you can stand and wait and even order drinks.  Pretty smart on their part. A waitress comes around the waiting area and takes orders and attaches it to your name on the wait list. The sangria margarita mix drink is really good. I always get that. I've had the tacos that were good. Chips and guac are pretty good too. Last time I came I got the mole chicken which looked great but was lacking a lot of flavor. I wouldn't get this again but I would come back to the restaurant and try something else.,4.0
"Great Authentic Mexican food!After spending a beautiful day at the Brooklyn Botanical Gardens, we decided to grab brunch here. This was a personal favorite haunt of my boyfriend's when he lived in the neighborhood and he was happy to introduce me to this place.The food was fresh and very flavorful. The cocktails were also very inventive and tasty. We started with a ceviche that was citrusy and refreshing. He got his favorite dish: Chicken Mole and since he spoke so highly of their mole sauce, I got a Chicken Mole tamale that was smothered in the delicious mole sauce and a tinga quesadilla that was perfectly spiced. I also got an extra Nopales taco. I never had cactus before and it was sweet, a bit tart, and had a soft texture. I loved it!The front looks very weird with an off color blue-green dome top with Chavela's written on it and was quite unassuming but once you walk in, the rustic decor and high ceiling inside was beautiful. It was also decorated with Mexican motifs and very cool wood carved masks on the wall. It was also well priced and the menu was set up so that it was easy to try a bit of everything. Definitely would return when I'm the area.",5.0

I came here for dinner and was able to get a table.We got a pitcher of margaritas, which were not very strong (really disappointing because of the price); guacamole, which was very good; and tacos (good but not the best).

"Their ""Plato Don"" - Carne. 2 of us were able to share just one of these platters and were pretty fully. Everything was amazing and it was nice being able to pick & choose how much to put in each of our tortillas. All for $17. SO GOOD. We also got happy hour margaritas which were also strong and yummy.

"I came here yesterday morning with my husband and brother. I have had my eyes on the ""Eggless Don Plato"" breakfast special for ever. The special comes with a bunch of small bowls and a center piece of tortillas. Chilaquilles, refried beans, roasted vegetables, guacamole, pico de gallo and queso fresco. The chiaquiles had an option of sauce, i happily went for the vegetarian mole! I ordered a side of two eggs. When my food arrived, it was gigantic. I loved assembling tacos of a little bit of everything. I asked for some hot sauce. Our waitress, Lindsey poured me a little ramekin of hot sauce for my consumption. I liked grabbing a tortilla, placing a little bit of the eggs, a mole chip, some refried beans, a nibble of zucchini, topped with the lettuce, pico de gallo, cheese and a dab of hot sauce. It hit all my taste receptors. The brunch specials all come with your choice of coffee or juice. I always get coffee. Super strong and delicious. And if that wasn't enough you get some pan dulce (Mexican pastry). And we ordered a round of ""Bloody Marias"". I loved the spicy salt rim, chopped up jalapeno and cilantro. yum!Thanks for the great service Lindsey!",5.0

"I really love this place. I came here for my first meal as a Brooklyn resident in June (moved from Queens!), and had the french toast for brunch with some coffee and a mimosa.

I always see people waiting outside to go in, but lucky for myself and the person I was with, there was no line to get in that Saturday afternoon. But I would have waited, and will wait in the future if necessary, because this place is so delicious, it's worth it!",5.0
"We love this place for a fancier mexican dinner. They have great margaritas, fun tacos and we can bring our vegan friends since they have tons of vegan substitutes. Their squash blossoms are fantastic and I love their mole enchiladas. Get lots of little appetizers for the table. It's a shame they don't take reservations though. I had family in town and brought a party of 6, even called a few days before and they said they'd try to hold something for us but when we arrived there was just a communal table with 4 more seats that we had to squeeze into. A lot of places in the neighborhood will take a reservation for larger parties and I really wish they'd been more accommodating.",4.0
"My friend and I came here for a late lunch, after spending time at the Brooklyn Museum. It's not a far walk, so great place for some food after any museum adventures.

Ambiance is nice but also a bit loud with cramped tables. The decor is a lot of fun with mosaic tiles on the bar, colorful ceramic butterflies on the walls and jewel colored lanterns.

I also order the original guacamole but they have ones where you can mix in crab. I ordered the cheese quesadilla since I am a vegetarians but my best friend ordered the tacos and she kept raving about them!!

"Delicious margaritas - they come on tap! Their tacos are tasty - if you've never had cacti before, definitely try the taco with cactus. It's got the texture of a cooked red/green bell pepper, but the taste of... well, a cacti. It's actually really good! I ordered the first three tacos on the list, as they are vegetarian-appropriate. They were all different in flavor. I don't think I need to speak about their guac, let's be honest.... it's perfect.The ambiance is nice - we sat at the bar and it does get a bit tight at the bar, but that's not a big deal.

"This was my first time here and really excited to try this place!I came here late night on a Saturday after studying for fricken ever (ahhh, grad school life). ANYWAY, the food was great. We ordered ceviche, tacos, enchiladas and a few beers. The ambiance was awesome and it was really busy. But the music was hella loud and I couldn't hear a word that my friends were saying. So that was kind of annoying. Our waitress was awesome and really quick. She was very helpful.

"I really love the decor here. The colors they used to decorate are beautiful and I love all the little, interesting trinkets around the restaurant. It gives it a homey and authentic feel. I came here for their brunch, which you can get on Saturdays and Sundays from 11am-3:30pm. Each brunch special is $12.95 and includes tea and a Mexican sweet bread for each table. The sweet bread is so good. It reminded me of coffee crumb cake, except less cakey and lighter. If you want sweet bread to take home it is $2.50. To start off we got the Eggless Don Plato, which was my favorite entree. I thought it was a good deal and you get to make your own tacos, which is always fun. It comes with tortillas, spicy potatoes, tortilla chips with salsa verde (I thought the salsa verde was excellent), roasted vegetables, creamy guacamole, and refried beans.I got the Bistec, which is steak with a fried egg on top. potatoes, corn and salsa verde. The meat was juicy and I really love that sauce. My friend got the Torrejas, which is tres leche French toast, it was so creamy and good. I was getting full from the Don Plato and the Bistec but I made room so my friend could share this with me. I would definitely come back. In addition to the awesome brunch they have a good looking happy hour.",4.0
"For a Sunday night 6:55pm, it was pretty pop'n. We took that last seats at the bar. Drinks: Ordered the Isla Bonita (Ginger infused + agua de jamaica) which has a tart-esk flavor (which I loved). My friend ordered the Horchata... we had assumed it would come from a pre-made jug.... but the bartender made it RIGHT THERE. Fresh mix. It was so delish. Was tempted to trade in my alcoholic beverage for the Horchata.Apps: We had the guac. Mind you this is a medium scale (price) place, so it's not a San Diego portion, but enough to nibble for 2 ppl. Torilla chips are what got me. They were street taco sized chip. Whole chip. Loved it- they were generous on the chip end (which worked with out with the rest of our meals- maybe it was planed?). Meals: Friend is vegetarian and went with the black bean soup. Perhaps it was the chilly weather, but that soup was on point. I got the Ensalada Nopales (cactus), most if it had a pickled (vinegar) taste, but I love that kind of flavor with a little kick to it. But with the Jamaica + pickled stuff I was thankful that we ordered guac and her soup to balance the tart/tang/acid of my orders.No reservations here, but know that on a Sunday you should get there about 6/6:30pm to get first choice seating.

Maybe go with the guacamole because that was delicious.The fish tacos are AMAZING. So good I had to come back not even a week later. This time I ordered an actual entree, tilapia cooked in a banana leaf with olives and capers. Very delicious tho the serving size of rice is pretty small in ratio to the two pieces of tilapia.

"Ah I'm torn! I had an amazing time with dine-in at Chavela's the last time I went, and one of the worst delivery experiences I've ever had when I tried to order-in. Chavela's is located in a previously semi-dead zone of Crown Heights that seems to be quickly filling in with trendy bars/restaurants/shops. For now, it still stands out as one of the best meals you can get in the immediate area. The fare is mid to high-end Mexican, portions are on the small side, and food/drink prices are a bit pricey. If you can, try visiting on a Monday. Their Especiales del Dia are more reasonably priced and are actually pretty filling, and I found the Pastel Azteca to be a totally divine vegetarian option. Overall though, I wouldn't say they have huge variety for vegetarians and nearly nothing for vegans. So the delivery....oof. Chavela's gets 3 stars from me because my delivery experience was so horrible I may never go back (even for dine in). We live .7 miles away, straight down Bedford, close enough that it seems like they'd deliver right? Well 18 rude and/or unhelpful phone calls with the restaurant and incomprehensible driver and an hour and a half of waiting later, we learned that they only deliver ""north of the restaurant"". We eventually got our food, smashed boxes and all, close to midnight. The staff was so incompetent, including the manager we finally spoke with in the end, that I was really turned off. I'm also pretty insulted at what seems to be an overall lack of interest in serving the wider neighborhood. I know there's money north of you Chavela's, but you're really missing out on a lot of delivery customers with few other options in every other direction.",3.0
"I had one of their amazing Brunch Specials: poached eggs and chorizo on avocado toast, topped with a jalapeno hollandaise sauce, with leafy greens and spanish-style potatoes on the side.

"This is a pretty great Mexican place all things considered. The prices were good, the service was good, and the presentation was great. The taste is definitely the best part. I ordered the guacamole to start which was very fresh and and came with corn tortilla to dip. The taste of the guacamole was probably my favorite thing about this place. For the main course we ordered the Plato Don, Chicken Flautas, and Avacado sandwich. The plato don is a very large plate and the presentation was really great. The ability to make your own little mini tacos made it totally worth the price. The chicken flautas were juicy and came with a side of beans and rice which all had great flavor. The avacado sandwich looked a bit disappointing, but the taste was definitely there.The only complaint I have is the location we were seated. The attached room was closed off and we had to sit next to the door and the waiter constantly bumped into one of my friends sitting on the stool. This was a bit annoying when there were empty tables right next to us where this would not have been an issue.Overall I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a good mexican restaurant.",4.0
Ambiance was really nice. Liked the vibe and energy of the place. We got the chilaquilas. It was alright and the portion was small for $15 bucks. The chips and salsa was good too. Service was fine.

For now, it still stands out as one of the best meals you can get in the immediate area. The fare is mid to high-end Mexican, portions are on the small side, and food/drink prices are a bit pricey. If you can, try visiting on a Monday. Their Especiales del Dia are more reasonably priced and are actually pretty filling, and I found the Pastel Azteca to be a totally divine vegetarian option. Overall though, I wouldn't say they have huge variety for vegetarians and nearly nothing for vegans. So the delivery....oof. Chavela's gets 3 stars from me because my delivery experience was so horrible I may never go back (even for dine in). We live .7 miles away, straight down Bedford, close enough that it seems like they'd deliver right? Well 18 rude and/or unhelpful phone calls with the restaurant and incomprehensible driver and an hour and a half of waiting later, we learned that they only deliver ""north of the restaurant"". We eventually got our food, smashed boxes and all, close to midnight. The staff was so incompetent, including the manager we finally spoke with in the end, that I was really turned off. I'm also pretty insulted at what seems to be an overall lack of interest in serving the wider neighborhood. I know there's money north of you Chavela's, but you're really missing out on a lot of delivery customers with few other options in every other direction.",3.0
"I had one of their amazing Brunch Specials: poached eggs and chorizo on avocado toast, topped with a jalapeno hollandaise sauce, with leafy greens and spanish-style potatoes on the side. Nothing too spicy, just great taste. I had the coffee (which was included with the Brunch Specials), but they do have a full bar for all of your favorite brunch drinks! The place was comfortable, clean, and the staff couldn't have been nicer. If you're in the area, you should definitely put it on your list.",4.0

"This is a pretty great Mexican place all things considered. The prices were good, the service was good, and the presentation was great. The taste is definitely the best part. I ordered the guacamole to start which was very fresh and and came with corn tortilla to dip. The taste of the guacamole was probably my favorite thing about this place. For the main course we ordered the Plato Don, Chicken Flautas, and Avacado sandwich. The plato don is a very large plate and the presentation was really great. The ability to make your own little mini tacos made it totally worth the price. The chicken flautas were juicy and came with a side of beans and rice which all had great flavor. The avacado sandwich looked a bit disappointing, but the taste was definitely there.The only complaint I have is the location we were seated. The attached room was closed off and we had to sit next to the door and the waiter constantly bumped into one of my friends sitting on the stool. This was a bit annoying when there were empty tables right next to us where this would not have been an issue.Overall I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a good mexican restaurant.",4.0
Ambiance was really nice. Liked the vibe and energy of the place. We got the chilaquilas. It was alright and the portion was small for $15 bucks. The chips and salsa was good too. Service was fine. He came to take our order and pick up the check but did not ask how our meal was at any point in the meal. The bus boys were more helpful than the server and extremely nice.I liked the window seat as well and we were seated immediately.,3.0
"Crab tuqitos were yummy, music too loud for the waiter to hear our order, taco and Pastor Don were lackluster honestly wold not go back!",2.0
I want to give this place 5 stars but can't because of the service.  Food is great love the Plato don best but the last time I was here there was a creepy drunk guy wandering the restaurant literally knocking stools over and bothering female guests. Why the bar tender continued to give him drink after drink is beyond me but it was quite awkward and uncomfortable.   He was wandering the restaurant the whole entire time we were there:(,4.0
"Great mexican option.  Possibly one of the best in the city. Went last weekend and tried the cactus taco, tilapia tacos, chicken enchiladas and chips and guac.  We were seated quickly, the waitress was super helpful.  The place was a bit densely packed but still comfortable.If you're looking for tips, pass on the cactus taco.  However, the tilapia taco is great and the homemade mole sauce is really really awesome.  I've never had mole quite like this. It was chocolately and creamy and really effective. Don't miss it  The chips were also homemade and perfectly round and crunchy...another good choice. The margarita here was ok, i'd say.  It doesn't compete with some of the fancier ones you can get in manhattan, but has an interesting carbonated kick to it.Chavela's was overall a great experience.",4.0
"Chavela's is one of the most popping places on Franklin Ave. It's frequently reviewed in magazines as a top spot for Mexican fare. I've been probably 4 or 5 times. The decor is fantastic and unique. They have a great brunch with Mexican and American breakfast fusion. They also have good drinks. Overall, it's a good place, but get there early because there's almost always a wait.",5.0

This is the best Mexican food you will eat anywhere. I've never been disappointed. The guac with trout is something I've never had before, and the tortilla soup with its tomatillo base is amazing. All of their tacos are great--I love the hongos. Aurelia's Mole reminded me of being back in San Miguel de Allende. The churros with chocolate, the flan, excellent.

"Went here for happy hour and literally the best thing was the drinks. Mind you, I only chose to have a beer. So I did notice this place has a lot of great reviews, maybe these people just know what to get at Chavela's. I went on a cruise and stopped in Mexico where we had food, so I don't know what can be more authentic than that. Plus our cruise line cooked Mexican food for us that night, great!I like to keep it simple when I go to a new place. I ordered a Chicken Quesadilla, one Chicken Mole taco and some rice and beans. My boyfriend ordered 3 Chicken Mole tacos.The mole tacos were not bad but not what I expected. My boyfriend had to force his self to eat them because he hates to waste food. He seemed not to like them at all. I was so glad I only ordered one. The taco had a sweet flavor and even though I added a little pinch of salt to it, it still seemed to be missing something. I ate that and I knew that I would never get it again.The rice came with black beans which is one of my favorites. The rice was actually good no complaints.To the quesadilla, the chicken smelled like it was boiled in baby poop. The flavor was oh so bland. I took a bite with my fork and had to spit it back out discreetIy. I asked the waiter for something else.I decided to try the fish taco, it was the best thing on the menu that I ate, by far.

I ordered a margarita that tasted like it came out of one of those pre-mixed containers you buy at Target. It cost $10 and was completely disgusting. Couldn't even finish half of it. I thought I would be saved by the crab taquitos... Until they came out. Our server told me even though they were considered an appetizer, there were four so I assumed that'd be enough for me (only mildly hungry).

I love Mexican food. It's my top five fav things to eat but I don't know how I feel about this place. The decor is beautiful. The service is great. I wouldn't say they have a lot of options on the menu to try which is a little eh. I ordered chicken enchiladas with not mole sauce but the other (can't remember the name) and it was super limey. My boyfriends father ordered the same and he also said it was limey so I know it wasn't me. They're a little on the expensive side I would say. Would I come back again maybe to try the drinks other than that not so sure,3.0

"This place is meh...service from the bar is bad...food is bland and chicken was really dry. I ordered a quesadilla and it was almost like an empanada, there is no melted cheese. The bartender never checked on us (which I wanted to ask about the quesadilla) or offered us more drinks. The fundido was good, but it wasn't a dip. The michelada was the best part and the busboys were really good! Very quick and they were smiling.I might come back, but I'll wait for a table and give the servers a chance. Service shouldn't be bad because it's busy. Ambiance and decor are really nice. If you're looking for authentic Mexican food, try somewhere else.

"Total tourists in Brooklyn and loving the Mexican food.Wanting to get away from the city, the bf and I settled on Brooklyn, specifically Prospect Park (okay, not really an escape but at least we had to travel 45 minutes to get there). Of course after our cross city journey, our stomachs were screaming. Handy dandy Yelp pointed us in the direction of Chavela's.At 4PM, we actually had to wait for a table. It wasn't long but it was indicative of what we were in for. Scrunched in between two other couples, our hostess pulled out the table and seated us. For starters, we both got cocktails. My cucumber Don Pepino was the perfect balance between refreshing and boozy. I also normally hate a salted rim, but I couldn't stop licking the spicy chili pepper / salt and opted for no straw.We got the crab taquitos as an appetizer. Smothered with guacamole and different salsas, the four rolls were gone in a second. A couple notes on those: the fresh crab was definitely the way to go. With the tortilla, it was so much awesomeness and crunch all at once. I would however prefer more guac; you could barely cover each one with a thin layer of green.For the main course, we split the seafood Plato Don. Yes, every review on here mentions it (we went off those recommendations) but per usual, Yelp rarely gives poor recommendations. Enough for 2 people, portions are big enough for 8 corn tortilla tacos and none were lacking in flavor. Ingredients included: shrimp, fish, rice, beans, guac, tomato salsa, lettuce, queso fresco, sautéed onions and peppers, lime, cilantro, and tortillas. If that doesn't scream deluxe Mexican goodness, I don't know what does.Service was fairly attentive and we were consistently checked on. The bathroom was interesting to note: those double doors in the back, that's the bathroom. Not a hallway to them, but the actual bathroom. Don't forget to knock!But yeah, this place is definitely a neighborhood favorite, no surprise, and if you ever find yourself in Crown Heights, give Chavela's a try!",5.0

"Oh Chavela's, you have my heart for life. My friend brought me here a last year when she was in town visiting. We both fell in love with it. I started coming back here again. Their brunch is really tasty and comes with some extras, so you're getting a great deal. ( I want to say their brunch items run about $12 which is pretty decent.) There's usually a wait but totally worth it. Their hot sauce is insane. Like, turn your mouth inside out kinda stuff. I had it on the veggie taco. Speaking of, the taco comes with avocado on it and surprise! You actually get the avocado. Not just one or two sad slices. The staff is nice here and it's always fun to chat with them (if they're not crazy busy!)If you're not looking to trek out to Sunset Park and you want fantastic authentic Mexican food then this is your jam. PS: try their margarita on top. You'll be glad you did.",5.0
"After passing by a number of times and seeing relatively positive reviews, I wanted to like Chavela's. The decor is nice and the staff is friendly, but the food was simply not good. Here's why:I ordered the meat plato don and my friend ordered the chicken enchilada. Our food came out pretty quickly, but both dishes were lukewarm. Awesome. The plato don comes with plenty of food to feed either two people or one particularly hungry person, but I barely touched it on my own. The rice and beans were bland, the chicken was way too salty, and worst of all, the beef was a grey, greasy, chewy mess. It straight up smelled and tasted like a hot dog. Yes, hot dogs are delicious, but not when they're masquerading as ""marinated steak."" It's clear that if it even is beef, it's some really cheap beef. My friend found one piece of chicken in her entire enchilada and said that the mole left a strange aftertaste. She joked that the filling options should be cheese, chicken, and air. Neither of us wanted to try the other's dish, and that's unusual for two starving Mexican food fans.There are a lot of options on the menu, but I won't be returning to try anything else.",2.0
I love Mexican food. It's my top five fav things to eat but I don't know how I feel about this place. The decor is beautiful. The service is great. I wouldn't say they have a lot of options on the menu to try which is a little eh. I ordered chicken enchiladas with not mole sauce but the other (can't remember the name) and it was super limey. My boyfriends father ordered the same and he also said it was limey so I know it wasn't me. They're a little on the expensive side I would say. Would I come back again maybe to try the drinks other than that not so sure,3.0

"This place is meh...service from the bar is bad...food is bland and chicken was really dry. I ordered a quesadilla and it was almost like an empanada, there is no melted cheese. The bartender never checked on us (which I wanted to ask about the quesadilla) or offered us more drinks. The fundido was good, but it wasn't a dip. The michelada was the best part and the busboys were really good! Very quick and they were smiling.I might come back, but I'll wait for a table and give the servers a chance. Service shouldn't be bad because it's busy. Ambiance and decor are really nice. If you're looking for authentic Mexican food, try somewhere else.

Came here with a friend for lunch. Very decent priced lunch specials. They also make a few speciality drinks but we tried their original Margarita and their red sangria. Both were very yummy.The meal came with chips and your choice of salsa or guac. The chips are not your traditional cut chips but they're small and round like tortillas. Extra chips cost a buck.

"Before we get the actual meal, I just want to get something off my chest: I understand why you don't seat people until the whole party has arrived. Really, I get it.

"Went here last night . Have been eating here since they were at their tinier location on  Classon. Usually they are consistent with quality of food and drinks but I do feel over the years standard has slowly  gone down. I still think it's one of the best values in this area of Crown Heights for price, ambience and overall food and drink quality.Location on Franklin is beautifully decorated with gorgeous Mexican tile, raw wood ,Mexican paintings. Good bar space and tinier dining area.Romantic space that just got bigger as they purchased dining room next door. Unfortunately super loud always as it is always super busy. I must say even though they are always busy I have never had to wait more than 15 minutes for a table without reservation .Service is usually friendly speedy and attentive. Last night was off- as our server took forever to take our order. Food is usually on pointe ranging from excellent to very good most visits - fresh Mexican staples corn tacos, quesadilla, tortas etc. They are always expanding and changing up different parts of menu which I love.We started with empanadas special cocinita pibl filled ones. Served with a tiny crazy spicy but tasty pickled red onions and avocado salad. Initially were given wrong ones, spinach shrimp and crab regular empanadas which were actually better than special. The dough was soft flaky deliciousness. Good ratio of filling to dough. Order comes with two small empanadas.I tried the $22 Bistec. It's was a huge chunk of really low quality meat( chewy tough with lots of gristle and fat), barely seasoned and cooked medium( I asked medium rare) without sear. Meat was grey and looked like it was steamed. Served with cheese quesadilla and retried beans. We were eating late and I did not have the energy or appetite  to return it.Overall my entree was  disappointing .My dinner partner had the $11 flautas which were good but nothing spectacular. Drinks are usually tasty with interesting flavor profiles not seen elsewhere, not super strong and not huge but price $8-10 is reasonable. I had the Don Pepino which has cucumber lime with mezcal. Very refreshing for the summer heat. Also tried drink with hibiscus and mezcal. Very aromatic and on the sour side. I really wish they made drinks stronger consistently.Tried the flan for dessert which was ok nothing great. So good neighborhood spot and certainly one of the best options on Franklin",3.0

I also had a few drinks.  And the bartenders were amazing.  I love spicy drinks,  so they made everything spicy for me.  SCORE.Lovely interior,  great service,  and a happening crowd.  What more could you ask for?",5.0
"Fish. Motha-humpin. Tacos, y'all! This place is awesome. Wonderful staff, cheap, a la carte tacos, and a great atmosphere. I love this place. Lacking: beer selection (only ""mexican"" beers...) and the margs were pretty weak. But the food is a bargain and quite good. Cool crowd, def a neighborhood place. Give it your attention and ye shall be repaid!",4.0
Oh Chavela's you won my heart with your Pastor vegetarian friendly dishes! Very few places compare to how amazing the food quality is here and the craftsmanship of their drinks. I will forever be coming back here.,5.0
"Went here last night . Have been eating here since they were at their tinier location on  Classon. Usually they are consistent with quality of food and drinks but I do feel over the years standard has slowly  gone down. I still think it's one of the best values in this area of Crown Heights for price, ambience and overall food and drink quality.Location on Franklin is beautifully decorated with gorgeous Mexican tile, raw wood ,Mexican paintings. Good bar space and tinier dining area.Romantic space that just got bigger as they purchased dining room next door. Unfortunately super loud always as it is always super busy. I must say even though they are always busy I have never had to wait more than 15 minutes for a table without reservation .Service is usually friendly speedy and attentive. Last night was off- as our server took forever to take our order. Food is usually on pointe ranging from excellent to very good most visits - fresh Mexican staples corn tacos, quesadilla, tortas etc. They are always expanding and changing up different parts of menu which I love.We started with empanadas special cocinita pibl filled ones. Served with a tiny crazy spicy but tasty pickled red onions and avocado salad. Initially were given wrong ones, spinach shrimp and crab regular empanadas which were actually better than special. The dough was soft flaky deliciousness. Good ratio of filling to dough. Order comes with two small empanadas.I tried the $22 Bistec. It's was a huge chunk of really low quality meat( chewy tough with lots of gristle and fat), barely seasoned and cooked medium( I asked medium rare) without sear. Meat was grey and looked like it was steamed. Served with cheese quesadilla and retried beans. We were eating late and I did not have the energy or appetite  to return it.Overall my entree was  disappointing .My dinner partner had the $11 flautas which were good but nothing spectacular. Drinks are usually tasty with interesting flavor profiles not seen elsewhere, not super strong and not huge but price $8-10 is reasonable. I had the Don Pepino which has cucumber lime with mezcal. Very refreshing for the summer heat. Also tried drink with hibiscus and mezcal. Very aromatic and on the sour side. I really wish they made drinks stronger consistently.Tried the flan for dessert which was ok nothing great. So good neighborhood spot and certainly one of the best options on Franklin",3.0
"Finally I worked up the courage to give Chavela's another try. It's been almost a year after my not so good experience that turned me off. I had a craving for Spanish food and was in the area so I said why not. I sat at the bar, place was pretty much at capacity. It took a little longer than I liked for the bartender to acknowledge me but as I said they were packed. Ordered a classic Rita and chicken enchiladas with salsa verde. Food was amazing, definitely made me add Chavela's back to my list of lovely food spots. Nice date spot. Even tho it may seem cramped and a bit loud, sitting at tables is actually really intimate and allows for close convos!!",4.0
Maybe they had just cleaned the night we went but it smelled very strongly of chlorine when we walked in. The tables were so tightly packed I felt like everyone around me could hear my entire conversation. The shrimp Appetizer was good but I ordered the enchiladas and I was super disappointed. I live in Texas and I'm a bit critical of mexican food and I wasn't a fan. The sauce was brown and sweet and nothing like any enchiladas I've ever had.,2.0
Overpriced Mexican food with prompt delivery in Brooklyn!   What happens is you ox up the sides and the items and before you know it you dropped $50 before any drinks!

"Sad to say--it is resting on its laurels.  For the price point, the service was really strange!(The waiter came up behind my friend and whispered in his ear, ""chug! chug! chug!"")  Did this turn into an Irish pub?  Can't be, because the Don Pepinos which we paid extra to have with mezcal didn't even taste boozy.  If it were a pub, we could taste that.  We tried several of the specialty cocktails and they all tasted too sweet.  Hopefully just an off night?  This was a place we always regarded highly for drinks.The mole enchiladas are still good, but why is the presentation just a plate of brown?  Can't they put some radish slices on there or lime or something to give it a little color other than brown?Seems like I'm going to have to start looking past Chavela's and maybe past Crown Heights for Mexican food.  Is it time to go to Brownsville now?  Is the Starbucks opening on Franklin bringing everything else down in its sweep?",2.0
"Chavelas is by far my favorite spot to eat in the Crowne Heights area! Awesome service, awesome people and awesome food!

The food was DELICIOUS!!! Really took me back to my Cali roots. But the service.... Completely ruined the nostalgic experience. 1. We ordered an assortment of dishes all of which were awesome...

This time we got a table right away and the manager was very accommodating with our requests. Ordered the margarita-sangria campechana pitcher along with flautas to start followed by Steak medium rare... Perfect temperature on the meat, spicy hot and I enjoyed it so much!

"This is one of those reviews that I'm kicking myself for not having written long ago. This is my FAVORITE Mexican restaurant in the five boroughs. (Yeah - I said it!)This is the kind of restaurant where you simply cannot order the wrong thing! I've been many times over the past couple of years, and Chavela's never fails to impress. Food highlights: whatever the daily special is (I'm a big fan of the steak tacos with avocado, the chicken in green mole, or the slow cooked pork with chile); the Plato Don - a big circular tray of all your favorite Mexican foods - guac, a protein, rice and beans, fresh tortillas, salsa - which I should note is a GIANT amount of food - enough for two meals for even the heartiest eaters; the tortilla soup; the roasted elote (corn) with jalapeno aoli and cotija cheese; the enchiladas.

"I'm from Mexico City and I have to say Chavela's is perhaps my favorite Mexican Restaurant in NYC.I love the décor the music selection. Tequila and Mezcal selection seems to be quite ample.Drinks are okay. I'm not crazy about their cocktails, but it's decent stuff.Saturday evenings seem very busy but they have kind of a little waiting room on the side, where you can sip a drink while you wait for a table (clever!).They are quite busy for brunch as well, but if you're going solo (as me and a bunch of other regulars it seems), you're likely to find a spot at the bar without a problem.Food I've tried:- Enchiladas de mole: Yummy! I always get the chicken ones. I don't recommend mixing mole with beef. -Chilaquiles: They have a little bit of a crunch and great taste whether you go for green or mole. However the portion served for brunch is kind of skimpy- Quesadillas de huitlacoche: Couldn't even taste the huitlacoche. I'd say skip the quesadillas- Tacos al pastor: If you want to eat tacos al pastor, go to a taco place. They might taste good, but they are far from being real tacos al pastor.- Huevos rancheros: This was a strike for me. They were overcooked (yolk almost completely cooked) and ranchero sauce was more like sautéed pico de gallo with big chunks of onion and shaved garlic; that's not salsa ranchera!! Tortilla is supposed to be fried, otherwise it gets soggy in no time with the sauce, so this was also a no no.Well... after reading my own review, I realize that I keep coming back because of the chilaquiles and mole!",4.0

"My cousin and I decided to have a spontaneous Thursday afternoon and eat lunch at Chavela's. Chavela's is on my list of restaurants to dine as I partake in my rediscovering of NYC via Yelp, so I was excited and thankfully not disappointed.Chavela's is small and can fill up fast, but luckily we arrived a few minutes after its opening. Since it was our first time, the waiter was kind enough to explain the details of the lunch special, which varied from tacos, tostada chicken and rice among others,For starters, we ordered the empanadas filled with shrimp, crab and spinach, which were tasty. The gucamole and chips were fresh and chunky (the way we like it!)As for lunch, the options are endless and vaaries from tacos to tostado to rice and oven roasted chicken. We decided on the Duo Combo, where you choose a food item on the left and another on the right under this category. After an internal battle on what to order because everything sounded so delicious, we settled on the bistec (marinated steak) taco and chicken mole tostado. The flavor was rich and the seasonings were just right. Everything tasted fresh.I am so glad I checked this place off my list of must tries. It was amazing and I will definitely return.",5.0

"I visited Chavela's en celebracion de Cinco De Mayo with a group of 5. Our 1st option was Guerros around the corner but Chavelas gave us more of the authentic Mexican flair with dark, romantic-spookylike Day of the Dead like decor. Lots of halloween skulls dressed up like mariachis, vintage chandeliers, tiles, and antique dishes. There was a long wait (luckily I was the last to arrive at dinner  :) There are perks to being late! We sat closest to the door. Pressed up against the wall. I really love Crown Heights for their cool, hipster-East Village vibes, BUT! The seating was crammed and uncomfortable. I almost fell off my bar stool. Definitely an ideal place for a date for 2, nothing more. We ordered a pitcher of White Sangrita. Delicious. My friends ordered shrimp Ceviche, I believe a tostada, beef tacos and I ordered crab meat tacquitos. All high quality ingredients and all delicioso! Waiters were attentive and service was fast. I would've loved to sample the desserts, but I was much too tipsy :)",4.0

She talked about us behind my ear, placed an incorrect order, tossed us to another server mid-meal and left us to have a terrible experience. The manager was the worst part - he basically seemed like this was an everyday occurrence and gave us $3 off our order. Me and my friends have worked at restaurants in NYC before - step it up. Bye, Chavela's. There are many other great Mexican restaurants in the area. For those interested, check out Gueros, chica Mexicana, picante, or chipotle because at least chipotle will respect you for spending your money at their establishment. Lylas, yelp.",1.0
"I had a tamale and quesadilla and both had a lot of zing and flavor. Topped with what I assume is a house salsa verde, it was a good meal. Their flan was more dense and custardy than I'm used to but I loved it. Prices are a wee high for what they are serving but (we had a lot of grain and cheese) but I imagine it's standard for Brooklyn, NY.",4.0
"I'm from Mexico City and I have to say Chavela's is perhaps my favorite Mexican Restaurant in NYC.I love the décor the music selection. Tequila and Mezcal selection seems to be quite ample.Drinks are okay. I'm not crazy about their cocktails, but it's decent stuff.Saturday evenings seem very busy but they have kind of a little waiting room on the side, where you can sip a drink while you wait for a table (clever!).They are quite busy for brunch as well, but if you're going solo (as me and a bunch of other regulars it seems), you're likely to find a spot at the bar without a problem.Food I've tried:- Enchiladas de mole: Yummy! I always get the chicken ones. I don't recommend mixing mole with beef. -Chilaquiles: They have a little bit of a crunch and great taste whether you go for green or mole. However the portion served for brunch is kind of skimpy- Quesadillas de huitlacoche: Couldn't even taste the huitlacoche. I'd say skip the quesadillas- Tacos al pastor: If you want to eat tacos al pastor, go to a taco place. They might taste good, but they are far from being real tacos al pastor.- Huevos rancheros: This was a strike for me. They were overcooked (yolk almost completely cooked) and ranchero sauce was more like sautéed pico de gallo with big chunks of onion and shaved garlic; that's not salsa ranchera!! Tortilla is supposed to be fried, otherwise it gets soggy in no time with the sauce, so this was also a no no.Well... after reading my own review, I realize that I keep coming back because of the chilaquiles and mole!",4.0
"The service cannot be beat!! They are always on it, very quick and professional. The apps were fantastic which left me expecting a lot for the main course which was delicious but fairly basic. Could have been my ordering. Ordered a pitcher of margarita and it was weak in terms of alcohol.",4.0
"My cousin and I decided to have a spontaneous Thursday afternoon and eat lunch at Chavela's. Chavela's is on my list of restaurants to dine as I partake in my rediscovering of NYC via Yelp, so I was excited and thankfully not disappointed.Chavela's is small and can fill up fast, but luckily we arrived a few minutes after its opening. Since it was our first time, the waiter was kind enough to explain the details of the lunch special, which varied from tacos, tostada chicken and rice among others,For starters, we ordered the empanadas filled with shrimp, crab and spinach, which were tasty. The gucamole and chips were fresh and chunky (the way we like it!)As for lunch, the options are endless and vaaries from tacos to tostado to rice and oven roasted chicken. We decided on the Duo Combo, where you choose a food item on the left and another on the right under this category. After an internal battle on what to order because everything sounded so delicious, we settled on the bistec (marinated steak) taco and chicken mole tostado. The flavor was rich and the seasonings were just right. Everything tasted fresh.I am so glad I checked this place off my list of must tries. It was amazing and I will definitely return.",5.0

"I visited Chavela's en celebracion de Cinco De Mayo with a group of 5. Our 1st option was Guerros around the corner but Chavelas gave us more of the authentic Mexican flair with dark, romantic-spookylike Day of the Dead like decor. Lots of halloween skulls dressed up like mariachis, vintage chandeliers, tiles, and antique dishes. There was a long wait (luckily I was the last to arrive at dinner  :) There are perks to being late! We sat closest to the door. Pressed up against the wall. I really love Crown Heights for their cool, hipster-East Village vibes, BUT! The seating was crammed and uncomfortable. I almost fell off my bar stool. Definitely an ideal place for a date for 2, nothing more. We ordered a pitcher of White Sangrita. Delicious. My friends ordered shrimp Ceviche, I believe a tostada, beef tacos and I ordered crab meat tacquitos. All high quality ingredients and all delicioso! Waiters were attentive and service was fast. I would've loved to sample the desserts, but I was much too tipsy :)",4.0
"YAS HUNNIE YASthats how i feel upon entering the door at Chavelz.You may have to wait - but just realize the wait is worth it. The service is always quirky and funny - and the food is pheonom.Highly recommend the Taco deal - the Fish Taco is goodasfuck, and the steak taco is tadiefor.Get the guac and DEF GET MARGARITA/SANGRIA MIXED",5.0
"Nope nope nope.I went to Chavela's for dinner with my girlfriend. We sat at the bar to avoid waiting for a table. After about 5 minutes the bartender came over and took our orders. We asked for:- a glass of wine- a handmade margarita- chips and guac- empinadas as an appetizer- a torta as an entree- chicken enchilada's with molé as an entreeIt took almost 15 minutes for our drinks to come even though we were sitting at the bar, but they brought the chips and guac shortly thereafter so I wasn't too annoyed. About 15 minutes later they brought the enchilada (main course) and the the empanadas (supposed to be an appetizer?) but the enchiladas were cheese with verde instead of chicken with molé. I pointed out the mistake and the enchiladas were taken away. We worked on the empanadas and assumed the torta would arrive with the correct enchiladas.I got new enchiladas (which were really delicious) pretty quickly but there was still no sign of the torta. After another 10 minutes or so and no more food we assumed the torta wash't coming, decided we didn't want it so it wasn't worth asking about, and shared the enchiladas and remaining empanadas. We finished our food, worked on our drinks, and settled into post-dinner mode. We even started talking about ordering some dessert because we'd heard that the rice pudding is really good. We never got the chance. A full 35 minutes after bringing out the enchiladas and 10 minutes after clearing all of our plates away, a server finally brought out the torta. We explained that we no longer wanted it since it had been brought out way too late and we just wanted to finish our drinks and get some dessert. The server seemed pissed. About a minute later the bartender gave us our bill without prompting and without asking if we wanted desert. We paid it, left, and went home to make a blueberry pie which was probably way better than their rice pudding anyway. I'm never coming back. TL;DR: It took a long time to get drinks, then they sent out the wrong entree, then they totally forgot about the second entree until we had already finished eating, then they hustled us out like we were being troublesome for pointing out that they had messed up our order twice in one meal. If they do takeout go for it, but I don't trust their staff for dine-in or delivery.",1.0

Super friendly service. We happened to come on Día de Muertos, so all the staff was decked out. I only wish they had later hours. They practically had to kick us out of the joint.Now.... The Sangria. Holy crap was it good. Fruity and flavor packed, with a nice kick as well.

Let's talk about the food, the carne enchiladas was super salty and spicy! I'm sorry for wasting my Friday night to try this place by yelpers recommendation and most importantly I do not think it's fair that nobody in this establishment pays attention to anyone who is outside of the payroll!

"To be honest this little amazing place sent from heaven! They have probably some of the best mexican food. I just got back from mexico and to give you guys a little background information about REAL Mexican food: Quesadillas aren't flour tortillas that are just filled with cheese and tacos don't always come with extensive amount of toppings and burritos are a TEX-MEX dish. So if you're coming in looking for a tex-mex restaurant this definitely isn't the place. At Chavela's quesadillas are little pockets of heaven filled with different toppings like flower blossom or corn truffle (a little out of the ordinary). Tacos come with exactly what is mentioned on the menu nothing more nothing less. This place has to be my favorite in Crown Heights, drinks are well prepared. Who ever thought of making a cucumber and cilantro marg is absolutely genius. The extensive amount of tequila really incorporates the Mexican feel. THIS PLACE GETS PACKED on the weekends which can make people antsy but the wait is never too long. I visited a few days ago and their using the next door space as a little cocktail area while you wait! I love this place definitely coming back!",5.0

The sandwich was amazing, and damn it, well I'm a sandwich guy. The chicken was the star, it was perfectly fried, but still so juicy and just so good, and the jalapeno mayo really just tied it together.  The enchiladas were great and came with rice and beans and they were really cheesy. The guacamole and chips on the side were really good, and the service was really fast, we got our food within 10 minutes of ordering (and thank god, because we were starving after moving in all my stuff). This place gets crowded super quick, as like...every day when I'm passing by around 7 after work, tons of people standing outside.

Service was good...somewhat rushed but I guess that's to be expected since the place is small and it was a Friday evening. Drinks were tasty but not strong. Def not a $10 drink - no buzz. Would come back and try something else but definitely nothing to write home about. Oh...I had the chicken mole which was good.,3.0

"Walking by, it looked too fancy for a weekday meal, but I was drawn in by the sidewalk chalkboard promise of lunch specials.  The interior looked nice.  However once seated the actual list of lunch specials was a bit thin on actual meals... more like odd combos of individual items.  A taco + a tostada?  Well a tostada is pretty much a flat taco, so I don't get the pairing.I went with a chicken dish served with rice and beans, which the bartender said was probably the best choice if I wanted to eat a decent portion size.  Yay.  I was in the middle of a 3-hr walk and needed some fuel and liquids.Then I waited.  While sipping my tiny Mexican coke, trying not to finish it off before eating, I overheard the staff pitching other guests to try their hot sauces.  I would have liked to try some hot sauces, but noticed there were no chips being dispersed.  It was also during this no-food period that the bartender tried to entice me and others to buy their drink special... a lunch margarita for $9.  His value proposition was it was from a ""freshly tapped keg"" of margarita mix.  Yum.  But I explained I had work to do.  I didn't mention a disdain for pre-mixed margarita drinks, especially costing $9.  Finally my food arrived and they brought with it 2 salsas.  I'm guessing the chicken was roasted several hours beforehand because it was overcooked/dry - as if sitting in a steam table for too long.  And it was just the leg, about 1/5th of a broiled bird you'd get at a supermarket.  It was also void of anything tasting ""Mexican.""  The beans were decent and the rice was blah (but most rice is blah in combo meals).On the flip side, the salsa were amazing.  If only there were chips or tortillas or other salsa delivery methods one usually gets in a Mexican eatery.  A waste of product. Halfway through I was out of Coke and asked for water, which was served in a vessel not much bigger than a shot glass.  Again this wasn't offered but needed to be asked for.  It was then I noticed this pattern of style over substance.  Of putting up a facade rather than genuinely wanting to feed people.   Mexican food is about family and abundance and celebration.  Of serving your guests, not trying to extract from them.Unfortunately Chavela's, to me, is a place trying to act Mexican and nails it when it comes to salsas and tiles, but doesn't have the soul.  Like their margarita, they just aren't authentic.",2.0
"This place is amazing! Very cute Aztec/ Mexican like charm, delicious specialty margaritas, food spiced to perfection! Being from the west coast it was a pleasant experience in BK!

"Well, this was the first place I went to when I moved to this area about a month ago. The girlfriend recommended it as she's been here before, and man, I love me some Mexican food. I got the Milanesa Torta, which is a fried chicken cutlet, avocado, lettuce, and jalapeno mayo on a sandwich bun, and the girlfriend got Enchiladas, and we got guacamole for the side. The sandwich was amazing, and damn it, well I'm a sandwich guy. The chicken was the star, it was perfectly fried, but still so juicy and just so good, and the jalapeno mayo really just tied it together.  The enchiladas were great and came with rice and beans and they were really cheesy. The guacamole and chips on the side were really good, and the service was really fast, we got our food within 10 minutes of ordering (and thank god, because we were starving after moving in all my stuff). This place gets crowded super quick, as like...every day when I'm passing by around 7 after work, tons of people standing outside.

"Maybe it was the fun and festive Cinco de Mayo atmosphere or maybe this really is just a great restaurant, but this California native has finally found a Mexican restaurant I wouldn't be ashamed of recommending to my fellow Californians who really know their Mexican food! The decor was quirky and festive but still sophisticated. I was pleased that there was only about a 30 minute wait on Cinco de Mayo for a party of 4. We ordered a pitcher of red sangria, which was nice since it wasn't overly sweet and was still a little carbonated. We also got a pitcher of margaritas which was a little pricey at nearly $40 but they were good too and the cute little man (possibly the owner or manager) who brought over the salted glasses was so enthusiastic about it - he came over with the glasses singing ""Margariiiiitaaaaaas!!"" that I couldn't help but be excited also.We ordered the chicken mole tamale, elotes, guacamole and chips, and ceviche camarones for starters. The guac and elotes were definitely the stars here - guac was standard but I liked how they served it to you with a big flat tortilla round rather than just with regular chips. The elites (grilled corn) had a deliciously tangy and spicy chipotle mayo and some cotija cheese. The tamale had way too much masa and not enough chicken mole, and the shrimp ceviche was way too sweet - it was like they put straight up orange juice in there instead of lime. The mains were outstanding - we ordered the chicken flautas, baked tilapia, and plato Don. The flautas were super crispy and the chicken inside was moist and plentiful. The tilapia was so tender without losing its flaky texture and the tomatoey broth it was sitting in was so damn flavorful that every bite of tilapia was better than the last. The plato Don is HUGE, with lots of little dishes on this massive platter to build your own tacos including rice, beans, steak, chicken, and other toppings, and for only $13!? What a steal.And just when we thought we couldn't fit any more food in, we ordered both dessert items - arroz con leche (rice pudding) and the flan (custard). Both were good but the flan was outstanding. One thing I didn't appreciate, however, how overly confident our waitress was in her ability to remember the long list of menu items we ordered. We ordered a TON of food and she didn't write anything down; when we commented to her that she must have a good memory if she can remember all of that, she nodded blankly in agreement. She ended up forgetting 3 of the appetizers and only brought them out when we asked about them because at that point we'd already received our mains. Even after that, she never brought out the Ensalada Nopales we ordered but we had way too much food as is so we didn't bother to ask for it. I understand she was serving a ton of people on that busy day so her mind mind have been elsewhere, but honey, write that shit down. All in all, great experience here - I will certainly be back!",4.0
"Craving for Mexican can really, really, real. Was even willing to travel for some decent food. It was late afternoon and still packed with people and waited to be seated. We were sat in a communal table, but with barely room for space. The 2 parties adjacent to us were nice people but can imagine how close an annoying neighbor can be. Also slightly loud so don't expect a semi private audible conversation. Grapefruit Margarita:Was the special for the night and did not taste like grapefruit at all. Even the friends next to us agreed taste like pear. It had a tangy spicy salt rim but it was fun to lick.Chicken Quesadilla:It looked like a big empanada, quickly saddened expecting it to be bigger. We ordered a side of guac, the quesadilla was unmemorable but the guac added a nice tounge.Al Pastor Taco:Pretty good, better with the guac. Would recommend.Chicken Taco:Average, had way better.The bill came it didn't even feel semi worth it ....Moral of the story:Authentic Mexican is hard to come by and do not rely on the taste buds of hipsters. Sorry guys.",2.0
"Chavelas serves the best Mexican food in Crowne Heights. You cannot beat the authentic mexican food coupled with a margarita on draft. My favorite appetizers are the grilled corn with chipotle mayo and cotija cheese and the taquitos. For my entree I've gotten a plethora of quesadillas, tortas, enchiladas, flautas. Everything is extremely fresh and flavorful (I'm a cilantro addict). The service is fast and the waitstaff are friendly and more than willing to take the time to answer questions and make recommendations. The wait times can be a bit long on thursday through saturday nights, but it's definitely worth the wait.",4.0

"Wow! Chavela's literally left me without speech. Venturing from the Bronx, I was hoping I wouldn't be disappointed. BOY, was I NOT disappointed. First off, it's not as big as I thought, but it's comfy. The crowd is mixed and the atmosphere is perfect for your crew. The sangria is draft, yes draft and it is probably the best I have ever had. It's sweet and has just the right amount of liquor. I settled for the flautas and fell in love. Wow! Chavela's....marry me...Please?",5.0
"Food: amazing. Really great tacos - great deals during 4-7 happy hour. Brunch is even better; I had the eggs benedict and the dish was perfect. It came with yummy sweet bread, fruit juice of choice, some AWESOME potatoes, and a salad in the middle to top it all off. Not too expensive, either!Service: not bad, sometimes they get a little occupied and it might be a little bit between stops at tables, but over all I would give them a B+ or A-. Atmosphere: fun but not too loud - the decorations on the walls are great and it's very cool inside. Downsides: this place is always busy, almost every time I go. It might take you a bit to get a table (though they do have a nice side waiting room), and it always feels a little packed when sitting down to eat because the tables are so close together. That definitely doesn't outweigh the awesome food, though!",4.0

It's a tight spot to bring an infant to, but we managed to have their delicious food and fun times. Thank you for making it an eventful and fun evening for all of us especially my little one.",5.0
I've been here a few times for brunch. At $12 it's a good deal but I was never completely satisfied with the food until I ordered the BISTEC. A filet cooked to order over chorizo hash topped with an egg and verde salsa. Meat-lovers should definitely go for the steak since the other brunch dishes are light on meat.Great interior and atmosphere but it gets crowded. When I get the chance I'll visit for dinner and drinks with friends.,4.0
"Maybe it was the fun and festive Cinco de Mayo atmosphere or maybe this really is just a great restaurant, but this California native has finally found a Mexican restaurant I wouldn't be ashamed of recommending to my fellow Californians who really know their Mexican food! The decor was quirky and festive but still sophisticated. I was pleased that there was only about a 30 minute wait on Cinco de Mayo for a party of 4. We ordered a pitcher of red sangria, which was nice since it wasn't overly sweet and was still a little carbonated. We also got a pitcher of margaritas which was a little pricey at nearly $40 but they were good too and the cute little man (possibly the owner or manager) who brought over the salted glasses was so enthusiastic about it - he came over with the glasses singing ""Margariiiiitaaaaaas!!"" that I couldn't help but be excited also.We ordered the chicken mole tamale, elotes, guacamole and chips, and ceviche camarones for starters. The guac and elotes were definitely the stars here - guac was standard but I liked how they served it to you with a big flat tortilla round rather than just with regular chips. The elites (grilled corn) had a deliciously tangy and spicy chipotle mayo and some cotija cheese. The tamale had way too much masa and not enough chicken mole, and the shrimp ceviche was way too sweet - it was like they put straight up orange juice in there instead of lime. The mains were outstanding - we ordered the chicken flautas, baked tilapia, and plato Don. The flautas were super crispy and the chicken inside was moist and plentiful. The tilapia was so tender without losing its flaky texture and the tomatoey broth it was sitting in was so damn flavorful that every bite of tilapia was better than the last. The plato Don is HUGE, with lots of little dishes on this massive platter to build your own tacos including rice, beans, steak, chicken, and other toppings, and for only $13!? What a steal.And just when we thought we couldn't fit any more food in, we ordered both dessert items - arroz con leche (rice pudding) and the flan (custard). Both were good but the flan was outstanding. One thing I didn't appreciate, however, how overly confident our waitress was in her ability to remember the long list of menu items we ordered. We ordered a TON of food and she didn't write anything down; when we commented to her that she must have a good memory if she can remember all of that, she nodded blankly in agreement. She ended up forgetting 3 of the appetizers and only brought them out when we asked about them because at that point we'd already received our mains. Even after that, she never brought out the Ensalada Nopales we ordered but we had way too much food as is so we didn't bother to ask for it. I understand she was serving a ton of people on that busy day so her mind mind have been elsewhere, but honey, write that shit down. All in all, great experience here - I will certainly be back!",4.0
"Craving for Mexican can really, really, real. Was even willing to travel for some decent food. It was late afternoon and still packed with people and waited to be seated. We were sat in a communal table, but with barely room for space. The 2 parties adjacent to us were nice people but can imagine how close an annoying neighbor can be. Also slightly loud so don't expect a semi private audible conversation. Grapefruit Margarita:Was the special for the night and did not taste like grapefruit at all. Even the friends next to us agreed taste like pear. It had a tangy spicy salt rim but it was fun to lick.Chicken Quesadilla:It looked like a big empanada, quickly saddened expecting it to be bigger. We ordered a side of guac, the quesadilla was unmemorable but the guac added a nice tounge.Al Pastor Taco:Pretty good, better with the guac. Would recommend.Chicken Taco:Average, had way better.The bill came it didn't even feel semi worth it ....Moral of the story:Authentic Mexican is hard to come by and do not rely on the taste buds of hipsters. Sorry guys.",2.0
"Chavelas serves the best Mexican food in Crowne Heights. You cannot beat the authentic mexican food coupled with a margarita on draft. My favorite appetizers are the grilled corn with chipotle mayo and cotija cheese and the taquitos. For my entree I've gotten a plethora of quesadillas, tortas, enchiladas, flautas. Everything is extremely fresh and flavorful (I'm a cilantro addict). The service is fast and the waitstaff are friendly and more than willing to take the time to answer questions and make recommendations. The wait times can be a bit long on thursday through saturday nights, but it's definitely worth the wait.",4.0
"A little expensive, but still really good! Love the tacos.",4.0
"It's really nice having a place with vegan options and alcohol in the neighborhood. I like the tacos, beans and rice, guacamole, and the chips. What I don't like is the extremely watered-down and fake-tasting margaritas. Also, the seating is super cramped which makes it awkward when you have to enter exit or go to the bathroom.",3.0
"Wow! Chavela's literally left me without speech. Venturing from the Bronx, I was hoping I wouldn't be disappointed. BOY, was I NOT disappointed. First off, it's not as big as I thought, but it's comfy. The crowd is mixed and the atmosphere is perfect for your crew. The sangria is draft, yes draft and it is probably the best I have ever had. It's sweet and has just the right amount of liquor. I settled for the flautas and fell in love. Wow! Chavela's....marry me...Please?",5.0
"Food: amazing. Really great tacos - great deals during 4-7 happy hour. Brunch is even better; I had the eggs benedict and the dish was perfect. It came with yummy sweet bread, fruit juice of choice, some AWESOME potatoes, and a salad in the middle to top it all off. Not too expensive, either!Service: not bad, sometimes they get a little occupied and it might be a little bit between stops at tables, but over all I would give them a B+ or A-. Atmosphere: fun but not too loud - the decorations on the walls are great and it's very cool inside. Downsides: this place is always busy, almost every time I go. It might take you a bit to get a table (though they do have a nice side waiting room), and it always feels a little packed when sitting down to eat because the tables are so close together. That definitely doesn't outweigh the awesome food, though!",4.0

"Being from San Diego, I am very picky about my Mexican food.  For as great a food city as New York is, this is one of the cuisines where it consistently falls short.  Until now!  Chavela's is authentic, affordable Mexican in a really cool atmosphere.  If for some reason you don't like the food, the decorations will keep you entertained.  I knocked one star off because they charge for chips and salsa ( a veritable sin in my eyes), but my entree made up for it.  Try the plato don carne!  It's huge and definitely sharable, making the meal under $10!  I'll definitely be back for the good service and great taste of home.",4.0
"Was my 3rd time here-for dinner around 6pm on Sat. Brunch isn't that great. I eat Mexican/Cal-Mex/Tex-Mex all the time, the food is just not that good or worth the price. The portions are small and bland and the quality of the drinks are inconsistent. My husband and I were rushed through dinner by thee server. While the host and hostess were helpful, the servers were aggressively rushing our meal. My husband said he felt robbed. we felt neglected and there was no effort to explain the menu-disappointment.

"Chavelas is controversial albeit very popular. When I walked by on my way to Gueros last week about 5PM it was packed and same thing on Thursday- packed. Now, it is happy hour, but many were just eating. So that says something and the food here is cheap which also speaks to popularity.The seating here is cramped and close- not my favorite, but the food rocks with some misteps.Ordered:Trio of salsas- $3Tortilla soup- $5]Flautas w/rice and beans $11(I think)Side of guac.Firstly, the bottle of water on the table is warm- it is just weird on a hot night to serve warmish water. Loved the trio- green, red & pico were all yum plus the round fresh tortillas. Tortilla soup with a drizzle of crema also super tasty. Flautas one chicken and two potaot were tasty, but really loved the rice and beans- reddish rice, black beans were dam near perfect. Side of guac. was a little thin and didn't have the limey spicy punch of Gueros. People love this spot though. Great loo with ceramic sink with Mexican tiles. Decoratively this place rocks if you are skinny enough to fit! P.S. Crown Heights is the new something, not Williamsburg!",4.0
"The place has good atmosphere, a friendly staff and decent, reasonably priced Mexican food. Love the fish tacos, chips with 3 salsas, tamales.  What they are missing is a solid, classic margarita! The other downside to this place is that they are trying to turn tables super fast and i always feel a bit rushed eating there. You are chewing your last bite and the bus boy rips the plate out from under you. It's a bit of a downer. Other than that, the place is great and make you want to come back,",3.0
"Sub-par food in an overly crowded (think, sardines in a can) atmosphere. After the hostess informed us of a 20 minute wait, we walked up and down the block returning exactly 12 minutes later.... and we waited, and waited only to learn the hostess had already gave away our table. Really?If you, like me- are a chips & salsa aficianado/-aholic you should know that this establishment doesn't believe in complimentary chips & salsa, a dealbreaker  in my book.My bf's food came out, literally, within 2-3 minutes (my food nowhere in sight). Definitely a bad sign. His Plato Don was served cold... not warm, not room temperature, but cold. (he never complains though, which is why he's a keeper) Just as he was nearly done scarfing down his cold & overly seasoned carne, my order was brought to the table. My tortilla soup was different, with a surprisingly tangy twist (tomatillo based). Although laden with three days worth of the FDA's RDA of sodium, I'd have another bowl of this any day.Honestly? Never again.",1.0
"Put a slightly above-average Mexican restaurant in the heart of Crown Heights, trade in a standard bar for a highfalutin specialty drink menu and man it with attractive staff (hello Mr. Genetically Superior Bartender) and you've got what it takes to hypnotize even the most Elite among us.Chavela's is a nice neighborhood spot with good food, decent happy hour (note: they don't have a full bar), and a very loyal following.  I arrived to meet friends for a  drink and a bit of a nosh around 7pm on a Tuesday and found the restaurant packed. We sat at the bar and chopped it up a bit with the (aforementioned aesthetically pleasing) bartender who was friendly, but slightly condescending to members of my party.  I ordered the sangria (which was tasty) and the guacamole appetizer (which was tiny) and both were reasonably priced.  My bill which included a couple of drinks, guac appetizer and tip came in around $30.I had a solid 3 star experience and if I'm being truthful I strongly believe that if Chavela's resided in a different neighborhood some of its reviews would be a bit more discerning.  My advice, as Public Enemy so eloquently put it, ""don't believe the hype.

"IMPORTANT PRO TIP: The week-day lunch special is a good deal, and ends at 4pm when happy hour begins. So come at 3:45 and order, then when your food comes start ordering drinks. If you're still hungry you can get $2.00 happy hour tacos.Breakfast is GREAT and comes with these pastries but it's BUSY.For dinner: Order Elotes Callajeros (corn w. chipolte mayo and conjita cheese) appetizer, and Pescado a la Veracruzana. You will be eat the best corn you've ever had (that doesn't come from an food truck in Redhook). Then you'll eat a main course of the most delicious fish you've ever had, wrapped in a banana leaf, smothered in a rice and vegetable medley where every single ingredient melts into the other in a savory caramelized dream sauce, and you can't figure out what is in your mouth, but you can't stop putting it in your mouth. It is almost... creamy. Eating that food is like eating food after smoking pot but you're not actually high. How do they do that.",4.0

Great spot no matter the size of your group they usually can get people in fairly quickly although they do get busy quite often - expect a short wait. But again, VERY much worth the trip.",5.0

From all the reviews I read, I figure maybe I came here on an off day. I am a lover of mexican food ( no tex-mex yuck lol) So the tacos are decently priced. Average price for tacos anywhere in the city. However, they lacked something : the taste was way off. I compare my mexican food to the mexican food i eat off the mexican carts in the city or at my new fav restaurant in east harlem. These tacos were so bland.

"Went here a month ago, Chavela's is still leaving an impression. Solid Mexican food! One of the few places that actually have flautas, sopas, and other goodies. Great Micheladas, even though the waitress had plenty of attitude when asking which beer (and changing her facial expression when I wanted a dark one). The staff might not be the best in town but the delicacies make up for it. And we were still served in a timely manner, so no complaints here (if only the attitude could have been a little bit... more humane!). Other than that, I enjoyed my dinner and am eager to check out their lunch special one of these days. Perhaps I will even go with a super-spicy version, just like in real Mehiko!",4.0

"I come here often for Brunch. When coming to Chavelas, Be prepared to wait and feeling cramped and maybe a little overwhelmed. But trust me the food is all worth it. The last few times I have gone, I enjoyed the Eggless Don Plato which is a good size mix platter for one of all Mexican deliciousness they have to offer, It comes with fresh hot tortillas, chiquilles, guacamole, mole, pick de gallo and a spicy potato thing that brings it all home. They can definetly work on the service part, but the food is so good.

"Went here a month ago, Chavela's is still leaving an impression. Solid Mexican food! One of the few places that actually have flautas, sopas, and other goodies. Great Micheladas, even though the waitress had plenty of attitude when asking which beer (and changing her facial expression when I wanted a dark one). The staff might not be the best in town but the delicacies make up for it. And we were still served in a timely manner, so no complaints here (if only the attitude could have been a little bit... more humane!). Other than that, I enjoyed my dinner and am eager to check out their lunch special one of these days. Perhaps I will even go with a super-spicy version, just like in real Mehiko!",4.0
"Went on a Saturday evening as a group of six.  Service was great but the space is cramped.  The food was lackluster, or maybe it was just really subtle.  All the dishes had good texture and were well presented but the it's like all the flavors were washed out.  We all ordered and shared bites of different things, and really no one was impressed.  Nothing bad, but when you pay for food you expect something better than average.",3.0
"I come here often for Brunch. When coming to Chavelas, Be prepared to wait and feeling cramped and maybe a little overwhelmed. But trust me the food is all worth it. The last few times I have gone, I enjoyed the Eggless Don Plato which is a good size mix platter for one of all Mexican deliciousness they have to offer, It comes with fresh hot tortillas, chiquilles, guacamole, mole, pick de gallo and a spicy potato thing that brings it all home.

"First of all, this is a mexican RESTAURANT, not just a taco place. That means the tacos AND everything else is really good, so don't just order your standard tacos, burrito, flautas, etc. Be adventurous and you won't be disappointed! On the brunch menu: My vegetarian  friend ordered the 'eggless plato don'. As a meat-eater, even I was jealous of her impressively large selection of yummy toppings!I ordered the bistec, medium well done, with a sunny side egg on top. My meat was *perfect* and tender... incredible. It also came on top of delicious potato hash and a delicious salsa verde. My other friend ordered a torta, which I took a bite out of. The bread was so fresh that I'm convinced it must've been baked in house. All brunch items were $11.50, plus juice/tea/coffee and we received two plates of complimentary pastries - a buttery croissant and a sweet bun, wrapped in sugared flakey pastry. A small price to pay for a delicious meal, great setting, and service. We left very happy campers.

The place is cute and if you can don't sit in the sets against the wall. Opt for the highboy seating or the bar because you will be in EVERYONE's conversation. I mean, really. I actually need to plan to go out with this person again because we were only a few inches away from the other people sitting next to us. It kind of seemed like they were trying to really pack people in. If they got rid of two tables it would be way more comfortable. That being said, the food is good, it's a little weird because a lot of things are a la carte when there should be an option to make a platter. I even saw a diner's platter that had so much stuff and was mad the server didn't offer that to me. Meh. I've had the enchiladas, quesadillas, churros, rice and beans and guac. The Jaimaca juice (sorrel) is good as well. In all the dishes were pretty good, not amazing (I'm from Chicago where Mexican food is king!)The service is ok.

"Came here for brunch with my boyfriend recently. It was packed but we were seated quickly by a friendly, polite hostess.I ordered some tortillas with salsa as an appetizer, and the huevos divorciados (2 fried eggs, tomatillo or ranchero salsa, potato hash and refried beans). This came with a bun of their sweet bread. The food was a little too spicy for me, and not the tastiest brunch I have ever had, but I am giving them 5 stars because their service was fantastic. The hostess who seated us was friendly, our waitress was responsive and served us with a smile. During my meal, I watched some of their busboys working and was impressed by how diligent they were. They were very quick and effective. Seating was a little cramped - if you are seated on the bench along the wall, you will have to move the table to get out, even if you are extremely skinny. I was seated on the bench, and when the woman next to me was leaving, one of the bus boys rushed over to help move the table for her. The same one also rushed over to move our table when I got up to leave, even though my boyfriend was already moving the table. Again, phenomenal service, with a smile! Even though I am not crazy about their food, I definitely want to come back for such excellent service.",5.0
"Oh my, this place is amazing! I go to school on the other side of Eastern Parkway so I am always venturing around the area to find some good eats.

Boy was it good!The restaurant was very busy for 12 pm on a Wednesday afternoon but nonetheless, I was able to secure a seat at the bar. My waiter was sweet and so were the hosts. I settled down in this cozy spanish joint the minute I took my seat, it has a very warm vibe to it. The decor was also very beautiful and inviting. Onto the good part though...the food.There isn't that many veggie options but there are a few. I had a Del Jardin (Zucchini) 'Torta' (a Mexican street sandwich with according to the menu) which was the bomb.com. It was very flavorful, filling, and simply delicious! I washed it down with a virgin sangria that was given to me with the cutest jar-glass. The best part--my total was only about $9. Sweet!I will def be back.",5.0

"Truly a gem of a restaurant. Not only for a Mexican restaurant in New York City in general.....but on Franklin Ave. in Crown Heights in particular! This is NOT your typical traditional Mexican joint, but a truly authentic gourmet experience. Where many of the dishes you really won't find anywhere else in NY. Excellent for vegetarians...try the nopales! The mole is superb. And for those who like spice, don't forget to try the fresh habanero sauce....amazing (but beware!)",5.0
I mostly go here for happy hour which is great! 5 dollar margaritas (amazing) and 2 and 3 dollar tacos. My favorite taco is the fish taco. The ambiance is also engaging. I constantly find myself looking around at the dressed up skeleton by the bar. The only thing missing is outdoor seating which is a very small miss.,4.0
"Came here for brunch with my boyfriend recently. It was packed but we were seated quickly by a friendly, polite hostess.I ordered some tortillas with salsa as an appetizer, and the huevos divorciados (2 fried eggs, tomatillo or ranchero salsa, potato hash and refried beans). This came with a bun of their sweet bread. The food was a little too spicy for me, and not the tastiest brunch I have ever had, but I am giving them 5 stars because their service was fantastic. The hostess who seated us was friendly, our waitress was responsive and served us with a smile. During my meal, I watched some of their busboys working and was impressed by how diligent they were. They were very quick and effective. Seating was a little cramped - if you are seated on the bench along the wall, you will have to move the table to get out, even if you are extremely skinny. I was seated on the bench, and when the woman next to me was leaving, one of the bus boys rushed over to help move the table for her. The same one also rushed over to move our table when I got up to leave, even though my boyfriend was already moving the table. Again, phenomenal service, with a smile! Even though I am not crazy about their food, I definitely want to come back for such excellent service.",5.0
"Oh my, this place is amazing! I go to school on the other side of Eastern Parkway so I am always venturing around the area to find some good eats. Last week I decided to eat at Chavela's after doing a yelp search for good Mexican. Boy was it good!The restaurant was very busy for 12 pm on a Wednesday afternoon but nonetheless, I was able to secure a seat at the bar. My waiter was sweet and so were the hosts. I settled down in this cozy spanish joint the minute I took my seat, it has a very warm vibe to it. The decor was also very beautiful and inviting. Onto the good part though...the food.There isn't that many veggie options but there are a few. I had a Del Jardin (Zucchini) 'Torta' (a Mexican street sandwich with according to the menu) which was the bomb.com. It was very flavorful, filling, and simply delicious! I washed it down with a virgin sangria that was given to me with the cutest jar-glass. The best part--my total was only about $9. Sweet!I will def be back.",5.0

It was, though, missing a lot of the raw, dirty explosion of flavor that comes from an amazing out-of-this-world torta. (This version is healthier, I suppose.) Flor de la calabaza quesadilla was good though the ""shell"" seemed a bit overly crunchy / overcooked, and almost seemed more empanada like. Oh and the sangrias are f*cking AWESOME.For the best Mexican food in NYC, try Tortilleria Nixtamal in Corona, Queens.

"Don't order the pitcher of margaritas. Not realizing that they come from a tap, we ordered it, and it was the worst margarita I've ever tasted. Sweet, pineapple-y, somehow thick, even though it was on the rocks. Just...totally disgusting.The food was pretty good, though. Had the fried fish tacos and the carne tacos - both tasty. If I ever return, I'll definitely go with one of their craft drinks.It was really busy and kinda cramped, but our server was nice. Overall, this place is just ok, but maybe worth another shot.",3.0
"Their portion is huge and price is very reasonable for the kind of ambiance they are providing. We were there on a search for good dinner and found this place with other yelpie recommendation. The place is small and has to be seat close to other group but don't get me wrong. There are plenty space that you won't be bouncing between people. In the end, imagine it's a manhattan restaurant in the middle of the most ghetto area in brooklyn. you are paying the manhattan price too. I would come again cuz their food is good and the dating ambiance.",4.0

"Some of the best, authentic Mexican food that I've had.  I had the Plato Don and it was absolutely fantastic!  The horchata was good as well, but be sure to stir it up.  The salsas were great as well.  Definitely going back next time I'm in the city.",5.0
"Great Mexican happy hour! I had the chicken mole, bistek and salsa trio all for $6. The meat was well seasoned and tender and I was happy with the tortilla chips. Mouth is watering while I write. The margarita was not made to order, but still got me ""warm"" enough for the frigid walk. I'll try the Michelada next time.

Where to start. We were seated promptly as the place was not too crowded. The waiter took quite some time to come and take our order. We finally flagged down someone who woks there and ordered drinks as well as food. The margarita did not taste great but the red sangria with lemonade was delicious. I ordered the shrimp in Mexican sauce. The shrimp was edible but the peppers were not cooked all the way and the seeds were still left in some pepper pieces. The yellow rice and black beans were pretty good. My friend ordered the beef and chicken taco mix plate. It was pretty good. The waiter was rushing to take our plate although the place was empty. I didn't understand the rush when they took forever to take our order. Also the elote was drenched in a sauce and barely had cheese. It tasted like a boiled corn on the cob drenched in a tangy sauce.  Overall not a great experience. Stuck to the sangria and some tacos for happy hour.,2.0

"I've only been to this place once, but I really enjoyed it.I made it just in time for the Monday through Thursday, 4-7p happy hour perks. The tacos are just 2$ and they are delicious.

Definitely looking forward to trying their pescado taco next time. Margaritas are only 6$ and sangria is only 5$. Beers are 3$. The margaritas are pretty strong and large, worth the 6$ if you typically enjoy them.I really loved the decor and atmosphere of this establishment. Felt as if I wasn't in Brooklyn anymore, just took a quick trip to dine in Mexico. Beautiful plants and tile patterns all around. The prices are extremely reasonable, even when it isn't happy hour.

"On Saturday, about six of my fellow New York Mexican Food Lovers' and I headed to Brooklyn for our monthly meetup.  Chavela's, a Mexican restaurant in Crown Heights, had been on my short list of ""must try's"" for what seemed like eternity.  And, believe me, it was well worth the wait!As we turned the corner towards the restaurant, I was a bit horrified by the amount of people loitering outside.  But, hey, what better sign that we were in for a delicious treat than a sizeable crowd of hungry patrons?Even with an incomplete party, the hosts were very flexible and told us that we could wait off to the side or, should seats open up at the bar, make ourselves comfortable.  And, wouldn't you believe, four bar stools became vacant within minutes...After ordering a fizzy margarita (they're on tap!), we split some appetizers:  Trio of salsas and crispy whole tortillas (weird concept - chips would have been ideal), Tostadas (one with avocado, one with chorizo & potato), and Queso Fundido (peppers, onions, refried beans, Oaxaca cheese, and chorizo - served with warm, griddled corn tortillas).  While everything was tasty, the dish that I would recommend and/or re-order upon my return would be the Tostadas.  Namely the avocado version.For me, the true testament of a good Mexican restaurant lies within their enchiladas.  Or their hard-shelled beef tacos.  For my entree, I ordered the cheese enchiladas with mole sauce and double rice, no beans.   It was my first bite of the enchiladas that, truly, sealed the deal.  Warm and gooey melted Oaxaca cheese was wrapped within mole-smothered corn tortillas.  And, while the other components were spot-on, it was the mole that took these particular enchiladas to a whole other level.  Smoky, sweet, and savory - with a faint kick of spice - the sauce was, easily, the best version I've had in NYC.  And the rice?  Perfect.  Just like home.When I think about Chavela's, I become giddy and restless.  Because of they carry tequila *and* have a kick ass atmosphere - in addition to the awesome food - I think that Chavela's just may be my favorite Mexican restaurant in NYC!",4.0

Other than that, it was a great experience and I can't wait to return!UPDATE (7.23.14): I visited Chavela's again for take out and unfortunately had to remove a star from my previous rating. I ordered the ""lunch special"" of a 1/2 chicken, rice, & beans and was left rather unsatisfied. Aside from the ridiculously small portion of rice & beans, the chicken was dry and plain. I was quite shocked because of the amazing experience I had before but no restaurant is perfect so I'd just suggest  steering clear of take-out lunch option.",3.0

"Awesome spot for brunch!The french toast was insanely good.  Think thick cut texas style toast, but with a carmelization  and crispyness of the deep dish pizza at pizza hut.  topped with fresh strawberries, raspberries, and blue berries.  Inside there were parts that seamed like they were injected with a creme anglais, to add to the decadence.  The huevos rancheros were solid, but not as mind blowing as the french toast.

Experience approx. 2 weeks ago:  Pretty underwhelming but passable.  They added this little side area so you can grab a drink without being crammed into the main room like a sardine.  Which is nice, since you can relax, grab a drink or five, and start catching a buzz in preparation for the boring food and baffling service.  We started with chips and guacamole, which could've come from the bodega down the street.  Just because your chips come in baby-tortilla form doesn't mean they don't suck.  But before we could get started on our boring ass appetizer...our entrees arrived!  Yup, all of our food, all at once.  Normally, I'm stoked to get my food quickly but this was disconcerting.  Not even Mexican food should be made this fast.  Now, I realize this might seem trivial to some and I sorta agree; what's wrong with the dudes in the kitchen hammering out your food at breakneck speed?  I don't mind too much, but for those of you looking for a nice little dining experience, don't say I didn't warn you.  All of your bland food might come out at once, approximately 3 minutes after you order it.   Tonight's experience:  Not really sure what to make of this.  The service and treatment was confusing and bizarre from the moment we walked in until we were basically force-fed the check.  We came in from the rain and I asked the TWO hostesses (because you need two people to do one job poorly): ""What's the wait for two people?""  *crickets*  All I get is silence.  They both look at me like I'm a fucking space alien.  They continue with their deer-in-headlights staredown until finally, one of them snaps out of her daze and sheepishly mutters something, grabs two menus and walks me to my table.  It was so confusing and weird I don't even know what else to say.  We ordered some food...whatever, it's not important, it was edible but not in any way noteworthy.  Our server comes by and asks if we want dessert.  We politely decline and he walks off...only to return 10 seconds later with the check.  Dude, we both have drinks we're still working on.  I was planning on getting a beer.  Not that it should matter, but there's plenty of seating available.  But fine, I'll pay when I'm damn well good and ready.  Nope.  Try again.  Because LITERALLY 5 seconds after our server sets the bill down, some random employee I've never seen tries to take it.  Jesus Christ is the kitchen secretly on fire?  Is a fucking mob hit about to go down?  What's the goddamn rush?  Before I could let all of this really sink in, our server walks by 1 minute later and tries taking the check again.  That's it, mission accomplished, Chavela's...now I can't wait to the get the hell out of here.  So, I don't think I'll be back again.  There are too many restaurants in Brooklyn (hell, even just on Franklin) that are happy to have your business, employ sentient greeters/pleasant waitstaff and aren't trying to force you out the door.  I could honestly write a dissertation on how badly this place sucks.  I didn't even have to pull that tired ""As a Mexican from LA..."" card.  Chavela's crappy food/service stands on its own.",2.0

"If there is anything to complain about at this place, it's the fact that the seats are a bit close together. The restaurant isn't very big, and they try to accomodate the most people, and they do a decent job, but it would be nice to have some more room. The food here though is splendid, and cheap. It's like, taco truck prices in an actual restaurant setting. I had a couple of tacos (chicken and carne asada) as well as a tinga quesadilla. Everything was super flavorful and the service was great. Honestly, the prices alone would explain why this place is always packed, but the food is actually good, so that works out. Definitely a good spot in the area if you're looking for good Mexican food on the cheap.",4.0

"Pretty much perfection!!! Food was delicious. Had the avocado and mole tostadas to start. Both were flavorful especially with the hot sauce--warning, it's HOT. I had avocado, grilled veggies, and tilapia tacos. Some of the best I've had in new York. My bf had potato flautas which I stole a bite of and really liked. Food was really good and I'll be back. Only one star off because it was pretty loud and crowded.",4.0
"I got the chilaquiles at brunch and while it was fine, with some tasty tomatillo, I thought $11.95 was an awful lot to pay for an egg, beans, some tortillas, and sauce. Service was generally very good, although weirdly my Mexican soda came just in a bottle (when I later asked for a straw I also got a glass and ice though, so that was rectified).Very cute decor that's nice to sit in, and I'd like to try some of their other dishes. I probably would enjoy those more than the brunch options because really I feel that brunch is just about removing the meat from the meal and replacing it with eggs, which is obviously a bad idea. It's you + me 4ever, lunch.",3.0
"I went here for lunch and was pleasantly surprised. I had the Lunch Special Duo Fish Taco & Tostada which was delish! It tasted very fresh and was certainly the best Mexican food I've had in quite a while. My only minor (and I do emphasize minor) complaint would be the seating...we were placed in a corner which felt a bit cramped. Other than that, it was a great experience and I can't wait to return!UPDATE (7.23.14): I visited Chavela's again for take out and unfortunately had to remove a star from my previous rating. I ordered the ""lunch special"" of a 1/2 chicken, rice, & beans and was left rather unsatisfied. Aside from the ridiculously small portion of rice & beans, the chicken was dry and plain. I was quite shocked because of the amazing experience I had before but no restaurant is perfect so I'd just suggest  steering clear of take-out lunch option.",3.0

"Awesome spot for brunch!The french toast was insanely good.  Think thick cut texas style toast, but with a carmelization  and crispyness of the deep dish pizza at pizza hut.  topped with fresh strawberries, raspberries, and blue berries.  Inside there were parts that seamed like they were injected with a creme anglais, to add to the decadence.  The huevos rancheros were solid, but not as mind blowing as the french toast.

"Having tried Chavela's in its old, cramped quarters, I had been eagerly awaiting its expansion.

My table started with the guacamole, which was well seasoned and freshly made, albeit on the small side for the price, and the trio of salsas (salsa verde, smoking hot chipotle salsa, and fresh pico de gallo)  served with crispy tortillas (essentially a friend soft taco shell), which were an interesting take on the standard chip. I ordered three different tacos--the Bistec, which consisted of grilled steak in a tasty marinade with grilled onions, and cilantro chipotle salsa; the Carne Enchilada with grilled pork with cilantro, pineapple and habanero salsa, which once again seems to be an Al Pastor taco mislabeled since it isn't that spicy and contains pineapple; and the Pescado, with an unidentified piece of grilled fish, purple cabbage, pico de gallo, and chipotle salsa, which was quite substantial. Although I enjoyed the newly available Sangria de la casa (previously, only wine, beer, and soda were available at ""Chavelita's""), I found it a little strange that it and the basic margaritas are on draft, and I'm not sure that the bar from which they were procured needed to take up quite so much space.  If you live near Prospect Heights and can find a time to get here when it's not mobbed, by all means do so, but I think I am going to stick to Sunset Park for cheaper and tastier tacos, the procurement of which  don't require such a rigamarole.",3.0

A heavenly balance of sweet and savory. I could put it on just about anything. I'm guessing the only reason they don't sell it by the jar is because they'd run out every night thanks to people like me. I'm also a huge fan of their brunch, particularly the eggless plato don. I feel like such a baller when I order this thing. It comes out on a giant tray with maybe 6-8 smaller trays on top. It's what vegetarian mob bosses would eat, if such a person existed.Lastly, the place makes some mean drinks. The standard margarita and sangria on tap are both solid and affordable. There's a drink made with beet juice I also dig. Take away the food, and Chavela's would still make for a totally great bar.",5.0

"It seemed like it took them years to finally open up, but it was well worth the wait.  The decor is ridiculously quaint and inviting.  I just remember thinking  that I wish there was a secret little room where I could kick back and read Like Water for Chocolate. We came at the very tail end of happy hour and had one $5 margarita.  I'm not sure if die hard margarita fans would enjoy them.  They are very sweet and seem to be carbonated, but I really liked them, so much that we ordered a pitcher.  The waitress told us it would yield about 5 drinks but when she plopped down the huge pitcher we knew that was impossible, so we decided to count the true number of servings and in the end we counted about 8 glasses.  It's bigger than the previous location but the space is really tight. The tables are pretty close together so get ready to make new friends quickly.  The service was friendly, fast, and attentive.  We ended up staying for about 4 hours (partly because we struggled drinking the pitcher) and they never tried to rush us out of the door, in fact, they didn't put the check down until we finished our drinks.  I appreciated that.Now on to the food. It  is very reasonably priced.  We started off with salsa and guacamole.  The guac was just ok.  I was expecting a more crisp, fresh taste, but it was pretty bland.  My friend had the Plato Don , which is essentially a make your own taco spread that comes with chicken, steak and your regular fixin's for $13.  I had the chicken enchilada with mole and it came with a side of rice and beans for $9.50. The food is good, but not great, however the service, atmosphere, and proximity to my home makes it kinda perfect.",4.0
"Went here for brunch the other day and had a very nice time with friends. The staff are friendly and when we went at 12:30, there was no wait.The food is pretty good.

Their grilled veggie frittata only had green peppers and onions though, which I thought was a bit meager but it was still good. For $12 per person for some grub + coffee/tea you should definitely go! One thing I'd add is that we felt a bit rushed at points. For instance, the bus boys took away the guys' baked goods before they were even done. I was a bit sad about that since I was happily nibbling away at them and they were delicious. I guess I should be happy too since they spared me the calories? I'm torn.",4.0

Whether you choose to check it or not does not matter, because that means there will be more CHAVELAS for me :) See you Saturday!",5.0
"Nice Mexican food and a good sangria margarita mixed drink. Packed, clearly popular! Would go again",4.0
"The Franklin Ave game-changer. Chavela's is an embarrassment of riches. If there's a single thing that keeps me coming back, it's the mole. Good god, the mole. A heavenly balance of sweet and savory. I could put it on just about anything. I'm guessing the only reason they don't sell it by the jar is because they'd run out every night thanks to people like me. I'm also a huge fan of their brunch, particularly the eggless plato don. I feel like such a baller when I order this thing. It comes out on a giant tray with maybe 6-8 smaller trays on top. It's what vegetarian mob bosses would eat, if such a person existed.Lastly, the place makes some mean drinks. The standard margarita and sangria on tap are both solid and affordable. There's a drink made with beet juice I also dig. Take away the food, and Chavela's would still make for a totally great bar.",5.0
"This place rocks! Hard. Awesome food, good prices. excellent flavor, serving sizes fill you up quick, awesome drinks and good service. Don't forget the all-important clean bathroom. I'm definite going back, great ambience!",4.0
"It seemed like it took them years to finally open up, but it was well worth the wait.  The decor is ridiculously quaint and inviting.  I just remember thinking  that I wish there was a secret little room where I could kick back and read Like Water for Chocolate. We came at the very tail end of happy hour and had one $5 margarita.  I'm not sure if die hard margarita fans would enjoy them.  They are very sweet and seem to be carbonated, but I really liked them, so much that we ordered a pitcher.  The waitress told us it would yield about 5 drinks but when she plopped down the huge pitcher we knew that was impossible, so we decided to count the true number of servings and in the end we counted about 8 glasses.  It's bigger than the previous location but the space is really tight. The tables are pretty close together so get ready to make new friends quickly.  The service was friendly, fast, and attentive.  We ended up staying for about 4 hours (partly because we struggled drinking the pitcher) and they never tried to rush us out of the door, in fact, they didn't put the check down until we finished our drinks.  I appreciated that.Now on to the food. It  is very reasonably priced.  We started off with salsa and guacamole.  The guac was just ok.  I was expecting a more crisp, fresh taste, but it was pretty bland.  My friend had the Plato Don , which is essentially a make your own taco spread that comes with chicken, steak and your regular fixin's for $13.  I had the chicken enchilada with mole and it came with a side of rice and beans for $9.50. The food is good, but not great, however the service, atmosphere, and proximity to my home makes it kinda perfect.",4.0
"Went here for brunch the other day and had a very nice time with friends. The staff are friendly and when we went at 12:30, there was no wait.The food is pretty good. My husband is Mexican and an amazing cook, so their chilaquiles don't beat his but they're not bad. The salad was fresh and crisp. Their grilled veggie frittata only had green peppers and onions though, which I thought was a bit meager but it was still good. For $12 per person for some grub + coffee/tea you should definitely go! One thing I'd add is that we felt a bit rushed at points. For instance, the bus boys took away the guys' baked goods before they were even done. I was a bit sad about that since I was happily nibbling away at them and they were delicious. I guess I should be happy too since they spared me the calories? I'm torn.",4.0
"I've lived in Brookyln for two and a half years, and I make a wonderful taco since I learned 4 years ago from a Mexican community down-south, and I've gotten tacos in about 30 places throughout BK and MH, and yesterday I ordered Chavela's for takeout, and it's obviously the best Mexican food that I've had here.I got the Carne Plato Don and added avocado.",5.0
"How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.......I've been a steadfast chavela's disciple since their days on classon ave. Catch me during a busy work week and you'll also catch me getting take out every night. Nothing is bad. In fact, nothing is even just OK. It's always double yum, and fresh. Portions are big, prices are not. They say 30 minutes for delivery but it never takes even half that long, and eating in is a pleasure too. Great decor, very diverse and funky crowd, and friendly service runs like a well oiled machine. Two thumbs up and a high five to chavela's.",5.0

"4.5 stars for dinner, 3.5 for brunch, so 4 stars.  Flavorful food, but no heart really.My girlfriend and I love Mexican food, especially brunch.  Burritos are great, but we want some really good food with true depth of flavor, a bit of heat, avocado/guac, and why not a good drink or two.  So given these, we drove (well I did) from Long Island City to Chavela's twice in the last month.It's a decent sized place, with a wait both times we came.  The place itself is pretty nice, with a lot of well-laid decor.  Some of it could be a bit over the top, but it's a nice spot all told.Dinner - I had a steak tortas, was really nice, one of the best I've ever had, 4.5 stars.  Yummy bun, juicy steak, good sauces, beans on the side., I was happy.  She got some Flautas and was really happy with it.  Our margaritas were pretty nice too but a bit small, at least not worth getting another round.  Net we were really happy and wanted to come back for brunch.For brunch this Saturday morning, we arrived at 12ish and waited for 20 minutes, no problem,  We both got the prix fixe menu - I got the huevas Divociados - it was okay but not a lot of food.  The refried beans were subpar, the sauces were pretty good, the potatoes were okay - maybe 3.5 stars for my food.  She got the chilaquiles which were deconstructed, meaning she took 15 minutes longer to eat than I did as she had to manually put together each bite to be a match.  The ingredients were fine, but it was just annoying to her to assemble and felt a bit pretentious for Mexican food. 3.5 stars.Net net it's good food and worth the wait, but the food doesn't always have a lot of soul, worth a visit.",4.0

"I love this place! Just stumbled in on a walk around the neighborhood, I'm trying to decide where I should move in January. I heard from friends I needed to try lunch at Chavela's and have their specialty Don Pepino (spicy, refreshing and perfect for an afternoon cocktail! A healthy tasting TGIF cocktail, especially since I have Fridays off #Johnthebartender!)I ordered the pollo al horno, it was juicy chicken with yellow rice and black beans, a side of salsa verde (mmmmmm) and I got some of their habanero sauce, which comes with a warning of its spiciness, dabs will do the trick!The best part is that I took some of it to go, because the portions are amazing #keepthebuzzgoing and my bill was under 20$!!! WOW! Top quality, top service and I am definitely going to be a repeat offender here!I went in on a Friday afternoon and got to meet Mike, Shannon, Lisa and let me quickly compliment the incredible service, brightness of attitude and attentiveness to patrons. Way way way beyond what I expected. Also John, the Friday lunch bartender, is great.I would give another star if I could, but anybody looking for some good Fri afternoon eats and drinks, take it from this apartment hunting yelper- stop by Chavela's!!",5.0
"Listen, they got me so far. Andrew and rest of staff rock. Although waiting it was made very pleasant for us plus the drinks.

I have talked to friends and people there that give the meat options 3 thumbs up. Plus drinks are stronger than you think.I will be back to try the brunch and see if I can increase my review.

"This place is great! Thank GOD they opened a new one with tons of space. I went to the original one once and was too uncomfortable to really enjoy my experience, but I have ordered from there several times because the food is so yummy. Also, this place has a full bar! I indulged and got two margaritas, only $5 at happy hour, and I was perfectly tipsy upon leaving.Really good service too, food came out really fast. Other than the screaming hipster children next to me on both sides, It was a great experience! Will definitely return.",4.0
Okay the best margaritas I've ever had period.  I had the mango margarita as well as the tamarind margarita which sounds kinda weird but it's delicious! 2 margaritas later my friend and I were stumbling lol. Their fish tacos were okay nothing crazy but go here for great drinks!,5.0
"The awning for the new Chavella's on Franklin had been up for months and months before it opened. On a stretch of restaurants without any Mexican, it certainly was a site for sore eyes.

I don't have the answer to this question, but I did eat there.Similar to Chavella's other location, the food here is adequate. Nothing mind blowing, nothing awful. Decent. The guacamole still comes with the option of tostada-sized chips or mini-tortillas. The elotes were hot and sweet. The tacos tasted slightly dry, but fairly tasty. And I liked the idea of a Manhattan made with tequila, but the taste was a little bit weird.Again, like the original, the pace is a bit frantic.

If you're not in a hearty mood - go for the eggless plato don... but its certainly not ""lighter"" -- you'll get a stand and a humongous platter of refried beans, grilled veggies, and various spreads and a pile of corn tortillas to experiment with.

I ordered the Pollo Don, based on a few Yelpers recommendation. I ended up throwing away the dry chicken & the dry steak. It was pretty bad. The chickens texture reminded me of horse hay & the smell of it remined me of cat food. The steak was hard as nails & it was marinating in grease. I ate some of the rice & beans, which was decent. The rest of it pretty much got thrown away. The guacomole was lacking in flavor.I don't know guys. I've been to Mexico a few times so maybe i'm a harsher critic then most. Whatever the case, i may try their margaritas oneday because they do look good but, i'll never eat here again.",2.0
"Great tacos (chorizo&papas, cactus, mole chicken... the fish was good, but not my absolute favorite). Solid mole chicken enchiladas that come with a huge serving of rice and beans. The flor de calabaza quesadilla is tasty, but be forewarned that the quesadillas are on the petite side and should not be ordered an entire meal.But the best I've had there so far? The dish that REALLY wowed me, made my taste buds  weep tears of ecstasy? The torrejas de rompope (basically, tres leches french toast) for brunch! The bread (pretty sure it's brioche) is SOAKED in those three lovely milks. So sweet, so moist. Luscious! Served with lovely berries. I HIGHLY recommend it. My second favorite french toast ever (beside the one from Cafe Melie in Montreal). Seriously, I'm not sure if I'll ever be able to order anything else for brunch there... The chorizo hash is a good side dish for brunch too if you split it (same chorizo and potato mixture used in the taco). All brunches are served with cinnamon-coated sweet bread to start (great to dip in coffee).Enjoy!Oh, and a wide selection of tequila. That's always nice.",4.0

Two friends and I went to Chavela's for dinner last night, and we were told by the host that the wait would only be a few minutes. After about 30 minutes, we were called in and seated at cramped end table in between the kitchen door and the bar. My friend could hardly sit in her seat because the table was so close to the wall. We asked to be moved to the table next to us, which was empty, and we were told that another group was coming soon for that table. We had waited longer, which was infuriating.

"Back when Chavela's was on Classon Ave., I used to look for excuses to be in the neighborhood because the food was so good.  More than that, though, the place was quirky and fun.  It was a tight space and a little loud, but it was a very comfortable, inviting place.  My only complaint would be that salsa must be ordered separately.  Even after an extra $3 for salsa, meals there were still a good value, and I always left satisfied.  I would give have given them 4 stars back then, maybe even 5.I've been there three times since they've moved to Franklin, and although the food is about as good, it's just not fun anymore.  The problem, I think, is that it is now less a taqueria than a bar that serves very good food.  To be fair, I think other people are having fun drinking and laughing and eating; I'm probably too much of a misanthrope.  Still, it seems to me they've changed their business model, realizing, perhaps, that there's more money to be made off of people who put drinking and socializing before a good meal.As I've said, though, the food is still excellent:  I love the tlacoyos con napoles, the tamales, and the tortas.  The other things I've tried are good, too -- the elotes callejeros, the enchiladas, and the tortilla soup.  What's best, though, is the variety of flavors.  At some places, the flavors seem to run together and there doesn't seem to be much difference between the various fillings for tacos, etc.  Nothing runs together here -- every dish is distinct and the ingredients fresh and good.  I also appreciate the fact that they keep things simple:  nothing is over-seasoned and, except for a few things like pineapple in the carne enchilada, there's nothing too silly or trendy.   I'll take competence and consistency over flair any day.The portions are a bit small, but that can be a good thing when you want to order several items (and can afford it).  It still kills me to pay for salsa, however -- they could at least provide a basic table salsa and let those wanting something fancier order it.Despite all of the good things about Chavela's, I no longer find myself making excuses to walk a few extra blocks to eat there --  I wind up at Maya Taqueria and Taqueria de los Muertos instead.  That says a lot about how much Chavela's has changed.",3.0

"Now that I've had their brunch and having lived in Austin and LA, I can truly say Chavela's is the best Mexican restaurant in New York.  Anyone who thinks otherwise has an unsophisticated palate and has probably never been south of D.C.I still think it's ridiculous that they don't give you at least one salsa of your choice with tacos or omelets or whatever but no matter.  You simply can't go wrong here (unless of course you show up at 6:30 for happy hour or noon for brunch).FYI, they use El Jimador Tequila in their margaritas which are very good.",5.0
"Chavela's is the kind of surreally perfect Mexican restaurant that only exists in a) my Southwest-born, East Coast-educated mind and b) Prospect Heights, Brooklyn. It's a tiny, gorgeous jewelry-box of a restaurant, with painted tin ceilings, lavish jewel-toned décor, and glittering art and sculpture on the walls. The drink list is full of beverages that stand out in my memory as being well-made and strong, refusing the easy temptation toward Mexican-restaurant mediocrity, and concocted from a combination of ingredients both familiar and startling, from silky mescal to vegetal beet juice. The food is good and interesting too: you can get mole, pork, avocado, all your Mexican itches scratched, but you can also get pineapple-shrimp ceviche and whole roasted fish. And perhaps most surprising: it's as cheap as you'd find it at an LA drive-through, but presented with all the care of a Ken Oringer entry for the Beard awards. The pinch in our experience that helps me to know for certain that I didn't dream it up was the cold draft blowing in throughout, and an unpleasant party that came in with it towards the end of our meal. A pair of young hipster parents and their two kids, aged about 4 and 6, they insisted on pushing through the restaurant's well-deserved Friday night crowd and plunking down on the high-top stools at the bar where we sat. I'm not one to begrudge anyone their date night experience, but this felt forced. If you're wondering if you should or should not bring the Baby Bjorn, just know that this restaurant is a decidedly adult destination on a weekend night, and that your kids run the danger of being buffeted about by hipsters or falling off their seats, as these kids did, while their parents drank margaritas and pretended to be in their twenties. Bottom line: just because this place is cheap doesn't make it common. It's get-a-sitter-special, and Prospect Heights is lucky to have it!",4.0
"Really delicious, authentic-tasting Mexican food. We ordered a variety of things to share an everything was spot-on. Prices are great - about $1 higher than the mom-and-pops in Sunset Park but considerably more reasonable than similar places in Manhattan.",5.0
"I found this place as I was driving through Prospect Heights late one evening and looking for something quick to eat because I was Staaarving.  I got a fish taco and a bistec torta to go.  They came out after five minutes of patiently waiting on the bench outside and they were super tasty, although the torta was drier than I expected (I think it was the too much bread to bistec ratio).Just to make sure I wasn't blinded by my starvation, I went back about a week later around 7pm on a weeknight for round two.  The place was packed, and I waited about 25 minutes for a table.The service was spotty, probably because the place was insanely busy but the food was still really good.We ordered fish tacos, a mushroom quesadilla and chicken flautas and they were all really good.  The mushroom quesadilla definitely gets two gold stars.  I will be coming back to this place, especially to try the Plato Don.Also, there's a huge selection of tequilas on the menu, just in case.",4.0

"My Prospect Heights friends RAVED about how great this place is.  I was expecting to be taken to the next level of screaming Mexican food-gasm abandon.Hummph.Don't get me wrong, it was good.  But - just good.  We got guacamole for the table and it was fine.  Not life-changing.  I ordered the Plato Don, and it was a lot of food!!  The grilled steak was really tasty, but the chipotle chicken was bland and watery.  The accompanying rice/beans/pico de gallo etc etc were all standard.It's a neat space, albeit cramped and crowded.  My chair was really rickety.  (OK now I'm nit-picking...lemme stop here)I would come again.  Its not a bad place.  I just don't think it lived up to the hype.",3.0
"Now that I've had their brunch and having lived in Austin and LA, I can truly say Chavela's is the best Mexican restaurant in New York.  Anyone who thinks otherwise has an unsophisticated palate and has probably never been south of D.C.I still think it's ridiculous that they don't give you at least one salsa of your choice with tacos or omelets or whatever but no matter.  You simply can't go wrong here (unless of course you show up at 6:30 for happy hour or noon for brunch).FYI, they use El Jimador Tequila in their margaritas which are very good.",5.0
"Chavela's is the kind of surreally perfect Mexican restaurant that only exists in a) my Southwest-born, East Coast-educated mind and b) Prospect Heights, Brooklyn. It's a tiny, gorgeous jewelry-box of a restaurant, with painted tin ceilings, lavish jewel-toned décor, and glittering art and sculpture on the walls. The drink list is full of beverages that stand out in my memory as being well-made and strong, refusing the easy temptation toward Mexican-restaurant mediocrity, and concocted from a combination of ingredients both familiar and startling, from silky mescal to vegetal beet juice. The food is good and interesting too: you can get mole, pork, avocado, all your Mexican itches scratched, but you can also get pineapple-shrimp ceviche and whole roasted fish. And perhaps most surprising: it's as cheap as you'd find it at an LA drive-through, but presented with all the care of a Ken Oringer entry for the Beard awards. The pinch in our experience that helps me to know for certain that I didn't dream it up was the cold draft blowing in throughout, and an unpleasant party that came in with it towards the end of our meal. A pair of young hipster parents and their two kids, aged about 4 and 6, they insisted on pushing through the restaurant's well-deserved Friday night crowd and plunking down on the high-top stools at the bar where we sat. I'm not one to begrudge anyone their date night experience, but this felt forced. If you're wondering if you should or should not bring the Baby Bjorn, just know that this restaurant is a decidedly adult destination on a weekend night, and that your kids run the danger of being buffeted about by hipsters or falling off their seats, as these kids did, while their parents drank margaritas and pretended to be in their twenties. Bottom line: just because this place is cheap doesn't make it common. It's get-a-sitter-special, and Prospect Heights is lucky to have it!",4.0
"Really delicious, authentic-tasting Mexican food. We ordered a variety of things to share an everything was spot-on. Prices are great - about $1 higher than the mom-and-pops in Sunset Park but considerably more reasonable than similar places in Manhattan.",5.0
"I found this place as I was driving through Prospect Heights late one evening and looking for something quick to eat because I was Staaarving.  I got a fish taco and a bistec torta to go.  They came out after five minutes of patiently waiting on the bench outside and they were super tasty, although the torta was drier than I expected (I think it was the too much bread to bistec ratio).Just to make sure I wasn't blinded by my starvation, I went back about a week later around 7pm on a weeknight for round two.  The place was packed, and I waited about 25 minutes for a table.The service was spotty, probably because the place was insanely busy but the food was still really good.We ordered fish tacos, a mushroom quesadilla and chicken flautas and they were all really good.  The mushroom quesadilla definitely gets two gold stars.  I will be coming back to this place, especially to try the Plato Don.Also, there's a huge selection of tequilas on the menu, just in case.",4.0
"4.5 starsGreat restaurant. The decor was nice and the food was delicious. The drink special was okay. For $11 I expected a little more - the bartender had to remake it because he didn't make enough the first time. BUT overall, it was a great experience. My friend and I split the Plato Don Pescado, which was perfect. We started off sharing a tostada and for what we paid, it was worth it. The drink was the only exception. Sticking to beers might be the best way to go.",4.0
"Been going to this place since they were located on Classon a few years back. I'm glad they made the move to Franklin Avenue and have more space now. The quality is still as good as ever, but now you don't have to wait forever for a table.

"Highly recommend Chavela's. Probably the best grilled corn I have EVER had in my life, and I've eaten a lot of it.

"Chavela's, Franklin Edition, is bigger & better than it's former Classon self. We went last night & there was a wait for a table on a Monday night!! Obviously they needed the bigger space, and could even use more. I've really only ever had one thing I wasn't wowed by at Chavela's (the tamales, ehh). Everything else is awesome. The ubiquitous Plato Don, both for dinner & for brunch is a favorite for sharing. I always get carried away & overload my little tacos with deliciousness. The Camarones A La Mexicana is also a favorite - one of the best shrimp dishes I've had anywhere, swimming in a light, white wine & tomato broth.Everything I've had for brunch has been awesome. It comes with drinks, yay! The cinnamon infused coffee doens't hurt either. The chilaquiles are great, but if you're going for something more substantial (aka not just eating chips & salsa for breakfast), the Huevos Abogados is their version of Eggs Benedict and it's perfect.

"Since my last glowing review of Chavela's, I'm afraid it's gotten too big for its britches. We attempted to go here for dinner on a Friday but promptly left when we couldn't even get to a hostess through the packed entryway. We decided to try a few weeks later for brunch with a party of four. Again, the place was crowded, but we were able to get a table after about 10 minutes. The problem was that the table was clearly meant for two, not four, and a nasty draft kept coming in through the door. I wanted to ask if we could wait for another table, but we ultimately decided against it because the server kept disappearing, and we were starving. I'm afraid I don't remember much of what I ate because I was so uncomfortable in the situation.But I still had my glorious delivery, at least, until yesterday. I tried not to abuse the kindness of the delivery staff, who kept coming to my apartment despite it being located a few blocks out of their delivery zone, by calling well before the dinner rush. But I guess when I ordered a few weeks ago it was a little too late. The manager was obliging, but politely asked that I check ahead of time in the future and explained that they were getting a lot of orders and that they wouldn't be able to come if the restaurant was busy. Perfectly understandable. So when I called yesterday, I explained the situation to the woman on the phone and expected things to be fine. She pulled up my address by my phone number and to my shock, she said that the manager had put a note on my account saying they will not be delivering to us anymore. I tried questioning her about it, since it was contrary to what the manager had told me, but she rudely told me that they were just too busy and hung up.Perhaps they are ""just too busy"" now that Prospect Heights is getting overrun by the yuppie crowd spilling over from Park Slope. Perhaps Chavela's doesn't need me anymore, and perhaps I should just accept it and move on. But for now, there is an emptiness inside of me that can only be filled with rice and beans.",2.0
"I was really excited to try Chavela's... even talked them through an entire delivery order and then we realized I live outside the delivery zone (oops)... my husband and I walked 20 minutes to pick up the food.

"They have a very accommodating menu for vegetarians; I believe I even saw a note about making most of the veggie dishes vegan upon request.The guacamole is great, and the large round chips that come with it are also great.  Random rambling, these chips remind me of those big wafers they break up for communion at church.  I bet if they substituted these chips and guac for the wafer and wine combo at church communion, more people would be going to church (perhaps the pope should be consulted on this angle).  Anyways, Nopales & Verderas tacos are terrific, perhaps my favorite so far.  Great seasoning and fillings in both tacos, and the filling to tortilla ratio was just right.  Oh...and I'm pretty sure my girlfriend would be satisfied with just drinking a bucket of their house sangria (either red or white) as her meal.Is this place authentic Mexican, I can't say, but I don't care because it is awesome.  The only downside is that it can be crowded and you have to eat with everyone else that loves good food.  This is becoming a frequent taco stop for me.",4.0

Get there early for dinner (or really late) otherwise expect to wait! Another bonus: Its a neighborhood crowd!",5.0
"Charming, cozy and DELICIOUS. This place has over sweet, not strong margaritas on tap which could bump this place down to a four, but order a shot on the side and you are good to go. I've tried several items on the menu- all solid, tasty delights. GO TO THERE.",5.0
"Everything was great! We ordered the guacamole and chips as our app.... Excellent, the perfect amount of spice. I am not a big margarita fan, but Chavela's is on point. We shared the plato don.... Very very good. More than enough for 2 ppl... But because we were being totally greedy we also order tacos.... Chorizo, chicken in mole sauce and my favorite pork marinates in pineapples! Service was prompt and our waiter was attentive. He suggested we get the baked tilapia next time.... We are excited about returning!",4.0
"Since my last glowing review of Chavela's, I'm afraid it's gotten too big for its britches. We attempted to go here for dinner on a Friday but promptly left when we couldn't even get to a hostess through the packed entryway. We decided to try a few weeks later for brunch with a party of four. Again, the place was crowded, but we were able to get a table after about 10 minutes. The problem was that the table was clearly meant for two, not four, and a nasty draft kept coming in through the door. I wanted to ask if we could wait for another table, but we ultimately decided against it because the server kept disappearing, and we were starving. I'm afraid I don't remember much of what I ate because I was so uncomfortable in the situation.But I still had my glorious delivery, at least, until yesterday. I tried not to abuse the kindness of the delivery staff, who kept coming to my apartment despite it being located a few blocks out of their delivery zone, by calling well before the dinner rush. But I guess when I ordered a few weeks ago it was a little too late. The manager was obliging, but politely asked that I check ahead of time in the future and explained that they were getting a lot of orders and that they wouldn't be able to come if the restaurant was busy. Perfectly understandable. So when I called yesterday, I explained the situation to the woman on the phone and expected things to be fine. She pulled up my address by my phone number and to my shock, she said that the manager had put a note on my account saying they will not be delivering to us anymore. I tried questioning her about it, since it was contrary to what the manager had told me, but she rudely told me that they were just too busy and hung up.Perhaps they are ""just too busy"" now that Prospect Heights is getting overrun by the yuppie crowd spilling over from Park Slope. Perhaps Chavela's doesn't need me anymore, and perhaps I should just accept it and move on. But for now, there is an emptiness inside of me that can only be filled with rice and beans.",2.0
"I was really excited to try Chavela's... even talked them through an entire delivery order and then we realized I live outside the delivery zone (oops)... my husband and I walked 20 minutes to pick up the food. And then... I was heartbroken. My very ""vegetariano"" Plato Don was a ""carne"" Plato Don. So I'll try again. The rest of our order was very good. Not earth-shattering, but very good.",3.0
Went for brunch and wasn't disappointed with the Huevos Ahogados. Brings in a crowd.,4.0
"They have a very accommodating menu for vegetarians; I believe I even saw a note about making most of the veggie dishes vegan upon request.The guacamole is great, and the large round chips that come with it are also great.  Random rambling, these chips remind me of those big wafers they break up for communion at church.  I bet if they substituted these chips and guac for the wafer and wine combo at church communion, more people would be going to church (perhaps the pope should be consulted on this angle).  Anyways, Nopales & Verderas tacos are terrific, perhaps my favorite so far.  Great seasoning and fillings in both tacos, and the filling to tortilla ratio was just right.  Oh...and I'm pretty sure my girlfriend would be satisfied with just drinking a bucket of their house sangria (either red or white) as her meal.Is this place authentic Mexican, I can't say, but I don't care because it is awesome.  The only downside is that it can be crowded and you have to eat with everyone else that loves good food.  This is becoming a frequent taco stop for me.",4.0

"I was a fan of Chavella's at the old location, but it was so small and often had an aggresively *hip* clientele that my companion and I would usually opt for a different restaurant.  Still, we were most definitely excited when we saw the work being put in to the new Chavela's (one L only) on Franklin Ave.  The space is nicely decorated and better proportioned to accommodate their loyal masses.  The service is friendly, and they now take cards!  It is still such a popular spot that there can be a wait, and even with all the extra tables it can feel crowded when seated.  I hope they'll be able to get some curbside seating come spring/summer.  The prices are terrific, the alcoholic beverage offerings are many, and they offer nopales tacos -- my favorite.  I'm leaving off one star because the last time we were there our mains arrived before our appetizer, but the staff was very sweet and apologetic about it, and also my credit card was missing when the bill came back to my table to be signed (it had fallen out and onto the floor without our server noticing.  She retraced her steps and found it for me.).  Also, we hung our coats on the coat racks in the back, which had been empty, and when we went to retreive them we discovered that someone had taken my husband's coat off the hook and just dumped it on a nearby chair in order to hang their own.  In the half-dark of the evening, we almost didn't find his coat at all.  Last point is obviously not against the restaurant, but reflects on some of the tackless, self-absorbed hipsters that frequent it, in my opinion.",4.0
"I love Chavellas. I loved it when it was tinier, and I love it now that it's just tiny.

Unique food creations and always ask for the specials. I also really love that it still feels small, despite them tripling the space. The tables are still close together, (although not uncomfortably anymore) and it still feels comfy. Here is why the new place got four stars for me and not 5: If they change these two things, throw it up to growing pains, I'll gladly give a five because I love this place so much. 1) music is too loud.

"Best Mexican in the neighborhood. Chavela's never disappoints and never take too much out of your wallet. It will be packed for Friday and Saturday nights. They do not take reservations and there not so many tables. Never take a table in the front unless you want people bumping into you while you eat. (I learned that the hard way). The wait could be over an hour but if you plan accordingly you can put down your name, they'll tell you when to come back and you can just hit up Franklin Park or the Crown Inn. Once inside and seated you are in for a treat. The decor is real nice and they food is AWESOME! They have all your basic Mexican classics. The Guacamole is the best around. They also have some options that are not at every restaurant. Some really tasty Mexican sandwiches. If you get the hot sauce, be prepared. The drinks are tasty but on one sad note, if you're ever in the mood for a non alcoholic drink (they do exist...... not always in my life but they do) they don't serve soda. Not even regular Odd.

"Mmm mmm mmm.After loving their Classon Ave brunches for years, I finally returned to try the Franklin Ave location.

Both my boyfriend and I ordered the Elotes Callejeros, and we got the nopals, and bistec tacos I got a rajas con queso quesadilla, Tlacoyo de nopalas and we both got Don Pepinos to drink.  The elote came out very quickly and our drinks which we saw being made were made quickly as well. Both were very flavourful and the drinks were surprisingly refreshing, I hadn't even wanted a drink but tried my boyfriend's and had to have one.  All of the dishes we got were fantastic.  I'm not sure of his role, he might be the owner, but Mark was the icing on the cake.  Checking around the restaurant to see how people were, he officially welcomed us to the neighborhood and made us excited not only to be in the restaurant, but in crown heights in general.  On the way out he remembered both of our names and even gave us a parting gift for our move.  This was absolutely one of the top 3 restaurant experiences I've ever had, and what's great about it is that it is right down the block.

"Best Mexican in the neighborhood. Chavela's never disappoints and never take too much out of your wallet. It will be packed for Friday and Saturday nights. They do not take reservations and there not so many tables. Never take a table in the front unless you want people bumping into you while you eat. (I learned that the hard way). The wait could be over an hour but if you plan accordingly you can put down your name, they'll tell you when to come back and you can just hit up Franklin Park or the Crown Inn. Once inside and seated you are in for a treat. The decor is real nice and they food is AWESOME! They have all your basic Mexican classics. The Guacamole is the best around.

In fact if you are a bit heavy I'd imagine that it would be difficult to get into some of these seats since little space is left in between tables. Our waitress was really nice as well. My friend insisted that we order a pitcher of margarita. After consulting with the waitres and learning (inaccurately) that each pitcher had 5 drinks in it, we decided to live Friday up a bit and go for it. However, that pitcher was huge and ended up pouring 8 full glasses. We needed a third person, but that wasn't available. I ordered the Plato Don, which provides a medley of different foods that you can make your own soft shell tacos with. The food was tasty and the serving was pretty large and screams, ""share me"". We struggled to finish that pitcher which felt like I was guzzling sugar water by the end. I'll definitely go back. It seems to be the new neighborhood hotspot.",4.0

It tasted like an overpriced, poorly made lemonade! I asked for a bit more tequila only to be told that's as much alcohol that can be put in it. I sent it back, it was horrible...I ordered chips & guacamole to get rid of the taste. Guacamole was ok, but the chips were hard and absolutely WAY too big (as big as coasters my mom uses when company comes over). Also tried the chipotle chicken.  The chicken lacked flavor, it was dry and blend. To top it all off we were asked to hurry because they had others waiting for a table!By then I had enough, I used the free wifi to find a bar with decent drinks.  Sadly, Chavela's wasn't worth my time or my money. I definitely won't be coming back!",2.0
"I love this place!  Great happy hour specials, which is when I mostly go (Mon - Fri, 4 - 8pm).  $2 tacos, $3 beer, $4 sangrias, $5 margaritas.  If you've got a hankering for a spicier beer, try the michelada with Pacifico.  The recipe they use for the mix they put in it is the bomb!  Regular price $6 - during happy hour, $3.  And the tacos are amazing.  My favorite is the aguecate, which is a vegetarian taco with pico & lots of avocado.  DELISH!  I've also had the pork taco, the steak taco, and the chicken taco - good not nearly as great as the vegetarian option.Staff is friendly.  If you don't go during happy hour, it can get pretty crowded.  This is a regular place for me.",5.0

"Brunch was amazing and pretty darn reasonable. For $12 you get a brunch item and a drink (juice coffee etc) and for an extra $2, bomb sangria. My girlfriend got the Huevos con Rojos and loved them and I loved my french toast. The eggless plate don also a good choice, my friend got it and it fed all of us.",5.0

"I've been to Chavela's a few times with friends and family on the weekend, late afternoon to early evening. The staff is friendly and the wait is never too long. The restaurant is tight but cute and I love the decor, there is so much to look at! The food is good, their fish is very good, I recommend it, not too salty not too bland. The ""plato don"" is a sampler that brings a little bit of everything for a Mexican fiesta, it's good for 2 - 3 people. The sangria is a bit expensive but good. The prices are moderate and you will not break the bank at Chavela's.",4.0

"Absolutely beyond and without a doubt better than Guero's. (I'm not a Guero's hater just a Chavela's lover, just wanna state that up front so you know what kind of foodie you're working with). To add to the quality of the chicken mole and the enchiladas con salsa verde, there's an uncannily good ceviche, and even more, fantastic customer service, excellent delivery.

"Giving Chavela's 3 stars because it's so hit or miss. I'm not sure what the problem is, but when ordering from Chavela's I feel like I'm always taking a risk. I keep going back though, because 1) I live a block away & it's rather convenient and 2) you can eat pretty cheaply, if you pay attention when you order.Chavela's is my go-to spot for tacos/quesadillas/tamales. These items are pretty reliably good, though sometimes they are REALLY good and sometimes they're just mediocre. The margaritas are terrible. I think I've bought the same shitty margarita mix at the liquor store for 1/2 the price and twice as many drinks.I went for brunch once, and I probably won't go back. A friend and I both ordered the Huevo's Rancheros and we really wished one of us had ordered something else because there was no creativity put into it and it was the most boring, tasteless and poorly executed version I have ever had.First off, the eggs were not cooked all the way through. Runny yoke: OK, runny egg white: not OK. I had to send it back because I'm not into eating raw egg. Secondly, the plate was a store bought tortilla with two eggs on it and green sauce all over it. Separately there was a bowl of re-fried beans that were super dry. That was it. The presentation was horrible. There was no salad, no potatoes, no guacamole, no tomato salsa, no cheese. Also the OJ was store bought. If I'm paying $11 for brunch with coffee & juice, at least give me fresh squeezed.Anyway. It's risky, but if you know what is good on their menu, it can be worth it.",3.0

He had to kill it with a napkin! When the waiter came over to retrieve him the check we showed him the dinner guest that had opted to join us. When he took our friend over to the manager he simply shrugged it off like nothing was wrong. The waiter came back and reported ""the manager said there's nothing he can do...

"I've eaten here twice- once in the restaurant and the other time we took it to go. Both times I thoroughly enjoyed my selection and the prices are great considering the quality and quantity of the plates. It gets very crowded inside and the space is not very, well....spacious. On both visits I got crammed/stuck in the doorway with a few other hopeful patrons. The tables are close together but when eating with 2 it was a perfect size, although I could see it  being difficult to dine in with more than 2 people and actually get to enjoy each others company. On the most recent visit I ordered the beef torta and it was delicious with avocado,onions, and the house chipotle sauce. They also have an incredible amount of vegetarian options which are filling and savory. The tequila and drink options are also very impressive!",4.0
"overpriced Americanized Mexican food. it's fine if you're in the area because it's your only option for Mexican, and that sucks. I haven't been to the new location yet but maybe the vibe and ambience will make it more worth it because that smaller location made me hate going there.",2.0

"The guacamole was boring, although that did not stop me from eating all of it. They also messed up the order of our order . . . bringing our appetizer out at the same time as our main dish, with no acknowledgment of the mistake. And the tortilla soup was horrible. More like a bowl of warm and sour salsa verde with a few shreds of chicken and tortilla. There was no broth. I was pretty disappointed because I used to be a huge fan of Chavella's on Classon.",3.0

"I'm a Chavela's fan and since I live around the corner I go here all the time and have been for the last 2 years. This place is quite tasty and is a really good value. All the food is fresh and well seasoned.

There is also a veggie and fish plato don which are great too. Other tastiness on the menu includes the tlacoyo ( a masa/bean confection of goodness), ceviche, quesadillas, tamales, the half chicken and the Mexican shrimp stew. And then the drinks are lovely especially the margarita and sangria. I have tasted most of the things on the menu and its all good. If you have a choice between Gueros, Cochinita, Pequena, Maya's Taqueria or Taqueria Dos Los Muertos- Chavela's is hands down the absolute best.",4.0
"Ok, so, several people raved about this place, just moved to the neighborhood, and I went there: I was very disappointed by how rudely we were treated and the food was mediocre at best.We got there at 2:05pm on a Sunday (2/18/13)--two people. They told us the wait would be 25 minutes. We waited 1 hour, when we didn't have to. What I mean by ""we didn't have to"" is we legitimately got skipped at least once. We are suspicious it happened more than once. However, the skip we are sure about was this:  a couple showed up way after we'd been waiting, the hostess forgot to write them down, so when the couple asked where they were in the list and the hostess discovered she hadn't written them down she says, ""they can be next"". My friend and I? Our jaws dropped. We said ""what?!"" The hostess looked at us, knew she messed up, and did nothing--did not even verbally acknowledge us. The other hostess *rolls her eyes at us*. So, at 3:10pm we finally get seated (they realized they had better getting us seated immediately I'm sure). Well, we get seated and the waitress comes over to say 'hi', I do think she saw us waiting and was concerned about us, which was nice of her. Well, we ask if she can put our order in immediately (the couple who got seated before us and one other couple who were seated after us had already ordered). I was super polite, I promise, I know it wasnt her fault about the wait, so I explained our long wait, and asked her to put the order in asap. She said she would. Well, guess what, she didn't. Those two couples got their food before us. SOOO, food comes 25 minutes later and there is literally half a cup of verde sauce on my enchilada, like, more sauce than enchilada itself, I swear. To her credit, the waitress asked how the food was, I said ""I'm too hungry not to eat this, but as you can see, there is as much verde sauce as enchilada here"". She comp'd the dish, but she didn't look particularly pleased. Ok, I guess that's reasonable. But come on!! Our wait? Our food! The least she could do is be not cranky with us. Ok, we finish eating, and we have decided at this point we have to say something to the manager. So, he comes over and we explain how dissatisfied we are. He begrudgingly comp'd the whole thing. I never ever ever do this, I swear. And it's not even about the money--the least he could have done was be genuinely concerned, and offered to comp and an apology without the clear disdain for us.

"Don't order delivery!I hate to give such a good restaurant one star, but I had an incredibly rude experience at Chavela's this evening.Chavela's generally has excellent food and service that I've enjoyed for many years.  I regularly bring friends, family, and co-workers to enjoy the great food and I've always enjoyed my interactions with their staff.This evening, I called to place a delivery order. After the order didn't arrive, I called to confirm and discovered the order was never placed. I tried to place the order again and the person on the phone was very confused and eventually hung up on me.  I called back a third time and asked to speak to a manager. I spoke to Damien, who would not place my order because my address is one block outside the delivery zone (although your staff has delivered to my address for many years).  Damien refused to place my order, or even allow me to meet the delivery person within the delivery zone (one block from my address) even though I had already placed my order once, been hung up on, and treated very rudely.  It seems to me that one block is a small exception when a customer has been treated so rudely. Although I've always found Damien to be very friendly and professional on the past, he was incredibly dismissive.I would love to continue to support Chavela's, but I find it difficult to support a place where customers are hung up on and not apologized to for such rude behavior.  I hope Chavela's is able to follow up with this employee to prevent other customers from receiving such treatment.",1.0
"I used to go to Chavela's for brunch back in 2010 when it was in a much smaller location just down the street from where it is now. Back in yester-year, brunch included mimosa's for like $2 extra, which appears to be a thing of the past. Bummer. The old place was tiny and comfortable and had a vibe that seemed to say we've just a couple of people trying to make really good food for about 12 people at a time. The new one is like the owners went to The Cheesecake Factory and decided to adopt their business model. Weird. Anyway, I found myself recently a block away and didn't know about the move/expansion, and now wish I had suggested any number of other places nearby.Ok. Full disclosure:1. I've moved out of New York to San Francisco which has exponentially increased my standards for what Mexican food should be.2. I went here for brunch again on New Years Day. Probably everyone who worked there was hung over, and it was slammed.So this past visit, New Years Day, was to their new space which is much bigger and less cozy than the last one. There's regular tables and bench seats, but we were seated at a tall table with tall stools. Not to gripe about details but sitting in a chair with no back support for a leisurely brunch takes out like 45% of the fun. Plus my back was right by the bar and I discovered that water (or some other liquid?) had been splashed all over my back from the servers rushing back and forth and no one said anything to me. Frowny face. Moving on. Ye olde tiny Chavela's of my memory served you Mexican sweet breads when you sat down in assortment. New Chavela's gives you one big one, which perhaps you will receive before you order, or after you order, or after you've consumed more than half your meal like we did. Ye olde tiny Chavela's also used to make better coffee. Probably the most disappointing factor in this recent trip was the fact that my meal was room temperature at best. I know that egg dishes are hard to time and I'm sure its exponentially harder when a kitchen is as busy as it was that day, but no one likes cold-ish poached eggs. I didn't bother sending it back because I got the feeling the wait would have made me more annoyed than just dealing with a plate of tepid food. I also wouldn't say temperature was the only thing my meal was lacking. Overall, I wish that based on the description of ingredients there had been a whole lot more flavor or punch or anything, really. I guess the main thing its got going for it is that there was a lot of food and the brunch price is reasonable, but my compliments end there.I'm not even gonna touch whether or not this should be called Mexican.

"I've been to this place four times now and while for the most part, it's been a good experience, last night was ridiculous. As someone with celiacs and therefore unable to eat gluten, this place is terrible. Every time I've gone, they've told me that different items on their menu are safe/not safe for those with gluten allergies and no one seems to even know what is in their food. They pack their tortillas with wheat which makes a huge number of items on their menu unavailable for me (very strange since most restaurants of this caliber, and less, use 100% corn tortillas). Other items on the menu, like tamales, which are usually corn also include wheat at Chavela's. I've had a few dishes on the menu before and it's always been good quality and great drinks, ambiance etc. However, last night I was told the Chile Relleno was gluten free and ordered it. When it arrived, it was clearly covered in some sort of breading. I asked the waitress what was on the outside and before I could even get my sentence out, she spoke sharply and rudely, saying it was gluten free and that someone with an allergy had eaten it earlier that night. She walked off and I decided to take a bit of the inside. She came back a minute later and took the dish away, saying ""don't eat that."" Not surprisingly, I was shocked. She then went on to blame the kitchen for not speaking English for her mistake (not appreciated). She assured me that I would not be charged for the dish (as if this was somehow not a given...) and I ordered a salad which I was then charged for. No one ever came over to apologize or check in. I really want to like this place but they need to get their allergen information together. Every time I am there, the waiter tells me a completely different story about what I can eat, and after last night, I do NOT feel safe eating there.

At this point i should've just left because the service got worst.  We ordered 2 sodas.  I asked for a glass with ice on the side.  10 minutes later the soda came in a bottle, no glass with ice, so i had to remind the waitress again.  Then she drops on the table a mug with about 5 small ice cubes in it, so i right away flagged her down and asked her for some more ice.  She takes the cup and brings me more ice, and guess what? No straw.  So i nicely ask for a straw.  She goes to the bar and brings rolled up in a napkin 4 little red cocktail straws for us to drink soda with from a mug.  Now you tell me how in the hell is this possible.  I at this point left the straw on the table and just drank straight from the mug.  Its so tiring to have to be after a waitress for such simple things.  I noticed everyone that was coming in after me was seated and attended to right away.  Everyone got their guacamole and tostadas on their table, of course we never did and i just didnt bother asking at this point.  No complaints about the food but there is no excuse for such very poor service.  My brunch guest was very dissapointed and said she didnt think she was going to return.  Management needs to make it clear whether service is going to be equally the same for everyone or just lousy for the ones the wait staff feels they dont like.  I still ended up leaving a minimal tip of $10 even though it wasnt deserved.

On the other hand, one of the other diners in my party ordered quesadillas. The quesadillas were very strange (and came out after some delay while we had all started eating). They were actually more like empanadas and only had cheese sprinkled on top instead of inside the tortilla...which was a fried corn tortilla instead of the traditional flour.

On the other hand, one of the other diners in my party ordered quesadillas. The quesadillas were very strange (and came out after some delay while we had all started eating). They were actually more like empanadas and only had cheese sprinkled on top instead of inside the tortilla...which was a fried corn tortilla instead of the traditional flour. It wasn't terrible, but it definitely wasn't what we expected.",4.0
