Yummmmmmy!I'm not usually a big fan of rotisserie chicken but the chicken here is uh-mazing.I called for delivery (which came very fast).They have a ton of sides you can choose from. I ordered a quarter chicken with tostones and veggies.The chicken is rotisseri-ed (?) to perfection where its still crispy on the outside and moist on the inside.The prices here are very reasonable. Their green sauce is on point. The level of spiciness is perfect for me and if you dip it in tostones and chicken... it is grrrreat!,5.0
"The rotisserie chicken is done well at Inca. The white meat isn't dry as you'd expect. The skin is charred enough to give it a bit of a crunch. And like the other Yelpers suggest, put the house made green sauce on! The chicken is also good eaten cold. Use the carcass for soup stock!!",5.0
"This is a nice hole-in-the-wall place to get rotisserie chicken and comforting sides. The prices are very reasonable. I have been here over 10 times since it is close to where I live, and each experience was pleasant. The optional green sauce is nice, but do not over-do it. Use it in moderation. Try to avoid going during peak times as the inside is very small. If you're around Bushwick or have to be at Wyckoff Hospital, I'd definitely recommend Inca.",4.0
"Inca Chicken is the best chicken ever.  My boyfriend when we were first dating used to go here and used to talk to me about ""this really good chicken place"" that he used to go to on his way to and from work and I never went and never really cared to go.  But one day, we didn't have anything in our apartment for dinner, so he brought home half of a chicken and fried plantains and it was just the best thing I've ever eaten.  Definitely a must-try place if you're in Bushwick and also the best chicken ever.",5.0
"Good food. Great price. Love that spicy Peruvian sauce! Not really a date night spot, more for take out but if you're in the neighborhood and u have some time to kill you can grab a seat in the back.",3.0
"Stay away from this place, the food is extremely cheap but it's for good reasons! The rice and beans taste like uncle bens, the chicken has no flavor and is super greasy. There were some questionable individuals in there. The place had a dirty sketchy look to it, It left a sour taste in my mouth. I attempted to sit and eat there but there was a crazy man screaming, the workers just ignored him and didn't do anything about it, I took the food and got out of there, I didn't feel safe. This is nothing like true authentic Peruvian food. Walk down to Chimu to get some real Peruvian dishes.",1.0

"Inca Chicken was unexpectedly a nice surprise for lunch the other day.  I walked into an unassuming restaurant with a few chairs and tables.  The food was displayed through glass and I was quickly asked what I would like to order.   There was plenty to choose from.  They had ribs, chicken, sausages, etc and many other side dishes.  I decided on the quarter chicken dark with potato salad and steamed vegetables.  For $5.50 I had a full lunch that was quite satisfying!  The meat was very tender and pulled right away from the bone.  It was seasoned well and had rich flavor.  The potato salad was good with some mixed vegetables added.  And the steamed broccoli, carrots, and string beans were perfection.  They had the right amount of butter just to give a little more flavor.  The green sauce was served in a small cup and was the right amount of kick to add to my food.  Overall I had a great experience.  I just wished there was more room.  I ended up sitting directly under a flat screen TV and nearly hit my head sitting down and getting up.",4.0

"I got excited when I saw the words ""Peruvian chicken"".Why is that? Is it magical? No. Will it come home with me? I wish.Two words.Green sauce.If you don't know what I'm talking about, stop what you are doing right now, Google Pio Pio, and thank me later. If you are absolutely starving and are willing to sacrifice a little taste for an awesome price, continue on.I had the whole chicken and a side of rice. With two drinks (soda and water), that came out to 12.75. Slightly pricey considering the neighborhood, but in the scheme of NYC eateries, obviously a bargain. Their combo meals seem to be cheaper, but I came here on a mission of comparison.The sauce will not disappoint you. There are bottles of it everywhere, waiting to be disposed onto your waiting plate to delight your palate.The chicken will. Especially if you have been to other Peruvian spots. The breast meat was OK, its just the other parts of the chicken tasted on the uncooked/flavorless side. Judging from the other reviews, either I came on a bad day, or these guys haven't seen their share of chicken. I have.Trust me on that Google.",3.0

"Pretty good , they definitely get the chicken part of the game right , haven't really tried anything else other than the sausage which is also good , but little too expensive for each one I think it's $2.50 .

"Whenever I go to N.Y., this is one of my ""must go to"" spots.  After being a continuous walk in customer, I just tried catering from them for the first time this past weekend for a family event.  I ordered large amounts of the chicken, ribs, potato salad, maduros and steamed veggies.  (Food for 40 people)  Although, a separate catering menu was not available, I was able to customize and order exactly what I wanted at a great price over the phone.

"The chicken and aji are good, not great.  The chicken is not on the level of Pio Pio.  The prices are right though.  If you're on a budget, $6 for a half chicken and two sides is unreal.  The value is definitely the biggest selling point here.  I tried the lo-mein and yellow rice as sides and they were both below average.",3.0
Delicious chicken perhaps best tasting in the neighborhood ...,5.0
"This place has one of the best tasting rotisserie chicken in NY. It's juicy, tender and extremely flavorful. And, don't forget to dip it in their amazing secret green sauce. I always go in and get a few chickens for special family gatherings and it's always a big hit. Def need to check it out and you won't be disappointed!",5.0
Recently opened right next to the Dekalb L stop.  Went in and got a quarter chicken and plantains for 3.50.  The chicken was super tender and delicious and so were the plantains.  A half chicken and two sides is 5.50 and enough food for two people. Definitely going to be hard to resist on my way to and from the subway.,4.0
