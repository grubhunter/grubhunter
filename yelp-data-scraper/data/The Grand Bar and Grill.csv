"My friend and I hosted a private event at The Grand last weekend and it was the perfect venue for us. The front bar is big but the back room doubles the space, which is perfect for a large event. Eric, the owner, was super easy going and helpful. Not only did he agree to move most of the tables down to the basement so we'd have maximum space for our 150 guests, he also decorated the bar earlier than usual so we'd have holiday decor for our party. He also hooked us up with a great doorman (what up Roddy!), coat check area, and a friendly, attentive bar staff. The bar was crowded but I never had to wait more than a couple minutes to be served. There are not many bars this large in Williamsburg, and most of the others are more expensive to rent for a private event, or have a layout that's not as conducive to a big party. We were happy to have had our party here. Thanks Eric!",5.0
"Great happy hour deals, interesting folk, and good food. Came here with a buddy because we wanted wings and wanted to be in Wburg and Yelp was helping us out on that one. We cabbed it to Wburg and dropped in on a seasonably warm autumn evening. The windows were open at The Grand and we sat on stools near the windows. The food and drink deals were 2 for 1, so we got some Bronx Pale Ales and some wings, one teriyaki and one regular buffalo red whatever hot. My buddy preferred the former and I the latter and while we shared those wings, we really just ended up swapping plates. We also ordered some mac and cheese, which was pretty great, aside from the enormous dollop of ricotta in the middle of it which neither of us touched. (Some people might like ricotta, I grant that.)In the middle of our meal, some guy at the bar offered us his old-fashioned, because he ordered the 2-for-1 deal and there was no way he was going to finish both. I shook his hand to thank him and introduced myself. He sort of looked at me like there-are-eight-million-people-in-New-York-the-chances-we-will-ever-interact-again-are-about-nil-so-why-bother-with-the-niceties (which was ironic because he was offering niceties to me in other ways), but he gave me his name anyway. It was Homer. The old-fashioned was okay.",4.0
Always a fan of places that stay open late and still offer good eats. Ordered the burger with greens and mac and cherse. Definitely a must go!,5.0
"You simply cannot go wrong with The Grand. Certainly lives up to its name with a Spacious restaurant/bar, tasty wings and friendly staff. But seriously those wings, just order them upon walking through the front door and ponder about everything else later.Our waiter was knew the menu very well and took great care of our party of 12 people. The resturant does not blast music for no reason so you mix n mingle within the group.  Rather than stuck shouting in one person's ear next to you. I've only visited once but impressed by the cozy atmosphere, quality food and great service. In short, stop by The Grand if you're in the area. You won't be disappointed.",4.0
"Always mellow and spacious with excellent food. The draft selection is excellent and the burger, while pricy ($16), is juicy and impeccably cooked. If you don't want to deal with asshole hipsters and have a good meal while watching sports, this is the best bet in the area.",5.0
The Grand is a great addition to the neighborhood. The bar itself is beautiful with dark wood walls and bar. The staff has always been really nice. The food is great. I love their shisito peppers and friend enoki mushrooms (I believe that was a special). The burgers are great - just the right amount of delicious gooey greasiness (and I mean that in a good way!) The mac and cheese is amazing.They have a dollar oyster happy hour and wing specials.,5.0
"I happened upon this place for brunch on a hangry mission for burgers. I ordered the burger with an egg on top, cuz I'm a bause. The burger itself was seasoned nicely, a bit on the salty side, but I like that. It was nice because most places just give you a hunk of meat and you're forced to add ketchup to make it taste good... even if it is grass fed or whatever (the neighborhood just keeps getting more obvious). The burger was a little on the greasy side though, so make sure you have plenty of napkins. It came with fries, and they were also yum, but they give you a lot! Danger zone! The bloody maria I ordered was okay, nothing special.The place itself is spacious in the back and nice and sunny during the day thanks for a skylight. Planning on going for dinner and see what the vibes are like then.",4.0
"Living off of Graham Avenue, I am constantly explaining to taxi drivers the subtle but important difference between ""Grand"" and ""Graham,"" which been challenging if English is your third or fourth language. It also be difficult for people who learned English first, for the first couple of times I heard about this restaurant, I assumed we were discussing ""The Graham"" a bar that's been around for a couple years and is several blocks to the South. The Grand is more low-key than its neighbors. I arrived on a Sunday evening, sitting at the bar as one of three customers. The bartender was friendly without being intrusive and while a large back room indicates that sometime this place might draw a crowd, it was not omnipresent. While this neighborhood probably doesn't need a $14 grilled cheese sandwich (Normans Kill a few doors down has a a pretty great rendition with stone ground mustard and cheddar for half that) the ingredients and presentations in bar classics like the burger are well done. The mac and cheese at $11 is listed under small plates for no particular reason, except for the fact that it might drive down the average price of the entrees. (Again, that grilled cheese price point is a problem.) The mac is a great meal with a beer or two. The zest of the citrus breadcrumbs combine nice with the tang of the parmesan. It's probably better than East Wick's which is pretty high praise in the East Williamsburg mac department. Like any good neighborhood joint, there are things on the menu that will convince me to return, including the 10 draft wines and house made pierorgies, neither of which can be found on Graham Avenue.",4.0
"This place is absolutely beautiful - the enormous woodland paintings, the large comfortable booths and the dark brick and woodwork interiors give a unique atmosphere.  Like, if you were location scouting  for a moody film noir movie set in a 1950s woodland lodge, this would be your spot.  It feels a little rustic, a little mysterious, and totally someplace that you want to spend an evening sipping Old Fashioneds.  Speaking of Old Fashions, their drinks are delicious, as is their food.  The burger is great, on par with DuMont (which is one of my favorites).  All the staff are super nice as well.  Came here twice for two different birthday dinners, and the place is perfect for getting large groups of people together.",5.0
"My friend and I were looking for buffalo wings, and this ended up being our spirit bar.  The buffalo wings were perfect, drenched in buffalo sauce and perfectly cooked.  My friend then got blue point oysters and they looked great.  I wasn't hungry but also got the Mac n cheese because I can't pass it up.  It was a bit oily but delicious w a type of creme fresh on top.  We both only had one drink, which was good.  The bartender was super nice and attentive.One drawback was it was a bit expensive for what I like to pay for buffalo wings but worth it nonetheless.",5.0
"This place is GOOD. I went for comedy this past week & stuck around for some drinks because I was having such a great time.

This place is honestly just so bad. Service was horrible. Waiter had an attitude. Brought us coffees and no milk. I had to go to the bar to ask the bartender for milk. No sugar or salt+ pepper on the tables. Crispy pork belly brunch item was gross and tasted like the pork was DEFINITELY expired.

"I can't help but give this bar five full stars.  At first it looks like a typical bar.  Spacious.  Big room in the back, perfect for parties.  But the food is way above your average bar food.  And the best Manhattan I've had in a really long time. Maybe the best Manhattan ever.  The menu is small, but everything we've had was outstanding.  Fresh blue point oysters; the whole wheat pasta was excellent.  I had steamed clams too.  OMG, they were VERY, VERY good.  Fresh clams cooked in a savory wine sauce.  We asked for more bread. Crusty and delicious. I bet you they have amazing burgers. Will go back. Check it out!",5.0
Good wings and burger but just a tad bit expensive. A good option from all the other eat in places on Grand Street. Say hi to Erik the owner when you stop by. Plenty of space in the front and the back. Don't forget to check out the huge Elk in the back!,4.0
"If you're looking for tasty food and drinks and a cozy atmosphere without hoity toity service, go here. Our server Clark was just phenomenal. We were having a Canadian themed shindig (please do not judge me. I am not from Canada but my friend is), and he completely helped us pull it off without batting an eyelash. The mac and cheese will make you forsake your friends and run to the bathroom with the plate and the clams and oysters smell of the sea (in a good way).The back room is lovely and Sun bathed in the daytime and reminiscent of a mountain lodge in the evening.

Not only did he agree to move most of the tables down to the basement so we'd have maximum space for our 150 guests, he also decorated the bar earlier than usual so we'd have holiday decor for our party. He also hooked us up with a great doorman (what up Roddy!), coat check area, and a friendly, attentive bar staff. The bar was crowded but I never had to wait more than a couple minutes to be served. There are not many bars this large in Williamsburg, and most of the others are more expensive to rent for a private event, or have a layout that's not as conducive to a big party. We were happy to have had our party here. Thanks Eric!",5.0
"Great happy hour deals, interesting folk, and good food. Came here with a buddy because we wanted wings and wanted to be in Wburg and Yelp was helping us out on that one. We cabbed it to Wburg and dropped in on a seasonably warm autumn evening. The windows were open at The Grand and we sat on stools near the windows. The food and drink deals were 2 for 1, so we got some Bronx Pale Ales and some wings, one teriyaki and one regular buffalo red whatever hot. My buddy preferred the former and I the latter and while we shared those wings, we really just ended up swapping plates. We also ordered some mac and cheese, which was pretty great, aside from the enormous dollop of ricotta in the middle of it which neither of us touched. (Some people might like ricotta, I grant that.)In the middle of our meal, some guy at the bar offered us his old-fashioned, because he ordered the 2-for-1 deal and there was no way he was going to finish both. I shook his hand to thank him and introduced myself. He sort of looked at me like there-are-eight-million-people-in-New-York-the-chances-we-will-ever-interact-again-are-about-nil-so-why-bother-with-the-niceties (which was ironic because he was offering niceties to me in other ways), but he gave me his name anyway. It was Homer. The old-fashioned was okay.",4.0
Always a fan of places that stay open late and still offer good eats. Ordered the burger with greens and mac and cherse. Definitely a must go!,5.0
"You simply cannot go wrong with The Grand. Certainly lives up to its name with a Spacious restaurant/bar, tasty wings and friendly staff. But seriously those wings, just order them upon walking through the front door and ponder about everything else later.Our waiter was knew the menu very well and took great care of our party of 12 people. The resturant does not blast music for no reason so you mix n mingle within the group.  Rather than stuck shouting in one person's ear next to you. I've only visited once but impressed by the cozy atmosphere, quality food and great service. In short, stop by The Grand if you're in the area. You won't be disappointed.",4.0
"Always mellow and spacious with excellent food. The draft selection is excellent and the burger, while pricy ($16), is juicy and impeccably cooked. If you don't want to deal with asshole hipsters and have a good meal while watching sports, this is the best bet in the area.",5.0
The Grand is a great addition to the neighborhood. The bar itself is beautiful with dark wood walls and bar. The staff has always been really nice. The food is great. I love their shisito peppers and friend enoki mushrooms (I believe that was a special). The burgers are great - just the right amount of delicious gooey greasiness (and I mean that in a good way!) The mac and cheese is amazing.They have a dollar oyster happy hour and wing specials.,5.0
"I happened upon this place for brunch on a hangry mission for burgers. I ordered the burger with an egg on top, cuz I'm a bause. The burger itself was seasoned nicely, a bit on the salty side, but I like that. It was nice because most places just give you a hunk of meat and you're forced to add ketchup to make it taste good... even if it is grass fed or whatever (the neighborhood just keeps getting more obvious). The burger was a little on the greasy side though, so make sure you have plenty of napkins. It came with fries, and they were also yum, but they give you a lot! Danger zone! The bloody maria I ordered was okay, nothing special.The place itself is spacious in the back and nice and sunny during the day thanks for a skylight. Planning on going for dinner and see what the vibes are like then.",4.0
"Living off of Graham Avenue, I am constantly explaining to taxi drivers the subtle but important difference between ""Grand"" and ""Graham,"" which been challenging if English is your third or fourth language. It also be difficult for people who learned English first, for the first couple of times I heard about this restaurant, I assumed we were discussing ""The Graham"" a bar that's been around for a couple years and is several blocks to the South. The Grand is more low-key than its neighbors. I arrived on a Sunday evening, sitting at the bar as one of three customers. The bartender was friendly without being intrusive and while a large back room indicates that sometime this place might draw a crowd, it was not omnipresent. While this neighborhood probably doesn't need a $14 grilled cheese sandwich (Normans Kill a few doors down has a a pretty great rendition with stone ground mustard and cheddar for half that) the ingredients and presentations in bar classics like the burger are well done. The mac and cheese at $11 is listed under small plates for no particular reason, except for the fact that it might drive down the average price of the entrees. (Again, that grilled cheese price point is a problem.) The mac is a great meal with a beer or two. The zest of the citrus breadcrumbs combine nice with the tang of the parmesan. It's probably better than East Wick's which is pretty high praise in the East Williamsburg mac department. Like any good neighborhood joint, there are things on the menu that will convince me to return, including the 10 draft wines and house made pierorgies, neither of which can be found on Graham Avenue.",4.0
"This place is absolutely beautiful - the enormous woodland paintings, the large comfortable booths and the dark brick and woodwork interiors give a unique atmosphere.  Like, if you were location scouting  for a moody film noir movie set in a 1950s woodland lodge, this would be your spot.  It feels a little rustic, a little mysterious, and totally someplace that you want to spend an evening sipping Old Fashioneds.  Speaking of Old Fashions, their drinks are delicious, as is their food.  The burger is great, on par with DuMont (which is one of my favorites).  All the staff are super nice as well.  Came here twice for two different birthday dinners, and the place is perfect for getting large groups of people together.",5.0
"My friend and I were looking for buffalo wings, and this ended up being our spirit bar.  The buffalo wings were perfect, drenched in buffalo sauce and perfectly cooked.  My friend then got blue point oysters and they looked great.  I wasn't hungry but also got the Mac n cheese because I can't pass it up.  It was a bit oily but delicious w a type of creme fresh on top.  We both only had one drink, which was good.  The bartender was super nice and attentive.One drawback was it was a bit expensive for what I like to pay for buffalo wings but worth it nonetheless.",5.0
"This place is GOOD. I went for comedy this past week & stuck around for some drinks because I was having such a great time.

This place is honestly just so bad. Service was horrible. Waiter had an attitude. Brought us coffees and no milk. I had to go to the bar to ask the bartender for milk. No sugar or salt+ pepper on the tables. Crispy pork belly brunch item was gross and tasted like the pork was DEFINITELY expired.

"I can't help but give this bar five full stars.  At first it looks like a typical bar.  Spacious.  Big room in the back, perfect for parties.  But the food is way above your average bar food.  And the best Manhattan I've had in a really long time. Maybe the best Manhattan ever.  The menu is small, but everything we've had was outstanding.  Fresh blue point oysters; the whole wheat pasta was excellent.  I had steamed clams too.  OMG, they were VERY, VERY good.  Fresh clams cooked in a savory wine sauce.  We asked for more bread. Crusty and delicious. I bet you they have amazing burgers. Will go back. Check it out!",5.0
Good wings and burger but just a tad bit expensive. A good option from all the other eat in places on Grand Street. Say hi to Erik the owner when you stop by. Plenty of space in the front and the back. Don't forget to check out the huge Elk in the back!,4.0
"If you're looking for tasty food and drinks and a cozy atmosphere without hoity toity service, go here. Our server Clark was just phenomenal. We were having a Canadian themed shindig (please do not judge me. I am not from Canada but my friend is), and he completely helped us pull it off without batting an eyelash. The mac and cheese will make you forsake your friends and run to the bathroom with the plate and the clams and oysters smell of the sea (in a good way).The back room is lovely and Sun bathed in the daytime and reminiscent of a mountain lodge in the evening.
