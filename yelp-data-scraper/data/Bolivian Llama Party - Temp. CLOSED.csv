"And they are back!!!! No longer at Smorgasburg and now in a permanent space at Turnstyle. I've been waiting for this all year. So excited I can now satisfy my salteña cravings all year round.When I came on the 3rd day of opening, they had the second longest line among all the vendors. The line was pretty manageable though. I got my two favorites: the Cliza (smoked oyster mushrooms, quinoa) and the Chimba (chicken). The salteña were as hefty as before and brimming with the saucy fillings. Best part is still the hard boiled egg. I couldn't wait any longer to eat these so instead of taking them back, I found a little table at Turnstyle and demolished them in 5 min. I probably looked super messy and embarrassing in my haste, but it was a blissful moment. A few people even came over to ask where I got the salteña from. They look that good. I came back two days later and got the Beni (beef). Previously, when they were at Smorgasburg, my favorites in order were the mushroom, chicken, and then beef. I think the beef is my new favorite one now.I also tried to get the Toco (pork belly, smoked ham hock, pork shoulder) on Saturday, but that day they only had the Beni (beef) and the Chimba (chicken). They said since weekends are slow for them they made less variety, but will have all the varieties again on Monday. I guess I'll just have to come back on Monday then.",5.0
"I must admit that I have never eaten Bolivian food before so today is for sure a record day for me. Was about to order the Saltenas (baked empanadas) however they were all sold out. Not really in a mood for sandwich, I grabbed the quinoa salad. Must say the crimini mushroom and dried cherries taste really great with the panka vinegar dressing. Kale seems to be charred so was also very flavorful. Now it made me wanna try their main dish even more!Apparently there will be more pop-ups opening up in the foreseeable future (e.g. Urbanspace at Vanderbilt), and I'm looking forward to more food options (and higher inventories)!",5.0
"The Bolivian Llama Party (stylized as LLAMA Party in person, perhaps to emphasize how you should feel after eating it) was tucked into a corner of the Brooklyn Shuffleboard Club. While waiting hours for our lane to open, my party of 12 or so decided to line our stomachs with some high carb fare ahead of a night of drinking. Let's start with the fries - the fries were damp, cold and clearly past their serve-by time. There was some nice seasoning on time, but frankly there was no saving this turd. A couple members of our party had to wait about 10 minutes and were given fresher fries, but no one should be given what we were given. The chola was much better. A gutbomb of multiple kinds of pork, cheese, onions and chiles, I imagine it as the perfect solution to staying energized at the high Bolivian altitudes. It also is O.K. to be served at different temperatures, which is key when dealing with the random crowds and demands of the shuffleboard life. I hope the forthcoming Kickstarter and reopening will allow for better food across the board, because this is a solid idea.",3.0
"Location: I normally do not have time to chase after a food truck. Thanks to Broadway Bite, I have the chance to take a look, enjoy a bite, and embrace the Nov..Food: I had  vegeterian Saltena. It is amazing, delicious and adventurious. I love the moisture, juciness of the juice coming from saltena. It is sweet, but not much, balanced with mushrooms, half boiled egg, and so on. When I asked if they have any sauces, they gave me their fantastic spicy sauces. OMG, best moderate spice combing with the juice, it is just a bless to have saltena for a late night bite.Price&service: not much a service thing, but vegeterian saltena is 6 dollars. I think it's pretty fair since I am pretty full after eating the saltena.Overall: the best food among Broadway Bite. And yes, 5 stars! I will try something else if I do have time to chase this food truck!",5.0

"Oh my!  Stumbled upon Smorgasburg on a hot and humid Sunday as I was sightseeing Brooklyn.  Took a quick look at Yelp and ended up at the Bolivian Llama Party stand with a craving for this thing they call the triple pork sandwich de chola that includes braised pork shoulder, pork belly cracklin, and home cured bacon.  I got the slider and it came out looking mostly like a pulled pork sammy but oh my porky baby jesus, I took one bite and was in heaven.  Perfectly seasoned, juicy, greasy in a good way and just perfect, it was down the hatch in under 30 seconds.  If you are at Smorgasburg, don't miss this treat, it is too good to miss!",5.0
Had the beef and pork sliders.  Smells and tasted good for street vendor at urban space 3 4th st. The pork slider was so juicy and the flavors lasted for hours in your mouth! Had to buy 3 more for family but it did not taste that good after hours. Great combination with pickles onion cheese & bacon. Very friendly cashier and cook.Overall :  2.8,3.0
"The best thing at smorgasburg, don't waste your time getting sweaty at other stands, come early and leave happy. We had the beef saltena ( I called it an empanada and they looked at me weird, heck it looks like an empanada come on ), It was amazing, like a Jamaican beef patty that got less dry and more flavorful while fattening up.",5.0
"Had my company holiday party at Royal Palms Shuffleboard last night. It was the monthly rotation of food and fortunately we were there to experience the Bolivian Llama Party. Wasn't sure what to expect as I have several vegetarians and picky eaters among the group. The food was fantastic and the service equally as excellent!! The Saltenas were outstanding, the pork sliders were one of my faves, the nachos w/ truffle aioli and kale salad were also huge hits!! I highly recommend you find one in a location near you... you don't want to miss out!! Thank you Alex for a great experience!! My co-workers are still talking about the food!",5.0
"The Maracuya Lemonade was Love at first sip. This place came highly recommended from a friend who is a chef and I trust his judgment. If someone told me it was possible to pack that much flavor in a sandwich I would not believe. I am converted today. The sautéed pork is fresh and the pickled carrot, bacon and cheese is a beautiful marriage. You should attend. I was not disappointed.",5.0
"""Wow, okay, did not expect that.""My exact words when I bit into my triple pork sandwich de chola. Since it was my first stop at Sunday's Smorgasburg, I did not expect to fall in love so fast -- I mean, I just got here! I can say with 100% confidence that Bolivian Llama Party ruined my Smorgasburg experience because I just kept comparing the other food stands to this one. Not much else could really compare to their papitas with quilquina cilantro sauce, hibiscus lemonade soda and of course, sandwiches. These three things set me back $18, but I loved it too much to notice my wallet getting lighter. Line was pretty long, but as reviewers had mentioned, it moved fast. I kept hopping on line for seconds and thirds, and at one point one of the chefs had recognized me and threw in a free rose lemonade soda on the house. The awesome vibes (they also have some side seating for 3 around their booth!) and chill music (old skool hip hop and KRS One) makes Bolivian Llama Party the highlight of my Smorgasburg experience.",5.0
"This place is incredible and the beef brisket sandwich melted in my mouth.  I ordered it with medium heat and that was perfect (I don't do ""hot""). Only reason I went with 4 stars was because it was tough to find given the Yelp location and there's no dining area. I'll Definatly be back soon!!  Great crispy French fries too.",4.0
My cousins and I decided to come to Smorgasburg to try out some foods. I've been to Bolivian Llama Party two years in a roll and they have never disappointed! We tried the chicken and beef saltena and each were full of flavors. I highly recommend tasting their Mango Maracuya and Maracuya-lemonade soda! Would love to come back again for the third time next year!Ramen Burger vs Bolivian - Bolivian all the way! You have my full support!,4.0
Delicious saltenas!! I had the beef saltena which looks like a giant empanda but doughier. Inside was stuffed with beef packed with flavor and was so juicy! not to mention there was a boiled egg inside! it tasted sweet but with the hot sauce on the side it was perfect! The beef brisket sandwich was also delicious. There was a crunch to it and im not quite sure what it was but I loved everything about it.,5.0
I got the vegetarian saltena. It was way too soupy. I would recommend a different kind of filling.,3.0
"I visited their booth at Smorgasburg and had to get both the triple pork and Bolivian brisket. The brisket is my favorite of these two. As I bit into it I had an internal struggle of just letting the flavor sit on my tongue or to continue eating. The flavor was so subtle and complex as is expected when you use 10 spices. The guys there are a fun bunch and bring energy to the Smorgasburg. It's a complete package with great good, and people who love crafting unique twists to street food.",5.0
"Unfortunately for me there was no non-beef/pork option for their sandwiches. Fortunately for me, that meant I had to go with a chicken salteña. At $6 a pop, you may think that's a bit much for something resembling an empanada, but folks let me tell you there is way more to this than any old empanada. First off all, the salteña is much heftier than it looks and that's because it's filled with a delicious flavorful stew, the juices of which will certainly be dribbling down your chin as you eat this thing. FYI, they do put a bit of hard boiled egg in the stew as well!In addition, the outside ""shell"" is quite different from that of an empanada - it's baked and way thicker with a doughier consistency. I actually kinda wished it wasn't so thick or that there was more stew inside so that I could get a better filling to dough ratio, but at least it allowed the salteña to hold up really well.I was also surprised to note the sweetness in the dough, but it went well with the spicy sauce and crumbled cheese they give you in tiny cups. Make sure to drizzle a bit of each on top of the salteña before each bite!To wash it all down, I got a homemade rose petal soda, which had a good pronounced rose flavor but was lacking depth - it basically tasted as if it was only rose syrup mixed with seltzer. $4 for a small and $6 for a large.Overall, this place is definitely worth a try!",4.0
"Add some Bolivian sun, some heat, and whole lot of smile and you get this place. This place is without words a place where you can have mouth watering food with a side of great customer service. I was here in smorgburgs, where they tret me like a king. Suggesting food based on my tastebuds. They have saltenas, which fire your taste buds with sweet and spicy kick and  to finish it off work a coming rose lemonade. Definitely a place to go at least once.",5.0
"Ordered fries today at the location over at Broadway Bites on 34th street. At first glance they looked really good, however, upon tasting I realized they were soggy and wet. It wasn't like they served me full on watery fries, but they were a little soggy and it was to the point where I couldn't even finish them because I couldn't stand it. They weren't warm either, it was as if they were there all day (I arrived there around 1pm) and they dipped them in water and handed them to me. It was very disappointing. The green dipping sauce was pretty good though, but, it was the only positive part about this experience. I might go back again, maybe in the morning when they fresh.",2.0

Friendly service. They don't have a store front brick and mortar location so you can just find them at food fairs like this. I think their main outpost is out at Rockaway Beach during the summer.,4.0

"I tried these guys at Smorgasburg a few weeks back, and they were great!  I ordered a pork saltena and a mango soda (which was incredible), leaving me incredibly full for $10.  Only downside was it was a bit messy and hard to eat on the move.  I would like to try them again, but perhaps at their actual store.  Great tasting, affordable food though!",4.0
"Those cholitas (sliders) are AMAZING.  Totally worth the $5.  Experienced BLP for the first time on Friday while at the BK Night Bazaar.   So glad we chose to try both the brisket and pork cholitas with the 10 toppings.  Each bite was better than the last, with amazingly complex flavours. Thinking back to write this review is making me salivate, seriously jonsing for one right now in the worst way.",5.0
"Sooo good - that's according to my taste buds, but my wife, who's Bolivian (so she knows what's the what when it comes to Salteñas), was pleasantly surprised that the dough is 100% the real deal authentic as La Paz. Bolivian Llama Party serves up the only Salteñas worth eating in NYC (if you know of any others, message me! But until then, this is it for us).",5.0
"I have had many sandwiches in my day, some delicious and some awful. None have ever tasted as amazing as the sandwich I had today...the brisket chola sandwich. Upon biting this art form, I felt an explosion of flavor.. this sandwich took me somewhere else. I don't think I will ever look at  sandwiches the same. Subways just doesn't cut it.",5.0
"They were a vendor at the Brooklyn Night Bazaar, and were the definite hit of the night. The garlic/lemon aioli sauce was amazing, and the staff was very friendly. The fries sold out quickly or else we would have been back for thirds.",5.0
"The salteñas, pockets of stewed beef with an egg and other things, are really good. Also have good homemade sodas with passion fruit and other interesting flavors.",5.0
"That chola slider would be my last meal on earth, hands down.",5.0
The staff is super friendly and their salteñas are so good! Chicken and beef were both excellent! We plan on coming again and would definitely recommend it to others coming to Smorgasburg!,5.0
"Guys, I was at the Brooklyn smorgasbord and we tried 3 items here. GET THE BRISKET! It is easily the best food I've had in New York on my trip. I had it as a slider, but wish I had gotten a sandwich. I've been taste testing all over this food frenzy and I wish I had more room for this place. GET IT! The triple pork slider and quinoa saltena are also good, but that brisket. I had to pause for a minute and rethink my other food choices that day. It's that good. Enjoy.",5.0
It was my first time trying Bolivian Llama Party in Brooklyn. Pulled pork chola sandwich was amazing!!!! These guys definitely know what their doing. Also try the Maracuya-lemonade soda.. Delicious and refreshing!,5.0
"Was told by a smorgasburg staff member that this was the best booth food wise and it didn't disappoint. The triple pork sandwich is amazing! So many flavors coming together beautifully and the medium was just the right amount of spice. The staff looks like they have fun on the job doing what they're supposed to be doing, which I think always makes for better quality food and service. Also the name is awesome, even though I don't know what it means if anything other than just to be funny and memorable.",5.0

"It was me and my husband's first time at the Smorgasburg at the East River Park in Williamsburg. We tried a few different food trucks/stands and everything was really really good. Then we arrived at the Bolivian Llama Party stand and tried their Brisket slider and it absolutely blew our mind. It wasn't good,  it was truly great. The flavors exploded in your mouth and took your tastebuds somewhere else. Not only was the food outstanding,  the customer service was incredible. Everyone was so nice and really added to the great experience. I absolute recommend you visit one of their locations and try this amazingness for yourself.",5.0
There wasn't much of a line and the wait for the food was decent. I tried the triple pork sandwich and got it mild. It was pretty darn good. Definitely wouldn't mind coming here again! (: The people at the booth were also really friendly. Try this place!,5.0
"You literally get a taste of real delicious authentic Bolivian cuisine. Being Bolivian let me tell you, it's hard to find Bolivian food around the New York/New Jersey area. Finally got a taste of home :) try the Saltenas and sandwiches de chola super delish!",5.0

"OMG, totally unbelievable!! We visited them at Smorgasburg flea market today. They have Veggie salteñas and homemade Bolivian soda flavored with a Bolivian tropical fruit called maracuya!  (*faints, dies*)  LOL.  Guys, you cannot miss this gem. Follow them on social media too.",5.0
"The saltena (any flavor) is one of my favorite foods in the world.  Looks like an empanada, but it is like a delicious stew inside, and the shell is like a sweet cornbread.  Whether it's the Rockaways or Smorgasburg, we always eat at Boliviian Llama Party when available.",5.0
"I am addicted to the triple pork sandwich here ( smorgasbord, East River Park). This is quite possibly the best sandwich in NYC. And the people that work here are super sweet too.",5.0

"The saltenas are mind blowing - incredibly juicy filling. We had the triple pork special but the beef and chicken look amazing as well. Try the mango soda to wash it down! Even better, the line was short, the food came quickly, and the staff were extra friendly. Ordering another right now!",5.0
