Very good neighborhood place. Counter people are nice and food is always good. Come early especially on Saturdays.,4.0
Delicious coffee.  Super kind and generous owners.  I also wanted express my sincere gratitude to Gratitude for donating delicious sandwiches/pastries/coffee to PLG Neighborhood Forum for street safety in PLG.  I live in the neighborhood and this place always makes me happy and always full of locals.  High time I sent out a little positive praise!,5.0
"This is a nice, comfortable cafe and a cool addition to the neighborhood. The staff is friendly and the breakfast I had was good. I'd definitely go back again.",5.0
"What a great neighborhood spot. It's got a warm, cozy environment and a simple no-frills sandwich menu. Chill music plays on the speakers as little kids play with the blocks reserved for them in the kiddie corner. Smoothies are good, service is always friendly, and the owners live nearby and care about the neighborhood. I especially appreciate them keeping gluten free bread on hand, which opens up options for wheat averse foodies.",5.0
I love living walking distance from this adorable cafe. Yummy sandwiches and pastries. Reasonable prices. Always super crowded but worth going anyways.,5.0
"I'm full of gratitude for this cafe. It's a nice friendly cheerful place to hang out with a cup of coffee. It's very child-friendly and all the stay-at-home moms come here with their toddlers. There's a small play area for the kids, where they happily play while their parents chat over a cup of joe.They also serve pastries and bagels for breakfast.",4.0
"This place has gotten my order wrong too many times even though the girl at the register writes down my exact order. I always order a bagel with vegan cream cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion. They usually put regular cream cheese on the bagel instead of vegan then I have to give it back because I can't eat regular cream cheese. Today they didn't put the lettuce, tomato, or onion on the bagel. I took it to go and when I got home I couldn't go all the way back just to get them to fix my bagel. The girl even wrote it down on the paper. So I don't understand how they get orders wrong so often. This makes me not want to continue going here because of how frustrating and inconvenient it is to order a simple bagel.",2.0
Great restaurant ! The food and smoothies are awesome. We feel the good taste of organic food. The staff is also kind. I hugely recommend this restaurant !,5.0
Finally made it to the cafe very impressive nice music player atmosphere is nice I ordered a shot of expresso drunk it there about time I got to my door I was feeling great   tomato mozzarella basil taste good was very surprised to see the place packed on a Thursday at 12 o'clock on Rogers Avenue will be back again to try the adventure  of menu,4.0
"Gratitude Cafe is an amazing little slice of heaven, and a very special place. These folks know how to care for their customers, it's very much like entering a small town cafe; where everyone knows your name and you just feel warm and cozy from the moment you walk in the doors. It sort of reminds me of some cafes I've been to in Buffalo and Burlington, Vermont. You may forget you're even in Brooklyn especially since Prospect Lefferts is one of the most ""neighborly"" feeling areas in Brooklyn.They seem to put great focus on sourcing their ingredients organically and locally, which is admirable considering their prices are not through the roof. Their bacon egg and cheddar croissant is one of the best egg sandwiches I've ever had, and it's refreshing to see a place cook eggs perfectly without even having to make a specific request (the egg came medium well both times that I ordered this sandwich)They also seem very kid friendly, and study friendly as well (some how those 2 usually wouldn't go together, but they have a little play area which seems to keep the little ones quietly entertained)If 6 stars were possible, Gratitude would get it!",5.0

"Leffert's Garden really has such limited options at this point, and what exists already are pretty poor attempts at filling the voids. Gratitude Cafe is clearly leading the pack.It's a husband and wife team that own it and primarily run it.

When they first opened it was a typical small business situation; there was only so much $$$ and lots of ideas. But literally since day one, they have continued to reinvest in the business and have grown incredibly well. Definitely recommend. (and everyone else in the area should take a few notes)",4.0

I'm upping the rating to 4 stars as a result, and planning to check the place out again.===Nice little cafe in the neighborhood, and seemed like a great place to hang out.  Staff were friendly, and the vibe cool, food just OK.  We ordered breakfast sandwiches on brioche, tea and a latte.  Drinks were standard, but the sandwiches just so-so.  Basically, the bread-to-other-ingredients ratio was WAY too high: it's rare that I don't finish my breakfast, but after mouthful after mouthful of dryish bread I couldn't do it.  I think a little butter or avocado, or maybe a tomato slice, would go a long way here.",4.0

Ordered the cheddar chive biscuit with bacon egg and cheese in it for $5.50. I enjoyed it very much. Tasty and had a nice kick to it. The doughnuts they had looked yummy but $3 for a doughnut is steep. I would definitely come back though. Pretty decent spot for the neighborhood :),4.0

The cafe itself is rather large with lots of room to spread out and sit to do a little work if you need, free wifi. Now I don't have kids but if I did, I would totally appreciate the little kiddy play section they have. My only warning is, if your a 20-30 and need to get some work done during the week, DONT go in the late afternoon because it's crawling with those same screaming kids. Cute and all but not conducive to studying or working. Overall, rave reviews for this little PLG gem!",5.0

"I visited the café after reading all the raving reviews, and I was thoroughly impressed. It's a very homey café; not too big but with just enough tables and cute décor all throughout.The servers were all nice as well.I ordered the turkey avocado sandwich as a salad instead.My friend ordered the BLT sandwich. And my salad actually seemed to be a lot bigger than the sandwich.We were seated next to a dad and his two young children, and when the server brought over my salad, they both went ""Woah"" and asked ""What is that?""But although my friend had jokingly stated that he should have gotten the same dish as myself, he enjoyed his sandwich as well. And I absolutely loved my salad. It had the perfect ratio of every ingredient.We both also purchased cappuccinos to go, and the drinks were great as well.And my friend and I both think that it would be a great go-to place for parents with young children as well, as they can play/hang out in the small playground located in the middle of the café next to the register.I'd definitely recommend this place!",5.0
"I have never written a review on Yelp before, but feel compelled to share my thoughts about Gratitude Cafe.  Not only do they have the best coffee, smoothies and egg sandwiches around, but they have brought the community together in ways that I have never seen during my 20 years living in the neighborhood.

"I knew I would love this spot the first time I stepped in. The colorful seating, couch near the entrance, friendly staff.... As I looked up at the menu above the counter I realized that music was playing softly in the background and it happened to be a song that I didn't expect to hear outside of my moms living room. They were playing Sam Cooke! No not just any Sam Cooke, they were playing GOSPEL Sam Cooke. I PROMISE you hearing that song made me order coffee & a bagel and I sat down to take a quick trip down memory line...As I sipped away lost in my thoughts I realized not only was the coffee good but after living in this neighborhood 15yrs, I FINALLY got a REAL bagel!! It warms my heart that I no longer have to go to somebody else's hood just to get a good bagel. I love how cozy and at home this place feels. Whether I stop in for coffee and a quick read of the newspaper or to grab a sandwich n brownie for lunch Im never rushed out. Its truly my new sit & sip spot.

"Outrageously priced, and the most bitter iced coffee I've ever had, which unfortunately went straight to the trash. Very friendly staff and great environment, but can't say I would ever go again. For the 3.25 they charge for a croissant I can find myself a bacon egg and cheese elsewhere.",1.0

"Gratitude Cafe is a charming little coffee shop nestled in between the beautiful brownstone houses of Prospects Lefferts Gardens. This cute space offers an artsy ambience perfect for working, reading or catching up with a close friend. Their coffee is very good (bold, flavorful and deep) as are their iced teas (light/refreshing) and ice cream (cold, creamy goodness). I always like to pay a visit for my java fix whenever I am in the neighborhood. The baristas are also so friendly and warm. I'm grateful for Gratitude Cafe :)",5.0
"With one exception, I love pretty much everything about this place. The owners, Richard and Annalisa are absolutely the best. Just really sweet, helpful, kind people. I really want them to succeed, and I think they are well on their way.PROS-Good coffee. Really solid.-Lots of food options. Something for everyone. Bagels and pastries. Smoothies. Sandwiches. Lots of fresh ingredients.-Lots of seating. There are probably 8 tables, including one large picnic table. I think there are benches outside, too.-Local art on the walls.CON-Barista. Billy is there most mornings, and he is absolutely the most surly barista in Brooklyn. I remember him from when he worked at K-Dog and Dunebuggy (an old cafe over on Lincoln Road), and I was really disappointed when Gratitude hired him. He is frankly very rude and disrespectful, and he doesn't belong in a customer service position. I have witnessed lots of interactions in which he treats customers as though they are inconveniencing him by ordering a coffee. I've tolerated him for the past year or so, visiting Gratitude very frequently. But after a really negative experience with him a couple weeks ago, I haven't been back, and I don't really plan on it.Wishing Gratitude a lot of success, but hoping they part ways with their grumpiest employee. He's bringing the vibe of the place down.",3.0
"A great little cafe with solid food selection, reasonable prices and yummy coffee. The ambiance was great, the crowd was young and lively and my turkey avocado sandwich was excellent. Took a bit long to get my sandwich but it was $7.50 and came with chips and a pickle (that was flavored!) which is a good deal for BK. I'm rotating for school in the area for a while and I know I'll be back.",5.0
"This spot is incredible in so many ways. The food is delicious - though truthfully I can only speak to the amazing bacon, egg, and cheese which is my go-to. Coffee is always well-brewed. The workers are extremely polite, helpful, and friendly. The owners are true leaders in the neighborhood by setting an example of incredible servitude and neighborly love. They are always smiling and willing to assist with any needs - personally attending to small issues like a wobbly table. I always feel a great sense of community at Gratitude as the owners have created an environment where diverse groups of people from the neighborhood and beyond can come and feel relaxed and welcomed. I greatly appreciate  Gratitude's enriching contribution our neighborhood and its ability to celebrate the diversity of our neighbors.",5.0
"I love this place and it's a great addition to the neighborhood. Great sandwiches and a really nice space.

"I knew I would love this spot the first time I stepped in. The colorful seating, couch near the entrance, friendly staff.... As I looked up at the menu above the counter I realized that music was playing softly in the background and it happened to be a song that I didn't expect to hear outside of my moms living room. They were playing Sam Cooke! No not just any Sam Cooke, they were playing GOSPEL Sam Cooke. I PROMISE you hearing that song made me order coffee & a bagel and I sat down to take a quick trip down memory line...As I sipped away lost in my thoughts I realized not only was the coffee good but after living in this neighborhood 15yrs, I FINALLY got a REAL bagel!! It warms my heart that I no longer have to go to somebody else's hood just to get a good bagel. I love how cozy and at home this place feels. Whether I stop in for coffee and a quick read of the newspaper or to grab a sandwich n brownie for lunch Im never rushed out. Its truly my new sit & sip spot. Oh and I appreciate that the menu isn't fussy and the food is clean and simple. So glad this opened up.",5.0
"Sometimes you have to wait a bit, but it's worth it. This is my new go-to study spot. It's got good food (i can only speak for bagels and breakfast sandwiches), GREAT coffee, and a very relaxed atmosphere. I can work half the day away in one of the nooks and crannies of this place.",4.0
"Outrageously priced, and the most bitter iced coffee I've ever had, which unfortunately went straight to the trash. Very friendly staff and great environment, but can't say I would ever go again. For the 3.25 they charge for a croissant I can find myself a bacon egg and cheese elsewhere.",1.0
"Great, laid back atmosphere.  Coffee was delicious and food was great.  I recommend that they put some cushions on their bench as it can get a bit  uncomfortable.",4.0
"From Jersey, stopped in at this local coffee shop had a few hours to kill while in Brooklyn.  It's an amazing comforting and welcoming atmosphere.  Definitely a local spot where everyone knows everyone.  Staff was pleasant.  Had the organic eggs bacon and cheddar on a croissant - and it was delicious!  Few hours later tried the purple shake (I think that was what it was called) and it was very filling but wasn't a big fan of the peanut butter mixed with berries an banana.  Great place, definatly visit again if I'm in the area.",5.0
"Gratitude Cafe is a charming little coffee shop nestled in between the beautiful brownstone houses of Prospects Lefferts Gardens. This cute space offers an artsy ambience perfect for working, reading or catching up with a close friend. Their coffee is very good (bold, flavorful and deep) as are their iced teas (light/refreshing) and ice cream (cold, creamy goodness). I always like to pay a visit for my java fix whenever I am in the neighborhood. The baristas are also so friendly and warm. I'm grateful for Gratitude Cafe :)",5.0
"With one exception, I love pretty much everything about this place. The owners, Richard and Annalisa are absolutely the best. Just really sweet, helpful, kind people. I really want them to succeed, and I think they are well on their way.PROS-Good coffee. Really solid.-Lots of food options. Something for everyone. Bagels and pastries. Smoothies. Sandwiches. Lots of fresh ingredients.-Lots of seating. There are probably 8 tables, including one large picnic table. I think there are benches outside, too.-Local art on the walls.CON-Barista. Billy is there most mornings, and he is absolutely the most surly barista in Brooklyn. I remember him from when he worked at K-Dog and Dunebuggy (an old cafe over on Lincoln Road), and I was really disappointed when Gratitude hired him. He is frankly very rude and disrespectful, and he doesn't belong in a customer service position. I have witnessed lots of interactions in which he treats customers as though they are inconveniencing him by ordering a coffee. I've tolerated him for the past year or so, visiting Gratitude very frequently. But after a really negative experience with him a couple weeks ago, I haven't been back, and I don't really plan on it.Wishing Gratitude a lot of success, but hoping they part ways with their grumpiest employee. He's bringing the vibe of the place down.",3.0
"A great little cafe with solid food selection, reasonable prices and yummy coffee. The ambiance was great, the crowd was young and lively and my turkey avocado sandwich was excellent. Took a bit long to get my sandwich but it was $7.50 and came with chips and a pickle (that was flavored!) which is a good deal for BK. I'm rotating for school in the area for a while and I know I'll be back.",5.0
"This spot is incredible in so many ways. The food is delicious - though truthfully I can only speak to the amazing bacon, egg, and cheese which is my go-to. Coffee is always well-brewed. The workers are extremely polite, helpful, and friendly. The owners are true leaders in the neighborhood by setting an example of incredible servitude and neighborly love. They are always smiling and willing to assist with any needs - personally attending to small issues like a wobbly table. I always feel a great sense of community at Gratitude as the owners have created an environment where diverse groups of people from the neighborhood and beyond can come and feel relaxed and welcomed. I greatly appreciate  Gratitude's enriching contribution our neighborhood and its ability to celebrate the diversity of our neighbors.",5.0

"I really enjoyed the chill atmosphere of this neighborhood cafe. The patrons seem to be ""regulars"" and the coffee was good.

They have a kid play area and was well occupied by many energetic kids. It's not a big place but I felt it had a good amount of seating and free wifi.

They've got free wifi, and great seating throughout. Specifically about their food/drinks- the Americano is excellent, their drip coffee is really good as well.
