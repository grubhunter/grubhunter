"At first, I really did not like this like place because it seems like a take out store however their food wow'd me. I always always crave for their baked rice and pan fried noodles with no sauce. I've been wanting to find a place just like the way they made it. I used to go to 8th avenue for their type of baked rice however, they've closed down a few years back. I would go to Chinatown for their type of pan fried noodles, but it's way too far to go just for one dish. I looooove those two food. Now I can have both by just walking a few blocks! I'm so glad they have opened up. Since I live close by I usually call them 20 minutes before hand so I come and pick it up and go home and eat it. One down side is that the baked rice takes around 30 minutes or even 45 minutes to make. It always take a very long time. But for good food, I'll definitely wait. Regardless where I eat, this food is still delicious!",5.0
"I come here way too often for their breakfast special. I have never been to Hong Kong, but all my colleagues from Hong Kong say this is one of the most authentic Hong Kong style cafes in NYC. And even if it wasn't, I would still keep coming back!The decor is very plain and old school looking, they don't try to pull customers in with fancy decorations because the food speaks for itself. The breakfast specials are so worth the price, even though they've risen somewhat in the past few years.Me and my boyfriend usually get breakfast set E and B, respectively. Set E is pork with salted vegetables in mei fun (rice noodles), with hot dog (they call it sausage), an egg, and a drink. Set B is ham and macaroni, bacon, an egg, butter or jam on toast, and a drink. I usually ask for my egg over hard, because the default way they make it, bits of the egg white is still raw, which I find too slimy for my taste. The noodle type can be substituted (instant noodle costs extra, which I found strange because it's like 10 cents a pack), but the hot dog and bacon are not interchangeable :( The drinks that come with the breakfast sets is a small, hot milk tea or coffee, but can be substituted with other drinks for extra.I also love getting the pineapple bun with butter. Sometimes it comes out amazing (hot bun, cold slab of butter), but other times the butter is all melted into the bun already, but still tasty.The food is good. It is simple food after all, but they do it well. I love that they serve Hong Kong style milk tea (DUH! Hong Kong style cafe), but it is the only place around that area that serves it, including that other Hong Kong style restaurant down the street. I also love that the hot Hong Kong style milk tea is actually somewhat more freshly brewed because you see the silk/mesh strainers and the pots they make it in, versus a lot of other bakeries that premake it and leave it in the metal dispenser thingy (sorry, don't know what it's called) or even worse, just use Hong Kong style flavor tea bags. Lost a star because recently, they've been short staffed by one employee on Saturdays so the service has suffered because of that. The last 2 times I went, the table wasn't cleared (even after customers were seated) until the food came out. I can tell that the employees are working really hard to keep up, but it gets insanely busy on Saturday (that's the only day I can speak for since that's when I go). Management needs to hire someone or bring back the former employee. I don't even know if she quit or just stopped working on Saturday.",4.0
"I've been a loyal customer since their old location. However, they closed down due to lease expiration and I was so happy when I found out they reopened at this new location.  This is my go to spot for quick and good food.  Their name says it's a bakery, however, they have an extensive list of Chinese (Hong Kong) style dishes.  It's basically a cafe with minimal table service where you place your order at the counter, seat yourself, pay and they bring out the food for you or you take it to go.  However, you don't have to clean up after you're done eating.  They will clean up for you.  Tips are optional.I love their Hk milk tea and cold FW lemon tea, the tea is heavily brewed so it tastes very different from the regular tea.  I also love their breakfast sets, they are good and reasonably priced.  (Breakfast sets ends at 11am)If you want to give Hong Kong style cafe food a try, this is the place to be.  Reason I'm giving a 4 star is they changed their operation hours.  Monday-Thursday it's 9-5 and Friday and Saturday are 9-9.  So I can only go during weekends now if I'm craving for their dishes for dinner and they get really busy during peak hours on weekends especially for breakfast.",4.0
"Good food with minimal/no service. They won't flatter, and they seem ok with you eating here or going someplace else. They need to make food, and that they do well. Some dishes are great, like the pork chops and the fried rice, some need improvements like their beef noodles. If you are ok with no service but want to try Asian food which isn't too American, try this special place.Can get busy sometime, so Be prepared to possibly wait.",3.0
"Snagged some take out here for a picnic date and let's say I'm a fan!The satay beef sandwich was so light and moist, extra pointers for cutting the crust off! The milk tea tastes as good as the ones in Hong Kong! The place is a bit rowdy when you come in, they seem to cater to tweens, teenagers and families. I wish they have a waiting area for people waiting on take out orders. Lighting could also be improved, it felt a little dark inside. Oh and I believe its cash only.",4.0
"I had a feeling I'd end up liking this place. I read some yelp reviews because I had to eat lunch but I had no idea what I was in the mood for. I was tired of all the food around my neighborhood. I was searching yelp for a brunch spot and this place came to my attention. I had weird thoughts about it, I thought it was just going to be some regular Chinese bakery. Boy, was I wrong. This place was more like a cafe/restaurant than a traditional Chinese bakery. Although they do sell bread, I didn't see anyone buying it. You walk in and sit yourself because it gets crowded and everyone wants a good seat. You have to order your food at the counter and they will bring the food to the table for you. You enjoy your deliciously cheap meal and just leave. No need to clean up afterwards and no need to tip. They do have a some legitimate milk tea though. It tastes like Hong Kong style milk tea so expect it to taste more on the bitter, not so sweet side. I will be back to have some Cold Lemon Tea, Cold Ribena with lemon and Hot Almond Milk. I recommend the Red Bean Milk Tea if you like red beans. I ordered the Portuguese Chicken and it tasted better than the typical ones I have. My boyfriend had the Salt and Pepper porkchop over egg fried rice. He really enjoyed it. They both came with a house choice of soup. You can't really go to a cha can ting and not try their pineapple bun with butter! They have some breakfast set menu choices at such affordable prices that you just can't pass up. Everything on the menu is at a reasonable price and the food tastes better than the price. This family owned business definitely made it to one of my favorite place to get some hong kong styled food. I will definitely be back to this place for breakfast, lunch and dinner.",5.0
Looks like a bakery but with a very limited bun selection. U order at the counter and someone bring it to u when its ready. U leave the dishes when you're done and someone will pick it up. Don't expect good service. It's like they have a competition to see how little of an interaction they can have with the customers. But this place is more of a give me the food and leave me alone kinda place. The HK style food is pretty good for the price. I had the baked pork chop over fried rice. Love the fried rice. Love the pork chops. Just wished the sauce was a bit thicker or cheesier. They have the black current with lemon drink. It's one of my favorite. Fellow customers were having the beef chow fun and someone was having the pepper fried pork chop over rice. Both look so good. Can't wait to go back and try more of their stuff.,4.0
"I've only been here for breakfast and I can tell you that this place is great for breakfast at cheap prices. I had their breakfast set E that comes with pork w/ salted vegetable mei fun and it comes with sausage & egg, plus a hot drink for ($4.50). I had their Hong Kong style milk tea with is an extra ($0.50) and I highly recommend this drink to go with the breakfast sets. The taste of the Hong Kong milk tea is strong and one of the best I've had in NYC. The place actually has a lot of seating to eat in and tip is not required. I usually come on weekends and this place is always packed. So be prepared to wait, but not for long.",4.0
Tried their chicken wings after a year later. The wings got shrank and doesn't taste as good anymore. Singapore mei fun was good but less shrimp (2-3 tiny pieces) and no squid at all this time. Baked Portuguese chicken over spaghetti  was okay but come be better in baking time. My girlfriend had the red bean HK tea and it was water down and no ice. The counter person was nice to make another drink for her. Customer service was good. My lemonade HK tea was good but a bit of a bitter taste from the lemon. I loved their breakfast menu. Good portion for single person for decent price. Will definitely recommend breakfast menu.,3.0
"It's really one of the tastiest places to eat around the area. From rice to drinks to noodles to buns, Fay Wong is top notch with the flavors. Prices are reasonable and people are accommodating. Love the fact that you can stroll in and stroll out stuffed for $10 within an hour. Stop by and you'll know why this eatery is always packed!My favorite would be their curry anything. Closely followed by their baked rice dishes. As for drinks, my go-to is their coffee+tea+red bean!",5.0
"A friend recommended to come meet here for breakfast, said this place has 4 stars and that it is authentic HK style cafe/bakery.  I trusted her, so I gave it shot.When i first walked in, the ambien was a typical Chinese bakery looking place, booths were made by pieces of wood, it's all good if food is good.We ordered noodles with beef, noodles with seafood, FW coffee, milk tea.  I always order the wonton noodles soup, this is how i know for sure if a Cantonese restaurant is good or not.We waited for over 35 minutes for these simple dishes!  And the tables around us were complaining about not getting the food as well and when one did, the other friend waited another good 10 minutes.Anyways, when our food did came, i took a bite of my noodle, waaaaayy over cooked and mushy, the wonton also was wayyyyyyyyy over cooked!!!!  I stopped right there, very disappointed, all that wait for this?!  I tried my friends' noodles as well, no bueno.....qualify of the beef, nope, the other seafood noodle......not only did it not look appetizing and also no taste.  Coffee/milk tea, very average for $3...I would not recommend this place to anyone and i'm very curious for the stars it got.  Or maybe i went in on a day the regular cook off?  I can't imagine who was cooking in the kitchen.  smh.I would've been better off with a slice off pizza across the street.",1.0

"Okay, Fay Wong Cafe deserves a review update now that I've actually sat down there for dinner instead of just getting takeout. First of all, the way things work here is a bit different from traditional restaurants. If you're familiar with Chinatown bakeries that also serve meals, then that's a good start. If not, then here's what you need to know: you seat yourself, look at the menu underneath the table glass, then walk up to the register and place your order. They'll bring it to you.Anyway, the menu here is extensive, with breakfast sets (a very Hong Kong thing), omelettes, noodles, rice dishes, sandwiches, and more.The noodles aren't as oily as other places, but still more than I'd like. Beef spaghetti (it ain't lo mein!) is actually a very solid choice. They don't have flat noodles though (or at least it wasn't on the menu).I've also had the Portuguese chicken over rice (they don't offer it baked, but I didn't want to wait anyway). It was pretty good, though once my parents told me to be wary of the rice since it's not the best quality, I couldn't help but notice. Still delicious though, and probably in my top 3 Chinese restaurant Portuguese chicken dishes in Brooklyn.Soup comes with any entree, and you can ask for hot water if you want.I don't live close to here, but it really feels like a solid neighborhood spot.

"Relatively new to this location, but not to doing business, Fay Wong attracted a local clientele at their former New Utrecht location.  I never bothered trying it then.  Well, it pays to check out places that relatives and friends talk about because its pretty good at what it does.Fay Wong is a type of restaurant called ""cha chaan tang,"" popular in Hong Kong and parts of Canton.  True to form, it is casual and cafe-like, doing a brisk take-out business.  Its a small venue; roughly 8 tables seating 4 - 6 each, and fills up rapidly as locals bring whole families along.  The funky wooden booths seem like a carpentry afterthought, but comfort is not why one goes to a cha chaan tang.  No classic waiter service, its do-it-yourself at the counter.  If eating in, grab a menu first then take a seat; place orders at the counter and help yourself to napkins, utensils, bowls, and communal condiments located there.  The food is delivered to the table in cafeteria-style trays.  Once done, head back to the counter to pay up.  Staff takes care of table clean-up, and tipping is not expected.There's a wide-ranging menu of noodles (in soup or fried) and rice (fried or topped with various meat/veggies) and Western-inspired items like sandwiches, toast, spaghetti.  There's a selection of baked Chinese breads brought over from a local bakery, notably a few varieties of pineapple bun.  Well-priced and reasonably sized breakfast sets are served until 11 AM, offering 2 - 3 separate food items plus a hot drink for $4.25 (e.g. two eggs + ham macaroni soup + toast with butter or jam).  Their classic bakery drinks menu has the usual variations of tea, coffee, and lemon drinks served hot or cold, but also has red bean as an optional add-on, not so commonly seen among other Chinese bakeries and cafes in the area.Fay Wong does an excellent HK milk tea (listed as ""FW Tea w/Milk""), a version of milk tea that uses a far more potent tea prep.  Their red beans to be added to beverages are also prepared well.  Wontons are housemade and generous with quantity and variety of filling.  Their classic wonton noodles are terrible though, and best avoided; substitute one of their many other noodle choices instead.  The chicken steak is tender and delicious, great prepared with black pepper (but avoid if you don't love pepper) or sliced and served atop soup noodles; I find it superior to their pork chop.  Fried chicken wings are good.  Baked spaghetti dishes are mostly very good.  Him and Her Cafe does better versions of some dishes, like curry chicken and pineapple buns with butter; but in general, both of these restaurants are very good with minor differences in certain dishes.  The breakfast sets are all excellent choices.The staff remain consistent; I understand its a family operation.  I like the staff, who offer efficient and straightforward service.  The kitchen is fast enough, but for take-out orders, phoning in ahead of time is definitely recommended (don't bother with the listed email).  Note there are restrictions to what can be ordered at different times.  Prior to 11 AM, only the breakfast sets are available, and between 5 - 6 PM, only sandwiches and drinks are available.My family and I have become regulars here, frequenting for breakfast and dinner, as well as take-out, and expect to remain regulars.  Relative to similar food options in the Bensonhurst and Dyker Heights, Fay Wong is a stand-out in quality.  Realistically, this isn't the sort of food I'd be dying to introduce non-Chinese folks to, but if you're familiar with it, its comfort food and its done well, at reasonable portions and prices.",4.0

Yes, it is possible, with their infamous macaroni breakfast set, (stay away from me if you order oatmeal sets instead, we are not friends.)followed by the rice plate of your choice lunch andd dinner. (Try all of them) When i hang out with 3 different groups in a day, and they all demanded to dine here, that tells you a lot about this place. HK style food in American portion, Muuurriicaa.",5.0
"If you like Hong Kong Style food, then you're in the right place. Here they served the scrumptious Satay Beef Noodle in the choice of rice noodle or instant noodle, etc. Their pork chop cutlet or chicken steak cutlet are great as well with the meat soft inside and the deep fried batter made fresh, crunchy and yet not greasy. The HK style tea with milk is rich and silky preferably hot. Unfortunately there is no photo available due to too busy eating the yummy food...highly recommend this ordinary eatery and definitely will come back again and again! ;P",5.0
"Really good breakfast menu. Definitely one of the better ""HK"" cafes in south Brooklyn.",4.0
Not bad.  A little on the slow side.  I ordered  take out.,4.0
"I always get my favorite salt & pepper pork chops over rice. Man they always make it just right and with plentiful jalapeño peppers on top. This is definitely one of my favorite Hong Kong style restaurant here in Brooklyn. Huge portions for it's prices. You can also grab your favorite HK style drinks here. I always go for iced ribena with lemon. FYI, seats are here a first come first serve bases.  You order first, then grab your seats.",5.0
"Nice! Been missing their food since they moved out of their old location, glad they are back and opened on a more convenient location on 18th Ave, with real tables to sit for dine-in. The food taste exactly the same as before, one of our favorite authentic HK style.2 reason why they don't get 4 starts: uncomfortable chairs/tables and a very long wait time for  the food (takes even longer than before, I guess because of the volume of business now?)",4.0
"My canteen?! Since I come here 3times a week~~I usually get:Pork Chop w/ Salt Pepper on rice!! Breakfast C and breakfast E!!Hong Kong style Milk tea!!Hong Kong style lemon tea!!Beef stew noodle soup!!Western fried rice!!Pan fried noodle w/ soy sauce!! Fried chicken wings!!Baked meat sauce over spaghetti!!Pork chop over spaghetti!!...Etc...Actually, I ate everything they had~All Good and worth the price~;)",5.0
"I've visited this place for breakfast and lunch. The portions are large compared to other places. The place looks simple and reflect classic Hong Kong style cafe. The price on the menu is somewhat higher than other places, but the large portions make up for the higher price.The food is good and tasty. My favorite is the beef with scallion for lunch and the satay beef noodle combo for breakfast which comes with egg and a hot beverage.Overall, this is a great place for breakfast and lunch. They are closed on Monday and a couple of hours in the afternoon each day. I would come back.",4.0

"Fay Wong's food is the best of all the Hong Kong style tea cafe in Brooklyn.  The only reason why it's a 4 star is because sometimes of the service- when it's busy, not only is it slow but servers tend to have a slight attitude. But that's fine, the food itself more than make up for it.",4.0
Actually really good! Just like HK style cafes in hong Kong. The baked spaghetti chicken steak was a huge portion. Really yummy! The ribena lemon tea was nice and refreshing! Def coming back!,4.0
"So glad that it's opened again, I feel so alive that good food is back in my life again! Breakfast price went up, still worth everything no matter what though! Mostly everything is the same, no change; no difference. Perfectly fine. My happiness can't even be expressed right now, seriously! Go milk tea!! Prices depend on what you order. Remember breakfast is served only until 11am; so don't be late!",5.0
"If you were a fan of their food at their previous location, then this new location is the same. Except the new space is larger and feels more like a restaurant with their booths and tables. Now, the booths and tables are arranged in a odd way (at least to me), but it doesn't seem to matter to their regular customers. The menu and quality of the food is the same too, but the portions they're are serving to the customers has grown in size. Majority of the time, I can't finish the plates of food.",4.0
"I've been one of Fay Wong's customers since they opened at their old location and I'm so loving the new location! My family loves to dine at this place because the food they serve is totally worth the price - food with the HK style! However, I believe the prices were cheaper at the old location, but that's okay! As long as they're back, that's all that matters.The lady owner is also really friendly! They never disappoint!",5.0

Good food. You're lucky if you get a seat there. Love the red bean drink.,4.0
First heard about them from cousin and started loving them from their previous location. Now they had reopened closer to where I live and I get to enjoy their food whenever I can. The owner is an awesome person and they work hard to give you great food at an affordable cost. Also their milk tea is a must get since it is better than anywhere else in the Brooklyn area.,5.0
