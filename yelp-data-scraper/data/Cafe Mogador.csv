"All around an excellent meal.  We stopped by based on the yelp reviews for a late dinner after watching the Moth show at the nearby Brooklyn hall of music.For appetizer we got the grilled hallumi cheese, which was tasty and hard to believe that it's cheed.For main course my wife got the Yogurt marinated Chicken tandoori, which was outstanding.  Really flavorful and chicken was cooked to perfection.I got the Chicken tagine with charmulla sauce.  The charmulla sauce was fantastic.  The chicken was really good as well, but a hair overcooked.  Dessert was a little disappointing, as it took about 15 minutes to come out, and it was just a scoop of ice cream.  It was pretty delicious, but wasn't anything that was terribly labor intensive, so surprised at how long it tookOverall a great meal and I highly recommend",5.0
I always recommend Mogador to anyone who asks for a good breakfast in the neighborhood. Perfect post-hangover spicy food to wake you up. Also a very comfortable and refreshing atmosphere.Just don't order coffee or espresso there.,4.0
+++- Loved hummus platter. All that bread can be very filling tho++- Environment is very hip and cool- I enjoyed the lamb tangine with casablanca  lamb tangine better than chicken tangine+- Servings are pretty big- tangine with charmoulla was alright,4.0
"The one star is for the lamb tangine and the hot cider and the service.. Got there with a friend of mine at around 11:45pm, and the waitress started pressuring us that the kitchen closes @12:30...  Even when my response was that I called in advance to check when the kitchen will be closing... she and the hostess still continued to harass us like every five minutes.... No!  They were not helpful, or patient with helping me choose from the menu...      we finally decided to go for the lamb tangine and couscous, and a hot cider,  The couscous was dry, we had to ask for a broth to pour on top,  the lamb lacked a lot in flavour, and was kinda dry,  for sure had better lamb in my life,  and the cider was one of the worst I have ever had....  (don't know how you can mess up ciders so bad!!!) Ps. I wish I knew why people rave about this place.... (maybe the Manhattan location is better?) The only good thing here is there WiFi.",1.0
"Put our name down just in time before the brunch rush and snagged a table in the atrium. On a freezing, wet April morning, I'm pretty sure this is one of the best places in all of NYC to be. The back atrium/greenhouse is a warm, wannabe botanical garden where you have no choice but to sit comfortably and enjoy bold middle eastern-inspired dishes as you brush against palm fronds and other flora and fauna. Everyone else is happy; it'll rub off on you too. Brunch is ridiculously easy with a convenient combo option for $17 that gives you a glass of fresh OJ, a tasty egg dish (in my case, a Moroccan Benedict) and a much needed espresso. You really can't go wrong here; ask for a table in the back.",5.0
I've passed this place so many times in the east village and I am punching my self for doing so. I tried the one in Williamsburg for the first time and it was excellent. The steak was huge and so fucking good with fries which were perfectly crispy and seasoned. I won't pass by the east village again without trying it. PRO TIP:STEAKKKK!,5.0
"We went for a brunch on a Saturday and were very lucky to have a table right away for 5 ppl because the place seems to be always packed. The meals were very good. The decor is cute and cosy, and the staff was nice.The hummus and the pita were fantastic!",4.0
"I have found my favorite brunch spot thanks to my besty. I love moroccan food but this took my breath away every bite was magical.The wait is worth it people this place is a must service is excellent. I had the Moroccan Breakfast but I've tried the Mediterranean Breakfast , couscous & baguette w jelly & butter as well as mimosa w/ is a bit small but is delicious also I had the most amazing hot chocolate. Zero complaints all flavorful and filling. Id to eat here every week but the gym wouldn't be happy haha.",5.0
"One of the best dinners I've had in New York! This place really has everything working for it - the casual yet trendy vibe, diverse menu offerings leaning towards Moroccan/middle-eastern cuisine, and friendly wait staff. The food is super fresh and elegantly prepared and it's all relatively reasonably-priced!I highly recommend getting the Lamb tagine - literally fall-off-the-bone delicate. Super flavorful! And served with fresh couscous - and your choice of sauce - doesn't get much better than that. Additionally, the halumi cheese was a really great appetizer to start with!I wish we were seated in the greenhouse towards the back, but we still enjoyed our spot amid the hustle and bustle of the restaurant. Will ABSOLUTELY be returning, I cannot stress that enough! HIGHLY recommend!",5.0
"Came here for some appetizers and drinks before going out and it was SO GOOD. The humus was some of the best I've ever had and the bread that came with it was perfect. We also had a chicken skewer type dish that was delicious - simple and succulent and very well done. I will definitely be back for a full meal, soon.",5.0
"My friend Peter and I came here for lunch today. It was busy; we were told it would be at least 20 min. They seated us after five. The music is nice. The interiors were nicer. Try sitting in the large enclosed patio seating area in the rear of the restaurant. Peter ordered the hummus to start. Delicious hummus, but be warned. They only give you one small pita with this. A little scant in my opinion.He followed up the hummus with the Chicken Grill. This dish smelled exceptional. The two chicken skewers were politely tucked into a bed of basmati rice. This smelled nice. The side salad also smelled nice. I say smell because I didn't try Peter's meal. Didn't want to lie to you. You know? I chose the Middle Eastern Eggs. Poached. This may not be the best time to bring this up, but you should ALWAYS ask for poached eggs regardless of where you're eating. Remember this. The more eggs we poach, the less animals are poached in Africa. There's a direct correlation...or something. Mogador saves wildlife. I digress. The eggs were poached well. The salad, tabouli, and zahatar pita/hummus, all of which accompany the eggs: yummo. Great, fresh food served quickly and kindly.Enjoy good company (hopefully).Save wildlife.Eat Mogador.",4.0
"My colleague has been recommending this place for months now.  I finally got the chance to try it and now I see why she was so enthusiastic!The design itself is beautiful.  It has the Moroccan style- it just feels mysterious yet inviting.  On a Saturday evening, we only had to wait about 40 minutes.  We ordered the Hummus and Falafel to start- both excellent!  I loved the little spicy paste it comes with.  We decided to split the Lamb Tagine and the Mixed Kebab.  Both dishes were prepared perfectly.  All the meats were so juicy and tender... Especially that Lamb Tagine... I *highly* recommend this particular menu item.",5.0
"Good food, though not exceptional. Lamb was better than the chicken tangine, I thought.  Cous cous is ok.  Eggplant appetizer is good - tastes like any eggplant ever with chickpea or hummus sauce.  Warm pita is served alongside.Very nice looking restaurant.  Good service.  Fail to see why this place averages 9.6 on Foursquare or 4.5 stars on Yelp.

"It's rare to come across a restaurant that I would actually consider a five-star experience, but let's add this place to my personal list.I met up with a friend here at 11:45am for your standard Saturday brunch. I told her if she got there early to request a table with an abundance of natural light (because I like to take photos and incandescent yellow light is horrendous). The hostess was incredibly helpful, giving us two options and letting us know with repeated updates when our table would be ready.The vibe is lively. I can't place the decor, it's friendly meets homey meets antiquey in the front meets Hell's Kitchen Hotel Lounge in the back. The oversized large fronds from the Bird of Paradise plant (at least I think that's what it is) doesn't help. I order Moroccan Benedict pre-fixe with the orange juice and cappuccino. My friend orders the   Middle Eastern Eggs. The dishes come out and it's a hefty portion size, you're not going to leave hungry. They also come out pretty promptly, thank gaaaawd. My friend regales me for about 40 minutes with her friend drama and we never felt rushed out the door even though the wait to get in was clearly getting longer as the doorway and front of the restaurant were slowly filling with people. This is also why I recommend brunching before noon. That way you're not waiting 90 minutes because there are tables like mine that spend their time leisurely eating their food while going into lengthy detail to color context on drama.The potato homefries were surprisingly my favorite part of my dish... and my friend's zahatar pita with hummus I couldn't get enough of.

I highly recommend the traditional, which is a little sweet featuring Sultanas and such, but is authentic and delicious. The other options seem to me modern ""inventions"" to try and please the Americans, and that never floats my boat. I may try the Cilantro sauce at some point (I think that was one of the options).

"I haven't found many good Moroccan restaurants in NYC, so I was really excited about how good this spot was. It looks small from the outside, but it's a pretty large restaurant with a big back area that is like an enclosed garden. I recommend trying to sit back there if you can.Many people below said that the portions are huge, but I thought they were just right. Each person can have one entree to himself. I recommend the grill chicken most highly - the chicken is perfectly grilled and mixes really well with the vegetables (especially grilled onion) and rice they give you, plus you get a small salad on the side. I would also recommend the chicken cous cous, which is basically a couple chicken legs with cous cous and several large pieces of vegetables (potato, sweet potato, zucchini, etc.) All of the vegetables were so delicious and fresh tasting. Finally, I would recommend the mango martini, which tastes just like you're eating mango sorbet.This place does not take reservations for small parties, but we were able to get a table for 2 around 7:30/8 on a Tuesday immediately. Service was very quick too, even though the place was packed.",5.0
"Maybe I came on an off night - not sure. The food (with the exception of the dessert dish we've tried) was great but the service was extremely disappointing.

From the moment, the hostess was seating us to the moment we had a dessert (which was overly sweet, and after sharing one bite, we shared our disapproval and was offered the fact that she wasnt going to take it off the bill anyhow), service here was disappointing. Service is what ruined the thought of my return.",3.0

Another thing most people do not know - they're actually open for breakfast at 9 AM!",5.0
This place is absolute heaven.Came here on a Thursday night for a friend's bday and was sat on the indoor patio? Really cute. Great ambiance.I ordered the Chicken Tagine. I believe it was Casablanca-style. Every morsel of every bite was otherworldly. The chicken was the perfect melding of tender and juicy and the spices were perfection. Honestly one of the best meals I've had so far in NYC.My ONLY complaint would be that there was NO music of any kind in the restaurant which I thought was a bit odd. It would've helped the setting to at least have light mood music playing while dining with the gods.,5.0

They also have outdoor seating in the front although it's tight, I think they have room for just one table. The food is as good as the one in East Village. I order the salad nicoise which came with grilled salmon (ordered it rare!) and it was aaaaamazing. The babaganoush is superb and comes with warm pita bread. The soup of the day was a total finding: butternut squash and turnip. Wow! Delicious. Good prices and menu options. Definitely a top 5 option in Williamsburg. The Burger which my brother had was great too. Lamb and veal combined in a kick ass patty with caramelized onions! Recommended!",5.0
What. A. Find. Amazing ambience and food on *point.* I got the chicken grill and my husband got the halumi cheese poached egg breakfast. Both of us left wishing we could eat every meal here the next week.,5.0
"This was my very first time here. It was AMAZING! The waitress that served our table was so friendly and helpful. I wish i knew her name, she had long dark hair and wore circular glasses. My sister, co worker and I didn't know much about Moroccan food, and she helped us recommend all the dishes we got and explained which food was which. We went there on a Wednesday evening around 5pm and got seated immediately. Every dish we ordered was super delicious! I would recommend you to get cous cous, that was my favorite. The food there were made really fresh and right out of the oven. When we got inside, one of the employees asks us if we have a preference seat we would want to sit at, I really liked that she asked us that. We sat in the back which was an indoor patio, and looked really neat. Overall, I really recommend this place. I will definitely be coming back here!",5.0
"Fantastic find, thank you Yelp users! Came here on a whim out in a Beautiful Day.Being Sunday, I did expect to wait. Yet when I asked for 1 at the bar, the hostess and manager said a couple is leaving shortly and I can wait by the bar. Let just say, this place was packed and there was a 40 minutes wait. I was seated within 5 minutes at the bar.Ordered a Hummus appetizer ($5.75), then Sunday Brunch - Eggs Normandy (2 poached eggs on top of Smoked Salmon and English Muffin with Hollandaise Sauce, home fries & mesclun salad) with orange juice and cappuccino ($16.50).Hummus, perfect appetizer with a little olive oil in middle along side of pita bread. The pita bread was fluffy, firm, and warm. Well worth it!Eggs Normandy was absolutely sublime. Perfectly cooked poached eggs (soft, not running yolks) with fine tasting Hollandaise Sauce. The home fries was cooked to the perfection and not overdone. Mesclun salad was a nice compliment to the dish.Overall, i experienced excellent service throughout and no long wait whatsoever. I would come back in a heartbeat! Great vibes and atmosphere!",5.0
"I love this place. Can always count on the food to be excellent....you can really taste the love. No wonder there's always a wait. There's something special about the combo of meat and caramelized fruit/veggies that Mogador executes so well on. What we ate: 1. Special app of the day: it came with a variety of dips and light and fluffy and buttery flatbread. Excellent. 2. Blackened chicken.3. Some kebob with couscous. Sorry, we ate this a few months ago so I can't remember details.",5.0
"I haven't found many good Moroccan restaurants in NYC, so I was really excited about how good this spot was. It looks small from the outside, but it's a pretty large restaurant with a big back area that is like an enclosed garden. I recommend trying to sit back there if you can.Many people below said that the portions are huge, but I thought they were just right. Each person can have one entree to himself. I recommend the grill chicken most highly - the chicken is perfectly grilled and mixes really well with the vegetables (especially grilled onion) and rice they give you, plus you get a small salad on the side. I would also recommend the chicken cous cous, which is basically a couple chicken legs with cous cous and several large pieces of vegetables (potato, sweet potato, zucchini, etc.) All of the vegetables were so delicious and fresh tasting. Finally, I would recommend the mango martini, which tastes just like you're eating mango sorbet.This place does not take reservations for small parties, but we were able to get a table for 2 around 7:30/8 on a Tuesday immediately. Service was very quick too, even though the place was packed.",5.0
"Maybe I came on an off night - not sure. The food (with the exception of the dessert dish we've tried) was great but the service was extremely disappointing. My date was excited to be there and so was I , after hearing all the great things I was hearing from him. From the moment, the hostess was seating us to the moment we had a dessert (which was overly sweet, and after sharing one bite, we shared our disapproval and was offered the fact that she wasnt going to take it off the bill anyhow), service here was disappointing. Service is what ruined the thought of my return.",3.0
"Literally our favorite neighborhood restaurant. Food is always fabulous, delightful ambience especially in the greenhouse at the back, and very pleasant service staff. You can never go wrong here - I recommend the Bastilla, any soups, all the appetizers, Haloumi, salmon- but as I said, all are delicious! Another thing most people do not know - they're actually open for breakfast at 9 AM!",5.0
This place is absolute heaven.Came here on a Thursday night for a friend's bday and was sat on the indoor patio? Really cute. Great ambiance.I ordered the Chicken Tagine. I believe it was Casablanca-style. Every morsel of every bite was otherworldly. The chicken was the perfect melding of tender and juicy and the spices were perfection. Honestly one of the best meals I've had so far in NYC.My ONLY complaint would be that there was NO music of any kind in the restaurant which I thought was a bit odd. It would've helped the setting to at least have light mood music playing while dining with the gods.,5.0

"Cafe Mogador has a certain ambiance that makes you feel at home. The entire place is set-up in a sort of recreated indoor garden.  Strategic seating and nice simple places to get comfy while waiting for a table.The service was right there, slightly understated and never intrusive.Cafe Mogador specializes in Moroccan cuisine and two things were absolutely standout, the pita and the hummus.  I had the Bastilla for my entree. It was filo stuffed with chicken, eggs and almonds with Moroccan spices and side salad. Overall it was a lovely evening.  My one concern is that reservations are not accepted here.  It is quite difficult to dine at a restaurant with a group of people without a reservation.",4.0

"Came here with some friends cause a neighboring restaurant had a 3 hour wait.  I was really satisfied with the overall service and food last time I was at Cafe Mogador, but this time around, I have to say, was a more than upsetting experience.My friend was initially told that the wait would 20 minutes for a 3 person table.  We waited and waited, talked and talked, and waited some more.  We checked with the host several times but was told the same thing over and over again--that there were a couple of tables done with their food and that they were waiting for them to open up.  I talked with the host and the host couldn't give me an updated estimated wait time.  She just said that customers were drinking wine and she couldn't ""control"" that.  That's fine, but at least don't give your customers such an inaccurate estimated wait time.  The wait slowly but surely became 1 HOUR AND 15 MINUTE wait.  Anyway, we finally got seated and ordered.  The hot chocolate was quite creamy and dark, which was nice.  However, you could tell that it wasn't mixed properly since there was a large amount of cocoa powder residue towards the bottom. The mixed platter came with an assortment of hummus, grilled eggplants, and two salads.  Overall, each one was flavorful and paired well with the bread.  The eggplant was cold and didn't taste like it was freshly made though.  For the entree, I got the Morrocan Fish Tagine.  The vegetables were all soft and tender.  The fish was a tad dry and overcooked.  The sauce was nicely spiced with a little heat and sweetness, which made the dish satisfying for the most part.  I also tried my friend's order of Chicken Tagine.  The bite I had was tender but she mentioned that some parts were tender, and some were dry.  It seemed to lack flavor as well.  And the kebabs from my friend's Grilled Mixed Platter was extremely dry and flavorless as well.",1.0
"This place has the best pita bread in the world!!! It literally is soooo soft and warm. The hummus was great! Service was very friendly!I ordered the chicken bastille- It was very interesting! I dont know if i would get it again, but definitely worth trying. The kebabs and salads looked good.They dont take reservations and they do get busy so i suggest coming on the earlier side to beat the crowd especially if you are with a larger group.",4.0
"After dancing and drinking while afternoon on the roof, me and my friend desperately need FOOD! Friend wanted steak. So We made our way to Mogador and snatched two seats at the bar right away. This location is much bigger and prettier than the E.V. Location.We ordered the hummus to start. So good! You can tell that was made fresh in house. The oven toasts pita severed along was soft and warm, yum!I got the lamb tagine for entree. Boy it was bigger than my head! What a deal for 20 bucks! I opted for the chermoula sauce - made of mixed herbs, lemon juice, chili pepper, cumin and cilantro. it was super juicy and packed of flavor. Take note if you don't have a decent size stomach like me. I came in hungry and had not been eaten the whole day. Yet I could only finished off 1/3 and packed the rest home. One app to share, one entree and one glass of wine each. The bill comes out 40 bucks each including tips. Great price and fabulous food. Def come back for more!",4.0
"If you believe that brunch isn't always about the boozy, then this place is the spot for you.  This classic Mediterranean and Moroccan restaurant offers some of the best brunch in the city, and you don't the alcohol to enhance your taste buds.  Mediterranean classic appetizers such as Tabouli, Babaganoush, and roasted eggplant with tahini are all fresh and flavorful.  Brunch entrees such as the Moroccan Benedict and the Eggs Normandy and Florentine are all light, yet extremely satisfying.  The best item on the menu has to be the Haloumi Eggs, with blocks of Haloumi cheese and roasted tomato over two delicate poached eggs, you would believe you were at 'The House' in Istanbul, and not Williamsburg, Brooklyn.I'd say Cafe Mogador is a measure that you don't have to unbuckle your belt or get slapstick drunk to have an awesome brunch.",4.0
"This may be the best breakfast I've ever had. I'm an avid user of Yelp, but this is my first review, because their food makes me want to cry - it is literally incredible. The first time I came here, I ordered their eggs halumi (which was very reasonably priced at $12), along with an apple cider with brandy, and in a subsequent visit, the Blackstone eggs. The flavors for both the dishes were creative and complemented each other perfectly. The eggs in both the Blackstone and halumi eggs were PERFECTLY poached - the yolk was thick and delicious. I didn't even know chickens laid eggs that tasted like that. The roasted tomato slice was juicy, but somehow the tomato retained its moisture, flavor and texture. The halumi cheese was cut in a block, but had the most incredible flavor. All in all, the two dishes were so good, that my mouth is currently watering just thinking about it.",5.0

"My first time trying morrocan food, it's pretty busy here for brunch on Sundays, but that's always a good sign. I came with a party of 4 and we were seated after 30 minutes. They have a good selection of breakfast and brunch options. Some seemed traditional morrocan while some seemed more American and some were morrocan American. I ended up getting 3 appetizers to share with my boyfriend. We shared a babaganoush, falafel and matbucha. The meal was light, it was like having morrocan tapas for brunch. It came with two sauces, tahini sauce and a spicy sauce as well as pita bread to go with the appetizers.My favorite of the three was the falafel and matbucha. The matbucha was like a nice tomato spread. The falafel was really rich, you can tell it was made from scratch. The inside was so green, like guacamole green. The babaganoush was good, but not as much flavor as the other dishes. The pita bread was quite soft and thick, it went nicely with the appetizers. I liked the tahini sauce over the spicy one. The tahini sauce went really well with the falafel. The food here seems more similar to Turkish food in my opinion, but worth checking out. A bit pricier for what you normally would get from a street cart but the quality is higher.",4.0

It was so tasty with the hummus.  The arabic salad was a big salty for my taste but what do I know about mediterranean food? It meshed well with the hummus and pita though.  The tabouli was great and the dressings for both tasted good.  The homefries I got were excellently seasoned as well.The service:This...is where they lose a star.  They seemed to have forgotten our table and didn't really refill our cups until after we paid for our meal (the cups are small and don't have ice in them).  They're all very nice and prompt when they come but....maybe they're understaffed and need the benefit of the doubt.  Well either way, it's a gem!

It meshed well with the hummus and pita though.  The tabouli was great and the dressings for both tasted good.  The homefries I got were excellently seasoned as well.The service:This...is where they lose a star.  They seemed to have forgotten our table and didn't really refill our cups until after we paid for our meal (the cups are small and don't have ice in them).  They're all very nice and prompt when they come but....maybe they're understaffed and need the benefit of the doubt.  Well either way, it's a gem! Great location to just relax and talk.  It's not too hot since there is plenty of AC.  Overall: Would come back!",4.0
"Had a great brunch, the food was very tasty, the service was great. But the best thing was the coffee, the best I had in Williamsburg. Order a chicken tagine in preserved lemon and olive sauce which was excellent, the salad on the side was tasty and had 4 slices of beet and lotsa greens... Very good.Also ordered the halumi breakfast with poached eggs, very tasty but the eggs were over cooked (so 4 starts).",4.0
Service always disappoints at this now touristy over rated place. The wine arrived when the first coarse was done and we had to ask for share plates 3 times. There was nothing left to share by the time they came. The main coarse arrived while our table was still covered with the first coarse. The spicy garnish was good but I needed a refill of water to assuage the heat. This situation is the norm at Mogodor but the food is decent so we periodically return hoping to catch a good night. The server was friendly and understanding but it was after the fact.,3.0

The pita bread is soft and fluffy.I will make sure to be back - but well before the trendy brunch goers wake up and mob the place.,5.0

Hands down FAVORITE BRUNCH in all of New York. Authentic Mediterranean food with a beautiful inclosed back garden. Get the Moroccan tea and order a ton of side dishes. This place rules and the wait has never been too long on weekends.,5.0
"my brunch was soooo good! ordered the eggs with halumi on tomato... came with delicious salad (perfectly dressed) and fluffy zaatar bread. a nice change from the typical brunch spots AND a perfect compromise for someone who is torn between ordering breakfast or lunch (they have the mid eastern bfast with eggs, hummus, tabouli, and zaatar). used to go to their east village location a ton when i lived/worked/existed in NYC, but forgot how much i enjoyed this gem. glad it's back on the radarps the space is beautiful, tranquil.. lots of plants and sunlight",5.0

"Grabbed dinner here on a Saturday evening. The wait for a table was long, about an hour, so we are around 9:30pm. Luckily the drinks at the bar were good and easily accessible.Food was solid and had a lot of variety. Hummus is a much recommended appetizer along with olives/peppers. Most of our group had a variety of tangine, and it was universally thought of as fresh and filling.",4.0
"Came here on a group dinner with some college friends.For my entree, I got the Duck Confit, which came with arugula salad and french fries. The Duck Confit was really nothing special in my opinion - a little too dry in my opinion, since this was literally just paired with arugula salad and a minuscule amount of dressing, but I did enjoy the french fries.Also, I wanted to note that our waitress had a VERY subtle attitude problem. You could barely notice it, but there was certainly a hint of condescension in her tone when we refused to get a second round of drinks. Turns out, I wasn't the only one who noticed towards the end of the night.For the six of us, our bill came out to $240, including gratuity. Although I am sad to have paid $40 for essentially a drink and a duck leg, I think this place seems to be good for brunch (according to fellow Yelpers), so maybe I'll give this place a second chance.",3.0

"Been here for breakfast and now dinner. My goodness, it's just an amazing place.From the friendly staff to the ambiance of the restaurant to the most delicious food, it's perfection at its finest.For breakfast I had some halumi poached eggs. Mmm so good; the eggs were poached perfectly and the halumi was just insane. Then we got the bacon and some hummus on the side. That hummus had me like I was somewhere in the Mediterranean but it was better. Because it's always available in Brooklyn because I found it. You hear me hummus, I found you! And now you're mine!Sorry about that rant, I'm a man who enjoys my hummus. Ok so that was just my breakfast, ready for my dinner review? Doesn't really matter if it's a yes or no because I'm about to keep going.Ok, so lamb tagine with Casablanca sauce. Then we had the hummus mixed platter as well as the calamari. But wait, we also tried the chocolate lava cake.I'll do my best as I'm still in a foodcoma but here we go:-lamb tagine was cooked perfectly, tender meat falling off bone and in a Casablanca sauce with chickpeas and a side dish of cous cous.-mixed platter; hummus, Arabic salad, tabouli salad, and roasted eggplant with tahini. Eggplant and hummus was a huge hit! I enjoyed the salads too but the other two were the stars.-calamari was sautéed in a beautiful sauce and was such a nice change to the usual way calamari comes-last but not least, the lava cake was baked perfectly, balanced with the vanilla ice cream and raspberry sauceThis place is truly special. The prices are reasonable and the food is just cooked perfectly and the dishes are so well thought-out. And the staff is also a delight to interact with. Definitely will be back.",5.0

"The brunch here is absolutely amazing and unique treat for anyone looking for something a little different.I decided to go with the Blackstone Eggs Bennedict (bacon + roasted tomato) which for a prix fixe of $16.50 comes with espresso, orange juice, or tea. Since they don't serve drip coffee, I basically had an Americano and asked them to add some Bailey's to make an Irish Coffee (and they didn't even charge extra!). I also got the fresh squeeze orange juice which is some of the best I have ever had. The Blackstone Eggs Bennedict was extremely delicious - the eggs were cooked to perfection over bacon and the sundried roasted tomato which had so much flavor on a buttery-crisp english muffin. The breakfast potatoes as a side were awesome cooked with fresh herbs and spices for a unique and flavorful taste. Service and atmosphere were great - only problem with the experience was getting seated by the hostess who for whatever reason kept seating people that were below us on the list when we had put our name in first (it was just me and another friend so, not a large party).",5.0

This place is truly amazing. There are places that have great food and then there's Cafe Mogador which is a whole new level. It screams authenticity which is what I love about it the most. The herbs and spices and techniques used to prepare their menu are exquisite. The lamb tangine with cilantro sauce is my favorite. The lamb is so tender and slips right off the bone. The basmati rice is cardamom scented and wish I could have asked for the entire pot! Love this place and can't help always going back for more.

"Recently had an early dinner here with some friends and I think it's safe to say that we all enjoyed our meal immensely. Their hummus, pita, and tabouli are beyond amazing! The pita seemed really fresh and we would have totally asked for more if our mains didn't arrive so promptly. We ordered the mixed grill with chicken, lamb, and lamb sausage (get this), chicken and lamb tagine (definitely get this) with couscous, soup of the day, and a beet salad. Everything was delicious, it didn't take us long to scrape the plates clean! We also were able to sit in the garden area, which made the experience even better. The set up back there is wonderful and it gets tons of natural lighting. I can imagine it getting pretty crowded during peak hours but I recommend getting garden seating if you can! Although the food and setting deserve five stars, I'm docking a star for service. It wasn't bad but it definitely had room for improvement. The waiters were sufficiently polite (just about) but seemed rather unenthusiastic. Regardless, I can definitely see myself coming back and hope my next visit is even better than the first!",4.0
"Cafe Mogador is the place to escape from the banality of typical brunch foods like eggs benedict and omelettes (though they still have those options for the un-adventurous). I always come here for a unique brunch menu. Their brunch rush is starts around 11am, so come around 10 am to be seated quickly. This place is also one of the few places in Williamsburg that opens before 11! My absolute favorite thing on the menu is the Middle Eastern Breakfast, which comes with eggs, tabouli, salad, hummus, and pita. The tabouli is great here, not too salty, but very crunchy and fresh. The eggs - scrambled for me - are great with that little dish of cumin hot sauce they serve. I love that sauce. I want to put it on everything; it's the kind of flavor I want to wake me up in the morning. For the normal breakfast foods, I think the pancakes are delicious. They actually have real fruit in them! Also, get a side of home fries. They are included in the prix-fixe menu, but are not to be missed with ordering a la carte. Top off your meal with a pot of Moroccan mint tea.",4.0

Everything was delicious, it didn't take us long to scrape the plates clean! We also were able to sit in the garden area, which made the experience even better. The set up back there is wonderful and it gets tons of natural lighting. I can imagine it getting pretty crowded during peak hours but I recommend getting garden seating if you can! Although the food and setting deserve five stars, I'm docking a star for service. It wasn't bad but it definitely had room for improvement. The waiters were sufficiently polite (just about) but seemed rather unenthusiastic. Regardless, I can definitely see myself coming back and hope my next visit is even better than the first!",4.0
"Cafe Mogador is the place to escape from the banality of typical brunch foods like eggs benedict and omelettes (though they still have those options for the un-adventurous). I always come here for a unique brunch menu. Their brunch rush is starts around 11am, so come around 10 am to be seated quickly. This place is also one of the few places in Williamsburg that opens before 11! My absolute favorite thing on the menu is the Middle Eastern Breakfast, which comes with eggs, tabouli, salad, hummus, and pita. The tabouli is great here, not too salty, but very crunchy and fresh. The eggs - scrambled for me - are great with that little dish of cumin hot sauce they serve. I love that sauce. I want to put it on everything; it's the kind of flavor I want to wake me up in the morning. For the normal breakfast foods, I think the pancakes are delicious. They actually have real fruit in them! Also, get a side of home fries. They are included in the prix-fixe menu, but are not to be missed with ordering a la carte. Top off your meal with a pot of Moroccan mint tea.",4.0
"Incompetent hostess.  We came on a Saturday night, and were told it would be 20-30 minutes.  30 minutes later, we were told it would be another 20-30 minutes.  Another 30 minutes later, we were told again it would be another 20-30 minutes.  I looked at the hostess's list and she had already crossed our names off, meaning she had no idea where we were on the list and was just making up times.  We had been waiting right outside the door and had seen her come out several times and call peoples' names virtually at a whisper.   The hostess was all-around incompetent and wasted an hour of our time.  I will not be coming back.",1.0
"Don't get why this place gets 4.5 stars. Arrived here for a late brunch today with 4 friends. The decor was bright, simple, airy... Kinda reminds me of Bluebell Cafe in Gramercy. The service was decent too.The food- not so much. The waitress raved about the burger so one of us got the burger (beef/lamb) and it was... just a typical burger with melted cheese with a side of fries. I got the Lemon Chicken Tagine... Nothing to write home about. It was tender, but not the most tender chicken tagine Ive ever had. The center of the chicken was undercooked and watery. The lemon flavor didnt match well with the chicken. I was expecting a creamier, heavier tagine (what one would expect when ordering a tagine)... A perfect tagine is supposed to have sweet as well as sour notes. My tagine was all sour. My other friends chose the chicken grill (the menu says marinated but it was dry and did not have much flavor) and the eggs benedict (not much to say about this one, either). All in all, just a very mediocre experience and we all left the restaurant highly confused...",3.0
Wow this is a def one the popular burg hang outs for brunch but totally worth the wait. We chose to sit in the garden which is little quiter and lighter with couches available you can sit on whilst waiting for your table.The menu is definitely eggs eggs and more eggs but you know what they you cant beat their eggs here..boom boom.I had the Mediterranean eggs with humus and my friends had them with halumi. ...served with a beautiful fresh salad and pitta .Service food and ambience is great.,4.0

You really can't go wrong here.The food is awesome and a really nice alternative to your regular brunch/dinner spots in this area, and also a bit healthier.I love the middle eastern for brunch or the grilled chicken for dinner.The staff here is super nice and they already know us because we come here so often. We love DeeDee! She's the best! But the other girls are awesome too.Parking can get a bit tight and the wait for a seat can be a bit depending on when you come.

"Pros:* Beautiful ambiance and decor. Great place to have late-night dinner before going to Brooklyn clubs such as Output or Verboten. * Came on a Saturday night at 9:45PM, didn't wait longer than 10 minutes for a table. * My friend and I loved the Greek Salad and Lamb Cous Cous- it was just the perfect amount of food for the 2 of us. My friend thought it was the best Greek salad she's had in NYC and the Lamb Cous Cous was rich in flavor and lamb fell off the bone.* Delicious cocktails- $11, a bit more affordable than Manhattan prices * Service could be faster, we had to flag out waiter down for the check. Looking forward to coming back to try their other dishes!",4.0
We were pleasantly surprised by this quaint little restaurant and it's warm inviting atmosphere and tasty food when we walked in without a Rez on Friday night. They seated us immediately and took our drink order. The food was very good as was the service. We drank the house red and it was good and paired well with the Mediterranean dishes we scarfed down. I hope it's still there when we return to Williamsburg because there were six other dishes I wan to try. I had a veg stew and licked the bowl clean.,4.0

"This place is so much better than the East Village location. Better Ambience, freshly baked naan bread, lot more choices in the menu and the food is simply delicious. For starter, don't miss out their mixed platter. Its my most favorite thing from this place. I like their babaganoush for dip. Their Raita Yogurt and Spiced Carrots are other good options. For Entree I like their fish or chicken tagine with charmoulla sauce. My husband prefers the lamb tagine, which is other good option for meat lovers. Don't forget to try their delicious complementary hot sauce.

"Took my cousin here for a birthday lunch. We got falafel, hummus, lamb tagine with Casablanca sauce (chickpeas and raisins), and a burger. Yeah, I said the same thing to her ordering a burger at a Moroccan place. Anyway, the hummus and falafel were standard. Nothing really exceptional. The lamb tagine was nicely cooked. Perfect tender texture. Sauce was pretty good, a little sweet for me. Probably should've ordered the cilantro sauce. I didn't try the burger, but that sauce with the fries was tasty. Service was alright. It was pretty packed for a weekday lunch in this area. Definitely worth a try if you want something different in the area.",4.0
"Middle Eastern in this city doesn't get much better than Mogador. Their food is unequivocally high quality; everything is well-seasoned, well-cooked, and well worth the fair prices. It's one of the rare restaurants that can fit almost every occasion and nearly every palate (nice and veggie friendly). It works for a hungover brunch, a working lunch meeting, a group dinner or a date. The menu is different enough to keep anyone from being bored, and affordable enough that you shouldn't feel bad about bringing your clown friends that claim they can't afford to eat real meals despite the fact that they buy a $5 coffee every morning and the bag they are carrying is worth more than some cars. As with many a quality culinary destination, however, you and I are not the only people that know about it. Even though this location boasts beaucoup seating, it's always bustling and even at lunchtime on a weekday, there's probably going to be a short wait for a table.

But luckily, when it comes to cafe motagor it worked differently because I asked if we can sit outside and we got seated immediately! It's kinda of a smart but silly move because sitting outside to eat in late October doesn't sound very pleasing. But a cup of cider with brandy will totally warm you up. Highly recommend the tagines, all the meat is so tender. I love this place ! Definitely would love to come back for more.",5.0

Lamb was by far the most tender, fall off the bone lamb that I've ever had. I dumped the entire plate of cous cous into the plate to soak up all the sauce! - Lamb tagine with apricot and prunes - I'm not the type to choose sweet over savory but this had a depth all on its own. It wasn't too sweet at all but had an interesting savoriness that I can't put my finger on and I can't get out of my head. This might be my new favorite. It was definitely a pleasant surprise!- Hummus platter - I always thought hummus was the same hummus every where. How hard could hummus be to make? I don't know what it was, but the hummus here was delicious. It was creamy, smooth and thick. Did not skimp. Large portion.I sat in the garden area, which I'd recommend over the front area since it gets crowded and noisy with all the people waiting to be seated.

Lamb was by far the most tender, fall off the bone lamb that I've ever had. I dumped the entire plate of cous cous into the plate to soak up all the sauce! - Lamb tagine with apricot and prunes - I'm not the type to choose sweet over savory but this had a depth all on its own. It wasn't too sweet at all but had an interesting savoriness that I can't put my finger on and I can't get out of my head. This might be my new favorite. It was definitely a pleasant surprise!- Hummus platter - I always thought hummus was the same hummus every where. How hard could hummus be to make? I don't know what it was, but the hummus here was delicious. It was creamy, smooth and thick. Did not skimp. Large portion.I sat in the garden area, which I'd recommend over the front area since it gets crowded and noisy with all the people waiting to be seated. The garden area is also much more spacious.Can't wait to come back!!",5.0
"Couldn't speak higher of this place! Walked in on a Sunday at that awkward time between lunch and dinner so was fortunate enough to have no wait and even prime seating in the gorgeous greenhouse area out back. What a beautiful and unassuming setting with all the trees and plants around. Perfect for the humid day it was because we still felt like we were outside but with AC! We were kinda drunk and hungry (delayed shout back to my girl Steph C!) but I know this place would have still been as delicious if I was sober. We shared the mixed platter and hummus platter to start, and the lamb tagline and bastilla for mains. The platters were standard but well crafted - definitely whet our appetites for more! I've had a pretty mediocre bastilla before - my mouth just wasn't jiving with the meat and powdered sugar combo - but after trying Café Mogador's, I'm sold. It was the perfect complementary balance of savory and sweet, something my friends will normally tell you I shy away from. The chicken was perfectly spiced and the phyllo dough so light and crispy. Perfect. The lamb tagline with couscous was also delicious - I can't get over how tender and fall-off-the-bone it was, and how flavorful! Definitely coming back here to try it all over again!",5.0

To avoid the wait, I recommend coming later in the evening, after everyone else has left and everything made of slow-cooked has had even more time to cook slowly. You may risk your favorite plates being 86'd using this tactic, but you might also experience peak flavor, and you might be so fortunate to have a chat with yours truly at the bar as well.",5.0
"Hangry. We've all been there. For me, it hit while I was walking around Williamsburg on a super hot day. I had just spent 3 bucks on an awful coffee at a cafe to use their wifi, all to find out the wifi didn't work. Burn. I dropped my wifi search and instead, just needed a really great lunch with a best friend to make me feel better. As if by fate, me and her decided to walk towards each other and happened to meet in the middle at Cafe Mogador. We almost missed the sunroom in the back but once we saw it, immediately asked to sit there there for a meal that turned my whole day around.They have great lunch specials but we both couldn't resist the falafel. It came quick and was really great, especially the tahini on the side that I wiped clean. You have your choice of side - I went for a fresh salad and she got some fries. No complaints there!Add on the friendly service and good price, I was hangry no more!",4.0

Ever since I ate here, I want to go find a Moroccan restaurant here in LA that has tangine because I've been craving it!",5.0
"My favorite Moroccan restaurant in the city!  The space is really really cute and romantic, perfect to bring your date!  It could get crowded even on a week day.  I always get the chicken tagine (lunch menu), comes with a soup or salad, their pumpkin soup is really really good.  I tried both the olive lemon sauce and the spicy cilantro sauce, both are really good but I prefer the traditional olive lemon sauce with my chicken tagine.",5.0

"Even after living in New York my whole life, this is still one of my all-time favorite places in NYC and go-to brunch spot. I went here for this past weekend with friends and we all left so happy. Our server was amazing, checked in on us, made sure we were all seated quickly and happy with our food. The food is the best Moroccan breakfast you'll have in New York. I ordered a blood orange mimosa (yum!) and the Mediterranean eggs over easy and scraped my plate clean. The eggs come with a warm zahatar pita, a very generous helping of creamy, rich hummus, tabouli and a salad. The Williamsburg location has a sun-roof and is stunning, sunny, and beautifully-decorated; you are instantly transported into a Moroccan garden. If you haven't been already - add it to the top of your list!",5.0
"Amazing food, amazing people, and phenomenal vibe. I just can't say enough good things about this place. This is one of few places in the neighborhood I continuously come back to. Something for everyone (I came here for dinner with a vegan who's got other food allergies and a massive carnivore - each was fully satisfied.) great dips to have with some veg or pita (especially the babaganouj), delicious Greek salad (all the salads are great, Greek is my personal favorite), the tagines are to die for (I like lamb but all delicious!) the wine list is great too - something for any price range. The service is also phenomenal, just the right amount of attention, friendly but not in-your-face. Good place for group dinners and dates alike, have done both here!",5.0
"The three stars are for the amazing food and the back area, which is always pleasant to eat in. The amazing food is why I keep coming back. Unfortunately, the very surprising service received in my previous dining experience overshadowed the good food.I am not giving this place any more stars because, after being a regular customer, I was surprised that a waitress said out loud that the tip in New York is 18%. Mind you she said, and again, out loud ""TIP"" and not service charge. I was short $2 dollars TIP on a $100 bill and since I was a regular and have been waited on by this waitress before then I would pay more on tip the next time I came back. Seriously, the waitress made a very concentrated effort to try to embarrass us in front of other customers by yelling it out so that all other customers could hear that she was demanding a higher tip and that she felt we didn't tip enough.I truly don't need the attitude.

"The ambiance and decor is very nice and comfortable. The dim lighting is good for a date. The soup of the day was curry cauliflower (vegan!) and it was delicious!

"I have been a long time fan of the east village location so I was excited to take my parents here for my mom's birthday. It was their first time trying Moroccan food, or anything close it. They were feeling adventurous!SERVICEWasn't the best. The hostess sat us right by the door and it felt really awkward. I asked if there were any seats available inside, she went to check, came back and said no. I was a bit surprised as the restaurant was not all that packed. When my waitress arrived, I asked again and she was able to move us. There were plenty of seats in the back.Our new waiter was fine, but was just that. He did not go beyond taking out orders, and seemed very aloof. Or maybe he was being hipster, (and subtly condescending in his posture by nature) I'm not sure.FOOD:We ordered:Butternut squash and turnip soup (special) - quite good!Hummus - the bread was perfectly fluffyMussels - very good! So juicy and tenderLamb tagine with apricots and prunes - always a must. Fall of the bone meat, did not disappointDuck confit - as usual, skin was so crispy!! The above was more than enough for three people, we had no room for dessert.Service was a bit shotty but I would still come back for the amazing food",4.0

"Came here in the morning for brunch. Very cool, I liked the décor a lot, and managed to match it- totally by default, not planned. We started out with a bunch of apps- the pita with the tzatziki and hummus, also, the olive plate and a garlic add on- the last being the most delicious. We got the Morroccan tea- always get this, it was the best thing ever. Super delicious, and green to boot. We also got the lychee martini- this was the winner by far, I tried the ginger and didn't like it as much since the vodka was really strong in this one (not sure why I did the Star Wars reference. Just go with it) I tried the frittata- warning- this takes some time to come out. There aren't a big number of veggie options here, so stick with the basics if you are veggie. The restaurant has a location at the back as well, like a greenhouse, which is fun to sit in, if you want to laze in the sun. The tables etc are set up like a French café which is a nice touch. They also have fans on in case it gets too hot for you.",5.0
Stick with the tagines. Those are their house specials and you just want to melt in the sauce.Perfect for a romantic dinner or small group of friends.

"Cafe Mogador is one of my favorite spots in NYC. It has everything I look for in a restaurant: great food, service, ambiance and most importantly consistency. There are a very few spots that I would frequent. Cafe Mogador is one of them. Cafe Mogador has two locations, one in East Village and the other in Williamsburg. The food is delicious at both locations, but the ambiance and service is on another level in Williamsburg. During my last visit, we were seated in the back atrium which is basically like a greenhouse filled with plants and diners. I was there in the winter but I love to experience it during the spring/summer. My table shared a ~$40 bottle of red wine (suggested by the waitress) and a platter of dips. The dips were delicious, differing in flavor and texture. Baba ghanoush was my favorite, but then again it always is. Their pita is to die for! It's served warm (baked in house I think), and has just the right amount of seasoning and chewiness to it. It's more naan-like than other pita I've had. For our entrees, two of us got the lamb tangine and one person got the blackened chicken. The lamb falls apart to the touch, its so juicy and tender! I'm someone who likes to try a variety of entrees on the menu, but at Mogador I will never get anything but the lamb. It's just too good to pass up. The chicken was also well cooked and seasoned, not overly blackened. But c'mon the lamb!! Overall, Cafe Mogador is a solid restaurant. I know I can go there, get good service, eat amazing food, and not break the bank. Couldn't be happier with them :)",5.0

"Wonderful ambiance, delicious food. Enjoyed the mixed appetizer plate with roasted eggplant, salad and subbed the baba ganoush for the hummus.

Very good ambiance in the Williamsburg location.  Came with another family for the chicken tangine.Overall the food was very good.  Drinks and bottles of wine are nicely priced.  I would just caution folks with parties 5 or more as they only have a few tables big enough that can accommodate a larger group.NO RESERVATIONS so keep that in mind as well.We arrived for a early dinner around 6pm by the time we left at least 20 people waiting for tables and I overheard most had been waiting for over 30 mins.The food is worth the wait you can't go wrong here.  We had a very good experience with the waitstaff.  They were very attentive and each course was served in the appropriate time.We will be back,4.0
"Everything we ate at Mogador was substandard and tasteless. Its really a shame because it has a nice hipster/casual vibe, and we really were expecting to like this place - in fact we drove 30 minutes to get there based on the reviews. But sadly we both agreed that the food just sucked. First there was the soup - which was more like a Minestrone with chickpeas without any kind of spice or flavor - we came in out of the cold and were really craving some hot soup, and we could not finish this because of the taste. Then the tandoor bread - something I have always loved in Indian restaurants but they found someway to screw this up too. Then we had the waitress's favorite dish - the spicy Chermoula Tangine.... two drumsticks in a boring sauce. We could not finish - the taste was annoying. And then the fish tangine, the most expensive dish, and speciality ... a small piece of fish in an enticing orange sauce ... but despite the good looks, the sauce was boring and flavorless. Its a mystery to me how a place can call itself a Morocan restaurant and not have any clue in the world about using spices or making Moroccan food. I have made moroccan style beef in a slow cooker using a recipe from America's Test Kitchen that tasted way better than anything here - not to mention having some real Moroccan food in Europe that had a completely different texture and flavor. When we got home, we made some coffee just to get the lingering taste of the food out of our mouthes. It was not horrible but just not pleasant. The people working there were all pretty reasonable. The waitress was very nice. We did have to wait an hour to get a table, and there was virtually no where to even stand during that time, and freezing temps outs. But the place has a good vibe.I hope they hire a chef who knows what he/she is doing.",2.0

"I felt fortunate that the number of people in my dinner party enabled me to make a weeknight reservation, as this place is popular! Our group was seated shortly after 8pm on a Thursday, and we were thrilled when we found out that we would be dining in the covered backyard. The atrium is gorgeous!We ordered family style and shared the halumi, mixed platter, chicken tagine, mixed grill, duck confit, and special of the night (whole fish). The food was fresh and tasty, but admittedly nothing special. Portion sizes were fine, a little on the small side for hungry or big eaters. That being said, the diligent waitstaff and amazing ambiance make this a place worth checking out a second time. It's a great spot for a date or to catch up with a few friends.",4.0
"Strolling along Wythe Avenue with my daughter and we stopped in for a late brunch. Honestly, I have never had such a wonderful brunch in such a long time, from the Country Breakfast and the Middle Eastern eggs, the best cappucino ever, and the service was awesome. We waited 15 minutes on a busy Saturday, so it was really astonishing we sat so quickly and easily. Our table mates were friendly, and we really relaxed. The labne and the arabic salad, hummus and tabouli filled us up and we were so satisfied and happy at the end of our meal. I wish we could have been seated in the back, where the dining area was similar to a greenhouse, but maybe next time.What a great place to visit when in Brooklyn!",5.0

Then we had the waitress's favorite dish - the spicy Chermoula Tangine.... two drumsticks in a boring sauce. We could not finish - the taste was annoying. And then the fish tangine, the most expensive dish, and speciality ... a small piece of fish in an enticing orange sauce ... but despite the good looks, the sauce was boring and flavorless. Its a mystery to me how a place can call itself a Morocan restaurant and not have any clue in the world about using spices or making Moroccan food. I have made moroccan style beef in a slow cooker using a recipe from America's Test Kitchen that tasted way better than anything here - not to mention having some real Moroccan food in Europe that had a completely different texture and flavor. When we got home, we made some coffee just to get the lingering taste of the food out of our mouthes. It was not horrible but just not pleasant. The people working there were all pretty reasonable. The waitress was very nice. We did have to wait an hour to get a table, and there was virtually no where to even stand during that time, and freezing temps outs. But the place has a good vibe.I hope they hire a chef who knows what he/she is doing.",2.0
"Contrary to the reviews shown for this establishment, my experience was repugnant. The host was one of the rudest guys I've ever encountered in my life. The food was very good though, and the atrium is gorgeous but, too much rudeness for my liking. Thanks, but no thanks.",1.0
"I felt fortunate that the number of people in my dinner party enabled me to make a weeknight reservation, as this place is popular! Our group was seated shortly after 8pm on a Thursday, and we were thrilled when we found out that we would be dining in the covered backyard. The atrium is gorgeous!We ordered family style and shared the halumi, mixed platter, chicken tagine, mixed grill, duck confit, and special of the night (whole fish). The food was fresh and tasty, but admittedly nothing special. Portion sizes were fine, a little on the small side for hungry or big eaters. That being said, the diligent waitstaff and amazing ambiance make this a place worth checking out a second time. It's a great spot for a date or to catch up with a few friends.",4.0
"Strolling along Wythe Avenue with my daughter and we stopped in for a late brunch. Honestly, I have never had such a wonderful brunch in such a long time, from the Country Breakfast and the Middle Eastern eggs, the best cappucino ever, and the service was awesome. We waited 15 minutes on a busy Saturday, so it was really astonishing we sat so quickly and easily. Our table mates were friendly, and we really relaxed. The labne and the arabic salad, hummus and tabouli filled us up and we were so satisfied and happy at the end of our meal. I wish we could have been seated in the back, where the dining area was similar to a greenhouse, but maybe next time.What a great place to visit when in Brooklyn!",5.0
Can't say enough good things about this place. The brunch and dinner is to die for. Definitely get the hummus as an appetizer and their iced tea is delicious tastes like iced grey tea. Love the ambience especially in the back feels very Moroccan and has cute plants everywhere.,5.0
"I stayed 3-4 blocks away during my trip (end of April 2015) and my host suggested this place....how I am happy to follow her suggestion. I came for a brunch and arrived early so easy to get a table. The service is quick and courteous. The food is great, I had Middle Eastern Eggs and I cleaned my plate. Oh there was a bonus as well James Murphy from LCD Soundsystem was there as well. What ...you don't know him? You're in the wrong place then...this is Williamsburg.",5.0
"Came in for a couple of wine glasses with a friend and to chat about life. Sat at the bar as we got in pretty early during dinner time and it wasn't full at all. Beautiful decor, nice vibe and the perfect atmosphere that we were looking for to chat. The music was also perfect with zero top 40 and the perfect mix of mood music to chill you out. Ordered the delicious hummus with soft pita bread that was warm and so good.Will be back way more for dinner, but highly recommended for drinks and a great atmosphere for conversing. 4.5 stars.",4.0
"We were nearby the brewery and Moroccan food sounded good. The GF and I came in Friday and the front area was pretty empty but the back area was packed, patio dining but minus the uncomfortable cold that was out. We made it in time for the lunch special a soup or salad and pasta of the day or their chicken tagine for 11 bucks! That's like crazy for Brooklyn so we both took it up, with the snag being that they were out of the pasta of the day-my GF's choice so eventually, she just mirrored my choice: tagine with charmoulla, a spicy sauce. I went with the salad while my gf's butternut squash soup was a smooth and a great warm up. My salad was pretty good, with beets scattered throughout and the dressing a zesty little....wait. WHAT'S THAT?!There it was, legs in the air, some kind of bug. We waited for our server to come by-but it did take her a little while to come by during our short time here. We ended up waving a busser over and he brought over a different server and she said that we could tell her, but, well I don't know I guess it's something we want our server to deal with directly, and besides she was 12 feet away at the bar not doing much, anyway. So, off she went and our server came by and when we showed her, she was shocked and took it away and the manager came by. She apologized profusely and explained that the greens were organic mesclun and pre-washed and so just taken from bag to plate. (I tend to rewash all my bagged greens anyway, but you know, whatever.) She did say we could choose to leave but if  we did stay everything we had would be gratis and gave us time to decide. Our server came by again and the gf said to take away the soup. ""Is the soup not to your liking?"" Um, really? that's your first thought? Anyway, we decided to leave and went elsewhere.",1.0
"The ambiance of this place is excellent - very cute and intimate and the decor is wonderful. The waitress was extremely helpful and the cocktails were very strong - almost too strong but one can't complain about a restaurant that doesn't skimp out on alcohol. The Halumi cheese appetizer was wonderful. I would have to say that the homemade pita bread was one of the highlights of the meal - very light and airy, slightly charred. As for the hummus, it was standard fare to me. The chicken tagine was awesome. Very tender and fell right off the bone. As for the cous cous - also standard. I would definitely come back here as I believe there is more to try - different sauces, appetizers, etc. I liked the wide variety of dishes on the menu (i.e. not just hummus, but babaghanoush, Arabic salad, etc.) Generally, the food was fair, but the ambiance and the wait staff really made the experience that much better. I hope to expect more for my next visit!",4.0

"Great Labne, great duck confit (perfect interior/exterior texture differential) and my fish tagine special was wonderful.

"My boyfriend's aunt is Moroccan and makes the most delicious food ever so finding an authentic & flavorful Moroccan restaurant has been a long and hard journey filled with constant disappointment.  Everyone's favorite part about the holidays is eating Georgette's home cooking, which would take her over a course of the week or two in advance to prepare.  So every Moroccan place I've tried in comparison to her food has been actually been no comparison... until I discovered Cafe Mogador.I loved Cafe Mogador the moment I spotted it on the streets.  It was a warm summer night with candlelit tables lining the front of the restaurant, which called out to me ""Come in- eat and be happy"". I went a couple of times.  The first time was at night in which I sat inside the restaurant closer to the front & the second time was for brunch in which I sat in the back/garden-ish area.  You won't be disappointed wherever you sit. The decor is warm and inviting and is perfect for dates, friends, brunch, dinner, whatever and whenever.Having brunch in the back/garden area was wonderful.  Felt like being outdoors without actually being outdoors.  It felt fresh & refreshing being there on a Sunday afternoon with my girl friends sipping on mimosas.On to the food-- the star of the place-- everything I've ever tried there has been absolutely perfect.  Calamari salad, lamb tagine, beets, babaganoush, eggs, etc. have all been cooked to the right readiness: lamb tagine was falling a part at the touch of a fork, eggs were slightly runny like I like it and calamari was oh so tender.  The dishes have the prime blend of spices smothering your tongue in full bodied flavors.Customer service was great too. Our server was friendly and always on point with keeping my glass of water full.After writing this, I'm hungry for some lamb tagine.  I want it NOW.",5.0

The food is absolutely fantastic, the service great, the ambiance relaxing and welcoming. I had the blackstone eggs, which was a Benedict with crispy bacon, perfectly poached eggs, lightly dressed salad, and home fries and freshly squeezed OJ on the side.

"I have no problem driving from Staten Island and sitting in traffic just to get there for lunch and order their Steak with French Fries and Arugula salad !

Designed so cosy, romantic and overall just beautiful ! This place is a great date spot or a place to go with friends.Food:Out of all the items I've ordered, the steak with arugula salad is just heaven !  It's honestly cooked to perfection. The salad is very light and has a light zesty taste. The French fries are perfectly crispy and the steak just melts in your mouth! The only down fall I would say is having to wait until 6o'clock for it to be available to order since it's just on their dinner menu.Customer service: Besides the fact that all the waitress look like European supermodels, they are extremely professional, and courteous ! They don't annoy you by coming to your table every three seconds asking ""is everything okay"" and they do not leave you without water ! They have the perfect balance.

"We had dinner here before a show at the Brooklyn Bowl. The beet martini and the spicy margarita were delicious. For appetizers, the halloumi, beets and olives were amazing. The salmon, duck, and bastilla left our table as clean plates. So delicious! I loved the outdoor vibe on a chilly March night. We were very happy that they were able to squeeze the 3 of us in after only about a half hour although we didn't have reservations and it was Saturday night. Highly recommend!",4.0
"Lovely. Exquisite. Modest. Comfortable.This location is the finest in the neighborhood. You are greeted immediately as you walk in to a warm and inviting room. The restaurant is always packed. The bartenders are professional.I have been on multiple occasions and found the greatest strength of this place is the service. The waiters, back waiters, and bussers work together in a harmonious dance to create an ambiance and spirit that goes beyond feeding their guests with their inventive and superb dishes. Your water glass is never half full; there is never a plate or accouterment on the table in vain.The back area is gorgeous. It's where I usually want to sit with family and friends. It's the perfect date spot for new and old couples or a great place to catch up with a dear friend.",5.0
I love this place.  The patio almost feels like the outdoors. And what's better than a fully insulated and climate controlled garden. It's always crowded but never too long a wait. And I woke up the next day wanting to go back just because the lamb tagine and chicken bastille were so delicious.,5.0
"Really cool vibe, chill place that's casual fancy, cheap quality eats, and a clean bathroom!  Huge plus!The kafta is to die for. Order that first before it gets finished. I talked it up so much on the way there to the location in Manhattan, and it was gone :( very sad day. Their roasted cauliflower is really, and the hummus and arabic salad are legit. Fresh baked bread compliments this to a great dinning experience. I have yet to try their tea or other mains but I guess I'll just need to keep coming back. Oh well. All for research sake! :)",5.0

"My bf and I came here on a Sat night since we wanted to have a date in Williamsburg.  It's a cute place for a date or small group outings (saw lots of baby strollers) Be sure to grab the bigger tables out back or the outdoor searing. No reservations, we arrived at 7 so we were lucky we didn't have to wait. By the time that we left at 830, there was a line outside the door. The place is so, so cute...cozy, romantic. Nice decor. The service is great too- our waitress made great recs and was prompt. Mainly though, the food was great.  Really unique Moroccan food (though the food just skewed Mediterranean). We shared the hummus (really good olive oil in the middle), my bf liked it but it had a bitter, chalky ish taste. The pita was really fresh- warm and soft. I ordered the Bastilla- a ground chicken dish with lots of spices (turmeric, cumin, garlic etc) packed into a soft phyllo dough. Not greasy at all like spinopika (sp?). The dough was soft.  I got the Casablanca sauce, which was nutty, chickpeas, etc.- sweet and savory.  The sauce was like a really good curry.  A healthy portion.  I had a glass of the Portuguese Temperanillo wine which was a mix between a medium body cab and a  spicy Shiraz. My bf got the chicken tagine with the spicy cilantro sauce- the chicken was so tender and yummy. Portions were a bit small. But then again it came with good soft cous cous.  The tagine was a real deal- very slowly cooked. For desert, we shared the flourless almond orange cake, which was very orange-y. Soaked in an orange liqueur and really flavorful creme fraiche to cut through the sweetness. bf had the Turkish coffee which came in really traditional cup and carafe..it was the sweetest Turkish coffee I ever had though. $66 for our dinner- worth a return if in the neighborhood.",4.0

"Cafe Mogador has a beautiful ambiance. The festive decor makes you feel like you're on an island somewhere along the Mediterranean Sea. The food is a savory collision of smoke and spice. The colorful dishes taste as delightful as the presentation. I came here for brunch, and decided to try the Halumi Eggs. Fluffy poached eggs over luscious roasted tomatoes, wonderfully seasoned halumi cheese, a light, delectable salad, and warm zahatar pita bread. The only fault I found in this plate was there was not enough. I didn't want my Moroccan daydream to end!The service was attentive and the staff was very accommodating.  There was a bit of a miscommunication during seating, and while it essentially was not a big deal, our waitress apologized and gave us free freshly squeezed orange juice -- which I highly suggest you order. Their orange juice tasted like they were handpicked from the fields of Sicily. The sweetest, most refreshing orange juice my palate has ever experienced.Cafe Mogador is like taking a mouth-enticing whimsical voyage to the marvelous Mediterranean without the sea sickness, the inconvenience of passport checks, breaking your wallet on cheap souvenirs, a couple pills of Immodium, or even that restless leg 10-hour flight.",4.0

It arrived with a dollop of yogurt in the middle. Spread, stir, enjoy. Yummy. She then switched her attentions to an addictive plate of fried halumi cheese while I followed with the Lamb Tagine Casablanca anda side of cous cous, a criminally  ambrosial dish served in just the right portion.

We ordered 2 appetizers and 2 entrees for the four of us to share. The mixed platter was hummus, tabouli, eggplant and tahini, and salad. Everything was fresh and delicious, though we had to ask for more bread. The mussels were fresh and the broth was light and flavorful and paired perfectly with the garlic toast (we asked for more of that too). LOVED the lamb tagine with the casablanca. It had this wonderful salty-sweet combo of chickpeas, onions, and raisins that went really well with the gamey lamb, which was tender and falling off the bone. The Bastilla was wonderfully flaky and the filling was very fragrant with spices and the chicken and egg. On a normal day, you probably would want to order at least one more dish to round out a meal for 4 people. But since we were all a little inebriated, this was just the right amount.

My only qualm was that I wish that I had the option of ordering the Lamb Tagine as part of the lunch special.

"You arrive at 8:00PM on a Friday. It's busy. The wait for two is 40 minutes, but luckily there are benches outside for you and your SO to sit on for the wait. They're busy. It's popular. Not a bad indication that there's a long wait, but neither of you anticipated it, and maybe a brown bag would've been fun to pass the time outside.But the minutes go by quickly (Williamsburg is great for people watching). You're seated at a small table under a shelf. You're tall and your head feels in danger, and your petite date laughs. It would have been nice to be seated in the backyard. The decor feels like a mixture of American farmhouse accessorized with Moroccan wares for a Mediterranean-lite atmosphere, but it's tastefully done, and the light levels and music are good.You begin with a tasty tempranillo from Argentina. A touch of spice blends with subtle stone fruit notes and light tannins for a red that will pair well with just about anything. It's not a $40 bottle, but that's restaurant markup for you.The calamari salad arrives, breaded, fried, and seasoned to perfection. The tentacles crunch as the breading flakes into your mouth, giving way to the chewy cephalopod's cooked carcass. Yum. You wish there was more. The lemon-braised greens partner well.Another glass of tempranillo down and the main course arrives. Sea bass, and chicken tangine with apricot and prune sauce. The fish is fantastic. The tangine equally so. Your taste buds will thank you if you order either of these entrees. (Note - if you're expecting a meatier bass, it's not, it's a flakier white fish, perhaps Chilean sea bass, which isn't really a bass, but we won't get into semantics and taxonomy. I don't think they're passing off tilapia as bass as one reviewer suspected. Or at least I hope they aren't. It was delicious either way).You leave fully satiated. A good date. A good spot.

"Man, I love this place. Yes, the wait can be long at times (for brunch), but it is always worth it. The middle eastern eggs meal is to die for! It is healthy and flavorful. The meal consists for hummus, really really good tabouleh, eggs, a spiced piece of pita and a cucumber tomato salad. My middle eastern roots are showing but this place brings me home!It is kid friendly yet cool, has a nice covered outdoor area, and serves a mean tagine.

"I'd love to visit Morocco after eating here! Or, why even have to travel to Morocco if I can Hopstop my way to Williamsburg in 20 minutes? My friend and I made plans to have lunch and shop around Williamsburg, and we stumbled into this gem. We came on a weekday afternoon, and there were mostly young families and children. I would definitely recommend sitting in the outdoor patio in the back, if there's room. The Chicken Tagine and Cous Cous were delicious, as well as the must-have Moroccan Mint Tea! My only qualm was that I wish that I had the option of ordering the Lamb Tagine as part of the lunch special. I paid $18 (including tax and tip) for my lunch, which I consider a bit pricey for what is considered a ""lunch special.""

"The BF kept going on and on about the Moroccan mint tea here, so I finally gave it a shot. I hate when he's right, but this time I have to admit it. The tea is hot and minty, with just a touch of sweetness. Who knew a piping hot beverage could be so refreshing? Not quite knowing what it was, I ordered the chicken tagine lunch special, which comes with rice or the pasta of the day. What a pleasant surprise when the waitress placed a plate of stewed chicken in front of me, with juicy meat that fell right off the bones. The lunch special also comes with the soup of the day or a mesclun salad. I'll take the tasty lamb/noodle broth I received over boring old greens ANY day!Great date spot, I should add. It's cute, charming, and cozy like your favorite sweater (or local cafe, which is probably a closer comparison).

"I LOVE this place. Except for the wait times on the weekends for brunch. But that's because the brunch is so damn good and so many people want to try it!It's $15 for a meal, coffee and juice etc. It's so affordable and so tasty. I'm pretty sure they have a $25 deal with brunch as well that includes Bloody Marys etc. I can not recommend the place enough. Our eggs were not poached to perfection (or rather they were over-poached), we were fine and didn't even complain, but the amazing hostess came by and said she'd make us all a new batch (there was 8 of us) and she did so promptly and they were perfect!I havent been to W'burg location for dinner yet, but I'm sure it is just as brilliant as the weekend brunch!",5.0

"The review is for brunch only (although I look forward to revising it after indulging in dinners here as well ...)First, I'm grateful that CM offers a weekday brunch.  I also appreciate the way that they've creatively taken traditional brunch dishes and infused them with Moroccan/Mediterranean elements (ie: Moroccan Benedict, which was like a small helping of shakshuka on an English muffin!)  You might think this to be the obvious way to go, but I've been to plenty of Mediterranean restaurants that drop the ball here (see my review for Lokal).The combination of delicious dishes spilling with aromatic flavors and libations with a twist (try the blood orange mimosa) keep me coming back.  And thanks to my friends, I've tasted every single brunch/breakfast option.  Dishes are large and filling, leaving me sad when I can't lick the plate clean.  But alas, swimsuit weather is always just around  the corner...I look forward to having here dinner.  I'm a little too excited about it, actually.",5.0

"Really good fresh food. Go during off peak hours if you want to avoid crowds and prefer less noise. They also serve kind of late day brunch options which is nice. What surprises me is that the restaurant can get too busy and refuse a simple take out order over the phone (even though it's within the hours for take out that they list and from the truncated take out menu). Thought that was not on par with the capabilities of other restaurants. Apparently take out is only when they feel like they can handle it. I was nice about it. But whoever answered the phone was unfriendly and blunt. A simple explanation and apology, ""I'm sorry but the restaurant is too busy to do take out orders right now"" would've been a much better experience for me, the customer. Regardless of whether you're slammed or not, I shouldn't feel like I'm ""bothering"" someone by calling to order during the times that they list. And if you're that busy, good for you, you're making money, stop being a crank. Improved customer service and ease of take out would increase their business.",4.0
"Found Cafe Mogador through Yelp as we were going to see a concert at Rough Trader a couple of blocks away later in the evening. I'm happy to say, Yelp pulled through! The ambience is warm, yet hip --exposed brick, warm lighting, vintage pics on the wall. The ladies room (always a true test of mine) is clean. This place is mid-size and the noise level was medium. Our waitress was pleasant and knowledgable. We ordered the Mixed Platter to start. The eggplant was perfectly roasted with tahini; the hummus -tasty as was the rest of the items on the platter. Great item for the price. Our entrees were: Lamb Casablanca Tagine and Grilled Lamb with rice, veggies and salad. Both were delicious. My husband raved about his leg of tender lamb, slowly cooked. The grilled lamb, which I had, were pieces of wholesome goodness of meat! I'm giving Cafe Mogador 5 stars because the food was delicious and well worth their prices. My husband didn't like the wine he ordered and our waitress simply took it off the tab --no further issues. She was very cool about it, apologized and didn't lead us to believe we're the problem.

"I LOVE this place. Except for the wait times on the weekends for brunch. But that's because the brunch is so damn good and so many people want to try it!It's $15 for a meal, coffee and juice etc. It's so affordable and so tasty. I'm pretty sure they have a $25 deal with brunch as well that includes Bloody Marys etc. I can not recommend the place enough. Our eggs were not poached to perfection (or rather they were over-poached), we were fine and didn't even complain, but the amazing hostess came by and said she'd make us all a new batch (there was 8 of us) and she did so promptly and they were perfect!I havent been to W'burg location for dinner yet, but I'm sure it is just as brilliant as the weekend brunch!",5.0

"I had brunch on Sunday morning. We got there early so we were able to get seated promptly. The place is nicely designed with Moroccan touches.

"Café Mogador's best invention is the ""$5 menu"" of small bites and appetizers at the top of the menu. At that price, and with seven people dining on a recent Saturday evening, we were able to sample a broad section of the menu before the main course arrived.Highlights were numerous, including the sour cucumber yogurt, which paired well with the continually running out pieces of pita. (This restaurant seriously underestimates the pita-to-topping ratio, especially when eight appetizers arrive at the table at once.) Labne was pretty similar to the cucumber yogurt, but harder and with more of a zest. It went quickly, as did the bites of shrimp and calamari that came as well.We were pretty tired by the time of the main course - the service was friendly but not particularly fast - as we polished off two bottles of wine while waiting. (Both bottles were spicy and in the 30s, two pluses.) We split entrees, me having a quite nice tagine while others sampled the blackened chicken and salmon.My one additional complaint would be that with the exception of the presence of tagging and the occasional side of couscous the restaurant isn't particularly Moroccan.

"I could eat JUST the pita...and be happy! That's how GOOD this place is! It's the simple things that they do just right. I started with their:Sampler= 3/5. It's good, but not great.

I would much rather have the Tabouleh as a salad dish. Then I proceeded to their organic salad with apple crisps and beets= 4/5. A good, solid salad. My friends got the goat cheese salad, and I think I like that even better even though I only had a small taste. And lastly, I ended with the: lamb tagine with cous cous= 4/5!

The chicken was REALLY good, but the lamb lacked a whole lot of flavor!

"I flew into New York on a Friday evening, and Cafe Mogador satisfied my cross-country munchies. Katie M. and I went for a late dinner and were able to get a patio table after a brief stay at the bar. We could've gotten a table right away but the patio was worth the wait - lovely semi-outdoor space with a lot of cozy atmosphere. Service was great, prompt and friendly. We drank Tempranillo by the glass and had a very relaxing catch-up meal.The food was excellent, sating a craving for Moroccan food I didn't know I had. Spicy harissa paste stood in where you might find olive oil and balsamic on an Italian table. A tiny bit on pita went a long way, kickstarting my appetite with a lick of fire. Katie and I shared a mixed platter to start, and this was a tasty assortment. We feasted on hummus, roasted eggplant and tahini, tabouli, and Arabic salad. The spreads were creamy and flavorful, and I loved the refreshing zip of the greens. I rotated them all while tearing off fresh hunks of pita. It was a fun way to eat.We shared a couple appetizers and a tagine for the bulk of our meal, and I'd do the exact same thing all over again. The roasted halumi cheese was warm and delicious with pleasant texture, served with grilled vegetables and zahatar pita. I was a bit unenthusiastic when our waitress recommended the chicken skewers, but they were a highlight of our meal. The meat was perfectly cooked, tender and moist, and it came with harissa and cucumber yogurt. The best dish of the night, though, was the lamb tagine, which we ordered with apricots and prunes. This was a velvety lamb stew, simmered with herbs and spices  and served over a bed of cous cous (or basmati rice if you prefer). The meat fell right off the bone, and each bite carried aromatic lamb and rich, flavorful stew in almost equal measure. The stewed apricot and prune added some sweetness but never too much. I would travel pretty far to eat this again.We shared two desserts but for the life of me I can't remember the specifics. There was a panna cotta and maybe a cheesecake. One had coconut. The panna cotta was a little too wiggly but the cake was great.I understand that Mogador also puts on a nice brunch, and I hope to come back for another meal when I'm in New York again. The food and ambiance were just excellent, well worth revisiting, even on vacation.",5.0

In the future I will stick with the appetizers from the regular menu which run $5 each, are are quite good.Dinner was delicious.  I had the duck  and my husband had the flank steak, also off the specials. Both were delicious but was a little disappointed that they would not allow us to substitute the side orders at all (I really didn't want the fries with the duck).  I would have paid the extra cost, but the waitress wouldn't allow it.  Oh well...The drink was small but packed a punch.  Quite strong. We had the jalapeno margarita.  Only needed the one drink for the night.Overall, great experience.  Lovely atmosphere, seats you quickly. Ask for the garden room in the back.",4.0

"Called ahead for a group of 6 and while the restaurant was tight, they did everything they could to get us a table. Really appreciated that.The hostess, waitress and servers were spot on all evening. And as noted, it is a very cozy, romantic place -- the décor, music and lighting all work to make it a great place for a meal.We had a mix of appetizers which were all delicious -- obviously try the hummus, but the beets, salads, eggplant, falafel were all tasty.This was our first time at the restaurant and we didn't stray off the main dishes (I will explore the ample list of specials next time). Two mixed grills, two lamb tagines and two vegetarian couscous.Thumbs up on the mixed grills (although I'm never a huge fan of merguez sausage wherever I try it -- just don't like the texture).The lamb tagine in Casablanca sauce and couscous was very tasty, if a tad sweet (and a tad small for my appetite at least).The vegetarian couscous was the least popular as it was lacking seasoning, surprising since everything else was loaded with flavor. It needed salt and hot sauce from the table.The coffee was excellent and two desserts on point -- the ubiquitous molten chocolate cake and a strawberry rhubarb crumble served in a small crockpot.I will definitely come back and explore more of the menu. Kudos again for squeezing us in and making us feel at home.",4.0

All came with fries/cous cous and salad and were delicious! I ordered the duck and it was amazing! Crispy skin and tender meat. I was told by the table that all the meat was well cooked. Unfortunately that night, they ran out of the steak.This place is great! Food delicious and prices are great! The pistachio,mango and lychee martini are pretty good as well!",5.0
"Great brunch place! The eggs benedict are amazing and the pancakes are to die for. We usually order a few things and share since the plates are pretty big. The coffee is great and the orange juice is very fresh and light. The wait is usually around 30-40 minutes, but well worth it.",5.0
"Great great food - always consistent, the staff is super chill and fun, while always being professional. The brunch is amazing try the Moroccan egg benedict, and all the little sides are so tasty, the cucumber yoghurt, the falafel...i go there everyweek and seriously the quality of the food is outstanding for that price.Also must try their lunch deal: soup or salad and tagines or couscous. Really good deal for 17 dollars I think...Enjoy!",5.0
This place is probably one of the best Mediterranean food restaurants if you are looking for a trendy ambiance in the New York City/ brooklyn area. The food is fresh and well seasoned! I recommend the cucumber yogurt as well as their chicken! It is a romantic setting for the most part although it gets loud during the weekends... Make sure to make a reservation!,5.0

"Great restaurant with what I think is a limited menu. We came here because our friends visiting from the upper east side are vegetarians.  They liked the food. The wine was excellent. The service was also very good. But not friendly. I guess that's probably asking a bit much. The place was packed and the service was fine. My dish (Casablanca Tangine) was okay but the side dishes were excellent. Not sure if I would come back, seems more trendy. Not really a staple restaurant for me.",4.0

"I went back again and Friday night with the hubby alone and ordered appetizers from the specials.  I didn't like the sardines at all.  I like fish, but they cannot smell.  And these did.  I also thought the appetizers from the specials were overpriced at $10/each and the portions were a little small.  Sorry I didn't take a picture.  I am not used to pulling out my phone and snapping shots of food while dining out... In the future I will stick with the appetizers from the regular menu which run $5 each, are are quite good.Dinner was delicious.  I had the duck  and my husband had the flank steak, also off the specials. Both were delicious but was a little disappointed that they would not allow us to substitute the side orders at all (I really didn't want the fries with the duck).  I would have paid the extra cost, but the waitress wouldn't allow it.  Oh well...The drink was small but packed a punch.  Quite strong. We had the jalapeno margarita.  Only needed the one drink for the night.Overall, great experience.  Lovely atmosphere, seats you quickly. Ask for the garden room in the back.",4.0

"Called ahead for a group of 6 and while the restaurant was tight, they did everything they could to get us a table. Really appreciated that.The hostess, waitress and servers were spot on all evening. And as noted, it is a very cozy, romantic place -- the décor, music and lighting all work to make it a great place for a meal.We had a mix of appetizers which were all delicious -- obviously try the hummus, but the beets, salads, eggplant, falafel were all tasty.This was our first time at the restaurant and we didn't stray off the main dishes (I will explore the ample list of specials next time). Two mixed grills, two lamb tagines and two vegetarian couscous.Thumbs up on the mixed grills (although I'm never a huge fan of merguez sausage wherever I try it -- just don't like the texture).The lamb tagine in Casablanca sauce and couscous was very tasty, if a tad sweet (and a tad small for my appetite at least).The vegetarian couscous was the least popular as it was lacking seasoning, surprising since everything else was loaded with flavor. It needed salt and hot sauce from the table.The coffee was excellent and two desserts on point -- the ubiquitous molten chocolate cake and a strawberry rhubarb crumble served in a small crockpot.I will definitely come back and explore more of the menu. Kudos again for squeezing us in and making us feel at home.",4.0

"We ordered the mixed grill here and we were served a large platter of meats and skewers, with a nice salad as a side and some very tasty rice. Suffice it to say, the food was really good! The meat was very well seasoned and the tzatziki sauce really added to the flavor.The atmosphere was also really nice! It was very lively, lots of people and some nice music, but we didn't have to wait to be seated at all (we were 2). Their was also a kind of outdoor-garden type of environment in the back, which looked really cosy, but unfortunately they didn't have any room there anymore.Overall, the service was pretty good, no real remarks about that.

"I was so happy when I heard that Cafe Mogador was opening up shop in north Brooklyn. Their East Village location has provided me with many excellent brunches, (and some awkward ones, i mean come on.) Fortunately, the quality of their Moroccan sauce and the sheer value of the meal never failed to satisfy me and definitely made up for any uncomfortable silences.Mogador's been open for a while, but for some reason it took us a few months to decide that the best day to indulge would be the day we had delusions of energy and walked from the tippy top of Greenpoint down to their location on Wythe. It was like the trail of tears. But. With sweat. Instead of tears. Fortunately for us, our wait was about 5 minutes and we were seated by the window. If you're unfamiliar with Williamsburg, I have to tell you...the neighborhood provides some amazing people watching opportunities. I'm happy to report that the food was just as excellent as that of their location across the river. The Moroccan Benedict (Like the classic, but with a splash of the tangy, tomato-pepper sauce on each muffin) hit the spot, as did our iced lattes and orange juice. The roasted potatoes were SPOT ON, and the salad provided me with the enough greens that I tricked myself into feeling like a healthy person. LOL. The best part about this location?

No one really knew who was supposed to serve us, had to ask for help several times. That said, all in all this place is ridiculously great food at an even better price. I've been to Lebanon and across the middle east. The food is spot on. Very affordable for a New York restaurant.",4.0
Awesome Brunch- middle eastern eggs!Awesome lunch - tangines are deliciousAwesome dinner drinks and soups!I seriously go here at least once a week.The only downside is on the weekends theres always at least a 20 minute wait. But damn its worth it. Service is always great and friendly!Possibly the best restaurant in Williamsburg!,5.0
"Food was delicious! I had the chicken grill, and my friend had the braised lamb. We enjoyed the food enough to want to travel from the Bronx to Brooklyn again.",4.0
"Staff here is amazing and very accommodating. I'm obsessed with their spicy carrots. We had a large group and had 4 orders of them come out, they so spicy and so good! Their hummus is also one of the best in NYC.",5.0

"Food was very good. I felt that the portions were way, way too small. Me and a couple of my friends orders 3 appetizers, and 4 entrees and we all shared. We ALL left still unsatisfied and hungry. Price should be $$$, instead of $$. We went up the block after to meatball shop to fill ourselves up.",3.0
"I love love LOVE this place. I've been here a few times, and each time I've gone I've had a wonderful meal. Their outdoor area is super charming. I also have a few vegetarian friends who I have gone with, and they had a great variety of dishes to choose from. Their hummus is amazing. And the pita bread they serve it with is hot out of the oven. Their salads are fresh and yummy. All of their portions are also pretty generous. Last night I tried the bastilla, and it was amazing. They also have a great wine list and many house cocktails. Great choice for dinner with friends or date night. I will definitely be back soon.",5.0
"Huge fan of the East Village location, but the new Williamsburg location is even nicer!! I love the decor of this place. Moroccan themed with a rustic wood touch to it. SO beautiful. Was surprised to see how packed it was on a Wednesday night and we were still able to grab a table for two. One of the only restaurants I know that serves Halloumi cheese as an appetizer with a few pieces of grilled veggies and pita bread. YUM! For entrees my dining partner had grilled chicken skewers with basmati rice and I had the baked bastile chicken with phyllo puff pastry shell. I dont know how we both saved enough room for dessert but I also ordered baklava and a strawberry rhubarb crumble for us. Love the Moroccan tea! Green tea leaves, fresh mint and sugar in a beautiful silver tea pot. I'm going to be back more often. They have a huge outdoor patio for when its warmer outside.",5.0
"This restaurant is delightful. Food is consistent and always delicious.

"Probably more like 4.5 stars, but I'm feeling generous.  Bottom line:  It was really, really good.  Maybe I'm rounding up b/c I've found it nearly impossible to find good Moroccan food in NY or NJ.  Went to a place in Parsippany & didn't like it much at all.  Have been searching for great Moroccan food since having it in Paris, and this came pretty darn close.  The three of us had a variety of apps...lebni, babaghanoush, hummus, tabouli and falafel.  All were very good.  The tabouli portion was a bit on the small size and probably the least appealing of the five, but still good.  The bread is fantastic.  We each had a different lamb dish, and all were great.  I would rate the couscous higher than the rice.  Shared some kind of almond cake dessert, which was just OK for me, but I'm a chocolate freak.  Nice wine list.  I thought the service was very good for such a busy place.  It does get loud, so I don't know that I'd recommend it for an ""intimate"" dinner, but we thoroughly enjoyed our dinner & would return.",5.0

"One of my all-time favorite spots. I actually prefer this location to its East Village original because the interior is more open and they have a charming greenhouse area with seating in the back.

It's one of the only places that I look forward to ordering chicken (normally I never do because it's so easy for me to cook on my own) because they do such a good job and it's never dry. I've been here for brunch and dinner and had a great experience on all occasions. The only thing to note is that there is always a wait... even on a Monday night.

Food ok nothing special. Bacon cooked to perfection crispiness but recommended home fries were rubbery and soggy. Halumi eggs were recommended as awesome and were pretty good.

She also jumped on me saying: why you didnt tell me!! Isnt it servers responsibility to learn allergies and warn customers thAt their food contains allergens???Dee also came with empty plate and asked me to remove the bread from my plate and put it on her plate. Thats just bad service. She also said: i dont want to charge you for another bread so i will bring you pita instead. Wait time for credit card to be processed and plates collected was super excessive.In general Dee failed completely as a server. Her passive aggressive approach to service was horrible.Mogador is also super overpriced:4.5 dol for small ( their large) glass of oj???4dol for side of avocado?My sons small oj was 3dol and literally was third off small plastic cup.I dont mind paying high pricess for excellent food.

"Came here for Sunday night dinner. I was worried about not being seated and despite the front of the restaurant and bar being full, we were able to be seated in the back. The back of the restaurant has a greenhouse feel, meaning that it looks like an addition to the actually building with see through ceilings, not just a skylight. There were also some couches around which gave it a lounge-y feel. The lighting also helped - there were some holiday lights strung up. I'm pretty sure I sat for 10 minutes trying to decide what to order. Everything looked so good. When the server came by, I asked for her recommendations. She replied the any of the tangines (stew), bastilla (sounded like a meat pie/pastry), the duck entree, and the chicken entree. I ended up ordering the chicken entree and my date got the duck. We also ordered a  bottle of red wine (couldn't tell you what it was but it was good...which doesn't help because they have an extensive wine list). I'm always hesitant ordering chicken since I don't like ordering anything I can make myself. However this chicken dish was AMAZING. It took all the willpower in the world NOT to eat the whole thing in a second or to lick the small plate of potatoes clean. For the record, that might have been the best potatoes I've ever had. The organic blackened chicken was covered in a bunch of spices and was incredibly juicy and tender. The cumin aioli was delicious and went well with the potatoes or chicken. The duck entree came with arugula with balsamic reduction plus french fries.

"Reasonable prices, warm service, a lovely atmosphere that caters to all diner arrangements, and delicious food to boot- Cafe Mogador does not disappoint! On the server's recommendation I ordered a chicken tagine, which I paired with apricot and prunes and a glass of pinot noir. I absolutely loved my dish: the chicken was tender, the taste and portion of the sauce was not overwhelming but still packed a delicious compliment of spices to the meat, and I enjoyed the tart flavours of the apricots with the food. The red was also great with my spiced meal. I ordered their basmati rice instead of the cous cous, which was served with the meat reduction (of whatever meat you ordered, said the server) poured on top. Absolutely delicious. The environment is very charming: with candles being lit on each table giving off an intimate vibe, and framed photographs featuring memorabilia I assume of the family who operates the establishment. There's plenty of seating with large and smaller tables (great for family or friend group dining), a greenhouse at the back with plenty of heating for couples who want a quieter space, and a bar up front. The place caters to all sorts of diners, from the one guy on his laptop at his table when I came in, to giggling people sipping cocktails or solo diners at the bar.The only complaints, although minor, was that my wine arrived in room temperature, and that I wish there was a greater selection of dried fruit that went into my meal. Otherwise, I'm definitely looking to return before I leave!",4.0
"For the price, I was a little disappointed. I went with my Moroccan boyfriend hoping to get a similar taste to what we had eaten in other Moroccan restaurants (notable a great one in Philly).

"Cafe Mogador specializes in Moroccan cuisine with a Middle Eastern twist. I am Lebanese, so have grown up around authentic Middle Eastern cuisine, and a family who owned their own Lebanese restaurant for years. Cafe Mogador comes very close to home cooking for me. Great food, great drinks, and great prices. Cafe Mogador has two locations, one in the East Village and their newer location in Williamsburg. This works out especially well for me, since I  spend all my time outside work in these two areas. My favorite thing at Cafe Mogador (aside from everything...) is the hummus and labne. The hummus is everything hummus should be-- creamy and flavorful, with the perfect ratio of ingredients. It is served with quality extra virgin olive oil, with a sprinkle of paprika on top. Their labne-- a thick, rich strained yogurt--is served also with olive oil and topped with olives. They also serve their appetizers with a complimentary Harissa, which is a  spicy pepper-garlic sauce, which is delicious combination with the hummus and labne. And as if this all wasn't good enough... it is all served with the best pita bread I've ever had. My friend Corinne refers to it as ""Tempur-pita"". Served so hot, I'm burning my fingers because I can't resist, it is so fluffy, and so delicious! Their babaganoush is also worth trying. While I have had their mussels in both of their locations, I preffered the ones in Williamsburg. The mussels in the East Village were served in a leek, fennel and curry ginger broth, which was good, but not as good as the mussels served in Williamsburg that came in a tomato, garlic and parsley broth. My other favorite thing here, is the sauteed shrimp with garlic, olive oil, and chili peppers. An incredibly simple dish, done really well. Cafe Mogador is also famous for their tangines, which is a slow cooked stew with various Middle Eastern spices. I have had the lamb tagine which I enjoyed. I however, would recommend going for cocktails, and splitting a bunch of appetizers (and maybe one entree to try!). I assure you that once you go, you'll be back numerous times. Make sure you get the hummus and labne-- and don't feel guilty asking for more pita!",5.0
"Absolutely loved this place!!! Started with the babaganush and falafel and it was delicious. Also tried the calamari and halumi with veggies appetizer, the flavoring was unique and tasty.  I had the sea bass tagine and it was spiced perfectly.  My husband had the lamb tagine and it was equally as delicious and unique, he said it was unlike any other lamb dish he's tasted. Definately recommend this place for a trendy and delicious night out!",5.0

We happened upon this restaurant by chance, and I'm so glad we went in.  We shared a hummus plate (and ordered another round of naan because it was so good), the raw beet and jicama salad, and a the vegetarian couscous.  Everything was delicious - right down to my blood orange martini.  The service was perfect - our server was always there, but never too close, and our water glasses were always full.  We sat on the back patio, and the atmosphere was comfortable.  My partner and I are both vegetarians, and we felt that we were fed hearty food that was cooked extremely well. We will definitely be back.",5.0
"Reasonable prices, warm service, a lovely atmosphere that caters to all diner arrangements, and delicious food to boot- Cafe Mogador does not disappoint! On the server's recommendation I ordered a chicken tagine, which I paired with apricot and prunes and a glass of pinot noir. I absolutely loved my dish: the chicken was tender, the taste and portion of the sauce was not overwhelming but still packed a delicious compliment of spices to the meat, and I enjoyed the tart flavours of the apricots with the food. The red was also great with my spiced meal. I ordered their basmati rice instead of the cous cous, which was served with the meat reduction (of whatever meat you ordered, said the server) poured on top. Absolutely delicious. The environment is very charming: with candles being lit on each table giving off an intimate vibe, and framed photographs featuring memorabilia I assume of the family who operates the establishment. There's plenty of seating with large and smaller tables (great for family or friend group dining), a greenhouse at the back with plenty of heating for couples who want a quieter space, and a bar up front. The place caters to all sorts of diners, from the one guy on his laptop at his table when I came in, to giggling people sipping cocktails or solo diners at the bar.The only complaints, although minor, was that my wine arrived in room temperature, and that I wish there was a greater selection of dried fruit that went into my meal. Otherwise, I'm definitely looking to return before I leave!",4.0
"For the price, I was a little disappointed. I went with my Moroccan boyfriend hoping to get a similar taste to what we had eaten in other Moroccan restaurants (notable a great one in Philly). The food was good but sweet bread I specifically went for wasn't very sweet. Savory but not like fried dough full of chicken (which is what I wanted). He enjoyed and the atmosphere is lovely. Go in the summer, sit outside.",4.0

Came here in May 2014- for my friend's birthday dinner. The place was a bit crowded and we had to wait for some time (table for 3). Food was great! I enjoyed the calamari appetizer (small portion) and  blackened chicken. Food was light and flavorful! I would recommend it!,5.0
"Cafe Mogador specializes in Moroccan cuisine with a Middle Eastern twist. I am Lebanese, so have grown up around authentic Middle Eastern cuisine, and a family who owned their own Lebanese restaurant for years. Cafe Mogador comes very close to home cooking for me. Great food, great drinks, and great prices. Cafe Mogador has two locations, one in the East Village and their newer location in Williamsburg. This works out especially well for me, since I  spend all my time outside work in these two areas. My favorite thing at Cafe Mogador (aside from everything...) is the hummus and labne. The hummus is everything hummus should be-- creamy and flavorful, with the perfect ratio of ingredients. It is served with quality extra virgin olive oil, with a sprinkle of paprika on top. Their labne-- a thick, rich strained yogurt--is served also with olive oil and topped with olives. They also serve their appetizers with a complimentary Harissa, which is a  spicy pepper-garlic sauce, which is delicious combination with the hummus and labne. And as if this all wasn't good enough... it is all served with the best pita bread I've ever had. My friend Corinne refers to it as ""Tempur-pita"". Served so hot, I'm burning my fingers because I can't resist, it is so fluffy, and so delicious! Their babaganoush is also worth trying. While I have had their mussels in both of their locations, I preffered the ones in Williamsburg. The mussels in the East Village were served in a leek, fennel and curry ginger broth, which was good, but not as good as the mussels served in Williamsburg that came in a tomato, garlic and parsley broth. My other favorite thing here, is the sauteed shrimp with garlic, olive oil, and chili peppers. An incredibly simple dish, done really well. Cafe Mogador is also famous for their tangines, which is a slow cooked stew with various Middle Eastern spices. I have had the lamb tagine which I enjoyed. I however, would recommend going for cocktails, and splitting a bunch of appetizers (and maybe one entree to try!). I assure you that once you go, you'll be back numerous times. Make sure you get the hummus and labne-- and don't feel guilty asking for more pita!",5.0
"Absolutely loved this place!!! Started with the babaganush and falafel and it was delicious. Also tried the calamari and halumi with veggies appetizer, the flavoring was unique and tasty.  I had the sea bass tagine and it was spiced perfectly.  My husband had the lamb tagine and it was equally as delicious and unique, he said it was unlike any other lamb dish he's tasted. Definately recommend this place for a trendy and delicious night out!",5.0

"Very attractive, spacious restaurant. Good service. Pretty tasty food. The pitas were fresh baked and delicious. Lamb with couscous melts in your mouth, excellent. Steak was good, but portion smallish even though it comes with lots of mediocre fries. Stay away from the tiny $11 chicken appetizer. The fried cheese appetizer also not worth it. We didn't try the hummus or other dips but might next time. The cheesecake dessert was decent, but won't change your life one way or the other. Overall, very good. Stick to the mains.",3.0

"I used to go to the east village location with my ex boyfriend all the time, like every weekend for brunches and for dinner.

"My friend and I stopped here for lunch, and were very happy with our choice!  The service was excellent, the atmosphere was lively and friendly (although a little cramped...as most New York restaurants are), and the food was delicious.

The contrast of the creamy chick peas and the warm pita is so simple and so satisfying. Order extra pita.To continue the simple and satisfying recommendation, I recommend the steak frites as an entree. For me, it's a foodgasm. The steak is perfectly cooked and rested in a delicious sauce. With the memorable fries, and it's a slam dunk meal you won't regret.Other notable entrees: lamb grill, any of the tagines (order something else to accompany it), Greek salad (lunch vibe, but still)The drinks:Love the new rosemary spritzer.All of their cocktails are great, though.

"I recently moved to Williamsburg from East Flatbush this past May.  I did it for love.  To be with my girlfriend.  But one of the bonuses of this move is that one of my top five favorite Manhattan restaurants of all-time, Cafe Mogador, built a second location right on Wythe!  I can't put into words how much joy this brought me.If you're familiar with the OG location in the East Village, then you can expect more of the same here with a few upgrades.  The lighting is much better than it's older sister and it has an amazing sun room in the back.  That gets filled pretty quickly when dinner rolls around so just cross your fingers that there's something available.  The food is outstanding.  There's not one bad thing on the menu.  And if you're not well-versed on Mediterranean cuisine, this is a great place for beginners.  Order the hummus & pita for starters.  Any of the tagines or cous-cous platters are solid options for the main course.Need a place to take a first date? This place is a MUST. You're going to impress the hell out of him / her.  But the catch is that they don't take reservations.  The place begins to fill up around the 8pm hour (especially on weekends) so shoot for 6 or 7ish.  I wouldn't suggest this place for super large groups.  It's a cozy spot.It's also a gem for out-of-towners.  The first time my parents (who now live in Florida) met my girlfriend's mom & stepdad (who were visiting NYC for the first time from California), we made dinner plans.  Mogdaor was the no-brainer choice.  We arrived around 6:30 on a Friday and got a table for six immediately.  It made for a perfect getting-to-know-you environment.  Everyone loved it.To summarize?  Cafe Mogador is a must-visit.",5.0
"Made a trip out to Williamsburg with my friend for brunch here. She told me that it was really really good Mediterranean food... for brunch. I was really nervous that there was going to be a wait and it was cold outside so waiting for awhile wouldn't be fun. We got there at 11:30 and we were seated quickly. Originally we wanted to be seated in the back garden room but it was hot and humid back there so we ended up sitting near the entrance. By noon it was packed and there were people waiting outside. It took awhile for us to get service but we did order. My friend just got some eggs and baguettes (huge pieces of bread) and I got the Middle Eastern eggs. My food was good. It included 2 poached eggs, tabouli, salad, hummus, and pita. Everything was surprisingly good. The pitas are homemade and so so soft, but they are covered with seeds so be prepared to check your teeth. The tabouli has some little green pieces that can stuck there too. If you order the Moroccan teas it comes in a really ornate teapot, but I'm not a fan of lemongrass.Tables are really close together, can get cramped. Be prepared to wait. There are other items on their menu that I would be willing to try. Can't say I would go out of my way to eat here, but it's good if you're in the hood.",4.0

"I used to live near the Mogador in the E Vill and oddly enough, I never visited. Probably because that area is chock-a-block full of mediocre falafel joints. Anyways, I stopped by the Mogador in Brooklyn after drinks with about a dozen people. The hostess and waitresses were very kind considering our group trickled in and ordered at a different pace.

Perhaps it was the buzzing in my cocktail-addled brain last night or the fun company, but I don't think I've had falafel that crispy and delicious in a looooong time!! Veggie tagine also yummy (the side couscous even comes with a drizzle of charmoula sauce! drool!) - even the desserts were mouthwateringly good and I am NOT usually a dessert person!

Long waits for brunch on a Sunday are worth the food. The babaganoush was smoky from the roasted eggplant and may be the best I've ever had. The lamb tagine falls off the bone it's so tender and was delicious.  Service a bit on the slow side though but worth the trouble. I heard there is one Manhattan I'd like to try next but will return back to this location for sure. Splitting a tagine and an appetizer is a good idea.,4.0

"I love this place! Went to the St. Mark's location for the first time, excellent food and service.  However the Brooklyn location is not too far from my place and I frequent the place at least once a week. They do not take reservations but the wait is worth it! I appreciate the healthy twist on the fare, they use organic chicken for their dishes.  Will continue to be a loyal customer.",4.0
"I recently moved to Williamsburg from East Flatbush this past May.  I did it for love.  To be with my girlfriend.  But one of the bonuses of this move is that one of my top five favorite Manhattan restaurants of all-time, Cafe Mogador, built a second location right on Wythe!  I can't put into words how much joy this brought me.If you're familiar with the OG location in the East Village, then you can expect more of the same here with a few upgrades.  The lighting is much better than it's older sister and it has an amazing sun room in the back.  That gets filled pretty quickly when dinner rolls around so just cross your fingers that there's something available.  The food is outstanding.  There's not one bad thing on the menu.  And if you're not well-versed on Mediterranean cuisine, this is a great place for beginners.  Order the hummus & pita for starters.  Any of the tagines or cous-cous platters are solid options for the main course.Need a place to take a first date? This place is a MUST. You're going to impress the hell out of him / her.  But the catch is that they don't take reservations.  The place begins to fill up around the 8pm hour (especially on weekends) so shoot for 6 or 7ish.  I wouldn't suggest this place for super large groups.  It's a cozy spot.It's also a gem for out-of-towners.  The first time my parents (who now live in Florida) met my girlfriend's mom & stepdad (who were visiting NYC for the first time from California), we made dinner plans.  Mogdaor was the no-brainer choice.  We arrived around 6:30 on a Friday and got a table for six immediately.  It made for a perfect getting-to-know-you environment.  Everyone loved it.To summarize?  Cafe Mogador is a must-visit.",5.0
"Made a trip out to Williamsburg with my friend for brunch here. She told me that it was really really good Mediterranean food... for brunch. I was really nervous that there was going to be a wait and it was cold outside so waiting for awhile wouldn't be fun. We got there at 11:30 and we were seated quickly. Originally we wanted to be seated in the back garden room but it was hot and humid back there so we ended up sitting near the entrance. By noon it was packed and there were people waiting outside. It took awhile for us to get service but we did order. My friend just got some eggs and baguettes (huge pieces of bread) and I got the Middle Eastern eggs. My food was good.

"This was my go to place when I lived in the East Village, so I was happy to discover a Brooklyn outpost when I moved into Williamsburg.Personally, I love the design of the Brooklyn Cafe Mogador even more than the East Village version.

"What an absolutely great surprise!We arrived here for a sunday brunch and the restaurant was crowded but after only 25 minutes we could have a seat.

The Middle Eastern Eggs (eggs any style, hummus, tabouli, arabic salad, zahatar pita) allows you to taste a bit of every flavor of middle east cuisine. The Grilled Salmon Nicoise (served over organic greens, beets, french beans, capers, tomatoes, egg & marinated potatoes) is simple but definitely good and full of taste.

"When my friend and I got to Cafe Mogador for brunch on a Saturday around 1pm, we were probably the seventh group on the list, waiting to be seated. Although it was super crowded and there were tons of people waiting outside, we were seated within 10 minutes, which was a nice surprise. Initially, we had a little miscommunication and received the wrong order of bacon (we asked for canadian bacon but was given regular bacon), but that was remedied quickly and we both enjoyed our meal. I was surprised by the number of pancakes I was given...they were so filling.The service wasn't the best...I felt like it was so hard to track down a waiter or waitress but that might be because it was so busy.

"Service is great, very friendly. We were a party of 4 and had the option of a less comfortable table that was ready straight away, or we could let the party of 3 behind us take it and wait for another that was far cozier and ""finishing up."" After being offered to lounge in the back part of the restaurant, on some lovely low sofas lit by soft candle light, we decided to wait it out and get a few drinks while our table nommed on the last bits of their dessert. Though she had to come back 4 times to get our drink order (we had a LOT of catching up and story telling to do this particular night), the waitress remained as friendly as ever when she took our drink order and brought it too us. It wasn't soon after we were seated for our meal....The food itself is pretty damn good. I'm from San Francisco, home to what Food&Wine, Bon Apetit, and every other foodie magazine would argue is the BEST moroccan restaurant in the country (Aziza), so my standards for moroccan fare are high. But this did not disappoint!! At times, I thought there could have been a tiny bit more flavor either in the cous cous or the sauce that my lamb tangine consisted of, but this isn't Aziza...and we sure as hell aint' in Morocco. But quality of meat, the flavor that it *did* have, and the proportion in which it came were completely satisfactory. The chicken kababs my friend hand are highly recommended, or anything that comes with taziki sauce because it was OUTSTANDING!! Also recommended is the pita. Plain and simple, the fluffiest, warmest, tastiest pita you've ever had. Cross my heart and hope to die this actually beats Aziza's pita. No contest. Prices are very fair, bathrooms are very clean, the atmosphere is lively, buzzing, but warm and cozy, even intimate I'd say. I highly recommend coming here if you live in the neighborhood. It will definitely be a new ""go-to"" place for me- someone who doesn't eat out much but is sure snobby and picky when I do. That said, go and enjoy!!  ..... and grab some of matchbooks from the bathroom if there are any ;-) Really lovely.",4.0

"Went here for dinner tonight with the fiance and a friend. None of us were super hungry and we are used to the huge Moroccan restaurant portions in the DC area, so we decided to play it safe and split two entrees between the three of us. We ordered the Bastilla and the Lamb Tagine. Service was mixed. We had two servers. One was outgoing and friendly, the other was dry and distant and just didn't seem like she was that interested in us or our questions. Also, when we first got there, the hostess told us we could grab the outside table that had just opened up, it took about four minutes for anyone to notice us and drop off menus. Not a huge amount of time but worth a mention.The Bastilla was perfectly cooked. The filo was flaky and crunchy and soft at the same time. The filling was delicious, but could have used a little extra flavor in my opinion. The sauce that came on the side of the dish was a great supplement for that.Tagine, as many of you probably know, is named after the pot the meat is traditionally cooked in (a tagine). In the past at other Moroccan restaurants, my lamb tagine has always been served in a tagine. Here it came out on a plate. Different plating from what I'm used to, of course, and certainly not as pretty, but here's what's important: it didn't have any negative affect on the TASTE and texture of the meat. The lamb was perfectly seasoned and fell off the bone- it was super tender. I ordered my lamb tagine with basmati rice and charmoulla (spicy cilantro) sauce. The choosing of the sauce was also a first for me- in my past experiences I have never been given a choice in sauces for the meat. It was perfection. And for those of you with Persian backgrounds or culinary experience: the combination of the rice, the lamb, and the sauce actually reminded me a lot of Ghormeh sabzi. You can never go wrong reminding anyone of the taste of Ghormeh sabzi, by the way.So after a very satisfying meal, we decided to go for dessert. We ordered the Creme Brulee and the Almond and Pear cake. The waitress returned from the kitchen to tell us that Creme Brulee was not available for the evening (bummer) so we asked her for her recommendation, which was the Panna Cotta. We decided to go for it. Both were absolutely delicious, and to be honest I think the dessert course became the table's favorite course of the night. What can I say? If I ever need a dessert craving fulfilled (and I'm not a huge dessert person, so this is saying a lot) and I'm in the NYC area (yes, anywhere in ANY of the boroughs!), I am coming straight here! Dessert perfection!",4.0
"This place is fantastic. Great flavors, tender meat, and affordable prices. I've never had a bad meal here.  You can really tell that they take their time with preparing their food.

"My friends and I were wandering around Williamsburg one night around dinner time.  I yelped the neighborhood and we decided on Mogador because of the great reviews and it really truly lived up to the stars ratings.  The group ordered the Mixed Platter for appetizer and there was nothing left.  We actually ordered more bread so we could lick up every last bit of sauce.  If you're a sweet and savory diner, like me, go for the Lamb Tagine with the apricot and prunes but I tried a bit of my friend's Casablanca and it was also tasty.  The service was pleasant and helpful, the atmosphere was really cool - I felt like I was in a greenhouse, and the food? absolutely delicious.  Maybe I'm a bit biased because I L-O-V-E Mediterranean food since I basically lived in my best friend's Egyptian house... Or maybe the food just simply lived up to my biased palate!  Take it either way, just go.",5.0
"This place has grown substantially in popularity since it opened, even before gothamist gave it a rave in early January. The seating is such that, even when crowded, you won't feel pinched (contrast that with Five Leaves or Cafe Collette) and the service is snappy. I'd like a few more options for lunch, and any dish that features protein doesn't have a ton of it, but four stars mean I'll keep coming back.",4.0
"Wow, did I have a good meal here. Visited Brooklyn from Vancouver, BC in early October and stayed in Williamsburg (which I'd recommend). I consider myself pretty picky about restaurants/food quality/service as Vancouver's full of great spots and having worked as both a server and line cook in Vancouver while at university. Basically don't send me cold/boring/overcooked/slow food and please have knowledgeable/friendly/professional (relative to the venue) service or I'll notice. I might not say much, but I wont be back... Cafe Mogador, I WILL be back!Enjoyed a dinner in the back atrium area which I'd actually prefer/request next time as it's a pretty cool room with plants, lots of windows, etc...For dinner (shared) had some sort of salad and then cous-cous wihich was good but the best was the lamb tangine!!

Overall yes I'd go back if I'm in the area (I came from Queens to meet my friend).  I think there's an outdoor part also in the back.",4.0
"Went here for dinner tonight with the fiance and a friend. None of us were super hungry and we are used to the huge Moroccan restaurant portions in the DC area, so we decided to play it safe and split two entrees between the three of us. We ordered the Bastilla and the Lamb Tagine. Service was mixed. We had two servers. One was outgoing and friendly, the other was dry and distant and just didn't seem like she was that interested in us or our questions. Also, when we first got there, the hostess told us we could grab the outside table that had just opened up, it took about four minutes for anyone to notice us and drop off menus. Not a huge amount of time but worth a mention.The Bastilla was perfectly cooked. The filo was flaky and crunchy and soft at the same time. The filling was delicious, but could have used a little extra flavor in my opinion. The sauce that came on the side of the dish was a great supplement for that.Tagine, as many of you probably know, is named after the pot the meat is traditionally cooked in (a tagine). In the past at other Moroccan restaurants, my lamb tagine has always been served in a tagine. Here it came out on a plate. Different plating from what I'm used to, of course, and certainly not as pretty, but here's what's important: it didn't have any negative affect on the TASTE and texture of the meat. The lamb was perfectly seasoned and fell off the bone- it was super tender. I ordered my lamb tagine with basmati rice and charmoulla (spicy cilantro) sauce. The choosing of the sauce was also a first for me- in my past experiences I have never been given a choice in sauces for the meat. It was perfection. And for those of you with Persian backgrounds or culinary experience: the combination of the rice, the lamb, and the sauce actually reminded me a lot of Ghormeh sabzi. You can never go wrong reminding anyone of the taste of Ghormeh sabzi, by the way.So after a very satisfying meal, we decided to go for dessert. We ordered the Creme Brulee and the Almond and Pear cake. The waitress returned from the kitchen to tell us that Creme Brulee was not available for the evening (bummer) so we asked her for her recommendation, which was the Panna Cotta. We decided to go for it. Both were absolutely delicious, and to be honest I think the dessert course became the table's favorite course of the night. What can I say? If I ever need a dessert craving fulfilled (and I'm not a huge dessert person, so this is saying a lot) and I'm in the NYC area (yes, anywhere in ANY of the boroughs!), I am coming straight here! Dessert perfection!",4.0
"This place is fantastic. Great flavors, tender meat, and affordable prices. I've never had a bad meal here.  You can really tell that they take their time with preparing their food. This is, by far, one of the best restaurants in Wiliiamsburg, especially given their ""relatively"" milder snooty hipster factor.",5.0
"My friends and I were wandering around Williamsburg one night around dinner time.  I yelped the neighborhood and we decided on Mogador because of the great reviews and it really truly lived up to the stars ratings.  The group ordered the Mixed Platter for appetizer and there was nothing left.  We actually ordered more bread so we could lick up every last bit of sauce.  If you're a sweet and savory diner, like me, go for the Lamb Tagine with the apricot and prunes but I tried a bit of my friend's Casablanca and it was also tasty.  The service was pleasant and helpful, the atmosphere was really cool - I felt like I was in a greenhouse, and the food? absolutely delicious.  Maybe I'm a bit biased because I L-O-V-E Mediterranean food since I basically lived in my best friend's Egyptian house... Or maybe the food just simply lived up to my biased palate!  Take it either way, just go.",5.0
"This place has grown substantially in popularity since it opened, even before gothamist gave it a rave in early January. The seating is such that, even when crowded, you won't feel pinched (contrast that with Five Leaves or Cafe Collette) and the service is snappy. I'd like a few more options for lunch, and any dish that features protein doesn't have a ton of it, but four stars mean I'll keep coming back.",4.0
"Wow, did I have a good meal here. Visited Brooklyn from Vancouver, BC in early October and stayed in Williamsburg (which I'd recommend). I consider myself pretty picky about restaurants/food quality/service as Vancouver's full of great spots and having worked as both a server and line cook in Vancouver while at university. Basically don't send me cold/boring/overcooked/slow food and please have knowledgeable/friendly/professional (relative to the venue) service or I'll notice. I might not say much, but I wont be back... Cafe Mogador, I WILL be back!Enjoyed a dinner in the back atrium area which I'd actually prefer/request next time as it's a pretty cool room with plants, lots of windows, etc...For dinner (shared) had some sort of salad and then cous-cous wihich was good but the best was the lamb tangine!! Definitely going back for that alone.  A couple glasses of wine rounded out the dinner. Summary: Cool location/cool back room/good service/good food.",5.0
I love love love Cafe Mogador.  The tagines are my fave for dinner - the chicken tagine is moist and flavorful and the vegetable tagine is full of yummy vegetables and crispy okra!  But what I love the most about Cafe Mogador is the brunch!  Get the eggs benedict deal with the Moroccan Eggs Benedict and you will be content the whole day.  It is the best eggs benedict that I have had in the city.  I am just itching to go back for another one this weekend!,5.0

"That rare fifth star should be reserved for restaurants like this one.  Reasonable prices, fresh and well-sourced ingredients, tasty dishes with elegant presentations, and a welcoming, bustling, bistro atmosphere.If you like Mogador's East Village location, then you will not be disappointed here.  We recently came for brunch and ordered the middle eastern eggs and the haloumi eggs.  The organic eggs were impeccably poached and the bright orange yolks revealed that they are indeed well-sourced eggs.  The hummus was standard, salads were fresh and lightly dressed, and the zaatar bread tasted home-made.  The haloumi eggs were particularly good, the haloumi perfectly seared on the outside and moist and chewy as you cut into it.  The fresh grilled tomato was a perfect, providing an acid balance the plainness of haloumi and eggs.  Everything was seasoned beautifully, presented elegantly, and came out of the kitchen quick and hot.The Moroccan tea was very good and the service was also pretty good.  We will be happy to come back for dinner and will report back to you.The only message we would offer the owners and management is:  don't change!  The minute a place this good decides to change the eggs to conventional, cut a corner by pre-dressing the salads, or raise the prices once you have the big crowds, the carriage will turn into a pumpkin.  We hope this never happens.",5.0

I have to be honest and say that this is a gross rip off, and it breaks my heart to think people leave this thinking that they just ate Moroccan food.

"Gosh, let me start by saying as I write this review my girlfriend says to me ""when is the last time I have ever had to throw up on the street after eating at a restaurant?""  I do not remember a time she has done this.  Let's get into some details:We arrived at this restaurant at about 9pm on Sunday night. We started with drinks before ordering food.  The menu said they have orange flavored vodka (specified in the specialty cocktails they sell for $11 a piece), however, the waiter says they do not have any flavored vodka.  I reluctantly order orange juice with vodka.  My girlfriend points out the fact that the offer orange flavored vodka on two specialty cocktails and the waiter responds, ""OH, well, those are well vodkas, not real vodkas"".  OK, so now I know that their specialty drinks are poured out of their well and not out of their ""real vodkas"".  Now I know to not order a specialty drink in this place...   For double the price at that....OK, drink issues, this is a restaurant and we are hungry so no big deal....We ordered our appetizers, I had shrimp and she had hummus, both mediocre at best. Then came time for our entree order, a new person server shows up with no explanation, after asked, ""what happened to the original server?' she replied I am just helping out.  We decided to order with her, one order chicken tagine and the other order is a hanger steak.The steak was OK and so were the greens(the server pointed out they would not be watercress, however mesclin after the order was placed), the fries were horrible. I could cook ore ida fries from the frozen department in a grocery store and they would be better by a long shot.THEN, My girlfriend's chicken was not great, but the rice was basically cooked in a flavor that tasted like a dish washing soap.  She basically kept her composure as long as she could as we signed out ASAP and then she threw up within 2 blocks of leaving the restaurant.  I almost called an ambulance, but she said she would be ok.....  Enter at your own risk.  Or just have drinks, but  be prepared to overpay for well drinks.  DO NOT eat the food.  seriously....",1.0

"This place ROCKS!!!!! The food is so good and the service is great! On our last night in Brooklyn, the rain gods were running amuck but we decided to brave the sheets of rain and wind to get one last good meal. I am so glad we found this place! The ambiance is actually really cozy and romantic. The back room is a great place for a date! We sat in the front to watch the crazy weather. For a starter I order the mango martini- strong, apparently like all drinks served in Brooklyn. Mommy likes! I order the sampler and he ordered the cous cous with chicken. The sampler is for people like me who refuse to settle on 1 craving- a little bit of this, a little bit of that and a LOT of yummy. The tahini and hummus were on point, could have done without the arabic salad but it was so good I made my BF have food envy. His, however, was equally as good. The chicken was SO tender and tasty. We both enjoyed our meals so much we thought about returning the next day for breakfast... A MUST-VISIT!!!!",5.0

"Cafe Mogador is consistently good and has that rare ability of being able to cater to most diets and appetites. The only appetite of interest, however, is my own and, with food on the brain, I stepped in for breakfast. With an interior that is light, chic and equipped with a lovely enclosed patio area that serves as a romantic backdrop on winter's eve, one could do much worse in terms of choosing a space in which to partake of your favorite meal.The halumi eggs were an absolute delight, incorporating poached eggs, tomato and halumi cheese in a rich and intricate interplay of flavors. In a world in which everyone appears to be serving the same variation on a brunch theme, Cafe Mogador's twist on familiar favorites is a refreshing change of scenery, though they cater to pancake traditionalists too. The service is also attentive, without being intrusive.As someone who seeks out Mediterranean cuisine frequently (read: hummus fiend), I have subsequently returned to try their dinner and was confronted with yet another good meal with which to contend.

"succulant moroccan cuisine has made its way to williamsburg!  cafe mogador has a warm, welcoming ambiance and an enclosed outdoor seating area that let's you enjoy dinner under the stars.  upon entering the restaurant, you can smell the allspice, dill and plethra of other exotic spices.  we started with the halumi cheese appetizer pictured above. the briny, bright flavor of the cheese, paired with the roasted tomato, pepper and pearl onion skewer was a perfect introduction.  for our entree, we split a chicken cous cous and mixed grill platter.  the cous cous was fluffy and filled with plump raisins, tender vegetables and roasted chickpeas.  the marinated grilled meat skewers were grilled over a coal fire and served with more vegatables and basmati rice.  the compliments were a huge bonus too; there was a small side of a spicy, minced grainy type dipping sauce, a cucumber yogurt sauce and a tabouli salad.  keep this place in mind if you're being health conscious as well.  the menu had plenty of waist friendly options.  good find, we'll definitely be back (and they deliver!)~had to add another paragraph to this post tonight, my girlfriends and i stopped in for brunch this afternoon.  the service was a little slow but understandably so, it was packed.  it took us longer to get our mimosas and bloody mary's than our entrees but when they turned up, we were all smiles.  the food was spot on, seems like there are just a few kinks to work out behind the bar.  i'll definitley be back for brunch though, mogador was buzzing with fresh young faces and they have something to offer no matter what you're in the mood for. brunch, lunch or dinner, i'd say cafe mogador's been a cool and delicious addition to the neighborhood~",4.0
So yeah Mogador rocks. SUCCULENT LAMB Y'ALL. I got the chicken couscous which was wonderful and fragrant and smooth and everything couscous should promise. The falafel was greener than rolling knolls in New England while the hummus and warm pita bread made an appearance as good sidekicks. The cucumber gin cocktail I got was maybe a little too sweet for me. Finish the night off with a shot of espresso and it's all good.,4.0
"Yum! I came here for dinner last night with a friend who lives in the neighborhood and was pleasantly surprised by my tasty Moroccan meal. I ordered the chicken tagine cooked with olives and lemon peel and truly enjoyed it. The chicken was succulent and picked up the flavors of the spices beautifully. I am not a big tubule person, so next time I would skip the mixed platter and order just the hummus to begin. We also shared an order of the steamed mussels, which were perfectly cooked and yummy. We skipped dessert due to the fact we were both so full. The price was right with drinks, food, and tip being relatively reasonable. Oh my, can't believe I almost forgot-- the DRINKS! Out of this world good drinks. I had the blood orange martini on the rocks while my friend had the cucumber martini straight up. Both were flavorful and complex and oh so good. We both had two. Come here if you are in the area-- they wont disappoint!",4.0

"A-mazing!  I went for brunch with a friend today and we were raving about this meal for the rest of the day.  I can't remember the last time I was so satisfied.  We started with the fresh hummus and pita - straight out of the oven and with the spicy tomato paste it was perfect.  I ordered the Chicken Grill, and she had the Moroccan Eggs Benedict and we both had a blood orange mimosa.  The mimosa was so smooth and fresh that every sip was worth savoring.  My Chicken grill was tender and juicy to the point of perfection, just the right amount of grill on the outside, all the moisture and richness on the inside.  The jasmine rice with cilantro and grilled vegetables complimented it perfectly, and I gobbled up the fresh yogurt sauce.  My friend had equally spectacular things to say about her food, and while we did have to wait about 15min for a table (not surprising anywhere on a busy Sunday morning, and not an unpleasant wait) the service was spectacular.  Everything was delivered promptly, fresh from the kitchen, and cleared away as soon as it was clear that we had finished it.  Our water glasses were never empty, and our server was insightful, helpful and charming.  It goes down in my book as one of the best meals I've ever had and I look very forward to doing it again soon!  Go.

"succulant moroccan cuisine has made its way to williamsburg!  cafe mogador has a warm, welcoming ambiance and an enclosed outdoor seating area that let's you enjoy dinner under the stars.  upon entering the restaurant, you can smell the allspice, dill and plethra of other exotic spices.  we started with the halumi cheese appetizer pictured above. the briny, bright flavor of the cheese, paired with the roasted tomato, pepper and pearl onion skewer was a perfect introduction.  for our entree, we split a chicken cous cous and mixed grill platter.  the cous cous was fluffy and filled with plump raisins, tender vegetables and roasted chickpeas.  the marinated grilled meat skewers were grilled over a coal fire and served with more vegatables and basmati rice.  the compliments were a huge bonus too; there was a small side of a spicy, minced grainy type dipping sauce, a cucumber yogurt sauce and a tabouli salad.  keep this place in mind if you're being health conscious as well.  the menu had plenty of waist friendly options.  good find, we'll definitely be back (and they deliver!)~had to add another paragraph to this post tonight, my girlfriends and i stopped in for brunch this afternoon.  the service was a little slow but understandably so, it was packed.  it took us longer to get our mimosas and bloody mary's than our entrees but when they turned up, we were all smiles.  the food was spot on, seems like there are just a few kinks to work out behind the bar.  i'll definitley be back for brunch though, mogador was buzzing with fresh young faces and they have something to offer no matter what you're in the mood for. brunch, lunch or dinner, i'd say cafe mogador's been a cool and delicious addition to the neighborhood~",4.0
So yeah Mogador rocks. SUCCULENT LAMB Y'ALL. I got the chicken couscous which was wonderful and fragrant and smooth and everything couscous should promise. The falafel was greener than rolling knolls in New England while the hummus and warm pita bread made an appearance as good sidekicks. The cucumber gin cocktail I got was maybe a little too sweet for me. Finish the night off with a shot of espresso and it's all good.,4.0
"Yum! I came here for dinner last night with a friend who lives in the neighborhood and was pleasantly surprised by my tasty Moroccan meal. I ordered the chicken tagine cooked with olives and lemon peel and truly enjoyed it. The chicken was succulent and picked up the flavors of the spices beautifully. I am not a big tubule person, so next time I would skip the mixed platter and order just the hummus to begin. We also shared an order of the steamed mussels, which were perfectly cooked and yummy. We skipped dessert due to the fact we were both so full. The price was right with drinks, food, and tip being relatively reasonable. Oh my, can't believe I almost forgot-- the DRINKS! Out of this world good drinks. I had the blood orange martini on the rocks while my friend had the cucumber martini straight up. Both were flavorful and complex and oh so good. We both had two. Come here if you are in the area-- they wont disappoint!",4.0
"not gonna say this place is not authentic.  i was just expecting my tagine to be big and sloppy and saucy.  and it wasn't served with giant bread pieces either.  i'm gonna give it another try at some pointoh also, lenny kravitz was there",3.0

"FINALLY OPEN!  After waiting patiently, Cafe Mogador has opened the doors to its second location in North Williamsburg.  I went on the second day it opened- and for an early weeknight dinner, so it was pretty empty.  But the decor is cute and welcoming with a great outdoor/indoor patio area out back.  Food is just as good as EV location.  Lamb cous cous is my favorite.",5.0
"Annoyed and offended. Whatever you buy here be sure to get a receipt. I didn't and I am sorry!  Espresso two dollars and fifty cents as printed on the menu.

Well Guy, I came in here with seven dollars and left with four twenty five. The trick you have got going by counting the bills in the register and telling me what you had before proves nothing. What about the bills in my wallet? Should I have counted those in front of you to prove a point? Apology in order and at the very least give the client who would have been happy to bring  significant business  to your establishment you have just lost FOREVER over a dollar. Nice decor is about all they have! Get a receipt. If I have said it once I say it a thousand times: When serving the public ensure good long term relationships by understanding the customer and being able to admit you might have made a mistake.

"This was the first place I visited for a bite to eat when visiting Williamsburg (Brooklyn).  It's very cute with lots of interesting, antique decor. It has a lovely full bar along the left hand side that takes the cafe vibe up a notch.  They offer a nice specialty cocktail menu as well. We sat in the back with is an  enclosed outdoor area that is basically a greenhouse dining room - lots of great light!  The employees are the Williamsburg, hipster types that you might expect and are very pleasant.  There is a moroccan cuisine offering of delish cucumber yogurt and falafal (among others) that are only $5 each.  I recommend ordering a few for sharing.  Did I mention that the yogurt is wonderful?  Well, it is.  They also have a brunch menu of eggs benedict variations and meat skewers.  I tried Turkish coffee here for the first time and really enjoyed it.  It came in a nice hot pot with an adorable tiny Turkish coffee tea cup- very authentic (as far as I know!)",5.0
"Nice ambiance, great place for outdoor dining. However, the food was decent albeit overpriced. I mean, $22 for kebobs over rice? It was the service that put me off. When 20% is the non-a-hole tipper standard, I expect good service. The bartender was slower than cold molasses uphill (we were 2 of 4 or 5 people at the bar) and the server nonchalantly visited the table a few times. The most eager visit was merely to drop the check so she could get her tip. The water filler/ bus boy was much more attentive and interested in us, I wish the tip went more to him.",2.0
Went there for brunch. They have a nice ambiance and egg normandy was good. They were out of blood orange mimoza and regular mimoza had an artificial flavor.  One cup of coffee and a small orange juice is included to the meal but there is no free refill of the coffee.

"I visited Cafe Mogador due to my boyfriend's craving for Moroccan food.

The interior of Cafe Mogador is simple, crowded and somewhat loud.Drinks: we opted for a bottle of Australian Malbec and were both very pleased with the wine. Food: my boyfriend insisted on ordering a feast and we started with the mixed platter of hummus, baba ganoush, and tabouli. The pita served with the platter was warm and soft.  The platter itself was delicious and the dips were well complimented by the fluffy pita. We also ordered the roasted haloumi cheese as an appetizer. This dish exceeded both our expectations and was simple yet satisfying and served with a roasted vegetable kebab. For our entrees we ordered the bastilla and the lamb tagine with chickpeas, raisins, and onions. The tagine sauce was rich and perfect for soaking up the accompanying cous cous. Having been to Morocco and being a big fan of bastilla there, this rendition was authentic and flavorful. The mix of chicken and sweeter spices is a change from the usual savory dishes served as entrees. We also got a side of roasted eggplant with tahini which was very good. We ended our meal with some mint tea and a slice of pear and cranberry pie. The food at Cafe Mogador was solid throughout our entire meal both in regards to authenticity and taste.  The service was pretty spotty at times although we found the staff to be very friendly.

"I randomly walked by looking for a new place to have dinner. At first, I was attracted by the decor. Then, I could not make up my mind of what to order...as I saw plates going by, everything looked so delicious. And it is! The food is exceptional, very fresh. The service is perfect, the waitress are very nice. I cannot wait to go back there.",5.0
