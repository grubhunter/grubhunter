"Went here last night with my husband as we looked for apartments in the area. We wanted to find some good food and found this place on Yelp and boy were we impressed. The place looks kinda small from the outside with a large bar taking up half of the front room but there's a ton of seating in the back. The owner (I assume) was the bartender, waiter and cook. He was extremely personable and clearly loved his food and his restaurant. We had grape leafs (warmed as per his suggestion which were delish) and the best baba ganoush I've ever tried for appetizers. Then I had a vegetarian entree of eggplant which was tomato sauce based and very soft in a good way and my husband had chicken kabob with hummus. For dessert we had kanafeh which was a cheesy sweet pastry dessert to die for. If I'm in the area again we're definitely coming back! Everything was delicious!",5.0

"Ali's is the real deal. First of all, the ambiance is friendly, casual, and most importantly, very clean. Our table was already clean, but as we sat down Ali wiped it down again and told us it was clean enough to eat off of the table, which we appreciated :)The food is outrageously good. Everything we ate was rich and perfectly seasoned. My boyfriend is the kind of person who puts salt on literally everything, but he didn't bother because all the dishes we ordered were perfectly seasoned already. We ordered the sauteed fava beans, baba ganoush, stuffed cabbage with lamb, and falafel. I highly recommend all of them. Ali makes everything from scratch, even the pickled turnips in the falafel! The prices are incredibly reasonable considering the quality and love that goes into every dish. Ali orders the highest quality ingredients to cook with - for example, he only orders savoy cabbage for his cabbage rolls, so he only has them when savoy cabbage is in season and available for him to purchase.Give this place a try!

"We ordered what Ali recommended: The vegetarian okra was really really rich with many nuanced flavors at work. The cauliflower and beef & lamb stew was amazing as well--the cauliflower was perfectly cooked, they kept their shape but was not crunchy at all, and the beef & lamb were grass fed, very well mixed, doesn't not taste gamey at all and complimented the cauliflower well. We also ordered what was recommended on yelp--the cilantro garlic ""french fries"". They are spicy, savory and tart. Do not think of them as French fries, and definitely do not ask for ketchup--you will break Ali's heart and ruin what you could have had. Ali also gave us the pickled eggplants to try. They were tasty and garlicky--filled with minced walnut and minced garlic. We had a great experience there. Like what others said it's a one man's show--very talkative too.

Everything we ate was rich and perfectly seasoned. My boyfriend is the kind of person who puts salt on literally everything, but he didn't bother because all the dishes we ordered were perfectly seasoned already. We ordered the sauteed fava beans, baba ganoush, stuffed cabbage with lamb, and falafel. I highly recommend all of them. Ali makes everything from scratch, even the pickled turnips in the falafel! The prices are incredibly reasonable considering the quality and love that goes into every dish. Ali orders the highest quality ingredients to cook with - for example, he only orders savoy cabbage for his cabbage rolls, so he only has them when savoy cabbage is in season and available for him to purchase.Give this place a try!

My only disappointment was that my phone was dying and could not stay longer for drinks and dessert.",5.0
"Ali's is delicious and such a warm neighborhood restaurant. I discovered this little gem with a few friends this past Saturday night, and Ali is a welcoming host and amazing chef. We had the fatoush and garlic cilantro fries to start - so delicious - and I had the cauliflower with meat sauce and it was outrageously good. Ali also brought us some eggplant stuffed with walnuts that was so good. Both of my friends ordered Lamb and said it was excellent, if a bit salty. The Lebanese wine was very good as well. Large portions, reasonable prices, and a great experience overall!",5.0
"Ali's has consistently excellent food, whether dining in or for take-out. The portions are substantial, prices are reasonable, and the restaurant/bar has a warm and welcoming vibe. The owner (Ali) is always friendly, usually chatting with customers at the bar. Try the vegetarian baby okra and the kibbeh :)",5.0
"Ali's is the real deal. First of all, the ambiance is friendly, casual, and most importantly, very clean. Our table was already clean, but as we sat down Ali wiped it down again and told us it was clean enough to eat off of the table, which we appreciated :)The food is outrageously good. Everything we ate was rich and perfectly seasoned. My boyfriend is the kind of person who puts salt on literally everything, but he didn't bother because all the dishes we ordered were perfectly seasoned already. We ordered the sauteed fava beans, baba ganoush, stuffed cabbage with lamb, and falafel. I highly recommend all of them. Ali makes everything from scratch, even the pickled turnips in the falafel! The prices are incredibly reasonable considering the quality and love that goes into every dish. Ali orders the highest quality ingredients to cook with - for example, he only orders savoy cabbage for his cabbage rolls, so he only has them when savoy cabbage is in season and available for him to purchase.Give this place a try! So worth it. We want to come back sometime and try the mojitos which we hear are excellent!",5.0
"The best part of the experience was Ali.  He said he's been in the neighborhood for over 30 years..close to 40 I think...and he has a very pleasant and welcoming disposition.  He stands by his food and is confident of his culinary skills...as he should be!I ordered the chicken pita wrap - now this was very good, don't get me wrong.  That said,  while satisfying, I've had better when compared to the vast number of other Lebanese places I've been.  I would like to check out some of the other items as I have a feeling they could rise to the challenge.   I think this is worth checking out.  I would inquire more on what is most popular and what Ali thinks is the ""best"".  The bar seems chill - I could see myself coming here with a friend or two...grabbing some drinks and sharing a few items...might be a good options if you want to test the waters IMO.",4.0
"We ordered what Ali recommended: The vegetarian okra was really really rich with many nuanced flavors at work. The cauliflower and beef & lamb stew was amazing as well--the cauliflower was perfectly cooked, they kept their shape but was not crunchy at all, and the beef & lamb were grass fed, very well mixed, doesn't not taste gamey at all and complimented the cauliflower well. We also ordered what was recommended on yelp--the cilantro garlic ""french fries"". They are spicy, savory and tart. Do not think of them as French fries, and definitely do not ask for ketchup--you will break Ali's heart and ruin what you could have had. Ali also gave us the pickled eggplants to try. They were tasty and garlicky--filled with minced walnut and minced garlic. We had a great experience there. Like what others said it's a one man's show--very talkative too. He's renovated the place so it no longer looks like a sports bar. It has a really nice bar and large seating area in the back.There are also items Ali doesn't put on the menu, check with him to see whether there are any specials--such as fish.",4.0
"Ali is such a sweetheart. The kefta is really tasty and Ali is always really, really friendly. We've also had the hummus which is delicious. Ali always gives us a nice salad to share. We walk by there every day and when he's out, he always waves and says hi. I really think this is a special place in Bushwick.",5.0
"My boyfriend and I were visiting Brooklyn for a week and wanted to try some of the neighborhood's restaurants. I'm so glad we picked Ali's! The food was incredible and Ali was so welcoming and helpful with suggestions, which was great because we  were unfamiliar with Lebanese cuisine. I will definitely visit this spot next time I'm in town. Thanks for a great experience Ali!",5.0
"Just ordered food to take out, but the chicken shawarma my boyfriend got was hands down the best shawarma I've ever tried, and the eggplant tomato stew I got was incredible. So happy this place is right down the street.Also I've never met someone so passionate about what they do, go and have a drink with Ali and he'll tell you all about it. My favorite neighborhood place.",5.0
Great food and even nicer owner/bartender who will pour your free drinks in no time. Please go there Friday night to end your night and your night will never end.,5.0
"The food is always great and Ali is the best! My friends and I used to come here ALL THE TIME simply to have a chat with Ali and get a STRONG cocktail. Rarely order off the menu, and instead Ali suggests what is fresh and best for the day. He has yet to let us down :)",4.0
Amazing food at a great price. I had the eggplant and the kenafa ummmmm scrumptuous city. My friends ordered cauliflower and okra with meat. They loved it. I will be back,5.0
"Came in here with gf for my first Lebanese food experience. She's Turkish and really difficult to impress with Middle Eastern cuisine, however, she was overjoyed with Ali's cooking, as was I. Everything was full of flavor, refreshing, healthy-tasting, and unique (for me at least). We chatted with Ali at the bar for a while afterword and were amazed to learn that he runs the restaurant single-handedly- he's the chef, line cook, server, cashier, and bartender! It's clear he puts a lot of love into his food and is very proud of his work. An inspiring meal and experience that I'm sure to repeat over and over. Go here.",5.0
